2503286,5,B000E6FVXG,"This program has a variety of soccer shooting drills that will be helpful to most competitive soccer teams. The video has both serious drills as well as a lot of fun drills. We have used this video over the course of a 12 week 20 game season. Not only did we notice more shots on goal but out travel team improved to the best record in the league. All my players have seen this video and we all love it! The coaching staff attributes our scoring improvement to this program as well as the other great programs put out by the same producer. Among our favorites are CHAMPIONSHIP SOCCER DRILLS and
34 SOCCER GOALIE DRILLS.
This program, SOCCER SHOOTING DRILLS is highly recommended!",1243728000,,679,4.528455284552845
2503287,5,B000E6FVXG,This DVD delivers as advertised. It is very attractively put together and altogether well-done. I have bought other programs from this producer in other sports and everyone is worth the money paid! A clear explanation of each shooting drill is given. This is a great addition to anyone's resource library who coaches youth soccer. Parents who want to go out with their kids and practice will also find this beneficial. This is great value.,1242259200,,439,4.945945945945946

This was first lent to me by another soccer mom and I really liked it.
My son worked on the skills shown in the video and we have seen improvement.

this program was professionally put together with creative
drills plus excellent tips given by the voiceover.
I highly recommend this program for most youth
soccer programs as well as school teams!

8106834,1,B000E6FVXG,"I got this video for my 10 year old son thinking that it would show him some neat tips and tricks to improve his game, but it's basically a training video for coaches, and not a very good one at that. The voice over for the video is dated and very boring. The drills are also pretty basic and boring. Nothing really spectacular here. The whole video looks like it was shot in your neighborhood park, it's not very professional at all. I can't believe what they are charging for this video!! I paid 24.99 and am totally disappointed. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!",1262131200,3,559,4.384615384615385
8106835,4,B000E6FVXG,"What's the deal with soccer shooting? We don't take out a gun and fire at
that funny shaped sphere.  Why do they call it a shot when there is no Dr. or needle around?
Here's what SOCCER SHOOTING DRILLS is:

A compilation of drills directed at players giving them the best chance to be successful.
All in all this is a ""value added"" asset for soccer coaches like me. When I am
beating my brains out trying to organize our next practice, I'll turn on this
video and not only take a few drills for practice but create new ones from ideas seen.
There is a time for work and a time for fun in all soccer practices.
This program has both! What it may lack in perfect technique is made up
with credible fun skill drills.
This is one product that I have no trouble recommending.
