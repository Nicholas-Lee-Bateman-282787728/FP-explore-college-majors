2400737,5,B000B5XSTE,Absolutely fantastic.  I've been a licensed bicycle racer for 21 years.  I've never seen anything that gets into the hearts and minds (as well as the performance) of professional cyclists like this.,1153267200,6,198,5.15625
2400738,5,B000B5XSTE,"A very well done documentary.  Great camera work.  There are many good remarks made by Zabel, Ulle and Aldag.  It's a much diffrent perspective on the TDF and professional bicycle racing than one gets from watching OLN.  Even my mom liked it and she is not a cycling fan.",1141862400,5,271,4.469387755102041
2400739,5,B000B5XSTE,"I had just started cycling with some friends on one of those recreational tours when I got this DVD on a whim.  It is such an awesome experience to view what is going on behind the scenes that it really turned me on to cycling.  Even if you are not into cycling you will enjoy the humor and sacrifices of these riders.

And should you ever experience 'road rash' you will find instructions on how the pro's address these injuries. (But are you gutsy enough to do it???!!!! ;o)  )

Well worth watching if you have ANY interest into the Tour or cycling in general.",1141603200,8,562,4.314285714285714

2400741,5,B000B5XSTE,"This documentary, covering the T-Mobile team during the 2003 Tour de France, is a superb portrait of the life of a professional athlete. Erik Zabel is seen at the beginning of the downside of his  outstanding career as a sprinter, unable to beat the younger lions of the sport. The massage sessions after the race and the discussions during them are outstanding for their insight into the pysche of a cyclist competing at a world-class level. Rolf Aldag and other domestiques illustrate the motivational challenges faced by those that make a living racing bicycles out of the limelight of the Zabels, Armstrongs and Ullrichs, and physical toll it takes to compete in the most famous race in the world. Television coverage never really gives us the pictures that this film does-all of the nitty gritty details that go into racing, and surviving, in the Tour. Highly recommended.",1138752000,21,877,4.965986394557823

2400754,5,B000B5XSTE,".....you have to see this documentary.

With all of the media interest in doping and the Lance Armstrong scandal, this is worth a watch. We all know now that they were doping, but it doesn't make the race any less thrilling - particularly when you see it from the inside.",1379289600,,271,4.42
2400755,5,B000B5XSTE,"The DVD is the best I have seen, giving the true aspects of pro-cycling, without the hyperbole.  The drama, ennui, disasters and triumphs are all there in stark reality.  Authenticity is given by keeping the soundtrack in the native languages of French and German.  I have the good fortune to be able to speak French fluently and also Flemish which gives me a reasonable idea of what is happening in the German, but the sub-titles in English were a true translation if inevitably shortened for quick comprehension.  I raced professionally in Europe in the 50s when things were not so smooth as they are now but I can guarantee the reality is the same.  It would be a good thing for any aspiring young rider to see as he progresses through the levels of the sport.  Perhaps Amazon could draw attention to the fact that there are several books with the same title, one even about a branch of cycling.",1339718400,,898,4.58125
2400756,5,B000B5XSTE,"This is a must for any documentary fan or cyclist.

Even if I weren't a cyclist this would probably be one of my favorite documentaries. I'd always heard that the Tour de France was a grueling sporting event but didn't really think about the day-to-day struggles until watching this movie. The filmmakers did a great job of focusing on a few key riders from a specific team instead of just the big stars (Lance Armstrong, Jan Ulrich). Beyond documenting the Tour de France from the perspective of professional racers it gives an interesting glimpse into European culture as a fan and athlete.",1318291200,,592,4.803921568627451

2400759,4,B000B5XSTE,"Hell on Wheels is a docudrama about the Tour de France. It doesn't show the actual competion and the heroism. It's focussing about what real life for professional cyclists means. It appears that the profession is very tough and that ""le grand boucle"" completely wears you out. Also remarkable are all the fysical problems that can occur. Further the movie shows lots of ""behind the scenes"" shots from the mecaniciens and supporting personnel of the cyclists.
The quality of the photography is superb and also the quality of the surround sound. You actually hear al the noise that cycling generates and that you never will hear viewing the Tour de France stages. In this particular Tour Lance Armstrong takes the win, but that doesn't play an important role in the movie.
I really liked this movie and it's a must for all cyclist who enjoy watching cylcing.",1253145600,,856,4.829931972789115
2400760,5,B000B5XSTE,"This is one of the best cycling documentaries I have ever watched. A beautiful combination of great camerawork, a stunning setting, great soundtrack and engaging subjects. It goes beyond the highlight reel and goes into the day to day life and musings during the tour. It delves into the deep friendship between Erik Zabel (6 time green jersey winner) and one of his trusted helpers on the team, Rolf Aldag. The frankness, humility and emotion displayed by the racers is a welcome contrast to the typical journalists take from an interview that one would read on the mass media.

Good characters and wonderful race scenes round it out.",1214784000,,395,4.96969696969697
2400782,5,B000B5XSTE,"As cyclist and fan of cycling for most of my 50 odd years, I love this movie and have watched it many times, especially during the off season as the vivid sights and sounds remind me of how much I love the sport. My favorite scenes are in the mountain stages, like the nearly slow motion climb of a lone rider up a steep Alpe gradient against the score of a wailing electric guitar, the rider straining, sweat pouring down his pain-stricken expression -- oh how many times I've been there myself.

Great filming that you won't get in the usual televised race coverage, a terrific musical score, fascinating and surprisingly intimate behind the scenes views of the Telekom riders, the noisy marketing & support caravans, the cheering multitudes along the roadside and other eccentric fans, and especially the closeup cycling action make this a worthwhile addition to any cycling fan's collection.",1209686400,,895,4.8881578947368425

2400786,5,B000B5XSTE,This movie is a great view of the tour. It does not show Lance Armstrong or any of the big guns. It instead shows what life is like for the rest of the  riders that ride on the tour. I have seen many videos about the tour and this one is by far the best. You do have to read subtitles though. The buying of this movie is a good investment.,1201392000,,339,3.7746478873239435
2400787,3,B000B5XSTE,"As a novice cycling fan I was hoping for a little more explanation on what the tour de france is composed of, where  they were riding, how long the stages were, etcetera.  But it was more of a you-are-there documentary, with lots of the cyclists' thoughts on life and riding while getting massages (seriously, there's as much massaging in this movie as bike riding, I guess it's like that on the actual Tour!)

Too bad both the two main guys turned out to be dopers.  Oh well!  Seems like everyone does it at that levels.",1181692800,3,521,4.442105263157894

2400789,5,B000B5XSTE,"Lance Armstrong's unforgettable speech to the world press gathered on the eve of the 2003 Tour de France sets this mystical, magical masterpiece in motion.

""I show up prepared,"" says Armstrong, dead serious. ""I show up motivated and I show up because I love it and respect it and I want to do well. Nothing means more to me than to win this event.""

What follows is a sports documentary that is gorgeous and grandiose while at the same time gritty and down to earth.

This is cycling film that should be seen by anyone who considers himself a sports fan. It should be shown in phys. ed. and geography classes across America. This is the cycling film that would win the hearts and respect of a people who have never watched - nor cared to watch - a professional cycling race. And this is the cycling film that allows the cycling fan to forget the drug-accusation cloud hanging over professional cycling, and reminds us just how much there is to love about ""The Tour.""

Rather than interviewing the racers and filming every stage of their performance, director Danquart turns on the camera, places it in the team bus and motels, and the riders themselves tell their incredible story with class and wit. We see close up the pain and humanity of the great German sprinter, Eric Zabel. While he, and to a lesser degree, teammate Rolf Aldag and Team Telekom, are the key players, equally important are the cast of thousands and the wonderful countryside and small towns that make up the Tour. Though the stunning bird's eye views of the race are beautiful and essential to understand the Tour, much of the footage is shot at ground level, making you feel you're a fan in the crowd, or a medic leaning over a fallen rider, scraped and bloodied, or a photographer lying horizontal on the asphalt, next to scores of other photographers from around the world. You, literally, are there.

Sweetening this masterwork is plenty of excellent footage of the big stars. Lance, Jan Ulrich, Ivan Basso, and especially Tyler Hamilton (and the story behind his broken collarbone) are all seen in great action shots. We also are treated to rise of T-Mobile's Alexandre ""Vino"" Vinokourov, of Kazakstan (no relation whatsoever to Borat).

History lovers will appreciate intermittent black and white film archives of old races alongside the fresh images and the Tour lore as told by French journalist Serge Laget, who shows no less pride in the event and his country's role in it as would John Madden of NFL football, or Bob Costas of Major League Baseball.

Another remarkable feature of the film is the music, which is apparently (and incredibly) an original score. The cool, jazzy numbers and electric guitar solos are just incredible.

To describe any more of this film would be to rob the reader of all the unexpected treasures I discovered. I plan to watch it again and again. It's that good. (Plus I want to re-read those subtitles!).

You ought to see it. No--you have to see it.",1171065600,19,2964,4.717601547388782
2400800,3,B000B5XSTE,It was okay.  I was expecting more excitement and was a little disappointed.  I'm a biking fan and still enjoyed it.  I liked Overcoming a little bit more.,1169856000,4,155,4.464285714285714
2400801,5,B000B5XSTE,"I bought this DVD after seeing 'Hell on Wheels' in a local theatre. It offers a candid view into the workings of the Tour de France and you are left with a real sense of the passion that this tour engenders in teams, riders and the fans.

The focus is on the German Telekom team and Aldag and Zabel in particular. They are refreshingly open during the interviews, many during post ride massages or on the team bus. They make no attempt to hide their doubts and fears. During one Zabel, laments the bad day he had: only able to average 45 km/h! (I'd settle for that problem)

Camera work is excellent and the soundtrack great. It is in German with English sub-titles which doesn't lessen the viewing pleasure. So if you love cycling and or follow the tour then Hell on Wheels is a must buy, must view (many times) DVD",1168473600,3,816,4.3618421052631575
2400802,5,B000B5XSTE,"Its not often nowadays that we get a chance to see the Tour de France without complete focus on the exploits of Lance Armstrong, rider extraordinaire, triathlete, marathoner, etc. etc.  While I respect and admire Armstrong's accomplishments as much as the next fan, this movie isn't about Lance.

Likewise, its not about Phil and Paul and their increasingly tiresome OLN coverage.

So what is Hell on Wheels all about?  Its a German film (yes, in German but with clearly visible English subtitles) that follows the Telekom boys during the 2003 Tour de France, an epic battle between the fore-mentioned Lance and Jan Ullrich (who incidentally rode for Bianchi that year).  Lance and Jan appear frequently but not as principal characters.  Tyler Hamilton (who rode the entire race with a broken collarbone) and Andreas Kloden (who rode a few stages with a broken coxyx also figure as side characters.  The primary characters are Rolf Aldag, Erik Zabel (roomates) and their masseuse/assistant Eule, a grizzled old guy who looks like he's seen his share of riders come and go.  In between race footage, we hear from an older gentleman who appears to have spent a little too much time in the Tour archives as he narrates great black and white footage from the very first years.  Although he's a little out there, he lends a French flair to the film.

In between exhilarating takes on the TdF stages, from beginning to end, we see the riders recovering, musing the day's performance, and suffering the fallout of daily crashes, mountain stages, etc.  We often hear Erik and Rolf talking over the race as Eule works out the kinks on the massage table.  Zabel in particular is in for some soul searching as he just can't seem to come up with that sprint win.  Aldag takes the mountain jersey, but the next day cracks, showing us just how fleeting victory can be in the TdF - and how phenomenal the winners really are.  Be prepared for stunning footage of the mountain stages where we see just how tough these stages and bikers can be.

Camera work is magnificent - integrating fixed television-style feed with hand-held shots that give the viewer perspectives we never get on OLN or any other TV coverage.  My favorite scene is in the Alps when Armstrong, Ullrich, and Mayo flash by at arm's length - showing how incredibly fast these riders go up mountain passes.

While non cyclists may or may not enjoy the drama of the Tour, cyclists will definitely groove on the racing footage.  The euro-pop sound track with plenty of solid bass sounds great and the Dolby surround is all class.  I've watched the video as a movie and used it while on the trainer - either way its a great buy!  Gte it for yourself or for your favorite cyclist - they'll love it!",1168473600,6,2744,4.700836820083682
2400803,4,B000B5XSTE,"First, what this film is NOT:  it is NOT a documentary of the 2003 Tour-de-France, even though that is where all the action takes place.  When the film is over, you won't even know - unless you already knew - that the race was won by Lance Armstrong, nor will you know who finished second and third, or who won most of the stages.  The film does not follow the normal storyline of a race documentary.

What, then, DOES it do?  It gives an inside look at what it feels like to be a professional cyclist racing in the Tour-de-France, as seen through the eyes of the German Telekom team (now renamed T-Mobile.)  Focusing largely on veteran riders Eric Zabel, Rolf Aldag (since retired), and Andreas Kloden, we get behind the scenes to see what life is really like in big-time cycling.  And what we see is a world simultaneously more beautiful, graceful, painful, and smelly than what we see on regular television coverage of the Tour.

""Hell on wheels,"" indeed, for we see the sweat rolling from the riders' faces, the stress, the injuries, the almost military regimen of a virtually all-male world.

We see the rubdowns, the shaving of legs, the plastering of buttocks with anti-rash gel, the injection of (legal) vitamins and supplements, the urination by the side of the road.  We see the dirty side of the sport.

But we also see the grace, and we feel the danger.  We see the cyclists at speed, and we feel it.  Most television coverage of the Tour is taken from vehicles moving at the same speed as the cyclists, so the sense of speed and danger is often lost.  This film captures those elements.

And we also see the roadside spectacle, the picnics, the parties, the campers, the police, the traveling Tour caravan, the circus elements of the Tour, which are often noted only in passing in television accounts of the race.

Those who expected this to be an objective re-telling of the 2003 Tour were undoubtedly disappointed. But I disagree with those reviewers who said this film would be unintelligible to those who are not racing fans.  On the contrary, I think this would be an excellent introduction to the sport for non-fans. Focusing on the inner nature of the sport, rather than on the results of a particular race, it is an excellent introduction indeed.",1168473600,66,2267,4.641604010025063
2400804,2,B000B5XSTE,"I didn't realize that this movie is basically all in German with english subtitles. Second, it is mostly about Erik Zabel. Yes, the scenary is nice and the music is good, but I wouldn't buy it again nor would i watch it again.",1168300800,2,226,4.27906976744186
2400805,4,B000B5XSTE,"This is a great movie. There is no greater heartbreak than watching a team of young, talented riders fall prey to accidents and their own self doubt as they reveal the heart of the world's most well know endurance race. this documentary is nt about winning, but about competing and how challenging it is to go up against the best in the world.

Beautifully filmed, you get a real sense of being in france during the tour and living the experience through the eyes of cyclists that are real, identifiable humans.

i recommend this to any avid cyclist.",1167868800,,550,4.6020408163265305
2400806,4,B000B5XSTE,"Knowledgeable fans of bicycle racing will enjoy the great footage and this behind-the-scenes look at the German Telekom (now T-Mobile) team in the 2003 Tour De France. However, the lack of narration in this documentary makes it hard for me to give it five stars. It's not that there was too little narration. There is none whatsoever, and very little dialog to keep you informed about what you're watching. I've been following professional cycling since 1984, so I don't need someone to tell me who Eric Zabel is, what the polka dotted jersey means, or how teamwork plays a role in stage racing, but I still thought this film could have been enhanced with at least some minimal narration, if done properly. An option on the DVD of having a soundtrack with the director's comments would have been a great enhancement. The film consists of many interesting bits: Telekom riders (Mostly Zabel) speaking to someone off-camera in German (with English subtitles), segments of an unnamed Tour historian speaking passionately about the history of the Tour, a great deal of footage of the race itself, and multiple scenes of the team's soigner massaging the riders, rubbing chamois cream in their shorts, and providing encouragement to them when they're discouraged. Occasionally the soigner speaks to the camera, but we never learn his name until the closing credits. Actually, we're never told who most of these people are, or what is happening in the race results. Bike racing fans will know these things, but the film expects an unusually high level of knowledge from its audience. There are a couple of interviews (again, with subtitles) of unidentified riders from other teams, but they weren't major stars I'd recognize like Hamilton, Beloki, Mayo and others.  The film focuses mostly on the riders' comments about their careers, the sport itself, and their relationships with their teammates. We're never told what stage it is, or what the results are at that point, as if the race itself had no importance. Nothing is mentioned about the very significant fact that Zabel was competing for the green (sprinter's) jersey, or fact that he had won it before. One of the biggest stories of the race was the fact that, after being kicked off the team the year before, and coming back on a lesser squad, Jan Ullrich (a former Tour de France winner for Telekom) was having a great comeback and was threatening Lance Armstrong for the overall. This story, and many of the other fascinating stories of that Tour, is never described to the viewer. In one especially frustrating segment, we follow Alexandre Vinokourov through part of a time trial. We hear the announcer at the finish line state that Ullrich had the best time so far, with Armstrong in second and at that point we wait for Vinokourov to finish to find out the final results. After the race, we hear somebody off camera congratulate him, but we're never told where he ended up in the stage that day. He finished third incidentally, but I didn't get that information from the film. This documentary could have really had some mass appeal to a much wider audience, if only they'd made the effort to provide a voice-over filling in the blanks. As it is, bike racing fans will like it, but those who don't know anything about the sport may have a hard time paying attention through the whole thing. The lack of narration has certain advantages, however. It is more of a fly-on-the-wall perspective, as if you're traveling with the team and you're witnessing events as they occur and left to your own knowledge to interpret the significance of what's happening. For that reason, it's a good film to watch with your bike racing buddies. Finally, compared with the OLN coverage we're used to in the U.S., it can be refreshing NOT to hear Phil and Paul fill every available space of silence with their constant excitable chatter (and over-used self-invented clichs) while watching a bike race. Fans of this film will also enjoy ""Overcoming"", a 2005 film about the CSC team.",1165708800,3,4019,4.858600583090379
2400807,5,B000B5XSTE,"This is a ""must have"" for every endurance sport fan, it goes to te heart and soul of the racers, incredible photography, images, sound and content.

It is the only film that really shows what it mean to compete in the Tour de France from inside the great T-Mobile Squad. Erik Zabel and Rolf Aldbarg are interviewed and filmed in there rooms and right after they finshed every day. They show sensibility and greatness, suffering, doubts, they are Humans!!

2400808,5,B000B5XSTE,"I purchased this DVD a few months ago and have watched it several times.  It's an amazingly candid look at the workings of the tour and shows what a grueling and dangerous challenge it is for the athletes.  The inside view you get is of the spectators out on the various mountain slopes and in the cities partying, watching the advertising cars go by, and patiently waiting for the tour to quickly zip by.  You also get a glimpse of the set-up and take-down that occurs each day at the start and finish lines, including the amazing array of telecommunications equipment.

The main focus of the DVD is the T-Mobile team.  This is the year Ulrich rode for Bianchi but the team does include Vinokourov, Kloden, Zabel, and Aldag.  There is some beautiful cinematography matched with a great soundtrack showing many of the stages.  Stock footage is also incorporated to show some of the tremendous crashes that occurred that year.  Even within the T-Mobile team, most of the time is spent with Zabel and Aldag.  I was surprised at how open they were in the interviews.  Many of the interviews are in their hotel room during their after-ride massages or in the bus at the finish line.  Zabel had a tough time that year and doesn't attempt to hide his doubt and disappointment.

I've passed this among my cycling buddies, some of which have been to the tour and they've all had rave reviews.  It's been a very motivational DVD for me.",1159315200,4,1427,4.615079365079365

You must pay attention to catch all the layers of what these athletes, coaches, trainers and fans have to share along the ride.  Very insightful and motivating as well if you are on your indoor bicycle trainer!  Highly recommended.",1430092800,,608,4.798076923076923

I love watching the T-Mobile (FKA Telekom) scenes - everything from post-race recaps in the athletes' hotel rooms, to their meals, pre-race shaving and post-race massages. I loved the race action too: domestiques refilling bottles, crashes and the high energy team trials.

I followed the Tour de France 2014 and it was neat to see the spectator perspective - everyone waiting hours and hours to see the athletes whiz by in seconds. Like they said, ""What other sport is so noble - the athletes come to the spectator and for free!""

I really liked the historical scenes too - cyclists riding w tires strapped across their chests and on dirt roads w minimal assistance.

This film is a wonderful comprehensive perspective of the Tour and reminds me of the grit and grace that is the core of cycling/why I love riding so much. I hope more people watch this and more films like this are made so as to repair the unfair, tarnished reputation cycling has received in past years.",1421452800,,1208,4.878048780487805
8081898,5,B000B5XSTE,"Great film with excellent personalities. Judging that period of cycling by current values is folly, as the era was rife with doping. No matter, it is all history from which we can learn now and this is an excellent look inside of a pro team. The interaction between Aldag and Zabel is highly enjoyable. The film is well shot and includes any number of panning, scenic shots that have me thinking, ""I need to ride there...""",1420329600,,422,4.565789473684211
