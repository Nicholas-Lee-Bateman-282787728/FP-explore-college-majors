8034683,3,B0002Y5M16,"Not to be confused with the entirely unrelated Vin Diesel vehicle from a half-century later, Roger Corman's production of ""The Fast and the Furious"" from 1954 stars John Ireland and Dorothy Malone, with a large cast of supporting players like Snub Pollard and Bruno VeSota, who you may remember from a wide variety of roles including ""Kojak,"" ""The Wild Wild World of Batwoman,"" ""Attack of the Giant Leeches,"" and even ""Leave it to Beaver."" While VeSota does fine, the low point for acting has to be the opening scenes in the restaurant anytime waitress Wilma (Iris Adrian) opens her mouth: her voice may be the most grating I have ever heard. Ireland and Malone do reasonably well with their parts, although the script is frequently implausible and extremely melodramatic.

The film has lots of typical 50s action ploys: the radio announcement providing the background, the hero wrongly accused of murder who gets a wealthy woman with lots of money and a Jaguar to fall for him, loads of terrible dialogue delivered with hypersincerity, etc. While the plot meanders around Ireland's fight for justice and flight to Mexico, the story strains all possible credibility with the pretense that the police know where the murderer is, they know he's driving a Jaguar, but he's seen all over the place in a Jaguar and he is never caught by their clever detective methodology. The ""I love you-I hate you"" romantic story of kidnapping, fleeing from police, and hilarious driving tutelage are somewhat improbable at their most likely, and detract from the film substantially. Head-scratching plotpoints abound: my favorite is when Ireland locks Malone in a shed while he flees to Mexico. Mind you this shack is in the middle of nowhere, so how does she escape? She sets fire to it from the inside, expecting someone to free her. In what way does that possibly make sense? It doesn't of course, except that this is a Roger Corman production from 1954.

The film concludes in the most over-the-top way imaginable, though I doubt anyone will be tremendously surprised. Will Malone make Ireland an honest man? You'll have to watch to find out! I am a Corman fan, but this is one of his more middling projects, perhaps because he was more involved as a producer and writer (""From a story by Roger Corman"") while letting John Ireland and Edward Sampson share directorial duties. It's not a wholly unenjoyable experience, but don't plan on any groundbreaking drama, it's really all about the cars.",1345507200,2,2479,4.914081145584726

The movie begins with a speeding truck that misses a turn and rolls over in a crash. Next we see sports cars racing along a country road. One car pulls into a caf for a meal. The waitress complains about taxes. One customer pays and is questioned about a ride. There is action, and this driver falls to the floor. This stranger acts to drive the woman's sport car south. ""Going someplace?"" ""He don't seem like the Jaguar type."" The Nash police car arrives at that caf, they get eyewitness identification. Frank Webster talks to his passenger. Frank will drive over the mountains to avoid the police. Frank knows how to start a car. Connie wants to be let alone. The car coasts down the hill. They pass the inspection on the road and proceed to the racing grounds.

Their car qualifies. The police are still searching for an unknown man. Can they find a house to hide in? Frank explains his past, and frame-up in that truck accident. They talk to the caretaker and leave. Some old cars race around the track. There is a Concours d'Elegance first. ""You don't look like a sports car man."" They go for a walk in the dark. ""Exercise is good for your figure."" Can Connie escape from that shed? [Burning down a locked shed is not a good escape method!] The race begins. Connie borrows another car. There is action from the car race. Frank stops to help Favor. He has made a new decision. [Or was it the Production Code?]

This is a low-budget production but not a bad story. It tells about the new motor sport of sports car racing in southern California. This is different from the other hot-rod movies of that era.",1301097600,,1645,4.458471760797342
8034685,4,B0002Y5M16,"Great old B&W movie for those who like old sports cars, especially Jags of the XK-120 vintage.  Good footage of races with Jaguars, Triumphs, MG TDs, Austin Healeys, Allards, and even a Nash-Healy.",1294531200,,197,4.96969696969697
8034686,4,B0002Y5M16,"Okay, so sometimes you think a Roger Corman production is generally a sign of cheesy or just plain weird. Well, in the case of this film, we actually have some quality actors and some generally well written dialogue.

Yes, there are improbable situations, but remember, it's Roger Corman. Yet, in watching this film, I found myself actually enjoying the interplay between Dorothy Malone and John Ireland, both of whom are very good actors. Yes, there was some groan moments. And the story is predictable. But that's not always a bad thing.

John Ireland co-directed, which is why he's involved (Corman couldn't afford his fees otherwise!). And the direction is quite good for this kind of film. I also felt some of the dialogue was fairly natural, too.

Hey, just forget the intellectual and sit back and enjoy the film. No bad language, a little suggestive commentary, a few good zingers, too (one by the announcer at the race that was quite amusing). It isn't all that long and it has some nice race footage, given the budget.",1291334400,3,1028,4.796610169491525
