8395232,5,B003E22XTW,Original way to amp up the treadmill workout.  I like it very much.  I would recommend it to people comfortable with using a treadmill and in pretty good shape.,1366156800,,160,4.482758620689655
8395233,3,B003E22XTW,"I tried this Video out and to be honest it was a little boring to me. I didn't find walking in place the thing for me. It's not a bad thing, it was just not for me.",1353628800,,164,3.4594594594594597
8395234,5,B003E22XTW,"This workout is better than her previous Walking Strong.  She has a person doing many different levels on the floor and step, just in case you don't have a treadmill or don't feel like using one.  You basically can control how hard you want your workout to be.  There is absolutely no dread factor in this workout.  You have Tracey and her sister on treadmills working at different levels and you have another person working without the treadmill, instead using the floor/step.",1309737600,,477,4.780487804878049
