8279684,5,B001AU0BNA,"This is  a great instructional video. Gary Semics knows what he is doing (look at his clients). I watched this video on a Friday night. The following Saturday morning I followed each step and was clearing every double on the track... even the whip on a few of them.

Shipping was outstanding! The standard shipping from Gary Semics is MUCH faster than the 2 day shipping from everyone else on Amazon.

Thanks Gary!
Also thanks for the decals included in the package.",1359331200,,466,4.658536585365853
