8097645,2,B000CCW2R0,"I purchased the movie to show it to my students in a Spanish 202 class , but I was not able to do so. The plot is almost impossible to follow, and  there is nudity, sex, use of illegal substances, sex between a woman in her 30's and a young man between 16 and 17, and vulgarity. It may be OK to watch at home, if you like this type of movie, but it is not suitable as a teaching tool.",1457049600,,384,3.740740740740741
8097646,4,B000CCW2R0,"New Chile-new topics.

A movie of teens is rather descriptive than convincing when young adult two pairs were of different, quite various national, social and financial backgrounds.

This story is emphasized on a Jewish-Chilean sixteen year old handsome boy grown up half a life in the States and other half a life in Chile intimately entertaining a beautiful aunty-in-law hired by his busy, always absent mother-businesswoman. He is a center of a teen company smoking grass, fooling, riding car and, probably, somehow complementing his sexual experience.

It might be watched for some country approach as it is presented by local movie-makers.",1299196800,,644,5.356435643564357
8097647,1,B000CCW2R0,"The chilean movie industry has been pretty generous since democracy came back to the country in the 90's. You can actually see it bloom. Take for example the production gap between movies as Johnny 100 pesos from 1994 (am i right?) and the award winner Machuca (2004). Both movies are good, but there is a gap, a good one.
But Te amo made in Chile is like a black hole to the chilean movie industry.  I'm just unable to explain how bad it is. The plot has no reason to be and it was recorded as a reality show with a handycam.
If you want to watch a bad movie, watch this one.",1185408000,,576,4.097345132743363
