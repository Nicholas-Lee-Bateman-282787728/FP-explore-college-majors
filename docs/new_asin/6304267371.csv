7865862,4,6304267371,"This video features 5 of my favourite stand ups all in the one video Janeane Garofalo (the Truth About cats and dogs), Bobcat Goldthwait (One Crazy Summer), Julia Sweeney (SNL), Andy Dick (news Radio) and Mr Show's Bob Odenkirk! How can you go wrong, it's like a Ben Stiller show reunion (only Ben wasn't invited). Garofalo isn't in it much she is the host and pretty much just introduces the others... however works a few jokes in and helps make this fun easy to watch video.",1011744000,3,476,4.546511627906977
