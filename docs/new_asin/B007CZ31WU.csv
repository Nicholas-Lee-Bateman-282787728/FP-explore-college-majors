8514796,4,B007CZ31WU,"I thought I was buying American Horror Story Freak Show, and ordered this one mistake, so I was very surprised when I got an animated film. I watched it and it is great. I really enjoyed the dry humor, satire, and the characters. It is really good! I didn't know there were two different  television series called Freak Show. This one is not the American Horror Story Freak Show, it is a cartoon, but some of the characters are similar, so I wonder if one is a take off on the other or if that is coincidence. If you like animation, you will really enjoy this.",1433462400,,560,4.283018867924528
