3013618,1,B000Y7ZBZS,"The audacity FOX has to put this item up for sale is breathtaking. Quick! What's the fastest way to piss away $39? Purchase the Season Seven DVD set of 24, which you'll never receive in the mail until FALL 2009! That's right Grandma/Wife/Mother, the young man in your life is currently awaiting Season Seven on the TV, which will begin JANUARY 2009. There are no time machines available that can provide the complete season on DVD for an early release!",1228089600,15,452,4.6625
3013619,1,B000Y7ZBZS,"The only reason this product is ""available"" for pre-order one year in advance is so some unwitting grandmother can ""buy"" it for her favorite grandson (because Amazon ""will deliver it to you when it arrives""). In other words, 20th Century Fox is desperate for revenue this season and is steeping pretty damn low to get it.

Sadly, the fact that 38 percent of the people who view this item actually purchase it demonstrates that this ploy is working. I'm not sure which is worse---that people actually fall for it, or that Fox is taking advantage of their naivete. Shameful.",1227916800,14,572,4.777777777777778
3013620,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"I see his name in the credits for season 7.  I assume it's only a flashback cameo since Pres. Palmer is dead, or so we think. That's what we thought about Tony too.",1227484800,4,164,3.9696969696969697
3013621,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"I just want to say that I am really looking forward (It's been only 20 months) to the new season of 24.  Jack seems to have a new and pure focus, and this time it will not be hampered by a plethora of relatives.  ""Hey guys at 24!

3013645,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"For serious 24 fans - I think many of them will cherish Season 7. It was the season that featured some of the best acting and writing ever. Season 1 comes close and my personal favorite is Season 4 (the intro of Jack-Audrey relationship) but this Season has sustained brilliance. The 'Dubaku-Juma' connect, Juma breaking into White House (as outlandish as it sounds, it was executed nicely), Jack-Renee chemistry, everything was handled amazingly. 24 lives with me forever! Thanks to Amazon Prime, I can revisit 24 as many times as I want, and I am currently on probably a '7th or 8th're-run of all seasons.",1498608000,,607,4.79047619047619

3013647,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"Many things have been written about this season. I would like to commend some of the villains, most notably Colonel Ike Dubaku and General Juma. These two dictatorial die hards spice up the mix, with some great acting to boot. The president's daughter Olivia was played with an evil flair by Sprague Grayden. Jon Voight came in strong as the charming, witty and mischievous (though homicidal) Jonas Hodges. Yes, Jack saves the day, and takes a licking but keeps on ticking. People complain about believability. THIS IS '24!' It's always been part cartoon anyway. these reviewers need to go back to their online film studies. Kick back and let Jack do his job, that's all.",1496534400,3,671,4.843478260869565

She was so obnoxious, her self righteous crusade against enhanced interrogation and she cared more about foreigners than keeping Americans safe.

3013702,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"The Fox Network series entitled ""24"" is a post-9/11 counter-terrorism television program, which premiered in November, 2001, just two months after the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001. This seventh season examines another 24-hour time period in the hectic life of Federal Agent Jack Bauer, originally from the Los Angeles branch of the Counter-Terrorism Unit, known as the CTU, as he battles frantically to thwart yet another diabolical conspiracy. The novel structure of this groundbreaking television series involves each episode representing a single hour in this very action-packed and challenging day. The character of Agent Jack Bauer is portrayed perfectly by actor Kiefer Sutherland, who plays an old-fashioned tough guy, who utilizes any means necessary to vanquish the forces of evil. Of course, the rather aggressive and sometimes brutal methods of Agent Bauer often blur the distinction between good and evil. This seventh season of ""24"" continues to be decidedly intelligent, fast-paced, and suspenseful, and it is a superb combination of the political thriller and action/adventure genres. Its use of real-time plot development, and the innovative split-screen technique, are absolutely brilliant. The riveting intrigue and captivating plot twists keep the viewer totally enthralled, because one never really knows who can be trusted. This outstanding Counter-Terrorism series ""24"" is truly my all-time favorite television program, and I enthusiastically give its seventh season a five-star rating, along with my very highest recommendation!",1486252800,5,1576,5.797413793103448

Certain aspects of this series can become predictable (the ""mole"", ""it's not over"", etc.), but that is part of the fun.  If you haven't watched ""24"" from the beginning, there are characters and some references to previous ""days"" that you wouldn't understand.  The movie ""24:Redemption"" is a prequel to this season so it would help to have seen the movie.",1485475200,,460,4.6419753086419755
3013774,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"This show doesn't need kudos.  It's in that separate domain where things can only be imitated, (or ""re-done"") years later, at best.
As times change rapidly, we will as a species (if we survive our own cunning) need art of this quality that reflects the wide bandwidth of a perhaps unlimited human capacity for invention, diversion, cruelty, and love.

Not to worry... because Episode 3 throttles the action into what you have come to appreciate from this franchise.  The writers did a very nice job of introducing some new characters in Season 7 and at times it gets a little ""crowded"" but overall, this is another great story, just as good as Seasons 1-6.",1483920000,,417,4.3896103896103895

Wonderful writing, great plot, same vibrant acting as usual, and you do not get to know everything until the very last minute. THANK YOU GUYS! I LOVE BAUER AND LOVE 24!!!! Now watching season 8.
BTW, watch the movie before Season 7, it is also available on Amazon Prime for FREE. it is called Redemption. It is not that good, but you ave to watch it after season 6 before season 7 because it is related!

3014292,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"Always exciting, but this season was a bit overdone in terms of Bauer's abilities to withstand the physical damages he sustains throughout the 24 hr period.  Each season has it's aspects of total unbelievability, but the plot is so strong that one is persuaded to overlook the ridiculously impossible stamina and strength of Jack Bauer.  He miraculously recovers in a matter of minutes from broken ribs, terminal diseases, helicopter crashes,hand-to-hand fights-to-the-death, and more.  Oh well.  It's still a great series and always a good story line in each season.  What I liked best about season 7 was there was finally somebody working in the White House with integrity and honor, namely Chief of Staff Kinan.  And of course, one of my favorites, Agent Aaron Pierce.",1478304000,3,771,5.128

Abigail change and a big let down. No more CRU character interplay. Now we just have Jack with a boring FBI. No interplay, cliched script, and faceless actors. The FBI as opposed to professional CTU group function as bunch of dummies and Jack has to work with these morons. They are out of Jack's league and can't keep up with him much less do anything right. I just found this season absolutely boring and formulated and could not see more than episode at a sitting unlike the previous seasons where I could not stop watching.

In this story line, once again our government is saturated at the highest levels with corruption and secret agendas; and the extreme violence which is seemingly required to save the day, even to the point of convincing a good female LEO that violent acts or even threatening such acts on a woman and her infant is necessary. People say that this is only a fictional story, but these concepts DO have an effect on people, and as any propaganda [or advertising] expert knows, even the most outlandish and unthinkable actions become a little less strange and a little less unacceptable with each viewing.

3015064,1,B000Y7ZBZS,"Writers just couldn't refrain from preaching their political and moral beliefs any longer. As long as the scripts were of tongue-in-cheek, action hero genre, the episodes were entertaining, if flawed. But with season 7, the writers had to equip everyone with super-automatic, ammunition spraying sub-machine guns, that seemed to fire endless rounds without actually hitting anything. Oh, and the seventh season was filmed in late 2007, when Hillary Clinton was trying to run for President of the U.S. So, who is President in season 7? A Hillary Clinton look-alike. To make matters worse, her Chief of Staff just has to tell her that she is a ""great lady"". C'mon, really? (btw, I'm an Independent, Democrat-leaning voter, but I just can't stand for Hollywood to think they can tell me for whom I should vote)",1464998400,,807,5.029850746268656

A story of success , but at a high price for many of the characters, along with the dedication from a rare breed of person, often serving behind the scene most would witness or realize.
In light of all acqusations and blame, again Jack B., gets it done, by doing what is needed.  Just by the scene several times, where Jack needed to remove his shirt, shows the pain he suffered for his country through the years.",1457222400,,506,4.489130434782608

3015365,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"Another season of surprising twists and intrigue. At first I was disappointed that CTU had been dismantled but it brought a whole new story line to follow. However, the constant ""in your face"" about Jack Bauer's methods of doing whatever needed to get the job done was overstated -- the criminals know they don't have to play by the same rules as law enforcement agencies and the criminals know it. The ""bad guys"" always bring automatic weapons to the fight while the ""good guys"" only get hand guns! But..... another great season!

3015795,2,B000Y7ZBZS,"This season was really very farfetched and unrealistic.  It is one thing to believe that a pro like Jack can do all that he has shown that he can do, but the things he is able to accomplish in this episode are beyond human ability so it really forces the tv watcher to stretch to their mind to the point of disbelief.  Then they top that off with having a female president who actually sticks to the US policy of not giving into terrorists even if it means sacrificing US citizens and her all male entourage gives her nothing but flack.  Gosh what a shocking surprise there!!!  Previous presidents have not given in to terrorists and had the support of their male entourage, but not the female president.  Got to love the irony there!  Finally we top the whole thing off with the ridiculousness of the last hour and the many unanswered questions.  Were they deciding if they were going to do a season 8?  Let Jack die if they aren't.  Save him if they do it.  How stupid do they really think we are as viewers?!",1438214400,,1011,4.358288770053476

From her annoying denture-speak (sorry, I know that's a personal attack on the actress which is really wrong!) to her hand-wringing to her just being a jackass... Ugh, so annoying. And Season 8 only solidifies my dislike of her. Also, her daughter is a total biatch! I guess they chose well since both of those characters elicited a strong response from me and hubby! Every time the daughter or Mme. President was on the screen I wanted to shut my eyes and ears. By the end of Season 7 I was saying ""and I did it all with Polydent"" every time the president spoke lol. I'm sure I was obnoxious but hubby laughed 'cause he lubs me. :)",1432598400,2,739,4.401459854014599

3015969,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"24 is very consistent, moving their stories along from season to season. They tend to revolve around plots to kill the President, terrorist plots to bomb American cities and various nefarious plots to scare the hell out of the slightly paranoid viewer. It seems to have been originally inspired by the events of 9/11 and they recycle all the drama of ferreting out the bad guys, but always on American soil. They were prescient in having a black president in the first season and a woman president later, along with a neurotic and compromised president (not unlike Nixon).

3016126,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"I came very late into the ""24"" game, but I must say this series keeps you at the edge of your seat. In addition, I do believe Jack Bauer is one of my favorite TV characters of all time. I've watched most of the series on Amazon Prime. The only thing missing is the prequel to (I believe) Season 6, I think that has to be gotten on the DVD (but I could be wrong). Interesting show, and changed my opinion of Kiefer Sutherland as an actor. He brings great depth to the character. Ok, so I have a little crush ;) Enjoy!!!",1425081600,,518,4.038834951456311

But.....The redundant plot lines are the only reason I don't give it 5 stars. I mean how many times is Kim bower used to leverage Jack, how many times has he been taken hostage and seriously if there are that many moles in CTU, the FBI, whitehouse etc. someone should call an exterminator! And why not change the  ""24"" to ""Rouge Agent Jack Bauer"" since he goes rouge at least once a season if not more.

3016172,3,B000Y7ZBZS,"* Great action, edge-of-seat suspense, complex characters and some good acting.
* Lousy ethic (the ""greatest good for the greatest number"" ethic that dominates this series would eliminate care for the weak and disabled because of low productivity and cost).
* Incredible ignorance of religious faith. A Muslim cleric joins Jack in ""forgiving ourselves"" for their own wrongs--a foreign concept to Islam (not big on forgiveness), or either Christianity or Judaism (God is our judge and He alone can forgive us--not we ourselves).
Way too many traitors and not enough true, dependable heroes.",1423353600,,589,5.344086021505376

When we went to watch season 7, however, the last disc was identical to the disc before it, so we weren't able to watch the last part of the season. And since my wife and I were still working at the time, and had other commitments, we weren't able to watch enough episodes to be able to realize the problem before the 30-day return period, so we were unable to send it back.

It's almost like the perfect perfect storm of bad things all culminating in a 24 hour period - which makes the story line a bit hard to follow/believe.  The previous seasons were, in a fantasy world, at least believable.  This season makes every government entity corrupt (ok, that's believable) and absolute bafoons (ok, that's believable too).",1415059200,,503,4.813953488372093

3016386,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"For the 'conspiracy theorist' and 'truthers' 24 comes an astonishing perception of what's going on, or what could be going on in this post 9/11 world.  It is engaging, thought provoking, and action-packed television with a high classed quality of production (it just looks so good on screen like a movie) and situation after situation is seamless.  At present I'm going through all seasons for the third time.  Fans of 'The Shield' will enjoy this series.  It's wild.

24 has shock value.  Jack has shock value.  This show has a way of making you think ""...did Jack really just do that?""

If you have a taste for espionage, terrorists/counter terrorism, corrupt politicians, geo-politics, and great actors/action/production- then this show is for you.  It would be a comfort to know there is a real Jack Bauer out there.",1411689600,,820,4.927007299270073

3016408,5,B000Y7ZBZS,I have definitely developed an addiction with this particular series! Season 7 is preparatory to season 8 which when I completed season 8 I was quite sad since there was no season 9.all the seasons some extent are interconnected with each other and are the continuing evolvement of Jack Bauer and his immediate circle of friends and family . it's ironic that jack is so intimately bound with what he does and actually and then fortunately cannot escape from it. theoretically speaking the series could go on indefinitely! Because of the karma the Jack Bauer creates attempt to make right on everything that is wrong he creates continual enemies on all fronts but ultimately he's getting older and older and so at some point would either have to die or become a mentor to someone who would take his place that possesses the same qualities. so to sum it up yes I thoroughly enjoyed season 7 and the conclusive season 8,1410480000,,916,4.695652173913044

3016427,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"First, suspend disbelief:  characters get dirty and clean again without taking showers, no one needs to eat pee or poop, everything Jack needs is in his man-purse, wounds heal and are forgotten about within 10 minutes or so, crises happen sequentially rather than simultaneously, the good guys never run out of ammunition, all lawyers disregard the trail of murders, and on and on and on.

Having said all that, this is a tremendously fun series for people who like non stop shoot-em-up action with just enough plot to tie scenes together and just enough side stories to give needed breaks from the gunfire and explosions.  Better than most action movies because once the premise is in place, we can just get down to the good stuff: barely-plausible non-stop violence, with no goofy humor attempted.  It works well for binge watching.  Just ask yourself, ""What would Jack Bauer do?""",1409788800,,882,4.9324324324324325

3016639,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"Who could have imagined that Body Snatcher Extraordinaire Donald Sutherland would sire the Second Most Interesting Man in the World - Jack Bauer.  I just started watching 24 about 3 months ago, I had no idea this show existed since 2002.  I have watched all the way through season 7, and just started season 8.  Once you start watching an episode it's very hard not to start watching the next episode, everything is nail biting and the episodes keep you at the edge of your seat.  Season 7 makes Jack appear to be the good guy, then the bad guy, then the good guy and so forth.  When he's perceived to be the bad the bad guy your adrenaline is flowing, you want to yell at the TV and let them know Jack is out there to help.  He has no regard for his life or how he's perceived.  He will do anything and everything to save the day.  As in previous seasons the threat is either biological or nuclear, in this season it's biological.  As always Jack has a direct line to the president, and every president in every season is under threat of being killed by terrorists.  In this season Jack takes a by-the-book female FBI agent and converts her to the Most Interesting Female in the World.  She gets it, you must severely torture the bad guys, bring 'em to the edge of death to get them to talk.  And sometimes you have to severely threaten the good families of the bad guys to get the bad guys to talk.  She turns into a Monster and can't stand herself, yet she realizes someone has to take this approach.  There are some great cheese factors in this show...I love how everyone, good guys and bad guys alike, says ""JACK BAUER???"", it's either in the context of amazement, disgust, fear, or an array of other emotions.  Does anyone know how many times Jack says ""Copy That""  ?  What about all those stolen cars, ripping the wires from underneath the steering wheel and starting the car - this is ultimate cheese.  Chloe is one of the few characters who survived every season, I don't think she's ever smiled, she can still figure out every computer issue and computer attack.  She has maintained that look of disgust to her fellow man-kind, except Jack of course, and continues to have no problem telling people how it is.  I love the office politics too.  Sit back, prepare your emotions, grab some beers, and watch the ultimate Stud Jack Bauer save the Planet for the 7th day...stay thirsty my friends!",1404432000,,2401,4.4610091743119265

3016650,2,B000Y7ZBZS,"This show would be completely awesome if it weren't so stupid.

Here's what happens in every season:

Bad stuff happens, Jack goes to extraordinary lengths to save the USA and beat the bad guys. Then the government gets mad at him for [fill in the blank]. He's never recognized as a hero, but instead ostracized, hunted, indicted, arrested, jailed, maligned, disrespected. And then he saves the world again. Really? Ok maybe for one season sure. Maybe for two. But every single season he's the outsider-turn-hero-yet-again.

If Jack does return beyond the current 1/2 24 series, I hope the writers stop being so cliche and get more creative. The whole ""against all odds even when completely irrational"" is mind-numbing.",1404086400,,719,5.076271186440678

3016657,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"I just recently purchased '24: Season 7' because I like the series. My problem is = the box came 'Undamaged' direct from Amazon. The factory wrapping was 'sealed & intact' but the DVD case itself was shattered in pieces, when I opened the packaging Broken Pieces of the DVD case came falling out. So this points out the fact that 'whoever picked the product & packed up the box' knew at the time that the factory DVD case was Seriously Damaged. Before I opened the factory cello wrapping, I could hear the pieces of the Broken case rattling around & I could see the plastic pieces inside the cellophane.

3016663,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"If you like fast paced action then you'll like this action packed thriller.  The only criticism I have is that the writers keep reusing the same theme, throughout the series, which leads to quite a bit of redundancy almost to the point where it could become boring if it were not for the dramatic quick action scenes along with the often climactic cliffhangers.  By far, 24 will be one of my top listed television series.",1403654400,,421,4.6

My complaint has to do with the constant sotto voce delivery of the dialogue. It's not just season 7. It's every season from the very beginning. I have pretty decent hearing, but I cannot understand the dialogue because every line is being whispered. Even when Jack isn't whispering he's whispering. It's very annoying. Damn it - I have to have closed captions constantly on in order to understand the dialogue. Why can't the director let these guys speak in a normal voice? It's, frankly, very annoying, in fact, maddening. I hate it. If it were less of a show than it is, I would stop watching it for that very reason.",1403308800,,748,4.507352941176471

I can back it up for dialogue I missed and really follow the intricate plots and sub-plots that are intertwined in a well thought out web of intrigue and nail biting drama. My recliner is taking a beating from squirming around while Jack Bauer is squirming and catching hell from every angle imaginable. I think it's one of the best series ever on TV and I go way back to the dawn of TV. We've come a long way since the Sky King and Leave it to Beaver days of yore. I even sent off to Amazon for the 'Ultimate 24 Guide' and other related materials....I grew up in front of a TV and I'm still sitting here....only instead of having milk and cookies on my TV tray I have this laptop to write reviews and order more stuff from Amazon.

We were hooked almost immediately, but didn't really have all the back-stories figured out and missed a few of the episodes of this season.  When the entire series appeared on Amazon Prime this year, we started at the beginning and have followed through to Season 8 and the current season being aired.

The show is still entertaining and the supporting cast do a great job.  Frankly, almost all of them play their role better than Jack Bauer. every season that I have ever seen, there is a rogue agent who has penetrated the agency.  Not only this idea is getting boring, but it is quite unrealistic, particularly when it happens so repetitiously. Overall though, the show is pretty entertaining.",1401494400,,522,4.5212765957446805

I will go go back to season 1 to see how it evolved to ""24 Redemption"".  I caught it  from season 7.

The plot holes are fewer though the suspension of belief that plagues this series is still a problem.  Why does Tony turn?  We find out in his big reveal at the end but it's an uncomfortable choice by the writers.

and the abusive tactics of the bureaucrats.  NSA, FBI, SEC, and all
of the other Federal agencies.",1400284800,,473,4.340909090909091

3016783,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"Before anything else is said let it be known that I would qualify as a lefty in most circles.  I'm strongly anti-war, and anti-torture as well, and I have friends that can't believe I love 24.  But as I tell them, this series does not back away from the tough questions and it wrestles with them skillfully.  In addition it's hard to imagine a more high octane ride, filled with moment after moment of suspense.  I'm postponing watching season eight for as long as possible so I don't run out of episodes too quickly.  Of course there's always the tension between wanting to save some to watch, and waiting so long that you've forgotten key aspects of the plot, or lost the momentum.  So I'll wait a little longer, but not too long.  This is really great television, and I think it's the only program I've ever seen that in seven seasons hasn't even had but the slightest hint of humor- yet I loved it all!  Mindless action to escape into, yet lots of deep questions for the thinking man- i.e.: on Jacks putative death bed he calls for a Muslim cleric who holds his hand.  How Islamaphobic is that?  This is a must see!

I also guess that my being a pacifist doesn't mean I think violence is never ever an alternative- Clearly there do seem to be situations which may require a violent solution.  For me being a pacifist just means that the greater the degree to which violence plays a role of any solution, the lessor the likelihood that things will stay fixed.  I see nothing in 24 that is inconsistent with this view.",1400112000,,1520,4.444043321299639

Jack Bauer, Chole, Tony Almeida, Bill Buchanan and all other characters have done a great job. And every season has a great story line. Good work !!!!!",1400025600,,398,4.1688311688311686

3016805,2,B000Y7ZBZS,"I'd have to think the only way to really enjoy season 7 would be to not have seen seasons one through four.  Because for those of us that watched those seasons closely, it's just not feasible that Tony could fit the role the writers have him in here.  For all the work they did together, for Tony to strap explosives to Jack in one of the last couple episodes of this is an insult to the intelligence of the viewer.  I'll pretend that a plastic surgeon turned terrorist created this ""alter-Tony"" and that either the real Tony remains dead from season five, or that the real Tony will return in a later season with some explanation for this garbage.  Nina Meyers as a character worked, but I'm sorry, this absolutely did not work.  Season 8 was something of an improvement from this; thank goodness.",1399593600,,798,4.513888888888889

3016829,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"I am wondering throughout the episodes of Season 7 That, how in this world could we possibly allow cowards,selfishness,and bastards to lead great nations and great people. Great leaders are those who take vow to lead, protect and prosper their people. They always say my folks, not my family or irrationally my son or daughter; they do not bluff about irrelevant family matters. They always care for the good of their country and their people.

Mrs. Allison Taylor is a kind of woman, extremely selfish who gambles at on the lives of many and at the expense of the suffer and trauma of Jack Bauer and his brave colleagues who always fights until they give their lives; precious life no one can measure its value. She sucked the blood of Bill Buchanan whose bravery, commitment and trustworthiness to the country he loved the the people he served is  unquestionable.

A few months ago my husband was looking for something new on Netflix and came across series one. We began to watch it one episode a night when he would get home at 11pm.  It became like crack cocaine!  We began to binge watch on our weekends. We got to season 6 when Netflix dropped the series.  We were so bummed that I went on Amazon and bought 7 and 8.  ""Then"" I found out Amazon Prime had it and we signed up for Amazon Prime. We just finished season 7. Do NOT get started on the series unless you have time because it is addictive!  We really will be sorry when we finish it.  BY THE WAY, WE HAVE YET TO RECEIVE OUR SEASON 7 AND 8 FROM AMAZON IN THE MAIL.",1397433600,2,818,3.8855421686746987

3016900,3,B000Y7ZBZS,"I enjoyed watching season 7 but it has a lot to be desired in the credibility department.  Characters incessantly keep oscillating between friend and foe in a 24-hour period.  Heroes who were exposed to a lethal dose of chemical warfare keep hesitating between dying and coming back from the dead by injecting themselves with what must be some kind of powerful miracle medicine.  Inconceivable yet instantaneous reconciliations end up in vicious backstabbing as instantaneous as the original reconciliation was. And on and on and on....the story is relentlessly as incredible as it is packed with action.  If you like action movies, but can look the other way when it comes to credibility, and are able to overcome your nausea when ""corny and cheesy"" does not even begin to qualify some of the scenes, you might enjoy the series.  Suspenseful, addictive, populated by likeable characters, but totally out of the realm of reality..",1397347200,,930,5.092105263157895

I guess it is a secret hopefulness that we have a character that gets things done in time of crisis, but somehow relatable to us. I did find myself asking some very serious questions about how I truly feel about certain things referred to in the series, decisions that should have consequences, yet where are the lines?

TV entertainment for Jason Bourne type fans I thought was well done and interestingly served.

It takes close to 21 hours to watch a season----and so would plan my time where would be able to get through one in about a week.  Hated to stop watching till series was finished.  Would give five stars, except, that Jack always just missing something that would have saved the situation; or would not have gotten in trouble if but by a few seconds.

3016955,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"I love watching 24. It is very fast at times, and very intense (which is not usually my kind of thing). But the thing is that you don't usually get to find out how it all ties together until the 24th episode. Since every hour is every episode. Hence 24 episodes in season/day. Great story and Great actors! Jack Bauer sees more action in 24 hours then most do in 10 lifetimes!",1396569600,,376,4.236111111111111

My children have all asked to receive the movies as well showing that many above the teens like movies with more than enough drama and action.  It's hard to stop watching as they keep you in suspense.  It's not a quick two hour movie like most, but takes a long time to get though each season.  Very exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat in great anticipation.",1396051200,,458,4.2298850574712645

3016990,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"24 is the overall best action program ever. I cannot write highly enough about 24. A brilliant idea well executed. Every 24 fan has his or her favourite season. I liked them all. No other series had me sitting at the edge of my seat the way 24 did and still does. Jack Bauer is a unique character. You'll find bits and pieces of the character in various works but none as complete a character as Sutherland and the writers made Jack Bauer. It is my all time favourite show. Since 24 you will find a number of characters in TV, movies and books which emulate Jack Bauer--Jack Reacher, the lead character of Taken 1 and 2 and several others--but they fall short of Jack Bauer. He is the ultimate hero and anti-hero rolled into one. 24 is a work of fiction, first and foremost, but it explored security problems confronting all nations today regarding terrorism. It took an unflinching look at terrorism, at the escalating threat it posses. It is gritty and doesn't blink where violence is concerned. It posed hard questions and solutions in ways that are rarely portrayed on TV. I cannot recommend this propramme highly enough. I am so happy it is returning to TV on 5 May 2014.",1394755200,,1176,4.525821596244131

3017017,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"If non-stop action adventure is your cup of tea, this series is for you.  But you have to watch each season from the beginning, or risk getting a little lost.  Personally, I enjoyed every season.  They only got better and better.  And season 7 was one of my favorites (at least it was up until a big plot twist towards the end).  Unfortunately, it does have one of the only plot twists that I ever really disliked.  They took it too far with one character in my opinion.  But I'll leave that for each individual to decide for themselves.  But I will say this.  The twist did take away from my enjoyment of the season.  I can't re-watch season 7 with as much fun as I did all of the other seasons.  And that's a shame, because Season 7 was still brilliantly done.  In the end, I guess a more accurate rating for Season 7 would have been 4.75 STARS.",1392422400,,847,4.225

You can read her thoughts in her eyes & expressions on her face while never saying a word. Jack Bauer, we love you, but you need to enunciate your words more clearly.

3017031,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"One of the more intrinsically gripping seasons when the action shifts to Washington D.C, presenting how national defense gets mired and mucked up with politics. Most characters are well depicted, although I thought some would have been better represented by other actors - yet the acting was talented in general.

The last few episodes stretched credibility to show how even Jack Bauer could keep going with such stamina to endure and persevere through a horrible nuclear infection to again save the day. Fans must have suffered through the seasonal hiatus wondering what was going to happen (would the show be canceled, but maybe that pumped up ratings). So I felt disappointed that Jack's illness wasn't addressed in more detail at the beginning of the next season, when he was miraculously cured and again in fighting form.(Perhaps later episodes present more detail - I'm just starting season 8, but that's another review).

Other gaps in season 7's storylines (which may have been stripped from the final episode versions) include Bill Buchanan's marital relationship, Jack's daughter's sudden appearance after years of estrangement, and Tony Almeida's real motives for his apparently back-and-forth ""whose side is he on, anyway""? Maybe fewer bomb explosions and less gunfire would've allowed time for evelopment of those storylines. Yet as a professional writer, I must commend 24's scriptwriters' ongoing, imaginative plot development. Kudos to them especially after creating 7 seasons worth of scripts.",1391299200,,1510,5.421276595744681

I didn't care for the woman they chose to play President Taylor because she looked similar to Hillary Clinton. Seems the producers were trying to plant this idea in the mind of the viewer.

You can't kill Jack because he's the star of the show. I suppose by season 7, I am just a wee bit jaded. The plots are a little too over the top. There have been too many plots to assassinate the president, wipe out L.A. or DC, too many moles in the CTU or the upper echelons of government. In other words, It's not hard to believe there are dirty people in our government, but Jack has had 7 seasons to get rid of them. Enough already.",1390348800,,562,4.026785714285714

The writers and producers make you sit thru epically unbelievable situations -  one after another after another.  Stupid and short sighted characters (president Taylor, her husband and her daughter- FBI guy Larry, Tony's laughable non-communication about his agenda to jack, on and on.  Trumped up charges for Renee one hour (for which she is a wanted outlaw) and then the charges are completely forgotten within two to three hours -without explanation!
Even the Jack character is so wrapped up in himself as to opt for his selfish pride rather than allowing his daughter to help him.  He'd rather suicide by bio weapon than entertain the idea he might have usefulness for his grandkids, daughter and friends. what a narcissistic tool.

Sure--I like some of the setups and a little bit of the action and a few tactics but when i finish a series i feel pretty dirty for having sunk low enough to swallow the rancid plot scum pushed my way.  It just feels like they have no respect for their audience.  I, having worked for 20 years in film, TV and corporate production, know that this attitude is fairly common among a far share of filmaking professionals.  They just don't want to spend the time and effort to write 'tight' and intelligently.  You can have your cake and eat it too ( i can name 100 films and tv series)-- it just takes more work.

Oh, one more thing bears repeating and embellishment.  The President Taylor character is so dumb/slow, naive, selfish and has terrible judgment (angry, untrustworthy, conniving daughter as chief of staff my ass--HA!)

3017131,1,B000Y7ZBZS,"This season is hard to stomach.  The problem: There is far too much hand wringing over ""torture"" and and other liberal causes (saving africans from genocide, profiling of muslims, Gitmo, evil right wing terrorists) it is difficult to watch. It is such an odd take on 24, which has always been about doing what it takes to beat the bad guys and preserving freedom and the American way. You wonder what the writers were thinking (Presumably, we really hate George Bush). There is also an amazing (and not very beleivable) resurrection of a previously dead 24 character, a feat only Jack Bauer could accomplish up until this season. Lots of eye rolling ensues.  24 has always had liberal elements. (All good presidents are black and/or women, all bad corrupt presidents are white men.) But this season really takes it over top. The last straw was near the end of the season ultra left winger Janeane Garafolo, playing an FBI analysts (the evil CTU has been disbanded, presumably for torturing too many people), whines incesantly about how the FBI was ""trampling the constitution""  by ""profiling"" and jack apologizes to her! I nearly barfed. Add then the peaceful innocent muslims who are framed as terrorists by the evil right wingers and well, you get the picture.  They just beat you over the head week after week with every liberal cause you can imagine. And let's not forget the  slow weepy finale that fades to black before resolving many key plot elements. Does Jack die from being exposed to a fatal biological weapon?, Who knows? Does Renee turn into Jack Bauer and kill the villain? Your guess is as good as mine. Ugh. The worst all the 24 seasons.  You probably want to skip this one.",1372291200,7,1691,4.7542662116040955

3017139,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"I have enjoyed all seasons of '24', but this one was different in that it wasn't set in L.A. and CTU had been decommissioned. I couldn't believe they had Jack Bauer on trial, after all he's done for the country, but he wasn't in court long before the FBI pulled him out to help them with a case... and then, typical of '24'... the action and plot-twists were non-stop. I was glad to see Tony back, but wasn't happy with how things ended with him. Maybe he'll be able to redeem himself in some future '24' season. I was also happy to see Aaron Pierce come back (love him!) and the rivalry between Chloe and her FBI counterpart Janis was funny. Too bad Chloe's husband, Morris, didn't play more of a role. And I was disappointed with what happened to Bill Buchanan, too. Did the writers really have to do that?

This show, which was I think supposed to display our ability to counter terrorism turns out to have been terrorized by political correctness. Tremendous letdown.

This is a pretty good season although the first half, dealing with problems in a fictional African country, was slow, a new plot in the second half was very exciting.  There are some truly wonderful elements this season that rank up there with the best of ""24;"" Cherry Jones plays a sensitive and capable President, Bob Gunton is great as her Chief of Staff, and James Morrison's Bill Buchanan has an unforgettable scene that left me gasping aloud. There are lots of intense twists and turns and it ends up being a very good season.

Kiefer Sutherland continues to be a charismatic super-hero, but there are so many subplots and characters that he's not given enough screen time.  The setting, Washington DC, isn't as good as the old CTU, but thankfully, we get Bill and Chloe back and the lovable Agent Pierce, as well.  Unfortunately, we also get Kim back.

It's hard to maintain the high level of writing and acting that ""24"" has set, but this season deserves an A-.",1364428800,,1196,4.586854460093897

Things were (at least for me) getting a bit tired in season 5. (Was that the season where Kim was chased by a cougar wearing a beret and carrying a knife?) Anyway, I digress... So, I sort of thought it was done.

After seeing some other positive reviews of season 7, I thought it was worth trying again... especially at the low prices that an ""old"" show goes for. I was very happy with it! This is probably the best season I have seen so far. Of course, you must maintain a casual relationship with reality in some cases throughout the series, but overall it works very well.

If you are a fan of 24 (or what it used to be early on) this is worth buying. I bought the Blu-ray for something like 24 beans. Great deal for some decent entertainment.

3017211,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"Season 7 of ""24"" packs all the excitement, drama, and pulse-thumping action that fans of ""24"" have come to expect.  There is no sense in going into the plot, as it would spoil the viewer's enjoyment of the series.  That said, certain themes are once again explored in this remarkable award-winning drama.  Season 7 explores the theme of interrogation techniques used to extract critical information from suspects.  In the previous 6 seasons of ""24"", CTU Agent Field Commander Jack Bauer routinely violated prisoner's rights in order to get information that would save thousands of lives.  It comes down to this: Is is acceptable to violate one individual's rights in order to protect the safety of thousands, or even tens of thousands? Do the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?, (as Mister Spock so memorably said to Captain Kirk as he was dying), or should the rule of law always prevail without exception?  This season deals in-depth with this issue, not only for field agents, but for computer operators, doctors, and yes, even presidents.  It seems that we all have ethical decisions to make, some of which have profound implications.  How far is a person willing to go to reach the ""truth""?  Jack Bauer's psyche is explored in detail in this regard, and this sub-plot is an extremely important and interesting element of this season.

The supporting cast is once again superb, second to none, and the interactions between characters is both humorous and tragic. The character development is absolutely astounding, more characteristic of a full-length movie than a TV series.

""24"" not only will accelerate your heart, it will grab it too. Simply stated, there is no television show that is in the league of ""24""; all pale in comparison.

I prefer watching serials such as ""24"" episode after episode, for if I allow too much time to elapse between episodes, I tend to forget important details.  My recommendation is to sequester yourself in a room with ""24"" and watch at least one disk at a time.  This will give you 6 nights of unparalleled entertainment.

Don't miss this season.

The last hour makes you feel like maybe they should have called the series '26,' because they really needed a couple more episodes to close a lot of issues at the end.

A few of the loose ends at the end that leave you hanging off  a cliff:

What happened to Starkwood and all the other security firms that were conspiring together?

Was Jack Bauer's daughter able to save him from the chemical exposure?

Did all of the President's duaghter's actions come out and what was the media fallout like?

What ever happened with Tony Almeida?

3017214,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"I didn't really notice ""24"" until it's last season. I heard about it before, but never really bothered to try and watching it until it's last season and was surprised that it was actually a decent show.

I then noticed that seasons 1-7 were availible for Prime for free, which allowed me to watch every season on amazon, which took a few months watching a few episodes each week.

Kiefer Sutherland plays Jack Bauer, the main character, who seems to have everything go wrong at the wrong moments, somewhat reminds me of Bruce Willis in Die Hard. Many things in this series such as the circumstances and outcomes are not the most realistic scenarios. If you are looking for a realistic type show, this is not for you.

Each season has many twists in its story, while some more obvious than others. As of this review I have finished all seasons of ""24"", and have enjoyed watching Jack Bauer's experiences throughout the series.

While I am not a die hard 24 fan, I still enjoyed the series and will certainly watch the movie if/when it does get released. Would recommend watching to those who haven't already been immersed by this show!",1331942400,,1134,4.626865671641791
3017215,3,B000Y7ZBZS,"This season tried too hard from the get-go. Right from the start, CTU is disbanded. Umm, why? Didn't the last six seasons prove the case for this agency? Nevermind, apparently it's all about torture - and Jack's on trial from the start for his role in saving millions of lives, uh, I mean torturing a few dozen or so people. What cheese. And it only gets worse when the writers play their next few gimmicks in order to stir up interest: Female President (Cherry Jones), setting the show in DC (actually, not a bad play - LA needs a break), making up the country ""Sangala"" (because using a real one is just so un-PC, I guess), creating a McGuffin that borders on science fiction, and a familiar agent rising from the dead. That's right, Tony Almeida is still alive thanks to some really convoluted writing ploy and now's he's working with the bad guys.

All of this blends together for a shockingly bland and unbelievable season. If Jack was still working with CTU, this might be a tad bit more tangible, but now he's just suckered into the most statistically improbable plot yet when the FBI (which has been transformed into a poor man's CTU) interrupts his senate hearing in order to track bad guy Almeida. If you're not buying Tony as a bad guy, then you'll be ready for the 'plot twist' in the third episode - along with the many after. In short, this season was predictable for the start and ends the same way. It's still pulse-pounding moments, but they're suppressed when you have a bizarre attack on the White House that really takes you out of the moment (really, Secret Service? Is it really that easy?). Season Six was criticized for reusing plot devices and series cliches. But here, they're in full force. A mole (the most predictable one yet), a turncoat, government conspiracy, a forced death of a main character, need for sattelite coverage, ridiculous acceptance of Jack going rogue time and again by his associates, the first villain, the second villain, and the final secret villain who was behind it all. Yawn.

I'll always be a Jack fan, that's why I gave this three stars. He still has his moments and Keifer still sells him better than any other contrived character type this season pukes out. It's all fairly straightforward and predictable and comes across as too gimmicky for its own good.

3017218,4,B000Y7ZBZS,This is an excellent series of 24 that matches the excitement of the previous six series. However the DVDs don't appear to be compatible with my TV (we live in Spain) so we had to watch it on the laptop!,1324425600,,203,4.1
3017219,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"I've been a ""24"" fan since the series began, and as many earlier reviews have stated, the 7th season was a true ""high point"" for this show.  It's true that the series had been getting a bit stale over the previous 2 seasons, then there was the Writer's Strike which basically set everything back a year, with co-creators Joel Surnow and Bob Cochrane eventually leaving the show for good.

In this case, the infusion of ""new blood"" (pardon the pun) was just what the show needed.  I've been watching my DVD's again recently, and here's the high points:

>Great pacing.  The action is non-stop, but the plot threads are as twisted as I remember the First Season's being, and they strike a great balance between the two.

>We really see Jack's dark side.  Although it's seldom mentioned in these episodes, the torture at the hands of the Chinese has left both visible and hidden scars on our hero.  He's still doing his job, still dedicated to saving lives, but he's a man who's pretty much lost all hope in the future.

>Casting for this season is excellent! Cherry Jones as the President, and Anne Wersching as FBI Agent Renee Walker nail their roles, plus we get to see Bill Buchanan, Tony Almeida and Secret Service agent Aaron Pierce again, as well as Chloe O'Brien.  We also have a perfect foil for Jack in FBI Bureau Chief Larry Moss, a ""by the book"" lawman who refuses to see things Jack's way even the wheels start coming off.  This was a tough role to pull off, and both the actor and the writers deserve extra credit here.  And of course you can't have a better villain than Jon Voight!

>The resolution was just what it should have been.  No, Jack doesn't die (obviously, since there's another season after this one) but he comes as close as we've ever seen, and for once he has to depend on someone else to save him.  It's a touching moment.

If you still don't have this set, buy it!  I have the regular DVD set and am very pleased with both the sound and the video quality. This was the season where we saw Jack come full circle, and actually get some closure at the end.  It's worth your time, ""I give you my word...""",1309392000,,2130,4.4318766066838045
3017220,2,B000Y7ZBZS,"Once again this review occurs in real time. This one starts slightly more plausibly than the previous iterations. When is a safe house not a safe house? When it has readily accesible ventilation ducts. Here's a shocker the new white house is less than a day old and already we have an ideological standoff between the President and her chief of staff. Is there nothing this CIP device can't do? It's like ""the override"" 2.0. Can't the invasion wait a week? I'm no president, but the decision to pull out the troops seems like a no brainer. Nice borrowing of the Predator franchise soundtrack. Good to see that the FBI also promotes inter office romances. I like the fact they call the villain ""Debacle"". In a completely innovative plot twist the FBI has a mole. How do they come up with these wrinkles every season? The slap-o-rama is an acting tour de force-must see TV. This season was scoring very high on the plausibility scale until the raid on the white house by dudes wearing jungle fatigues. All of the hard work by the script writers was immediately tossed out of the window. The team then digs deep and comes up with a safe room - hostage standoff and a family member close to the president with reckless ambition. Provisional chief of staff? Really. When your walking on thin ice you might as well dance...I guess. From estranged daughter for ten years to chief of staff in less then 5 hours. They've gone too far when Starkwood management, after blackmailing the President with a WMD cataclysm,  shows up in the oval office with a GBC binding on their proposal for a cabinet position? GBC!? Let's go with another Kim is our hostage and will die unless you help us plot. We haven't trotted that one out in a few seasons.

Me & my mom also loved her husband(even though he wasn't in the whole season. Of course, Aaron pierce came back as well as Bill Buchannan & chloe o'brian. The saddest things about this season was Tony's betrayal. I know he was only trying to get back at the man Alan wilson for killing his wife, Michelle and his unborn son.  But he also killed larry moss.(whoa!) Renee the rest of the way kind a turned into a Jack Bauer almost. Olivia Taylor was okay. I also liked tim woods as well. Colonial Dubaku was the antagonist of the show, did he's part good, But we felt sympathy for his girlfriend who really liked him(even when she found out who he really was. But also the other main antogonist Benjamin Juma was just terrible. Jon voight was also in it, But olivia takes care of him.

3017236,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"I recently bought the S7 dvd set & let me tell you, this show is like eating your fav candy. Once you start it's damn near impossible to stop! Lately i'm averaging 4 episodes per day & i'm happy to report that these episodes are just as addictive & suspenseful as they were when it first aired on FOX. As usual, each show is jam packed with action & suspense & the tension also harldly ever lets up.  Great stuntwork & explosions abound as well. But one of best things about this show are all the great character actors they always seem to bring in for each season.  Kurtwood Smith (Robocop) as Senator Blaine Mayer, Jon Voight (Deliverance) as the corrupt leader of a Blackwater-like mercenaries for hire outfit, Bob Gunton (Shawshank Redemption) as the White House Chief of Staff, Colm Feore (The Sum of All Fears) as the First man, Will Patton (Armageddon) as the head conspirator, Glenn Morshower (Blackhawk Down) reprising his role as Secret service agent - Aaron Pierce & Janeane Garofalo (Copland) as a nosy & suspicious FBI computer expert. Carlos Bernard also reprises his role as former CTU Agent turned fugitive Tony Almeida & Elisha Cuthbert  returns as well as Jack's estranged daughter - Kim.  The best new character in S7 though is the FBI agent Renee Walker played by lovely actress - Anne Wersching. She accompanies Jack Bauer through most of the series & quickly learns that in order to assist Jack in saving the day, she will sometimes have to bend the rules & do things that go against her own moral beliefs. This makes her very uneasy & frequently gets her in trouble with her boss - The ""By the book"" FBI Head Agent - Larry Moss (Jeffrey Nordling) who resents Jack for breaking law after law & torturing suspects. The tension between the three characters is very palpable & really helps add to the suspense & drama of the show. Add in a great story with frequent plot twists, lots of great action, terrific characters & more suspense than you can shake a stick at & you've got one of the most captivating seasons in the entire franchise.  I'd personally rank S7 as one of the top 3 best in the series & a must watch for anyone who's fan of 24 or great action thrillers with good character development.",1280361600,,2223,4.56140350877193
3017237,1,B000Y7ZBZS,"Here we go again... ludicrous storylines, idiotic twists, irritating characters, lots of gunfire and armed SWAT teams storming buildings and the villian they're after slipping out quietly through a side door... everything that wound you up in the first six series is back again for season 7, with knobs on.

What really strangles most of the 24 seasons at birth, though, is the format that made it famous... that it all happens in 'real' time, over the course of a single day. This isn't a real problem when this single day is stretched over 24 episodes, shown one a week on TV, for 5 or 6 months. But on DVD, when most of us watch two or three episodes a night during the course of a week or so, the preposterous succession of cataclysmic events, of the kind that most of us would be unlucky to witness in a lifetime, one after the other, reduces everything to the level of total and unbelievable farce.

In this season, for example, we have the White House attacked and bombs going off inside the building, loads of people gunned down, and rooms and walls and furniture etc destroyed or sprayed with bullets... and yet, barely two hours later, there is no evidence of this whatsoever, and life goes on in a pristine, undamaged White House as if nothing has happened at all!

One of the bonus features on Disc 6 shows the writers discussing the various problems of tailoring stories to the strait jacket of the 24 hour 'real time'format, with one guy saying they did consider having a 'time gap' between each event, like fast forwarding to three weeks later, for example. Sadly, this was dismissed as it might upset the 24 'purist' fans. To me this was a big mistake and might have freed them up to deliver more credible storylines with a bit more character development, for example.

Still, all this is moot now, as I gather Season 8 has just ended and it was the last they're doing. Daft as 24 was, you can't deny it was entertaining and had some money spent on it, and Jack Bauer is a great character... that's why I can grudgingly give Season 7 one star. It loses the other 4 for bringing back really annoying bit part characters from earlier seasons for no reason whatsoever, and for all the other reasons mentioned above.

I don't know if Jack Bauer survives at the end of Season 8, but if he does, there'd be nothing wrong with perhaps two or three feature films based on his character... WITHOUTtrying to cram it all into one totally unrealistic and idiotic 24 hour period. It couldn't be any worse than a lot of the other hideous 'reboot' rubbish spewing out of Hollywood, that's for sure.",1279843200,5,2599,4.544871794871795

3017246,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"This saga reveals a sinister conspiracy from the bottom to the top into the great spehere of power. from the very first episode, we have Jack Bauer having noticed that Almeida, Buchanan and Chloe have decided by themselves to establish a little CTU, trying to search for a terible bio chemical weapon.

In this sense, Juma seems to be the central axis, but he is just a part of this iceberg where interests of all kind are on the table. Contacts into the White House as well as a never ending list of links that eventually will lead him to Alan Wilson (Will Patton).

Once more, Bauer will have to cross over the line of the duty and the rules of game, guessing, fighting and dealing with an overwhelming amount of decisions in which the double crossing, betrayal and the concepts of polite patriotism mask sordid intentions.

Jon Voight steals the show as Jones, a man absolutely convinced he is right, based on his his most firm convictions, acting according the most faithful Machivellian rules, confers the saga of first rate realism and paves the way for future reflections about where's the line of duty ends and where the conspiracy begins.

Special kudos go for Ethan Koin (Pierce), the President of USA and Juma among the impeccable cast. perhaps the only flaw in the cast was (by lack of dramatic punch. was the President's daughter who never made me believe her personage).

3017265,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"After Season 6 of 24, I was a little worried.  It appeared that the show had started running out of ideas, and was starting to veer into completely implausable storylines.  However, season 7 was a far better season, and a return to form, thanks to a much needed jolt in the arm with new characters and new locations. The setting is washington  DC, the task...well its 24 so its save america from bad guys.  I won't give any spoilers or tell the story, but it very much follows the 24 template, a story begins, morphs into another, and morphs yet again.  The use of the new FBI characters works well.  I especially liked the young Rene opposite baurer, who is starting to show his age.  Rene's youthful vigor and debate over right and wrong plays well with Jack's do anythiny necessary approach, without coming off nagging.  There was also a return of some well missed characters.  My only complaint, the new president, and her story, wasn't a particular grabber to me.  The president is often the basis of the additional story in the show, as their decisions are important and relevant.  However, this president seemed a bit week and wishy washy, and her subplots weren't that interesting, and rather predictable.  But that's a small flaw with a very good season of an amazing show.  I recomend it to all 24 fans.",1265155200,,1313,4.632034632034632
3017266,2,B000Y7ZBZS,"I won't sugarcoat it: the ""24"" staff had a tough act to follow in 2009.  After the writers' strike, the problems in Day 6 (which has been unofficially called the worst season of ""24"" to date), and the weak storylines in ""24: Redemption,"" the writers had a challenge on their hands.  Day 7 was an opportunity for a fresh start, a chance to pull things together better than before.

But they tried too hard.

Everything in Day 7 shifted in some way.  Jack Bauer had been to Africa, CTU was disbanded, and Tony Almeida was alive.  Behind the scenes, the staff at ""24"" was introducing some new members and seeing a couple veterans leave.  Sometimes, change is inevitable in the course of a series, but that doesn't mean every change you make will improve the series.

The ""24"" staff used the writers' strike as time to plan out the entire day's terror plot.  Up until then, they did almost everything off the cuff.  This change is definitely my biggest issue with Day 7, and it's an issue because it goes against most of what I stand for as a writer.  I've been writing books and screenplays since 1996; ever since 2005, I've used ""24"" as my biggest training material.  I've made a lot of mistakes as I've tried to create a great story, so when I heard that Day 7 would be planned out in advance, the writer in me kept insisting one thing: ""It won't work.""

Unfortunately, I saw this play out as the season went on.  The day started out strong, but after the first few hours, it felt more and more engineered.  Here's why I think that's the case.  Whenever you write, your focus has to be your main character.  He makes the show happen; he lets it make sense.  From the beginning, most of what the writers had to go on was Jack Bauer, and that was enough to make a good story.  His history, family, personal life, and job--all of it was material the writers used to deepen the situation as it happened.  They saw it unfold along with Jack, and it gave them the most room to work with.  Everything was consistent and fresh because it all depended on what Jack was going to do.

But in Day 7, the focus was not on Jack.  It was on Tony Almeida.  His return has been debated, so I'll put in my two cents' worth.  He should have stayed dead.  Killing him was a stretch, bringing him back to life even more so.  But making him a quadruple agent pushed it too far.  The conspiracy he spearheaded wasn't well planned and constructed, and he switched sides so many times over the course of the day that I kept asking, ""Who is this guy?""

For all that the writers planned, it disappointed me that the main focus of the day came out so poorly.  This bothered me the entire season because the show is really supposed to be about Jack.  He's the character who ties everything together.  If the writers had focused on him, then they would have had a stronger storyline.  But the focus was on Tony, and instead of Jack taking charge, he came across to me as though he was only along for the ride.  He did and said the things that we would expect him to do, but it felt passive, as if Jack weren't making the decisions on his own.

Disbanding CTU was another major change I didn't like.  Apart from Jack Bauer, CTU makes the infrastructure of ""24"" unique.  Setting it in the FBI took away the atmosphere of the show.  ""24"" was not the same without the CTU phone sound, Chloe and Morris O'Brian bickering (which I actually miss), and a staff that's willing to do whatever it takes.  But in the FBI, it was too many politics and not enough action.  I didn't connect or even like the characters.  Sean Hillinger sounded and acted like he was reading the recipe for deviled eggs.  Larry Moss and Renee Walker sounded like they were trying too hard.  Janis Gold bothered me every time she spoke.  Everything at the FBI probably could have been removed, and it wouldn't have made a difference in the story.

But a major upset in the story is the terror plot.  In terms of the plot, this is the most important part of ""24.""  If the terror threat isn't well-constructed, then the story loses its impact.  It was hard to tell who was ultimately behind it all--Jonas Hodges, Tony Almeida, or Benjamin Juma, none of whom I consider believable villains.  It was hard to tell what the motive was behind the attack.  In Day 3 of ""24,"" it's clear who the villain is, what the threat is, and why he's carrying out the attack.  In Day 3, Stephen Saunders planned to use the Cordilla virus to wipe out America's population; his goal was ""to make America clean again"" after the U.S. government left him for dead in an explosion in Bosnia.  But there's not the same level of clarity or precision in Day 7.  We have a bioweapon (literally called ""the bioweapon,"" or a prion variant), but we never really know who plans to use it or why.

Bottom line:  Day 7 had too much planning, too many holes, and too many things that just didn't work.  To me, Day 7 was the worst season of ""24"" to date; I don't remember a season where everything at its most fundamental level felt so disjointed.  I think that if they stuck to the ways they used to craft ""24,"" then I would have loved Day 7.  The past seasons of ""24"" set a level of excellence that's easy to reach if the episodes are written loosely.  The writers tried too hard to create a better season, and they ended up fixing what wasn't broken.",1265068800,2,5350,4.367139959432048

I had to clean the disc numerous time to get it to pay and when it did play the quality was very poor in both sound and clarity. This was purchased new and wasn't.....not nice to deceive a loyal customer!!!!!!!!!he won't return! I would guess this was bought off the street then repackaged.....not cool!  The tape itself was entertaining, howevew Keifer Sutherlin was a little over the top in his role of Jack Bauer.

3017278,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"For some reason I've always found the farther away the show 24 strays from it's CTU  plotlines the more interesting it gets. I'm not saying it needs more character exposition (hopefully the show learned THAT lesson season 6), but I mean honestly how many times can California's anti-terrorist unit (apparently run by GQ models and ex-Microsoft employees) get infiltrated before someone notices it's ineffectivenes? Thankfully 24 season seven not only gets rid of CTU (mostly) but places the show in a much more diverse setting: Washington DC.

This season of 24 starts off with a bang. Hero Jack Bauer on trial for his and CTU's inhumane treatment of criminals and terrorists (about time huh?). Then with the return of Tony Almada (who we saw die in season 5) Jack's called back into action. While the story of this season has the show's usual ups and downs (we already know Jack won't die so why even go there?) it's overall very solid. The action scenes are also very good and rank up there with this series's best (I don't think anything can quite compare to the adrenaline rush of Tony and Jack shooting their way out of Quantico!). The acting this season is also above average with cast regulars turning in their usual strong efforts and are joined by the equally good Cherry Jones as the new US president, Colm Feore, and Janeane Garofalo.

The packaging of this DVD set is probably the best I've seen yet! Seriously I hope the rest of the seasons (and every other TV show out there for that matter) get re-issued in this case format. I think my only complaint is not knowing which extras are on what DVD (thought this could easily be fixed with a thin paper insert).

So if you're a 24 fan this season is an easy buy. It may not be it's best season but it does enough right to make it an enteraining romp and shows there's still life in this long-running series.",1263081600,,1869,4.586826347305389

3017281,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"After seeing the ""Redemption"" two hour special I was very excited to see this season.  After seeing Season 6, I was starting to get concerned that the writers behind 24 were running out of ideas.  The fact that Jack's dad was constantly coming up got incredibly tedious after a while.  Luckily in Season 7 this doesn't happen.  The villains change and get bigger as the show goes on, like we would normally find in a season of 24.

One of the things that made this season especially strong was the change in location.  The fact that this season takes place in Washington D.C. really gives it a breath of fresh air in my opinion.  As you can guess this involves a threat to the White House and it is connected to ""Redemption"", but I won't say anything more than that.  At first with the setting in Los Angeles with David Palmer it was really great, but after a while the terrorists always attacking this one location got a little run of the mill after a while.  For whatever reason the change of location makes everything better.  In fact I think it would be awesome to let Jack's character go to different locations in future seasons.

The season kicks off with Jack on trial with Congress for his use of torture tactics.  This is a theme that gets revisited quite a bit throughout the season.  Obviously this reflects the U.S.'s current questions on how effective torture tactics are.  I like seeing those sort of questions being reflected in popular media.  I also like that they don't force their character to completely change to popular thinking, and then of course we wouldn't have Jack Bauer.

As some people have mentioned the packaging for this DVD is excellent.  I have to agree, it's the size of a regular DVD case, yet has six discs in it!  This saves on space and it does not require the use of Dual Disc.  I hate Dual Disc because you run a higher risk of scratching a surface of a disc, with these DVD's all of them have the top coated surface.  I think all large DVD sets should use this form of packaging; the sheer space saving aspect is completely worth it.

If you felt that 24 was starting to flounder like I was, you might be pleasantly surprised at this season.  Sure the events are over the top, but that gives us the action packed episodes we all want.  If you're a total action fan then you can't go wrong with this season of 24.",1262822400,,2355,4.425581395348837

And while some things are totally preposterous, you'll still find yourself totally enthralled.  Kiefer is perfect as always going from his whispery pleadings to his bombastic outrages.  You gotta love him!  And he's surrounded himself with top-notch support from Cherry Jones, Colm Feore, James Morrison, Annie Werthing, Mary Lynn Rajskub, Carlos Bernard, Janeane Garafolo, Jeffrey Nordling and Jon Voight.

3017284,3,B000Y7ZBZS,"Now that the dust has settled and I've had time to reflect on Season 7 of 24, I decided that I would give it a three star rating. I loved it and hated it all at the same time. I loved it because of the action, the tense situations and moments, and of course the unpredictable and over the top methods of Jack Bauer. I hated it for the overloaded terror plots, the eye-rolling conspiracy stuff, and the multiple Tony twists. I decided on three stars because I enjoyed the season and watched every episode, but I didn't like it for the same reasons that I liked the early seasons.  The show started off as a semi-realistic, fast paced, exciting show with great story lines and great action. It still has the action and the excitement, but not near the heart, of the early seasons, but as far as realism (relative to its earlier self, at least) goes, forget it. Also, much of the excitement and intensity went out the window when they quit trying with the real-time element of the show. So, in the end, I liked Season 7 for the same reason that I like watching the mindless summer action popcorn flicks, whereas I enjoyed Seasons 1, 2 and in general 3 because they seemed to be much more intelligent and more realistic. Did these early seasons have some absurdities? Sure. But I feel like Season 7, among others, was just over the top.

In particular, here are some issues I had with Season 7:

-The Tony twists: While I was initially hoping that Tony would be coming back, I should have known to just let bygones be bygones and accept that Tony was gone. Now we're stuck with this nonsensical mess of Tony switching sides throughout the day after a practically non-existent explanation of how he came back in the first place. While watching it as it aired, it was exciting and shocking. But, when thinking back on it in the context of the entire season, it just doesn't make a lot of sense.

-The Conspiracies: This is just getting ridiculous. Every season since 5 has had some lame super secret evil conspiracy, and it was even alluded to at some point that they were behind Season 4. When did this become the X-Files? To complicate matters, they always go down screaming about how they are patriots, and how they think the world would be a better place because they killed 10,000 people. Each person turns out to be just another pawn in a larger game. I expect that in Season 8 we will find out this conspiracy was just another subordinate for larger, more secret, more evil conspiracy. For as much as I don't like the conspiracy stories, I don't even think they did it right. They build up Jonas Hodges as the bad guy for most of the season only to say ""well, um, he, uh, he was actually working for Wilson. Yeah."" Wilson presents yet another problem: before he is revealed and we are learning about the conspiracy, they keep alluding to how powerful and how far-reaching this secret leader is, and then he turns out to be nobody. I was expecting a jaw drop moment when they revealed who it was, but instead I was thinking ""who the heck is this guy"". Then, they go on to say, ""oh, well, um, yeah, that conspiracy stuff with Logan, Henderson, and Jack's family, well, uh, they were actually working for Wilson, too."" Basically, the premise of the show, which started out being about the Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU), is now about the Counter Conspiracy Unit (CCU). So, my final thought on this is that the show is so much better when its about stopping terrorists, and not about conspiracy hunting.

Now that I've got that off my chest, I want to talk about what I liked about this season. To begin with, I liked the change in venue to D.C. This gave us a fresh perspective and set the stage with an interesting side story about Jack testifying before Congress. When I saw that Tony was coming back, I was intrigued. Unfortunately, as mentioned before, this didn't quite pan out. Still, it was interesting up until the point he became bad again. I was having a blast rooting for him to destroy Hodges' missiles. I also enjoyed his secret mission with Bill and Chloe, even if the circumstances of his return were sketchy at best.

Add to this the story arc of Dubaku and Sangala. These ideas seemed fresh and interesting. I felt that Dubaku was a compelling and believable villain with logical motivations (unlike all of these conspiracy storylines). The episodes about stopping Dubaku were great, even if the CIP Device was a silly idea. My biggest regret here is that Dubaku died in the hospital, rather than Jack, Tony, Bill, etc. killing him. They do this kind of thing too often, I think.

Off Topic Side Note: In Season 3, Saunders was a former SAS man and Jack was a former Delta operative. Am I the only one who sees the missed potential here? Their final battle could have been the best in the series.

To answer the question posed in the title of this review, I think the wheels fell off when Juma and his crew showed up. This is the point, I think, where it stopped feeling like 24 and became more like a summer action flick. There are a lot more things I could complain about and praise, but I think I've laid out enough reasoning as to why I think this was on track to be a spectacular season, but ended up being so-so.",1262217600,2,5231,4.470157068062827

3017290,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"After the horrendous Season 6 on it seemed time for Jack Bauer to retire but hold on, Season 7 is just about as good as any I've so far. I'm not one to watch this show on a weekly basis, I'd much rather wait until the end of the year and watch all 24 episodes on DVD in less than a week: no commercials, no waiting days for cliffhangers to be solved. Sure, after such marathons you end up listening to the 24 theme and Jack uttering the words ""previously on 24"" in your dreams, but that's not so bad really.
THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT SEASON 7
#1 Jack's as great as ever, if maybe a bit more complex character with all the discussions about the evils of torture, hey, if in guessing, real life politicians batted 1.000 like Jack maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea to allow it though that doesn't seem very likely. Anyway, Keifer is going to need a throat transplant from all the yelling sooner rather than later but it seem worth it.
#2 The excelent President Taylor, unquestionably the best 24 president since Palmer (not Wayne obviously). She's just like Hillary without the pantsuits. This fictional character is the best way to learn it was a good thing that Hillary didn't become president, after all, wouldn't it have been horrible to refer to Bill as ""the first gentleman"" like they mention here all season long ?
# 3 Good Tony / Bad Tony. Like most 24 fans, my stomach twisted when Tony's true nature was revealed but to my surprise the last few episodes I learn to accept it and the way the writers tied things up at the very end wasn't so terrible. To name Tony's resurrection as contrived is definetely an understatment but hey, maybe this means there is hope for Edgar fans all over the world.
# 4 Much fewer eye-rolling moments than in past seasons though it was hard to accept the best way the 24 writers could think of a White House infiltration is underwater. If you've ever taken the tour of the place, like I have, you may not remmember any bodies of water in the vecinity.
# 5 Oldie characters popping all the time: Aaron the no nonesense bodyguard and his ever present ear-piece-phone-cable. Chloe the most beloved insuferable TV character in history. Morris, the second one in that very same list.
Even Kim Bauer's participation wasn't that obnoxious !
My only complaint: one of the things I love most about 24 is how they bring good-unknown actors to their parts which really helps in the veracity department(see Agent's Walker and Moss, the evil technician who looks like an adult version of Agent Cody Banks, etc.) thus I hate ""special star appearances"" as the only effect they bringis making you think to yourself, Oh, there's John Voight !, Oh, there's Dennis Hooper !. This type of casting does not work, not on 24 for sure.",1260403200,,2748,4.509018036072145

3017293,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"After a controversial Season 6 (2007), that featured a nuclear explosion on American soil, a Bauer family conspiracy, and an assortment of untidy loose ends, there was substantial fan dissatisfaction with the direction 24 had taken.  The writers' strike in 2008, derailed production of 24 for that year, giving the writers time to try and develop the story they already had, and deliver a winner.

Set in Washington D.C., Day 7 is indeed a fresh start, after six seasons in southern California. The timeline has moved several years past the nuclear incident, and Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) is testifying before a Senate committee, when he is taken into custody by FBI agent Renee Walker (Anne Wersching), who seeks his help in tracking down Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard), believed to have been killed back in Day 5.

Thus begins what is a return to a more traditional 24 adventure.  Unlike Day 6, where Bauer was off balance and questioning himself, Jack is totally committed to the job at hand, and willing to do whatever it takes.  Contrasting this is Rene Walker, Bauer's companion for much of the day.  She rises to the meet the day's crisis, but is conflicted by having to employ Bauer's methods, that while morally questionable, usually produce the desired results.  Her behavior is frustrating to her boss, Larry Moss (Jeffery Nordling), and her gradual, at times disturbing, and perhaps tragic transformation, is one of the season's key story elements.  The pacing is mostly brisk, the characters interesting, and the acting edgy and mostly believable.  There are plenty of the kind of plot twists, surprises, and sudden deaths, viewers have come to expect, topped off with an (for now) ambiguous ending, that helps to wash away some of the bad aftertaste from Day 6.

Besides Almeida, characters returning from previous seasons include Chloe O'Brian (Mary Lynn Rajskub), Bill Buchanan (James Morrison), Aaron Pierce (Glenn Morshower), Morris O'Brian (Carlo Rota), and Kim Bauer (Elisha Cuthbert).  24 has always featured a tremendously talented cast, and Day 7 is no exception, with Cherry Jones, Jeffery Nordling, Janeane Garofalo, Bob Gunton, Sprague Graydon, Hakeem Kae-Kazim, Enuka Okuma, Ravi Kapoor, and Jon Voight.

24 Redemption a two hour prequel to Day 7, focused on the events in the African nation of Sangala, and introduced President Allison Taylor (Jones), Jonas Hodges (Voight), Colonel Ike Dubaku (Kazim), General Juma (Tony Todd) and Chief of Staff Ethan Kanin (Gunton), setting the stage for the events in Day 7.

Typically, Day 7 involves several major story arcs.  One involves the penetration of a government computer system, by terrorists who threaten the nation's air traffic control system.  Bauer and Walker work to stop the terrorists, and uncover a conspiracy that involves members of the federal government.  Sangalan General Juma leads an audacious assault on the White House, taking the President hostage, and threatening to cut her daughter Olivia's eyes out.  A beloved character makes the ultimate sacrifice, leaving Jack shaken, as this story arc closes.

There is still much more to come, as Jonas Hodges spearheads a plot by the private security company Starkwood, to employ a biological weapon that was developed in Sangala.  And Tony Almedia has much unfinished business to attend to.  Jack's exposure to a biological pathogen, is life-threatening, and gradually affects his ability to function.  The arrival of Kim Bauer, provides a slim hope for Jack's survival.  The finale is a massive emotional ride, with evil mastermind Alan Wilson (Will Patton) taken into custody, Jack and Renee having a deep heart to heart, the first family's drama in the White House, and Jack seeking absolution for his sins.  With Bauer in a coma and Kim by his side, the final dispensation of ""justice"" rests in another's hands.

In Day 7, reality is stretched and molded in manners normal for 24, and there are some rough spots, and a few totally illogical developments.  The setting in the vicinity of the Capitol, features mostly urban locations.  Still, those troubled by the trends in Day 6, and Day 5, may find the more focused storytelling in Day 7 more palatable and satisfying.  Kiefer Sutherland delivers another powerful performance, tough but also vulnerable.  Carlos Bernard transitions several times in Tony's bittersweet ""it's about justice"" return.  Anne Wersching has the challenging role and pivotal role as Agent Renee Walker, and her performance is powerful and compelling.  She fades a bit in the third quarter, but finishes strongly after taking over from Larry Moss.  There are many other standout performers, including Sprague Graydon, Jon Voight, Cherry Jones, Bob Gunton, Janeane Garofalo, Elisha Cuthbert, and as always Glenn Morshower as solid as a rock, Aaron Pierce.

As in previous seasons, a number of episodes have a commentary track.  Most are mildly informative, though some are more animated (Carlos Bernard), or amusing (Glenn Morshower), although unfortunately Sutherland, Jones,  Graydon, Voight, and Garofalo do not participate.  Among the extras are some deleted scenes, the best of which is a powerful, expanded initial meeting between Kim and Jack.  ""24-7 The Untold Story"" is a featurette detailing the writers' travails attempting to get the series back on track, after Day 6.  Perhaps only a program with the huge gravitas of 24, could afford to make such an admission.  Of interest is how the prequel 24 Redemption, ended up meshing nicely with the events in Day 7.

Well, I must say it was neatly done and greatly appreciated in my collection of all 7 series that do take up a lot of room.  Season 7 was well-written and, as usual, a very timely theme.  It was a slap in the face of critics of extreme violence in 24, leading up to a lame season 6, toned down and boring to satisfy those that think there is more violence in 24 than there is in Family Guy.  They just don't get it.  The world is, obviously, a violent place to live now.  This came out pre-Guantanamo Bay closure and indictments for waterboarding and other forms of getting the information needed to protect this country regardless of the means.  Jack is Jack - there is no one like him and never will be, and he is not ashamed one bit for doing what he has had to do to ""save the world"" in every season.  Yes, the end does justify the means in matters of world terroism.  And throughout Season 7, Jack just put his head up, chin out, and told everyone he came in contact with that he would never have done anything differently.  I was shocked by the closure of CTU, kept trying to figure out what was going on with Tony, and respected those who came to understand what Jack is all about.  The series can be summed up in one scene where the President askes Jack if she can trust him, and he says - head held high - ""With all due respect, Madam President, ask around.""  I will always think Season 1 was the best, but will watch 24 until the executives take it off the air.  Jack is, and always will be, my hero.",1256947200,,1598,4.166123778501628

3017304,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"I have to admit, after a lackluster sixth season and what I thought was a disappointing TV movie (""24: Redemption""), I was worried that ""24""'s glory days were behind it. My confidence wasn't restored very much by the first eight episodes of season seven, either, which just seemed to be a rehash of all the same tired cliches from previous seasons. And then I had to leave the U.S. and didn't see the rest of the season until I returned recently and watched them on DVD. But I have to say, season seven improved greatly after the first episodes (the reason for this is explained by the writers on an extra on the DVDs), and the season as a whole definitely met my hopeful expectations. Jonas Hodges (Jon Voigt) was the best villain they've had in years, and turning Tony into an ambiguous figure (is he good or evil?) was an inspired turn for the series. And I loved the introduction of some truly positive Muslim characters for a change. It definitely proved to me that there's still life in ""24"" yet.

As for the DVD presentation, it is good but not up to the standards of the other seasons. While there are a few extra features and 14 deleted scenes, the deleted scenes pale in comparison to what was offered on previous ""24"" sets, which usually had literally dozens of deleted scenes. And also, what happened to the option to watch the deleted scenes within the episodes in which they appeared? On this set, you can only watch them as extras on the last disc - in every other season except for the first, you have the option to watch them at the end or else embedded within the season itself, which to me is much preferable and is one of the things which made the ""24"" sets unique. Perhaps the rush to get the season 7 set out as soon as it was finished airing, as opposed to releasing it several months later as was traditional, accounts for this drawback. Perhaps Fox is planning to release a special ""deluxe"" set for season 7 in the future which will have more deleted scenes - which wouldn't be surprising given their propensity for milking the hardcore fans for every penny they can get (such as the ""Special Edition"" of season 6 which was a blatant ripoff).

In short, a great year for ""24,"" but less than great for the producers of these DVDs.",1254787200,,2254,4.455205811138015

3017310,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"After a lengthy hiatus, Jack finally has another really bad day. I don't know how many more times Jack gets himself out only to be pulled back into the counter-terrorism gig, but 24: SEASON 7 demonstrates that there are still legs on this thing. In the show's internal continuity, four years have elapsed since the events in Season 6, and in the interim Jack had roamed from place to place in search of some kind of inner peace. Except I'm guessing that wasn't ever gonna work out.

The damnable writers' strike of 2007-08 delayed Season 7 for one year - which, as it turns out, was a blessing in disguise for the writers of 24 as they'd been stuck for ideas - and it wasn't until the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24-Redemption/dp/B001DMVZOE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24: Redemption</a>&nbsp;television movie came out that I finally became convinced that there really was gonna be a seventh year. I frankly thought 24 was done. But here's Jack Bauer again, scarred and wracked with guilt, his methods condemned, still saving the world.

As mentioned, four years had passed, and things haven't stayed the same. There's a new American President, a woman. CTU had been shut down, its tactics questioned and its operatives scattered. In Washington, D.C., Jack Bauer is on the verge of being indicted for past acts of brutality. But then a daring, broad daylight kidnapping puts Jack's trial on hold as the FBI seeks his expertise. Especially since one of the kidnappers is identified as Jack's old friend Tony Almeida, who isn't quite as deceased as everyone had assumed. From there, things quickly worsen.

I think it's a boost in the arm, switching things up, moving to D.C. and taking CTU out of the equation and putting in the FBI as Jack's new intel and tech support - although one character would refer to the FBI agency as ""CTU Lite."" This introduces a running theme (and a hot button topic), that of Jack's ruthlessly doing whatever it takes to achieve his objective versus the FBI's strictly by the book methods. There's a new supporting cast brought in, with FBI agent Renee Walker impacting Jack the most. Agent Walker, in some ways, demonstrates how someone, under extreme duress and in light of horrific circumstances, can be swayed into adopting Jack's perspective. Her boss and friend cautions her: ""Renee, we're FBI, not CTU. We honor the law."" But how do you hold back when the price of idealism is possibly thousands of murdered lives? The most startling thing for me, though, may have been when Janeane Garafalo shows up as an FBI computer analyst. Talk about wonderful counter-casting.

Season 7 basically unfolds in three stages, starting out as a follow up to 24: REDEMPTION as Jack and the FBI go up against the murderous warlord of Sangala. 24 still reeks of extreme paranoia and pervasive conspiracies, so it shouldn't be a surprise when Jack and Walker learn that things go much deeper than the Sangalan plot. There are layers and layers of duplicity.

In another front, there's good focus on the President, effectively portrayed by Cherry Jones, as the American government once again falls under siege. There are sub-plots involving the suicide of her son and the alienation of her daughter. And, as usual, you never quite know who you can trust in the White House, in that most elite inner circle.

It's pretty cool that Carlos Bernard is back, which means that Tony Almeida is back, or rather a darker, even more smoldering version of Tony. But it's almost like old times seeing him and Jack side by side again. They're eventually joined by other familiar faces, including one of my old favorites, Glenn Morshower, as straight-shooting Special Agent Aaron Pierce, the only guy other than Kiefer to have appeared in all of the seasons so far.

Political intrigue, deadly espionage, riveting human drama, that blurring of ethics. 24 continues to be one of the best - if not THE best - thrill rides on television. That ominous beat we hear each time we glimpse the digital clock counting down, it's still pulse pounding to me. As the episodes progress, I fall in line with the pervasive mood of the show, and I trust no one and I constantly look for twists because there are plot reversals everywhere. We're still treated to storytelling that is complex and both plot and character driven, and the series still rides on the strength of its technical merits. And, except for Jack, each character in the show is expendable. Key players bite the bullet. Jack's actions provoke debate even as he remains the best guy out there to clean up the mess.

24: SEASON 7 comes in six discs, with a cast & crew audio commentary on a whopping 12 episodes: ""8am-9am"" (Producer/Director Jon Cassar & actor Carlos Bernard); ""10am-11am"" (Producers Manny Coto & Brannon Braga, & Carlos Bernard); ""12pm-1pm"" (Producer/Director Jon Cassar & actor Annie Wersching); ""4pm-5pm"" (Producer David Fury & actor Hakeem Kae-Kazim); ""5pm-6pm"" (Producers Manny Coto & Brannon Braga, & Annie Wersching); ""7pm-8pm"" (Producer/Director Brad Turner & actor Tony Todd); ""8pm-9pm"" (Producer/Director Brad Turner, Composer Sean Callery, & actor James Morrison); ""9pm-10pm"" (Producers Evan Katz & Juan Carlos Moto, actors Annie Wersching & Bob Gunton); ""1am-2am"" (Producer Howard Gordon, Carlos Bernard, & Jeffrey Nordling); ""5am-6am"" (Producer Evan Katz, actors Mary Lynn Rajskub & Glenn Morshower); ""6am-7am"" (Producers David Fury, Alex Gansa, and actor Glenn Morshower); and ""7am-8am""(Producers Howard Gordon & Jon Cassar). It's always fun soaking in the actors' behind-the-scene commentaries, but I'm wondering how come Kiefer didn't drop by for a few words?

Other special features include: 14 deleted scenes with optional commentary from Producers Stephen Kronish & Paul Gadd (including an emotional 6-minute scene with Kiefer and a familiar face); ""The Fimucite Festival Presents: The Music of 24"" - Composer/conductor Sean Callery and the Tenerife Film Orchestra & Choir perform the score from 24 live at the Guimer Theater in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Canary Islands (13 minutes long); ""Hour 19: The Ambush"" - we follow the f/x crew as they prep to blow up a building near the L.A.X. area (12:45 minutes); and ""24-7: The Untold Story"" - the show's writers reflect on the disappointment of Season 6, on the need for the show to reinvent itself, and then on the long, strenuous struggle to come up with a working story for Season 7 (almost 16 minutes long).

Some things to look out for and maybe even savor:

- First and foremost, Jack just being Jack, getting the job done, inhabiting that grey moral area; Kiefer Sutherland rules all

- Tony Almeida alive and very much in the thick of things

- The ongoing Ugly Chick Cyber War between Garafalo and Mary Lynn Rajskub

- Yet another indecisive turnip for an American Vice-President (I don't know, 24 seems to enjoy featuring VPs who hem and haw)

- If you're a fan of POPULAR, then nostalgia might kick in as Carly Pope shows up for a few episodes; oddly enough, her character's name is still Sam

- One of the no-nonsense bad guys looks like a leaner, meaner Tracy Morgan",1253318400,6,7158,4.997481108312343

3017318,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"Off its heels of its worst season yet, the seventh season of ""24"" was given high expectations by fans and critics alike even more than when Season 5 ended back in 2006 (the show's best season by far).  While it met most of its expectations and then didn't, it was a surprise return to form as a show that everyone was starting to think was about to kick the bucket returned with a tour de force attitude.

Like any other ""24"" season, however, it suffers from filler, outrageous plotlines, but most of them are absent this time, almost equaling (but not quite) the amount of filler and ridiculous plotlines of season 5 (there were hardly any in that season).

Unlike the previous season, the new cast in season 7 is exciting, engaging, and engrossing.  We finally get a new female Jack Bauer, Renee Walker, but she just isn't quite there yet, she has a hard time going above the law to save her country.  Her former lover and boss, Larry Moss, heads her FBI unit, who is totally against the man that is Jack Bauer, but over the day, learns that Jack Bauer isn't an evil man, he's trying to save his country.

Cherry Jones commands her role as President Allison Taylor, who is the most liberal president ever featured on ""24"", and a nice departure from the usual president on ""24"".  She's the most free of corruption out of any of the character on the show, and a leader that might be too good to be true in the real world.  Carlos Bernard returns from the dead as Tony Almedia, which was a very controversial decision, but it played out okay in the end.

More favorites from previous seasons like Chloe O'Brian and Bill Buchanan return as well, but like with all ""24"" seasons, key characters and characters we have grown to love and admire are killed off unexpectedly, and even the heroes suffer a fate this time around that might be unavoidable.

I'd recommend renting this product or have seen it first before your purchase it, but all in all, this season was pretty damn good.  It'd be a shame to miss it.",1252022400,,2007,4.471232876712329

Admittedly some plot points were predictable, but you come to expect that from any TV show.

The cover was also far better than season 6 (WTF?) with a long shot of Jack - and the box!

3017322,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"Honestly, I feel that Season Seven may have been the best season yet. Of course I have my complaints about it, and I'll run through my complaints quickly:

1: The story of Season 7 basically pretended Season 6 never happened. Probably due to the critical reception of Season 6. But there was a lot more continuity from Season 5, and most of the major storylines of Season 6 were ignored.

2: Janis Gold, Janeane Garafalo's character: Janeane Garafalo can be an okay actress, but I don't think her performance was up to the standards of 24. Also, her character barely even did anything meaningful, other than a few fun exchanges with Chloe.

3, the biggest one: The ending of the season. It was exactly the ending I expected, and it left all the loose ends hanging. After such a strong season, anyone who wanted any kind of closure at the end will be sorely disappointed. I know 24 is kinda known for that, but not to the level that Season 7 had.

But all that said, Season 7 was still fantastic. As for what was good about the season, I don't even know where to start. The new setting, Washington D.C. was a great backdrop and brought something new and fresh to the series. The new actors brought in were fantastic. Everyone was talking about Cherry Jones as President Allison Taylor, but personally I was more excited about the first gentleman Henry Taylor, played by Colm Feore. I've always been a fan of Feore and his storyline was very good. Renee Walker was also a great new character. I was also very excited by the returns of two of my favorite characters in the series, Tony Almeida and Kim Bauer, both of whom we didn't see in Season 6.

The villains were amazing. My favorites were Jonas Hodges (played by Jon Voight), Ike Dubaku and the aforementioned Tony (who switched between being a good guy and bad guy several times this season. With mood swings like that you'd think he was suffering from PMS or something). But the other villains were great as well.

I could go on and on about the greatness of this season. But I'll just sum it up by saying, you have to see it if you haven't. It was incredible.

As for the omission of the 7th disk, which usually has the extras, that wasn't too big of an issue. There are still extras. There's audio commentary for 12 episodes, as well as three featurettes (spread around with one each on disk 1, disk 5, and disk 6). There are deleted scenes as well, but not quite as many as previous seasons. Overall, they definitely could've included more extras, and just put them on disks 2, 3 and 4 where there weren't any. The 7th disk wasn't necessary.

Speaking of which, I remember when the first reviewers posted their reviews for this DVD, they all complained about the packaging. Because it wasn't the same as the older boxed sets and they omitted the seventh disk. But now that the DVD has been out for a while, people are actually buying it and noticing how great the packaging really is. It's really the best packaging job ever for a multi-disk DVD. This should be the way all TV series' are released on DVD. In fact, they should re-release all 6 previous seasons of 24 in this style of packaging. Just spread the special features among the 6 disks rather than having a 7th disk, like they did for this.

Overall, great season, great packaging. Extras could've been better, but that's a minor gripe. Definitely get this one from Amazon as the price (as I'm writing this), $22.99 is by far the best price you can find for a new copy. Just buy this with an additional cheap item (like a 24: Declassified paperback) to bump the price over $25 and get free shipping as well! Highly recommended.",1251763200,2,3645,4.502269288956127
3017323,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"In fact, when I bought season 7 of 24, I already have seen the serie on a streaming site available in France.

As it was not French subtiltled, I must admit I lost some parts of the action because of my poor understanding of English (obviously not when Ivorian actor Isaak de Banchole spoke in French with the actress assumed to be his wife, both being legal Executives of fictious state of Sangala).

But I think I understood the majority of the action (it's not very difficult) and I appreciated all the show, waiting eagerly each week for a new episode.

As I saw that the DVD was released in the US the morning after the last episode was released, with French subtitles and at a very moderate price (and the level of the US dollar compared to to the Euro is from some help), I couldn't prevent myself to buy it, so that my wife could see the season and understand it.

In France, it will be aired beginning 10th of September, on a cable channel, and not released in DVD before at least one year.

The only added value I will get with this cable channel is to see Redemption, with French subtitles and keep it in the case of season seven (if I could find some place because of the packaging !) I have bought a second examplaryof 24 season 7 on Amazon to offer to a friend, fan like us of 24.

If you liked or disliked the seventh season or what happened in it doesn't really matter to me.  I wanted to hear more about the quality of the Blu-ray than who Jack Bauer killed.

I have not seen the season and was waiting to buy it on Blu-Ray before I watched it until I saw on the front package that it was a 6 disc set.  WTF???  When I saw that I put it back down and walked away mad as hell!  My PlayStation 3 does a great job of upgrading my tv shows on DVD to the point were I don't need to buy Blu-ray disc yet and can wait until the price drops.  HOWEVER, the one reason I would purchase a tv show on Blu-ray is because the whole season should be on only ONE, maybe TWO disc being it holds 25GB of data per disc.  I don't want to play around with changing disc when I don't have to.

I have all the seasons of Married with Children (except the last season which comes out in November) and I know all the espoides from each season would fit on only ONE disc and that's what I want.  I want that with all the tv shows I would buy on Blu-ray and won't purchase a tv show on Blu-ray until that's how it is.

My issue is that 24 should consist of only two disc and that's it.  Why do I have to fumble with 6 disc like I would have to with DVDs?  I saw target had each season on DVD for $19 each and that's what I'm going to buy.  I'm pissed that I waited so long for 24 to be on Blu-ray just to have to go buy it on DVD instead.

Yes, there are a few times that it's a bit preposterous (i.e. the storming of the White House???). But complaining about such things is like complaining that water is wet - you knew that going in, so why are you surprised?

The first 5-6 episodes were my favorites, as it had a ""let's put the band back together"" feeling. ""Looks, there's Jack!"" ""And Bill and Chloe!"" ""And Tony! - hey, isn't he dead?"" The middle bogged down a bit, especially with the aforementioned WH scenes, but then the last 4-5 episodes really picked back up. The best part of '24' is guessing who the traitors are, and who's on the up-and-up. They did a good job of camouflaging the bad guy(s), and it came as a shock even to me when the turnabout was played. Cool!

Thus, I bought it after reading the reviews offered here before I jumped the gun, so to speak. This review is intended to introduce new viewers as well as entice existing, but jaded viewers after a disappointing sixth season.

`24' is a seven-year-long television series about an anti-hero, Jack Bauer (played by real-life, testosterone, alpha-male, Kiefer Sutherland). He used to head the now defunct, de-listed, Counter-Terrorist Unit or CTU. In other words, over-worked, under-paid civil servants who lead secret lives about what they do (and may be eager to do it all over again, given the secret handshake).

In each episode (beginning at 8.00am), which lasts one hour (`real time') per episode, we witness the multitude of news-making, events that lead up to the last hour of the day. Essentially, the premise of this series is a doomsday plot that has subversives intending to overthrow a leadership, or destroy public property, or harm lives. Not very optimistic scenarios - definitely controversial, and leverages on our current fears and conspiracy theories.

I admit I was glued to this box set. Predictably, as we have grown to appreciate, there is a surprise or revelation in each hour. Stay awake though, or you be thrown off-guard! The question on our mind is: Will Jack save the day? (After six seminal seasons, we are now on a first-name basis). Can the day get any worst? Apparently, it can. Murphy's Law has been upgraded to Vista proportions!

Jack Bauer, once a hero is now a rogue agent has the choice to leave his past behind (and keep running). However, he seems drawn to tough choices that connect his sense of humanity with `doing the right thing'. His personal values attract him to these life-threatening situations that coaxes the viewer to ask: `Why me?' Such is the schedule of the supra-hero who destiny is to save the world. Oh, by the way, his sense of rescuing the world has led him to making painful sacrifices (physically and emotionally). There is a price to pay for the choices he makes. Either's Bauer's karma is to continue to save the world until his expiration date, or we wonder - hey, this guy has bad timing when it comes to his timetable! To add insult to injury, according to one bad character on one season: `Why is it that people around you tend to die?'

The character, Lieutenant John McClane on the Die Hard franchise, has a similar stroke of karmic disarray. He tends, too, to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. His consolation is: `Someone has to do it!' Either these anti-heroes are too competent, they can get `down and dirty', or they need to get a personal assistant.

Isn't it ironical that, sometimes, the choices we make are based on those we care for? Aren't choices easier to make when these pertain to us? Isn't being selfish easier than being considerate and generous? There are truly some very hard decisions to make in life.

You can choose to buy this set if you have not watched it. The plot is fast-paced as expected. The plot is more believable and possible, not merely plausible. There is more density to each of the key characters we have grown to relate. The kicker is what happens to Bauer in the last few hours. Plus, it all takes place in the capitol. Will there be an eighth season? I suspect so, and I look forward to more creative outputs from the writers.",1250553600,,3435,4.696013289036545

I stopped watching the Season 7 broadcast as soon as Tony showed up. But, out of loyalty, I decided I should see the whole thing. I'm glad I checked it out of the library and didn't waste my money on it.

It's sort of sad to see one of your favorite shows fall to such depths, but at least one can remember the better times. Season 1 was a compelling conceptual start. Season 2 saw the show at its peak, then a slow gradual decline through Season 5, but it was still very good. And then the cliff. I think I'll try to forget the last two seasons and say my farewell to Jack Bauer as he took a slow boat to China at the end of Season 5.",1249862400,3,655,3.8805970149253732
3017335,1,B000Y7ZBZS,"I love 24, and I watched all seasons on disk, because I like to watch a few episodes at once, without commercials, etc.
7th season BD set is HORRIBLE.
2 things that make it bad - super slow loading time and over - sharpened noisy digital transfer.

The first one is just a pain. I have a Samsung player, 2 week old upgrade of the firmware, and most disks load within 20 seconds. This set loads - I am not kidding you - 5 minutes each disk!! Basically, I come home, turn it on first thing, and go to the kitchen to micro a burrito, pop a beer, come back - it's still loading, i check my email, do stretches, and only then i hear the sound of Menu showing up, so I sit down to watch it. And mind you - this loading takes place EVERY TIME you do anything with the disk - since it's connected via HDMI (bi-directional)- I once decided to switch TV to HDMI cable to check DVR recordings - BAD IDEA. Bluray player knows I interrupted my interest - it stops the disk. There is no resume on this disk either. If you stopped in the middle of the show - if you switched disks or anything - it's LOADING TIME again. And back to the Menu.
If you think it's my player - think again - I watch tons of bluray disks on it, and only some give me such headaches - this set is one of them. And for what!!!! The Menu is just plain old Gzooonk-gzooonk with the ""24"" signature Clunking Sound (I love this part actually).

The picture is somehow dotty - as if 1080 was too much for it - can't really tell. I have a very good new TV set, and things look very nice and smooth normally. this is a minor thing, of course, since it doesn't distract from viewing.

One more thing. Some ""genius"" decided to stick a special about the score onto the very 1st disk - it's a great special, but BEWARE - there are images from further episodes and they are spoilers!

I hope the disk authoring company would take a look at reviews and do a better job next time.
The show is great nevertheless!",1249603200,6,1957,4.101827676240209

they should receive some kind of negative award for it.

Carlos Bernard as Tony Almeida is awesome to. Would like to see this guy in future tough guy spy roles like Bourne Identity. Annie Wersching as Renee Walker starts off slow but ends up pulling off the tough chick with a gun performance. The powers that be for 24 must have a thing for redheads because just about every lead female actress in this series is a redhead. The guy playing agent Larry Moss is a real weenie, so much that I think they wanted him to look weak just to make Jack Bauer look tougher than he already is.

The S7 DVD set is somewhat lacking in the special features compared to the previous 6 Seasons. If you bought S7, I highly recommend that you also get Redemption as that as all fans of the show knows is a prequel to S7!!

At first this season was slightly slow in the beginning but after the first plot is resolved, it gets somewhat more hectic. While it does not maybe reach the heights of frenzy of earlier seasons, it does get quite agitated in the second half. It is also slightly less violent than season 6 which makes it less nasty which is good. Then on the other hand there is a lot of ""torture is not ok but i still do it"" blabla by Jack Bauer and even others. This season also does not have the previous series' potential for racist accusations since now the terrorists are homegrown. This also leads to a slightly oversentimental episode involving some innocent arabs taken into the plot...my my my...otherwise it is impressively acted and directed. The only question as always is why the terrorists never kill Bauer...Ok there would be no series I agree but at times this is slightly unbelievable.

However, this show needs to get rid of the whole presidents storyline.  This new one was just aweful, the lady can't act, and she's not as commanding looking as the guy from The Unit.  Now that he's been gone and Logan's storyline is concluded, they should just go a different route; without a president storyline.  The only good thing about this one was that Aaron apprears and does some stuff.  Also bring back agent Doyle(Ricky Schroeder)for the next seasonda nd maybe have him and jack in intertwining stories.  But no more politics.  It gets old having a terrorist in each season holding the presidnet hostage or blackmailing him.  Just do CTU stuff; the field and the base.  No more presidnet storyulines please the last lady killed it for me.  But I'll still watch it.  Although if the presidnet stuff continues, I'll just record it and watch it later.

Actually, this season should be known as the Bush-bashing season. I'm no fan of Bush but the writers were so transparent as they dredged up every liberal point of contention. Starkwood (Black Water) and all defense contractors are evil! Coercive interrogation is evil! Recognizing the fact that Muslims are the main cause of terrorism around the world is evil! And, last but not least, stem cell techniques could save us all from everything (if only for the evil Mr. Bush). They even mentioned declaring someone an enemy combatant so they could do anything they wanted to them (cheap reference to Gitmo). Gee, did the writers miss anything? Oh, and giving Janeane Garofalo, of all people, a venue to parade her handwringing liberalism was a deliberate slap at 24's overwhelmingly conservative audience. Liberals just can't pass up a chance to shove their crap in your face.

Moving the show to Washington DC was a good change of scenery...if only they had kept it in DC.  FYI, there is no such as thing as the Port of Alexandria.  The nearest port capable of handling those shipping containers is Baltimore.  Minor point I know and I'm sure a lot of LA residents had similar points about seasons 1-6.

As for the plot.  It had promise to start with.  Bauer brought back to get preached to by holier-than-thou Senators about his behavior with the now disbanded CTU.  Then there is a terrorist threat (surprise).  Bauer gets called to the FBI to be an expert because Tony Almedia (back from the dead) is apparently behind it!!!  Shock!...yeah I totally didn't buy that.

So Bauer teams up with Agent Walker who is at a fork in the road...does she follow Bauer into the ""at any cost"" way of preventing terrorists or does she follow the laws that may hinder the investigation?  It was a nice reflection of what is going on in the country right now.

That's really where my praise for the season ends.  Spoilers ahead.

The plot twists...saw them coming a mile away.  Why?  They've all been done before and they were so set up that there was no surprise.  Especially Tony's multiple plot twists.  Totally unbelieveable, even for 24.
The First Dude's plotline for the first half of the season...really didn't care.  That doesn't make me cold, it just added nothing to the season.
The attack on the White House?  Yeah....uh huh.  I'm all for suspending reality to watch 24 but when its so over the top that we're in a totally different dimension, you've lost my interest.

And we had another season where the real bad guys are evil white American guys trying to control the nation.  Its time to get off this conspiracy stuff.  Seasons 1 and 4 were the only seasons when it was dedicated counterterrorism instead of unraveling a giant conspiracy.

There was also a noticable lack of action in this season.  There were maybe 3-4 firefights?  They had the opportunity to have so much more action but failed.  This is 24, not a soap opera...enough of the ""will she/won't she"" on whether Agent Walker will go with Jack.  Enough of the teary-eyed moments of self-reflection.

Hopefully, Season 8 will have Jack Bauer interrogating the writers for Season 7 so he can learn the location of the real writers and he'll go rescue them in time for Season 9.

For example, he never EATS, he of course never SLEEPS, he does not even have a GLASS OF WATER, he does not - perish forbid! - go to the TOILET... Should he venture into such a commonplace location, it will be in order to have yet another of his deadly fights! He does not go to the restaurant to EAT like the rest of us either. No! He only goes there to have a royal shootout with terrorists. No kidding! There is less action in one of my DECADES than there is for Jack Bauer in a single DAY at the office. I tell you this guy is not quite like us! Presently I doubt that he is truly human... You see, I have deducted that he is really an Extraterrestrial. His species only lives ten days, so they have to pack everything into a day! Watch 24 to get the idea. And get ready for another-lifetime-in-a-day season 8!",1245283200,,975,4.109947643979058

I haven't been purchasing the individual box sets but, rest assured, as soon as the show discontinues and they have a complete box set of all seasons, I'll have it!

There is some grain and light noise throughout the season, but it is never distracting. The image detail is much better than previous seasons of 24 on DVD. The DTS Master Audio track is also a significant upgrade from the Dolby Digital tracks that accompany the DVD releases. While 24 season 7 doesn't look as good as seasons of Lost do on BluRay, it is still a noticeable improvement over the DVD and worth owning.",1244764800,,558,4.470588235294118
3017387,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"Firstly, the long wait for this 7th season of 24 was well worth it. Keifer Sutherland and the cast and crew really pulled out all the stops with this newest day of terror. You start off immediately by finding out that CTU has been disbanded and it's 4 years from the events of season 6. Jack Bauer, played by Keifer Sutherland, is on trial for his various crimes and infractions built up by the previous seasons. But the trial is interrupted by FBI agent Renee Walker, played by Annie Wersching, saying that Jack is needed to help out with a priority situation. A rash of attacks built up to a kidnapping perpetrated by the supposedly deceased Tony Almeida, played by Carlos Bernard.

Now for die hard fans of 24, they'll remember in season 5 that Almeida was not given the traditional silent countdown usually given to a hero who has died. So fans were speculating that Tony would be revived in some way shape or form. In the meantime we do see reappearances of the following characters, mind you the character list includes the amazing actors who played them.

Bill Buchanan - James Morrison
  -- Morrison provides audio commentary on an episode

Chloe O Brian - Mary Lynn Rajskub
  -- Rajskub also provides an audio commentary

Morris O Brian - Carlo Rota

Now for those who have seen and bought the prequel movie, 24-Redemption, they'll remember the chain of events leading up to season 7. Keep in mind, it is not exactly necessary for viewers to have watched the prequel movie, but it does help in back story for events dealing with the white house and the new president played brilliantly by Cherry Jones.

This season is the most action packed, story driven, character driven, cliffhanger of a season that 24 has ever produced. You see new main characters, you see the deaths of multiple characters. I won't spoil too many details for newer viewers of the show. But we also get the inclusion into the villainy by two top notch actors, Will Patton and most importantly the incredible Jon Voight.

And you'll definitely get irked as I did at the ending of season 7. For that is the ultimate cliffhanger. Jack Bauer has made sacrifice after sacrifice to protect his country. He's lost almost everything he could have ever lost. And in the process of defending his country for day 7, he gets infected by a weaponized gas that has no known cure. Jack Bauer lays dying. His daughter Kim, played by Elisha Cuthbert, arrives to say goodbye to Jack. But Kim isn't ready to let her father go.

All I'll say no is that it'd better not take as long to give us the answers in season 8.",1244764800,,2579,4.582608695652174

This gets painful to watch over a few episodes, but HALF THE SEASON???? And then to end up in a coma???
2. He's riddled with guilt over his methods that are no longer politically correct with our new presidential administration. Let's all sit around and hold hands with the bad guys... while they 7conveniently slit out throats and laugh at our good intentions! Gimme a break!
3. And...he's popping up in commercial breaks to tell us how to make our lives even ""greener""...Thank you, Al Gore.

However, every single new character is generic and boring to the ears and the eyes. This also sums up season 7. It tries with a decent opener, but the rest of the season is a snooze-fest.

3017394,5,B000Y7ZBZS,can't wait for season 8 we didn't watch this on regular tv we waited for the dvd to come out great!!!!!!,1243987200,,104,4.0
3017395,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"I hadn't watched one episode of ""24"" during its first six seasons. That was until this year when the seventh season of the Emmy Award winning show made its long awaited premiere (the seventh season was suppost to have aired last year but was pushed back because of the writer's strike). The Fox network moved one of my favorite shows, ""House, M.D."", from Tuesday nights to Monday nights and aired right before ""24"". So I got my first taste of this action packed series, and after viewing all of the episodes of season seven on DVD, now I'm hooked. The seventh season of ""24"" was the best TV series of the 2008-09 season. Yes, it was even better than the two current TV shows that I watched: ""House, M.D."" and ""Desperate Housewives"". And I plan to go back and catch up on the first six seasons which I haven't seen yet.

""24"" follows the adventures of Federal Agent Jack Bauer, who through the first six seasons has stopped bombs, viruses, assassination attempts, etc., and has saved hundreds of lives in the process. Each season has played out in real time in a twenty-four hour frame of a very bad day for Jack and everyone else involved with what's going on. I got to see this play out for the entire seventh season and it was fascinating, not to mention scary, exciting, thrilling, suspenseful, and spectacular, usually all at the same time. But what really made season seven of ""24"" so special is the talented acting, writing, and directing that came together. There was hardly a boring moment in every frame of all 24 episodes.

The plot of season seven deals with terrorists attacking the nation's capital, usually with the aide of people on the inside who you think are good but turn out to be bad. Make that very bad. There are so many villains that I couldn't keep track of them. And there are moments where you don't know who the characters can trust. From the early episodes with endangered airplanes in the sky to the middle episodes with a terrorist attack on the White House to the later episodes with Jack Bauer fighting for his life after being exposed to a lethal toxic gas, I was really amazed at how good this season of ""24"" was. This is TV drama at its finest.

The acting is first-rate. Kiefer Sutherland was already a big movie star when he made the switch to the small screen in 2001 when ""24"" made its debut. But this show made him an even bigger star. Sutherland, who has usually played bad guys in the movies, got a chance to play a good guy and even though I haven't seen the first six seasons he must have been really good right from the start. He won a Golden Globe in 2002 and an Emmy in 2006 as proof. And I'm sure he'll be in the Emmy running again this year because in season seven he's brilliant. Also brilliant: Cherry Jones, who made her ""24"" debut in season seven as female U.S. President Allison Taylor. Jones delivered powerhouse performances in many of the episodes, and if she doesn't receive an Emmy nomination for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series this year, then it will be proof that the Emmy voters don't have any brains. Not only does she deserve to be nominated, I think she should win. Great acting gets big awards, and Jones did a great job this season. I'm alreadly looking forward to seeing her again in season eight. The other supporting actors did terrific work too. From series regulars Carlos Bernard, Mary Lynn Rajskub, and James Morrison to series newcomers Annie Wersching, Janeane Garofalo, Bob Gunton, and Jeffrey Nordling, as well as special guest appearences from Oscar winning actor Jon Voight, everyone does a great professional job here. The acting is not the only strong asset of the seventh season of ""24"". The writing and directing is excellent as well.

Don't miss the seventh season of ""24"". It's television drama at its best.",1243728000,,3805,4.574780058651027
3017396,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"I never thought that this series would last this long, but this season is absolutely amazing!

Just when you think that the writing can't be any better, they exceed expectations.  This series goes deep into the terrorist plots that are both realistic, and complicated.  And while it seems a bit far-fetched at times, you will find yourself looking at today's politics and deciding that it is not altogether outrageous....this makes the series even more fun.

I got a great deal for some reason on Amazon, and paid $43 for both seasons. If you wait until it hits stores, it'll probably be around $50 each as other seasons have been.

I for the life of me can't figure out why people are giving negative reviews because of the packaging. Um, ok...this product sucks because it comes in a small package. WHAT? I can agree with the one comment about missing the Bonus cd and Redemption. Those would be nice. But, the small package will fit nicely on a shelf. Duh.

As to the show...either you love 24 or you hate it. I agree that Season 6 was terrible, and Season 7 repeated some plots that I am tired of. But, it's still 24.

3017403,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"After the grisly maiming of 24 in season six, Jon Cassar and Howard Gordon brought Jack out of the civics lessons of S.6 and brought them back to the level of intensity and GRAVITAS to 24.

I think that Season Seven, while being very good, suffered from an unfortunately rushed finale that gave a lot of fans pause, considering how dragged out some of the other last few eps of the season felt. It's hard not to see Jack in all-out action, and that's where the season started to feel a little lethargic. But in exchange for Jack being on the sidelines for a bit, we did get a GREAT plot twist that I will not give away for those who don't watch the show near the end that gave a certain important character even more to work with.

The themes of the season are two-fold: Betrayal being the big theme, and the most civic-minded one - how does one condone the 'enhanced interrogation' techniques that Jack and other agents use to acquire life-saving information. The second theme seems to get thrown under the bus for a few eps, but then comes back nearer the end as FBI Agent Renee Walker, who, at first dealings with Jack, is an obvious opponent of torture, sees what she may have to become in order to protect the greater good.

What makes Jack a great action hero is that in those moments where dozens, hundreds, thousands, or in a few cases for Jack, millions of innocent lives are on the line, he knows that he has to do whatever it takes to save those people, and sometimes that requires a proverbial twist of the thumbscrews. What makes Jack a great character is that while he says that he doesn't regret those moments, he knows that there's a line that shouldn't be crossed.

There have been people who maintain that this show is an outline for the justification of torture in extreme scenarios, and I think that it's high time that those good folk shut up and enjoy the OBVIOUS hyper-realism of 24. Look at Jack Bauer for a few minutes. He's literally died twice (possibly three times) during the run of the show (S2 when his heart stopped due to being tortured himself and S4 where they had to fake his death in order to prevent his murder). This show runs so far off the rails of conceivable realism that we cannot use this program as a microcosm of society's faults and triumpths. It's a great, pulse-pounding, thrill-a-minute action show.

Remember in DIRTY HARRY when Callahan shoots the Scorpio killer and then steps on his wounded leg in order to extract information? Remember how good that felt because Harry's the good guy and the Scorpio's the bad guy? It's not supposed to be real. It's supposed to be entertainment. Get off the ""24 CONDONES TORTURE"" kick. Seriously. It's tired.

Take 24 for what it is: Great entertainment.

Except for Season 6. That was not good.",1243209600,7,2785,4.535856573705179
3017404,2,B000Y7ZBZS,"season 7 is little more than a 24 hour editorial in favor of torture.  its proponents (mainly jack bauer of course) are portrayed as strong and wordly, and its opponents weak and out of touch with reality.  if one can suspend one's dismay at this very pervasive propaganda, the episode is undoubtedly exciting and much better than season six.  hence the two stars.",1243209600,4,364,4.746031746031746

I loved that it was released the day after the season finale. I hope this is a trend that continues. I hated waiting to get my 24 fix.

3017406,1,B000Y7ZBZS,"Really, if you plan to watch this season, you have to abandon any sense of reason and logic. It's the only way that you might find any kind of enjoyment in this steaming pile. But too not just be bashing, let me explain (though I know that the hardcore fans will consider this ""not helpful"", though I would dare them to find fault in the following explanation:-))

24 has never really been about realism, but the first 4 seasons or so were at least believable, given a willing audience. As a viewer, you could relate to what motivated the characters, and even the scenarios, however far fetched they were, did make sense in themselves (again, if you were willing). Since season 5, that's definitely gone overboard, but this season takes the cake.

Let me give you an example: Double agents are believable (given some reasonable motivation). Triple agents are already hard to sell to anybody who is not entirely braindead, but even then you could come up with a plot that works. But quadrupel agents? Yes, season 7 of 24 features the first quadrupel agent (or rather character) in the history of story telling. So you find out that the bad guy is actually a good guy playing the bad guys. Until his real motivation turns out to be that behind his ""good guy playing bad"" routine there is a ""bad guy playing good guy playing bad"" routine... but no, he is in fact a ""rogue avenger playing the bad guy playing the good guy playing the bad guy"". Yes, it is that silly! That's not clever story telling, nor is it a clever plot twist... that's just weak in every respect, and it also goes to show what the creators of 24 must think of it's audience. To be fair, I guess that this is the silliest point of the current season - though not the only one. Other highlights of stupidity are a double agent working for the terrorists, who's wife happens to be jeopardized by the terrorist operation, such that he takes action to save her - while at the same time making sure that she gets out safely. So how did this come about in the first place? Did this guy get the dates confused in his filofax? ""Oh, no terrorist attack today, my wife can go""... ""oh no, wait - ah, she's already gone"". Then there's this guy - actually a good guy - who is kidnapped and finally forced to blow himself up, because otherwise the terrorists will find his family and hurt them... They don't have his family yet, and the good guys are just around the corner, and could save him. How threatening is that? How believable is it that this guy would blow himself up?

So what else is stupid? I don't know about you, but I would expect a professional attitude and work ethics in agencies such as the FBI or the CTU, fictional or not. I just cannot imagine that sensitive positions within such agencies would be staffed with emotional people who are suspicious of everyone and everything to the point that figures of authority are constantly questioned, opposed, or even deceived, collegues are intrigued against, and in a time of crisis, people are more concerned with messing with each other than working on the problem.  The people in the 24 universe are always getting in each others face. In every season! How believable is that? The highlight in this season in that respect is the continuous debating among the president and her staff, but the FBI people among themselves also show off some really unprofessional behaviour. They're acting more like tribesmen in the time of Ghengis Khan. It wouldn't be surprising to me if one of the subordinates started fighting the current leader for the ruling position of the tribe... (oh wait, that actually happens all the time in 24, doesn't it?).

Computer security is also incredibly easy to hack around in the 24 universe. But then again, in one scene in 24 we have the FBI lady geek telling us that the encryption of some data was done on a personal PC with custom encryption software, not on a government machine, which makes it very hard to crack. So if custom (as in PC market) software provides higher security than what the government agencies in the 24 universe can use, I guess that it's believable that computer security is about as hard to crack as stepping off the sidewalk.

While on the topic of computer security and silly plot lines: 24 kicks off with the same really braindead idea that was used in Die Hard 4: Apparently, it was deemed very smart in the universe of 24 to hook up all vital civilian installations to a single network, such that they can be centrally controlled and monitored. Power plants, chemical and biological installations, airtraffic control, you name it. All on the same network. And now get this: Because this is so important, they install one firewall... as in FOR ALL SYSTEMS! That's right: If that one single firewall is hacked, then ALL SYSTEMS can be manipulated. Even for people who know absolutely nothing about computer security, that idea must be totally silly. Forget about the fact that government monitoring of private installations is something that is in itself already a WTF.

The show has turned into a braindead collection of conspiracies and action sequences, wrapped together by plot lines which are unbelievable (makes you wonder what they wasted the time given the shows delay... they certainly didn't spend it on writing), weak characters, and - very clear in this season - bad acting. The realtime aspect, which made the show unique, has already been ditched since season 3, which makes that constantly ticking clock seem like a farce.

That said, I had really high hopes for this season, what with the producers boasting the ""reboot"" and all, but having finished it, I can say that 24 is something I won't bother to watch again. It's just too bad that really clever shows with good writing get killed while trash like this keeps being created.",1243123200,24,5819,4.659201557935735
3017407,2,B000Y7ZBZS,"First off, let me say that this is the first time I've bought a season of a television show on blu ray. I'm really quite disappointed. The constant-- and seemingly arbitrary--shifts between nice clear shots and what I can only assume are intentionally grainy shots (for artistic purposes I suppose), are irksome and really throw into question the purpose of having this on blu ray to begin with. I like blu ray in general, but I wish I had gotten the regular dvd version of this and saved 12 bucks.

As for the season itself, I've been a follower of 24 since the beginning, and this season is, I must say, the weakest of the 7. I, like most, was disappointed with season 6 and was looking forward to a return to form for the show. Most seem to think season 7 IS a return to form but I disagree. In addition to being poorly constructed, the writers have returned to all the same narrative devices that were exhausted after the first few seasons--moles in the government, machiavellian relatives, tiresome on-screen debating about the ethics of torture (let the audience debate Jack's methods, don't resort to simplistic middle-school level on-screen disputes--it's creative writing 101 that you SHOW don't TELL), twists you can see coming a mile away, the impossible choice scenario, characters complaining to co-workers that another co-worker or superior may not be up to job, innocent people being asked to go along with the bad guy so that jack can find the location of the headquarters (which always goes wrong), the first villain only being part of a much larger plan, etc... I realize some of these are hallmarks of the show, and are what originally made the show so captivating, but really, how long can they keep being recycled?

Also, some of the characters here are used in such a perfunctory manner, the show simply feels listless. Chloe disappears for large chunks of the narrative and doesn't have much to do when she is onscreen; Aaron Pierce is mostly standing around and it's never really clear why he's even there; the great talent of Jon Voigt is essentially wasted in a hyperbolized role; if you're not gonna do more with Morris, leave him out. Moreover, the narrative itself is not well assembled. Plot threads frequently disappear inexplicably (a situation more common in later seasons of the show, most infamously in the case of Beruz from season 4--what ever happened to him??) or the show leaves them dormant for extended periods of time. The dialogue could also use some new life; how many times can Jack Bauer convincingly bark things like ""We're running out of time!"" and why must we be subjected to repeated summaries of the plot by characters who blow up at other characters in moments of frustration: ""There's a terrorist out there with a nuclear weapon, the president is about to order an invasion, one of our agents is missing, and we're tracking a criminal who may lead us to the enemy's headquarters, so go back to your station and do your job!"" Of course, there is also the obligatory death of a major character. Finally, the events of the show are, of course, absurd and over the top, but the whole mother/daughter as the president/chief of staff thing was really too much.

Anyway, many will disagree with me, and that's fine, but I think this show has clearly jumped the shark and could really use some fresh thinking in the writing department. I place some of the blame on Brannon Braga, who was responsible for running Star Trek into the ground. You can see how banal his writing is in the short-lived crapfest ""Threshold."" I'm happy for those who have enjoyed the season, but I hope season 8 breathes new life into this show.",1243123200,7,3665,4.732394366197183
3017408,3,B000Y7ZBZS,"I've noticed all of the reviews mainly focus on the season itself and not the essentials of the whether the blu-ray transfer of this season was good or not. So I've decided to add my two cents in. And remember everyone we are all entitled to our opinions so feel free to disagree. O.K. First of all I think season 7 was pretty good. I would give it 4 stars overall. It was better than the mess of season 6 and came close to the greatness of season 5. Of course nothing has come close yet to season 2 in my opinion. That was the standard that will be used to measure all action series for years to come. Anyway, yes there were some uneven moments and plot holes this season at times but when you look at the big picture after watching the entire show the writers explained it well enough to satisfy my curiosity. The acting was great as usual with plenty of new characters getting a chance to flex their muscles and of course Jack barking his way through the day as usual. I liked the dialogue between him and agent Renee Walker and how Jack finds some of his humanity in the process by the time the show draws to an end but Renee ends up somewhat losing her's. Those who have seen the finale know what I mean. And I can't say enough about Jon Voight. His acting was superb. I felt the show really hit a new gear when he took center stage as the main enemy. And yes there are a few moments where the story will make you scratch your head but in the end the writers do a good job of tying everything up and entertaining you in the process. For example, who cares why Jack is fighting someone when you get to see him kill a guy with a screwdriver through the chest and then use that same screwdriver to start-up a truck. A true classic Jack Bauer moment :) You'll even get to see Kim become a mini jack near the end. Overall a satisfying season that did more things right than it did wrong.
Now on to the transfer. This is where my 3 star review comes into play. The blu-ray version is only slightly above the standard edition in picture quality in my opinion. On several occasions I noticed grain and bland or washed out colors. The blacks and grays were decent but didn't have that pop that I know blu-ray can produce. However, on a few scenes the picture quality was noticeable better than at other times. It seemed almost that fox didn't have their high def cameras working right on some of the episodes. Overall I would give the picture quality between a 7 and 8. The audio also is not quite what I was hoping. The dts master audio mix is a definite step up from dolby digital but for a show like 24 I was surprised that my system didn't get a better workout than it did. The audio mix is extremely front channel heavy with very little going on with your surrounds. This is a real missed opportunity on the part of fox since something is always going on behind the scenes with each set on 24. I wanted to hear the conversations and computer analysts typing away in the background with fbi headquarters or the grinding of hydraulics in the background as Jack and company stake out the loading docks. I just didn't hear any of that. And I feel that my ht is a pretty good set up (cost me about $3000) so I know that the mix could have been so much better. As a contrast I just finished watching Taken on blu and that was a audio mix done right. Anyway if I had known the mix would end up being so front channel heavy and the picture quality not popping as much as I had hoped I would have just went with standard def. Of course to each his or her own.",1242950400,65,3551,4.185401459854015

Based on the intelligence-insulting ""Going Green"" spots that aired during the show's commercial breaks, I assume the limited packaging is to help the environment.  It's not going to, because the discs arrived dislodged and scratched and I am returning it for a replacement.

3017411,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"Having watched all seasons of 24, Season 7 was the best by far.  With the introduction of Agent Renee Walker (the incredible Annie Wersching), Jack is teamed with his equal in that this is a strong woman who is able to look out for herself and think for herself, but who invariably finds herself drawn to yet at times shocked by Jack's methods when the safety of US citizens are on the line.  The progression Renee's character makes throughout the 24-hour period is profound, as is the interaction between these two.  And anyone who was annoyed by Audrey in seasons past will, I predict, love Jack and Renee together.

Mix in the fact that favorites from seasons past are brought back, and a new president is introduced (and faced with extraordinarily difficult choices in the face of both ethics and family), and this made for an entirely satisfying season.  I just watched the finale last night and am already ordering the DVD because I want to start it all over again.  Can't wait for Season 8 either!",1242777600,5,1004,4.6440677966101696
3017412,1,B000Y7ZBZS,"For the 4th time in the history of ""24"", Fox has changed the packaging that the DVDs come in. (Digipacks, thinpacks, the cardboard book [season 1 special edition] and now ultra slim sets [6 discs crammed inside a standard DVD case].

Because of this change, two things have occurred. Obviously Season 7 will not match your other sets, and there is no space for the ""bonus"" 7th disc that's been a staple of the ""24"" DVD sets since the release of season 2.

Also, ""24: Redemption"" is not included in this set. Some people held off purchasing the DVD version because they believed it would be included in the Season 7 set.

Thank you 20th Fox for reducing the packaging to nothing, removing the 7th disc and having the nerve to charge the same price for it.

BTW, brillant idea to release Season 7 meere days after it finished airing on Fox. What are you going to do come Dec/Jan when you have NO Seson 7 set to release to lead up to the Season 8 priemere. Perhaps this is an indication that the show will not be coming back next year?",1242691200,9,1032,4.359375
3017413,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"Reckoning time has come for Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland).  With CTU dismantled, Jack has to answer for his actions to a Senate hearing.  But the hearing has just started with Jack is pulled out and taken to the FBI.  There he learns that former CTU agent and friend Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard) is a terrorist.  And he's working with others planning an attack for that very day.  Teaming up with FBI agent Renee Walker (Annie Wersching), he sets out to stop the unfolding events.

Meanwhile, President Taylor (Cherry Jones), the US's first female president, is trying to deal with the unfolding events and the revelation that there are people in her own administration working against her.  Can her administration survive the day?  Can Jack stop the terrorists?

I think most every one agrees that season six of this thriller was non-thrilling.  Taking advantage of the writer's strike, the show spent two years working on the just concluded seventh season.

And it shows.

While it wasn't quite the fresh approach they advertised, it was once again fun.  Yes, several plot elements were way too used and the FBI really just subbed for CTU, but the action was non-stop and most of the twists good given enough time to be explained.  And there was one set piece near the middle of the season that had my heart racing just like old times.

Probably my favorite moments in this season involved Mary Lynn Rajskub's Chloe and her FBI counter part Janis Gold, played by Janeane Garofalo.  The two characters are very similar, and watching them work together, or not as the case may be, has provided some comic relief.  The fact that I wish there were more probably means they used them just about right.

This season was set in Washington DC.  Since plot is king (as always), I'm not sure the location really mattered.  I did find the location details not quite as distracting as they were when the show was set in LA.

Considering the current real life political climate, they tried to have some thoughts about torture.  However, it was overshadowed by the race to the next plot point.

Any fan of the show owes it to themselves to give this season a chance.  It will have you counting the seconds until you can find out how it all ends before you know it.",1242691200,4,2254,4.66243654822335
3017414,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"What can I say about 24? On one hand, the show is known for its unpredictability, twists and turns, all of which were present in season 7. I miss CTU terribly, so its absence left things feeling a bit scattered. I don't want to include spoilers in here, but season 7 definitely was in keeping with its history of not being afraid to kill off main characters. Some episodes were shocking, some were mundane. Chloe's character could have been used MUCH more prominently and provided the viewers with her typical comic relief more. I was hoping for some lingering questions to be addressed: what happened to Audrey? Is Wayne Palmer still alive? How about President Logan? Or Martha, for that matter. We see Aaron (thank God), but it seemed that we should have gotten a clue about Martha Logan's whereabouts. I also expected some due respect over the death of Bill. Wouldn't it have been great to see Karen Hughes show up, guns blazing? Okay, most of the things I listed wouldn't fly, but as good as it was in parts, this season seemed disconnected and a bit disjointed. Unfortunately, the finale, while revealing some things, left me frustrated. There was next to no resolution. Will I buy it? Probably, since I have all of the other seasons. I am hoping, however, that there are some things that get wrapped up next season, set in NYC. Taping begins May 27th, but I was disappointed to discover that Jon Cassar and Joel Surnow are done with the show. Surnow's departure is likely the reason that season 7 took on a PC slant (he's a diehard conservative, and lent balance and bravado to the show, IMHO.). I don't want 24 to end, but if it does, I hope it goes out with some dignity.",1242691200,2,1679,4.562913907284768
3017415,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"If Season 7 was a make or break season, then it definitely made it.  How many times can Jack Bauer save the country from destruction without losing the viewing audience?  Season 6 was an example of going to the well once too often.  The makers of 24 had to change the location, and Washington DC was a great backdrop.  There are certain elements the show must have: cliffhangers at the end of each episode, plot twists, betrayals, a new type of weapon of mass destruction and the unexpected.  This is what makes 24, 24, and this season the show came up big.  I am so glad they decided to released the DVD a day after the finale airs.  In my opinion, this is the best time to release the DVD, right when the fervor is at its highest.

This was a great season and a return to form.",1242691200,3,779,4.216216216216216
3017416,3,B000Y7ZBZS,"My wife and I are big 24 fans and have long defended it as the best thing on TV.  Even a weak season of 24 is much better than most other shows these days.  Furthermore, we own all the Seasons on DVD.

This will remain a classic TV series and deserves much praise for it's creativity.

Having said that, all things have a lifespan and eventually come to an end.

It seems that any series after 6-7 seasons begins to decline -- It can't be helped --- After 130+ episodes of ANY SHOW, what more is there to do or say ?

It is kind of like life.... As we age there are fewer and fewer exciting ""firsts"" that we expererience and everday life becomes simple repetition of the same events with only minor variations.

Season 5 was probably the last strong season.
Season 6 was of course an ""off-season"" as most fans and viewers agree.
The writer's strike seemed to kill the momentum for many shows.

24 tried to bridge the gap with the African-based mini-movie filler, but that mostly fell flat for most viewers.

SPOILER BELOW ....
Season 7 seemed to start very good, but pretty much after the White House seige, this season seemed to just limp along with no real directon, consistency or pacing.

By the time we got to the last 10 episodes, one was just hoping for the series to end and be done with it already.

The 2 hour Season Finale may in fact be the worst and weakest single 24 episode ever as it was totally out of character, stiff, and apparently FOX felt some need to start shoving more and more political correctness into the show this season that went beyond neccessity.

Will we watch next season ......... hmmm, Yes.
BUT........ if Season 8 continues going in the direction that Season 7 ended, we may very well drop off and stop watching.

This is not a nasty critique of 24 at all ........ as I said at the beginning, we have loved the show ---------  but there comes a time for EVERYTHING (Cheers, Seinfeld, Wings, etc..etc..etc..)

24 was a GREAT, GREAT show .......it's just that it feels as though it's time has come to end.

UPDATE -
Over the Memorial Day weekend we received Season 7 DVD in the mail and decided to watch it straight thru for a re-evaluation.

I feel the need to update my earlier review.

OVERALL, Season 7 was better than I remembered.  I think my earlier tough rating was skewed by the most recently aired (final 5-6 episodes).
I still feel the Season ""fell apart"" at the end and seemed to wander aimlessly and lose it's way at the very end.

Watching Season 7 again non-stop two (2) things become apparent...

(1) It seems that perhaps 10-12 episodes were filmed BEFORE the strike in Hollywood.  I say this because the feel and vibe of the writing changes erratically around the 11th episode as though the writers and cast had been on a long break and had a hard time getting back in the vibe.

(2) Depite item #1, the Season was really pretty good overall.... but something just derailed during the last 5-6 episodes and as mentioned before, I still feel the final episode was like a car with a blown engine just rolling to a stop.

The feeling during the last 5-6 episodes is almost as though the writers ran out of story but realized they had another 6-7 hours to fill so they started ""running out the clock"" to fill the time void.

All things considered, I feel my rating should be UPGRADED to a Four (4).",1242691200,6,3347,4.420880913539968

Oh come on. Swimming underneath DC to break into the White House? Oh come on. Definitely not one of the better seasons, but certainly better than the last two.

3017420,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"Like most fans, I was disappointed in Season 6, but willing to give 24 another try based on its past greatness. Season 7 surpassed my expectations.

While 24 is an action show, its best moments for me are the pivotal ones in the lives of the characters we care about so much, especially Jack. (Like, in Season 2 Jack talking with Kim while flying the plane, then Mason showing up and talking to Jack about what Jack should really be doing with his life; or, in Season 3, Jack and Nina's final confrontation; or in Season 5, our last visit with David Palmer.) There are several such memorable moments in Season 7.

This season benefits from a great cast, including some returning favorite characters (Tony, Chloe, Agent Pierce, and a couple others) and some great new ones (FBI Agent Renee Walker, super talented & resourceful and a possible love interest for Jack in Season 8 - if he lives that long), and uber bad guy Jonas Hodges, played to a tee by Jon Voight.

Season 7 borrows the more successful plot elements from previous seasons, and does them well in a new context. Jack, once again, is working on the outside, with the help of Chloe on the inside. Jack, once again, must infiltrate a group of bad guys by pretending to be one of them, and must pretend to kill someone he - and we - care about to convince them of his loyalties. There's a well-placed mole, feeding intel to the bad guys and keeping them a step ahead of our hero. There's a Sherrie Palmer-like character in the President's daughter, and, finally, once again, a President with principles - like David Palmer.

I am hoping the writers try some different plot elements next year instead of rehashing the same formula. Stop making Jack prove he's a good guy - sheesh, he's saved the world 6 or 7 times over, you'd think people would have learned by now. Give him some real resources and the unconditional faith of the leaders he serves.

But, after the disappointing Season 6, the writers did a fantastic job, and Season 7 brings the comforting feeling of the old 24 magic. Most fans, I think, will easily forgive the writers for reusing some past plot points. And while not all seasons of 24 portray their villains as 3-dimensional characters with plausible motivations, Season 7 gives us a nicely fleshed out villain in Jonas Hodges, and another guy who's pretty bad reveals his true motivations to Jack in Episode 24, and it's pretty plausible and satisfying.

In the end, despite the terrorist threats to the nation, and all the great action and stunts and car crashes, Season 7 is more intimate - it's about Jack facing his demons and about other characters we've long known dealing with theirs. And as a bonus (I hope this isn't too much of a spoiler), Kim's reappearance sets things right with fans - she doesn't wind up in any cougar traps - far from it - and she makes a positive contribution when it counts most. In my view, everything wraps up perfectly in Episode 24. The writers don't explicitly show the actual resolution to certain things, like what Renee is about to do when we last see her, or what will happen after the very final scene. But they show enough to make it clear how things turn out. And it is very satisfying.

However, the only thing that kept 24 interested is seeing Kim coming back from seasons 1-3 and season 5. But the consistency is all messed up this season. Jack Bauer is great as saving evil from hitting the US, the writers have unfortunately repeat the killing random people over and over from about season 6 onward.

But anyway...on to the show....

24 Season 7 will go down as one of the premiere seasons in the shows history. Maybe, from start to finish, the best since Season 1.  After a lackluster Season 6, I think it was safe to say that the writers and producers of the show had a clear opportunity to start over and start fresh. And they did. What we got was a smart, tight, and extraordinarily acted season with the same raging action and plot twists but still with a different feel to it. By relocating out of L.A and into D.C. we got the chance to see Jack Bauer out of his element for the first time. At first I was skeptical of this, as many were. But after the first episode of the season I realized that my skepticism was for nothing. The move to D.C. was perfect and it brought so much to this season. And as we progressed from twist to twist, from villain to villain, the one thing that stayed apparent was that this season was absolutely brilliant. Nothing will ever compare to the originality of Season 1. And the show's creators know that. But they weren't trying to replicate that. Instead they were trying to bring us a season that we will remember, instead of tossing away like we did with season 6. Season 7 was a triumph and it's just another example of why we keep watching.",1242604800,64,1659,4.243670886075949

After the success of the award winning season 5 to the disaster that was season 6, many critics and fans wondered if 24 had any life left in it.  Well when the writer's strike hit, it gave this show the extra time it needed to make Season 7 the best yet.  Currently as of this review I can say from what has aired on television that from Episode 1 to Episode 20 it has lived up to the hype.

Even though I am currently watching this television show on the air, I still plan on having a 24 season 7 marathon with my friends by re-watching Season 7 from Hour 1 down to Hour 24 when this blu-ray is released.

After season 6, which I felt was the weakest since season 1 and which got a bit flaccid towards the last third, season 7 has been constantly entertaining and suspenseful. I suspect this has something to do with the fact that the great Brannon Braga (of Star Trek: Enterprise fame) is now one of the main writers. Highly recommended for fans of the show, and even if you haven't watched the previous 6 seasons, this will definitely turn you into a fan. But I do think if you are new to this show, watch the 90-minute ""24: Redemption"" film.

I had previously thought that season 4 & 5 were the best. But season 7 is turning out to be full of action, excitement, lots of twist. The producers made an excellent choice for the new President - Cherry Jones and there villians are good too.  the actor that played Candyman and the always entertaining Jon Voight is having a stellar career as an older actor.

3017437,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"24: Redemption was aptly named, because of it's ties to the reality of the series. Redemption was in fact a redemption for the series.
Despite season 6 having been a horrible season, it still was one of the best shows on. Btw, for the record, and hopefully the producers, writers and studios will see this, but every time 24 has a ""To be continued"" cliff-hanger, the following season sux (for 24). Season 6 was another of those not up to 24 par seasons. I'm guessing the reason is, 24 uses these cliff-hangers and then when the new season begins, they say, ""4 months later"" completely ignoring the entire cliff-hanger! They did that in season 2 or 3 and again in season 5. Note to the wise, and those that matter: DONT DO THIS ANYMORE!
Taking the year off, rather than trying to force an 8 hour season last year was probably the wisest thing. Rumor has it that 24 had the first 8 episodes ready to go, but, they looked back on it, and decided to rewrite.
What has occurred is a reminiscent, if not fresh look at things. Returning this season, so far, is Bill and Chloe, and a confused Tony Almeda. Confused as we don't don't what side he is on, after his ""death"" and the death of his wife, Michelle. Nor do we know if he is finished for the season, or if he turns up again later.
The typical agency mole is the show's huge dependancy factor, as is the ""Jack's bad... No Jack's good...ok, everyone, Jack's the greatest Superhero ever"" roller-coaster. One thing that is not as predictable, is 24 has seemingly dropped the mini 4 episodic plots, and has gone much longer with the plots, which seem to help develop the story better.
Even in a bad season, like 6, the show will be intense. But, it certainly helps to have a strong plot line and not just filler stuff, just to make it to 24 episodes, and season 7 so far, has managed to get back to it's game, and with some tenacity.",1235433600,3,1877,4.365714285714286

3017445,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"There should be a mandate taught in the early years of schoooling and that is that people should not talk about things that they know nothing about. Anyone who is even slightly farmiliar with Amazons pre-ordering knows that they do not charge you until the item ships. With that knowledge it becomes painfully clear that these pre-order's are a fantastic idea both for Amazon and the paying customer. Its good for Amazon because they get better knowledge on just how many copies they will need when its released and its good for the customer because they offer significant discounts for pre-ordering. Since your not charged until it ships and since you can cancel at any time before it ships, well lets just say that anyone speaking out negatively about such business practices has no clue what they are talking about.

If Amazon charged your credit card before it shipped than this would be a completely different story but that simply is not the case. They are not getting any money until they ship the product. Lets face it some people just have to complain. Its literally a part of thier personality and trust me I have known a couple people like this in my life. They don't bother to educate themselves about something before lashing out, they just immediatly form a biased opinion and the bashing begins. Its really the very essence of ignorance. So take my advice and just ignore all of the naysayers because not a single one can formulate a logical argument against Amazon;s pre ordering system.

Thank you Amazon!! I have been a loyal cusomer since the very first week you went live and customers such as myself understand fully that your pre-order system is one of the best things going today in regards to shopping for DVD's. Its really no surprise that you have become one of the biggest retailers in the world. Its for reasons like this. Keep up the great work and thanks again.

3017446,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"...and I have pre-ordered every season of ""24"" and the recent ""24: Redemption"" movie from Amazon.com well in advance to the season or movie premiering on TV.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT A SHAM but an excellent business decision on Amazon.com's part for fans will go to extremes to indulge their love for a show and/or movie.  Case in point, I pre-ordered ""24: Redemption's"" 2-Disc Set from Amazon.com in August 2008 at the price of $19.99 - the movie didn't premier on TV till November 2008 - and prior to movie's TV premier, I was notified via e-mail and was eventually charged Amazon's adjusted price of $18.99; however, Best Buy was (and still is) selling the exact same 2-disc movie set for the price of $29.99!

That said, if you are true fan of a show (or movie) pre-ordering from Amazon.com WILL INDEED GET YOU THE PRODUCT'S LOWEST PRICE and you are NOT CHARGED for the purchase until the product becomes available to ship which is the day BEFORE it hits the stores (when the product will be sold for a higher price!!!).

3248199,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"The Fox Network series entitled ""24"" is a post-9/11 counter-terrorism television program, which premiered in November, 2001, just two months after the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001. This seventh season examines another 24-hour time period in the hectic life of Federal Agent Jack Bauer, originally from the Los Angeles branch of the Counter-Terrorism Unit, known as the CTU, as he battles frantically to thwart yet another diabolical conspiracy. The novel structure of this groundbreaking television series involves each episode representing a single hour in this very action-packed and challenging day. The character of Agent Jack Bauer is portrayed perfectly by actor Kiefer Sutherland, who plays an old-fashioned tough guy, who utilizes any means necessary to vanquish the forces of evil. Of course, the rather aggressive and sometimes brutal methods of Agent Bauer often blur the distinction between good and evil. This seventh season of ""24"" continues to be decidedly intelligent, fast-paced, and suspenseful, and it is a superb combination of the political thriller and action/adventure genres. Its use of real-time plot development, and the innovative split-screen technique, are absolutely brilliant. The riveting intrigue and captivating plot twists keep the viewer totally enthralled, because one never really knows who can be trusted. This outstanding Counter-Terrorism series ""24"" is truly my all-time favorite television program, and I enthusiastically give its seventh season a five-star rating, along with my very highest recommendation!",1486252800,5,1576,5.797413793103448

3248789,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"Always exciting, but this season was a bit overdone in terms of Bauer's abilities to withstand the physical damages he sustains throughout the 24 hr period.  Each season has it's aspects of total unbelievability, but the plot is so strong that one is persuaded to overlook the ridiculously impossible stamina and strength of Jack Bauer.  He miraculously recovers in a matter of minutes from broken ribs, terminal diseases, helicopter crashes,hand-to-hand fights-to-the-death, and more.  Oh well.  It's still a great series and always a good story line in each season.  What I liked best about season 7 was there was finally somebody working in the White House with integrity and honor, namely Chief of Staff Kinan.  And of course, one of my favorites, Agent Aaron Pierce.",1478304000,3,771,5.128

I have to give the writers credit for portraying the FBI as the bumbling, egotistical clowns that they are. The most entertaining  part of 24 is showing politics and bureaucracy continually tying the hands of law enforcement and real justice. The Jack Bauer character is interesting as he continues to work for those who betray him and sometimes try to kill him.

Abigail change and a big let down. No more CRU character interplay. Now we just have Jack with a boring FBI. No interplay, cliched script, and faceless actors. The FBI as opposed to professional CTU group function as bunch of dummies and Jack has to work with these morons. They are out of Jack's league and can't keep up with him much less do anything right. I just found this season absolutely boring and formulated and could not see more than episode at a sitting unlike the previous seasons where I could not stop watching.

I miss the CTU crew, but the viewers get a new character, Renee Walker. She's awesome! Be prepared for a past character to return.

Time and again, the renegade agent Jack Bauer, saves  the American people from a bumbling FBI and woman President, who personify those who worry more about the criminal's rights than the victim's.

3249371,1,B000Y7ZBZS,"I watched it as a follow-up to the movie 'Redemption'. Redemption was fine, but by the third episode for this season, I stopped watching, being reminded why I stopped years ago. In this story line, once again our government is saturated at the highest levels with corruption and secret agendas; and the extreme violence which is seemingly required to save the day, even to the point of convincing a good female LEO that violent acts or even threatening such acts on a woman and her infant is necessary. People say that this is only a fictional story, but these concepts DO have an effect on people, and as any propaganda [or advertising] expert knows, even the most outlandish and unthinkable actions become a little less strange and a little less unacceptable with each viewing. The Management of FOX must know what they are doing, and it is NOT good.",1469923200,,852,4.724832214765101

As long as the scripts were of tongue-in-cheek, action hero genre, the episodes were entertaining, if flawed. But with season 7, the writers had to equip everyone with super-automatic, ammunition spraying sub-machine guns, that seemed to fire endless rounds without actually hitting anything. Oh, and the seventh season was filmed in late 2007, when Hillary Clinton was trying to run for President of the U.S. So, who is President in season 7? A Hillary Clinton look-alike. To make matters worse, her Chief of Staff just has to tell her that she is a ""great lady"". C'mon, really?

A story of success , but at a high price for many of the characters, along with the dedication from a rare breed of person, often serving behind the scene most would witness or realize.
In light of all acqusations and blame, again Jack B., gets it done, by doing what is needed.  Just by the scene several times, where Jack needed to remove his shirt, shows the pain he suffered for his country through the years.",1457222400,,506,4.489130434782608

3250292,2,B000Y7ZBZS,"This season was really very farfetched and unrealistic.  It is one thing to believe that a pro like Jack can do all that he has shown that he can do, but the things he is able to accomplish in this episode are beyond human ability so it really forces the tv watcher to stretch to their mind to the point of disbelief.  Then they top that off with having a female president who actually sticks to the US policy of not giving into terrorists even if it means sacrificing US citizens and her all male entourage gives her nothing but flack.  Gosh what a shocking surprise there!!!  Previous presidents have not given in to terrorists and had the support of their male entourage, but not the female president.  Got to love the irony there!  Finally we top the whole thing off with the ridiculousness of the last hour and the many unanswered questions.  Were they deciding if they were going to do a season 8?  Let Jack die if they aren't.  Save him if they do it.  How stupid do they really think we are as viewers?!",1438214400,,1011,4.358288770053476

From her annoying denture-speak (sorry, I know that's a personal attack on the actress which is really wrong!) to her hand-wringing to her just being a jackass... Ugh, so annoying. And Season 8 only solidifies my dislike of her. Also, her daughter is a total biatch! I guess they chose well since both of those characters elicited a strong response from me and hubby! Every time the daughter or Mme. President was on the screen I wanted to shut my eyes and ears. By the end of Season 7 I was saying ""and I did it all with Polydent"" every time the president spoke lol. I'm sure I was obnoxious but hubby laughed 'cause he lubs me. :)",1432598400,2,739,4.401459854014599

3250466,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"24 is very consistent, moving their stories along from season to season. They tend to revolve around plots to kill the President, terrorist plots to bomb American cities and various nefarious plots to scare the hell out of the slightly paranoid viewer. It seems to have been originally inspired by the events of 9/11 and they recycle all the drama of ferreting out the bad guys, but always on American soil. They were prescient in having a black president in the first season and a woman president later, along with a neurotic and compromised president (not unlike Nixon). It is inventive, but after a while the seams show if you watch it a lot.",1431129600,,645,4.666666666666667

3250669,3,B000Y7ZBZS,"* Great action, edge-of-seat suspense, complex characters and some good acting.
* Lousy ethic (the ""greatest good for the greatest number"" ethic that dominates this series would eliminate care for the weak and disabled because of low productivity and cost).
* Incredible ignorance of religious faith. A Muslim cleric joins Jack in ""forgiving ourselves"" for their own wrongs--a foreign concept to Islam (not big on forgiveness), or either Christianity or Judaism (God is our judge and He alone can forgive us--not we ourselves).

And since my wife and I were still working at the time, and had other commitments, we weren't able to watch enough episodes to be able to realize the problem before the 30-day return period, so we were unable to send it back.

3250819,3,B000Y7ZBZS,"I'm finding this season a little tougher to get through than the others.  The plot seems scattered - more than normal for the day in the life of Jack Bauer.  It's almost like the perfect perfect storm of bad things all culminating in a 24 hour period - which makes the story line a bit hard to follow/believe.  The previous seasons were, in a fantasy world, at least believable.  This season makes every government entity corrupt (ok, that's believable) and absolute bafoons (ok, that's believable too).",1415059200,,503,4.813953488372093

3250883,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"For the 'conspiracy theorist' and 'truthers' 24 comes an astonishing perception of what's going on, or what could be going on in this post 9/11 world.  It is engaging, thought provoking, and action-packed television with a high classed quality of production (it just looks so good on screen like a movie) and situation after situation is seamless.  At present I'm going through all seasons for the third time.  Fans of 'The Shield' will enjoy this series.  It's wild.

24 has shock value.  Jack has shock value.  This show has a way of making you think ""...did Jack really just do that?""

If you have a taste for espionage, terrorists/counter terrorism, corrupt politicians, geo-politics, and great actors/action/production- then this show is for you.  It would be a comfort to know there is a real Jack Bauer out there.",1411689600,,820,4.927007299270073

3250905,5,B000Y7ZBZS,I have definitely developed an addiction with this particular series! Season 7 is preparatory to season 8 which when I completed season 8 I was quite sad since there was no season 9.all the seasons some extent are interconnected with each other and are the continuing evolvement of Jack Bauer and his immediate circle of friends and family . it's ironic that jack is so intimately bound with what he does and actually and then fortunately cannot escape from it. theoretically speaking the series could go on indefinitely! Because of the karma the Jack Bauer creates attempt to make right on everything that is wrong he creates continual enemies on all fronts but ultimately he's getting older and older and so at some point would either have to die or become a mentor to someone who would take his place that possesses the same qualities. so to sum it up yes I thoroughly enjoyed season 7 and the conclusive season 8,1410480000,,916,4.695652173913044

3250924,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"First, suspend disbelief:  characters get dirty and clean again without taking showers, no one needs to eat pee or poop, everything Jack needs is in his man-purse, wounds heal and are forgotten about within 10 minutes or so, crises happen sequentially rather than simultaneously, the good guys never run out of ammunition, all lawyers disregard the trail of murders, and on and on and on.

Having said all that, this is a tremendously fun series for people who like non stop shoot-em-up action with just enough plot to tie scenes together and just enough side stories to give needed breaks from the gunfire and explosions.  Better than most action movies because once the premise is in place, we can just get down to the good stuff: barely-plausible non-stop violence, with no goofy humor attempted.  It works well for binge watching.  Just ask yourself, ""What would Jack Bauer do?""",1409788800,,882,4.9324324324324325

I mean let's be honest...how many different ways can Jack Bauer end up saving the world?  Well, I have been pleasantly surprised year after year. 24 has remained fresh with each new season providing action, suspense, and unexpected turns.

It seems that Jack Bauer has found himself once again In a race against time to expose the truth behind a a massive conspiracy that involves government corruption at the highest level. I found myself on the edge of my seat as attacks on National Security lead officials to suspect that Bauer and a surprising former CTU agent are conspiring with those who are responsible for the attacks. As the plot thickens, Jack Bauer must fight for his own life while he works with the FBI to stop planned attacks. Jack is constantly in a position that begs the question ""is that really the right thing to do?""

3251136,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"Who could have imagined that Body Snatcher Extraordinaire Donald Sutherland would sire the Second Most Interesting Man in the World - Jack Bauer.  I just started watching 24 about 3 months ago, I had no idea this show existed since 2002.  I have watched all the way through season 7, and just started season 8.  Once you start watching an episode it's very hard not to start watching the next episode, everything is nail biting and the episodes keep you at the edge of your seat.  Season 7 makes Jack appear to be the good guy, then the bad guy, then the good guy and so forth.  When he's perceived to be the bad the bad guy your adrenaline is flowing, you want to yell at the TV and let them know Jack is out there to help.  He has no regard for his life or how he's perceived.  He will do anything and everything to save the day.  As in previous seasons the threat is either biological or nuclear, in this season it's biological.  As always Jack has a direct line to the president, and every president in every season is under threat of being killed by terrorists.  In this season Jack takes a by-the-book female FBI agent and converts her to the Most Interesting Female in the World.  She gets it, you must severely torture the bad guys, bring 'em to the edge of death to get them to talk.  And sometimes you have to severely threaten the good families of the bad guys to get the bad guys to talk.  She turns into a Monster and can't stand herself, yet she realizes someone has to take this approach.  There are some great cheese factors in this show...I love how everyone, good guys and bad guys alike, says ""JACK BAUER???"", it's either in the context of amazement, disgust, fear, or an array of other emotions.  Does anyone know how many times Jack says ""Copy That""  ?  What about all those stolen cars, ripping the wires from underneath the steering wheel and starting the car - this is ultimate cheese.  Chloe is one of the few characters who survived every season, I don't think she's ever smiled, she can still figure out every computer issue and computer attack.  She has maintained that look of disgust to her fellow man-kind, except Jack of course, and continues to have no problem telling people how it is.  I love the office politics too.  Sit back, prepare your emotions, grab some beers, and watch the ultimate Stud Jack Bauer save the Planet for the 7th day...stay thirsty my friends!",1404432000,,2401,4.4610091743119265

3251147,2,B000Y7ZBZS,"This show would be completely awesome if it weren't so stupid.

Here's what happens in every season:

Bad stuff happens, Jack goes to extraordinary lengths to save the USA and beat the bad guys. Then the government gets mad at him for [fill in the blank]. He's never recognized as a hero, but instead ostracized, hunted, indicted, arrested, jailed, maligned, disrespected. And then he saves the world again. Really? Ok maybe for one season sure. Maybe for two. But every single season he's the outsider-turn-hero-yet-again.

If Jack does return beyond the current 1/2 24 series, I hope the writers stop being so cliche and get more creative. The whole ""against all odds even when completely irrational"" is mind-numbing.",1404086400,,719,5.076271186440678

3251154,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"I just recently purchased '24: Season 7' because I like the series. My problem is = the box came 'Undamaged' direct from Amazon. The factory wrapping was 'sealed & intact' but the DVD case itself was shattered in pieces, when I opened the packaging Broken Pieces of the DVD case came falling out. So this points out the fact that 'whoever picked the product & packed up the box' knew at the time that the factory DVD case was Seriously Damaged. Before I opened the factory cello wrapping, I could hear the pieces of the Broken case rattling around & I could see the plastic pieces inside the cellophane. As I stated ""the original shipping box was Undamaged.""",1403740800,,658,4.584745762711864

The only criticism I have is that the writers keep reusing the same theme, throughout the series, which leads to quite a bit of redundancy almost to the point where it could become boring if it were not for the dramatic quick action scenes along with the often climactic cliffhangers.  By far, 24 will be one of my top listed television series.",1403654400,,421,4.6

3251172,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"I'm not going to get into the plot and how great it was. I'm actually going to complain after having given this season 5 stars. My complaint has to do with the constant sotto voce delivery of the dialogue. It's not just season 7. It's every season from the very beginning. I have pretty decent hearing, but I cannot understand the dialogue because every line is being whispered. Even when Jack isn't whispering he's whispering. It's very annoying. Damn it - I have to have closed captions constantly on in order to understand the dialogue. Why can't the director let these guys speak in a normal voice? It's, frankly, very annoying, in fact, maddening. I hate it. If it were less of a show than it is, I would stop watching it for that very reason.",1403308800,,748,4.507352941176471

The show is still entertaining and the supporting cast do a great job.  Frankly, almost all of them play their role better than Jack Bauer. every season that I have ever seen, there is a rogue agent who has penetrated the agency.  Not only this idea is getting boring, but it is quite unrealistic, particularly when it happens so repetitiously. Overall though, the show is pretty entertaining.",1401494400,,522,4.5212765957446805

I will go go back to season 1 to see how it evolved to ""24 Redemption"".  I caught it  from season 7.

3251248,5,B000Y7ZBZS,Enthralling season.  Jack is memorable. A strong cast. Writing holds up better with each season.  The plot holes are fewer though the suspension of belief that plagues this series is still a problem.  Why does Tony turn?  We find out in his big reveal at the end but it's an uncomfortable choice by the writers.

I liked Keifer and his character but every time he raised his voice and yelled commands it irked me but I still liked his character. Overall it was awesome watching each episode. I know he'll come back somehow. I'm sorry he didn't end up with his daughter but it was still a sad but good ending.,1400284800,,449,4.232558139534884

Keifer Sutherland has found his niche.  It does drive me crazy when
the 1 hour ends.  Don't think I could watch the program if I had to
wait for the next episode.
Really like the plot, kinda reminds me of what is happening in Wash-
ington the last 50 years.  The lies we are told by Presidents, Congress,
and the abusive tactics of the bureaucrats.  NSA, FBI, SEC, and all
of the other Federal agencies.",1400284800,,473,4.340909090909091

3251280,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"Before anything else is said let it be known that I would qualify as a lefty in most circles.  I'm strongly anti-war, and anti-torture as well, and I have friends that can't believe I love 24.  But as I tell them, this series does not back away from the tough questions and it wrestles with them skillfully.  In addition it's hard to imagine a more high octane ride, filled with moment after moment of suspense.  I'm postponing watching season eight for as long as possible so I don't run out of episodes too quickly.  Of course there's always the tension between wanting to save some to watch, and waiting so long that you've forgotten key aspects of the plot, or lost the momentum.  So I'll wait a little longer, but not too long.  This is really great television, and I think it's the only program I've ever seen that in seven seasons hasn't even had but the slightest hint of humor- yet I loved it all!  Mindless action to escape into, yet lots of deep questions for the thinking man- i.e.: on Jacks putative death bed he calls for a Muslim cleric who holds his hand.  How Islamaphobic is that?  This is a must see!

I also guess that my being a pacifist doesn't mean I think violence is never ever an alternative- Clearly there do seem to be situations which may require a violent solution.  For me being a pacifist just means that the greater the degree to which violence plays a role of any solution, the lessor the likelihood that things will stay fixed.  I see nothing in 24 that is inconsistent with this view.",1400112000,,1520,4.444043321299639

Because for those of us that watched those seasons closely, it's just not feasible that Tony could fit the role the writers have him in here.  For all the work they did together, for Tony to strap explosives to Jack in one of the last couple episodes of this is an insult to the intelligence of the viewer.  I'll pretend that a plastic surgeon turned terrorist created this ""alter-Tony"" and that either the real Tony remains dead from season five, or that the real Tony will return in a later season with some explanation for this garbage.  Nina Meyers as a character worked, but I'm sorry, this absolutely did not work.  Season 8 was something of an improvement from this; thank goodness.",1399593600,,798,4.513888888888889

I'm impressed by the depth and breadth of this series, its relevance to current day issues (exploring the limits of interrogation, questioning the balance of ends and means, illuminating the issues of trust and ambition). The series has improved over time, from very good to great. I'm so tense from watching!",1399334400,,432,4.851351351351352

3251326,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"I am wondering throughout the episodes of Season 7 That, how in this world could we possibly allow cowards,selfishness,and bastards to lead great nations and great people. Great leaders are those who take vow to lead, protect and prosper their people. They always say my folks, not my family or irrationally my son or daughter; they do not bluff about irrelevant family matters. They always care for the good of their country and their people.

Mrs. Allison Taylor is a kind of woman, extremely selfish who gambles at on the lives of many and at the expense of the suffer and trauma of Jack Bauer and his brave colleagues who always fights until they give their lives; precious life no one can measure its value. She sucked the blood of Bill Buchanan whose bravery, commitment and trustworthiness to the country he loved the the people he served is  unquestionable.

I know one thing in my whole life that is The Wicked are always free to walk away from justice",1399075200,,961,4.674556213017752

Chloe is perfectly flawed.  She is the woman behind Jack.  Each season has kept up with the times.  I love the real-time aspect in filming the series.

A few months ago my husband was looking for something new on Netflix and came across series one. We began to watch it one episode a night when he would get home at 11pm.  It became like crack cocaine!  We began to binge watch on our weekends. We got to season 6 when Netflix dropped the series.  We were so bummed that I went on Amazon and bought 7 and 8.  ""Then"" I found out Amazon Prime had it and we signed up for Amazon Prime. We just finished season 7. Do NOT get started on the series unless you have time because it is addictive!

3251397,3,B000Y7ZBZS,"I enjoyed watching season 7 but it has a lot to be desired in the credibility department.  Characters incessantly keep oscillating between friend and foe in a 24-hour period.  Heroes who were exposed to a lethal dose of chemical warfare keep hesitating between dying and coming back from the dead by injecting themselves with what must be some kind of powerful miracle medicine.  Inconceivable yet instantaneous reconciliations end up in vicious backstabbing as instantaneous as the original reconciliation was. And on and on and on....the story is relentlessly as incredible as it is packed with action.  If you like action movies, but can look the other way when it comes to credibility, and are able to overcome your nausea when ""corny and cheesy"" does not even begin to qualify some of the scenes, you might enjoy the series.  Suspenseful, addictive, populated by likeable characters, but totally out of the realm of reality..",1397347200,,930,5.092105263157895

I guess it is a secret hopefulness that we have a character that gets things done in time of crisis, but somehow relatable to us. I did find myself asking some very serious questions about how I truly feel about certain things referred to in the series, decisions that should have consequences, yet where are the lines?

3251487,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"24 is the overall best action program ever. I cannot write highly enough about 24. A brilliant idea well executed. Every 24 fan has his or her favourite season. I liked them all. No other series had me sitting at the edge of my seat the way 24 did and still does. Jack Bauer is a unique character. You'll find bits and pieces of the character in various works but none as complete a character as Sutherland and the writers made Jack Bauer. It is my all time favourite show. Since 24 you will find a number of characters in TV, movies and books which emulate Jack Bauer--Jack Reacher, the lead character of Taken 1 and 2 and several others--but they fall short of Jack Bauer. He is the ultimate hero and anti-hero rolled into one. 24 is a work of fiction, first and foremost, but it explored security problems confronting all nations today regarding terrorism. It took an unflinching look at terrorism, at the escalating threat it posses. It is gritty and doesn't blink where violence is concerned. It posed hard questions and solutions in ways that are rarely portrayed on TV. I cannot recommend this propramme highly enough. I am so happy it is returning to TV on 5 May 2014.",1394755200,,1176,4.525821596244131

Personally, I enjoyed every season.  They only got better and better.  And season 7 was one of my favorites (at least it was up until a big plot twist towards the end).  Unfortunately, it does have one of the only plot twists that I ever really disliked.  They took it too far with one character in my opinion.  But I'll leave that for each individual to decide for themselves.  But I will say this.  The twist did take away from my enjoyment of the season.  I can't re-watch season 7 with as much fun as I did all of the other seasons.  And that's a shame, because Season 7 was still brilliantly done.  In the end, I guess a more accurate rating for Season 7 would have been 4.75 STARS.",1392422400,,847,4.225

You can read her thoughts in her eyes & expressions on her face while never saying a word. Jack Bauer, we love you, but you need to enunciate your words more clearly.

3251528,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"One of the more intrinsically gripping seasons when the action shifts to Washington D.C, presenting how national defense gets mired and mucked up with politics. Most characters are well depicted, although I thought some would have been better represented by other actors - yet the acting was talented in general.

The last few episodes stretched credibility to show how even Jack Bauer could keep going with such stamina to endure and persevere through a horrible nuclear infection to again save the day. Fans must have suffered through the seasonal hiatus wondering what was going to happen (would the show be canceled, but maybe that pumped up ratings). So I felt disappointed that Jack's illness wasn't addressed in more detail at the beginning of the next season, when he was miraculously cured and again in fighting form.(Perhaps later episodes present more detail - I'm just starting season 8, but that's another review).

Other gaps in season 7's storylines (which may have been stripped from the final episode versions) include Bill Buchanan's marital relationship, Jack's daughter's sudden appearance after years of estrangement, and Tony Almeida's real motives for his apparently back-and-forth ""whose side is he on, anyway""? Maybe fewer bomb explosions and less gunfire would've allowed time for evelopment of those storylines. Yet as a professional writer, I must commend 24's scriptwriters' ongoing, imaginative plot development. Kudos to them especially after creating 7 seasons worth of scripts.",1391299200,,1510,5.421276595744681

3251533,2,B000Y7ZBZS,Although Jon Voight does a good job in playing the villain in Season 7 of 24 the episodes were not as nail-biting nor did they keep you on the edge of your chair. I didn't care for the woman they chose to play President Taylor because she looked similar to Hillary Clinton. Seems the producers were trying to plant this idea in the mind of the viewer. Needless to say the producer's attempt to put a political slant in the episodes ruined the whole Season 7. A real shame!,1390867200,,472,4.314606741573034

You can't kill Jack because he's the star of the show. I suppose by season 7, I am just a wee bit jaded. The plots are a little too over the top. There have been too many plots to assassinate the president, wipe out L.A. or DC, too many moles in the CTU or the upper echelons of government. In other words, It's not hard to believe there are dirty people in our government, but Jack has had 7 seasons to get rid of them. Enough already.",1390348800,,562,4.026785714285714

3251594,2,B000Y7ZBZS,"There are things to like about this series ----but oh man, do they make you pay for it!

The writers and producers make you sit thru epically unbelievable situations -  one after another after another.  Stupid and short sighted characters (president Taylor, her husband and her daughter- FBI guy Larry, Tony's laughable non-communication about his agenda to jack, on and on.  Trumped up charges for Renee one hour (for which she is a wanted outlaw) and then the charges are completely forgotten within two to three hours -without explanation!
Even the Jack character is so wrapped up in himself as to opt for his selfish pride rather than allowing his daughter to help him.  He'd rather suicide by bio weapon than entertain the idea he might have usefulness for his grandkids, daughter and friends. what a narcissistic tool.

Sure--I like some of the setups and a little bit of the action and a few tactics but when i finish a series i feel pretty dirty for having sunk low enough to swallow the rancid plot scum pushed my way.  It just feels like they have no respect for their audience.  I, having worked for 20 years in film, TV and corporate production, know that this attitude is fairly common among a far share of filmaking professionals.  They just don't want to spend the time and effort to write 'tight' and intelligently.  You can have your cake and eat it too ( i can name 100 films and tv series)-- it just takes more work.

Oh, one more thing bears repeating and embellishment.  The President Taylor character is so dumb/slow, naive, selfish and has terrible judgment (angry, untrustworthy, conniving daughter as chief of staff my ass--HA!)

The problem: There is far too much hand wringing over ""torture"" and and other liberal causes (saving africans from genocide, profiling of muslims, Gitmo, evil right wing terrorists) it is difficult to watch. It is such an odd take on 24, which has always been about doing what it takes to beat the bad guys and preserving freedom and the American way. You wonder what the writers were thinking (Presumably, we really hate George Bush). There is also an amazing (and not very beleivable) resurrection of a previously dead 24 character, a feat only Jack Bauer could accomplish up until this season. Lots of eye rolling ensues.  24 has always had liberal elements. (All good presidents are black and/or women, all bad corrupt presidents are white men.) But this season really takes it over top. The last straw was near the end of the season ultra left winger Janeane Garafolo, playing an FBI analysts (the evil CTU has been disbanded, presumably for torturing too many people), whines incesantly about how the FBI was ""trampling the constitution""  by ""profiling"" and jack apologizes to her! I nearly barfed. Add then the peaceful innocent muslims who are framed as terrorists by the evil right wingers and well, you get the picture.  They just beat you over the head week after week with every liberal cause you can imagine. And let's not forget the  slow weepy finale that fades to black before resolving many key plot elements. Does Jack die from being exposed to a fatal biological weapon?, Who knows? Does Renee turn into Jack Bauer and kill the villain? Your guess is as good as mine. Ugh. The worst all the 24 seasons.

I couldn't believe they had Jack Bauer on trial, after all he's done for the country, but he wasn't in court long before the FBI pulled him out to help them with a case... and then, typical of '24'... the action and plot-twists were non-stop. I was glad to see Tony back, but wasn't happy with how things ended with him. Maybe he'll be able to redeem himself in some future '24' season. I was also happy to see Aaron Pierce come back (love him!) and the rivalry between Chloe and her FBI counterpart Janis was funny. Too bad Chloe's husband, Morris, didn't play more of a role. And I was disappointed with what happened to Bill Buchanan, too. Did the writers really have to do that?

This is a pretty good season although the first half, dealing with problems in a fictional African country, was slow, a new plot in the second half was very exciting.  There are some truly wonderful elements this season that rank up there with the best of ""24;"" Cherry Jones plays a sensitive and capable President, Bob Gunton is great as her Chief of Staff, and James Morrison's Bill Buchanan has an unforgettable scene that left me gasping aloud. There are lots of intense twists and turns and it ends up being a very good season.

Kiefer Sutherland continues to be a charismatic super-hero, but there are so many subplots and characters that he's not given enough screen time.  The setting, Washington DC, isn't as good as the old CTU, but thankfully, we get Bill and Chloe back and the lovable Agent Pierce, as well.  Unfortunately, we also get Kim back.

Things were (at least for me) getting a bit tired in season 5. (Was that the season where Kim was chased by a cougar wearing a beret and carrying a knife?) Anyway, I digress... So, I sort of thought it was done.

After seeing some other positive reviews of season 7, I thought it was worth trying again... especially at the low prices that an ""old"" show goes for. I was very happy with it! This is probably the best season I have seen so far. Of course, you must maintain a casual relationship with reality in some cases throughout the series, but overall it works very well.

If you are a fan of 24 (or what it used to be early on) this is worth buying. I bought the Blu-ray for something like 24 beans. Great deal for some decent entertainment.

3251708,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"Season 7 of ""24"" packs all the excitement, drama, and pulse-thumping action that fans of ""24"" have come to expect.  There is no sense in going into the plot, as it would spoil the viewer's enjoyment of the series.  That said, certain themes are once again explored in this remarkable award-winning drama.  Season 7 explores the theme of interrogation techniques used to extract critical information from suspects.  In the previous 6 seasons of ""24"", CTU Agent Field Commander Jack Bauer routinely violated prisoner's rights in order to get information that would save thousands of lives.  It comes down to this: Is is acceptable to violate one individual's rights in order to protect the safety of thousands, or even tens of thousands? Do the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?, (as Mister Spock so memorably said to Captain Kirk as he was dying), or should the rule of law always prevail without exception?  This season deals in-depth with this issue, not only for field agents, but for computer operators, doctors, and yes, even presidents.  It seems that we all have ethical decisions to make, some of which have profound implications.  How far is a person willing to go to reach the ""truth""?  Jack Bauer's psyche is explored in detail in this regard, and this sub-plot is an extremely important and interesting element of this season.

The supporting cast is once again superb, second to none, and the interactions between characters is both humorous and tragic. The character development is absolutely astounding, more characteristic of a full-length movie than a TV series.

""24"" not only will accelerate your heart, it will grab it too. Simply stated, there is no television show that is in the league of ""24""; all pale in comparison.

I prefer watching serials such as ""24"" episode after episode, for if I allow too much time to elapse between episodes, I tend to forget important details.  My recommendation is to sequester yourself in a room with ""24"" and watch at least one disk at a time.  This will give you 6 nights of unparalleled entertainment.

Don't miss this season.

3251709,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"If you want 23 hours of action-packed suspense that is insanely addicting, get this series.  Just don't expect all the loose ends to be cleared up in the last episode.  The last hour makes you feel like maybe they should have called the series '26,' because they really needed a couple more episodes to close a lot of issues at the end.

A few of the loose ends at the end that leave you hanging off  a cliff:

What happened to Starkwood and all the other security firms that were conspiring together?

Was Jack Bauer's daughter able to save him from the chemical exposure?

Did all of the President's duaghter's actions come out and what was the media fallout like?

What ever happened with Tony Almeida?

3251711,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"I didn't really notice ""24"" until it's last season. I heard about it before, but never really bothered to try and watching it until it's last season and was surprised that it was actually a decent show.

I then noticed that seasons 1-7 were availible for Prime for free, which allowed me to watch every season on amazon, which took a few months watching a few episodes each week.

Kiefer Sutherland plays Jack Bauer, the main character, who seems to have everything go wrong at the wrong moments, somewhat reminds me of Bruce Willis in Die Hard. Many things in this series such as the circumstances and outcomes are not the most realistic scenarios. If you are looking for a realistic type show, this is not for you.

Each season has many twists in its story, while some more obvious than others. As of this review I have finished all seasons of ""24"", and have enjoyed watching Jack Bauer's experiences throughout the series.

While I am not a die hard 24 fan, I still enjoyed the series and will certainly watch the movie if/when it does get released. Would recommend watching to those who haven't already been immersed by this show!",1331942400,,1134,4.626865671641791
3251712,3,B000Y7ZBZS,"This season tried too hard from the get-go. Right from the start, CTU is disbanded. Umm, why? Didn't the last six seasons prove the case for this agency? Nevermind, apparently it's all about torture - and Jack's on trial from the start for his role in saving millions of lives, uh, I mean torturing a few dozen or so people. What cheese. And it only gets worse when the writers play their next few gimmicks in order to stir up interest: Female President (Cherry Jones), setting the show in DC (actually, not a bad play - LA needs a break), making up the country ""Sangala"" (because using a real one is just so un-PC, I guess), creating a McGuffin that borders on science fiction, and a familiar agent rising from the dead. That's right, Tony Almeida is still alive thanks to some really convoluted writing ploy and now's he's working with the bad guys.

All of this blends together for a shockingly bland and unbelievable season. If Jack was still working with CTU, this might be a tad bit more tangible, but now he's just suckered into the most statistically improbable plot yet when the FBI (which has been transformed into a poor man's CTU) interrupts his senate hearing in order to track bad guy Almeida. If you're not buying Tony as a bad guy, then you'll be ready for the 'plot twist' in the third episode - along with the many after. In short, this season was predictable for the start and ends the same way. It's still pulse-pounding moments, but they're suppressed when you have a bizarre attack on the White House that really takes you out of the moment (really, Secret Service? Is it really that easy?). Season Six was criticized for reusing plot devices and series cliches. But here, they're in full force. A mole (the most predictable one yet), a turncoat, government conspiracy, a forced death of a main character, need for sattelite coverage, ridiculous acceptance of Jack going rogue time and again by his associates, the first villain, the second villain, and the final secret villain who was behind it all. Yawn.

I'll always be a Jack fan, that's why I gave this three stars. He still has his moments and Keifer still sells him better than any other contrived character type this season pukes out. It's all fairly straightforward and predictable and comes across as too gimmicky for its own good.

3251715,4,B000Y7ZBZS,This is an excellent series of 24 that matches the excitement of the previous six series. However the DVDs don't appear to be compatible with my TV (we live in Spain) so we had to watch it on the laptop!,1324425600,,203,4.1
3251716,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"I've been a ""24"" fan since the series began, and as many earlier reviews have stated, the 7th season was a true ""high point"" for this show.  It's true that the series had been getting a bit stale over the previous 2 seasons, then there was the Writer's Strike which basically set everything back a year, with co-creators Joel Surnow and Bob Cochrane eventually leaving the show for good.

In this case, the infusion of ""new blood"" (pardon the pun) was just what the show needed.  I've been watching my DVD's again recently, and here's the high points:

>Great pacing.  The action is non-stop, but the plot threads are as twisted as I remember the First Season's being, and they strike a great balance between the two.

>We really see Jack's dark side.  Although it's seldom mentioned in these episodes, the torture at the hands of the Chinese has left both visible and hidden scars on our hero.  He's still doing his job, still dedicated to saving lives, but he's a man who's pretty much lost all hope in the future.

>Casting for this season is excellent! Cherry Jones as the President, and Anne Wersching as FBI Agent Renee Walker nail their roles, plus we get to see Bill Buchanan, Tony Almeida and Secret Service agent Aaron Pierce again, as well as Chloe O'Brien.  We also have a perfect foil for Jack in FBI Bureau Chief Larry Moss, a ""by the book"" lawman who refuses to see things Jack's way even the wheels start coming off.  This was a tough role to pull off, and both the actor and the writers deserve extra credit here.  And of course you can't have a better villain than Jon Voight!

>The resolution was just what it should have been.  No, Jack doesn't die (obviously, since there's another season after this one) but he comes as close as we've ever seen, and for once he has to depend on someone else to save him.  It's a touching moment.

If you still don't have this set, buy it!  I have the regular DVD set and am very pleased with both the sound and the video quality. This was the season where we saw Jack come full circle, and actually get some closure at the end.  It's worth your time, ""I give you my word...""",1309392000,,2130,4.4318766066838045
3251717,2,B000Y7ZBZS,"Once again this review occurs in real time. This one starts slightly more plausibly than the previous iterations. When is a safe house not a safe house? When it has readily accesible ventilation ducts. Here's a shocker the new white house is less than a day old and already we have an ideological standoff between the President and her chief of staff. Is there nothing this CIP device can't do? It's like ""the override"" 2.0. Can't the invasion wait a week? I'm no president, but the decision to pull out the troops seems like a no brainer. Nice borrowing of the Predator franchise soundtrack. Good to see that the FBI also promotes inter office romances. I like the fact they call the villain ""Debacle"". In a completely innovative plot twist the FBI has a mole. How do they come up with these wrinkles every season? The slap-o-rama is an acting tour de force-must see TV. This season was scoring very high on the plausibility scale until the raid on the white house by dudes wearing jungle fatigues. All of the hard work by the script writers was immediately tossed out of the window. The team then digs deep and comes up with a safe room - hostage standoff and a family member close to the president with reckless ambition. Provisional chief of staff? Really. When your walking on thin ice you might as well dance...I guess. From estranged daughter for ten years to chief of staff in less then 5 hours. They've gone too far when Starkwood management, after blackmailing the President with a WMD cataclysm,  shows up in the oval office with a GBC binding on their proposal for a cabinet position? GBC!? Let's go with another Kim is our hostage and will die unless you help us plot. We haven't trotted that one out in a few seasons. All in all not as far fetched as some years, but assigning your daughter off the street one of the highest offices in the land made up for any realism the show had to offer.

3251733,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"I recently bought the S7 dvd set & let me tell you, this show is like eating your fav candy. Once you start it's damn near impossible to stop! Lately i'm averaging 4 episodes per day & i'm happy to report that these episodes are just as addictive & suspenseful as they were when it first aired on FOX. As usual, each show is jam packed with action & suspense & the tension also harldly ever lets up.  Great stuntwork & explosions abound as well. But one of best things about this show are all the great character actors they always seem to bring in for each season.  Kurtwood Smith (Robocop) as Senator Blaine Mayer, Jon Voight (Deliverance) as the corrupt leader of a Blackwater-like mercenaries for hire outfit, Bob Gunton (Shawshank Redemption) as the White House Chief of Staff, Colm Feore (The Sum of All Fears) as the First man, Will Patton (Armageddon) as the head conspirator, Glenn Morshower (Blackhawk Down) reprising his role as Secret service agent - Aaron Pierce & Janeane Garofalo (Copland) as a nosy & suspicious FBI computer expert. Carlos Bernard also reprises his role as former CTU Agent turned fugitive Tony Almeida & Elisha Cuthbert  returns as well as Jack's estranged daughter - Kim.  The best new character in S7 though is the FBI agent Renee Walker played by lovely actress - Anne Wersching. She accompanies Jack Bauer through most of the series & quickly learns that in order to assist Jack in saving the day, she will sometimes have to bend the rules & do things that go against her own moral beliefs. This makes her very uneasy & frequently gets her in trouble with her boss - The ""By the book"" FBI Head Agent - Larry Moss (Jeffrey Nordling) who resents Jack for breaking law after law & torturing suspects. The tension between the three characters is very palpable & really helps add to the suspense & drama of the show. Add in a great story with frequent plot twists, lots of great action, terrific characters & more suspense than you can shake a stick at & you've got one of the most captivating seasons in the entire franchise.  I'd personally rank S7 as one of the top 3 best in the series & a must watch for anyone who's fan of 24 or great action thrillers with good character development.",1280361600,,2223,4.56140350877193
3251734,1,B000Y7ZBZS,"Here we go again... ludicrous storylines, idiotic twists, irritating characters, lots of gunfire and armed SWAT teams storming buildings and the villian they're after slipping out quietly through a side door... everything that wound you up in the first six series is back again for season 7, with knobs on.

What really strangles most of the 24 seasons at birth, though, is the format that made it famous... that it all happens in 'real' time, over the course of a single day. This isn't a real problem when this single day is stretched over 24 episodes, shown one a week on TV, for 5 or 6 months. But on DVD, when most of us watch two or three episodes a night during the course of a week or so, the preposterous succession of cataclysmic events, of the kind that most of us would be unlucky to witness in a lifetime, one after the other, reduces everything to the level of total and unbelievable farce.

In this season, for example, we have the White House attacked and bombs going off inside the building, loads of people gunned down, and rooms and walls and furniture etc destroyed or sprayed with bullets... and yet, barely two hours later, there is no evidence of this whatsoever, and life goes on in a pristine, undamaged White House as if nothing has happened at all!

One of the bonus features on Disc 6 shows the writers discussing the various problems of tailoring stories to the strait jacket of the 24 hour 'real time'format, with one guy saying they did consider having a 'time gap' between each event, like fast forwarding to three weeks later, for example. Sadly, this was dismissed as it might upset the 24 'purist' fans. To me this was a big mistake and might have freed them up to deliver more credible storylines with a bit more character development, for example.

Still, all this is moot now, as I gather Season 8 has just ended and it was the last they're doing. Daft as 24 was, you can't deny it was entertaining and had some money spent on it, and Jack Bauer is a great character... that's why I can grudgingly give Season 7 one star. It loses the other 4 for bringing back really annoying bit part characters from earlier seasons for no reason whatsoever, and for all the other reasons mentioned above.

I don't know if Jack Bauer survives at the end of Season 8, but if he does, there'd be nothing wrong with perhaps two or three feature films based on his character... WITHOUTtrying to cram it all into one totally unrealistic and idiotic 24 hour period. It couldn't be any worse than a lot of the other hideous 'reboot' rubbish spewing out of Hollywood, that's for sure.",1279843200,5,2599,4.544871794871795

3251743,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"This saga reveals a sinister conspiracy from the bottom to the top into the great spehere of power. from the very first episode, we have Jack Bauer having noticed that Almeida, Buchanan and Chloe have decided by themselves to establish a little CTU, trying to search for a terible bio chemical weapon.

In this sense, Juma seems to be the central axis, but he is just a part of this iceberg where interests of all kind are on the table. Contacts into the White House as well as a never ending list of links that eventually will lead him to Alan Wilson (Will Patton).

Once more, Bauer will have to cross over the line of the duty and the rules of game, guessing, fighting and dealing with an overwhelming amount of decisions in which the double crossing, betrayal and the concepts of polite patriotism mask sordid intentions.

Jon Voight steals the show as Jones, a man absolutely convinced he is right, based on his his most firm convictions, acting according the most faithful Machivellian rules, confers the saga of first rate realism and paves the way for future reflections about where's the line of duty ends and where the conspiracy begins.

Special kudos go for Ethan Koin (Pierce), the President of USA and Juma among the impeccable cast. perhaps the only flaw in the cast was (by lack of dramatic punch. was the President's daughter who never made me believe her personage).

But this is a minor fact. Go for this saga. You will have a captivating tour de force season.

3251762,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"After Season 6 of 24, I was a little worried.  It appeared that the show had started running out of ideas, and was starting to veer into completely implausable storylines.  However, season 7 was a far better season, and a return to form, thanks to a much needed jolt in the arm with new characters and new locations. The setting is washington  DC, the task...well its 24 so its save america from bad guys.  I won't give any spoilers or tell the story, but it very much follows the 24 template, a story begins, morphs into another, and morphs yet again.  The use of the new FBI characters works well.  I especially liked the young Rene opposite baurer, who is starting to show his age.  Rene's youthful vigor and debate over right and wrong plays well with Jack's do anythiny necessary approach, without coming off nagging.  There was also a return of some well missed characters.  My only complaint, the new president, and her story, wasn't a particular grabber to me.  The president is often the basis of the additional story in the show, as their decisions are important and relevant.  However, this president seemed a bit week and wishy washy, and her subplots weren't that interesting, and rather predictable.  But that's a small flaw with a very good season of an amazing show.  I recomend it to all 24 fans.",1265155200,,1313,4.632034632034632
3251763,2,B000Y7ZBZS,"I won't sugarcoat it: the ""24"" staff had a tough act to follow in 2009.  After the writers' strike, the problems in Day 6 (which has been unofficially called the worst season of ""24"" to date), and the weak storylines in ""24: Redemption,"" the writers had a challenge on their hands.  Day 7 was an opportunity for a fresh start, a chance to pull things together better than before.

But they tried too hard.

Everything in Day 7 shifted in some way.  Jack Bauer had been to Africa, CTU was disbanded, and Tony Almeida was alive.  Behind the scenes, the staff at ""24"" was introducing some new members and seeing a couple veterans leave.  Sometimes, change is inevitable in the course of a series, but that doesn't mean every change you make will improve the series.

The ""24"" staff used the writers' strike as time to plan out the entire day's terror plot.  Up until then, they did almost everything off the cuff.  This change is definitely my biggest issue with Day 7, and it's an issue because it goes against most of what I stand for as a writer.  I've been writing books and screenplays since 1996; ever since 2005, I've used ""24"" as my biggest training material.  I've made a lot of mistakes as I've tried to create a great story, so when I heard that Day 7 would be planned out in advance, the writer in me kept insisting one thing: ""It won't work.""

Unfortunately, I saw this play out as the season went on.  The day started out strong, but after the first few hours, it felt more and more engineered.  Here's why I think that's the case.  Whenever you write, your focus has to be your main character.  He makes the show happen; he lets it make sense.  From the beginning, most of what the writers had to go on was Jack Bauer, and that was enough to make a good story.  His history, family, personal life, and job--all of it was material the writers used to deepen the situation as it happened.  They saw it unfold along with Jack, and it gave them the most room to work with.  Everything was consistent and fresh because it all depended on what Jack was going to do.

But in Day 7, the focus was not on Jack.  It was on Tony Almeida.  His return has been debated, so I'll put in my two cents' worth.  He should have stayed dead.  Killing him was a stretch, bringing him back to life even more so.  But making him a quadruple agent pushed it too far.  The conspiracy he spearheaded wasn't well planned and constructed, and he switched sides so many times over the course of the day that I kept asking, ""Who is this guy?""

For all that the writers planned, it disappointed me that the main focus of the day came out so poorly.  This bothered me the entire season because the show is really supposed to be about Jack.  He's the character who ties everything together.  If the writers had focused on him, then they would have had a stronger storyline.  But the focus was on Tony, and instead of Jack taking charge, he came across to me as though he was only along for the ride.  He did and said the things that we would expect him to do, but it felt passive, as if Jack weren't making the decisions on his own.

Disbanding CTU was another major change I didn't like.  Apart from Jack Bauer, CTU makes the infrastructure of ""24"" unique.  Setting it in the FBI took away the atmosphere of the show.  ""24"" was not the same without the CTU phone sound, Chloe and Morris O'Brian bickering (which I actually miss), and a staff that's willing to do whatever it takes.  But in the FBI, it was too many politics and not enough action.  I didn't connect or even like the characters.  Sean Hillinger sounded and acted like he was reading the recipe for deviled eggs.  Larry Moss and Renee Walker sounded like they were trying too hard.  Janis Gold bothered me every time she spoke.  Everything at the FBI probably could have been removed, and it wouldn't have made a difference in the story.

But a major upset in the story is the terror plot.  In terms of the plot, this is the most important part of ""24.""  If the terror threat isn't well-constructed, then the story loses its impact.  It was hard to tell who was ultimately behind it all--Jonas Hodges, Tony Almeida, or Benjamin Juma, none of whom I consider believable villains.  It was hard to tell what the motive was behind the attack.  In Day 3 of ""24,"" it's clear who the villain is, what the threat is, and why he's carrying out the attack.  In Day 3, Stephen Saunders planned to use the Cordilla virus to wipe out America's population; his goal was ""to make America clean again"" after the U.S. government left him for dead in an explosion in Bosnia.  But there's not the same level of clarity or precision in Day 7.  We have a bioweapon (literally called ""the bioweapon,"" or a prion variant), but we never really know who plans to use it or why.

Bottom line:  Day 7 had too much planning, too many holes, and too many things that just didn't work.  To me, Day 7 was the worst season of ""24"" to date; I don't remember a season where everything at its most fundamental level felt so disjointed.  I think that if they stuck to the ways they used to craft ""24,"" then I would have loved Day 7.  The past seasons of ""24"" set a level of excellence that's easy to reach if the episodes are written loosely.  The writers tried too hard to create a better season, and they ended up fixing what wasn't broken.",1265068800,2,5350,4.367139959432048

3251775,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"For some reason I've always found the farther away the show 24 strays from it's CTU  plotlines the more interesting it gets. I'm not saying it needs more character exposition (hopefully the show learned THAT lesson season 6), but I mean honestly how many times can California's anti-terrorist unit (apparently run by GQ models and ex-Microsoft employees) get infiltrated before someone notices it's ineffectivenes? Thankfully 24 season seven not only gets rid of CTU (mostly) but places the show in a much more diverse setting: Washington DC.

This season of 24 starts off with a bang. Hero Jack Bauer on trial for his and CTU's inhumane treatment of criminals and terrorists (about time huh?). Then with the return of Tony Almada (who we saw die in season 5) Jack's called back into action. While the story of this season has the show's usual ups and downs (we already know Jack won't die so why even go there?) it's overall very solid. The action scenes are also very good and rank up there with this series's best (I don't think anything can quite compare to the adrenaline rush of Tony and Jack shooting their way out of Quantico!). The acting this season is also above average with cast regulars turning in their usual strong efforts and are joined by the equally good Cherry Jones as the new US president, Colm Feore, and Janeane Garofalo.

The packaging of this DVD set is probably the best I've seen yet! Seriously I hope the rest of the seasons (and every other TV show out there for that matter) get re-issued in this case format. I think my only complaint is not knowing which extras are on what DVD (thought this could easily be fixed with a thin paper insert).

So if you're a 24 fan this season is an easy buy. It may not be it's best season but it does enough right to make it an enteraining romp and shows there's still life in this long-running series.",1263081600,,1869,4.586826347305389

3251778,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"After seeing the ""Redemption"" two hour special I was very excited to see this season.  After seeing Season 6, I was starting to get concerned that the writers behind 24 were running out of ideas.  The fact that Jack's dad was constantly coming up got incredibly tedious after a while.  Luckily in Season 7 this doesn't happen.  The villains change and get bigger as the show goes on, like we would normally find in a season of 24.

One of the things that made this season especially strong was the change in location.  The fact that this season takes place in Washington D.C. really gives it a breath of fresh air in my opinion.  As you can guess this involves a threat to the White House and it is connected to ""Redemption"", but I won't say anything more than that.  At first with the setting in Los Angeles with David Palmer it was really great, but after a while the terrorists always attacking this one location got a little run of the mill after a while.  For whatever reason the change of location makes everything better.  In fact I think it would be awesome to let Jack's character go to different locations in future seasons.

The season kicks off with Jack on trial with Congress for his use of torture tactics.  This is a theme that gets revisited quite a bit throughout the season.  Obviously this reflects the U.S.'s current questions on how effective torture tactics are.  I like seeing those sort of questions being reflected in popular media.  I also like that they don't force their character to completely change to popular thinking, and then of course we wouldn't have Jack Bauer.

As some people have mentioned the packaging for this DVD is excellent.  I have to agree, it's the size of a regular DVD case, yet has six discs in it!  This saves on space and it does not require the use of Dual Disc.  I hate Dual Disc because you run a higher risk of scratching a surface of a disc, with these DVD's all of them have the top coated surface.  I think all large DVD sets should use this form of packaging; the sheer space saving aspect is completely worth it.

If you felt that 24 was starting to flounder like I was, you might be pleasantly surprised at this season.  Sure the events are over the top, but that gives us the action packed episodes we all want.

3251781,3,B000Y7ZBZS,"Now that the dust has settled and I've had time to reflect on Season 7 of 24, I decided that I would give it a three star rating. I loved it and hated it all at the same time. I loved it because of the action, the tense situations and moments, and of course the unpredictable and over the top methods of Jack Bauer. I hated it for the overloaded terror plots, the eye-rolling conspiracy stuff, and the multiple Tony twists. I decided on three stars because I enjoyed the season and watched every episode, but I didn't like it for the same reasons that I liked the early seasons.  The show started off as a semi-realistic, fast paced, exciting show with great story lines and great action. It still has the action and the excitement, but not near the heart, of the early seasons, but as far as realism (relative to its earlier self, at least) goes, forget it. Also, much of the excitement and intensity went out the window when they quit trying with the real-time element of the show. So, in the end, I liked Season 7 for the same reason that I like watching the mindless summer action popcorn flicks, whereas I enjoyed Seasons 1, 2 and in general 3 because they seemed to be much more intelligent and more realistic. Did these early seasons have some absurdities? Sure. But I feel like Season 7, among others, was just over the top.

In particular, here are some issues I had with Season 7:

-The Tony twists: While I was initially hoping that Tony would be coming back, I should have known to just let bygones be bygones and accept that Tony was gone. Now we're stuck with this nonsensical mess of Tony switching sides throughout the day after a practically non-existent explanation of how he came back in the first place. While watching it as it aired, it was exciting and shocking. But, when thinking back on it in the context of the entire season, it just doesn't make a lot of sense.

-The Conspiracies: This is just getting ridiculous. Every season since 5 has had some lame super secret evil conspiracy, and it was even alluded to at some point that they were behind Season 4. When did this become the X-Files? To complicate matters, they always go down screaming about how they are patriots, and how they think the world would be a better place because they killed 10,000 people. Each person turns out to be just another pawn in a larger game. I expect that in Season 8 we will find out this conspiracy was just another subordinate for larger, more secret, more evil conspiracy. For as much as I don't like the conspiracy stories, I don't even think they did it right. They build up Jonas Hodges as the bad guy for most of the season only to say ""well, um, he, uh, he was actually working for Wilson. Yeah."" Wilson presents yet another problem: before he is revealed and we are learning about the conspiracy, they keep alluding to how powerful and how far-reaching this secret leader is, and then he turns out to be nobody. I was expecting a jaw drop moment when they revealed who it was, but instead I was thinking ""who the heck is this guy"". Then, they go on to say, ""oh, well, um, yeah, that conspiracy stuff with Logan, Henderson, and Jack's family, well, uh, they were actually working for Wilson, too."" Basically, the premise of the show, which started out being about the Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU), is now about the Counter Conspiracy Unit (CCU). So, my final thought on this is that the show is so much better when its about stopping terrorists, and not about conspiracy hunting.

Now that I've got that off my chest, I want to talk about what I liked about this season. To begin with, I liked the change in venue to D.C. This gave us a fresh perspective and set the stage with an interesting side story about Jack testifying before Congress. When I saw that Tony was coming back, I was intrigued. Unfortunately, as mentioned before, this didn't quite pan out. Still, it was interesting up until the point he became bad again. I was having a blast rooting for him to destroy Hodges' missiles. I also enjoyed his secret mission with Bill and Chloe, even if the circumstances of his return were sketchy at best.

Add to this the story arc of Dubaku and Sangala. These ideas seemed fresh and interesting. I felt that Dubaku was a compelling and believable villain with logical motivations (unlike all of these conspiracy storylines). The episodes about stopping Dubaku were great, even if the CIP Device was a silly idea. My biggest regret here is that Dubaku died in the hospital, rather than Jack, Tony, Bill, etc. killing him. They do this kind of thing too often, I think.

Off Topic Side Note: In Season 3, Saunders was a former SAS man and Jack was a former Delta operative. Am I the only one who sees the missed potential here? Their final battle could have been the best in the series.

To answer the question posed in the title of this review, I think the wheels fell off when Juma and his crew showed up. This is the point, I think, where it stopped feeling like 24 and became more like a summer action flick. There are a lot more things I could complain about and praise, but I think I've laid out enough reasoning as to why I think this was on track to be a spectacular season, but ended up being so-so.",1262217600,2,5231,4.470157068062827

3251787,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"After the horrendous Season 6 on it seemed time for Jack Bauer to retire but hold on, Season 7 is just about as good as any I've so far. I'm not one to watch this show on a weekly basis, I'd much rather wait until the end of the year and watch all 24 episodes on DVD in less than a week: no commercials, no waiting days for cliffhangers to be solved. Sure, after such marathons you end up listening to the 24 theme and Jack uttering the words ""previously on 24"" in your dreams, but that's not so bad really.
THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT SEASON 7
#1 Jack's as great as ever, if maybe a bit more complex character with all the discussions about the evils of torture, hey, if in guessing, real life politicians batted 1.000 like Jack maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea to allow it though that doesn't seem very likely. Anyway, Keifer is going to need a throat transplant from all the yelling sooner rather than later but it seem worth it.
#2 The excelent President Taylor, unquestionably the best 24 president since Palmer (not Wayne obviously). She's just like Hillary without the pantsuits. This fictional character is the best way to learn it was a good thing that Hillary didn't become president, after all, wouldn't it have been horrible to refer to Bill as ""the first gentleman"" like they mention here all season long ?
# 3 Good Tony / Bad Tony. Like most 24 fans, my stomach twisted when Tony's true nature was revealed but to my surprise the last few episodes I learn to accept it and the way the writers tied things up at the very end wasn't so terrible. To name Tony's resurrection as contrived is definetely an understatment but hey, maybe this means there is hope for Edgar fans all over the world.
# 4 Much fewer eye-rolling moments than in past seasons though it was hard to accept the best way the 24 writers could think of a White House infiltration is underwater. If you've ever taken the tour of the place, like I have, you may not remmember any bodies of water in the vecinity.
# 5 Oldie characters popping all the time: Aaron the no nonesense bodyguard and his ever present ear-piece-phone-cable. Chloe the most beloved insuferable TV character in history. Morris, the second one in that very same list.
Even Kim Bauer's participation wasn't that obnoxious !
My only complaint: one of the things I love most about 24 is how they bring good-unknown actors to their parts which really helps in the veracity department(see Agent's Walker and Moss, the evil technician who looks like an adult version of Agent Cody Banks, etc.) thus I hate ""special star appearances"" as the only effect they bringis making you think to yourself, Oh, there's John Voight !, Oh, there's Dennis Hooper !. This type of casting does not work, not on 24 for sure.",1260403200,,2748,4.509018036072145

You don't have to, but to get the ""full Jack Bauer experience"" then I would deem that first step necessary! :) Great show, and for the most part, all very good actors!",1260144000,,512,4.457446808510638
3251790,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"After a controversial Season 6 (2007), that featured a nuclear explosion on American soil, a Bauer family conspiracy, and an assortment of untidy loose ends, there was substantial fan dissatisfaction with the direction 24 had taken.  The writers' strike in 2008, derailed production of 24 for that year, giving the writers time to try and develop the story they already had, and deliver a winner.

Set in Washington D.C., Day 7 is indeed a fresh start, after six seasons in southern California. The timeline has moved several years past the nuclear incident, and Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) is testifying before a Senate committee, when he is taken into custody by FBI agent Renee Walker (Anne Wersching), who seeks his help in tracking down Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard), believed to have been killed back in Day 5.

Thus begins what is a return to a more traditional 24 adventure.  Unlike Day 6, where Bauer was off balance and questioning himself, Jack is totally committed to the job at hand, and willing to do whatever it takes.  Contrasting this is Rene Walker, Bauer's companion for much of the day.  She rises to the meet the day's crisis, but is conflicted by having to employ Bauer's methods, that while morally questionable, usually produce the desired results.  Her behavior is frustrating to her boss, Larry Moss (Jeffery Nordling), and her gradual, at times disturbing, and perhaps tragic transformation, is one of the season's key story elements.  The pacing is mostly brisk, the characters interesting, and the acting edgy and mostly believable.  There are plenty of the kind of plot twists, surprises, and sudden deaths, viewers have come to expect, topped off with an (for now) ambiguous ending, that helps to wash away some of the bad aftertaste from Day 6.

Besides Almeida, characters returning from previous seasons include Chloe O'Brian (Mary Lynn Rajskub), Bill Buchanan (James Morrison), Aaron Pierce (Glenn Morshower), Morris O'Brian (Carlo Rota), and Kim Bauer (Elisha Cuthbert).  24 has always featured a tremendously talented cast, and Day 7 is no exception, with Cherry Jones, Jeffery Nordling, Janeane Garofalo, Bob Gunton, Sprague Graydon, Hakeem Kae-Kazim, Enuka Okuma, Ravi Kapoor, and Jon Voight.

24 Redemption a two hour prequel to Day 7, focused on the events in the African nation of Sangala, and introduced President Allison Taylor (Jones), Jonas Hodges (Voight), Colonel Ike Dubaku (Kazim), General Juma (Tony Todd) and Chief of Staff Ethan Kanin (Gunton), setting the stage for the events in Day 7.

Typically, Day 7 involves several major story arcs.  One involves the penetration of a government computer system, by terrorists who threaten the nation's air traffic control system.  Bauer and Walker work to stop the terrorists, and uncover a conspiracy that involves members of the federal government.  Sangalan General Juma leads an audacious assault on the White House, taking the President hostage, and threatening to cut her daughter Olivia's eyes out.  A beloved character makes the ultimate sacrifice, leaving Jack shaken, as this story arc closes.

There is still much more to come, as Jonas Hodges spearheads a plot by the private security company Starkwood, to employ a biological weapon that was developed in Sangala.  And Tony Almedia has much unfinished business to attend to.  Jack's exposure to a biological pathogen, is life-threatening, and gradually affects his ability to function.  The arrival of Kim Bauer, provides a slim hope for Jack's survival.  The finale is a massive emotional ride, with evil mastermind Alan Wilson (Will Patton) taken into custody, Jack and Renee having a deep heart to heart, the first family's drama in the White House, and Jack seeking absolution for his sins.  With Bauer in a coma and Kim by his side, the final dispensation of ""justice"" rests in another's hands.

In Day 7, reality is stretched and molded in manners normal for 24, and there are some rough spots, and a few totally illogical developments.  The setting in the vicinity of the Capitol, features mostly urban locations.  Still, those troubled by the trends in Day 6, and Day 5, may find the more focused storytelling in Day 7 more palatable and satisfying.  Kiefer Sutherland delivers another powerful performance, tough but also vulnerable.  Carlos Bernard transitions several times in Tony's bittersweet ""it's about justice"" return.  Anne Wersching has the challenging role and pivotal role as Agent Renee Walker, and her performance is powerful and compelling.  She fades a bit in the third quarter, but finishes strongly after taking over from Larry Moss.  There are many other standout performers, including Sprague Graydon, Jon Voight, Cherry Jones, Bob Gunton, Janeane Garofalo, Elisha Cuthbert, and as always Glenn Morshower as solid as a rock, Aaron Pierce.

As in previous seasons, a number of episodes have a commentary track.  Most are mildly informative, though some are more animated (Carlos Bernard), or amusing (Glenn Morshower), although unfortunately Sutherland, Jones,  Graydon, Voight, and Garofalo do not participate.  Among the extras are some deleted scenes, the best of which is a powerful, expanded initial meeting between Kim and Jack.  ""24-7 The Untold Story"" is a featurette detailing the writers' travails attempting to get the series back on track, after Day 6.  Perhaps only a program with the huge gravitas of 24, could afford to make such an admission.  Of interest is how the prequel 24 Redemption, ended up meshing nicely with the events in Day 7.

3251796,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"Everyone is raving about how they packaged the number of disks into such a small case.  Well, I must say it was neatly done and greatly appreciated in my collection of all 7 series that do take up a lot of room.  Season 7 was well-written and, as usual, a very timely theme.  It was a slap in the face of critics of extreme violence in 24, leading up to a lame season 6, toned down and boring to satisfy those that think there is more violence in 24 than there is in Family Guy.  They just don't get it.  The world is, obviously, a violent place to live now.  This came out pre-Guantanamo Bay closure and indictments for waterboarding and other forms of getting the information needed to protect this country regardless of the means.  Jack is Jack - there is no one like him and never will be, and he is not ashamed one bit for doing what he has had to do to ""save the world"" in every season.  Yes, the end does justify the means in matters of world terroism.  And throughout Season 7, Jack just put his head up, chin out, and told everyone he came in contact with that he would never have done anything differently.  I was shocked by the closure of CTU, kept trying to figure out what was going on with Tony, and respected those who came to understand what Jack is all about.  The series can be summed up in one scene where the President askes Jack if she can trust him, and he says - head held high - ""With all due respect, Madam President, ask around.""  I will always think Season 1 was the best, but will watch 24 until the executives take it off the air.  Jack is, and always will be, my hero.",1256947200,,1598,4.166123778501628

3251801,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"I have to admit, after a lackluster sixth season and what I thought was a disappointing TV movie (""24: Redemption""), I was worried that ""24""'s glory days were behind it. My confidence wasn't restored very much by the first eight episodes of season seven, either, which just seemed to be a rehash of all the same tired cliches from previous seasons. And then I had to leave the U.S. and didn't see the rest of the season until I returned recently and watched them on DVD. But I have to say, season seven improved greatly after the first episodes (the reason for this is explained by the writers on an extra on the DVDs), and the season as a whole definitely met my hopeful expectations. Jonas Hodges (Jon Voigt) was the best villain they've had in years, and turning Tony into an ambiguous figure (is he good or evil?) was an inspired turn for the series. And I loved the introduction of some truly positive Muslim characters for a change. It definitely proved to me that there's still life in ""24"" yet.

As for the DVD presentation, it is good but not up to the standards of the other seasons. While there are a few extra features and 14 deleted scenes, the deleted scenes pale in comparison to what was offered on previous ""24"" sets, which usually had literally dozens of deleted scenes. And also, what happened to the option to watch the deleted scenes within the episodes in which they appeared? On this set, you can only watch them as extras on the last disc - in every other season except for the first, you have the option to watch them at the end or else embedded within the season itself, which to me is much preferable and is one of the things which made the ""24"" sets unique. Perhaps the rush to get the season 7 set out as soon as it was finished airing, as opposed to releasing it several months later as was traditional, accounts for this drawback. Perhaps Fox is planning to release a special ""deluxe"" set for season 7 in the future which will have more deleted scenes - which wouldn't be surprising given their propensity for milking the hardcore fans for every penny they can get (such as the ""Special Edition"" of season 6 which was a blatant ripoff).

In short, a great year for ""24,"" but less than great for the producers of these DVDs.",1254787200,,2254,4.455205811138015

3251807,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"After a lengthy hiatus, Jack finally has another really bad day. I don't know how many more times Jack gets himself out only to be pulled back into the counter-terrorism gig, but 24: SEASON 7 demonstrates that there are still legs on this thing. In the show's internal continuity, four years have elapsed since the events in Season 6, and in the interim Jack had roamed from place to place in search of some kind of inner peace. Except I'm guessing that wasn't ever gonna work out.

The damnable writers' strike of 2007-08 delayed Season 7 for one year - which, as it turns out, was a blessing in disguise for the writers of 24 as they'd been stuck for ideas - and it wasn't until the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24-Redemption/dp/B001DMVZOE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24: Redemption</a>&nbsp;television movie came out that I finally became convinced that there really was gonna be a seventh year. I frankly thought 24 was done. But here's Jack Bauer again, scarred and wracked with guilt, his methods condemned, still saving the world.

As mentioned, four years had passed, and things haven't stayed the same. There's a new American President, a woman. CTU had been shut down, its tactics questioned and its operatives scattered. In Washington, D.C., Jack Bauer is on the verge of being indicted for past acts of brutality. But then a daring, broad daylight kidnapping puts Jack's trial on hold as the FBI seeks his expertise. Especially since one of the kidnappers is identified as Jack's old friend Tony Almeida, who isn't quite as deceased as everyone had assumed. From there, things quickly worsen.

I think it's a boost in the arm, switching things up, moving to D.C. and taking CTU out of the equation and putting in the FBI as Jack's new intel and tech support - although one character would refer to the FBI agency as ""CTU Lite."" This introduces a running theme (and a hot button topic), that of Jack's ruthlessly doing whatever it takes to achieve his objective versus the FBI's strictly by the book methods. There's a new supporting cast brought in, with FBI agent Renee Walker impacting Jack the most. Agent Walker, in some ways, demonstrates how someone, under extreme duress and in light of horrific circumstances, can be swayed into adopting Jack's perspective. Her boss and friend cautions her: ""Renee, we're FBI, not CTU. We honor the law."" But how do you hold back when the price of idealism is possibly thousands of murdered lives? The most startling thing for me, though, may have been when Janeane Garafalo shows up as an FBI computer analyst. Talk about wonderful counter-casting.

Season 7 basically unfolds in three stages, starting out as a follow up to 24: REDEMPTION as Jack and the FBI go up against the murderous warlord of Sangala. 24 still reeks of extreme paranoia and pervasive conspiracies, so it shouldn't be a surprise when Jack and Walker learn that things go much deeper than the Sangalan plot. There are layers and layers of duplicity.

In another front, there's good focus on the President, effectively portrayed by Cherry Jones, as the American government once again falls under siege. There are sub-plots involving the suicide of her son and the alienation of her daughter. And, as usual, you never quite know who you can trust in the White House, in that most elite inner circle.

It's pretty cool that Carlos Bernard is back, which means that Tony Almeida is back, or rather a darker, even more smoldering version of Tony. But it's almost like old times seeing him and Jack side by side again. They're eventually joined by other familiar faces, including one of my old favorites, Glenn Morshower, as straight-shooting Special Agent Aaron Pierce, the only guy other than Kiefer to have appeared in all of the seasons so far.

Political intrigue, deadly espionage, riveting human drama, that blurring of ethics. 24 continues to be one of the best - if not THE best - thrill rides on television. That ominous beat we hear each time we glimpse the digital clock counting down, it's still pulse pounding to me. As the episodes progress, I fall in line with the pervasive mood of the show, and I trust no one and I constantly look for twists because there are plot reversals everywhere. We're still treated to storytelling that is complex and both plot and character driven, and the series still rides on the strength of its technical merits. And, except for Jack, each character in the show is expendable. Key players bite the bullet. Jack's actions provoke debate even as he remains the best guy out there to clean up the mess.

24: SEASON 7 comes in six discs, with a cast & crew audio commentary on a whopping 12 episodes: ""8am-9am"" (Producer/Director Jon Cassar & actor Carlos Bernard); ""10am-11am"" (Producers Manny Coto & Brannon Braga, & Carlos Bernard); ""12pm-1pm"" (Producer/Director Jon Cassar & actor Annie Wersching); ""4pm-5pm"" (Producer David Fury & actor Hakeem Kae-Kazim); ""5pm-6pm"" (Producers Manny Coto & Brannon Braga, & Annie Wersching); ""7pm-8pm"" (Producer/Director Brad Turner & actor Tony Todd); ""8pm-9pm"" (Producer/Director Brad Turner, Composer Sean Callery, & actor James Morrison); ""9pm-10pm"" (Producers Evan Katz & Juan Carlos Moto, actors Annie Wersching & Bob Gunton); ""1am-2am"" (Producer Howard Gordon, Carlos Bernard, & Jeffrey Nordling); ""5am-6am"" (Producer Evan Katz, actors Mary Lynn Rajskub & Glenn Morshower); ""6am-7am"" (Producers David Fury, Alex Gansa, and actor Glenn Morshower); and ""7am-8am""(Producers Howard Gordon & Jon Cassar). It's always fun soaking in the actors' behind-the-scene commentaries, but I'm wondering how come Kiefer didn't drop by for a few words?

Other special features include: 14 deleted scenes with optional commentary from Producers Stephen Kronish & Paul Gadd (including an emotional 6-minute scene with Kiefer and a familiar face); ""The Fimucite Festival Presents: The Music of 24"" - Composer/conductor Sean Callery and the Tenerife Film Orchestra & Choir perform the score from 24 live at the Guimer Theater in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Canary Islands (13 minutes long); ""Hour 19: The Ambush"" - we follow the f/x crew as they prep to blow up a building near the L.A.X. area (12:45 minutes); and ""24-7: The Untold Story"" - the show's writers reflect on the disappointment of Season 6, on the need for the show to reinvent itself, and then on the long, strenuous struggle to come up with a working story for Season 7 (almost 16 minutes long).

Some things to look out for and maybe even savor:

- First and foremost, Jack just being Jack, getting the job done, inhabiting that grey moral area; Kiefer Sutherland rules all

- Tony Almeida alive and very much in the thick of things

- The ongoing Ugly Chick Cyber War between Garafalo and Mary Lynn Rajskub

- Yet another indecisive turnip for an American Vice-President (I don't know, 24 seems to enjoy featuring VPs who hem and haw)

- If you're a fan of POPULAR, then nostalgia might kick in as Carly Pope shows up for a few episodes; oddly enough, her character's name is still Sam

- One of the no-nonsense bad guys looks like a leaner, meaner Tracy Morgan",1253318400,6,7158,4.997481108312343

3251815,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"Off its heels of its worst season yet, the seventh season of ""24"" was given high expectations by fans and critics alike even more than when Season 5 ended back in 2006 (the show's best season by far).  While it met most of its expectations and then didn't, it was a surprise return to form as a show that everyone was starting to think was about to kick the bucket returned with a tour de force attitude.

Like any other ""24"" season, however, it suffers from filler, outrageous plotlines, but most of them are absent this time, almost equaling (but not quite) the amount of filler and ridiculous plotlines of season 5 (there were hardly any in that season).

Unlike the previous season, the new cast in season 7 is exciting, engaging, and engrossing.  We finally get a new female Jack Bauer, Renee Walker, but she just isn't quite there yet, she has a hard time going above the law to save her country.  Her former lover and boss, Larry Moss, heads her FBI unit, who is totally against the man that is Jack Bauer, but over the day, learns that Jack Bauer isn't an evil man, he's trying to save his country.

Cherry Jones commands her role as President Allison Taylor, who is the most liberal president ever featured on ""24"", and a nice departure from the usual president on ""24"".  She's the most free of corruption out of any of the character on the show, and a leader that might be too good to be true in the real world.  Carlos Bernard returns from the dead as Tony Almedia, which was a very controversial decision, but it played out okay in the end.

More favorites from previous seasons like Chloe O'Brian and Bill Buchanan return as well, but like with all ""24"" seasons, key characters and characters we have grown to love and admire are killed off unexpectedly, and even the heroes suffer a fate this time around that might be unavoidable.

I'd recommend renting this product or have seen it first before your purchase it, but all in all, this season was pretty damn good.  It'd be a shame to miss it.",1252022400,,2007,4.471232876712329

The show had been questioned for brutality and disobeyment of laws in the press. So the producers added a scene where Jack Bauer explains what he had to do to a senate comitee. There are some twists in this season the authors would not have put in the ones before, that make Jack more a person than in the previous episodes. Just take a look and you know what I mean.

However, I lost hope briefly but when I saw the premiere of season 7, I was astounded at how much better and 'classic' 24 it was. The plot took unsuspecting turns which made me wonder if the real bad guys were going to get caught, and who was going to die next. Admittedly some plot points were predictable, but you come to expect that from any TV show.

The cover was also far better than season 6 (WTF?) with a long shot of Jack - and the box!

Excellent performances by major cast members Sutherland, Bernard, Cherry Jones and Annie Wersching add to the astounding season.

3251819,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"Honestly, I feel that Season Seven may have been the best season yet. Of course I have my complaints about it, and I'll run through my complaints quickly:

1: The story of Season 7 basically pretended Season 6 never happened. Probably due to the critical reception of Season 6. But there was a lot more continuity from Season 5, and most of the major storylines of Season 6 were ignored.

2: Janis Gold, Janeane Garafalo's character: Janeane Garafalo can be an okay actress, but I don't think her performance was up to the standards of 24. Also, her character barely even did anything meaningful, other than a few fun exchanges with Chloe.

3, the biggest one: The ending of the season. It was exactly the ending I expected, and it left all the loose ends hanging. After such a strong season, anyone who wanted any kind of closure at the end will be sorely disappointed. I know 24 is kinda known for that, but not to the level that Season 7 had.

But all that said, Season 7 was still fantastic. As for what was good about the season, I don't even know where to start. The new setting, Washington D.C. was a great backdrop and brought something new and fresh to the series. The new actors brought in were fantastic. Everyone was talking about Cherry Jones as President Allison Taylor, but personally I was more excited about the first gentleman Henry Taylor, played by Colm Feore. I've always been a fan of Feore and his storyline was very good. Renee Walker was also a great new character. I was also very excited by the returns of two of my favorite characters in the series, Tony Almeida and Kim Bauer, both of whom we didn't see in Season 6.

The villains were amazing. My favorites were Jonas Hodges (played by Jon Voight), Ike Dubaku and the aforementioned Tony (who switched between being a good guy and bad guy several times this season. With mood swings like that you'd think he was suffering from PMS or something). But the other villains were great as well.

I could go on and on about the greatness of this season. But I'll just sum it up by saying, you have to see it if you haven't. It was incredible.

As for the omission of the 7th disk, which usually has the extras, that wasn't too big of an issue. There are still extras. There's audio commentary for 12 episodes, as well as three featurettes (spread around with one each on disk 1, disk 5, and disk 6). There are deleted scenes as well, but not quite as many as previous seasons. Overall, they definitely could've included more extras, and just put them on disks 2, 3 and 4 where there weren't any. The 7th disk wasn't necessary.

Speaking of which, I remember when the first reviewers posted their reviews for this DVD, they all complained about the packaging. Because it wasn't the same as the older boxed sets and they omitted the seventh disk. But now that the DVD has been out for a while, people are actually buying it and noticing how great the packaging really is. It's really the best packaging job ever for a multi-disk DVD. This should be the way all TV series' are released on DVD. In fact, they should re-release all 6 previous seasons of 24 in this style of packaging. Just spread the special features among the 6 disks rather than having a 7th disk, like they did for this.

Overall, great season, great packaging. Extras could've been better, but that's a minor gripe. Definitely get this one from Amazon as the price (as I'm writing this), $22.99 is by far the best price you can find for a new copy. Just buy this with an additional cheap item (like a 24: Declassified paperback) to bump the price over $25 and get free shipping as well! Highly recommended.",1251763200,2,3645,4.502269288956127
3251820,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"In fact, when I bought season 7 of 24, I already have seen the serie on a streaming site available in France.

As it was not French subtiltled, I must admit I lost some parts of the action because of my poor understanding of English (obviously not when Ivorian actor Isaak de Banchole spoke in French with the actress assumed to be his wife, both being legal Executives of fictious state of Sangala).

But I think I understood the majority of the action (it's not very difficult) and I appreciated all the show, waiting eagerly each week for a new episode.

As I saw that the DVD was released in the US the morning after the last episode was released, with French subtitles and at a very moderate price (and the level of the US dollar compared to to the Euro is from some help), I couldn't prevent myself to buy it, so that my wife could see the season and understand it.

In France, it will be aired beginning 10th of September, on a cable channel, and not released in DVD before at least one year.

The only added value I will get with this cable channel is to see Redemption, with French subtitles and keep it in the case of season seven (if I could find some place because of the packaging !) I have bought a second examplaryof 24 season 7 on Amazon to offer to a friend, fan like us of 24.

If you liked or disliked the seventh season or what happened in it doesn't really matter to me.  I wanted to hear more about the quality of the Blu-ray than who Jack Bauer killed.

I have not seen the season and was waiting to buy it on Blu-Ray before I watched it until I saw on the front package that it was a 6 disc set.  WTF???  When I saw that I put it back down and walked away mad as hell!  My PlayStation 3 does a great job of upgrading my tv shows on DVD to the point were I don't need to buy Blu-ray disc yet and can wait until the price drops.  HOWEVER, the one reason I would purchase a tv show on Blu-ray is because the whole season should be on only ONE, maybe TWO disc being it holds 25GB of data per disc.  I don't want to play around with changing disc when I don't have to.

I have all the seasons of Married with Children (except the last season which comes out in November) and I know all the espoides from each season would fit on only ONE disc and that's what I want.  I want that with all the tv shows I would buy on Blu-ray and won't purchase a tv show on Blu-ray until that's how it is.

My issue is that 24 should consist of only two disc and that's it.  Why do I have to fumble with 6 disc like I would have to with DVDs?  I saw target had each season on DVD for $19 each and that's what I'm going to buy.  I'm pissed that I waited so long for 24 to be on Blu-ray just to have to go buy it on DVD instead.  Whom ever made the decision to spread it over more than two disc is a moron and should be fired.",1251072000,,1673,3.836734693877551

3251827,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"A surprisingly enjoyable season. Let's face it, this series really should have run its course by now. How many near-deaths can Jack survive? How many government conspiracies can there be?

Yes, there are a few times that it's a bit preposterous (i.e. the storming of the White House???). But complaining about such things is like complaining that water is wet - you knew that going in, so why are you surprised?

The first 5-6 episodes were my favorites, as it had a ""let's put the band back together"" feeling. ""Looks, there's Jack!"" ""And Bill and Chloe!"" ""And Tony! - hey, isn't he dead?"" The middle bogged down a bit, especially with the aforementioned WH scenes, but then the last 4-5 episodes really picked back up. The best part of '24' is guessing who the traitors are, and who's on the up-and-up. They did a good job of camouflaging the bad guy(s), and it came as a shock even to me when the turnabout was played. Cool!

Basically, if you like the show, then you'll like Season 7, it an above average version of the same things you've seen since 2001. And if you don't like the show, then this won't convert you (but then again, nothing probably will).",1250640000,,1159,4.5625
3251828,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"Before you read on, I want to state that the seventh season has not aired yet in Singapore. Thus, I bought it after reading the reviews offered here before I jumped the gun, so to speak. This review is intended to introduce new viewers as well as entice existing, but jaded viewers after a disappointing sixth season.

`24' is a seven-year-long television series about an anti-hero, Jack Bauer (played by real-life, testosterone, alpha-male, Kiefer Sutherland). He used to head the now defunct, de-listed, Counter-Terrorist Unit or CTU. In other words, over-worked, under-paid civil servants who lead secret lives about what they do (and may be eager to do it all over again, given the secret handshake).

In each episode (beginning at 8.00am), which lasts one hour (`real time') per episode, we witness the multitude of news-making, events that lead up to the last hour of the day. Essentially, the premise of this series is a doomsday plot that has subversives intending to overthrow a leadership, or destroy public property, or harm lives. Not very optimistic scenarios - definitely controversial, and leverages on our current fears and conspiracy theories.

I admit I was glued to this box set. Predictably, as we have grown to appreciate, there is a surprise or revelation in each hour. Stay awake though, or you be thrown off-guard! The question on our mind is: Will Jack save the day? (After six seminal seasons, we are now on a first-name basis). Can the day get any worst? Apparently, it can. Murphy's Law has been upgraded to Vista proportions!

Jack Bauer, once a hero is now a rogue agent has the choice to leave his past behind (and keep running). However, he seems drawn to tough choices that connect his sense of humanity with `doing the right thing'. His personal values attract him to these life-threatening situations that coaxes the viewer to ask: `Why me?' Such is the schedule of the supra-hero who destiny is to save the world. Oh, by the way, his sense of rescuing the world has led him to making painful sacrifices (physically and emotionally). There is a price to pay for the choices he makes. Either's Bauer's karma is to continue to save the world until his expiration date, or we wonder - hey, this guy has bad timing when it comes to his timetable! To add insult to injury, according to one bad character on one season: `Why is it that people around you tend to die?'

The character, Lieutenant John McClane on the Die Hard franchise, has a similar stroke of karmic disarray. He tends, too, to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. His consolation is: `Someone has to do it!' Either these anti-heroes are too competent, they can get `down and dirty', or they need to get a personal assistant.

Isn't it ironical that, sometimes, the choices we make are based on those we care for? Aren't choices easier to make when these pertain to us? Isn't being selfish easier than being considerate and generous? There are truly some very hard decisions to make in life.

You can choose to buy this set if you have not watched it. The plot is fast-paced as expected. The plot is more believable and possible, not merely plausible. There is more density to each of the key characters we have grown to relate. The kicker is what happens to Bauer in the last few hours. Plus, it all takes place in the capitol. Will there be an eighth season? I suspect so, and I look forward to more creative outputs from the writers.",1250553600,,3435,4.696013289036545

I stopped watching the Season 7 broadcast as soon as Tony showed up. But, out of loyalty, I decided I should see the whole thing. I'm glad I checked it out of the library and didn't waste my money on it.

It's sort of sad to see one of your favorite shows fall to such depths, but at least one can remember the better times. Season 1 was a compelling conceptual start. Season 2 saw the show at its peak, then a slow gradual decline through Season 5, but it was still very good. And then the cliff.

7th season BD set is HORRIBLE.
2 things that make it bad - super slow loading time and over - sharpened noisy digital transfer.

The first one is just a pain. I have a Samsung player, 2 week old upgrade of the firmware, and most disks load within 20 seconds. This set loads - I am not kidding you - 5 minutes each disk!! Basically, I come home, turn it on first thing, and go to the kitchen to micro a burrito, pop a beer, come back - it's still loading, i check my email, do stretches, and only then i hear the sound of Menu showing up, so I sit down to watch it. And mind you - this loading takes place EVERY TIME you do anything with the disk - since it's connected via HDMI (bi-directional)- I once decided to switch TV to HDMI cable to check DVR recordings - BAD IDEA. Bluray player knows I interrupted my interest - it stops the disk. There is no resume on this disk either. If you stopped in the middle of the show - if you switched disks or anything - it's LOADING TIME again. And back to the Menu.
If you think it's my player - think again - I watch tons of bluray disks on it, and only some give me such headaches - this set is one of them. And for what!!!! The Menu is just plain old Gzooonk-gzooonk with the ""24"" signature Clunking Sound (I love this part actually).

The picture is somehow dotty - as if 1080 was too much for it - can't really tell. I have a very good new TV set, and things look very nice and smooth normally. this is a minor thing, of course, since it doesn't distract from viewing.

One more thing. Some ""genius"" decided to stick a special about the score onto the very 1st disk - it's a great special, but BEWARE - there are images from further episodes and they are spoilers!

I hope the disk authoring company would take a look at reviews and do a better job next time.

While it does not maybe reach the heights of frenzy of earlier seasons, it does get quite agitated in the second half. It is also slightly less violent than season 6 which makes it less nasty which is good. Then on the other hand there is a lot of ""torture is not ok but i still do it"" blabla by Jack Bauer and even others. This season also does not have the previous series' potential for racist accusations since now the terrorists are homegrown. This also leads to a slightly oversentimental episode involving some innocent arabs taken into the plot...my my my...otherwise it is impressively acted and directed.

However, this show needs to get rid of the whole presidents storyline.  This new one was just aweful, the lady can't act, and she's not as commanding looking as the guy from The Unit.  Now that he's been gone and Logan's storyline is concluded, they should just go a different route; without a president storyline.  The only good thing about this one was that Aaron apprears and does some stuff.  Also bring back agent Doyle(Ricky Schroeder)for the next seasonda nd maybe have him and jack in intertwining stories.  But no more politics.  It gets old having a terrorist in each season holding the presidnet hostage or blackmailing him.  Just do CTU stuff; the field and the base.  No more presidnet storyulines please the last lady killed it for me.  But I'll still watch it.  Although if the presidnet stuff continues, I'll just record it and watch it later.

Actually, this season should be known as the Bush-bashing season. I'm no fan of Bush but the writers were so transparent as they dredged up every liberal point of contention. Starkwood (Black Water) and all defense contractors are evil! Coercive interrogation is evil! Recognizing the fact that Muslims are the main cause of terrorism around the world is evil! And, last but not least, stem cell techniques could save us all from everything (if only for the evil Mr. Bush). They even mentioned declaring someone an enemy combatant so they could do anything they wanted to them (cheap reference to Gitmo). Gee, did the writers miss anything? Oh, and giving Janeane Garofalo, of all people, a venue to parade her handwringing liberalism was a deliberate slap at 24's overwhelmingly conservative audience. Liberals just can't pass up a chance to shove their crap in your face.

Moving the show to Washington DC was a good change of scenery...if only they had kept it in DC.  FYI, there is no such as thing as the Port of Alexandria.  The nearest port capable of handling those shipping containers is Baltimore.  Minor point I know and I'm sure a lot of LA residents had similar points about seasons 1-6.

As for the plot.  It had promise to start with.  Bauer brought back to get preached to by holier-than-thou Senators about his behavior with the now disbanded CTU.  Then there is a terrorist threat (surprise).  Bauer gets called to the FBI to be an expert because Tony Almedia (back from the dead) is apparently behind it!!!  Shock!...yeah I totally didn't buy that.

So Bauer teams up with Agent Walker who is at a fork in the road...does she follow Bauer into the ""at any cost"" way of preventing terrorists or does she follow the laws that may hinder the investigation?  It was a nice reflection of what is going on in the country right now.

That's really where my praise for the season ends.  Spoilers ahead.

The plot twists...saw them coming a mile away.  Why?  They've all been done before and they were so set up that there was no surprise.  Especially Tony's multiple plot twists.  Totally unbelieveable, even for 24.
The First Dude's plotline for the first half of the season...really didn't care.  That doesn't make me cold, it just added nothing to the season.
The attack on the White House?  Yeah....uh huh.  I'm all for suspending reality to watch 24 but when its so over the top that we're in a totally different dimension, you've lost my interest.

And we had another season where the real bad guys are evil white American guys trying to control the nation.  Its time to get off this conspiracy stuff.  Seasons 1 and 4 were the only seasons when it was dedicated counterterrorism instead of unraveling a giant conspiracy.

There was also a noticable lack of action in this season.  There were maybe 3-4 firefights?  They had the opportunity to have so much more action but failed.  This is 24, not a soap opera...enough of the ""will she/won't she"" on whether Agent Walker will go with Jack.  Enough of the teary-eyed moments of self-reflection.

Hopefully, Season 8 will have Jack Bauer interrogating the writers for Season 7 so he can learn the location of the real writers and he'll go rescue them in time for Season 9.

If it weren't for Jon Voight's acting and Agent Walker, it would have gotten 1 star.",1245369600,5,2690,4.579831932773109

There is some grain and light noise throughout the season, but it is never distracting. The image detail is much better than previous seasons of 24 on DVD. The DTS Master Audio track is also a significant upgrade from the Dolby Digital tracks that accompany the DVD releases. While 24 season 7 doesn't look as good as seasons of Lost do on BluRay, it is still a noticeable improvement over the DVD and worth owning.",1244764800,,558,4.470588235294118
3251884,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"Firstly, the long wait for this 7th season of 24 was well worth it. Keifer Sutherland and the cast and crew really pulled out all the stops with this newest day of terror. You start off immediately by finding out that CTU has been disbanded and it's 4 years from the events of season 6. Jack Bauer, played by Keifer Sutherland, is on trial for his various crimes and infractions built up by the previous seasons. But the trial is interrupted by FBI agent Renee Walker, played by Annie Wersching, saying that Jack is needed to help out with a priority situation. A rash of attacks built up to a kidnapping perpetrated by the supposedly deceased Tony Almeida, played by Carlos Bernard.

Now for die hard fans of 24, they'll remember in season 5 that Almeida was not given the traditional silent countdown usually given to a hero who has died. So fans were speculating that Tony would be revived in some way shape or form. In the meantime we do see reappearances of the following characters, mind you the character list includes the amazing actors who played them.

Bill Buchanan - James Morrison
  -- Morrison provides audio commentary on an episode

Chloe O Brian - Mary Lynn Rajskub
  -- Rajskub also provides an audio commentary

Morris O Brian - Carlo Rota

Now for those who have seen and bought the prequel movie, 24-Redemption, they'll remember the chain of events leading up to season 7. Keep in mind, it is not exactly necessary for viewers to have watched the prequel movie, but it does help in back story for events dealing with the white house and the new president played brilliantly by Cherry Jones.

This season is the most action packed, story driven, character driven, cliffhanger of a season that 24 has ever produced. You see new main characters, you see the deaths of multiple characters. I won't spoil too many details for newer viewers of the show. But we also get the inclusion into the villainy by two top notch actors, Will Patton and most importantly the incredible Jon Voight.

And you'll definitely get irked as I did at the ending of season 7. For that is the ultimate cliffhanger. Jack Bauer has made sacrifice after sacrifice to protect his country. He's lost almost everything he could have ever lost. And in the process of defending his country for day 7, he gets infected by a weaponized gas that has no known cure. Jack Bauer lays dying. His daughter Kim, played by Elisha Cuthbert, arrives to say goodbye to Jack. But Kim isn't ready to let her father go.

All I'll say no is that it'd better not take as long to give us the answers in season 8.",1244764800,,2579,4.582608695652174

3251891,5,B000Y7ZBZS,can't wait for season 8 we didn't watch this on regular tv we waited for the dvd to come out great!!!!!!,1243987200,,104,4.0
3251892,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"I hadn't watched one episode of ""24"" during its first six seasons. That was until this year when the seventh season of the Emmy Award winning show made its long awaited premiere (the seventh season was suppost to have aired last year but was pushed back because of the writer's strike). The Fox network moved one of my favorite shows, ""House, M.D."", from Tuesday nights to Monday nights and aired right before ""24"". So I got my first taste of this action packed series, and after viewing all of the episodes of season seven on DVD, now I'm hooked. The seventh season of ""24"" was the best TV series of the 2008-09 season. Yes, it was even better than the two current TV shows that I watched: ""House, M.D."" and ""Desperate Housewives"". And I plan to go back and catch up on the first six seasons which I haven't seen yet.

""24"" follows the adventures of Federal Agent Jack Bauer, who through the first six seasons has stopped bombs, viruses, assassination attempts, etc., and has saved hundreds of lives in the process. Each season has played out in real time in a twenty-four hour frame of a very bad day for Jack and everyone else involved with what's going on. I got to see this play out for the entire seventh season and it was fascinating, not to mention scary, exciting, thrilling, suspenseful, and spectacular, usually all at the same time. But what really made season seven of ""24"" so special is the talented acting, writing, and directing that came together. There was hardly a boring moment in every frame of all 24 episodes.

The plot of season seven deals with terrorists attacking the nation's capital, usually with the aide of people on the inside who you think are good but turn out to be bad. Make that very bad. There are so many villains that I couldn't keep track of them. And there are moments where you don't know who the characters can trust. From the early episodes with endangered airplanes in the sky to the middle episodes with a terrorist attack on the White House to the later episodes with Jack Bauer fighting for his life after being exposed to a lethal toxic gas, I was really amazed at how good this season of ""24"" was. This is TV drama at its finest.

The acting is first-rate. Kiefer Sutherland was already a big movie star when he made the switch to the small screen in 2001 when ""24"" made its debut. But this show made him an even bigger star. Sutherland, who has usually played bad guys in the movies, got a chance to play a good guy and even though I haven't seen the first six seasons he must have been really good right from the start. He won a Golden Globe in 2002 and an Emmy in 2006 as proof. And I'm sure he'll be in the Emmy running again this year because in season seven he's brilliant. Also brilliant: Cherry Jones, who made her ""24"" debut in season seven as female U.S. President Allison Taylor. Jones delivered powerhouse performances in many of the episodes, and if she doesn't receive an Emmy nomination for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series this year, then it will be proof that the Emmy voters don't have any brains. Not only does she deserve to be nominated, I think she should win. Great acting gets big awards, and Jones did a great job this season. I'm alreadly looking forward to seeing her again in season eight. The other supporting actors did terrific work too. From series regulars Carlos Bernard, Mary Lynn Rajskub, and James Morrison to series newcomers Annie Wersching, Janeane Garofalo, Bob Gunton, and Jeffrey Nordling, as well as special guest appearences from Oscar winning actor Jon Voight, everyone does a great professional job here. The acting is not the only strong asset of the seventh season of ""24"". The writing and directing is excellent as well.

Don't miss the seventh season of ""24"". It's television drama at its best.",1243728000,,3805,4.574780058651027

Just when you think that the writing can't be any better, they exceed expectations.  This series goes deep into the terrorist plots that are both realistic, and complicated.  And while it seems a bit far-fetched at times, you will find yourself looking at today's politics and deciding that it is not altogether outrageous....this makes the series even more fun.

3251894,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"First, I read the reviews and wondered if it was preorder or ship now due to people's complaints. I have the set in hand, and bought Season 6 at the same time. I got a great deal for some reason on Amazon, and paid $43 for both seasons. If you wait until it hits stores, it'll probably be around $50 each as other seasons have been.

I for the life of me can't figure out why people are giving negative reviews because of the packaging. Um, ok...this product sucks because it comes in a small package. WHAT? I can agree with the one comment about missing the Bonus cd and Redemption. Those would be nice. But, the small package will fit nicely on a shelf. Duh.

As to the show...either you love 24 or you hate it. I agree that Season 6 was terrible, and Season 7 repeated some plots that I am tired of. But, it's still 24. It's still the most intense show on tv. It still gets me excited, even with repeated plots. I will still watch every episode.",1243555200,,948,4.2032967032967035

Compare to other Blu Ray discs (Iron Man, Quantum of Solace, The Dark Knight..) and you will think you're watching an up-scaled DVD.

There's always a breech in the system, always having a character from inside CTU and now the FBI and the federal government committing treason. I think the show is on it's last leg unless the creators come up with something truly innovative. But Jack is still my idol.",1243296000,3,442,4.6075949367088604
3251900,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"After the grisly maiming of 24 in season six, Jon Cassar and Howard Gordon brought Jack out of the civics lessons of S.6 and brought them back to the level of intensity and GRAVITAS to 24.

I think that Season Seven, while being very good, suffered from an unfortunately rushed finale that gave a lot of fans pause, considering how dragged out some of the other last few eps of the season felt. It's hard not to see Jack in all-out action, and that's where the season started to feel a little lethargic. But in exchange for Jack being on the sidelines for a bit, we did get a GREAT plot twist that I will not give away for those who don't watch the show near the end that gave a certain important character even more to work with.

The themes of the season are two-fold: Betrayal being the big theme, and the most civic-minded one - how does one condone the 'enhanced interrogation' techniques that Jack and other agents use to acquire life-saving information. The second theme seems to get thrown under the bus for a few eps, but then comes back nearer the end as FBI Agent Renee Walker, who, at first dealings with Jack, is an obvious opponent of torture, sees what she may have to become in order to protect the greater good.

What makes Jack a great action hero is that in those moments where dozens, hundreds, thousands, or in a few cases for Jack, millions of innocent lives are on the line, he knows that he has to do whatever it takes to save those people, and sometimes that requires a proverbial twist of the thumbscrews. What makes Jack a great character is that while he says that he doesn't regret those moments, he knows that there's a line that shouldn't be crossed.

There have been people who maintain that this show is an outline for the justification of torture in extreme scenarios, and I think that it's high time that those good folk shut up and enjoy the OBVIOUS hyper-realism of 24. Look at Jack Bauer for a few minutes. He's literally died twice (possibly three times) during the run of the show (S2 when his heart stopped due to being tortured himself and S4 where they had to fake his death in order to prevent his murder). This show runs so far off the rails of conceivable realism that we cannot use this program as a microcosm of society's faults and triumpths. It's a great, pulse-pounding, thrill-a-minute action show.

Remember in DIRTY HARRY when Callahan shoots the Scorpio killer and then steps on his wounded leg in order to extract information? Remember how good that felt because Harry's the good guy and the Scorpio's the bad guy? It's not supposed to be real. It's supposed to be entertainment. Get off the ""24 CONDONES TORTURE"" kick. Seriously. It's tired.

Take 24 for what it is: Great entertainment.

Except for Season 6. That was not good.",1243209600,7,2785,4.535856573705179
3251901,2,B000Y7ZBZS,"season 7 is little more than a 24 hour editorial in favor of torture.  its proponents (mainly jack bauer of course) are portrayed as strong and wordly, and its opponents weak and out of touch with reality.  if one can suspend one's dismay at this very pervasive propaganda, the episode is undoubtedly exciting and much better than season six.  hence the two stars.",1243209600,4,364,4.746031746031746

This season kept me glued to my seat and wanting more. They keep adding new blood as well as paying homage to the past characters. I can't wait until season eight.

I loved that it was released the day after the season finale. I hope this is a trend that continues. I hated waiting to get my 24 fix.

The packaging was great. I love the slim design and the discs were easy to get out and were organized well. Much better than the bulky sets of the past.",1243209600,5,617,4.220338983050848
3251903,1,B000Y7ZBZS,"Really, if you plan to watch this season, you have to abandon any sense of reason and logic. It's the only way that you might find any kind of enjoyment in this steaming pile. But too not just be bashing, let me explain (though I know that the hardcore fans will consider this ""not helpful"", though I would dare them to find fault in the following explanation:-))

24 has never really been about realism, but the first 4 seasons or so were at least believable, given a willing audience. As a viewer, you could relate to what motivated the characters, and even the scenarios, however far fetched they were, did make sense in themselves (again, if you were willing). Since season 5, that's definitely gone overboard, but this season takes the cake.

Let me give you an example: Double agents are believable (given some reasonable motivation). Triple agents are already hard to sell to anybody who is not entirely braindead, but even then you could come up with a plot that works. But quadrupel agents? Yes, season 7 of 24 features the first quadrupel agent (or rather character) in the history of story telling. So you find out that the bad guy is actually a good guy playing the bad guys. Until his real motivation turns out to be that behind his ""good guy playing bad"" routine there is a ""bad guy playing good guy playing bad"" routine... but no, he is in fact a ""rogue avenger playing the bad guy playing the good guy playing the bad guy"". Yes, it is that silly! That's not clever story telling, nor is it a clever plot twist... that's just weak in every respect, and it also goes to show what the creators of 24 must think of it's audience. To be fair, I guess that this is the silliest point of the current season - though not the only one. Other highlights of stupidity are a double agent working for the terrorists, who's wife happens to be jeopardized by the terrorist operation, such that he takes action to save her - while at the same time making sure that she gets out safely. So how did this come about in the first place? Did this guy get the dates confused in his filofax? ""Oh, no terrorist attack today, my wife can go""... ""oh no, wait - ah, she's already gone"". Then there's this guy - actually a good guy - who is kidnapped and finally forced to blow himself up, because otherwise the terrorists will find his family and hurt them... They don't have his family yet, and the good guys are just around the corner, and could save him. How threatening is that? How believable is it that this guy would blow himself up?

So what else is stupid? I don't know about you, but I would expect a professional attitude and work ethics in agencies such as the FBI or the CTU, fictional or not. I just cannot imagine that sensitive positions within such agencies would be staffed with emotional people who are suspicious of everyone and everything to the point that figures of authority are constantly questioned, opposed, or even deceived, collegues are intrigued against, and in a time of crisis, people are more concerned with messing with each other than working on the problem.  The people in the 24 universe are always getting in each others face. In every season! How believable is that? The highlight in this season in that respect is the continuous debating among the president and her staff, but the FBI people among themselves also show off some really unprofessional behaviour. They're acting more like tribesmen in the time of Ghengis Khan. It wouldn't be surprising to me if one of the subordinates started fighting the current leader for the ruling position of the tribe... (oh wait, that actually happens all the time in 24, doesn't it?).

Computer security is also incredibly easy to hack around in the 24 universe. But then again, in one scene in 24 we have the FBI lady geek telling us that the encryption of some data was done on a personal PC with custom encryption software, not on a government machine, which makes it very hard to crack. So if custom (as in PC market) software provides higher security than what the government agencies in the 24 universe can use, I guess that it's believable that computer security is about as hard to crack as stepping off the sidewalk.

While on the topic of computer security and silly plot lines: 24 kicks off with the same really braindead idea that was used in Die Hard 4: Apparently, it was deemed very smart in the universe of 24 to hook up all vital civilian installations to a single network, such that they can be centrally controlled and monitored. Power plants, chemical and biological installations, airtraffic control, you name it. All on the same network. And now get this: Because this is so important, they install one firewall... as in FOR ALL SYSTEMS! That's right: If that one single firewall is hacked, then ALL SYSTEMS can be manipulated. Even for people who know absolutely nothing about computer security, that idea must be totally silly. Forget about the fact that government monitoring of private installations is something that is in itself already a WTF.

The show has turned into a braindead collection of conspiracies and action sequences, wrapped together by plot lines which are unbelievable (makes you wonder what they wasted the time given the shows delay... they certainly didn't spend it on writing), weak characters, and - very clear in this season - bad acting. The realtime aspect, which made the show unique, has already been ditched since season 3, which makes that constantly ticking clock seem like a farce.

That said, I had really high hopes for this season, what with the producers boasting the ""reboot"" and all, but having finished it, I can say that 24 is something I won't bother to watch again. It's just too bad that really clever shows with good writing get killed while trash like this keeps being created.",1243123200,24,5819,4.659201557935735
3251904,2,B000Y7ZBZS,"First off, let me say that this is the first time I've bought a season of a television show on blu ray. I'm really quite disappointed. The constant-- and seemingly arbitrary--shifts between nice clear shots and what I can only assume are intentionally grainy shots (for artistic purposes I suppose), are irksome and really throw into question the purpose of having this on blu ray to begin with. I like blu ray in general, but I wish I had gotten the regular dvd version of this and saved 12 bucks.

As for the season itself, I've been a follower of 24 since the beginning, and this season is, I must say, the weakest of the 7. I, like most, was disappointed with season 6 and was looking forward to a return to form for the show. Most seem to think season 7 IS a return to form but I disagree. In addition to being poorly constructed, the writers have returned to all the same narrative devices that were exhausted after the first few seasons--moles in the government, machiavellian relatives, tiresome on-screen debating about the ethics of torture (let the audience debate Jack's methods, don't resort to simplistic middle-school level on-screen disputes--it's creative writing 101 that you SHOW don't TELL), twists you can see coming a mile away, the impossible choice scenario, characters complaining to co-workers that another co-worker or superior may not be up to job, innocent people being asked to go along with the bad guy so that jack can find the location of the headquarters (which always goes wrong), the first villain only being part of a much larger plan, etc... I realize some of these are hallmarks of the show, and are what originally made the show so captivating, but really, how long can they keep being recycled?

Also, some of the characters here are used in such a perfunctory manner, the show simply feels listless. Chloe disappears for large chunks of the narrative and doesn't have much to do when she is onscreen; Aaron Pierce is mostly standing around and it's never really clear why he's even there; the great talent of Jon Voigt is essentially wasted in a hyperbolized role; if you're not gonna do more with Morris, leave him out. Moreover, the narrative itself is not well assembled. Plot threads frequently disappear inexplicably (a situation more common in later seasons of the show, most infamously in the case of Beruz from season 4--what ever happened to him??) or the show leaves them dormant for extended periods of time. The dialogue could also use some new life; how many times can Jack Bauer convincingly bark things like ""We're running out of time!"" and why must we be subjected to repeated summaries of the plot by characters who blow up at other characters in moments of frustration: ""There's a terrorist out there with a nuclear weapon, the president is about to order an invasion, one of our agents is missing, and we're tracking a criminal who may lead us to the enemy's headquarters, so go back to your station and do your job!"" Of course, there is also the obligatory death of a major character. Finally, the events of the show are, of course, absurd and over the top, but the whole mother/daughter as the president/chief of staff thing was really too much.

Anyway, many will disagree with me, and that's fine, but I think this show has clearly jumped the shark and could really use some fresh thinking in the writing department. I place some of the blame on Brannon Braga, who was responsible for running Star Trek into the ground. You can see how banal his writing is in the short-lived crapfest ""Threshold."" I'm happy for those who have enjoyed the season, but I hope season 8 breathes new life into this show.",1243123200,7,3665,4.732394366197183
3251905,3,B000Y7ZBZS,"I've noticed all of the reviews mainly focus on the season itself and not the essentials of the whether the blu-ray transfer of this season was good or not. So I've decided to add my two cents in. And remember everyone we are all entitled to our opinions so feel free to disagree. O.K. First of all I think season 7 was pretty good. I would give it 4 stars overall. It was better than the mess of season 6 and came close to the greatness of season 5. Of course nothing has come close yet to season 2 in my opinion. That was the standard that will be used to measure all action series for years to come. Anyway, yes there were some uneven moments and plot holes this season at times but when you look at the big picture after watching the entire show the writers explained it well enough to satisfy my curiosity. The acting was great as usual with plenty of new characters getting a chance to flex their muscles and of course Jack barking his way through the day as usual. I liked the dialogue between him and agent Renee Walker and how Jack finds some of his humanity in the process by the time the show draws to an end but Renee ends up somewhat losing her's. Those who have seen the finale know what I mean. And I can't say enough about Jon Voight. His acting was superb. I felt the show really hit a new gear when he took center stage as the main enemy. And yes there are a few moments where the story will make you scratch your head but in the end the writers do a good job of tying everything up and entertaining you in the process. For example, who cares why Jack is fighting someone when you get to see him kill a guy with a screwdriver through the chest and then use that same screwdriver to start-up a truck. A true classic Jack Bauer moment :) You'll even get to see Kim become a mini jack near the end. Overall a satisfying season that did more things right than it did wrong.
Now on to the transfer. This is where my 3 star review comes into play. The blu-ray version is only slightly above the standard edition in picture quality in my opinion. On several occasions I noticed grain and bland or washed out colors. The blacks and grays were decent but didn't have that pop that I know blu-ray can produce. However, on a few scenes the picture quality was noticeable better than at other times. It seemed almost that fox didn't have their high def cameras working right on some of the episodes. Overall I would give the picture quality between a 7 and 8. The audio also is not quite what I was hoping. The dts master audio mix is a definite step up from dolby digital but for a show like 24 I was surprised that my system didn't get a better workout than it did. The audio mix is extremely front channel heavy with very little going on with your surrounds. This is a real missed opportunity on the part of fox since something is always going on behind the scenes with each set on 24. I wanted to hear the conversations and computer analysts typing away in the background with fbi headquarters or the grinding of hydraulics in the background as Jack and company stake out the loading docks. I just didn't hear any of that. And I feel that my ht is a pretty good set up (cost me about $3000) so I know that the mix could have been so much better. As a contrast I just finished watching Taken on blu and that was a audio mix done right. Anyway if I had known the mix would end up being so front channel heavy and the picture quality not popping as much as I had hoped I would have just went with standard def. Of course to each his or her own.",1242950400,65,3551,4.185401459854015

3251908,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"Having watched all seasons of 24, Season 7 was the best by far.  With the introduction of Agent Renee Walker (the incredible Annie Wersching), Jack is teamed with his equal in that this is a strong woman who is able to look out for herself and think for herself, but who invariably finds herself drawn to yet at times shocked by Jack's methods when the safety of US citizens are on the line.  The progression Renee's character makes throughout the 24-hour period is profound, as is the interaction between these two.  And anyone who was annoyed by Audrey in seasons past will, I predict, love Jack and Renee together.

Mix in the fact that favorites from seasons past are brought back, and a new president is introduced (and faced with extraordinarily difficult choices in the face of both ethics and family), and this made for an entirely satisfying season.  I just watched the finale last night and am already ordering the DVD because I want to start it all over again.  Can't wait for Season 8 either!",1242777600,5,1004,4.6440677966101696
3251909,1,B000Y7ZBZS,"For the 4th time in the history of ""24"", Fox has changed the packaging that the DVDs come in. (Digipacks, thinpacks, the cardboard book [season 1 special edition] and now ultra slim sets [6 discs crammed inside a standard DVD case].

Because of this change, two things have occurred. Obviously Season 7 will not match your other sets, and there is no space for the ""bonus"" 7th disc that's been a staple of the ""24"" DVD sets since the release of season 2.

Also, ""24: Redemption"" is not included in this set. Some people held off purchasing the DVD version because they believed it would be included in the Season 7 set.

Thank you 20th Fox for reducing the packaging to nothing, removing the 7th disc and having the nerve to charge the same price for it.

BTW, brillant idea to release Season 7 meere days after it finished airing on Fox. What are you going to do come Dec/Jan when you have NO Seson 7 set to release to lead up to the Season 8 priemere.

3251910,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"Reckoning time has come for Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland).  With CTU dismantled, Jack has to answer for his actions to a Senate hearing.  But the hearing has just started with Jack is pulled out and taken to the FBI.  There he learns that former CTU agent and friend Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard) is a terrorist.  And he's working with others planning an attack for that very day.  Teaming up with FBI agent Renee Walker (Annie Wersching), he sets out to stop the unfolding events.

Meanwhile, President Taylor (Cherry Jones), the US's first female president, is trying to deal with the unfolding events and the revelation that there are people in her own administration working against her.  Can her administration survive the day?  Can Jack stop the terrorists?

I think most every one agrees that season six of this thriller was non-thrilling.  Taking advantage of the writer's strike, the show spent two years working on the just concluded seventh season.

And it shows.

While it wasn't quite the fresh approach they advertised, it was once again fun.  Yes, several plot elements were way too used and the FBI really just subbed for CTU, but the action was non-stop and most of the twists good given enough time to be explained.  And there was one set piece near the middle of the season that had my heart racing just like old times.

Probably my favorite moments in this season involved Mary Lynn Rajskub's Chloe and her FBI counter part Janis Gold, played by Janeane Garofalo.  The two characters are very similar, and watching them work together, or not as the case may be, has provided some comic relief.  The fact that I wish there were more probably means they used them just about right.

This season was set in Washington DC.  Since plot is king (as always), I'm not sure the location really mattered.  I did find the location details not quite as distracting as they were when the show was set in LA.

Considering the current real life political climate, they tried to have some thoughts about torture.  However, it was overshadowed by the race to the next plot point.

Any fan of the show owes it to themselves to give this season a chance.  It will have you counting the seconds until you can find out how it all ends before you know it.",1242691200,4,2254,4.66243654822335
3251911,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"What can I say about 24? On one hand, the show is known for its unpredictability, twists and turns, all of which were present in season 7. I miss CTU terribly, so its absence left things feeling a bit scattered. I don't want to include spoilers in here, but season 7 definitely was in keeping with its history of not being afraid to kill off main characters. Some episodes were shocking, some were mundane. Chloe's character could have been used MUCH more prominently and provided the viewers with her typical comic relief more. I was hoping for some lingering questions to be addressed: what happened to Audrey? Is Wayne Palmer still alive? How about President Logan? Or Martha, for that matter. We see Aaron (thank God), but it seemed that we should have gotten a clue about Martha Logan's whereabouts. I also expected some due respect over the death of Bill. Wouldn't it have been great to see Karen Hughes show up, guns blazing? Okay, most of the things I listed wouldn't fly, but as good as it was in parts, this season seemed disconnected and a bit disjointed. Unfortunately, the finale, while revealing some things, left me frustrated. There was next to no resolution. Will I buy it? Probably, since I have all of the other seasons. I am hoping, however, that there are some things that get wrapped up next season, set in NYC. Taping begins May 27th, but I was disappointed to discover that Jon Cassar and Joel Surnow are done with the show. Surnow's departure is likely the reason that season 7 took on a PC slant (he's a diehard conservative, and lent balance and bravado to the show, IMHO.).

Season 6 was an example of going to the well once too often.  The makers of 24 had to change the location, and Washington DC was a great backdrop.  There are certain elements the show must have: cliffhangers at the end of each episode, plot twists, betrayals, a new type of weapon of mass destruction and the unexpected.  This is what makes 24, 24, and this season the show came up big.  I am so glad they decided to released the DVD a day after the finale airs.  In my opinion, this is the best time to release the DVD, right when the fervor is at its highest.

This was a great season and a return to form.",1242691200,3,779,4.216216216216216
3251913,3,B000Y7ZBZS,"My wife and I are big 24 fans and have long defended it as the best thing on TV.  Even a weak season of 24 is much better than most other shows these days.  Furthermore, we own all the Seasons on DVD.

This will remain a classic TV series and deserves much praise for it's creativity.

Having said that, all things have a lifespan and eventually come to an end.

It seems that any series after 6-7 seasons begins to decline -- It can't be helped --- After 130+ episodes of ANY SHOW, what more is there to do or say ?

It is kind of like life.... As we age there are fewer and fewer exciting ""firsts"" that we expererience and everday life becomes simple repetition of the same events with only minor variations.

Season 5 was probably the last strong season.
Season 6 was of course an ""off-season"" as most fans and viewers agree.
The writer's strike seemed to kill the momentum for many shows.

24 tried to bridge the gap with the African-based mini-movie filler, but that mostly fell flat for most viewers.

SPOILER BELOW ....
Season 7 seemed to start very good, but pretty much after the White House seige, this season seemed to just limp along with no real directon, consistency or pacing.

By the time we got to the last 10 episodes, one was just hoping for the series to end and be done with it already.

The 2 hour Season Finale may in fact be the worst and weakest single 24 episode ever as it was totally out of character, stiff, and apparently FOX felt some need to start shoving more and more political correctness into the show this season that went beyond neccessity.

Will we watch next season ......... hmmm, Yes.
BUT........ if Season 8 continues going in the direction that Season 7 ended, we may very well drop off and stop watching.

This is not a nasty critique of 24 at all ........ as I said at the beginning, we have loved the show ---------  but there comes a time for EVERYTHING (Cheers, Seinfeld, Wings, etc..etc..etc..)

24 was a GREAT, GREAT show .......it's just that it feels as though it's time has come to end.

UPDATE -
Over the Memorial Day weekend we received Season 7 DVD in the mail and decided to watch it straight thru for a re-evaluation.

I feel the need to update my earlier review.

OVERALL, Season 7 was better than I remembered.  I think my earlier tough rating was skewed by the most recently aired (final 5-6 episodes).
I still feel the Season ""fell apart"" at the end and seemed to wander aimlessly and lose it's way at the very end.

Watching Season 7 again non-stop two (2) things become apparent...

(1) It seems that perhaps 10-12 episodes were filmed BEFORE the strike in Hollywood.  I say this because the feel and vibe of the writing changes erratically around the 11th episode as though the writers and cast had been on a long break and had a hard time getting back in the vibe.

(2) Depite item #1, the Season was really pretty good overall.... but something just derailed during the last 5-6 episodes and as mentioned before, I still feel the final episode was like a car with a blown engine just rolling to a stop.

The feeling during the last 5-6 episodes is almost as though the writers ran out of story but realized they had another 6-7 hours to fill so they started ""running out the clock"" to fill the time void.

All things considered, I feel my rating should be UPGRADED to a Four (4).",1242691200,6,3347,4.420880913539968
3251914,3,B000Y7ZBZS,"While this season had some very good, heart stopping moments (Jon Voight is A+), there were just as many ""oh come on!"" moments. ****SPOILER TALK -- DON'T READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW**** Like how do you go from estranged daughter to Chief of Staff in 20 minutes? Oh come on. Swimming underneath DC to break into the White House? Oh come on. Definitely not one of the better seasons, but certainly better than the last two. Strong writing, but could have developed Jack's psychological battle with his inner demons better. It was so close, but fell short. Could have been great; pretty so-so.

Thru all the conspiracies, Moles, and the intense pressure for Jack Bauer(Kiefer Sutherland)to get to the truth, by any means necessary. It make you think of John McClane(Bruce Willis) of Die Hard or The Last Boy Scout, as he gets beaten and tortured and that just makes him angry. ""Hit me again and I'll kill you"" When its just one of those bad days and this man, who doesn't wear a cape or has super powers, uses his skills and experience to stop the bad guys, and save peoples lives. You experience the chronicles of Jack Bauer moments thru a 24 hour day. Each day is a season. Day 7 just ended, with fans thirsting for another day. If you have not seen this show pick up season 1-7 on DVD. Seeing it in Blu-ray made it even better.

3251917,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"Like most fans, I was disappointed in Season 6, but willing to give 24 another try based on its past greatness. Season 7 surpassed my expectations.

While 24 is an action show, its best moments for me are the pivotal ones in the lives of the characters we care about so much, especially Jack. (Like, in Season 2 Jack talking with Kim while flying the plane, then Mason showing up and talking to Jack about what Jack should really be doing with his life; or, in Season 3, Jack and Nina's final confrontation; or in Season 5, our last visit with David Palmer.) There are several such memorable moments in Season 7.

This season benefits from a great cast, including some returning favorite characters (Tony, Chloe, Agent Pierce, and a couple others) and some great new ones (FBI Agent Renee Walker, super talented & resourceful and a possible love interest for Jack in Season 8 - if he lives that long), and uber bad guy Jonas Hodges, played to a tee by Jon Voight.

Season 7 borrows the more successful plot elements from previous seasons, and does them well in a new context. Jack, once again, is working on the outside, with the help of Chloe on the inside. Jack, once again, must infiltrate a group of bad guys by pretending to be one of them, and must pretend to kill someone he - and we - care about to convince them of his loyalties. There's a well-placed mole, feeding intel to the bad guys and keeping them a step ahead of our hero. There's a Sherrie Palmer-like character in the President's daughter, and, finally, once again, a President with principles - like David Palmer.

I am hoping the writers try some different plot elements next year instead of rehashing the same formula. Stop making Jack prove he's a good guy - sheesh, he's saved the world 6 or 7 times over, you'd think people would have learned by now. Give him some real resources and the unconditional faith of the leaders he serves.

But, after the disappointing Season 6, the writers did a fantastic job, and Season 7 brings the comforting feeling of the old 24 magic. Most fans, I think, will easily forgive the writers for reusing some past plot points. And while not all seasons of 24 portray their villains as 3-dimensional characters with plausible motivations, Season 7 gives us a nicely fleshed out villain in Jonas Hodges, and another guy who's pretty bad reveals his true motivations to Jack in Episode 24, and it's pretty plausible and satisfying.

In the end, despite the terrorist threats to the nation, and all the great action and stunts and car crashes, Season 7 is more intimate - it's about Jack facing his demons and about other characters we've long known dealing with theirs. And as a bonus (I hope this isn't too much of a spoiler), Kim's reappearance sets things right with fans - she doesn't wind up in any cougar traps - far from it - and she makes a positive contribution when it counts most. In my view, everything wraps up perfectly in Episode 24. The writers don't explicitly show the actual resolution to certain things, like what Renee is about to do when we last see her, or what will happen after the very final scene. But they show enough to make it clear how things turn out. And it is very satisfying.

If you have not seen 24 Season 7 yet, I envy you for the treat you're in store for.",1242691200,18,3298,4.523489932885906
3251918,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"I was very good and interested in the new season of 24 until the writers strike of last year which they only produced 8 of the 24 episodes. But since they were able to finish, I was very excited to see the writers tied in the Redemption story with the Season 6-7 storyline, but I was very disappointed that the CTU was dismantled, it was moved to Washington where Jack joined the FBI. However, the only thing that kept 24 interested is seeing Kim coming back from seasons 1-3 and season 5. But the consistency is all messed up this season. Jack Bauer is great as saving evil from hitting the US, the writers have unfortunately repeat the killing random people over and over from about season 6 onward. But towards the end, the story comes out straight and IMO, it's a decent way to close out a season filled with too many inconsistencies.",1242604800,,838,4.4480519480519485

And I will watch it again as soon as I do because that's just how great this show really is. I cant understand why people who are supposed to be such big fans of the show are actually angry they are releasing the dvd early. Wouldn't that be what you want?

But anyway...on to the show....

24 Season 7 will go down as one of the premiere seasons in the shows history. Maybe, from start to finish, the best since Season 1.  After a lackluster Season 6, I think it was safe to say that the writers and producers of the show had a clear opportunity to start over and start fresh. And they did. What we got was a smart, tight, and extraordinarily acted season with the same raging action and plot twists but still with a different feel to it. By relocating out of L.A and into D.C. we got the chance to see Jack Bauer out of his element for the first time. At first I was skeptical of this, as many were. But after the first episode of the season I realized that my skepticism was for nothing. The move to D.C. was perfect and it brought so much to this season. And as we progressed from twist to twist, from villain to villain, the one thing that stayed apparent was that this season was absolutely brilliant. Nothing will ever compare to the originality of Season 1. And the show's creators know that. But they weren't trying to replicate that. Instead they were trying to bring us a season that we will remember, instead of tossing away like we did with season 6. Season 7 was a triumph and it's just another example of why we keep watching.",1242604800,64,1659,4.243670886075949

I understand that people who want to buy it that don't watch the show on television but for people that do watch it, they won't want to buy this the day it comes out.  There is a reason that most season dvds come out in fall, because it has been 4 months or so since you last saw an episode.  I've always bought my 24 dvds the month they came out because it has been so long since I watched the show but not this time.

After the success of the award winning season 5 to the disaster that was season 6, many critics and fans wondered if 24 had any life left in it.  Well when the writer's strike hit, it gave this show the extra time it needed to make Season 7 the best yet.  Currently as of this review I can say from what has aired on television that from Episode 1 to Episode 20 it has lived up to the hype.

Even though I am currently watching this television show on the air, I still plan on having a 24 season 7 marathon with my friends by re-watching Season 7 from Hour 1 down to Hour 24 when this blu-ray is released.  Not to mention the extras, commentary, and behind the scenes footage that is included in this Blu-Ray release is just icing on the cake.

If you are looking for action, good story telling, drama, thrills, twists and turns then this is for you.  Even if you are a first time 24 viewer, this season can still be enjoyed without having to watch the other seasons.

After season 6, which I felt was the weakest since season 1 and which got a bit flaccid towards the last third, season 7 has been constantly entertaining and suspenseful. I suspect this has something to do with the fact that the great Brannon Braga (of Star Trek: Enterprise fame) is now one of the main writers. Highly recommended for fans of the show, and even if you haven't watched the previous 6 seasons, this will definitely turn you into a fan.

3251934,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"24: Redemption was aptly named, because of it's ties to the reality of the series. Redemption was in fact a redemption for the series.
Despite season 6 having been a horrible season, it still was one of the best shows on. Btw, for the record, and hopefully the producers, writers and studios will see this, but every time 24 has a ""To be continued"" cliff-hanger, the following season sux (for 24). Season 6 was another of those not up to 24 par seasons. I'm guessing the reason is, 24 uses these cliff-hangers and then when the new season begins, they say, ""4 months later"" completely ignoring the entire cliff-hanger! They did that in season 2 or 3 and again in season 5. Note to the wise, and those that matter: DONT DO THIS ANYMORE!
Taking the year off, rather than trying to force an 8 hour season last year was probably the wisest thing. Rumor has it that 24 had the first 8 episodes ready to go, but, they looked back on it, and decided to rewrite.
What has occurred is a reminiscent, if not fresh look at things. Returning this season, so far, is Bill and Chloe, and a confused Tony Almeda. Confused as we don't don't what side he is on, after his ""death"" and the death of his wife, Michelle. Nor do we know if he is finished for the season, or if he turns up again later.
The typical agency mole is the show's huge dependancy factor, as is the ""Jack's bad... No Jack's good...ok, everyone, Jack's the greatest Superhero ever"" roller-coaster. One thing that is not as predictable, is 24 has seemingly dropped the mini 4 episodic plots, and has gone much longer with the plots, which seem to help develop the story better.
Even in a bad season, like 6, the show will be intense. But, it certainly helps to have a strong plot line and not just filler stuff, just to make it to 24 episodes, and season 7 so far, has managed to get back to it's game, and with some tenacity.",1235433600,3,1877,4.365714285714286

Its good for Amazon because they get better knowledge on just how many copies they will need when its released and its good for the customer because they offer significant discounts for pre-ordering. Since your not charged until it ships and since you can cancel at any time before it ships, well lets just say that anyone speaking out negatively about such business practices has no clue what they are talking about.

If Amazon charged your credit card before it shipped than this would be a completely different story but that simply is not the case. They are not getting any money until they ship the product. Lets face it some people just have to complain. Its literally a part of thier personality and trust me I have known a couple people like this in my life. They don't bother to educate themselves about something before lashing out, they just immediatly form a biased opinion and the bashing begins. Its really the very essence of ignorance.

3251943,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"...and I have pre-ordered every season of ""24"" and the recent ""24: Redemption"" movie from Amazon.com well in advance to the season or movie premiering on TV.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT A SHAM but an excellent business decision on Amazon.com's part for fans will go to extremes to indulge their love for a show and/or movie.  Case in point, I pre-ordered ""24: Redemption's"" 2-Disc Set from Amazon.com in August 2008 at the price of $19.99 - the movie didn't premier on TV till November 2008 - and prior to movie's TV premier, I was notified via e-mail and was eventually charged Amazon's adjusted price of $18.99; however, Best Buy was (and still is) selling the exact same 2-disc movie set for the price of $29.99!

That said, if you are true fan of a show (or movie) pre-ordering from Amazon.com WILL INDEED GET YOU THE PRODUCT'S LOWEST PRICE and you are NOT CHARGED for the purchase until the product becomes available to ship which is the day BEFORE it hits the stores (when the product will be sold for a higher price!!!).  Thus, pre-ordering from Amazon.com is the ULTIMATE win-win situation and I for one, have already pre-ordered ""24"" - Season 7 and I highly suggest if you share my admiration of ""24"" that you do the same.",1229731200,26,1233,4.590909090909091
3251944,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"He is absolutely right.  I have pre-ordered may titles (books and DVDs) from Amazon and not a single one of them has been charged UNTIL THE ITEM SHIPPED.  So look at it this way, season 7 premieres in January, ends in about October, new DVDs hit the shelves for Christmas 09....what are you bitching about?",1229126400,5,306,4.545454545454546
3251945,4,B000Y7ZBZS,"This is not a waste of 39 dollars as others have claimed. Amazon does not charge you for an item until it actually ships, so you are NOT paying for this months in advance just to make FOX some extra cash this year. However by pre-ordering this far in advance you improve your chances of getting the best price you can. The Amazone pre-order garuntee insures that you will get their lowest price between when you place the order and the day it is released. If you are even considering buying this you should pre-order it now, you won't have to pay for it until it is released and you get the best price you can from Amazon.",1229126400,33,622,4.279661016949152

Watch 24: Redemption BEFORE starting this season. A lot of things won't make sense if you don't.",1523923200,,214,4.657894736842105

8231211,5,B000Y7ZBZS,"Wow, this season starts off jarring with a brand new cast with no CTU, and yet another Jack replacement- Ms. Walker, and President Taylor and the African civil war is kinda boring.
But, HOLY COW, with Day 10 with the 1st villain is taken care of, things really kicked into high gear. There are tons of surprises, dramatic scenes, tension, death, huge threats, etc. Really a great season and they actually referenced older characters from long ago.",1504742400,,447,4.818181818181818
