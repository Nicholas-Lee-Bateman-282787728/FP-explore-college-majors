4312310,5,B004AW3DUI,This is truly like the Wiggles but with fairy dust.  We first rented the movie through Red Box and my 6 year old had asked for it every time we went by a Red Box in a store.  I figured I'd buy it for her and now my 2 year old can sing and dance along with the entire show.  It's so fun to watch her and it's amazing how the songs stick in your head and you don't even mind.  I wish I could post the video we took of the two of them acting out Hello Everybody from memory...it's priceless.  I can't wait to get the Christmas DVD when it's released.,1316649600,,547,3.8053097345132745
4312311,5,B004AW3DUI,We rented this movie from the RedBox thinking it would just be something to keep my 3yr old daughter entertained since they didn't have the actual movie we went to rent. We ended up keeping it for 3 days & even then she begged that we didn't take it back. Since then she has asked at least 4 times a day when could we go back to rent it again. So of course I had no choice but to find it on the internet to BUY! No complaints though; she absolutely loves this movie & we can wait for the new Christmas edition to come out so we can buy that one too. FANTASTIC! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!,1316131200,,579,4.0
4312312,5,B004AW3DUI,"My four-year-old picked this out at redbox and watched it four times (we kept it an extra day). I found it very cute and not at all annoying, so decided it was worth it to buy a copy. The songs and dancing are fun and the Australian accents are fun. I hope they come out with more DVDs in the States...we would likely purchase more, especially at this price!",1315008000,,358,4.202898550724638
4312313,5,B004AW3DUI,I rented this at Red Box for my 4 1/2 year old. She loved it so much that she has been asking for it every day for the last 2 weeks. I finally gave in and looked it up to order. She is so excited that we found it to buy. My one year old son dances alont to it as well. It's so bright and musical. Lots of fun for the kids but can get annoying as they want to play it over and over and over again.,1314921600,,396,3.460674157303371
4312314,5,B004AW3DUI,"The Meet the Fairies DVD was available at Red Box and we ended up renting it several times because my daughters would keep requesting it if it was available.  I finally broke down and bought it after renting it a handful of times.  My daughters are 4 and 5 and they love the signing, dancing, and costumes.  They even pick out which fairy they are and pretend that they are them.  Hope to see more of Meet the Fairies.",1314748800,,418,4.253164556962025
4312315,5,B004AW3DUI,"Singing, dancing, and lots of fun for your tots and you. Will get your kids sing and dancing. Like one other reviewer said it is like the wiggles a fairy version. Would recommend this dvd. From 2-8 years old. Just hope they get other dvds out in the states. They have over 15 dvds out in Australia.",1304985600,3,298,4.245614035087719
4312316,5,B004AW3DUI,"We were lucky enough to recieve an advanced copy of this DVD to share at my daughter's fairy party.  It came in the mail about a week before her birthday and of course we previewed it right away.  My now 3 year old daughter loved it.  She has asked to watch it everyday, several times a day!  She will get up and dance with The Fairies during the songs and has so much fun!  I have really enjoyed it too, I think the songs and dances  are very cute.
  I have three older boys and liked that this show was a little more girly.  But my four and a half year old son loves it too!  He watches with his sister every time and really likes the wizard character.  I often hear him singing the songs during the day when the DVD is not playing.  My 6 year old and 8 year old sons have watched the show through as well and seemed to enjoy it although understandably not as much given their ages and gender.  But my 6 year old sometimes comes and watches with his younger siblings when its on.  Like the previous reviewer, it reminds me of the Wiggles, which my boys all loved when they were in their preschool years.  Seeing how both my youngest two (still in their preschool years) like to watch the show, I think it is great for this age set regardless of gender.
  As I said, we got this to watch and dance along with at my daughter's birthday party.  We put it on as the girls came in for them to dance along with, it was a big hit!  All the girls loved it and the dances were easy enough for them to follow along with.
  This show met our expectations and more!  The customer service from NCircle Entertainment was amazing as well.  Thank you so much!  We are very pleased with everything, we love it!",1300838400,,1695,4.128834355828221
4312317,5,B004AW3DUI,"My 6 year old daughter is all about Pink and Fairies. She can't get enough of this fun DVD. She loves to sing and dance along to this DVD, and pretend that she is one of the Fairies. It's a great way for kids to use their imagination while watching this DVD. We received this DVD for a review, and she loves it!",1299196800,,311,3.9523809523809526
4312318,4,B004AW3DUI,"This DVD is not like any other DVD we have watched before.  Actually since the show is an Australian show, it reminds me of the Wiggles, but about Fairies!  The DVD is not an animated DVD but rather actual people playing characters, including a few kids which are adorable!  There are two female fairies, an Elf baker, and a Bumble Bee guy as the main characters.  The show features Fairyland and what goes on and how the characters work together, play with their friends, and there is lots and lots of singing.

When I first showed my boys it, my 4 year old son said ""No"" and so I put it on my laptop for my 2 year old son to watch.  Soon both boys were glued to the laptop screen and begging to finish it!  Their favorite character was the Elf baker, not sure why.  Normally they don't like a lot of singing and with the DVD being kind of girly, I didn't think they'd like it, but they did!  Since it has guy characters in it, I don't think it is just for girls, although girls would probably love it more because of the whole Fairy thing.  It is a very cute show and with it being a hit in Australia I think it will definitely be a hit here!",1298419200,3,1144,4.112612612612613
4312319,5,B004AW3DUI,"We received an advanced copy of this DVD to review and it was a HIT!  My daughter is almost 6, and I have 2 boys, aged 1 and 4.  Once my daughter saw what was in the mailer, she demanded we watch the show.  The cover itself is just beautiful!  We popped the DVD in and she was immediately excited about what she was seeing.  It is a show with real actors and actresses singing songs and dancing.  It is filled with magical fun and special surprises that keep kids engaged and interested.  I love that it fosters my child's imagination and encourages them to ""stay little"" by living in a land of dreams and wonders for the brief time that they are watching the show. :)

Even though my oldest son said he liked it ""just one thumb up"", he could recite his favorite parts with no problem. haha  My daughter loved a part about a baby fairy.  She loves babies so that was right up her alley.  I would definitely recommend this to any one with a daughter up to about age 6 or so.  I will be playing this again when my daughter has some friends over and will probably let them dress up to be in on the fantasy land as well!  This will be in regular rotation at my house!  The songs are fun and the dances are cute....my daughter also loved that that fairies had Australian accents!

Overall, I'm very glad we had a chance to watch this and I know it won't be the last time!  My daughter gave it a very enthusiastic 2 thumbs up.  If your daughter loves fairies and has an imagination (or you want to help foster one!), don't hesitate to pick this DVD up!  You will be so glad you did.  At this price, it is a steal!",1297987200,5,1607,4.125806451612903

4312329,3,B004AW3DUI,"I read many reviews.  They were all correct.  Lots of singing.  Lots of giggling.  Lots of dancing.  WAY more than any adult can handle.  Please, please please use this DVD when you need to do something else and you need your child to stay in one place for a while!  After watching it for the first time with our three year old my husband said, ""I just lost an hour of my life."" She loved it though.  It is a bit long (1 hour) and is not in episode form like Dora or Cat in the Hat.",1393718400,,482,3.8969072164948453
4312330,5,B004AW3DUI,My daughter loves this cheesy movie.  Netfix removed it for some reason and Amazon Video was there to save the day.,1391299200,,115,4.476190476190476
4312331,4,B004AW3DUI,"My daughter loves it. They had this cartoon on Netflix then all of a sudden took it off and my daughter was so upset so I had to order it for her from here. We got it within 2 days with free shipping, so that's great also. I recommend this seller!",1390867200,,247,3.8627450980392157
4312332,5,B004AW3DUI,Netflix just took this off today!  :0 ( My 15 month old daughter is smitten with this movie.  Thank goodness I found it on Amazon tonight.  As soon as the DVD gets here we will be back to dancing along with those funny characters.  Also found out there's more than one movie they made.  I'm sure I'll be buying all of them.,1390176000,,323,4.145161290322581
4312333,3,B004AW3DUI,"This is a great movie to put on and then leave the room, because it's insufferably annoying and the dressed-up adults are really scary. But kids like it because the costumes are nice and my daughter just likes to watch fairies dance and sing, which is pretty much all this movie is. So, it's great for kids, but I really would not recommend taking this in the car or anywhere where you might have to listen to it over and over.",1386720000,2,427,4.283950617283951
4312334,4,B004AW3DUI,"These Aussie fairies really entertain my 3 and 8 y.o.s!  The costumes, story line, scenery, and cast are likable and we even purchased the Christmas DVD.  It's upbeat enough for daytime but also calm enough that kiddos can watch while in bad at night!",1381363200,,251,4.681818181818182
4312335,5,B004AW3DUI,"The beginning!  I have a 3 year old and an almost 6 year old, and both of them love this video.  We have watched it several times and I haven't started getting bored yet!  It's a bit campy, but if you have a child that loves to dance, this is just the best thing ever!  Makes me wish I lived in Australia!  My 3 year old will watch this when she gets up in the morning, with her special dancing dress on, and dance to every one of the songs.  The tunes are catchy, the dances are actually choreographed and fun to watch; all around a great kids video.",1377216000,,551,4.009174311926605
4312336,5,B004AW3DUI,"this video is entertaining, wholesome and my daughter loves the Fairies. the production is good and the tunes are actually pretty listenable with catchy melodies etc.",1372982400,,166,5.423076923076923
4312337,5,B004AW3DUI,"We discovered the Fairies on Netflix, and I had to buy a copy for the car for my obsessed 4 year old. This video is great enjoyment for young girls who love to dance and sing, for the choreography is easy to learn and songs are catchy.",1370390400,,235,4.0212765957446805
4312338,5,B004AW3DUI,It arrived in mint condition and is a beloved DVD in our home.  We were first introduced to this on Netflix and our two toddler fairies love all the characters and their Australian accents.,1369699200,,189,4.5588235294117645
4312339,5,B004AW3DUI,This series is wonderful. So much nicer than cartoons. Cute songs that kids can learn. Nice story lines/skits. I would much rather my kids watch this than any of the animated fairy shows!,1365465600,,187,4.696969696969697
4312340,5,B004AW3DUI,This movie is great! My daughters age 1 and age 7 both love it. They dance and sing the songs all the time!!,1365379200,,108,3.739130434782609

4312342,5,B004AW3DUI,I bought this for my granddaughter last year. She is still watching it this year. Can't really go wrong with Fairy movies. There really aren't enough good ones out there and my 5 year old loves Fairy movies.,1360454400,,207,4.473684210526316

4312346,4,B004AW3DUI,"So from my adult judgement standpoint...cheesy, bad effects. But I'm letting this go because my daughter ADORES it. It's sweet, whimsical, and has an innocence missing from even most children's programing.

My 5yo loves the songs,the dancing, the costumes and honestly it's like an addiction but to something wholesome, so I can't complain too much! Money well spent but be warned that you may not enjoy it they way your little ones will. I do have to say that sometime I find myself singing the songs without even meaning too.",1354579200,10,527,4.855555555555555

4312348,5,B004AW3DUI,We purchased this a couple of months ago and the dvd is already get worn from so much use.  My daughter LOVES this dvd.  She puts on her princess dress and dances along.  The music is lively and fun.  The fairies are beautiful and engaging. The set is colorful and dreamy. My daughter loves to talk about Harmony & Rhapsody (the fairies). I don't know why anyone would give this a negative review...unless you were a 7 year old boy...which my son is and he cringes when we pop this in.,1352246400,,485,4.2967032967032965
4312349,5,B004AW3DUI,"I first found ""The Meet Fairies"" show on Netflicks and my 3 and 4 year old girls loved them.  Lots of singing and dancing and ""fairy dresses"" of course.

4312350,5,B004AW3DUI,"My kids have seen all kids shows, from recent Disney movies to the Disney channel etc. This live action ""stage"" type show is very entertaining and yes, the production is ""cheap"" looking compared to Disney standards, but kids don't care. The tunes are clean and catchy cute. I like the accents too. Overall, this is something good clean and different that kids will like. Mine are 7 and 5 (and 18 months) and THEY ALL watch and like the show. We rented it at first, but had to buy the DVD for use in our family vehicle DVD player on trips etc. Well worth the little money it cost.",1347926400,,579,4.321100917431193
4312351,4,B004AW3DUI,"My 5 year old daughter loves this movie, and asks to watch it frequently.  I, on the other hand, find myself slipping into a diabetic coma from all the syrupy sweetness.

4312353,5,B004AW3DUI,"We actually for this from Walmart for $4.88, and are SOOOOOO pleased with it! My daughter is only 15 months old but she tries to dance and sing along with the many very perky songs in the video! In fact... I have found that when she is throwing a tantrum, all I have to do is just START singing a song from this movie to her and she immediately calms down. There is nothing bad about this series. The script is clean and free of any trashy behavior, and the backdrops are very bright and fun!",1338854400,,492,4.135416666666667

I like the movie as much as she does and we both get up to dance and sing together! She memorized three songs already. I dance the Bee dance in public and she laughs and joins me. Good for ages 2 on up. We have watched it almost every day for six months and I am still excited to watch it with her. This would be perfect for a little kid skit to video tape your little one and send to the relatives for entertainment,just put the movie on low in the background. I just have to buy a cute fairy dress first!",1338336000,,623,4.032258064516129
4312355,1,B004AW3DUI,"I thought when I saw ""Meet The Fairies"" on Netflix that it would be a great show for my children to watch.  Unfortunately, the music was just terrible, which made it necessary for me to ban it from being played in the house forevermore.  I enjoy children's music and listen to it often with my children, but when they played this movie, I had to have them turn the volume down very low so I could tolerate it being played.  It was just not good music.  There are several different songs, but they all sounds quite a bit alike, and the music is almost constant in the show.  I have no problem with constant music- I'm a musician myself- but when the music is terrible, I can not listen to it.  The content and acting is just fine for children and my daughters thought that it was absolutely wonderful, but I couldn't get over the music in this particular show.",1336003200,2,859,4.3375
4312356,5,B004AW3DUI,"My 4 year old daughter and I just happened to find this title on AmebaTV.  We fell in love instantly.  It's a little annoying for an adult to watch over and over but my daughter, a true lover of all things princess and fairies, would watch it (just this one title) repeatedly from wake-up to bedtime if I allowed.  Harmony (pink fairy) and Rhapsody (purple fairy) are the stars but there are other characters, too: Buzzy the Bee, Whizzy the Wizard, an elf, and some children (I can't remember everyone's names, if my daughter was here right this minute she'd be able to rattle them off as easily as she does her own name).  Apparently ""The Fairies"" are regularly on TV (don't know the channel) in Australia.  There are also, from what I've gathered from their website, franchised dance studios (Australia only) which offer classes and spectacular birthday parties.  The videos, the dancing, The Fairies altogether:  It is the epitome of little girl childhood fantasy play. The whole concept is so different from what we see here in the U.S.  I so wish we had more of this kind of stuff on TV (I'm so sick of the ""animated"" shows and sass-mouthed 'tween' shows on the kid channels around here.)

There are other titles and I am so hoping that they will be available soon.  ""Prime instant videos"" would be fantastic but I'd be willing to pay to buy (not a big fan of renting) the videos as well.",1332892800,,1393,4.5582329317269075

I thought, honestly that it would just appease her and that she wouldn't really watch it, as she doesn't watch many movies.  I am embarrassed to admit that I was busy and let her watch it without previewing first.  When I finally saw a bit I understood why she loves it.  There are beautiful costumes and singing and dancing. She loves to sing and dance along.
