811628,5,6304216939,"Although the book was far more detailed(books have that luxury), the adaptation from book to movie script was right on the money. Set in the 1930's, Flora Poste is a twenty-something girl whose parents die within weeks of each other due to the Influenza. This isn't traumatic for Flora, since her parents were fond of travelling and only saw her a few months out of the year. Since Flora has never been educated to make a living for herself, she decides to write her relations and ask to live with them. The relatives she chooses are unbelievably eccentric and rustic; they have a dingy farmhouse in Sussex. Each relation has some wild oddity about them and are extremely behind the times. But Flora chooses them because she feels she can satisfy her need to organize things, and also feels they'll provide the perfect colorful characters she'll need when she finally writes her first novel. Flora changes everyones lives for the better, and you will laugh heartily throughout. ""I saw something nasty in the woodshed!"" will be a phrase you hear in your head for weeks after watching this film. Stars Kate Beckinsale as Flora, Joanna Lumley (""Absolutely Fabulous""'s Patsy Stone) as Mary, Oscar nominated Sir Ian McKellan as Flora's over-zealous preacher cousin, and Rufus Sewell (most recently in ""Bless the Child"") as Flora's over-sexed 2nd cousin Seth who dreams of Hollywood stardom. One to have in your personal movie collection. Read the book as well.",970790400,14,1455,4.942857142857143
811629,4,6304216939,"After back-to-back viewings of the two versions, I was left with some distinct impressions of each. Clearly the 1996 Schlesinger version had the advantage of a much bigger budget, and was photographed with eventual large  screen presentation in mind. The wedding scene alone had to have cost as  much as did the entire original production. The original also left the  automobiles to the imagination, and the buggy ride to town was so clearly a  rear-projection shot that they shouldn't even have bothered. (Indeed, in  the 1996 version, they didn't bother, choosing to walk, instead.) I could  have done without the early special effects, the alpha and omega of which  boiled down to ""look, the BBC gave us a zoom lens!""
On a more  elemental level, the 1996 version struck me as being considerably sanitized  for a different generation of viewers. The sets and, especially, the  people, seemed to be so much more neat and clean. This, in turn, made  Flora's self-imposed mandate -- to ""tidy up"" -- less urgent.
In Schlesinger's reading, the Starkadder clan's violent, primal  tendencies were glossed over, as was the overt sexuality: we can't have  Rennet going into an insane heat in the mid-nineties, can we? And Brian  Blessed's Reuben imparted a sense of danger that Ivan Kaye's good-natured  oaf didn't even hint at. Indeed, all of the characters seemed to be painted  with less vivid colors, their eccentricities (even grotesqueries) toned  down for a more sensitive audience.
I don't know whether it was by  intent, but Sara Badell's Flora was a much more rounded and interesting  character than the smug, one-dimensional powerhouse portrayed by Kate  Beckinsale. Badell's Flora had real doubts and fears.
It could be a  question of timing. When the original production was filmed, the generation  that grew up with the sort of book Cold Comfort Farm (the novel) parodied  still made up a good chunk of the populace. Those viewers could be counted  upon to know that the Starkadder family wasn't intended to be  ""real"" but rather a caricature. By 1996, someone must have said  ""this could be taken at face value, so we'd better tone it down.""
Still, the Schlesinger version told the story very effectively, and I'm  glad to have it on tape. But the original is chock full of atmosphere, and  on balance I'd say it was worth the long wait.",957312000,5,2345,4.913265306122449
811630,5,6304216939,"Growing up with an Irish Matriarch transplanted to Kentucky, (her name was Flora too!) I was reviewing my younger days.  I finally know where Hillbillys originated.  The only thing the movie lacked was an uncle Billy  Bob buring down the farm making moonshine.
The actors were wonderful in  their depiction of poor folk trying to understand the visiting  ""rich"" cousin with her proper and prim ways.  Change is good when  it includes cleaning the sheets and birth control (after the fourth child  to an unwed mother).
One must own this movie to review the one-liners  over and over.  Everytime I watch it I find something new and whimsical.  The accents are also sometimes hard for us Americans to understand until we  hear it a few times.",950054400,5,739,4.777777777777778

811632,5,6304216939,"I highly recommend this movie to everyone. I have lent it to everone I know, everyone who has seen it agrees it is the best. Each character is incredible. I have never seen a movie where each character was so strong. I  absolutely fell in love with each character. Rated the best movie I have  ever seen.

811633,5,6304216939,"Cold Comfort Farm is a wonderful mixture of offbeat characters and strange situations that make for some of the grandest comedy on screen in some time.  If you think you won't like it because it's an English period comedy  abandon that notion and dive in.  This movie is one you will enjoy. The  actors are perfect for bringing this off and it is a pleasure just to watch  them tangle with this material.  Ian McKellen and Rufus Sewell are  particularly quirky as is Maria Miles as Elphine, but Sheila Burrel as Aunt  Ada gets the best line: ""I saw something nasty in the woodshed!""  But the key character is Flora, played to perfection by the delectable Kate  Beckinsale.  It is Flora's good sense and practicality that master the  situation and win the day.  She sets the world right with her refusal to  allow it to be otherwise.  This mix of wacky characters needs the grounding  of Flora to allow us a point of view and Kate Beckinsale establishes that  perfectly.  Ms. Beckinsale has done the kind of exceptional work here that  we've come to expect from her. Get this video and get ready to laugh long  and hard.",923184000,10,1119,4.555555555555555

Kudos also for Joanna Lumley in her strong supporting role as Flora's London sophisticate of a mentor (the widow Mary Smiling), and especially for Ian McKellen's virtuoso performance, who virtually burns down the barn with his charismatic preacher-cum farm manager character, Amos Starkadder.

Lawrence will probably miss the point of some of the comedy, but it is still a fun fairy tale of everyone getting their happily ever after ending through the help of Flora, who goes to Cold Comfort and becomes a ray of sunshine with her practical common sense. There's nothing flowery about Flora as she takes each family member in hand to make them aware of their gifts, and inspire them to do something meaningful with them. Rufus Sewell and Ian McKellan are great in their respective roles, as is a very young Kate Beckinsale as Flora, long before the gory Underworld franchise transformed her into an action hero.

812508,5,6304216939,"Do yourself a favor and watch this- a FEW times!
This is a quirky movie. I started reading the book and could not understand the lingo! so I decided to rent this first. When I went back to read I had the conversations down and understood the premise.
 I have to say first and foremost that this movie is from a book by the same name. Stella Gibbons was the Author and she wrote this in 1932. Her humor is BEYOND funny, if possible- dry and off beat. The intro to the book is hysterical and gives you a hint of the woman behind the story.
The movie is almost word for word according to the book...
 Flora, about 23 years of age is from London. Without a job and only 100 pounds a year to live on, she decides to 'visit' and 'live off of' some relatives for a short while. Her criteria for picking these relatives require that they be in desperate need of change in their lives. Flora was good at helping people with change and felt she was doing a good deed by accomplishing this task, for Flora did not like anything out of sorts. She knew JUST how to fix and direct others in the way they should live and behave. When Flora accomplished this good deed she was satisfied and all was well!
Flora finds herself in Sussex at her relatives farm... Cold Comfort Farm- but this is no ordinary farm for the Starkadders live here, and there has ALWAYS been Starkadders at Cold Comfort Farm...
As you can imagine this film is filled with oddball characters with oddball names and ALL of them are terrified of their Aunt Ada who rules the roost!
Flora tends to all the characters in her loving sensible way in which mayhem and bizarre and silly humor abounds. This is a fast and fun movie with a feel good ending. I could easily see this becoming a cult film because of repeated lines, silly names and colorful characters.
 Made for television, but released in the theaters, Cold Comfort Farm surpassed the projected outcome for this film. You might be surprised by the well known actors in this movie and some actors who have bit parts. They all do a superb job.
I would definitely have English subtitles when watching for the first time because Cold Comfort Farm language can be hard to decipher.
Definitely a movie I will watch again and again and those movies are hard to find- humor, decent language, fun characters, great actors... a good story!",1445385600,19,2341,4.426914153132251

813042,5,6304216939,"I'm a guy and this is a chick flick. British made, it's clever, quirky, and quite entertaining. The story line is as follows: A well educated, attractive young woman finds that she will be forced to rely on a small allowance and the goodwill of various family members if she is to survive. Initially, it appears as though everyone would like to help her though nothing in the way of suitable living arrangements with the assorted oddball relatives will come to fruition. Finally, she receives a bit of good news, an invitation to come and live at Cold Comfort Farm (with her deceased father's distant relatives) has been extended. Sadly, the young lady's sense of relief will be short lived.

Any preconceived notions she may have embraced regarding rural Britain soon dissipate. The stage is set with the arrival of two  dirt covered louts arriving at the train station in order to provide transportation back to Cold Comfort Farm. The sight of a terribly neglected farm and it's unkempt residents only serve to overwhelm her. The cast of characters are indeed characters with each being a bit stranger than the other. Our newly installed house guest will need some time in adjusting to the dilipidated farm and those who call the place home. Soon acclimated to her her surroundings, our spunky heroine will soon begin to work her ""magic"" and ever so slowly, life at Cold Comfort Farm will begin to change. Long over due, it'a a change for the better.

A strange sort of hope and pride (where neither previously existed) begins to emerge. Our heroine, through quiet manipulation begins to instill a sense of pride in each of the odd band of rural misfits. With the ""old ways"" now making way for the ""new"", the farm folk each receive the encouragement they need to pursue their dreams and they do!

This comedy set in the 1920's, this is a delightful film. Buy it, neither your time or money will be wasted. A must see!",1418860800,,1919,4.7023809523809526

The protagonist is a strong woman who strikes a balance between not being taken advantage of and accepting people as they are, but with a strong view to how they could be.

It is a clever and funny book made into a clever and funny movie.  Give it a try, esp. if you see the benefits and flaws of the average Victorian drama.

The creepy opening scene had both of us wondering whether I made the right choice, but the movie soon switched pace.

Many other reviews have gone into the plot, acting and faithfulness to the book (which I haven't read), so I won't bother with all that.

I'll just say that this movie kept us engaged and laughing. The delightful sort of movie that leaves you with a smile on your face and makes you want to see it again.  It's sort of Frank Capra's wonderful ""You Can't Take It With You"" meets ""Emma"".

814272,4,6304216939,"COLD COMFORT FARM by Stella Gibbons is a twentieth century classic and reads as fresh today as when it was written in 1932.  It parodies novels of rural life by several writers, yet is so well-written it has long outlived the subject it parodies, and we'd never know it if Stella Gibbons not made mention of one author in her text.  It stands alone as an almost perfect comic masterpiece.

The film ""Cold Comfort Farm"" almost lives up to its book.  Kate Beckinsale makes a perfect Flora Poste. She carries the movie admirably and she's very beautiful to boot.

Unfortunately, for whatever reason, the movie blew two of the best lines in the book, FLora's ""Oh, can't we?"" and Mister Neck's ""Did it see you?""  How it could waste two such perfectly-written gems?  I suppose they thought the way they were done in the film were ""improvements.""

Finally, the subject of Amos and his preaching.  The BBC-radio version did this better than any other version, by referring to it as ""alternative religion.""  While often referred to as a form of Christianity, this is not so.  Amos' ""Quivering Brethren"" is all about damnation without the hope of redemption or salvation, which is the opposite of Christianity, which offers the gift of repentance and forgiveness.  These concepts do not exist in the world of Amos' Quiverers.  The fact that the only mention made of Scripture at all is a mention of verses from the Old Testament (unstated) and a reference by Amos during his sermon of Kings of Israel underscores this pre-Incarnational approach, where man cannot be saved but looks forward to eternity in Hell whatever he or she does.  The book COLD COMFORT FARM may be read by any person of any faith without offense, but the use, however subtly, of Christian imagery by the Quiverers is inappropriate and injects some judgmentalism into the story, as if the film makers wanted to bar certain people from enjoying their movie.  I hate to refer to Amos' religion as a sort of paganism, but that is technically what it is, by a strict definition (not, I hasten to point out, as practiced).

Stella Gibbon's book was not judgemental, though some moderns who look for offense in everything try to make her book anti-Semitic on the basis of one person's name.

Flora Poste accepted things as she found them.  She even approved of the Quiverer's ridiculous hymn.  Saw simply pragmatically, through her clear eyes, how the farm might be improved, and set about doing so.  Flora  encouraged Amos to take his message of the hopeless degradation of lost mankind to the masses, not because she subscribed to it, but because it removed Amos' stranglehold on the farm.

But apart from these three small cavils, and the fact that the cast is not as strong as it was in the much inferior 1968 version -- oh, and a plot change that was probably necessary but still upsetting for purists -- this film is really very good.  I only wish Stella Gibbons had been alive to advise them, as she did on the BBC-radio version.  They might still have made the dumb mistakes in the script but they might have gotten Amos letter-perfect.

Oh, and for anyone who wants to know, they did finally bring in the Abbe Fausse-Maigre, but it was only very slightly and if you blink you'll miss him.  Too bad.

And to the viewers who complain that we never find out what happened in the woodshed . . . we were never meant to.  Nor were we ever able to know what Flora Poste's ""rights"" were, or if the goat died.  These are just more comedic touches from Stella Gibbons.  Some poor souls might have been led on by the hope of learning what Flora's rights were or what Aunt Ada saw in the woodshed (cow shed?  bicycle shed?) but in both the book COLD COMFORT FARM and the movie, the true delight is in the journey through the book, not in an arrival at the end. How many books or movies can you say that about?

As in most cases, reading the book is preferable.  If you have no time to read, this movie will have to serve.  It can't be as funny as the written word, but",1367539200,,4020,4.560669456066946

It's brilliantly witty and full of outrageous stereotypes - the Starkadders of Cold Comfort Farm, the bossy but charming cousin from London, the tyrannical grandmother, all wittily written and delightfully acted.
Kate Beckinsale is Flora Poste, a smart young thing from London at the end of the twenties who imagines herself a modern day  Jane Austen. Orphaned at 23, she decides with Austenian zeal to 'tidy up all messes' - and this inclination starts with her desire to ""smarten up"" the lives of her distant country relations - the Starkadders on their surreal Gothic farm.

A riot of west country accents, witty jokes and bizarre personalities stand in her way - from the sex maddened Seth (the ever painfully beautiful Rufus Sewell) secretly in love with the talkies, his mystically inclined mother Judith - perpetually playing with tarot cards, to Ada the Great Matriarch who holds the family in a wild vise like grip, to Amos, Judith's husband (Ian McKellan)- a fire and brimstone preacher. Along with the advise of Mary Smiley -(the ever wonderful Joanna Lumley) a lovely and eccentric London society darling, Flora's attempts to create order from chaos fills the Starkadder family - and the audience - with pure laughter. This is satire at its best - not cynical so much as heartwarming and  full of sincere charm!

814392,4,6304216939,"""Cold Comfort Farm, (1995), a 105 minute period romantic comedy, is a real odd duck among British films.  It was, firstly, made as a television movie, as a collaboration of the BBC and Thames International, ordinarily rivals. I don't know what that's all about, never seen that partnership elsewhere.  But perhaps putting together the remarkable aggregation of talent before and behind the camera in this enterprise was so expensive that the production required the resources of the two firms.  At any rate, somebody took a look at that talented collection of people, and gave the film a theatrical release, in which it did quite nicely, thank you.

In 1930s London, 20-year old Flora Poste, a pretty young debutante with ambitions to write, suddenly finds herself orphaned, and she's inherited only 100/year.  So she must go to live on the farm with the Starkadders, a group of her nutty, unsophisticated rural cousins, who apparently believe they've done her father and family some unspecified injury. Ada Doom, the bed-ridden, iron-willed matriarch of the farm objects strongly, but Flora, who loves cleanliness, tidiness and order, tries to achieve some in the tumbledown higgledy-piggledy house, in the lives of its occupants -- and in her own life.

For a TV movie, the investment in talent must have been quite substantial.

The story is about a young orphan, Flora Poste (Kate Beckinsale), who is a young society girl. Flora decides to move in with her backward and eccentric relatives (the Starkadders) who live on a run-down farm. Flora  then takes up the task to rehabilitate them even though they seem dreadfully beyond hope given that they are the grubbiest lot one could possibly imagine. She goes about matters by first removing the head of the family (Ian McKellan) who is an fire and brimstone preacher. And one by one the undaunted Flora expertly maneuvers the family members, and so proceeds this hilarious story, even though the grandmother who hides herself away upstairs in a bedroom proves to be her toughest challenge. This humorous and witty tale about creating order out of chaos is full of memorable characters, with names like Ada Doom, Mybug, Mrs. Beetle, Urk, and Adam Lambsbreath.

814533,3,6304216939,"(I really need to work on my title-writing).  I came across ""Cold Comfort Farm"" on one of those interminable internet lists, this one of the funniest books.  ""Three Men In A Boat"", which I've seen elsewhere listed as THE Funniest Book, Ever, was number one, and this, number two.  I've ordered the book, but I thought I'd stream the film, here.

About a half hour in, I realized I hadn't laughed once.  Not even a chuckle.  It simply wasn't funny.  And please, before you patronize me with your ""You don't get the dry British humor"", let me say that I'm intimately acquainted with all sorts of British humor, and like pretty much all of them, they even seem to manage ""crude"" better than we do.  It's a warm film, odd, it goes further than the American version would, but it's not funny.  In fact, what it feels like is a British version of an American genre of ""City girl goes to the country and elevates her country folk relatives"".  I've seen the clergy portrayed in British films---as power brokers in ""Elizabeth"", and alternately as prigs and warm, ""real"" people in ""A Room With A View"", among others;  but, the fire breathing preacher who is preaching hell more than salvation has always seemed, to me, more of an American institution.

Fans of ""Absolutely Fabulous"" will thrill to seeing Joanna Lumley in bits of this film, and pretty much stealing the camera anytime she gets near it.  Just to watch that wonderfully expressive face and listen to her posh voice, practically dripping champagne and pearls....I could have used more of her.

I would think that this film could be used as an artful demonstration of string theory, or parallel dimensions, by making at least five versions of the story, with the same cast and set; one as is; one as a murder mystery (Flora Post gets raped--when you see the family, you'll understand why I'd suggest going that far-- then murdered, but by whom, and on whose orders?), a tragedy (Flora makes everything worse, causes the loss of the farm and the death of several family members, before succumbing to disease herself), a drama (Flora sets out to reform them but gets caught up in their psychological dramas and winds up a basket case, thinking the City trying to convert her), and a horror flick (Serial killer loose in the village, Flora ends up as his or her target).

In any case the film begins with two mysteries---what was the Something Nasty in the woodshed, and what was the slight perpetrated on Flora's father?  And there's a suggestion made early in the film that Cold Comfort Farm is her inheritance, and she says that she doesn't want it, but none of this is ever cleared up, and so remain none more than plot devices.

I've seen far worse.  I did not endure this film, it was entertaining if somewhat predictable.  It felt more like a BBC/Masterpiece Theater presentation---did it actually hit the theaters?  I gave it two stars as for me, a three star movie is one I'd buy to watch repeatedly, once or more a year, and this is not one of those.  But I am going to read the book.",1337644800,,3044,4.6
814534,4,6304216939,"Stella Gibbons' 1932 novel COLD COMFORT FARM was essentially a mild parody of popular gothic romantic novels--and as such owes a good deal to Jane Austen's 1803 NORTHANGER ABBEY, which was similar in intent.  The novel has been filmed twice, with the most recent version in 1995, originally made for the BBC and then released theatrically abroad, where it was very popular.

Recently orphaned, Flora Poste (Kate Beckinsale) is annoyed to find herself without a significant inheritance, and although wealthy friends such as Mary Smiling (Joanna Lumley) are pleased to offer her a home, Flora (who aspires to be a novelist and is on the look out for material) elects to make her home with distant relatives: the Starkadder family of Howling, Sussex.  When she arrives she finds the family like something out WUTHERING HEIGHTS, eccentric, convinced they are cursed, and living in a house that is falling apart on a farm that produces barely enough to keep them alive.  Flora, however, decides to ""tidy up"" the Starkadder's problems, and proceeds to do precisely that with unexpected success.

The film suffers a bit from being a made-for-television movie, which is to say that it lacks the full visual sheen and polish of a great studio production; the script by Malcolm Bradbury is also a bit spotty, occasionally glossing over details in the story.  But the cast is exceptional.  The young Kate Beckinsale is a beauty and a memorable performer; others in the cast include no less than Ian McKellen as a hellfire and brimstone preacher, Eileen Atkins as the semi-psychotic Judith Starkadder, the aforementioned Joanna Lumley, and perhaps most memorably Sheila Burrell as Ada Doom, the family matriach who once saw something nasty in woodshed and still hasn't gotten over it.  Well, maybe it wasn't the woodshed.  Maybe it was the potting shed.  Or the tool shed.  But it was nasty, and she won't tell, but she uses it to ride roughshod over her family at every opportunity.  Director John Schlesinger (best known for such landmark films as SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY, MIDNIGHT COWBOY, and DARLING) keeps the film at leisurely but enjoyable pace, and everything about it is extremely enjoyable.

The DVD doesn't offer anything in the way extras, merely a trailer or so, but if you enjoy English comedy, and if your education stretches to the sort of novels that are being parodied in COLD COMFORT FARM, you're sure to enjoy this unassuming little film.  Recommended.

814535,2,6304216939,"I don't know what the other reviewers who gave this film a good review saw, but I was extremely disappointed.  From the excellent reviews I'd read about how hilarious this film was, I was really excited when it arrived and when my family and I got to see it.  Perhaps they were more used to British comedy, but I did not find any of it ""hilarious.""  Some of it was humorous, but nothing in this movie was side-splittingly uproarious, as I had been led to believe.
My family and I like British comedies from the 1970s and later,such as Are You Being Served? and The Last Of The Summer Wine, so we realize that they have a different sense of humor.  Perhaps the fact that the book upon which this film was based was written in 1932 explains why the comedy was much tamer or more droll than what we had expected.
The film could be called amusing, but I would warn viewers that they should not believe the hype it received from some of the most favorable reviews.",1329868800,,959,4.340782122905028
814536,5,6304216939,"This film is so funny I only have to think of it to chuckle... watching it brings waves of hysterical laughter!  Having read Stella Gibbons' book, which is exquisitely amusing, I was truly delighted with the BBC's rendition.  Kate Beckinsale is perfect as Flora Poste, a young woman orphaned with only 100 pounds a year, and who likes to make life tidy for all around her.  This film gives joy every time I watch.",1322265600,2,413,4.554054054054054
814537,4,6304216939,"""Cold Comfort Farm,"" Stella Gibbons' hilarious literary satire, is brought to life in this polished TV adaptation. Faithful to its source but never stuffy, the adaptation is full of solid performances and entertaining subplots and romance, even if it is a bit slow at times.

Flora Poste (Kate Beckinsale) is suddenly orphaned with only 100 pounds a year -- a piddling amount of money in high-society London. She aspires to be the next Jane Austen, and has no skills besides writing. (And given the number of times we hear ""golden orb,"" writing isn't too good either) So she agrees to go live at Cold Comfort Farm. The farm is well-named -- it's dirty, primitive, and broke.

The backwater inhabitants include sex-and-movies-obsessed Seth (Rufus Sewell), hellfire preacher Amos (Ian McKellen), his depressed wife Judith (Eileen Atkins), and the unhinged old Aunt Ada Doom (Sheila Burrell), who ""saw something nasty in the woodshed."" Not to mention Elfine (Maria Miles), a farm girl in love with a young blueblood. With practicality to spare, Flora sets up love matches, fixes up the family feuds, and tidies up the homestead.

Take some nineteenth century novel's most primitive farms, and plop a practical, thoroughly independent young woman in the middle of it. Add a few dark mysteries -- what are Flora's ""rights?"" What did Aunt Ada see? -- and you have ""Cold Comfort Farm."" Stella Gibbons had a subtle, wry sense of humor, and the movie adaptation keeps the spirit alive.

It's lots of fun to see Flora cleaning up house, both literally and figuratively. She keeps trying to arrange everyone's lives so, in the long run, they'll be happy -- while postponing what might make herself happy. The plot moves at a rather slow clip, sprinkled with fun scenes like Elfine's makeover, or Amos's frenetic sermon (complete with graphic descriptions of hell's torments). Not to mention the dozens of funny lines, like Amos's deadpan, ""Seth, you drain the well -- there's a neighbor missing.""

Kate Beckinsale does a wonderful job as the no-nonsence Flora Poste. She's backed up by good performances: Stephen Fry's obnoxiously overenthusiastic Mr. Mybug, an unwanted suitor of Flora's, and Joanna Lumley as Flora's best pal and bra collector. Ian McKellen is particularly good as a wild-haired hellfire preacher. And Eileen Atkins drifts around in a morbid, pop-eyed stupor as Judith Starkadder.

""Cold Comfort Farm"" is jolly good fun, a warm-hearted satire with plenty of excellent acting. Good fun for anyone who likes to poke fun at costume dramas and gothic family secrets.",1320969600,,2570,5.092636579572447
814632,5,6304216939,Loveable characters and a fun plot make for a great movie in Cold Comfort Farm. Ive watched this movie over and over and never tire of it. Definitly worth the money to have in your collection. A must see.,1316822400,2,204,4.256410256410256
814633,5,6304216939,""" I saw something nasty in the woodshed"".......

""There have ALWAYS been Starkadders at Cold Comfort Farm"".....these two lines are repeated as a sort of litany throughout the film.

Very subtle British comedy. You will quickly realize in the opening seen that you are in for a very quirky brand of comedy as the delicious, lovely Joanna Lumley playing the character, Mary Smiling, piddles over her hobby with her butler. Her hobby is a collection of lady's corsets, bras, undergarments on partial mannikins. Mary Smiling, her character, of course, is always smiling. The names are very much tongue in cheek as well.

""Highly sexed young men living on farms are always named Seth or Ruben""..... [Flora Poste referring to cousins she has not yet met on Cold Comfort Farm.]

The film opens with about 50 seconds of black and white footage setting the history of the little girl who saw something nasty in the woodshed. That little girl is now elderly and uses whatever she saw in the woodshed as a lever and club over everyone's lives who lives with her on Cold Comfort Farm. Great Aunt Ada's (who saw something nasty in the woodshed when she was a little girl) worst fear is that her children and grandchildren will leave her alone on the farm.

Kate Beckinsale plays the role of Flora Poste, known throughout the film as ""Robert Poste's child"". Flora is recently orphaned in 1930's London when both her mother and father die at the same time. No relatives in London care to take her in as the estate only left her 100 pounds per year for her allowance. So, she stays with a friend in London while she writes letters to all of her relatives throughout Great Britain seeking the appropriate fit for the next stage of her life. Flora sorts through the responses from the relatives and chooses to go to Cold Comfort Farm with her cousins, the Starkadders. Fecundity rules as Flora leaves behind the societal refinement she enjoyed in the upper crust in London. Flora has ambitions to be a writer and believes she must experience ""real life"" (on a farm) in order to write about it. However, she has an ulterior motive. She possesses enough self awareness at a relatively young age to know something about herself. She likes to ""tidy things up"" that are messy. Thus, the untidy Cold Comfort Farm and the people who inhabit it seem an apropos challenge for her.

DO YOU KNOW OR HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH ANY DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILIES? Then, you will love this film.

What I liked about the film is the trans-formative nature of Flora Poste, Beckinsale's character. Without being too much of a busybody she inserts herself into her unknown relatives' lives on Cold Comfort Farm and literally transforms the farm and all the people on it. It is a sheer joy to watch it unfold.",1316736000,6,2758,4.70954356846473

There is the fire and brimstone preacher, the crazy, depressed Ida Doom, the handsome, virile stud-muffin, etc...

814798,3,6304216939,"We watched this movie on the recommendation of a friend and found it just a little strange. Neither of us had read the 1932 book by Stella Gibbons and was exposed to the plot for the first time via the movie; we both suspected that the book developed the characters and situations more completely.

The movie gets off to a slow start and presents Flora Poste, the Kate Beckinsale character, as a rather self-centered controlling young lady who is initially something of a put-off.

The other characters were generally over-stated characters that verged on caricatures in a typical fashion for British humor; not necessarily bad, just a little extreme. Whereas we are devoted fans of British drama, we occasionally have a little problem with some British humor.

Her curiosity compels her to choose a most unlikely place to live, a remote farm called Cold Comfort Farm; she seems confident she can whip it into shape in accordance with her personal standards. The movie records her adventures in doing that and also reveals how the experience is also changing her for the better.

The pace of the movie picks up about mid-point and we found ourselves beginning to really find the movie amusing (using the recommended term as per the movie).

If you are a fan of British comedy, with all that implies, you will probably enjoy this one; I suggest you rent it first and put it to the test before you buy.",1282348800,,1400,4.744855967078189

814805,5,6304216939,"The film version of ""Cold Comfort Farm"" is an adaptation of the comic novel by Stella Gibbons, published in 1932. This novel was a sort of parody of the often bleak portrayal of rural life as described in the works of Thomas Hardy and other authors. I've read the novel, and loved it, but I have to admit I actually loved the movie much more! It is the way the characters were brought 'alive' by the wonderfully talented ensemble cast, and especially the luminous portrayal of the lead character, Flora Poste, by Kate Beckinsale.

The story centers around Flora Poste (Beckinsale) who is a recently orphaned society girl. Instead of looking for a job, she tries to find relatives that will take her in and allow her time to write, thinking she has the makings of a novelist, much to the chagrin of her 'mentor' and friend (played by Absolutely Fabulous' Joanna Lumley). Flora thinks she has found a suitable place, Cold Comfort Farm, residence to the Starkadders, who are under the control of matriarch, Ada Doom (Sheila Burrell) and comprise Judith Starkadder (Eileen Atkins), Ian McKellen (Amos Starkadder), Seth Starkadder (Rufus Sewell), Reuben Starkadder (Ivan Kaye), and Elfine Starkadder (Maria Miles), among many other endearing and infuriating characters.

The plot moves along quickly as Flora brings a much needed breath of fresh air to the residents of Cold Comfort Farm, starting with little things to cheer the place up, and worming her way into the confidences of the residents, finding a challenge in Ada Doom who holds the other Starkadders in thrall to her, due to the trauma she suffered after witnessing ""something nasty in the woodshed"" many years ago, and the secret of some great wrong that was done to Flora Poste's father by one of the Starkadders.

The movie has all the elements to make it an engaging and fun viewing experience - a talented ensemble cast, an interesting and even intriguing plot, young love, romance, family secrets, youthful yearnings, etc. This is a movie that uplifts and puts a smile on one's face (and yes, lots of laughs along the way too).

COLD COMFORT FARM has a thin, empty, insubstantial quality.  It no doubt imagines itself as witty, in an Oscar Wilde sort of way.  Not!

The humor is best exemplified by the scene wherein the boyfriend tells the heroine that he owns a plane.

""You own a plane?"" she asks.  ""Whatever for?""

""I think everyone should own a plane,"" he jokes.

""Oh Charles!"" she laughs.

Yeah.  Funny stuff.  Real witty.

The ""humor"" is arbitrary, is based on nothing, and goes nowhere.

The film tries to build suspense about the dark deed that was done to Robert Post, but we never learn what it was.  What's more, by the end of the film, I don't give a damn.

The heroine ""solves"" everyone's problems effortlessly, all the pieces falling into place.  For instance, she invites a bigshot Hollywood producer for a visit.  The producer is conveniently seeking a British farmboy type, yet he can't find one from among the tens of thousands of wannabes in Hollywood.  He spots the perfect farmboy (the heroine's friend), who seems asleep when he's ""discovered"" as though he expected it and doesn't much care.

Of course, a silly non-plot may suffice for a comedy if it were a funny comedy, which this isn't.  No laughs.  Not even a polite chuckle.  Maybe a half smile.  A highly talented cast gone to waste.

The great John Schlesinger, director of such fantastic films as Marathon Man, The Believers, and Midnight Cowboy, would not seem to be one's go-to guy for a light comedy. In fact, I can't think of a comedy the guy's done, other than this, since Billy Liar back in the sixties. But did he pull it off? You bet he did.

Flora Poste (Kate Beckinsale, before she became a household name) has recently been orphaned. With dreams of being a writer, she decides, with the aid of her friend Mary (Joanna Lumley of Absolutely Fabulous) to find some relatives to stay with who will both put her up and give her ample material for the Great English Novel she plans to write. After a succession of increasingly odd letters from the darker, cobwebbed branches of the family tree, she gets one from her cousin Judith at Cold Comfort Farm, and decides it seems like just the place. Once she gets there, she meets the family: proselytizing patriarch Amos (Ian McKellen), dolorous cousin Judith (Dame Eileen Atkins, recently in Ask the Dust), brothers Reuben (Layer Cake's Ivan Kaye) and Seth (Dark City's Rufus Sewell), farmhands Adam (Freddie Jones, recently of Ladies in Lavender), Urk (character actor Jeremy Peters), and Rennet (Sophie Revell, in her only screen role), and Adam's gorgeous daughter Elfene (Kafka's Anna Miles, in her last screen role to date), all presided over by the house's mysterious matriarch, Aunt Ada (Sheila Burrell of Devices and Desires), who hasn't left her room in twenty years. In addition to having to deal with an entire family of neurotics, she's also being pursued by the eccentric writer Myberg (Stephen Fry), London socialite Charles (Tomrorow Never Dies' Christopher Bowen), and a Hollywood film producer (character actor Trevor Baxter). Enough material for an entire series of novels, but Flora finds that she has a touch for sorting out tangled lives instead.

It's a lovely little film, picturesque and neat, which is the main criticism of it by those familiar with the novel and the previous adaptation (also filmed for British television back in 1968). Schlesinger did, at least, get his actors dirty to portray farmhands, an appreciated touch in a world where James Bond never wrinkles his suit. Still, the chaos into which Flora Poste walks never seems to get all that chaotic. (Myberg, whom she constantly refers to as ""Mybug,"" is the notable exception; Fry does a fine, fine job.) The movie could dual-class as a pastoral at times. One almost expects James Herriot to stop by and check for sick animals. Still, this does nothing to lessen the amusement factor, nor the inevitable feel-good endings to all the many tangled stories to be found here.

This is an excellent and very earthy adaptation of Stella Gibbon's 1932 satirical novel (which itself is an odd marriage of Hardy and Wodehouse). Where the village pub is named ""The Condemned Man"" and the cows are named Aimless, Feckless, Graceless, and Pointless. Both the novel and its adaptation are joyfully depressing and packed with literary eccentricity and subtle humor. If you like ""Faulty Towers"" then you can expect to get off on the humor. But if you prefer ""Hot Shots! Part Deux"", you should probably pass on ""Cold Comfort Farm"".

There are three possible viewer reactions:  It's not funny.  I didn't figure out it was a comedy until halfway through but then I found it hilarious.  I couldn't stop laughing.

Kate Beckinsale plays Flora Poste (always referred to by her relatives as Robert Poste's daughter), a recently orphaned 19 year old who chooses to live with relatives (the Starkadders) she has never met,  at gloomy Cold Comfort Farm in Sussex. Beckinsale, even more radiant than usual, pulls off a nice characterization of the resourceful yet snobbish heroine. Like Pollyanna, she is a catalyst for positive change, but they are calculated changes. Her instinctive snobbishness (Beckinsale has a real talent for this) is played for laughs since everyone would feel a bit superior and distanced from this eccentric collection of misfits.

The adaptation nicely incorporates Gibbons's subtle parody of Jane Austen romantic clichs, from the controlling madwoman in the attic to wood nymph poetess, to the quivering parishioners. Even the production design is a funny send-up of the standard BBC mini-series look.

This is really a terrific production, doubly so for Beckinsale fans.

She makes inquiries out to the farthest branches of the family tree about visiting, a stay of indefinite length, and is least rebuffed by the distant relatives at Cold Comfort Farm. She arrives, she discovers the 'eccentricities' of her relatives, and she sets about to rearrange their lives for them. After much amusement, she succeeds, and sails happily off into the sunset with her own life in a new direction. taken at face value, it's entertaining enough.

But this is a spoof, and works best for a viewer who knows the genre being spoofed. Even though this takes place in some anonymous time around the 1920s, the characters and situations satirize costume dramas of the Bronte sort. The other watching with me practically rolled out of her chair laughing every time she saw some new takeoff on some old stereotype.

This was actually first broadcast on the BBC and was then brought to movie houses (predominantly, arthouse and independent).  It couldn't have been released at a more appropriate time.  (I believe it was between 1995 or 1996 when Jane Austen was all the rage.)  We had our pick of either the prim and well-polished ""Pride and Prejudice,"" ""Sense and Sensibility"" or ""Emma.""  Then, there was ""Cold Comfort Farm.""  This film was set in an entirely more modern time period (1920s or 1930s, I believe).

The story revolves around Flora Poste, a young, fashionable orphan who comes to stay with the Starkadder family, and proceeds to turn the family's long-accepted, modest lifestyle on its head.  Flora turns matchmaker, housekeeper and so much more in such a short time.  Anything considered proper and well-accepted is questioned by the young Ms. Poste, and almost anything is possible when she decides it is!

The cast is great!  The wonderful Eileen Atkins, as the matriarch, Judith, has a face only a mother could love, and makes great use of it to her advantage--playing it up to look particularly miserable and long-suffereing.  The randy Seth Starkadder, is played by the greasy Rufus Sewell, who will go for a roll in the hay with just about any damsel at any time.  Nauseatingly convincing....oy vey!  And, let's not forget the appearance put in by the wonderful Sir Ian McKellan.

I believe this film has real cross-over appeal and is definitely not a chick flick.

This is a great remake and is director, John Schlessinger's acclaimed 1995 film adaptation starring a TERRIFIC Kate Beckinsale as the recently orphaned, Flora Poste.

Set in the 1930's, in England, Flora writes to all of her relation, hoping someone will take her in as she has no real drive or ambition, save for possibly becoming the next Jane Austen.  Flora accepts an offer from The Starkadders Of Cold Comfort Farm in Howling, Sussex. She thinks that she just might like farm life and it might be good for her writing career. However, once she arrives she finds out that the farm has had a curse upon it along with all of the inhabitants, human and animal alike.

The Starkadder family is comprised of Amos & his forelorn wife, Judith, & their two virile & rakish sons, Seth and Reuben. As Flora says, ""Highly sexed young men living on farms are always called Seth or Reuben.""

Also living at Cold Comfort is a lovely waifish sprite of a cousin, Elfine, the hired help, Adam Lambsbreath, Urk, Rennet & Mrs. Beetle. Also locked in her chambers is an old crusty hermit of a grandmamma, Ada Doom (appropriately named).  The Starkadders & the rest of the clan are pure country folk with pure country ways. Their lives being quite primitive in contrast with Flora's.

Flora sets out to change it all though and with some priceless and hilarious scenes ensuing.  Flora tries to bring everyone around to a higher common sense and does it with great gusto.

With lines in the film like:

Amos Starkadder: Seth, drain the well. There's a neighbor missing.

Violet:  She b'aint worf it Urk, she jus b'aint worf it!

and the two most repeated and beloved lines in the film:

Ada Doom: I saw something nasty in the woodshed! &  ""There has always been Starkadders on Cold Comfort Farm.""

Flora, with dreams of becoming a novelist, moves to the rural countryside to live with her great Aunt and her family on Cold Comfort Farm, a down-on-its-luck farmstead deep in the English countryside. There she encounters a number of wonderful eccentric characters who seem to be living in the past - one of them uses a twig to clean the dishes. Flora sets about lifting the doom and gloom that surrounds the farm and bringing 'enlightenment' to the inhabitants by helping to make their suppressed dreams come true.
What makes this movie so much fun is the characters that Flora encounters, and as with such character-driven movies, the choice of actors is so important. Thankfully some strong caliber acting talent was brought in and they equip themselves wonderfully. From Ian McKellen of the LORD OF THE RING'S trilogy to Rufus (A KNIGHT'S TALE) Sewell the results are exemplary.
Raised for the first ten years of my life on my grandfathers farm on the English-Scottish border, I found the movie a particular delight.

(And given the number of times we hear ""golden orb,"" writing isn't too good either) So she agrees to go live at Cold Comfort Farm. The farm is well-named -- it's dirty, primitive, and broke.

The backwater inhabitants include sex-and-movies-obsessed Seth (Rufus Sewell), hellfire preacher Amos (Ian McKellen), his depressed wife Judith (Eileen Atkins), and the unhinged old Aunt Ada Doom (Sheila Burrell), who ""saw something nasty in the woodshed."" Not to mention Elfine (Maria Miles), a farm girl in love with a young blueblood. With practicality to spare, Flora sets up love matches, fixes up the family feuds, and tidies up the homestead.

Take some nineteenth century novel's most primitive farms, and plop a practical, thoroughly independent young woman in the middle of it. Add a few dark mysteries -- what are Flora's ""rights?"" What did Aunt Ada see? -- and you have ""Cold Comfort Farm."" Stella Gibbons had a subtle, wry sense of humor, and the movie adaptation keeps the spirit alive.

It's lots of fun to see Flora cleaning up house, both literally and figuratively. She keeps trying to arrange everyone's lives so, in the long run, they'll be happy -- while postponing what might make herself happy. The plot moves at a rather slow clip, sprinkled with fun scenes like Elfine's makeover, or Amos's frenetic sermon (complete with graphic descriptions of hell's torments). Not to mention the dozens of funny lines, like Amos's deadpan, ""Seth, you drain the well -- there's a neighbor missing.""

Kate Beckinsale does a wonderful job as the no-nonsence Flora Poste. She's backed up by good performances: Stephen Fry's obnoxiously overenthusiastic Mr. Mybug, an unwanted suitor of Flora's, and Joanna Lumley as Flora's best pal and bra collector. Ian McKellen is particularly good as a wild-haired hellfire preacher. And Eileen Atkins drifts around in a morbid, pop-eyed stupor as Judith Starkadder.

""Cold Comfort Farm"" is jolly good fun, a warm-hearted satire with plenty of excellent acting. Good fun for anyone who likes to poke fun at costume dramas and gothic family secrets.",1094688000,5,2570,5.092636579572447
815561,4,6304216939,"Kate Beckensale might be best remembered for her role in PEARL HARBOR, but I first became aware of her in EMMA.  I am very happy to see that CCF has finally been 'uncoupled' from the porm film one used to find for sale with it. I have been replacing my lazer disks one by one as films become available on DVD and had waited for a long while for this DVD.
The film is a gem.  Joanna Lumley makes a rather brief appearance although she is pictured on the DVD cover.  I suppose Universal Studios thought we Americans might recognize Lumley before Eileen Atkins, who also plays in this film although she was recently seen in COLD MOUNTAIN as the 'old goat woman' or Ian McKellen who played Gandalf in the Ring triogy, or Stephen Fry who played Jeeves in the JEEVES AND WOSTER series.
CCF is funny and sentimental in a British sort of manner. Who else but the British could envision the salvation of one of their own farm oafs as an offer from Hollywood to play in what undoubtedly will be romantic film productions. (Hey, we aren't all boobs who shoot from the lip!!). And, Joanna Lumley is superb as a slightly weird single girl who spends her down time fondling mannequins.
In spite of the tongue and cheek sexual innuendo, I think this film is suitable for family watching.  The sly sexy humor is probably over the heads of most American kids. But what do I know, I don't watch American tv, I watch BBC America.",1084147200,4,1410,4.411538461538462
815562,5,6304216939,"I saw this film soon after its 1995 release and thought it wonderful, all the more so because Kate Beckinsale's interpretation of Flora Poste reminded me very much of my oldest daughter. So I was pleased to see that it has finally come out on DVD; I bought a copy, watched it again, and still think it wonderful.
You should be warned that you may have a hard time understanding what some of the inhabitants of Cold Comfort Farm are saying. However, that's intentional and straight from the novel, where the accents and strange word usages often leave Flora puzzled. Here's an exchange (from the novel) that I believe is reproduced pretty much verbatim in the movie, when Reuben comes in after working out in the fields not long after Flora has started living at Cold Comfort Farm:
========
...After another minute Reuben brought forth the following sentence:
'I ha' scranleted two hundred furrows come five o'clock down i' the bute.'
It was a difficult remark, Flora felt, to which to reply. Was it a complaint? If so, one might say, 'My dear, how too sickening for you!' But then, it might be a boast, in which case the correct reply would be, 'Attaboy!' or more simply, 'Come, that's capital.' Weakly she fell back on the comparativel safe remark:
'Did you?' in a bright interested voice.
========
Speaking of which, the original novel (written in 1932 by Stella Gibbons) is just as wonderful, and the film is a remarkably faithful adaptation, if (understandably) a bit trimmed and modified. I read the book for the first time after watching the DVD release of the movie and was delighted to see that most of the dialog comes straight from the book, including my favorite line (the interchange between Neck, the movie producer, and Aunt Ada), if a bit punched up.
Finally, for the reviewers who are frustrated that we never find out what Ada saw in the woodshed, what wrongs were done to Robert Poste by Amos Starkadder, and what Flora Poste's rights were...well, the novel leaves us pretty much in the dark as well. In the book, Aunt Ada _does_ answer the second question for Flora--though we as readers don't get to hear the answer--and Ada is interrupted before she can answer Flora's intriguing follow up question, ""And did the goat die?""
The movie and the book are both delightful; enjoy.  ..bruce..",1082332800,75,2306,4.750623441396509
815563,4,6304216939,"Cold Comfort Farm is a jolly film that bounces along as merrily as its theme tune.  It's a rollicking good comedy with a laugh-out-loud collection of Dickensian characters (the doom-stricken Starkadders, the rustic Adam Lambsbreath, and the upper crust Hawk-Monitors).  Certainly the film is very over-the-top and silly, but it's light-hearted fun - a welcome alternative to the glut of psychological, heart-wrenching, blood-and-guts fare on the market.
The Starkadders live on the bleak acres of Cold Comfort Farm, where ""the cows are barren and the sows are farren"".  Into this gloomy and eccentric setting comes young, 1930s-modern Flora Poste, who sets to winning the hearts and minds of Cold Comfort's inhabitants, and dragging the Starkadders into the twentieth century.  Along the way she manages to rearrange and enliven her own life too.
Kate Beckinsale (prior to her arrival on the scene of big-budget American flicks) is a likeable and chirpy young lady with a talent for organisation.  In the supporting roles, Joanna Lumley is delightfully sarcastic as Flora's incongruously named aunt, Mary Smiling, who has a rather unusual hobby.  And Ian McKellen is a real scene-stealer as the fire-and-brimstone preacher of the Church of the Quivering Brethren.
The plot revolves around Great Aunt Ada Doom and the 'narsty' thing she saw in the woodshed nigh on 70 years ago.  There is also the mysterious wrong perpetrated on Flora's father by the Starkadders sometime in the dim and misty past.  So it is a tad frustrating that the audience is never let in on either of these secrets!  But these are minor quibbles in what is otherwise an excellent comedic romp, with some interesting and atmospheric cinematography.  A very good (and very British) laugh.",1080777600,5,1759,5.18374558303887

Oh, I can give a review of how the story is effective to that of the novelist style, but why should I? It has its storyline stereo-types, but it's something that we can relate to and identify with with those around us. It's wonderfully funny. The woodshed adds the special little craziness to a group of people who are very escentric but very loveable. Each character is protrayed to fill in the need for Flora in her quest to bring them into the current century. We never do learn what was in the woodshed, but one can get an idea. lol. And what did the family do that they felt they needed to atone to for Flora's father? Who knows, but it was nice of them. To sum this up, watching Cold Comfort Farm gives one a good feeling and can make one laugh him- or herself.",1076457600,4,917,4.071823204419889
815565,5,6304216939,"Any fan of Jane Austen's will appreciate this film's charm and sparkling wit. It is one of my favorite films ever! I saw this at an arthouse theater in Denver and everyone (including me) in the audience was roaring with laughter.
The story centers around the outspoken, feisty and newly-orphaned Flora Poste (aka Robert Poste's child), who moves from London to live with her rural, backwoods relatives in Cold Comfort Farm. Led by her mysterious great-aunt Ada Doom, her relatives prove to be absolutely eccentric and incredibly funny.  Among her other quirky relatives are Amos Starkadder (Ian McKellen), his wife Judith  (Eileen Atkins) and their children Seth (Ivan Kaye), Reuben (the hunky Rufus Sewell in one of his most memorable roles) and Elfine (Maria Miles). Then there is Flora's sophisticated London friend Mary Smiling (Joanna Lumley) who provides Flora with some much needed comfort, advice and fashionable magazines.
With a role that foreshadows her future role in Jane Austen's ""Emma"", Kate Beckinsale perfectly embodies a 1930s-like Emma Woodhouse role as she interferes in the lives of all of her relations and completely makes them all over. This doesn't bode well with her great-aunt Ada and cousin Judith, who abhor change of any sort.
It is a riotous film all the same and the brilliant performances from everyone involved make this DVD an absolute must have! If you enjoy British humor and satire, you'll love ""Cold Comfort Farm!""",1074902400,5,1453,5.1265822784810124

Similar to the film "" Pollyanna "" Flora breezes into people's lives, making them happier than they've ever been. Kate Beckensale is beautiful, charming and loveable in a film everyone will enjoy.

The characters Miss Flora Poste (aka Robert Poste's child) encounters at and around Cold Comfart Form(let's call it CCF) are flat out WEIRD. Being accustomed to period pieces like Merchant Ivory things, I missed much of the point. Now, I realized CCF should have been viewed with some of my P.G.Wodehouse-jaundiced(btw, Stephen Fry[Jeeves]is in this), ""Merry Buds Of May""-loving eye. The whole cast is perfick! and Joanna Lumley(best known as Patsy in ""Absolutely Fabulous!"") seems to own the franchise for playing a semi-idle, terminally hip fashion slave. No matter if it's the 30's like CCF, or the 90's, Ms Lumley has it nailed. I had no idea who played Flora Poste, and was astonished to see it was Kate Beckinsale, who was dressed down for this role. I happened to be watching a bio of Sir Alec Guinness, and one of the interviewees was Eileen Atkins. I couldn't place her face, but suddenly I realized she was in CCF(as the terminally depressive Judith Starkadder). I clicked over to my movies listings, & was able to turn my Mother & sister on to CCF the next day. If you like British humour, check this out.

815660,4,6304216939,"""Cold Comfort Farm"", the novel, was a parody of naturalism.  The melodramatic and eccentrically rustic Starkadders- like Seth, a lusty young man who loves ""the talkies,"" Amos, a fire and brimstone preacher, and Great Aunt Ada Doom, who saw something nasty in the woodshed- are interesting enough in their own right, but are really parodies of the way people were portrayed in the Faulkneresque novels of the time.  The movie manages to capture some of the parody in the book, but not all of it.  It did include many of my favorite bits from the novel, and some truly stellar performances.  If you are an Ian McKellan fan, don't miss him as Amos.  Eileen Atkins also does a grand job as the Emma-esque Flora.

Beckinsale is the perfect good-natured luftmensch and meddler and I loved what should be a classic line of ""I saw something nasty in the woodshed!"".  The matriarchal contraints on the family was a riot to behold.  This film can also be a lesson on how to deal with subtle verbal threats to your psyche and how perfectly far dismissiveness can go.  At any rate, it's a clever and feel-good piece of fun which is always a good reason to see a film, I'd say.",1025395200,3,759,4.544117647058823
815662,4,6304216939,"I watched this movie on the recommendation of a couple of frequent movie viewers.  This film was fun to watch on a rainy Sunday morning.  It was not profound, and while most of the characters have a happy resolution of their problems, the film will not appeal to all.  If you are a Jane Austen fan and love Emma in particular, the film will appeal to you for three reasons - firstly, the heroine Flora Poste slings off Jane Austen quotes and references (beginning with her intention to write her ""Persuasion"" when she is 53);  secondly, because Flora acts much like Emma in trying to improve and manage the lives of others (without being blind to her own true love);  and lastly, because the heroine Flora is played by Kate Beckinsale (who will go to to play Emma in the Andrew Davis/A&E version, called Emma 3).  There are also a number of other stellar actors, most notably Sir Ian McKellen (playing a hell-raising preacher) and Eileen Atkins (playing his sad-sack cousin/wife).
I have not read the book nor seen the 1971 version, and therefore can judge the film only by its own merits.  While the film left me with a smile on my face, it also left me a little puzzled.  What was Judith Starkadder's real problem, why does she feel the family owes something to Robert Poste's child, and what did Aunt Ada Doom see in the woodshed?
A brief plot summary:  London society girl Flora Poste discovers that she has only 100 pounds a year, which will not keep her in stockings.  She decides to write to her many relatives to see if one of them will take her in (this is the 1930s, I believe).  Flora decides to go to the most interesting set of relatives - the Starkadder cousins on Cold Comfort Farm.  The family are portrayed as hillbillies in the worst sense, completely wedded to tradition, dirty and ignorant, unwilling to reform (such as using a dishmop instead of twigs).  [Warning:  this depiction of British farmers of the 1930s may be offensive to some].
  Flora arrives at Cold Comfort Farm to discover that the farm and the family are apparently cursed.  The family seems to feel that it owes something to her as Robert Poste's child (this is never explained in the film) but her cousins deeply resent her.  The cousins are Amos and Judith Starkadder (cousins who married), their sons Reuben and Seth (the latter a lusty young man who loves the talkies), and several others.  Gradually, Flora changes the way in which her Starkadder cousins live (by cleaning up the house, beginning with her bedroom curtains), persuades nearly each member of the family to make some critical changes, and also brings about three marriages in the future.  All this, while also dangling along a London-based ""embryo parson"" with his own airplane and a locally-based ""writer"" who fancies himself in love with her.
Quick summary:  The film was entertaining as long as it is not taken seriously.  There was an element of snobbery in the relations between the city people and the country people that I did not quite like (even if it is true of this period and of today).  The depiction of the gulf between the ""county"" families and the farmers is hinted at, but made light of.  However, there is enough interest sustained in the movie, aided with strong acting from Kate Beckinsale (Flora Poste), Sir Ian McKellan (Amos Starkadder), Eileen Atkins (Judith Starkadder), and Rufus Sewell (Seth Starkadder) that carries the viewer along.  Recommended for lovers of Jane Austen, or for lovers of eccentric British films.  Some crudity but not as much as in WITHNAIL AND I or the BLACKADDER series.",1019952000,7,3578,4.721417069243156
815663,5,6304216939,"This is a marvelous and fairly faithful adaptation of Stella Gibbons' 1932 novel of the same name. The film brilliantly captures the quirkiness of the novel which is a hysterically funny, tongue in cheek parody of the heavy handed, gloomy novels of some early twentieth century English writers who had previously been so popular. The film is likewise hysterically funny and itself seems to parody British costume dramas.
The film starts out innocuosly enough, when well educated Flora Poste (Kate Beckinsale) finds herself orphaned as a young woman. Discovering that her father was not the wealthy man she believed him to be, she is resigned to the fate of having to live on a hundred pounds a year. After some discussion with her good friend, the wealthy Mrs. Smiley (Joanna Lumley), Flora opts to live with relatives, rather than earn her bread. She seeks out a most unlikely set of relations with whom to do so, the decidedly odd Starkadder family who live in rural Howling, Sussex.
Therein begins what is certainly one of the funniest movies to grace the silver screen. When Flora arrives in Howling, she meets her odd relatives, who live in neglected, ramshackle ""Cold Comfort Farm"", where they still wash the dishes with twigs, and have cows named Graceless, Pointless, Feckless, and Aimless. Headed by a matriarchal old crone, Flora's aunt, Ada Doom Starkadder (Sheila Burrell), who has not been right in the head since she ""saw something nasty happen in the woodshed"" nearly seventy years ago, they are a motley and strange crew indeed. Confronted with their dismal and gloomy existence, Flora sets about trying to put things to right.
Peppered with eccentric, memorable characters, this film will take the reader on a journey not easily forgotten. Kate Beckinsale is delightful as the practical, no nonsense Flora Poste. Joanna Lumley is delicious as the sophisticated and wordly Mrs. Smiley. Eileen Atkins is a standout as Flora's gloomy first cousin, Judith Starkadder, Ada's daughter. Rufus Sewell is well cast as  Judith's son, Seth Starkadder, the oversexed ladies man. The role of the fire and brimstone preacher, Amos Starkadder, is played to perfection by Ian McKellen, while Shiela Burrell is nothing short of sensational as the imperious Ada Doom Starkadder. The rest of the supporting cast is likewise uniformly excellent.
All in all, this is a hilariously funny film and every bit as brilliant as the novel upon which it was based. It is certainly worth having in one's personal collection, as it is a keeper by any standard.",1017187200,113,2546,5.033175355450237
