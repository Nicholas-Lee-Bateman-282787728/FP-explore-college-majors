Plot-wise, it's pretty lame, even comical, but it kept in tune with the times - the opinions of tele-evangelists and out-of-touch PTA morons - and of being a social outcast based just on the fact that someone liked a different type of music (in this case, heavy metal).

Eddie Weinbauer (Marc Price) is a mega-fan of Sammy Curr, a heavy metal star, who dies in a fire at 38 years old.  Eddie is devastated and when he goes to the local radio station looking to the DJ (a cameo by Gene Simmons of KISS fame) for comfort, he doesn't get it (the DJ, in so many words, said Curr was angry and it was just a matter of time before he came to a bad end), but he does get the only copy (vinyl!) of Sammy's unreleased record called ""Songs in the Key of Death.""

Eddie goes home and listens to it for comfort and dreams of Curr's final moments in his hotel room.  He wakes up hearing the record sticking in one place and plays it in reverse to hear it (which is probably where those PMRC, PTA, and tele-evangelist freaks got their idea about heavy metal records being played backwards in order for us to receive demonic messages).  It begins a relationship with his dead music hero, but things quickly get out of hand for both Weinbauer and Curr.

This movie is dated (all that vinyl, audio tapes, and outdated stereo equipment!), but it's entertaining nonetheless.

And, just for the record, Ozzy Osbourne had a cameo in this movie.  He played one of those self-righteous tele-evangelists (a little revenge on Ozzy's part for their crusade against him in the 80s?) and his total air-time was about 2 minutes - if that!  Gene Simmons' role was just as small.

I recently watched ""Trick or Treat"" after not having seen the movie for over a decade, and I was reminded of what it was like being a metal-head in the 80s.  While not teased to the extent of the character of Eddie Weinbauer, I got teased and made fun of, nonetheless.  It's a bit nauseating seeing the same people who called me a ""devil worshipper"" back then having jumped on the Ozzy bandwagon today (since that beyond-dumb ""reality"" TV show ""The Osbournes"" further poisoned the idiot box) and claiming they love ""rock and roll.""  Whatever.

The hair, the demin, the stereo equipment is dated, but ""Trick or Treat"" is definitely entertaining.  - Donna Di Giacomo",1169769600,,2363,4.550827423167848
