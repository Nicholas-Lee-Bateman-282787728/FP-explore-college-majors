The pilots all made it look so easy.

8380659,3,B002TV20NI,"Awesome HD air-show footage with brilliant color, with very little generic feel to the video. The only problem I find is with the length. Three disks totaling 6hrs 46 mins, which is awesome, but this feature is rife with repeated segments and interviews.  By the third disk some segments have played three or more times already, and it starts to get annoying.  Could probably have been boiled down somewhat. Overall it was well worth the $7.00 it was marked at.",1331942400,4,461,4.75
