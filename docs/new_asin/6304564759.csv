7874408,5,6304564759,"I like complex films that ""work""; and this is one of the best I've seen.  Moreover, as its title suggests, this is a work of magical realism -- the film is imbued with the sense of spirituality, magicalness, and malignancy.

The connection to Carl Maria von Weber's great opera Der Freischtz has already been mentioned.  The plot of the opera is essentially the plot of the movie.  The fact that the movie begins with a family attending the opera and needing to take shelter during a bombing is a link to the story itself.

The protagonist is a sniper for the state.  We see him using his skill to rescue a hostage from her captor and then concerned about being inaccurate in his shooting.  The Devil, or perhaps his earthly counterpoint, suggests a deal, providing magical bullets to the hero ... or does he.

Up to the final seconds of the movie we are not to know how much is metaphor, how much is suggestiveness, how much is real.

The origin of the state of Hungary is linked to a suggestion that now in some way the state is threatened, perhaps by this sniper.  And, again, perhaps not.

All of which makes this sound too mystical.  Not at all.  Each thread, taken at is own face value, is a delight:  The hunter who has his own issues, his own personal problems at home, and who must come to terms with them is sufficient to be a story in his own right.  The story of the snails could easy be from any of the magical realism films that have made their way to the west from both the oriental and the romantic cultures.

And the intersection of history, opera - both story and music, parable, and deep personal need is handled perfectly, in my opinion.

The only question I have is where is the DVD?",1289001600,,1704,4.375796178343949

7874410,3,6304564759,"There is much to like in this film, many scenes that fascinate and enchant--most notably, a very amusing sequence about an ineffectual Devil whose attempts to claim a soul earn him nothing but jeers.  However, much  about the film is obscure, and this hindered my enjoyment--for example, the  time shifting has no purpose that I could discern.  Most frustratingly, the  film is confusing as to what is happening to the central character--Is he  being led into temptation, or is he the innocent victim of a diabolic  trick?  Several scenes suggest the former, but he has little to do with the  final crisis.--and so the point of the story is unclear.  In brief:  There  is quite enough good about this film to make it worth seeing, but it is not  a satisfying experience.",946857600,2,770,4.742424242424242
