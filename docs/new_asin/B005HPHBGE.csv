8473427,5,B005HPHBGE,"This is a film I saw years ago in the cinema, and loved it . . . and FINALLY it's available on DVD. It's sad, funny, memorable -- it's about missed chances and chance happenings that happen in a moment but then affect an entire life. It's ultimately about redemption and forgiveness. It has a very surreal kind of quality that makes it really interesting filmmaking, and uses music and lipsynching a bit like Dennis Potter's work does. A really unusual film -- I recommend it to people who like really meaty foreign films.",1424822400,,522,4.5638297872340425

8473429,5,B005HPHBGE,"This richly-quirky life story came out about the same time as Delicatessen which slightly overshadowed it at the art cinema. This is less cartoonish, more humane, the story of an aggrieved child who feels he has been swopped at birth with a richer neighbour. And their mutual crush and the tragedy and loss that shapes their lives. And a big final twist. Yet its also playful, parodying noir movies at points, quirky and occasionally just weird. One of a kind.",1375574400,5,460,4.7625
