7930203,5,B000053VF9,"Cool movie about a girl who wants another girl's man and the 'extremes' she goes to get him.  Good movie for high school age girls, or older, to watch for a 'girls night out'.",1240963200,,175,4.147058823529412
7930204,3,B000053VF9,"Don't be mislead by the tag line, this film doesn't feature party all night college students (it's set in the fiftie's for one thing). Jamie Lunar goe's to college like her perfect sister before her so she won't be cut from her fathers will. Once there she falls for roommate Alyssa Milano's boyfriend Brian Bloom (Alyssa herself is on Jamie's blacklist for showing her up in class). Jaime then sets out to win Brian for herself, while making Alyssa's life a misery.  This is a well acted film that fans of the actors will enjoy, everyone else should rent it first .",1017792000,3,566,4.549019607843137
7930205,4,B000053VF9,"this is one of those movies that is so bad that it is good, such as movies like Showgirls and Poison Ivey. It is so cheesy, overly acted, and downright campy. But you got to love it for all these factors. Jamie Lunar is gorgeous and very convinving as new student Sabrina who wants to be the new president of the sorority. Alyssa Milano is the current prez who is not going to let that happen. She knows Sabrina is up to something, especially trying to get into bed with her boyfriend played by Brian Bloom(whatever happened to him). Things get ugly and in the end everyone gets what they wanted and deserved. Very cheesy and entertaining, and if you need a movie to watch that you can just sit back and have fun with, go ahead and get this. You'll love it. Oh did i mention the gorgeous Alyssa Milano is in this. She alone is reason enough to get it.",998352000,3,851,4.2592592592592595
