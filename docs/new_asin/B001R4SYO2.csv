8337320,5,B001R4SYO2,"What can I say... I love this series. Production quality (of the series and the DVD) are good-to-excellent and it stands tall as a well told story of a thirty-something woman learning to love. No matter if you've watched Asian dramas before or not, this series is a worthwhile story and I'll be watching over and over as time goes by.",1313280000,,334,4.491803278688525
