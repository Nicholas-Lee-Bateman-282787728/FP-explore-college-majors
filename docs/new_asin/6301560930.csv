7812980,5,6301560930,"I enjoy Leslie Sansone`s walking videos,I find them easy to follow and motivating,but this is by far one of her best. This is not her basic low impact routine. It is intense high impact jogging. It really gets the heart rate up. Anybody who has done her videos in the past and found them too easy will find this one not easy. Ever since I have began college again in the fall I have been looking for a workout like this that I can squeeze into my schedule and this works. There is 18 minutes of aerobics which is equal to one mile of jogging,which I have found out in college is one of the best fat burners next to walking. Then the last 12 minutes of it is weight lifting section,which you can add as much resistance as you want. The Title says it all I have been to busy to workout and this fits into my schedule. Now there are no exscuses.",1170806400,4,842,4.140243902439025
7812981,5,6301560930,"Conducting two exercise classes means that we use a big variety of Leslie Sansone's tapes. Yes, this is a jogging tape, but after viewing it once I was able to substitute low impact moves in place of the high impact ones Leslie leads you through on the tape. Nothing hard about it. It's great for mixed classes, as beginners and intermediates can follow my easier moves while the more advanced can jog right along with Leslie. Good job Leslie!",1127001600,2,443,4.620253164556962
7812982,4,6301560930,"This was the first Leslie Sansone tape I purchased and I have been a fan of hers ever since.  She seems to respect that most of us do not have a studio for a living room or have a degree in choreography.  The workout moves are simple and can be done in a small amount of space.  It's great for uncoordinated types like myself.  I would've liked to have seen some stretching excercises beforehand and some focus on abs.  Otherwise, it's a great all around workout.  You'll see results if you stick with it and it's a great introduction to a more intense workout routine.  I highly recommend this to anyone that wants to start a running program but hasn't run before.  Also a good intro into some basic weight training.",1020988800,6,717,4.419847328244275
7812983,3,6301560930,"I was a bit disappointed in this tape because it is not a walking tape, it is a jogging tape.  I have knee problems, so in place of it, I do her walk exercises while she is jogging on the tape.  I really thought from the  title it would be different, such as a quick version of her walking, plus  fast firming exercises, etc.  Anyway, she is really the best and if you  like to jog, get this one and enjoy!",922320000,24,406,3.950617283950617
