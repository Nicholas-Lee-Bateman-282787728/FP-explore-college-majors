7994078,4,B00009XN94,"This film continues from where the first film left off.  80% of the film is about the antics that go on at the training academy between the Banshees (women) and the Flying Tigers (men).  Within the women's camp, there is a bit of tension at the beginning between the veterans like Sandra Ng, Kara Hui, and four new recruits.  Practical jokes and fighting ensue.  The men are still as perverted for the women as ever.  And the head instructor of the Flying Tigers is still longing for the head instructor of the Banshees (Sibelle Hu).  It's only in the last 15 or 20 minutes of the film that the two groups put their skills to the test against some terrorist bad guys.
The comedy in this film was top notch.  I thought it was even funnier than the first movie.  Lots of great gags and jokes.  The downside was the action.  The first film had great fight scenes, led by Cynthia Rothrock.  Plus, the actors/actresses did most of their fighting.  Unfortunately, in this film, they are extensively doubled.  Also, the little rematch they have where they don the fighting gi's and go for a 2 out 3 fighting tournament, doesn't have the same excitment as the first film's.  What's really bizarre is that they are wearing gi's that say Tai Kwon Do on the back, but they are using anything but.  Plus, they seem to use the worst on screen martial artists, so I was disappointed that Ken Lo (legs guy at the end of Drunken Master II) or Kara Hui (title character from My Young Auntie) don't get to mix it up.  Thumbs down for the martial arts, which is why I deducted 1 star.
So if you're looking for a movie with great comedy and supplemental fight scenes, then this movie is for you.",1061683200,,1675,4.42483660130719
