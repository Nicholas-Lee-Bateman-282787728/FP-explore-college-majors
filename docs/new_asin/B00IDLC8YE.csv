8641289,5,B00IDLC8YE,"The digitally remastered Jungle Book on Blu-ray is incredible and has to be seen by fans of this movie. The audio is spectacular as well. Both bring this movie back to life and make it worth watching again. The lunchbox in the gift set is extremely small, about the size of a DVD case. Great item though and great gift for fans of the movie.",1412294400,,341,4.2615384615384615
