4443897,5,B004P5DP1M,"I am in pretty good shape and have been doing the Jillian Michaels dvd's, but this was a real challenge and I broke a bit of a sweat!  The arm segment, core segment, and leg segment are super tough if you have not done any sort of barre 3 before and I can definately say that I felt taller after doing this workout.  It is so fun and it goes by really fast so I look forward to purchasing the monthly membership and continuing on with this barre 3 journey I am on.  Worth the money you pay for it!",1354579200,4,497,3.95
4443898,5,B004P5DP1M,"I absolutely love this workout by Barre3 owner/founder Sadie Lincoln.  It is a 40 min (perfect time frame in my opinion for a barre/toning workout) That hits the entire body from legs, seat, arms and abs with nice stretched too. Sadie's presence is perfect-being calm, giving great verbal form pointers and this workouts goes by quickly. I can really feel it working too. I used 3lb weights for the arm section and it was perfect. I wish she would put out a new DVD, but she has opted for streaming workouts by subscription on her website. I would be happy if she put a 10 min, 20 min, 40 min and a 60 min streaming routine onto a DVD for home use.",1336608000,9,648,4.311475409836065
4443899,5,B004P5DP1M,"Ever since I discovered this workout from the now defunct Exercise TV on demand, I loved it. Since this is no longer available on Amazon, I purchased directly from the Barre3 website. (I should note that their shipping was super speedy, arriving in 2 days!) Sadie Lincoln delivers the workout at a very easy and deliberate pace. Her instruction is clear and her cues are spot on. Those who are accustomed to more fast paced workouts may find this down right slow. However, killer cardio and targeting large muscles are not the intent of this workout; micro movements are used to target the smaller muscle groups and tone. The lower body segment is the ""most intense,"" followed by a short but non-stop arm segment. The last segment for abs/core is the hidden gem, and makes this a ""must have"" even for those who don't like any other part of this DVD. Using a mini fitness ball (which comes with the DVD if you order from their website), Sadie goes through a series of exercises that are challenging but fun. The ball helps with lower back issues, and I must say that this is the only set of ab/core exercises that I actually enjoy. She also goes through some bridge exercises to work the glutes. This is certainly not the most challenging, nor the most intense, Barre workout available. I find this to be a fantastic workout for those days where I need something less intense.",1328140800,14,1375,4.616326530612245
4443900,5,B004P5DP1M,"I did Sadie Lincoln's Barre 3 workout on Exercise TV and tried to buy it on Amazon (not available right now).  It is a fantastic abdominal and glute workout that, like Pilates, seems deceptively simple when you're just watching, but is effective and tough when done with proper technique.  It flattens the abs and lifts and rounds the rear!  This is worth the cost to add to your DVD workout library.",1322784000,5,400,4.605633802816901
4443901,2,B004P5DP1M,"I have been doing this workout using Exercise TV, on Comcast On Demand. It will expire in a few days, so I went on here to see about purchasing it.  As always, I check around online to make sure I am getting the best deal.

It turns out that Amazon is charging the same price for this DVD that the main website is charging, except for one big difference.  If you buy it directly from the Barre3 website ([...]), the DVD comes WITH the Fitball.  If you buy it on here, there is no ball included.",1310601600,78,494,4.114583333333333
4443902,5,B004P5DP1M,"I have just been starting to get into a few barre workouts and was interested to try this one, as it seems to be very well-received. I had heard it was a little bit on the easier side, but after doing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tracey-Mallett-The-Booty-Barre-Total-New-Body/dp/B0046BAAUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tracey Mallett-The Booty Barre-Total New Body</a>&nbsp;(ouch!), I didn't mind that at all.

Instructor Sadie Lincoln teaches live on a bright set that is typical of ExerciseTV; the music is upbeat and mostly unremarkable. She uses a chair (for the barre work), light weights, and a small Pilates-type ball for this workout. (I used a ball that I purchased here on Amazon,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/9-Body-Back-Ball-Pump/dp/B00374O8JK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">9"" Body Back Ball & Pump</a>.)  Sadie begins the 5-minute warm-up in a wide plie position, slowly performing plies and gentle stretches here and then concluding the warm-up with a series of stretches targeting the hip flexors, hamstrings, and neck.

Now Sadie states that you are ready for the leg work. The first sequence includes work in a wide leg plie position (coming up to the toes), a split leg lunge (also optional on the toes), and dips with the feet parallel; this series ends with a brief thigh stretch. The second series focuses on the back body. Starting in a slightly bent over position, Sadie raises one leg back on a diagonal for small pulses, eventually changing to a bent leg lift with the option of raising to the toes on the support leg. Following this, Sadie brings you to seated on the chair for a hip stretch, and that's it--you are done with legs (about 10 minutes total).

Sadie remains in front of the chair and picks up light weights (she uses 2 lbs.) for about 4 minutes of arms work. The arms series begins with a rear delt raise that adds in a hover squat a small pulses. Next comes a standing chest fly, also with the hover squat. Sadie returns to shoulder work with small overhead presses, then reverses direction for pulls. Keeping the elbows up, she performs rear delt presses, and she finishes with small tricep presses. Although the arms work felt somewhat easy, I think that the small movements and relatively fast pace would make it difficult to go much higher in the weights (I used 3 lbs.); instead, I did this segment twice.

For the next section of the workout, Sadie goes down to the mat for pelvic tilts (also called back dancing). Here she uses the ball in three positions: between her knees, between her ankles, and under her feet. This 4.5 minute section provides a bit more work for the legs before moving on to the core work.

The core segment is the most challenging section of this workout; including the plank work at the end, it is about 10.5 minutes long and would make a great mini-workout on its own. Sadie begins here with the ball placed under her tailbone. She starts slowly lowering one straight leg at a time towards the floor, transitioning to a scissors move and then more of a bicycle pattern. For the next series, she sits up with a straight spine, the ball placed behind the back. From this position, she flexes back (using the ball for support) and then comes forward, adding side twists and a back reach to this move. Keeping the ball in the same place, the final move with the ball is more of a back extension, rolling down over the ball and the back up (similar to a Pilates roll-up). The last exercise to work the core is an elbow plank (option to do on the knees) which Sadie holds for a decent amount of time.

The workout concludes with an approximately 5-minute stretch segment. Sadie begins in child's pose, twisting to both sides, then comes to the knees for a mild upper back backbend. Additional stretches include wide lunge and one-legged seated forward bend (adding a twist), with Sadie concluding the workout standing. The total workout time is about 39 minutes.

I really enjoyed this workout! The barre work was tougher than I had expected--it is quite short, so it goes by quickly, but the moves themselves are definitely not easy. And I absolutely LOVED the core segment; Sadie does an amazing job of targeting this area without putting any strain at all on the lower back, thanks to the addition of the ball. I will definitely be using this DVD frequently in the future.",1299369600,77,4430,4.960916442048518
8437476,5,B004P5DP1M,"I have moderate arthritis of the hip and sometimes have difficulty walking and doing deep squats and lunges. I can do all the moves in this workout with very little pain. Some of the floor exercises are similar to my physical therapy exercises, so I don't have to stop the video to incorporate my therapy routine. I also like that the instructor stretches after working each muscle group.",1527984000,,388,4.720588235294118

8437479,2,B004P5DP1M,"I started Barre Workouts 10 months ago because I wanted to lean out my thighs. My legs were strong and muscular from years of Beachbody DVD programs like 21 Day Fix Extreme, Master's Hammer & Chisel, 22 Hard Core, P90 & Body Beast. I started with Pure Barre DVDs and got amazing results and found the workouts to be VERY challenging. When I heard Sadie on a Sirius XM radio talk about her Barre 3 I was interested in a change from Pure Barre so I ordered it and gave it a try. I thought maybe this DVD was just weak so I tried her other DVD's: Standing Slim, Ballet Fit, Studio Shape, Ballet Boot Camp and Burner.

I have concluded that all of these Barre 3 workouts are for beginners who are not in shape and want a light workout. Each DVD had a few challenging spots but I never finished feeling like I had completed a great workout. I actually added another workout on afterwards to rework muscles that never really engaged for very long.

My heart rate never got up or when it did, it did not stay up for very long. The movements did not exhaust the muscles they were working.

The best part of the workouts was using the ball under the lower back for ab work. This is a brilliant idea to take the pressure off the lower back and really engage the abs. Other than that I felt like the workouts were not challenging.

I am going back to Pure Barre. The intensity is much higher, more effective and Pure Barre's motto of "" LIFT TONE BURN"" is true and never disappoints. Pure Barre will make a cross-fitter sweat but this one does not even come remotely close to sweating.",1466035200,8,1573,4.286195286195286

8437485,5,B004P5DP1M,"I have been a fan of this dvd for awhile now, and worked out to it during the 1st and 2nd trimesters of my pregnancy.  I feel this dvd helped me get my abs back FAST after having a c-section only 3 months ago...  Sadie is amazing as an instructor; her cueing is so good!.  One of my favorite things about this dvd is she doesn't waste time during the intro, the workout starts within the first couple of minutes. The workout flows nicely, and you never feel lost or confused.  I love the ab and butt segment!  I personally know it's not easy bouncing back from a c-section, and kind of scary too.  It took ten weeks for me to recover before my doctor would clear me for exercise, and this dvd was the only workout I felt comfortable with doing.  Sadie knows the body so well, and knows how to realign everything.  If you're, like me, looking for a workout to get your abs back after major ab surgery, this is it!  I recommend this dvd to every mom I know!",1358208000,18,955,4.174863387978142
