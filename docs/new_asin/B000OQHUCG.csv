8516125,5,B000OQHUCG,"I love Kari Anderson's  choreography, and this video. It's for experienced fitness individuals, supposingly instructors. It's has a lot of turns, twists and spins. there are many great moves videos, and unfortunatly the sellers don't specify which video it is, but if you can dig a little you may find a number to differentiate which is which. I received the item relatively promptly through amazon.
  Good luck,
