Initially my disappointment in this DVD led me to give it one star and a very poor review but I have just compared it to two other DVDs I have of the same title I must say it is far and away the best transfer. That is not to say it is by any means good, it simply isn't all that bad. Of course the 1.33 picture on this DVD is a travesty of the original 2.35 image but at least it does have consistantly decent color. The movie itself is fun and I live in hope that one day it will show up in a nice widescreen transfer, which realistically will probably never happen. Until then, this will have to do.",1360972800,,679,3.9635036496350367
