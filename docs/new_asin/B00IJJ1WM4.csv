Oscar Wegner has a wonderful teaching philosophy.  The pairing with Brad Holbrook was pure genius.  I wish that he would have included something about Guga and more about Pancho Gonzales.  This collection is a great instructional aid and a great snapshot of tennis history with the stroke analyses  It is as if Brad Holbrook got some expensive lessons and let you tag along.
