8551530,5,B00AH2Q5OG,Braco is amazing. I watch all the free livestream gazings and have purchased most of his DVDs. I was very happy with this product.,1442016000,,130,4.458333333333333
8551531,5,B00AH2Q5OG,"Several times, I have had the good fortune of being in the presence of Braco. This video is a treasure, it is my favorite of those I've watched.",1437782400,,144,4.178571428571429
8551532,5,B00AH2Q5OG,"The part I really love is the special features ""the voice"" of Braco, my arms were buzzing from hearing it.",1417392000,2,106,4.35
8551533,5,B00AH2Q5OG,I am extremely happy with the DVD.  I wasn't sure how long before the order went in and the arrival of the DVD would  be.  I was happy when it finally arrived in excellent condition and highly recommended for anyone on their own path of healing.,1413849600,2,245,4.282608695652174
8551534,5,B00AH2Q5OG,There is healing energy in this DVD.  Watching Braco live-streaming is more powerful but this is nice to have when there's no live-streaming.,1408060800,3,141,5.130434782608695
8551535,5,B00AH2Q5OG,"This is one of my favorite DVD's from Braco.  At the end of the video there is a Special Feature section which includes ""The Voice"".  Playing that section is the closest thing you get to having a mini session with Braco in the privacy of your own home - when ever you feel the desire to connect. The segment may be broken up with a little bit with people being interviewed - but it's well worth owning and using.

In Europe people travel hundreds if not thousands of miles to visit his center in Zagreb, Croatia just to listen to ""The Voice"" when he is traveling else wheres around the globe.  Thanks to Jane Sibbett co-producing this DVD (plus many others) and adding the special feature we can listen to ""The Voice"" in the privacy of our own homes.",1402963200,4,750,4.374100719424461
8551536,2,B00AH2Q5OG,"I love Braco. This DVD is extremely similar to a Braco promotional video. Mostly testimonials, that could be used at the beginning of his gazing sessions, that cost less than the DVD. The information about how Braco got his healing powers is very scant. No metaphysical infromtions or even sources of the many books he read. No information about how Braco experiences giving the gaze. Is he a walk in? or just a real good channler? There is no information here I can use for self healing or personal evolution.",1358812800,6,510,4.677777777777778
