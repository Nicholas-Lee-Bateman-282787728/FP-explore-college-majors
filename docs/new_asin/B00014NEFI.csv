1970305,5,B00014NEFI,"This film looks like a high-budget film-not low-budget independent film.  The characters are very believable and the story strikes a nerve with me and many of my gay male friends.  I think we have all met people like the folks in this film.  We often ARE the people in this film, although we may not want to admit it.  I guess the most important thing to consider when buying a film is whether or not it is entertaining enough to keep on the shelf.  ""All The Rage"" is definitely a good time and will also stimulate some great conversation.  I'm glad I own it.  It's a keeper.",1076198400,9,575,4.317757009345795
1970306,4,B00014NEFI,"This is a ""cute"" and entertaining film. It has a wide range of gay characters making it easy to find at least one character with whom one can identify. It has a decent plot although I found the ""Psycho"" ending abrupt and unsatisfying. I think Chris was ready to settle down, and Stu was the right guy to settle him.  Stu should have given him a second chance. My first-hand knowledge of things gay is pretty limited, but I think this film did an excellent job of portraying the ""lifestyle""--its pros as well as its cons.",1076025600,8,520,4.416666666666667
1970307,5,B00014NEFI,"I bought this DVD on the advice of friends, and it was incredible.  Very funny and a very accurate look at gay life in the big city, from the gyms and bars to the dinner parties and first dates. I could recognize so many of my friends in the characters of this film, and I really got caught up in seeing how their lives would turn out. Plus, there are some gorgeous guys in the film, and there are a lot of freeze-worthy shots of them.",1074384000,32,435,4.058139534883721
1970308,1,B00014NEFI,"All in all, a low budget production with weak acting.  I remember having such hopes for this film when it premiered and spent my time in the theater trying not to laugh at the dramatic moments.  Even today, my partner and I dissolve into uncontrollable giggles by quoting the classic line at the climax of the film:
""I'm the awesome one; you're the loser!""
Rent this somewhere if you're curious, but spend your money on something else worthy of having in your gay dvd library.",1074124800,5,476,4.588235294117647
1970309,4,B00014NEFI,"Long before that was Queer as Folk there was All The Rage. Director/Writer/Producer Roland Tec's first effort is a humerious look into being gay in the 90's. The film is funny, well written, and looks very slick for a modest budget independent flick.
If you gay, gay curious or questioning you have see All The Rage.
The special Directors cut available on the DVD also includes a brilliant round table with average gay men.",1073001600,3,423,4.72972972972973
1970310,3,B00014NEFI,"All the Rage"" focuses on the behavior of a successful gay Boston lawyer, while displaying a range of hook-ups, dates, and relationships, primarily in the gay community.  Christopher Bedford, a trust and estate expert (played by John-Michael Lander), is a cute, buff Don Juan with a box of phone numbers from all the tricks who get no second opportunity.  Christopher has a number of confidantes, including co-worker Larry (played by Jay Corcoran), real estate agent Dave (played by Paul Outlaw), Dave's wealthy lover, Tom (played by Peter Bubriski), and straight real estate agent Susan (played by Merle Perkins).  The movie's action is triggered by matchmaking Tom arranging for Christopher to meet unbuff, rebounding book editor Stewart (played by David Vincent) at a dinner party.
The group has a certain wonderment when Christopher and Stewart hit it off for a few months.  Still Stewart keeps living with a handsome gym bunny quite attractive to Christopher.  Eventually this leads to trouble.  Almost immediately, Christopher takes home a back-room trick, John (played by Jeff Miller), and gets a surprise when the trick has an additional agenda, forcing Christopher to face his past behavior.  After the climax, both Christopher and John are shaken.
Playing this (as a tape) has been a guilty pleasure.  The dialogue gathers together most of the nasty, insensitive things ones hears (and maybe says) in the course of cruising and tricking.  The main character is in the center of this, but the other characters know the story too and play along with each other's illusions.  There is no easy way out.  The gay couple has communications problems and uses a wacko therapist.  The straight woman gets a series of hopeless dates (and also uses the therapist).  Christopher gets to absorb the audience's frustrations with unproductive tricking with hunks.  There are many skin scenes with many attractive characters.  There are several beautiful outdoor scenes in Boston, a favorite city of mine.
The movie intercuts several short scenes showing a shirtless Christopher curled up in a chair, speaking his real thoughts.  The scenes are shot in black & white as a contrast to the rest of the movie.  This technique works well, although his chatter on the ideal body grows tiresome.
In general the acting is average, though several supporting characters and cameos were more impressive.  I especially liked Jeff Miller's and Paul Outlaw's performances.  For me the biggest dissonance was the performance of the lead.  Christopher's lines and monologues suggest a vesting in his transaction-driven character.  The actor usually delivered the lines in an ironic manner, with a laugh hidden behind the smile, suggesting the character's non-existent inner awareness of the difference between his behavior and his real self.  At the end there was room to wonder if he had a revelation or was annoyed at the ripping off of his mask.
The DVD version is all right with acceptable extras.  There is a commentary by director Roland Tec and actor Paul Outlaw.  There is a twenty-minute group discussion on ""Men, Dating, and Sex"".
This is a useful movie.  The gay community does not look often at the ethics and manners one member should offer another.  This movie asks a lot of the questions, although it doesn't really deliver the answers.",1072915200,26,3329,5.118518518518519

1970333,3,B00014NEFI,"I recently (February 2014) watched this film.  Although some aspects of the film clearly demonstrate the culture that was the 1990s, it's sad to think that there are still so many things that are true about gay culture.  Consider, for example, the gym crazed culture that continues to exist.  While other things seem to simply be a part of the human condition (e.g., fear of commitment, etc.).  Still a good watch when looking to have some intellectual discussion about dynamics, the human condition, and gay culture through the years...",1391817600,,537,5.0

1970338,1,B00014NEFI,Story line is weak; the acting similar. The steamy scenes were only lukewarm.  The movie felt much longer than it actually was.,1387152000,,127,4.7727272727272725

1970342,5,B00014NEFI,Very entertaining and very sad ending.  I enjoyed the beautiful body of Chris Lander.  He was perfect on the outside but not so much on the inside.  I thought his friends needed to turn away and not support his behavior.,1380412800,,220,4.45
1970343,4,B00014NEFI,"Calling this movie a ""satire"" is really putting it politely.  Sadly, it is actually a very spot on depiction of many of the urban gay men I have seen in action during my 40 years as a member of the LGBT community.  Let's be honest, who among us has not seen or been rejected by some guy who's too in love with himself to truly see the outstanding qualities in someone less attractive than himself. There are indeed many gay gym bunnies who seek out or measure the value of other gay men in terms age, endowment, muscle to fat ratio, body hair or lack of, facial characteristics, or socioeconomic status. In their quest for perfection or whatever specific attribute that turns them on, they fail to see how life is passing them by. When they blink an eye and turn 50, they often realize in retrospect how many wonderful chances they threw away for love and companionship in life.

Despite some atrociously poor acting which only redeems itself in an impressively compelling final scene, this movie carries a real spot on message for all gay men.  It is a bona fide wake-up call for all those who are letting life pass them by as they look for something they may NEVER find. We watched it on Amazon Instant Video then quickly purchased a copy for our film library.",1377907200,,1262,4.497816593886463
1970344,2,B00014NEFI,"Fairly tedious and lacks cohesion.  Moral of story acceptable, but done in a overly repetitive manner.  Probably not worth the time.",1376006400,,132,5.238095238095238
1970345,2,B00014NEFI,"I did not like this movie. The led guy is suppose to be an attractive guy that has the looks, job and money that most people would want. I may be the odd man out but I did not see him that way at all. This is a low budget film that really speaks to a nitch in the community.",1375747200,,274,3.5833333333333335
1970346,4,B00014NEFI,"No matter what the orientation for an intimate relationship, we humans frequently suffer terrible anxiety in building those social connections that make us who we are and would like to be.  (Woody Allen made a career out of surveying such anguish-ridden relationships!)  It is, in large measure, a legacy from the way in which we were raised; we are a very nervous society that really needs to chill.  ""All the Rage"" explores the anguish of a young man who apparently has it all, and yet realizes he is but an empty shell--that something must be missing that would make him happy. The film is well done and expresses those emotions common to many, many of us when we try to find someone we can love and who will return that love, regardless of gender or orientation.",1372204800,,766,4.617647058823529
1970347,3,B00014NEFI,"This is supposed to be a satire.
It is a statement of reality.
Nobody treats ""gays"" any worse than ""gays!""
All the harsh realities of this movie have been going on since the dawn of time.
While it has been 40 years ago for me, imagine seeing the mirror look back at me and see that things have not changed one bit!
Here's some reality to gnaw on - ALL the guys that were part of my ""fun and games"" in D.C. In the 70's -
R.I.P. - so sad.
It was edifying to hear the word condom used within this story.
It is really well done but was given 3 stars because it is far from being the comedy as per the website.",1370044800,,605,3.8870967741935485
1970348,4,B00014NEFI,"I thought the acting was a bit flat. The crazy guy at the end and the love interest Stewart were the best actors. The plot was well thought and frankly, true to life. Gay guys may date 1 or 2 points below there own league but no more. A 10 guy, Chris, falls for a 6 or 7 guy Stewart, in the end Chris makes a mistake, a bad one.

There is one spoiler from me; no happy ending, but it wasn't tragic either.

What is it with queer films and sad endings? Where's the happy? I do get tired of that. Haven't we evolved from the ""Boys in the Band""?

Keeping in mind this is an indie film, i gave it 4 stars for plot and the realistic reality of gay dating.",1369785600,,650,3.8721804511278197

1970361,3,B00014NEFI,I should have rated it when I first viewed it.  Now it's a distant memory.  Evidently it did not leave an everlasting memory.,1365552000,,125,4.391304347826087
1970362,3,B00014NEFI,Narcissistic - I actually enjoyed this film. I can relate to this picture because I've seen the same behavior in both straight and gay friends. The lead I liked to a degree. Narcissistic in some many ways you have to worry who he really is hurting when his world crashes down on him. Learning a lesson the hard way,1360454400,,314,4.338983050847458
1970363,2,B00014NEFI,"I must have rented this a while back but I don't even remember the movie so I really can't review it.  However, I do like renting and reviewing gay themed movies but this one doesn't ring a bell.  Sorry",1359331200,,202,4.153846153846154

1970365,1,B00014NEFI,I suppose when this first was released it may have had some artistic value; however it clearly has not stood any test of time.  The acting was worse than many porn films and the plot downright sophomoric.  Fortunately I was watching it on Prime so I could cut my losses quickly and not feel I need to plod through the entire film.  I suggest any other viewer do the same.,1355097600,,371,4.271428571428571
1970366,2,B00014NEFI,"This is a special kind of movie:  amateur, badly acted, poorly written BUT a real period piece and, if you can stand how bad it is as a film, and enjoy it for the camp that it actually is, enjoy!",1353196800,,195,3.875
1970367,1,B00014NEFI,I got ten minutes in and it was just too asinine to watch any more. The characters are unbelievable and unrelatable. A couple of queers can't talk about open relationships like adults? Someone with infantile attitudes toward sex wrote this. I would give it zero stars if I could.,1338249600,,279,4.714285714285714
1970368,1,B00014NEFI,"Kevin Thomas of the L.A. Times raves: ""One of the sharpest, sexiest, most amusing satires of gay life ever filmed."" Indeed! He seems a master of concision and verbal restraint! What rubbish!

If you've ever seen a 60s porno flick, you remember the dull, bitchy, wooden characters who rattled on about who they met, who they lost and who they yearned to find in a ""forever"" relationship. At least some of the sex might have been juicy... Here the main character is not much to look at - average, queeny, and too stupid to play a lawyer. None of the characters - with the exception of the hottie that starred in Highlander - or actors is interesting, likeable or talented. Even the flimsy Brokeback Mountain is better than this, and its heart is is the right place. This film goes back half a century in its attitudes and portrayals of gay men: shallow, oversexed and intellectually deprived. This is the kind of garbage we can expect from the bigot-morons of the ""Tea Party"".  Gay men are the equals of anyone else, and often far superior. This putrid film is an appalling betrayal, without charm, wit or integrity: the unfocused ravings of a self-hating gay man. Not a satire, just a shallow, boring failure!",1336780800,2,1208,4.666666666666667

My god...these nice looking but empty creatures in this production could not make it in the world of commercials from what they've shown in this film.  Save your time and pass on this one, and certainly do not BUY this piece of junk for you'll hate yourself for years to come if you do.

1970372,1,B00014NEFI,"There could have been more about each character, and then they meet, but the characters surrounding the main character were not given a chance to develop or be supporting actors.

1970373,1,B00014NEFI,"All previous reviews with 1 and 2 stars are very accurate. The film is one big cliche about gay life and gay people in general. The acting is nothing. Dialogues are boring and not funny at all.
It makes me angry to watch again a movie where almost all gay characters are presented as real camps. They are banal and dull, speaking with this annoying manner.
I give one star only for the actor who potrayed Stewart.
Don't waste your money on that one.",1276041600,3,449,4.357142857142857
1970374,4,B00014NEFI,"I'm surprised by all the poor reviews. I saw this film when it was first released in Boston, and it still resonates for me, especially in the ""remember me"" final sequence. Why are reviewers complaining about this scene and wanting the 2 leads to get back together and have a happy ending?  The whole point of the film is that the body fascism in the community has a sadistic rage burning beneath it that is beautifully self-destructive. In the final sequence, when Christopher turns the tables on his trick and reminds him that ""I (expletive deleted) you"" the viewer gets to see that what really matters to these characters is who is on top - who is the most buff, the most beautiful, the most wealthy, the most well hung.
The title is pure genius because it reminds us that while it is ""all the rage"" in the idiomatic sense to be an adonis, the obsession with beauty is often masking all the rage that boils beneath this beautiful skin, and everybody is ugly on the inside.
The acting is amateur, especially the female friend who was obviously cast as a favor or something.  Everytime she spoke, the audience cracked up for all the wrong reasons, so wooden that I remember her almost a decade later.  The script is so clever though. It doesn't really read as a parody so much as an exploratory expose, because although the film purports to critigue Christopher, the viewer still envies him and in the end, falls into the very trap that the film ostensibly wants us to question.
If the film asks us whether it is more important to be happy, well-adjusted and in love or to be beautiful, desired and envied, I would say it leans towards the latter. Men who look like Christopher will always be on top, and as much as we can pretend to find their behavior abhorrent, physical beauty always trumps personal uglyness in cinema and in life.",1212537600,7,1835,4.554545454545455
1970375,1,B00014NEFI,"I've been burned so I've learned: don't buy indie gay movies - rent them.

This movie, aside from being the reason I lost 2 hours of my life, is a mess.  The characters are tired cliches and are poorly portrayed by an amateur cast.  As one other review noted, the only 'attractive' guy in the whole cast was the one who was supposed to be the ugly guy the 'hot' one settled for .. add in a truly messy ending that comes from nowhere and adds nothing and you've got a total waste of 104 minutes.

Have the directors never SEEN a romantic comedy?  Regurgitating tired stereotypes and cliches on a low budget is something we can all do at any given gay bar on any night of the week.. save the celluloid for things worth seeing more than once.",1149292800,7,739,4.25
1970376,2,B00014NEFI,"I wanted to like this movie.  I ordered the DVD hoping it was a controversial satire on the superficiality of the gay ghetto, as promised.  What I got was a mildly amusing comedy, with nowhere near as much punch as I expected from the premise.

There were problems immediately.  Although he has a perfect body, John-Michael Lander as Christopher portrays a character so unlikable, it's not possible to warm to him at all, let alone develop an interest in what happens to him as the plot progresses.  Some may find him irresistibly attractive, but frankly I wouldn't have given him a second glance no matter how much he masked what a creep he is - perfect abs and all.  A bigger problem to me was the character played by David Vincent.  The film's premise - the brunt of the ""hard-hitting satire"" - is the fact that Christopher's boyfriend is supposed to be the opposite of what we've been ""conditioned"" to find attractive because (gasp!) he doesn't work out in a gym and actually has love handles (horrors!).  He also doesn't have a glamorous job (I mean, really, who knows any gay men like that?) and - now here's the most shocking thing I could imagine in a satire on gay values - he sleeps in PAJAMAS!  Now I know a few guys in Chelsea who might find this impossible to believe, but despite the love handles and the pajamas, the ""out-of-shape, chunky, under-employed geek"" turns out to be the most attractive man in the whole film.  Somehow I think that some of the people this film was intended for won't quite get that.

I liked what this picture was trying to say - Christopher is shallow, superficial, vain and annoying, and more or less gets what he deserves in the end.  It's not his promiscuity that bothers us, but the way he treats his conquests, refusing to ever have a second date, and finding the most ridiculous faults imaginable in each potential suitor.  But the telling of the tale just isn't very interesting, or very funny, and if they really wanted to make it a satire, it should have been far more merciless to maintain my interest.

Maybe I'm just old enough to remember when gay men didn't spend all their time in a gym, staring at the mirror to confirm their own beauty.  I seem to recall that when I first came out in the early 70's, gym bunnies were few and far between in the gay male community.  In those days, you were either skinny, fat or average, and if people judged you by your looks, it was solely on the basis of whether or not you had a pretty face.  The main things we used back then to attract people were wit, charm, personality and intelligence, along with keeping ourselves reasonably well groomed.  Now all I hear and see everywhere is stats, stats and more stats - numbers for waists, chests, arms, and thighs, together with demands that everyone have a perfect body, perfect clothes and a perfect career, or forget it.  I was hoping that this film might raise some serious objections to such values, but when the final credits were rolling I felt I hadn't really seen or heard very much to either provoke meaningful discussion or challenge these attitudes, which is what I expect a good satire to do.  Some may find it quite enjoyable, and feel it delivers on its promises, but I was less than satisfied when it was over.",1136160000,33,3268,4.525510204081633
1970377,2,B00014NEFI,"This movie reminded me of the series QAF, with characters that you love to hate. Some of the things they have in common:

Stereotypical gay characters, lead egocentric characters, over the top drama, and typical bar behavior.

In addition this movie adds overbearing gawd-awful music and unrealistic camp in almost every scene.

Why did I give it 2 stars? Even though I thought the confrontational ending was a bit over the top, I liked it. The message got through to the audience. I did ask myself, however, why the confronting person felt that he was morally superior when he himself was still lurking in the bar's dark corners.

Denial of reality all around here but still worth 2 stars for providing us with *some* hope.",1131926400,4,724,4.768

The story of a motivated, good looking, successful, professional gay man who is looking for perfection in others. It is a fairly factual depiction of one type of gay man that may be found in most cities. The acting was good and the story kept my attention. The production quality was good as was the audio quality. The film was enjoyable for the humor and it had some heavy scenes filled with lifes drama. It had a fair amount of semi-nudity however was rather mild sexually speaking. This is not a feel good movie nor will it be considered sensual however it is worth renting first, to see if you like it enough to add to your collection.

8006309,3,B00014NEFI,"This is an often-witty and sophisticated look at the superficiality that can be at the heart of some men's gay experience.  While the characters are not particularly likable, the story itself is rather compelling but also quite sad.",1413417600,,232,5.105263157894737
8006310,2,B00014NEFI,"As much as I wanted to watch it, especially since its set in Boston...couldnt do it.  I shut it off after about 25 mins...just painful.",1401840000,,135,4.4
8006311,3,B00014NEFI,"I was a bit surprised to discover this film was set in the 90's. It seemed more like the 70's to me. The portrayal of professional gay men in Boston probably says as much about the socio-economic times as it does about gay life... the notion of entitlement and sex as power. Our main character falls in love with a soulful unaffected man and breaches the trust between them with a liaison outside their relationship. His inability to commit or to move beyond serial liaisons leaves him lonely at the end of the film. It's an interesting portrait, but don't expect to see modern life.",1395964800,,583,4.561904761904762
