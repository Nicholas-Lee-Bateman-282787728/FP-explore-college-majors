Great visual quality, though the version I saw had letterboxing to fit the screen.",1442707200,,255,4.688888888888889
1172695,3,9089707298,"I have a fireplace dvd and an ocean dvd, but wanted one that combined both.  The other dvds I have feature one continuous shot that loops repeatedly, and I like that.  This dvd is feature two separate films - one is 38 minutes and the other is 39 minutes.  Neither are one continuous shot, but a series of shots at various stages of sunset and dying fire.  Minus one star for that.  The other star was subtracted because the length of the films don't sync up to the sleep timer on my tv.  My tv's sleep timer (and I assume most tvs are like this) are 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes.  Not sure what else the manufacturer had in mind as a use for this dvd.",1437177600,,662,4.046153846153846

1172702,5,9089707298,"Very soothing, crackling of the bonfires with sunrises and sunsets -- NO other (birds) sounds!  I like to go to sleep with this on the TV!",1422748800,,138,4.3076923076923075
1172703,5,9089707298,I just watched this DVD a little while ago and I am still in a relaxed state. The combination of the crackling sound of the campfire with the gentle waves coming up on the beach takes any stress you might have and removes it. The colors of the sky - soft pinks and orange - it's just peaceful and restful. It goes all the way through the sunset over the ocean to total blackness with just the fire left. A crackling fire is especially helpful in when you're in the grip of a  bitter winter - it almost makes you feel WARM! I'm very glad I have this DVD and I know I'll be watching it often!,1393459200,,590,4.042735042735043
1172704,5,9089707298,At a Christmas party our host had a yule log DVD playing throughout and it added atmosphere on what would otherwise have been a blank TV screen.  I went further with the Fireplace DVD with sound.  The music is very subtle and non intrusive.  Best of all the DVD is All Region so that I can send it as a gift to my friends around the world.,1387843200,,339,4.029850746268656
1172705,4,9089707298,"This is my favourite relaxing DVD-  such a great idea to combine fire with the ocean at sunset. The slow crashing waves and the crackle of the wood in the fire are such relaxing sounds. The colours of the sunsets are just amazing. I quite often put on a relaxing DVD in the background (I also have the fire and rain DVDS by this company) but between the sun setting, the waves and the fire I prefer to give this one my full attention and just lay back and watch. The only reason I've given it four stars instead of five is that on the main menu there is an option to play all, and then there are 2 scenes to choose from- but there are some different camera angles and at the end a fire in the darkness, once the sun has set- I would like to be able to choose each scene to view in case I would like to leave it on repeat. A pretty minor quibble really, I'd make this 4.5 stars if I could :) I'd also quite like to see one with a large bonfire- maybe there will be a part two!",1386115200,,975,3.9242424242424243
7901343,5,9089707298,"I absolutely love this dvd. The films are beautiful and it's really nice to watch the sunset turn into night. Both films are about the same length, though fire 2, as I call it, is roughly a minute longer. Should probably be 4 1/2 stars, since the fire audio needs to be a touch louder to be heard over the waves, but that's not really that big a deal. Also, the waves visually don't sync up with the audio 100% of the time, which is also not that big of a deal, since the effect is still the same.

What I also rather like about both films is that once it turns to night, the camera somewhat closes up on the fire, which looks really nice~

I'm including two pictures of the dvd running on my 2005 Venturer portable dvd player (one of which has a pen for screen size reference) and a screencap I took of my favorite scene from fire 2, which was playing on my computer.

All in all I am super happy with this dvd and it only makes me want to buy more titles. *lol*",1481673600,,963,4.057894736842106
7901344,4,9089707298,"This is for you if you like to watch a fire in a fireplace.  There are three different bonfires that you watch burn down to hot coals with the backdrop of gorgeous sunsets and the sound of gentle waves.  I wish I could have seen more scenery rather than the silhouette of distant islands, but evening is the time for bonfires...",1481328000,,328,4.360655737704918
