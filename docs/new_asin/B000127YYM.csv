1966474,5,B000127YYM,"This movie strikes a deep emotional chord... two sisters, both very different, one an artist who follows her heart, which at times seems a bit impetuous, the other a reserved and proper wife and mother seeking seemingly unselfishly to maintain her status quo.  The movie takes you deftly into their positions in life, and though you may have a favorite of the two by the end, it is surely not for lack of understanding the entirety of each character.  Love and betrayal, candor and lies.  Each loving the same man, for different reasons and purposes.  It is an amazing journey that will take you through the spectrum of each emotion - longing, hope, despair, love, angst, pride, freedom, ultimate loss and again, hope.  I highly recommend this movie.
If you enjoy the dynamics of this movie, you may also enjoy Possession, in which Jennifer Ehle and Jeremy Northam shine.",1078012800,24,871,4.818791946308725
1966475,5,B000127YYM,"Watching the magic of THE HEART OF ME unfold on the screen, one would automatically think this was the product of the Merchant Ivory team, finding yet another treasure by Forster or James to illuminate.  But no, this is the work of Director Thadeus O'Sullivan (and I don't know who wrote the screeplay).  For those who enjoy the very British view of life and relationships in the era of World War II then this film will certainly satisfy.
The story is rather simple: Two sisters, one man.  Madeleine (Olivia Williams) is very correct and is quite properly married to a man (Rickie - Paul Betany) more for appearance than for (gasp) passion.  Her sister Dinah (Helena Bonham Carter) comes to visit their proper home and is immediately attracted physically to Rickie.  Dinah and Rickie begin an affair that results in a pregnancy.  Madeleine discovers the affair but decides to remain married to Rickie because divorce is unseemly.
Rickie copes with severe ulcer disease and in the course of events the girls' mother (Eleanor Brun) has her daughter Dinah leave the scene of the sham marriage.  Dinah gives birth to a stillborn girl and attempts to stay away from Rickie and her family by moving to Southern France with her girlfriend chum Bridie (Alison Reed).  Tragedies upon tragedies occur as only they can in the British dramas - misinformation abounds, love persists, trysts recur - and the conclusion of the film shows at least a glimpse of resolution of this tangled family dilemma.
The photography is splendid: London is foggy, the coasts are wispy and cold, the interiors are moody.  The acting is absolutely first rate from everyone, but the two sisters radiate WW II England in the best of fashion.  Helena Bonham Carter as rarely looked more beautiful or acted so convincingly and the same is true for Olivia Williams.  And despite the conflicted cad Paul Betany is asked to portray he gives a subtle performance that suggests we will see much more of him. The bonus selections on the DVD are additive.  The only complaint: ambient noise and the music score often cover the voices so the viewer must concentrate so as not to miss a delicious moment. Highly recommended.",1076630400,39,2179,4.84366576819407
1966476,2,B000127YYM,"All this drama and hype for a bunch of dysfuntional people who could be happy if only they'd make the right decisions.

There was absolutely no justification for Rickie to jump into bed with his wife's sister, or his wife's sister to cast off all familial fidelity for a fling for her sister's hubby.  Didn't they know this would lead them into trouble?

I guess we're supposed to feel sorry for Rickie who basically is at the whim of his adolescent hormones, but to finally leave his mistress and then rape his wife (!) as though she's the cause of the whole thing?  What an ape.

2 stars for good London sets.",1269043200,4,611,4.419642857142857
1966477,2,B000127YYM,"Despite the effort to romanticize it, ""the Heart of Me"" is a pretty grubby story.  A woman has an affair with her sister's husband.  The sister catches on.  Emotional mayhem ensues.

I watched this movie because it stars Helena Bonham-Carter who I admire.  She plays the woman who betrays her sister.  But even her charisma and acting ability couldn't salvage this movie for me.  Why is that?

I think it all comes down to this.  If two people have an affair, it's necessary that we see the characters as more or less driven to it by their respective circumstances.  In the case of the movie ""Damage"" which starred Jeremy Irons and Juliette Binoche and concerned a man who had an affair with his son's fiance, the plot took pains to understand both characters were driven to it by an erotic obsession they couldn't control.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Damage/dp/630516195X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Damage</a>

In the case of ""Little Children,"" we have Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson playing two married people (but not to each other) with young children who embark on an affair.  But that movie's plot showed how Winslet and Wilson's characters naturally drifted into their relationship because their marriages were dysfunctional.  It made sense for them to get involved.

""The Heart of Me"" doesn't explain the affair.  The leads barely exchange a few sentences and the next thing you know, they're having sex.  The plot does establish that Bonham-Carter's character's sister was a bit cold, but that doesn't seem like a justification for stepping out on your wife with her sister.  And there's no explanation for why Bonham-Carter's character chooses to betray her sister's trust and love by sleeping with her husband.

So I can't recommend this.",1253145600,4,1941,5.650519031141869
1966478,5,B000127YYM,"""The Heart of Me"" is a carefully crafted story about love, transgressions and forgiveness. Paul Bettany plays Rickie, a man loved by two women, sisters Madeline [Olivia Williams] and Dinah [Helena Bonham-Carter]. Madeline is Rickie's wife, but her icy demeanor and obsessions with decorum exasperate Rickie. Not surprisingly, he falls for the willful and free-spirited Dinah and both embark on a passionate affair with tragic repercussions for all concerned.

The timeline of the movie is 1930s-1940s London, and the production quality is quite good creating authentic period details. The flashback technique is artfully deployed to show the various events unfolding in the main characters' lives as they reminisce about the past.

But the overall strength of this film lies in the solid acting of the three main characters - Paul Bettany is credible as the tortured man who is torn between duty to his cold wife and his love for Dinah, Helena Bonham-Carter and Olivia Williams, both fine actresses, shine in their roles as the two rival sisters. Helena Bonham-Carter [a veteran of British period dramas], gives a finely-nuanced performance as the fiercely passionate Dinah who loves with all her heart, yet finds her heart being broken repeatedly. Olivia Williams also delivers a powerful though less likable performance, portraying a woman who is so consumed with portraying the image of the model family, that she is incapable of expressing affection, much less love.

The theme of forgiveness runs strong throughout this movie, and I liked how the characters each find their own form of redemption/salvation. I did feel that the relatively short running time did not provide for a deeper development of the plot, but it kept me riveted and engaged my interest. Highly recommended for fans of British period dramas.",1237852800,2,1818,5.240549828178694
1966479,5,B000127YYM,"Honestly, I don't think that there is anything terrifically original or different about Lucinda Coxon's screenplay THE HEART OF ME. 1936,London. Rickie is married to Madeleine. It is socially a good match,but Rickie loves Madeleine's ""Bohemian "" sister,Dinah. An affair begins and no one wins...all get hurt. Chin up...press on,don't you know...ENGLISH!(I am UK descent, so I know!)

BUT...the acting strengths of Paul Bettany as the tortured Rickie,Olivia Williaws as the devoted and controlling Madeleine, and Helena Bonham-Carter as Dinah are all so uniformly inhabiting the strengths and weaknesses of their characters, that this BBC Prod is far,far better than it might have been otherwise. Bettany (before his stint as Silas in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Da-Vinci-Code-Widescreen-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00005JOC9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Da Vinci Code (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;is IMO the find in this film. He is so utterly sensitive and vulnerable as Rickie, which is frankly refreshing for an Englishman in an English Period Piece. The sisters have their own wounds to heal, but it is Bettany that really impresses in HEART OF ME.

The DVD extras are limited, but the commentary is quite insightful from director Thaddeus O'Sullivan.

1966480,3,B000127YYM,"Thaddeus O'Sullivan whose ""Nothing Personal"" was a violent story set in the Irish conflict and who also directed ""Ordinary Decent Criminal"" with Kevin Spacey helms a great cast through this tediously melodramatic period piece.  Based on Rosamond Lehmann's 1953 novel ""The Echoing Grove,"" this film traces a love triangle between two sisters and one man.  As Madeleine, Olivia Williams gives another wonderful performance as the judgmental sister who is married to Ricky, but who is unable to show much affection to her husband.  She played Bruce Willis' wife in ""The Sixth Sense"" and was mother to the kids in the 2003 version of ""Peter Pan.""  She does a great job in this film, but the tediousness of the melodrama made me want to throw my shoe at her about two-thirds of the way through the DVD.  Helena Bonham Carter is one of Britain's most interesting actresses whose roles span the somewhat demented lady in ""Big Fish"" to her most unusual role in ""Planet of the Apes"" to her wild character in ""Fight Club"" and her Oscar-nominated performance for ""The Wings of the Dove.""  As Dinah, she is interesting, entrancing and delightful.  However, I wanted to throw my shoe at her for not insisting that she be allowed into Ricky's hospital room!  Then there is the masterful Paul Bettany who plays Ricky as the quite conflicted husband, drawn to family duty and position, but whose heart leads him to a love affair with Dinah.  The steamy romantic scenes make interesting this tale about otherwise quite neurotic people who make you want to throw your shoes at them!  Eleanor Bron does an excellent job as the mother of the girls who gets right in the middle of their personal lives and tries to do what she thinks best.  Of course, it keeps the lovers apart; so she screws their lives up royally.  She goes from playing Bettany's mother-in-law here to playing his mother in the recent romantic romp ""Wimbledon.""  She has had a long distinguished career, appearing in the original ""Alfie"" in 1966, the classic ""Women In Love"" in 1969, and recently in ""Iris.""  Luke Newberry as the child Anthony does a nice job in his first film role.  All in all, this is a picture from a different cultural time, one hinging on proprieties and what others will think.  It is well done and extremely well acted.  My only advice is to watch it in your stocking feet!  Enjoy!",1109808000,5,2355,4.730392156862745
1966481,4,B000127YYM,"This is a very well made movie with a stellar cast and an intelligent script. The plot revolves around two sisters who are total opposites. Madeleine (Olivia Williams) is the glossy, cool, conventional, and undemonstrative sister who is more interested in the outward than in the inward. For Madeleine, appearances are paramount. Dinah (Helena Bonham Carter) is the artistic, bohemian younger sister who is headstrong, passionate, and fiery, in touch with her own feelings but caring little for the feelings of others, if they get in the way of what she wants. She cares little for conventions and is the bane of her sister's existence.

The prim and proper Madeleine is married to Rickie (Paul Brettany), her handsome, wealthy  husband, with whom she leads a very proper, upper crust life. Attracted to his sister-in-law, Rickie engages in a forbidden, secret  affair with her that turns into a deep and abiding love. Rickie finds in Dinah what is lacking in his wife. These soul mates, however, are destined for tragedy when they choose to defy the conventions of the strictly moral and puritanical society in which they live. The sisters' mother, Mrs. Burkett (Eleanor Bron), interjects herself into the situation in order to preserve the status quo, dividing the illicit lovers through deception.

The film, which  begins in 1934 England and covers a twelve years period through 1946, is deftly directed by Thaddeus O'Sullivan. Olivia Williams gives an intelligent, picture perfect performance as the coolly reserved Madeleine, whose facade finally cracks when she discovers her sister's and her husband's perfidy and betrayal. She ultimately is able to be in touch with her feelings and find the necessary catharsis in the end to make right what went wrong.

Helena Bonham Carter is, as always, a picture of perfection, making the reprehensible Dinah ultimately likable when self-awareness of what she has wrought dawns upon her. Paul Brettany shows that he has what it takes to be a leading man, as his reprisal of the romantically beleaguered Rickie is a sensitive portrait of a man caught between two worlds, wanting to make all those around him happy but, in the end, failing.  Eleanor Bron is wonderful as the well-meaning matriarch who understands both her daughters all too well.

This film is a beautiful period piece, with gorgeous costumes, wonderful sets, and excellent performances. It is a film well worth watching by those who are fans of this genre.",1092441600,12,2469,5.094059405940594
1966482,5,B000127YYM,"If you enjoyed Heart of Me as I did, I would also suggest the movie ""Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights"" (with Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche) and ""Till Human Voices Wake Us"" (also with Helena Bonham Carter and Guy Pearce). Wuthering Heights is chilling and the acting is superb. Till Human Voices is a powerful story with brilliant cinematography. Hope you enjoy.",1090022400,10,366,5.016393442622951
1966483,5,B000127YYM,"The movie was great, but the commentary is pretty awful, as the director seems largely inarticulate and has little to say. while the movie continues in full sound without any commentary (we have already watched the movie), but, then, it seems that good commentary is rare.",1089504000,,272,4.934782608695652
1966484,4,B000127YYM,"""The Heart of Me"" is pure, unadulterated soap opera redeemed by the kind of high-toned, stiff-upper-lip seriousness of which the British seem uniquely capable.  Set primarily in the 1930's, the film tells the story of two sisters caught in a passionate and quasi-incestuous love triangle.  Madeline (Olivia Williams), the older of the two, is an uptight woman whose weak-willed husband, Rickie (Paul Bettany), falls in love with her younger and more free-spirited sibling, Dinah (Helena Bonham Carter).  These two in-laws, soul mates for life, carry on a torrid love affair until Madeline discovers the truth - and even for a time thereafter.
Given the material, ""The Heart of Me"" could easily have devolved into a cheap, sensationalistic melodrama for the ""Masterpiece Theatre"" set.  Instead, thanks to truly brilliant performances by the three principal actors and an intelligent, thoughtful screenplay, the film becomes a wholly absorbing drama that offers profound insights into the realities of the human heart.  The pain each of these people experiences is so palpable in its intensity that it washes away all traces of artificiality and contrivance.  The film becomes a fascinating study of what happens when clanging passions are hemmed in by the restrictions and proprieties of a strict, morally repressive upper class society.  Rickie and Dinah choose to turn themselves into social pariahs, then must face the consequences of their convention-defying actions.  Of most interest is the emotionally complex relationship between the two very different sisters.  What makes the film special is the way in which it allows the seemingly cold-hearted Madeline to become as much a sympathetic figure as the two impassioned lovers.  Thanks to Williams' impeccable performance (she played Penelope in the TV movie version of ""The Odyssey""), Madeline is allowed to live and breathe and have her own say, making her, in many ways, the most intriguing of the three main characters.
""The Heart of Me,"" which is beautifully detailed in costumes and settings, transcends the limits of its genre to deliver a heartbreaking tale of love, loss, lament - and hope.",1085961600,14,2155,5.311764705882353

8005374,4,B000127YYM,"Rosamund Lehmann's beautiful novels about love and infidelity always had titles as poetic as all get-out, that would translate badly into film titles: the 1953 novel, THE ECHOING GROVE, which she used as the capstone for the major part of her literary career, was no exception. Why the producers of this adaptation of that novel would have instead settled on a title nearly as oblique is something of a mystery, but is almost certainly why this lovely and evocative (if finally somewhat unsatisfying) period drama did not receive much notice when it was released in the United States. But it's worth a look especially for fans of the fine British actresses Olivia Williams and Helena Bonham-Carter, who are allowed two of their best and most challenging roles in their very sumptuous film.

In 1935, the handsome and charismatic Rickie Masters (Paul Bettany) is married to and has a child with the cool and proper Madeleine (Williams), but longs for her Bohemian sister Dinah Burkett (Bonham-Carter). The two embark upon an affair which ultimately results in an unexpected tragedy; when Madeleine discovers the news she is devastated, and forces Rickie to choose. Although he ultimately decides to leave her for Dinah. Madeleine, with the help of the Burkett sisters' elegant mother (the formidable Eleanor Bron), practices a deception that brings Rickie back to her. Years later after the war (and Rickie's death), the two sisters must learn to appreciate the other's losses and reconcile.

Bonham-Carter's early career resulted in her being typecast in period roles, and since then she stays mostly away from them unless the part is impossible to turn down (as in THE WINGS OF THE DOVE). That she should have chose to do this role signifies how beautifully written it is and what an opportunity it allows for her to do: her older Dinah is the same woman as we see Bonham-Carter play ten years younger, but her years of unhappiness and loneliness give her a deeper sense of human understanding and dull her selfishness. Olivia Williams gets the rare chance to play a film role worthy of her talents, and her Madeleine grows from being a repressed and resentful woman to someone also more giving and kindly (but only after some catharsis). The screenplay perhaps skimps a bit on the causes of this change, and the producers also make a fundamental error in casting the pallid Paul Bettany as Rickie, the object of the two sisters' squabbling. His is the sort of role Ralph Fiennes always plays--the charismatic successful loner driven nearly to madness by love--, but Bettany is far too bland to bring off the role with the kind of panache Fiennes always delivers. The sets and costumes are exquisite, as are some of the exterior shots filmed on the Isle of Man (doubling for the English Southern coast).",1299369600,,2804,4.92600422832981
