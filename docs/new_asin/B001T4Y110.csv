The different types of levers are clearly distinguished without focusing on terminology; thus, decreasing the cognitive load for the beginning student.

They do an excellent job of showing how simple machines can change the direction of a force and change the location where a force is applied. In their discussion of pulleys, they clearly show how an inanimate object, such as a tree branch, can exert a force on a load and so decrease the force that the user needs to lift the load.

Fixed pulleys and movable pulleys are clearly distinguished. This sets the stage for a clear and simple discussion of mechanical advantage for pulley systems. Their coverage of block and tackle systems is also adequate although it is easy to see how it could be improved with the help of modern computer animation tools.

Their introduction of the trade-off between force and distance gives a natural introduction to the concept of work. This can serve as an introduction to energy for beginning students and the equivalence of input work to output work helps to motivate the concept of conservation of energy.

The coverage of mechanical advantage is at the right level of abstraction for beginning students. After studying this material, students should have a good preparation for beginning their study of motion and Newton's Laws.",1257033600,4,1504,5.024096385542169
