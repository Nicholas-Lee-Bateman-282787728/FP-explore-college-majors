8433438,2,B004KUEA3Y,"The story centers around two women in LA. Lacy (Becky Boxer) is hot and wants to be in the LA party scene. Her ""wing man"" is plain Jane (Maggie Marion) from Iowa. They get invited to an invitation only yacht party from Brock (Eric Clark). Brock has a hot girlfriend Monica (Kate Luyben) but still likes to play the field. Jane likes a quiet guy named Gavin (Taylor Gerard Hart ) who is also liked by Monica. The group also includes Mike (Aaron Buer) a creepy stalker after Lacy and party crasher Chance (David Lago) a hot head who wants his drug money back from Brock.

Oh yes the boat is also supposed haunted by Samantha who was allegedly murdered by her husband. She doesn't like people on her boat. When the killings start (sorry for plot spoiler) the film becomes a who-dun-it with a number of suspects including a ghost. The film never shows you the killer, or much of the killings. Much of the killings consist of a prop of a dead person which makes the boredom rate excel. Not the best film Troma digitized for the ages.

and very little killer
so this Troma Team release
makes for a rather boring thriller

8433441,2,B004KUEA3Y,"Judge Gordon Sullivan, DVD Verdict-- Killer Yacht Party has a pretty sweet conceit with a booze-cruise turned bad. However, the film makes a few mistakes that keep it from being great:

* It's called Killer Yacht Party; get them on the &#*%ing yacht! I know it's important to set up your characters and the scenario, etc., but the faster a horror flick gets to the carnage, the better. KYP takes over 20 minutes (about a quarter of the run time) to get the girls firmly on the yacht. This is unacceptable. Before that we get the motivating prologue (where we sorta, kinda find out why the killer wants to kill), the introduction of our two heroines (amazingly, one is shy and the other is an outgoing partier!), their bonding, and some creepy shenanigans from the party staff. All of this (with the exception of the killer's motivation) could have been handled on the boat, which would have increased the tension and moved the story along. As it is, the film feels long despite its acceptable length because it takes too long getting to the party.

* The audience has to root for somebody. I wanted pretty much everybody on the yacht to die. With the exception of Jane, they're all pretty self-absorbed, annoying characters who are hard to care about. Jane, however, is a bit too cookie-cutter to really sympathize with; the whole ""sweet Midwestern gal"" thing has been done to death. On the flip side, I didn't really care about the murderer, either. Sure, revenge is a tried and true motivation for killing a bunch of people on a boat, but this character is missing that extra something that would make me care about all the killing.

On the plus side, Killer Yacht Party does feature a few clever kills, and the production values and cinematography show a great degree of competence than films at this budget are known for. Finally, fans will likely appreciate the number of ladies willing to go scantily clad and/or nude throughout the film. It might not be enough to make up for the film's slow pace, but at least it's there.

There was a good stretch there when everything Troma touched turned to utter crap in the digital realm. Whether made in house or acquired through licensing, Troma releases were filled with shoddy transfers and so-so extras. That era is past now, and Killer Yacht Party is solid proof of their commitment to releasing even obscure films in a decent fashion. With its 1.78:1 anamorphic transfer, KYP looks pretty solid for a low-budget film. Compression artifacts crop up a bit in the darker scenes, but otherwise this transfer has a good amount of detail and decent saturation. The stereo audio track is similarly strong for this kind of film. The dialogue, though sometimes lame, comes through loud and clear, balanced well with the score and sound effects.

The main extra is a commentary by director Piotr Uzarowicz and writer Alex Silver. It's a pretty lively track, with the pair discussing how they met and got started on the film, as well as its production and budget constraints. There's a ""slideshow"" that runs less than 30 seconds featuring stills from the production, and the rest of the extras are ""Tromatic,"" including PSAs and trailers. Lloyd Kaufman and Debbie Rochon appear for a cheesy introduction.

Killer Yacht Party is a fairly generic take on the slasher genre that squanders a strong premise on with a slow pace and unlikeable characters. Fans of low-budget filmmaking may enjoy the commentary, but there's little else to recommend this film.

8433442,3,B004KUEA3Y,"This movie is your typical horror slasher flick, except that it's on a yacht, and there's a party on the boat. But the real kicker (or killer) about this party is that somebody will die, which is basically the premise of any classic Troma flick.

This movie is great because it doesn't take itself too seriously. The production values are stellar, the acting's mediocre (nothing deep about this boat, just the sea level of the voyage), and the premise is straight out of a ""How to Make a Cheesy yet By-The-Books Horror Movie"", with an emphasis on the ""Boat Ride"" chapter. So far, the director has followed it almost word for word, along with cheesy dialogue to make it look obvious that everybody involved in the making of this movie was having fun, because they don't take themselves so seriously. If Scream or The Hills Have Eyes don't tickle your fancy, Killer Yacht Party should definitely do the trick. Just don't get seasick.",1305763200,6,931,4.711656441717792
8433443,1,B004KUEA3Y,"Well then, Hell must have froze over, Troma, America's sleaziest movie producers have forgone their normal, stupid, gross, over the top gorefests and made a movie that's just stupid.

A wanna-be bimbo drags her deceptively frumpy room-mate from party to party to yacht to mooch drinks off guys who only think with their ""little"" heads. Bimbo hears about a yacht party and its anchors aweigh. There is a back story about a woman who burned to death on the yacht and now she haunts the yacht as a party pooper ghost. Of course.

There is no acting in this movie and being a Troma film it suffers the same kind of low-rent production values.  With the sole exception of some stock footage of yachts and sailboats--once the party-goers have boarded, there is nothing about the location that looks like they are on a boat, although in a couple of scenes the camera does linger on a life-saver hung on a wall. And the kill scenes are boring and curiously blood-free and at one point someone loses their head but since the special effects are so lousy, it looks like the killer is holding a very hairy coconut.  one scene I have to admit is a comedic classic of stupidity, the robots on MST3K would have a field day with this one-one party-goer is slashed with a grappling hook and falls overboard-the laugh being, the fall from yacht to water is comparable to falling from a very low canoe. It's little touches like this that keeps Troma on the bottom of the movie industry. And by the way-the DVD cover is a fake-doesn't happen.

I saw this piece of guano on my cable-they have a channel set-up with movies you can watch without an additional charge. This movie is being released in May and I will take a peek to see how many 5 star reviews start appearing.  If Troma wants to play fair maybe they should assign the name ""The Toxic Avenger"" to one of their fake reviewers.

But I'll be fair too, I liked The Toxic Avenger.",1302307200,4,1917,4.491379310344827
