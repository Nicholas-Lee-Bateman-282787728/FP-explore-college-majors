2546253,4,B000EXZKSK,"I guess the Draft trade isn't happening, so I'll just stick with the raw roster as it is now:

> WWE Championship: Edge vs John Cena (c)

  So I guess Cena will beat RVD at ONS, which won't go down too well, and I guess that there won't be a Hell In A Cell either at Vengeance which also sucks. This match will have a hardcore stipulation though, because WWE know how boring their one-on-one match was at RR06. I want Edge to win of course, and I hope he does. Maybe Foley helps out. I dunno.

> DX (HHH & HBK) vs The McMahon's (Shane & Vince)

  Decent tag team match. HBK is in the storyline with Vince McMahon anyway, and HHH is being humiliated by Vince McMahon as we speak so it is all sort of gelling togethor. The naff thing is that this more than likely will be a one-night-only thing. Oh well. DX to win of course. How stupid would it be if they didn't. Expect run-in from Spirit Squad....now.

> IC Title: Shelton Benjamin vs RVD vs Charlie Haas

  LADDER MATCH! How brilliant would that be? Beyond brilliant, I and everyone feels. Would be a match for the ages. Shelton to win though.

> Kane vs All Of Spirit Squad

  I just want to see the SS get their butts kicked. They're ruining Raw. Unleash the beast on them with (in everyones eyes) hilarious consequences.

> Womens Title: Mickie James (c) vs Beth (Trish Stratus As Referee

  Makes sense. Mickie to win.

> Carlito vs Umaga

  This match would be cool.",1147046400,,1423,4.2631578947368425
2546264,3,B000EXZKSK,"Just like last year, Vengence was a RAW event that was heavily booked two weeks before the PPV (due to ECW One Night Stand) however unlike last year (where it resulted in a WrestleMania quality card), this years event just came off like a 3 hour version of RAW with alot of matches & angles that weren't worth the price of Pay Per View.  And I'm warning you right now that Jerry Lawler spends more time bashing ECW in their matches than actually calling the match & is more annoying than he is during a divas match so if you can't stand that then I suggest you press the mute button.

Kurt Angle vs. Randy Orton - In a rematch from One Night Stand, these two went at it again and it almost exactly mirrored their match from One Night Stand (minus the crowd being all over Orton).  It was a nice match & Orton got the win in the end.

Eugene Vs Umaga - Glorified squash match as Umaga killed Eugene followed by taking out Doink The Clown & Hacksaw Jim Duggan.  But after that, Umaga left when Kamala confronted him (but that didn't lead anywhere as Umaga squashed him the next night on RAW).  I'm no fan of squash matches on PPV so this match could have been saved for RAW.

Ric Flair Vs Mick Foley (2 out of 3 falls): They actually do wrestle each other until Flair scores the first pinfall in around 7 mins. and then Foley completely goes hardcore on Flair & bloodies Flair; disqualifing himself in the process.  Again, for all the hype (not just the two week buildup but years worth of hype) and it just ends a little after 7 mins.  This again was something that should have happened on RAW, not a PPV.

Intercontinental Champion Shelton Benjamin Vs Johnny Nitro Vs Carlito - The PPV stars to pick up here again as these two pulled off a great match.  Shelton is one of the most underrated (based on how he's used from time to time), Carlito is finally coming into his own as a wrestler & not a comedy act, while Nitro is out to prove he can make it as a singles star.  Again, it's not a wrestling mat classic but it's an awesome match to watch.

WWE Champion RVD Vs Edge - Their styles really compliment each other & give another great match to watch.  Match of the night for me.

Kane Vs Imposter Kane - This match wasn't ugly or bad, it was just a boring ""big man vs. big man"" match.  Want to know how boring this match is, they killed the character & the storyline the next night on RAW.

Extreme Lumberjack Match: John Cena Vs Sabu - First of all, it's no secret that Stephanie McMahon (head of creative for RAW & SmackDown) is no fan of ECW & that was heavily reflected in his match as the ECW originals were lumberjacks (no Big Show or Angle) and were made to look inferior to the Sunday Night Heat roster (Rob Conway, Charlie Hass, ect.) throughout the match.  And course, Lawler making a bunch of ""Extremely Crappy Wrestling"" comments & even J.R. joining in on it from time didn't help the match any as well.  But besides all of that, this match was good for what it was.  It was basically both men getting their traditional spots in a 10 min. match with Sabu tapping out (FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS CAREER) to Cena.

Spirit Squad Vs DX - Unlike their Saturday Night Main Event match the next month where it was a complete squash, this was really good with a mix of wrestling & some humorious spots every now & then.  The Squad still looked somewhat strong throughout the match but they were just bodies for the DX reunion to go on strong.

There is also a bonus disc full of extras such as the behind the scenes of Torrie's magazine photo shoot, Mick Foley meeting Melina, Edge & Ric Flair interviews along with the RVD vs. Cena rematch from RAW the next night.  The rest are all the DX skits from the previous & following weeks including the Handicap match between Triple H & Spirit Squad, Spirit Squad being slimed, DX giving gifts to Mr. McMahon & hanging out with Coach, the official DX reunion, the new & updated DX music video, and the McMahon impersonations leading to Vince & Shane & Spirit Squad getting showered in ""holy"" sh*t!

Bottom line is that Vengence is a strong RAW PPV but three of these matches were complete duds & really killed the crowd & the good flow of the PPV.  The extras were a nice additional touch & hope WWE concidered that for future releases as well.",1158883200,,4295,4.310945273631841
2546265,2,B000EXZKSK,"Was it just me or did the crowed at this show really suck? It felt so boring to watch with the crowed actualy sitting there bored stupid yelling out, ""boring"" during the Kane VS Kane match.

Nothing seemed to be resolved, and I don't think most of the wrestlers where up to PPV standards. They wrestle better then everynight on raw.

The opening round with Angle VS Orton I got bored with and skipped.

Umaga VS Eugene looked like it was going to be a cool macth when Eugene brought out Doink The Clown, Hacksaw Jim Duggan and Kamala, but the whole thing ended up totaly wrong and not worth watching.

Rick Flair VS Foley was not the match I expected to see from those two.

Skipped the triple threat f**s

RVD vs Edge: Euhh

Kane VS Kane: what was that all about?

John Cena vs Sabu: I tried to watch it but skipped to the end.

DX vs Spirit sqaud.... too expected and predicatble.

I was not impressed with this PPV at all. The wrestlers didn't seem to give it there all and the crowed where just not into it. Matches didn't go the way they should have and it all seemed to be like watching a regular show, most of it was just a set up for the next night on Raw.

I give the PPV 2 stars.

But on the plus side, the second disc of extras is great. It's mostly the reunion of DX footage. Apart from the following nights match of RVD and Cena and Mick Foley and Rick Flair cuts, its pretty much all DX.

It shows DX up to some funny antics on Mr McMahon and the Coach. There parody of the spirit sqaud and parody of Shane and Vince McMahon, there reunion speech, and the night they let the s*** hit the fan on the boss.

The second disc left me more satasfied and entertained then the actual ppv. The PPV was very slow and boring with hardly any momentom going for anyone. Which is disapointing, it couldve been a great show otherwise.

I give the second disc 4 stars! I'd been happier if they just released it as a DX reunion with the PPV as the bonus features.",1157414400,,1961,4.164456233421751
2546266,5,B000EXZKSK,"I actually was at the ppv and it was exciting to see DX return. All the matches were great especially:

IC title: Shelton Benjamin (c) v. Carlito v. Johnny Nitro: that match was great beggining to end.

DX v. Spirit Squad: Man that was funny

Im saying you should buy the dvd to see one of the best brand show ppvs of the year",1157155200,,326,4.0625
2546267,4,B000EXZKSK,"I am sure know the 1 to 10 scale now so let's get started.

1. Randy Orton vs. Kurt Angle (Single)

This match was a pretty good opener.  It started off fast then slowed down then got fast again.  I love these kind of matches where it just is a clean match with good wrestlers.  Angle does 8 german suplexes in a row to randy orton.  Good match.  Winner: Randy orton 8/10

2. Umaga vs. Eugene (Single)

This match boring and just a filler for the ppv.  It was cool to see some legends though.  But nothing good in this match.  Winner: Umaga 5/10

3. Ric Flair vs. Mick Foley (2 out of 3 falls Single)

This match was really good i thought.  I don't really know why but it is.  Mick Foley gets booed foley sucks over and over.  Mick foley still is good i think but not as good as the nature boy ric flair wooooooooohhhhhhhhh.  Flair wins the first fall with a roll up.  They fight outside the ring and in the crowd some.  Flairs family was beautiful especially the brown headed one, she is very pretty.  But on the match mick loses the second fall by DQ by hitting flair in the head with a trashcan.  Then mick gets out a barbed wire bat and tears up ric flair with it and flair bleeds profusly.  See my language i been listning to JR to much but Still great match.  Winner: Ric Flair wooohhhhh 8/10

4. Johnny Nitro Vs. Carlito Vs. Shelton Benjimen (Single Triple Threat)

This is an amazing match for intercontinental championship.  They are trying to bring the intercontinental title back as a big title.  Awesome moves by carlito.  At the end Carlito hits a backcracker but johnny was outside the ring and pulls him off the pin and cover shelton for the win.  Good match.  Winner: Johnny Nitro 8/10

5. RVD vs. Edge (Single for WWE Championship)

This match was really good because of RVD doing high moves.  It was just a normal WWE championship match nothing really good.  At the end Edge gets Lita to hold up a chair and Edge tried to spear RVD into the chair but RVD ducks and Edges head cracks his head into the chair and RVD rolls up for the pin.  Winner: RVD 8/10

6. Kane Vs. Imposter Kane (Single)

This match is the second worst match of the night.  Nothing good here either.  Maybe a few good moves but nothing really.  Crowd was like that was it when imposter pinned kane with a weak chokeslam.  Boring. Winner: Imposter Kane 5/10

7. John Cena Vs. Sabu (Extreme ruled lumberjack match)

This was pretty good but could of used more weapons.  It starts out with normal wrestling then they go outside.  Ecw side grabs cena and sabu throws a chair right at cena's head and it stays there awesome.  I was wanting Cena to win and i am so glad he did.  Ecw tries to set cena's head up on a table for sabu to leg drop him through it but cena gets the sandman kendo stick and hits sabu before hit did it and Raw came and got Ecw. Cena then gets in the ring and FU sabu over the ropes through the table.  What sucked is sabu only hit the end and the table broke only a little.  But Cena makes sabu tap wit STFU yeah! Winner: John Cena 8/10

8. Main Event Dx. Vs. Spirit Squad (Single Tag)

This match was the best probably of the night.  I love DX.  This match was awesome.  Great moves off trampoline and normal wrestling.  One of spirit squad members nose starts to bleed real bad.  At the end Shawn Michaels and The game Triple H hit their moves at the same time and get the win.  DX IS ONLY GOT TWO WORDS FOR YA S*CK IT.  Winner: DX 9/10",1155513600,,3446,4.204301075268817
2546268,4,B000EXZKSK,"Vengeance is always a good ppv and this year was no exception.

1)randy orton vs ecw's kurt angle 7/10

this was the perfect way to start the show. the match was back and forth with a great ending

2)Umaga vs Uegene 3/10

Very short and only meant to show off umaga's dominance. one highlight is some old faces come to the ring with eugen

3)Flair vs Foley( 2 out of 3 falls)7/10

while this match is a little dissapointing it is still a very fun match to watch, some great stuff involving mr socko wooooo

4)carlito vs shelton benjamin vs nitro (intercontinental championship) 8/10

This was an awesome match. All three men get time to show off what they can do.

5)RVD vs Edge (wwe championship)9/10

This was the match of the night. Edge goes back to his origions as a tlc match wrestler by doing some neat stuff outside the ring.

6)Kane vs imposter Kane 7/10

For all the crap this match took its really not that bad. I am a big fan of kane which makes it alot more watchable

7)Cena vs ecw's sabu(extreme lumberjack match)6/10

This is a very exciting match but at just over 5 minutes it was way to short.

8)dx vs the spirit sqaud 7/10

Great come back match for dxd thats just a lot of fun to watch

2546270,5,B000EXZKSK,"I have to say that if you want to get a WWE DVD this year thats worth watching the whole thing, this is a definate one of the must have. Now granted there are 2 matches that are...ok, but all in all a great PPV.

Angle Vs Orton: great match. these two work great together and a definate good match.

Eugene Vs Umaga: an ok match, i mean we all knew Umaga was going to win, but its interesting to see what Eugene can pull out (which wasn't much).

Flair Vs Foley (2 out of 3 falls): a pretty good match from the beginning and you can tell that foley can do some technical mat wrestling (we've seen it in the past mixed with his brawling). When flair won the first fall it was pretty much the end of the match since foley went right back to what he knows best and loses by DQ, then bludgeons flair. could of been much better but wasn't too bad.

Benjamin Vs Nitro Vs Carlito (IC match): a really good match. one of the top matches ranked up there with the orton/angle match. a defiante must see.

RVD Vs Edge (WWE title): a really good match! these two guys styles compliment each other very well and it shows in this great match. an interesting ending as well and another must see match.

Kane Vs Imposter Kane: No offense, but this was no Undertaker Vs Fake Undertaker which it seemed like they were doing. Just didn't have the feel of that match. It was a good idea to try and do but just seemed like it was done all wrong. A decent big guys match but really the crowd wasn't feeling it and honestly, the real Kane just seemed unmotivated to do anything in this match which disappoints. If it was handled differently, this would of been good (imagine fake taker and fake kane vs undertaker and kane.... it'd be like fake diesel and ramon going against nash and hall.... c'mon you all know you wanted to see that just for the humor factor).

Cena Vs Sabu (Lumberjack Extreme Rules match): a really good match than you would figure it to be. I say that cause in most lumberjack matches we've seen in the past all the lumberjacks storm the ring. this one they don't and besides some outside activities, it stays a one on one match. weapons are nicely used here and well, Cena shows his extreme side. a definate must see.

Spirit Squad Vs DX (5 vs 2 non title match): ok its DX so its a money maker match :) yes it is good too so no worries about a lousy match as you will both laugh and see some nice moves in this one. a definate must see just for the humor factor as well as some great action.

a bonus dvd is included with extras such as the reformation of Dx and some antics from them as of late. There is also the WWE title match between cena and RVD thats the night after the PPV and a few other spots as well.

A good match, however wasn't as good as it could have been. I still get this feeling that these 2 could really have a great match but are currently just having good matches.

RATING: 82/100

Kane vs. Kane

This match was not shown in SA (probably to save time) so I cannot rate it.

Umaga vs. Eugene

Terrible short 1 minute squash. Plus I hate Umaga's finisher. I may be too generous with this rating

RATING: 40/100

Foley vs. Flair

This match was decently good (mainly in the beginning) but wasn't as good as it could have been if the match went a bit longer with Foley also get a fall victory. I hope they face again in a match that suits Foley more.

RATING: 78/100

Benjamin vs. Nitro vs. Carlito

Brilliant IC title match. It exceeded my expectations big time as it just had so many shows of athleticism by mainly Carlito and Benjamin. It is unfortunate that the person that brought the least to the match leaves with the title but we just can't help that.

RATING: 89/100

Edge vs. RVD

This match was another very good match that also had many great shows of athleticism. Many momentum changes and a good ending. I believe this match should have been the main event and if for some reason not, at least the second last match.

RATING: 90/100

Cena vs. Sabu

This match had some very good spots but it just wasn't long enough. It was also pretty similar to their previous match from WWE vs. ECW (give or take the lumberjacks). Pretty much the same length as well makes this match slightly short (perhaps 5 minutes) for my liking.

RATING: 83/100

DX vs. Spirit Squad

Interesting choice as the main event considering it is a tag match with no titles on the line. But still a tag match better than most and did what it had to do. Damn do I love DX?!

RATING: 80/100

543/700 = 78%

overall Impression = 78%

78% - The 2006 version of Vengeance continues the trend of a brilliant PPV for the second year running. It was a packed card that didn't disappoint. Out of what I saw, for only 2 matches out of the whole PPV to fail to get an 80 or above truly is a great achievement. Great follow up to ECW One Night Stand!

3. Mick Foley vs Ric Flair- I am very dissapointed in this match. They were hyping this match to be very good. They could've made 1 match single competition 2nd match street fight and 3rd match a cage match or something like that. That would've been way better.

2546287,5,B000EXZKSK,"First, I just wanna say that, overall, Vengeance 06 was a much more solid PPV than the 2005 edition (with the exception of 2005's main event of Batista/ Triple H in a Hell-in-a-Cell match for the World Championship).

The only bad thing about 2006 was the order of the bookings: the WWE Championship was just match 5 of 8 scheduled matches and came before Kane vs. Masked Kane (WTF?!); Kurt vs. Randy was the opener, and although it was a great match it seemed disrespectful to ECW's greatest and RAW's greatest superstars; and D-X vs. Spirit Squad, a goddamn tag team match, was the main event (something that should happen only at Survivor Series!).

But apart from the crap bookings, Vengeance 2006 was the greatest PPV this year, drawing only with WrestleMania.

Anyway, here is my review.

ECW: ONE NIGHT STAND REMATCH - KURT ANGLE VS. RANDY ORTON

Wow! Although I was pi$$ed off that this was the opening match, I gotta say that this was incredible! Randy Orton is the greatest wrestler of all time, drawing with the late Eddie Guerrero and Mick Foley, and Angle is always good. This was so much better than their ECW encounter, which was totally one sided to Kurt Angle (which is understandable, after all he is gonna have to carry ECW). Angle hit his variety of Suplex's, but instead of the 3 Multiple German Suplex's he hit 8! Randy hit an amazing dropkick (nicely pointed out by Jerry 'The King' Lawler), and his deadly Stretch Backbreaker. Both men seemed much more focused in this match and, although I was fully for Randy winning, I was sure Angle was gonna win when he locked in the Ankle Lock - I mean, Orton tapped on SmackDown!, had his ankle broken by Kurt, tapped again at ECW etc. Although the ending was predictable as soon as Randy turned towards the exposed turnbuckle, the match was simply awesome! A good counter to the Ankle Lock and a beautiful RKO secure the win for RAW and finally gives Orton his revenge (hopefully this feud will now be over and the Legend Killer can capture some RAW gold at SummerSlam!)

10/10 - MATCH OF THE NIGHT!

UMAGA VS. EUGENE (W/ DOINK, JIM 'HACKSAW' DUGGAN, & KAMALA)

After watching this match again, it didn't seem so bad. I am getting sick of seeing Eugene as he is, simply put, crap. The Legends at ringside do nothing during the match, and the entrances last longer than the match (I think the match lasts 1 Min 30 Secs). Umaga has a stupid finisher, but thankfully Eugene is put down...it's for the best. The Samoan Spike gives Umaga the victory, and then Doink and Hacksaw get destroyed as well. Kamala and Umaga have a staredown at the end (Kamala is just fat!).

4/10

2 OUT OF 3 FALLS - MICK FOLEY VS. RIC FLAIR

I enjoyed this match for what it lasted, but the match should have gone for 3 falls, and Flair should have left his hometown without needing support. As Foley has been a face wrestler for most of his WWE career, it was strange to hear the crowd insult Foley as much as they did. Flair carries Foley through this match, Foley then pulls out Mr. Socko (dressed as the Nature Boy - that was great!), but is surprised by Flair with a roll-up for the 1st fall. Foley and Flair then brawl outside the ring, before Flair is thrown back in and Mick grabs a trash can - this is where the match gets great! Flair trips up Foley, causing the trash can to land on Mick's face, and the Figure 4 is applied. Foley tries to counter, fails, and knocks Ric out-cold with a shot from the trash can. Flair wins the 2nd fall via DQ, but Foley then bloodies the Nature Boy, proving that he is not a wrestler, but he is damn sure the Hardcore Legend! (These two will definetly fight again in a stipulation).

8/10 - BRUTAL ENDING WITH THE BARBED-WIRE BAT (IT LOOKS SO REAL!)

TRIPLE THREAT I.C. CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH - BENJAMIN VS. CARLITO VS. NITRO

This was the greatest of the 3 Triple Threats that have occured this year on PPV, and easily qualifies for the best ever. I thought the match would be similar to Benjamin vs. Carlito from last year's Vengeance, but it was so much better. Shelton hits some athletic moves, with Nitro also performing some great wrestling, but it is Carlito's performance that makes this so great. He is really getting over with the crowd, and he does some amazing high flyng moves, like the Sommersault Plancha to the outside. This match was really intense, and either man could have won. Carlito eventually tries for the Suplex, Benjamin counters, but the Carlito jumps and hits the Back-Cracker to lay out the champion. Nitro then pulls Carlito out of the ring and steals a win. Carlito will definetly win the I.C. title though, maybe on RAW in July (the I.C. title has changed hands more times in July than in any other month).

9/10 - BECAUSE OF THE CHEAP ENDING IT DROPS A MARK

WWE CHAMPIONSHIP - RVD VS. EDGE

I just wanna say that, alhough I hate ECW as a group, I also despise Edge. I like RVD, and although I don't like him as champ he was the right man to win. Edge and RVD both counter each other, and highlights include the sick Sunset Powerbomb to the outside and the Vandaminator with the belt (look for the real cut on Edge's head). This match wasn't as fast flowing as Cena vs. RVD at ECW: ONS, but it wasn't bad. The match might have seemed better if it was the main event, instead of a mid-card match (when was the last time the WWE gold was mid-card?! RVD needs to be recognised if he's gonna be champ). RVD hits a hige 5-Star Frog Splash after Edge misses the Spear and hits the Steel Chair - but who didn't see that coming?! RVD will lose at Saturday Night's Main Event to Cena though.

7/10 - CRAP BOOKING

KANE VS. MASKED KANE

I just wanted to see the masked Kane in a propper match. This was quite short, but had some great strikes from both men. Not much to say, except Masked Kane wins with the Chokeslam and signature Darkness Pin.

6/10

EXTREME LUMBERJACK MATCH - JOHN CENA VS. SABU

Although it was obvious Cena would win, I was hoping for a brutal match with both men bleeding tonnes. The match would have been better if it hadn't been so there were RAW & ECW Lumberjacks. Only lasts about 8 minutes, but Sabu's chair toss at Cena looked great (his head goes straight through it!), Cena's chair toss to Sabu looked painful, and the F-U from the inside of the ring to the outside through a table looked crippling - the table doesn't even break properly, and Sabu's back snaps off the end of the table. Cena then applies STF-U and makes ECW's Sabu tap-out! (Though I wish Cena could win by the F-U for once, like he used to).

8/10 - NO BLOOD AND NOT ALL THAT HARDCORE, BUT ENTERTAINING

5-ON-2 HANDICAP MATCH - SPIRIT SQUAD VS. D-GENERATION X

I was pi$$ed off that this was the main event, yet I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised as it was D-X's first match on the same team since the Attitude era. I enjoyed this match, though it was a bit too long, and HBK and the King of Kings/ the Game wiped the floor with the 5 cheerleaders. Johnny gets a broken nose and bleeds loads, and his Karate segment was great - Triple H looked amused and then just layed him out with a single punch. 3 Sweet Chin Musics and 2 Pedigrees later, D-Generation X walk out the winners! Not the classic main event that was Batista vs. Triple H from last year's Vengeance, but still great just to see D-X reunited! (But a tag match still shouldn't have been the main event, unless there was gonna be No DQ or a stipulation). And, although some people are saying Randy Orton will join D-X, I don't see it happening as Orton is getting a deserved push and is looking for some singles gold.

9/10 - JUST BECAUSE D-X IS BACK!

EXTRA MATCH - WWE CHAMPIONSHIP - RVD VS. JOHN CENA

This is the championship match from the next night on RAW. I loved this match, as I love Cena, but I knew that Edge would interfere after he left the building (it was like Taboo Tuesday 2004 when he Speared HBK). After Cena hit the F-U he could have got the pin and won, but instead he applies STF-U, and then I knew he wouldn't win. The match ends No Contest when Edge runs to the ring, attacks and hits Edgecution to Cena, and Spears RVD.

8/10 - WOULD HAVE BEEN 9 IF CENA WOULD HAVE WON

So, overall I would give this PPV 9/10. It had three incredible matches (Randy vs. Kurt, the Triple Threat match, and D-X vs. Spirit Squad), and an average WWE Championship match that would have been better if it was the main event. This PPV is the best this year, drawing only with WrestleMania 22! And on the extras, you will get all of D-X's stunts in the two weeks of RAW leading up to Vengeance, and the WWE Championship match between RVD and Cena on the next night on RAW.

A great PPV, get this now!!!",1151452800,2,8678,4.380833851897947

WINNER: RIC FLAIR 7/10

4) (TRIPLE THREAT MATCH FOR THE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP)

NITRO VS. SHELTON BENJAMIN VS. CARLITO

AN AWESOME MATCH. ONE OF THE BEST INTERCONTINENTAL TITL MATCHES I HAVE EVER SEEN. CARLITO HITS HIS BACK BREAKER BUT THEN NITRO PULLS CARLITO OUT OF THE RING AND PICKS UP THE WIN.

WINNER: NITRO 9/10

5) (WWE CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH) RVD VS. EDGE

A PRETTY SOLID MATCH. EDGE GETS BLOODY AFTER A VANDAMINATOR WITH THE BELT. EDGE SHOULD HAVE WON. THE WHOLE IDEA OF THE WWE TITLE BEING ON ECW IS JUST GAY. WINNER: RVD 9/10

8) (5 ON 2 HANDICAP MATCH) DX VS. SPIRIT SQUAD

THIS WAS AN AMAZING MATCH. I LOVE!!!!!!!! DX. THEY DOMINATE THE SPIRIT SQUAD. JOHNY GETS A REALLY BLOODY NOSE SO THERES EVEN SOME HUMOR IN IT. WINNERS: DX 10/10

OVERALL THIS WAS A GREAT PPV. THERES BEEN BETTER BUT THIS IS STILL VERY GOOD. I RECOMMEND THIS TO A WRESTLING FAN.",1151280000,3,1814,4.455927051671733
2546289,3,B000EXZKSK,"In 2006, I would've told you to pick up this 3-star PPV because the 2nd disc had a lot of DX bonuses, and a couple of excellent matches.

In 2007, I would've told you to still pick this set up because even though the DX extras got released on the NEW & IMPROVED DX set, there were still a couple irresistible matches on the card.

It's 2009, and with the exception of my favorite match of 2006, there's little reason to invest in VENGEANCE 2006.  There's a lot of content on this 2-disc set, but the quality is debateable.

1) Randy Orton (RAW) v. Kurt Angle (ECW)
---I didn't see these two wrestlers work together much, but I've been disappointed every time.  Their WRESTLEMANIA triple threat was 10 minutes of awesomeness that ended way sooner than it should've.  Their encounter at the ECW's official brand launch was basically Angle embarassing Orton like you wouldn't believe.  But this one has no excuse.  Angle and Orton, quite frankly, just meandered around in a slow-paced match that failed to draw me in.  There were a couple of teased spots that never came to be, specifically Angle attempting a German suplex off the apron.  I love both of these guys, but I just can't into their one-on-one matches.
""5.5 / 10""
_______________________________________________

2) Umaga v. Eugene
---Basically a chance for Umaga to squash a gimmick that overstayed his welcome.  I would normally get furious at these stupid squashes, but I didn't expect much to begin with, so I'm indifferent.  Some people would ask, ""Well, then why bother at all on PPV?""  Those people have a good point.
""4.0 / 10""
_______________________________________________

3) Two-Out-of-Three Falls
Mick Foley v. Ric Flair
---This is another shameful jip.  Foley couldn't have done a better job turning heel.  Flair and Foley pushed their somewhat real-life dislike for each other into a compelling storyline.  We were in North Carolina, and Foley thankfully retracted his promise to deliver the worst wrestling match of all time.  If it weren't for the crowd's generous reception to the short contest that basically prolonged the storyline, then this would've tanked even harder.  The match is entertaining while it lasts, but it just stops when it was getting good.
""5.5 / 10""
_______________________________________________

4) Intercontinental Championship
Carlito v. Johnny Nitro v. Shelton Benjamin (champion)
---I love how this match starts; Carlito is watching two Divas oil each other, and is almost tempted to not go out the ring when his music starts in the background.  Nitro was new the RAW roster, and Shelton Benjamin can do any physical feat he wants.  The match starts a little strange, because it's basically the three guys performing what are obviously choreographed spots.  But then the spots just get so crazy and so crisp that you stop caring go along for the ride.  The crowd was stunned at what they witnessed, going from one exciting move to the next.  This match was rightfully included on the HISTORY OF THE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP DVD.  Too bad for this 2-disc set.
""8.5 / 10""
_______________________________________________

5) WWE Championship
Edge (RAW) v. Rob Van Dam (ECW - WWE champion & ECW champion)
---First off, why is this match in the middle of the card?  I accept it not being the main event (DX would've stolen all of the pops anyway), but this is just wrong.  Anyway, this extraordinary match is why I almost recommend you buy this PPV.  The crowd didn't get into the match right away, but Edge and RVD were throwing counter after counter, hold after hold, signature moves, false finishes...just about anything you want in a title match, really.  The match starts off patiently, so that Edge and RVD can size each other up.  But as the match endures, the two men get desperate and pull out all the stops to put away their opponent.  Not all championships need to be like this one, but they're usually the best when they are.  I'm disappointed that Edge didn't get to have this match on his 3-disc set, because even though he got pinned to the mat, RVD and Edge delivered my favorite match from 2006.
""9.0 / 10""
_______________________________________________

6) Kane v. ""Kane""
---Man, Kane was in some weird angles in 2006.  The ""May 19th"" voices in his head to plug his horror movie.  An endless feud with Umaga later in the year.  But this one bites the big one; when have ""mirror"" matches ever worked?  Oddly enough, even though this was a stupid storyline, the physical action between the two Kanes was kinda entertaining to me.  If you can ignore the ""Boring"" chants and bizarre scenario, this is a decent slugfest between two large athletes.  A waste of time, but I didn't think it was as awful as most have made it out to be.
""6.0 / 10""
_______________________________________________

7) Extreme Lumberjack Match
Sabu (ECW) v. John Cena (RAW)
---Remember when ECW just launched, and was doing fairly well for itself?  The tension between RAW's ""superstars"" and ECW's ""extremists"" was some very good TV.  This interpromotional match was built well enough to earn high spot on the card (not over RVD/Edge, but whatever).  And to be fair, the action is very exciting while it lasts.  You get to see kendo sticks, chairs, tables, and good old-fashioned lumberjack gang-ups.  The problem is that this match is very short.  I think it only lasted about 6 minutes from bell to bell.  That is beyond stupid.  Maybe it was to push Cena.  Maybe it was to embarass ECW.  Maybe it was to prevent Sabu from having any botches.  Bottom line - a very good match was cut short for no good reason.
""6.5 / 10""
_______________________________________________

8) 2-on-5 Handicap Match
D-Generation X (Shawn Michaels & Triple H) v.
The Spirit Squad (World Tag Team champions)
---I don't have a big problem with this being the main event, because it makes a lot of sense.  DX was making RAW a very fun TV program, and boosting ratings and merchandise sales.  And let's be honest, most of the fans in attendance wanted to see DX more than anything else, even John Cena or Ric Flair.  The main event doesn't even have to be the best match on the card for me; but it MUST be a good match.  This Handicap Match is solid, but not ""good"".  What results from this 5-on-2 scenario is HBK & HHH doing a lot comedy spots to embarass the cheerleaders, who didn't need more embarassing anyway.  There are a lot of unique spots, like The Spirit Squad using a trampoline to deliver aerial attacks, or whenever DX throws their opponents around like rag dolls into each other.  And besides, what's the point?  DX made it pretty clear that they weren't going anywhere in the weeks building up to this PPV; if Spirit Squad won, then maybe this would've been significant.  As it stands, this main event feels like a longer RAW match, and not a PPV presentation.  I was a little let down when I paid 40 PPV dollars for this, but even when I managed to get this DVD for just 3 bucks...I was still underwhelmed.  Oh, and this match is on the NEW & IMPROVED DX DVD anyway.
""6.5 / 10""
_______________________________________________

VENGEANCE 2006 has a lot of bonus content compared to normal WWE PPV releases these days.  It also has two excellent matches, and few decent ones.  The problem is all of this good content is available on other WWE DVDs.  The DX stuff has been re-released on another DX set, with the main event and other matches included.  And the exciting triple threat match for the IC Title was included on the solid 3-disc set for this belt.  The only match on the DVD I recommend going out of your way to see is the WWE Championship Match, especially because no other match from 2006 was as much as fun as this one for me.

VENGEANCE 2006 wasn't a great a PPV to begin with.  As long as you don't have the other bonus content on other sets, then this 3-star deal may be a 4-star package for you.",1151280000,,7901,4.747430249632893
2546290,4,B000EXZKSK,"Randy Orton vs Kurt Angle: Orton won this one like I expected he would since Angle beat him 2 times with the ankle lock. It still was a very good match though. I don't understand why Angle and Orton had to wrestle first just so the Spirit Squard could be in the mainevent though. Anyway Angle dominates most the match and Orton wins by hitting Angle's face on an exposed turn-buckle and then hits the RKO for the win.
8 out of 10

  Umaga vs Eugene: Eugene comes out with Doink, Hacksaw and Kamala and still loses very quickly to that taped thumb move. Umaga then beats up Hacksaw and Doink but his manager wouldn't let him fight Kamala. I guess just to set up Umaga to beat him in a quick match too.
4 out of 10

  Mick Foley vs Ric Flair (2 out of 3 Falls): Flair win the first fall with a roll-up pin and then wins the 2nd fall by DQ when Foley shoves the ref. Then Foley goes all hardcore and makes Flair bleed bad. Younger and quicker guys in a 2 out of 3 fall match would've been much better than this.
6 out of 10

  Johny Nitro vs Carlito vs Shelton Benjaman: A good match with a lot of action with Nitro taking advantage of Carlito doing all the work on Benjaman to get the win. It's funny how he and Melina were supposed to get suspended for being rude backstage on Smackdown. Then they got pushed to Raw and now Nitro gets a IC title push that he's not even ready for. When poor Joey Mercury hasn't even been on TV since M&M broke up. The wrong man won but still not a bad match.
7 out of 10

  Edge vs RVD (World title): Yes this match happened before Kane vs Kane, Sabu vs Cena and DX vs the Spirit Squard! RVD won the World title and is still a mid-carder at ppvs, this guy never gets a break. Since he pinned Edge at the ECW show this week I expected Edge to win. RVD picks up the win though in an impressive match for both men. They reverse a lot of each others moves. RVD picks up the win with the 5 Star Frog Splash after RVD moves out of the way of the spear and Edge hits a chair Lita has heaald up. Edge lost just so that wannabe rapper that gets thrown in our face constantly can win the belt from RVD on Raw tomorrow night, woo hoo....not! This match was better than the matches that followed it, so it could've easily have been the last match.
10 out of 10

  Fake Kane vs Kane: Since it's obvious that they want to put over the new Kane it was obvious he was going to win this match. He wasn't that impressive at all though. The real Kane destroys him through most the match and fake Kane wins with a weak Chokeslam.
5 out of 10.

  Sabu vs John Cena (Extreme Lumberjack match): This match just made ECW look weak and that is why the WWE can't do ECW if their lives counted on it!! Guys that you hardly see on tv came out to represent Raw in Cena's corner. While any of them could've made things more exciting by turning on Cena and jumping to ECW. I mean Val Venis in his Pornstar gimmick in ECW would be much much better than Zombies!!! Sabu is one of the only guys in the new but anything but improved ECW that can go and they make him look weak here by losing to the played out and get the hell out of our face already John Cena. Just so we can hear Lawyler say "" he sure showed those Extremely crappy wrestlers!"". Or hear J.R. try to put over Cena by talking about how great he is when he's really not. Sabu didn't tap-out to the Samoan sabmission Machine Samoa Joe yet he tapped out to John Cena ?? If they wanted to make him and ECW look strong they could've at least have Sabu be in the STFU for a few minutes and pass-out. Instead they're making all the same mistakes they did in the Alliance angle, they are more concerned with making the WWE guys look strong. I would much much rather see Sabu in the ring with Rey again instead of Cena.
5 out of 10

  The Spirit Squard vs DX: RVD waited years to be champ just so he can be a mid-carder at a ppv and then probably just lose the belt back to Cena on Raw. Plus the Spirit Squard can go but come on, are they really ppv mainevent worthy ?? I like Triple H as face but he really needs to realize that he's not the only guy on Raw that can be a mainevent at a Raw ppv. RVD vs Edge could've easily have been the last match. This match wasn't bad but it could've easily have just been the mainevent on an episode of Raw. Plus after HHH being evil for so long it doesn't work that he acts all goofy now. I expected him to even turn-on Michaels. No though, HBK gets beat up through most the match and then makes the tag to HHH. They beat-up the Spirit Squard and hit Sweet Chin Music on one member and the Pedigree on another for the win. HHH then pulls down his pants and HBK shoves one of the Spirit Squard members faces up there.

2546291,4,B000EXZKSK,"Vengeance 2006 was a solid night of fun. DX returned and won, RVD retained his title, Kane fought himself for the first time ever, and ECW was in full swing as John Cena won the lumberjack match.

Randy Orton vs. Kurt Angle:

A solid match to start the show. Both men had a lot more time to work with compared to ECW ONS 2  a few weeks ago, which was great. Some highlights include Angle giving Randy a German Suplex on the floor! Then Randy fights back with some underhanded tactics such as a thumb to the eye and throwing Angle back first into the barricade. They fight back in the ring and Randy eventually takes a pad off the top turnbuckle while Angle tries to put Randy in the ankle lock. Randy sends Angle into the exposed turnbuckle head first and then connects with the RKO for the win! 8/10 [The only problem that I could see was that the crowd was surprisingly dead for most part of this match, oh well....]

Umaga vs. Eugene:

Before the match Eugene brought out Hacksaw Jim Duggan, Doink the Clown, and Kamala for backup. They didn't help at all as Umaga destroyed Eugene in about 30 seconds for the win. After the match Umaga takes out Duggan, Doink, but holds back against Kamala for some reason. 1/10 [This was what people in the stadium would call a ""bathroom break.""]

2 Out Of 3 Falls Match

Ric Flair vs. Mick Foley:

I was very interested in seeing this match, just to see if Foley would indeed wrestle without using any weapons. The beginning of the match had Flair out wrestling Foley, but Foley fought back and even pulled out Mr. Socko who was dressed up as Flair himself, complete with a robe and everything. Flair wins the first fall after reversing the Figure Four into an inside cradle and pinning Foley.

After the first fall the two men fight into the crowd and Foley even back drops Flair back into the inside part of the barricade right on the floor! They fight back in the ring and Foley brings out a trashcan and throws it into the ring. Flair eventually puts Foley into the Figure Four but Foley nailed him in the head with the trash can and got disqualified. Flair won the match. 8.5/10 [A pretty good match actually.]

[After the match Foley destroyed Flair with the trash can and a barbed wire baseball bat! Flair was an ugly bloody mess as referees separated the two men.]

Intercontinental Championship

Carlito vs. Shelton Benjamin [Champion] vs. Johnny Nitro:

Can I just say Melina is too damn hot for Nitro?... Anyone agree? This was a match that I really could not predict who would win, no matter how hard I tried. This was a fast paced, very entertaining match. All three men kept getting near falls and reversals to each other's moves. Highlights include an INSANE looking triple suplex type move by all three men in the corner that has to be seen to be believed. So many near falls I couldn't keep track. The end comes when Carlito hits Benjamin with his back breaking type move but then Nitro pulls Carlito out of the way and gets the three count. 9/10 [Great, fast paced match]

WWE Championship

Rob Van Dam [Champion] vs. Edge:

Glad Cena did not get a rematch at this ppv. This match was very back and forth in the beginning. Highlights include RVD hitting a moonsault off the barricade on the outside onto Edge. Then Edge fights back with a sunset flip powerbomb off the apron to RVD to the floor! They continued to fight and RVD missed Edge with a spin kick and nailed the ref. Edge went for the championship belt but RVD gave the Van Daminator to Edge with the belt! The end comes when Edge tries to spear RVD but misses and hits a chair that Lita was holding up, and RVD nails the Five Star Frog Splash for the win! 9/10 [Great match and some wicked looking moves that I didn't include take place in this match as well.]

Kane vs. Kane:

I thought the intro of the ""fake"" Kane last month was pretty good, but rumor has it Mr. McMahon does not like the way the storyline is going. This was pretty much big man moves all the way. Both giants used clotheslines and boots to the faces all throughout the match. Kane even tried to rip the mask off the imposter's face but the fake Kane fought back. Near the end Kane went to the top rope but got caught in a chokeslam and was pinned. 6/10

Extreme Lumberjack Match

Sabu vs. John Cena:

ECW Wrestlers and RAW Superstars circled the ring as the two men fought. ECW Wrestlers included; The Sandman, Tommy Dreamer, Justin Credible, Balls Mahoney, Roadkill, Danny Doring, Little Guido, and Steven Richards. WWE RAW Superstars included; Matt Striker, Snitsky, Val Venis, Trevor Murdoch, Lance Cade, Charlie Hass, and Viscera.

The match was full of moments when either Sabu or Cena were sent out and RAW and ECW Wrestlers beat up the other man. The Sandman even caned Cena in the head with his singapore cane. Sabu used a steel chair all throughout the match and nailed his signature moves such as the triple jump moonsault and the Arabian Facebuster on Cena with the steel chair. It didn't take long however, when the ECW and RAW wrestlers started going at it. Sabu almost puts Cena through a table on the outside but Viscera comes out of nowhere and nails Sabu with a singapore cane.

Back in the ring Cena throws Sabu over the tope rope and Sabu took a sick looking spot as he hit the edge of the table. Sabu gets thrown in the ring during all the fighting and Cena locks on the STFU for the win. 8/10 [To be honest, I was expecting A LOT more violence, but still a pretty good match, however I was rooting for Sabu.]

Handicap Match

Degeneration X vs. The Spirit Squad:

Nice to see DX back after so many years. The crowd was WAY over with DX and booed the hell out of the Spirit Squad. The match was full of crotch chops and pants being pulled down by DX on the Spirit Squad. Michaels tried to pull Mikey out of the ring but gets hit with a chair on the outside. Triple H soon gets beaten up by the big group as the crowd continued to boo the Spirit Squad. In the end however Shawn Michaels hit Sweet Chin Music and Triple H hit the pedigree for the double win. 9/10

I recommend this DVD highly. A lot of great matches took place. The only real duds were Umaga/Eugene, and Kane/Kane matches. Besides that this is one solid wrestling ppv.

Highly recommended.",1151193600,,6264,4.4140625
2546302,5,B000EXZKSK,"Just a couple of days untill Vengeance, and I'm hyped because I've got tickets!  Overall, the card is looking great, possibly the best Raw ppv of the year so far.  Here are my predictions:

1) Carlito vs Shelton Benjamin vs Nitro IC MATCH.

  -This one is a tossup, any of these superstars could hold the championship.  I would like to see Nitro win the title, but I believe it'll come down to Benjamin and Carlito, with Carlito winning the gold. I expect a good 10 - 15 minute match here.  Expect the Benjamin-Carlito rivalry to continue.

2) Umaga vs Eugene

  -This one is basically a card filler, but I actually enjoy Umaga's matches.  While they are usually sqaushes, they entertain me.  I am also looking forward to seeing the crowd reaction to Eugene in the Bobcats Arena.  I expect this match to be a semi-squash, with ofcourse Umaga winning.  I'm predicting a 5 minute match.

3) Kane vs Imposter Kane

  -This rivalry really amuses me.  The first time I saw the imposter Kane come to the ring I was really excited.  I'm looking forward to the match, I believe there will be some kind of bump.  I predict Kane being set on fire or being demolished and possibly wear the mask once again after the PPV.  The match should be amusing, I'm predicting around five or ten minutes.

4) Kurt Angle vs Randy Orton

  - This match should be nothing less of five stars.  Two of my favorite wrestlers, and also two of the buisnesses best (not counting Randy Orton's attitude backstage).  The match should be a long one, probaly around 20 minutes, and have lots of ground wrestling from Angle.  Randy Orton is preparing for a push after Vengeance, so I pick him to win the match.  WWE making Orton lose twice to Angle will most likely not happen.  If  Orton wins, there probaly will be a third match with these two in the future.

5) Mick Foley vs Ric Flair TWO OUT OF THREE FALLS

  -Hmm, I'm interested to see what will happen in this match.  I believe Foley will suprise Flair and win the first fall, but Flair will win the next two falls.  WWE has to put Flair over in Raleigh (my home town, by the way).  I believe these two could put on a very good match, with lots of tension.  But with what Foley said on Raw, how he was not going to try, it will be interesting.  Expect a twenty minute match.  Also, expect lots of woo's from the crowd.

6) John Cena vs Sabu

  -This match looks to be a very brutal one.  Expect lots of bleeding from both wrestlers.  With ECW wrestlers around the ring, Cena will be the underdog.  Expect the ECW lumberjacks to give Sabu weapons, and to slaughter Cena.  Cena will come back, (like he always does) and beat Sabu, probaly by sumbmission.  I believe both wrestlers will take a beating.  Expect a fifteen minute match.

7) Rob Van Dam vs Edge WWE CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH

  -This match should be one of the night's best.  Both Rob Van Dam and Edge are capable of outstanding performances, and this match should be nothing less.  I'm almost sure Edge will win the title and start a fude with Cena afterwards.  Other ECW rebels could possibly interfere during this match, or Heyman could attempt to interfere.  Then again, other WWE superstars could interfere and make Van Dam lose.  Either way it should be a very good match.  Should be around 20-25 minutes.

8) DX vs Spirit Squad

  -I'm hyped about this match.  I can't wait to see DX live!  It should be electrifying.  I loved what they did on Raw, HHH and Shawn Micheals have lots of chemistry.  I'm a fan of both groups, the Spirit Squad and DX, but I will be rooting for DX, and DX should win, even with Vince interfering.  I'm not sure what will go down, this is a very hard match to predict.  Vince will probaly do something to make DX the large underdogs, but maybe an old DX member will make the save.  Either way, expect DX to go over big time.  I'm guessing this match will be around fifteen to twenty minutes.

Well, those are my predictions.  I would appreciate it if you could rate me so I know somebody has read my typing.  If you are reading this after Vengeance, well, go ahead and read my predictions and see how well I guessed.  Thank you for reading.",1151020800,4,4151,4.400530503978779

2546305,4,B000EXZKSK,"7) Triple Threat Intercontinental Title Match

Nitro vs. Carlito vs. Shelton Benjamin

Winner- Shelton Benjamin

Reason- Nitro still needs development to hold the IC championship, and Carlito is too good for the fans to have a huge victory at Vengeance. Also, Benjamin is a good heel to represent Raw until someone better comes along. Another reason Nitro will not win is because a heel won't take the title from a heel.

Length- 13 minutes.

6) Umaga vs. Viscera (may be tag team match)

Winner-Umaga

Reason- Umaga will retain his winning streak because the WWE is pushing it so much. He will not lose his winning streak that fast with all of that hype.

Length- 4 minutes.

5) Kurt Angle vs. Randy Orton

Winner- Randy Orton

Reason- Kurt has already beaten Orton twice and this time they are in a WWE ring. Orton will walk away with this one. Will most likely steal the show.

Length- 20 minutes.

4) John Cena vs. Sabu

Winner- John Cena

Reason- John Cena is rolling towards destroying ECW and building up as an eventual heel. John Cena will not lose to Sabu because of his determination to bring hardcore to ECW.

Length- 15 minutes.

3) 2 Out of 3 Falls Match- Ric Flair vs. Mick Foley

Winner- Ric Flair

Reason- Ric Flair has just returned to the WWE from his recent marriage. Ric Flair will win this one mainly because it is in his hometown and the WWE is pushing a long win streak for ""The Nature Boy.""

Length- 25 minutes.

2) WWE Championship- Edge vs. Rob Van Dam

Winner- Edge

Reason- Rob Van Dam is now the ECW Champion, and the WWE Champion, so therefore, Edge will DEFINITELY take the title back to RAW. Look for an interference from Cena( although im not sure who he will attack.) Someone else will also most likely interfere (from SmackDown!, maybe Bobby Lashley) and announce they are now on Raw because the WWE is going around the Draft Lottery this year. Edge will win and Edge will be WWE Champion and RVD, ECW Champion.

Length- 20 minutes.

Main Event- D-X vs. Spirit Squad

Winner- Spirit Squad

Reason- I know I know, i want D-X to win as much as everyone else, but WWE's plan is for D-X to unfortunately be ""a summer thing"", and Shawn Michaels is planning to undergo knee surgery, so he will need a storylined reason to miss from the WWE. Therefore, D-X will lose the match and Triple H will go on to SummerSlam to face all of them in a big-hype match and win. I am not 100% sure though what WWE is going to do. They might go with letting D-X win the match and then Michaels get injured at SummerSlam, i don't know. I will have to see come June 25. I am starting to think that D-X will win, because a lack of faces winning earlier. Most of the night will go to the heels though, setting up good matches for SummerSlam.

Surprises of the night...

1) Umaga running away with Lillian?? Maybe??

2) A SmackDown! interference in the WWE Championship match. My bets are that it is someone heel that is big enough for a championship match, or Bobby Lashley???",1150416000,2,2984,4.452029520295203

Kurt Angle VS Randy Orton: A very good opening match. I love how Orton can pull the RKO out of nowheres.

Eugene VS Umaga: Hate Eugene and its a damn shame Umaga didn't destory Eugene.

Mick Foley vs Ric Flair: This was in Flair's hometown. If that doesnt give the match away, then I don't know what will. The match itself was a bore and they'd go onto have a better match at Summerslam.

Shelton Benjamin VS Johnny Nitro VS Carlito: Best match on the whole card. Its too bad Benjamin and Carlito aren't doing anything important in the WWE right now. The only downside to this match was the ending sucked.

RVD VS Edge: A good match but nothing speical. Oh wait, its the only WWE ppv you'll ever see RVD as a champion. Like one reviewer said, this match was stuck in the middle? I know D-X was the seller of the show but the other two matches sucked.

Kane VS Imposter Kane: A storyline that disappeared. Imposter Kane wins a very boring match. Imposter Kane is not Festus Dalton on Smackdown if anyone really cared.

Sabu VS John Cena: ECW is made to look like fools for the WWE crowd. If this was the real ECW, Sabu would have won. Sabu does his usual stuff but its always fun to watch. Very good moments in this match but Cena won of course.

DX VS Sprirt Squad: The Squad won this match...yea right. DX returns and destorys the Squad. A decent match but I wouldnt say it was the best of the reunion tour.

8115778,1,B000EXZKSK,"After taking a break from watching WWE that lasted roughly four years (2002 onwards), I recently bought a whole bunch of WWE PPVs to catch up a little. Now, I wasn't crazy about the ones I got (Summerslam 2005 especially), but boy oh boy was this Vengeance an eye- opener. WWE seems to be in really bad shape, but more later, let me have a little summary of the matches first.

The opener between Kurt Angle and Randy Orton was average. They don't seem to harmonise very well, their match seriously lacked coherence. There was one good spot where Angle pulled off eight German suplexes in a row. Apart from that, nothing memorable happened. The ending looked forced.

Then we are forced to watch Eugene vs. Umaga. Now there are 10 minutes of my life I won't get back. No hard feelings, I have nothing against some well- placed, senseless humor in a PPV, it lightens things up, but this was just stupid, pointless, embarassing. It was apparently meant to underline Umaga's power, but failed big way.

At this point, pause your DVD, close your eyes, and think about the great matches Ric Flair and Mick Foley gave us. Flair Vs. Savage, Flair Vs. Triple H, Flair Vs. Hogan, Foley Vs. The Rock, Foley Vs. The Undertaker ... then push ""Play"" and watch the next 5 minutes of gigantic dissapointment, known as Ric Flair Vs. Mick Foley. Oh, with 2 out of 3 ruling, by the way. Not that it matters. For god's sake, if you have such a ruling, USE IT! Everyone knows that after the 1-0, a 1-1 has to follow to create tension. This kind of match has created dozens of fantastic battles. But this is over literally after 5 minutes!

This is a pure waste of a fan's time and anticipation.

Shelton Benjamin Vs. Johnny Nitro Vs. Carlito for the IC title is by far the best match of the evening. Hands down. Good, fast, well- flowing match with a couple of really exciting moments. Nitro and Carlito are two promising newcomers.

RVD Vs Edge was ... well, let me put it this way: had it been for the IC title, it would have been good. The match itself was indeed nice, but seeing these two fighting for the WWE title doesn't sit well. What qualifies Edge to be a WWE champion? What qualifies RVD? That they have been in this sport for more than 10 years?

Kane vs. Importer Kane wasn't even a rehash of Undertaker Vs. Undertaker, it was the rehash of a rehash of a questionable idea. That being said, seeing these two going at each other was actually pretty freaky. And THAT being said, I wouldn't watch it again.

The John Cena Vs. Sabu Lumberjack Extreme Rules match was as much a disgrace to its origins as the 2 out of 3 falls match earlier. A crash through a table and some moves with a chair doesn't make a match ECW- style. Every TLC match between the Hardy Boys and Edge and Christian from earlier times (god bless them) was more ECW than this.

By the way, this charade also lasted merely 5 minutes.

Now to the main ev ... wait, already? But we haven't seen anything memorable so far, this better be good!

So, the DX is back, huh? I sure hope this doesn't turn out to be as much a parody of itself as the ""2 out of 3 falls"" and ""Extreme Rules"" matches.

But it does. Triple H and Shawn Michaels give a little speech before the actual match, but instead of saying anything really funny or witty, they just bellow out their usual catchphrases.

The Spirit Squad is really a damn stupid idea, but they are unquestionably funny. More funny than the DX itself in this match, actually.

Triple H and Michaels aren't the DX, they are playing the DX, and that does make one hell of a difference.

Where are we at with this PPV? What does it do, where is its place in the long, glorious history of WWE/WWF PPVs? I don't know, but it's got to be somewhere at the rock bottom. WWE needs ideas, and it needs them badly. SO badly. Not so long ago, I didn't like the way they treated Chris Jericho. Today I would kill to see him back in the ring.

This whole Vengeance PPV feels like watching some strange revival show.

Hacksaw Jim Duggan, Doink, Kamala, Mick Foley, Kane Vs. Kane ... and Ric Flair. He's the greatest performer who ever lived, but please! PLEASE, Ric, if you want to continue to wrestle, Get. In. Shape! It looks like Foley is beating up just a really old, wrinkly guy.

And the DX won't survive very long, believe me. It will suffer the fate of the nWo. It won't take very long until Triple H and Shawn Michaels will face each other.

The only consolation can be that after great lows, there are usually great heights.

Please, wrestling fans, open your eyes! I've never seen TNA, but it can't be any worse than *this*!",1167955200,4,4619,4.386416861826698
