Drama/Suspense/Thriller/No Monsters/One Very Mean Lynx

The redeeming qualities of this film are that is was beautifully shot in the South African Bush, all the supporting actors did well, and the story is interesting: A 12 year old boy is incidentally left to fend for himself and watch their early 20th century isolated farm as his father is taken by the rest of the family to Cape Town for medical treatment.

He is left alone for 3 days with farm's herding dog Impie - Since he's alone most of his dialogue is said at his dog, and the kid frequently whines his dog name, sometimes over and over again, to the point where his voice is just irritating, considering it's the only one you hear.

As time passes farm animals continue to turn up dead and the boy does nothing out of fear. A lynx is caught killing a sheep and the boy starts and endless search for him which leads to the climax.

One part of this movie that really disturbed me is a fight between the lynx and dog. There's no way these two animals would roll around and play in real life, and the attack lasts for some time - (The boy of course doing nothing, prompting me to yell at the screen and shake my fist relentlessly) and the sounds from the dog seem like genuine pain. This seemed a bit cruel, but who knows, maybe the two were old college buddies.

Watch this if revel in obscure international cinema or you're interested in what South Africa loosely may have been like in the early 1900's, or if you like lynxes and love screaming at your screen in frustrated anger -",1307145600,,1571,4.456445993031359
