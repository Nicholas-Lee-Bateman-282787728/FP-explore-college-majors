3503580,5,B001C1G7KI,"Hey, it's Boston Legal-what's not to like?! This show has got something for everyone. The writing has been superb from Day One. The characters are glorious in their diversity, from Denny Crane (""lock and load"" as he steps into a stall in the men's room, sports section in hand) to the beleaguered Paul Lewiston, trying desperately to maintain a modicum of Old World decorum in the midst of a microcosm of America's increasingly bizarre socio-economic landscape. One of the basic premises of this show seems to be that there are no sacred cows-equal opportunity irreverence reigns supreme. Tell me that you are not thoroughly tired of the current state of PC (political correctness) which makes one reluctant to express any kind of opinion at all for fear of reprisals ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous. The good folks of Boston Legal never fail to show us just how ridiculous it has become. It's a big juicy slice of life with plenty of eye candy, lots of laughs and an undercurrent of caring and sharing that pulls it all together. The next time you have one of those days when you just want to crawl into bed and pull the covers over your head, lock and load some Boston Legal before doing the blanket thing. Works every time for me.",1222992000,23,1244,4.659090909090909
3503581,5,B001C1G7KI,"I did not watch Boston Legal when it was on TV i did happen to see an episode or 2 before it left the air. and thought i missed out on a great show. Funny as all get out...i don't care who you are it is funny... James spader and william shatner are such funny people...

i have only seen the first 2 seasons and i am in the middle of the third season but enjoying every minute. if you did not watch this when it was on tv buy it and you will enjoyin. and no comercials YEAH!

3503586,4,B001C1G7KI,"Lot's of good humor. Cases were more realistic in earlier episodes and mostly fanciful in later episodes. Case outcomes are highly improbable. .....It's fantasy after all, but a lot of fun.",1241481600,,189,5.129032258064516
3503587,5,B001C1G7KI,"Boston Legal was zany from the start and seemingly intentionally offensive to everyone at one time or another. As a political correctness freak (yes, I'm pro -- there are only about three of us left in the country and the other two aren't speaking to me) who is easily offended, I was surprised at how easily I embraced the show. Occasionally I'd be annoyed at a plot line that seemed virtually pointless until I tumbled to whatever was being said, sometimes about pointlessness itself. Frequently the subject matter was topical and handled with complexity (news shows, learn! learn!). Above all, I think the enduring contribution was the writing, but I suspect these particular actors were crucial. The acting was pitch-perfect, creating a brilliantly larger-than-life comedy that required actors to be nuanced multi-taskers. For instance, James Spader, completely believable as an aging womanizer offered equal verisimilitude as the brilliant legal mind who usually delivered the 11th hour summation. Candace Bergen, always a joy, created a persona with a sharp tongue yet consistent acumen and integrity (slightly straining credulity since she was meant to be head of a financially successful firm before the 2008 crisis). William Shatner had so much fun as the buffoon-savant, one could only laugh in horror at his antics. Many other skilled actors, famous and not, joined the cast for shorter or longer stints. And as the characters themselves said during the final episode, a cast of generally great actors (and older ones, at that) will not soon be seen again on a show this smart. Sigh.",1241049600,,1594,5.158301158301159
3503588,1,B001C1G7KI,"Would love to review the purchase, paid for the item and never seen a thing.....Puts you off when this happens",1241049600,,110,4.55

I love Boston Legal, I can't get enough of this show.
I'm sure I'll order the season 5 as soon as possible.
Order these Dvd's and I'm sure you will not be disappointed.",1240272000,,254,4.204081632653061
3503590,5,B001C1G7KI,"What a great set! The dvd quality is fine. A present for my wife at Christmas time. Boston Legal has such excellent writing and acting that its a joy to watch. We are parceling them out to make them last longer.

Good viewing!",1240012800,,226,4.255813953488372
3503591,5,B001C1G7KI,"Its a rare treat to find an entertaining program on TV anymore. The writers for Boston Legal do a great job keeping the viewer interested. The topics for the legal cases are often very thought provoking and do a good job of covering both sides of the issue. Having no legal background, I have no idea if the court sceens are realistic or not, but the interaction between the charactures is a class act.",1238630400,,402,4.445945945945946

3503594,5,B001C1G7KI,"I missed most of the first two seasons, so this package was a lifesaver!  This is rapidly becoming my favorite show, and having it on DVD makes it possible to watch whenever I want.  The extra info on each season is a lot of fun as well.  And since I have an upconverting DVD player, I get a cleaner picture than watching the broadcast, even though the broadcast is in HD.",1234656000,2,372,4.211267605633803
3503595,5,B001C1G7KI,What a shame that the best thing to hit TV in years has shot its last episode. I just have to own the series. What a fabulous ensemble cast! They will be greatly missed in our household.,1234396800,2,186,4.054054054054054
3503596,5,B001C1G7KI,We enjoyed watching Boston Leagle on TV and were sorry to see it cancelled.  They took on some very contiversial subjects and raised public awareness.  We bought this series to preserve those programs.,1234396800,,201,5.0606060606060606
3503597,5,B001C1G7KI,It arrived well within the estimated delivery time and I was extremely happy with the product itself,1234396800,,100,4.9411764705882355

3503599,5,B001C1G7KI,"I don't watch TV. I hate commercials. But I saw an episode or two of Boston Legal and decided to buy the whole series! I have now watched the 4 seasons I bought (when will season 5 come out? I cant wait). These are beautifully recorded and mastered; there is no extraneous junk on the disks like trailers and other nonsense. It is just pure, unadulterated, hilarious, profound, awesome, Boston Legal! They address every issue imaginable in the world today and do it with wit, with heart, and with soul. I love this series and will probably wear the disks out watching them!!!",1233964800,2,575,4.592233009708738
3503600,5,B001C1G7KI,"We loved Boston Legal and this was a fantastic deal to start our collection of this series with seasons 1-4.

Boston Legal was a fantastic series !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1233446400,,162,5.0
3503601,5,B001C1G7KI,"This is one of the most entertaining series my husband and I have ever seen.  The price is high, but it's well worth it.  We're lending each season to our son and daughter-in-law, and will then lend it to my sister.  So, a lot of folks are going to enjoy it for the price of one.  A real bargain!!",1233360000,,297,3.983050847457627
3503602,5,B001C1G7KI,"I was disappointed that my favorite show was over.  So I ordered the complete set, as I had missed the early years. It's a great thinking mans' show.  It was a back order, and was delivered when committed, and in perfect shape.  Thank you Amazon.",1233187200,,246,4.4222222222222225
3503603,5,B001C1G7KI,"This is David E. Kelley's best work. It will make you laugh out loud at the craziness that goes on at this law firm in Boston. It's the fast-paced life of high-priced attorneys. The camaraderie between Alan Shore and Denny Crane will make you feel like the world is a better place because of them. The depth of their friendship can bring you to tears of emotion and laughter. After the first disk you will love them both. You will not ever regret buying this set.
I am sad to see the show come to an end.",1232755200,2,504,4.206185567010309
3503604,4,B001C1G7KI,"My husband is a HUGE William Shatner fan....ME....not so much. I thought Picard was the better Enterprise captain.
Being a fan of The Practice, I was amazed at how great Boston Legal was. I kept telling my husband that he should watch the show, but he had a tough time not seeing William Shatner playing something other than Captain Kirk.
Then the reruns started playing on ION TV....and he was hooked! He's so excited about getting Season 1 thru 4 on DVD so that he can watch the shows in the order they aired an see the ones he's missed.
And I'm a HUGE William Shatner fan now also.
I will be buying season 5.",1232409600,3,611,4.321739130434783
3503605,5,B001C1G7KI,"I started watching this show around late November 2008.  It was very entertaining, full of suprises and so addicted.  I just have to watch it from the beginning.  Therefore, I decided to buy this package.
The only thing weird was some characters went missing without any explaination...and so I still wonder what happen to them ...",1232323200,,331,4.875
3503606,5,B001C1G7KI,Best price ever!!! Quick and easy!! Looked at Best Buy and could not even buy 2 series for the price of all 4. My purchase was new dvds and I opened an Amazon Charge and saved even more money! Pays to research a little bit since it was a X-mas gift for a Boston Legal Fan.,1232150400,,272,3.875
3503607,5,B001C1G7KI,"I love ""the boys"" as I refer to Alan and Denny. They never get old if you didn't watch the series buy these and see what you were missing.  I cannot wait for the final season to come out. This was a quality show that will be sorely missed, but you can get it on video, it was worth every penny.",1231718400,,294,3.819672131147541
3503608,5,B001C1G7KI,"I got this as a Christmas gift for my daughter and her husband and they were thrilled to receive it.  Boston Legal has always been a favorite show of mine.  I love the offbeat humor, and Spader and Shatner have never been better.  Terrific cast of offbeat characters!  Can't wait to borrow the series when they get done.  I will also be buying the 5th season when it's released.",1231632000,,378,4.420289855072464
3503609,5,B001C1G7KI,"The boxed sets of Boston Legal-Seasons 1-4 arrived earlier than expected.  The shows are funny, enjoyable, and informative for all of the adults in our family.  The series is also one of the most sought after DVDs to be borrowed by friends and family.",1231632000,,251,4.681818181818182
3503610,5,B001C1G7KI,I bought the set for my friend and we are really enjoying watching the series.  The characters personalities keep building with each event.  The topics are also very interesting.,1231632000,,178,5.103448275862069
3503611,5,B001C1G7KI,"Season 1 thru 4 of Boston Legal shows the changes the series has gone thru.  Of course Season 5 is the BEST SO FAR....Only wish the show was going to be continued....will miss all the up to date ""cases"" and the great cast.",1231286400,,222,4.162790697674419
3503612,5,B001C1G7KI,"Although I have not watched the DVDs, they were certainly welcomed as a Christmas gift for my daughter and son-in-law.",1231200000,,118,4.95
3503613,5,B001C1G7KI,One of the best series on TV in a decade. Current issues covering life across the board. An amazing blend of diverse dysfunctions among the lawyers and staff which worked. Morality and humanity wins again. BRAVO David Kelley.,1230422400,,225,4.947368421052632
3503614,5,B001C1G7KI,"First, I was very pleased with the very fast shipping from Amazon. I live in Canada and my estimated delivery date was about 3-4 weeks after I purchased. Much to my surprise, the videos came in less than 2 weeks.

The videos themselves are very nice quality with good-looking menus and bonus features. Each season comes in well-designed cases.

I would recommend this amazing value to any Boston Legal fan!",1230336000,2,406,4.785714285714286

3503616,4,B001C1G7KI,Boston Legal will make you laugh and cry. Create discussions with friends and family; make you think seriously about topics that previously merely fleeting thoughts.,1228694400,,165,5.64
3503617,5,B001C1G7KI,"Being a long time fan of 'The Practice', I had recently purchased the entire series and while watching the last few episodes realized I had somehow missed in RealTime that Boston Legal was the ""spinoff"" or ""continuation"" of The Practice. The courtroom drama with intimate knowledge of the every day lives and quirks of the characters has made me a HUGE belated fan of Boston Legal.  I have done more laughing out loud at television since getting this set than I have in years.  You just learn to love to hate and hate to love each character and it is almost seamless the way new characters come in almost unnoticed and long standing ones go without really missing them.  Great writing to character[s] and even better execution by the actors make this set a must have for the fan of courtroom type dramas.  This will be the fifth and final season for the show--I only wish I had discovered it sooner.  Hopefully there will be a spinoff"" or ""continuation"" of this series. This set is very clear [NOT DARK AND GRAINY] and of course without commercials.  Well worth the money!!!!!!  'DENNY CRANE'",1228089600,12,1092,4.65625
3503618,5,B001C1G7KI,I purchased this as a gift for my husband.  It is his favorite show and he just laughs and laughs everytime he watches an episode.  I plan to purchase the fifth season when it becomes available.,1226275200,,194,4.361111111111111
3503619,5,B001C1G7KI,"I had just started watching Boston Legal recently and was immediately enthralled!  The price for the 4 season was great and the show has lived up to my high expectations.  For me, William Shatner makes the show - the quintessential chauvinist pig who is lacking a very important social filter!  The characters are larger than life and it is pretty hard to imagine that people like these folks really exist - but I'm not watching it for the reality, only the entertainment value, which is huge.  A very imaginative, thought-provoking show that keeps the watcher coming back for more - that's my rating!",1225152000,8,601,4.805825242718447

8285651,5,B001C1G7KI,"My brother recommended this show and so we ordered the DVD seasons 1 - 4. We have been watching it for the past couple of weeks and love it. The only drawback for me was the inclusion of the actress (that's a stretch); Lake Bell. I couldn't have been happier when she left the program. Now it's better than ever. The interaction between Shatner, Spader and Auberjonois keeps us in stitches and second guessing what someone will pull out of their hat (rabbit) again and again. Superb!!!",1400198400,,485,4.586206896551724
8285652,5,B001C1G7KI,"She is a huge fan of the TV series, and of Shatner, so this was a no-brainer for a gift.",1372636800,,88,3.45
8285653,5,B001C1G7KI,"Topical satire wrapped up in a fun package. So preposterous yet rings true every time. When Alan gets in the courtroom nothing is sacred or off-limits. Denny is vulgar, pompous, yet teddy bear huggable. The supporting cast is superb. Never will there be another show that projects such a smart & humorous approach without 'dumbing down' or worrying about offending the viewers in the way Boston Legal did week after week. Miss it still.",1360281600,,436,4.905405405405405

8285657,5,B001C1G7KI,"This is a brilliantly funny series. I considered selling it but it has such wonderful moments in it, especially when James Spader and his best friend William Shatner end up dancing together or dressing as women, when they get married, and, yes, to each other. Priceless.",1274745600,,270,4.891304347826087
