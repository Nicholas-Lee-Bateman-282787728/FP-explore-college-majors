7624208,4,B01BCKV1HM,"The film has subtitles. I  enjoyed the first 3 shorts, the last one seemed out of place with the first 3.",1460764800,,105,4.0
7624209,1,B01BCKV1HM,You should have noted the video was in all spanish with no sub,1460332800,,62,3.8461538461538463
7624210,5,B01BCKV1HM,"I thought the first short was really great.  I absolutely loved it.  No sex, but at the end, that one kiss showed an honest well meaning affection between the two.  It did have subtitles, but really didn't need it..  The look on the face of these actors told the story. Well done!!!!!",1460246400,5,284,4.403846153846154
7624211,1,B01BCKV1HM,Terrible the whole thing is in Spanish with NO English sub titles  a waste of money,1459382400,2,83,4.1875
7624212,1,B01BCKV1HM,Why doesn't it say in the information that this is in Spanish and does not have subtitles?  What a waste of money.,1459123200,4,114,4.181818181818182

7624214,1,B01BCKV1HM,"Loved the first one -- a good story, well acted. The others, unfortunately I found pretentious and not interesting.",1458432000,4,115,5.105263157894737
7624215,3,B01BCKV1HM,"good find, great price..thanks!!",1469491200,,32,7.25
7624216,3,B01BCKV1HM,I guess its because I didn't read the prologue paragraphs for the last 2 short films but the stories are not about gay life. Maybe its only that they were written by gay men. The first story is definitely the best,1468800000,,213,4.219512195121951

7624221,5,B01BCKV1HM,"The first movie was great. Worth the rental fee. For those of you who cannot understand, turn on the Close Caption!!! It only takes a second",1465084800,,140,4.423076923076923
7624222,4,B01BCKV1HM,"This director has some amazing full-length films that have little to no dialogue yet tell unique powerful stories. This collection of his shorts gives a taste of his storytelling style. The first one here was my favorite. If you appreciate the homoerotic nature of these shorts you'll be blown away by his longer films that are cinematic works of art. If you're not sure you can handle 2 hours of m2m visuals, this could be an appetizer that will leave you wanting more. I'm always on the lookout for Hernandez' next project.",1464393600,,525,4.717391304347826
7624223,3,B01BCKV1HM,"The first short is outstanding in all respects. The two following shorts are ok. But the last two are out-and-out stupid trash, with absolutely no redeeming qualities. My three stars refer specifically to the first one",1463011200,4,218,5.083333333333333
7624224,5,B01BCKV1HM,"Ive been head cameraman (aka cameraperson) for 36 years for the likes of Paul Anderson, Brad Bird, Clint Eastwood, Martin Scorsese, and Steve Spielberg.  I watched this series of shorts, Mexican Men, with my grandson, who is shortly leaving to marry his boyfriend in Mexico City.  The camera work on the first short, Tremulo, is as good as it gets.  It's very good even for a big-budget Hollywood movie.  The camera is true to and captures the meaning, the move and angles flow, there's a constant continuity, clear and inspired messages are sent by moving body parts and facial closeups, it's not once over the top, and there's not one technique that is there to just show off the technique.  The facial coverage on the closeups was right on.  The circular panning to get everyone's perspective has just the right speed, perspective, and elevation.  There's action just long enough and then there's rest.  There's a visual rhythm going on.  What you see could actually happen to you and me.  This is a deliciously visual movie.  In the beginning, there's visual preambles to what's to come, such as when the younger man swings the older one up in the barber chair and the angle catches their lips symbolically crossing . . . the kiss to come.  The story, the dialogue, the acting, the setting, the camera work, the edginess, the sweetness, everything in this short is of the highest artistic quality. You put a lot of talent together and hard work and you can shot this type of artistic quality on a shoestring budget.  The men and women who shot the first short can work with me any day.  The other shorts are done pretty well and use good camera techniques and moody voice overs, etc.  Good luck.",1461715200,8,1699,4.673400673400673
8749783,4,B01BCKV1HM,Good overall. The story I most enjoyed was about a young soldier with a lower class kid who assists a shop owner.,1503014400,,113,4.181818181818182
8749784,1,B01BCKV1HM,"I think I accidentally clicked on this, but never wanted it see - who would?",1500163200,,76,4.133333333333334
8749785,5,B01BCKV1HM,"The first short was worth all the rest combined.  The next two were prosaic or too brief.  The last two were really gratuitous and had little to do with any homoerotic theme.  I can't find fault with *Tremulo*, the first one.

The ""plague"" one might have been the work of untalented film school students and the last was devoid of any discernible plot.  Watch this video for the first one.  Watch the first one five times and you'll still feel your time was well-spent. It might have been the first act of a five-act lyrical film.",1490140800,,530,4.46875
