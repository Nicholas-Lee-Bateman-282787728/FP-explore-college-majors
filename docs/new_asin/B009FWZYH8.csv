8541049,5,B009FWZYH8,"Only tried one workout so far, it does move fast. I am a beginner and very out of shape. I had to modify some of the moves and go at a slower pace than being shown, but had no problems getting through the short workout. I am looking forward to being able to work up to keeping up with those on the screen.",1431043200,,305,3.857142857142857
8541050,2,B009FWZYH8,"Alright, so here's the low down:

PROS:

* There are 3 workouts on this DVD, all 10 minutes each
* The Instructor is energetic
* The exercises he has you do don't last more than 60 seconds each

CONS:

* There is a three minute warm-up for each workout and you CANNOT fast forward through it. So if you want to do workout 1 and then workout 2, you will have to do the same warm-up twice
* In between the exercises you do, you always do the kettle bell two arm swing for 60 seconds, never anything else (this is for all three workouts)
* The exercises in ALL THREE workouts are the SAME, they're just jumbled up!  So for example, whatever you do in workout one, you will do AGAIN in workout 3, just in a different order.  Annoying.  I wanted different workouts!
* The instructor never tells you proper form for the two arm swing. You can see his staff raise their kettle bell up to their head and also doing full squats!  The two arm swing is a hinge at the hips with the kettle bell never going above your chest

I'm glad I got this DVD on eBay dirt cheap because I would be so mad if I paid full price. I don't know how the other Kettle Worx DVD's are, but don't waste your money on this one.",1381449600,11,1193,4.064102564102564
