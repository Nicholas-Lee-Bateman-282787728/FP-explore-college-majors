7798901,1,157560860X,"What was billed as a step-by-step breakdown of Black Sabbath's guitar styles and techniques is little more than anyone could pick up in an afternoon just by listening to the record. I bought the DvD for two songs - The Wizard and Wicked World - thinking that I would ""learn the trademark riffs and SOLOS"", as stated on the back. I thought maybe I could see some of the fingering Iommi does on some of his wilder sounding riffs and solos.

Well, for The Wizard, all you get is the opening chord riff and the verse. None of the breaks, no solos, nothing. I learned those parts back when I was 15 and barely able to play at all. For Wicked Word, a little more than that is offered. Anything involving REAL chops is not shown. I am wondering if Danny Gill can really play. What a waste of $18!",1262908800,2,789,4.26
