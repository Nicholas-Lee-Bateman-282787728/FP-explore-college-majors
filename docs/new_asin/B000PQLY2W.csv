8192978,3,B000PQLY2W,"This series of 1-2-3 videos is done well, good for beginners and laid out in a very clear matter.  The issue is that they are way too short.  20 or so clips, most are around 1 minute with 20 seconds of that being a repeat of what was covered the first 40 seconds.",1361232000,,263,3.943396226415094

You'll learn the basics of escapes in easy to follow steps and for boys who already are wrestlers this can be used as a reference guide on moving better and quicker or learn some new escapes that probably weren't taught the first time around.
