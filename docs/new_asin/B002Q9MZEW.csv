8377579,4,B002Q9MZEW,"If you're interested in Wildlife and the amazing creatures that walk our planet; You'll love this dvd. The Komodo Dragon is an amazing Reptile. This Lizard smells his Prey with their folk-like tongue. After one lunging bite the prey will die a slow and very painful death. The dragon's mouth contains a number of deadly and toxic germs and once bitten the deadly germs travel in the prey's blood stream.

In a matter of days the bitten prey suffers a sickness that eventually puts him down. A Komodo Dragon will follow the prey to near death or death. They are very patient and will wait as long as it takes the prey to fall; And then the feast begins. There are more ""Lizard Kings"" shown but the Komodo Dragon is TOPS, in my opinion.",1304380800,6,734,4.477611940298507
