8092712,5,B000BU0BAI,"Years ago, I used to tape the Caribbean Workout on FitTv, but I haven't seen it on TV in years.  I was so excited to find these DVDs on Amazon and I purchased several of them.  I attend hour-long fitness classes three times per week and I use these videos on the days in between to get a quick workout in.  I love that they are fast, easy to follow, and Shelly McDonald is such a positive, sweet person that her instructions are fun to watch.  Definitely recommend these!",1393545600,,471,4.258426966292135

8092714,1,B000BU0BAI,I bought this DVD as a true beginner to Pilates. I'm not out of shape or overweight but I want to make sure I'm doing the moves correctly so I can reap the full benefits of Pilates with out the cost of a class. I really disliked this DVD. The instructor was not annoying but the filming was. It seemed like they were more focused on showing you the surrounding birds and flowers then the instructor. What I was looking for was a nice and slow DVD that stayed focused on the instructor so I could watch her the whole time while trying to figure out how and what she was doing. Unfortunately I didn't get that with this DVD.,1349568000,2,622,4.191666666666666
8092715,5,B000BU0BAI,This is the cheapest price I have paid for an exercise video but it is easily the most encouraging.  I like Jen Tilley's chirpy instruction  and somehow the setting of the poolside is more conducive to following along than the typical blank canvas with the focus on the demonstrator and their outfit.  Sherry McDonald has amazing muscles but they don't distract or discourage.  This is not bouncey like most of the Caribbean Workouts that have seen on cable tv.  I recommend this dvd to everyone. It's not a stiff pilates workout and it will encourage everyone to do some moving around when they are lying around in bed or on the sofa in front of the tv or even the laptop.,1181952000,5,673,4.528925619834711
8092716,5,B000BU0BAI,"I recently picked up this program after really enjoying the previous Caribbean Pilates/Pilates Plus DVD's (which I've already reviewed on Amazon).

 This set contains three twenty-two minute self contained workouts that were formerly on the Caribbean Workout Show. Being from a TV show there are commercial breaks which fade in and out, sometimes more smoothly than others. Still, in spite of a few rough spots in that regard, these programs are really some of my favorite Pilates based programs along w/ the Caribbean Pilates and Pilates Plus.

 Their length makes them easy to fit in, the price is super low and you get a lot of workouts for that low price.

 The first workout has a abs/back focus and it's very well sequenced. Jennifer Tilley, who leads the workouts w/ Shelley Mcdonald as the ""student"", alternates between Abs exercises and Back extension exercises. Jennifer Tilley has an interesting approach to varying the ""classical"" Pilates exercises as well as the way she sequences them. For me it works very well and keeps things fresh.

 The second segment is a mix of Yoga type poses and Pilates exercises. It starts standing and then moves down to the mat. There's a nice mix of Ab core and back extension exercises as well a mini Sun Salute where you go from cobra into child's pose (she refers to these as up dog and down dog, but they are actually cobra and child's pose).

 This segment is very much a blend of Yoga and Pilates, more so than any of the other Caribbean workouts that I have.

 The third segment is primarily focused on the lower body and features a fairly extensive side lying series.

It starts w/ the hundred to warm up and then moves into the side lying position.

 The one thing that I wanted to point out is that Jen Tilley first does 4 or so exercises on the right side, then switches to the left side and does the same exercises. BUT then what happens is that she continues on the left side and starting with the Dvelopp on does a whole bunch more exercises and ends w/ small leg circles.

At that point after some gentle hip stretches, then she goes to the other side, starts with the Dvelopp and then completes the leg series on the right side. The thing I don't like about this is that even though the same exercises are eventually done on both sides they are not done in a symmetrical order which means the left side is really maxed out by doing them all in a row while the right side gets to rest and then complete the series after the left side is done.

Fortunately, if one is aware of this and wants to make it symmetrical, what you can do is, switch back to the right side when she starts the Dvelopp and then switch back to the left side when she does the Dvelopp on the right side.

 In spite of that workable imperfection, this is an enjoyable and fun DVD to work with that definitely works the areas intended. I gave it five stars in spite of the few imperfections because overall I think it delivers what it promises and does so at a ridiculously low price!

 I enjoy the personalities of the two teachers, the spontaneity of the way they interact and the scenery as always is beautiful. There is always nice gentle music during the Pilates sessions which enhances the overall atmosphere of the sessions.

 If you are looking for a more ""classical"" Pilates approach I would highly recommend Hilary Burnett's Intermediate program. If you've never done Pilates before I would recommend Stott Basics program for excellent detailed instruction. I have heard great things about the Hilary Burnett Beginner program but unfortunately don't have that one.

 Ana Caban has some nice beginning and intermediate programs as well which are based more on Joseph Pilates approach.",1145923200,20,3723,4.63013698630137
