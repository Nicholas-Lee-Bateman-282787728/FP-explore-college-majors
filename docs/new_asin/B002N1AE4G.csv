3953312,5,B002N1AE4G,"Darwin's Darkest Hour -- a new drama about Darwin's decision to publish his work on evolution -- aired 2009 October 6 on public broadcasting stations around the country.

I really enjoyed Darwin's Darkest Hour. The story used many flashbacks to briefly show us some significant points in Darwin's career and for the most part presented them accurately. The script used many quotations from Darwin's letters and books to depict him truthfully. The high prevalence of infant mortality in the nineteenth century was dramatically illustrated. Darwin lost two sons in infancy, but the most devastating loss was his daughter Annie when she was ten. That was the end of whatever religious belief he had left. Anne Darwin--who was lovingly portrayed in the drama in flashbacks--was Darwin's favorite child. When she died of scarlet fever, he wrote in his personal journal, ""We have lost the joy of the household, and the solace of our old age ... Oh that she could now know how deeply, how tenderly we do still & and shall ever love her dear joyous face."" Annie died in 1851, seven years before the major events of the drama. The drama depicts the death of an infant son in 1858 in more detail.

The main story is Darwin's emotional reticence to publish his radical theory with all the evidence he had compiled that proved its truth. He knew there would be a public outcry and the prospect was unpleasant to him, since his wife was a religious believer as were other members of his family and friends, such as Charles Lyell and Joseph Hooker. Finally Wallace's letter forced him to publish. Darwin's friends Lyell and Hooker arranged to publish simultaneously Wallace's letter and Darwin's earlier written--but never published--essay on evolution. After this was done Wallace gave Darwin complete priority when he learned that Darwin had come to the theory 20 years earlier and was still compiling evidence for his ""big book."" This book was never published in Darwin's lifetime but parts of it were published in The Origin of Species which Darwin quickly wrote using much of the information he had already compiled. The religious conflict between Darwin and his wife is mentioned but not really emphasized. Emma comes across as much more sympathetic to Charles and supportive of his goals than as someone who is hurt by his new scientific discovery that revolutionized the human relationship to nature and undermined Christian religious beliefs.

As is well-known, the joint publication of Darwin and Wallace's new hypothesis of natural selection had virtually no impact on biology, but Darwin's book about a year later finally had a major effect, since it had, in addition to proposing the hypothesis of natural selection in much greater detail, the much greater benefit of providing the abundant scientific evidence that species evolved, most of which was unknown to the public. Within a decade, evolution replaced creationism among almost all scientists and the educated public as the explanation for the origin of species, including humans. Natural selection, on the other hand, was not fully accepted by biologists until the 1930s, long after Darwin died.

The Charles Darwin depicted is very kind to his wife, explaining everything to her about his theory and asking for her help in editing letters and manuscripts. Emma is very supportive and enthusiastic for her husband's success. These two are the main characters of the drama, and both are portrayed by very attractive actors. I told my wife that ""Emma is hot"" and she replied ""Darwin is hot, too."" The story is a costume drama and very beautifully produced and filmed. A few minutes of extras at the end told us that all the scenes were shot in Nova Scotia, filling in for the beaches of Scotland and the Galapagos, the mountains of the Andes (with some CGI additions), the streets and buildings of London, and the English countryside, lakes, manors, and gardens.

Of great interest to me was the depiction of Darwin's father, Dr. Robert Darwin, who was the physician to many wealthy English aristocrats and businessmen and their families. His lucrative practice left him a wealthy man and enabled Charles to live the life of a gentleman scientist. Also, both Robert and Charles married Wedgwood daughters (Emma and Charles were first cousins!) who both inherited extremely large bequests upon the death of their fathers who were among the wealthiest men in England (and as has been recently revealed in Darwin's Sacred Cause: How a Hatred of Slavery Shaped Darwin's Views on Human Evolution, the major financial supporters of the successful abolition movement in Britain). In the drama, Robert is depicted as a ""Unitarian"" like his father, the famous natural philosopher and writer Erasmus Darwin, but in fact both were nonbelievers who kept their religious views very private. Robert's first son and Charles' older brother, Erasmus, not pictured in this drama, was also a nontheist. Charles had been prepared for the Anglican clergy and was slow to adopt the religious beliefs of his male family members, but eventually did so.

In the drama, Robert advises his son during a carriage ride to be very careful about publicizing his new theory of evolution, because it would strike against the religious beliefs of much of his family and friends, dishearten them, and perhaps damage his reputation among the public (as in fact happened to Charles's grandfather Erasmus when he was publicly denounced by a conservative British MP) . Since Dr. Robert Darwin died in 1848, ten years before the main action of the drama, this carriage ride was fictional and the scene was created for dramatic effect. However, the sentiments are genuine, since Robert, unlike his father Erasmus and eventually his son Charles, shied away from all controversy. The earlier scene in which Robert berates his son and initially refuses to allow him to journey on the Beagle is also true.

Darwin's Darkest Hour did not portray the loss of Darwin's faith due to the problem of innocent suffering in nature, a theological problem that theodicy, a branch of Christian apologetics, tries to explain. However, the new movie Creation, starring another beautiful couple, Paul Bettany as Charles and Jennifer Connelly as Emma, does deal much more with Annie's death, Charles's loss of religious faith, and the sensitivity of Charles's conflict with Emma's devout Christian beliefs. This movie finally found a U. S. distributor after some controversy, and I hope to be able to see it in the near future. When I do, I will review it here.

For more insight into Darwin's loss of faith and the reasons for it, see my essay on Darwin Day. Humanity should celebrate Darwin Day every year, for Darwin was the first to attempt to understand and explain the human mind's connection to biological nature, which was ultimately his greatest discovery and the one that still haunts us the most today.",1288828800,4,6908,5.0323426573426575
3953313,4,B002N1AE4G,"Darwin's wife was one of strong character grace. She was a very good wife and stood by his side through thick and thin. There are some tragedies in this documentary, but it was good nonetheless. Darwin goes through his accounts and discoveries as he comes to his conclusion of the theory of evolution. Even though his wife is a devout Unitarian Christian, she supports him fully. He goes to different parts of the world making discoveries,which all help him form his theories. Really nice addition to a blu-ray/DVD collection. Most know who Charles Darwin is, so I don't have to go into specific details of the movie. It's rather short, but a great source of history.

3953316,4,B002N1AE4G,"(written on October 19, 2009)

I was sent a review copy of Darwin's Darkest Hour, the two-hour docudrama from NOVA/National Geographic, which aired on PBS on October 6th. I watched it last week, and here are my thoughts.

I have known about this Darwin film since late July, and had been looking forward to it for several reasons. One, I wondered how it would compare with the docudrama portions of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Evolution-Darwin-s-Dangerous-Idea/dp/B001PYD0RK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Evolution: Darwin's Dangerous Idea</a>"" episode of the series Evolution that aired on PBS in 2001. Two, having anticipated (and still looking forward to seeing) the film Creation (open in the UK and elsewhere, not in the US until December) featuring Paul Bettany as Darwin since at least September 2008, it was good to see another production looking at the same time period of Darwin's life (the post-Beagle, Origin-writing 1850s). I of course cannot compare Darwin's Darkest Hour to Creation, but I might have a comment or two based on reviews of Creation elsewhere.

Darwin's Darkest Hour begins in March 1858 in Ternate (in present-day Indonesia). We see a man in his jungle hut, in a malarial fever, murmuring to himself ""Malthus,"" thoughts on human populations, ""external pressures"" as he jots down words onto paper. Before this scene ends, we see him preparing a letter to C Darwin Esq. This man, as we will find out soon, is Alfred Russel Wallace, naturalist and co-discoverer with Darwin of the theory of natural selection. It is this the delivery of this letter, from Wallace to Darwin, that becomes Darwin's darkest hour. (For more on Wallace's places of residence while collecting in the Malay Archipelago [Indonesia], see George Beccaloni's essay ""Homes Sweet Homes: A Biographical Tour of Wallace's Many Places of Residence"" in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Natural-Selection-and-Beyond-The-Intellectual-Legacy-of-Alfred-Russel-Wallace/dp/0199239169/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Natural Selection and Beyond: The Intellectual Legacy of Alfred Russel Wallace</a>, pp. 7-43.)

When Darwin receives the letter, then begins a whole dialogue between Darwin and his wife Emma about his having priority to the idea of natural selection. We are taken to defining moments during the voyage of HMS Beagle and through the pages of his transmutation notebooks via this dialogue (it is in this dialogue that some rather corny exchanges enter, for example, on being shown his Notebook D, Emma asks Darwin ""for the devil?"" - yes, we know Emma was religious, but seriously?). It seemed odd to me that, in the film, Emma becomes Darwin's supporter for ensuring his priority, and only after she and Darwin sort it out (mentions of his essay of 1844, a letter to Asa Gray, etc.) is it something that needs to be brought to Charles Lyell (I enjoyed this figure in the film) and Joseph Dalton Hooker (I did not enjoy the actor chosen to play him), men of high scientific standing who decide to have materials from both Darwin and Wallace read before the Linnean Society.

Aspects of Darwin's life that have become all too familiar are treated in this film: his wretched health, his dealing with the deaths of two of his children, the apparent conflict with Fitzroy over the literal interpretation of Genesis during the voyage. The death of Darwin's daughter Annie in 1851 - which some believe was the final straw in pushing Darwin away from Christianity, and thus allowing Darwin to further explore his thoughts on transmutation, and others not, most notably in the blogosphere Mark Pallen - occurs in Darwin's Darkest Hour as memories, while the death of a son (Charles Waring Darwin) in 1858, is treated fully. (The inaccurate order of historical events in Creation is the main critique of that film by science educator James Williams). The scene of young Charles's funeral is intertwined with the scene showing the reading of Darwin and Wallace's materials at the Linnean Society, which neither attended (Wallace because he was nowhere near London and Darwin because of the death of Charles Waring). I liked the back-and-forth of dialogue:

REVEREND INNES: ""Man that is born of woman hath but a short time to live, and is full of misery. In the midst of life we are in death.""

JOHN BENNETT: Extracts from papers by Mr. Charles Darwin and Mr. Alfred Russell Wallace: Part One by Mr. Darwin, ""On Variation under Domestication and on the Principles of Selection.""

REVEREND INNES: ""Of whom may we seek for succor, but of Thee, O Lord, who for our sins art justly displeased.""

JOHN BENNETT: ""Be it remembered, I have nothing to say about life and mind and all forms descending from one common type. I speak of the variation of the existing great divisions of the organized kingdom. Nature could effect, with selection, such changes slowly.""

REVEREND INNES: ""Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God of his great mercy to take unto himself the soul of our dear brother, here departed, we therefore commit his body to the ground: earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.""

JOHN BENNETT: ""We know the state of the earth has changed, and as earthquakes and tides go on, the state must change. Many geologists believe a slow natural cooling...""

Extracts from a paper by Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace, ""On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely from the Original Type.""

""One of the strongest arguments which have been adduced to prove...""

What I thought was nicely done is showing how Darwin's family was heavily involved in his work at Down House, the domesticity of Darwin's research. He was an unconventional father, very involved in the raising of his children, and at times his children became themselves scientific subjects. The scenes showing Darwin's children assisting, or being attentive to, his various experiments on plants and bees were my favorite, especially - and this should be no surprise - the scene about the seed dispersal experiments. Yet Darwin had his butler Parslow shoot birds for him, unlike in the film. [See Endersby's recent article on Darwin, Hooker, botany, and sympathetic science in the journal Victorian Studies.]

What I particularly liked about Darwin's Darkest Hour is that it did not take one single stance on Darwin's delay, the two-decade period in between Darwin beginning his research on transmutation and the publication of On the Origin of Species.  It brings in a little bit of many views historians have proposed: that Darwin feared public scrutiny, that Darwin feared conflict with his religious wife, that Darwin simply wanted more time to make sure his theory was right (in response to negative reviews of Vestiges of Creation [1844]), etc. (see John van Wyhe's article on Darwin's delay in the journal Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London). Brian of the blog Laelaps thought this inability for the scriptwriter to stick with one storyline made the film difficult to follow.

I do agree with Brian that the appearance of the actor who played Darwin (Ian Cusick) should have changed with how Darwin's appearance changed in real life, i.e., that Darwin, by the time he published&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Origin-Of-Species-150th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/0451529065/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Origin Of Species: 150th Anniversary Edition</a>, was balding and did not have the flowing hair of Cusick. Nice to see Wallace appear in the film, though I do not know if Darwin and Wallace met at the Linnean Society and Wallace being introduced to Lyell. I could not, however, believe in the actor portraying Fitzroy.

Although I felt I was being forced to watch Masterpiece Theatre, I do think Darwin's Darkest Hour is an improvement from the docudrama portions of ""Darwin's Dangerous Idea"" and could serve as a nice introduction to folks unfamiliar with Darwin's life. Do check out the various resources on the film's website, including a piece on Wallace by Sean B. Carroll (author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Remarkable-Creatures-Epic-Adventures-in-the-Search-for-the-Origins-of-Species/dp/0547247788/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Remarkable Creatures: Epic Adventures in the Search for the Origins of Species</a>), an interview with the scriptwriter, and the entire transcript.",1265414400,12,8436,5.461243284727551

Henry Ian Cusick as Charles Darwin, and Frances O'Connor as Emma Darwin.

This is a skillfully integrated drama about family and the personal life of Charles and that is inner dispersed with fragments of his work.

 This presentation is very slow paced with low-key background music. I do not know if this is for drama's sake or do you time to reflect. It starts out with Alfred Wallace, rival, trumping Charles on his theory of natural selection. The rest of the presentation is a series of flashbacks and unresolved scenes. Yet after a while, you forget that this is a stilted bunch of scenes and see a direction.

3953318,4,B002N1AE4G,"""Darwin's Darkest Hour"" is visually gorgeous, whether it's the many scenes in Darwin's upper-middle-class British home or the nature shots that are sometimes interspersed with them. It's also intellectual, consisting almost entirely of Darwin carefully explaining his theories to his wife Emma and his children. Never mind that in real life Emma had probably heard them all many times: The goal of this film is clearly to educate the viewer. I was hoping to learn something, because I'm an adult who does not work in the hard sciences and who has not heard Darwin's theories explained in detail since high school. It turned out that I've remembered all the material in the film, and have considered it part of the basic stuff that ""everyone knows.""  The film lacks real drama; it ends with Darwin receiving a copy of his just-published _The Origin of Species_, and does not enter the controversy that followed publication. Therefore, it was a overall a bit of a disappointment to me.

BUT, I think this would be a fantastic movie to show to high school kids, and younger kids with good vocabularies, to explain Darwin's principles of evolution to them. And, since theories of evolution have also evolved since Darwin, this movie inspired me to start reading Stephen Jay Gould's books.",1259884800,4,1284,4.967441860465116

Professionally, he had to struggle with what to do about a document from Alfred Russell Wallace who had independently discovered and written about natural selection.

Of the two films, this is more carefully made.

I've 2 eye witnesses on the 2nd watched) but I also do believe God existence as I find God's wonderful creation in me & other creations too. How wonderful is my mind & body work.

I can understand some scientists anti/ battle against religion and vise versa bcs they see each other in different angle.

Scientists see anything based on 100% evidence & logic way of thinking while religion(s) is made for human moral guidance only bcs in the past/ ancient time human were still wild/ sadistic. Sometimes religion could explain something but admits miracles. It also admits God(s) who created this life/ Someone who is(are) higher thn us while Budha doesn't believe in God but in reincarnation. Hwvr, correct/ true religion is teaching us about moral/ do good things for humanity. So scientists & religion they see something at different angle bcs they both are created/ exist for a specific job.

Science without religion is like human can understand how material works/ created until subatomic level (elementary particles) but they don't believe tht stones form SOS sign in a desert means someone is in danger. They thought those are created naturally.

8374522,3,B002N1AE4G,"Darwin's Darkest Hour is indeed very engaging.  The apologists for Darwin have crafted a delightful Darwin household where life could not  be  more ideal.  Darwin is a handsome and dashing young man,  Emma is a devoted wife that is fully interested in all of her husband's work, the children are never misbehaved, and even the Butler has the deepest affection for the youngest of the Darwin clan.  This unrealistic presentation of Darwin helps to sell the simple idea of the evolution of all life from the simplest forms over millions of years.

The movie focuses in on the year before Darwin publishes his famous On the Origin of Species when Alfred Russell Wallace has also come up with a theory of evolution that is much like Darwin's own.  The concern is who will receive priority for the theory.  In the movie this is the main concern of Darwin with help from his wife, but also it is of major concern to Darwin's colleagues Charles Lyell and Joseph Hooker.  The movie has Darwin arrive at an honorable way of obtaining priority but history  seems to indicate otherwise.

Ian Taylor, the author of In the Minds of Men which is also obtainable at Amazon,  has uncovered research that reveals a different Darwin, one that Taylor claims was part of a conspiracy.  Taylor writes that  Francis Darwin extensively edited his father's autobiography and his correspondence at the insistence of his widowed mother Emma, because that information was thought to be potentially damaging to the Darwin name.  But the correspondence has been restored through the notebooks of Charles Lyell and the 6,000 words Francis took out of the autobiography have been restored.  Taylor writes that the unexpurgated autobiography and the restored correspondence reveal Darwin to be less than the saint earlier biographies made him out to be.

A theme that runs through the movie is the intense opposition if Darwin should make his theory public since it runs counter to the teaching of the church, Christianity, and the Bible.  In particular Darwin is warned of the intense hatred he will face, and his family will face, once he publishes his book.  The movie gives no credit to Christians who will oppose him but without any malice which is what occurred in that century.  For example, the eminent London pastor Charles Haddon Spurgeon voiced his opposition to evolution, but without the slightest trace of the hatred the characters in the movie predict.  Also eminent scientists such as Lord Kelvin opposed Darwin, but I don't think anyone can find anywhere any expression of hatred on Kelvin's part.  Darwin was  no doubt hated by some people, but credit should be given to Christians who faithfully follow the Master's command to ""Love your enemies.  Do good to them that despitefully use you.""  In sum the movie presents a warrantless prejudice against religious folk.

In the 150 years since Darwin, science has shown him wrong and the Bible (which he and his disciples have tried to disprove) has shown to be correct.  Even Darwin's attempt to raise pigeons should have shown him he could not break the species barrier.  Darwin only managed to show that a pigeon will remain a pigeon.  The Lord indeed did create things to reproduce after its own kind.  And organisms have continued without any significant change over thousands of years as former evolutionist Dr. Carl Werner demonstrates cogently in his very readable book and DVD called Living Fossils.  He has found that  countless numbers  of organisms have not changed since the Cretaceous, despite the fact that evolutionists try to claim otherwise by  keeping this sort of evidence out of their museum displays.  Werner has found for example,  and this is a small example, practically every bird we know of today was alive during the time of the dinosaurs,  pelicans,  cormorants, owls, parrots, flamingoes, etc., etc.  And they looked then much like they look today.

As a science teacher I have found over the decades as Dr. Werner and many other's have found, there is not the slightest evidence for evolution.  Rather the evidence is on the side of the Bible - very much so.  Darwin and his disciples bit off more than they could chew when they assaulted the foundations of Christianity.

Finally the movie Darwin [and perhaps the historical Darwin] cannot believe that God could be a benevolent God since he observes that a certain wasp lays its eggs in a caterpillar to allow its larvae to eventually eat the caterpillar alive from the inside.  Well, evolutionists always find some fault with God's creation.  Another example is from the evolutionist, the late Stephen J. Gould, who pointed out the Panda's thumb as a reason to similarly find fault.  Other evolutionists have pointed out aspects of the human eye and how the light sensitive rods and cones are positioned incorrectly (according to them)  in the back of the eye.  What evolutionists fail to realize is the myriad ways in which God has provided not only for the animals but also for humans which are clear demonstrations of his care and his forethought for them.",1368921600,4,5077,4.916470588235294
8374523,1,B002N1AE4G,"Very mediocre acting and presentation of both Charles and Emma Darwin. The spoken text is often taken directly from Charles' writings and makes no sense in anything like a real conversation. If you are totally unaware of Charles Darwin's life, this _may_ be a gentle introduction, but frankly probably not worth your time. There are several excellent biographies of Darwin, of which I would recommend Irving Stone's as the most enjoyable read, or Janet Browne's 2 volume more up-to-date set. But almost any written biography will be far more enlightening about Darwin, his family and friends.

I can understand why the National Geographic Channel would be inteseted in presenting material on Darwin but the content of this DVD is poor in content, and awkward in dialog. Actully a surprising departure from the expected high quality production values of NatGeo. You should look at material produced by the BBC and David Attenborough.

But it turns out Darwin is a fairly good writer, and his 'Voyage of the Beagle' is a good read. Since he had not formulated his theory of evolution at the time, you need not worry about any religious conflicts and simply enjoy his adventure.",1330732800,,1175,4.989795918367347

This two-hour scripted drama tells the remarkable story behind the unveiling of the most influential scientific theory of all time, Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. The program is a special presentation from NOVA and National Geographic Television, written by acclaimed British screenwriter John Goldsmith and directed by John Bradshaw.

Darwin, portrayed by Henry Ian Cusick (Lost), spent years refining his ideas and penning what he called his ""big book."" Yet, daunted by looming conflict with the orthodox religious values of his day, he resisted publishing-until a letter from naturalist Alfred Wallace forced his hand. In 1858, Darwin learned that Wallace was ready to publish ideas very similar to his own. In a sickened panic, Darwin grasped his dilemma: To delay publishing any longer would be to condemn his greatest work to obscurity-the brilliant argument he had pieced together with clues from his voyage on the Beagle, his adventures in the Andes, the bizarre fossils of Patagonia, the finches and giant tortoises of the Galapagos, as well as the British countryside. But to come forward with his ideas risked the fury of the Church and perhaps a rift with his own devoted wife, Emma, portrayed by Frances O'Connor (Mansfield Park, The Importance of Being Earnest), who was a devout Christian.

""Darwin's Darkest Hour"" is a moving drama about the genesis of a groundbreaking theory seen through the inspiration and personal sufferings of its originator.",1299542400,5,1512,5.348739495798319
