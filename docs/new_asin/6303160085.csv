591959,5,6303160085,"The female lead is  interesting and sexy, and I think many woman will identify with her smarts, loneliness, and sexual passions.  The serial killer story line has tension and several twists, it keeps you guessing who the killer really is. Warning: this is soft porn-but ew la la, it is really luscious.",1179187200,4,302,4.788461538461538
591960,5,6303160085,"The plot is tense and tight, with an interesting surprise ending and while it earns its 'mature' rating, the sex scenes are engaging without being coarse. This erotic thriller has a subtlety that appeals to the 'bad girl' hiding in every woman.",1009411200,15,244,4.833333333333333
591961,3,6303160085,"This was an average movie, overall, but it had it's moments. What really makes the movie work isn't the action or even the plot, although those pass. It's the human drama, what a dedicated cop winds up doing when she is faced with temptation.
So, you don't want to know what happens in the movie, you just want to watch it. You'll follow a female cop on a murder investigation. You might find that it's a little long, too. It ain't over 'til it's over, but I don't think I could watch the whole thing more than once every few years. Not without getting stoned anyway, as this is a sleeper. But despite all that, the drama left a lasting impression with me.",987465600,11,656,4.341463414634147
591962,2,6303160085,"This movie had no plot, but Joan Severance has a nice body and is a decent actress.  I could not figure anything else out about it.  It reminded me of a another Shannon Tweed film, so that's why it sucked.",971136000,5,205,4.1

592006,4,6303160085,"This is a good movie.  It does not have a surprise ending but it was overall good.  Often I'll watch a movie is segments ( a little here, a little there) but this one I watched at one sitting.",1453507200,,192,3.8974358974358974

592009,1,6303160085,Even the sexy Joan Severance cannot save this hacked up R version of an erotic thriller.  It has some of he most banal dialogue that I have heard even for a B movie.  Mostly just a snooze.,1448323200,,188,4.054054054054054

592037,4,6303160085,"I enjoy this sexy erotic thriller about a tough as nails woman cop tracking down a psycho that cuts up women. You figure its like so many suspense movies , but there is lots of interesting twists and lot of nudity ( more than Sliver). Joan Severance gives sexy and tough performance & John Allen Nelson gives charming and mysterious performance & sex scenes are on fire. I seen a lot of erotic thrillers but this one would rank in my top 3. If you like Sliver , you will love Criminal Passion!",1425513600,2,493,4.311827956989247

592041,1,6303160085,"This is the first movie review I've submitted, but am doing so to spare someone else from wasting their time watching it.
I cannot recommend this movie. I thought every aspect of it was too ""over the top"", from the acting to the plot to the sometimes miserable musical score.
I forced myself to finish watching it, but am now asking why.",1403222400,,337,4.451612903225806

592043,4,6303160085,I enjoyed this movie - it is not a 5 but ok none the less.  There are others better but ok,1392768000,,90,3.2857142857142856
592044,3,6303160085,"I thought this was an interesting movie that had some twists in it. The girl was a cop and tries to solve a murder that is suspicious because it had the same ""MO"" of 4 other murders. She gets involved sexually with a very wealthy suspect and all fingers point to him. But everybody had an alabi. He had one also so it was time to start the investigation over. But her partner still said things did not add up and he wanted to prove it was the wealthy guy and to protect her from getting hurt. Can't remember the wealthy guy's name as I watch a lot of movies and read a lot. But, it was worth a look.",1383436800,,599,4.0
592045,1,6303160085,"Geez, am I the ONLY person watching Prime that would like to see a decent movie?  I got 1/10th of the way thru this and went back to read the reviews to see if I was watching the same movie reviewed by others as ""bad girl"" or ""character"" depth, and I could go on.  But yep, I was watchin' the same innocuous boring as hll, practically made for Lifetime t.v. movie.
I proceeded to fast forward it several mins at a time to see if I could find anything remotely worth watching.  Never found it.
I'll be glad when Prime has more then worthless movies to watch!",1382745600,,557,4.186915887850467
592046,4,6303160085,"I am a hugh fan of Joan Severance and this film is one of her best. The sex scenes are extremely hot. The story is very entertaining. The acting is good. I wish it was on DVD, I would buy it in a minute.",1234828800,6,203,3.6363636363636362

7840625,1,6303160085,I don't know what the film maker was going for more--gratuitous almost sex/voyeurism or a crime thriller with a little gay insinuation and a sexist mixed in to try to make it interesting. It misses any mark of being even a slightly interesting film. I kept hoping that it would get better but it didn't.,1458259200,,303,4.527272727272727
