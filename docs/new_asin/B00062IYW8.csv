2163379,5,B00062IYW8,"How can I not be happy with a brilliant series like the ""East Side Kids""?? Every movie has its own charm. The service was excellent and the product is what you would expect from decades old movies, actually better than most I have seen. A few skips or tiny imperfections on the screen but nothing that annoys or takes away from the entertainment. I highly recommend this.",1359936000,5,371,4.552238805970149
2163380,1,B00062IYW8,"He said it was kind of corny.  He wasn't sure if it always had been corny back in the day when he used to watch East Side Kids, or if this collection was just not his favorites.",1358294400,,177,3.7837837837837838
2163381,5,B00062IYW8,"A great story told in the early part off the 1900's life in the big city's, this is a great comedy thr stars the best",1357776000,,117,3.72
2163382,5,B00062IYW8,Delivery was on time as promised. I really haven't gotten a chance to watch the whole DVD but I don't see that there will be anything wrong.,1349654400,,140,4.222222222222222
2163383,1,B00062IYW8,"This disc is so compressed, that the movements look like painted animation! If Platinun Disc would release these as two to a disc, they would look much better. Don't bother with this 4-movie DVD, you can not watch it!

MR WISE GUY - Similar to the Alpha/Gotham edition but with more artifacting from compression. Watchable.

THAT GANG OF MINE - Unwatchable! So Compressed that it is annoying to try to watch. However, it includes a scene missing from the Alpha/Gotham edition.

GHOSTS ON THE LOOSE - Missing the opening titles! More compressed than other DVD releases of this title. I strongly suggest the VCI East Side Kids Double Feature version of this title.

BOWERY BLITZKRIEG - Good master, but compression shows. I suggest getting Platinum's individual release of this movie, it looks good.",1109289600,33,797,4.969924812030075

2163388,5,B00062IYW8,The bowery boys are the best - I ordered this as I use to watch every Sunday morning and laughed and longed for the friendship that these kids had.,1416441600,,147,4.103448275862069
2163389,5,B00062IYW8,Great video quality and price. What memories watching these again!,1405296000,,66,5.7

2163391,5,B00062IYW8,As a kid I loved watching the East Side Kids and now I own the whole collection.  East Side Kids Collection is fun to watch and great to introduce to your kids and grandchildren.,1377129600,,178,4.235294117647059
2163392,4,B00062IYW8,"The question when looking at these films is the quality of the print. I doubt the person who buys or considers buying this set is an East Side Kids novice. We have all seen them too many times to recall- the question is, how is the print? The answer is decent- better than a lot that are on the market but not to the standards of a true remastered upgrade.",1362355200,3,356,4.1
2163393,4,B00062IYW8,This is a bit more comedic than than the Dead End Kids but along the same vein.  Meant for those of us that never grew up.  It is fun to watch without having to think too deeply.,1361145600,,178,3.7837837837837838
8037722,3,B00062IYW8,"Five stars for the movies.  One star because they are not in chronological order.  I like to read series of books or watch movies ""in order"" so thiso really bugged me.  It would have taken Platinum about five minutes to do the research.  Instead, either the viewer needs to do it or be satisfied with characters that appear and disappear (from movie to movie) for no apparent reason.  Additionally, rather than a slowly improving quality, the quality of the movies just jump back and forth.  I'm still glad I watched these, but when I watch The Bowery Boys, I will use Google so I can watch them in order.",1521936000,,605,4.504587155963303
8037723,4,B00062IYW8,"When the movies you enjoy are over 70 years old, it's often difficult to find an adequate viewing copy. Lucky for us East Side Kids fans that this set exists; there isn't any better version available, especially not at this price point! The prints are pretty good and without any major flaws. Of course, I just require a decent, viewable copy as a fan; a real high tech cinema buff may have issues with the film transfer that I wouldn't even notice.

My advice: if you enjoy the antics of Leo Gorcey and his crew, and want a nostalgic trip in movie history, this is for you. If you desire and insist on top quality transfers and crystal clear picture, you should try the remastered Bowery Boys DVD sets and get your Gorcey nostalgia that way!",1513296000,,742,4.455882352941177

Wow!!! I grew up watching The Bowery Boys EVERY Saturday and I still do...  But, I love being able to buy the DVD'S and have the opportunity to watch it anytime I would like... It doesn't have to be a Saturday morning for me to enjoy... Thanks for selling an awesome product..

8037729,4,B00062IYW8,"Depending on the name - Dead End  Kids, East Side Kids, or the Bowery Boys - their names often changed but their characters remained mostly the same.  They were politically and grammatically incorrect.  They were kids from the bad side of town with hearts of gold.  Trouble could always find them and they or their families would usually find a way out.  No matter what, watching their adventures is fun.  There is always a moral to their stories along with some laughs.",1434672000,,470,4.670731707317073

8037731,5,B00062IYW8,"Good clean entertainment. Back then movies were fun to watch. Today movies and TV has gotten so bad it's full of sex, profanity and other kinds of immorallity. It's all about the dollar. Program quality don't mean anything. I like some of the slapstick just like the three stooges.",1432512000,,281,4.755102040816326
