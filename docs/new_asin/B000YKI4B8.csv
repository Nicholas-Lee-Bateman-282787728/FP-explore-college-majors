3030717,5,B000YKI4B8,"I considered myself a Dark Shadows fan...I bought all the VHS tapes and then when they went on DVD I bought them too!  Then they came up with the ""beginnings"". I didn't know anything about the ""beginnings"" until then.  I watched all the VHS tapes when MPI would release them and I was getting them on a monthly basis...4  a month and that was costing about $80 a month...so I put a lot of money in the VHS tapes.  Then I bought all the DVDs.  Now what I want to know is HOW MANY MORE DVDS TO I HAVE TO BUY TO HAVE THE FULL SERIES?  I actually thought I had them all before the ""beginnings"".  When I bought my first DVD collection, I thought that's where it started ...at the beginning.  I guess I should say that I didn't start watching my DVD collection until recently, because I had seen them again on the VHS tapes and didn't have the time to watch through them again.  So my question is what is MPI releasing now...How many DVDs are there in the ""beginnings"" episodes.  I for one think I've paid way too much money for this collection.  I just wished they had released a boxed set of all of them...INCLUDING THE BEGINNINGS!I rated this review, only because I had to to submit the question...well review of my question then.",1215734400,,1227,4.314410480349345
3030718,4,B000YKI4B8,"I got my first taste of Dark Shadows with the Laura Murdock Stockbridge story arc, and so I decided to start my collection just prior to catch the series on its supernatural upswing. Watching this set leaves me with the inescapable taste of frustrated anticipation.

The supernatural elements have started to creep into the show (no pun intended), but the focus remains upon the standard suspense elements. The Bill Malloy murder does bring a darker hue to the show, but it's really only with the harassment of Victoria Winters in the last few episodes that the series approaches its zenith.

At this point in time, the characters are not wholly developed, either. Roger Collins empathizes with Victoria and at times even acts like a gentleman; he has not yet settled down into the surly, old-moneyed sot of the later episodes. Victoria had not developed the fine art of remaining above the fray and tells lies to extricate herself from tense situations. Even Carolyn's emotions turn on a dime and as a result, she comes across as quite unsympathetic.

With all that said, the discs feature a handful of very good episodes, which depend upon the writing of Francis Swann and some especially sharp acting by David Hannisey. (Yes, he can be quite chilling instead of annoying.) Alexandra Moltke, of course, is the perfect gothic heroine.

The actual DVD case and the DVDs' physical appearance don't disappoint.  The inside liner notes briefly describe each episode and feature a press kit-style photo of Frank Garner's character. On each DVD, you can view all the episodes at once, or one-by-one. There are no extras, but there is an ad for a DS-related book at the end of each disc.

The hardcore Dark Shadows fan will find this collection worth every penny. I would rather it was a little cheaper myself, but I'm saving up for The Beginning No. 4, where the real fun begins.",1212796800,4,1874,4.822429906542056

3030720,5,B000YKI4B8,"I was introduced to Dark Shadows at the very episode where Barnabas arrives. It's true what they say-that he's very intruiguing and he makes the story and all of the characters soar. I've also heard that Dark Shadows struggled before Barnabas arrived and was almost cancelled. I gave the ""Beginnings"" episodes a chance, just because I wanted to know the backstory to a lot of the main characters. I can say wholeheartedly that I'm glad I did. Although seasons 1 & 2 instantly throw you into the chaotic & dysfunctional family life of the Collins', it's season 3 where things really heat up. I don't want to ruin the plot lines for anyone, so let it suffice that there are more murders, lies, and blackmail. There's no Barnabas but there's still that exceptional, theatre-trained cast who are absolutely superb. With the exception of the Simpsons and I Love Lucy, the Dark Shadows series is now among my favorite TV shows.",1210377600,12,921,4.7625

3030725,5,B000YKI4B8,"After months of sagging ratings, the fledgling soap opera Dark Shadows did, what in the words of its creator, Dan Curtis, no daytime drama had ever done: it went supernatural.

Following it's landmark premier in 1966, the first-ever gothic soap opera, Dark Shadows, settled into its afternoon time slot to haunt viewers with is unique blend of romance and psychological terror a la Jane Eyre. Unfortunately, viewer ship dwindled steadily, despite excellent stories and equally fine acting, which are clearly demonstrated in each boxed set of remastered DVD episodes from MPI Home Video.

The Beginning Set 1, reflecting the first 35 episodes of the series, introduced the characters and eerie atmosphere created by innovative sets and unforgettable original music that was the hallmark of the show for its five-year run; and The Beginning Set 2, which collected the next 35 episodes, built on that foundation by further developing the main characters and adding some new ones.

But, with The Beginning Set 3 the story gets more intense and leads up to the show's first and second ghosts, both harbingers of bigger and better things to come. Even before those crucial events, the supernatural begins to assert itself when a ""real"" crystal ball is given to young David Collins. Immediately, he begins to ""see"" things.

In this boxed set, the drowning death of Collins Plant Manager Bill Malloy is highlighted and becomes darker. In fact, it is his ghost that debut's as the first-ever depicted on the show, when his seaweed drenched corpse warns a terrified Victoria Winters to leave Collinwood or die.

Several episodes later, the young David Collins goes at night to the rundown and ramshackle family mansion, the Old House, where he looks up into the portrait of his great-great-great grandmother Josette Collins, the Lady in White. He implores her spirit to come to him as she frequently does when he needs help. Interrupted by caretaker Matthew Morgan, they leave the darkened drawing room together. Slowly, the portrait begins to shine and the music build. Then, a ghostly white figure appears to step down from the portrait and meander through the house and grounds.

Actress Kathryn Leigh Scott, who portrayed waitress Maggie Evans, was the ghost, saying she was the only actress on set who fit the clothing for Josette and who had a likeness to the portrait.

In addition to all of that, Burke Devlin (played brilliantly by Mitchell Ryan) declares an all-out war against the Collins family, promising to take everything they own, including the fishing fleet, cannery - and the ancestral family home: Collinwood!

Also of great interest in this boxed set are exterior shots, a rarity even today on soap operas. Shots included are of the Great House, the Old House, Widows Hill, Lookout Point and the beach below, Collinsport, the Collins Enterprises and Cannery, the Police Station, the Collinsport Inn, the Blue Whale, and the Evans' Cottage.

Show creators chose Seaview Terrace to represent the exterior of the Collinwood mansion. Located in the picturesque coastal town of Newport, RI, its imposing faade faced out to the edge of the Atlantic, just as writer Art Wallace had described in the original outline for the series. The privately owned house was patterned after a French Chateau, and was converted into student dormitories during the 1950's. It is currently leased by the Salve Reginia University, providing accommodation and classrooms.

Located near the mansion is the Cliff Walk and beach seen in several episodes, including the area where Victoria Winters discovered an incriminating pen that plays a pivotal role in this boxed set.

Also located in Newport, a little further down the coast is the Black Pearl Restaurant, the exterior of which was used as the Blue Whale. It still exists today, though renovations have changed the view commonly seen on the show.

Essex, Connecticut, was used for the town of Collinsport, Maine, including the Collinsport Wharf, Collinsport Enterprises, Main Street and the Evans Cottage. The exteriors of Essex's Griswold Inn was used for the Collinsport Inn and the town Post Office was used for the town Police Station.

Special features in this boxed set include: New Interviews with actors Alexandra Moltke (Victoria Winters), Mitchell Ryan (Burke Devlin), and Conrad Fowkes (Frank Garner.)

These early episodes occurred prior to the arrival of the vampire, Barnabas Collins, played by the gifted Jonathan Frid. Once Frid joined the cast, the show skyrocketed to iconic status. Many fans who began watching once Barnabas became a fixture on the show, never saw these early episodes, so it's wonderful to have them finally available on DVD, to see how it all began!",1195257600,67,4726,5.12077922077922

In his search for Victoria Winters when she went missing thanks to David Collins and his antics-locking Victoria in an abandoned room in the closed off west wing section Roger makes sure that he is all alone in the drawing room and that nobody is in the foyer. He grabs a flashlight and here is where we get a glimpse of a secret passageway in Collinwood. Roger opens that panel behind that chair against that part of that wall in the drawing room. Roger walks through the labyrinth of the closed off west wing and finds Victoria. He interestingly tries to scare Victoria away at the same time.

""Welcome to the beginning and end of the world, Miss Winters,"" Burke Devlin warns orphan Victoria Winters, after the long train journey from New York to mysterious coastal Maine. ""Dark Shadows""  was never a real ""soap opera,"" but a subversive, imaginative gothic with British sensibilities, where the mundane and ordinary mix with the extraordinary. The series delves in a darkness flavored by film director Val Lewton's artistic sensibilities. The narrative envelopes and captivates viewers in a coastal fog, unique to Collinsport, Maine. Spooky Collinsport is a fully realized little world. Time is not linear here, and it's especially jumbled on the Collinwood estate, a phenomenon intrepid viewers welcome. Inside the Collinwood mansion, heated discussions take place before constantly roaring fires and innumerable pots of tea. As the saga unfolds, it's a treat to observe the details in Sy Tomashoff's amazing sets, and Ramse Mostoller's costumes.

The underrated Bennett's deft talent and tremendous charisma boldly emerge in her films. As matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard, she just gets better as the series progresses, with her warmth and dry humor, and her fierce protectiveness of her daughter Carolyn (the remarkably talented Nancy Barrett). What expressive wringing of hands, what a regal coiffure. And what courage on her part to commit to such an eccentric, demanding project as ""Dark Shadows."" I highly recommend Joan Bennett's other film noir masterpieces, such as the captivating&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Reckless-Moment/dp/B004A30AW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Reckless Moment</a>, where James Mason falls for his victim.

This Collection focuses on Victoria in peril, suspects abound in the murder of Bill Malloy, with his seaweed drenched ghost delivering a warning. Matthew Morgan's bear-like figure grows in inexorable menace. The mundane web woven in this collection creates a wonderful stage for the strange, as the supernatural becomes a larger focus. Interviews with actors Alexandra Moltke, Mitchell Ryan, and Conard Fowkes are wonderfully informative as to the pleasures and the pressures of the cast and crew. How I wish Joan Bennett could have interviewed. Be patient, and your budding addiction will be rewarded. You might wonder where all the ghouls and horrors are. This early ""Dark Shadows"" differs very much from ""Shadows"" after Barnabas, it's a timepiece with a slower tempo, each careful increment leads to the eventual spook-fest. The mundane creates a wonderful stage for the strange, as the supernatural becomes a larger focus. Unseen ghosts of Collins ancestors roam the mansion, later, a ""cat"" enters the mansion and drops a book on the floor, startling Vickie and Carolyn. The ""Beginning Collection"" carefully constructs family secrets and a solid foundation for the later vampiric carapace. In an ennui of smoke, ashes, and burning cigarettes, the citizens of Collinsport, Maine, cope. Maggie Evans (superbly played by Katheryn Leigh Scott) works hard in the Collinsport Inn's diner/soda fountain. Notice the delightful menus, grilled-cheese sandwiches, hamburgers, and vintage low prices. All is as normal as Maggie's apple pie and cheap coffee, but an ominous darkness lurks around the diner's windows. Inside the diner, glossy cheeriness provides respite from the dogs howling in the darkness, while the Blue Whale Bar boasts a groovy jukebox with a relentless bleat. Real telephones aggressively ring, and vintage cars park outside. Though delightfully dated, the 1960s couture and coifs fascinate. The writing is remarkable, the outside-shots revolutionary for their time, and the black & white format is enhanced by the ornate sets. From the hulking Collinwood, governess Victoria Winters (Alexandra Moltke is perfection) opens each episode by describing the growing threats; the narrative is remarkably timeless. Remember, this is to us as the Civil War was to those in 1910, which makes the accomplishment of ""Dark Shadows"" all the more notable. I never saw ""Dark Shadows"" as a child, although I grew up in a haunted house on a ruined estate, with roads twisting into kudzu, mysterious gates in the woods, leading nowhere, and real live ghosts.

I crave Maggie's 1960s era grilled-cheese sandwiches, with white bread and slices of American cheese, and a side of tomato soup. Stock up on groceries, like clam chowder and ingredients for sandwiches, to sustain yourself during your ""Dark Shadows"" journey. An inexorable spell is cast on viewers, you may find yourself unable to stop watching, even as your eyes glaze over, unwilling to depart the peculiar environs of Collinsport. Warning: after hours of viewing, you may go through withdrawal, and wonder where the creepy, never-ending music is. Don't worry, just hum off-key, draw the curtains, and find comfort in that this collection of DVDs is colossal. It need never be too sunny again. Robert Cobert's superb&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Shadows-Soundtrack/dp/B000L43P4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Shadows Soundtrack</a>&nbsp;sets the mood for this delicious, languorous plunge into darkness. Why is ""Dark Shadows"" so relaxing? Perhaps it's that the denizens of the murky environs of Collinsport aren't concerned with the normal things in life, even when they discover missing cows drained of blood.

Rather than jump into the series post-Barnabas, ""The Beginning"" carefully builds a foundation for the later twists. Beginning with the ordinary only adds to the timeless authenticity of the complete series. This early work is worth understanding as part of the overall tapestry of ""Dark Shadows."" The entire cast of this little horror troupe is theater at its best; they deserve credit for a remarkable achievement that proudly stands the test of time. The marvelous cast of ""Dark Shadows"" includes Joan Bennett, Nancy Barrett, Clarice Blackburn, Alexandra Moltke, Lara Parker, Kathryn Leigh Scott (you may enjoy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Shadows-Return-to-Collinwood/dp/0938817663/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Shadows: Return to Collinwood</a>), Joel Crothers, Dana Elcar, Louis Edmonds, David Ford, John Karlen, and Dennis Patrick.

Real telephones aggressively ring, and vintage cars park outside. Though delightfully dated, the 1960s couture and coifs fascinate. The writing is remarkable, the outside-shots revolutionary for their time, and the black & white format is enhanced by the ornate sets. From the hulking Collinwood, governess Victoria opens each episode by describing the growing threats; the narrative is remarkably timeless. Remember, this is to us as the Civil War was to those in 1910, which makes the accomplishment of ""Dark Shadows"" all the more notable. I never saw ""Dark Shadows"" as a child, although I grew up in a haunted house on a ruined estate, with roads twisting into kudzu, mysterious gates in the woods, leading nowhere, and real live ghosts.

I crave Maggie's 1960s era grilled-cheese sandwiches, with white bread and slices of American cheese, and a side of tomato soup. Stock up on groceries, like clam chowder and ingredients for sandwiches, to sustain yourself during your ""Dark Shadows"" journey. An inexorable spell is cast on viewers, you may find yourself unable to stop watching, even as your eyes glaze over, unwilling to depart the peculiar environs of Collinsport. Warning: after hours of viewing, you may go through withdrawal, and wonder where the creepy, never-ending music is. Don't worry, just hum off-key, draw the curtains, and find comfort in that this collection of DVDs is colossal. It need never be too sunny again.

Why is ""Dark Shadows"" so relaxing? Perhaps it's that the denizens of the murky environs of Collinsport aren't concerned with the normal things in life, even when they discover missing cows drained of blood.

Rather than jump into the series post-Barnabas, ""The Beginning"" carefully builds a foundation for the later twists. Beginning with the ordinary only adds to the timeless authenticity of the complete series. This early work is worth understanding as part of the overall tapestry of ""Dark Shadows."" The entire cast of this little horror troupe is theater at its best; they deserve credit for a remarkable achievement that proudly stands the test of time. The marvelous cast of ""Dark Shadows"" includes Joan Bennett, Nancy Barrett, Clarice Blackburn, Alexandra Moltke, Lara Parker, Kathryn Leigh Scott (you may enjoy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Shadows-Return-to-Collinwood/dp/0938817663/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Shadows: Return to Collinwood</a>), Joel Crothers, Dana Elcar, Louis Edmonds, David Ford, John Karlen, and Dennis Patrick. Mitchell Ryan is pitch-perfect as Burke Devlin, we wished he'd remained for the duration of the complete series. The (child) actor David Henesy has amazing talent. The acting holds up today and even exceeds most standards; they are anything but afflicted with contemporary flat-affect shallowness.

3030760,5,B000YKI4B8,"I love the fact that the episodes are as they were. No clean up. Flaws intact. regardless, the first episodes before Barnabas were superior in every way. First of all, it was a top notch mystery. The B&W adds to the classic nostalgia of the episodes. Burke Devlin was a character you can hate but love. Up to this point no vampire appeared from a coffin so all of the supernatural was just in mind only. There were a few quick scenes of Bill Malloy and Josette Collins appearing as spirits after several dozen episodes. But for the most part the episodes were all based on reality and were very believable. Although the appearance of Barnabas was very cool and fun to imagine, let's face it, that was pure fantasy and all reality was lost at that point. I always loved the beginning episodes. I believe the acting is really noteworthy as well. The mystery of Roger and Bill Malloy's death and who Burke Devlin was and what was in the basement were very enthralling. I am very surprised that it took the arrival of a vampire to save the series from an early demise. The DVD's are worth it. I wish there was more bonus material and I also wish there was subtitles since sometimes it is hard to hear what they are saying. But all in all, this is a great collection and if you are a DS fan, it is well worth it at $26 a set! And no, I did not run home from school to see DS. But we were begging the bus driver to drive as fast as he could to get us home which usually allowed us to see the final 10 minutes of every episode.

3265215,4,B000YKI4B8,"I got my first taste of Dark Shadows with the Laura Murdock Stockbridge story arc, and so I decided to start my collection just prior to catch the series on its supernatural upswing. Watching this set leaves me with the inescapable taste of frustrated anticipation.

The supernatural elements have started to creep into the show (no pun intended), but the focus remains upon the standard suspense elements. The Bill Malloy murder does bring a darker hue to the show, but it's really only with the harassment of Victoria Winters in the last few episodes that the series approaches its zenith.

At this point in time, the characters are not wholly developed, either. Roger Collins empathizes with Victoria and at times even acts like a gentleman; he has not yet settled down into the surly, old-moneyed sot of the later episodes. Victoria had not developed the fine art of remaining above the fray and tells lies to extricate herself from tense situations. Even Carolyn's emotions turn on a dime and as a result, she comes across as quite unsympathetic.

With all that said, the discs feature a handful of very good episodes, which depend upon the writing of Francis Swann and some especially sharp acting by David Hannisey. (Yes, he can be quite chilling instead of annoying.) Alexandra Moltke, of course, is the perfect gothic heroine.

The actual DVD case and the DVDs' physical appearance don't disappoint.  The inside liner notes briefly describe each episode and feature a press kit-style photo of Frank Garner's character. On each DVD, you can view all the episodes at once, or one-by-one. There are no extras, but there is an ad for a DS-related book at the end of each disc.

The hardcore Dark Shadows fan will find this collection worth every penny. I would rather it was a little cheaper myself, but I'm saving up for The Beginning No. 4, where the real fun begins.",1212796800,4,1874,4.822429906542056

I gave the ""Beginnings"" episodes a chance, just because I wanted to know the backstory to a lot of the main characters. I can say wholeheartedly that I'm glad I did. Although seasons 1 & 2 instantly throw you into the chaotic & dysfunctional family life of the Collins', it's season 3 where things really heat up. I don't want to ruin the plot lines for anyone, so let it suffice that there are more murders, lies, and blackmail.

3265222,5,B000YKI4B8,"After months of sagging ratings, the fledgling soap opera Dark Shadows did, what in the words of its creator, Dan Curtis, no daytime drama had ever done: it went supernatural.

Following it's landmark premier in 1966, the first-ever gothic soap opera, Dark Shadows, settled into its afternoon time slot to haunt viewers with is unique blend of romance and psychological terror a la Jane Eyre. Unfortunately, viewer ship dwindled steadily, despite excellent stories and equally fine acting, which are clearly demonstrated in each boxed set of remastered DVD episodes from MPI Home Video.

The Beginning Set 1, reflecting the first 35 episodes of the series, introduced the characters and eerie atmosphere created by innovative sets and unforgettable original music that was the hallmark of the show for its five-year run; and The Beginning Set 2, which collected the next 35 episodes, built on that foundation by further developing the main characters and adding some new ones.

But, with The Beginning Set 3 the story gets more intense and leads up to the show's first and second ghosts, both harbingers of bigger and better things to come. Even before those crucial events, the supernatural begins to assert itself when a ""real"" crystal ball is given to young David Collins. Immediately, he begins to ""see"" things.

In this boxed set, the drowning death of Collins Plant Manager Bill Malloy is highlighted and becomes darker. In fact, it is his ghost that debut's as the first-ever depicted on the show, when his seaweed drenched corpse warns a terrified Victoria Winters to leave Collinwood or die.

Several episodes later, the young David Collins goes at night to the rundown and ramshackle family mansion, the Old House, where he looks up into the portrait of his great-great-great grandmother Josette Collins, the Lady in White. He implores her spirit to come to him as she frequently does when he needs help. Interrupted by caretaker Matthew Morgan, they leave the darkened drawing room together. Slowly, the portrait begins to shine and the music build. Then, a ghostly white figure appears to step down from the portrait and meander through the house and grounds.

Actress Kathryn Leigh Scott, who portrayed waitress Maggie Evans, was the ghost, saying she was the only actress on set who fit the clothing for Josette and who had a likeness to the portrait.

In addition to all of that, Burke Devlin (played brilliantly by Mitchell Ryan) declares an all-out war against the Collins family, promising to take everything they own, including the fishing fleet, cannery - and the ancestral family home: Collinwood!

Also of great interest in this boxed set are exterior shots, a rarity even today on soap operas. Shots included are of the Great House, the Old House, Widows Hill, Lookout Point and the beach below, Collinsport, the Collins Enterprises and Cannery, the Police Station, the Collinsport Inn, the Blue Whale, and the Evans' Cottage.

Show creators chose Seaview Terrace to represent the exterior of the Collinwood mansion. Located in the picturesque coastal town of Newport, RI, its imposing faade faced out to the edge of the Atlantic, just as writer Art Wallace had described in the original outline for the series. The privately owned house was patterned after a French Chateau, and was converted into student dormitories during the 1950's. It is currently leased by the Salve Reginia University, providing accommodation and classrooms.

Located near the mansion is the Cliff Walk and beach seen in several episodes, including the area where Victoria Winters discovered an incriminating pen that plays a pivotal role in this boxed set.

Also located in Newport, a little further down the coast is the Black Pearl Restaurant, the exterior of which was used as the Blue Whale. It still exists today, though renovations have changed the view commonly seen on the show.

Essex, Connecticut, was used for the town of Collinsport, Maine, including the Collinsport Wharf, Collinsport Enterprises, Main Street and the Evans Cottage. The exteriors of Essex's Griswold Inn was used for the Collinsport Inn and the town Post Office was used for the town Police Station.

Special features in this boxed set include: New Interviews with actors Alexandra Moltke (Victoria Winters), Mitchell Ryan (Burke Devlin), and Conrad Fowkes (Frank Garner.)

These early episodes occurred prior to the arrival of the vampire, Barnabas Collins, played by the gifted Jonathan Frid. Once Frid joined the cast, the show skyrocketed to iconic status. Many fans who began watching once Barnabas became a fixture on the show, never saw these early episodes, so it's wonderful to have them finally available on DVD, to see how it all began!",1195257600,67,4726,5.12077922077922

""Welcome to the beginning and end of the world, Miss Winters,"" Burke Devlin warns orphan Victoria Winters, after the long train journey from New York to mysterious coastal Maine. ""Dark Shadows""  was never a real ""soap opera,"" but a subversive, imaginative gothic with British sensibilities, where the mundane and ordinary mix with the extraordinary. The series delves in a darkness flavored by film director Val Lewton's artistic sensibilities. The narrative envelopes and captivates viewers in a coastal fog, unique to Collinsport, Maine. Spooky Collinsport is a fully realized little world. Time is not linear here, and it's especially jumbled on the Collinwood estate, a phenomenon intrepid viewers welcome. Inside the Collinwood mansion, heated discussions take place before constantly roaring fires and innumerable pots of tea. As the saga unfolds, it's a treat to observe the details in Sy Tomashoff's amazing sets, and Ramse Mostoller's costumes. Fritz Lang was an avid fan, having worked with the marvelous Joan Bennett; Dan Curtis was inspired in ""Dark Shadows"" by Lang's film, starring Bennett,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secret-Beyond-the-Door/dp/B0089LT800/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secret Beyond the Door</a>. The underrated Bennett's deft talent and tremendous charisma boldly emerge in her films. As matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard, she just gets better as the series progresses, with her warmth and dry humor, and her fierce protectiveness of her daughter Carolyn (the remarkably talented Nancy Barrett). What expressive wringing of hands, what a regal coiffure. And what courage on her part to commit to such an eccentric, demanding project as ""Dark Shadows."" I highly recommend Joan Bennett's other film noir masterpieces, such as the captivating&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Reckless-Moment/dp/B004A30AW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Reckless Moment</a>, where James Mason falls for his victim.

This Collection focuses on Victoria in peril, suspects abound in the murder of Bill Malloy, with his seaweed drenched ghost delivering a warning. Matthew Morgan's bear-like figure grows in inexorable menace. The mundane web woven in this collection creates a wonderful stage for the strange, as the supernatural becomes a larger focus. Interviews with actors Alexandra Moltke, Mitchell Ryan, and Conard Fowkes are wonderfully informative as to the pleasures and the pressures of the cast and crew. How I wish Joan Bennett could have interviewed. Be patient, and your budding addiction will be rewarded. You might wonder where all the ghouls and horrors are. This early ""Dark Shadows"" differs very much from ""Shadows"" after Barnabas, it's a timepiece with a slower tempo, each careful increment leads to the eventual spook-fest. The mundane creates a wonderful stage for the strange, as the supernatural becomes a larger focus. Unseen ghosts of Collins ancestors roam the mansion, later, a ""cat"" enters the mansion and drops a book on the floor, startling Vickie and Carolyn. The ""Beginning Collection"" carefully constructs family secrets and a solid foundation for the later vampiric carapace. In an ennui of smoke, ashes, and burning cigarettes, the citizens of Collinsport, Maine, cope. Maggie Evans (superbly played by Katheryn Leigh Scott) works hard in the Collinsport Inn's diner/soda fountain. Notice the delightful menus, grilled-cheese sandwiches, hamburgers, and vintage low prices. All is as normal as Maggie's apple pie and cheap coffee, but an ominous darkness lurks around the diner's windows. Inside the diner, glossy cheeriness provides respite from the dogs howling in the darkness, while the Blue Whale Bar boasts a groovy jukebox with a relentless bleat. Real telephones aggressively ring, and vintage cars park outside. Though delightfully dated, the 1960s couture and coifs fascinate. The writing is remarkable, the outside-shots revolutionary for their time, and the black & white format is enhanced by the ornate sets. From the hulking Collinwood, governess Victoria Winters (Alexandra Moltke is perfection) opens each episode by describing the growing threats; the narrative is remarkably timeless. Remember, this is to us as the Civil War was to those in 1910, which makes the accomplishment of ""Dark Shadows"" all the more notable. I never saw ""Dark Shadows"" as a child, although I grew up in a haunted house on a ruined estate, with roads twisting into kudzu, mysterious gates in the woods, leading nowhere, and real live ghosts.

I crave Maggie's 1960s era grilled-cheese sandwiches, with white bread and slices of American cheese, and a side of tomato soup. Stock up on groceries, like clam chowder and ingredients for sandwiches, to sustain yourself during your ""Dark Shadows"" journey. An inexorable spell is cast on viewers, you may find yourself unable to stop watching, even as your eyes glaze over, unwilling to depart the peculiar environs of Collinsport. Warning: after hours of viewing, you may go through withdrawal, and wonder where the creepy, never-ending music is. Don't worry, just hum off-key, draw the curtains, and find comfort in that this collection of DVDs is colossal. It need never be too sunny again.

Why is ""Dark Shadows"" so relaxing? Perhaps it's that the denizens of the murky environs of Collinsport aren't concerned with the normal things in life, even when they discover missing cows drained of blood.

Rather than jump into the series post-Barnabas, ""The Beginning"" carefully builds a foundation for the later twists. Beginning with the ordinary only adds to the timeless authenticity of the complete series. This early work is worth understanding as part of the overall tapestry of ""Dark Shadows."" The entire cast of this little horror troupe is theater at its best; they deserve credit for a remarkable achievement that proudly stands the test of time. The marvelous cast of ""Dark Shadows"" includes Joan Bennett, Nancy Barrett, Clarice Blackburn, Alexandra Moltke, Lara Parker, Kathryn Leigh Scott (you may enjoy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Shadows-Return-to-Collinwood/dp/0938817663/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Shadows: Return to Collinwood</a>), Joel Crothers, Dana Elcar, Louis Edmonds, David Ford, John Karlen, and Dennis Patrick. Mitchell Ryan is pitch-perfect as Burke Devlin, we wished he'd remained for the duration of the complete series. The (child) actor David Henesy has amazing talent.

3265256,5,B000YKI4B8,"In a New England riven with nonlinear shards of time, a train moves through the night, its windows casting the only line of visible light. ""Welcome to the beginning and end of the world, Miss Winters,"" Burke Devlin warns orphan Victoria Winters, after the long train journey from New York to New England's mysterious coastal Maine. Please note that MPI has released a less expensive version of this collection:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Shadows-The-Beginning-Collection-3/dp/B0070B9RLU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Shadows: The Beginning Collection 3</a>; I don't know if it contains the wonderful postcard and description of episodes.

""Dark Shadows""  was never a real ""soap opera,"" but a subversive, imaginative gothic with British sensibilities, where the mundane and ordinary mix with the extraordinary. The series delves in a darkness flavored by film director Val Lewton's artistic sensibilities. The narrative envelopes and captivates viewers in a coastal fog, unique to Collinsport, Maine. Spooky Collinsport is a fully realized little world. Time is not linear here, and it's especially jumbled on the Collinwood estate, a phenomenon intrepid viewers welcome. Inside the Collinwood mansion, heated discussions take place before constantly roaring fires and innumerable pots of tea. As the saga unfolds, it's a treat to observe the details in Sy Tomashoff's amazing sets, and Ramse Mostoller's costumes. Fritz Lang was an avid fan, having worked with the marvelous Joan Bennett; Dan Curtis was inspired in ""Dark Shadows"" by Lang's film, starring Bennett,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secret-Beyond-the-Door/dp/B0089LT800/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secret Beyond the Door</a>. The underrated Bennett's deft talent and tremendous charisma boldly emerge in her films. As matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard, she just gets better as the series progresses, with her warmth and dry humor, and her fierce protectiveness of her daughter Carolyn (the remarkably talented Nancy Barrett). What expressive wringing of hands, what a regal coiffure. And what courage on her part to commit to such an eccentric, demanding project as ""Dark Shadows."" I highly recommend Joan Bennett's other film noir masterpieces, such as the captivating&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Reckless-Moment/dp/B004A30AW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Reckless Moment</a>, where James Mason falls for his victim.

This Collection focuses on Victoria Winters (Alexandra Moltke is perfection) in peril, suspects abound in the murder of Bill Malloy, with his seaweed drenched ghost delivering a warning. Matthew Morgan's bear-like figure grows in inexorable menace; Thayer David is superb as the demented Mathew. The mundane web woven in this collection creates a wonderful stage for the strange, as the supernatural becomes a larger focus. Interviews with actors Alexandra Moltke, Mitchell Ryan, and Conard Fowkes are wonderfully informative as to the pleasures and the pressures of the cast and crew. How I wish Joan Bennett could have interviewed. Be patient, and your budding addiction will be rewarded. This early ""Dark Shadows"" differs very much from ""Shadows"" after Barnabas, it's a timepiece with a slower tempo, each careful increment leads to the eventual spook-fest. The mundane creates a wonderful stage for the strange, as the supernatural becomes a larger focus. Ghosts of Collins ancestors roam the mansion, a ""cat"" enters the mansion and drops a book on the floor, startling Vickie and Carolyn. The ""Beginning Collection"" carefully constructs family secrets and a solid foundation for the later vampiric carapace.

In an ennui of smoke, ashes, and burning cigarettes, the citizens of Collinsport, Maine, cope. Maggie Evans (superbly played by Katheryn Leigh Scott) works hard in the Collinsport Inn's diner/soda fountain. Notice the delightful menus, grilled-cheese sandwiches, hamburgers, and vintage low prices. All is as normal as Maggie's apple pie and cheap coffee, but an ominous darkness lurks around the diner's windows. Inside the diner, glossy cheeriness provides respite from the dogs howling in the darkness, while the Blue Whale Bar boasts a groovy jukebox with a relentless bleat. Real telephones aggressively ring, and vintage cars park outside. Though delightfully dated, the 1960s couture and coifs fascinate.

3265257,5,B000YKI4B8,"I love the fact that the episodes are as they were. No clean up. Flaws intact. regardless, the first episodes before Barnabas were superior in every way. First of all, it was a top notch mystery. The B&W adds to the classic nostalgia of the episodes. Burke Devlin was a character you can hate but love. Up to this point no vampire appeared from a coffin so all of the supernatural was just in mind only. There were a few quick scenes of Bill Malloy and Josette Collins appearing as spirits after several dozen episodes. But for the most part the episodes were all based on reality and were very believable. Although the appearance of Barnabas was very cool and fun to imagine, let's face it, that was pure fantasy and all reality was lost at that point. I always loved the beginning episodes. I believe the acting is really noteworthy as well. The mystery of Roger and Bill Malloy's death and who Burke Devlin was and what was in the basement were very enthralling. I am very surprised that it took the arrival of a vampire to save the series from an early demise. The DVD's are worth it. I wish there was more bonus material and I also wish there was subtitles since sometimes it is hard to hear what they are saying. But all in all, this is a great collection and if you are a DS fan, it is well worth it at $26 a set! And no, I did not run home from school to see DS. But we were begging the bus driver to drive as fast as he could to get us home which usually allowed us to see the final 10 minutes of every episode. What a torture!",1337990400,14,1536,4.1925675675675675

Collections 1 and 2 are good but the 3rd is better and by collection 4 the show is extremely interesting. The beginning collections are not as good as when Barnabus shows up but they are true classics. Lots and Lots of drama is the best part of this collection.",1315180800,,360,4.46969696969697

8233143,3,B000YKI4B8,"Barnabas doesn't show up in Dark Shadows until episode 200 something. The prelude to Barnabas and everything turning ghostly/weird and time travel is interesting to some and not to others. I wanted to go back and see how it all began and glad I did.  But most of the fan material on the internet is from episode 200 on....  Just a warning to those who are expecting vampires.  There aren't any for the first 200 episodes and I don't think he was meant to be long-lived (pardon the pun) but he became a fan favorite. I learned most of this from a great blog called DarkShadowsEveryDay which doesn't have the first 200 episodes but the history is SO interesting and I found it  Interesting how most of the main characters get shoved to the side for Barnabas, Julia, Angelique, Quentin etc...  later on. If you want to know how Dark Shadows started (and it was filmed live so there are many bloopers which are fun to watch), get this set.  Even though Barnabas isn't on it, if you want to know how it became a classic - get this to see how it started.",1505692800,,1048,4.376288659793815
