2245816,3,B0007VW29Y,"This DVD doesn't really give any information or techniques that you won't find in many other free or inexpensive information sources (internet, library, magazines, etc.).  If you're looking for a lot of info on eye designs or color choices for eye makeup, you won't find it here.  This DVD seems best suited to someone who wants to get a job doing makeovers in department stores, since it does show how to do day and night makeup for all races and those over 40.  It just doesn't go into great detail.  Also, the ""extras"" on this are mostly just excerpts from the DVD.  The ""tools"" extra is just a long panning sequence over a table set with makeup and tools - no commentary at all!",1166054400,5,682,4.467741935483871
2245817,5,B0007VW29Y,"I almost didn't buy the DVD after reading Cheri's review but then I went for it and boy, am I glad I did!  this is NOT a DVD for professionals, which is exactly what I was looking for!! I wanted useful, practical advice to improve my makeup. And this DVD gave me all that and more! It's great and I especially liked the fact that there are 3 well-known celebrity makeup artists. This DVD really has something for everybody, I threw a party last weekend for my girlfriends and we had a blast! We were able to follow the directions and apply the makeup for each of us! I don't know what the problem of the reviewer was, of course it's not for professionals, if you are a makeup artist you're supposed to know these things already! Bottom line, it's a great find and worth every penny!",1162857600,18,782,4.319727891156463
2245818,1,B0007VW29Y,"This tape is for the absolute beginner who knows nothing, and I do mean nothing, about make up application.  If you loved make up as a teen or have experimented as an adult, you already know everything shown in this dvd.  If you are looking for a tape that shows techniques for shading, hiding flaws, creating the kind of make up looks that you see in magazines, do not buy this tape.  I'm sure there will be women who will find this type of truly rudimentary explanation illuminating, but do not buy this tape if you want to learn professional techniques.  I was especially disappointed by title, it implied to me that there would be specific lessons in creating different looks, what they mean is there are two looks, (one for day, one for night) for many of the different ethnic models, and not even two looks for each of the models.  Really not a terrific tape.",1161820800,14,865,4.484076433121019
2245819,4,B0007VW29Y,"I've been borrowing lots of makeup books and some of them have been very good. Imagine my shock and pleasure to find this DVD in my local library. Anyway, nothing beats watching the actual makeup application and seeing for yourself the transformation. That being said, this dvd was great. The artists did it step by step and so it was easy to follow and imitate! I also liked the fact they had different nationalities as models (since I'm not white) and different artists. I preferred the guy makeup artists. My only wish was that they talked about the good colors for people (like different eye color goes with what, and maybe do it on the models, etc.) Otherwise, I love this dvd and I might even buy one for my collection!",1155772800,6,725,4.541984732824427
2245820,5,B0007VW29Y,"This video is really great.  It basically covers everything you need to know and shares great tips and tricks.  I really enjoyed the fact that the video had 3 different artists, so you had 3 different ways of doing techniques.  As far as the review being a waste of time, I have to disagree. It didn't show a lot about color but I think that is for the individual to interpret. The beauty of the whole video was about enhancing and not creating masks, which most people are looking for and are not getting from a cosmetic counter.",1143849600,13,530,4.387755102040816
2245821,5,B0007VW29Y,"I would definitely have to disagree with the woman from Canada because I found this video very informative. In fact, I've saved more than $1,600.00 so far by bypassing expensive sales pitches at makeup counters. The superstar makeup artists have great tips and demonstrate makeup techniques in clear detail-much better than in the stores. I would rather learn these skills sitting on my own sofa and practice on myself instead of going to Macy's or Bloomingdales or other department stores to learn.

A real classy video.",1139184000,28,521,5.058139534883721
2245822,2,B0007VW29Y,"I researched this title on Amazon and then borrowed it from my local library. I'm so relieved that I didn't buy it because it was not at all informative. I was looking for guidance as far as suitable eyeshadow/foundation/concealer for different skin tones as well as instruction on how to to apply them. While the makeup artists did give a tip or two, there was very little instruction or guidance provided. No more than I would have received sitting at a department store makeup counter anyway. The good news is that they used real, attractive woman (as opposed to supermodels with perfect cheekbones and flawless skins).",1139184000,12,622,4.877358490566038
2245823,5,B0007VW29Y,"Definitivamente es una herramienta sumamente util tanto para aquellos maquillistas profesionales como para aquellas personas que disfrutan del maquillaje pero a nivel personal. Aun siendo maquillista profesional, pude aprender muchos trucos que ahora pongo en practica no solamente conmigo, sino con mis clientes. Cada uno de los profesionales que aparecen en este DVD tienen tecnicas unicas y todas buenisimas, asi que uno puede escoger la tecnica o tecnicas que nos hagan sentir mas comoda. Los angulos son buenisimos sin mencionar la variedad de rostros que se presentan como modelos.  Para todo amante del mundo del maquillaje, este es un video que no puede faltar, lo recomiendo a todos !!!",1115337600,10,695,5.376146788990826
2245824,5,B0007VW29Y,"This is the third instructional makeup DVD I bought and it is far and away the best. The others PALE in comparison. What really makes this one amazing is the fact that the artists giving the instruction are the best in the business. These people regularly work on A-List celebrities.

I have only had it for a day and I've already learned a TON! I highly recommend this DVD!",1111881600,63,374,4.420289855072464

8052301,5,B0007VW29Y,"This is a good makeup DVD, very sensible and easy to follow.  I liked it because I could use all the cosmetics I currently have to do the makeovers which is mostly from my favorite grocery and drug stores and, none of the models are overly made up.  If I had to say something they need to address, is makeup for the senior ladies as not enough emphasis is put on women over 60, or maybe I'm not looking hard enough to find one that deals with retired women that still love to wear makeup.

HEY!  Wake up world, the senior population is growing.",1421798400,,544,4.201923076923077
8052302,5,B0007VW29Y,"This video is amazing to watch these pro's do makeup.
I was blown away at their skill as they take many different types of ppl and ages with these 3 magnificent artist.
They do top celebrities and its such a great tool to learn and see in a visual where a book can't as you watch this video you will see what I mean.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is trying to work on their own or other clients for special occasions.",1384041600,,424,4.0476190476190474

8052306,4,B0007VW29Y,"My main complaint is, I wish they would have broken down the steps, of the technique more and gone into more depth. The ""Extras"" section of this DVD doesn't really go into detail. I was a little dissapointed with this.  But they still gave some useful tips and it was very helpful actually seeing the application of the makeup. I still don't know @ paying full $25 price for this DVD.  I would try to find this used or in your local library.",1189555200,2,441,4.301204819277109
