8519816,5,B007O45CNU,"WrestleMania III:
What I can I say about this event that hasn't already been said for the past two decades? This was without a doubt in some people's minds the greatest WrestleMania of all time...and if not the greatest, then it ranks right up there in towards the top. This event held over 93,000 people in a record that still stands today since no other sport or entertainment event has been able to break that.  Matches include WWE Champion Hulk Hogan vs. Andre The Giant; Intercontinental Champion Randy Savage vs. Ricky Steamboat; Roddy Piper's retirement match vs. Adrian Adonis; Hart Foundation & Danny Davis vs. British Bulldogs & Tito Santana; Jake Roberts w/Alice Cooper in his corner vs. Honky Tonk Man; Junkyard Dog vs. Harley Race; Iron Sheik & Nikolai Voloff vs. Killer Bees; Butch Reed vs. Koko B. Ware; Dream Team vs. Rougeau Brothers; a six man mixed tag team match with Hillbilly Jim & King Kong Bundy captaining their team of midgets; Billy Jack Haynes vs. Hercules; and the Can-Am Connection vs. Bob Orton & Magnificent Muraco.
Disc one is the WrestleMania III version that you would see on WWE 24/7 or the WrestleMania Anthology DVD set that was released a while ago with the DVD extras in this disc are completely dedicated to the Savage/Steamboat match as the Saturday Night's Main Event match between Savage & George ""The Animal"" Steele which featured Ricky Steamboat along with promos & interviews leading up to the match.  Disc two is the same WrestleMania but this version is similar to the VH-1 show ""Pop-Up Video"" as facts & figures pop up on the screen at various times along with side comments from various people involved from time to time. This really helped you get a ""behind the scenes"" look at the event at some point as you'll hear from some of the wrestlers at the event along with comments from WWE superstars & legends.  The DVD extras on this disc are dedicated to the Hogan/Andre match as you get a joint interview by Hogan & Steamboat, the Saturday Night's Main Event battle royal involving Hogan & Andre, an Andre The Giant & Bobby Heenan interview, and the contract signing between Hogan & Andre.

Macho Madness: The Randy Savage Collection
Normally I would give an introduction to ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage but there's nothing I can say about him that hasn't already been said about him to the point where WWE doesn't go out of their way to promote & acknowledge him yet he's still remembered as one of the biggest names in wrestling history despite that with Matt Striker & Maria hosting this match anthology.
Matches include his WWE Debut; two matches against Ricky Steamboat include their classic at WrestleMania III; three matches against Hulk Hogan including a match from 1985 & their classic WrestleMania V encounter & their final WWE televised match in 1990; two matches challenging for the Intercontinental Championship against Tito Santana & Honky Tonk Man; Bruno Sammartino; two matches vs. Ted Dibiase including the WrestleMania IV WWE Championship tournament finals & the rematch in a steel cage; teaming with Hulk Hogan vs. Andre The Giant & Ted Dibiase; the WrestleMania VI mixed tag match with Sensational Sherri vs. Dusty Rhodes & Sapphire; his Retirement Match vs. Ultimate Warrior; his return match vs. Jake Roberts; four matches against Ric Flair including his WWE Title match at WrestleMania VIII, a WCW Championship match on Nitro, a Lifeguard (Lumberjack) Match, and a rare tag match with Bret Hart vs. Flair & Shawn Michaels; a rare WWE Championship defence against Michaels; his final WWE Championship match vs. Yokozuna; a Falls Count Anywhere Match vs. Dallas Page; and a tag match with Sid Vicious vs. WCW Champion Kevin Nash & Sting.
DVD extras include tons of past Savage interviews & promos along with various Savage moments like him debuting Elizabeth as his manger, him being crowned the ""Macho King"", the ""Match Made In Heaven"" wedding from SummerSlam '91 between Savage & Elizabeth.

WrestleMania III had so many WrestleMania moments from the birth of ""The Barber"", Piper's farewell, Bundy squashing the midget, the Savage/Steamboat wrestling clinic, and Hogan slamming Andre that you won't be disappointed. Savage's anthology was a nice retrospective of Randy Savage's career that I would recommend for any Randy Savage fan.  You can't go wrong with these sets together.",1343520000,,4350,4.960219478737997
