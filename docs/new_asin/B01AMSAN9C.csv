8747802,1,B01AMSAN9C,"Renoir is probably my favorite artist.  If my introduction to Renoir's work was based on this DVD I would never want to see anything he put on canvas again.  The images are distorted badly.  I have a 70"" screen and I truly wanted to like this disk.  What I got was a lengthy tour of Renoir hell.  On the other hand, I ordered another DVD called ""The Artist Series- The Great Masters"" with 145 Renoir paintings and it is HEAVEN.  It's a miracle that I paid only 2 dollars plus postage for this treasure.  I paid twenty bucks for the one I intensely dislike.",1494201600,,556,4.288461538461538
