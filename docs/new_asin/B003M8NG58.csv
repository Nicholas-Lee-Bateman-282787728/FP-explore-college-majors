4154402,5,B003M8NG58,"I feel like lately Big Idea has been coming with some very watered-down, unoriginal, and overlyloud productions. I grew up watching Veggie Tales and to be honest, at 20 I still watch them because I loved the simple stories and seeing stories that teach lessons that many of us tend to forget when confronted with the working life. I hated their last production, Pistaccio. I felt like there was minimal God in that video. It was more of an entertainment video rather than something to learn from. I especially hated how they just turned a disney movie into their own version. I loved Veggie Tales for their simple but creative stories, especially if they were stories taken straight from the Bible such as their Esther and Daniel productions. The name Sweetpea Beauty, threw me off cause it made me think that it was just another remake of a disney movie but after watching it, I actually liked it. They incorporated a lot more of God. I especially love their snoodle stories. I feel like the story may need some 'quiet moments' instead of every scene being so loud and full of attempted-jokes. But overall, i liked it and i don't mind watching this over and over. I do hope that Veggie Tales will make more serious, bible-centered stories in the future though! I loved the old, simple ones they did in the past!",1282089600,41,1312,4.635193133047211
4154403,5,B003M8NG58,"I have done A LOT of reviews for Veggie Tales in the past.  While the last few videos were...good, they were not up to past standards.  Again, I think this is due to the fact that Phil Visher lost control of Big Idea (get his book; Me, Myself & Bob to see how and why)  Anyway, many others have taken turns writing for Veggie Tales, not always a good thing. It seems that Phil is back!..with great results!

The first story is in my opinion is the best.  Snooderella is written in the same, and misty eye, manner as the orginal Snoodle's Tale.  I have to believe Phil wrote this one too.  A beautiful story about God loving us as we are.

The silly song, Pants was...well I found it somewhat annoying.  Although I have found myself doing the laundry while singing, ""they're pants if you short and shorts if you are tall""  But it is still pretty good.

Sweetpea Beauty was also a great story...though Sweetpea Beauty did give me a toothache.  But it really gave such a great point about seeing beauty and usefulness in EVERYTHING...even a skunk & worms.  Not something you would expect to see in a Princess story but so needed. And I have to say it was...er...interesting to see bushy eyebrows on a blueberry.

To some up, not the absolute best of Veggie Tales but certainly not close to being the worst.  I would rate it in the top 10 of Veggie Tales. Even those who are not big Veggie Tales I believe would love the message of this video.",1281916800,16,1439,4.357142857142857

4154462,5,B003M8NG58,"The instant I heard the title of the latest VeggieTales video, I knew what the theme would be.  Heck, I even guessed the verse we'd hear at the end of the show.  I mean, when you've got a video entitled Sweetpea Beauty done by a Christian company known for retelling stories to teach Christian lessons, what else would you expect?

This video is aimed more at girls than boys.  It used two princess fairy tales to teach about what God's considers beautiful.  That's not to say that boys can't learn from it or don't need the lessons here.  And I'm also not criticizing the video in any way because of it.  Many of the videos in the straight to video VeggieTales series are aimed more at young boys.  That's probably a combination of the dominance of male characters in the Bible and the fact that when VeggieTales first started using computer animated vegetables to teach morals, it was being run by a couple of guys who did pretty much everything themselves.  But I'm digressing.

Besides, this video is quite entertaining.

As always, the video opens on the countertop as Larry the Cucumber is attempting to figure out what kind of hat completes his look.  Not surprisingly, his insecurity ties in with this episode's letter (now submitted via video e-mail on QWERTY the computer, who we learn can talk).  In it a young girl is concerned about her braces and glasses and how she looks.  Fortunately, we've got two stories ready to go that talk to this very thing.

Up first is a return to the land of the Snoodles for ""Snoodlerella.""  These fanciful creatures look like a cross between a vegetable and a Dr. Seuss character.  And once again, our story is told in Dr. Seuss rhythm and rhyme.  Snoodlerella is the ugly step-sister who doesn't fit in with the fashion and beauty world of her town.  She gets an extreme makeover for the upcoming ball, but it will only last until midnight.  She is the hit of the ball, but will an encounter with the King change her opinion on her looks?

Our main story, however, is Sweetpea Beauty.  Surprisingly, this story actually borrows more from Snow White, although it does throw in a few references to other fairytales.  Queen Blueberry is obsessed with her looks because if she isn't the fairest in the land, she will lose her throne.  Meanwhile her son Prince Larry (Larry the Cucumber), has made friends Sweetpea Beauty (Petunia).  Sweetpea is a wonderful person who is kind to all the creatures.  She also happens to be fairest in the land.  When the Queen falls under the spell of a magic mirror, she targets Sweetpea.  What will happen then?

The first story was entertaining, and I am always in awe of anyone who can tell a great story in rhyme.  However, the second story was very entertaining.  They increased the number of jokes and managed to make some very funny spoof references to fairytales.  Some of the best laughs came from the two minstrels who narrate the story for us.  Because of the minstrels, we get several songs during the second story, although only one of them would be fun to listen to outside of this DVD.

And yet with all the entertainment, they still manage to remind us that God is more concerned about our heart than our outward appearance.  The first story focuses on the fact that we are God's creation exactly as we are.  And the second focuses on beauty fading but fearing God bringing us praise.

And, yes, there is a new silly song.  ""Pants"" features Larry as a salesperson on a TV shopping channel.  It's not the best silly song they've done (in fact, the best ones seem to be the older ones), but it is entertaining.

And speaking of songs, there is a new single by Nichole Nordeman that plays during the closing credits.  I was just wondering what she was up to.  Granted, this doesn't answer my question, but I'm hopeful this means we might get more music from her soon.

Because it retells princess fairytales, boys might turn up their nose at Sweetpea Beauty.  That's too bad.  It is an entertaining reminder of what God truly considers beautiful that everyone needs to see.",1431129600,,4062,4.611731843575419

VeggieTales always has Biblical principles in their films, and I want to instill them in my child as much as I can with the things she listens to, watches and reads.

This story is great for girls of all ages...even us moms who don't always feel our best!

There are 2 stories on this DVD - Snoodlerella and Sweetpea Beauty.

Snoodlerella is a parody of Cinderella and is about a little ""Snoodle"" who doesn't feel pretty. She has glasses, braces and bad hair. She gets transformed by her fairy godmother and goes to the ball. The clock strikes midnight and all her ""beauty"" disappears. She feels bad about herself, but the king sees her and tells her how beautiful she really is and ends up dancing with him.

Sweetpea Beauty has different glimpses of fairytales we all know including Sleeping Beauty and Snow White. Very cute when they add the different fairytales together. The queen is obsessed with being the most fair, but the mirror tells her Sweetpea is the most beautiful and will take the crown. Eventually the queen realizes how wrong she was about Sweetpea after Sweetpea tells her how beautiful she is on the inside, and that outward appearances don't matter in God's eyes.

This is a great alternative to the Disney Princess movies if you're sick of watching them!",1397088000,,1458,4.61003861003861

4154604,3,B003M8NG58,"Growing up from a Christian home, I was a huge fan of VeggieTales. I'm still an avid fan to this day; still collecting the videos and enjoying them with my family. This one caught my eye when I saw the cover, it was certainty much more pink than any other VeggieTales movies I've seen. Yeah, it seems Big idea is trying to branch out to the little girls for this one. That's a welcome idea, I do appreciate how Big Idea is trying to make VeggieTales more inclusive to all genders for this one.

The stories for this DVD focus on the importance of self respect. Another welcome idea, I think that's a wonderful message for children and adults alike and I kind of wish more children's shows would tackle it. It's a shame because, while I like the values being portrayed here, this VeggieTales kind of edges towards mediocrity.

This movie feels, for a lack of a better word, unfinished. Like I said, I like the message, and there are some decent songs in this one. But there's a lot of unfinished textures and rushed animation, and it gets pretty distracting. There aren't that many good jokes in here, and that's a bit of a let down because the humor of VeggieTales is always what made it's stories entertaining. I can't think of much for me to actually recommend it.

But if you have a son or daughter who really loves VeggieTales, and you want them to get good values out of their programming, then I guess this is harmless. But I'd personally skip it, it's not Big Idea's finest work.",1391212800,,1486,4.455882352941177

4154644,2,B003M8NG58,"This review is going to be short, although not as sweet.

My kids, 3 and 4 when we borrowed this movie from the library, couldn't follow what was going on. They didn't understand the motivations of the queen. They couldn't hear, and didn't know, a lot of the words in the rhyming story and the songs.

I don't know what it is lately, but it seems like Veggie Tales songs have moved from being something a kid could get stuck in his head, to something with witty, adult-reading-level lyrics that I can barely keep up with when I want to sing along.

I've been a fan of Veggie Tales since I took Rack Shack & Benny, which had just come out, into my high school to play Song of the Cucumber in my Spanish class. For those who aren't counting, that was about 20 years ago. I love the new characters, the fancy backgrounds, and in fact, I do often enjoy the movie parodies... but I don't like it when the storyline and the songs are too complicated to explain to the primary audience.",1379980800,,979,4.309782608695652

My sweet 5 year old sitting next to me watching wears glasses and has never felt ugly because of her glasses.  I distracted her but was sad to see that the storyline of Cinderella in glasses and feeling not pretty continues throughout the first story.
If your child struggles with feeling pretty - this dvd is for you.  However, if you have a little one with glasses or braces that does not struggle with feeling pretty - be careful!  We won't watch this again, because I don't want my glasses wearing little one to think that she might not be pretty!",1370649600,,776,4.3310344827586205
4154736,1,B003M8NG58,"Didn't anyone else notice that Sweetpea Beauty is very tall, thin, young, and insightful while Queen Blueberry is short, fat, old, insecure, and jealous/vengeful? This Veggie Tales episode reeks of Disney's ""beauty is good"" stereotype that merely perpetuates the idea that stereotypically physically unattractive people tend not to be beautiful on the inside either (and that those who are deemed more ""beautiful"" tend to be the good characters of the story). This idea is so deeply ingrained into our minds at a such young age that many of us don't raise issue with or even notice it. Teaching kids that beauty lies within is a great idea, but not when you have to shame particular groups of already marginalized people. Physical beauty does not and should not equal goodness in the same way that physical ugliness does not and should not equal badness.",1370563200,2,854,4.979020979020979

4154797,3,B003M8NG58,"My daughter is into princesses, so she loves the stories on this video. Personally, I found the songs less inspired than usual. The main song in the Sweet Pea story quickly began to irritate me, in fact. The tune, the irregular rhymes and rhythm...gah! Where is the simple song stuff? Don't make it complicated, like some weird early '90s love croon.

Then there's the editing. Seriously, guys, how can you put out a product this disorganized? In the Sweet Pea story, the queen's curse gives her blemishes, but in one shot right after she gets them, they're conspicuously missing. Later, the queen's crown gets stolen, yet in several different shots of her during that part of the story, she has it on her head again. It was so obvious that my eight year old noticed the problem. Fail.

Seriously, if this wasn't my daughter's favorite VT video of all time, I'd chuck it. It really feels like they just phoned this one in.",1358899200,,922,4.6503067484662575

Most of the feedback was really positive, so I bought it for my little girl.  She likes it.  Yes, I enjoy watching this with her, but there are a few things I didn't like.  One was the silly song.  The silly song is hilarious, its Larry trying to sell pants, like certain channels on TV.  The end made it very unpleasant.  Papa Grape pulls off pants from the two guys helping Larry.  For a movie that is suppose to be for young children, I find that very inappropriate.  Second, Sweetpea Beauty, as pictured on the front, has a very preachy, not very good acting voice.  She seemed to be trying too hard.  Other than these two things, its a really fun movie for kids.",1355184000,,789,4.299319727891157

Of all those movies, I think this her least fave but I think it's because she is too young to get the message and she doesn't understand that this is one of the first stories for little girls. I like this movie because it was cantered around two women with the Snow White twist.

It is a little darker than some Veggie tales, but a lot less scary than Disney's Beauty and the Beast or Snow White.  Our four-year-old daughter really liked it, and it was a nice counterpoint to all the vapid princesses she inevitably gets exposed to outside of our house.  While discretion is needed for very young children (kids are all different, and some would find it scarier than others), it should be more than fine for ages 6 and up.",1323648000,,600,4.387387387387387

I love the message that God loves you for who you are and that the world can't change that.  It's a good reminder of how much He loves His children and that each one is important.  It's full of your typical Veggie Tales jokes that apply to both children and their parents.  The Silly Song is fine, but not one of my personal favorites.  Nicole Nordeman's song ""Beautiful for Me"" is amazing and should be shared with all the people you love!",1323129600,,559,4.4411764705882355

4154922,5,B003M8NG58,"I'm 21 and I've always adored Veggie Tales...Junior is my favorite of the entire cast...oh the memories =D. I love it to be honest! I definitely cried (tears of joy) a bit towards the end of the story of Snoodlerella when she dances with a special someone (don't want to ruin it even though I understood the entire message just by seeing his silhouette just before he reveals himself). I must admit I watched it on the internet first but I have to buy it, I have to support this. This is a movie I want to have so that I can share it with my children one day (along with the CD's especially my personal favorite, Junior's Bedtime Songs). This is a movie that I will watch once in a while myself. Some may find that to be juvenile but when we live in a society that has an inconsistent and unrealistic standard of beauty, which neglects the oh so important inner beauty it is easy for even those who know better to lose sight of what's important sometimes. At those times you need that sweet and simple reminder of what beauty and love really is. 1 Samuel 16:7b My FATHER loves me for me. He sees in me what man doesn't. He thinks I'm beautiful even though I don't fit man's standard of beauty.
By the way ""Beautiful for Me"" song by Nichole Nordeman (the song played during the credits) is still my one of my favorite go-to songs. In fact, I was just listening to it. ""Has anybody told you, you're beautiful?"" LOVE that song!",1313539200,,1424,4.317164179104478
4154923,5,B003M8NG58,"I'm concerned about the person who reviewed this and said it was pushing outward beauty. There IS a moral to the story and I think that person completely missed the mark. The video teaches that outward beauty does not matter, that it's about what is on the inside, and quite frankly it does deliver that message successfully. There are a few glitches in the video... I think the QA/QC process was lacking before this was released from production. There is a scene where the queen's crown is floating down the hall behind her, and another where the mirror jumps forward before it has actually ""come to life"". Those are just two of the glitches, however, the video delivers an excellent message and is hilarious. My daughter absolutely loves it; it's one of her favorite Veggie Tales videos and we don't mind her watching it 500 times. :) I highly recommend this for any little girl. It lets them know that a woman who fears the Lord is much more important than focusing on outward beauty... that women are naturally beautiful because God made them. I think anyone who missed that message should consider watching it again.",1311292800,,1121,4.724489795918367
4154924,5,B003M8NG58,"We have all the Veggie Tales DVDs and, while we love them, think that some of the more recent ones have been less than par.  Not so with Sweetpea Beauty!  This one is cute, touching, values-based, and appeals to your little princesses and princes alike!  The messages in both Snooderella and Sweetpea Beauty are perfect, not commercial like ""Pistachio."" My childcare kids and own boys enjoy this.  They seem to like Sweetpea Beauty more than Snooderella, perhaps because of its length, but I LOVE the message in Snooderella and the rhyme scheme.  I'm a fan of the original ""Snoodle's Tale,"" too.  Sweetpea Beauty is better than the more recent Veggie releases, one that you can add to your collection knowing that you'll actually watch it again and again.  I have to admit that I find myself singing the silly song frequently with my kids, a strange habit of which I am not ashamed. :)",1308700800,,885,4.707792207792208
4154925,5,B003M8NG58,"My daughter got this dvd for her 4th birthday, and we really enjoyed it.  It was cute and sweet and had a great message.  Girls these days are really taught that how they look is the most important thing.  This movie tells them that their true beauty is on the inside.  I loved that it quoted the verse from Proverbs 31.  ""Favour is deceitful and beauty is vain, but a woman that fears the Lord, she shall be praised"" Okay, they didn't use King James, but it is the same verse.  It was cute how it combined all the princess stories. I thought it was a great movie, and I highly recommend it for all girls, especially for those into the princess theme.",1307923200,,651,4.252032520325203

4154927,5,B003M8NG58,This is a sweet movie that I purchased for my little girls about what it means to be truly beautiful. I was not disappointed. I want to reinforce the positive power of good character in a girl's heart and the impact that it has on her beauty.,1299801600,,242,4.170212765957447
4154928,5,B003M8NG58,"I got this for my granddaughter. She loved it! It basically tells the story of the princess and the pea, but emphasizes that beauty that is on the inside is more important than beauty on the outside. An important lesson for any girl to learn - especially when  she is pretty on the outside.",1298851200,,290,4.37037037037037
4154939,5,B003M8NG58,Glad to have this kind of message for girls growing up in the culture of too-soon grown up and thinking about outer beauty.  Good message for boys also to look for what is important in a person--the inner beauty.,1297555200,,212,4.435897435897436
4154940,5,B003M8NG58,Such a special story for everyone--especially girls!  My grown sisters and I even shed a tear at the precious message about the value God places on each of us!  A must-have--truly!,1293667200,,180,4.774193548387097
4154941,2,B003M8NG58,"We watched it on Netflix a few days ago.  Neither me or my wife liked it.

We own almost every Veggie Tales DVD they've released and our son watches the shows daily.  We love Veggie Tales and enjoy watching the shows with family.  Except for Sweetpea Beauty...

First of all, it looks terrible!  The graphics look worse than the original shows.  I don't mind ugly graphics but in this show there are no textures, things just looked terrible, there were bugs in the rendering, I felt like I was watching one of the first shows released.  (it's funny too, because it's a show about inner beauty)

If it just looked terrible I wouldn't mind but the story was bland too.  They felt empty.  Generally veggie tales is entertaining for adults and kids and has enough doctrine to give me things to think about but this show didn't work for me.  I felt like they just threw things out there without thinking through what they were trying to say.  Furthermore there was only one spot I even cracked a smile at.  I found the silly song just plain annoying too.

I agree with people that the shows have gotten shallow lately but I don't think this one was any better.  I'd encourage anybody to buy Veggie Tales videos, but not this one.",1291248000,9,1224,4.470588235294118
4154942,2,B003M8NG58,"I am a Christian grandmother and was in search of a DVD that would teach Godly principles to my beautiful granddaughter. A way to bolster the at-home teaching she's receiving that inward beauty is what pleases God.  I very much wanted to -- and expected to -- like this video, but just didn't.  There were several shorts including the Sweetpea Beauty and Snoodlerella.  The messages were just a little off to my way of thinking.

Snoodlerella really was an awkward, homely girl with glasses and braces and an abominable hair-do and of course her step-mom and sisters deride her. She gets a magical makeover and is the belle of the ball until midnight when once again the braces, glasses and hair reappear and everyone loses interest in her.... except for the king, of course, the God-figure who made her and loves her, who comes to dance with her. Disdain is shown by all other characters in the video for the plain, awkward child!  Not the lesson you want to teach a child.

Sweetpea Beauty is a lovely girl, but the messages that surround her story were again a little off and distracting.  Again physical beauty was glorified, even as they were teaching that inward beauty mattered most! There's got to be a better way to teach your little miss about inward beauty and take the emphasis off the outward looks. On the positive side, Sweatpea does have a beautiful voice and the songs were very pretty.",1289952000,33,1403,4.678861788617886
4154943,4,B003M8NG58,"Sweetpea Beauty had a lot of excellent points in it about the importance of looking at what's on the inside, rather than on the outside based on the 1 Samuel 16:7 verse ""The Lord does not look at the things man looks at. Man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart."" Our family especially enjoyed the Snoodlerella story.

I, too, was glad to see that VeggieTales continues to produce DVDs that honor God and make Him and His design for our lives a top priority. I would definitely recommend this DVD and have added Sweepea Beauty to my Mom-Approved Family Movie list on my blog.",1289260800,3,603,4.4818181818181815

My daughter is obsessed with dress-up and princesses but has also enjoyed other veggie tales videos. We tried this one and it is fabulous! So many girls of all ages seem to forget their worth and this helps to teach what beauty really is. I LOVE IT!!",1288828800,,376,4.309859154929577
4154946,4,B003M8NG58,You just can't go wrong with Veggie Tales.  They have wonderful stories with great morals.  This one makes reference to many fairy tales and it's fun to try to figure them all out.  Good times for kids and adults alike.

4154947,1,B003M8NG58,"I have a collection of Veggie tales dating back to the earliest ones made.  A few years ago, the producers sold rights to one of the networks.  This latest one is a product of the 'after' effects of that relationship.  The story line is much darker than you would normally expect from veggie tales.  You really don't get the message about true beauty at all because most of the talk and action is done between the queen and the mirror who wants to 'finish' the local maiden.  My almost 4 year old was scared and also the other day said, ""I don't feel pretty"" - she's never said anything like that in her life.  I asked her why she was saying that and she said because of the queen in veggie tales.  I promptly through the thing in the trash - don't buy this - it's just confusing and not a good wholesome presentation of true beauty.  Shame on veggie tales!",1285113600,25,857,4.279503105590062
