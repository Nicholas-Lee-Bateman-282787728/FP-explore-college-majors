6710811,5,B00O4UN8VU,"I found the movie to be engrossing. The plot takes you through four stories that touch upon a different aspect of learning to be comfortable in your own skin. It does not avoid depicting uncomfortable truths. But I believe that's what make this movie raw and authentic.

6710818,5,B00O4UN8VU,"Bravo Mexico!  This is, without doubt, the finest gay themed film I've seen in a very long time.  I don't speak Spanish so obviously relied heavily on the subtitles during my first viewing.  But, now I only need to 'glance' every once in a while.  I'll be watching this regularly for years to come.",1515974400,,298,4.462962962962963
6710819,5,B00O4UN8VU,"I don't usually write unless I am touched, moved, and inspired.  This film has hit on all three.  The innocence of a child, the honesty of age and the pain of choices.  And of course the promise of love and possibility.  At some point, I forgot that I was reading.  Alas, I don't speak spanish and had to read the english subtitles, which somehow disappeared  somewhere in the heartfelt tears.  I am proud of all the actors in this film for honoring their individual performances and respecting the roles they each played.  I'm guessing that most were not gay.  I am grateful that there are positive and honest movies that the young have to aspire to and the cliche is not overplayed.  I look forward to seeing more films such as 4 moons, and actively participating in the art of love.",1515110400,,785,4.50354609929078
6710820,5,B00O4UN8VU,Excellent Movie,1515024000,,15,7.0
6710821,4,B00O4UN8VU,"Realistic, tender, painful, loving, sad, lustful, desperate, joyful... endings and beginnings, discovery, passion, strength, and more.

The editing is fantastic: the segues between scenes, both within in a single story and from one to another, work so well together. Despite the differences in the current emotional circumstances in each story, they're all told in concert. By the end, I was swept away by the kindness, loss, understanding, hope, and love coursing through each story.

The music is well chosen, both in song and score.

The acting is spot on for the most part. There are a few moments that feel forced, 'performed' but, otherwise, oh my, most excellent. Their chemistry and openness make everything feel real. I was sucked in.

Fito's mother is honest throughout, so as we approach the crescendo of his story, every moment is one hundred percent believable. She taught her son well. His honesty, and belief in himself, embody strength and love. I routed for him, hoping he'd get his happiness, wanting the people in his life to love and cherish him.

Speaking of strength in character, young Mauricio has it in spades. He's full of fear, curiosity, conviction, and so much love. He's brave but doesn't realize it. It's a mark of a fantastic storyteller, and performer, to have your audience thinking about them long after the credits have rolled. I want to see him in 5, 10, 20 years. He's a good egg.

The Professor. He's got strength, and love, and is looking for some understanding, some reciprocation of recognition. He's much closer to the end of his life than the beginning but it's never too late. Another wonderful performance by the actor. He reveals the younger version of himself by just a look in his eyes. So well done.

Andrs, and his partner of about a decade. This story is a mixed bag for me. It's told just as well as the others, film work, music, everything is beautiful, meaningful. It feels a bit cliche and uncertain in its direction. On the other hand, that a story like theirs can feel 'everyday' is wonderful, how things should be.

I unreservedly recommend this film. Enjoy. :)",1513382400,6,2120,4.837016574585635

Also, the actors all did an amazing job portraying their characters.  I saw myself in each of these four stories and I believe many viewers will see themselves, as well.  My favorite storyline was that of Fito and Leo (who are both beautiful by the way).  No matter who you are, you will enjoy this movie.

6710843,4,B00O4UN8VU,"At times the subtitles display too fast, although they sometimes really aren't needed.  Multiple subjects with different cases within the same movie at the same time.  Very well done.  I only disagree partially with one regarding with the child.  The only person that made the correct statement was the priest.  It was never stated if the boy's foreskin was still attached or had he pulled it back yet.  The older boy was cut so he got to see it and was curious to touch.  If his foreskin was still attached, he's not seen his own head yet so that would have been a normal curious look and not a gay experience.  This doesn't mean it can't contribute to his becoming gay in the future.  My foreskin was attached when my brothers friend showed me his cut cock, and a number of my brothers friends and their older brothers showed me their cut cocks so they could look at my uncut cock.  And I grew up enjoyed you show me yours and I'll show you mine, often someone wanted to touch mine, even today at the gym.  And I am gay (no charge).",1473724800,4,1034,4.333333333333333

The Four stories are remarkable, and delivered the producers objective to see facets of love in various levels devoid of the Hollywood-style movies.  Pure, clean, deep, and challenging to the viewer.  The only other movie that caused me such joy was ""Beautiful Thing"" and ""Boys"".",1469318400,,379,4.597014925373134

6710849,4,B00O4UN8VU,"A very unique story. Four stories overlap themselves during the entire movie. It shows some of the problems that gays have during their lives, both when they are young and old. First discovery of gay awareness to long gay relationships. I have almost never seen a movie that has been successful in telling a story in this way.  BUT....The movie, ""The Tree of Life"" has to be the very best film that does this. But, you must understand that, ""The Tree of Life"" is a ten star movie.",1466985600,,480,4.454545454545454

6710855,5,B00O4UN8VU,Easily one of my Top 10 favorite GLBT movies of all time.,1462752000,,57,3.8333333333333335
6710856,5,B00O4UN8VU,"The synopsis is that we have four stories that are told in a linear narrative of four very separate and very different relationships. We have two old friends who had lost contact and get reunited and it is more than friendship that is rekindled. A young boy who falls for his cousin and he knows it is wrong for him to act on his impulses but the attraction is too strong.

There is also the story of an ageing and married poet who falls for a rent boy at the local sauna and the very real story of a couple who have been together where one feels it has gone very stale and does something about it. The link to the four tales are all about love and acceptance and are all about gay relationships.

To say anymore runs the risk of revealing the plot(s). However, there is so much crammed in here and not a single frame is wasted. It is at times painful, moving, touching and even funny. I was glued to the screen after a few minutes. It is 110 minutes long but feels much shorter and is in Spanish with the odd English thrown in and the sub titles are very good. This is from director Sergio Tovar Velarde and I tried t get hold of some of his other work and sadly not available in the UK. He made this in 2014 and has not made one since. I sincerely hope he does very soon  this is simply a fantastic film that I can only commend.",1462665600,2,1330,4.088122605363985
6710857,5,B00O4UN8VU,"What an extraordinary film!!  As most other reviews indicate: this movie should be at or very near the top of lists of all time best GLBT movies- right up there with Brokeback Mountain, From Beginning To End and movies with GLBT sub-themes like La Mission, Last Exit To Brooklyn, Monster, et al.
I require four (4) qualities to be satisfied with movies in order to classify it as brilliant and/or successful: First, a top notch script; second, brilliant acting; third superb directing & fourth, economical (excellent) editing - I don't want to watch a lot of fluff or filler material.  ""4 Moons"" (Quatro Lunas) score top marks in all 4 categories with me.  When I purchased this movie, I expected to see four ""shorts"" on one disc.  This film is not like that.
The four stages of Love/Life cover the gamut of a lifespan: two young (almost) teenage cousins with one having a crush on the other, while it is not being returned. The second phase is portrayed by two students (+/- early twenties) with a secret relationship because one of them is full-on still in the closet, and determined to stay there; especially his family is ""never"" to know about his homosexuality.
Third are two grown men in a ten year relationship when one of them starts looking and grazing on the other side of the fence (where the grass appears to be greener).  I had great empathy with this guy's reason as explained to his lover, why he was starting to look elsewhere for sexual satisfaction.  This third segment is extraordinary.
The final phase uses an aged married professor who becomes besotted with a male prostitute who initially shuns him (the professor).  The prostitute reveals later that he is not really into men; in fact he has a wife and family in another country and is trying the fastest possible way to earn money to bring them out to him.
The way the director successfully weaved these four phases in and out of each other is exquisitely done.  (I actually thought for a short while that it is one couple portrayed at different ages, especially because one the students could have matured into the adult who had the extra-marital affair.)
I cannot recommend this film strongly enough. If you collect/buy dvds - add this one to your list, because you will want to watch it several times.  I plan on doing the same.  Bravo!! - 10 / 10!!",1461024000,,2326,4.651219512195122

6710894,4,B00O4UN8VU,"Ok, now ... now we're getting somewhere.  Some of these gay themed films from Strand Leasing and the other one TLA I think, can be so ... awful. To the point where I have read reviews where customers have said that they don't have high expectations from gay themed films.  And I can concur. I've only seen a couple really good gay themed films, and by that I mean, gay themed films that left an impression on me, where I thought about it the next day, or saw it twice.  ""Strapped"" was one such film.  ""Latter Days"" another. I'm not talking about main stream gay themed films that became block busters like ""Brokeback Mountain"" or ""Priest"", but these lower budget gay themed films that not everyone gets to see. ""4 Moons"" is one such film. A film that has left an impression on me.  There are 4 stories, each one at a different point in a gay mans life - so to speak.  What I like most about this film, in profiling the different stages like that, it really hit home for me just how grey and vast sexuality is.  One really cannot pigeonhole or pinpoint sexuality and say, ""Its this or that"", ""It's like this or it's like that"". This film does a good job at showing one the vastness of LGBT situations. And ... a couple of those ""moons"" brought back memories of my own experiences.  The two cousins' for instance. I remember when I was a kid having a moment with a friend of mine, similar to theirs. The couple that was struggling with fidelity. One of the men, was trying to ""curb"" or ""change"" his partners behaviors. I remember going through a similar situation. However, the most poignant moon, I believe it was called ""Waning Moon"", is the one that sticks with me the most.  It truly is a testament to ""how well do you really know your partner or spouse?"" If anything, it definitely is a testament as to how grey sexuality is.",1431734400,,1828,4.384615384615385

6710904,3,B00O4UN8VU,"What starts out as 4 romantic and compelling stories ultimately becomes bogged down by the weight of Velarde's dismal vision of homosexuality.  Apparently even in 2014 being gay means a life of longing, sadness, infidelity, lies, prostitution, anonymous sex, and self-loathing, with only fleeting glimpses of joy.  On a positive note, the acting was surprisingly good, and kept me going through the mostly bitter end.",1428537600,3,417,5.4

Not only are the four interweaving stories touching and loving and insightful, they are profound and I suspect anyone can relate to them, especially if you are gay, but even if you're not. These themes of longing for love and being repeatedly frustrated in its search are themes everyone can relate to. I strongly recommend this film.",1428364800,15,472,4.436781609195402

There is tenderness for one couple, heartache for another, disappointment, followed by acceptance for the other two characters. It is well acted and the stories are totally believable. You smile at some, you cry with others, you worry and you applaud their individual bravery. I think we could've done without the old man and the young boy, but I can also see where their stories are relevant to what can happen, and does happen, in real life to people in similar situations. I also liked the male prostitute... he totally redeems himself. I have already recommended this movie to others because it is one of the VERY BEST gay movies I have watched in recent times.",1425945600,,767,4.731343283582089

I wasn't crazy about the music, but that's subjective. I have to say this is the best Mexican movie I have ever seen. 4 different gay stories occurring simultaneously, and I cannot imagine any gay person not being able to relate to the universal themes presented in each. Plenty of skin offered in softcore flavor. The ONLY issue I had with the movie is that the dialogue and subtitles are pretty fast and I had to watch it at .08 speed to follow it.

It is extremely rare that we see a film  about gay children. They  almost never  exist in gay USA cinema..If only they could make  great gay movies in the USA.

6710953,5,B00O4UN8VU,"It is not often a five star film comes along, so when one does, five stars is deserved and in this case, well-deserved. This film is beautifully constructed and if it were a musical performance, it would be virtuosic! The stories are revealed in a concise, almost spare manner and yet there is such detail and texture that you instantly know and feel the context without a word of dialogue needing to be spoken. All of the stories are poignant and cleverly juxtaposed one against the other, providing an interesting spectrum of the human experience, not just gay individuals. For example, the young boy, who knows, discovers and accepts that he is gay; is juxtaposed against the college student who knows he is gay, yet has been inculcated and socialized to suppress it as if it were something of which to be ashamed. The subtle, powerful ending for these two individuals, will bring tears to your eyes. The underlying theme of the film is remarkable, such that we understand the filmmakers (writer, director, actors, et al) are saying: Homosexuality is for some, perhaps many, a life journey that involves interesting and surprising twists, turns, disappointments, etc. It is not a ""lifestyle"" that can be discarded as a pair of old shoes. For some, perhaps many, it is as integral to one's character, regardless of whether you perceive yourself as straight or gay and regardless of your age, place, or station in life. Gore Vidal said that everyone is bisexual and for two of the characters in this film, that seems to be the case. For example, the professor-poet, married with daughters and a loving wife and the hustler, married with a kid, both seeking, reaching-out to each other for reasons far beyond the sexual experience. It is NOT always about the sex for some, or maybe it is the sex AND something else, something practical or something mystical. Again, such storytelling as layered and textured as this, is highly artistic, but accessible. Five stars, FIVE BIG STARS, to the makers of this film.",1424304000,2,2008,4.857142857142857

I must say, I was moved emotionally beyond almost any other movie I have ever seen in my entire life. The script is unique, eloquent and perfectly written. The cinematography is realistic and never goes beyond cultivating reality that is truthful and beautiful at the same time. The acting is exemplary from all of the different characters. And the Director has outdone many American movies I have seen, and has put himself humbly in a class with the finest directors ever. I smiled, I laughed, I frowned, I cried over and over again. My heart was moved in every direction...effortlessly. Everyone must go see this,no matter who you are. Each story intertwines with the others, and all contain issues about life that all of us have encountered, to some degree or another. This is what a movie should be, and what it should contain.

6710987,5,B00O4UN8VU,"4 Moons is an extraordinarily ambitious and original movie that almost completely succeeds.

It is not a collection of short movies, but it tells four separate stories. Each story corresponds to one of the four phases of the moon: new, half waxing, full, and half waning; and each has a gay protagonist at a roughly corresponding time of life: late childhood, late teens or very early 20s, middle 30s, and old age. Each protagonist faces challenges typically faced by gay males at those times of life, but presented in entirely original ways.

As I said, this is a very ambitious movie - it attempts to give a comprehensive look at an entire lifetime of gay experiences. Not only that, but it does so with such originality that none of the four stories seemed like just a rehashing of the same old gay coming-out/mid-life-crisis/etc formulas. 4 Moons is fresh and new, not like any gay movie that came before it.

The stories are not arranged sequentially but are interwoven, switching between them periodically in a way that is never distracting. Although the stories are interwoven, they do not overlap at all, and only once does a character from one story even see a character from another. All four stories take place in an affluent, very American-looking part of Mexico City, among people who seem not to have to work but aren't so rich that they're surrounded by servants.

The writing and direction, and all technical aspects of the production, are uniformly excellent. I had no idea that the Mexican movie industry was as sophisticated as this movie is. The only thing that makes some stories better than others is the quality of the acting.

All the actors in the two younger stories are fantastic, as good as I've ever seen anywhere. The mid-30s ""full moon"" story has the weakest actors and suffers for it. It's the only one of the four that plays like an overwrought telenovela and therefore is unbelievable and tedious. Actors in the old-age story are good enough to keep it from sinking but not to make it shine as the first two stories do.

But those two ""youth"" stories (especially the one about the childhood friends who reconnect in college) - and the always excellent writing and direction - lift the whole movie far above 99% of its competition.",1419206400,62,2264,4.762755102040816

For me, that is the touchstone of a great movie. Other reviewers have reviewed the plot and structure, so I would like to simply add that the stories are so beautifully portrayed and so honestly rendered that for a thinking person and a person interested in how film can take you to new places and experiences, this is one of those rare works of art. It'll hook you immediately.",1529366400,,517,4.442105263157894

8682109,4,B00O4UN8VU,"I generally liked this film. There were some very touching moments -- and some very realistic (brutally) moments. The kid dealing with homophobia and parental rejection; the college students dealing with the closet as an impediment to a relationship; the 30-something year old couple dealing with infidelity; and the older man lusting the young man. Of all the stories, the older man was the most farcical. He was a caricature, and the rushed ""happy"" ending for him was very contrived and unrealistic. The other stories involved rushed happy endings as well -- except for the 30-something couple. Despite these flaws, I found it very entertaining. PS: Antonio Velasquez is one of the finest men ever. Wow.",1528502400,,705,5.086206896551724
