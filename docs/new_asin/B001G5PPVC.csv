3596482,3,B001G5PPVC,"I don't know how you can have a ""best of"" set without Princess Mononoke in it, and the price is way too high. IMO, Disney has done everything they could to bury these films ever since they took over the distribution of them.",1264291200,42,224,4.232558139534884
3596483,5,B001G5PPVC,"I am a huge fan of these films.  I have most o fthese already, but if these were Blu-Ray versions of these films, I would be SOOOO in!",1262044800,3,134,3.7857142857142856
8303992,1,B001G5PPVC,"DO NOT BUY THESE! As of this writing, the offer is at $595. If you buy this collection for $595, you are a fool. Like others have said, you can buy these movies on blu-ray individually and spend less than $200. This set is a rip-off. Hayao Miyazaki is an amazing director, and these films are all amazing, but the price of this set is a joke.",1427932800,4,342,4.119402985074627
8303993,3,B001G5PPVC,"While I love the movies, this listing is misleading. All of these films are Studio Ghibli, but Miyazaki did NOT direct ""Whisper of the Heart"" or ""The Cat Returns"". They will soon be releasing Blu-Rays of his movies as well (Princess Mononoke, The Wind Rises and Kiki's Delivery Service were released just last week) which also includes a DVD.",1417392000,,342,4.813559322033898
8303994,2,B001G5PPVC,"Simply no reason why 9 movies should be so over-priced, even if they are the authentic copies.  Might be a bootleg set.",1413590400,,119,4.409090909090909
8303995,5,B001G5PPVC,The best collection ever! Hayao Miyazaki is the best Director and Producer ever! The best friend of John Lasseter! (the boss of Pixar!),1356393600,,135,4.913043478260869
8303996,3,B001G5PPVC,"Miyazaki is genius! This is a great collection BUT I would love to find originals of all these...My biggest peeve...the re-dubing like on TOTORO!! The original voice?...so much better than Dakota Fanning, why fix something that isn't broken!",1331078400,2,241,5.368421052631579
8303997,5,B001G5PPVC,"Needless to say how much everyone enjoys Miyazaki. Once experienced his animated movie, I became addicted to his art for life. Profoundly meaningful, deeply spiritual, with awesome enjoyable animation, his movies are good for children and adults, teaching us to better our human qualities. However, I see that most of the negative reviews here are related to the price of this DVD set. The price depends on a particular seller who is selling it. I purchased this DVD set quite a while ago from another seller for only $250.00. At that time Amazon was selling each of these DVDs for a full price of $29.99 (in total it would be $270). I could save a few bucks if I purchased each DVD separately from 9 different third party sellers, who usually sell for a few bucks cheaper than Amazon. Then, I would have to pay 3 bucks for each DVD separately for shipping, in total $27. Also, I would have to wait for almost a month until each seller decides to ship each of these 9 DVD. To purchase each of these 9 DVD with expedited shipping separately for each DVD would be kind of biting since it would be almost $60 for just the expedited shipping costs in addition to the DVD prices. So, I decided to purchase this set for $250.00 plus only once 6 bucks with change for the expedited shipping for the whole 9 DVD set. To me, it was a bargain at that time. Especially I was happy about that each of 9 DVD was factory sealed and shrink-wrapped separately. Since I already had 1 DVD out of this set in my collection, I gave it as a gift to my nephew. I would not suggest anyone to overpay for this set, yet if there is a seller who sells it lower than mid-200s - it may make sense to purchase it expedited and save on shipping costs. Again, I believe that the reviews here should be based on the quality of the movies, not on what each seller decides to price it.",1322179200,5,1851,4.32183908045977
8303998,5,B001G5PPVC,Miyazaki is a true artist. These delightful stories are beatuifully told so that adults will enjoy as much as children. There may be some scary characters for very young children. But these movies are a must have for anyone interested in the art of animation.,1313366400,4,259,4.777777777777778
8303999,1,B001G5PPVC,"Honestly, the price of this set ($399 as of this writing) is ridiculous.  These films can all be purchased separately... 9 films, $20 each... $180.  Doesn't take much to do the math.",1299110400,64,182,4.65625
8304000,1,B001G5PPVC,"I actually have all of these movies in my Anime Collection, and they are all top-notch entertainment.
I spent about 20 USD on each of them, not to mention that Best Buy was having a 50 percent of sale
on all dvd's that day. I would have spent 180 USD but I spent 90 USD. Now I just saved myself 300 dollars
from this deal. PLEASE, if you LOVE these movies and want them on DVD DO NOT, I REAPEAT, DO NOT BUY
THEM from this offer, purchase them individually, trust me. Each of these movies are amazing, so go out and buy
them yourself!",1298764800,16,533,4.085714285714285
8304001,3,B001G5PPVC,"First off I would like to say the only reason I gave this 3 instead of 5 is solely because it is a bit pricey. Bought individually, the price is almost cut in half  totaling around $225, all disks being 2-disk collectors too. The movies are all 5 stars though the menus are just the standard everyday type lacking only a few options you find on most dvds. If your a collector I would say to get this but if you just like the movies and are looking to just own them, I would strongly suggest purchasing them individually seeing as the cost isn't really worth it.",1266883200,43,561,4.242990654205608
