405256,4,630197669X,"Maybe you've forgotten that Robert DeNiro was once considered America's best actor. Maybe his constant involvement these days in lousy projects (Showtime, Rocky and Bullwinkle, Hide and Seek, et al) has diminished his reputation? Well, Stanley & Iris is a terrific place to go to see him at his guarded, emotionally tight best.
This is a middle-aged love story, about two people whose lives have been difficult, and who need each other more than they know.
While the direction and story are somewhat weak, the characters of Stanley and Iris and DeNiro and Fonda's performances make the film.
Here you will find excellent acting, genuine vulnerability and and angle of repose and beauty.",1107129600,17,686,5.079646017699115
405257,5,630197669X,It's a story of working class that works hard and ends up being successful and finding love.  Leaves one feeling good.  I'm going to add it to my collection.,1011830400,2,157,4.379310344827586
405258,3,630197669X,"I fell in love with Jane Fonda many, many years ago when I first saw ""They shoot horses, don't they?"", and since then I've never missed a movie featuring this beautiful lady. I was amazed when I first saw de Niro in... no, as a matter of fact I can't even remember, since I've actually seen all, I mean ALL the movies de Niro has made so far... Yes, you're right, these guys are two of my favorite actors and so, I was really curious to see this movie, although I knew beforehand that I wasn't going to be mesmerized. And in fact I wasn't, but I liked this movie anyway and I still watch it every time it happens to show on TV. This is the kind of movie you need to watch just for a change, as the vast majority of movies released in the recent years are about gangsters, terrorism, doomsday, the end of the world, aliens, money, betrayal, unfaithfulness, cheating and so on.

Having said that, this movie reminds me of ""Falling in love"", although I like this one better. These two are not the kind of movies you'd like to see an actor such as de Niro in, since he has built his reputation playing don V. Corleone, J. La Motta, A. Capone or T. Bickle, and I have to admit that J. Fonda is much more at ease in this ""down to the ground"" kind of character, just as M. Streep is much more at ease than de Niro in ""Falling in love"".

Anyway, all in all an interesting movie, although I can't imagine what could have possibly crossed in more than 20 million american illiterates' head when they've heard the final line of the movie: ""Everything is possible, Iris, everything is possible!"" - shoot to the screen or believe that miracles can happen?",1005004800,2,1642,4.2935483870967746
405259,4,630197669X,"I have to admit I have a thing for Jane Fonda and her blue eyes and endless different facial expressions.  Her acting in this movie was no disappointment.  I'm not the world's biggest fan of Robert DeNiro like the rest of the world but his acting was also very good.  I actually related to both characters.  I can forgive some weaknesses in script and editing in a movie like this.  I thoroughly enjoyed it as a break from the movies about rich, extroardinary people doing unbelievable things.  What a nice concept that two shy, no-longer-twenty-something ordinary people can help each other conquer their fears and weaknesses in an honest relationship.  While most movies portray the guy getting the girl with relative ease, Stanley has to struggle.",1000080000,17,750,4.904761904761905
405260,3,630197669X,"One night, I was watching television and Stanely and Iris was just beginning.. so I sat down, relaxed and watched it. I never heard of this movie before (i haven't seen a lot of movies).. and I was intrested to see  Robert De Niro play this role in this type of movie.. After watching this  movie, i really thought it was a nice movie to watch.. it was  entertaining.. it wasn't an awful movie, but it wasn't the greatest movie  ever.. it is a good movie to watch when your by yourself when you feel like  there is nothing to do.. because you can just do what i did and relax.. get  confy.. and just watch..

De Niro tries to shake off his bad boy gangster image  with poor results as for Jane Fonda she has done much better in the past.  Weak story can`t be helped much by the weak performaces of the two leads.

405456,4,630197669X,"A well written story, great characters that you wanted to love and both De Niro and Fonda did a wonderful job making us believe in Stanley and Iris. I often find myself wondering why De Niro didn't play more leading men of a more romantic type and why he looks so rigid and tense in the love scenes - of course, perhaps it is because he is with Jane Fonda, who really needs a new hairdo! But that aside, you feel for Iris and the constant uphill battle she seems to fight in everyday life and for Stanley, who is dealt a bad hand too, but uses his other strengths to persevere.

What makes this film work are the performers.  Both Jane Fonda and Robert DeNiro are so likable and so talented that we sit patientlyt through the unwinding of the plot and rejoice with them at the end.  Fonda is charming and sparkling and still looks very good.  DeNiro has the rare ability of being very strong and very vulnerable.  They are terrific together and make this a sweet, satisfying movie.",1372896000,2,577,4.777777777777778
405575,3,630197669X,"Robert Deniro as an illiterate man does not sound convincing. However, watching him in this film, gives us a new version. Stanley grew up in a different town every month and never learned to read or write. Since that time he has had menial jobs where he had enough money to support himself and his father. Then he loses his job and dear old dad needs to go to an old aged home.

Stanley meets Iris played by Jane Fonda, a new widow with two children and a sister and her husband living with her. After all is said and done he convinces Irish to teach him to read. Time goes on, a simple, sweet story turns into somewhat of a farce. Jane Fonda is not convincing as Iris, she is too pretty, too fit, too something. DeNiro is convincing as Stanley, but he learns too quickly, too fast. Becomes too successful too quickly. The story in this aspect is not believable.

STANLEY & IRIS is director Martin Ritt's final film. It was also Jane Fonda's last movie until her 2005 comeback in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MONSTER-IN-LAW/dp/B000A343RI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MONSTER-IN-LAW</a>.

This is one of my least favorite Robert De Niro pictures. Although his portrayal of the simpleminded Stanley is believable, De Niro and Fonda have little screen chemistry.

The cast includes Feodor Chaliapin Jr., son of the renowned Russian-born basso profundo opera star. Fourth-billed Martha Plimpton is Keith Carradine's daughter.

(This Wisconsin native is allergic to cheese!)

The movie's plot is fairly simple: a romance that blooms from an unlikely pairing. Stanley loses his cafeteria cook's job because he's illiterate and is thus forced to put his dad in a home, where the old guy dies soon after. Stanley prevails upon Iris to teach him to read, blah, blah, blah, happy ending.

Interestingly this was director Martin Ritt's last movie before his death months later in 1990 and it also marked Fonda's last movie until her return almost two decades later in ""Monster-In-Law"".

Some people do ""fall through the cracks"" as children due to family circumstances; their education is woefully inadequate.

In a paraphrase, his reply is that some men do crossword puzzles, others write books.  This hobby is what's kept him busy in his ""prison.""

405727,3,630197669X,"As the last film directed by the redoubtable Martin Ritt, this 1990 drama is full of good intentions about adult illiteracy and has two proven star actors, Jane Fonda and Robert DeNiro, in the lead roles. Nonetheless, it rarely hovers above the level of a Lifetime TV-movie, as the story amounts to a series of episodes around the burgeoning relationship between Iris, a recently widowed worker in a pastry factory and Stanley, a quiet, illiterate cook who likes to invent mechanical contraptions in the privacy of his apartment. They meet when he is hired at the company cafeteria, but he loses his job when it becomes clear he cannot read or write. Realizing his illiteracy has prevented him from taking care of his ailing father, Stanley asks Iris to teach him. The rest is pretty inevitable, though there are affecting moments along the way mainly because DeNiro is able to convey the basic decency and veiled humiliation of his character.

What I do miss in DeNiro's performance is the edge of danger that makes him truly transcend his best roles like what he did right after this film as Jimmy Conway in Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"". Stanley seems to be a distant cousin of DeNiro's similarly passive and inarticulate character in Ulu Grosbard's 1984 ""Falling in Love"". In what was to be her last film for fifteen years, Jane Fonda seems woefully miscast, looking too intellectually alert and physically aerobicized to portray Iris with conviction. Begging for a Kathy Bates-type to inhabit her, Iris should be downcast about her life and feeling a deepening loneliness about her situation, but Fonda's off-screen resourcefulness makes it difficult to believe this woman would truly feel stuck. It also feels disingenuous of the character to talk about her weight concerns and wanting a couple of eclairs when we are looking at an actress who has made millions off her workout tapes.

Regardless, Ritt is a master when it comes to showing the trials of everyday people in working class settings, and there is genuine chemistry between the two actors, which helps considerably as the story meanders toward its conclusion. The rest of the cast is used inconsistently as plot devices, in particular, Swoosie Kurtz as Iris's battered sister, who oddly disappears midway through the story, and Martha Plimpton as Iris's sullen, impregnated daughter. I have to conclude the primary problem with the film is the episodic screenplay by Harriet Frank, Jr. and Irving Ravetch, both of whom have teamed with Ritt on a number of superior films like ""Hud"" and ""Norma Rae"". The 2004 DVD has no extras.",1145145600,2,2595,4.990762124711316

405729,4,630197669X,"Like your sentimental flicks fudge-free? Rent this one pronto, if only for the numbing serenity of a tamed De Niro and a button-down Jane Fonda. No big-budget romantic histrionics here. Neither of them particularly original in how they approach their characters: Fonda a plucky, quietly sensible working mother in the face of hardships, De Niro a man who works in a cafeteria kitchen and cleans lavatories. But originality is not really what's needed in this simple film about simple people and their loves beneath the stars. It is easy to see why films like this get glossed over come Oscar time, but it's unfair. All characters have their particular voices and seem refreshingly authentic. So, to a surprising degree, does the movie. Don't read too much of the plot, it should make for an excellent rental for a leisurely afternoon.",1129075200,4,834,4.964285714285714

He meets Iris, played by Jane Fonda (Hanoi Jane is not my favorite, but she is superb here) who teaches him reading as their friendship and love blossom.

It is refreshing to see a film about people instead of explosions and elves and monsters. I wonder why DeNiro didn't get an Oscar nod for this one.",1124236800,,479,4.443181818181818

Hot Toasty Rag, September 28, 2017

Stanley & Iris takes a stab at a very overlooked topic: adult illiteracy. When Jane Fonda finds out Robert De Niro has survived his entire life hiding his illiteracy, she sets out to help him. She teaches him how to read, and they become friends. Hes shy and shes still grieving over her late husband, so romance isn't in the cardsat first. . .

Even though this isn't a film I have any desire to watch over and over again, it really is a good movie. Harriet Frank Jr. and Irving Ravetch write some interesting and realistic situations in the beginning of the film that show how Robert De Niro could get away with not being able to read. When the friendship between the two leads turns into something more, the love scenes are once again written realistically. Jane isn't ready for love, and her characters actions are consistent with her hearts needs. I won't spoil anything, but theres a scene where Jane sobs uncontrollably because she isn't ready to give her heart to someone new, and its extremely touching. Many times, Hollywood produces a love story aimed at younger people who haven't suffered real heartbreaks yet and can approach love with bright eyes. Stanley & Iris is an adult love story. Anyone whos loved and lived to tell the tale will appreciate this movie.",1506556800,,1336,4.656779661016949
