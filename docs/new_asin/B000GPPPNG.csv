8133789,4,B000GPPPNG,"This DVD is one in a series on English Masters: The Great Artists. It contains interviews with five English art historians who do an  excellent job commenting on the works of  Joseph Mallard William Turner, the landscape painter born in 1775. In his day, landscape painting was considered an inferior genre compared to historical and  figurative/portrait painting. Turner was an adventurous spirit who was something of an explorer. He travelled all over the British Isles as well as the Continent and made many trips to Italy. Turner created idealized landscapes which became ever more abstract and fanciful as he aged. This prolific artist created more than 19,000 painting sketches. He was a professor of perspective for 30 years at the Royal Academy of Art in London. Also, he was a rather secretive and private man who never married but fathered several children with his mistress. Overall, a very informative and inspiring video which gives a taste of this artist's work.",1234569600,2,976,5.0875
8133790,2,B000GPPPNG,"My guess is that most Americans are like myself:  we may know about more about British musicians and authors than authors, but the converse is true about painters.  I knew nothing about Turner, but here are my thoughts on this disc, if you are still interested.

This work covers Turner's childhood, artistic influences, etc.  I love how art experts can dig heavily and pull up issues that lay viewers wouldn't even consider.  I appreciated the discussion in the same way that I'd appreciate the discussion about any artist from experts who cared.  The work says, ""We know little of Turner's personal life,"" but then goes on to say he had two children out of wedlock.  Usually, ""knowing little of a personal life"" is a tacit allusion to a rainbow flag status.  However, here this guy just never married his baby momma.  Though his work was produced decades before the French Impressionists' work, there was a lightness and joie de vivre that reminded me of it.

Unlike most documentaries where there is a token female interviewee or where female interviewees only compose the majority if the documentary is about a woman, this work had only one male interviewee.  I love that women are now in a position where they can be the experts on famous men.  Still, knowing that women's work is often belittled in sexist fashions, this may make biased viewers  discredit the work.  Some may use this to dismiss art as ""only women's stuff.""

The Kultur series is usually dry and poorly put together.  It's usually just a slideshow on DVD.  However, this work had recorded interviewees.  The Kultur series seems like it finally jazzed things up and made things more interesting to the modern and busy viewer.",1177113600,4,1697,4.813148788927336
