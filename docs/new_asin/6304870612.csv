7878555,5,6304870612,"Being Sicilian I had to get all 5 in the series. Gotti had his admirer's and detractors both. He was considered by some as a Robin Hood for the people. I do know as a fact the Mafia worked with the FBI to find German spies in the USA.They succeeded. They helped my Grandmother when her husband died and had to raise 5 kids. They got the oldest two jobs in cafe's and my grandmother a job at the Detroit Salt mines. They never had to pay them any money for the help. This was Italians only service. Get the whole series,you will like them. They also got rid of undesirables, made them move out of  the neighborhood such as molesters and perverts.",1411948800,,645,4.2439024390243905
