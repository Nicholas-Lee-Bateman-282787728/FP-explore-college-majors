7862500,5,6304069030,"i love ""Scooby's All-Star Laff-a-Lympics"" because of how it was patterned. as a kid, i loved watching all those ""ensemble"" cartoon shows because they freaked me out when i'd see Scooby-Doo and Shaggy along side characters like Fred Flintstone or Yogi Bear and Snagglepuss. anyway, these cartoons are harmless, hilarious fun. in reference to the other review, i think that if children are only exposed to ""older"" cartoons then i can't see why they'd grow up with the love or affection for the sloppy and teen-angst ridden cartoons of today. i was raised watching the old and new cartoons (this was during the '80s when Saturday morning was dominated by old Warner Brothers and Hanna-Barbera cartoon package shows plus the new stuff inspired by toys) and yes, i admit that i have a soft-spot for such cartoons as ""He-Man"" (which was based on action figures) because it was a good cartoon in my opinion...however, i DO have the ability to look at most of this [stuff] they pass of as cartoons today (much of it's high-brow Japanese animation with little humor) and call it [good] and i'm not some old fuddy duddy bitter with progress either. i'm 26 and i'm probably a little bias toward older cartoons like his video because i'm a fan of Daws Butler, Mel Blanc, Stan Freberg, June Foray, Paul Frees, Don Messick, and Paul Winchell (these specific voice-actors were responsible for 85% of the most popular characters to ever grace animation by Warner Brothers and Hanna-Barbera...the other 15% are the Disney voice people like Jim Cummings, Hal Smith, and also Paul Winchell as well as Jay Ward's crew including Bill Scott among the previously mentioned June Foray, Paul Frees, and Daws Butler). this video is essential for any parent who wants to expose their children to harmless cartoons void of repulsiveness and brashness that children shouldn't be exposed to at the age these cartoons are aimed at. but i also admit that i get thorough enjoyment watching these shows because they're adult oriented without being aimed primarily at adults. Jay Ward used to fill his cartoons with so many puns and jokes and they flew over kids heads. on these Scooby olympics shows, the message is clear: fun and harmless.",1045008000,3,2206,4.8853333333333335
7862501,5,6304069030,"Even today scooby is still of the greatest cartoons, and one of the few old school cartoon character that keeps kids entertained. In this video kids get there own version of the olympic games, cartoonized.  With great teams such as the Yogi Yahoos, Scooby Doobys and Really Rottens, Kids can't help but fall in love with this tape. and unlike so many of the Scooby tapes out now, this video is all old school, none of that new stuff such as Zoombie Island and Witch's ghost, this movie is less intense and more funny, enjoyable and most inportantly ""OLD SCHOOL"" styled Scooby.",989193600,,576,4.647058823529412
