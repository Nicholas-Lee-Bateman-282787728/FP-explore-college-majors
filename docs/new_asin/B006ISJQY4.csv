8498834,5,B006ISJQY4,I'm sorry to say but to MOST BIG anime and hentai fans this is a ripe off. it's only the first half of the story and a teaser for the second half. and if you go to look for a published copy of the second half or the manga it's based off of you can't find it. but that's not why I'm giving it a high score nor why I like/ love. the reason why is the ART. all the attention to the details make this a beautiful piece of art and it looks almost realistic. the character Faye saying big brother John does get annoying after awhile. and I do wish real maid did dress like they do in this.,1528588800,,583,3.8264462809917354
8498835,5,B006ISJQY4,"Even if it is only under 30 minutes, it has very nice artwork and the graphics were also well drawn.",1466208000,,100,4.05
8498836,5,B006ISJQY4,Both story and artwork was great. I wish it was bite longer and more action!,1455753600,,76,4.133333333333334
8498837,5,B006ISJQY4,"This erotic anime, by far, has the best animation quality. It definitely ranks with the other great hentia (as far as animation goes) Bible Black, Words worth, Viper GTS? Angel Blade. In my opinion all erotic anime's should have to have this level of quality before release. It'd cut down on all the garbage that gets out.
And for the great animation quality I would suggest watching it.

Now the story.. is a bit... weird. Or at least it has that ""feel"" to it..the roughly 3rd scene, where ..well the main character
runs in on a certain something, which isn't odd in itself.. its who she runs in on. And then ""Sister Jane"" is like ""Meh, its no big deal""

This DVD is only part of the story by the way. It doesn't finish.

The run time of the actual anime, is about 29:00 and something minutes.. including boring scenes up to the action.
On the DVD it has a ""Approximate 40 minute run time"" and I assume that must include the trailers as well which
seems like a crock to me.

The DVD Bonus features include:

Original Trailer
Interview with MR. Urushihara (We'll probably never get a part two unless its already been made because the dude looks like he's sucking the smokes down like they were candy or something)
Historical Background
About Drama CD
Text-less Ending

Glad I purchased this. I think it will be a classic.

(Also, HA! I managed to snag the last one available for prime. #HumorTag)",1397260800,,1396,4.515873015873016
8498838,5,B006ISJQY4,This is by far the best H anime on the market in terms of animation quality. There might be a few reused/recycled frames from here and there but it is toleratable. I certainly hope there will be a 2nd epsisode in the near future.,1368144000,2,229,4.2272727272727275
8498839,3,B006ISJQY4,"Another Lady Innocent is a hentai anime that takes place in the Civil War era. The story revolves around an aristocratic family and the environs of their mansion. Is this in the North or the South? Since its a hentai, I guess these details are irrelevant. The plot isn't anything noteworthy but since this is hentai, that's not unusual. The animation is excellent, except for the fact that the threesome in this video all have the same hair color, giving a vibe that's like an early twenty something 'Village of the Damned' meets mansion of nymphos.
There are no assertive, sexy female characters in the story, most of the females in the video are too docile and too submissive. It wasn't appealing.
There is a homecoming scene where the patriarch of the mansion is 'interrupted' which I found disturbing, detracting from my enjoyment of the video.
I couldn't really suspend my disbelief enough to truly enjoy the video. The animation was great but there were a few elements that diminished my enjoyment of the video.",1354233600,,1017,4.817142857142857
