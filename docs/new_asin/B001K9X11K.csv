8314467,4,B001K9X11K,"I bought this for my husband, who is a huge Bear Bryant fan. Because it was so inexpensive, I wasn't expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised. It includes interviews with former players, and others who knew Bear.  There was also some great original footage of Bear coaching, and of the funeral motorcade, to mention two. The original song about Bear was nice to hear, but became repetitive by the end. Also, the same footage was used several times throughout the program, but for the price, these are minor complaints. I consider this a bargain, and would recommend it for Bear Bryant fans.",1267920000,3,592,4.803921568627451
