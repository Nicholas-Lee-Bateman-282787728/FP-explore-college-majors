Worth the money. This one is a keeper. First India comedy I have watched and loved it.",1436054400,,252,3.9607843137254903
8546667,5,B00A42YG2C,"AWESOME!  Saw this movie on NetFlix....and am going to buy it.....it is hilarious....laughed so much....same concept as the movie Ghost with Patrick Swayze, but totally wild, the murdered man is reincarnated as a fly and comes back to protect his girlfriend and revenge on the man that killed him.....His girlfriend is a microsculptor, and when she realized that this fly is her dead boyfriend, she builds all this tiny gear for his fly body to attack his murderer and make this man's life sheer misery!  People will love this movie!",1385596800,2,533,4.911111111111111
8546668,5,B00A42YG2C,"You have not sdeen anything quite like this! The reincarnation of the lover as a fly is absolutely outrageous (in a good way!), but the animation and camera work are just really worth watching. It gets off to kind of a slow start--is Southern India really so clean and populated with such incredibly good-looking people? And then there are the usual production numbers as in Bollywood films (this is known as Tollywood, I guess, since the movie's in Telegu, a language spoken mainly in the southern part of the subcontinent. If you can make it to the incarnation, you are really in for a treat.",1385596800,2,594,4.666666666666667
8546669,4,B00A42YG2C,"is an outlandish, fun, and a very inventive I had tons of fun watching the  lover who is killed and is reincarnated as a fly, which sets out to seek revenge against his killer and while protecting his love as Patrick Swayze did in the Ghost.
In short, the The Fly is Fly....but Sudeep the villain is creepy and amazing as the killer. The director Rajamouli gives the fly enough personality to make this a clap worthy watch. Fun and imaginative to watch.....just for the sheer inventiveness. four stars. 11/11/2013",1384128000,,513,4.7
8546670,4,B00A42YG2C,"Reincarnation is nothing new as a theme in the movie history, especially in that of the Indian film industry, as works like Om Shanti Om show us. But Eega, a 2012 Telugu hit movie takes up this familiar theme in a totally different way. In this romantic fantasy (and/or comedy/action), the protagonist, after getting killed by a villain, comes back to this world as a vengeful fly.

Yes, you heard it right. The hero of writer/director S S Rajamoulis incredible adventure is a fly. Eega is a revenge story, about a young man named Nani (Nani), who is murdered by a billionaire Sudeep (Sudeep). Now reborn as a fly, ever-resourceful Nani intends to get even with the man responsible for his death. Samantha plays Bindu, a beautiful micro artist with whom Nani (as a human) falls in love.

Like Patrick Swayzes character in Ghost, Nani as a fly protects Samantha from Sudeep, a womanizer trying to seduce her. Just like Ghost, Eega is often funny, and a bit violent, too. Jokes are sometimes silly but not excessive, and the story is dark at times but not too much so. The storyline itself is simple  perhaps too simple, I think  but the strong acting from the stars Sudeep and, of course, the CG-created fly with its expressive gestures are something you should not miss. Enjoy it.",1383436800,2,1280,4.6755555555555555

Even if you aren't a fan of the HOUSEFLY REINCARNATION REVENGE genre, you will be after you see this gem!",1363737600,,167,4.387096774193548
8546672,4,B00A42YG2C,"Sometimes Tollywood leaps ahead of its better known Bollywood cousin. Such is the case with Eega, a comic tale of a man reincarnated as fly and his sweetheart reeking revenge on the man that killed him. Despite the hero's lack of cuddliness and homicidal intentions, the live action and 3D animation are deftly combined to bring us a fly we can care about. The humor is fairly broad, but there are some nice inventive touches. The movie runs a little shorter than many Indian movies, since there isn't a lot of padding with musical numbers. That's a good thing, because it helps keep the movie focused on the story. But don't worry, the usual Indian movie staples of a gorgeous love interest, a poor but lovable hero, and a sneer worthy villain are included. And for the record, the only generic romantic number is quite good.

The film would have been helped if more time had been spent on developing the villain's business plans so their inevitable destruction, one-by-one, would've resulted in a bigger payoff. That said, this movie is a lot of fun.",1355270400,6,1052,4.717391304347826
