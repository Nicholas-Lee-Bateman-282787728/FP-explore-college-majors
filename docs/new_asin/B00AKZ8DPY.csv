5448254,3,B00AKZ8DPY,"No, it is not Allan Holdsworth, it is a guy named Alex Machacek, who plays Holdsworth's solo note for note on ""In The Dead Of Night'. If there is no guitarist, it is Terry Bozzio on drums and just a 3 piece.",1358208000,2,207,3.9523809523809526
5448255,5,B00AKZ8DPY,"I have not seen this DVD but a friend sent me two CD,s of live performances from Tokyo and from suburban Chicago this last summer. Ihad seen UK twice open for Jethro Tull in 79 in Minneapolis,Mn, and later in Carbondale,Il.opening on the ""Stormwatch""Tour. They played stuff off their two releases and were excellent even without Bruford and Holdsworth. This time I know Holdsworth performed because they do a killer version of ""Nevermore""which they hadn't done live before. The songs sounded great, so that bodes well for this DVD. If you ever can get a copy of UK playing the Riviera Theater in Chicago1979 grab it its great and has them doing better versions of songs on Dangermoney than on the record,especially stuff that ended up on Brufords solo albums like Sahara on Snow etc...Really great stuff that makes you wonder what could have happened had they stayed together!",1355875200,,876,4.885906040268456
5448256,5,B00AKZ8DPY,Awesome concert ! Wetton and Jobson are in top form . Glad to see that they brought back a guitarist to the band who does a great job filling Holdsworth's shoes. The drummer is good as well . All in all this is a must own for any UK fans . You will not be dissapointed !,1401408000,,270,3.754385964912281
5448257,5,B00AKZ8DPY,"Euro-K would be a  better name for this particular version of UK.  That said, this is a remarkably good concert DVD.  Eddie Jobson and John Wetton remain true to their original material but it is Alex Machacek, guitar and Marco Minnerman, uber drummer, who really make a difference here. The best example of this is Nevermore (a song they hardly ever perform live) is flawless in the execution and I was blown away by Alex's delicate, lyrical searing guitar. There is heavy material here as well, Danger Money. Carry No Cross and the Crimson classic from RED, One More Red Nightmare. Most of us may never see UK, as their touring is very limited. So if you are a fan and love UK, this is the best way to enjoy this great band. Which is to say, I recommend this to all UK fans or progrock fans in general.",1399939200,2,804,4.382550335570469
5448258,5,B00AKZ8DPY,"I absolutely loved UK when they came out, and I was very excited when I saw that they had played & recorded this reunion concert.
And at first I was a little bummed that Bruford & Holdsworth didn`t play, but when I saw just how awesome these 2 young guys were
who filled in for them, all was forgiven. Actually, when I saw just how fantastic Marco Minnemann is as a drummer, I forgot about Bruford. (sorry Bill) OMG, he`s an animal. And Alex Machacek has Holdsworth`s guitar down to a T. These two guys added to the show for sure. So, if you loved UK. Your gonna love this show. It`s awesome !!",1389312000,,594,4.219298245614035
5448259,2,B00AKZ8DPY,"Jeez, huge fan of UK and couldn't wait for this. But the video quality SUCKS! If this was from the 1970's I would have accepted that this was the technology of the day, but 2011? C'mon! And the stage colors are dark and dull. Not much color at all. I've seen several concerts recorded in Japan and they look amazing. I'm sure they have better equipment for rent than this crap.
The audio quality is a step up, but still muddy, bass heavy and too much keyboards. The drums lack any power at all. The guitar is totally missing except for solos.
Fortunately the songs and the performance are top notch. But they do look like they are phoning it in.
Wish I could rate it higher!",1388016000,,674,4.31496062992126
5448260,4,B00AKZ8DPY,"This is another example of the shrinking budget of musicians to present their performances in the best possible way.
Eddie plays incredible but the faux Hammond is so evident. The synth lines are played superbly but the minimoog and CS 80 sound is mediocre. The violin is awesome and Wetton sings like he's still in his 20's! The drummer and guitarist do an amazing job. If you love UK you must own this.",1383609600,,404,4.5479452054794525
5448261,5,B00AKZ8DPY,It was great to hear these songs performed again in all their glory. Jobson and Wetton handle their old parts like they've been playing them all their lives and the new replacement drummer and guitarist do a great job of giving the music the proper feel. Hail all prog rock!,1373673600,,274,4.5
5448262,5,B00AKZ8DPY,"I wasn't sure that this was going to be as good as some had told me it was.  It's a reunion for Eddie Jobson and John Wetton but Allan Holdsworth and Bill Bruford are not part of the reunion performance.  While I consider both to be really hard to replace (Allan Holdsworth is one of the finest guitarists in the world) I wasn't disappointed by their replacements.  I was unfamiliar with Alex Machacek who took Holdsworth's place on this tour.  He is quite an amazing guitarist in his own right and played the very intricate pieces very well.  Marco Minnemann is one of the best drummers playing today.  Marco is a member of The Aristocrats and plays with Steven Wilson.  He has a style that is different from any other drummer.  I can't really tell you what it is about his playing that sets him apart from others.  You'll just have to get the DVD and see for yourself.

As for Jobson and Wetton - Great performances by both.  John Wetton's voice is still one of the best voices in the history of rock music and Jobson is a great keyboard player and just amazing on the violin.

A great set. Some of the more difficult UK pieces and even some King Crimson tunes thrown in (Starless and One More Red Nightmare).

Fans of UK will love this.  Progressive rock fans who aren't familiar with UK will love this as well.  Great mix for the surround sound.  Buy it and crank it up.",1372982400,3,1374,4.371541501976284
5448263,5,B00AKZ8DPY,Please disregard the negative reviews posted.  I am a huge fan of the first U.K. album and if you have any doubts about Bruford and Holdsworth being absent here then put those doubts to rest.  The two young guns filling in here are stellar throughout!  The stage and lighting production is very minimalist but the musicianship is fantastic beyond words!  I actually appreciate the minimalist approach production wise as it enhances the intimacy of the musicians.  Wetton is not boring as one reviewer previously stated.  He is brilliant and certainly inspired as well as Jobson.  Loved the overhead shots looking down on the drummer's full kit.  Bruford is out there possibly wishing he hadn't passed on this!,1371859200,9,709,5.0
5448264,5,B00AKZ8DPY,It's an incredible experience to see reunited in concert two of the three parts from one of the most talented groups in progresive rock.,1369699200,,136,4.708333333333333

5448266,2,B00AKZ8DPY,"U.K. is one of my favorite bands ever.  Saw them live when they opened for Jethro Tull on October 31, 1979 in the Mid-South Coliseum, Memphis TN.

I stumbled across this DVD a couple of weeks ago and bought it immediately.  Yes, the video and audio quality is not that great.  BUT, I still am very happy to have it in my collection.  The songs on their self-titled debut album are still amazing ~35 years later!!",1368921600,,412,4.368421052631579
5448267,4,B00AKZ8DPY,Not a bad DVD to purchase if you are a U.K. fan. At least they have done something for DVD. I would like to see more concert shows from this band. The sound and video quality are fine. Very watchable.,1368144000,,200,4.025
5448268,5,B00AKZ8DPY,"Wetton & Jobson recorded 3 albums(1978-80)as U.K. 2 were STUDIO & 1 ""LIVE. ROCK/FUSSION is how DESCRIBE this music.

5448269,4,B00AKZ8DPY,"This is Jobson and Wetton + Alex Machacek & Marco Minnemann (both excellent players on this & their own stuff). No Bruford/Holdsworth (of course) - they lost interest in it back then & more so now. Few if any musicians could fill their shoes but IMO these songs are done about as well as they could possibly be played live - even with all the difficulties of reproducing the same keyboard sounds from the time and pulling off the violin work to boot. EJ & JW didn't really play their ages - EJ played as nimbly as 1978 & JW's voice sounded surprising good (better than I would've expected).

As others have mentioned they did look rather bored - or perhaps just too serious? Technically excellent performances but it didn't appear to be much fun doing it. Also, the video quality is by no means state of the art & the audio quality perhaps could've been better. The mix was good so there was nice separation between the instruments. Even with the audio/video not being perfect it is all & all a good dvd. Anyone who likes U.K. should enjoy it. Given the much lower budgets independent/niche type bands have to cope with these days I for one can certainly cut Jobson some slack.",1365033600,7,1177,4.5
5448270,4,B00AKZ8DPY,I am very happy with this concert DVD I would recomend it to any UK or John Wetton fans. I saw some unfavorable reviews here on Amazon but I dissagree with them. I saw the band in NYC the night before they left for Japan and seeing this film of them brought back a lot of great memories of that awesome show I got to see live in a very intimate setting.,1365033600,,353,3.9166666666666665
5448271,3,B00AKZ8DPY,"I love this music ,i love  Wetton, Holdsworth. , Bruford  , but the video and sound  quality of this dvd is very poor .
Where is Allan  ???
The actual chitarist is not Allan , and you hear the great difference...",1363651200,,212,4.097560975609756
5448272,5,B00AKZ8DPY,"I always felt that the UK studio albums did not capture their full potential.  This DVD shows what they are capable of delivering.  A Prog masterpiece.  Eddie Jobson is front and center, and really dominates the show. This is Wetton/Jobson UK and it is very entertaining. Though a little on the low budget side, it is a great addition to my DVD library. It will fit nicely next to Yes, Asia, ELP, King Crimson, and other masters of the art.  Recorded in Japan, where there is still an audience intelligent enough to appreciate Prog. If you are a fan of Prog, Eddie Jobson's incredible talent, and John Wetton's outstanding vocals, I think that you will enjoy this DVD.",1363478400,,668,4.635593220338983
5448273,4,B00AKZ8DPY,"The path to the inmortal musical stature of Jobson and Wetton included these bands: Curved Air, Zappa, Roxy Music,Family, King Crimson, Wishbone Ash, Uriah Heep, Asia and more.
For anyone that has followed this giants'carrer, this DVD is great! except for the sound,  which is indeed not at the level us fans expect. Sounds like a great bootleg, no more.

I even did not miss Tery Bozzio, even though he is one of my top ten drummers ever. I was really, really pissed off to know that Bozzio was not in, but in a few seconds this Marco Minneman straightened me out.  He plays with incredible taste and accuracy. In fact , he is kind of the star here, visually and soundwise. And about the guitarist? holy s***! Jobson hired nothing but the best for this gig.

Now, the most important thing: The music...  great as ever. The quality of these songs makes them prog classics. Jobson's keyboard and violin work is outstanding in this DVD.  And wetton still has that great voice and masterbuilt bass lines.",1362182400,6,1001,4.627118644067797
5448274,2,B00AKZ8DPY,"The DVD quality is lacking in my opinion. Both the stereo and 5.1 are very muddy, not clear at all for this day and age.
The videography is also of poor quality.
As far as the song selection goes, it is top notch, although Wetton looks bored most of the time.
The guitarist fills in nicely for Holdsworth, he was also on the UKZ ep and played well.
The drummer fills in nicely for Bruford/Bozzio.
I missed a shot to see them last year in NYC, so this is a nice fill in, but they could have mastered the whole thing a heck of a lot better.
This is just my opinion, please no flaming at me.",1361750400,14,588,4.034188034188034
5448275,3,B00AKZ8DPY,"When you talk about progressive rock, there's no question that U.K. certainly delivers as a supergroup. However, I'm intrigued why didn't they include 3 great songs that could've, excuse me... COULD'VE made it PERFECT!!! These songs in my opinion,would've made the whole set complete and worth the price of buying. These are;
1. Nothing to Lose
2. Night after Night
3. As Long as You Want Me Here

  I strongly feel that both drum and violin solos were unnecessary. Why? Because it's just filler content and there's no doubt about the ability and musical genius of Eddie Jobson. Since the show didn't include these 3 songs or at least the first two listed, you might feel like your lacking something musically. I would buy the dvd,if it's available on BluRay even better. As the dvd as presented, it's just ok as it is... I'm only saying those improvements could've made it better.",1358726400,3,881,4.782894736842105
8553229,2,B00AKZ8DPY,"Great  DVD except-WHERE are the drums ? It's obvious Eddie Jobson mixed the final copy before it was transfered to this DVD because the great drumming that Marco Minneman does on it can hardly be heard at times.and the guitar is buried sometimes too. I wish they had hired an .independent producer/engineer for this project so it sounded more like a whole band then just the Eddie Jobson / John Wetton does UK project.. Thank god Jobson saw fitt so we can at least hear Wetton's vocals and bass. Very disappointed  in the mix not the material. I was so looking forward to this and even without Bruford ad Holdsworth this could be a fine DVD with the proper mix of the music. But I guess some ego or egos got in the way. I'd like to give this 1 star but can't because the material ( i.e. songs ) is still good, but the mix,especially the buried drums ruins most of it.",1493424000,,867,4.3128834355828225
8553230,5,B00AKZ8DPY,"This is just fantastic! It's not a big budget production for lighting and special effects, but the musicianship is out standing. If you like UK you'll love this concert. Get it before it goes out of print. You'll be glad you did.",1485820800,,229,4.476190476190476
8553231,5,B00AKZ8DPY,"If you love UK, you should get this DVD!  True, the audio quality may be a tad shy, not as good as some other more modern recordings, but my ears quickly got used to it, and I could hear everything everyone was playing.  John Wetton's voice is, somewhat surprising after all these years, in GREAT form!  Whoever did the programming on Jobson's keyboards freakin' NAILED it! The sounds are all spot on with the studio recordings, much better than even the ""U.K. LIVE"" record album from the same era.  I saw both iterations of this band live, and this group sounds better than they did back in the day!  I wondered about how the drummer here, Marco Minneman, would sound compared to Bill Bruford or Terry Bozzio....I was floored! He's awesome.  As is the Holdsworth stand-in, Alex Machacek.  WHEW!!  Nails all of Holdsworth's licks.  This DVD covers ALL of U.K.'s songs from both studio albums, plus a couple King Crimson tunes thrown in for good measure. (Starless, and, One More Red Nightmare)  If you're a prog-head, a King Crimson fan, or lover of U.K., you owe it to yourself to get this DVD.  Top-notch performances.",1422403200,,1120,4.6923076923076925
8553232,4,B00AKZ8DPY,"Be careful about these other reviews. They mislead me to believe the quality was so bad that it wouldn't be worth buying.
Well, it "" IS "" worth buying! Here's the good and the bad.
THE BAD. The lighting is a bit low as they tried to maintain the ambiance of the show. Therefore, the video is not as vital as it would have been in brighter light. The vocals are heavily processed in reverb and delay, but Wetton has done this before. The result is that he doesn't look like he has to work very hard to sing these tunes. I do not suspect it is dubbed. He is a bit stoic in his stage presence too, as he rarely moves. Eddie Jobson produced and directed this DVD. He did the remastering on the catalog as well. That was just mediocre, so perhaps he is just the most motivated guy, and just took it upon himself to fund and produce this? Lets face it though these guys probably could not afford to go big production with this, as I doubt they earned much from this tour.

Id give the video quality an 7 or 8 not because it lacks sharpness but it's just a tad dark. The sound I give a 8 or 9 but it's WAY better than some of the reviewers led me to believe. It's not state of the art 5.1 but it's just a four piece band as well,so it's not that easy to take advantage of 5.1 that way.

THE GOOD. Camera work is not annoying and it patient and adequate. Good views of Jobson's fingering. A bit weak on covering Alex. Amazing keyboard and violin sounds and ridiculous playing. STUNNING! Incredible Drumming and one of the greatest drum solos I have ever seen! Yes, I missed Bruford, but this guy brought a more aggressive approach. The guitarist (who is great and not well known is great! I own two of his solo albums. He is a smart and distinctive player. He was a little underutilized here but he nails every solo. The set list is killer! It is a nice long show. Wished there were interviews. I am sooooooo glad I purchased this before it disappeared or became absurdly expensive. I strongly suggest any serious Prog fan to grab this DVD. The bottom line is that these guy do the music justice and Jobson is just awesome.",1420329600,2,2115,4.232673267326732

8553234,4,B00AKZ8DPY,"Having read several reviews of this video I hesitated in my purchase due to the complaints of 'sound and video quality'.  However, I saw parts of the performances on Utube and felt O.K. with both if this were the video I would be buying. I also saw videos of U.K. with Terry Bozzio on the U.S. leg of the  tour which were atrociousthe drums were unintelligible, just a roar of white noise!  It was most unfortunate that the sound of the drums, such an intrinsic part of the U.K. sound, were so poorly recorded.

Fortunately, this video contains the European tour with Marco Minneman on drums.  The performances are well interpreted  and brilliantly executed.  The sound is fine: I had no problem with the quality of the recording.  Yes, the video was shot simply, no fancy angles or annoying MTV style editing (thank goodness!)just straight ahead shots of the entire group performing as a finely honed unit.

As a long time fan of U.K., from the original with Holds worth and Bruford, through the transition with Bozzio, I can highly recommend this video to avid fans of the band.

I would also recommend Bruford's video 'Rock goes to college' (BBC).  Bruford was an excellent band and anyone who enjoys U.K. should, I think, love Bill's (Bruford) band as well.  The video is not a high budget piece but the performances are good and the recording is well done. It is great to have a visual and aural record of this great band.",1413590400,,1427,4.619047619047619
8553235,4,B00AKZ8DPY,"This is a dream come true for every fan of progressive music. The line-up is not the same as three decades ago , but music shure is.

8553238,5,B00AKZ8DPY,"The audio quality is a bit lacking by today's standards, but that is completely negated by the great performance. All musicians are firing on all cylinders the whole time. Eddie Jobson is absolutely a stand-out. Some made comments about Wetton's lack of enthusiasm, but the fact that he nails the vocals and bass duties perfectly make up for that also. For those familiar with the drummer and guitarist then you know they're are top notch. For those that aren't you'll be pleased with their performance. I recommend this to any UK fan.",1402272000,,535,4.826086956521739
