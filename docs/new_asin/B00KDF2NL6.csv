6419383,1,B00KDF2NL6,I fell asleep through much of it. But what I did see at the end was horrible. (Spoiler Alert). Graphically depicting a dog/car accident was traumatic for me. I wish I could get my money back.,1470009600,2,191,4.333333333333333

I realize that it's digital, and I could simply delete it, but if there is a way I could get my money back I would love to find out.  I regret even seeing this movie.  It is not in any way a cute or funny film about a dog, but rather an exploit of film making in general.  Literal trash.  And I'm not even usually a harsh critic.

Don't be fooled by the silly name or the silly promotional song, this is all dark humor in the worst way. It is volatile. And that's saying a lot coming from someone who regularly watches spaghetti horror films.",1469750400,6,661,4.038461538461538

6419387,5,B00KDF2NL6,"The negative reviews I'm reading here are hilarious, because these viewers clearly had no idea what they were stepping in to when they sat down to watch a Todd Solondz film.

In my estimation, this is Todd's most commercially accessible film to date, and also his funniest. I am a dachshund owner and a dachshund lover. I have a soft spot for the breed in general. The fact that I walked away from this film smiling is a testament to Todd's excellence as a writer and director.

As dark comedies go, this film is exceedingly wonderful on both accounts. It is both dark and deeply uncomfortable, and hilariously funny.

If you've never seen a Todd Solondz film, I would be cautious to recommend it. If superhero blockbusters are your cup of tea, then stay away. This film isn't for you. But if you've seen the genius in Happiness or Dollhouse, then I enthusiastically encourage to rush to check out this film and savor every moment of it. It's brilliant.",1469318400,2,953,4.627218934911243

6419389,1,B00KDF2NL6,"I'm sure this movie was meant to have some deep point to it, I walked out distressed and disturbed and wish I hadn't seen it. It is a sad movie about sad people.  The dog gets passed between people so why he is passed around is that never explained.  You would think there would be some interaction with the dog, or some attempt to look up things from a dogs perspective as possible, you to see the boy playing with him a little bit, but mostly you see the boy with him while the dog is in a very small pen in a very white garage.
The  dog moves through different situations with different people. Only one of these situations explain why the change in ownership was made.  The one character who interacts with the dog a little is Danny DeVito who  takes her out for a walk.  The couple that she lives with are happy to have her but should be assessed to find out if they have the ability to give her proper care. All in capital letters please type spoiler aler The couple that she lives with are happy to have her but should be assessed to find out if they have the ability to give her proper care. SPOILER ALERT  The dog is killed at the end, it is gruesome, and then you watch it happen again, and again. I really wish I haven't gone to see it it looks like it had  insightful into human life and our interaction with dogs but that was not the case. And we hardly ever see the dog played with or have an exercise bulb a new couple has him playing on the grass.
But people were sad and  loose at ends and the dog just kind of sits around - The way they treat the dog is sick.",1468800000,15,1577,4.061290322580645
6419390,4,B00KDF2NL6,"""Wiener-Dog"" (2016 release; 90 min.) brings the story of a wiener-dog as she is passed on from caretaker to caretaker. As the movie opens, we see someone drop off Wiener-Dog at the shelter, and in the very next scene, a dad surprises his young son, a cancer survivor we are told, with the gift he's always dreamt of: having his very own pet. Unfortunately, the dog must first be house-broken and that is easier said than done, to the desperation of both the young boy and his parents. Then one day, the boy feeds granola bars to the dog, upsetting the dog's stomach... At this time we're not even 15 minutes into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest project from independent writer-director Todd Solndz (""Welcome to the Dollhouse"", ""Dark Horse""). Here he bring perhaps his most accessible story yet: how a cute-looking, just plain adorable, wiener-dog goes from household to household, where we get a glimpse of those people's lives. There are essentially 4 unrelated stories with Wiener-Dog as the common thread. The movie is helped immensely by, of course, the cute looking dog, but equally so by a number of stellar acting performances. In the first story, the young boy reminded me of Fred Savage, Wonder Years-era. Julie Delpy plays his mom. In the second segment, Greta Gerwig thankfully stays MILES away from her usual Diane Keaton-like NY young neurotic woman, and instead gives a wonderful turn as the seemingly lost young woman. Gerwig plays it with a vulnerability not previously seen from her before. In the third segment Danny DeVito plays the lead, while in the last segment, Ellen Burstyn reminds us why she still has the acting chops. I must admit that I knew next-to-nothing about the film prior to seeing it (other than it featured a really cute dog), and I was very pleasantly surprised by it. It is billed as a 'comedy', but frankly, I don't think it was a comedy at all (there certainly aren't any laugh-out-loud moments in it). Instead it is a peek at ordinary people's lives, including their struggles and insecurities. Also, the movie has an actual (if brief) intermission between the second and third segment. When was the last time you saw that??

""Wiener-Dog"" premiered at this year's Sundance Film Festival to great acclaim, and Amazon Studies (yes, them again) snapped it up right away. The movie opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wit to see it. The Friday early evening screening was attended so-so, and I can only hope that this is due with the picture-perfect weather we are enjoying here today. If you are interested in a slightly off-center movie about ordinary people's lives, including having a cute dog, I'd suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, or on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Weiner-Dog"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1467936000,10,2968,4.840551181102362
6419391,5,B00KDF2NL6,"Ambivalence is the order of the day when it comes to Todd Solondz's films: You're never sure whether you're supposed to love or hate his characters. Sometimes it seems the indie writer-director loathes his creations.

From the awkward square peg in 1995's Welcome to the Dollhouse to the man-child in 2011's Dark Horse, Solondz gives us complicated, misunderstood misfits who often behave badly.

If the antiheroes are hard to take, Solondz's supporting players - compulsive liars, narcissists, and child molesters - are simply damnable.

Not so the characters in his new feature, Wiener-Dog.

Starring Ellen Burstyn, Julie Delpy, Greta Gerwig and Danny DeVito, among others, Solondz's eighth feature is a poetic, almost gentle, and sharply funny meditation on mortality that's sustained not by bile but compassion, even love.

It's one of Solondz's most accomplished works to date and also his most accessible since Dollhouse.

Wiener-Dog features a hapless female dachshund who keeps being handed off to new owners. Using the dog's arrival and departure as the film's structure, Solondz strings together four vignettes about people who are somehow touched by death.

The first piece features Delpy and Tracy Letts as the parents of a little boy named Remi (Keaton Nigel Cooke) who has just emerged from an almost deadly battle with childhood leukemia. It's clear the adults have grown to despise each other and have stayed together only for the sake of their son.

In the episode, the dog, which Remi names Doody, becomes a symbolic repository of each family member's anxiety about life and death.

Another vignette features Gerwig as a veterinary assistant who rescues Doody after Remi's parents decide to have the dog put down. DeVito stars in a third piece as a screenwriting professor whose own writing career has stalled. Burstyn anchors the last piece as a terminally ill artist who is losing her eyesight.

Wiener-Dog has a satirical edge as sharp as any Solondz has fashioned, but it is also filled with disarming moments of absurdist humor.

Viewers wary of the director's reputation as a savage satirist will be pleasantly surprised by the deeply felt humanism in Wiener-Dog. Death may be a prevalent theme, but the film is deeply life-affirming.",1467676800,17,2258,5.175824175824176

If says it is about a wiener dog, who comes into and changes lives by speading joy. This couldn't be further from the truth. The movie is actually about the stories of some mostly miserable people who end up with this dog. The dog had very little to do with the story and the part could have been done by a stuffed animal. If the movie wasn't horrible enough already, it ends with the dog running into the street and in full view getting repeatedly run over and crushed, leaving blood and guts in the road.

6419414,4,B00KDF2NL6,"I decided to review this movie after reading other Amazon users negative comments. I saw this film in the theater and loved it. However, I was also mentally prepared for how bleak the movie can be, as I am a fan of the filmmakers other works, including but not limited to Happiness, its sequel Life During Wartime, and Welcome to the Dollhouse (a major release during the independent film movement of the 1990s). In fact, Dollhouse introduces us to the character Dawn Weiner Dog who figures prominently in this movie. It is hard to appreciate much of Weiner-Dog without knowing Dawns background. Overall, to really enjoy Weiner-Dog, you need to understand the filmmakers very dark (but also very human) universe. This movie is not for the casual viewer, nor is it the best introduction to the directors canon. But its pretty damn good in its appropriate context.",1528156800,,862,4.870748299319728

It started off good potential but quickly dropped from there! It was a horrible movie that didn't have anything to do with the wiener-dog in question. I think the worse put of the movie is the ending scene when the dog is hit by a truck!

6419422,2,B00KDF2NL6,"I went in with an open mind hoping for a dark comedy. In the end it was just dark, bleak, and utterly pointless. Let me save you some time: the first family that adopts wiener-dog has a son who survived cancer. Even though the dog brings the boy joy, the jerk dad decides to have it euthanized for having diarrhea. The mother tries to convince the boy death is a good thing. Ha ha? The vet tech 'steals' wiener-dog just before the injection, then runs off with a former classmate she runs into at a convenience store. She goes with him on a road trip to inform his brother their father died of alcoholism. Both his brother and the brother's wife have Down's syndrome and are the only bright points in this movie. They lavish w-d with affection. Vet tech is sweet and leaves wiener-dog with them as a gesture of true kindness. It jumps to bummed out Danny DeVito, a film school teacher. He's told to cheer up or he may be fired, and somehow this leads to a shopping spree. He buys the dog a yellow dress, and next thing you  know abandons the dog at the school with a bomb attached. I guess it was fake. Lastly, the terse elderly granny has w-d and names her 'Cancer'. Her ne'er do well granddaughter and 'artist' boyfriend show up to visit. Granny knows it's only to hit her up for $10,000. She cuts a check and the granddaughter abruptly leaves. Granny has a dream during a nap on her bench of versions of herself as a child if she had only done ___. They all look alike. The younger selves chant 'It all ends' or something like that, granny is startled awake to find w-d gone. She has run into the road and is run over by a semi. Then another. Then a car. Then another. Do they expect this to be funny? The sick director just had the gory scene go on and on. Nothing is left to the imagination. It then cuts to six months later, granddaughter's 'artist' boyfriend is showcasing wiener-dog at his show in a plastic case as a taxidermy exhibit. It is wired to turn and bark. That's it! The end. I am not worried about spoiling the movie because honestly it's impossible to spoil something that is already rotten. I hope to save someone the wasted time. Or just watch to when the vet tech leaves her with the couple. I gave one star for the dachshund, and one for that couple and the vet tech who gifted her to them.

The dog went from owner to owner but there was never a bridge, so it made you dislike the prior owners (perhaps without reason).  The ending was vulgar and horrific.  It sure showed how selfish and narcissistic the people were (all of the adults at least).

All of a sudden the Wiener-dog goes from living with a mentally challenged couple to intermission to Danny DeVito. It's the saddest animal movie , I have ever seen, but it is very well acted and makes good points. too extreme and too depressing...the only thing funny was the intermission and pictures of pop corn in the lobby. who can believe DeVito would buy a suit of bombs.

6419444,5,B00KDF2NL6,"Genius film. It is an art picture folks so if you don't get art then you won't get the film. It is a commentary of the dystopian American life. Money does not make you rich. If you can't care for a dog and you just buy one because you rich them you have no wealth the currency of compassion. For you life is meaningless. This is Capitalism. More and more for me and less and less for you. People are alone and isolated. There is no trust, but dogs have no choice: they have needs from us humans, so they must trust up to a point.  The more money that you have the more you will suffer trying to keep it. The dog shits all of those types. People seem to have more compassion as the film progresses but it is still the same dystopia. Taking money from others, or taking the dog by saving it from death and then dumping the dog on people that cannot possibly take care of a dog. Wiener-Dog is a metaphor for us. Humans running from job to job, relocating, putting up with sociopaths along the way. The scenes seem like metaphors for the events around us: terrorist rapist dog, mexicans that prefer Mexico, terrorist bombing, etc. The film is brilliant.

Innocent of much of a soundtrack and completely devoid of a laugh track, we get to see the writer/producer/actors try to wring both pathos and bathos out of their audience, to mixed successes. It appears that one or two of the humans the eponymous ""Weiner Dog"" meets on her adventures actually do care for the little dog, but the majority are so caught up in their ""lives of quiet desperation""  they completely miss the life lessons Weiner Dog is offering them. The tight little tie up at the end does lend some sort of a closure to this story, but one cannot help but be left wondering how much better a movie this would have been if someone involved in the process of making this movie had just posited "" What If,...

If we compare dogs to our spouse, it's easy to see why more than half of marriages end in divorce.  Humans can give up their commitment to each other, or flee from ourselves  (drug addiction) as a matter of convenience, ignorance, boredom, stupidity...That's not how canines operate. Pups are generous. Dogs do not neglect us. We have their full attention. They're indifferent to their own suffering, and non-judgmental about our flaws and the harm we cause them. Dogs are devoted for as long as they possibly can be under whatever circumstances we offer. Humans, on the other hand, are glib self-absorbed creatures. Death finds us all. Given the choice, we mess that up, too. ex. Damien Hirst.

There is a retarded couple who the dog is given to who obviously can't care for him. And there is an old lady who names the dog cancer and who watches as SPOILER ALERT the dog gets run over by several large trucks and becomes a spot on the road.

First story - boy loves dog but parents shouldn't be allowed to have a child or a pet. Most shameful are the idiotic excuses and explanations mom and dad give to the young boy (for example, mom tells story about poodle she had as a child that was raped and subsequently died giving birth as her teachable moment about spaying Weiner Dog - her son looks about 7! - followed with the rapist mutt violating ecerything in sight including squirrels).
Story 1 encourages the ""put them to sleep because I don't want to take time to teach them"" attitude.
Second story - vet agrees to put to dog to sleep because it pooped in house (really?) and assistant steals the dog, nurses her to health (boy in story one had fed her a granola bar because parents didn't teach him any different which resulted in the diarrhea and dad taking Weiner Dog to vet to be put to sleep). She runs into old friend/boyfriend that she hasn't seen in years and decides to take off on road trip with the drug addict friend.  I couldn't take any more at this point and shut it off.

6419508,4,B00KDF2NL6,"If you are going into this expecting a normal movie about a wiener dog well then you'll be disappointed.  This is a film about people.  It's really a series of short films tied together by a dog that gets tossed around from person to person.  While not hugely narrative, this film kept my interest.  There were some very cruel, cutting, and tragic moments interlaced with dark humor.  Ex. A girl meets up with an old high school friend in a gas station and after some meaningless small talk asks if they'd like to catch up sometime, and to her they reply ""well we already did just catch up"" and they proceed to walk away.  If that kind of social commentary jives with you than you may really enjoy this.  The first short was really my least favorite, but they got better after each story.  Though the acting felt sort of forced in many moments, there was an overarching style that allowed me to suspend my disbelief.  If you are fan of Todd Solondz then you will enjoy this, but it's definitely an art house film.  4 Stars because I had the feels at several points in the movie from the content.",1515283200,2,1095,4.402985074626866

It begins in a pound, adopted by poser suburbanites, and stolen by a geeky veterinarian assistant and dweeby heroin addict.

Like that movie a dog goes through a few owners but that's it for comparison. We don't see the world through the dog's point of view or anything with this one. There's some pretty low quality movies out there, but this one is up there with the best of them. The acting is pretty bad. The old guy who is the first owner of the dog's acting sets the bar with the awful standard you'll get throughout the movie. He and the other ""actors"" weren't helped from a really poor script, nor did it make their characters likable at all, with the only likable character being the old guy's kid but he wasn't the brightest child character in the world. All the characters in this are either not too bright or not nice people.

Danny DeVito is the only recognisable face in the movie but by the time he appears you're just feeling sorry for him thinking, gees I remember when this guy was an A-list actor. Other People's Money, Twins and so on, is this the only thing this icon get can get cast in these days? He does have the best leaving Wiener Dog moment in the film. In fact that's probably the highlight, other than the intermission. The intermission was way better than the actual film.

The film fails to explain other than when the veterinary assistant gets the dog how it ended up with its various owners throughout the film. Characters were inconsistent, the blonde girl with glasses is obviously somewhat intelligent enough if she can get qualifications and a job as a veterinary assistant but then as soon as she's got Wiener-Dog she's one of the dumbest people on the planet where you question how she even functioned on a daily basis of existence. The old lady story, you can at least feel some relief with that one for Wiener-Dog by its end.

6419616,5,B00KDF2NL6,"Todd Solondz's films have a strange, sobering way of being life affirming; they force one, as I think is the point, to actually examine their behavior and their place in the world and sort of stare down whatever nihilism/depravity/darkness is within them and be like NO! For this reason, of course most people will not care for the film. At least not on first glance.

The one point on which I will agree with the negative reviews: yes, the way the film is marketed is misleading and perhaps a little inappropriate. I think we all know why the approach was taken (unfortunately) to fool people into thinking this is a conventional Friday night ""comedy"" with a heartwarming through-line. Would that it were possible to market it as exactly the type of film it is and still, er, you know ""break even."" But that just isn't the world of entertainment we live in.

So in truth, the film is more akin to, well, Solondz's previous films, but more generally to a certain strain of art film that isn't often attempted in American cinema. The plot and moral outlook of the film bear deliberate resemblance to Robert Bresson's film Au Hasard Balthazar. Weiner Dog is Bressonian in other ways, too; in the (again, deliberately) stilted acting and spare, almost avant garde use of sound and image, for instance. But Solondz's message is much more modern than Bresson's. Too me, this film is about how Americans have become obsessed with death and destruction and so much of our behaviors are essentially meant to distract us from our legitimate fear of these things. If one looks closely, one will find that not all characters in this film do, in fact, fail to face their fears of death. The couple with down syndrome- who, as some have pointed out, are portrayed as the most sympathetic characters in the film but without a shred of sentimentality- for example, are as obsessed with death and as pettily distracted as anybody else. But the story they are in manages to end with a sort of catharsis and maybe even hope. I came across one review that accused Solondz of mocking the man with down syndrome in the cathartic scene I refer to. I claim the contrary; that scene shows that this character is the only one unafraid of expressing genuine bewilderment and frustration at death that we all feel at some point or other. It's the most sensitive portrayal of people with mental disabilities I've seen in any film.

There are various ways one could interpret the journey of Weiner Dog throughout the film. It could be that the film is in fact showing us two theoretical outcomes of the dog's existence. This is what I propose. Basically, if the sudden intermission halfway through the film does not tip you off to the fact that you are meant to step back and examine just why this narrative is doing what it's doing, then you really aren't paying attention. The film uses these Brechtian, fourth wall breaking devices at various other points. The song is just the most unsubtle use.

And lastly, the film does look gorgeous-melancholically so-- in how it was shot by Ed Lachman (an extremely underrated cinematographer, about as bold in the films he chooses to work on as Solondz is in the films he chooses to direct) and features standout work from Danny Devito and Ellen Burstyn in particular. Again, it's a really specific style of acting that is more common to older European films than anything we really see in American cinema, so perhaps it isn't surprising that the two older actors are the one's who really nail it. However, I did also admire the performance of the young Keaton Nigel Cooke, whom I hope to see in more films.

Not for every one, and other cliches. And yet, at the same time, for absolutely everybody, just maybe only once and with an advance warning for some.",1504656000,4,3773,4.684766214177979

6419621,4,B00KDF2NL6,"Todd Solontz has long been probably the most subversive U.S. film-maker, tirelessly tearing through the hypocrisy of the good people in ways few, few others dare. On an Amazon where only movies with happy endings and heroic, family-oriented people who are like no real person receive a high rating, this movie, not surprisingly, hovers around a 1 star. It doesn't help that it pretty much endlessly holds not one, but both middle-fingers at such audience. My favorite 1 star review here points out that the movie needs a warning ""...like cigarettes!"", and the reviewer complains how she held out for a happy ending that never comes!! It's the exact blindness to the world not being an afternoon soap opera, and where marching for breast cancer  allows people to cheat on their spouse and still feel great about themselves. that Solondz ruminates about in his comedies.  I think reading that review, he'd have a huge smile on his face.

Some of his early movies are among the best independent films of the last 20 years (Happiness and Welcome to the Dollhouse come to mind); but he's long been a critical darling with lukewarm to no popular success. If you, too, deplore an immense lack of honesty of people with others and themselves, while being able to laugh at absurdly different situations in which people ramble on while not realizing how what they say is pure irony, or simply unintentionally cruel, this movie might be for you.

Only Todd can get away with pairing Debussy with a sun-dappled tracking shot of a dog's sensitive stomach aftermath. I'm not so crazy about Todd bringing back characters in his films (this film minorly updates a character from his debut film Welcome to the Dollhouse; Life During Wartime is a sequel to Happiness), as I think his strongest work is his stand-alone films (Storytelling; Palindromes; Dark Horse). Danny Devito is great in this; Greta Gerwig was almost unrecognizable since I knew her from House of the Devil; and Solondz continues to illuminate the darkness of New Jersey/New York culture without making this film so much about place as his other films. It's a beautifully-shot film, golden-green northern NJ/southern NY state in early summer, and contrasts with the dark subject matter, which I think threw people for a loop, which is awesome. I love the sarcasm in which a film student talks seriously about his gender politics trans 90s queer blah blah blah film idea to a film teacher, but has nothing about plot, characters, etc. One reviewer is right: Solondz subtely packs a lot of hostility against current film trends (such as the gender politics 90s queer theory blah blah blah) in this film, showing that he's the eternal outsider to even a medium he's had some success in. Nobody cuts to the chase and is as honest in filmmaking as Todd Solondz, king of pausecore and the cinema of discomfort.

I do enjoy dark comedies from time to time but characters that you can't feel anything but revulsion for, don't make a movie watchable; the parents in the first plot were either given poor direction or the script was just poorly thought out.

the titular 'wiener-dog' is our ruse in 'visiting' various lives of 'others' and how they deal with the 'canine'. the first family is hilariously wealthy to the point of 'sterility' and when the son gives the dog a health-bar of some description, the dog has severe diarrhea so bad that they take it to be putdown/euthanized. as the dog is on the vets bed waiting for the 'end', the female attendant sees an opportunity and steals the dog, heals it and soon they're off on a road trip.
finally the dog winds up with a very VERY old blind oman who names the dog 'Cancer'. she's very attentive to the dog - if to no one else - and at the end she is in a park with Cancer and has a real 'weird' dream where a load of young girls dressed like characters from a romantic chocolate box visit her with good omens.

6419795,5,B00KDF2NL6,"Before damning it and hating it and weighing it on an everyday scale, please see it through, remaining open to the veiled reverence in this irreverent style of communication. Dark humor can be a very powerful tool in revealing our worst flaws and our greatest strengths. Don't be fooled. There's empathy and more understanding than first meets the eye. It's just half-hiding in that dark humor, in the sharpened tongue-in-cheek, and shocking delivery system. When, in 1961, Mike Nichols and Elaine May ""Examine Doctors,"" those brilliant seminal authors of modern-day comedy delivered a track on that album in which a doctor and nurse are bickering and whining about their relationship while performing surgery. Nichols, as the surgeon, says to May the nurse, ""I don't even know what I'm doing.""  She, distraught, says she wants to leave in the middle of surgery, and that there's nothing left to hand him because it's all in the patient.  The lovers of satire didn't then say how inappropriate and unprofessional  to trivialize the ordeal and gravity of the patient in surgery.  Solondz is that pair at the extreme end of the parody continuum. A second viewing of the film might assuage the initial shock. Or not. Solondz's characters keep asking ""what if""... ""and then what?""  And Wiener-Dog, the dog, provides a single-subject study of that question. She passes from owner to owner, as some event precipitates that outcome, allowing the next person or family, the what-happens-next, to enter her story and fill the void.  And there's lots of irreverence and shocking comments and behaviors, as well as instances of pathos and compassion. But as soon as we start feeling too sympathetic or sentimental, Solondz jerks us out of our commiseration, and leads us back onto the path of the outlandish and unorthodox, to spoof and parody.  After Wiener's ingestion of ""healthy"" people food, there might be a long slow pan of a moonlit trail of doggie ordure set to Debussy's ""Clair de Lune,"" or a mom might attempt to teach her son important life lessons, using wildly age-inappropriate detail.  How paradoxical can you get?  That mom, expertly played by Julie Delpy (Before Trilogy), clearly never learned the warning:  ""pas devant les enfants.""  But exactly that, doing it in the wrong way, exaggerates and brings emphasis to the absurdity and wrongness of it.  The cast is exceptional-- Julie Delpy, Greta Gerwig, and Danny DeVito, among the standouts. Keaton Nigel Cooke is a welcome surprise. Kieran Culkin, Bridget Brown, and Connor Long impress.  Solondz colors outside the lines. When humor is delivered, it's conveyed dispassionately, in the sense that there's no elbow poke, nor is any character required to laugh in response or engage in repartee. If you are a fan of ""Fleabag,"" even a reluctant one, you might want to check this one out--  but you'll definitely need to give poetic license a wide berth.",1490832000,3,2910,5.035416666666666

6419807,2,B00KDF2NL6,"Wiener Dog is not about a Weiner Dog. It is a series of vignettes about the Directors vision of middle class America in general and his bitterness about how he is viewed by those who don't like his movies specifically.

I grew up with Apocalypse Now(AN) and understood/understand it is less about the Vietnam war and more about Mans inner nature. It was a dark movie with some laughable moments. I appreciate other dark movies but use AN as an example.

From the get go, I knew that this wasn't a comedy, dark or otherwise. It is a cinematic editorial on life that uses a animal to get you interested. And it did. The 1st vignette was well done. Two  people who have no idea how to be compatible/caring parents/empathetic/appreciative of the joys of life. The father uses the dog as a stand in for his inability to connect with his son (It's not the dogs will he wants to break). The Mother uses the dog as a vehicle to voice her revulsion with sex(Dog rape anyone?). Which leaves the vulnerable son to show love to the dog in such a way that his relationship with the dog turns to crap (Which left me thinking ""OK! I get it! Enough already!) and then the parents remove the dog(Again, it represents their relationship with the boy) in the way they approach everything else, cowardly and without empathy.

At this point, if you don't know what will eventually happen to the dog, you're in denial.

The 2nd vignette was forgettable and the 3rd vignette was very clearly DeVito playing the part of  Solondz in the real world. Bitter, disappointed, angry that everyone doesn't realize what a genius he is but too weak emotionally to affect a change in his life. The ""It's not *my* fault you don't see my cinematic brilliance, you morons!""  life philosophy.

And the 4th vignette, which I labeled ""Vanity, vanity, all is vanity"", is how  Solondz sees his life ending. Alone, impotent, dreaming of what might have been, unable to live without assistance, and with people still wanting more from him. And for those of you still thinking it was about a dog? Solondz makes sure, not once, not twice, but three times, that this movie was never about the dog. Because it was *never* about the dog. The movie is about *Solondz* and he makes you pay for your attraction to the dog, and not him,  3 times over and then displays his anger with you by making a trophy of his anger.

Dark, hard hitting, predictable, a movie you will suffer through, but not funny. And just because I don't find it funny, doesn't mean I missed the movies message, M'kay?",1488758400,4,2537,4.553846153846154

This quirky but authentic comedy was more along the lines of Raising Arizona and the like. I really enjoyed seeing DeVito in a different role than what he usually gets and Ellen Burstyn was a pleasant surprise.. I would have given this 5 stars but the stories were a bit disjointed and I was hoping that the dog would prove to be the narrative,but there's no transition from owner to owner. They used 4 different dogs in each vignette and to me the dogs looked different. The dog vs car scene is clearly computer-generated, I don't see how anyone could think it was anything close to real, but our minds tend to fill in the missing actual pieces. Not an upper nor a downer but enjoyable to watch for the spectrum of characters, none of whom are either all good or all bad, but a mix and very genuine to watch.",1488153600,,1132,4.369668246445498

-The situations and characters are not supposed to be plausible or realistic. They are in line with director Todd Solondz's previous aesthetic, which is campy and stylized.

If you're aware of and prepared for the above, you'll probably like this movie.

The trailer makes it look that way, but it's standard-issue bleak Todd Solondz. I happen to be a fan, but I can't help feeling that he's in a bit of a rut with this being the latest of several movies with multiple unrelated narratives and the theme of general human awfulness punctuated by fleeting moments of affection. That's Solondz's stock in trade, so complaining about it is a bit like complaining that Wes Anderson only makes twee little dioramas -- knowing the man's work, why would you expect otherwise?

That said, the middle two stories are, er, enjoyable in their own right if you have a healthy appreciation for the grotesque. Fans of Welcome to the Dollhouse won't want to miss Dawn and Brandon's reunion, in which very little seems to have changed. Danny DeVito is also great as a film school teacher grappling with cretinous film school students and his own failure as an artist. The final story has good characters but a rather ham-handed dream/hallucination sequence just before Wiener-Dog's story comes to a close.

I love the conceit - the dog is the thing which ties it all together, but it's just a dog, and not a very smart one. It doesn't really participate in anything, it just watches as the incomprehensible humans around it lurch through their lives. For the most part, the dog brings out the best in them, what tenderness they have. Todd Solondz's movies seem to me to be about the difficulty of pulling off a life, the mess we make doing it, and the hope which glimmers just out of reach but which inspires us to take the next step, to wake up the next morning. When Greta Gerwig shyly puts her hand on Kieran Culkin's, we know that she's in for a LOT of trouble, and we might laugh at her naivety, but at the same time, we have to admire her hope.

There are a lot of negative reviews about this movie here, but it seems that most folks are missing the point.

6420025,4,B00KDF2NL6,"Back in the '90s, Solondz was one of a pack of up-and-coming American indie directors, along with the likes of Quentin Tarantino, Kevin Smith, Richard Linklater and Todd Haynes. After getting a lot of acclaim for his portraits of twisted ""losers"" in ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" and ""Happiness""-- one of the decade's defining films --  he slowly fell out of favor. In fact, you could probably trace the rise of the word ""comfortable"" in American English -- as in ""I'm not comfortable with that"" -- over the arc of Solondz' fall.

The consensus view of his work started to shift with 2001's ""Storytelling"", which featured a notorious scene with Robert Wisdom and Selma Blair that seemed designed to make people's heads explode. Where his portraits of Middle American Ugly were once viewed as wickedly transgressive, now that he trained his eye on issues of race and political correctness, Solondz was branded a misanthrope, a miserabllist, a hater.

As far as I can see, he's never changed a bit. Behind his slightly nerdy demeanor -- thick rimmed eyeglasses, button-down shirts, and shock of gray hair -- lies the heart of a punk, someone who's certain that society is filled to the brim with hypocrites, phonies, bullies, whack jobs, and brown-nosers, seething with narcissism, self-loathing, and toxic passive-aggression.

The brilliance of Todd Solondz is his ability to make you laugh at the most inappropriate moments, then make you feel dirty about it one beat later. That's certainly true of the director's latest, ""Wiener Dog"", which features a cute little dachshund in the title role, but dog lovers expecting another ""Marley and Me"" will probably leave the cinema calling for the director's head.  Four interlocking stories show the dog pass through the  hands of four generations of owners: a child with cancer  and stressed, overprotective parents;, a young adult who seems pretty aimless in her life, and hits the road with an old flame;  a university film school prof who's quite burned out, and a sour old lady who's getting hit up for money by her granddaughter.  If you crossed the gentle moralising of  Eric Rohmer with the sick jokes of John Waters, you might end up with this. I laughed long and hard, but some people would  call me a bad person for that.  Such is life; Solondz is laughing at the void, whereas most people just don't even want to think about it. It  makes them, well, ""uncomfortable"".  If the very use of that word drives you up the freaking wall, you will love Todd's movies.",1482969600,,2512,4.88

This movie, however, was just a dismal, depressing display of meaninglessness as far as I can tell.  I always sit all the way through any movie however bad it is.  I have to admit, this movie was the exception.  At one point I had to start fast forwarding through this bomb of a movie because I realized that I was going to waste 88 minutes of my life if I didn't.  But I saw most of the movie, and I can tell you this... The wiener dog really had nothing to do with the movie whatsoever.  The dog was merely owned by a sequence of characters in the film, and none of these sequences had anything to do with the others.  It might as well have been a chair or a table lamp that was passed from one owner to another - it would have made as much sense.  Even some entertaining actors like Danny Devito, Zosia Mamet, and Ellen Burstyn couldn't save this pointless script.

Then all of this chaos fastward got to a point where the owner was a drug user and took a girl to another state, and picked up a mariachi trio and took them to another state and dropped them off. then the dog was given to a couple who had down syndrome. then a grandma got ahold of the dog, and she had a granddaughter that was dating a black upcoming artist and the granddaughter got the grandma to give her money for his project. then the dog got away since she wasn't taking care of it and it stopped in the middle of the street and it got ran over by a lot of vehicles.

I'm a person who usually likes complex and ""hard-to-digest"" plots, difficult subject matter, etc. And, truth be told, this film has stayed with me and I do continue to reflect deeply on it. But, ultimately I need to rank this film poorly because, as an actual dachshund owner, watching this film was nothing short of traumatic and deeply disturbing. To the point where I would recommend some sort of warning label for dachshund owners.
*SPOILER ALERT* For a dachshund owner, this film is an emotional roller coaster ride, and the worst part is that the ride ends with being subjected to watching your best friend get run over by not one, but THREE cars, in gritty, realistic detail. I am a grown man and I DID cry and lose a night's sleep over seeing this poor innocent animal become roadkill at the end of the film, after being subjected to extreme negligence by owner after owner throughout the story. This is supposed to be a comedy, but I don't believe I laughed. The mistreatment of dachshunds is not something most dachshund owners can laugh through, even highly artistic ones who appreciate a good artistic exploration of mortality and existentialism.",1480723200,,1193,4.796116504854369

No, this isn't the cute little fun doggy movie you may have thought it was. No, this film is not for everyone and it certainly isn't your grandma's family comedy movie. And for Pete's sake, animal abuse? People actually watch this film and then rush to cry ANIMAL ABUSE! I apologize, but I do not easily tolerate people who can't let go of their own expectations or their own sensitivity to sit down and experience a piece of art. Instead of being entitled and dismissive when a film subverts your expectations, just try buckling up for the ride and experiencing it for what it really is. I promise you will find more enjoyment in art if you stop expecting it all to conform to your ideals.

Wiener-Dog is a sad, funny, harshly beautiful depiction of life itself. Each of the 4 stories follows a character at a pivotal time in their life. The dog is not only symbolic, but a vehicle for the audience to travel to and from these stories. The ending says something harsh about life and about us all. But, is life not harsh? Can we not forgive a filmmaker, or even praise them, for treating us with intellect? This is among my favorite films of 2016 and I hope that if you read this review, you will understand how I feel.",1480464000,24,1495,4.413043478260869

6420163,5,B00KDF2NL6,"I'll make this brief. First, all the low ratings I am seeing on here are from the sort of people in this world who simply do not want to face the bad things around them and would rather focus on cheery thoughts. That sort of viewer has no business leaving a review, because that sort of viewer has no capacity to enjoy negativity. Such a person may as well have watched the movie in a foreign language.  If you are willing to laugh at absurdity rather than sit there and try to figure it all out, then you are probably smart enough and mature enough to enjoy this film.

Rather than review the film as such, I will simply say that Todd Solondz is my favorite director, and this work is yet another gem among all of his other endeavors. His ability to rub our faces in the wiener dog pile in the yard of life is nothing short of pure genius. If you've enjoyed Happiness, Welcome to the Dollhouse, Storytelling, Palindromes and Life During Wartime, then this film is a sure bet. It is as simple as that.

I saw the cast and thought; wow this will be good.

It is a poor attempt to have a dog be a common thread in several peoples lives that otherwise know nothing of each other. A rip-off theme of the movie Crash lacking the screenplay, acting, script and execution.

The movie has story lines that are not believable and all the while you watch as a dog is mistreated, un-loved, abandoned, disregarded and practically an inanimate backdrop prop.

The movie and its story drag. The script flip-flops from elementary school humor to attempts at intelligence that not only leave you disappointed, disgusted and bored but they do that from the 3rd minute of the movie till the end.

I don't even return a cold cup of coffee for a two dollar refund but I would like my $4 back and another 100 for therapy.",1477872000,5,813,4.5479452054794525

This led to another story with the animal shelter aide ""saving"" it by stealing it home. This second story began to have promise when the girl met up with an old high school friend and joined him on a quest for a sort of family connection.

So, all the stupid first world problems we patiently wade through jack hole characters on dope or being cranky about something.. hoping Todd Solodnz has something interesting to say.. the one innocent character in the whole movie gets violently destroyed.  Yeah, dogs get run over.  Yep, that's correct.  Also, feces squeezes out of peoples anus'.  Also, boogers get pulled from noses.

6420412,5,B00KDF2NL6,"I've got two miniature Dachshunds, and when I walk them, even three year old kids (and occasionally rednecks in passing vehicles) yell out ""Wiener Dogs!"" in total delight - this is a funny little dog breed with a funny little nickname. Ordinary folks love wiener dogs, and love the idea of a movie featuring wiener dogs.

Well, this movie's a bear trap for those people. Take a moment to marvel at what Solondz has done here from a marketing perspective alone: Ordinary people aren't familiar with the diabolically devious director's previous works, like the one about a pedophile who preys upon his son's sleepover pals. Or the one about the anti-abortion vigilante who accidentally snipers a toddler in the head. Or the one about a child sociopath who psychologically abuses his family's maid so she burns him, and them, to death. That's OK. ""Welcome to the Dollhouse.""

So, if you're an ordinary person, perhaps new to this director, consider yourself warned: Don't expect this unassuming little film to feed your brain more and more mashed potatoes. Ignore the cutesy look of the poster. Instead, ask yourself, do I really want to watch a Todd Solondz movie tonight? Use your Google. This is Todd Solondz at his most tame and crowd-pleasing, yet even his mildest offering is clearly too much for general audiences to accept.

An explanation: Wiener-Dog is a funny, clever, and alternately sympathetic and cruel bit of mischief set up by a funny, clever, and alternately sympathetic and cruel trickster director who found the perfect edge by riding the thin line between questionable taste and blind humanism.  Todd Solondz generously exposes the laziness, weakness of character, and hypocrisy of the audience  sometimes vigorously -- and they don't always thank him for it. If you don't like his characters, you don't like people, and if you don't like his stories, you don't like life. If he's not Jesus, he's Manson. One or the other.

This is indie, dark, and often mean stuff by a virtuoso audience player. The cringing and wrestling with one's judgement is woven into his storytelling. Fans get interested in and care about his protagonists because, like many of us, his weirdos are oblivious to their own gaping flaws, completely delusional, and that resonates with the outcast inside of us all. And, unfortunately, for all the haters of his work, it's truly brilliant storytelling. We really like these characters. But, characters they are, and props they are, and like the wiener dog in this film, all are merely devices.

I, for one, was impressed by the director's previous work, especially his pair of vignettes called ""Storytelling,"" so this being a sequel of sorts made it a must-see and did not disappoint. Whereas in ""Storytelling"" you got two, beefy and ironic punches in the gut, here you get four light love taps. Snack Bites. Tapas. It's an exercise in lean, mean storytelling, if you go for that sort of thing.

Check it out if you're not afraid to burst your own bubble.",1476230400,,2995,4.928571428571429

Nice insight into death, spaying, euthanasia, and loose bowels in a pet.

Beautifully shot, great dialogue, music A-1,  fab characters who were united in story only by the chubby, eponymous dachshund.  This is a terrific Indy film and kudos to Julie Delpy for continuing to give her acting support to such intriguing works.

Yet, the sub-text said a heck of a lot about loneliness, the acceptance of death and the alienation of various groups of people.

6420463,3,B00KDF2NL6,"Okay, so I think all of the one- and two-star reviews of this film are unfair. Its not the greatest film ever made but it has its merits. I happened to watch this on Prime Video the other day, just by chance, and I couldn't look away.

First, in order to understand the style of this movie, I think the prerequisite is to maybe see one of Solondzs earlier films like Welcome to the Dollhouse, which I saw in the movies in Manhattan when it first came out. Todd Solondz is one of those odd directors who cannot be mistaken for anyone else. On the popular end side of the spectrum of unique directors, you get people like Wes Anderson and Tim Burton who appeal to many. On the other end of the spectrum, you get people like John Waters and Todd Solondz, who have more of a niche audience. I tend to like all of these directors for different reasons. The point is Todd Solondz has a very specific, dark approach to storytelling, drawing from all that is grotesque (not quite as grotesque as John Waters, but close). Every film I have seen of his (Welcome to the Dollhouse, Happiness, Palindromes, Storytelling) all come from a dark and disturbing soul. That said, there is room for this in the bigger scheme of cinema.

This film also has some issues but starts off well enough. Its the story of a very adorable dachshund who, over the course of her seemingly short life, is bounced around from home to home and subjected to the personalities of various human beings  some worse than others. She starts out as the puppy to a sick child and his cold, distant parents (Tracey Letts and Julie Delpy) who actually loathe animals (go figure). When the child feeds Wiener-Dog (her name) a granola bar and she has digestive issues as a result (with about a mile length of doggy diarrhea, in fact), the parents decide the only course of action is to put the dog down and be done with it. Just as Wiener-Dog is about to be put down, the vet tech dog naps her from the jaws of death and renames her Doody. Next thing you know, Doody and her new owner are on a spur-of-the-moment road trip with an addict friend (Kieran Culkin) who has a Downs-Syndrome brother with a Downs-Syndrome wife. The couple is very sweet and live in a nice little home and just like that, Doody seems to have found her happy place with them. Then theres a very funny (at least I thought so) intermission with a Wiener-Dog video and song.

After the intermission, the film starts to fall apart. One issue is lack of continuity. In the first half of the film, we see Wiener-Dogs transition from one owner to the next. When we next meet Wiener-Dog, she is now pet to a washed-up one-hit wonder screenwriter/professor played rather effectively by Danny DeVito. However, we don't know how she transitioned from the Downs-Syndrome couple, who seemed to be in love with her, to the nutty professor. No clue. At the end of that vignette, it appears she gets blown up. But then, shes pet to a cancer-stricken woman (Ellyn Burstyn) and we don't know how she has transitioned to her new owner who now calls her Cancer and under whose ownership she meets a violent and bloody death. The end.

So, Im not sure if the first half was one thing  Wiener-Dog finds her happy place  and that the second half is Wiener-Dog meets her end - with vignettes that are unrelated to each other with Wiener-Dog playing different roles in each. Unclear.

As a side note, when I was in the Screenwriting program at NYU after receiving my MFA, Todd Solondz, a former student and friend of one of my teachers (Arnie  I forget his last name), came to our class one night as Arnies guest to talk to us about the craft (actually, I kept thinking that the Danny DeVito character WAS Arnie, but anyway). He was interesting but odd and yet forthcoming about the fact that he is admittedly not among the mainstream of directors. He also talked about being anti-social and how effed up the industry is and that to maintain control, you have to both write and direct. Thats all that I can remember of the substance of what he said although he also told us a story about insulting an industry big wig at a party by not talking to him, which illustrated the effed-up-ness of the industry as a whole, though I forget whom it was he spoke about at the time (if he even gave us a name, which he might not have  cant remember now). But, I do find his work interesting and the visual quality of his films has come a long way since Welcome to the Dollhouse (which is already a difficult film to watch, theme-wise, but with production values that left a lot to be desired). I think theres a level of brilliance in this directors work that seems to fly under the radar at times. I don't think this is his best work (I liked the experimental quality of Palindromes, personally) but he does have the craft down and he does have a personal style stamp on his work that I can appreciate.

I don't think this is a film for everyone, but if you are open to experimental or unusual independent work, give this a try and decide for yourself if its worthy of praise or not.

6420466,4,B00KDF2NL6,"I will never watch this movie again. It's that good and that bad. If you like animals, love animals, live with animals or know someone who ""owns"" animals, this movie will confront you with some very powerful messages. Good filmmaking asks questions, tells a compelling story and holds up a mirror so that we can clearly see ourselves and our own actions within the script. This movie does so, in a very uncomfortable way. Watching ""Wiener Dog"", I found myself charmed and hopeful, then appalled and horrified. Ultimately, I cringe with embarrassment for humans as a species. We call ourselves Homo Sapiens (wise men, ha!) and consider ourselves to be the pinnacle of evolution and higher order thinking. This movie strengthened my conviction that we, as humans, do not deserve dogs. If you can struggle through this movie to the end, you may find yourself wanting to turn in your humanity card. I know I do. I just want to go hug my dog and apologize for everything humans do to animals.

I have a little dachshund and love her with all my might. Cutest thing in the opening scene: with all the dogs barking in the background, my little stinker couldn't take her eyes off the screen. The movie progressed as independent films made by film students trying to make a statement do.

Supposedly the movie was about the dog and it did follow brief segments of the four owners' lives while they had Weiner Dog/Doodee/Cancer. Sadly, the dog was in too few shots as the title character.

SPOILER ALERT
The final moments of the movie took a weird, and then sickeningly sad turn after the final owner had the weirdest dream I've seen outside of something from Mulholland Dr. She wakes up and Cancer isn't at her side. You hear the semi coming, she yells, ""Cancer!"" And the truck runs right over the dog leaving a wheel mark down the middle of the body with the head and tail intact. You then get to sit and watch as another semi and a couple other cars proceed to make more of a mess. It's a train wreck from which you can't look away but is so needless. There's a brief, mild attempt at an artistic statement ten seconds later but it falls pretty flat.

Spoilers:

Animal cruelty is horrible, but this isn't a movie about animal cruelty.  Several horrible things happen to the dog (not really, of course, as the movie has an ASPCA endorsement in its credits), but it doesn't feel as though they're done as a joke or to provide mere spectacle.  In my opinion, the film portrayed the story of a typical dog--whose life, like all of ours, is a mixture of happiness and despair--with an atypical number of owners.

None of the dog's owners seemed cruel, and the harm they caused was born from ignorance, homicidal depression, or inattentiveness.

The dog's death was quick, and she was presumably insensate by the time she might have experienced further trauma, which seemed like an only slightly hyperbolized example of a death of that nature.  I lost a dog that way, and it was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life, but it also may have desensitized me to the scene.  I was able to laugh, not at the death of the dog, obviously, but at the hyperbole.

If your mind is broad enough to accept both states of tragicomedy at once, this movie will deliver them.  It's okay to laugh and cry about the same situation.

If I didn't feel the need to counterbalance the negative reviews, I would have deducted one star for the short runtime.  I agree with the opinion some have expressed about the trailer--it spoiled some of the better jokes.  With a little extra effort, this movie could have been high-flown enough to escape the bulk of its criticism.",1474761600,13,1715,4.651162790697675

6420621,1,B00KDF2NL6,"First of all I would like to cite the things about this film i enjoyed. It was very well written from a storytelling standpoint. I enjoyed the way that the writer did not seem to ever spell out things and insult the viewers intelligence. Like instead of saying ""hey this kid had cancer"" There is a single line his father says where he refers to his hair growing back. The audience then has to put things together and figure out what is going on. Also I liked how things unfolded and how we are slowly dragged into liking some of these characters. Things unfold slowly and at a very nice pace. However sometimes things got disjointed. Like a couple of times the dog goes from family A to family B and we aren't sure and aren't given any hints as to how she got there. But overall I did like the way the story unfolded.

With that said, a nicely TOLD story doesn't make the story itself any good. It flowed from one depressing, heartbreaking moment to the next with very little redemption. You walk away from this film feeling sad, without hope and a bit sick to be honest. I regret seeing the movie and feel a bit cheated. It felt like a set up that had no punchline. I give it one star for the way the thing is written, but I would not recommend it overall.",1474761600,3,1257,4.2594142259414225

I like him very much so I knew essentially what to expect and liked the film okay.

i think it's strange how so many people can get upset by one little climactic scene in a film. i think the film's content towards the end is an interesting experiment in what an audience deems ""unfilmable"". and that's exactly what i like about solondz. he goes into strange territories you don't necessarily see coming, and shows you things you don't really want to see.",1474675200,,864,4.294478527607362

That being said Greta Gerwig was excellent as a grown-up Dawn, and Ellen Burstyn and Danny DeVito were both outstanding.  From a social commentary perspective the themes are current (e.g. the vapidness and entitlement of the millennial generation).

6420723,1,B00KDF2NL6,"I went into this movie thinking this is going to be an uplifting film about the impact one dog can have on different peoples lives.
This was not that, at no point in this movie did I laugh or think it was clever. I just kept asking myself why am I watching this movie. No part of it was funny and nor did I think any part of it was reliable. I don't write reviews on movies that much, I think people should know this movie was awful, and the review stars will show that. If this is the common material this director puts out then he should not being a director. I don't think its funny or clever to represent any dog the way this film did. it is not clever or funny to proclaim male dogs to be rapist, nor is it appropriate to show a dog getting ran over four times, or to strap a bomb on a dog. Also dogs are not just animals that are unimportant, and need to be submission to humans. Dogs would still be here if they weren't mans best friend.

This film left me highly disturbed, saddened, shocked, and angered - not necessarily a bad thing for those who love the art of film and story telling. However, as someone who loves dogs, I would advise other dog-lovers to stay away from this film. This is not a pleasant story. This is not a feel-good movie. Keep in mind, however, that ""Wiener-Dog"" was never meant to be ""Hachi"" or ""Homeward Bound"". Some stories are uplifting and heart-warming. This is not one of them. But then again, not all stories have happy endings.

Overall, ""Wiener-Dog"" was a film that left me feeling awful inside as it showcases the worst parts of human nature and how it causes the most innocent character in the film to become the victim in the worst way. The poor dog becomes a target of people's misery, regret, and fear.

As a former dog owner, I understand how people could get upset. As someone who views the world from all sides, this movie clearly illustrates how much we love dogs, but don't always think of how to really cherish them comparable to what they give us.

Keaton Nigel Cooke plays with our hearts by using the iconic and adorable dachshund hound-dog, with her sweet demeanor and cute little legs. Then he successfully breaks our hearts about 5 times. And at the end, I felt flat. To me, this movie should have had 4 endings... each story with it's own climax (to me, there were 1 good climax, 1 that was just okay).

As for the looks of the film, the cinematography was well done, the lighting was a little weak, but the story flowed nicely, production designed and edited well.

However, if you're willing to go along with this world-view for an hour and a half, you may find yourself surprised not only by how much laughing you'll enjoy, but how much humanity there is to find in these characters. If you're willing to wade through the sense of impending meaningless death, you'll be rewarded by beautiful moments like Zosia Mamet's sudden confession to her grandmother and one of the most delightful Intermissions in cinematic history. Please, don't just look, see Danny DeVito's name, and walk in expecting a mainstream comedy only to add to the litany of bad reviews written by people who are clearly not part of the intended audience.

I felt the need to stick up for this movie. Obviously, Todd Solondz does not make movies for everyone. But if you enjoy keenly observed, well crafted film making, you owe it to yourself to check this film out.

I'm not up to the task of giving any kind of thoughtful criticism that will illuminate the themes of this movie (see opening paragraph for evidence to support this conclusion), but I will say that Solondz manages to treat his characters with both savage honesty, and delicate sensitivity simultaneously. I both laughed and teared up. Was by turns, appalled, amused, horrified, and touched by the characters and the situations they found themselves in.

Don't be taken in by these other reviews that seem to claim that because a movie challenges you that it is bad. A great work forces you to wrestle with unsettling feelings you don't wish to acknowledge. This film even somehow surpasses great by entertaining you wile disturbing you. It might be his best effort yet. If at the end of watching this movie, you find yourself hating it and Mr. Solondz, it's probably because you hate humanity.",1473724800,49,1330,4.6752136752136755

Somehow the dog gets internal bleeding from eating a single granola bar. They take the dog to have it euthanized and the mom explains to the son that his dog will probably be cremated, which means being put in an oven.

This could have been a fun, heartwarming movie with ""Wiener-Dog"" linking the vignette plots together. It could have been a series of lightly linked episodic twists in a dog's life. Unfortunately, it was neither fun nor heartwarming, two characteristics that are usually associated with the comedy genre, and the linkage between stories was tenuous, if not completely abandoned by the third installment. Instead, it was a series of short stories about generally dysfunctional people who by mischance cross paths with an otherwise innocuous dachshund, ultimately to the canine star's extreme misfortune. The banal, yawn-inspiring pace was further bogged down by some scenes that overstayed their welcome like the boring uncle that doesn't know when to say ""goodbye"". The only highlight of this movie was our Chi-weenie's reaction to the opening sequence. She usually pays no attention to anything on the TV, but for some reason the sight of the dachshund in the animal shelter cage caught her attention and she growled, then barked at it until that scene was over. That should have been fair warning.

If you like animals of any sort, give this movie a pass. If you're still determined, don't say I didn't warn you.",1473724800,,1318,5.018264840182648

But, in my defense I did watch the trailer which deceived me into thinking it was a heartfelt comedy and the Weiner-Dog would give hope and a happy ending to these dysfunctional people.  This was the reason I kept watching to the bitter end.  As I continue to watched, I couldn't  believe theses actors who associated themselves to this movie.  Only reason I could come up with is there were no other offers. Why else would attach you name to a movie with examples of rape to a child, animal cruelty, disrespecting people with special needs and in the climate of today's concerns use acts of terrorism as humor. I wish I could un-watch this movie, but since I can't I can do the next best thing and never watch another Todd Solondz film again. Maybe others might find him brilliant for tricking unsuspecting viewers and shocking them, I find his methods despicable. And as I find myself in uncharted waters having watched the worst movie and feeling  strong enough  to voice my opinion, while knowing my opinion may not matter, but feeling better letting people know that this movie was depressing, dysfunctional and disgusting!

That said, this is not the best of Solondz's films but it is a solid entry, nonetheless. The film is pretty loose in the plot department, it's really a series of loosely connected vignettes. The acting is stellar across the board and the dialogue is typically funny (to me), sad, and disturbing.

One follows up on ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"", directed by Todd Solondz. Without giving too much away, the last vignette is the most ironic. This is a great quirky dark comedy.

Trivia: Following an angry response from some audience member at the January 2016 Sundance premier, a few festival reviewers purposefully spoiled the film in detail so as to deter animal lovers from seeing the film.

I suspect this is why there are so many one star reviews here. I also suspect many will find this review not helpful for the very same reason. If you enjoy unique dark comedies, I recommend you watch this one and write your own review.",1473465600,11,755,4.8

  This is an existential film dealing with how our life choices dramatically affect our circumstances. The wiener-dog is the witness. Naive and loyal, she has nothing to offer except for affection. She is the victim of our circumstances.
  If you don't know Todd Solondz's work you might want to get acquainted with it before diving, like a naive wiener-dog, into this film...""Welcome to the Doll House"" and ""Happiness"" are both good places to start.

Also, other than the first two handoffs, there was no explanation of how or why the dog was given to the last two owners.  And the ending was horrible!

The poor dog gets mistreated the whole way, she's never given a real name, and is then promptly killed by a truck where the camera sits and forces you to watch this poor dog get run over by at least 3 more cars before it ends with her body being turned into an incredibly morbid and disturbing animatronic ""art"" installation that turns and barks you.

How Danny deVito and Ellen Burstyn signed on is beyond me. Example: There is an endless dolly shot following a trail of diarrhea on the pavement.

I love dogs and rarely watch dog movies because in general dog movies involve the death of the dog. I was bracing myself during the course of the film as I'd read the reviews and knew that the dog was going to die. That said, this movie ended up being a very different sort of film, and one I would watch again. Usually dog movies are very sentimental and feature good owners who love and care for their dogs, but this film was more realistic in that these dog owners ran the gamut from selfish and petty, to insecure and irresponsible, and Solondz skewers them brilliantly with his dark satire.

It should be given five negative stars.  It's not DARK HUMOR, as advertised, but the blackest of black evil.  Think animal abuse mixed with sick, twisted, depressed humans when considering this movie for viewing.  It touched on not only animal abuse, but the humiliation of the mentally challenged, the  psychological abuse of a sick child, drug abuse, and the financial manipulation of an elderly woman, and that just highlights the main points.

There are several moments in this film that make quite obvious that the writer, director and producers did not care about the project or the audience. the cinematographer didn't even care to correctly light the 3rd act correctly. There is no deeper reasoning, social commentary or subtext here, although they tried really hard to add that in, it comes off as  lazy film making with a couple of poorly conceived jokes.

But it was funny in a strange sense, (the Doo-dee song) and very tragic in a lot of ways--shows the depravity of man, the hopelessness of life without God. Certainly not a feel-good movie.

The first three vignettes transition from one to the other by showing the handing off of the dog from one character to another, but that stops and you are left wondering how the dog managed to get to Danny DeVito in LA when she was last in the possession of the couple in Ohio. If you're going to write a transition for some parts, you should write one for all. All of the characters are pretty loathsome and the dog itself is rendered as a bland one-dimensional creature. Parts of the film are absurd but for no apparent reason other than to break the tedium of a parade of such dry, unlikable characters. The highlight for me was in the last vignette when the grandma is visited by all her alternative young selves, which are indistinguishable from each other.

First of all, this movie isn't about a dog, its about death/mortality. After reading the description I was expecting a sort of My Dog Skip or even canine Black Beauty type movie. What I got was a disjointed, dark film that left me staring at my screen in disbelief.

I don't know what was more disturbing, the scene where a mother was telling her young son the story of her childhood dog being raped by a greasy stray named Mohammed (wtf?), the 2 minute montage of bloody diarrhea, the scenes of Kieran Culkin being a drug addict that seemed sadly realistic, Ellen Burstyn chugging a whole bottle of Kaopectate, or the fact the dogs names throughout the film were just Wiener Dog, Doody and Cancer.

Seriously, only the dogs scenes with her first owners (mostly mistreating her) in the first 15-20 mins actively involved the dog as a part of the film. Throughout the other hour she was barely more than a prop. They could have replaced the dog with a stuffed animal or even a freaking lamp that was passed around and the majority of the movie would have been the same. Not only that but it seems that past the first three owners of the dog, the film makers didn't seem to feel the need to explain how the dog was given to the next owner or the next, she just magically appeared beside new people with no rhyme or reason as to how she got there.

The film is full of weird, creepy and awkward scenes, many of which involve painfully long shots of boring or gross things (like previously mentioned diarrhea), or the dog doing nothing but looking uncomfortable in a cage. And lets not forget that despite having at least 3 good actors, the vast majority of the cast was godawful. I also feel like they directed any children in this film to be as creepy and weird as humanly possible. There were a few times I laughed, Ill admit. But it was less Hah!

For anyone who approaches film with a serious mind, Solondz is considered one of the more talented and original U.S. writer-directors of the last 20 years.

6421974,2,B00KDF2NL6,"EDIT:  After deciding to give this movie a second chance and finishing it, I can say that my view has increased slightly.  After weathering the initial trainwreck that is the first 20 minutes of the movie, I started to understand more of what this movie was about: an innocent dog being surrounded by idiotic and careless people.  We are SUPPOSED to be angry and feel bad for the dog.  It definitely becomes more watchable after the 20 minute mark, but not by much.  There is still no plot and nothing compelling about any of the situations, but I started to appreciate the purpose (albeit a negative one) of this movie.

The happy happy trailer and the family friendly description of this movie from Amazon is absolutely NOTHING like the actual movie.  Do NOT let kids watch this movie.  Truly awful.  Watched the first 20 or so minutes before I shut it off.  Had so much potential to be an enjoyable family-friendly film, but it was anything from that.  You can say its my fault for not knowing of this director, but the description of the movie makes it seem like a Hallmark channel movie which you can watch with your kids and have a good time.  Between the swearing, snobby and straight-up A-hole parents, and the moronic kid, this movie will truly make you angry even if you aren't a dog owner.  It even has racism towards Middle Eastern people for good measure.  Yes, I understand this is supposed to be a commentary about how to not treat animals, but it was 100% negative criticism and the director gave no suggestions to fix them.  I stopped watching just as the perspective of characters changed, so I may give this movie another chance down the road.",1472688000,3,1662,4.5864406779661016

 Best segment IMHO was DannyDevito as the aging, marginally successful film school teacher.  The parody of the fillm generation process, the film school industry, the intolerance of the young were masterfully played.  Should cause a major decline in film school applications.

I also loved Ellen Burstyn as the old grandmother: totally perfect depiction of the aged ""used to be"" that one meets all over the UWS.  Plus the setting of her house was exquisitely right.  Kudos to the person who designed/found that set!  Ive been in just such rooms.

I think it is the poor treatment of the dog that has made people hate this film so much, so it would be my hope that perhaps people recognize their hatred is not toward the film but rather for how the dog was treated.  I hope this  results in a push for better laws for dogs and pets in general.  I don't think as many people would have hated the film if the dog had been omitted, which is why i believe the maker of the film is trying to show the poor treatment too many dogs encounter.  We should promote the film to invoke change and maybe no dogs will have to live the life this poor wiener dog had.  Be warned - this film is NOT a comedy.  there is NOTHING funny about this film.",1472342400,46,1412,4.0577617328519855

6422030,5,B00KDF2NL6,"You will not like this movie if you don't like/understand dark comedy, can't handle sad endings, don't like movies that make you think, or are easily offended. One guy walked out during the first 5 minutes of the movie during my viewing. You will like this movie if you are a fan of Welcome to the Dollhouse and ever wanted to find out what happens to Dawn Wiener, Brandon McCarthy, and even Tommy McCarthy as adults. The movie would have been better with Brendon Sexton III and Heather Matarazzo, but apparently Heather said she would never play that character again. Some people are saying that Todd Solondz must hate dogs and that you won't like this movie if you love dogs. I don't think this is true. I don't think he is saying what the first family in the film does to the dog is good, just something that happens and is an issue. Like Dawn Wiener, I used to work in an animal hospital. I can't tell you how many times people would call the clinic asking how they can get rid of their dog or cat. People buy these animals from pet stores not understanding the responsibility. Dogs bark, pee, poop, and sometimes get sick. After giving these people who no longer want their pets information for local shelters, they would often call back a few minutes later because all the shelters in town are at full capacity and now they want to dump the animal somewhere. Sometimes a crate full of kittens would be left on the front door of the clinic in the morning. I thought the filmmaker did a good job showing an example of this type of family that never should have taken home a pet in the first place. Luckily for the title character, Dawn Wiener takes the dog in and she reunites with Brandon and we find out what happens to Tommy, and there is even mention of Ralphy and Mr McCarthy. The next part of the movie, Danny DeVito has the dog. I felt bad for his character, but he ends up doing something awful in the end. Again, I don't think the filmmaker is saying what Danny Devito does is good, but something that happens and is an issue to think about. The last section of the movie is about a grandmother and granddaughter. I really liked the grandmother character but I imagine a lot of people will think she is a B. I thought she was bad-ass. And when her granddaughter leaves, it is clear that the grandmother really cares about her and is worried and concerned for her and wishes she could help her more. I was confused by the grandmother's dream sequence and will have to see the movie again. She is visited by many different possible versions of herself. I thought maybe this could mean, each of the four parts in the movie could be 4 possible lives of the dog. Then I thought that this was more about Dawn Wiener, as she was after all, known as Wiener-Dog. What happens to her in this movie is another possible outcome as to what happened to her in Palindromes. What happens at the end of the move is sad and the movie theatre was silent. I don't know if it was supposed to be funny but it wasn't. I was not surprised though as there was so much foreshadowing. And again, don't think the filmmaker is saying what happened to the dog was a good thing, but something that could happen and is an issue. The Humane Society was in the credits in the end of the movie and if they are supporting the film, really don't think the message of the movie is anti-dog. Humans use animals in so many different ways, for uses in medical research, animals are forced into being tools of entertainment for us in the circus and other venues and are trained using negative reinforcement and abuse. As an animal rights activist, this movie made me think about these issues and all the different ways we use animals. If you see this movie, think about these issues as you watch and if you disagree with me and would like to discuss feel free to comment below. I know there will be many who will not like the movie but I give it my approval and enjoyed it and will watch it again when it is released to video. Oh, and the music used in the movie is also awesome.",1472169600,8,4050,4.351387054161163

I don't like to face harsh realities and have no self-awareness when it comes to bigger issues so this movie was not exactly a pleasant experience at any level. People were mean to the dog!

It is not Homeward Bound, it is not Lassie, it is not Shiloh. It's not a movie with one big over-riding statement to make about society. It makes many, many statements about the way we live with our eyes closed, trusting in assumptions, and conventions that have been taught without really being thought about. The film is shocking in that it dares to wake us up for a bit, asks us to start taking some things seriously and stop taking other so **** seriously. The film is hilarious. Absolutely, brilliantly, darkly hilarious. If you manage to wake up for a bit like Todd is asking you too, you will see the humor as well I think.

Fair warning, this is not a cute dog movie for the family, it's a pitch black comedy about human suffering, very much in keeping with the rest of Solondz' body of work. His movies are brilliant in the way they show so much suffering, and yet manage to make you laugh at the absurdity of it, all without making his characters into victims. This is not a ""nice"" movie and I expect it will sharply divide audiences, but if you know what you're getting into, it's one of Solondz's better films.

Also of interest to Solondz fans, one of the four segments in the film is essentially a sequel to his breakout movie Welcome to the Dollhouse. This basically retcons out the events of Palindromes and picks up with Dawn Wiener in 30s, as she bumps into Brandon for the first time since that movie.
