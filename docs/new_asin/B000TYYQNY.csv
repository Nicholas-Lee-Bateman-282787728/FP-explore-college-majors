One important thing to know, is that the entire video is less than 7 minutes long!!  Obviously, that means that it is just an overview.  Amazon did not say how long the program was when I purchased it a few years ago, now I see why.  Since I am a Geography teacher, I really wanted someting visual to show when we study Niger, this does a good job of showing some wildlife scenes, and brief glimpses of the Tenere Desert and the Air Mountains.
  It does leave you wanting more, and so maybe you will be more inclined to see if you can find something more useful on YouTube.  But what content it does provide, I feel it does a decent job, the majority of the DVD discusses the town of Agadez, giving some outside shots of the Grand Mosque there.  I'm not sure why they would make such a short program, when there are so many other things of interest that they could have gone into.
  The program is a voice over narration of NIger, with no interviews of people in country and not even a brief background of Niger's history.  The capital of Niamey is briefly shown and mentioned.  You can select to hear the program in either French or English.  I would love something better than this, but it is not terrible for what it is.",1394064000,,1355,4.262745098039216
