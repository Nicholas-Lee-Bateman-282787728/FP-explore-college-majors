8398014,5,B003JD6XHO,"Great stuff..! All the usual suspects are here: Basie, Hampton, Calloway, etc and the whole mess is hosted by the amiable Willie Bryant. This all-black variety show was obviously filmed in a TV studio with audience reaction inserts filmed at some other theatre. (I wonder what show these guys were REALLY watching). Count Basie and Cab Calloway have small bands.. 5 or 6 members each and Nat King Cole sings a calypso number accompanied solely by a conga drum... it's all grand stuff. ""Rhythm'n'Blues Revue"" is the better quality print here and it runs for 71 minutes. ""Basin Street Revue"" is a little blurry and too dark in places. It is only 41 minutes long as most of the comedy has been edited. The poster art on the front of the box would have us believe that the movie is in ""Kaleidoscopic WonderColor"" (whatever that was) but rest assured that the print you get here is black & white. Grapevine Video also give us some bonus extras in the form of 8 short musical numbers featuring jazz bands and strippers. Yep, scantily clad sepia honeys dancing just for you. ""The Pearl Harbor Hula"", anyone? Of course none of these films have been restored but hey, we're lucky they still exist in any form. Oh, and be warned.. it's a DVD-R.",1426118400,,1234,4.613636363636363
