8586056,5,B000OPPA06,"Johnny Legend put this out years ago on the Rhino label, and this is a re-issue with a lot of cool extras thrown on top. More then your money's worth in fact. You get a solid hour of commericals from the 50's/60's/70's...a lot of them pretty crazy to look at now. (Laxatives for the kids, ladies with headaches responding to interior voices, the announcer-as-God telling the housewife what to do.) There are also some commercials that celebrate beauty and what we have lost over the years: (the classic Chevy. An Air Force commercial that looks like it was made by Milton Caniff...) You could get away with a lot more, back then too...(smoking commercials..Yvonne Craig dressed in yummy spandex.) You won't be bored. The extras I'm not going to ruin for you. The other feature here is T.V. Mania...a special featuring a lot of dead-on-arrival shows from the 50's that barely made it off the development stage. Wow.",1397779200,,914,4.791139240506329
