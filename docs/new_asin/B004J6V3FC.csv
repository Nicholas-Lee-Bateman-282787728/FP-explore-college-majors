8431769,5,B004J6V3FC,I liked the interaction between the three guys and learned some valuable tips on the weapons use. I wish there were more episodes!,1377302400,,130,4.695652173913044
8431770,3,B004J6V3FC,"What bugged me about this DVD was that it was advertised as ""New"" - - - and they got me.  So I'm mad.  I already had this; the ad led me to believe this was a different season.  So that's why the 3 stars, to be honest.  If you've seen Season One, Season Two is actually better.  The series on Kimbers is very informative.  Yes, they push products, but the reviews are a bit more honest, pointing out shortcomings in some items.  In the past those kinds of critical comments were verboten.  The ""Police Tips"" segments are excellent and some of the shooting competition is very entertaining - - - especially since it shows that even the best shooters have off days.  And you get to see a lot of different firearms in action and up close.  In that regard, it's a 5 star production.",1357862400,,778,4.303448275862069
