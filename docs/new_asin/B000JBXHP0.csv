8149990,4,B000JBXHP0,I used to watch this series on Sunday morning long ago on A&E.  It was so utterly relaxing and fascinating to watch!  It takes you away to a time and place long ago......You cant help but feel happy and relaxed after viewing one of this series.  This particular one on the Grand Plantations was especially interesting to me since I have visited many of the places mentioned in the show and cant wait to see the others.  You won't be disappointed in any of these shows....you'll be carried away instead!,1428883200,,502,4.544444444444444

8149993,5,B000JBXHP0,"""Grand Plantations"" is an episode of the series ""Americas Castles,"" featuring homes along the Mississippi River.  The series uses historical footage to highlight properties built for wealthy industrialists, bankers and plantation owners. The homes are oppulent and ostentatious, a true showplace to display their fortunes before taxes made them unmanageable to operate.  In the case of many of the plantation homes, they became vacant after the Civil War decimated the caste system that took away their free labor pool.

Featuring some notable and breathtaking homes both public and private such as ""Bon Sejour"" (which is nicknamed Oak Alley Plantation due to an alley of 300 year old oak trees planted long before the home), my favorite is Longwood, an octagonal mansion featuring a Byzantine onion dome that is breathtaking on the outside and completely unfinished (except for the basement where the family lived during construction) on the inside. Construction started in 1859 and halted with the outbreak of the Civil War, the family's loss of fortune, and the loss of the patriarch. It is eerie and yet an intriguing glimpse of what might have been.

I love the America's Castles series - and wish that A&E would continue to produce quality programming like this instead of the many tacky reality series that now make up their programming like Family Jewels, Billy the Exterminator, and Storage Wars.",1296518400,15,1405,5.20353982300885
