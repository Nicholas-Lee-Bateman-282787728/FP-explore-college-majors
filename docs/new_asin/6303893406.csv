7854145,5,6303893406,"I'm a big fan of the Eyewitness series. Where else can you find such a great blend of history, science, and myth? This series is sure to delight youngsters and adults with a particular interest in science and horses. Let me first say, that Eyewitness Horse has some of the most beautiful cinematography in the series. The scenes of the beautiful wild horses, and the interesting insight into the origination of mules and other crossbreeds were well presented. I thought the lipizanner horses were beautiful, and the commentary about horse 'speech' was quite well thought out.
Overall, and excellent video. Fans of this film, should check out Eyewitness: Plant, and Eyewitness: Bird. Both were fascinating!",1059955200,3,705,5.139130434782609
