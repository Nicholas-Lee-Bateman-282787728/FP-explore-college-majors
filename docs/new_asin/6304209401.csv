812465,5,6304209401,"The omnipotent Q and Captain Picard's former (?) lover Vash take a trip to DS9.  Q is as good as he always is and Vash is sarcastic and brash -- a  good foil to Q's sassiness and irreverence.  They had been partners as Q  helped Vash search the galaxy for valuable artifacts and such.  But, as  Picard and crew already know, Q can be annoying and Vash quickly tired of  him and his antics.  So, to make this synopsis succinct, Vash is trying to  rid herself of Q and Q is trying to woo Vash.  And the crew of DS9 are the  victims in this intergalactic spat.
Good episode and Q even lends a hand  in saving the station from a mysterious threat (gee, another one of those).  But what I want to know is this: Why didn't Q ever return to DS9?  I guess  Picard's Enterprise and Janeway's Voyager are more fun to visit.  Who  knew?
I'm giving this episode five stars even though I think it only  warrants four.  Why?  Because the other person who reviewed this episode  clearly meant to give ""Q-less"" more than one star (read it and  you'll see what I mean) so I'm giving my fellow reviewer a star.  Ain't I  nice?",962755200,2,1108,4.216346153846154
812555,5,6304209401,"My favorite star trek series ! No joy or fun in the last season though and I missed the odd characters of earlier seasons. This was like one of those huge novels you just can't put down.  It was the everybody got theirs season, pay back time. Felt like big budget cuts at the end. Those who weren't weren't sidelined, had personality makeovers. Better they ended on season 6  I think.",1498348800,,384,4.394366197183099
812556,5,6304209401,"I happened to finish binge-watching this season on Prime around Memorial Day and the last episode or two resonated particularly well.
""May we preserve in peace, what we've won in war.""

I also greatly enjoyed the episodes with the genetically enhanced people.
""That's a stupid question!""
""Malto Allegro"" (Replayed that singing scene several times.  It's around minute 17 of episode 5.)
""We have only 60.. 70 trillion years at most!""

The whole series was a fun romp actually, too many nice quotes and moments to list them out.  YouTube has a recording of the DS9 Theme song played by the City of Prague Philharmonic that's worth looping sometimes as well.  The reason the singing scene I mentioned above was particularly memorable was it stirred memories of various times I've been to the Kennedy Center for one performance or another, and these people were that freaking good.  As with STNG, DS9 did a great job connecting back to our own lives and culture at various points via time travel, dreams, visions, or people just living their lives.

 Very well done.",1496102400,2,1062,4.893854748603352

812969,5,6304209401,"Definitely the most tear-jerking ending to the Star Trek franchises of the bunch, something that Voyager and Enterprise unfortunately completely missed by forcing a quick ending. This season was the absolute best of the entire series and I loved the whole series to begin with. Truth be told, I might be a little biased in that sense: Next Generation was great and I loved it after being a childhood fan of the Original Series and the Animated Series, Voyager and Enterprise were good as far as they went, but Deep Space Nine has a special place in my Star Trek heart for being a complete story full of vibrant and ""real"" characters with ""real"" problems, and I had very much wished Paramount to come up with a DS9 movie series as well. Thanks, Amazon Prime, for letting me see it all again.",1479254400,,790,4.570422535211268

813069,5,6304209401,"For years I would have said Voyager was the best Star Trek, but at the time I had only watched the original Star Trek and Next Gen.  I am no trekkie, I just like a good TV show and I like Si-Fi.  So I am definitely sure many others have more info and in depth opinions than I do.
I like DS9 for not being so closely interconnected with the Federation.  Not following the ship/captain/crew/new world formula gave new life to the Trek universe.  How do the federation rules impact the day to day lives of people who aren't part of a federation ship crew?  How will all these different people (some not subject to the Federation) get along?  It's not a new formula for a tv show, but it is new for the Star Trek universe.  Sometimes I forgot I was watching a Star trek series.
The only complaint I have is the rushed ending in season 7.  You could tell they were rushing to tie up lots of plot points.  I still like Voyager (probably because it is also farther away from Federation stiffness), but I will always remember DS9 characters.  And I will re-watch the show over and over.",1479168000,,1078,4.292079207920792

813076,5,6304209401,"The final season of ST:DS9 features some interesting episodes.  It was different not having Jadzia there with Terry Farrell's departure.  But Nicole de Boer's portrayal of Ezri Dax is pretty good.  There have been character changes in nearly every other Star Trek series, and this one was no different.  The best part of the final season, to me, is the character of Vic Fontaine, played by James Darren.  He shows up in a few memorable shows and really helps to lighten the heavy Dominion storyline. When the series originally aired back in the late 1990s, I didn't really take the time to watch each and every episode, so some of these seem new to me.  The writing was very good and the shows are suspenseful, thought provoking and funny.  Overall, the last season is one of the best and one that anyone would enjoy, especially if you are a Star Trek fan.",1477008000,2,856,4.592105263157895

813437,5,6304209401,"I'm the 556th person to make a review of this remarkable series. While the finale was not as fantastic as that of Star Trek: The Next Generation, I enjoyed this final season of the series. Everything was wrapped up succinctly and the culmination of the Dominion War put an end to the long running saga about the Dominion and the Federation.

I did have some other questions and assumptions. The Cardassian Union was completely destroyed and as a result of this they would no doubt have been occupied? In my opinion the Federation would have been well within their rights to usurp and annex all of the colonies in the DMZ that had been given back to the Cardassians in that horrible treaty that created the Maquis. This would only have been fair as it would have allowed those colonists to return to  their former homes. I never agreed with the Federation for doing what they did. But this is just speculation.

I now own Star Trek: The Next Generation on DVD. Believe it or not there are about two dozen episodes of the series I've either seen only once (Because I Missed Being Able To Tape Them At The Time The Show Was Broadcast) or I never saw them to begin with (Completely Missed Them) thus it will be a delight to go back and pick and choose those specific episodes I never saw. I now need to purchase Star Trek: Voyager on DVD. There are many episodes from that show that I never saw. I saw only six or seven episodes from Star Trek: Enterprise. That's a show I'm really looking forward to seeing.

I give this DVD set a Five Star rating. It was more than a worthy successor to Star Trek: The Next Generation.",1470182400,,1616,4.412751677852349

Yes, there are some strange things happening to Gul Dukat, and not everybody likes the direction his character was taken in.

Others like STNG sure have their blow-out moments but you can't beat DS9 for consistently imaginative stories many of which are just as relevant today as they were 15 years ago, first rate acting from a cast drawn largely from the stage, and beautiful camera and lighting work.  It is a rare jewel in the sea of drama.  It's on Amazon Prime streaming so take a look.  A nodding acquaintance with STNG would be helpful but not required.",1447718400,,585,4.596153846153846

But I still give it 5 stars. This is a really satisfying final season to an amazing series. Like the series as a whole, it is pure Star Trek at its finest. I really don't know anymore whether I like TNG or DS9 better. The political complexity and storyline continuity of DS9 make it uniquely compelling. I might just start all over from the beginning and watch the whole thing again.

that this was a terrific series. I wonder if it doesn't seem to be as popular as some others is because you really had to follow it.

Season 7 brings the Deep Space 9 saga to a close. And it does so masterfully. It wraps up all the open story lines in a way that leaves you feeling satisfied. Plus it takes a couple detours along the way just for fun, like the baseball episode where the DS9 crew takes the field against the Vulcan team.

As for the storytelling DS9 is probably the best overall story arc in the Trek franchise. While there are a lot of single episode stories, there is an overall story arc that spans the entire series. It's interesting. It's well written. Well made. And it's just good sci-fi and story telling in general. The series long story arc takes a lot of twists and turns but it deals with inter stellar politics and power struggles that the other Trek series only elude to. (Yeah, Captain Picard has a fair amount of diplomatic and military run ins with the Romulans and Klingons, but on Deep Space Nine the series delves much deeper into the politics or all that, and introduces a few new races from the other side of the galaxy into the mix)

If you like the Star Trek franchise, you have to try Deep Space Nine.",1430784000,,1113,4.378640776699029

815621,4,6304209401,"There have been very few TV shows of any kind that have ever been willing to explore complexity and darkness in characters and storylines the way that DS did. (And those few that do have all appeared very recently, long after DS9 was there to learn and even copy from.) It's as if the writers never had an obligation to artificially insert a happy ending when the characters and plotlines didn't warrant it. I've very rarely seen episodic TV that was able to overcome the near-impossible challenge of how to sustain tension surrounding recurring characters when we KNEW that they couldn't be killed off. But they did it here. There were so many cases in DS9 where we saw that yes, characters would literally survive, but the tension was in knowing that they might be hurt, damaged, wounded, and changed. This was a challenge that no other Star Trek franchise version was ever really able to pull off. And this was, above all, a constant and ongoing exploration of what happens *after* trauma and devastation. How do people survive? What prices do they pay for their survival? That actually was the entire key to Ben Sisko's character, for example. There are so few TV series that have ever even really tried to tackle questions like this, and again, the few that have are all extremely recent (Orphan Black, for example.)

All of that having been said, I wasn't a huge fan of the way that Season 7 was wrapped up. It didn't feel incomplete as much as it felt like an arc abruptly cut short. Did there need to be an entire eighth season? Well, because there was obviously no way to continue the 7th one for five or six more episodes, which would have been ideal, IMHO-- and because there was never a possibility of a DS9 movie at that time-- I would say yes. It felt like the resolution of too many plotlines had simply been omitted, scrapped for lack of time.

(spoilers, if you haven't already seen this, I guess...)
What happened to the fascinating plotline involving Kira's Cardassian lookalike? It was hinted that we might learn more about her, but we never did. Why wasn't the main alternate universe resolved in any way? That was completely left hanging. Kira's decision to just let go of Odo wasn't realistic for the stubbornness of her character; it needed a longer plot arc to feel resolved. Why didn't we get it? What was Jake going to end up doing? He seemed to be basically hanging around the space station by the end. Why did the Prophets plotline and theme get so shortchanged by the end, cut off so suddenly?

And MOST of all, HOW could there not have been any kind of resolution for the Benny Russell-verse? It was really a stunner that this plotline was just dropped. We saw it not once, but twice, and it clearly was important to the underlying theme of DS9. And then... nothing.

I don't know. I haven't read the Millenium series yet, and I think I will, but even if some of these questions feel more ""answered"" in some way through reading it, that doesn't change the fact that an awful lot was left hanging in the actual wrapup of the series. But in some ways, that's maybe the biggest compliment that can be given for DS9. It was so groundbreaking, so revolutionary, that a less-than-perfect ending felt like it fell short much more than it actually did. For any other show, the ending would have been wonderful, but the bar had been raised too high. I still think that they might have been better off with a Season 8; even if there ended up feeling that it was dragging on a little too long (and that might not have happened anyway,) it would have been better than feeling cut off too abruptly. Still... this is one of the best shows that's ever been on TV. So watch it again!!! :)",1425254400,3,3703,4.530642750373692

Throughout the entire last season one could sense the loss and that something was missing, even though I thoroughly enjoyed the addition of Nicole De Boer as Ezri Dax. I think if the series had continued for at least another year, the sense of loss would have alleviated itself as De Boer continued her work developing the Character Ezri Dax. Of the three major spin-offs of the original Star Trek Series, (TNG, DS9, Voyager), I think DS9 was the best because of the in-depth character development and the long list of supporting characters introduced throughout the series. I would have liked for the series to have continued for another 7 years because so much of the story has never been explored.

Well thought out writing with great story arcs, involving ALL of the 6 or 7 major characters. what a great story, it had an fantastic ending, but left the door open on several levels ( simply fantastic! ) for the story to begin again. No namby pamby ending, folks died, lovers parted, all of the bad guys were not that bad, and the good guys weren't that good. Very Very engaging story, well told. I waited a few years and then did a marathon watch of DS9 and just loved it. some of the shows were silly, some had little to do with the main story arc, but they always got back to the real deal.

This was not ""lost"" ( hated it, because they could have done it right, but chose NOT to, terrible story! ), or ""helix"" ( same as lost, stop it now PLEASE!, just awful story telling ). This was Deep Space Nine, they had a GREAT story to tell and they told it well..and then they stopped. Its amazing they were allowed to do this the right way. It stands the test of time, a true sci-fi classic. I will wait a few years....and then i will watch it again. Just like a good book, it becomes part of the library forever.

Sure it's different from TOS and Next Generation, but it dealt with themes those seriesccouldn't, not with the ships and crews being on journeys of exploration. DS9 let us see Trek characters reacting to life in one place, deal with political threats, territorial grabs, nation rebuilding, and of course war. Before this we never really saw war portrayed in the Federation. DS9 gave us insurgency (the Maquis) and then flat out war with an intractable opponent in the Dominion. Yes, darker than its predecessors, but we got more character development and relationship building. Deep Space Nine was a different Star Trek.

The plot moves along much more quickly and there are fewer episodes devoted to exploring character quirks and developing personalities. Instead, the show takes on all of its many threads--including the Dominion war, the Changeling illness, the Dax relationships, Ferengi matters, the Emissary, the pah-wraiths, and quite a few more--and wraps nearly all of them up in a reasonably tight, plausible manner.

It would be clear to even a benighted drunken imbecile (average FOX News viewers) that season 7 is no more than a poorly sloped together hodgepodge of rightfully rejected scripts from the first six seasons. What is wrong with Americans today? As soon as most of them hear that it is time to move on to a new project they stop trying, indeed they start to sabotage their work.  It was done in the last season of the original S T; It was done in the last season of Next Generation; It was NOT done in the last season of Enterprise, which had a better last season. I'm not saying that every episode of DSN season seven was a kick in Odos viscous Himalayas... two or three episodes could be considered passable. I have today start watching ST Voyager, it has started well I hope it ends more professionally than did the Original ST, ST the Next Generation, and ST Deep Space Nine.

The story arch is engaging, the acting is above average for TV Sci Fi and every now and then, there's some very good tongue in cheek.
BUT - this is a dvd set that was made quite some time ago.  The interface is clunky in the extreme, the extras are minimal.  The annoying interface of the dvd's is all that stopped me giving this a 5 star rating - but you can't watch all episodes on a disc at a click, you can't skip the end credits of an episode etc - very old, old school.

All the talk abouut the ""WAR"" and very little action seuences. I was truly disappointed. If your going to write a story about a big war, make it about the war, not the continuos, obnoxious Dick Fontaine crap. It dishonors the Star Trek legacy. I had alot of trouble believing most of the characters and the same lines were used over and over again. The writers of this series need a course on writing.

Hertzler (Martok) and John Colicos (Kor) who also played one of the original Klingons in the first Star Trek series.

The war with the Dominion drags on throughout the season as a theme, but the resolution of the conflict seemed too abrupt for me. The seasons after the first and before the Dominion war started were the most enjoyable. I kept hoping the writers would abandon the strong overtones of Bajoran religion in this series. But it played a role in the story right until the final episode culminating in a silly and impotent way. I guess the lesson of the whole season is that mixing religion with politics is a terrible idea. A better idea is to treat your gods as reasonable beings and reason things out. Who knows, it might just save the Alpha Quadrant.",1394064000,,805,4.482993197278912

Judging between seasons 6 and 7 as the best is a tough task, so let me say, both seasons are worth watching.  The characters grew into their roles and all of the loose ends were tied up.  This show is really a good example of how to grow characters over time and have it all make sense.

816796,3,6304209401,"Simply put, this is my least favorite Star Trek series.  The main problem with it was the lack of a consistent storyline.

Seasons 1 through 5 were full of lackluster to average episodes.  It was only until the finale of Season 5 that the series first started to pick up with the beginning of the Dominion War.  Then into the beginning of season 6, you have a few more episodes that pick up after the season 5 cliffhanger, but then it goes back downhill.

All throughout season 6 and half of season 7, you have these AWFUL episodes, and I mean AWFUL.  Do you think I really care about that stupid Vic Fontaine garbage, or those ludicrous Ferengi episodes?  Most of this series consists of filler garbage like that.  You would get like one pretty decent episode pertaining to the Dominion War, and then an episode (""eppy"") bomb gets dropped.  The last 10 episodes of season 7 were pretty good, but I don't like how they abruptly ended the Dominion War.

One really well done plotline was the disease that affected the Changelings.  It's clear that the writers wanted to model the disease after HIV.  If you didn't notice the parallels to HIV, watch ""When It Rains"" again and you'll see.  I bet you that HIV exists due to a similar situation.

In summary, Star Trek DS9 is the worst in the bunch.  I haven't seen Voyager yet, but from what I've been hearing, it's really good.  I watched the first season of Enterprise so far, and I already like that season more than the entire DS9 series.

In my opinion, the best Star Trek series is TNG, then TOS, with DS9 in last place.",1377475200,,1572,4.459649122807018

Basically the first 20 episodes are fine TV viewing, but coming on the heals of the most excellent Season 6 and that awesome cliffhanger, there is just too long of a pause until we really feel the show get back to the intensity that propelled for so many years. It's not bad at all and is better than most every other Sci Fi show made in the past 30 years, just in comparison to what comes before it, it just feels a bit flat.

Major pluses:
The final 4 episodes, srsly great TV.
Louise Fletcher owning Kai Winn.
Jeffrey Combs chewing the scenery as Weyoun.
The evolution (finally) of Kira.

Major minuses:
Nicole de Boer as Ezri Dax - nice idea for a novice to take over the Dax entity, bad execution.
Bashier reduced to a mooning schoolboy and O'Brien devolving into a sidekick.
Sisco going sorta nuts the first 1/4 of the season and then his final scene (P.U.).

816965,3,6304209401,"For whatever reason an inappropriate lightheartedness and sense of humor is plopped in the show.

Perhaps the writers wanted to avoid the show being too serious and/or perhaps they were trying to have the same success the original 60s series had doing the same thing, but whatever the reason they failed.

The goofy, giggly ""character building"" moments are almost always jarring and foisted into scenes where individuals would likely not be in a mood to laugh or make lighthearted banter say when characters are facing eminent death or destruction, or after suffering serious, incredibly painful injuries upon being saved their first instinct is to crack a joke.

The reason this is such a problem is the whole thing is unbelievable. For a viewer to enjoy it at face value, the willful suspension of disbelief must not be disrupted

Unfortunately one of the most disruptive factors to that is inappropriate and/or abrupt changes of mood or feeling.

The show producers in their poor handling of this conflict demonstrated so little respect for the genre that they defeated various writers very good story telling.

For me the result was always the same I lost the ability to get lost in the episode. Instead of focusing on the story, I was forced to confront the utter stupidity of the turn of events.

If the show's writers and producers had been more careful and put a higher bar between such things the show would have rated 5 stars.

On the up side, when I first watched the shows in the previous millennium LOL, Avery Brooks take on his character has improved most with the passage of time along with Kira and Odo.

817038,5,6304209401,"As much as I loved The Original Series and many moments in The Next Generation - Deep Space Nine was written by the best trek Writers and walked away with the best young producers and show techs. Ron D Moore, the showrunner, understood you cannot break the bank on every episode- So he paced it out, peppering the story with great single episodes like ""Duet"" in Season 1 and ""Waltz"" in season 6. But season seven broke all molds of Trek - And of the Single-Episode ""Cosmic Monster of the Week"" episodes of The Original Series and of the first 3 seasons of TNG.

In season seven, they came up with a ten, no, maybe eleven-episode closing story arc, so that the last 11 or so episodes of this final season MUST be watched all at once.

It was an incredible story, and when you consider that most of these Klingon Opera Space Battles were filmed PRACTICALLY - It is beyond amazing.  I had heard that the only digital model was The Defiant, but I am not so sure of that after watching season 7. It wasn't just The Dominion War, it was also the New ""Dax"" and her family, O'Brien's attempts at being a real secret agent, Dukat's encounters with the Koss't Amogan and becoming the Anti-Emissary - And finally, the Mirror Universe Terrans winning THEIR war against the Klingon-Cardassian Alliance (Of which the Emperor is ironically WORF).

It is a beautiful and epic story - NOT a continuation of Star Trek: The Next Generation. It was to show that while Earth had become Gene Roddenberry's ideal society, the rest of the Universe has not caught up to Terra. If I have anything to say it would be to Hikaru Sulu aka George Takei, who did not like DS9 so much because it did not follow that original series Organian Peace Treaty story - And even George had been ordered to attach the original Enterprise (I do not count ""Enterprise"" because that show did NOT follow established canon) to a huge fleet of Starships above the Planet Organia before they were stopped galaxy-wide. So, even in The Original Series, there must have been huge space battles, one of them referred to in the TOS 'Sode ""Balance of terror"".

I loved DS9 because we got to see how that would LOOK like - It is not pretty, all those beautiful ships being blown to bits and their crews being ""waporized"". But we just had to SEE it and we GOT to see it in Deep Space Nine.

Season Seven begins with ""Benny Russel"" - ""The Sisko"" must complete his task - He learns that ONLY He could have ever been the Emissary to Bajor, because his Mother was one of The Prophets. This was a kick in the pants and top-notch writing: The only way it can be related to us is in the form of ""Far Beyond The Stars"" aka Benny Russel, who, in an alternate reality, wrote Deep Space Nine in the 50's and it was never published. And so we get to see here, as ""Damar"" the leader of Cardassia, appears as a doctor, trying to prevent Benny from writing - And it is a false Vision from the Pah-Wraiths.

And that is basically what this all represents, an age old struggle between Evil and Good, and ""Evil usually Wins - Unless Good is Very, Very Careful"" - Dr. McCoy, ""The Omega Glory""

The Dominion story arc is great, and every episode related to it is equally great. The loss of Jadzia Dax is sad, although I came to like Ezri in the end. Jadzia was one of the best characters in the series, and no matter what beef Paramount had with Terry Farrel, she should have been in the flashbacks in the last episode. That she wasn't, in particular in Worf's flashbacks, ruined that episode for me. It was just petty.

The whole Bajoran religion Sisko is the savior thing was totally unneeded and distracted from the more interesting storyline. Also, the end reminded me of Sheridan going into the light in Babylon 5. There were a couple of stories similar to Babylon 5 that are probably lack of imagination of the writers, or some weird competition going on. All of them were unnecessary and distracting.

There were some great supporting characters, in particular Damar, Garak, Weyoun, and Nog. I did not care for Vic either way. The Dukat/Winn story could have been much shorter.

It felt like many stories were not really resolved, or ended in an unsatisfactory way. Sisko leaving his wife and kids behind? Odo leaving to help the founders? Where was the sense in that? I would have wished both of them a better ending.

817271,4,6304209401,"Season Seven gets five stars for one of the best and most complete endings in science fiction history - but 3 stars for its episodic quality throughout the final season - which averages my Amazon rating to 4 stars.

All of the Dominion war arc episodes and the finale are fantastic - few Sci-fi shows get to end with dignity and grace. DS9 finishes the race without years of space and a fan based letter writing campaign in between. It is a complete story in and of itself within its seven year run and that alone makes the show a diamond in the rough.
Out of the story arc, episodically this season was a real downer however.

 ***@!Spoiler Alerts!@***

 The death of Jadzia in Season six devastated the show and left the show hobbling toward the finish line. While she was certainly drop dead gorgeous, she was so much more than just another pretty face. She was an extremely competent actor who crafted a vivacious and irreplaceable character for 6 years. Her death in every way detracted from the final season of the show. Though it fits in with her character's alien story line, replacing her with the character of Ezri was an absolute mistake. Perhaps this would have worked had the show many more seasons to go, but with one season left - half of the last season is left to flesh out the addition of Ezri and more often than not it feels forced and just falls flat.

The weird sub story of Sisko's mother being a Prophet was also unfortunate in my opinion. It was an entirely unnecessary. It was a dramatic indulgence and weakness on the part of the writers - ""Sisko... I am your mother!"" Puh-leeeze. The show was amazing for 6 years and in its final season it really begins to run out of steam and no longer dares to be so creatively original. Many of the non-arc episodes are as awkward and stilted as those from the first and second season.

They simply pale in comparison to the Dominion war episodes. These are stellar and redeem the season. The transformation, redemption and martyrdom of Dumar was a brilliant move and that it is successfully executed is a testament to the writing and acting involved. This story is followed up in an amazingly well crafted story by the actor Andrew Robinson, who played as Garak in his DS9 novel:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Stitch-in-Time-Star-Trek-Deep-Space-Nine-27/dp/0671038850/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Stitch in Time (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine #27)</a>. Dukat and Adami are soul-mates from hell and the tte--tte between actor and actress is richly crafted and for the connoisseur, it is a real treat.

If you've made it this far, well of course you'll keep going and want to see it through to the end, but when it's not working - just shrug your shoulders and move on to the next episode.

817272,4,6304209401,"First thing first: I LOVED the first hour of this finale. That made the last part of the ending so much more disappointing for me :( *SPOILER* The ""religious"" mystical disappearance of Sisko was predictable, but felt so unnecessary. I was never a fan of the Odo-Kira relationship (like watching a daughter and Father make-out...*gag*) and that happens to be the focus of the very end. And the flashback section was sloppy and lacking. Where was Worf and Jadzia (heck where was just Jadzia?! WTF?!) in those? And the Vic scene went on about 2 minutes too long zzZZZzzzzZzz

All that aside I loved this series.  There were some amazing characters on the DS9 crew. I think Garuk may be one of my favorite characters in all of TV history. And I'm so glad Worf became such a fixture in this series; M. Dorn is a damn legend, what an amazing actor. Gul Dukat had an interesting complex villainous role (though I do feel his ending was a bit corny and underwhelming). It's funny because Sisko never really stood out for me, that's so weird since he was the main protagonist....In fact Quark, Rom, and Nog seem more memorable and Kira was a much more compelling layered person. There were so many episodes that made me get misty eyed, made me LOL, and got my adrenaline pumping. I'm glad I got to see it all the way through. I was only 5 when this series came out and now I'm 24 getting to watch it for the first time (and probably not the last) :D",1340409600,2,1440,4.430188679245283

817344,4,6304209401,"I won't be reviewing many of these last episodes because they all seem to be of top quality (4 and 5 stars), but I'll speak about a problem that I'd hope I would have gotten over by now. I still don't understand the Kira-Odo relationship...There is nothing there and I still don't understand why the writers felt it so important to follow through with that? It feels like a ploy to make him seem more human-like and giving us a reason to relate to him. To me it is creepy, he has a fatherly vibe about him and Bashir and O'Brien seem to have more chemistry. I'm pretty sure they don't have sex (Odo was a solid but now isn't), he makes fun of the prophets, and they can never have children.

It's NONSENSE. Some people will say ""Oh but love doesn't always make sense"", but in this case it makes as much sense as a spider falling in love with a rattle snake...definitely took away from DS9 for me.

A lot of people who don't cherish ST or think it's just a sci fi show don't realize how talented it's cast has to be to make it seem so believable. They have to exist in an imaginary world, with extraordinary beings and phenomena....and still make it feel authentic.

  Every season has it's bad apples that pull you out of that experience (Wesley - TNG and Jake - DS9) but for the most part those are the exception. Nog hits it out of the park here, and at the conclusion his monologue made me lose it. You could feel his pain, how hard he was trying to bury it, so much anger with nowhere to channel it.",1340323200,,714,4.274074074074074
817349,5,6304209401,"I would like for first talk about the new addition: Ezra Dax. She is cute. She is a babe. She is hot. I'M IN LOVE. But it isn't going to happen. She came about because Jadzia Dax was attacked and killed (Last episode of Season Six) but the Dax symbiont was saved. While enroute to Trill the Dax symbiont became gravely ill. It needed a host right away and Ezra was the only Trill around. So she would join with the Dax symbiont. Since Ezra underwent no training or preparation the joining was overwhelming. So she request an assignment on Deep Space Nine in hopes that Captain Sisko can provide guidance and assistance. Now she has all the memories of the previous hosts and this initially causes problems with relations with other DS9 members-especially Lt Commander Worf. In time she does adjust and becomes a productive and accepted member of Deep Space Nine. She was a great and welcome addition to the series.

Now much of this season focused on the war with the Dominion but it did not celebrate the war. As one who served in the military I can state that war is an ugly but sometimes necessary business. I will focus on the episodes that I think best show the ugly side of war.

* The Siege of AR-558: Starfleet troops seize a major communications relay and of the 150 troops involved in that action, 43 are still alive. We do see the psycological effects that came from that action. DS9 personnel are sent to provide supplies and assistance. While there a fight between Starfleet troops and Jem'Hadar troops takes place. It is here that Ezra Dax sees a person she befriended get killed and Nog will lose his leg. In the end these troops are replaced with fresh troops but the troops leaving will have physical and psychological scars that will be with them for a while and for some a lifetime.

* It's Only A Paper Moon: Here we see how war changes people-often for the worse. Nog returns to DS9 with a biosynthetic replacement for his lost leg. He is struggling with PTSD. Nog pretty much withdraws from everything and everybody and gets hostile when friends and other DS9 personnel try to reach out to him. After an argument with his roommate Jake Nog goes to the holosuite and stays with Vic Fontaine. Nog starts to get involved in Vic's world which of course is not reality. At first Nog's superiors allow it thinking it might help with his recovery, but Nog gets too involved in Vic's world. Vic sees this and tells Nog he needs to go back to the real world. Nog refuses so Vic shuts down his program. Nog tries to restart the program but can't because Vic is a different type of program. Later there is an emotional scene of a group hug involving Nog, Rom, Quark, and Leeta (Nog's step mom). At this point Nog starts the recovery process and will make a full recovery.

* What You Leave Behind: The final episode of the series. Here we see an awful burden of command. That being having to decide who lives and who dies. Admiral Ross, Captain Sisko, Chancellor (formally General) Martok, and the Romulan commander who make up thr Federation/Klingon/Romulan alliance see and opportunity to bring the war to an end. They know that casualities will be high but the decision is made to attack. During the attack ships are blown out of the sky and an advanced civilization-the planet Cardassia- is left in ruins. This attack does bring the war to an end but at a high price. In the end the casualty count is 800 million and hunderds if not thousands ships lost. Also the planet Cardassia is in ruins and there is much carnage. Earlier in the series General Martok states that Admiral Ross, Captian Sisko, and himself would celebrate the wars end by drinking blood wine in the halls of Cardassia. Seeing the destruction and carnage around them Admiral Ross and Captain Sisko could not partake of that celebration.

The series would end with some DS9 crewmembers leaving. Chief O'Brien leaves for Starfleet Academy, Lt Commander Worf becomes a Federation ambassador to Qo'noS, Odo embarks to the Founders world to join the Link, and Captain Sisko is in the Celestial Temple of the prophets. The final scene is Colonel Kira Nerys and Jake Sisko are seen looking out into space.

It is hard to see a great series come to an end but I suspose no television series can go on indefinitely. I enjoyed watching the show while it was in syndication and I enjoyed watching it again on DVD. I did want to point out how this season and earlier seasons show the ugly side of war and I hope I did do that. Also Amazon did it's usual good job of getting my DVDs to me in a timely manner. I used the free Super Saver shipping and the items got to me quickly. That is the only shipping I use. Again good job anf thanks.",1340323200,,4709,4.508196721311475
817350,5,6304209401,"I remember in the first couple of seasons being disgusted by Nog's selfishness, immaturity and lack of respect for anything. It's a credit to the writers of DS9 that now he has become one of my favorite characters on the show (up there with Worf and Garuk). He has shown more heart, courage, and valor than most of the veteran crew and in this episode he is a shining example of what it means to be Star fleet officer (not only in actions but in attitude). You'd be a fool not to watch this one, it's everything you could hope for in a ST episode. Great action and great acting.",1340323200,,578,4.263636363636364

So many memorable moments and quotes from this one, by far my favorite ""side-story"" episode. But taking a step back and thinking about how the war is still going on....it's hard to believe they have the luxury of dedicating SOOOO much time to recreation.",1340236800,,588,4.288288288288288
817352,5,6304209401,"I am really digging this character Ezri-Dax and am anticipating enjoying watching her journey as a joined trill. I must admit I am very biased because I find the actress playing her very cute and like-able. But, this episode also deals with an unstable side of Garuk (a side we NEVER get to see) and also Worf is forced to confront how he feels about Jadzi ""living on"" through the new Dax. All in All a very interesting episode, but you must have some interest in the Ezri character to fully enjoy it.",1340236800,,501,4.397849462365591
817353,4,6304209401,"Oh Ezri-Dax those big blue eyes, that goofy confused personality. I didn't think I could like the next iteration of Dax as much as I liked Jadzia, but Ezri is giving her a run for her money. I love the set-up; how she wasn't prepared, but instead the symbiote was forced upon her in a way. I think it's going to be interesting watching her discover herself as well as how to be ready to be a full trill (retroactively)

  And Once again I agree with AbsolutelyNutts review (something that never used to happen), but there was some filler in this episode. I give it a 4/5 probably because I enjoyed the journey Sisko took to find the orb ( the ambiance reminded a bit of Tatooine in the first Star Wars) And we get to see Worf finally properly deal with the loss of Jadzia in way only a Klingon could.

817414,3,6304209401,"This is a weird episode. It's a stand-alone episode featuring Bashir. Personally I find it hard to sympathize with Bashir as a character- we don't really know that much about him and he's rather one-dimensional. His stand-alone episodes are mostly mediocre.

That being said, this is an ambitious episode! It tries to do a lot of things at once- romance, sci-fi technology, comedy and a running theme of ""lonely Bashir"" and the problems associated with letting our personal wishes interfere with the needs of another- AND ALSO about the dangers of disrupting the doctor-patient relationship as well.

Now does it all work? Eh. Not really. The mutants as a concept is cool but I was hoping more ""Brad Pitt in 12 Monkeys"" than what we actually got. They played it pretty safe in how they were portrayed. Lots of concepts get covered but there isn't enough time to flesh any of them out properly.

But overall it was okay, which is more than you can say for most stand-alone episodes, and for that it gets 3/5 stars.",1334534400,,1013,4.711864406779661
817415,4,6304209401,"This last season has some real clunker episodes but the last parts of the season focus back on the issues surrounding the war and its resolution.

817416,3,6304209401,"""What you leave behind"" left me hopeful and heart-broken.  Hopeful, because good triumphs over evil, compassion over intolerance, friendship over mistrust.  Heart-broken because so many good friends are leaving to go their separate ways.  ***SPOILER*** Sisko leaves his wife, son, and unborn child, but it's ok, because he needs ""training"" with the prophets, and can't even let his wife know when he will be coming back!?!? I don't think so. That is SO not ok. So, other than that major flaw (or poor moral judgement from a character known for moral judgement), the only issue I have with this episode is the montage/flashback, that completely glossed over Jadzia, during Worf's, Bashir's & even Quark's flashbacks.  It seemed like the selections were pretty hastily thrown together, except for perhaps O'Brien's flashback of him and Bashir, that was very tastefully done to cover their growing friendship.

So, in the end, I like all of the plot development (other than Sisko leaving his family), I especially liked what they did in this story arch illustrating the strong bond of friendship between Bashir and O'Brien.

Thank you Star Trek: Deep Space Nine for 7 wonderful seasons.  I grew up watching Star Trek: The Next Generation (my first love), and only watched the first season or so of DS9 when it first came out before growing up took it's precedence.

First, the introduction of Ezri Dax was an inspired idea. She's very different from Jadzia Dax (but has amazingly similar eyes) and I really enjoyed the episodes featuring her character. The season also really gets into the wear, especially the first few episodes and the last 10 episodes. Some of the space battles are still riveting, even 10 years later, because of good editorial direction in filming the battles. My favorite part of the season though is the story of Cardassia and what happens to the Cardassian people. That was simply an inspired twist.

817752,5,6304209401,"Bottom-Line: Overall, I enjoyed ""ST: DS9 ~The Complete Seventh Season"" more than the Sixth and that says a lot since I so thoroughly enjoyed Season six.

""ST: DS9 ~The Complete Seventh Season"" is entrenched in Gene Roddenberry's now multifaceted Star Trek universe.  The series was created by Rick Berman and Michael Piller and indeed they produced most if not all of the episodes.  Paramount Television owns the Star Trek franchise and released the series to DVD in 2003.

A spin-off of Star Trek: The Next Generation, ""ST: DS9 ~The Complete Seventh Season"" opens as the war with The Dominion continues with both sides taking heavy losses.  What the Dominion thought would be a short 2 month war has turned into a 2 year slugfest with no discernable end in sight.  At the end of Season Six, the Federation has long since regained control of the Cardassian space station Terok Nor (Federation name Deep Space 9) and has made inroads into Cardassian held space, but cannot advance even though The Romulan Empire has joined the Federation, and oh yes Lt. Commander Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell ~ Paper Dolls, Deep Core, Becker) is killed by none other than Gul Dukat (Marc Alaimo ~ Hill Street Blues, Star Trek: The Next Generation) who is now really working for the dark side.

As ""ST: DS9 ~The Complete Seventh Season"" kicks off as Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks ~ Spenser For Hire, A Man Called Hawk, American History X) and his son Jake Sisko (Cirroc Lofton ~ Soul Food, Invasion) have returned to earth as Benjamin not only try's to make sense of Jadzia's death, but to also determine how to reopen the wormhole.

Into Benjamin's life pops one Ensign Ezri Dax (Nicole de Boer ~ Deepwater Black, Dead Zone). Ezri Dax is now carrying the Dax symbiant inside of her, having been onboard the U.S.S. Destiny, the ship detailed to take the Symbian back to the Trill home world after Jadzia died.  Before the Dax Symbiant could be safely deposited on Trill however, it began to die, and Ezri, who had to accept symbiant despite receiving no training as a host.  So when she shows up on Earth, she is a very willful, but very confused young lady and it makes for a pretty interesting season.

Meanwhile, Major Kira (Nana Visitor ~ Dark Angel, Mini's First Time, Wildfire), and Odo (Rene Auberjonois ~ Benson, The Pirates of Dark Water, The Patriot), continue their romance, but Odo starts to have doubts about where he belongs, triggered by the appearance of another one of The 100.

Once Ezri Daz makes an appearance on DS9, she and Lt. Commander Worf (Michael Dorn ~ Star Trek The Next Generation, CHiPs, Heros) clash as Worf is unsure what to make of Ezri or how to act around her, and Ezri is conflicted about her feelings for Worf and Dr. Adrian Bashir (Alexander Siddig ~ Primeval, 24, Syriana).  This comes to a head in episode Penumbra wherein Worf is lost and Ezri sets out on her own to find him in the badlands.  The two are thrust together and forced to make sense of their relationship.  It is in the Episode that the Breen Confederacy enters the picture on the side of the Dominion.

Episode Arma Enim Silent Leges (modern translation: ""In times of war, the law falls silent."") has to be the seminal piece in a very engaging season, and is apropos of what transpired in the U.S. after September 11th.  In the Episode Dr. Bashir is called upon by the shadowy Section 13 to carry out an assignment that violates the Federation Charter on many levels...

My Thoughts

""ST: DS9 ~The Complete Seventh Season"" continues to build on the fine start of Season One insofar-as each story build on the other in some way shape or form.  And each episode is well written, well-acted, and this seventh and final season builds on the story-lines of the first six with intriguing and thought-provoking story-lines and characters.

Though there are light moments in ""ST: DS9 ~The Complete Seventh Season""; Take Me Out to the Holosuite and Badda-Bing Badda-Bang, most of the episodes explore dark material more than other Star Trek series, and in-so-doing explore contemporary issues in American society at the time, including the separation of Church and State, the role of religion in the classroom, genocide, racism, loyalty, bigotry, and terrorism and now all-out war with The Dominion.

Avery Brooks continues the evolution of Captain Benjamin Sisko in fine fashion.  His character, like so many before him called ""Captain"" in the Star Trek universe, is both strong, but also flawed, and essentially human.  But more importantly for me, he is Black, and never before on network program have we witnessed a strong black male character the caliber of Benjamin Sisko.

There is little separation between Star Trek: The Next Generation and ST: DS9; both series take place during the same time period, only ST: DS9 had a bit more dark spice to offer up.  All of the actors on the series now completely inhabit their characters and work well together as an ensemble.  The caliber of actors, both regulars, and guest stars, is outstanding make the series and engaging, emotional, and sometimes tough to watch.

""ST: DS9 ~The Complete Seventh Season"" with its 25 episode arc is science fiction television at its best, and it unfortunate that the series is not still alive and well today.  The special effects are top notch, the stories well written, and episodes well-acted, and the overall plotline well received.  Overall, I enjoyed ST: DS9 ~The Complete Seventh Season more than the Sixth and that says a lot since I so thoroughly enjoyed Season six.  And on balance, I have to say out of all the Star Trek series to date Deep Space Nine is my favorite.",1293926400,,5646,4.771839671120246
817753,4,6304209401,"After Star Trek TOS and the later seasons of Voyager I've always enjoyed DS9 over the other series (TNG and Enterprise) and despite the unavoidable comparisons with that other great sci fi series Babylon 5 I've always thought that DS9 was different enough from JMS' excellent storyline to avoid being an outright plagiarism.
One thing that DS9 had going for it that Babylon 5 didn't was production money and so unlike the Babylon 5 dvd series, this DS9 dvd series has better special effects, a better soundtrack and overall better picture quality as well. In contrast with the Babylon 5 series where I feel it could definitely benefit from a thorough picture restoration when they finally put it on blu-ray I found this DS9 season 7 dvd set upscales very well to 1080p when I played it on my upscalable blu-ray player. The picture quality is not blu-ray reference quality but is a vast improvement over the first four seasons and although there are some soft and grainy picture frames they were few and far between. The same holds true for the sound quality which is also pretty good unlike the Babylon 5 dvd series which I also hope will undergo intense restoration for the blu-ray release. For this reason, I am happy to stay with these standard dvds of DS9 that I already have rather than to ""upgrade"" to the blu-ray versions should they become available.

Season 7 is the next best Season with regards the consistency of good episodes to Seasons 3 & 6. I liked ""Image in the Sand"", ""Chrysalis"", ""Treachery, Faith, and the Great River"", ""Covenant"", ""It's Only a Paper Moon"", ""Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges"", ""When It Rains..."", and the series ending episode ""What You Leave Behind"" is very good too. Overall I believe this season 7 together with seasons 3 & 6 to be the best among the seven with only a few dud episodes to speak off such as the Ocean's Eleven rip-off ""Badda-Bing, Badda-Bang"" and the silly ""Take Me Out To the Holosuite"".

The plastic packaging is also very attractive and robust unlike the Babylon 5 one which I actually had to superglue back together again when the disc holder came apart from the cardboard spine. Overall, this dvd set of season 7 of DS9 sports a good, clean picture and sound transfer which upscales well on blu-ray players.

817755,5,6304209401,"Yet again Deep Space Nine has dealt with an abrupt change as a key character Jadzia Dax dies at the conclusion of the previous season and again changed the dynamic of a series that was finally getting it's legs on straight. Well the good news is there is a new Dax in Ezri,played by Nicole DeBoer. Of course she has almost nothing in common with Jadzia. She's a very young woman with no training in Trill joining so is extremely insecure. This all comes to play after the mini story arc (a lot broader than the overlong one introducing the previous season by the way) these issues with the newly christened Ezri Dax take hold in an episode called ""Afterimage"" where Ezri,a councelor tries to assist a hostile Garak with his claustrophobia. Aside from that this always complex and intertwining series became.....even more complex and intertwining. Rather than take on the moody approch of the fifth season of the show to produce conflict this season could be called ""the Dominion War season"" because episode after episode of this season deals with armed conflict,conspiricies and character difficulties of all sorts. While this season has some excellent shows this season over all lacks a lot of the humor and wacky moments that the other seasons had to temper it's serious nature. Even the two episodes that did focus largely on humor,the baseball send up of ""Take Me Out To The Holosuit"" and the Vegas style hijinxs of ""Badda-Bing-Badda-Bang"" all find that light heartedness out of conflict. On the serious side two episodes emerge as highly significant with ""Chimera"" focusing on Odo encounter another changling who,while not a founder is philosophically closer to their paranoid way of thinking and almost forces Odo into rethinking his burgeoning romance with Kira Nerys. In ""Covenant"" Kira again confronts Dukat who has gathered many Bajorans into a corruptible suicide cult while she does what she can to avert his evil deeds even as one of misguided mentors has to die in the process. Causualties of war style episodes such as ""It's Only A Paper Moon"" and ""Treachery,Faith & The Great River Aside"" the season ends with a complex and long story arc,covering the entirety of the final three DVD's. Basically you can boil it down to this: Dukat disguises himself as a Bajoran to win favor with Kai Winn and turn her against the prophets,the Dominion's alliegence with the Caradassians begins to fall apart,the founders wind up with an illness infecting all of them passed onto them by an unsuspecting Odo after being implanted with the virus at Starfleet medical and it all comes to a head in the finale ""What You Leave Behind"" where the war ends at a terrible cost,Deep Space Nine's crew begin to move on and in the end.......the loss is Sisko to the wormhole alien/prophets where he's ""completed his task"" and must learn from them. He leaves behind a pregnant wife and a grown son in Jake seeking solace after the long war and spiritual tract he's endured the last few years. The series got resolved much in the way the 1990's decade itself did: with an event of exasperation (in real life Y2K) that put a new spin on things with no genuine closure but more a sense of perspective.",1277683200,,3187,4.806921675774134

817758,5,6304209401,"About the only complaint that one could make about Season Seven is that they perhaps had too much story for the number of episodes.  There were a few standalone episodes, but the majority of episodes in Season Seven were, in the terminology of THE X-FILE, ""mythology.""  The events of the last few episodes felt a tad compressed, but the show did an adequate job of wrapping up the major story arcs.  All in all, I consider it one of the more satisfying wrap ups of a series in the past decade or so.  From first to last the show was done the way a show should be done.

The season reached a crescendo with all of the varied plotlines that had dominated the show for the previous six years reaching resolution.  With the Dominion pushing deeper and deeper into Federation space and bringing in the Breen as allies (and thereby eventually alienating the Cardassians), they did a great job bringing everything to a clash.

One of the more controversial changes in Season Seven was the replacement of Terry Ferrel (Jadzia Dax) with Nicole de Boer (Ezri Dax).  You hear various versions of precisely what happened to end Terry Ferrell's involvement with the series, but there is little debate that it involved money.  She had signed a six-year contract and upon discussion of renewal my guess is that when the powers that be tried to low ball her, her agent put out feelers for new gigs, which led to her moving to the show BECKER.  I did not want to see Ferrell leave the show, but I loved the changes that Ezri Dax brought to the show.  In contrast with the supremely confident and assertive Jadzia, Ezri is more introspective, less self-confident, and far less prepared to be a symbiote host.  She quickly became one of my favorite characters on the show.  Now, this is what gets me.  You hear that Nicole de Boer's joining the show was unpopular, but everyone I have talked to loved her.  Obviously there must be Ezri Dax haters, but I think it is OK to love both Daxes.  I loved the complicated nature of her relations with people who had previously known her as Jadzia.

One of my favorite additions in Season Seven, although he was introduced briefly in Season Six, was James Darren's Vic Fontaine, a Rat Pack style casino singer.  Darren was absolutely brilliant in the role and every episode in which he appears is a highpoint in the season.  And in a way the series itself ended in Vic's lounge.  Although there were scenes that came after it, the final shot involving all of the cast was in the lounge with Vic singing ""Just the Way You Look Tonight,"" with all of the writers and producers sitting as patrons in the tables at the front.  It was just a great way to say goodbye to all of the characters.

This was easily my favorite STAR TREK series, in fact the only one I can honestly say that I love.  I regret that they didn't take it to Season Eight.  I think that there was plenty of gas left in the tank and that they could easily have managed an additional year.  But perhaps it is better to go out on top when you haven't run out of ideas, but that is more of a solace to me rather a real conviction.  Luckily, this is the STAR TREK series that for me stands up best to reviewings.  And the one STAR TREK series that I believe can be considered among the best TV SF series of all time.

Note:  In watching the special features, make sure you are thorough in looking about for hidden features.  There are lots and lots and lots of short features, so make sure you hit the right and left and up and down arrows on your remote.  Just about every important recurring character on DS9 has a small feature, from Gul Dukat to Nog to Rom to Kai Winn Jeffrey Combs many characters, so if you feel like you have missed someone, keep looking.",1261180800,,3745,4.415451895043732

A few flies in the ointment bothered me, however: why was such valuable real estate as the next-to-last DS9 episode EVER given over to a marginal ""funny Ferengi"" story?  And the long, drawn-out, wearying Dominion War ends abruptly in the last episode, hinging on a plot point or two that, in previous seasons, would have resulted in, at best, minor ground being gained by the Federation, but certainly not an ultimate victory.  While not fatally abrupt, or totally non-sensical, the closing episode smacked of ""it's the last show, so we gotta wrap this up!""  And I wasn't crazy about the vagueness of Sisko's final fate, especially as there won't be any DS9 movies to give us a little more meat about that fate.  Still, prior to the uneven closing shows, there were many great episodes during the course of the season, as good as any the show's ever done (I'm lookin' at you, Vic Fontaine!).  So I'm happy.  Just count me as someone who thinks that ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" is still the best of the post-original series ""Treks"", with the jury still out on the runner-up spot (""Voyager"" is growing on me).  But, even so, I'll definitely miss Benjamin, Kira, and the gang.  I'm sorry the ride's over.",1212451200,,1359,4.773504273504273
817804,2,6304209401,"OK. I'm a huge StarTrek nerd, and DS9 is my favorite StarTrek series. That said, this final season is such a huge disappointment. The ingrates, that's right ingrates, running the Trek franchise just completely nose-dived this series into the ground.

Why ingrates? Well, the producers took the expansive loyalty and enthusiastic good-will of StarTrek fans and exploited it in an attempt to gratify their own outsized egos. Where to begin? How about Ezri Dax for starters. one question. WTF were you guys thinking? I realize losing Terry Farrell was a major blow, but come on! They wasted half of the FINAL season introducing and enlarging a character that was little more than a band-aid. Yes, she's a cutie, but there's an inter-stellar war on! They should have just buried Dax and let it be.

Next, Vic Fontaine. Need I say more? Well I will anyway. What in the name of all that is holy? Who's idea was this? Got to be Ira Behr's doing. I mean, come on Ira, who is this singer/actor/cheese sandwich, your boyfriend or something? Seriously, there's no other explanation for his presence on this show. Maybe if Behr would take off his Wayfarers when he went to work, he could see when he was making a gigantic mistep. OK, maybe, MAYBE, a one-off episode. But They made him a major character. Were they just bored with writing Sci-Fi? Look, if you'd rather be writing insipid rat-pack rip offs, then please, for all our sakes, just quit Trek. Leave the show with some dignity.

And finally, the resolving of the Dominion war is just lame. It doesn't make sense any way you look at it. It comes off like a undergrad creative writing assignment where the student realizes he's already reached the minimum required length, and decides to lazily tie up the story in one final paragraph. Why do you think the DS9 books are so popular? Because fans NEED them just to give some kind of believable closure to characters we'd all grown to love so much.

Bad job, Guys. You really dropped the ball here... as well as in other Trek series (Enterprise anyone?). Lets hope the new Trek movie will breathe some life back into Gene Roddenberry's much-loved Universe.",1193356800,7,2150,4.725333333333333

Now that I've gotten to the end, so many different stories were completed, and brought to a great closing.  The lasy half of the season is basically one long episode.  Which I needed, because their were a few episodes I wasn't that thrilled with.  All mainly because the new dax was featured so much.  Though I wasn't thrilled with her to begin with, she did grow on me.  Regardless, this show ended in a way I haven't seen before.  Everyone going their seperate ways, and not.  The last episode takes all the stories and character build up, and gives us a begining of their new life, as well as an ending to the old.  Some of them suprised me, others saddened me, but all were worth waiting for.  Obviously this is not the place to start, but certainly worth watching regardless.

I have watched each season over the course of seven months, laughing, crying and totally enthralled all the way. I have grown to know and love these people in the course of over 700 hours. What started out rather dull, seasons 1 & 2, have propelled me to this spectacular crescendo.

My only complaint is Paramount. Why this studio offers each series at such a big price tag is beyond me. I hope the cast and crew of the show gets most of the royalties. I wonder if it was the intention of Paramount to kill the franchise with little promotion and high prices? They killed their biggest money maker. Star trek fans are loyal...CBS will now show them how big of a mistake they made.

817811,4,6304209401,"I'm going to have to admit to being contrary to popular opinion, the sixth season of DS9 is probably one of my least favorites of the show.  It was particularly disappointing after watching the tension, intrigue, and suspense build up from seasons 3-5 with the introduction of the Dominion all the way to full-out war in the fifth season finale Call to Arms.  Undoubtedly, this had me excited with the prospect of war in season six, but things didn't turn out as I'd hoped.

The Dominion occupation of DS9 was a very disappointing story arc, with a silly deus ex machina resolution via the Prophets.  The rest of the season simply didn't focus as much on the war as I'd hoped it would; consequently, all the build up the previous years felt like it'd been for naught, especially when the trade-off for the lack of exploration into the Gamma Quadrant was supposed to be this larger focus on the war.

But I'm pleased to say that the show regained its footing in season 7, making up for lost ground with some exceptional Dominion Arc episodes, most particularly The Siege of AR-558 and the Final Chapter's What You Leave Behind Parts I and II.  I must admit that I didn't see all of the season's episodes, mostly just tried to catch those that furthered the Dominion War.

Take Me Out to the Holosuite- B. Pure filler, but baseball fans will eat it up, and there's no question this episode delivers its fair share of laughs.

Treachery, Faith, and the Great River- B.  A good Weyoun episode, particularly effective since it brings up intriguing details about the Vorta while also introducing other elements that thicken the Dominion arc.

The Siege of AR-558- A-.  One of the season's best episodes, this is a surprisingly powerful look into the psychological effects of warfare on Federation soldiers.  The episode also delivers strongly on a visceral level, with plenty of gut-wrenching suspense and a pretty intense battle scene (mixing up firefights with hand-to-hand combat) towards the end.

Penumbra- C+.  The beginning of DS9's Final Chapter arc, but admittedly, it's not the best start, seeing as Ezri and Worf don't really have much chemistry together.

'Till Death Do Us Part- C.  Even slower than Part I, due in no small part to the extra focus on Gul Dukat and Kai Winn.

Strange Bedfellows- C+.  The story arc improves a bit here, and there's some particularly funny interaction between Weyoun and Damara.

The Changing Face of Evil- B+.  Finally, the story picks up the pace here.  While the Dukat and Winn scenes still slow the plot down, the Dominion arc continues to deliver engrossing revelations.  We also get a damn good space battle between the Federation and the Breen.

When it Rains...- B+.  Now that the Final Chapter has found its footing, this episode delivers another engrossing continuation, especially as the plot splits between Damara/Kira's rebel movement and more secrets about the disease killing the Founders is revealed.

Tackling Into the Wind- B+.  The quality streak continues, with this episode working in some solid suspense thanks to the rebel movement's mission to steal a Breen weapon.  This is juxtaposed with Worf's confrontation with Gowron over the fate of the Klingon Empire.  Both stories work quite well, even if the latter does seem a bit rushed.

Extreme Measures- C.  An unfortunate stumble after three solid episodes.  While the premise isn't bad, it's not executed with enough visual imagination and plot ingenuity.

The Dogs of War- B.  I'd rate it a B+ if not for the Ferengi scenes, which drag it down a bit.  Otherwise, Damar/Kira's rebel movement remains very compelling, as do the Federation and the Dominion's strategies towards resolving the fate of the Alpha Quadrant.

What You Leave Behind, Part I- A-.  This definitely rates as one of the most thrilling DS9 episodes I've seen, as we get a visually stunning and exciting massive-scale space battle (one of the franchise's best moments of pure spectacle) juxtaposed with the rebel movement's attempts to infiltrate Dominion headquarters on Cardassia Prime.

What You Leave Behind, Part II- A-.  The war comes to a satisfying end.  After all the thrills of Part I (and through the beginning of Part II), this last segment of the Final Chapter delivers an emotionally resonant climax.  There are some nicely done montages, a moving score from Dennis McCarthy, several touching good-byes (particularly between Odo and Kira), and an unforgettably awesome final scene that's almost guaranteed to put a lump in your throat.",1144800000,3,4533,4.944444444444445
817890,3,6304209401,"First off, allow me to comment on the price- TOO HIGH, by a factor of two.

Hey Viacom/Paramount, many excellent competing sci-fi series have NO PROBLEM selling their DVD sets for $50/season, so why do you insist on idiotically charging double to triple that? When your Amazon DVD sales rank is hovering in the #4,000-7,000 range (not only for DS9 but NextGen as well), there just MAY be a problem with that strategy. DUH.

Secondly, allow me to say that I LOVE DS9, and think it the best overall of all the StarTrek series. Yep, it even narrowly edges NextGen, which while great, was overly familiar and 'safe' at times. Not so DS9, by and large. Even when the series occassionally got whimsical (as with the the Vulcan baseball episode or the Vic Fontaine character) it did so in interesting and original ways that added to the series.

But Paramount did this series WRONG, in the end. You can tell from the last few episodes of Season 7 that the writers/creatives staff had planned to tie up all the story arcs in Season 8. A season they were NOT to have, due to the AWFUL decision to cancel DS9 in favor of the (extremely mediocre) Voyager.

The weak reason given was that having two Trek shows out there at the same time was 'cannibalizing the Star Trek franchise'... when in reality, the fading ratings were more due to the fading quality and freshness of the ST franchise, some of which was inevitable (without a major 're-imagining' that we're STILL waiting for, due to a lack of vision/guts from those at the top), and some of which wasn't, as anyone who had to endure awful season after awful season of Voyager 'till it FINALLY got 'okay' near the end, can attest.

The ensuing bomb series 'Enterprise' was the coffin nail that finally proved the point- tired, formulaic cookie-cutter writing and boring, simplistic, idealized characters just were not cutting it anymore. When the plot and style is as safe and predictable as the sun coming up in the morning, and a show has an 'ensemble' cast yet you find you only give a rat's ass about one or two of the characters, the writing is on the wall.

DS9, in its mid- to late years, was the opposite of all that. Darker, edgier characters, tougher situations (who can forget Sisko's aiding and abetting an assassination, in the name of winning the war?), and a willingness to break the Trek 'mold' when needed served the series well.

Unfortunately, DS9 was at times not as 'accessible' as it could have been (some of this had to do with its oft-used religous themes), and it got off to a slow start in its first couple of seasons (as had NextGen before it), but still, the quality was all there. They just had the misfortune of having to compete against Jeri Ryan's catsuit while other 'suits' made the safe and easy choice- the mediocre-to-bad but slightly higher-rated Voyager over a wonderful DS9 series that was in full stride.

'tis a pity. Season Eight would've rocked the house, and the last third of Season Seven would've been so much the better for not having to frantically (and inadequately) trying to tie up what loose ends it could. Fans watching the closing episodes with a discerning eye were doubly cheated- their series ended prematurely, AND not well.

Hey, when the final episode is mostly MONTAGE (a la 'Baywatch', lol), you know something didn't go right.

Wake up Paramount/Viacom, you've managed, through the above-stated idiocy, to put a formerly hugely successful, four-decade running franchise on life support. Either get a clue, or sell the Trek franchise to someone who actually has one.

As the success of the new Battlestar Galactica series proves (helmed, ironically, by a former DS9 writer), people are not tired of sci-fi, they are tired of visionless, gutless, formulaic, weak-ass sci-fi.",1136332800,14,3780,4.755725190839694
817891,2,6304209401,"Many problems in this last season. Other reviewers have pointed them out but I will also join them in their points. First, the Ezri character was a huge blunder. Talk about awkward story lines and feeling, she just didn't fit in or mesh on the show at all. I don't blame the actress, I have seen her in other works and she is a fine actress. The character simply was badly written.

Second, poor plots in general. Some really silly episodes like the one where they go play a baseball game devolve the show into a parody.

Third, the romance between Odo and Kira was ineptly handled and even embarrassing at times. Why they tried to make Odo and Kira interaction into some sort of beauty and the beast type relationship was ridiculous. Odo's makeup slowly becomes more and more absurd, it is laughable.

It is strange, but also the character of Kira changes for the worse. She for many years was a linchpin of the show, but watch when she changes her hairstyle from the ""rebel"" type look into a straight conventional style, that is a cue for when her character starts to go out the window. She goes from a passionate, lively and fascinating character into a total run-of-the-mill sci fi character and dullsville. I'm not sure of the exact episode this happens, it might have been in a late episode of season six.

Overall, not to sound like I dislike the show, I'm a huge fan and watch it all the time on TV although I have seen just about every episode numerous times. I consider it the finest of all the Star Trek series and a masterpiece in its own right. 5 stars for seasons one through six, but skip this seventh season is my suggestion.",1136160000,7,1641,4.46
817892,3,6304209401,"--SPOILER ALERT-DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED
For me, Season 7 was a disappointing conclusion to a series that improved each year but unfortunately peaked with the wonderful seasons four, five & six.  While the decision to finish the Dominion War with the 10-episode arc was exciting and ambitious, the payoff was much too hollow.  Here are my specific problems with it:

Ezri Dax.  The Dax symbiant should have died or gone away with Jadzia.  There wasn't enough time to develop an interest in Ezri, which left the writers ramming her down our throats for the first quarter of the season.  They would have been better off resolving the fate of Dax in a single episode.

Gul Dukat.  Personally, I would have rather seen Dukat, along with Dumar, lead his people in a rebel uprising against the Dominion.  His obsession with the Pah Wraiths never felt right nor did his (yech!) romantic storyline with Kai Winn.  As someone who was consistently villainous throughout the series, Winn should have been the ""wolf in sheep clothing"" that Sisko was destined to stop.  Dukat, while villainous in his own right, had shown a virtuous streak from time to time and would have made a much more exciting surprise hero.

Odo & Kira.  I'm sure there are many who feel passionately opposite of me on this one but I think the Odo & Kira romance should have ended before the series did.  It had to happen, they had been setting it up for years, but the chemistry between the two never rang true for me and I think it should have run for a few episodes and then gracefully found new paths for each of them.  Not that I wanted to see this either, but there was more chemistry between Kira & O'Brien when she was carrying his child.

The female Changeling.  I am in agreement with some other reviewers who were vexed by the abrupt end of the war.  Plus, it always bothered me that the Founders would be as homicidal as the female Changeling.  I think we would have been better off discovering that she had taken matters into her own hands and was acting without their knowledge.  Otherwise, surely the Klingons or Romulons would wipe out the Changelings from space.  Her character was truly evil and should have been treated as such.

Sisko.  Far and away my biggest gripe with the series conclusion was the handling of Sisko's fate.  For seven years we had been reminded of his role as the Emissary only to have it end with him pushing the bad guy off a cliff.  And when he leaves for this great moment, he just runs off like he left something burning in the kitchen.  Not even a glance toward Jake, who I could have been convinced was his son in real life.  In fact, even when he appears to Cassidy in a vision, still not a word for or about Jake.  Clearly this was a sloppy loose end and I refuse to believe it was the way they had planned it.  He could have died, he could have come back, I don't even have a problem with some sense of uncertainty, but for a series conclusion, this was a weak resolution for your central character.

Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy much of Season 7 and would recommend it to those who like shows like this.  DS9 surprised me with the improvement of each new season in much the same way TNG did.  I do feel that, given the broader scope of story, it had the opportunity to finish stronger than TNG did but unfortunately, did not.",1132185600,27,3352,4.444262295081967

Season 6 & 7 are darker than dark. Due to the Dominion War you see a transformation in the characters that is perfect. By the time you end out the season and the complete DS9 series, you know so much about these characters that they feel like family!

You get to see how the war is taking its toll on the Captain and its crew when all their colleagues are coming home in body bags, you see how 1 lone alien who is part of the race who started the Dominion war struggles with what his people are doing then is inflicted with a deadly disease by a secret section of The Federation (the infamous SECTION 31, lol) to wipe out the Dominion aliens; You see how Captain Sisko's connection to the religion that adopted him (since he was never religious until he came to DS9) builds and plays a huge role in his life and where the path of The Prophets lead him.

You see how Gul Dukat (former glorious military leader of Cardassia, now cast out and shamed) becomes mad and starts to lose himself and his mind in the evil religion of the people he helped to occupy and destroy (Bajorins and the occupation of Bajor); his closest aid (Gul Damar) changes from a proud soldier of Cardassia under Gul Dukat's rule, to a Dominion collaborator, to a freedom fighting revolutionary against the Dominion and ultimately a war hero to his people.

I could go on and on and on ... There is so much depth in the later seasons of Deep Space 9 that you could drown.

Seasons 6 & 7 are fabulous ... even if you purchase them on their own without the rest of the seasons (although not quite sure other than money why you'd do that).

I've said it to my friends before and I will say it to Amazon readers now -- there is absolutely no way that DS9 should not be considered the best Star Trek series of all the Star Trek series! I love them all, but *HANDS DOWN* DS9 * IS * THE * BEST. If you are not engulfed by this series then you just don't like dark dramas. I've heard a lot of TNG fans rag on DS9. There are some major differences between them, one being that the TNG crew is constantly moving and the DS9 crew is stationary. You know what I think? The writing had to be deeper and more involved on DS9 because of the very fact that the crew was stationary -- -- I'm sure it was a much greater challenge to write for them.

You TNG fans... Don't rag on DS9!! You cannot compare apples to oranges. Have faith in the Prophets... They will guide you!! LOL ;)",1123113600,2,2713,4.2057692307692305
817895,5,6304209401,"Nominated for 28 Emmys, including several for Outstanding Visual Effects, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine continues the rich tradition of the original 1960s Star Trek franchise. Created by former L.A. police officer Gene Roddenberry, the Star Trek TV series morphed into a franchise famous for the unprecedented fanatical devotion of its audience. Lasting only three seasons during its original network run, Star Trek struck gold with its syndicated reruns, launching a number of motion pictures featuring the original cast as well as novels, comic books, collectibles, and reams of Star Trek-related memorabilia. Following on the heels of Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987), the first Star Trek series spin-off of the original, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine foreshadowed additional spin-offs - Star Trek: Voyager (1995), and Star Trek: Enterprise (2001). Sporting an entirely new cast and crew from its two predecessors, the show focuses on a particular system administered by the Federation instead of the usual Star Trek mission of ""exploring strange new worlds""...

Star Trek: Deep Space Nine follows the exploits of the Starfleet crew aboard an abandoned and gutted Cardassian space station orbiting the planet of Bajor. In the aftermath of Cardassian occupation, the Bajorian government invited the Starfleet to oversee the reconstruction of the space station. Deep Space Nine quickly transformed into a teeming city of commerce and a hub for travel (similar to Babylon 5) thanks to the discovery of an unknown wormhole nearby. But the wormhole leads to the Gamma Quadrant, realm of the feared Dominion alliance, which views the wormhole travelers as a threat to its totalitarian grip on power. As such, the Dominion launches an attack against the Federation and its Klingon allies. The subsequent and ongoing war is the basis for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine...

Capt. Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) is credited with discovering the wormhole, and he oversees the crew of Deep Space Nine as they wage battle to preserve the Federation. Ironically, his colleague, Constable Odo (Rene Auberjonois), is a Changeling - an alien race of ""shapeshifters"" who lead the Dominion's united front. Together with the rest of the crew aboard Deep Space Nine, they struggle with internal and external conflicts that threaten to destroy their very way of life...

The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (Season 7) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""Image in the Sand"" in which Sisko searches for the Bajorian Orb of the Emissary which will allow him to reopen the now closed wormhole to Gamma Quadrant. In his absence, Kira commands Deep Space Nine while Sisko sees images of his mother's face in the sand... Other notable episodes from Season 7 include ""Covenant"" in which Kira is pressured to join a cult religious group when she is accidentally teleported to Empok Nor, and ""Extreme Measures"" in which Dr. Bashir and Miles go to great lengths to discover a cure for a dangerous and life-threatening virus...

817942,3,6304209401,"After season 6 leaves you on such high, season 7 is a huge disappointment.  The writers get way off track forcing unneccessary character Ezri Dax unto the viewer without any rhyme nor reason.

The season's opener is a continuation of 6's cliffhanger, but watered down to introduce Ezri Dax.  The next few episodes also take you away from the strength of the series (its established characters and Dominion War storyline) to try and make the Ersatz Dax character have some relevance.

The nadir of the series hits with the wasteful ""take me out to the holosuite"" epidsode.  Simply horrible and a waste of an hour.

It takes the writers the last 6 episodes to get on track, but even for a devout DS9 fan its a struggle to get the momentum back.

This was a disappointing ending to a great, great series.",1102464000,7,801,4.598591549295775
817943,5,6304209401,"There is no other word for this absolutely fabulous show that falls neatly and wonderfully into the Star Trek universe but......unforgettable.
This shows' creative writing and producing staff wove a tapestry of characters and interwoven plots like master painters. All characters were totally believable,colourful and three dimensional.
The biggest thing I loved about DS9 was its' different take on the Star Trek domain. This was centered around a group of individuals who worked and lived in a  deep space federation station. For all fans used to life on the Enterprise this was some departure. It took guts and vision and the gamble paid off handsomely.
One soon found out that this was not going to be a boring series centered around a static and boring way station. It was an incredibly diverse place with  a myriad of cultures and races that  passed through its' portals,some benevolent but many others quite malevolent.
We learned over time of its' history and saw our favourite characters virtually grow right before our eyes as much inwardly as outwardly. We also sadly,saw some die.
It was a show that I spent seven memorable years with,never missing an episode. Even though it's been off the air for some time now I still miss my ""old friends"".I know I won't ever forget  them. It was an unforgettable journey.
One thing that comes to mind everytime I recall the show is the relationship between Capt. Cisco and his son Jake. To me it was the most natural,heartfelt,positive and powerful role model for father/son relationships extant on TV then,before or since.
I will always consider the original series my favourite of all of them. But STDS9 comes in at almost a virtual tie. It is almost an apples and oranges argument. They were of the same universe but of two very different and original aspects of it. And I treasure both for those very reasons.
""The Next Generation"" was just that, a new generation/crew on the newer version of the same ship...same old,same old.""Enterprise""is the current prequel to the whole series but with far too little panache or interest to make it worth ones while to watch for too long. And ""Voyager"",well it was the WORST of the entire series so far and it(the craft and series!) should have remained lost forever.
To anyone who maybe didn't quite get the feel for DS9 the first time around and is a Star Trek fan I can't encourage you enough to try the show again. If you perhaps aren't a Star Trek fan and/or are trying to decide how best to test the Star Trek waters for the first time,I again urge you to view this series.
All of you will marvel not only at the originality and quality of the scripts but the fantastic ensemble acting and character depth that develops practically right from the start. This is NOT a Capt. Kirk or Picard race around the universe shooting up every alien in sight with phasers on kill(with apologies to both series).This series comes at you from day one from a totally different place than all the other series and it is the one thing that drove many in Star Trek fandom to either like it because of that or dislike it because it didn't fit their ""mold"".
My advice? Make my ""old ""friends"" your NEW ones!!!",1094428800,8,3186,4.714542190305206
817944,5,6304209401,"Honestly, all I can say is, wow. When DS9 first aired, I never really liked it as much as the Next Generation, or the Original Series, for that matter. Despite a spectacular pilot and some great early episodes, the plots often seemed contrived or silly at the beginning. But then, so did TNG. As the show went on, though, it really went wild. The plots improved, the characters were always developed in a consistant and very human manner, and the special effects were incredible. Even the introduction of Worf from TNG, which I was really skeptical about, only seemed to make the cast stronger. By the end of the seventh season, I was literally on the edge of my seat at the end of every episode, and I couldn't wait for the next one. I've never really reacted that way to a television series before. Some people say that DS9 betrayed Gene Roddenbery's vision of the future, because it's darker and more violent. But I think it's really completely the opposite. Star Trek isn't about flying around in space somewhere and meeting weird aliens, appearances notwithstanding. It's about hope and exploring the human condition, and Deep Space Nine has that in spades. Data on TNG helped explore some of the broader philosophical implications of humanity, which was really great, but characters like Constable Odo (in a metaphorical sense) and Miles O'Brien explored what it meant to be human, and a good human, on a down-to-earth, day to day basis. And despite all the darkness that pervaded the tone of the series, it still stands as an affirmation of basic human goodness, that we can better ourselves if we try. The end of series, when Odo goes back to his people to heal them of the disease that's ravaging their species and teach them not to fear the ""solids"" is a great moment. It would be all too easy to say, ""No, they've done too much damage, we have to let them die"", but this is Star Trek, not some petty sci-fi war show, and so that's not what happens. It ends with a note of forgiveness and redemption, which truly makes this a powerful series. DS9 doesn't reach out and beat you over the head with its message like the other Trek series tend to; you have to look for it and think about it, and that only makes the message stronger in the end. The seventh season itself is one of the show's best, starting off on an odd note with the introduction of Ezri Dax (played by the unbelievably cute Nicole deBoer), to replace the late Jadzia (after Terrey Farrel left the show at the end of season 6). A lot of people seem to find Ezri annoying, but I personally liked her better than Jadzia; I guess it's a matter of personal taste. Leaving aside the incredible multi-part ending, there were some great episodes this season. The one where Bashir goes to Romulus with Admiral Ross (I'm not as good with episode names as some other Trekkies, but it's the one with the long Latin phrase that translates to, ""In times of war, the law falls silent."") was some great story-telling, not only showing us a different side of the Romulans (gotta love those pesky Romulans) and advancing the Section 31 story-line, but also showing the dangers inherent in allowing some self-described patriots do whatever they please with no accountability (a lesson that could be well taken in the real world). Some of the Ezri episodes were also great, providing a needed relief from the tension of the war. They way the show develops the stories of so many of the recurring guest characters is also pretty amazing, since none of the other Trek series really do that, at least, not to the same extent. I could go on for a long time about the season, but suffice it to say that it's truly a great ending to a remarkable show, with plenty of surprises and twists along the way. Check this one out; you won't regret it.",1093737600,4,3793,4.5712187958884
817945,3,6304209401,"This season of DS9 is good, but previous seasons easily outdo it. Ezri Dax was completely pointless and totally irritating...perhaps they should've eliminated the Dax character altogether after Jadzia died and not introduce any new characters in her place. The continuing conflict with the Dominion, and the Cardassian rebellion were wonderful, but pointless episodes like ""Take Me Out to the Holosuite"" and ""It's Only a Paper Moon"" dragged this season down. Why was there ever a Vic Fontaine? Easily one of the most ridiculous episodes in the series was ""The Emperor's New Cloak"". Unfortunately the writers seemed to be suffering from amnesia in this episode, since in ""Through the Looking Glass"" it was already proven that the Alliance had cloaking technology. It was terribly frustrating to see the Alliance not get a fair shake at the end; at least in ""What You Leave Behind"" the Dominion puts up one hell of a fight, yet in this episode the only Alliance ship we see is Worf's flagship. And, once again it seems the station has magically re-orbited itself back into Bajor, since in ""Shattered Mirror"" there's no sign of the planet anywhere. However, this begs the question, if Bajor is a member of the Klingon/Cardassian Alliance, then why didn't they just send an assault force once the station fell into Terran hands and retake Terok Nor? I doubt the rebels on the station would've been a match for an entire planet. This just proves that Star Trek needs to get better and more competent writers pronto, especially with all the screw ups going on in Enterprise.",1089244800,5,1568,4.920754716981132
817946,5,6304209401,"Star Trek has had some memorable moments, and certainly some memorable seasons, especially those of The Next Generation if you ask me.  But one season far overshadows any season of TNG, or any other Star Trek for that matter.  This one.  The intense drama level of this season is never equalled in any Star Trek before or after, nor is the amazingly entertaining degree of evil characterizing this show's bad guys.  And if you have watched the show from the start, gotten to know its deep plot and memorable characters, nothing in the world can beat the last eight episodes or so, as you see played out the galaxy's all-time greatest battle.",1080518400,2,641,4.696428571428571
817947,4,6304209401,"I think that this series never got the respect it deserved when it was on the show, like the times kept getting shifted, and it was never given the chance to be the only new star trek by itself.  The hard thing about DS9 was that if you didn't watch it closely, you'd have missed some of the plot-lines that went multiple episodes.  Now that they've come out on DVD, it's possible to catch up.  Boy oh boy!  This would be somewhat hard to watch in syndication unless if the station showed everything in order.
I can't believe how much I cried while watching some of the episodes.  The series finale, definitely.  But I just watched It's Only a Paper Moon today, and that was another one.  It has Nog dealing with the effects of being in the war.  What a powerful episode.  Nog sure has come long way from the little troublemaker he was in the series pilot....  The actor did a wonderful job in Paper Moon.  I think what makes it even more poignant is that we're dealing with wars right now.  Vic Fontaine was wonderful in this episode too.  I'm so glad they introduced that character.  Too bad he hadn't been a regular on the series.  Why do we love our holograms so??  :-)  Perhaps it's because when they experience day to day living as holograms, it gives us a better appreciation of what it means to be human.  Something we so take for granted, maybe.
The reason I'm giving this 4 stars is that because this season has so much to do with war, some of the episodes have been really hard for me to watch.  I cry so much that the end I'm just so exhausted.  But it's not a complaint about the acting.  Rather, the actors have done a great job of making me feel emotionally connected to the situations they find themselves in.
The different love stories that come up in the season do two things.  One, love gives you a sense of hope in the midst of the bleakness of the Dominion war.  Two, you never know if you're going to lose one of your loved ones to the war, and so it ups the emotional ante.
I would recommend taking this season in small doses.",1078617600,3,2049,4.278645833333333

818000,5,6304209401,"I said goodbye to some friends tonight, after spending the last six months purchasing and watching the entire DS9 series on DVD.  There are few TV shows that can compare with DS9, forget Star Trek comparisons.  This was an epic set in the Star Trek universe and it was not primarily episodic, like its sibling shows.  I can think of other shows I have seen, such as Hill Street Blues, that depend on your emotional investment to the development of the characters, and this one is similarly well-written.  DS9 makes you care.
This seventh season wrapped up most of the story lines neatly, some not so neat.
I enjoyed the ten-part story arc to end the war with the Dominion, which was handled with so much intrigue throughout the series.  Weyoun is probably my favorite character and he finally got his time to shine in the best episode in the season, in my opinion, Treachery, Faith and the Great River.  I thought he met his fate too abruptly and thoughtlessly at the end, but then again, I also strongly believed the female shapeshifter deserved much worse.
She, and her fellow founders, were directly responsible for the death of billions of Cardassians, Klingons, Breen, Romulans and Federation citizens, not to mention the erradication of the Maquis and the senseless sacrifices of their own bred and cloned slaves, the Jem-hadar and Vorta.
This made me hard to swallow Odo returning to his people at the end, they seemed too brutal to me to deserve any kind of redemption. (I too learned this spoiler early, thanks to the crew dossiers on an earlier season, bad move)
The emissary plot ended about right and in the same tone as the series began, if a bit anti-climatic being scrunched between the goodbyes. I also felt Dukat was better suited in the Dominion Plot than with his extended involvement with the Pah-Wraiths and Kai Wynn (yucky)
The introduction of a new character in Ezri Dax, started out as a disaster in the intial episode, she seemed so annoying.  But luckily, they toned her down a bit, and even if I would have like to see Jadzia make it till the end, I enjoyed what the new Dax brought to the table.
And Worf, who tied so much of Star Trek together, showed how cyclical in nature one's life can be, usurping the Chancellor he put in power in TNG for the good of the Klingon Empire.
I wish there was another season after watching this one, and I know I really missed the boat when the show was on the air, but thank God for series' on DVD!",1075680000,10,2462,4.5565610859728505
818001,5,6304209401,"I couldn't watch DS9 when it was on its initial run because my local station didn't pick it up... I decided to give the DVDs a shot... Slowly and methodically, I've been working my way through each and every episode... Some were outstanding! Some were rather boring (I don't care for the Ferrengi episodes). But I finally made it through to the end and was treated
with an outstanding series finale at the end of Season 7 (much better than ""All Good Things"" and ""Endgame""). All in all, I think that the DS9 series was the best Star Trek franchise to date and well worth the serious investment of time.
*** Spoilers ahead (for those who haven't seen it) ***
However, there was one part that I didn't like and that was spoilers... I couldn't watch any of the crew dossiers because they gave too much of the plot away. Like the Odo dossier that has him finally returning to his people at the end of the series. Well, I accidentely watched the dossier and that
particular ending was spoiled for me. There was another special feature talking about how Rom became the Grand Nagus at the end of the series. Again, this surprise was spoiled for me.
Don't get me wrong, I'm glad that they put all of the specials in each season. However, I think they should have at least warned which special features had possible spoilers...",1073865600,8,1317,4.514644351464435
818002,5,6304209401,"I have to say, this was one of DS9's finest seasons.  Great battles, intriging mysteries, amazing adventures, what more could you ask for?  I've seen all the seasons of DS9, but I had to go out and buy this one.  Yeah yeah, it's a little pricey, but it's well worth it!  I really liked the 9 or 10 episode arc at the end.  That was done really well.
The last episode ""What you leave behind"" was a great episode to end with.  My only problem with that episode was the fact that the Dominion just surrended after Odo linked with the female changeling for two seconds.  I thought that there should have been a final battle, or at least the start of a battle and then they surrender mid-way.  At the very least, the Breen should have disobeyed the Dominion and fought anyway.  Then both the Jem'Hadar and the Federation would wipe them out.  That would have been cool.
In any case, this is one of DS9's best seasons and it is well worth it!  I especially love the relationship between Bashir and O'Brien in this season, as well as every other.  The scene with them sitting up against the wall in ""Extreme Measures"" was classic.  Also the introduction of Ezri Dax occurs in this season.  Now, I know you guys out there, if you were thinking about it but weren't quite sure about buying this season, Ezri will DEFINITELY tip the scales and make you running for the nearest Best Buy.  Or, if you're not the running type, just order it off amazon.

818003,5,6304209401,"DS9 has always been my favourite trek.  The fact that the Federation and the Bajorans had to constantly work together to keep the station running was what made the show interesting.  Constant conflict, no neat and tidy endings (like TNG), and continuing story arcs that encompassed fun stuff but also politics and religion.  The extras are great (love the crew dossiers).  I was so psyched when the final season came out.  The resolution of the Dominion War, Section 31....all amazing.
***note to diehards*** - I got THIS final set at Future Shop (in canada) and it came with an extra DVD packaged outside of the boxed set.  Does anyone know if the other 6 season have a similar extra DVD, and if so, can you buy them separately?",1072310400,,729,4.65625
818004,5,6304209401,"The seventh season of Star Trek Deep Space Nine is the conclusion of Star Trek's best, richest, most character and plot driven series to date, without exception.  Even more so than when The Next Generation was concluded, the sense of the loss of this series for this fan and all of the fans of DS9 was that much more profound, despite the producers, writers and actors extraordinary efforts and the brilliance of this season!
Never before and not since in the history of Star Trek has a series serialized so many portions of its run and from the very early beginnings of the rumors of the Dominion all the way through the final episode in the epic, the entire arc with the Dominion war was prophetic and superior in how it was all set up and concluded.
This incomparable seventh season also brought to the series and the fans the addition of a new character in Ezri Dax.  Given that the shows writers had a whole new character to play with and the fact that Ezri turned into such a unusual and wonderful character, many of the seasons early episodes were devoted to her and they were very good shows.  High praise goes to Nicole deBoer for her performances during this season.
To make things even better for this season of wrapping up character and plot arcs, the shows producers decided upon and carried out some very different things for the Star Trek universe.  From a brilliant and unprecedented ten episode arc to conclude the series to the extraordinary things they did with many of the characters to conclude the series; such as Captain Sisko's destiny, Rom's gift from Zek, Worf and Martok's intertwined destinies, the ultimate relationship between Bashir and Ezri, O'Brien's new assignment and Odo's return to the great link carrying the message of humanity, all of which wrapped up these characters perfectly.
For those that wish to find out what many of Star Trek fiction's finest authors and Pocket Books with approval through Paramount Studios believes what happens after the conclusion of ""What You Leave Behind,"" there is a whole new re-launch series available and most of these rich stories have received very high praise from fans and critics alike.
The episodes:
Image in the Sand & Shadows and Symbols- These two episodes pick up beautifully where the sixth season left off and starts the character of Benjamin Sisko down the path of the prophets through an unexpected new character introduced in these shows.  Ezri Dax is also introduced here in a funny and surprising way.
Afterimage - Ezri is finding out what it is to be a joined Trill and Garak, played perfectly by Andrew Robinson, and becomes her new patient as he finds ""he"" is a suffering from a moral dilemma.
Take Me Out to the Holosuite - Simply put, this is one of the series funniest and most cherished episodes ever produced.
Chrysalis - Bashir's genetically enhanced friends make a return in this beautiful yet heart wrenching episode.
Treachery, Faith and the Great River - It is episodes like this one that carried DS9 due to its rich script and superb acting as a Weyoun clone is found to be ""defective"" and seeks the aid of Odo while at the same time Nog may be in Starfleet but he proves he is still a Ferengi.
Once More Unto the Breach - John Colicos returns as Kor in this last amazing Klingon devoted episode of the series.
The Siege of AR-558 - The true effects of war come face to face with several of the characters in this episode.
Covenant - The final arc of Dukat and his covenant with the Pah-Wraiths begins in earnest in this extremely well written episode.
It's Only a Paper Moon - Vic Fontaine and Nog lead in this episode as Nog retreats to the holosuite to deal with his loss during his time on AR-558.
Prodigal Daughter - This beautiful episode introduces us to Ezri's family and a return for O'Brien as an intelligence operative dealing with the Orion syndicate.
The Emperor's New Cloak - This is the last brilliant mirror universe episode and at the same time the last great Ferengi episode.
Field of Fire - Ezri finds herself dealing with Joran, one of Dax's previous hosts that was a murderer and a series of murders takes place on the station.
Chimera - This is one story that I'd always hoped would come along, what if another changeling that was sent out like Odo showed up.  The character of Laas is played to perfection by J.G. Hertzler's brother, Garman.
Badda-Bing Badda-Bang - You knew it would have to happen; a show devoted to Vic Fontaine and despite some misgivings with this character and its place in Star Trek, the overall story is very good.
Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges - Sloan from Section 31 returns in this brilliantly written episode which is heavily laden with mystery and intrigue involving the Romulans.
Penumbra thru What You Leave Behind - ""Penumbra"" is where the extraordinary ten episode arc begins and the conclusion of the Dominion War and the series starts.  From gripping character driven scenes to extraordinary space battles between Federation, Klingon, Romulan, Dominion, Cardassian and Breen starships, every scene in these last ten episodes of the 176 hour saga is absolutely brilliant, leaving us, the fans longing for more yet remembering them fondly...  {ssintrepid}

The early episodes of season 7 were full of sentimentality, each main character having his own personnal problem to overcome episode (their last goodbye, I guess). They over-used the Vegas nightclub singer hologram to give everybody personnal advice on those matters.
Things didn't get really good until they got back to the almost-forgotten climactic battle between the Federation and the Dominion. The back-and-forth alliances with the Klingon Empire and also the Cardassians, over the course of the series, was interesting and made the story more dimensional (instead of good guys over here, bad guys over there). However, the way it all ended made you think that maybe they should've shaved off a couple of those tear-jerky episodes for a more satisfying, kick-ass conclusion than having one side simply... (well, better not give it away).
I still didn't understand the whole thing about the Prophets and their relationship with the wormhole, but who cares. That was just the writers trying to get all spiritual on us and prove that God (or Gods), is (are) indeed spoken about on Star Trek.

The other problem I had was the extensive Ezri Dax centered episodes. She's a whiner and belongs on Trill, not a front line station. Insecure and mentally shakey, I fail to see why the show's creators wanted such a character. One comment heard in the season 6 material is that they liked Sisko calling Dax 'old man'. Too bad Jadzia didn't make it through season 7 as well, because Ezri just doesn't do it for me. A male Dax host would have been far more progressive after the outstanding female host was killed. Other than these two areas, season 7 is terrific and makes a good end to a series I wish hadn't ended. Yet, these two characters kept me from giving season 7 a 5 star rating.",1070668800,5,1105,4.502487562189055
818008,4,6304209401,"first of all, i love ds9!  tos was the pioneer and a sentimental favorite, tng was the high-water mark and the most popular, but ds9 was the best and most real of all the series.  akin to ""on her majesty's secret service"" in the bond canon, ds9 was the best of the bunch...just short of perfection.  the characters were not as sterile as those on tng...there were many shades of gray and this made it the most fascinating of all the series.  with such a deliciously great cast of leading and supporting actors and characters and such fantastic, deep, and rich material, it's incomprehensible to me how this show, like tng, mishandled the second best character in the entire star trek universe...worf!  underutilized as in tng, ds9 gave worf a chance to develop into a truly fascinating character, second only to james t. kirk as far as unlimited complexities and untapped character exploration.
as any klingon fan knows, the death of a mate must be avenged...klingon-style.  worf did this once, after the death of k'ehleyr(sp?), so where was he after the death of dax(definitely the best female character in the star trek universe)?  she was the perfect mate for him - only seven of nine comes close...unfortunately, distance kept her and worf from ever meeting - what a glorious story line that would've made!  anyways, i understand the demands of tying up all the loose ends of such a fantastically complex series, however, it would have been so much more interesting to have had worf involved in the final battle bet. sisko and dukat.  worf should have lost his lifelong self control(a perfect follow-up to the explanation he once gave dax as to why he was so different from ""other klingons"") and spent all of season 7 tracking, no, hunting down dukat, out of vengeance - ultimately, even risking/losing his starfleet commission in the process.  then, he and dukat could have waged one hell of a battle on that cliff with sisko making the final kill.  this would have been in keeping w/ds9's exploration of the darkside of man's character, restored worf's honor, still kept the final outcome the same, and would have done justice to the one character(like 7 of 9 on voyager) who breathed much-needed new life into the series in season 4.
this is the only complaint i have for a wonderful series that finally showed what starships could do(great dominion war sequences!) yet, not at the expense of the best character development of all the series - for the most part.  here's hoping there is some way to bring this sinfully great series back, maybe 2-hr tv movies rather than theatrical releases?  ds9..rocks!",1070668800,2,2611,4.814317673378076
818009,4,6304209401,"bMost series go out like the roach in those old Raid commericals on their backs with legs sticking up in the air. DS9 was an exception to the rule. Pedigree is sometimes telling and, in the case of DS9, it was the grandson of a science fiction film classic; Roddenberry clearly based his characters and the situation of the original Star Trek on Forbidden Planet. Next Generation took that formula to the next level. DS9 was the first major departure from the formula--while it's set in Roddenberry's universe creators Michael Pillar and Rick Berman brought in a much darker element. It fit well.

Season 7 tied up most of the loose ends from the previous six years. As Executive Producer and writer Ira Steve Behr noted, DS9 evolved without any clear cut plan in mind beyond the current season. In many respects, that was the to the series' advantage. Jadzia Dax, Worf's wife and fellow officer, is murdered at the conclusion of season six and it appears that the evil spirits of the Pah-wraith have taken control. The Dominion looks like they will actually win the war and Gul Dukat, Sisko's doppleganger and foe,has over the course of seasons 6 and 7 gone completely insane.

Worf must deal with the loss of his mate and his world continues to crumble as the Dax symbiot returns as Ezri Dax (played by the marvelous and beautiful Nicole deBoer) bring back ghosts he'd thought he had put behind him. Sisko has returned to Earth taking a leave of absence from the Federation to work at his father's restaurant. Image In The Sand opens with Sisko trying to uncover the mystery of his mother's death and his visions. An attempt on his life makes him rethink his isolation from the world. Other strong episodes include After Image where Garak has massive anxiety attacks related to his role in helping the Federation overturn the Cardassian Empire. He feels like a traitor even though Cardassia is now just a pawn of the Dominion. Chrysalis focuses on Julian Bashir's love affair with another genetically enhanced individual who, until recently, was in something of a catatonic state. The best episode for me is Treachery, Faith and The Great River. Weyoun one of the genetically engineered overseers of the Jem H'adar betrays the Dominion. He gives information to the Federation in return for asylum. Evidently he's been judged defective and the Dominion has elected to terminate him and replace him with yet another clone.

Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges and Extreme Measures reintroduces Section 31 the secret cell that operates within the Federation. This secret organization will do anything, regardless of ethics or morality, to insure the Federation wins the war against the Dominion. Willian Sadler is superb as Sloan who tries to recruit Bashir in the former. In the latter episode, Bashir must enter the dying man's mind to find a cure for the wasting disease that was introduced to destroy the Founders (the leaders of the Dominion) by Section 31. It threatens the Founders and Odo who was used to introduce the disease to his people.

The grand finale is a marvelous two parter that doesn't provide complete resolution but, like the best novels, leaves enough loose ends to make the series interesting. I don't want to spoil it as there are a number of powerful surprises.

While season 7 didn't quite live up to seasons 4, 5 & 6 it was a strong send off for the series. Unlike The Next Generation (which I still love despite its flaws), on DS9 not everyone got along and the conflicts made the show that much more interesting. Oh, and if you purchase seasons 6 & 7 you'll get $20.00 back from Paramount (a similar promotion was used for Next Gen). A great series (not just a great Star Trek series)rode off into the sunset without ever looking back.",1067990400,83,3758,4.775384615384615
818082,5,6304209401,"Change was the theme for this season. The series was ending and the producers were determined to go out big.
The Founders and Cardassians would see their alliance fall apart. Gul Dukat would stoop to any level to control what he saw as his destiny. A new Dax would make her way to DS9. New leaders for the Cardassian and Klingon Empires. And, some of the most amazing space battles ever staged in Trek's long history.
An excellent ending to an excellent series.",1064534400,5,461,4.566265060240964
818083,3,6304209401,"It's a good thing that The Next Generation's Q is in this episode, because he single-handedly saves it from sinking.  Which is not to say that it's wonderful, or that it would have been utterly awful without him.  It's just that the whole story manages to balance out completely, making this what I would describe as a completely average episode.
In any case, the plot revolves around the omnipotent and all-powerful Q getting dumped by his human girlfriend because she's fed up with him.  In my (albeit limited) experience, there are only two kinds of Q episodes, and from the description, you can already see that this is a Goofy Q episode rather than a Q Threatens To Destroy All Of Humankind On An Idle Whim episode.  Once the crew realize that Q is on board, they prepare themselves for the worst, and although trouble does arrive, it isn't from the direction they were expecting.
There are too many parts of this episode where Important People spout Important Technobabble.  So, it's quite amusing to see Q blatantly taking the mickey out of this Star Trek clich (in fact, many of Q's jokes are meta-textual; presumably an omnipotent entity would realize that he's just a fictional character on a late twentieth century TV show).  The station is put in danger, and there's a race against time to save everyone's life.  There's even a countdown at the end, although it isn't terribly exciting.  There are some good jokes and sharp dialog in this one, which do make it more interesting than the average Stop The Station From Exploding episode.",1060041600,2,1547,4.7677902621722845
818084,5,6304209401,"The last season of the Trek spin-off is, without a doubt, its best. Avery Brooks and company go out in major style with the last seven episodes being some of the most intense and well-developed in television history.
Each of the eight series regulars (Brooks, Visitor, Siddig, Meany, Dorn, Auberjoinois, Shimmerman, and Lofton) gets a chance to shine in their respective roles, with newcomer Nichole deBoer doing her best as a replacement for the departed Terry Farrell. Recurring actors Marc Alamo, Casey Biggs, Penny Johnson, Jeffrey Combs and Oscar winner Louise Fletcher are featured prominently as their characters were essential to the show's denouement.
Special effects, while essential and impressive, take a backseat to the last season that is filled with surprising twists and turns, especially in an episode like ""Strange Bedfellows"".
For those that thought ""ST: The Next Generation"" was a little too sanitized, the political and religious overtures of ""Deep Space Nine"" make the latter a standout among the shows based on Roddenberry's original.",1059264000,8,1057,5.373493975903615
818085,5,6304209401,"Deep Space Nine's Seventh Season is basically a highlight reel. One show after another sparkles, there are plenty of twists, and, most importantly, the show ends so well. The final arc is truly amazing and makes us remember why we liked the show in the first place.
First off, there is a new Dax host in the last season. Nicole DeBoer plays Ezri Dax in the final season, taking over for Terry Farrell. I always liked the idea of having a new regular character come in before the end to mix things up, and there are a few good episodes devoted to her. ""Afterimage"" has Ezri trying to get her old friends to accept her; and ""Field of Fire"" has her enlisting the help of psychopath Joran Dax to catch a clever killer. It was in this episode where we learned how different she was to be from the previous Dax: her readiness to access the twisted Joran part of herself. Also, ""Prodigal Daughter"" explores her backstory.
All the characters receive a fitting coda. Sisko begins the season confused about his purpose, but wraps up the season fulfilling his destiny. Kira is promoted to Colonel, but finishes up the season as a freedom fighter once again, and ends up in command of the station. Worf has an eventful season, which includes depression after Jadzia's death, nonacceptance of Ezri leading to romance, as well as indignation at Gowron for his purely personal motives in the war. Julian has a couple of run-ins with Section 31 and overall becomes a wiser, more mature person. Garak ends up finally ending his exile, Quark still runs the bar, and Rom becomes the Grand Nagus. All in all, the denouement of the show was perfect.
Some of this season's highlights are ""Take me Out to the Holosuite"", a whimsical break from the war which pits Sisko against an academy nemesis in baseball, ""Once More Unto the Breach"" and ""The Siege of AR-558"", a pair of war stories, ""Treachery, Faith and the Great River"" with Weyoun defecting from the Dominion, ""It's Only a Paper Moon"" and ""Badda-Bing Badda-Bang"", both Vic Fontaine episodes, the first dealing with Rom's injury, the second is a tribute to heist films. The aforementioned ""Field of Fire"" is a great mystery story, but my favorite episode of the season is ""Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges"". This is the best Section 31 episode of all of them, a complicated morality play/spy story where nothing is as it seems. ""The Changing Face of Evil"" has more twists than Lombard Street, including Damar finally breaking off and starting his resistance movement. ""Tacking into the Wind"" finally has Gowron getting his just dessert, and ""What You Leave Behind"" concludes the series well by ending the Dominion war and having the characters go their separate ways.
It is easy to say that Season 7 is among the show's best. It is definitely worth purchasing.",1050969600,33,2789,4.728952772073922
818086,4,6304209401,"DS9's seventh and final season was, in some ways, its best. In addition to the long-overdue alliance between the Federation and both of its original series adversaries we see a Cardassian become a hero in the fight to liberate his people from the Dominion, which is wrapped up in an excellent series finale. My favorite episodes include ""Treachery, Faith, and the Great River,"" ""Once More unto the Breach,"" and ""It's Only a Paper Moon.""
In the first of these we see a ""defective"" Weyoun clone who questions the Dominion's policy of conquest and urges Odo to use his status as a Founder to change the Dominion into a more peaceful society. The scene between them is reminiscent of Kirk's parting message to the mirror-Spock in the original series, and in DS9's finale Odo does indeed honor Weyoun's request. In ""Once More unto the Breach"" we see Kor once again. After two episodes and who knows how many decades of feeling his best years are behind him he says, well you can guess what he says, and proves his worth in battle one last time.
Vic Fontaine really shines this season, particularly in ""Paper Moon"". He's sort of an unofficial counselor, much like Guinan was on Next Generation.
I didn't like the pah-wraith storyline that much. I think they could have found other ways for Dukat to cause trouble in the last season. As for Gowron, who started the Dominion War by invading Cardassia in the first place, he gets his comeuppance this season.
We also saw DS9's final mirror universe episode, ""The Emperor's New Cloak"". It's apparently a different quantum reality from the third season episode ""Through the Looking Glass,"" because in that episode we saw Alliance ships decloaking, and here the Alliance didn't have a cloaking device. While it may not have been the writers' intention, that's how it worked out. Watch the two eps back-to-back some time. It's the best way to explain the discrepancy.",1050278400,10,1904,4.825688073394495
818087,5,6304209401,"Season 7 of DS9 ran on so many cylinders that its speed and intensity were felt from the actors playing the roles to the viewers watching with eager smiles, frowns, and tears. It is too bad it had to end because it would have been great to see the repercussions of the Dominion war.
The continuing story lines are well crafted and the final strech drive has so many threads unwinding at once it reminds me of a TV equivilancy to Steaphen King's The Stand. It was outlined and executed very well; the writing staff did a wonderful job giving each story its deserved attention...thank you!
This show truly shines in the struggles that the characters go through and in the way that they fight with and for each other. The sence of family--which is what gives Star Trek its unwavering uniqness--is what really drives Deep Space Nine. We care for these people, because the people making the show cared. There is pride you feel from watching it, discussing it, you just know that something special has been created. And it has been. It fits in well with the ST universe, yet it stands at a distance from the rest of the franchise, due to the pain that our characters endure through a seven year story, and through the unresolved stories that pull us away from formulaic drama.
