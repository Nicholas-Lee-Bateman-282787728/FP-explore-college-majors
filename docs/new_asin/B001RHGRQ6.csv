3776256,5,B001RHGRQ6,"I have the first two season's . The video and sound on these are excellent, unlike a set I bought from eBay, poor sound and video. I watched these show's when they were first run on TV and they still are a joy to watch. Bring's back a much simpler time. I am looking forward for the forth and last season.",1246060800,,305,4.016393442622951
3776257,5,B001RHGRQ6,The Advenures of Robin Hood was one of my favorite shows. The quality of this set is very good and a lot shows for the money. I defintly recomend it.,1242604800,,149,4.0
3776258,5,B001RHGRQ6,"I contacted Mill Creek and they said the last season would be released at the end of 2009. I don't know what happens to the discs before the final season, after season three...maybe they will be out soon.
Anyway, a great show.
Did more research:
Alexander Gauge, who played Friar Tuck died in 1960 of an ""overdose"". He was 46.  Sad. Seems most of the actors died in the 1990's. But it's nice to know that their work will live on for years to come, thanks to DVD's.",1242000000,3,464,4.2727272727272725
3776259,5,B001RHGRQ6,When my husband and I were younger we enjoyed Robin Hood and always Richard Green. When we noticed that the old series was available through Amazon we decided to get as many seasons as was available and we have enjoyed them very much. The DVD's are clear and the price we paid for them reasonable. I purchased some from another source and have been very dissatisfied so will now stick to Amazon.,1241827200,,395,4.5
3776260,5,B001RHGRQ6,Great series I would highly recommend this to anyone.  Made back when shows were genuinely funny and entertaining.,1241395200,,114,5.333333333333333
3776261,5,B001RHGRQ6,"I hated when VHS replaced Beta but enjoied the price of vhs tapes.  When DVD took the place of VHS tapes I started to feel the same way till I saw how much a person can get of shows that are not on tv any more. Robin Hood with Richard Greene is one of these. I saw these shows when I was a kid  but saw very little of it after that. The first time I got to see it again was the peaced-togather shows on VHS of Robin Hood the Movie and Quest for the Crown. They were good in their own way but there is nothing like seeing the original episodes. I got the three seasons that Mill Creek put out and hope they put out the forth season soon. Mill Creek has done a good job on the DVD's from the picture to sound. There are no extras but that is not what I look for. I wish I could say it brings back memeries but all I can remenber is that I saw these shows and liked them then and that I still like seeing them now on DVD. If you think because it is in black & white it's not worth looking at you are missing out. The shows didn't stick to ""rob from the rich-give to the poor"" but took time to show the merry men having their own troubles. It didn't always show them singing,like the title song says, but it was always up beat. These DVD's are worth adding to any collecting. I also like the DVD sets because my daughter and granddaughters watch it with me and like the Adventures of Robin Hood.",1241308800,3,1391,3.9290780141843973
3776262,5,B001RHGRQ6,"Each season just gets better.  While a differant actress plays Maid Marion this season, she gets right into the role.  Fun to watch.",1240790400,,132,4.695652173913044
3776263,5,B001RHGRQ6,"I really like this series. There are 39 episodes for around $5-10. For the money you can't beat it. The English accents are entertaining. It's commercial-free. The theme song is great.

Cons: It's black and white cinematography. The plot is simple for each individual episode (we all know the main plot). Whoever produced the DVD did not put the episodes in the proper order (One character will die, and then appear for the very first time 3 episodes later).

There are over 100 episodes for the entire show, 39 per season.",1239408000,2,523,4.736263736263736

8338006,5,B001RHGRQ6,"I was able to purchase the first 3 seasons of the Adventures of Robin Hood for my parents. They are elderly and essentially housebound so watching the TV and DVDs is always their evening entertainment. They love this series. It is historically correct, exciting, and my mother thinks Richard Greene is incredibly handsome and a great, very athletic actor. My father prefers Maid Marion, telling me she looks just like my mother did in College. So...good actors we all can relate to (in our imaginations). I have seen the series myself and was impressed with the historical accuracy.",1388016000,,582,4.948979591836735
8338007,4,B001RHGRQ6,I have 3 in this series and I have enjoyed watching all of them.  I would recommend the series to anyone.,1363478400,,105,4.0
8338008,4,B001RHGRQ6,"The Robin Hood series for me and others who grew up in the 50's and early 60's is just a great rememberance of fun times.  The series today may seem a bit contrived or even hokey, but the ensemble cast with same members playing different parts from week to week was little noticed then.  If a colorized version was available, I would have given it 5 stars.  The ability of British cast to keep the often poor scripts, bad story ideas and direction interesting and often exciting is a tribute to their ability as actors.  Many came from Shakespearian theater and some went on to film work in England.  I recommend this series to those who love the Robin Saga, those who remember the 50's and 60's and anyone who are curious about television's early days.",1362873600,,753,4.507352941176471
8338009,5,B001RHGRQ6,great for the whole family and a good fill in but you can probably the four season set cheaper than as individual seasons added together.,1264982400,,137,4.52
8338010,5,B001RHGRQ6,Robin Hood's are just good old fashion shows! We have all the seasons and am sorry that there are no more.,1252195200,,106,4.095238095238095
