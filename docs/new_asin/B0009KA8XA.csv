8062711,5,B0009KA8XA,"This item contains seven Cosby Show episodes,three from Season 1,two from Season 2 and two from Season 3. At present,only the season 1 and season 2 episodes are available in complete season sets(released August 2,2005 and March 7,2006 respectively). In JITTERBUG BREAK from season 1,Dr. Cliff Huxtable(Bill Cosby) and his wife Clair(Phylicia Ayers-Allen,later Rashad) are prepared to go out for a night on the town with another couple but instead join the fun with their daughter Denise(Lisa Bonet) and her friends who are dancing. In RUDY'S SICK from season 1,the youngest Huxtable daughter,5-year-old Rudy(Keshia Knight Pulliam) battles a sore throat for real and pretends that her teddy bear Bobo is battling a fever. Cliff does a comedy act to ease Rudy's illness in the same fashion that Cosby himself does on stage. Get a load of him and Clair doing a mambo dance in that episode's final scene,which they'd do again in the season 3 opening montage. In FATHER'S DAY from season 1,the Huxtables celebrate Father's Day two weeks before Christmas! So Clair,Denise,Theo(Malcolm Jamal Warner),Vanessa(Tempest Bledsoe) and Rudy go to various stores in the shopping mall in search of Cliff's belated Father's Day gifts. In the season 2 premiere episode FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL,the Huxtable kids are off to school again. High school senior Denise had finally lost her teeth braces,Vanessa began middle school,Theo begins his high school sophomore year and Rudy enters first grade. Rudy was humiliated by an intimidating classmate who called her ""Rudy Huckleberry"". In the following(in the NBC series) episode THE JUICER,Cliff brings home his newly-purchased juicing machine,much to the disdain of Clair. So when Rudy and her white male friend Peter Chiara(Peter Costa,recurringly) crave peanut butter and jelly sandwiches,they unsuccessfully attempt to concoct grape jelly via concord grapes and the juicer without the mess prevention top cover intact! So the juice sprays all over the walls of the Huxtable kitchen(Rudy and Vanessa cleaned up the mess). The juicer still worked but Rudy thought she and Peter broke it. She confessed to Clair and then to Cliff,with persuasion from Clair. Clair,a legal aid attorney,plays judge and her real occupation and ""tries"" Cliff for allowing Rudy to operate the juicer without adult supervision. Cliff agrees to ""do life"",by never again purchasing,operating or visualizing household appliances! Season 3 brought CLIFF'S 50TH BIRTHDAY,which premiered in March 1987,four months before Cosby's 50th birthday. No Lena Horne though,like there was in the season 1 finale CLIFF'S(48th) BIRTHDAY. The other season 3 episode,CLIFF IN CHARGE is pretty cool,also.",1165363200,,2686,5.459134615384615
8062712,5,B0009KA8XA,"I practically grew on up on the Cosby Show.  It was part of my existence thru high school.  This is one of the few shows in history especially for people of color that week in and week out had a positive message.  I mean people scoffed at the idea of a prominent Afro-American family with parents who were doctors or lawyers as if this were not possible.  Again, the ideas were motivating.  You have got to own this not for the just the messages but for the humor in each as well.",1123459200,5,480,4.173913043478261
