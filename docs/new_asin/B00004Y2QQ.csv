1369939,5,B00004Y2QQ,"This is the first review I am writing for amazon because I want to praise a great collection.  Yes, there are many ""slice-of-life"" clips, that once you watch them, you may ask yourself: ""Why bother?""
 There are many reasons.  If you view films as merely an entertaining diversion at best, then this is not the set for you...  If you want to see different styles of filmmaking through different periods of history with differing motives, equipment, and budgets, then get ready for a great ride.  You are presented with amateurs, professionals, auteurs, and the casual filmmaker, but all of them took their craft seriously enough to warrant being included in this set.
 ""Rose Hobart"" is amazing.  ""Fall of the House of Usher"" is very innovative.  ""Hell's Hinges"" is one of the most straightforward portrayals of redemption I have ever seen with the greatest pre-John Wayne Western actor/director: William S. Hart. ""Battle of San Pietro"" is an interesting look at John Huston looking at war while making a government film.  The Groucho Marx home movie is fun.  The films which show life in the early part of the century are priceless.
 Laurence Fishburne's commentary on the archive houses is respectful and informative.  A fine choice to document the hard work and dedication of these restoration organizations.
 A Final Note, There is a film on this collection called ""Battery"" which is an experimental film melding line animation with photography, and it uses battery park and the world trade center as its backdrop.  The music for the film is very compelling, and the shots of an empty battery park with the twin towers appearing obfuscated by trees gave me goosebumps in this post 9/11 world.  A very compelling short film...",1027296000,,1727,4.968641114982578
1369940,4,B00004Y2QQ,"The ""Nation Film Preservation"" was founded back in 1997 and consists of 18 film archives from all around the US. This box set of 4 DVDs contains no less than 50 preserved films, most of them silent, but also rare documentaries, like a film about the ""Hindenburg"" (which let us take a peek into the airship's dining room and the cockpit, and we also learn that the ""Hindenburg"" needed 59 hrs. for an average flight from Frankfurt to New Jersey !).
There is a lot of of curious stuff like Groucho Marx's Home Movies (!) for example, or a very early version of ""Snow White from 1916 complete with green (!!) dwarfes, or an awafully dated William S.Hart western called ""Hell's Hinges"" (which was co-directed by its star !).
But its not all like that. ""Treasures"" also contains some utterly important films, like Scott Bartlett's pioneering avantgarde film ""OffOn"", and a short documentary called ""The Wall"" (about the building of the Berlin wall), which was never before seen in the US, or Joseph Cornell's wonderful, but also very rarely shown ""Rose Hobart"" (the great, great grandfather of the video clip !).
This set comes along with a 150 page booklet, in which you can research all the informations you need about the preserved films (you can also switch to the DVD menue for a narrated presentation of each one of the film archives.). It contains also notes about film preservation itself, as well as information about the musical accompaniments. And there we have the only flaw of the entire set: the muscial accompaniments of the silent pictures !
They are consisting only of piano music, which is, by any means, not very varied and at times terribly boring.
But that's just really one little weak spot in an almost perfect and tremendous project.
""Treasures from American Film Archives"" is a great collection of forgotten silver and recommended mainly to those who are interested in film history. So appreciate it, buy it and love it !",1002585600,,1940,4.794029850746269
1369941,3,B00004Y2QQ,"This is a somewhat risky set to buy. Of the twelve or so hours available, I find very little to recommend to anyone. Guests at my place see the set and have my initial reaction (that being ""wow,"" or something like that), and are ultimately let down. Things like, ""That's it?"" The dry booklet that accompanies the set does't help alleviate things, either. I wathced and wathced, have found a few pieces that I adore, but regret that I spent so much for them.",1001894400,,457,4.4523809523809526
1369942,5,B00004Y2QQ,"I bought this for my mother for mother's day. She loved it. My mommy wouldn't get off the couch for a several nights. I saw bits and pieces of the films too, and they WERE beautifully remastered, and were also very interesting. The soundtracks were also very well done. This movie set leaves me asking, ""Where's my mommy?"" whenever she watches it, because she seems quite intrigued with it.",994204800,,390,4.666666666666667

1369944,5,B00004Y2QQ,"The majority of this deluxe boxed set is devoted to early silent films.  I do not consider myself a particular fan of silent films, and yet most of these I found to be wonderful.  While the four feature films were fine, I especially enjoyed the shorts, which commonly consider everyday life at the turn of the century.  These silents have a spirit of joy and excitement, and a genuine sincerity, that I've never seen in film before. With only a few exceptions, these silents are in an excellent state of preservation, often offering an amazingly clear window on the past. The main exception is an early version of ""Snow White,"" the one that inspired the famous Disney version. All copies were once believed lost; however, a below-average quality but still quite watchable print was found only a few years ago. The musical accompaniment, custom produced for these DVDs, adds immeasurably to the experience. These silents are highly recommended to anyone interested in the history of film or history in general.  I am unaware of any other source of silent shorts on DVD, certainly not of this quality or extent.
Besides the silents, the set also offers several other categories of films, including those produced for the government, commercial and promotional films, home movies, and art shorts.  These are generally oldish but not antique, none more recent than 1985.  The offerings in the last three categories are generally weak.  The art shorts, especially, with their emphasis on the abstract and modern, had little appeal for me.  Even though many of them are relatively recent, they have been rarely shown, and with good reason. The big surprise is the quality of the government films, especially ""The Battle of San Pietro,"" directed by John Huston, a true work of art, and one of the finest pieces in the set.  Even ""We Work Again,"" with its tiresome script intended to convince blacks of the benefits of government assistance during the depression, features beautiful cinematography, unfortunately uncredited, and ends with four minutes from a famous Orson Welle's adaptation of a Shakespeare play, of which no other footage exists.
Each disc is arranged in roughly chronological order, taking viewers on four trips through time, from the 1890's to the modern age.  The set includes a  130 page booklet describing each film; these descriptions also appear on the DVDs themselves.  The menus on the DVDs are professional, attractive, and easy-to-navigate.  The transfers to DVD are excellent, with no digital artifacts that I could see.
This set could easily have been dry and academic. Instead, at its best, it's extremely moving, entertaining, and expressive of the past.  The commentary could have condemned the past in light of today's viewpoints and ideologies; instead, with unexpectedly rare exceptions, its fair and informative. This set should have broad appeal for those willing to adjust to the limitations of early film technology.  Overall, I cannot recommend this set highly enough.",975283200,,3002,5.122950819672131
1369945,5,B00004Y2QQ,"Just to correct the misimpression in Christoph Berner's review below: The ""Treasures from American Film Archives"" DVD set is NOT region encoded.  That was just an Amazon error.  It can be played in all ""regions.""

1369946,5,B00004Y2QQ,"Well, for a silent film fan this content must be truly exciting. But for no good reason the DVD was released with a Region 1 encoding, virtually ignoring DVD viewers in Europe, who aren`t so lucky with silent films released on DVD (at least the BFI is  starting now). If the major film industry doesn't have the forsight for a multi-region DVD, at least distributors of silent films could be less ignorant (alas, MCA Universal or Sony Pictures sell 100.000 of copies of their blockbusters, but the market for silent films is small enough, so why a region 1 encoding, ignoring all foreign customers ????!!!!!!)

1369947,5,B00004Y2QQ,"In my opinion, this is the single greatest group of items ever restored and made available to the American public. For years many companies, such as Kino, Milestone, and Zeitgeist, have been restoring and making some of the greatest features and shorts available to new generations of film viewers. This new collection spans the galaxy, covering all kinds of films which have been impossible to see on video - or in any other way. Hollywood has always been mined for its masterpieces, especially since cable tv exploded. Now, traveling the entire vast country, gems from little known collections such as the Minnesota Historical Society and West Virginia's Archives and History collection will be made available to millions of people who never knew they existed. As a film exhibitor, librarian, restorer, critic, etc. for almost 30 years, I would give this collection SIX STARS as the single greatest gift ever from America's film archives to its citizens.",970963200,,956,5.134615384615385

7926402,5,B00004Y2QQ,"Quite innovative and a milestone DVD release in 2000 it is still a marvel in 2014.
Even though some of this has become YouTube fodder, there is noting like the quality of these transfers.
The beauty of 35mm film when properly transferred will make a viewing of these films seem like new no matter how many times you may have stumbled over them by now.
Those first Edisons look spectacular here.  There are 4 features in the set and one is in beautiful 2 strip Technicolor.
Every wonder what would happen if Groucho were to direct a silent film?  Wonder no more as there is one of his home movies here that he obviously planned out and shot with his family.
Then there is the ultra creepy 1928 surreal FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER in pristine quality.  So much more.  Even some good cartoons!!",1408752000,,790,4.427586206896552

The words ""Encore Edition"" appear on the right front cover of the box, above the fourth Lincoln.

The difference is that the original edition came with a 130 page softcover book;
Each of the 4 DVDs in the ""Encore Edition"" comes with its own booklet (26 to 30 pages).
Content is identical to the original.

Volumes 1-3 are alarmingly expensive.
Shop around - I found some bargains on Ebay.
I hope all three will be reissued someday, but I don't have any inside information.

Volumes 4-6 are more reasonably priced.

Volumes 3, 4 and 5 were logically assembled around a common theme.
The others are jumbles of unrelated stuff.
Messy, but fun.

Volume 3 ""Social Issues in American Film"" looks interesting (it includes some early gangster movies), but it's the hardest to find.

Volume 5 ""The West"" is a real bargain, and a good place to start.

Volume 4 ""Avant-Garde Film"" doesn't appeal to me at all.
Too artsy.",1405036800,,2994,8.57556270096463
7926404,1,B00004Y2QQ,"The title misrepresents the contents because the material selected for the most part are not treasures. This a collection where the criteria for selection seems to have been half based on politics and half based on novelty. On the first criteria, you can almost see the checklist of boxes those who assembled the film worked with. Each catagory was expected one (and only one) film regardless of quality or meaning. In the second catagory, there is no end of third-rate amature work. We get experiments, we get lots of home movies, we get a quite frankly offensive paternalistic Orsen Wells theater piece from the 1930s, we get wartime junk and we get new deal junk.

Its not to say that these films are not of some interest. If took half the films and called it a cross-section of ethnic america as shown historically in film, it would be valid. If you took another half and called it the first home movies, that would work too.

But these are NOT treasures of film. I've given it one star not so much for the contents, but for the process that assembled the collection and marketed it as treasures.",1226793600,,1100,4.607142857142857
7926405,4,B00004Y2QQ,"This original set of films from the American Film Archives is interesting to students of cinema history and history in general, but it is not that entertaining in the ordinary sense. The first set I bought, ""More Treasures from the American Film Archives"" seemed to do a better job of mixing pure entertainment with films that had a social or historical  significance than this one. That set included one or two silent feature films including an early Ernst Lubitsch, a Rin Tin Tin silent, and a very early gangster film, on each DVD along with the short subjects. That being said, this is a unique and interesting set of films that I found very worthwhile. However, if you are uncertain, start with the ""More Treasures from the American Film Archives"" set first. If you don't like that set I am almost sure you will not like this one. Nobody else bothered to list all of the films on this set and their descriptions, so I do that next:

7926407,4,B00004Y2QQ,"This collection of 50 preserved films spanning 75 years of film history aptly shows the value of film preservation, and enables fans of film to support preservation by purchasing this collection. There are four classes of film in this box: early commercial films by famous or obscure studios and film makers; amateur films, including sentimental glimpses of a region of the US (rural Minnesota, West Virginia, Maine), news reels or other documentaries, and avant-garde or experimental films. There's something for everyone who likes old movies, but it's only the most committed fanatic of the film medium who will find everything here of equal interest.

The most universally appealing in this box are films with stories that combine the potential to appeal to the modern viewer with a glimpse into the imagination of film pioneers who were defining conventions in technique that are standard today. In this category we include The Lonedale Operator, a Biograph gem from 1911  directed by D.W. Griffith, advanced for its time in editing, story-telling and character development; The Land Beyond the Sunset, an Edison one-reeler from 1912 that shows how far film directors had mastered the ability to squeeze the right amount of story into seven minutes; and Hell's Hinges, an entertaining 1916 Western feature starring W. S Hart in a role that presages the work of Gary Cooper in High Noon and Clint Eastwood in The Unforgiven. There are also historically interesting films like a newsreel ""year in review""  of 1934 (a tough year!) and a one-reeler called The Confederate Ironclad, which was, we learn. one of many movies made during the 50 year anniversary of the Civil War. Finally, there's The Toll of the Sea an  early technicolor vehicle with a very powerful performance by 17 year old Anna May Wong, albeit in a rather crude reworking of the Madame Butterfly story.

Pretty much the remainder of this collection is of historical or cultural interest. There's a version of Snow White from 1916 that was alleged to have inspired Walt Disney as a youth; a remarkable, but short, home movie from 1933 of Groucho Marx and his family at home, a brief excerpt from Marian Anderson's historic 1939 Easter Sunday concert on the mall in DC, an amateur movie of the Negro Baseball League in action, and Joseph Cornell's 1936 surrealistic ""re-mixing"" of a B jungle movie into a faintly erotic fixation on its female star ""Rose Hobart"", a movie Salvador Dali allegedly flipped over.

I personally liked volume two of this collection (""More treasures"") better than this one -- it focused more on important, forgotten commercial films and less on the amateur or the avant garde. But the highlights of volume one make it, and its companion, treasures to own indeed.",1122249600,,2755,5.004366812227074

Most of the items in these eleven plus hours are passably interesting, and several are more than that. Still, the label ""treasures"" suggests a qualitative richness that simply isn't there, for the good reason that the selection criteria were obviously political, not aesthetic.
By ""political"" I mean that the goal clearly was to demonstrate the breadth (or, if you must, the ""diversity"") of American film culture, rather than presenting the best the participating archives had in their collections. So we get standard narratives, experimental shorts, home movies, propaganda, ethnic cinema, records of theatrical performances and documentaries, but what we for the most part do not get is a collection of outstanding films. You can practically feel the politically correct clerks checking off their demographic lists to be certain the collection is ""inclusive."" The bland results are the perfect bureaucratic solution: the discs won't offend anyone.
Some of the films are more famous than others, such as D.W. Griffith's short ""The Lonedale Operator"" or John Huston's ""The Battle of San Pietro."" Even these are not necessarily the filmmakers' best work, however, although it is nice to have copies of them for analytical purposes. The less well-known works vary widely in quality and interest. Many seem to have been included just because they are ""rare."" Rarity does not necessarily imply value, however. (Maybe I should apply for a National Endowment of the Arts grant to preserve *my* home movies.)
The navigation is simple, devoid of the gimmicks that can make DVDs more obnoxious than entertaining. With one major exception, the discs are well-produced and handsomely packaged. That exception is the musical accompaniment to most of the films. In small doses, it's passable, but if you watch more than a couple of the films at a time, the impersonal clackety-clack of the solo piano is enough to drive you mad. It makes Techno seem like Verdi by comparison.",1052611200,,2138,5.218023255813954
