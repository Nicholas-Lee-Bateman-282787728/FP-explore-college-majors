2470117,5,B000CQQIV2,If you don't laugh at this DVD I don't know what would make you laugh. Hilarity ensues when Phyllis takes off. I was gasping with laughter when she tears into her mother-in-law. Phyllis Diller will NEVER be forgotten.,1361059200,,217,4.7368421052631575

2470120,2,B000CQQIV2,"We were looking forward to receiving Phyllis Diller Dvd, we were very disappointed ,we have just finished watching Bill Cosby compared to him she is an amatuer in jokes and putting them over we felt she was waiting for a laugh it has really put us off buying another one",1231891200,,270,4.42
2470121,5,B000CQQIV2,"This is Phyllis Diller as you would see her in Las Vegas.  Some of the material here would not have been allowed on regular television, but instead was shown on HBO in its earliest years.  Phyllis includes many of her classic topics in this broadcast including her ""husband"" Fang, her cooking and housekeeping skills.  Some of the material may not be considered as risque now, but it was back in the mid-1970's for sure.  Phyllis also gives us a real treat by playing the piano.

I'd recommend this video to anyone who's ever enjoyed Phyllis Diller on television and in the movies.",1178409600,11,581,4.6568627450980395
2470122,5,B000CQQIV2,"If you like good Comedy, and you LOVE Phyllis Diller, this is for you. To be honest I didn't realize this was an HBO SRO (Standing Room Only - Remember that from the 70's?) production in Denver. I also didn't expect the video and sound quality to be as clear and amazing as it is. Phyllis gives a short biographical introduction, then its on with the show! I have personally seen Phyllis twice and let me tell you, this DVD caused me to laugh just as hard, if not harder than my two previous live experiences. This is something for you comedy buffs, a must for a classic collection with comedy. And a note to Phyllis: Thanks for all the laughs!",1168300800,18,644,4.330578512396694

8100659,4,B000CQQIV2,It is great that this HBO special was recorded.  It is a very basic product; it is great to have a record of the culture of the time.  Our common vernacular has significantly changed.  Ms. Diller was a significant voice in the evolution of women in comedy.  This is a good first source research document.,1396224000,,304,4.472727272727273
8100660,5,B000CQQIV2,Because she's the queen of comedy setting  the standards for all women in comedy. Long live Phyllis Diller! She rocks.,1389916800,,118,4.9
8100661,4,B000CQQIV2,The DVD was well done & I m still enjoying it. I would highly reccommend it to any who likes Phylliis Diller.,1364169600,,109,4.0
8100662,5,B000CQQIV2,"Phyllis Diller was a pioneer as a stand up comic during a time when the industry was completely dominated by men: Bob Newhart, Shelley Berman, Mort Saul, Lenny Bruce; it would be decades before another woman took the stage. Diller started as a comic at the age of 37. she uses funny self depricating humor and has a remarkable laugh that is enouggh to make you laugh without the joke. Phillis Diller died a year and a half ago.

""We had a little grease fie in the kitchen. People have them all the time."" She draws heavily from her cigarette holder. Then tosses her head back and laughs. ""Mine was in the sink.""

""My sink is so greasy I have watched bugs slide to their death.""

""But I've figured out what to do with that god-awful left over sauerkrat. Of course this omly works in Decemeber: Silver it and hang it on the tree."" Again, the laugh. ""It stinks, but it's beautiful.""

Everyone needs to see Phyllis Diller as a stand up and this is the only DVD I've found. She has performed in films, if you have her albums from the 50's and 60's and a player you can hear her that way, but this DVD is priceless because it recpords the most important woman in comedy history (I place her above Fanny Brice and Gracie Allen) By owning it I feel as though I will never lose an important part of our comedy history.

This peformance was filmed in Denver in the 1970's (she makes a joke about the President losing three teeth to exposure) but is just as fresh today. There is no filth. Her ""fake"" relationships exist just to make fun of, though she will always laugh at her own expense. At the age of abnout 65 then she was tinhy and frail.""For Halloween I went with a white fur hat and white fur boots."" She looks around for a minute. ""I went as a Q-Tip""

She plays the piano for us twice and the woman klicks butt. She reminded me of Billy Joel. She has a second pianst with her though she doesn;t need him. The music is serious but like Bette Midler, she gets up and has us laughing with hysterics.

You need to buy this DVD.",1363824000,,2021,4.261096605744125
