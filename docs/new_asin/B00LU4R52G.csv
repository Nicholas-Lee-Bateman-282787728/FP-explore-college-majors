6506649,4,B00LU4R52G,"Bigfoot Roadtrip is a fun dvd.  It was designed to be family friendly (puppets and silliness throughout) while keeping the credibility and fact-centered information the focus of the road trip.  While I would have enjoyed it more without the goofy puppet humor, I really enjoyed the new information Cliff Barackman presented regarding the organization that utilizes the best tree cams, strategically placed, whose mission is to verify bigfoot existence.  I really believe they may be one of the best hopes of catching credible and hopefully clear photographs.  I also enjoyed the new stories from non-glory-seeking individuals who shared their experiences.  I recommend this dvd for the sheer sake of Cliff Barackman alone!! He is serious and passionate about finding evidence and answering questions we all have about this phenomenal creature.  I love the thing he did with counting the pixels in the bigfoot tree cam pic and comparing it to the pic of himself standing in the same place.  He's the real deal and I love his hokey, silly side too.  Jeff Meldrum, Bobo James Fay, Bob Gimlin, and other big names in the bigfoot world appear in this dvd as well.  It's a fun watch!!",1407369600,10,1178,4.969387755102041
6506660,4,B00LU4R52G,"If you like Cliff Barackman on Finding Bigfoot, then you'll like Bigfoot Roadtrip as long as you set your expectations correctly.  BF Roadtrip is a cross between a cheesy home movie, lighthearted documentary, and Mystery Science Theater 3000.  The first 10 minutes are a little rough to get through as it introduces Cliff Barackman and his friend Craig Flipy.  Craig Flipy describes himself as a king of weirdos and certainly lives up to that in his part of the introduction.  It's okay. It gets better.

They do their own expedition at Mount St. Helens.  They review a cast a family have.  They have a big campout in the Olympic Mountains and you see James ""Bobo"" Fey, his dog Monkey, and Bob Gimlim.  If you've watched Finding Bigfoot you're familiar with all these names.  The Clackamas River photo is where Cliff goes into his science mood.  He explains what he thinks he's seeing and how he's coming to that conclusion.  Cliff used to be a teacher and you feel it most in this segment as he leads you through a photo analysis lesson.

If you're looking for a serious documentary this isn't one.  If you're looking for a behind the scenes expose of Finding Bigfoot, this isn't one.  If you can accept some offbeat humor and family friendly fun this Bigfoot Roadtrip is pretty good.",1457395200,,1285,4.678571428571429
6506661,3,B00LU4R52G,My girlfriend loved it but I thought it was cheesy. I love Cliff on Finding Bigfoot but he would have been better by himself on this project.,1457308800,,141,4.2592592592592595
6506662,5,B00LU4R52G,"Highly recommended.  This light-hearted documentary rates in the top Bigfoot productions and we have seen a lot of them.  We rented it and it was worth the money, for sure!  The witness stories and the London Trackway footage were especially memorable.  Thank you, Cliff and Craig, for the good film making and fun use of puppets.  Please consider making sequels - you are a good team.",1453593600,,385,4.7727272727272725
6506663,5,B00LU4R52G,Cliff Barackman shares his knowledge of and his enthusiasm for all things sasquatch in this funny and campy film.  Thoroughly enjoyed!,1453507200,,134,5.380952380952381
6506664,2,B00LU4R52G,Finding Bigfoot is a pretty dumb show.  But its fun.  Knock 50 IQ points off a Finding Bigfoot episode and you get this.  Didn't even finish it.,1452729600,,144,4.2592592592592595
6506665,3,B00LU4R52G,"I rented it and watched it. It was okay for a few laughs and Cliffy knows about and collects bigfoot footprints; in that respect he knows a thing or two them. He is wise that way.
The movie was okay to watch, (you might reserve it for adults as kids might get kind of bored with it).  Otherwise, it's okay as a family item. O=I cannot for the life of me, remember if it has bad language in it but I suspect that Cliffy would not support anything with his name on it as a thing of distaste ( no cursing anyone). as he works around kids all the time. He's a school teacher. I just don't know what age his students are.

Good show.",1452038400,,628,4.016

6506683,3,B00LU4R52G,"Cliff Barackman makes this video literally worth watching, if you can get past the lame attempts at humor spread throughout this work,so what does the goofy sidekick and puppet work contribute other than lame humor?

6506689,5,B00LU4R52G,"The Bigfoot Roadtrip DVD is a blast on multiple levels. The zany first part is obviously geared to make kids (and non-uptight adults) laugh. Another entertaining aspect is seeing Cliff Barackman be as funny and quirky as he wants to be and not just what we are shown on TV on Finding Bigfoot. There are other cool aspects, such as meeting other bigfoot experts and witnesses, but the real hard-core science content and evidence was amazing. If you have a real interest/fascination/obsession for the subject, then Bigfoot Roadtrip is a MUST-SEE!",1426291200,,544,4.989010989010989

6506711,5,B00LU4R52G,"This show started off campy and I thought, ""Oh no, what did I just buy?"" However, after the slow and silly beginning the show picks up speed and gets into some good investigations into the ever illusive and forever shy Big Foot. I really enjoyed watching it and I liked the way the Host Cliff Barackman takes us for a ride-along into his world of Big Foot investigations.",1425945600,,371,4.470588235294118
6506712,1,B00LU4R52G,"Very disappointing. Don't try to disguise some silliness as a real research documentary.
If you are under 10 or buying this for preteens the go ahead...they might get something out of the content.  Unless you are a very immature adult I'd advise a pass.

6506714,2,B00LU4R52G,"Well if anyone could get you to think that Finding Bigfoot on a Roadtrip was mostly about having a good time and casting doubt about the whole topic, Cliff Barackman has succeeded. Except for the last 20 minutes, this video adds nothing new to the search for Bigfoot. In more ways it turns the whole topic into a comedy sketch. Remember when the former Governor of Arizona held a press conference and introduced an alien to the public to explain the Phoenix lights in 1997. That's what this video does for the topic of discovering if Bigfoots are real and the possible missing link in the evolution of humankind. Save your money until it comes out in Prime.",1424304000,,657,4.576271186440678

This movie, however, was sooo much stranger than I expected!! It is a very low quality film and Cliff and his friend act ridiculous the whole time. I would never have pictured this side of Cliff! It's still worth renting I guess since Cliff is involved and there are some interesting Bigfoot stories included but I was kind of disappointed with this film and I don't even think I finished it. The other guy in the movie is so strange!!! I dunno guys, it's almost worth renting just to see what I mean for yourself! So weird!!",1420243200,,668,4.528925619834711

6506725,5,B00LU4R52G,"In between a comedy (use of puppets and some silliness) and documenting Bigfooting, talking to people about Bigfoot, lots of great nature locations.  What's not to love?  Good entertainment for the whole family and educational.  Love that you get to see stuff that would have been cut out of a TV show.  Bought a second copy and sent it to a friend.  No it wasn't done by a big studio, and it shows occasionally but I wouldn't hesitate to buy a sequel if they make one.",1416700800,,469,4.406976744186046

6506727,5,B00LU4R52G,"""Bigfoot Roadtrip"" is, as the oldsters say, a total freakin' hoot!  Okay, maybe that's a hybrid of oldster and newster, but either way it is definitely fun.  Our whole family has watched it through a few times now, and while it is very informative, as you'd expect from Cliff Barackman, official field researcher for Animal Planet's ""Finding Bigfoot,"" it is something that most bigfoot documentaries are not, and we've viewed most of them: This one is ENTERTAINING!  And co-host Craig Flipy is surprisingly charismatic with a dry wit, a funny foil to Barackman's straight man.

""Bigfoot Roadtrip"" begs to be a spinoff of ""Finding Bigfoot"" albeit for a slightly different demographic.  It is more family-friendly, more child-friendly, and more lighthearted... Suffice it to say, if you find bigfooting interesting and you enjoy a good laugh, then ""Bigfoot Roadtrip"" is a must-rent if not a purchase.  Our whole clan is glad we own it, and our third viewing won't be our last.

P.S.  I've got one last word for this review that came as a great surprise: P-U-P-P-E-T-S!",1416700800,2,1066,4.983050847457627

The main thing I liked about it was that it talked about different bigfoot reports/encounters/castings that I had never heard of before.

Cliff is not trying to convince the viewer that BF exists, he knows they do. He documents the discover of the largest footprint trackway and later casting of those footprints.

I was honored to have these boys on my Bigfoot webcast and I am looking forward to their future videos. Sorry Cliff, but you need to leave the puppetry to Todd Standing (joke).

For example, Cliff spent time analyzing a photo of what is possibly a bigfoot and why he thought that, based on measurement analysis, is a bigfoot.  He also had an interesting discussion about footprint casts, specifically the London casts, with Dr. Jeff Meldrum.  At the very least rent it.  Im adding it to my collection.

Cliff shows us a side of himself not prompted or edited beyond recognition by network t.v. and I for one believe that works to his benefit. I purchased my copy from Cliff himself and you can tell it excites him that he got to reveal his inner madman in this film. His buddy Craig is a good laugh too. It has puppets and hijinks. It has some guest appearances by many big names within the bigfoot community. It's a good, fun time. As a guy who enjoys roadtrips and the bigfoot mystery, I suggest you pick up your copy today.",1507939200,,909,4.870967741935484

8668139,4,B00LU4R52G,"I enjoyed the interview with Dr. Meldrum and Cliff's solo parts. However, the goofy guy who was filming was a little much, probably because I am 60 and he is in his 20s?? That's okay, they were having fun. Husband and I do a lot of BF searching, since the 70s when he had first encounter. I saw my first BF in 2013. Pretty impressive!!
Thanks!",1464825600,,343,4.212121212121212
