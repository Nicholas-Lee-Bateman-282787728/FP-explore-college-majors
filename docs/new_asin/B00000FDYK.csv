7908462,5,B00000FDYK,"I LOVED THIS VIOLENT RAPE STORY WITH A JUSTICE SERVED ENDING. I TRIED TO PURCHASE OR RENT THE TAPE FOR YEARS, BUT WAS UNABLE TO FIND IT. ONE DAY I FOUND A LIST OF MOVIES THAT HAD BEEN RELEASED IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS UNDER DIFFERENT TITLES. THIS MOVIE WAS ON THE LIST AS HAVING BEEN RELEASED UNDER THE NAME ""SUNDAY IN THE COUNTRY"". THAT IS WHEN I BOUGHT IT. IT IS THE SAME DISTURBING STORY THAT I ENJOYED THE FIRST TIME. THE THRILL OF FINDING THE MOVIE AFTER A LONG SEARCH MAKES IT SPECIAL TO ME.",1330905600,,495,4.221052631578948
