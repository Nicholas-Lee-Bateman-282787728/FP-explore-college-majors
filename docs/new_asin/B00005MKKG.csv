7945657,4,B00005MKKG,"This is an excellent film on the main sites of ancient Egypt with beautiful photography. An interesting feature is the computerized reconstruction of what the pyramids, statues, temples, etc. may have looked like originally in all their colorful glory. I especially enjoyed the version of the Sphinx with a full face for a change!

But the best part of this DVD is the bonus program ""Touring Egypt"" which shows places and sites not generally shown in other documentaries. They actually filmed inside the Cairo Museum (in '05 you could not take a camera inside the museum) as well as some great shots inside tombs in the Valley of the Kings in Luxor (again, no cameras allowed during my '05 trip). Also shown are the temples at Dendara and Abydos which are not usually featured and I did not visit but now will on my next trip.

Anyone fascinated by Egypt will enjoy this DVD. Information above shows the release date as '02 but I believe the film is much earlier.",1223683200,2,963,4.658823529411765

Disappointing that only AMC seems to have access to the restored widescreen version and such is not yet released on DVD.",1011571200,3,312,5.24
