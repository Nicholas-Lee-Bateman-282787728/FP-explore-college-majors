7882118,5,6305049025,"(make that the ""first"" SST)

Even though this documentary was made over 10 years ago, it is STILL a fascinating expose' into the Cold War era battle for the supersonic air transport market of the late 60s/early 70s...which (as it eventually turned out) didn't really exist to begin with!  This program is the perfect companion piece to the documentary NOVA did on the Concorde, which aired about 4 years following this one.  If you're a fan of all things ""fast aircraft"", you've found exactly what you're looking for.",1294704000,,517,4.8522727272727275
7882119,5,6305049025,"This movie is an unbelievable piece of history concerning the Cold War, technological achievement and competition between nations gone bad.  I remember hearing sonic booms while growing up in Ohio but I had no idea about the Konkordski tragedy until this film (and I'm not revealing it here!).  I nearly fell off my seat when they showed the actual footage.  This Nova film is more than educational.  The suspense, international deception and shocking footage from the France Air Show could compete with a Hollywood movie.",1200182400,,522,5.105882352941176
