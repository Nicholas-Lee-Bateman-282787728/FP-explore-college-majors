1707086,5,B000065AYY,"Do yourself a favor, get this DVD.  This is my first time purchasing a gospel DVD, I usually purchase videos...and it was well worth the price.  I also bought the CD and that is awesome!
I went to the concert in March in Baltimore and they said the CD and DVD were coming out at the end of April and I put it on my list to buy.
Songs like Running Back to You, Hold Me, You Keep on Blessing, etc. are awesome. Hook it up with your speakers and you will hear the phenomenal harmonies and ministry of men who are ""Commissioned"" to spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  They may not have ""cross over"" appeal, but as Fred Hammond says, ""We carry the cross-over,"" but I digress...
Enough of this, I have to go watch the DVD again and be blessed!",1019779200,,737,4.13986013986014

If you have never heard of Commissioned before you just might want to give ths video a chance. If you do know about Commissioned, than you already know to get a grip cause you are about to enjoy yourself.
This video packed with the hottest live performance that you'll probably ever see. They will make you want to dance, worship, and even rewind some parts (believe I know).

1707106,5,B000065AYY,"Commissioned * Commissioned Reunion (Verity, 2002) Produced by Fred Hammond

If you've been a regular Commissioned fan throughout all time and seasons, then you've come to expect that ordinary just won't do. That they have an irreplaceable love for what they do and ... This is a really tight project.

But first, the bad news ... Michael Brooks and Maxx Frank --now pastors-- were not able to participate at this live recording in October 2001. Eddie Howard and Chris Poole are not here. Allegedly, Montrel Darrett wasn't asked to participate. Also absent are prominent supporting artists like Dawkins & Dawkins, Mike E, Parkes Stewart, Witness and the list goes on. However, the original voices are here, as well as Marvin Sapp and Marcus Cole (who at times, reminds you of Montrel Darrett) ... And this brings us to another great flaw of this project.

In the midst of Jazzy/Funky re-interpretations of classic songs and dazzling harmonies that astound, Marcus and Marvin are sort of left hanging --Marcus moreso than Marvin. Yes, he is included on many of the tunes, often taking some of Keith Staten's old ad-libs and refashioning them. However, none of his compositions are included on this 2CD set, nor are any of the songs from the group's 1996 album, ""Irreplaceable Love"" --which was so good that it landed a coveted spot on the BEST BUY store chains' listening stations with a glowing review. This is a pity, since some of Marvin Sapp's best performances were on the ""IL"".

See, I'm glad that the old gang came back together, but with RFC on backing vocals and ""non-Commissioned"" musicians playing ... As great as this project sounds and as much as it will minister to all that listen ... For die-hard fans who've been there from ""I'm Goin' On"" all the way to the present ... It's just another episode of ""The Fred Hammond Show"".

I've been a Commissioned fan for approx. 15 years, and now my daughter who is 5 yrs old is also a hugh fan who knows all of their songs.  The Lord has truly GIFTED these men with incredible talent, and I'm happy that they decided to share their AWESOME talent with the world again.

I would also recommend the Reunion CD, which I just purchased 3 days ago.

May the Lord continue to bless!

1707109,5,B000065AYY,"I went to this concert when it came to Virginia.  It was so good.  It was nice to see Commissioned together again, and the music was more than amazing.

I bought the video back then but played it so much that it was ruined.  I finally ordered the DVD and I am so glad I did.",1168560000,,274,3.8392857142857144
1707110,5,B000065AYY,"I know I have a very busy life. But how in the world I was SOOOO busy that I completely missed in 2002 ""The Commissioned Reunion Live"" DVD is totally beyond me, since it is one of my favorite gospel groups!

I ""just discovered"" it earlier this year on some musical list and mentioned it to my musical brother, who simply said GET IT! I did in February through Netflix and listened for the first few minutes while I was working on writing my midterm exams. I knew from the first couple cuts, I would not be able to write the exams and listen too, because I was TOO into the music to concentrate on the exams. So I turned it off and vowed to watch it straight through for the full 2 hours and 2 minutes ""when I had time.""

I FOUND the time just last week, and I have not ceased playing this DVD over and over and over again since then! What a musical masterpiece! If you are a Commissioned fan, this is a MUST have for your collection!! It contains practically EVERY hit song they ever sang - fast and slow. The first 18 minutes is a non-stop, praise dancing jewel, which also is now my new workout tape, since I have recommitted myself to get fit again!. You WILL be motivated to get up and move! The drummers and horn section are slamming, and the harmonies are as beautiful or more so from the originals. Also, they look like they just had a lot of fun being back together again.

For me, the music brings back fond memories of God's faithfulness to me during my master's and doctoral years, which Commissioned songs got me through. In my humble opinion, Commissioned was the MOST theologically accurate contemporary guy group of its day. I also believe THAT is the reason why they never hit ""the big time"" in terms of ""cross-over"" appeal (which Fred speaks about), which is almost a requirement for music today, even Christian music. They sang CONSISTENTLY and PLAINLY about JESUS (not ""him"") and challenged the body to holiness and  righteousness living. Not too many cross-over audiences (or producers) wanted to hear these kind of powerful and distinctly Christian messages.

Some of my favorites are: ""Get Back in the Saddle,"" ""I'm Going On,"" ""Help Somebody,"" ""Hold Me,"" and ""Go and Tell Somebody."" And my absolute three all time favorites are: ""Tis So Sweet,"" ""Ordinary Just Won't Do,"" and 'KING OF GLORY!!!!""

If you don't have this DVD, as my brother told me, GET IT! Enjoy these brothers in Christ, who never got their ""just due"" in the music world, but will be rewarded in heaven for ""going to tell somebody!""

1707111,5,B000065AYY,"Anointed- This is my all time favorite DVD. It is unbelievable. I remember Commisioned well. Back in the days, they were about the only contemporary music played constantly on my local radio besides the Winans, Vicky & Marvin, BeBe & CeCe,the Hawkins and Tremaine. I was in my teenage years and was truly fascinated by Commisioned. I couldn't figure out how they knew what I wanted to say to God. Most of my peers don't remember. But I just tell them this is where Fred Hammond and Marvin Sapp got their started. Then it's ""oh ok"".

If anyone listens to this concert they will say to themselves ""where have I been"". At points, Commisioned is almost choked up on stage at the unsolicited audience participation. And most of them stood up continually through every song. Oh, if I could have been there in person. That would have been the only thing better than watching this DVD.

You will appreciate the fact that they pretty much left the songs as they were originally. Just with greater musical enhancement. Awesome, just awesome band, I mean 2 sets of drums being played at the same time with simulataneous beats -come on. RFC background singers. You can't get no better than that.

1707114,5,B000065AYY,"This is a COMMISSIONED fan's prize jewel. I believe this album was the best live performance ever. The setup on this DVD is classic. Fred Hammond, the head-producer of the project, did an exceedingly marvelous job setting up his band and had the right sound technicians to set up the right moods for each song and scene. The band featuring musical director Noel Hall, (keyboards & organ) mega keyboardist newcomer Luther Hanes, Tommie Walker, Darius Fentress, (percussions) Mo' Horns, Darryl Dixon, (guitar) Marvin McQuitty, (drums) the original drummer of COMMISSIONED, Michael Williams, and of course, Fred Hammond on bass, was wonderful. They all gelled together and the magic of the synths re-created all the original sounds of the recordings from the past. Also, every song, especially the testimony of Marcus Cole, new member of COMMISSIONED on the follow-up vocals of ""Ordinary Just Won't Do"" and Keith Staten's plea in ""Will You Be Ready"" has the power to reach everyone who has fallen by the wayside in their walk of faith.

The first time I watched the video, I was transported back to that specactular evening and was blessed again by the ministry of Commissioned. Not only are they great musicians/entertainers, but they are unashamedly ministers first and foremost.  I only wish that they had some additional ""behind the scenes"" footage.  That would have made an awesome video out of this world.

I've had the DVD since the day it came out and I've watched it everyday. The only thing that bothered me is that the DVD didn't have any special features like pre and post-concert interviews or any behind the scenes looks. But, all in all this is a tremendous experience. I saw them in Charlotte and it was the best concert I've ever attended. These guys are great and their chemistry is great onstage. Marvin and Marcus cutup on stage. The two drummers are awesome. The brass section is fun to watch. You can't see their antics on CD. On ""Ordinary Just Won't Do"" you get to see the emotions behind the singing. This was just fun to watch.
