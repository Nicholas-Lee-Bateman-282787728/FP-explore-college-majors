8595560,1,B00DOZNEM4,"THIS HAS GO TO BE ONE OF THE WORST SET OF 4 MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN. YUMA WASN'T BAD, BUT CLINT WALKER SITS HIGH ON A HORSE. HIS FEET HANG DOWN 2 FEET PAST THE STIRRUPS. HE WAS GOOD ON TV, BUIT HE'S TOO HUSKY... I'VE SEEN JOHN IRLAND IN MOVIES WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, AND HE MUST HAVE NEEDED A JOB AWFUL BAD TO PLAY IN THIS MOVIE. THE LAST ONE WAS PASSABLE, BUT I'VE ALWAYS SAID , SHATNER IS CAPTAIN KIRK AND THAT'S ALL; HE'S NO ACTOR. THE OTHER WESTERN WAS A POOPER RIGHT FROM THE START. THE DISC SHOULD BE IN THE ""DOLLAR TREE STORES"" FOR $1. OO ONLY, ""A BUCK.""... I GAVE THE DISC AWAY TO THE NEEDY///",1468972800,,596,3.8934426229508197

8595563,1,B00DOZNEM4,"Unfortunately this pack is only good for the bin. ""Gunslinger"" was so dark you could barely see what was happening.
""Yuma"" would have been quite a good movie if only you could see it. The transfer on this was very poor, so far out of focus it was unwatchable. ""Pioneer Woman"" and ""Man Of The East"" were passable only. If I had known how bad this pack was going to be I would not have purchased it. AVOID IT at ANY cost.",1416787200,5,419,4.121951219512195

8595566,2,B00DOZNEM4,To include never-before-released MAN OF THE EAST with three PD titles is a joke. Especially when they have a beautiful HD master for this film and didn't give the film a stand-alone release on DVD or BD. Two of these movies are unwatchable second generation VHS transfers and all 4 full length films are squeezed into 1 disc.,1399680000,4,325,4.620689655172414
8595567,1,B00DOZNEM4,"This is a set of cheaply made Westerns.  Yuma is the best of the bunch.  If I had known how poor the production and acting was in these movies, I would not have purchased this collection.  Save your money!  You can get Yuma other ways.  The others are pretty much a waste of time.",1391299200,,280,4.111111111111111
8595568,4,B00DOZNEM4,this is another good value collection of westerns but but i am only giving it 4 stars because how many times have they recycled YUMA,1387497600,2,132,4.32
