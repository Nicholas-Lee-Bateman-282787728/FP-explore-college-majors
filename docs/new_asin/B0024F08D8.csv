3845491,5,B0024F08D8,The acting is great. Throughout the whole movie there is suspense and intrigue. I love movies where basically it is 2 actors that carry the whole movie. The two carry on a dialogue and it keeps you on your toes for the entire movie. I love movies with a twist.,1379635200,,260,4.22
3845492,4,B0024F08D8,"If you pay attention to it than you'll understand it. There is a suspense/thriller element to it. More mystery than anything. there are surprises and a few twists in it that I liked. All in all it is a worth watching. I must have thought it was good because I bought it. It shipped a little slower than expected, but not too bad.",1375833600,3,329,4.238095238095238
3845493,5,B0024F08D8,Betrayed is an interesting psychological thriller. It was rather predictable but it  held my attention.  I would recommend this film.,1371859200,,133,5.6
3845494,4,B0024F08D8,"""Betrayed"" kept my interest throughout. Sure...you could say certain parts were a little implausible. But, you can pick apart just about any movie if you want to. If you just go with it, I think you'll enjoy the time spent. Imagine yourself waking up in a cold, damp, cell...not knowing what's going on. A sinister someone coming in every so often looking for answers you don't have. Melissa George does a very good job, I think, of pulling her character off. It will keep your interest until the end. The ending was a little weak, but it wasn't worth abandoning the movie. Give it a try.",1369008000,2,588,4.556603773584905
3845495,3,B0024F08D8,"THE BETRAYED is a rather long-winded ""thriller"" w/ few actual thrills. Melissa George (TURISTAS, TRIANGLE) is adequate in her role as Jamie Taylor, a woman who wakes up on the cold floor of a warehouse, wondering why she's there. About 99.98% of the ""action"" takes place in one small-ish room in the supposedly vast building. Oded Fehr (yeah, the MUMMY guy) plays the mysterious, masked captor, trying to get information from Jamie through intimidation, violence, and a weird sort of kindness (??). Things drag on until the final 20 minutes or so, when Alice Krige (GHOST STORY, SLEEPWALKERS, SILENT HILL) makes her appearance. Ms. Krige almost saves the entire movie, but is only in it for about 15 minutes. Still, she's fascinating to watch as always! Not a terrible movie, just don't expect any nail-biting...",1325808000,4,812,5.022222222222222
3845496,5,B0024F08D8,The Betrayed is one of the best thrillers Ive seen in the many years Ive watched this kind of movie.,1320019200,,100,4.05
3845497,4,B0024F08D8,"I really enjoyed this movie. It kept me curious of who the kidnappers were and if the husband was really involved with the gang. Overall, it was interesting!! A must watch!!!",1306195200,,174,4.645161290322581
3845498,1,B0024F08D8,"As the other 2 reviews mention, implausible, stupid, lame plot twists, bad acting, characters act stupid, etc.  Not even worth the time to say much more.  If you're looking for unintentional laughs, there are much better options.",1301356800,,229,5.162162162162162
3845499,5,B0024F08D8,"What's better than a movie with dynamic characters well-developed by a good plot and good actors?  How about a movie featuring a plot dedicated to creating unnecessary twists with completely unexplained events?  Well that's what we have here, including a great final scene where a police officer walks into a room with six dead bodies and one live person.  The officer asks if she knows what ""they"" wanted, she replies ""no"" and leaves the room...and scene!  The acting could have saved such horrible plot twists, and that's when we really have the genius of ""The Betrayed""-a cast that shows less potential than the set of an amateur porn shoot that butchers every line tossed their way.  This movie moves from frustrating to enjoyable once you hit the bong and let the unintentional comedy soak in.  ""The Betrayed"" is enjoyable only with laughter, and trust me it will provide plenty of hilarious moments (albeit unintentionally).  Overall, I'd say it is funnier than ""Cop Out"".",1294012800,,978,4.96319018404908
3845500,3,B0024F08D8,"Most of this movie is shot in a dingy room in a warehouse someplace, and centers on Melissa George's character being imprisoned in said room, completely at the mercy of her captors. The story begins when Jamie Taylor [Melissa George] and her young son Michael are pulled out of their car after an accident and promptly imprisoned in a warehouse. Jamie is roughed up and her captor Alec [Oded Fehr] tells her that her husband is not who she thinks he is, but an assassin who is on the run from a crime syndicate after having stolen mob money totalling about 40 million dollars.  When Jamie refuses to believe her captor, her son Michael, who is also diabetic is used as a pawn - if Jamie refuses to comply, Michael will be killed.

Given a short period of time, Jamie has to rack her brain and utilize whatever clues she is given to piece together the answer to the question: where is the money? Her husband is nowhere to be found and Jamie has to rely on herself to get her and her son out of danger.

The movie itself plays out mainly as a series of dialogue-driven scenes [interspersed with the requisite violent scenes] between Jamie, her son and their captors. There's the enigmatic Alec who keeps himself masked for most of the film, the pervert peeping tom captor who lusts after Jamie, and several others. This is not a unique movie in the genre - those familiar with this genre will find other better movies out there with similar plot lines. I also did not like the scenes of violence involving the kid - not gory or over the top, but manipulative nevertheless.

The one thing I liked about this movie [hence the 3*] was the credible character development of Jamie {Melissa George} and Alec [Oded Fehr]. These two share a certain chemistry, not really sexual, but something more that is well-developed as the movie progresses. It is the only reason worth watching this movie. Otherwise this is a standard, uninspired crime drama that offers nothing new. A rental at best.",1246492800,27,1980,4.600566572237961
