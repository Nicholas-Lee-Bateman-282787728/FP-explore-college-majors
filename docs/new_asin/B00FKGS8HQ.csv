5994725,4,B00FKGS8HQ,"Comes hitting with the strength of a cult classic, and hopefully to stay.
This witty english comedy has collected laughter among the audiences and reluctance among the critics.
Extremely contemporary, this film may fail to pass the test of time, but for the time that has been running has delighted viewers with his dark humour and satirical style that has been characteristic of decades of english storytelling.

This eccentric mesh, all topped with the brilliant performance of Kevin Bishop, foresees the actor's career break toward comedy, proving success in both sides of the lake after his role in Super Fun Night.

However, the film doesn't seem to have fulfilled the american critic scene's expectations. From my point of view, with punch lines like 'Does anyone else here speak English and have been raped?', the scene can be presented a bit raw to swallow for american audiences. Nevertheless, is the incongruence and boldness of these dialogues what makes the characters in this film crazy and unique, and builds the dark charm of british comedy.

Definitely a must see this summer.",1400457600,3,1092,5.089385474860335
5994726,5,B00FKGS8HQ,A film about a London bobby gone a bit crazy seemed odd - you will find this is original and funny. It is the sort of film you can pull out later when you are having a bad day and want a laugh. Really good!,1396483200,2,206,3.6
5994727,5,B00FKGS8HQ,"Super funny independent movie! I wasn't familiar with the actors before this, but will definitely be looking out for more of their work.",1391040000,,136,4.956521739130435
5994728,5,B00FKGS8HQ,"I'm a fan of Kevin Bishop and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, Kevin's performance is well judged and he understands how not to play for the laughs.  The film is dark and funny though you sometimes think you shouldn't be laughing at the situations but you still do :)",1389916800,,267,4.448979591836735
5994729,5,B00FKGS8HQ,"This is an ace black comedy starring the very talented Kevin Bishop of Super Fun Night as a very charming but deranged British policeman on a bicycle who turns vigilante against gangs and lowlifes. Some LOL moments,  really good send ups of social media celebrity culture, and touching human moments. Kind of Batman on a bicycle! Put in a few. Plus before last sentence As an Italian I am glad it won awards in Italy, they know a good comedy.",1389916800,3,442,4.525
5994730,5,B00FKGS8HQ,"For those that enjoy humor on the darker side. Not the most dry dark I've seen, but still interesting. Those who gave low ratings obviously skipped the description and had no idea what they were getting into. Also, no...it is not a right wingers dream. The first ""event"" is a situation were many could at least see the side of the ""protagonist"". As the film progress the situations become less debatable.",1464652800,,404,4.704225352112676
5994731,4,B00FKGS8HQ,It's British humour.  The characters are quirky and the plot is based on the classic Death Wish  movie with a  twist. I would recommend it,1463788800,,138,4.44
5994732,5,B00FKGS8HQ,"Just a comment to Baker Bob's review.  I think he missed the point to the movie, and didn't actually pay that much attention.  The only thing he commented on liking was the ""Romanian chick"".  Ummm, if he would have paid attention, she was Russian.",1463011200,,247,4.568181818181818

5994735,5,B00FKGS8HQ,"Excellent I thought, great storyline with a ton of twists, a fantastic finish that made me chuckle. Any of the reviews that give it 1 or 2 stars should not in anyway distract from watching this movie. Some people's minds are to small to understand depth or are just based on some silly aganda.",1462147200,,293,4.444444444444445
5994736,1,B00FKGS8HQ,"""May I Kill U"", is a right wingers wank piece of a film... Seriously, it's not funny, it's not scary.  It was a terrible movie.  It was a very unclever...  I have no idea how so many people can like it on Amazon, but at least Rotten Tomatoes gave it the 15% it deserves.",1459382400,,270,3.962962962962963
5994737,2,B00FKGS8HQ,"I like English TV and movies, I especially like cop shows and dark comedies. I didn't care for this movie. I didn't like the main character I didn't feel any empathy for him at all. The main character failed to frighten me and he couldn't make me laugh. But that was true of the whole movie I just didn't find it either frightening or funny. And to be honest I just wasn't buying what they were selling... that is I didn't believe that a head injury would cause a boy scout like this to snap in that way. The low-budget didn't bother me the film was watchable just not very entertaining.
I did like the Romanian chic :)",1458777600,,619,4.254237288135593

5994752,4,B00FKGS8HQ,"Quirky but likable movie.  The premise was strange, the plot was not what you would expect.  And, the ending was not predictable (at least not for me.) The worst part about the movie is the cover photo or poster. It fails to communicate the dark-comedic nature of the film.",1448150400,,273,4.551020408163265
5994753,5,B00FKGS8HQ,"I find it very refreshing to stumble upon a movie as original and well made as this one.

5994779,5,B00FKGS8HQ,"A finely wrought British horror comedy by award-winning director Stuart Urban. Internet stardom plays against the serial killer narrative with comic & deadly twists. Urban drew from real serial killer histories, including Ted Bundy's, & mashes their rationales against a Charles Bronson 'Death Wish"" kind of vigilante justice. Baz Vartis, played by British actor Kevin Bishop, is a fresh-faced & trustworthy officer on the London beat. The closest he gets to firearms is the Smith & Wesson logo on his bicycle. Vartis' life unravels after a head injury and the relentless friction with his frowsy mum Bernice, played with glorious bitterness by the acclaimed British actor Frances Barber. The gritty world of London's streets & cheap row houses is captured in shadows & harsh lights by cinematographer Fernando Ruiz. Subtle & fitting score by Haim Frank Ifman evokes suspense & video games.",1425254400,3,890,5.274647887323944
