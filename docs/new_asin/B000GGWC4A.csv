8132051,3,B000GGWC4A,"If you love Looney Tunes, then like me, you probably have all the Golden Collection volumes, but some of your favorite episodes are missing.  So you may want to supplement your collection as I do with the old VHS tapes.  If you love Daffy, you may want this tape, although only 3 of the 6 cartoons cannot be found on the Golden Collection DVDs.  I suggest ""Just Plain Daffy""- with 8 cartoons and only 2 are repeats from the Golden Collection, as well.  But Daffy has been underdone a bit since that first release when they gave us the Scarlet Pimpernel and Duck Amuck amongst others.",1223856000,,583,4.471698113207547
8132052,5,B000GGWC4A,"I enjoyed this video very much,the opening began with the ""This Is It"" song from ""The Bugs Bunny Show"" and it played a parade of clips from various warner brother short subjects on a long film strip and the sequence ended with the title of the video it was sort of similar to those ""Walt Disney Cartoon Classics"" videos except the clips from those cartoons were not featured on a long film strip and it was all music.
Besides the opening sequence this video had 6 great cartoons.
'The Super Snooper' in which Daffy is a detective in a madcap mansion.
'Daffy Duck Hunt'Porky and his dog go duck hunting.
'You Were Never Duckier'in which daffy gets greedy and pretends to be a rooster in order to win $5,000 at a contest.
'Golden Yeggs' where a goose that lays a golden egg tricks everyone into thinking that daffy laid it.
'Dime To Retire'Another one of those shut eye cartoons where Porky spends a night at a Motel and daffy disturbes the pigs slumber.
'A Star is Bored'""Where daffy is Bug's Bunny's Stunt Double' and is on the receiving end of disrespect from both Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam""its also on of the few WB cartoons without bugs bunny in the title.
This is a great video featuring daffy at his best and its worht watching,if you want you can order it on the new and used section of Amazon.",1085097600,,1302,4.451882845188284
8132053,4,B000GGWC4A,"Daffy Duck has remained as Warner Brothers most popular self-egotistical irate of all time. The cartoons he has been featured in, still remain as popular as they were oriiginally released in the 1950's and 1940's.
The 1988 video, Daffy Duck's Madcap Mania, reflects the delightful humor, and zaniness this every-duck holds. From detective roles, like The Super Snooper, to his sarcastic demands to be a star in A Star Is Bored, it still proves that no other duck will do in this town. The collection even includes Daffy's only encounters with Henry Hawk in You Were Never Duckier, and Rocky, one half of the duo Rocky and Mugsy, in Golden Yeggs.
Although Daffy Duck maybe the complete opposite of any other cartoon fowl, his style and zaniness with every flap of the wing still continues to stand at least one more chuckle in the beak.",1019088000,,835,4.76551724137931
