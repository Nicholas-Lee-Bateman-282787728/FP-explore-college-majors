4184888,5,B003RHZ6KC,"Which is to say, good enough that it is more enjoyable than an ""A"" movie.

This is the kind of cinema I love. Fun, different, entertaining.

The high points:
Rollins: I am a BIG Rollins fan, and oh my GOD was he great. He has the whole douchey jock thing DOWN. I like how even though he's playing a guy who um, plays an idiot, his character still has those moments where it kinda wears thin and he kinda wants to smack these idiots.

Alice Cooper: ...what's to say. If there was ever a person that found their calling, it's Alice Cooper. He plays his persona so well that the most surprising thing about him is how normal he is. That's the greatest thing I can say, the REAL him is the one you don't buy, his persona? Unquestionable. And he brings that same creepy charm to his character in this movie. And arguably does a pretty damned good job acting, not oscar worthy but, you expect worse from a musician!

Iggy Pop: Wow, Iggy has done some drugs in his life, lol. That being said, he plays pretty much what he seems like in real life. A musician that has kind of, moved forward, a guy who has been around, done some stuff, but seems like ultimately one hell of a decent guy. Great addition. Plus, who doesn't want to see Iggy Pop?

Dimitri Coats: That dudes face...holy CRAP. This guy stands out! That face, lol.

Dave Foley: If you know dave foley I don't really need to say anything.

The Music: Shockingly, even though you might expect the music to...ugh...to suck...it really doesn't. Catchy, goes great with the movie, very surprised by how enjoyable it was!

The Photography: This movie was BEAUTIFULLY shot. They don't flat out say it, but they allude to the fact it was shot with a RED camera, if so, RED should be paying THEM! Very well used.

And finally...Hugo: This guy...man, this is what comic relief is SUPPOSED to be, not prat falls and bear traps, just well timed, well placed, PERFECTLY acted, moments of brevity.

Never once does this movie feel hammy or lame, I don't even feel right calling it a B movie, the production quality is good (seems like they did an awesome job using real locations and good photography to make up for a giant budget), the acting is good (with only one semi intentional moment that kinda slips up), the music top notch, and an interesting (given the setting of vampires and rock and roll).

Given that a setting of vampires and rock and roll makes it virtually impossible NOT to make a cliche, the fact that they, in fact, did not make just another cliche goth-rock movie is flatly staggering.

After a couple viewings the underlying drug theme even seems to have it's own, very subtle, legs.

In the making of extra the director/writer/actor says at one point he ""wanted to create something different"". Well done man, you did.",1286755200,3,2780,4.51394422310757
4184889,3,B003RHZ6KC,"Vampire comedies are surprisingly a pretty short list.  At the peak of my personal faves would be the bizarre '74 dark comedy Blood for Dracula.  2010's SUCK by Rob Stefaniuk immediately gets vaulted pretty close to the top of the goofy blood suckin heap, partly by default.  It is a very solid film, featuring small roles for Rock legends Alice Cooper and Iggy Pop.  Malcolm McDowell, Henry Rollins, Moby and several others also share the spotlight.  But they all pretty much play little side dishes for the main course--the yummy Canadian hotness Jessica Pare (Hot Tub Time Machine).

It's the story of a struggling rock band called The Winners.  They're all kinda lovable losers, except for the gorgieoso female bassist Jennifer(Pare).  Early on she gets converted to a little vamp vixen and goes on a super slurping spree.

Have you ever noticed in real life the more a band sucks the more popular they get?  Same is the case here.

It's difficult to bring much new to this genre, but SUCK makes a decent effort.  It's stylistic with some funny moments.  Great music.  Good acting.  Okay blood suckage.  There might even be a little nudity if you have a good imagination, but not actually.  Oh, I did think the ending was kinda lame, but oh well.

Bottom line--one of the best vampire comedies ever, which isn't really saying much.",1286668800,6,1335,4.755458515283843
4184890,5,B003RHZ6KC,"Let me say right up front, I firmly believe the Horror Comedy subgenre is filled with more films of no worth whatsoever than almost any other film type one could name. For every success like Young Frankenstein or Shaun of the Dead, there are easily a hundred clunkers produced that are neither scary nor funny.

One might reasonably presume my expectations for Suck were therefore pretty low going in, but this truly is one of the rare exceptions that shows that these type of films CAN work, as long as the filmakers apply sufficient intelligence and perseverence. Obviously this entire film cost less to make than the budget for coffee and donuts consumed during the filming of Avatar, but the filmakers turn their lack of big bucks into an actual virtue. The use of campy stop motion animation to tie live action scenes together right from the opening moment sets the tone for the film perfectly. And there is actual COMEDY in this movie. The laugh out loud kind (the ""nosebleed"" scene gets me even on the second and third viewings...Classic).

The cast is extremely capable, and turn in appealing performances pretty much across the board. Even the one I thought was going to be a clunker when I first saw him (Dimitri Coats of Burning Brides, whose heavy vampire makeup when he first appears seems to bode poorly for the rest of the film) completely turns that initial perception on it's head when he has a chance to sing (one of the highlights of the film imho).

There are smart little touches throughout the film, like the cast ""accidently"" recreating the covers of famous rock albums several times throughout the film. This is done in a sly way mostly, and you could miss them if you're not paying attention.

The guest cast of rock icons clearly were having fun with their roles, and their performances generally have a bit more meat to them than a simple cameo. Iggy Pop in particular stood out as the older rocker who'd ""been there and done that"" and was pretty much past the desire for fame. Alice Cooper and Henry Rollins were also fun to watch. Moby channeling Rob Halford of Judas Priest with gusto was a hoot as well.

Overall: Stylish, funny, great tunes and just generally a good time.",1286496000,2,2204,4.670103092783505
4184891,5,B003RHZ6KC,"Suck is a very fun and clever movie to watch.  The story and plot are pretty simple.  It's about a struggling local rock band.  One of the members is bitten by a very creepy vampire and turns into one herself.  All of a sudden they are more popular than their limited talent would ever had afforded them had she not been bitten.  One of the very fun elements of this movie is how they keep ""accidentally"" creating classic album covers.  It's fun to watch for them and figure out who they're emulating.  They also seem to mock a lot of the horror and rock films from the past.  I was especailly amused when their drummer dies (re:  This is Spinal Tap).  It also includes cameos from some great rock stars including Alice Cooper, Iggy Pop, Moby and Alex Lifeson.  It probably isn't everyones's cup of tea, but certainly rock fans and horror fans will enjoy.",1286323200,,855,4.451612903225806
4184892,4,B003RHZ6KC,"Sorry. I couldn't think of a non-cheesy title for the review.
So Suck is pretty under-the-radar at this point. It might end up being one of those movies that the trendy dudes talk about knowing about BEFORE it was popular though. For a low-budget movie it looks really great and has a great cast and fantastic rock legends for cameos and small roles. McDowell is great as ""Eddie VanHelsing."" As are Alice Cooper, Iggy Pop and Henry Rollins to name just a few of the rockers in the movie. But the primary cast is also really good. The star of the movie is also the writer/director and he does a very good job playing the ""straight man"" as it were. The humor is pretty spot on and flows naturally. The only thing keeping the movie from being really great is the pacing and the conclusion. The pacing is sort of all over the place and doesn't build to a worthwhile climax. And the end of the movie is just a little underwhelming. Almost like the writer/director/star knew he had to come up with something after the climax, but ran out of steam before he got there. And even though it is a comedy, I would have liked to have seen some moral repercussions for the main characters.
But it's still a very enjoyable movie, and if you're a rock aficionado you'll love pointing out cameos from veteran rockers since just about every minor and bit role is filled by a rock star. Suck should be enjoyed by groups of friends, or better yet, bandmates.",1286323200,10,1438,4.450757575757576
4184893,5,B003RHZ6KC,"I LUV this movie- especially the ""Winners"" tracks. A nice Goth version on ""White Heat""-era Velvet Underground. But does anyone know if these songs have been immortalised on CD? I know the official film site ([...]) has a link where you can buy downloads via Apple/iTunes but some of us still perfer hard copy.",1286150400,,309,4.7407407407407405
4184894,4,B003RHZ6KC,"1 Blu-Ray disc, released September 28, 2010

""Suck"" is a rock vampire comedy written and directed by Rob Stefaniuk who also stars as the lead singer, Joey. The band, The Winners has been around for ten years now and isn't doing so well until Jennifer played by Jessica Par leaves one night as a small town girl next door and goes to a party and comes back a pale, vivacious red-head with pale blue eyes. Now their bassist is getting all kinds of attention for being a smokin' hot vampire onstage and no one can stop staring and cheering.

""Suck"" is like a endless string of really freaky, goth vampire music videos. The soundtrack is a must for getting in the mood for Halloween. This movie is a love letter to music fans with tons of music video homages, references, and a big detour away from sparkly vamps back to scary, goth ones with crazy contacts. There are more rock stars than actors filling up the cast and this could easily become a cult classic for a generation fed up with ""Twilight"" that loves rock. A running joke throughout is anytime the band is complaining about someone, those people ""suck!"" It's clearly a dreamy reality throughout where anything can happen like sudden songs in the middle of a scene or crazy jokes like sticking a straw in someone's neck and drinking them like a slurpee.

The band itself besides the lead singer and bassist includes Paul Anthony playing Tyler, Mike Lobel playing Sam, and the most fun is Chris Ratz playing the French Canadian, Hugo with a ridiculous accent who lets Jennifer walk all over him. They all kind of have a thing for her which is amplified by her vamp-hotness, but Hugo is like a lost puppy dog and is more than happy to help dispose of the bodies for her and is often walking around with the blood of her victims all over him. Boy's going to need some serious therapy someday, hehe. Dave Foley plays their manager and is pretty hilarious in the role of anything to make money. At one point, vampires are drinking a groupie after the show and when he sees she's still alive, he remarks, ""Oh, you're still with us, how you doin?""

This movie is a big who's who with Iggy Pop, Alice Cooper, Moby, and Henry Rollins to name a few in the supporting cast. Iggy Pop plays Victor, a low key guy who's out of the scene but still in touch with it and tries to give the band advice and it isn't a far stretch from acting like himself. Alice Cooper plays a bartender/crossroads vampire that appears to lead singer, Joey in his dreams and wears giant black feather wings. Moby plays Beef, this rocker who gets pelted with meat who's pretty much a jerk and gets what's coming to him and is pretty far from the easy-going guy he normally is. Henry Rollins is cast perfectly in a fast-talking, smooth radio DJ roll who gets to be a jerk to the band and ad-lib some of his lines (you can totally tell, it's classic Henry Rollins! If you haven't seen his DVDs, it's a MUST for comedy story-telling ability). He also wears an ""interesting"" wig that doesn't show up until his last scene when you get to see his whole face.

One other subplot in this film is that there is a mysterious man with an eye patch, Eddie Van Helsing played by Malcolm McDowell (Linderman on ""Heroes"") who follows the band across the country to avenge a lost love, looking for information on the Queen vampire played by a VERY freaky-looking Dimitri Coats who turned Jennifer.

The style of this movie is pretty awesome and exciting with its lighting choices and switching to slow motion for the vampires makes them look even more alluring than before. One fun stylistic choice is every time the band is traveling in their vehicle, it switches to a stop-motion format.

This is a fun, silly movie and is a must see for people who detest sparkly vamps and love rock n' roll with a comedy twist. Pick it up for Halloween and have some drinks beforehand.

Bonus Features:

There is a making of featurette that discusses how difficult it is to get everyone on the same page for a movie like this and mixing the music and film. The vampires in motion often switch into a sped-up or slow motion appearance so in scenes where they are singing, they had to do it double-time for it to slow down and sync up to the song. You get to find out who actually sang and played their instruments and who filled in for those who did not. Henry Rollins gives feedback on his character being based on actual people he met in the music business who were jerks and Calico Cooper who plays a barmaid tells a story of the group trying to get through customs telling people they were doing a movie called ""Suck"" and trying to explain it wasn't a porno. Also in the bonus features is commentary from writer/director/star Rob Stefaniuk and cinematographer Gregor Hagey where they both talk about how the movie came together, effects and lighting, and how much fun it was to work with some rock legends.",1285804800,6,4899,4.489337822671156
4184895,5,B003RHZ6KC,"I have to say that this movie is right up there with ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW and surpasses it on some levels!  The music is awesome!  Not a single song SUCKS!  Lol!  The acting is really great.  It knows when to be cheesy, it knows when to be serious, it knows exactly what it is!  The makeup and hair are very well done throughout and the dialogue is quick and easy to follow.  The lead singer of Burning Brides stars as the ""Queen"" Vampire and he is just AWESOME!  SEE THIS MOVIE!!!  Oh, and Alice Cooper as ""something much older"" is just INSPIRED!!!  This movie is chock full o' rock!",1285027200,10,589,4.2727272727272725

4184913,4,B003RHZ6KC,"Besides the classic Nosferatu, Interview with the Vampire, Salem's Lot, The Lost Boys and Let the Right One In (Swedish original), Suck is another great vampire flick, especially if you're a fan of rock and punk (Alice Cooper, Iggy Pop, Henry Rollins, and a couple of other rock legends have Cameos, Alice's and Iggy's being the longest). It's very easy to tell that, and I believe the filmmaker's intention was to use vampirism as a metaphor for drugs, and if you choose to see it that way it's understandable--I just love a good Vampire movie...plus that Coats dude plays a freaky looking vampire, and his music is good.",1475107200,,622,4.768518518518518

Alice Cooper is truly in his element in this, as is Malcolm McDowell. Alex Lifeson is perfect as the border agent. I loved the band members. I've spent enough time around roadies and the French Canadian roadie is priceless. Dimitri Coats plays one of the best predatory vampires I've seen in some time.

4184957,5,B003RHZ6KC,"I was surfing the Chiller channel although have never watched a movie from it when I saw Alice Cooper onscreen. So I decided to DVR the movie. A week or so later-tonight, I watched it. But about 20 minutes in, I liked it so much I decided to rent it from Amazon. This is one of those goofy, fun, hilarious movies that you need to see when you are with friends and/or in a totally good mood. It ""sucked"" at the theaters apparently BUT it is one of those little gems that are ones you like to see more than once. Then it becomes quotable even when you're my age and thought you were past the ""Princess Bride"" phase long ago. There are great lines, fun characters (HUGO!!!). EVEN the music is pretty good considering the dreck that USUALLY happens in movies with rock songs. They got Malcolm McDowell for goodness sake! He's an epic actor! I saw Alex Lifeson from RUSH, Moby, Iggy Pop, Henry Rollins, punk guitarist Dimitri Coats, and there's actors like Dave Foley (he's always playing funny guys), Jessica Pare ( Mad Men and is known for singing). NICOLE DE BOER is in it too for Star Trek fans. The reason it's also good is that the actors really did a good job with a lower budget movie and you can tell they had fun doing it. The effects are actually carefully done (I LOVE how they used CGI to make a YOUNG Malcolm McDowell. He looked like he did in his ""Clockwork Orange"" years!). Years ago my younger sister forced me to watch ""Better Off Dead"" because she knew I liked John Cusak. I still thank her for it. It was a bargain bin movie that had great lines, charming, fun to watch actors, and it was REALLY funny. And again, quotable-who can forget the PAPERBOY's LINES??. SO, if you want to have fun, watch a goofy, silly but actually good movie, I recommend this.

4185024,4,B003RHZ6KC,"Suck was an awesome movie. I had low expectations. Usually these kind of horror/comedies are a dime a dozen and very low budget... usually to the point of making them unwatchable. Unless they have a high budget, these films are usually easily forgotten.

With it's unknown but great acting cast, the LONG LONG LONG list of cameos from the likes of people like ALICE COOPER, HENRY ROLLINS, IGGY POP... and SO many more, and the great storyline/writing SUCK does what most horror comedies don't ... DELIVER.

In an age where Vampires have become SO popular thanks to teeny bopping Twilight fans (ick), it is refreshing to see a comedic vampire that you can laugh at but still like.

I recommend this movie to all who love to laugh, rock (cause it is filled with awesome music), and who want to see something than the NEW stereotypical vampires a'la' twilight.

My favorite song has to be ""she tried to kill me in my sleep last night"", by The winners, the band of vampires the movie revolves around.

The only problem I had was that the first half and second half seem like two different movies in some ways. The first half is funny, but has a serious side that still mostly roots itself in reality when it comes to vampires like any vampire movie. The second half goes the complete opposite direction. Its still funny in its own way, but now people are getting murdered left and right for ""food"", and blood is everywhere, but there are no consequences. No police and nobody seems to care.  Then they become famous as a vampire band and are all over the media like being a vampire is a normal everyday thing. Maybe in the world this movie takes place in vampires were always real, but this wasn't the kind of film where they were going to explain the details. The latter part of the movie just seemed to be too off the wall and soured things for me a bit.

The music for the movie was good, and the guest rock stars did a good job in their roles, as did the cast. Overall they did a nice job, but I think it should have stayed slightly more serious and rooted in reality than it did. Its definitely worth renting Suck when you want some laughs.",1331769600,,1393,4.268939393939394
4185070,4,B003RHZ6KC,"4 Stars = Classic

I've been running into some great Vampire films lately out there underneath the bats radar, & 2009 Canadian film, ""Suck,"" is no exception. Clever, cutting edge Vampire comedy, with a drop of musical in it, about a struggling nowhere rock band, who turns into Vampires & finds success. Yes, this plot line has been used before, but never quite like this, as hilarious black comedy abounds, with imaginative twists on rock n' roll life on the road & Vampires!

You got to love a film that features surprisingly great, funny, witty appearances by, Alice Cooper, Iggy Pop, & Henry Rollins. A surprising, I'd never know it was Alex Lifeson of Rush, as a gung-ho US boarder patrol officer, LOL! Moby, as Buffalo, NY's, biggest rock star ego is a hoot as ""Beef,"" the lead singer for a band who fans throw raw meat at while performing! How about Malcolm McDowell as EVH, that is, Eddy Van Helsing. Funny stuff! Then there is Dimitri Coats, as the Vampire who starts this all, who looks like Johnny Depp's ""Mad Hatter"" character on steroids, turned Vampire, which makes for a pretty convincing bloodsucker!

 Wink's & nod's abound in this film to rock culture & Vampire lore. You have to watch intently to catch them all, & ""Hugo"" the roadie for the band as a Renfield type character about steals the show!

This film does not take it's self seriously, & you shouldn't either, otherwise the whole point will be missed, that point is fun! You have to stick with it, as it gets funnier as it progresses, & Director, Rob Stefaniuk is one to watch!

For lovers of Vampires with a wicked since of humor, you'll suck this one up!",1326931200,4,1633,4.594501718213058
4185071,4,B003RHZ6KC,"A giddy, goofy piece of rock and roll camp that delivers on all counts, from the homages to classic rock albums and pictures to the cameos from Moby, Henry Rollins, Iggy Pop, Alice Cooper, Alex Lifeson, ""Suck"" makes glorious hash of the overworked vampire movie and rock band films. Dave Foley manages ""The Winners,"" a mediocre band that travels in a hearse and can't catch a break. That is, until the sexy female bass player gets bit and becomes a goth idol. Before you know it, the band is gaining fans by the thousands, leaving a trail of groupies in their wake and Malcolm McDowell on their trail.

There is no real attempt to make this anything but a corny cult flick, even the 'animation' is hokey. Alice and Iggy are obviously having a blast chewing their parts, and there's an hysterical inside joke regarding Moby as the lead singer of a rival band. The original songs are just good enough to be Spinal Tapp-ish, but not too bad as to make you graon. The soundtrack itself contains the likes of Lou Reed, Iggy, Cooper, David Bowie and The Burning Brides, and is a true addition to the film. ""Suck"" is exactly the kind of film that should be on the A-List for a few decades' worth of Halloween parties.",1322870400,2,1210,4.5

4185075,5,B003RHZ6KC,"Some people thought that Suck sucked, but I didn't. The film is about the rock `n' roll lifestyle and vampires, and the challenges presented to a group of young musicians on tour with a bloodsucker in their midst. The film has relatively low production values, although it makes do fairly well with whatever money there was for some good visual effects, camera techniques, slow-mo and sped-up scenes, great cameos, and lots of blood and gore. It has a fine-tuned and somewhat crackling (but maybe a bit too hip to be genuine) screenplay that occasionally indulges in cliche (the series of famous album covers done in tableau vivant in the first part, for example - see pictures below).

With all of its cameos, and great songs by Burning Brides - the band of Dmitri Coats, the actor who plays the major vampire Queenie - being played throughout, and the film is probably the most rock `n' roll film since Roadkill. But where Roadkill only had a famous cameo by Joey Ramone and Nash the Slash, this one has appearances by Iggy Pop, Alice Cooper, Henry Rollins (in a really bad mop top/wig), Alex Lifeson of Rush, Moby and Carol Pope of Rough Trade (and also Alice Cooper's daughter Calico Cooper, and Dave Foley of Kids in the Hall). All of these cameos (except, perhaps, for Carol Pope's) are stellar and any one of them is well worth the price of admission on its own, particularly Moby's as Beef Bellows, the metal singer in the band `Secretaries of Steak' (Moby is well-known as a life-long vegan), and Alex Lifeson as a psychotic border guard. Alice Cooper plays an elder vampire, so he's just as Alice as you want him to be, while Iggy Pop plays it straight as an ""aw shucks"" studio producer who isn't happy seeing our young protagonist making the wrong decisions about the vampire in his band. He's Jim, and we all love him.

One of the more clever moments in the film is the use of footage of Malcolm McDowell, who plays vampire hunter Eddie Van Helsing (get it? Eddie Van Halen, Eddie Van Helsing?), in his appearance in ""O Lucky Man!"" from 1973 to show a young Eddie Van Helsing. Very good, very good.",1313193600,,2110,4.594164456233422
4185076,4,B003RHZ6KC,"It's really hard to dislike this film, especially when it introduced me to a new band & has so many awesome musicians with cameos in it. Come on... Alice Cooper makes everything at least 10% more awesome.

The plot is decent enough. A group of never-beens suddenly starts taking off when their token female band member gets turned into a vampire by the uber-yummy Dimitri Coats. The acting is decent & the makeup that went into the vampire effects was pretty good for an indie-ish film. What's really cool is the splicing in of old Malcolm McDowell footage into the movie in order to show a young Eddie Van Helsing (McDowell's character) rather than hiring a lookalike to shoot the scene. It was cleverly done.

But I'll be honest here: this very much a movie that you'll either like or dismiss. You won't hate it, but you'll just sort of scratch your head & wonder why fans of the movie have watched it enough to know the song lyrics by heart. I loved this film but I can see where others wouldn't be as fond of it.

One thing that you can't miss though is the soundtrack. It's fantastic, featuring the Burning Brides' Flesh and Bone as well as other songs that I know will be making it onto my iPod pretty soon. Whether you end up loving or hating it, this is something that I heartily recommend that you check out. It's worth at least one watch.",1311724800,,1348,4.42741935483871

4185078,3,B003RHZ6KC,"Suck is a fairly humorous take on the subject of vampires.  It's darn near impossible for me to actually find vampires frightening in a suspenseful kind of way, and I'm sure the writers of this film were aware of that and designed the storyline for people like me, and well... the verdict is that it's an alright/above average movie.

It's about a group of teenagers who want to start up a rock band, but they have a great deal of trouble finding success and making it big in the world of rock music.  However, once it's discovered that a member of their band is a vampire, their popularity skyrockets to worldwide fame and fortune.

There's quite a bit of comedy not even remotely related to the actual concert/band performing segments and in fact, most of the storyline focuses on what's taking place away from the stage concerning the one vampire and trying to keep him/her under control in grocery stores, hotel rooms, and elsewhere.  Expect a great deal of blood, obviously.

It's an extremely ridiculous and outrageous storyline the entire way through, and I admit I was laughing more times than I thought I would, and with Alice Cooper making several appearances as a spiritual advisor, I'm sort of impressed.  Worth watching for the ridiculously cheesy laughs and no other possible reason.",1310947200,,1297,4.815315315315315

4185093,2,B003RHZ6KC,"Being that I am a huge Alice Cooper fan, that was the only reason I rented this title. Being surrounded by stars like Malcolm McDowell & Iggy Pop, I expected this was going to be an awesome movie about a band that become vampires. I must say, I was actually looking forward to this, even being that I have had more then enough of these friggen vampire and zombie movies that infested the shelves over the past several years, but this one sounded decent enough to give it a try.

So, a group of nobodies are in a band, the lead vocalist who is male sounds too feminine, and I knew the music was just going to be terrible from that first song they played. And by the end of the movie, yeah, it got no better at all, there was no decent music to be heard until the closing credits when an Alice Cooper song plays over it. The group end up getting a little recognition when their female bass player becomes a vampire and the bands popularity starts to buzz a little. Eventually just about everyone in the band become vampires, and they attempt to make it big, but along the way, they can't stop feeding on human blood and one has a conscious about murder and thinks it's just not right, causing a bit of turmoil in the group.

What happens in the end is up to you to find out if you want to know or not, see it, or don't. I can't say you will kick yourself for ever passing this one by, but there are far worse movies out there, especially in the horror/comedy field. Why I give the movie only 2 stars is because, the start wasn't all that captivating, and doesn't really pick up till later in the movie, but then again, parts in between where very slow and boring, and you just don't really care a lot of the times for why this and that is being shown. The end of the movie I thought was both dumb, and yet, cool at the same time. But at least Alice Cooper saved the very end from the movie going completely down the toilet. So I give it 2 stars, it's not the worst thin I have ever seen, yet, now that I have seen it, I really have no desire to ever see it again, and it's parts that lack in pace and where boring me, and on top of that, the fact it's another damn vampire movie, I can't give it anything more then 2 and a half stars. Rental is my recommendation, but I can't see anyone wanting to own the movie because they liked it for reasons other then personal attractions/interests and enjoyments etc... but yeah, it's not going to be a very memorable movie for years to come by anyone really other then fans of someone in this film, or perhaps you may have really enjoyed it for some reason?

4185096,3,B003RHZ6KC,"A Canadian vampire rock comedy ""Suck"" is not a bad movie A laid-back comedy with a few twists on the genre, the film is surprisingly amusing thanks to the decent performances from the cast (including some real-life rock legends), but, unique as it is, the film's premise - an out-of-work rock band becoming popular by turning vampires - is stretched beyond its breaking point.

The story is about a down-and-out rock band The Winners on a road trip. The band's leader Joey (Rob Stefaniuk, who also directed the film) knows the band has no future as their opportunistic manager Jeff (Dave Foley) deserts the band. But one night things start to change for the better. The bassist (and Joey's ex-girlfriend) Jennifer (Jessica Par), who vanished into the night with a stranger, comes back and she looks different. Her skin is much paler and ... more importantly, she gives a sensational performance on stage.

But being a vampire comes with some down sides, as you know, and Jennifer is no exception. Some troubles ensue, largely because of her appetites. The band's drummer Hugo (Chris Ratz) is given the task of taking care of the dead bodies left behind. Meanwhile, a vampire hunter Eddie Van Helsing (Malcolm McDowell) is in hot pursuit of the band getting more and more popular as they travel.

Part spoof, part road movie, and part rock-and-roll drama, ""Suck"" is a pretty enjoyable ride with good acting from the cast and amusing cameos from the rock icons including Alice Cooper, Iggy Pop, and Henry Rollins as DJ ""Rock'n Roger."" The soundtrack songs are wonderful, but ""The Winners"" itself is not very convincing as a band that transforms into a rock sensation, especially Jennifer's bassist. The vampire/rock jokes get tired quickly, with characters not fully developed. Also, apart from the interesting name of Eddie Van Helsing, McDowell has little to do in the film. His role is not effective either as a send-up or as a drama. Why don't you let him do something more?

All in all ""Suck"" is a pleasant surprise, with one interesting premise and some funny dialogues, plus nice music. ""Suck"" keeps you entertained, with more imagination and tighter editing, it could have been a better film.",1300838400,2,2198,4.900537634408602
4185097,5,B003RHZ6KC,"The movie was really fun to watch. It's not a horror. It's more in a ''vampire killers'' style, which is really good. More of a comedy and I wouldn't categorize it as a black comedy. Just open your mind and laugh while watching it. The effects for the movie are also good. I like how they mixed a few styles and put it all together. The plot for the movie is good, but it could be a little predictable to some. Again we have Van Helsing, the vampire hunter, but it's not all that bad to those who love vampires. Expect some twists in the movie. Too bad they didn't make the soundtrack for the movie as well.",1299628800,,607,4.1525423728813555
4185098,5,B003RHZ6KC,"Suck is really quality comedy more than horror.  The soundtrack and music is top notch as well.  I am very glad I purchased this based only on a DVD trailer.

The story is about a three guy, one girl band called The Winners.  Their cheesy manager is leaving them to manage a J-Pop band.  The lead singer gets some advice from a mysterious bartender who seems to be able to read his mind.  The bass player, Jennifer, meets a stranger who takes her back to his house where she undergoes a strange and non-traditional vampire transformation with no biting involved.  Trust me, it works.

Now keep in mind that I own over 100 vampire movies, everything from the supremely bad (Reign in Darkness comes to mind) to great (Bram Stoker's Dracula in my opinion is one of the best).  I don't usually care - if it has vampires in it, I will probably buy it.  During the last few years I've tried to curb my collecting down to vampire movies that have some redeeming quality.  I had no intention of buying this, until I found it at a local movie rental place that was closing down.  It was super cheap since the store was closing down.  I am SOO glad I did!!!  The movie was funny (intentionally so), well shot, and the cameos from Alice Cooper, Iggy Pop, Moby, and Henry Rollins were great.  The movie was done very well - production values were high, so the picture was crisp and clear with good color and lighting.  The characters were likeable.

4185114,5,B003RHZ6KC,"In the modern world of formulaic, contrived, unoriginal retread movie making there are small gems you find along the road thanks to Amazon and Netflix reviews, I added SUCK to my to see list. I dident have high expectations going into this movie especially with how they felt the need to pander and push the more noticeable names in this movie, seen all over the cover of this movie to attract people attention. This movie will become a classic in the Horror Comedy genre through word of mouth, in my opinion better than Shawn Of The Dead, Doghouse and Idle Hands, this movie was perfectly cast, a completely refreshing original idea. The stylized look of the movie was perfect, even with a bigger budget I couldn't imagine changing any of the affects, it plays perfect the way it is. Cheesy stop animation with the opening bat to the car driving through different States, the lighting, colors of the landscape were perfect (from the purple sky to the glow on stage. Perfectly cast (from the creepy looking head Vampire to Frenchy the Roadie), Not to mention this Movie is really funny, the French Roadie who hacks up the dead bodies for the band is FUNNY AS HELL. I see this movie for what it is.......Cool, Cheesy, Fun, with a Really Good Original Soundtrack, I'll see this movie a 100 times before I pass away, and maybe my time will come while I'm watch this movie, laughing my ass off with a pleased smile on my face.........I gotta go I think I got a nose bleed.",1293148800,4,1468,4.5643939393939394

4185118,5,B003RHZ6KC,"I am a seller on Amazon, and I had a few copies of Suck, both DVD and Blu-Ray. I watched it sell and kept wondering if it was something that I really wanted to see. I kept passing it off until I had one copy left. With my curiosity getting the best of me, I decided to finally pop it in and watch it. I was greeted with quite a pleasant surprise.

Here is a movie that proves that you don't need a huge budget to make a film entertaining and fun to watch. The basics of the story are this:

A down-and-out traveling band, The Winners, are touring across Canada, trying to get a break. Their manager quits them, giving them some poor excuses why, but in the process, tells them that there is a show coming up in the U.S. that will have a lot of important music people in attendance. So we are instantly thrown into a road trip, but not before the bass player, Jennifer, played by the strikingly beautiful Jessica Pare, is turned into a vampire by ""Queenie,"" played quite adeptly by the front man for the band Burning Brides, Dmitri Coats. (He sort of resembles the comedian Carrot Top as a vampire.) The leader of the band, Joey Winner, played with heart and depth by Rob Stefaniuk, who also co-wrote and directed the movie, proceeds to guide his band from show to show to eventually reach the big event. On the way, he meets up with Alice Cooper, Iggy Pop, Moby, and Alex Lifeson, among other strange people and settings. The great Malcolm McDowell fits the bill perfectly as Van Helsig, a vampire hunter who carries flashlights around with him because he's afraid of the dark--there's a bit of irony for ya--and he is hot on their trail. All the while the band is gaining in popularity (according to the My Space hits and comments) due mostly to the allure of the bass player, Jennifer. There is no need to go any further into the plot. I don't want to give too much away.

According to the special features, Alice Cooper thought that this movie was a cross between horror, comedy, and musical. I didn't see much comedy here. It seemed to be quite a serious problem that the bass player was a vampire, and the rest of the band, especially the roadie, had to cope with the problem as they traveled. It was definitely more horror and musical than comedy, and the pace of the movie never gave way to a dull moment. I was glued from start to finish.

The story was fun and inventive. The acting wasn't Oscar caliber, but there wasn't any cardboard, William Shatner-type overacting going on either. The direction was exceptional. With the usage of lightning and small special effects, the settings drew you in as if you were part of the crowd in those seedy bars. The character development was also very good. I found myself truly caring for the band-members in The Winners and their plight. The whole package was tied up nicely with a very satisfying ending as well.

Suck is not Schindler's List, but for what it is, what it tries to be, and what it accomplishes in the process, it's definitely worthy of five stars! *****",1290297600,2,3020,4.4538878842676315
4185119,1,B003RHZ6KC,"This is supposed to be funny? Talk about a slow burn that never followed thru. Horrible effects. Horrible script. Horrible jokes. Horrible movie. Where was the good music? Wasnt in the version I saw. Pathetic ""Oh lets recreate famous album covers"" and was Moby supposed to be a take on GG Allin?
This movie can eat dix. Avoid. Dont read the ""hype"" over this flick being great or good.

This movie doesnt just SUCK it bites.",1290124800,3,423,4.565789473684211
4185120,5,B003RHZ6KC,"From the acting to the humor to Iggy and Cooper to the music (!) and the whole story line and concept, I just totally enjoy this film.  One I'll watch again and often and as others have indicated - I wish they'd put all the tunes on a solid CD format versus just seperate downloads off the film's site!",1289260800,,302,4.11864406779661
4185151,4,B003RHZ6KC,"Somehow, I was a bit hesitant in viewing this. It looked as though it could miss the mark by a long shot, or that it might have been made for a very young crowd, but I was wrong on both counts. This is a horror comedy, (more comedy than horror) that is very cool and very hip. It's actually made for us older rockers and features cameos by the likes of Iggy Pop, Alice Cooper, Moby, et al.

This Canadian production centers on a no name rock band who finds their popularity soar as they, one by one, become vampires. It's full of a lot of in jokes, iconic images and observations about the rock music industry. Malcolm McDowell plays Eddie Van Helsing (get it? get it?) who follows the band trying to find the opportunity to do them in.

The Kids in the hall's Dave Foley has a smallish part as the bands manager and he does a nice job of being a slimeball. Jessica Pare plays the band's bass player and the first to turn Vampire. When she's in full turn, they get her make-up down tight. She looks stunning and makes it evident why the band's popularity begins to rise. All the other cast members do a really good job.

This works on a few levels and is a real hoot. Even most of the songs written for the movie are decent. The only place it lacked a bit was in the cinematography. It wasn't at all bad, but it lacked that certain something that could have put it in the big time.

If you're at all a fan of movies like Shaun of the Dead this will probably be right up your alley. Dig it.",1289260800,2,1489,4.141868512110727

4185155,3,B003RHZ6KC,"...it also lacks bite. No pun intended. Nice comedy about an unsuccessful band on the road becoming vamps along the way and also (or because of it) famous. sometimes silly, often not and much too seldom (if ever) hilarious (Rush's Alex Lifeson or Moby as Metal-Singer!!!). Its these cameos (plus the ones of Henry Rollins or Iggy Popp or Alice Cooper) that make a viewing worthwhile. Nothing more, nothing less...",1288483200,3,413,4.914285714285715
4185156,2,B003RHZ6KC,"A film that features Iggy Pop, Alice Cooper, Moby, and Henry Rollins should have been a good buy.

Starring the very sexy Jessica Par as Jennifer this film is a massive disapointment... if you're a vampire film fan. Dimitri Coats is the vampire ""Queenie"" who's make-up is some kind of throw-back to Queen of the Damned with Alice in Wonderland thrown-in. What started as a sensual vampire 'turning
 scene ended as a massive let-down. Jessica Par is lead off by the vampire to be turned, she becomes mesmerised, but soon ends up in spasms in the middle of the floor and you never even see her bitten. Next she turns up to the rest of the band with odd couloured eyes and pale make-up and the band don't think anything's wrong.

She has fangs and the first person she fees off she stabs with a plastic straw. If this works as comedy so be it, but as a vampire film it is just stupid",1288310400,,880,4.353658536585366
4185157,4,B003RHZ6KC,a couple of posters have made comparison to rocky horror. thought this movie was better. alice cooper is on-screen for more than just a cameo and adds something to the mix. also a good performance by malcolm mcdowell as the vampire hunter. this is one of those movies that people have barely heard about now but will gain momentum as time passes. it's on my halloween shelf to watch yearly at this point.,1288051200,10,404,4.5479452054794525

4185159,5,B003RHZ6KC,"Okay, so maybe it's not quite the classic that ""Shaun"" is, but this is a really, really fun horror comedy.  I rent all the video store horror movies and it is rare that one comes along that's as good as ""Suck.""  Well-shot, well-acted, great story, ""Suck"" feels like it's taunting critics with its title, but then it turns out to be a really solid film with what I thought would be just your typical blink-and-you'll-miss-them cameos until it turns out that Alice Cooper, Iggy Pop, Henry Rollins  (who is HILARIOUS) and Alex Lifeson are all just characters in the movie.  Who knew Lifeson was so funny?

The best thing about ""Suck"" is that while it's a good vampire comedy, it's also a play on indie band cautionary tale movies that has a few salient and pointed things to say about fame but is never overbearing or preachy.

I would really recommend this movie to horror fans.  It's really entertaining and a lot of fun and you can really feel the makers' love of both horror and rock-n-roll.",1287273600,22,992,4.570621468926554
4185160,3,B003RHZ6KC,"The Winners are a failing rock group from Canada that can't seem to catch a break. That is, until their female bass player is bitten by a vampire, turning her into an electric rock goddess that quickly draws a new crowd. Now, the group must make a choice: drop the vampire and return to a crummy career, or continue on the bloody road to success and pay for the horrifying consequences later. SUCK is a great new twist on the tired vampire theme that offers a ton of fun and  silly sense of humor. While the gags can be hit or miss, the band members are all enjoyable in their own separate ways, and the laughs flow at the same steady pace as the horror. Along with the killer cameos by rock legends Iggy Pop, Henry Rollins, and Alice Cooper, Stefaniuk also sneaks in a number of clever homages to classic album covers as recreated by the characters on-screen. Even with the plot inconsistencies and iffy acting, the small production gives it a certain B-movie charm that couldn't have been recaptured with a bigger budget or name actors. Overall, SUCK is an entertaining Horror Comedy that is sure to become an underground hit!
