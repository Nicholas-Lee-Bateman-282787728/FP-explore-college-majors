2859153,4,B000R7G9II,"Four stars is a bit much for this, but it's not bad. I was never bored, but if this had not been based on a real story, I would have knocked stars off for presenting an implausibly stupid heroine and generally shallow characters.
 The Swiss woman who gives up her business, boyfriend, family and country because she gets the hots for a young Masai warrior while on vacation is shallow. She can't be portrayed as anything else. The Masai women and a world-weary Italian priest are the only characters who appear to have any sense at all. They're a welcome respite from the generally idiotic cast of characters who inhabit the Kenya and Switzerland of this biographical melodrama.

The acting is good and the locales impressive. There is no plot to speak of other than what I've mentioned, just a collection of episodes. Some are gruelling, others vaguely humorous or touching. Since the two main protagonists are incapable of empathy or learning, the portrayal of their life as a series of isolated events in haphazard sequence is oddly fitting.

There's some steamy sex, a pregnancy gone horrifically wrong and an offscreen ritualistic genital mutilation. We don't learn much about the Masai, but we see the arrogance of Western self-indulgence and the ""Noble Savage"" version of colonial racism in the objectification of the hapless Masai by the predatory hedonism of his Swiss lover. I suppose we are meant to admire her pluck, but it's over shadowed by her cluelessness.",1189036800,17,1472,4.92741935483871

2859163,5,B000R7G9II,"Having read the books I was really keen to see the film. It seemed strange the characters having different names but it is a privacy thing I guess. The film made the book come alive being able to see first hand how she lived rather than just imagine. A little disappointed didn't stick strictly to story line but that's show biz I guess. The book made her appear Brave and strong the film portrayed her as foolish and naive.
 I think you should advertise that it is the English version of<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-White-Massai/dp/B000R7G9II/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The White Massai</a>&nbsp;because i wasn't sure. When it started off in German with subtitles i was a little worried, but then they started in English Phew!
Excellent, i thoroughly recommend it to anyone who has read the book,or has been to Africa and fallen in love with the culture. I have given it to my eighteen year old daughter to read before she goes to work in Africa for a year :)",1323561600,4,1005,5.090909090909091
2859164,4,B000R7G9II,"IT WAS 6 YEARS AGO WHEN I FOUND BOTH BOOKS IN THE FRANKFURT AIRPORT IN GERMAN LANGUAGE.
ON MY WAY TO THE US, I READ THE FIRST BOOK. I LOVED THE STORY, ADMIRED THE COUREGE OF CORINNE HOFFMAN.
THE BOOK 2 I READ IN AMERICA.
I LOVED BOTH BOOKS AND THE FILM DID NOT DO JUSTICE TO THE BOOKS. I READ BOOKS RATHER, HOWEVER I WONDERED
HOW THAT MOVIE CAME OUT. MY ADVICE IS, READ THE BOOKS, BETTER UNDERSTANDING.

MY MANY THANKS TO CORINNE, SHE WENT THROUGH A LOT FOR A LOVE SHE GAVE ALL FOR AND RECIEVED FROM HUSBAND NONE!
GLAD SHE FOUND HER WAY BACK HOME, 'HEIMAT' WE SAY OR VATERLAND. YES AFRICA IS BEAUTIFUL BUT ALSO DANGEROUS.

2859165,5,B000R7G9II,"The White Masai The film is interesting, romantic, such as White Masai quickly becomes accustomed to the culture of the man she loves.",1314403200,3,134,4.869565217391305
2859166,4,B000R7G9II,"I have read the book & also seen the movie.  Although the two are quite different from each other, they are both good in their own right.

I purchased the movie that was an import, ""All zone PAL"" meaning you can watch it on your computer not on your DVD player (if you live in the USA).  It was uncut & unrated (126 minutes)Thai DVD - Language spoken in Duetch/Thai & Subtitles are in English/Thai.
This is the only version that I know of that has English subtitles.

It is very hard to explain for myself the feelings that watching this movie evoked in me because they are polar opposite -
On one hand you have a woman that doesn't really know this man, his background, his culture ... I mean n-o-t-h-i-n-g (it's pretty much a relationship based on physical attraction). She ends up finding this man & jumping head first into a world that is extremely hard & on certain levels shocking!  She lives where there is no running water, no electricity, a few cars in the whole area, where female circumcision is the way for a child to becoming a woman, as well as giving your first born to your husbands mother. Not to forget that your home is a hut constructed with dried cow dung.  This life style is hard on the native Masai people let alone someone from a completely different background
... but ...
it is this woman's same determination that makes you stand up & applaud her courage for adjusting & living in a way that most people would have given up in the first week or died trying.
How many people do you know(family, friends, etc.) that have jumped into a relationship with someone based on a physical attraction??  I personally can count more than a few ... They go into a relationship based on looks & learn about ""who"" the person is later on.  People are people where ever you are in this world - we all have the same feelings regardless of our background, nationality, culture, and skin color.  When you take 2 people from such extremely different backgrounds & throw in barely knowing each others language - you take an already hard situation & make it even more difficult.

It is a beautiful movie with a sad story for not only Carola but also for the Samburu warrior Lemalian.

If your looking for a movie that is different, unique & based on a true story - This one may interest you.  A few words of caution with this DVD:  Some of the content is graphic (a few scenes with sexual situations & nudity, a still birth, & a scene where a young girl (approx 12-14 year old) is going to be circumcised.  For myself personally ... I wish there was an edited version - it was too graphic for me (this was the only copy I found to have English subtitles & wasn't aware of how graphic is was. This was my opinion - yours may be different.

Hopefully this can help anyone who is contemplating whether or not to get this movie.  I would strongly suggest reading the book first (it is very simply put together & easy to read) it will give you soooo much more depth to the characters & there lives.",1235347200,20,2998,4.3747747747747745
2859167,4,B000R7G9II,"I was under the impression that the movie had English subtitles but was only able to watch it in German.  Luckily I was able to follow along since I'd read the book but am wondering why the English subtitles aren't available.

The movie is missing a lot from the book (too much to fit in a movie) but is still definitely worth watching...there was a great choice of actors for the main characters (especially Jacky Ido!) and the music was excellent (the movie soundtrack to ""The White Masai"" is also worth getting).

I'd purchase it again if it was available with English subtitles!",1195948800,8,582,4.631067961165049

8198987,4,B000R7G9II,"An interesting German film, based on a true story, about one Carola, a Swiss woman touring Kenya with her boyfriend who is suddenly smitten by a tall, slender Masai tribesman named Lemalian. She astonishes her fianc by deciding to stay in Kenya and look for Lemalian. Eventually, she founds him among his people, living off the land as subsistence farmers, and decides to settle with him despite the obvious hardship of living there, especially for someone coming from the highly developed world. They eventually marry and they have a daughter but the obvious cultural differences take a toll in their relationship.

It might be hard to enjoy this movie if you expect the main character to be likable. As portrayed in the movie, Carola is quite immature: she is initially smitten by Lemalian when they dance sensually in a club. Clearly, the only reason she was attracted to him initially was purely sexual. At times, she looks both naive and arrogant: one has the sense that if she has decided to live among the Masai she should have to be more accommodating to Masai cultural mores. For instance, she is completely outraged when one of the girls in the tribe is circumcised as if she had never heard about this widespread costume before. When they open a shop that sells basic stuff to the tribe she arouses his jealousy by smiling to the male customers. And in the shop she also refuses to give credit to anyone, despite the wishes of her husband, ignoring a tribe's intricate kin relations. Lemalian's motivations are not very well explained in the movie, he is something of a blank, he doesn't understand why his wife cannot be more accommodating to Masai culture, and at the end one fells a bit of a pity to him (though not one forced him to marry Carola).

Overall I found this film to be very interesting and entertaining. A very nice photography that shows both the pretty and seamy side of Kenya helps the movie a lot.",1419897600,,1928,4.684365781710914
8198988,3,B000R7G9II,I was disappointed because it is supposed to be based on the book The names of the characters have been changed also and I don't understand why because it is a true story Ok the book is very long and has heaps more detail but I think it would have been better made into a longer version or mini series Not your fault Amazon Movies and books are a matter of personal taste Thanks for your good service,1392681600,,400,4.141025641025641
8198989,2,B000R7G9II,After reading the book I wanted to see the movie.  I was hoping the movie would be more about the culture and less about the marriage gone wrong.  I found the movie slow.,1391385600,,170,4.121212121212121
8198990,1,B000R7G9II,"this video is extremely poor quality - very amateurish.....  not worth the money spent I paid for it!

8198991,2,B000R7G9II,Nothing like the book! I was honestly disappointed. They tried to fit the whole book into 2 hours and it didn't work. It felt like they just went from scene to scene without any real transitions. I was so looking forward to seeing the movie. Only to be let down.,1384905600,,262,4.26

8198993,5,B000R7G9II,"This is a 5 star movie....True story....It lets you know, White people can't change the world...You sometimes have to dance to a different tune.....Massai's are not going to let you do to them like Whites did American blacks...You are nothing in other countries...I am glad she learned her lesson....Arlivia Lee",1374883200,,311,5.24
8198994,5,B000R7G9II,"I discovered this movie on Hulu and have watched it at least 10 times.
I did think it was sort of silly for Carola to travel after a man she had only briefly met. I can understand about instant physical attraction, but in my opion she was not very wise and should have taken time to get to know him....I also felt, Lemallian was slightly off in his mind..maybe a bit mentally defecient.. I lived through a situation somewhat similiar..a man i knew seemed fine..then he started throwing tantrums like a child..I very well understand how Carola felt.
  Anyway..all in all it is a romantic story and something about it that catches the watcher's interest..Maybe it is the theme is what all women seek....a love that trancends all time and space.. I think that women these days still want the forever after type of love, and it does not exist anymore....or rarely does exist..maybe 1 out of 1000 women find that one in a million man who is romantic,caring and faithful.
  Some parts of the movie were very sad, but most of the hardships that the book describes are left out of this movie..like the mosquitos....she got malaria over and over..not just one time...and when she finally left Africa she was in very poor health. I was horrified at the circumcism thing! Women get so little pleasure from sex mostly..then to take away the part that might help them to enjoy it..is very cruel....I assume the women just endure it..get pregnant and that is all there is to being married. Lots of women in The USA live that sort of life as to just enduring it and never even knowing what a climax is cause: men think all women want sex,all women have instant climaxes,that all they need to do is shove it in and she will be satisfied with that. Then men wonder why after years of enduring what anyone else would call rape...she cannot endure it no more. Most women will not report rape by a spouse cause if she does not have a fancy job..where is she going to go, or how is she going to support her children...So many women are trapped in years and years of all kinds of abuse. And if she does report it..who do Police..Courts beleive..of course The Men...
  I would strongly recommend this for anyone to watch and it does help if one reads the books to fill in the missing parts....I did think The Actress who played Carola did not do a very good job...That was a big flaw in the movie. She was more a K. Stewart type and i could see her playing that role with never any emotions and sort of a dead pan acting style.",1366848000,,2504,4.444444444444445
