7901981,5,B0000016W4,"""Portrait of Giselle"" is an important historical document.  Included are interviews with the ballerinas whose interpretations of this role are considered the best, though all are different.  What is most important is that many of these famous ballerinas are now deceased (Spessivtzeva, Karsavina, Ulanova, not to mention their partners shown in archival footage--Nureyev, Erich Bruhn--and Anton Dolin, maker of the film).  It is a moving film of this most moving of ballets, which Carla Fracci admits ""destroyed"" her emotionally every time she danced it.  Most valuable and highly recommended to any balletomane!",998438400,,612,5.619565217391305
