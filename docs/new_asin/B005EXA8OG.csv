8469281,4,B005EXA8OG,"An extraordinary film about a Jewish family in NY from 1934 - the ""six million"" refers to the population of New York City, not what is evoked by that number today (2017), i.e., the Holocaust.  It's a tear jerker from a story by Fannie Hurst but was regarded by David Selznick as his most personal film, and he expanded the Jewish content as the scripts went through various revisions.  Also to be noted is the score by Max Steiner, perhaps the first ""through composed"" musical score for a talkie that was not a musical. Almost unknown it is well worth a look, but do bring a tissue!",1488240000,,582,4.429906542056075
8469282,5,B005EXA8OG,I grew up in New York with foreign born Jewish grandparents.  This portrayal gets it right.  Every Jewish household should have a copy of this.  No surprise the leading man was actually Jewish; Hollywood changed his name.,1448755200,,221,4.918918918918919
8469283,5,B005EXA8OG,"Excellent as far as it goes, but Irene Dunne has to spend too much time off camera in deference  to co-star Ricardo Cortez.",1437350400,,123,4.3478260869565215
8469284,3,B005EXA8OG,"I bought this DVD because it is from the director of ""5th Avenue Girl"" and ""My Man Godfrey"" and I liked those movies.  This movie is not at the the same level as the other two mentioned.  A kid grows up to be a famous doctor, moves to a rich section of the city, then returns to poor section after he failed to save his father.  And the girl he likes needs his surgical skills to fix her crooked spine.  The whole plot is a bit disjointed and doesn't flow smoothly.  And there is no wit or anything memorable in the dialog.",1389916800,,523,4.088235294117647
8469285,4,B005EXA8OG,I got this film because the author of the textbook I'm using for the film music history seminar I'm teaching mentioned it as a benchmark in the history of film scores.  Max Steiner's score is an excellent example of the newly composed symphonic score just coming into vogue in the early 30s.,1365033600,4,291,4.596153846153846
8469286,4,B005EXA8OG,"Truthfully, this movie reminds me of a retread of The Jazz Singer without Al Jolson singing and hamming it up. Instead of performer Jack Robin/Jake Rabinowitz singing Kol Nidre, you have rakishly handsome Ricardo Cortez (with adequately oiled hair) playing the successful surgeon Dr. Felix Klauber who has forsaken his lower East Side roots and Jewish faith. In its place, Klauber has assumed the life of an uptown society doctor tending to the maladies of over indulged society ladies and performing risky surgeries that have made his reputation. He has lost steady contact with his family and his old sweetheart Jessica (a distinctly gentile Irene Dunn). When forced to perform risky surgery on his father (Gregory Ratoff) his world crumbles and he is forced to reevaluate his life and his value system.
Corny, most definitely. Still there is fundamentally something touching about this movie in terms of what appealed to a 1930's audience. I wanted Dr. Klauber to get rid of the phony routine and head back to the old neighborhood, marry Jessica, and make his family proud.
The print of this film was nothing special which is par for the with the made on demand Warner Archive films. Still, an admitted softie for period melodrama will probably like this movie.",1351987200,7,1264,4.995260663507109
