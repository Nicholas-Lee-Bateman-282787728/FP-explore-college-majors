8495793,5,B006AM10N8,"The discs are two 1 hour lectures with graphics and visual aids. Originally produced as PBS Specials, the sound and video quality are excellent. As is the material: a comprehensive look at Detoxification, and at the Fiber 35 way of eating (not a diet, but a healthier intake based on foods that are high in fiber - ""Big Food"" as Watson calls it). This latter is a very useful and easy way to permanently alter what you eat to give you better nutrition. Conveniently, if you could stand to loose some weight, that will happen automatically if you implement the concepts presented here. Everything presented here makes sense, nothing fadish or extreme, just proven, sensible advice on the nutritional value of high fiber food. Brenda Watson is quite engaging and she keeps the presentation moving right along. She has thoroughly mastered these subjects. She gives loads of information without ever bogging down in minutiae. A+! If only my college professors had been as good! I give you my strongest recommendation of this product because it is enjoyable to watch, because it's well done, and because I believe the information presented will help you. I consider this a bargain and I have recommended these discs to family and friends. I would happily purchase again.",1393027200,4,1265,4.943661971830986
