4008172,4,B002WRFJ46,"Shipping was pretty quick and the product arrived in perfect condition. I get the feeling that the dvds are bootlegged (just from little details here and there). But, everything worked fine and I'm happy.",1326412800,,204,5.029411764705882
4008173,5,B002WRFJ46,"If you've seen Chinese Idol dramas, you know the formula very well.  But this was adorable all around.

Ella of S.H.E is a natural as lead.  She's both adorable and naively sweet.  Wu Chun and Jiro of Fahrenheit are easy on the eyes and has great chemistry with the leading lady.  The series is funny, sweet and keeps you entertained through out.  I agree with another reviewer that the series does end on a rather abrupt note and that there was definitely potential for a second season that never came out, which was really too bad.  But the series doesn't leave you hanging as to where all the characters will eventually end up; so that's at least a plus side.  If you haven't seen it and would like a light fluffy series, this is one for you.",1286755200,2,745,4.386861313868613

4008175,5,B002WRFJ46,"Hilarious series, and Ella's (RuiXie) expressions are priceless.  The other two main characters are played by members from the Taiwanese musical group, Fahrenheit. I would recommend this to anyone who is sick of American TV, likes chick flicks or old school tv shows like Save By the Bell, and is interested in other cultures.  You will love all the characters just as much as the characters in the Japanese TV version of Hana Kimi (Hanazakarino Kimitachihe).  The only negative is that this series ends in a very unsatisfying way.  The intention was to have 2 seasons, and they never started a second season.  They have a season finale, but it does not do the book series of Hana Kimi justice.  Also, the box says episodes 1-23(end).  There are 15 episodes, and the reason for the numbering is that they combined 2 or 3 episodes into one to get rid of commercials.  If you have 15 episodes, you have the complete season.  Still great though.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hana-Kimi-Vol-1-For-You-In-Full-Blossom-v-1/dp/1591163293/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hana-Kimi, Vol. 1: For You In Full Blossom (v. 1)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Romantic-Princess-Taiwan-TV-drama-with-English-subtitle-NTSC-All-region-Dvd/dp/9745101664/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Romantic Princess Taiwan TV drama with English subtitle NTSC All region Dvd</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Butterfly-Lover-Standard-Edition-DVD/dp/B001O4VECE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Butterfly Lover (Standard Edition) DVD</a>",1264896000,9,1612,7.1421319796954315
8383376,5,B002WRFJ46,"Love this version! I know some that say the other versions are more accurate ( and that may very well be true ) and therefore better. However, as someone who saw this before ever seeing the others, I have to say it is still a very good story on it's own. Not all versions of a story have to be a mirror copy of the original. But, anyways, back to the review. Quite enjoyable! The actors are really good at making this a very delightfully funny show! I also realy like that there are ""behind the scenes"" extras. Such as, a few bloopers and getting to see how they filmed some of the scenes. Overall, if you like these kind of shows, I recommend you give this one a try.",1481068800,,668,4.1461538461538465
8383377,4,B002WRFJ46,The item was fine but without Eng sub. So I returned it.,1425081600,,56,3.75
8383378,3,B002WRFJ46,"in some of the episodes the translation is off (like very off, not close, but far off) Some parts are even not translated. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the story line.",1422316800,,162,4.620689655172414
8383379,5,B002WRFJ46,"I loved it, it was awesome. It came in pristine condition and was just as funny as I remember it being. The only thing that I was disappointed in was that all the awesome special features about the making of Hana Kimi were without subtitles, so I could watch it and not understand a word of it. Not that it's really bad, it's just frustrating that I can't understand what Ella and the others are saying behind the camera.

Still, it was amazing! Anyone who loves the manga, should definitely watch this one!",1406505600,,507,4.451612903225806
8383380,5,B002WRFJ46,"I love this one, I know it's more for teens, but the chemistry between Ella and Wu Zun(they were dating at the time)it's palpable, the way they look into each other eyes made me sigh, subs are good.",1396483200,,198,4.2368421052631575
8383381,5,B002WRFJ46,"This drama series was adapted from the Japanese manga Hana Kimi and it is really well done. The names are pronounced differently, but they are pretty spot on with the story.",1395792000,,173,4.612903225806452
8383382,5,B002WRFJ46,"After watching both dramas, I can say that the Taiwanese version is better than the Japanese version in all aspects.

First and foremost, the Japanese version seemed very cold. This version is much more light hearted (thanks to Jiro Wang, the music, and the overall set/clothing design) and has more ""romance"" parts than the Japanese version, which of course isn't anything spectacular seeing how most Asian dramas treat a simple kiss like the most shocking moment in history.",1393718400,,476,5.102564102564102
8383383,5,B002WRFJ46,This is the very first drama I've ever watched and it is one of my favorites. The actors are great and the drama is beyond cute. It was delivered on time and in a clean and neat package. I recommend this drama to everyone!,1384819200,,222,4.068181818181818
8383384,5,B002WRFJ46,The Hanazakarino Kimitachihe (Hua Yang Shao Nian Shao Nu) Taiwan TV Drama with English Sub is a very cute and funny drana show. About a girl going to an all boys school as a boy.,1370822400,,178,4.114285714285714
8383385,5,B002WRFJ46,This is one of my fave asian tv shows.  I also love the japanese version of this show. Unfortunately there is only one season of this show.  Japan is making a new series of this show last i had heard with new actors. i hope it is good.,1329523200,,235,3.875
