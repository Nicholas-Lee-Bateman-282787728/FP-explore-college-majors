8404254,5,B003SFKT6Y,"I love Rudy Maxa, he does such a great job describing and showing the best of every region he visits.  His quiet and laid back manner make you feel like you are there.  You also got a great history lesson about the region.  His travel DVD's have allowed me to see and experience the sights and history of places I will never get to travel to but at least I know what some of it looks like and more about the area.  Some have even inspired me to travel to a destination based on his review.  He also give good information on where to stay but I would not be as brave when it comes to sampling the local foods.  I will leave that to him.  I hope he continues his travels and keeps putting out new editions as he returns to familiar places or tries new ones.  He provides a much more sophisticated experience than Rick Steeves and also he visits more exotic places that just Europe.",1353974400,3,879,4.190476190476191
8404255,1,B003SFKT6Y,"I'm not good at writing professional sounding reviews, but I do like to share my opinion on products from time to time...

This dvd set includes a lot of beautiful places - places I was really interested in seeing. However, for me, these dvd's left a lot to be desired. I had read several good comments about this host, and felt that it would be a good purchase, but..well...it wasn't really for me. I felt there was too much emphasis on religion, and not enough seeing of the sites. It's not that I mind hearing info on religion, but I just thought more emphasis would be on destinations, sites, etc. Also, there seemed to be a lot of bias when viewing different religions. Some were viewed open mindedly (and lingered on and on), and others were quick to receive some cynical comment. I prefer a more professional and respectful attitude. But as I said, there could have been a lot less on religion as a whole. There is some pretty scenery, some neat facts on tea, and a variety of food, but I didn't feel like I saw much of anything on any of these countries, and I will be getting rid of this dvd set. Hopefully I can find a more fulfilling dvd set covering these countries. I was disappointed with this as a whole.",1316217600,7,1219,4.393805309734513
