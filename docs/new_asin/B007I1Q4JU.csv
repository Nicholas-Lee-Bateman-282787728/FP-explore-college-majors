5087562,5,B007I1Q4JU,"Though not a well-known picture, ""...tick...tick...tick..."" is, in my opinion, the one of the two most even-handed treatments of the subject of racism that I have seen thus far (the other is ""In The Heat of the Night"").
The main characters are well-rounded -- a lot of other more widely-known pictures on the same subject tend to lack this quality.  White people as well as black people are treated as, well, people -- persons who have within them the propensity to be good, decent human beings when, as one minor character says, ""we begin to understand each other.""
The picture also demonstrates (correctly) that racism knows no color.  The black man that Jim Brown's character arrests for rape is filled with just as much hate as the klansman sitting in the cell across the way from him, a reminder that mankind also has the propensity to be monsters, regardless of race.
As the title suggests, the tension can be felt at the get-go and steadily builds all the way to the climax.  It has a very satisfying ending, although it gives a reminder at the end that there are many battles in the war over bigotry (the sheriff's wife is only slightly relieved when she hears her husband is okay and is coming home ""this time."")",1244505600,7,1221,4.643518518518518

5087604,4,B007I1Q4JU,"Ordinarily, I would not and HAVE not paid this much for a movie as old as this one.  If it were available on VHS tape, and if the tape were in very good or better condition, I would not have bought it on DVD and paid so high a price for it.
However, all of the above conditions were and ARE not the way it is  I saw this movie on cable tv not too long ago.  I saw it on 'regular' TV many years before that.  Jim Brown is a better actor than most people give him credit.  The performance he and the others, like Frederic March and George Kennedy gave was just marvelous.  Clifton James.... just fine in a supporting role.  The DVD is still in its case, unopened.  I can only hope there will be no problem WHEN I decide to open it and play the movie.",1476921600,,748,3.94

5087627,5,B007I1Q4JU,This movie was shot in Sutter and Colusa counties in Northern CA.  The court house is in the city of Colusa and still stands.  The bridge was over the Wadsworth Canal in Sutter Co. outside the small community of Sutter.  The ironwork was added to the bridge to resemble a Southern bridge.  It was removed after filming. I enjoy watching it to see local the areas.  The movie was well acted.,1427673600,,390,4.436619718309859

5087630,5,B007I1Q4JU,"I saw this movie in the 70's while in the service and enjoyed it very much. Jim Brown made several good movies back then. The movie was interesting because it was made at a time when racial attitudes in the south were beginning to change. As we all know, no matter what it is sometimes change can be difficult. I'm happy to say that I own a copy of this movie....and you should too.",1423094400,,382,4.175675675675675
5087631,5,B007I1Q4JU,tick...tick...tick... is a classic movie i always liked this movie Jim Brown is very good in this movie i also like the all star cast they are all very good in this classic from 1969.,1422316800,,183,4.257142857142857
5087632,1,B007I1Q4JU,"If ever a movie didn't live up to it's title Tick...Tick...Tick... is it.  It's a race parable about what happens when a black man gets elected sheriff in a small town in the deep south.  He locks up a white man for manslaughter after his drunken driving kills a six year old white girl but his evil white daddy and others from the next county aren't going to let a black man keep their white boy in jail, even if he is a killer.

If director Ralph Nelson had simply done the obvious and made this film a Rio Bravo redux with racial tensions thrown in it might have been good, maybe even worthy of it's ticking time bomb title.  Unfortunately Nelson is more interested in teaching lessons than creating a suspenseful film--Tick...Tick...Tick...is mostly clumsy drama with occasional inappropriate comedy, and if that wasn't bad enough the movie also features the most tension defusing soundtrack imaginable, nearly wall to wall.

This was the period when studios were still trying to turn Jim Brown into a movie star but he never really got the acting thing down--a couple years later he would be making schlock for American International.  Here he's earnest as hell but just too wooden.  Frederick March is a hoot as the secretly not very racist mayor and George Kennedy actually gives one of his better performances as the sheriff who got voted out of office but has a hard time reconciling his respect for law and order with the easier path of simply standing by and letting the new black sheriff get killed.

The film culminates in an image of the racist good old boys of the town standing behind their black sheriff that seems ridiculous and naive today--if you wanted to be very generous I suppose you could say that the movie was overly optimistic.  Director Ralph Nelson made the even worse I'm-gonna-use-the-western-to-critique-Viet-Nam-flick Soldier Blue the same year--watching them back to back could be the film buff version of spending the night in a haunted house, a challenge that would surely try the sanity and patience of anyone with a healthy regard for good movies.",1421884800,,2086,4.804469273743017

5087646,5,B007I1Q4JU,"although a bit dated by today's standards the film serves as sort of a 'poor man's' In the Heat of the Night. A small little town in the deep south has elected an African American as sheriff over the long serving ""good ol"" boy white sheriff. The town is divided strictly along racial lines and tranquility teeters on the edge when the black sheriff arrests a priviliged son of a power wielding white man from a neighboring county. The story is cliche' at times but the solid acting of former NFL great Jim Brown helps make it an entertaining and worthwhile film. The superb supporting work of George Kennedy and a minor role for hollywood icon Fredric March round out of a fine cast that includes Clifton James,Don Stroud,Mills Watson and another former pro football player Bernie Casey turn in solid efforts. I saw this in a theatre when i was just a kid and i was glad to buy it on DVD as my old VHS recording taken off the tv,was falling apart.",1413331200,,947,4.448275862068965

I was expecting sub-par quality because I wasn't sure how well this older movie could transfer to DVD.  But, the quality is simply wonderful!

5087651,4,B007I1Q4JU,"I saw this film when I was a child and thought it was an effective portrayal of the old south back in the late 1960's and you will be surprised to learn the filming never got within a couple thousand miles of the south, it was filmed in Northern California. Jim Brown gives a convincing performance as the newly elected sheriff of an unknown southern state. George Kennedy delivers his usual high standard of acting, as the outgoing sheriff, who is caught between his bitterness at losing and doing the right thing. A great cast of character actors fills out the roster. The story is a bit thin at times, but the actors more than overcome these shortcomings and at the end everyone pulls together to protect the county from an outside threat.",1402704000,,742,4.586466165413534

5087657,5,B007I1Q4JU,"This is one of my favorite movies!  The casting was superb and the acting great!  This story is one of societal tension in a small Southern town as the changing times of the early 1960's bring about a radical turn of events. The main players are hot headed traditionalist wanting to make trouble against the  cool tempered new leadership in town.  As the plot develops it becomes clear that if people do not come together for the good of the town, things will become very bad for all!

He says the music is not the original (I wouldn't know but it is a bit on the corny side) but it is a decent movie depicting racism and the issues blacks and whites faced when beginning to ""break the mold"". It is not violent although the civil rights movement is a serious topic in American history and many films of this type can tend to be. Fredric March provides comic relief, his acting is a true jewel in this film.

5087676,5,B007I1Q4JU,"I remember watching this movie at the theater when I was in high school during the 70's. Growing up in the deep south, I could identify with Jim Price character played by Jim Brown. The overall theme throughout the movie was just a guy trying to do his job in a hostile environment with little or no help. The background music was a bit too ""folksy"" for me, but the acting is top-notch by Jim Brown, George Kennedy, and Fredrick March. Listening to March trying to do a southern accent was hilarious. I recorded this movie off my local television station back in the 90's. I was glad to find it was on DVD. The DVD transfer was a good as it could be for a 40+ year old movie. I thought this movie was not as good as ""In The Heat Of The Night"" with Rod Steiger and Sidney Poitier, but very well done in any case.",1345075200,15,811,4.139240506329114

5087679,1,B007I1Q4JU,"We loved this old movie and had it on an old VHS from 20 years ago that was beginning to fade away, so we jumped at the chance to get it in DVD format, expecting it to be sharp, clear, and original. It was a far cry from that. We played it the same day we received it and were appalled at the poor quality re-recording that looked homemade. Glitches and skips some blurry scenes, and the entire music soundtrack had been obliterated and replaced with incredibly bad bits that did not fit the movie at all, and was extremely irritating. The original soundtrack was wonderful and contained songs by Tompall and the Glaser Brothers and others that provided nearly half of the enjoyment of the movie. The new stuff was awful, and they constantly inserted  bits of ""Look Away Dixieland"" over and over, which did not fit with the theme of the movie. We would never watch this DVD again. All of these nasty problems ruin the movie. If you loved the original, this one will make you sick. Buyer beware!

And look at the price!! I feel completely ripped off with this horrible transfer.

That said, the movie itself is very good. Directed by Ralph Nelson whose most famous movie is ""Lilies of the Field"", it is a poor man's ""In the Heat of the Night.""
