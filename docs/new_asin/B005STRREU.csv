Love how it talks about the channel when it first started out, and talks about the show's as well!. And give's some fun trivia!. It made me laugh as well!. I love fox news!.",1521763200,,302,4.206896551724138
8485502,5,B005STRREU,Fox News is top news as far as I'm concerned.  They do lean to the right but we need this type of reporting.  Way too much left leaning  in the Main Stream news and other cable networks.,1381276800,2,186,3.972972972972973
