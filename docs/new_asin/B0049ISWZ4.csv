8419103,5,B0049ISWZ4,"I was looking for some instruction and drill ideas on coaching my daughters 1st and 2nd grade volleyball team.  I played high school volleyball but with no experience coaching girls so young, I wanted to make sure I was presenting proper technique while building skills in a fun, age appropriate way.  This video was pretty much the only one I found for this age group and I am very glad I made the purchase.  The video covers all of the basics, with good instruction on each skill/drill--presented in chapters.  We brought a portable dvd player to practice and would show the girls a skill with the video instruction (kids this young need the visuals!) and view the kids on the dvd doing it-then try it ourselves. We have incorporated many of the drills into our practices and its great to see progress.  I specifically appreciated the pieces on footwork, fundamentals of passing, serving, and the scrimmage games that start with catch and throw (teaching the volley concept).  Anyone who has tried to coach 7 year old volleyball knows that keeping kids interested in half of the challenge!  Not a lot of volleys happening but its also amazing to see how quickly kids to grasp things like serving and can improve with good instruction. There are a few drills that require equipment that we didn't have (footwork web, box for jumping off of and then smaller balls for warming up to overhand serve/hitting)  but other than that, you can improvise or make do.  Long story short, if you are looking for strategy and drill ideas for coaching young volleyball players, this is a good purchase!",1354752000,2,1588,4.766423357664234
