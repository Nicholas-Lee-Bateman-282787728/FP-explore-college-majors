5973170,5,B00FAPPQCM,"Loved the story, loved the suspense, loved the camp.  If you're in to independent thrillers like this guy, then you're gonna have a good time with Trail of Blood.  The wife and I did a weekend marathon of indie gems and enjoyed this one the most.  Consider it recommended.",1386028800,3,272,4.510204081632653
5973171,1,B00FAPPQCM,"I am not going to give any spoilers, but here are a few reasons why you should skip this movie. The acting is poor. The script is very cheesy.  Five minutes into the movie there is a confrontation with the dumbest lines ever.  I knew immediately that I was in for a terrible movie. The first thing I heard from the person I saw the movie with was, "" this is so stupid, do you want to finish it tomorrow.""  The DVD cover here shows a man with an axe... Interesting because there's no axe in the movie.  This movie is really really bad. I won't give details because if you still want to see it that's up to you. You'll remember this review ten minutes in.  Do yourself a favor and rent this.",1386028800,2,689,4.111940298507463
5973172,5,B00FAPPQCM,Brilliant old school psychological horror! Dripping with mood and a great cameo by Robert Picardo. See it now! Independent filmmaking at its finest.,1385942400,3,148,5.478260869565218
5973173,5,B00FAPPQCM,"An excellent, good old-fashioned thriller set deep in the woods. Keeps the tension level high and the viewer on the edge of his/her seat!",1385942400,3,137,4.75
8613858,2,B00FAPPQCM,"Kind of boring, actually. Not what I expected at all. Was not worth a rental, although cheap.",1406851200,,93,4.529411764705882
8613859,4,B00FAPPQCM,"good story overall. with so many mistakes, that victims make in horror movies, you had to know there was going to be some killing on the way, but I was surprised time and again with who and when. the FX are shockingly effective only, like a shy virgin trying to flash her breasts you don't have time to see it, or from a distance that kept you safe.
A good value and entertaining.",1395878400,2,380,4.219178082191781
8613860,5,B00FAPPQCM,I recommend this movie highly  would watch . It again I love my bloody  movies LOL so . Much slicing and dicing LOL......,1394928000,,121,4.217391304347826
8613861,2,B00FAPPQCM,You hope for some entertainment but what you get is time spent on a movie that has no real story and really doesn't entertain unless your just that sick.,1390953600,,153,4.310344827586207
8613862,3,B00FAPPQCM,"I am always excited to check out a new 'Slasher flick"" but I would classify this as more of a psychological thriller with some  minor slashing involved.

The film itself was kind of all over the place with too many unnecessary characters and some very annoying characters to boot.
the acting was somewhat sketchy but ""Tim Barraco"" as Jim was a redeeming factor in the acting department. I thought he did a nice job with what he was given. On the other hand ""Trevor Torseth"" who is credited as (the Marine) was really annoying  and over acted although he either got better as the film progressed or I just got used to him. That was a shame seeing as he was in 9 /10ths of the film.

Trevor Torseth best known to horror fans for playing ""Kane Lake"" one of the mute inbred twins in the After Dark Horror Fest's film (Lake Dead ) I now see why they chose him to be mute!!

The story was your basic crazy person or people terrorize campers in the woods.there was some bloody violence but no real gore  ,the closest thing to it was some  gun shots a couple of stabbings and slit throats.what few effects they had were well done but just not enough. If you are going to use 'Trail Of Blood' as your film title and have someone with an Ax on the cover you might want to have someone with an ax in the film.

The beginning was promising then it went into a mundane lull until about the last 25 minutes where it picked up speed and got interesting .The climax was pretty exciting and made me feel better about  the money I paid for the rental. If you want to see a really good (crazy person or people terrorize campers in the woods) film check out ""Resurrection County"" ""The Hike"" or the Norwegian film 'Rovdyr"" the American title is Manhunt.",1388966400,2,1732,4.320987654320987
8613863,3,B00FAPPQCM,"I expected a little bit more out of this movie because of reviews I'd read in horror publications, but in the end it wasn't the psychological thriller mentioned in those reviews.  Not that slashers don't have a place, but if you're looking for more this isn't the movie for you.",1388707200,,278,4.56
8613864,1,B00FAPPQCM,"This ""film"" is garbage. Complete waste of time...nothing redeeming. Nothing...and that's being generous. STAY AWAY.  There aren't words to explain how bad this is.",1386979200,,163,5.791666666666667
8613865,2,B00FAPPQCM,"Lionsgate has done nobody a favor by releasing the catatonia-inducing slasher flick ""Trail of Blood."" Whoever tricked Joe Dante into putting his name on this should be awarded greatly. All we get here is a complete retread of every camping trip-gone-bad movie that's been forced on us since ""Friday the 13th"" hit theaters in 1980.

A group of friends head out on a weekend camping trip of drinking and debauchery. They've apparently never seen ""The Burning,"" any of the 12 ""Friday the 13th"" movies, or the countless other slasher movies warning them this is a bad idea. They stumble on a couple who have been brutally murdered. As they try to figure out what to do, the group find themselves being held captive by a crazed Marine and his bleach-blond girlfriend. The two believe the bunch are responsible for the deaths of the slaughtered couple and plan to make them pay for it.

Yes, ""Trail of Blood"" really is as ho-hum and forgettable as it sounds. There's absolutely nothing here to get excited about. It looks like it was shot with a typical HD camera that anyone could pick up at an electronics store. Granted, the shooting quality doesn't look like it was the cinematographer's first time behind a lens. I'd say probably their third or fourth. One good thing is it's not a ""found footage"" film.

The only star actor in ""Trail of Blood"" is Robert Picardo. He must have had a large traffic ticket to pay off or used this as a means to grab some extra cash to play with while in Vegas or something. All I can say is Picardo is much too good to be doing drivel like this. He does a great job lingering behind trees and looking menacing, though.

There are a couple extra features included for ""Trail of Blood."" Directors Joseph and Justin Guerrieri provide audio commentary. A trailer gallery is included as well.

""Trail of Blood"" is rated R for strong bloody violence, language, brief nudity, and drug use. In other words, it's just like every other slasher movie released in the past few decades. Why would they break the stale mold here of all places?

I love slasher movies and I really don't feel like I ask much when watching them. However, when it's so obvious that you're following a checklist of things to do with no inspiration to go outside of the box, I completely lose interest. If you're going to pay homage to the great gory thrillers of the 1970s and 1980s, at least try to add something new to the formula.",1386892800,,2428,4.582949308755761
8613866,3,B00FAPPQCM,I thought this was ok but I feel it drug on abit and I thought the ending was a bit unbelievable but overall it was a decent lowbudget flick,1386720000,,140,3.8620689655172415
8613867,2,B00FAPPQCM,"Young adults. Camping. Killer in woods. No phone reception. Been there, done that, passed on the t-shirt. The deja vu was painful.

The highlight of the film is when Jim (Tim Barraco) tells his girlfriend (Kandis Erickson) he is going into the Marines while she thinks he is going to ask her about tires or propose. The film gives us a number of suspects but no clues. Then when we do find out, the film remains boring.

Bad acting. Cheesy dialog. Not worth a Redbox rental.
