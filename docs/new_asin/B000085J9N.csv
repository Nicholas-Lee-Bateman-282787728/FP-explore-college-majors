We have visited nearly every lighthouse in Oregon, Washington and California and this is an excellent addition to his collection.  Thanks for a quality product (delivered in record time).",1152576000,2,290,4.918367346938775
7979205,5,B000085J9N,"My husband and I went to Oregon last summer and I remember seeing this video in the sea lion caves gift shop.  I regretted not getting it and am glad I found it at amazon.com.  For anyone who likes lighthouses or the Oregon Coast, this DVD is a real treat.  The quality and filming are exceptional.  There are nine lighthouses featured.  I enjoyed the narration because it included a lot of really interesting background information on each lighthouse such as the history of the lighthouses, how they were built, and the lenses. You can also run it on your computer if you have a DVD drive.",1042156800,8,590,4.528301886792453
