Very disappointing.  I'm an enormous fan of the radio program, but this is a lousy product.  These are poorly edited often missing beginnings of scenes due to a clip too close,  and it's too grainy for  something from 1955.  There are plenty of older programs and movies that have a better picture and sound.
 Your best bet is to watch these on YouTube on a small screen.",1483660800,2,400,4.549295774647887
