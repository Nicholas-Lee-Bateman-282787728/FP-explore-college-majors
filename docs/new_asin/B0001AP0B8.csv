8009318,1,B0001AP0B8,Very lousy copy. Moon over Harlem disc didn't play at all. Freedom song disc jumped around. Advised seller of my disappointment and my purchase was refunded. Lesson to be learned is let the buyer beware.,1481500800,,203,4.828571428571428

8009321,5,B0001AP0B8,"I really liked The Song of Freedom starring Paul Robeson (only about an hour's duration). If America wasn't so racist during the time it was made, it would be considered a classic today. You'll enjoy this movie if you like musicals. These are two dual disks enclosed in a protective case. I skipped the long BET introduction and went straight for the movies.",1385251200,,358,4.698412698412699
8009322,3,B0001AP0B8,There are four titles on this DVD but I am only interested in two.  However I still enjoyed those two.  I shall probably give the other CD away.  The two items that I enjoyed featured Paul Robeson so I shall be playing that disc again at regular intervals,1383436800,,255,4.270833333333333
