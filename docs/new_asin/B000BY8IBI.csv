8093917,5,B000BY8IBI,"Wim Wenders isn't for everyone. If you want lots of action or a conventional plot don't bother. But if you like movies that make you think and that take their time and veer off in unexpected directions Wim is the man and this is one of his best IMO. I saw it decades ago but it made a big impression and I still remember it. Its about the making of a science fiction film and he goes back and forth between the film in the making and the actors and production staff making it. There are interesting issues involved in both and its cool the way the issues in the movie within a movie reflect the issues in the real world.

I would love to see this again but its really hard to find. Not on Netflix or iTunes and only available here on Region 2.  Please Amazon get it for VOD or a region one DVD.",1315699200,3,794,4.050955414012739
8093918,5,B000BY8IBI,"Lisbon is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Who can deny it?. And Win Wenders becomes it as magnificent frame to tell us about an unfinished filmmaking project; disillusions, perspectives and intelligent dialogues that reveal an even more compicated issue: the life itself.

Samuel Fuller and Roger Corman two irreverent filmmakers, acceded to join Win about this somber but enriching existential dramatis personae.

The soundtrack is magnificent and somehow this film works out as a transitional which ties up ""The way the world ended"" and the future four hands work with Michelangelo Antonioni: ""Lisbon story""",1139961600,3,624,5.357142857142857
