7983656,4,B00008G8XW,"Fine B western apparently set in 1930's Arizona.  The title does not seem to have much to do with the movie.  Tim McCoy is an FBI agent investigating the disappearance/murder of two Secret Service men, the kidnapping of a Treasury Department  engraver and a counterfeiting gang.  Even though the plot has these modern elements, the gang's headquarters is in rural Arizona so horses, western attire and six guns abound.  The movie is a fine Tim McCoy vehicle with a good supporting cast.

For those who don't already know, Tim McCoy was much more than a Hollywood star.  He was a real cowboy as well as a ranch owner and an expert in Indian lore, speaking some Indian languages.  He refused to appear in films which were unsympathetic to Indians.  He served in both world wars, attaining the rank of colonel.  He also served as adjutant general of Wyoming with a brevet rank of brigadier general.",1510272000,,895,4.716129032258064

7983662,5,B00008G8XW,"Tim goes undercover (as usual) to get the goods on a counterfeit ring who has kidnapped an engraver to produce phoney bills. In fact, Tim McCoy seems to go undercover to trap the bad guys more than any other B-Western star. This time, as Tim Hayes he pretends he's an outlaw and robs a couple gang members of their bogus cash which he starts spreading around. There's a great cantina scene in which Tim grooves to the dancing of heroine Suzanne Kaaren who's also undercover trying to rescue her dad, the kidnapped engraver. Tim gyrating to the rather dull dance routine is a real hoot! Karl Hackett is great as usual as the gang leader, a position he's played countless times with slimy ease. John Merton and good ol' Charlie King are the top gang members and usual badguy Tom London is a peace officer this time around.
This is sure-fire entertainment on a decent looking disc from ALPHA DVD!
The image is pretty sharp and the sound is excellent. Highly recommended!",1218844800,,967,4.627906976744186
7983663,5,B00008G8XW,"""Phantom Ranger"" is a 1938 Tim McCoy B-Western. This review deals with the Alpha release, not the VCI product. Alpha releases of B-Western features may be described as ""inconsistent"" in terms of audio-video quality. Some are obviously derived from VHS copies where the quality of the video ranges from bearable to watch (i.e., Tim McCoy's ""Bulldog Courage"") to eye straining events (i.e. Tim McCoy in ""Aces and Eights""). Alpha hit it right the first time with Tim McCoy's ""Ghost Patrol"" and did it again with this ""Phantom Ranger"" release. The transfer is very good and clear, though some film deterioration is present in some scenes that appear ""over-exposed"". Looks like Alpha secured a ""good to better"" quality film copy from which this product was based on. The audio is clear and not muffled or difficult to discern. The use of a sepia tone adds that ""classic film"" quality. I adjusted the color on my TV set to see how it would look like if it were a pure black and white presentation but I reverted back to the sepia tone that I found more pleasing to watch. ""Phantom Ranger"" is just a few notches below the more expensive Paramount release of Tim McCoy's ""Texas Cyclone"" film. If you like B-Westerns starring Tim McCoy, get this one from Alpha. It's worth more for its price.",1145750400,2,1283,4.732142857142857
