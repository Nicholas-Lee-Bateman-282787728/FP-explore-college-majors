8602918,3,B00E98ZX06,"Well, anything by Donizetti, anything, anything is a must for me personally. The man had, like Handle a huge talent and produced a large volume of Opus.  Melodies galore, scores demanding really proficient singers, an Opera lover's nirvana.",1391558400,,240,5.315789473684211
8602919,4,B00E98ZX06,"I have been familiar with this opera for some time from a fine CD release of some years ago (http://www.amazon.com/Donizetti-Gianni-Parigi-Morino-Cillario/dp/B0000036AV/ref=sr_1_14?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1391273404&sr=1-14&keywords=gianni+di+parigi). I even had a bootleg video of a performance in Italy (pretty poor quality), but there has never been an official release. Therefore, this Bongiovanni DVD is extremely welcome to me and is a delight in all respects.

Story: The French Prince is contracted to marry the princess of Navarra, but, having  never met her, he desires to see his intended bride to determine whether he really wants to marry her. Therefore, he disguises himself as Gianni di Parigi and comes to the end where the story takes place. He persuades the innkeeper to rent him the entire inn, to the great distress of the princess  retainer who has arrived to make sure that everything is all set for the princess arrival. (One of the comic elements is his constant hunger and inability to actually eat a meal!) When the princess meets the disguised Gianni, she immediately realizes who he is but continues to play along as the comedy increases. Various twists and turns result, of course, in the happy couple declaring love to each other at the end. A delightful side story features the budding romance between Gianni's page (a trouser role) and the innkeeper's daughter. It all ends up in a dual wedding at the end. Finally, the other great roles are that of the innkeeper himself and the princesss retainer.

This opera is a warm, human comedy with delightful tunes, romantic interludes, and some great funny stuff. It compares very favorably to Donizetti's most famous opera Lelisir DAmore, in that it is of a similar warmth and comedic feel. This is a human and romantic comedy much like Lelisir. It is no surprise, as the libretto was written by the same person, Felici Romani, who is one of the greatest librettists. Now the music here is not as great as the other Donizetti masterpiece, which, in my opinion, is one of the greatest operas of all time. However, this opera has been seriously overlooked, and this DVD sets it in this rightful place as a major contribution by this great opera composer.

The most famous piece in the opera is the fantastic buffo duet between the innkeeper and the princess retainer which opens the second act. I love this piece from the CD that I have, and the  performance here is excellent. In fact, all the performances here are very well done. There is no singer with which I was previously familiar, but all the singers were fine and put on a truly wonderful performance.

Of particular note to me was the set which I thought worked extremely well as the outside and the veranda of the inn. All of the technical aspects of the DVD were fine with good filming an excellent sound.  I strongly recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys comic opera as this is an unknown and fantastic work by Mr. Donizetti. Don't miss it.",1391212800,6,2977,4.916334661354582
8602920,3,B00E98ZX06,"This is the first Donizetti opera I have experienced where I could see little sign of the quality the maestro was capable of writing. It, along with Francesca di Foix were the two works the composer stated that he never wished to see performed again. Written for the famous tenor, Rubini, it excited no tenorial interest from that worthy, and remained unperformed for several years. Charles Osborne (The Bel Canto Operas) called it a ""pleasant trifle"".

My first copy had come loose in the case and was scratched. Since loose discs are not uncommon when buying online, I was not surprised to see it loose but I have never seen that much damage, which makes me wonder about Bongiovanni's quality control. A plastics issue?

The performance was amateurish; while there was a lot of stage busyness, it was reminiscent of some of Dario Fo's manic work.

The singers were a mixed bunch. Soprano Ekaterina Lekhina had a shrill top and some serious pitch issues. Tenor Edgardo Rocha was ... adequate, but no more. Both baritones were good, as was mezzo Andrea Porta in her en travesti role of Pedrigo.

Picture was adequate, but in the age of HD, one might question the quality. And for heaven's sake, why stereo only sound, and badly miked sound at that.

At the premium price Bongiovanni charges, I think that the consumer deseves a better quality product.",1389139200,6,1351,4.781115879828326
8602921,4,B00E98ZX06,"This opera, a failure at its premiere, is formulaic but charming, and the cast does it proud.  The production blessedly steers clear of any temptation to overdo, make points, impose a production concept.",1389052800,2,203,5.151515151515151
8602922,3,B00E98ZX06,"Donizetti's music here is very far  below Don Pasqualle and Elixer  of Love.  The plot is so slight as to be boring.
The Prince  arrives before his bethrothed at an inn and pretends to be a bourgeoise gentleman.  The Princess in this  arranged marriage arrives, recognizes the prince and behaves graciously.  All is well.
The singers and orchestra are adequate, even good for a low budget production.  Unfortunately they, and the listeners, are very badly let down by poor sound engineering.  The engineering is so bad that it is unfair to judge the voices.  Poor camerawork, poor subtitles and a ""letterboxed""  picture had us breath a sigh of relief when the opera was over.  Bongiovanni's DVDs are too often a let down.  By bringing out carelessly done  DVDs  they do not  well serve these rarely done operas.",1386633600,15,811,4.810218978102189
