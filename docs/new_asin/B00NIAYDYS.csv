8678424,4,B00NIAYDYS,"English WWII film meant to raise spirits.  They outsmart the nazis in help some airmen escape.  Good enough movie but hard to take it seriously when one knows what was actually happening in the prison camps of Germany.  Nothing like the civilized treatment that the film, made during the war in 1944, portrays.  Hard to watch with knowledge of history.",1405814400,,352,4.816666666666666
