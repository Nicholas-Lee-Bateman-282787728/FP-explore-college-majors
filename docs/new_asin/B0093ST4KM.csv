8535352,3,B0093ST4KM,A lot of fuss and I was disappointed,1416355200,,36,3.625
8535353,1,B0093ST4KM,"Be careful with this purchase.  The need for a region free player was well noted but if you require English subtitles, there are none in this DVD version.  It is a great movie.  I did see it on the big screen which did have English subtitles.",1409788800,,242,4.217391304347826
8535354,5,B0093ST4KM,"Enjoyable. Entertaining. Feel good movie, yes. An lots of insights on the chefs of the world atmospheres, tantrums and anxieties.

There are no killings, no sex, no Finantial conspiracies, no secret service operations. Sheer human warmth against obstacles of natural human adulthood. Comedy kept alive with some slapstick. Characters well drawn without too much depth, although with greater sensitivity that you could have find in Julia and Julie . If you look for Bergman or ken loach, keep searching.
Written by a collector of movies related with food and cooking, as chocolate, Babette's, la grandebouffe and many, many others.",1358640000,5,630,5.363636363636363
8535355,2,B0093ST4KM,"This is a cliche fest from the very start, a light and slight offering about a veteran chef battling the new owners of his restaurant, who want him to offer more modern dishes. He is about to give up in despair when he stumbles across a gifted yet wayward amateur chef, who happens to be a great fan of the old man's. The two of them unite forces and blah blah blah. Seriously. This lacks any sense of originality whatsoever and is marred by some poor performances.",1356480000,,465,4.35632183908046
8535356,4,B0093ST4KM,"In French comedy ""Comme un chef"" Jean Reno plays Alexandre Lagarde, a veteran chef of a three-star restaurant, who is now in danger of losing a star in the next edition. The new owner of the restaurant, who thinks Alexandre's menus are too old-fashioned, wants to replace him with a younger chef specializing in ""molecular food."" And Alexandre cannot come up with a new recipe for the next season.

Help comes in an unexpected form when Alexandre encounters Jacky Bonnot (Michal Youn), a wannabe cook whose ego gets in the way when he should be silent in the kitchen. Jacky is overjoyed to accept his hero Alexandre's offer and starts working for his restaurant, but is unable to confess that to his girlfriend Beatrice (Raphaelle Agogue), who is led to believe that Jacky has stopped chasing his dream of becoming a chef.

This is a light-hearted comedy taking a few jabs at some movements in the industry. The film's story takes a turn for farce with Jean Reno disguised as a Japanese samurai (yes, you heard it right) in a jaw-droppingly silly sequence in a molecular restaurant. Spanish actor Santiago Segura also appears as an eccentric molecular food specialist.

But the driving force of the uneven but delightful comedy (of which story reminds us of Pixar's ""Ratatouille"") is the portrait of characters played by Jean Reno and Michal Youn, and their credible master-apprentice relationship. Unlike Linguini, a ""garbage boy"" Remy the gourmet mouse teams up with, Reno's Alexandre is already a TV celebrity who has his own TV show. Youn's Jacky, discontent with the way his favorite dish is cooked, offers some ""advice"" to his master.

The result is predictable, and so is the film's storyline itself. And it works, thanks to the great chemistry between the stars. ""Comme un chef"" is a comedy as light as souffl, and is funny and entertaining.",1356134400,3,1849,4.89776357827476
