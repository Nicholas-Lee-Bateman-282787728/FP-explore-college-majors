8167512,5,B000MAAJGS,"THIS IS THE EXTENDED LENGTH VERSION OF THIS DVD TITLE - RUNNING TIME IS 70 MINUTES...AN OUTSTANDING PRESENTATION BY KEN HAM AND POSSIBLY THE MOST IMPORTANT MESSAGE HE'S EVER DELIVERED.
Do you wonder why people don't listen anymore when you present the gospel?  Could it be because you are starting in the middle of the message?  This revolutionary message has already opened the eyes of thousands of Christians showing why the traditional methods of evangelism are not reaching today's humanistic, evolutionized culture. By applying proven methods as found in the Scriptures, this DVD will revolutionize your personal and group witnessing. A lot of time and money is spent by Christians who have a passion to spread the gospel. Across the globe, this effort is paying off as seekers find Christ, the source of truth and peace. In many cultures, though, appeals made on behalf of the Christian faith are met with blank stares, indifference, even mocking hostility. Ken Ham, one of Christendom's most astute observers of evangelism, is convinced that compromise with evolutionary worldviews has virtually crippled preaching and teaching efforts, especially in Western societies.",1346716800,,1176,5.351351351351352
