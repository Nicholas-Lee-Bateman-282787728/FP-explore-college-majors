8437273,5,B004OQJSHM,"I love Ealing films of all kinds, especially the comedies, but Ealing also made a lot of films that were more dramatic in nature, and this is no exception.

It is set in a rural part of Wales called Cwmbach, a place that in reality doesn't exist, to my knowledge anyway.

The story is centered around the pub and B & B called 'the Halfway House' and it involves a place that was bombed a year before but somehow still exists. There are a number of people all visiting at the same time, including a famous conductor who has very terminal health, a divorcing couple and their daughter and a sea captain and his wife who have lost their son in the war, to name but some of the visitors there. As the film unfolds, we find out by clues that the proprietors of the pub are not what they seem, but we also find out that the problems of each person gets either solved or they are helped to resolve what they are going through.

I must add that wherever it was filmed it is beautiful scenery and where the Halfway House is situated is the place that many of us dream of going from time to time, a lonely wooded valley miles from anywhere and far from the madding crowd.

I highly recommend this film if you like Ealing films and if you like films that have a sense of moral rightness and just a feel-good movie that is a little off the beaten track.",1370304000,3,1341,4.206225680933852
