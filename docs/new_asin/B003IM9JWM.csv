4127358,5,B003IM9JWM,"This movie definitely deserves to be watched - and to be rated (by those having watched it!)!

It is absolutely funny, sometimes makes you laugh out loud, sometimes simply makes you shake your head delightedly. It is different from any other movie I have seen so far and has been one of my favourite movies of the last 5 years at least. If you need comparisons: The one with the Coen Brothers is probably one of the best. One particular movie that came to my mind while watching ""TH"" was ""Very bad things"" - maybe that helps...

Terribly happy has a great story,  told in a rather slow tempo, the main characters are very well developed - but whenever you think you know them, there'll be something happening, that makes the whole thing turn into another direction. Very psychological, strange, sometimes irritating, on the other hand beautifully photographed, always surprising, simply lovable and most of all damn funny - that's what ""Terribly happy"" is!!!

4127361,4,B003IM9JWM,"Not to sure why the title of this Danish film translates as Terribly Happy, unless it's because the main character a police officer being transferred to this small rural farming town and every single towns person is terribly unhappy and the title is just playing on that.  It's a dark film, similar sort of plot to Hot Fuzz but not so much a comedy.  Basically a police officer who used to work in Copenhagen is sent to this town due to events that happened back there that you'll learn about near the end of the film.  He doesn't want to be there, that's pretty obvious to the locals and in case they missed it, he isn't averse to telling them he's only there temporarily.  The locals live by their own rules and expect him to pick up the same role that the former town police officer did such as when the shopkeeper catches a kid stealing he wants the kid given a quick beating to deter him from doing it again, but not to file a complaint.  The town bully openly backarms a kid across the face a few times right in front of him and warns him off interacting with his wife who he says make up stories.  She says he beats her and the town folk tells him whenever their little girl pushes a squeaky pram around town that's what happening back home.

There's plenty of muddy boot action, not a lot of gun action, some people do die though.  It's a dark film worth watching that has a few light moments. If you don't mind reading a good movie this isn't a bad choice.",1447718400,,1465,4.263537906137184

Viggo Mortensen, Mads Mikkelsen, Connie Nielsen, and film director Nicolas Winding Refn.  Terribly Happy is a film about a cop who suffers mental breakdown in his home town of Copenhagen and consequently is transferred to a small village, where there are more cows than people.  The tiny town holds its own dark secrets...and its citizens have their own way of executing justice.  Long story short, the new deputy of the village gets unintentionally mixed up in private affairs of some of the villagers, after which the story unfolds like in a twilight-zone...

4127371,4,B003IM9JWM,"Wow! I think this is another proof that good cinema isn't about big budget or famous stars or extraordinary settings. I'll sum up the plot by saying that we all have our little secrets. Robert Hansen, after having been to therapy, is assigned to a small town in Denmark. There he meets and gets involved in a series of situations thanks to inhabitants of the town, who have their own concept of the law. Unexpected twists and odd characters are introduced throughout the film until the very end, where ""let him who is without sin cast the first stone"" shows that there is more than meets the eye in all human beings.

I didn't give this film 5 stars because, at the beggining, the film states that it is based on a true story. However, how did this true story finished?

4127374,5,B003IM9JWM,"Frygtelig Lykkelig (Terribly Happy) is a thoroughly enjoyable Danish film set in the remote South Jutland border town of Skarrild starring some of Denmark's finest acting talent. Fans of the original (Danish) version of The Killing will recognise two of the main players Jakob Cedergren (Phillip Dessau in The Killing 1) who stars as policeman Martin Hansen and Kim Bothnia (Bulow in The Killing 1) who has the role of Jrgen Buhl. Lars Brygmann (Rejseholdet and Forsvar) stars as Dr Zerlang.

Tightly wound policeman Robert Hansen (Cedergren) is transferred from Copenhagen to Skarrild after a mental breakdown and an initially unspecified infraction. In Skarrild the clannish locals dislike by-the-book law enforcement, relying instead on their own unique brand of frontier justice, and outsiders either adapt or disappear. Skarrild's main police business appears to be shoplifting. We meet a femme fatale - oversexed Ingerlise (Lene Marie Christensen), a bully of a drunk, a doctor of dubious ethics and a bog where inconvenient secrets are sent to die.

My favourite part of the film was the drinking showdown between Martin and Jrgen - pretty different to your average twist. The story leaves you guessing at every turn. One question which lingers throughout is whether or not Dr Zerlang will find a fourth member of his card club.

4127376,4,B003IM9JWM,"A Copenhagen cop (Robert) is sent to an isolated town (Skarrild) because he pulled a gun on his wife and her lover. Robert resigns himself to 'serving out his time' while being a good policeman, then returning to his former job. However, he soon becomes involved with a domestic violence situation involving an attractive woman who cannot tear herself away from her abusive husband, or even file a police report on him. Eventually this 'Russian roulette' results in her accidental death at Robert's hands - he's trying to silence her loud moaning after they have sex while her husband is looking for him, and ends up suffocating her. However, viewers also learn that the local physician (self-described 'Dr. Quack') has also given her an overdose of pills. To cover up both his own and Robert's complicity Dr. Quack issues a death certificate citing heart failure as the cause. This absolves the abusive husband of any responsibility, but the town also realizes they are all contributing factors for failing to do anything about the on-going abuse. The townspeople try to assuage their guilt by marching the husband into the bog - to be sucked under; policeman Bob, however, rescues the husband.

The abusive husband eventually figures out that Robert killed his wife, and seeks revenge. Robert then shoots and kills the husband. Neighboring police investigate, and whitewash Robert's involvement. Thinking he's off the hook Robert prepares to leave, only to be confronted by three townspeople (including Dr. Quack) who reveal that they know the entire story, and will leak details unless he stays.

4127378,3,B003IM9JWM,"The opening sequence of 'Terribly Happy' is a glorious montage of the flat Danish Countryside - as bleak and dead as any early-Winter day in the upper Mid-Western United States - and a gravel voice describing a surreal yet absorbing legend associated with the land.  This tale obliquely illuminates actions still to come, though as with any real attempt to peer into human behavior, the explanation may sound elliptical to some viewers.  Still, the effect is mostly positive until one remembers that the combination of images and words at the beginning of 'Terribly Happy' bear a startling resemblance to the Coens' 'No Country for Old Men', with, I assume, the same intended result.  But while Tommy Lee Jones occasionally hits a false note in his delivery, the voice from 'Terribly Happy', Puk Scharbau, rings true throughout.  This may be from unfamiliarity with the language - a native Dane might find objections to Mr. Scharbau's narration that an English speaker can not, but overall, 'Terribly Happy' does suffers somewhat due to the proximity of the two films' release dates, even if this particular technique originated long before 'No Country'.

It is worth the extra time describing the opening of the film - it is its best part.  Cinematographer Jrgen Johansson, under the direction of Henrik Ruben Genz, provides all of the film's high points - this is a nicely photographed film, approaching excellent, even in such a stark and bleak environment -  and while his work doesn't make the film a 'must-see', it certainly elevates the entire production.  And there is no issue with the acting chores - leads Jakob Cedergren and Lene Maria Christensen fully inhabit their characters, as do the remarkable faces of the town, which seem as though they could have been plucked from any rural scene and inserted into the film.  What does strain believability is the script - and the unfortunate choice to place the words 'This story is based on actual events' at the beginning of the film.

Copenhagen police officer Robert Hansen is re-assigned to the tiny town of Skarrild near the Danish-German border after catching his wife en flagrante delicto with a fellow officer, and pulling a gun on them both.  While the town, at first glance, appears peaceful, it doesn't take long for Hansen the outsider to see its darker underside.  Eventually he becomes embroiled in a domestic dispute, and he slowly sinks into the landscape that has already swallowed the rest of the town.

While the overall themes of 'Terrible Happy' are interesting and worth exploring, too often the characters' actions aren't quite justified by the on screen events, and Marshall Hansen continually leaps into ill-advised situations.  In fact, his actions are almost ludicrous at times - it isn't as though people don't get themselves caught up in stupid situations, but the film has a difficult time making it a seamless transition as the Marshall goes from bad decision to worse.  This will be a contentious point, on which the film hinges - those viewers who find Marshall Hansen's actions believable should really enjoy it, other will consider it a serious flaw.

Another complaint is that the filmmakers chose to tell the audience that the film was based on actual events.  Although true to a certain extent, it reminds me of the French film 'The Last Deadly Mission' (MR 73), in that the 'actual events' are really just a minor subset of the film.  In the French movie, I kept wondering how the film could be based on true events when almost every cop movie clich I know of was used.  Here, in 'Terribly Happy', the film is structured in a way that it's difficult to believe the 'actual events' could have ever come to light.  The upshot is that it is distracting to me - instead of focusing solely on the film, a part of my attention is trying to resolve what I'm seeing with what these 'actual events' could have been.  After a small bit of research, it seems that the actual events were more of an inspiration for the story, which in the end, is fabrication.  In the sense it's used here, all movies could be considered based on actual events, as all movies deal in some way with human interactions.

To me, this is a borderline film, but not a wasted effort - those who don't agree with my critiques will probably have high praise for the film.  The DVD cover, while technically a still from the film, over-emphasizes a level of violence that really isn't present.  This is more of a thriller, though there are a few intense scenes that would put this into at least a PG-13 category, if not R.  The combination of the deeply ironic title and the cover image may suggest something in the vein of Quentin Tarrentino's films, but that doesn't capture the feel of this film at all.  Instead, it is mostly reminiscent of two other Coen films, 'Fargo' and 'Blood Simple' - both of which also used painful irony to illuminate human frailty.

'Terribly Happy' is recommended for those who generally shy away from foreign films, as it dwells on universal themes and is presented in a style much more familiar to American viewers.  And even though I feel the film ultimately doesn't live up to its potential, it's still head and shoulders above the generic output of most studios.  Three and a half stars, rounded down for the distracting caveat, 'This story is based on actual events'.",1289692800,4,5363,4.804134929270947
4127379,5,B003IM9JWM,"This Danish thriller was compelling from the very start.  A narrator tells us a story about this remote Danish village where it rains so much that cows can be swallowed up by bogs.  Once, after a very nasty storm, a pregnant cow was found in one of those bogs.  This cow gave birth to a calf with two heads: one a cow head and one a human head.  The farmer kept this calf anyway and hid it away but after all the women in the village went mad and several cows died, the strange cow was killed by the villagers and then everything went back to normal.  Or as normal as things get for this town....

We flash to a young cop from Copenhagan who is being sent to a remote village as a punishment. The very atmospheric shots provided by the camera already makes us think twice about this town and the introdction to its inhabitants only confirms our fears that something is not quite right.  The young cop quickly runs into the attractive yet troubled wife of the local bully.  We soon learn that the cop is hiding some secrets of his own as we discover the reason behind his banishment; but, the viewer still pulls for him to find a way back to Copenhagen while surviving the very dangerous waters of this town.  The chilling under current is as deadly as the local bogs.

All of the characters in this film were interesting.  The funeral eulogy was enlightening as the mourners are told that yes, the deceased had a hard life that we all knew about but not to blame themselves because the person was very difficult after all.  Hmmm.  We watch as the cop struggles to keep his integrity despite what was going on around him.

I highly recommend this film who anyone who doesn't mind reading subtitles.  It was one of the best thrillers I have seen in a long time.  This film keeps your attention to the very end.  This film presents the Danish version of what goes on in remote villages.  Very creepy.  And oh, it's based on a true story....",1285200000,,1937,4.360335195530726
4127380,5,B003IM9JWM,"The U.S. DVD box art is misleading but the movie itself is compelling and original.

Make no mistake; I was hugely entertained and unsettled by this darkish dramedy from Denmark.  I think it played for a week a few months ago at Palm d'Or, but has been pretty much overlooked in its American theatrical run.  I suppose ""swamp noir"" would be a more fitting genre for this tale about Robert Hansen (Jacob Cedergren), a cop from Copenhagen who is trying to re-establish his life and career after being transferred to a small town far from any hint of modern city life and the incident that nearly destroyed his career.

Doing his best to be a good cop, he eventually becomes mired and seduced by the apparently uncivilized and bizarre behavior of the town's unusual residents.

Like many other who found and love this film, I was reminded of the Coen brothers first movie BLOOD SIMPLE and David Lynch's BLUE VELVET.  I highly recommend this witty thriller, although it is not for all tastes.

I just stumbled onto it and missed the first ten minutes, but as a HUGE Hot Fuzz fan I can honestly say I enjoyed it, even all the ""similarities"". The basics are the same; city cop sent to rural town which has a very murky, murderous side. The difference is this movie takes it to a darker point, is more dramatic and without the in your face laugh out loud moments; instead it has quiet, narky, silly and often uncomfortably funny moments that not everyone will understand/appreciate. The direction is solid but naturally not up to Edgar Wright's standard, but it really is an excellent movie in its own right. whether you're a fan of HF or not, it really is worth seeing.",1283126400,2,741,4.416058394160584

(3.) Three, it won some Danish awards which probably indicates more about the desperate condition Danish film is in.
Negatives:
(1.) The lead actor/marshall is so inept that Danish law enforcement must now be embarrassed to be seen. In fact the entire movie is about showing one really dumb, unbelievable, act followed by another. He doesn't investigate, hits kids, has compromising encounter with a married woman that is beyond dumb, leaves evidence, hides evidence, shoots & strangles people, drinks heavily.
(2.) How a town, composed of losers in life, actually is aware of everything and manipulates the whole charade just doesn't fly. There is no thriller in the movie, in fact the thrillers are the numerous scenes of a little girl pointlessly pushing a buggy around town. Oh joy!

4127384,5,B003IM9JWM,"Coming to us from Danish farm country, ""Terribly Happy"" is one of the best neo-noir thrillers I've seen in recent years. It is based on the novel by Erling Jepsen but was adapted for the screen as the book was being written by director Henrik Ruben Genz. The story's literary and cinematic forms influenced one another. Copenhagen cop Robert Hansen (Jakob Cedergren) has been assigned to the rural community of Skarrild as a result of his misconduct. The townsfolk like to deal with offenders their own way and don't appreciate other ideas from their new marshal. Robert is unsure how far he should allow them to go. And he is attracted to comely Ingerlisse (Lena Maria Christensen), a woman who says she wants to leave her abusive husband Jorgen (Kim Bodnia). The town doctor, Dr. Zerland (Lars Brygmann) warns Robert against getting involved and implies that he may have some hold over him.

The film opens with the narration of an absurd folk tale, followed by a declaration that it is ""based on true events"". That juxtaposition made me wonder if I was in for an unusual treat or pretentious guff. It turns out that the part of the story involving Ingerlisse and Jorgen is based on Erling Jepsen's aunt and uncle, but the rest is pure fiction. Jepsen and Genz grew up on the same street in the same small town of Gram in southern Jutland, so they know the terrain. The plot is that of a Western: New sheriff arrives in town to find the people terrorized by criminals or bullies but complicit in their own oppression. There is an established power structure, which people are wary of changing. So the new guy must navigate intrigues he doesn't fully understand and save the day.

But ""Terribly Happy"" takes a sharp turn into film noir: Robert is a man haunted by his own demons, hoping to master them in this little town until he can return to Copenhagen. Instead, he finds himself succumbing to the brutality around him and trying to get his bearings in a closed community where people seem to be making a fool of him. He falls for the machinations of clumsy femme fatale Ingerlisse, who appeals to Robert's ego and guilt about his past conduct. It reminded me of Dashiell Hammett's ""Red Harvest"", in which the detective goes ""blood simple"" as he begins to embrace the criminality around him.

In spite of its genre conventions, ""Terribly Happy"" is unpredictable. It creates persistent tension and unease and even made me jump once. But it's also self-conscious. Everything is dank and musty. We see the mildew on the ceiling of Robert's little police station a few too many times. The decaying production design, ominous score, and ponderous close-ups reflect the mental state of the characters. I don't think the gimmickry was needed. The dirty, unsafe environments are conspicuously unlikely, as is Robert's stubble. He never shaves. The heavy-handed style becomes a distraction at some point. But that's my only criticism of an otherwise compelling, deliciously chaotic and cynical film noir. In Danish with optional English subtitles.

The DVD (Oscilloscope 2010): Bonus features are 3 featurettes and an audio commentary. ""Behind the Scenes of Terribly Happy"" (20 min) interviews Genz and Jepsen about their collaboration, characters, and the landscape. Jepsen explains the family history that inspired him, and Genz comments on how he adapted the novel. ""Showdown between Genz and Author Erling Jepsen on TV2"" (2 1/2 min) is a short television feature about their collaboration. ""Botched Studio Interview by Collaborators Genz and Jepsen"" (2 min)  is some footage of Erling clowning around after an interview in which they were promoting a book. Those featurettes are in Danish with English subtitles. The audio commentary by director Henrik Ruben Genz and producer Thomas Gammeltoft is in English. They discuss locations, themes, casting, some technical issues, and filming.",1279584000,3,3885,4.989197530864198
4127385,4,B003IM9JWM,"It's amazing how they market films: this one has a picture of the main character pointing a gun a la Dirty Harry, though he holds a gun for about one minute in this movie. And then they call it film noir, which it isn't by a long shot. More truthful would be to simply call it a dark comedy and have a picture of a guy holding a muddy boot. Best of all? Just include quotes from the many rave reviews this one got around the globe. But that might make too much sense...

In any case, Terribly Happy isn't terribly funny or terribly sad or terribly anything except maybe slow by Hollywood standards, but it moves along at exactly the right pace to tell this tale in less than 100 minutes (three cheers for concision!). It's a very low-key movie with a simple plot that's all about character development, and for me it worked very nicely indeed. There's not a weak actor in the bunch, the script is crisp and knowing, and the story is unpredictable enough to keep it all interesting. Even the subtitles are perfectly done, a nice change from so many foreign films. You've never seen Denmark in this light is my guess, and the lack of dubbing is perfect; the rhythms of Danish in various mouths are a big part of what makes this work.

As to comparisons with the Coens et al, I can see that a bit, but better to just say that TH is its own animal and well worth watching, especially for its ever more unique charm of being almost violence-free. If you've ever lived in a really small town then you'll get this one all the way home, and its ending will resonate for quite a while with most anyone.

Like others have mentioned, the feel of the film reminded me of a Coen brothers movie, and certain parts of the movie were reminiscent of Fargo.

The character of Robert was very intriguing. As I watched him trying to adapt in this little town, I wanted to know more about him. I wanted to know his back story and about his daughter. Fortunately, as the movie progresses, you learn bits and pieces of his character.

The town is not just a simple small town where nothing happens, as suggested in the beginning of the film. The town is full of mystery, and it pretty much has it's own well-established government that controls everything that happens there.

In some respects this shares more cinematic DNA with the great American indie thriller Blue Ruin from a few years ago. Needless to say, when the cop, Robert Hansen, tries to make sense out of the strange inhabitants of a small Danish town -- and, by the way, save the girl, solve at least one murder and take down the town thug -- he falls further and further in to the the ""bog"" of trying to use his big city frame of reference and skills to extricate himself. And like the metaphorical bog (or the real one outside of town, that plays like an additional character in the film) the harder you struggle, the farther down you go. Great stuff.",1518912000,,1050,4.50261780104712
8397466,2,B003IM9JWM,"This movie was an absolute snooze fest. I see absolutely no reason why it was made. It conveyed nothing except a crazy cop finding a crazy town that fits him. This movie was so slow I feel asleep twice, (during the day). But I was determined to finish because I read the reviews that said the ending was a twist and wait for it, wait for it.  This is a case of Lucy pulling the football right before Charlie Brown kicks it......there is nothing there but air.",1514073600,,459,4.275862068965517

I found it ... slow and uneventful.
One scene /may/ have been humorous, but I couldn't be sure.",1513555200,,142,4.72
8397468,1,B003IM9JWM,"Yeah, I get that it's very artsy film noir. But the plotline is so weird (actually downright creepy), and every character so beyond pathetic, there is nothing to justify the loss of the time from your life viewing this film.",1511740800,,224,4.625
8397469,5,B003IM9JWM,"Absolutely must see! It is a glimpse into the world of seemingly so foreign (remote Scandinavian village) people but at the same time dealing with very familiar issues of love, betrayal, coping with loss, marital violence, child neglect. It is a surreal chain of events that find their logical conclusion.",1501027200,,305,5.12

8397472,4,B003IM9JWM,"This film reminded me of the surrealism in The Twilight Zone and some dark characters in Blue Velvet. One of the townspeople at the bar even looks like David Hopper, and the under face lighting makes them all pretty creepy. But as dark as this story is, it has humor too. A troubled policeman from Copenhagen is relegated to the outback of Denmark where he a dark bunch of townspeople that have learned to adapt and live with each other. The opening about a cow that sinks in a bog, only to come to the surface months later and deliver a two headed (one human head, one cow head) calf. Although the town wisdom is that the monstrous calf should be destroyed, it's allowed to live until all the women start to lose their unborn children. The calf is delivered back to the bog, and ""there is no more problem from women or cows."" The bog is a central part of the theme and eventually absorbs a multitude of sins. The townspeople feel that justice is done if troubles are swallowed up this way, and eventually the policeman becomes one of them.",1489708800,,1040,4.421875
