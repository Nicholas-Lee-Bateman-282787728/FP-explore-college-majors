I have asked Amazon to provide a reason for this, but they haven't done so... I think it's terribly misleading of Amazon to list something as being 'in stock' when orders placed two months ago haven't been filled yet.

2626877,5,B000H5U5U8,"Gene Simmons, by his own admission, is delusional and a workaholic.  What makes the show interesting is that it's sad and admirable at the exact same time.  Admirable once you understand how he grew up and how his being raised in a poor one parent household in Israel had an affect on him(in the episode ""Shrink Wrapped"") and sad because you see his family get dissapointed over and over because they want to do things with him but he chooses to leave his West coast home for various business meetings, sometimes on the East coast(he missed his daughter's soccer game in one episode).  You will see his family roll their eyes or walk off while he's in mid sentence talking about something business related that only he cares about.  There are occasional touching moments also: Gene putting on his makeup and his dauaghter brings him a popsicle and she asks him to put the makeup on her.  From watching this show, it would seem he would be much worse if he did not have his family to keep him grounded and keep his swelled head from floating into the sky and damaging satellites in space.  I liked 'The Osbournes', and have been a HUGE fan of both musicians for years and years so I'm not necessarily slamming either of them -they've got a ton of money from me over 25+ years. lol-, but Family Jewels is a lot easier to watch versus 'The Osbournes' because Simmons and family seem to be a little bit more NORMAL and the viewer does not have to hear a censored beep about every 10 seconds and everyone, in general, seems to be a bit more grounded and not so quick to fly off the handle at any given moment(there's no Kelly Osbourne in Gene's show. lol).  Sophie, Gene's 13yo daughter, makes a joke about 'The Osbournes' when Gene jokingly yells at Shannon inside a snowboard store and calls her ""Sharon Tweek"" to which Sophie replies ""Wrong Show.""  Obviously, Gene did this show for money, along with his whole ""I Am Indy"" car racing thing-which is odd since Gene never drove a car until he was 34yo(you will understand when you watch just ONE episode.  ANY episode about how money plays a big part in every decision he makes) but what he has done in the process is demystify his 'Demon' image that has followed him for 30+ years, which is not necessarily a bad thing.  One episode he spends the entire day with a fan who won a radio contest and it's quite interesting.  I never thought I'd see 'The Demon' playing mini golf and riding around in bumper boats and go karts.  He was really nice to this fan despite what I've read from fan letters on his website who seemed to judge everything on a 22-minute episode when Gene spent what looked like at least 8-10 hours with his 'biggest fan'.  I didn't see the issue at all and remember we only saw roughly 20 minutes of an 8 or 10 hour day with this fan.  This family is funny and there are so many good natured, self depriciating comments in every episode that you can't help but laugh at it all.  Some moments, at least to me, seem to be quite set up just for a 'tv moment', the pregnant or not pregnant final episode and the bull ranch episode titled fittingly 'Loose Change', for example: Gene goes to find out why he lost $20,000 he invested only to end up 'collecting' certain fluids from the Bulls to help increase profit for the ranch and, thus, for himself.  Who does that, what rock star would do that? Isn't $20,000 to Gene about like $2 to the normal everyday person? It just seemed odd among this entire show to me but like one of his kids said, when it comes to business he ""has no off switch"".  The bonus material, adding up to slightly over an hour, is pretty entertaining also and worth a look(although the bloopers weren't as funny as I hoped they'd be).  You get to see more of his KISS office and each family member takes you through it seperately.  Great DVD for any Kiss fan, old or new.  Yes, Nick, us older fans are rolling our walkers into the nearest store to buy this DVD so you can continue to buy cool retro clothes that Jim Morrison or Ian Astbury would be proud of.  Looking forward to season 2 which I have heard will be 20 episodes.  Kiss fans should definetly own this... and don't forget KISSOLOGY on DVD!",1167091200,14,4187,4.40337224383917

2626896,5,B000H5U5U8,"I don't think there are much people who don't know KISS or Gene Simmons as most people I ask at least know who you're talking about. With his ""Family Jewels"" television show,KISS co-founder Gene lets us see what his life is like,we also get to meet his family and we learn just how much Simmons is a workoholic and how money counts for him. This show reminds a lot of the Osbournes show wich aired a few years ago,its was basicly Ozzy and his crazy family,the concept is pretty much the same for Family Jewels but is totaly different. In the Osbournes there was swearing,bipping,the kids were always fighting and at times you couldn't understand Ozzy well,wheras in Family Jewels its much more of a normal family and its organized better overral. Gene always talks about himself as the rock god,while his family are always making fun of him and they are hilarious and the show is captivating,interresting and shows us how Gene's life is,well on that point its the closest we ever got. I need to point out that Gene and his wife,ex-playmate Shanon Tweed are happily unmarried since 20+ years,and Gene true to his reputation(he claims to have slept with 4 600 womens).His two kids Nick and Sophie do great on the show as well,in fact even the dog gets his shining moments! I have to say I don't and never really liked reality t.v but I,just like many others love this show!

You first have to understand that everything in Gene's life is and pretty much always was about money. In fact the primary reason he did this is to get money,god knows he doesn't really need any more but he still does. Yet I knew that when I was watching it and I still tought he managed to give fans and non-fans their money's worth with this show. These 13 episodes turned out to be some of the best television I ever saw and some of the funniest too! Being a KISS fan I was instantly attracted by it but I soon realized that much more people were watching this,even non-KISS fans have been attracted by it. This show is good at something,1)making you laugh and entertain you and 2)make you discover what its like to be Gene Simmons. Gene is always about money and his family makes fun of him for that,calling him a workoholic and laughing at his god status making him look like not much in the end. Gene was never humble,always giving himself extra credit for founding KISS and his family are the only ones who can keep him grounded because of his huge ego. This show probably wouldn't work if it was about Paul Stanley,Ace Frehley or Peter Criss's families as they like their privacy while Gene is the only one of KISS willing to sell his privacy,plus his family really fit well on the small screen and he is a goof,all that makes the show work so well.

Gene takes KISS as not a band but a brand and it always has been like that in the band,making big profits and that is a reason why the band didn't get the respect it deserved. In this show he tries to sell KISS to everyone,trying to make snowboards,his association with Indy Racing and he even tries to make a Gene Simmons's Sexercice video. There is also the episode where he wants to make money with Bull sperm! His daughter Sophie even parodies him saying ""Gene Simmons eggs! I have to call Angus! Hey Angus think about it Gene Simmons eggs..."".Nick then adds still making fun of Gene ""Think about it,my face on a chicken's butt!"".That's just to prove you how the guy is addicted to money. This season might be the first but it already feels like a classic as each episodes are great and I watched each a good dozen times on televison and still enjoy watching them. There is an episode where Gene tries to go on a vacation with his family but he can't resist an opportunity to make money. I liked the episode when he has a radio contest to determine who his biggest fan is,Gene is not really thrilled with the choice and it turns out to be pretty funny. In an episode Nick tries to get a gig with his band and his father books him one. It was nice to hear Nick sing. Each episode has a different plot and it makes sense and seems believable,at least not too phony. Im not sure if this is improvised or what but its certainly great!

On this show Gene is not really the rock star,he's mostly the buisness man. I thank Gene for letting us enter his private life and discover more of his personna. The show turned out to be very succesfull on the channel it airs on,A&E quickly gave another contract for another season because of its high ratings and it became one of the most watched show on the network. I just loved the show and this DVD set of the first season and it has some great bonus features like the couch interviews,the bloopers are good,I particularly enjoyed the ""Inside The lair"" bonus wich took us in Gene's office. Gene's History Of Rock'N'Roll was neat as well. The lost songs is the big surprise and i don't want to spoil it sorry! There are lots of features all listed in the description and the thirteen episodes(its pretty much what each show are allowed for a first season)that accompany them makes this a killer worthy set. The price of the set in most stores is pretty cheap for these kinds of set and I highly recommend them to KISS fans,even if you aren't a fan you will probably like this show as well you don't neccesarily need to be a fan to appreciate it. The highest rating obviously five stars.",1254009600,,5359,4.427558257345491

I got into watching the series & I enjoy it.

A lot of this you KNOW is just set up for TV.

I like the kids Nick & Sophie.  You wish other celebrity kids were like them.  Gene & Shannon a job well done with them.

The show is a guilty pleasure.  Gene having to put Kiss on every piece of merchandise he can think of.  Money, money, money.

Good extras on the DVD package.  I just got the 2cd season & there are none there so they put everything on here.  That part is bad.

2626899,5,B000H5U5U8,"In full disclosure, I am not a Kiss fan at all (with the exception of two songs I love), but wanted to buy this because through books I've read, know that Gene is meant to be a decent, family-orientated, general all round nice guy (and the show shows that he is).  He comes across and a pussycat rather than a rock and roll bad boy (although there are some aspects of that part of his life shown here) and as a great partner to Shannon and a fantastic father to the kids.  He's brought them up right and they seem like a genuinely nice family who are respectful, yet still love their fun.
Overall this show is hilarious too.  It's fun to be a fly on the wall here.  I have a couple of favourite moments from this season; I love when Shannon and Sophie go to Krav Maga lessons and he goes to pick them up, I love when he does a driving test and I love when he and Shannon go on the weekend retreat and he pays someone in the staff to go get him some real food and a tv.
I would have assumed he'd be an arrogant kind of guy for someone of his success, and while he openly admits to how gorgeous he believes himself to be, I found myself really liking him.  I love how they've put family video footage in here too and I love his personality and the relationship he has with his family.  Even if you aren't a Kiss fan, you should check this out because it's a brilliant reality show that gets you hooked right from the start.  It's fun and enjoyable and I love it - hope you will too.",1223078400,14,1480,4.0479452054794525

This reality show revolves around the Simmons family (Gene Simmons of Kiss.)  Gene is un-married to an ex-playboy model, who has a twin sister.  Hmm, rock star and playboy model?  Despite the cliche,  their relationship seems genuine.

It's refreshing to watch a reality show without the drugs and alcohol whining you usually come across in this genre.  (Watching privileged people wasting away their lives doesn't rouse my sympathy.)

I watch this show on the A&E channel.  In one episode, there was some kind of date auction for charity.  Gene Simmons sent his son Nick to stand in for his ""date"".

The date turned out to be a young girl's roller skating rink birthday party.  The group of girls looked about 10 or 11.

Nick Simmons was such a good sport about the whole thing, my heart went out to him.

It feels kinda freakish to watch someone else's life on TV.  But, it was very entertaining to watch Gene babysit an infant.  And, it's nice to see he respects his mother.",1205971200,,1099,4.606217616580311

2626912,5,B000H5U5U8,I was surprised at how funny this show was. I watched the Osbournes and I hate to say it but I just found the family to be annoying. On that show Ozzy's kids came off as annoying unlikeable kids. I expected this show to be even worse because of how Gene's always talking bad about Ace and Peter. I kind of expected that same negative image here. I was surprised to find that this is my favorite of any of the reality shows where celebrities are followed around. (Except maybe the Surreal Life shows). This was a great show. I enjoyed every episode as well as most of the extras. One thing that surprised me about the show is how the family sometimes makes fun of Gene and does stuff behind his back that they know he wouldn't want them doing. I knew Gene was obsessed with money but in this show you see that his obsession is really at a level that its a kind of psychological sickness.,1193011200,2,886,4.2485207100591715

Sure, he's a big showman but that's what alot of us grew up with him in KISS.  The kids actually seem well, NORMAL for being the kids of a rock legend.  Sure they don't have MONEY problems but they still deal with family problems - relationships, kids, etc.

I do agree with a prior review the box the set comes in is majorly cheesy.  It's just thin plastic with pretty colors. Honestly -ignore it and throw the box away.

The album has a lot of nice pictures but it's not huge.  So far I""ve watched all the episodes as well as the bloopers, interviews and his biography episode and I""m very happy with the quality.

2626916,5,B000H5U5U8,"A very nicely packaged box set in a family album style- 12 pages of family photo's 3 DVD's and 1 C.D.

13 episodes of family jewels
plus extras
bonus disc- episode of the feature on Gene by the Biography channel
C.D. of 2 early (pre-kiss) demo's.

The family jewels series is a candid (mostly unrehearsed / unscripted)reality show featuring Gene, Shannon, Nick and Sophie (and quite a bit of Shannon's sister). Don't expect to see much of Kiss, this is Gene's show! it shows Gene and family at home, shopping, on holiday, at parties, goofing around, getting prepped for cosmetic surgery- normal family stuff - for multi millionaire families, i'm sure. it's pretty entertaining on the whole with only a few dull episodes. it has a few cringe-making moments too, with Gene embarrassing himself and his family embarrassing him too! the episode where he meets a fan is almost unbearable and he comes across as a little rude.

He comes across as a very caring and decent family man who works really hard and it makes you question just how much you think you know of Gene is possibly carefully marketed image- the number of women he's allegedly had sex with seems to increase in hundreds every time someone asks him about it!

the features on his office (inside the demon's lair) are a little disappointing- each family member shows you around in turn- but basically points out the same stuff, so you don't get to see as much as you could! the other show extra's are ok.

the bonus biography disc is the most disappointing thing about this set. not so much a biography as 'what Gene's up to this week. not much history there at all!

the bonus C.D. however is inspired. The quality makes you wonder if they were maybe recorded more recently ( he only says they were written long ago!) but the feel of the tracks is certainly 1960's. if this is a taste of the forthcoming Gene Simmons box set (Monster)it will be well worth a listen. think first solo album type of material.

overall, i was really pleased with this set and would love to see the second series on DVD! well  worth a look!!!",1187913600,,2082,4.577956989247312
2626917,5,B000H5U5U8,"I have seen every episode of this show, and I can honestly say, I like it a lot.  My background as far as Kiss is concerned would be simply a casual fan.  I like their big hits, but never ventured too deep into their catalog, so I'm not blinded by Kiss loyalty.  That said, watching this show has made me get into Kiss a lot more.

To me, the best part of the show is Gene's kids, Nick & Sophie.  Nick is a very charming, dry, witty young man, who carries himself as being older than what he really is (he turned 18 in season 2).  Sometimes, Nick is absolutely hysterical.  In season 2, Gene says to Nick, ""You know, your mother and I met at the Playboy Mansion.""  Nick says, ""Yes, my therapist and I have covered that.""

Sophie is a beautiful 15 year old girl who has her daddy wrapped around her finger.  Sophie isn't as outgoing as Nick, but she has her moments, and an ongoing dilemma for Gene is how she is growing up so fast.  It's causing Gene to look at himself a lot, and think about his own past promiscuity, and envision his daughter being faced with men like himself as she grows up.  Gene cringes a lot around Sophie, partly out of concern, and partly from his own embarrasment.

Gene doesn't try to hide his past from his kids.  He seems very open & honest with them, and they seem to do likewise with him.  It's been said in other reviews here, but I'll say it again.  This show is NOT like the Osbournes.  To me, the Osbournes was based on chaos and confusion.  The hook to Family Jewels is the LACK of chaos and confusion.  You think they're primed for everything to fall apart, but they handle everything pretty much like ""normal"" people do everyday.  No drama, no screaming, just people working through normal everyday things.

Don't misunderstand, it's not a perfect show.  Some things are definitely scripted, and Gene & family have plenty of money, so they can have some elaborate spur-of-the-moment adventures, but most of the show is rooted in the family's normality, and Gene's never-ending quest for money.

Whether you love Gene or hate him, the thing that stands out most to me is this:  When you see how well-adjusted, respectful, and down-to-earth his kids are, you have to accept that, despite whatever preconceived notion you may have had about him and Shannon Tweed, they have done a good job as parents.  This show will surprise you.  I highly recommend it.",1187740800,3,2391,4.476851851851852

Along with his 2 children, Gene allows cameras in his magnificient house and shows whats life like under the soft side of the ""demon"". Whether is being protective of his daughter, Sophie, or getting a music gig for hs son Nick, to generating new buisness ventures which almost always involve women and more women and thats all I can say. Gene even lets us see is mother who in her house has a dedicated room to Gene's and Shannon's accomplishments from his Kiss fame as well as the movie he played evil Dr. Luther in Runaway with Tom Sellick (watch for the spider robot). Gene also has one of the spider robots in his office. I like the Osbornes but at times I would miss an episode and wouldn't care however, Family Jewels is funnier, entertaining, and can't miss it when it's on. Gene's classic remark after the opening song is: I tell people what to do, except well Shannon because she tells me to do something and I'll do it. Great show!",1185840000,3,1114,4.412621359223301

Gene Simmons is truly a rock god, but in his home, it's Shannon Tweed that rules the roost.

While I enjoyed the Osbournes, Gene's children are a far different cry. Clean, sober, funny, and very intelligent, they're actually a joy to watch.

It's nice to see the caring side of a demon :)",1185148800,,307,4.350877192982456
2626923,5,B000H5U5U8,"I have been a Kiss fan since 1983 when something called Kiss entered my life. I was 8 at the time and didn't know what hit me. As I used to dig into comics about Superman and Batman, here came 4 superheroes with weird make-up and outlandish costumes and played catchy straight ahead rock 'n' roll. I was hooked (a little scared, and very much in awe). Naturally, my friends at school picked on me for this.

I'm still a fan. Very much so.

I saw the Osbournes on TV and enjoyed that show very much. However it lost some of it's initial punch by the second season. Then I heard Gene Simmons was thinking of doing the same thing. A reality show. ""Would it be funny??"" was my first thought. It turned out I was right.

I'm not going to give the plot away, you'll have to see for yourself. But it's good to see big, bad Gene Simmons be put in his place a couple of times. Frankly, he deserves it. He does have a one track mind. This DVD is a must have. You'll enjoy it so much you'll watch it many times over.",1185148800,3,1005,4.091370558375634
2626924,5,B000H5U5U8,"Loved it.  It's really nice to see well balanced people that love, appreciate, and enjoy their craziness with each other.  I think the most striking thing about these little episodes (having spent most of my life in schools, counselling and psychology) is how openly affectionate this family is with each other without ever crossing the ""ugh"" line.  It is encouraging.  I once heard that there are basically two reasons that people watch a TV show: 1.) They'd like to hang out with the people in the show.  2.)  They become emotionally attached to one or more of the characters and want to see what happens next.  This has both.  This is also one of the rare shows that both my boyfriend and I have watched over and over.  That's why we bought the box set: Great packaging by the way!  Love it.

I like the kids, and the bantering that goes on between them all.  Aunt Tracy is a blast!

2626929,4,B000H5U5U8,"Gene Simmons and his lady Shannon Tweed have two children..this is their first season reality show. Is it the Osbornes or Real World? NO...Its better

Simmons was one of the two front men in the legendary rock group KISS. On stage, he is a demon. At home, the show plays like a rock star's Father Knows Best. His family, thru on camera interviews, tell the tales. Simmons is a pussy cat, barely getting angry at his kids. Trying to impart wisdom to his kids Nick and Sophie

The entertainment is watching Simmons go from family man to demon. From not nonsense performance artist to real life dad,It is real life with teenagers and a non married wife

The extras are nice on this set.. However I would have enjoyed Gene's audio comments on an episode of two-more insight,

This could be sub titled my life as a rock star's kid and it is humanly funny...because Simmons takes himself so serious

however the description is a misnomer
there is the bonust unaired pilot
but the album is not 10 pages long
but other than that its awesome
the packaging is great
its very much like a photo album
and has pictures of the family
the bonus features are great and generous i really like ""the lost songs"" which has candid moments of gene singing songs he wrote and even a live performance of nick and his band. sophie sings as well
the blooper reel has gene messing up his lines which is really funny and various mishaps on the show
there is one disc that includes the a&e biography on gene simmons
one disc has gene simmons music and a personal note from gene about the songs
the set reminds me of the sex and the city pink photo album but its not pink but similar concept
there are a total of 8 featurettes which all are great

i paid about $7 more for the collectors edition and i am happy and thrilled i did
again i cant say enough about the packaging

2626940,2,B000H5U5U8,"I just can't figure out why so many people keep on praising this show. I mean, I watch it; and do find it more watchable than the Ozbournes. And I do admit that it is entertaining, but I dunno what's wrong with everyone. Are people hypnotized or something? Too blind to see some realistic truth too.... I mean, this show may be a little more constructive than the Ozbournes, but it has many things in common with it too.

Like the fact that neither of Mr Simmons kids, just like Ozzy's, are all that bright. I mean both Nick Simmons and Jack Ozbourne act like they've got nostrils in their cerrebelums (forgive my spelling). Anyone who says Nick Simmons is bright is having some denial issues! The guy just stands around acting all goofy, strutting his long hair and having fun, but his only true purpose on that show is to make snide remarks and provide comedy relief. Sophie, does not have much personality in any respect at all!!! The only thing she seems good for on the show is to show her big boobs around and make her father, the big HYPOCRITE, go stir-crazy over her hanging out with guys. Like what does Mr Simmons expect, his daughter is an exception or something? Come-on? She's a chick too, Mr Simmons, like any other--with big boobs to boot!

Imagine that!--the biggest womanizer on earth trying to turn his daughter into--what?--the Virgin Mary or something? Makes no sense really. I dunno; that Gene Simmons just don't make no sense at all. His kids are spoiled rotten; he don't seem to care much. And he lets them get away with just about everything--just like Ozbourne. At the same time, he's a big hypocrite, he talks all that talk of ""hard work"" and ""doing it all himself"", and there are his kids going around and just having a ball with all his money, living in that big mansion. He truly never ""lays down the law"" at all or invoke any ounce of discipline on them, other than to harass Sophie any time she hangs out with guys. Like who does he think he is really, Al Bundy?

It's still a fun show; but being the realist that I am, I just can't bring myself to give it too much praise.",1178668800,2,2104,4.431524547803617

Not being a KISS fan and knowing little about Gene Simmons apparently didn't affect my enjoyment of this show.  It shows you what good and responsible parenting does for kids.  In a way, it's not fair to compare these kids to the Osbornes who as much as they love each other, live in chaos with a father who cannot (due to his own drug addition), set a good example for his kids.
