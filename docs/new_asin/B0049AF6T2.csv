8418899,5,B0049AF6T2,"We love Wubbzy to begin with and I think it is great that they put out an Easter DVD! ""Wubbzy's Egg-Cellent Easter"" DVD is just over an hour with six full episodes.  The episodes all carry the great Wubbzy lessons like working together, good friends, even exercising!  My sons favorite episode involves the Easter Bunny getting back into shape!  I watched this DVD with both boys and explained about the Easter Bunny, eggs, and springtime.  It was a perfect introduction to springtime and April and of course fun to watch!

Frustrated though when I tried to order 10 ea. to give away some, I was only allowed to buy 3 ea. from Amazon!!!  That made no sense!",1301788800,,243,4.127659574468085
