2350045,4,B000A1OFZA,"The main character of this movie does not utter a single word. He is a ""gentle"" criminal, one that does not burglarize houses for acquiring property but in order to acquire a feeling of home. Tae - Suk has a special method for breaking into houses: during the morning hours he puts flyers on key locks, then comes around later in the day to check which flyers were not touched. Now he knows which house to expertly break into. He immediately ""feels at home"" uses the bath tub and wears the clothes of the owners. Then he cooks himself a good meal and watches television. He likes to mend some out of work electronic device and to wash (by hand) the owners dirty clothes. He leaves the house clean as if untouched and proceeds on to the next day.

This is an unusual film, almost with no dialog that starts in a realistic manner and turns somewhat unrealistic (or spiritual if you may) towards the end. This movie will not appeal to every taste. Out of the people who saw this movie with me, one remained untouched, one hated every minute, called the movie ""pretentious"" and claimed that being a Korean movie is the only reason for the critics admiration. The other two were quite ambivalent, as felt in spite of this being no regular film, it had a lot to offer. One cannot deny that the movie has many tender moments, some of them have to do with the relations between the two main characters who do not need words in order to communicate and to know exactly what the other needs; Another aspect is Tae - Suk  ""Zelig"" nature who seems to adopt, for a few hours, the lives and likes of the house owners. Examples of this can be found in his watching boxing films in the house of a boxer or ceremoniously preparing tea in a small spiritual house with a beautiful garden.

The film moves between characters and different life styles, as through the houses we know the owners and can tell which lives are full or empty. The heroine, an unhappy creature lives in a golden cage. Her house is one of the best looking in the movie, but she, nevertheless, is a miserable beaten woman. She joins Tae Suk (without words) to his daily house travels. Among other statements, the movie seems to say that a nice house is no indication of happiness. In fact, I think there is a clear agreement that the ""happiest"" house is the ""spiritual"" house whose owners constantly tend to their garden and kindly talk to each other. This is the house where the heroine comes to sleep in peace and the owners are kind enough to allow it. It seems that the movie seems to want to rise, just like his hero, above earthy needs and to claim that a feeling of home can be achieved from somewhere within.

Other signs of spirituality can be found in Tae - Suk constant cleaning and rhythmical washing of clothes. This seems like a funny, weird act but I felt this is enjoyed by him as an act of purification.

The last part of the movie seems to find unrealistic solutions to the complicated story, as Tae Suk blends his life in the life of his love.

Weird, but interesting and there are ideas and sights in his movie that remain with you.",1123632000,4,3106,4.4118673647469455
2350046,4,B000A1OFZA,"One of the more talented Korean directors working today is Kim-ki Duk whose latest film 3-Iron, was released this year (2005) here in the US and is out on DVD domestically in September. This is the tale of a young guy--nameless-who makes a meager living as a distributor of promo flyers for an eating establishment and also has the habit of breaking into the homes of people who are away so he can eat their food and maybe take a nap. But he's not completely malicious; one of his great virtues is the ability to clean clothes by hand.

One such house he breaks into is that of a middle-aged man with a young wife who's been mistreated. As he goes about his gentle intruder business he doesn't realize, at first, that the wife is right there in the house with him, although her husband is not. It's obvious from her appearance that she's been recently roughed up. She watches him fascinated and finally makes her presence known.

The two of them hook up with each other almost immediately and as one thing leads to another, the convergence of the spurned husband, an angry cop, an angrier prison guard, and the two lovers--along with the game of golf (from which the film derives its title) results in a unique film that, although almost 70% dialogue free, is a really compelling love story.

There's a sequence in a prison cell with the male lead that is truly imaginative, absorbing, even compelling. And the device of the scale being modified (our protagonist is also an expert at ""fixing"" things) is very clever, especially as shown at the very end of the film when the lovers stand on the scale together and the combined weight is somewhat less than it should be.

Both lovers have the innate (and eventually overt) ability to be ""ghost people""; this contrasts with the middle-aged husband's rude, crude persona, as it does with that of the cop and the prison guard. The implication of this, interestingly enough, is that the finer emotions--love, true feeling, compassion--are those experienced by people who are maybe not completely in the world but just outside of it, while those who are very much of this world express themselves roughly, crudely, angrily, making the world what we unfortunately expect it to be rather than what we know it CAN be.

This is a brilliant film and should be seen by a much wider audience. Very highly recommended.",1123027200,26,2353,4.687651331719128

2350067,5,B000A1OFZA,"With almost no talking, but an almost supernatural drama twist, this is perhaps my favorite 'thinking person's foreign drama'.  Like a more mundane ""Inception"" or ""Adjustment Bureau"", this has remained one of my favorite movie, largely because it was so moving without the 'tell you what a character's doing/feeling' trend of Hollywood movies I felt swamped  in and turned off by when I first discovered this film.  Love, violence, regret, revenge, sorrow, loneliness, hope, and even some psychology thrown in make a quiet, enthralling movie that I think of over and over again.  That's important to me, and rare.  So yes, I'd definitely recommend this to anyone that likes a slow, delicate movie, and a return to the heart of a well made movie.",1416441600,,745,4.975806451612903
2350068,5,B000A1OFZA,"I recently watched a Korean movie entitled 3-Iron. I am reliably informed that the original Korean title is Empty House, somewhat more evocative.

The movie follows a young man who breaks into empty houses or apartments and lives in them for a day or two. While there, he repairs small appliances, does laundry, and generally leaves each place better than he finds it. In addition, part of his ritual is to photograph himself in each home, usually standing near a family portrait.

What is he seeking in these places? Is this part of the ritual just a joke, a prank the homeowners will never discover? Or is there something more in this action, a need to relate, to belong?

In one such house, he discovers a young woman who is clearly victim of domestic violence. He quickly leaves the house, but something about her draws him back.

Here we encounter the title artifact of the movie. When he returns, he confronts the man of the house. While the husband is dressing down the strange woman, the visitor goes out back and begins whacking golf balls at a net designed for that purpose. Eventually, the husband has to go out to investigate, and then the young man drives a few golf balls at him, disabling him long enough for the woman to escape.

The names of these characters are not obvious, because the young man proceeds in complete silence throughout the film, and the woman he adopts emulates his silence. Indeed, she begins to accompany him through his strange life. They tape fliersadvertisements for foodon every door in a given neighborhood. The ones not removed at dusk are the ones where nobody is home, and they begin to live this nomadic life together. She even begins to help with the household chores: light repairs, cleaning, laundry.

The man now carries around a 3-iron. He seems a little obsessed with it. He practices his swing in the park while the couple waits for dusk. Eventually, the woman begins to interfere with this obsessive practice by standing in the path of his swing, never speaking.

In the end, the two are caught. Some violence ensues against the young man, who is carted off to jail. This is where things become weird. In jail, he begins to disappear. At first, he hides against the wall that has the door. The jailer, unable to see him, storms in raging and beats him. Next, he hides above the door. Same result. Then he begins to move very quietly. The third time he is hidden, and the jailer storms in. He stands close behind him, circling with him, remaining unseen. He is given away in the end by his shadow. And the jailer tells him this: you are very crafty, but youd best learn to guard your shadow.

And finally, he disappears completely. He becomes a sort of ghost, invisible, completely hidden from view. From here, he begins to visit the people who hurt him, pelting them violently with golf balls. And he visits all the homes he has used before, upsetting something small in their order, sensed but not seen.

At the close of the film, he has returned to the home of the abused woman. He stands behind her husband, unseen by him but seen by her. She relates to him, now with her voice returned, speaking to her husband but meaning her words from him. He takes food from the table when the husband is not looking. He is both completely gone and completely present.

As I am not Korean, and the film is immersed in Korean culture, it is doubtful I can speak to all the layers of meaning. One might wonder, for example, whether this ghostly young man is a reference to a particular type of specter from Korean legend. At the same time, the film is deeply evocative across cultures. It is beautifully shot, juxtaposing old and modern Korea: Western-style boxing with old architecture; male hierarchical family structure with daring use of nudity (not a usual feature of Korean film).

The Western title of the film, 3-Iron, focuses the viewer first on the object of obsession and violence throughout the film. And both obsession and violence are present. The principle character seems reluctantly violent at the start and increasingly disturbed as he suffers several injustices. He seems obsessed with the golf club, and behaves ritualistically, repetitively, until at the end, he begins to undo some of his work.

The Korean title of the film, Empty House, orients the viewer more to the empty spaces in which the principle character inserts himself. He does not really steal the homes, just makes use of something currently idle. While he does help himself to the food of others, he pays for it with quiet, unasked-for service.

The houses he inhabits are empty, and so are the relationships that take place there, to some extent. We see domestic violence, unhappy marriages, a man who uses women just for pleasure. The principle character inserts himself not only into empty spaces but also into empty relationships, photographing himself with the family portraits of others, portraits that capture a brief happy moment but nothing of the complexity or ultimate emptiness of the lives he samples.

And is he himself empty? He appears to have no intentions, no long-range plan for his life, no ambitions. He does not speak, at least not on camera. If he feels anything for the woman he rescues, it is not evident. Nor does he seem terribly vengeful, not escalating violence. The only times he seems truly distraught are when his golfing obsession injures a motorist, and when his fellow prisoners, late in the film, interfere with his imaginary golfing.

Many questions remain. Is he a real person or some semi-benign household spirit, or a kwishin (ghost)? Is the end of the movie factual, or the product of his madness? Is he mad or sane?

And questions also seem posed to Korean society. Is modern life better than traditional life? Have women really discovered any equality? Is family life better or merely empty, silent, and by rote? Does adopting increasingly Western ways improve or detract from life? Who is mad in this film?

From a few thousand miles away, it seems we could ask the same questions of our own culture, especially regarding the influence of technology and modernization. Are our lives better for Facebook and iPhones, or are we losing something, emptying out our relationships until we become invisible?

The Jungians among us will seize upon that line about the shadow. There is a shadow self here, and it is obsessive, sometimes violent, rigid. But these traits are all shown by the people in the lives our hero inhabitsin all our lives. Does he, in the end, fail to watch his shadowor does he merge with it, incorporate it, and lead a shadow life? In any case, this is a clear indication. In this low-dialogue film, every word seems to stand out, and this line seems, more than any, directed to the watcher.

Learn to watch your shadow.",1413417600,,6813,4.734177215189874

It will calmly thrill those willing to suspend their attachment to the mundane for 90 minutes and give themselves over to the magic of serendipity. Perhaps, after experiencing this beautifully directed and skilfully filmed cinematic poem, words may just sound like noise and the sense that someone strange is in the house--maybe right behind you--will for the first time inspire a sense not of fear and anxiety, but of curiosity and discovery.

2350075,4,B000A1OFZA,"I figure there are enough reviews on here about the plot, and seeing as how the plot isn't half the fun of the this film, I'm going to focus instead on my impressions.

First, let me say that this film is never what you expect it to be. I mean that in every conceivable way; genre, tone, storyline... Going into it, I knew about some of its eccentricities (the two main characters never speak a word onscreen, for example), but every time I thought I had things pegged...well, I didn't.  ""3-Iron"" is at times moving and poignant, at other times mysterious and/or strange, and, to me at least, this film was HILARIOUS (I mean that positively).

I don't know what it is about Jae Hee, the male lead, but, during the latter half of the film, almost every scene he was in made me laugh. The tone shifts radically several times, and at times it creeps toward absurdity, but I found myself smiling with glee every time a curve ball (or golf ball) was thrown at me.  You might be asking yourself why I didn't give it five stars.  As mentioned, the twists in this film aren't so much plot twists as shifts in how the audience is supposed to see what's happening on-screen. At times, I didn't know how I should react, and I have to wonder whether the director knows either. Perhaps that's what makes this one worth seeing, though. Unlike a lot of the stuff out there, you know you've seen something after watching ""3-Iron."" Maybe we shouldn't always expect a clear emotional road map. After all, life doesn't give us one.

To sum up: SEE IT, then talk to your friends about it. Trust me, it's great fun to try to describe, and even greater fun to analyze.",1362096000,,1646,4.433774834437086
2350076,4,B000A1OFZA,"Another good production from Korea. -- They really know how to make good historical drama movies/series.
This one has a different twist, something new and not seen before: a Jester and a Female Impersonator,
which indeed was the case in those years (homosexual male actors). The plot is very plausible, the dialogue
is intelligent and the photography very good. If one were to critizise anything, that would be the props
(screens & paintings) which were painted yesterday and are bad imitations. - Just don't pay attention
to them and rather look at the clothes which are excellent. The actors are very good and I disagree
with another reviewer who critizised the female impersonator. This movie deserves 4 out of 5 stars

2350077,4,B000A1OFZA,"Korean movies usually have very interesting stories that will make you watch them even if it's not something you may find within your normal tastes for movies. ""The King and the Clown"" is no different when it comes to that. Although the story has ""homosexual"" undertones it's not exactly forced on you so it makes the movie watchable. This movie tells the tale of a King who is truly a minstrel in his own kingdom. The village people mock him and gossip about him,his ministers use their royal power for personal gain right under his nose, and those closest to the king have little respect for him beyond his title. Feeling so powerless in his own court the King himself has deteriorated mentally over time. What you discover in later parts of the movie is the reason for his strange behavior, and that being that his child hood was a tormented one surrounding the murder of his mother. The Minstrels who by their boldness find themselves playing in the Kings court where through their shows they actually end up exposing some of the treachery hidden behind the palace walls. As the smoke begins to clear for the king he finds himself a lonelier man that he though as those closest to him start to show their true emotions and feelings towards his actions. This further drives the King into his madness that is the start of his downfall as he unravels.

The King and the Clown for many reasons is a well scripted film. It plays on emotions and the idea of uncovering illusions. Watching the movie you get a sense of how helpless the people in the palace feel with such an unstable king. It kind of reminded me of the story of Qin Shi Huang and how he became disillusioned from reality towards the end of his reign. There is even a scene in the movie where the king in his lost mind state wishes for his ""playmate"" to shoot and kill one of the servant girls with an arrow. It's a pretty good example of how detached the king is reality. He treats the lives of people as nothing.

Overall The king and the Clown is a movie well worth watching. I at first was put off from it because of the ""homosexual"" theme of the movie but the movie was tasteful and well played.",1355443200,,2163,4.432160804020101

What the king sees in him is beyond my imagining, but then the king is insane, so....

The story is so ridiculously overwrought and melodramatic, though, that hammy acting almost fits better than good acting. This movie is fantastic to look at as long as you're able to ignore the two-hour soap opera that makes Dynasty seem like Shakespeare.",1350086400,,721,4.814516129032258

2350107,5,B000A1OFZA,"Who are we, and of what are we made? Flesh, spirit, both? Are we figments of another's imagination, or figures in a dream? If so, are we the dreamers or the dreamed? Can we transcend what we are and become something of our own making? Korean director KIM Ki-duk explores all of these questions in his film ""3-Iron"" (Korean title, ""Empty House""), an evocative meditation on the nature of substance and transformation.

Tae-suk, a young man of obvious means and (we will learn) a college education, has chosen to exist outside the society in which he lives, moving silently and with near invisibility on its extreme outer edges. Dressed in fine clothes and riding a new BMW motorcycle through the streets of Seoul, he cleverly deduces which houses are empty of their occupants and then moves in for the night. He enjoys the home owner's food, TV, bath, bed, and always photographs himself against a portrait of them, or with some beloved object of theirs. But this is only half of the deal he strikes with his unwitting hosts--he repays and thanks them by washing their clothes (by hand, with a washboard), tidying their houses, repairing their broken appliances. His level of skill at choosing and entering these homes testifies to the length of time he has been living like this, and clearly he intends to go on as he has, until the day he enters the house of a rich businessman. He spends his day in the usual manner, unaware that he has been observed all along by someone every bit as stealthy as himself. Sun-hwa, the silent, sorrowing wife of an abusive husband, watches him as he washes her clothes, practices his golf swing, fixes the bathroom scale (he weighs 65 kilos, she, 47), until he goes to bed. Then she makes her presence known. Startled and distressed, Tae-suk beats a hasty retreat, stopping only long enough to hear Sun-hwa's angry husband berating her over the telephone answering machine and her frustrated scream, her only reply to the furious man. After taking in her beaten face and exchanging long, meaningful looks, Tae-suk leaves, only to find himself compelled to return to the house. He finds Sun-hwa weeping in the bath, and rather than speak to her he goes to her closet and chooses a pale pink outfit to replace the black one she has been wearing all day, then to the CD player to put in a CD he has been carrying with him. The mournful, haunting voice of Natacha Atlas (singing in an unearthly-sounding Arabic) seems to call Sun-hwa to join Tae-suk in his world between the seen and unseen worlds, and she does so in perfect, yet silent, understanding. (Never once, for the entire length of the film, does Tae-suk speak, while Sun-hwa speaks only briefly, at the end of the film.) Sun-hwa's husband returns to encounter a wife whom he can no longer persuade or bully into intimacy with him, and a silently vengeful stranger who attacks him in a rather unorthodox manner with the 3-iron golf club of the title. The two leave, and so begin their transformative journey together.

Like Terrence Mallick, Andrey Tarkovsky, the Polish brothers, and other great poets of cinema, KIM ki-duk tells his story almost entirely through inference, implying that language is not merely unnecessary, but even destructive. Like the above-mentioned directors, KIM creates characters who live in the margins, yet through them and their rejection of the things of the world--including language--all of life, especially the life of the spirit, gains force. In today's rackety world of cinema it is a daring thing to open one's film with 20 minutes of near absolute silence-- no music beyond a bit over the front titles--and virtually no dialogue. Most directors would have lost their nerve and scored the thing, but KIM trusts his audience to stay with him even as the silence deepens. Sun-hwa and Tae-suk go from home to home, and a ritual emerges: he puts on the Natacha Atlas CD, they eat, sleep, and, eventually, make love, though this is not the true consummative act of their relationship. In between new abodes, Tae-suk practices with the 3-Iron he's taken from Sun-hwa's husband. This is the one activity of which Sun-hwa disapproves and tries to stop. She seems to see it as evidence of some attachment, in Tae-suk, to the bourgeois world; it's the sort of thing her husband does, a rich man's hobby with no place in the life these two seek. A terrible accident only underscores its ""wrongness"" (perhaps the film's only moment of heavy-handedness). Eventually we will see that Tae-suk has no need of a physical 3-iron, and questions will arise: Is an invisible golf ball real, if people are fighting over it? Is an invisible 3-iron the proper weapon for an invisible man?

The film boxes Seoul's compass, taking us from the wealthiest neighborhoods to the poorest, from the bourgeoisie to the avant-garde. In the apartment of the photographer who has, on a previous occasion, photographed Sun-hwa, she is confronted with her own idealized portrait on the wall, the symbol of her life as an object of beauty to be possessed by her wealthy husband (issues of ownership and possession are repeatedly explored in ""3-Iron""). She dismantles this portrait, re-arranging it into an image that more reflects her image of herself at the moment and replaces it on the wall (keep your eyes on the evolution of this photograph throughout the film).

The pair perform small acts of kindness (which are as invisible to those for whom they are performed as they themselves are), and one great act of tenderness, which brings them suddenly and terribly to the attention of others--in the fringe world they are occupying, it is dangerous to be seen. They end up in the custody of the police, Sun-hwa is handed over to her husband like a piece of luggage he's filed a claim about, and after a few misadventures while in custody, Tae-suk ends up in jail.

In a world where the cult of materialism prevails, everything is for sale, including the integrity of the police, but they are repeatedly frustrated as Tae-suk refuses to be traumatized, or even mildly irked, by their brutality or the brutality of those who can buy them. Stuck in his jail cell, invoking Shamanic and yogic rituals, Tae-suk trains himself in the art of invisibility.  To the increasingly violent rage of the guard, who beats him for ""hiding"" from him, Tae-suk masters this completely until finally, he can choose whether to be seen or not. Meanwhile, Sun-hwa is lost, performing their simple rituals such as hand-washing her laundry and wandering the streets, dressed again in black but unable to find, on her own, the way back to the secret world she had lived in with Tae-suk. Her despair deepens as she is forced to accept her life with a husband who will never know or understand her, until the day her husband announces that Tae-suk is being released from jail. He is taken from his cell and released, and we see how successfully he has transcended the merely physical as he moves, unseen, through the same homes he has visited while they were empty. Their occupants ""feel"" a presence, but cannot see him. At the photographer's apartment, Sun-hwa's portrait been more or less reassembled; a moment later the photographer and his girlfriend find the frame empty: Tae-suk has removed her entirely from the gaze of the outside world. He winds up, finally, at Sun-hwa's house, where he allows only Sun-hwa to see him. After a playful interaction in the presence of the unseeing husband, a triumph of spirit over matter occurs when Tae-suk lifts Sun-hwa (no longer in black) into his world and they stand together on the bathroom scale, which now measures their combined weight as zero.

This ending seems to have been read in many different ways (I had a strong feeling that the husband would never be able to find his house again, that the whole house had been transformed into a spirit in which the two lovers would live forever), as indeed the entire film has. It certainly can be read as a simple love story or, as Brian T. has made an excellent case for, a Buddhist allegory, but in the end it is a film, and cinema has a language all its own. Reading and deciphering the clues of a poetic and imaginative film is, in itself, a worthy occupation, and ""3-Iron"" provides a great deal of rich material.

A note on the music, for those who were captivated by the song Tae-suk plays. It is a song called ""Hafsa"" and can be found on Natacha Atlas' 1997 CD ""Halim.""",1279843200,16,8438,4.766757865937072

It takes you sometime before you realize that the two main characters in the movie have no dialogue at all. The story is told only by the supporting cast who speak. The strength of the movie comes also from the fact that they have used the actors to convey their feelings only through actions so it leaves a lot to imagination. Watch the movie for the cinematic experience and also for the different story. Couple of scenes are very different and leave a mark.

the young man in this story is a tad bit immoral - he steals into homes of vacationers to eat and sleep - evidently without tarnishing his kharma - even the sin of an accident he causes can be washed away with a very few tears

one time - he meets a woman with a freshly bruised face - who escapes her brutal husband by joining him in his meandering lifestyle - the connection of this appealing couple is so tender that spoken words aren't necessary - and their sexual restraint only intensifies the air of eroticism

i suppose aiding this extremely attractive woman enhances his kharma - as does the repair of the broken cd player - even tho he does it for his own purposes - hopefully - the behavior presented doesnt represent buddhist ethics

aside from that - this is an unusually affecting love story - with buddhist metaphor used to good effect

2350110,4,B000A1OFZA,"Subtitled in Shakespearean English, this film has witty dialogue, action, comedy and tragedy. For those who don't know much about Korean history or culture, the film opens a window into the ancient Korean court life and the ruddy strife of common Seoul folk during the Chosun Dynasty.

The story also suggests a blurred distinction between male friendship and homosexuality, as the feelings between the three male protagonists wavers between deep, undying friendship and a romantic love triangle. On one point of this triangle sits an emporer whose scarring childhood, the film supposes, led him to become one of the cruelest and most mercurial leaders in Korea's history. On the opposite point is an ambitious jester, who takes the risky gamble of satirizing the royal court in order to draw its attention and by doing so to be pulled closer into the court's circle of attention, where he believes there's money to be made. Connecting these two is a feminine man who plays a woman in the comic shows the two jesters perform. His relationship with the other jester is one of deep love, although there's ambiguity about whether this is platonic or romantic. However, the two become divided when the emporer falls in love, in a sense, with the feminine jester. The emporer's own feelings come across as the a mixture of the innocent childlike desire for a playmate and the homoerotic desire for a partner that was unsatisfied by his infamous female concubine.

Summary: An excellent movie by any measure. This film is fascinating historically and socially; it's very intelligently written and acted; and it's full of both comedy and a tragic element. This would be a great film for viewers of any age, although more mature viewers are more likely to appreciate its layers and depth. By way of caution for younger viewers: there are several risqu&eacute; sexual scenes, including a female homoerotic scene when a protagonist visits one of Seoul's brothels; there is also mild violence occassionally.",1251763200,,1996,5.045454545454546
2350111,4,B000A1OFZA,"Here's EXACTLY what you need to know about 3-IRON before you watch it.

It's a Buddhist allegory. Period. You can take a million things away from it, because that's the magic of cinema, and more power to you for it, but the heart of the film is overlooked in the 35 generally well-intentioned reviews posted to the Amazon listing as I write this. Somewhere, perhaps, Kim Ki-duk gently smiles, knowing that few, if any (including the mainstream critics) truly comprehended allegory underlying the seemingly generic spirituality of his film, even if they adored the final result. Reviewers who may not see or understand this crucial aspect of the film (which IS concrete), but still love the picture itself for its myriad other charms, often reach for -- and frequently grapple with -- elaborate obfuscation to describe what it's ""really"" about, or subjectively pronounce it ""deep"" or full of ""hidden meaning"" in order to dance around the fact that they may be unable to articulate the allegorical underpinnings of the work (which is objective, albeit subtle). Hardly a bad thing, although those who dislike or hate it inevitably cry that it ""didn't make sense"".

But it does make sense. If you're a Buddhist, I suppose. And anyone familiar with the work of Kim Ki-duk should know that he often infuses it with Buddhist philosophy, even while allowing the viewer -- by default in most cases -- to ponder the proceedings any way they see fit, based on their own personal life experience.

There are three stages to enlightenment in Buddhism. The following is a gross simplification on my part, but it should make it extremely easy to see the three stages as they're delineated in the film.

1) IMPERMANENCE: there is no ""self"" to cling to; existence is impermanent; and desire leads to suffering. Understanding this allows one to achieve detachment and make desire extinct. ALL OF THIS describes the first portion of 3-IRON.

2) TRANQUILITY AND INSIGHT THROUGH MEDITATION: one must build up a sense of the ""non-self"" through meditation. This is what the lead character does during his time in prison. No prison guard in the real world would be that susceptible to Tae-Suk's little games, but because this is ALLEGORY, the guard becomes the litmus strip by which Tae-Suk measures his ability to become invisible to (and one with) the world around him. Once he's released, he tests this further by revisiting the homes he previously broke into, only this time with the residents inside.

3) NIRVANA: Impurities are eliminated. Purity and pleasantness remain. The ""walls"" that separate the (artificial) individuality of the self from the totality of Being are torn down, not unlike the walls of a house. Thus the film's Korean title translation as ""Empty House"", which describes so much more than the simple constructs this young man breaks into. Likewise, once Tae-Suk has achieved a certain one-ness, or non-ness, he can effectively hide in plain sight, much to the delight of the reinvigorated Sun-Hwa, who now realizes she can tolerate her scuzzball husband (and be the wife he clearly expects her to be) because her lover will always be part of the universe in which she lives. Physically, he's still there (and very much alive, contrary to what some reviewers would have you believe because the subtext remains out of their grasp), but he's achieved his own brand of Nirvana. He no longer needs to desire this woman and fear the suffering her husband is capable of inflicting, because he can be with her all the time right under the villain's nose. Thus, they've both achieved Nirvana (don't forget, she follows him on his path to enlightenment). It may not be the conventional method, and it may require tinkering with a bathroom scale to reinforce what they believe they've done (that's religion for ya!), but in essence, that's exactly what they've done.

Some people might try to argue something along the lines of ""well, if the husband turned around really quickly, he'd see the guy"" but because this is an ALLEGORY, that will never happen.

So don't listen to those people.

You may now watch (or rewatch) 3-IRON with some additional enlightenment.

(p.s. I'm not a Buddhist. I believe religion to be a galactic waste of time and resources. I simply enjoy allegorical filmmaking that doesn't punch me in the face.",1238371200,10,4319,4.9366391184573

The woman, Sun-hwa, finds herself in a miserable silence, her husband has just beaten her and she reflects on her life and marriage.  As this happens, a young man named Tae Suk breaks into her home and begins his odd routines of getting comfortable and carrying out chores and minor repairs around the house.  He witnessed Sun-hwa's husband leaving but is unaware that she's home and watching him.  In the presence of an intruder, at a moment that one normally panics, her curiosity causes her to remain silent and watch him.  After watching him a while, she seems to realize that he is not a threat and reveals her presence.  The scene described here is loaded with subtext and surprisingly free of dialogue.  She seems to recognize that he lives in a silence of his own and that he is quite noble if in a bizzare way.  His silence seems to be part of his nobility.

Sun-hwa's husband returns at this point and after an unlikely confrontation between the two men, Sun-hwa leaves her home, her husband and her voice (so to speak).  Without saying a word, she leaves with Tae Suk.  The silence that Tae Suk and Sun-hwa share evolves into a profound sort of parallel universe that is barely detectable to others.  They continue with his lifestyle of squatting and there almost seems to be a sense of purpose in how they live.  They must, in a humble way, survive and make the world better one house (or apartment) at a time.

The plot thickens as law enforcement becomes involved but Tae Suk's and Sun-hwa's silence is unshaken.  Their lives seem not to fit in with any part of the normal world.  Sun-hwa's husband and police inspectors are left to attempt understanding the relationship between Tae Suk and Sun-hwa.  It's as if nothing could really be said by the two lovers that wouldn't somehow damage or diminish what they had.

2350131,4,B000A1OFZA,"Few years ago, Korea came up with its version of ""Dangerous Liasons"" based on the French novel of the same name and it triumphed starring ""Yongsama"", the actor who was literally stalked by mainly Japanese housewives and grandmothers after his performance at TV series, ""Winter Sonata"".  Then, I was hungrily seeking for yet another Korean historical political intrigue and ""The Royal Jester"" doesn't disappoint.  This offering is loosely based upon the writing of the Korean Emperor during the 16th century (Chosun Dynasty) of his affection for his courtjester.  This movie is rather a combination of different things.  It can also be deemed a Korean version of ""Farewell my Concubine"" where two actors (one masculine and another feminine even though they are both males) decided to try their trade at Seoul after running away from countryside where a freak accident has them injured fatally their gangleader. There, they befriended three other actors .  Without a doubt, the two main characters are the talented duos and they  have the audacity to play to the folks regarding the hearsay of the Korean Emperor and his favourite Empress. They get (un)wanted attention & sentenced to death.  Somehow, they cheat death by being able to make the  Emperor happy.  Alas, the actors become the pawns of political intrigue.  Originally, under the guidance of the Emperor's faithfuly advisor, the actors are instructed to play the stories of corrupted Ministers for all to see and swiftly bringing them to justice.  The ploy works for a while until it becomes pear-shaped as the Emperor becomes more incorrigble and losing his mind in the way he conducts the affairs of the nation.  He becomes more like a tyrant or a despot.  By then, the Pandora Box is opened and the actors know that it's time for them to leave the Palace before they become tangled in crossfire.  Unfortunately, the Emperor falls for the feminine actor and that causes tension between him and the masculine actor who's always fending for him.  This movie gives us an impression of Korea during 16th century and it also brings to the fore the significance of live theatre, akin to the ""Kabuki"" performance in Japanese society during that time where comedy is always a perverted or twisted interpretation of reality, and for that moment, simple folks can forget about their daily grinds and laughing at themselves.  Naturally, the story shall come to a satisfying open-ended conclusion where triumph of the human spirit rules supreme.  This is yet another successful Korean bittersweet masterpiece.  It's never contrived and wonderfully crafted.  It totally deserves its kudo for being this year Korea's highest grossest movie.  Highly recommended.",1165449600,17,2709,5.12756264236902
2350132,3,B000A1OFZA,"""3-Iron"" is a very odd, idiosyncratic work from South Korean filmmaker Ki-duk Kim.  In the highly unusual premise, Tae-suk is a young, golf-obsessed homeless man who breaks into the houses and apartments of people who are away on either business trips or vacations - not to steal from them but simply to have a comfortable place to stay temporarily.  In one of those homes, he meets a beautiful young woman whose husband physically and mentally abuses her and with whom Tae-suk strikes up a strange but meaningful relationship.  Together, they roam from empty residence to empty residence, experiencing many strange events and encounters as they go.

In the film's most bizarre conceit, Tae-suk and Sun-hwa never say a single word either to each other or to anyone else throughout the course of the movie.  This puts an added strain not only on the actors who must convey all their characters' thoughts and emotions through gestures and facial expressions, but on the audience as well.  Indeed, many people may shut this movie off out of simple frustration and confusion.  Others, however, searching for the different and the offbeat, may find the movie strangely compelling and even quite touching

Kim creates a world that becomes increasingly more illusory as the story unfolds, to the point that, by the final scenes, we no longer have any idea what is ""real"" and what is not.  ""3-Iron"" is a slow-moving, patience-demanding work that draws us into its enigmatic world and that truly pays off in the end.",1163203200,4,1507,4.948412698412699

Odd, upsetting, exhilerating, tender and dreamy.  I don't think that everyone will like it, but I definitely think it's worth watching to find out.",1162080000,,339,4.728813559322034
2350134,4,B000A1OFZA,"somewhat an uninformed user mentioned he couldn't follow the movie well because the dialogue was done in cantonese :)

1. the original title is: The King's Man. the english title is somewhat misleading. the director and marketing company should not have concerned with the overtly homosexual nature of the film considering homosexuality is more accepted outside korea.

2. the story: as it appeared on cnn, the film was highly controversial because it was the first mainstream movie of highest box-office gross that employed the overt gay sexual theme in conservative korea. here we have two male crowns from long time ago in korea. one is very womanly beautiful and effeminate, and another one serious and quiet but secretly in love with. being tired of their boss's trying to hook the effeminate clown with rich men in towns they play, those two guys break their tie and kill the boss and run away to Seoul, where they forms a clown group eventually to attract the attention of a high-ranking official who introduces their king-mockery show to the atrocious king himself, on one condition that if they make the king laugh, then their life will be saved or be executed. the king instead of being indignant at the mockery show, falls in love with AND the effeminate clown. the clown group become the palace in-house entertainers for the king and courtiers, and perform mostly to ridicule the corruptions of the high-ranking officials, and to expose, intentionally, the sad life of the king. thus the clowns' stay in the palace intensifies the already high-tension relationship of courtiers to the king, who in korean history, is somewhat equivalent to nero of rome, in terms of atrocity. the king himself falls in love with the crown further to bring a destruction to his own relationship with his female lover and the court, and ultimately to the very relationship of those two male crowns who decide to end their life tragically at the end. the crowns had nothing but freedom. but the king had everything but freedom.

3. highest box-office gross in south korea: so far, it's the number one movie (August 2006) with highest grossing of close to $100 million(equivalent to $600million hit in the state).

4. the political nature of the film: the film is marketed to provoke interests of homosexuality and the detailed life of traditional korean crowns, unknown well to the modern mass population. but, it was the political nature of the larger theme of this movie that attracted the healthy number of audience of various age group that ultimately led to the very success. many number of audience felt related to the uninhibited and rock-shattering performance of crowns that mocked the corruptions and irony of the courtiers, and understood what the performance meant to the crowns and to the king, a truly vicarious experience for the audience in politically confused and somewhat stagnant korean society now days.

5. the film boasts excellent acting, story, and the speed of story development. an interesting look at traditional korean jestor, rich and extravagant palace costumes, music, and life of ancient korean society. it's a truly worth of trying, even just out of curiosity for a highest grossing south korean film.",1155772800,3,3227,5.013059701492537
2350135,3,B000A1OFZA,"The King and the Clown goes back to 1504. It's a story of two men in love with each other and a gruesome king. Although I don't follow Cantonese, I quite liked the dialogues. I enjoyed the drama feel and being a period film, it does rather well. Had the film been a little more overdramatic and powerful, I'd have liked it more. It seems to sag, cause the characters seldom change, the end too predictable. Nonetheless, credit is worth to the actors and performers. Worth watching.",1155513600,,481,4.540229885057471

2350147,4,B000A1OFZA,"I personally love this movie but still give it a 4 since I know my taste in movies cater more to these kinds, as a result I think I tend to overlook some of the shortcomings possibly.

In any case, this is a great movie because it is such a breath of fresh air and departure from your typical movie. The lack of dialogue by the central characters is at first hard to grasp since you feel the story isn't properly being told. But as you watch you realize words can often get in the way of conveying emotions and that those characters that do talk may only be doing so because of their immaturity or lack of brain power.

There are a number of levels at which you can analyze this movie, which helps make it enjoyable everytime you watch it. You can watch it simply for the story being told, or how each character develops and is portrayed throughout the film. Even the cinematography is something to really pay attention to since it really helps tell the story.

The soundtrack (if it can be called that) is beautifully done. Like words, music is often used to imply what the audience should feel. Without it, some people feel lost and don't know how to react to scenes but as long as you keep your wits about you, the movie's lack of music is a positive. Where music is used in the movie its at seemingly all the right times and well done.",1154563200,2,1339,4.284584980237154
2350148,4,B000A1OFZA,"Set in 16th Century Korea, it is a touching love story between two clowns who perform in the street.  The older is a tough, witty, and shrewd guy, while the younger is a slender, delicate, beautiful, and shy female-impersonator.  The older performer gets into a fight with the head of their group because he forces the young performer to have sex with rich clients.  When his partner is about to be maimed, the young man kills his aggressor.  They flee to Seoul and become a troupe, adding three other performers they meet, and the older performer becomes their ""Captain"".  To get more money from the crowds, he foolishly decides to mock the King in their theatrical acts.  Passing by, and having listened to them, an attendant of the King orders them to be flogged.  The ""Captain"" protests and suggests to perform to the King who, he claims, will like their act.  The attendant, wishing to please the King, decides to find out, but warns them that if the King does not like it, ""their heads will roll"".

The King does like and enjoy their act so much that he orders that they stay within the palace, despite vehement objections from his Court.  He quickly becomes infatuated with the young beautiful performer and invites him every night to his quarters, chasing away his concubine.  After being mocked by the clowns (to the great amusement of the King who fires two of them), members of the Court plot to assassinate the young man, but he is not harmed, and the King kills two of his Ministers involved in the plot.  The concubine forges the hand writing of the young man and accuses him of writing posters slandering the King allover Seoul and shows them to the King.  In order to save him from being killed, his partner claims himself the author of the posters.  The King orders him to be executed the following morning and the young man pleads him to spare his life.  Having been released by the attendant who brought them to the palace, he does  not escape and awakes the King by mocking him in the courtyard.  The King goes out to slaughter him with his sward but the young man convinces him to spare his life.  The King orders the ""Captain"" to be blinded.

In the evening, the young man is entertaining the King with puppets behind a screen, and slits his wrist, then falls down in his blood.  The King is horrified and does not understand why.  He is treated and his life is saved.  The King is dethroned by his court, and the two partners happily get back together again, performing in the street.

The photography is superb, with beautiful scenery and colors; the costumes are elegant; the sets are fascinating; the direction is excellent, as well as the acting.  Apart from street  performances (which are very crude though funny), the treatment of the relationship between the young man and his partner, on one side, and the King, on the other side, is very subtle and discreet. The movie has almost a ""shakespeare-like"" dramatic atmosphere, with Court intrigues, plots, assassinations, etc.

I highly recommend it for those who like ancient Asian culture, and romantic love affairs.  It should be noted that according to some press articles, the movie has broken all records at the box office in Korea !!",1153872000,8,3218,4.6696269982238015
2350149,5,B000A1OFZA,"3-Iron is another wave of the little set of wonderful Korean films to arrive on our shores of late.  It eloquently tells a story speaking very few words.  The protaganist, Tae-suk lives a quiet unassuming life slipping into the homes of other people and it is not only his person which becomes invisible.  His personality becomes equally transparent.  He is a chameleon - one minute kind and tender, the next meting out cold and savage justice without seeming to feel a thing.  The girl, Sun-hwa is a perfect counterpart for him.  She has subsumed her own feelings to the point of vanishing herself.  They move silently together, encountering death and repairing each other's invisible wounds.  In the final sequences of the film we see Sun-hwa seeing her lover over her husband's shoulder, but what does she see?  Is it Tae-suk or a ghost, or has there ever been a Tae-suk at all?",1151798400,4,881,4.743421052631579
2350150,5,B000A1OFZA,"This movie is pretty much described well enough by everyone who writes about it, indeed.  It is about a transient man who breaks into people's houses and lives there for a few hours or a night, paying them back with repairs and housework.  When he meets the woman and they go off and live the same life together, it seems a rather tragic story as they keep running into trouble here and there, even getting caught a few times (admittedly, a couple of times they were just being stupid about it).

However this film is much more than that and much more lasting.  The mute protagonist makes a sort of consummate rogue as he rises over the ability to just be sneaky and quiet and eventually transcends physical presence himself.  He makes for the rogues of yore, whose clockworks and absolute silence make them invisible to all but those that he chooses to reveal himself to.

What results is a lyrical and transcendental story of one who takes the ravages and judgements of the world with stoicism and, through the transcendence, redeems one who is the needless target of all that hatred.  Even those who work to help (the police) do nothing to save the abused housewife from her unloving husband, but their own abuse of the silent spectator eventually molds itself into a powerful presence that is somehow able to save her while allowing the world itself to go on, thinking it has won when it is merely nonexistant to the dreams and desires of those who feel and see and know how to find ghosts.

2350151,5,B000A1OFZA,"Not since the era of Charley Chaplin has silence been so golden.  Tae-suk (Hyun-kyoon Lee)gets by breaking into empty houses and living in them.  He does this by leaving a restaurant menu taped to the door and coming back to see if it's still there, but on one fated day he invades a home with someone in it.  Sun-hwa (Seung-yeon Lee) is a deeply depressed house wife with an abusive husband.  When Tae-suk breaks into her home she is so defeated and broken that she decides to just watch him.  After waking to find Sun-hwa staring at him, Tae-suk immediately leaves, but not before he overhears her husband harassing her through the answering machine.  Overridden with guilt he comes back and rescues her from the clutches of her villainous husband, and they set out to journey through the rest of the movie together.

 The first thing one would notice about this movie is that the main characters never speak.  This presents a problem that i feel the director (Ki-duk Kim) overcomes masterfully.  Just as Chaplin made the blind girl think the tramp was a millionaire by the sound of a car door closing, the actors also give subtle hints about the roles they portray.  Tae-suk is portrayed as a person with whom you sympathize with rather then an evil intruder.  Even though he breaks into a house, once inside he will not steal anything.  He also fixes broken electronics, rearranges the furniture, and even does the inhabitants laundry.  Seung-yeon Lee does an amazing job showing emotion without speech.  Most of it is due to her expressive eyes and mastery of facial expressions.

 Three Iron is one of the best examples of how a romance story should be told.  For too long directors have been using the phrase of ""I love you"" as a crutch.  Those words have lose all meaning when the audience, or worse yet the actors, don't feel what they are trying to convey.  One look shared between Tae-suk and Sun-hwa had more feeling in it then the entire movies I have seen before.  Ki-duk Kim, who also directed the critically acclaimed Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring, has made an amazing feat by creating a true universal romance move.  The key to Chaplin's success was that you did not have to speak English to enjoy his movies, and you do not have to speak Korean to enjoy this one.

 Sad part of the story is that nobody will see this movie.  The film was made in only 16 days and the screen play took less then a month to write due to the lack of dialog.  It does not have any commercial running on television, nor was it shown in many American theaters.  This is a low budget film from Korea, which means that it will be stereotyped along with all the other independent films.  It currently ranks in the Eight Thousands of the top selling DVDs, which considering it's success in Asia and Europe is very sad.  I feel that given the right publicity this movie could be the next Blair Witch, but for now it will remain a hidden treasure on the shelves of blockbuster and in the foreign films section of FYE.",1145404800,4,3019,4.559479553903346

If more people listened to the little silences between them instead of filling them up with drivel there'd be far less angst in the world!  Too bad about the title, though.  The translation of the original Korean title is ""Empty House"", not ""3 Iron"".  Much more appropriate title, though, perhaps, it could have been called ""Quishin Do"", or ""Way of the Ghost"" and been as apt!",1141084800,4,451,4.730769230769231
2350153,5,B000A1OFZA,"I have never seen a movie where two people fall in love and the entire movie they don't even know eachothers name. This is a weird movie and it has such a different style to it but it works. Tae-suk wonders around a neighborhood leaving fast food menu's on doors and in the first minutes you say oh he must a delivery boy and soon after you find out this is not the case.

After leaving a menu on every door he leaves and comes back at night to start doing his odd job. Whichever house with a menu still on he assumes this person is out of town then proceeds to pick his way into their home and starts doing whatever good he can. Now if you haven't read the back of the DVD case you think he must be a thief and for some crazy reason he's not. He just fixes whatever's broken, cleans whatever's dirty, takes pictures of himself with the house and then treats himself to whatever food is in the fridge and cleans himself.

He continues to do this until he goes into the wrong but the right house. In the home he finds a women that has been physically and mentaly abused by her husband. The two fall for eachother and she joins him in his routine. The only thing I think some people might find wrong is that a lot of questions go unanswered. I understand that this is one of those films that will end like that but it still seemed at least some of this mystery could of been told. This kid repeats this but he drives a very expensive BMW motorcycle and later in the movie you find out he has a college degree so why does he do this but you never find out any of his background and the same goes for his new girlfriend.

The two of them never say a word to eachother until the end so if you think that their mutes their not they just chose not to speak. All this is missing but I still have to give this film 5 stars because it's so different from any movie I've ever seen and it's a very good one watch it and you'll understand what I'm saying. The actors are right on point the surroundings fit with the movie and characters. I recommend watching this at night or when your more calm and have the patients.",1135814400,4,2105,4.104368932038835

2350155,5,B000A1OFZA,"""3-Iron"" is a delightful surprise.  Kim Ki-duk's ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter"" was so lyrical and so cinematically beautiful that it is amazing that this DVD keeps up that film's quality.  The fact that most of the film is nonverbal makes this subtitled drama particularly easy for international audiences to adopt.  Jae Hee Song as the young lead Tae-suk is good looking and keeps our eyes glued to the screen.  The unusual plot of a young man who breaks into houses and apartments while the owners are away is filled with lyrical details.  In one scene, he carefully selects a toothbrush before sitting on the toilet brushing his teeth.  He seems to experience the lives of the people by seeing their surroundings, cleaning their clothes, fixing appliances & eating their food.  Lee Seung-yeon was in a 1996 film about a serial killer called ""Pianoman"" before taking on the role of Sun-hwa.  Sun is an abused wife of a controlling husband.  Tae-suk inhabits her house as she quietly observes him taking a bath and reveals herself to him as he lies in her bed self-stimulating to nude pictures of her from an album.  Her middle aged controlling husband Min-kyo played by Gweon Hyeok-ho returns from a business trip.  He has bruised her face and bloodied her lip and blames her for not picking up the phone and speaking to him.  Depressed, she falls into an exquisite wordlessness that suits Tae-suk's observant lifestyle of stepping into other people's lives.  After the husband has slapped his wife, Tae-suk launches golf balls into the squealing husband.  When Sun-hwa flees with Tae-suk on his motorcyle, they enter a series of other people's homes, relaxing on a red sofa looking out on an interior garden, being in the home of a boxer and finally finding the body of an elderly person that they clean, wrap and bury according to custom.  Not each of Tae-suk's attempts wind up benign, however, as he injures a person in a car with a golf ball and perhaps results in the shooting of a young mother.  Ju Jin-mo plays the corrupt detective who eventually charges Tae-suk and releases Sun-hwa to the prison of her husband.  Tae-suk immediately applies his observation of minute detail to his jail cell, memorizing the floor, exploring the walls and completely making himself at home.  Lee Ju-suk is the abusive jailer who repeatedly investigates an apparently empty cell as Tae-suk mirrors each movement and stays directly behind the jailer.  It is breathtaking cinema for the incorporation of martial arts-like movement and dance in to the simplest of surroundings.  The film concludes with Tae-suk's escape and revisiting of houses into which he had previously broken.  It climaxes with him reuniting with Sun-hwa, kissing her as she hugs her husband.  ""3-Iron"" is a wonderful delight, quite different from the heavy-handed car-crash Hollywood-style blockbuster, pixie-like in its sweetness and simplicity.  It explores the sometimes small distance between life and dream.  Bravo!",1132531200,25,2985,5.044897959183674
2350156,5,B000A1OFZA,"If you appreciate elegance, depth, and keen intelligence in a ghost story, don't miss 3-Iron. Oh, it's a ghost story, all right, a ghost story from start to finish, painfully romantic and simultaneously quite erotic but neither sentimental nor vulgar at any time, spooky in the best possible sense, not in the clumsy, overt, ham-fisted fashion of the usual U.S.-made ghost story but, rather, spooky in the sense of haunting, resonant, elusive, shivery.

It's too bad that the other reviewers here felt the need to include so many plot spoilers in their comments because 3-Iron deserves the opportunity to unfold its mysteries to the viewer in its own unique way, a way I've never seen before in a ghost story on film. I keep calling it a ghost story because that's what I believe 3-Iron to be above all else and how I feel it would be best approached for maximum enjoyment and comprehension.

Speaking of hauntingly elegant, I couldn't keep my eyes off the lead male actor in 3-Iron. His ethereal beauty and grace lend him the ghostly charisma that anchors and informs this story, a grand love story that doesn't necessarily take place anywhere except in the mind and heart of a desperate woman who yearns for the appearance of a savior in her life to transport her beyond the confines of her gilded cage, but you be the judge of what's ""real"" in 3-Iron and what's not, or, better yet, don't bother with such trivia and just let this magnificent ghost story sweep you away.",1131148800,,1473,4.705426356589148
