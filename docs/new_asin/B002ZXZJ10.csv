4042917,5,B002ZXZJ10,"These are the best little videos!  Charlie & Lola are brother & sister, and Charlie sure sets a good example of what it is like to be a GOOD big brother.  I have never, once, found anything offensive in these videos for my children (I have 3 boys).  They have always enjoyed them, still - my oldest son is 10!  I enjoy these videos.  They are funny, cute and have very good morals, values and lessons to them.  Kids can let their imaginations soar with Lola's own imagination.  They have a British accent, but you can easily understand them.  You can't go wrong with any Charlie & Lola!  Very Highly Recommended!",1348876800,,612,4.441441441441442

4042920,4,B002ZXZJ10,"My Pre-K daughter loves this series and they meet my foremost criteria for kid- centered media: the characters must be nice to one another! These are charming stories without being saccharine, and the kids sound and act like kids and not snarky or ironic little adults.",1312588800,,269,4.869565217391305
4042921,5,B002ZXZJ10,"My two girls, 6 and 4 years old, love the Charlie and Lola series.  We have even sent the vidoes to their schools and the teachers love them as well.  They are age appropriate stories that my girls can both enjoy and learn from.",1300838400,,228,4.159090909090909

4042924,5,B002ZXZJ10,"Our family of five all love Charlie and Lola, and this latest offering is as good as all the others. Funny, unique, original and very British. It's an anglophile's dream-come-true...Wonderful stuff..truly...",1270512000,,207,5.709677419354839
4042925,5,B002ZXZJ10,"We've loved Charlie and Lola from the beginning...the new episodes aren't quite as good as the older ones in my opinion, but are still better than 90% of the children's programming that's out there.  The two main characters are siblings and portray a sibling relationship that I hope my kids will grow up to emulate.

Here's the episode list that seems to always be missing from the product description and is always the one thing I want to know:
I Can't Stop Hiccupping
I am Completely Hearing and Also Listening
Our Shop Sells Everything
I've got Nobody to Play With
Thunder Completely does not Scare Me
I Really Absolutely Must have Glasses
It is Very Special and Extremely Ancient
But Marv is Absolutely Charlie's Best Friend
I am Inventing a Usefullish Invention

All in all, another great Charlie and Lola DVD.",1269734400,42,816,4.773049645390071

8385448,5,B002ZXZJ10,"We own the entire set of the Charlie and Lola series (volumes 1 though 10, which gives us 80 episodes).  Disney Jr aired this show when little ones where waking up each morning, but when Disney Jr took the series off air we where very disappointed!  We couldn't be with out Charlie and Lola, so I quickly researched and purchased the whole set (which I found more reasonably priced buying each dvd individually).  We do not have a favorite season or show; we love them all!  Definitely a crowd pleaser up to eight years old, but even as an adult, I have no problem sitting down and watching with the little ones, so may hold a wider age range than I just suggested.",1427760000,,665,4.382113821138211
