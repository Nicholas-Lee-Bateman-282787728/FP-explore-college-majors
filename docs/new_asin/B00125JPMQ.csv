3076582,5,B00125JPMQ,"I'm not surprised that this didn't catch on; the overwhelming success of ""Briefcase Or No Briefcase"" tells us all we need to know about the mental agility of the average American.

However, if you have more than two brain cells to rub together, this is worth seeing. It's a half-season that was completely filmed before ever being shown, and it's nicely cohesive and engaging. The effect is that of a very long movie a la ""Groundhog Day"" but with a gritty action/adventure twist.

It's a shame that shows like this no longer find an audience big enough to satisfy the producers' avarice, but over a half-century of leftist dumb-down has rendered the bulk of the populace incapable of comprehending anything as intricate and involving as this.

In summary: if you think most TV sucks, and miss the days of solid storytelling and inspired casting, you will probably like this very much. If you think ""The Apprentice"" constitutes ""quality entertainment,"" then you probably won't be able to follow this show.

If you're tired of ""Who Wants To Marry A Marmot"" then check this out.",1202601600,5,1075,4.85792349726776

3076584,5,B00125JPMQ,"I am baffled as to why this show didn't catch on, it was amazing. The writing, cinematography and (perhaps most of all) the performances were all top-notch. Taye Diggs, Jonathan Banks and Adam Baldwin are particular standouts among an engaging cast. The camera work was stunning, especially in HD, with L.A. in a palette of rich reds and oranges. The story was beautifully intricate -- if cut off too soon.

I don't see any bonus features listed here. If true, that's a real disappointment. I would be very interested in hearing about the show's influences and (like many others) I'd like to hear about what plans the writers had to tie up loose ends.

A final note: One of the last scenes in Day Break had its music replaced at the last minute due to cost issues. It was a terrible change and I very much hope it's been rectified for the DVD. [...]

UPDATE: As far as the last scene, the broadcast music is also on the DVD, unfortunately.",1201219200,11,939,4.511764705882353
3076585,5,B00125JPMQ,"Day Break was a terrific show, I never understood why it didn't catch on.  It's kind of a blend between ""24"" and ""Groundhog Day"", and felt as fresh and fun to watch as those both did in the beginning.  While the show was cancelled, all the episodes were completed, and the series feels complete.  In a way maybe it's better the show didn't last, as it never had time to grow stale.

3076586,5,B00125JPMQ,"Day Break was one of the finest contemporary series ever. Cerebral in nature, a real thought provoking series that really inspires one to elucidate the flow of the story every minute.  Most were only able to view 6 full-framed broad-casted episodes with commercials along with those fortunate enough to have caught the remaining seven widescreen episodes on a computer monitor over the Internet.

One of the many unique aspects of this fascinating show is the brilliance in its casting.  The cast consists of a broad spectrum of ethnicity that delightfully, does NOT have anything to do with the storyline.  Just fine actors playing their parts to perfection.

I never imagined I would ever see this series again. It will be a pure delight to view the entire series commercial free & in an aspect ratio of 1.78:1. I think everyone will have varying opinions interpreting each episode all the way to the very last scene!  Enjoy!!!",1199836800,51,929,4.923076923076923

Taye Diggs is Detective Brett Hopper will be accused of shooting state attorney Alberto Garza.  and will continue to offer his rock solid alibi.  He will realize he's been framed and he will run.  Then he will wake up and start the day over again.  This time he'll do it differently--and will continue to until
he finds out who's framing him, gets his gang witness to court to testify, and saves the lives of his loved ones.  Hopper has only one advantage in his
favor--he remembers everything he did the day prior that did not work.  It's a painful way to learn, because he also carries the bruises and battle

3076610,5,B00125JPMQ,"Day Break is a polished Touchstone TV series with a compellingly strange premise: Groundhog Day recast as a police procedural. It even includes the classic movies close-up of a flip-display clock showing the same time over and over. Yet unlike the films weatherman Phil Connors, whose nose is rubbed in his moral failings, Detective Brett Hopper has to uncover failures of his detective work regarding a murder for which he is being framed. The plot is an intriguing maze in which on every repeated day Hopper makes a new mistake, and every day someone suffers for it. Hopper is driven by having to protect himself and others, including his threatened girlfriend, and his frequent errors make him credible and someone to root for. None of the episodes are particularly violent. Only six of the thirteen episodes were broadcast originally, and the ratings declined, probably because it must have been hard to follow the plot when you had to wait a week for the next chapter. On DVD, of course, this problem dissolves. We binge-viewed all thirteen chapters in three or four sessions, and it was usually hard to stop watching. The DVD includes a jocular yet revelatory commentary by director Rob Bowman of The X-Files and Castle, and writer Paul Zbyzewsky, who worked on Lost.",1388880000,2,1273,4.925581395348837

3076612,4,B00125JPMQ,And there is plenty of action. The writing is very creative and very good. Groundhog Day meets high cop drama. I would recommend this for everyone. It's very good.,1381795200,,163,4.655172413793103
3076613,5,B00125JPMQ,"I didn't expect DAY BREAK to be as good as it is. It is not for viewers with IQ's under room temperature. It's tricky as it is risky, sophisticated, avant garde and needs a bit of
time and exposure to get into your head. Once there you'll appreciate the complex script,
characters and unorthodox concept.

No, it's not a knock off of GROUNDHOGS DAY; DAY BREAK a whole other animal, very sophisticated and put together to draw you in.  You will get hooked; buy not right away. Its complexity will challenge you. Unlike many TV plots today, thinking is required. And shrewd observation and the realization that what's obvious isn't all there is.

It will take some (very enjoyable) deductions  to get into the right mindset. Once there you'll really be challenged and certainly edge-of-your-sofa entertained. Your perception should be, as a bad guy character says, that decisions lead to consequences. Maybe it was Aristotle who first thought up the line, like 'for ever cause there are many effects; for every effect, many causes. There are many clever causes and effects here. All real, all believable and mostly exciting.

It  took me two viewings to get what was going down. Three to really appreciate the fine
writing and so-unique concept and direction. A virtue with DAY BREAK is that you'll be able to
see it many times and each time see, enjoy more. I'm now looking forward very much to re-view
and expect to view again.

Production, from acting to editing, posh green LA venues to hot women and either cool or cruel
men is first-class. I lived and working in media writing and never saw better locations. In all, DB is the best mini-series I've seen in a long while. It should've, could've been a major theatrical release. It would have been a sensation with its new actors and attitudes and action. The deep, complex plot's
a wonder.

And wonder of wonders, the more the onion's peeled the better it gets. The final denouement is
believable and hard to believe at the same time. Give it time, you'll see what's what. I watched as I, under my breath kept saying ""aha and oh yeah and (expletive deleted)now I get it. DB's an education In the Making Of segments you'll see some dedicated young filmmakers talking about the risks they took and why the risks were worth it, whether they were accepted or not by some viewers. I agreed. For me everything in DB was worth it; surprising and memorable. I'll wait a month or months and see it all again.

Surprisingly, seeing it more than once, the surprise quotient stays high. Mostly when surprises are revealed it's a rush. Will you guess the surprises? Many will, many will hit replay to go back to the scene and see what led to the consequences.

Taye Diggs is perfectly cast as a hard cop with compassion, one who makes mistakes and accepts the humanity (failings included) of other characters, good or bad people - and those lines are blurred throughout the595 MINUTES. Every character is real and human as can be. They're mostly familiar faces and a great very balanced, true to live ensemble.

Okay, enough raving. This fine show lasted one season? The rumors that bean counters lack taste and and feel viewers are are mostly oblivious. DAY BREAK is a bargain now; get to Amazon Marketplace and get it for a lot less than it's worth; it's far more than worth its price.",1375660800,2,3327,4.679794520547945
3076614,5,B00125JPMQ,"I was oblivious to the existence of this series until I spotted it on a popular online streaming service last month.

I must say that I found the series thoroughly enjoyable. Time is a mysterious little bugger, in an old chestnut sort of way. The story has a knack for highlighting the value of ignorance; trying to know the unknown is exciting. Once the previously unknown is known, however, that excitement fades rather quickly. And no matter how much one knows, mistakes are still part and parcel of the human experience, or just the way things go, and, you know, what are you going to do about it?

The show has action, mystery, suspense, relationship drama, and also some careful (and somewhat slow moving) philosophical moments. So why did this series fail so colossally on its first run?

I'd imagine that this show would have been difficult to keep up with in once-a-week doses. This show does require careful attention or else you can easily lose your way. It is not the type of show to ""watch"" in the background while you're texting everybody and updating your social media status and playing video games and so on. I watched it over a three day period, and if I had spread it out any more, I probably would have had to backtrack over some of it again in order to get up to speed. It is a very dense show.

The production values are good, it is photographed well with plenty of exterior scenes. You'd really be cheating yourself if you don't watch it in HD (at least 720p). In fact, I'd save it for another time if an HD source isn't available.",1375315200,,1554,4.5

The plot is concrete in episode one, but the whole show and the characters in it evolve over time. This is actually a series that needed to be only one season long. The whole thing fits like a marathon movie, it is higly immersive and the characters are very real and relateable.

The audio has been ruined and at first I thought I'd been sold a counterfiet version but upon seeing the top review here it now appears the bad audio is down to the fact that they have replaced the 5.1 channel high fidelity soundtrack with two-channel stereo. Every time a scene involves excessive background/ambience noise the main voices from the actors are muffled & hard to hear.

I've played it through a DVD player and my PS3 on my Sony Bravia HD TV and no matter how much I try and change my audio settings it still sounds awful when there's a lot going on on-screen.

One other point to note, there are no subtitles which I find very strange.

I will admit that it might take some more than a single viewing to catch all of the subtle details (I sure did), but even on one viewing, there is so much going for this series. First, the basic premise is tried and true, but at the same time handled in a unique way: while the day repeats over and over, *some* things carry over, and this makes for some subtle twists and turns. Second, the acting is first rate, really terrific. Every single main character is acted with elan and believability, as well as charisma.

Biggest plus in my book is that the series is complete. You are not left with a ridiculous cliffhanger and you finish watching with a satisfied sigh at time well spent, rather than frustrating questions that will never be answered. I also enjoyed the racially diverse cast, which served to make this a story that appealed to people, not a particular race or ethnicity.

A little slow and aggravating at times.
The white woman divorced from a white cop

generic. Is it just me or is it
less then enjoyable television to
watch 2 races slobbing all over each other?
It seems acceptable if Italians want to
keep marriage between Italians.
Irish between Irish...etc etc.
Yet when it comes to black and white
all of a sudden if you do not
embrace it and rejoice exceedingly
about it when it desired to have
Caucasian with Caucasian or Black
with Black...then your a racist bigot?
I think it is natural not to be
overly embracing of it. I think
this is natural and does not make
one a racist. I have many black
friends..good friends. I have never
seen a Blue Jay hooked up with

3076638,5,B00125JPMQ,"Day Break (2006) is an extremely complicated crime drama that was cancelled after only six of the thirteen episodes in the series had aired.  The whacky central premise is that Brett Hopper (Taye Diggs), a police detective accused of murder, is continually reliving the same day.  Using information that he learns from his past experiences, Hopper attempts to solve the murder, and discover the secret to what seems to be an ever expanding mystery.

The entire series, including the seven unaired episodes are in this set.  Due to its non-linear constantly evolving plotline, and focus on the time element, Day Break lends itself extremely well to DVD, where the episodes can be viewed one after another, and the characters and plot elements are perhaps easier to remember and keep track of.

The story begins on what is called ""Day 2"" with Brett Hopper waking up at 6:18am in the apartment of his girlfriend Rita Shelten (Moon Bloodgood).  Hopper soon discovers that he is wanted for the murder of district attorney Alberto Garza, a man he has never met.  While trying to avoid capture by the police, Hopper turns to various people for help, including his current partner Andrea Battle (Victoria Pratt), his sister Jennifer Mathis (Meta Golding), Damien Ortiz (Ramon Rodriguez) a criminal informant, and Chad Shelten (Adam Baldwin) his ex-partner, and Rita's ex-husband.

A detailed plot synopsis would be a challenge and take too long, as numerous events, even the death of various characters, are frequently negated when Hopper's day ""resets"" to ""Day 2"".  One long continuous nonlinear adventure, Day Break has to be seen in chronological order, to be truly understood and appreciated for the amazing experience that it is.  The writing is absolutely first class, continually keeping you off balance, until finally the numerous overlapping events and conspiracies, evolve and meld into one coherent event.  Several times, the story seems to be resolved, only to restart again.  At one point Brett and Rita are relaxing on a beach in Mexico, but even while there Hopper's day is repeating, compelling him to resume the search for the truth.

From beginning to end, Taye Diggs is simply outstanding in what is an extremely challenging role.  Much like 24's Jack Bauer, Hopper is put into all kinds of unlikely situations, but he has the advantage of remembering what has happened in the past, which helps him to prevent disaster and death, and also helps him to make progress faster.  Has the story proceeds, Hopper learns to expect the day to reset, and he becomes more methodical, and less emotional about the events that happen.

Moon Bloodgood is also excellent, as her character Rita goes through almost as many permutations as Hopper.  The terrific supporting cast includes Jonathan Banks, Mitch Pileggi, Ian Anthony Dale, Jim Beaver, Joe Nieves, Michael McGrady, Marlene Forte, Don Franklin, and Bahar Soomekh.  As the story continues, many of the supporting or peripheral characters are thrust into the spotlight, or become a key piece in what seems to be an ever changing puzzle.  None of the acting performances disappoint.

ABC deserves some credit for greenlighting Day Break, however with its overly complicated plot, it was perhaps too much to expect that the series could sustain an audience though 13 episodes.  People may not have been able to figure out what the series was really about, and they were perhaps looking for something with a more obvious direction.  The ratings for Day Break steadily declined until cancellation, but fortunately it is still possible to see the entire series.

It you enjoy a convoluted crime drama that requires that you pay close attention, and features great writing and acting, give Day Break a chance.  The series is available in a four disc version, and a lower cost two disc version.  Either one is fine, and the total runtime is about ten hours.  The episodes are subtitled, and each has some kind of commentary track that provides tons of information about the backstory of the series.",1328918400,13,4044,5.034534534534535

I don't believe that the network broadcast all of the episodes, though there is a conclusion.

This is the type of show that almost begs to be watched contiguously, which I did in the form of a snowy holiday.

3076641,5,B00125JPMQ,"On a shopping binge i picked up the first season of a lot of shows - Mad Men, White Collar, Dexter, Six Feet Under, Veronica Mars, Numb3rs and a few other whose names i'd heard and were highly hyped. i found this cheap and it sounded like a detective Groundhog Day so figured i wasn't risking a lot of money. Boy was i surprised - this was BY FAR the best TV series i picked up. Had a friend over and we watched episode after episode wanting it to not end (although my friend liked that it ended before it got old).

Here's the basic idea - a cop is framed for murder, his day goes poorly, he wakes up the next morning and it all starts over again. His hope is that if he finds out who framed him (or more appropriately, who heads the shadowy organization that framed him), the day will end and life will go on. A detective Groundhog Day. Within a few episodes you learn one thing is different - any damage (or gunshot wounds) he receives are still there the next day. Not the bandages that kept him alive, just the wounds. So, unlike Bill Murray, he can't just do anything, he has to try to stay alive.

A few more episodes go by and you learn that the day CAN change. There are several people who are important to him, each with a problem, a problem that ultimately causes him problems. If he solve that person's problem, the next day that person ""feels"" different and does something to make his day easier. For example, his partner has an issue that causes a death every night. Once he solves her problem, from every day forward, she solves her own problem and he has one less death to worry about. Solving other people's problems helps solve his problems, little by little.

A few more episodes go by and you learn that he isn't the only person who can tell when the day repeats. This part could have been developed better and perhaps would have been had the show not been cut short.

So it's not exactly Groundhog Day. It's also not a comedy and he's not stuck in place - every day he researches a clue and tries to remember it so that the next day he can learn a little more, eventually working his way to the bad guy. You watch him make progress little by little, and it's interesting to see.

i buy a lot of cheap stuff and i'm almost always disappointed but this month has been good - i picked up Fast Forward (another canceled show) that is fantastic and this one, which is better than fantastic. Since i also liked FireFly (another show canceled in its first season), maybe i just like shows everyone else hates. But to me, this show was worth all the previous bad investments i've made in bargain shows.",1323648000,7,2615,4.296146044624747

3076643,2,B00125JPMQ,"I hate starting a series...then suddenly -- even for the most ""valid"" of reasons -- deciding it no longer merits any further attention. Such was the case with DAY BREAK.

I sat through the first implausible, just barely interesting enough episode, wishing only that it would conclude (the sooner the better), so that I could go on to the next episode, and hopefully discover the sort of obsessive appeal that draws one inexorably into the world of cinematic addiction.  (Don't you just love it when you discover a series that grabs you by the throat (so to speak) and literally compels your undivided time and attention, so that everything else in life falls by the wayside?)

Unfortunately, DAY BREAK'S run-of-the-mill acting, direction and copycat storytelling -- NOT TO MENTION THE REGRETTABLE LACK OF ENGLISH SUBTITLES, MAKING IT REPEATEDLY NECESSARY TO TURN UP THE VOLUME AND STRAIN MY EARS TO MAKE SENSE OF SOME OF THE DROWNED-OUT MUMBLING -- led this ""series-junkie"" to conclude (possibly erroneously) that it was time to dump this middling production and move blithely on to the next one.",1316476800,4,1096,5.010989010989011

I want to see what else he has done.

The story demands concentration and a good memory, as the frenetic pace and sometimes breathtaking plot twists take a toll on the audience as much as the characters - but don't be put off - this is an excellent series and solid entertainment.

My family watched this over three days, which may have been a mistake. We actually came to dread the last three episodes, we wanted more! Highly recommended.

3076651,5,B00125JPMQ,"This series was one fine example of great science fiction and drama.  It had an intriguing premise, executed with sharp direction, clear writing, and an excellent cast.  There were never any segues, and the confident pace established trust, never stirring suspicions that the writers might be making it up as they went along.  Like LOST, it got more complex as it went along (though not nearly as labyrinthine).  It was one of those series that, if you didn't get in on it at the beginning (which I didn't), it would be difficult to catch up.  This is probably why, despite all that was good about the series, it never gained an audience and the network canceled it before the conclusion.  But kudos to the network for taking the chance, and more importantly, having enough respect for the viewers to complete a final episode, even if it wasn't aired.  And it's here, in this DVD set.  There are so many examples of creators of shows like these, simply driving away after the ratings fail, leaving us in the middle of the desert.  For not abandoning us, the network should be commended.

If you enjoy fresh original television, I highly recommend you pick this up, and then spread the word.  The series deserves a bigger fanbase, and is just too wonderful to let whither unseen in dusty back annals of TV history.  I bet you could bring it up to your friends and they'd have no idea what you were talking about.

Whatever.  The good thing is, now you can see the entire series, right up to its satisfying conclusion.  The picture quality is rich and clear, with a lot of detail, even though it's in SD.  And there are lots of extra features to boot, such as featurettes and commentaries by different cast members, writers, and producers.  And let's not overlook the presence of Moon Bloodgood as Rita Shelton, love interest to Detective Hopper (Taye Diggs).  Moon is a woman I'd like to see grace more often our screens at home and in theaters, as her beauty has a serene warmth to it.  It's always nice to see her.

3076653,4,B00125JPMQ,"I was very happy with the price that I paid for this DVD set. I give my thanks to the other reviewers who pointed out that the packaging is cheap, the shows have a lot of compression artifacts, the ""extras"" are minimal and there are no subtitles for the hard of hearing. That's acceptable given the price. It's a really good show.

Day Break (two words, not one like in the product description) was a short lived series on ABC during the 2006 season. ABC pulled it after airing just six episodes but allowed the company to resolve the show and put the remaining show out on the web. It is a really good series and i am baffled about why they cancelled it after just six episodes. Maybe the show was too complex to retain viewers. I can understand that since I had to review prior scenes a few times to understand the plot. Subtitles would have helped with the understanding. Also, the picture was very dark and murky at times. At first I thought that it was from the low-budget compression but it turns out that it was just the way the show was produced.

The basic story is simple - Detective Brett Hopper is accused of murdering a district attorney. He says that he's framed and tries to prove his innocence. The twist is that he relives the same day over and over again. Unlike the movie Groundhog Day, his injuries carry through from day to day and he continues to age. nice touches are things like his beard growing and him getting hungry from not eating the ""day before.""

What I liked about this series was the character development. Not only does Brett have to save himself, he has to save the people that he loves. He resolves issues with his family, his girlfriend and his partner. Even characters that in other shows would just be stereotypes to support the plot are given a chance to evolve. For example, his sister Jen's husband is initially presented as an abusive man who happily turns brett over to the bad guys. Over the season we find out that he's actually a scared man trying to protect his family. In one conversation with Jen we see the whole issue turned inside out.

What i didn't like about it was the way that Brett's sense of morality degrades throughout the series. at one point Chad (his girlfriend's ex-husband) asks Brett why he just doesn't walk into the station with a sub-machine gun and get what he wants by force. Brett replies, ""I don't know, maybe because it would be wrong."" On other occasions he tells himself that he is still a cop. But by the last episode, he's allowing people to be murdered. Don't get me wrong - this decline is very believable. He is fighting desperately to save those he cares about. I just would have preferred a less cynical ending.",1275177600,5,2697,4.475609756097561

It comes in a thick plastic case which might be used for four discs, but there are only two discs. How do they fit 13 episodes on only two single-sided discs? First, they replace the 5.1 channel high fidelity soundtrack with two-channel stereo. Then they compress the video a lot more, and it shows, more or less. It actually looks better than I thought it would, but compression artifacts are obvious in the details, such as the weave of his shirt, or the color banding in the sky of a rising sun. All the commentaries seem to be here, however, sometimes two per episode, and there are three video features as well, probably from the original DVD release.

For reasons unknown, the discs are in two loose paper sleeves. It may be that the distributor intends to save money by using the same thick plastic box for all their releases requiring more or less discs (and sleeves).

The ideal Daybreak on DVD would be on Blu-ray, so that I could see a version that looks at least as good as the original broadcast. Second best would be the previous four-disc release.

Occassionally you have to go back to a previous episode to understand why something was happening. And you constantly have to remind yourself that you the viewer and Detective Hopper are the only ones who know what is going on, because for everyone else in the movie it is still ""the first day"". Excellent!",1233360000,,868,4.266666666666667

Thinking where can they go with this, yet every show was inventive and exciting.
And when it when off the air I was upset, but thrilled to at least be able to view the show to its conclusion on-line...and what an exciting fulfilling conclusion!!!
I found it at Best Buy for only $19.99 (normal price) and it is packed with features!!!
There are ""15 audio commentaries on all 13 episodes"", interviews with the cast and crew, behind the scenes footage and photo galleries.  So you can sit down and rewatch this glorious series with an assortment of different commentary ""teams"" made up of different mixes of 8 of the stars and 7 members of the production staff.  Some episode feature more than one commentary option.  Not just 1 or 2 episodes, EVERY episode, how's that for features.
A complex exciting thrilling version of Groundhog Day on steroids.
The DVD is listed at 546 minutes
No subtitles that I could find
We are so lucky the 1st ""season"" was completed before it was cancelled so we actually got a show that included a conclusion...it's so frustrating to watch network show after network show get cancelled with no ending ever filmed (Surface, Invasion, Threshold, New Amsterdam, Journeyman<with only a wink-wink ending>, Jericho<almost>, and on and on...).  The networks are so thoughtless in this regard...to hell with the viewers!!!
They should be REQUIRED to finance and air a movie of the the week conclusion to every episodic show they suddenly cancel.",1220400000,2,1512,4.89453125

This show is not for the casual viewer. This intense action saturated series is just what the intellectual viewer is looking for. The series isn't easy to follow if your not 100% involved, so please don't believe the half hearted reviewers, who haven't made it through the first disc. The show was canceled on ABC due to lack of viewers; I believe the average American cant stand to ""Think"" while watching something. They require some dancing or a fool with a microphone trying to be your hero, to maintain interest. Since I'm not a prepubescent 12 year old; I require sustenance in my entertainment.",1219968000,,625,4.743119266055046

But now at least, we have dvd, and I am thankfull LOL. My sister bought this for me, and I had no idea it was even out. But here you get to see all the episodes, and watch the whole thing from start to finish, and find out if poor Detective Hopper can make it to the next day.

Props have to be given to the writers to keep track of all this, and a director and actors who delivered this series in a credible way. I highly recommend this DVD. The only disappointment (for me) is that the extras are rather light, not as extensive as I like, but on the whole, a purchase worthy of your money.",1215820800,,663,3.9774436090225564
3076675,5,B00125JPMQ,"I think this show is a must buy at 19.99. This show is special, in a way that I really haven't ever seen before. The show's premise is like Groundhog Day, but I think it works even better in this case. If you like watching detective shows, where the plot sort of unfolds in one hour, then you will LOVE this show because it unfolds over the season, brilliantly. Brett Hopper is repeating the same day over and over again, and he learns so much from every character, what they were going through that day, and it's almost scary to think about his relationships and how shaky they really were. But you come to see that he is a fast learner, and really the day repeating is the only way to allow him to find the truth. I think the element of repeating the day, learning from mistakes, decisions and their consequences make this show a great teaching tool, you will learn a lot from this show. If you think about it, each day is a mystery in itself, and you will love this show from the pilot until the end. YOU WON'T be disappointed with this purchase, do it soon.",1214956800,,1061,4.2835820895522385

And was I PO'ed when they yanked it half way through the run.  What was ABC thinking?  Were they afraid we wouldn't get it?  I couldn't catch the last episodes online, so I waited patiently for the DVD set and I wasn't disappointed.  The acting, action, camera work, music, editing...it was all well above average for a TV series.  Actually the cancellation may have been a blessing for the true fan since with the DVD set we can hear commentaries on every episode...and I've watched some episodes several times.  Want a great way to spend 13 hours+, without the commercials?  Buy this and you won't be disappointed.  Maybe some other network will pick it up for the short run and others will join the bandwagon.",1214092800,2,887,4.701298701298701
3076677,4,B00125JPMQ,"She is hotter here than she is in Journeyman, another fine time-bending show cancelled earlier than it should've been. But let's get serious.
I have to echo the positive reviews for this show. The show challenges you and dazzles you. You'd think the writers would run out of ways to re-hash the same day and it would get tiresome, but just when it starts to look like it will, it comes up with an ace. I caught the last few episodes on the ABC.com. I gobbled them 3 at a time. It's that yummy. If you like 24 or Prison Break, this has the same amount of suspense and action, plus it has a bit more ""whodunnit"".
Sci-Fi Chnnel should buy it and re-air it. Ten times better than the b-movies they've been churning out. At 19.99, it is a pretty good deal.",1212969600,,751,4.258741258741258

An outstanding production, excellent acting, great action scenes, an intelligent plot with loads of twists ... and if you loved Adam Baldwin in the other great (and cancelled) TV show ""Firefly"", you will appreciate him in this show. Most of the time when I see a bunch of 5 star ratings for a cancelled TV show I figure it is just a bunch of unhappy fans and NOT a true indication of a TV show's quality. Not so with Day Break. This TV show was a work of art. What a loss that this was cancelled while re-worked old game shows get put on the air during prime time. TV executives really are less intelligent than the general public. Want real entertainment? Buy Day Break  ... support quality productions.",1212883200,,727,4.425373134328358

This is, by far, one of the best tv shows I have ever seen.  So, why am I'm angry... because it was canceled!  I knew it was canceled before I started watching it, but I didn't expect the show to be that good.  I assumed it was canceled because it wasn't good enough to compete with other shows.  So many of the shows I watch has been canceled recently.  Shows like Moonlight, Deadzone, 4400, and Journeyman.  Though I love these shows, deep in my heart I knew that they weren't up to the standards set by other shows in their genre (Heroes and Lost).  My mistake, Journeyman was up to the standard and was also an excellent show, but I can imagine it was hard to get into if you missed the first few episodes.  Day Break may have had the same problem, but I feel like the network could have done a better job in helping the show find it's audience.  Replay the first episode, try different timeslots, whatever.  Anyway, I'm starting feel better... I think I needed to vent.  I give it 5 stars for this dvd set.  Though I would have enjoyed watching interviews on the cancellation of the show find out where they had plan on taking it next.  The show is excellent.  Great acting and great storyline.  I have to applaud the writers, because they made each and every episode different even though the same day was repeating.  One positive thing about the ending of the show was that everything was wrapped up at the end.  I wanted more because I enjoyed the ride, but at least the storyline of that season was completly wrapped up.  I didn't feel like it was canceled and they just completely stopped production on the show.  Bottom line... buy this dvd.

Taye Diggs is great along with the gorgeous Moon Bloodgood and big Adam Baldwin.  The storyline is excellent and is a great mystery all the way through the show.  Just like shows like Arrested Development, the plot gets very complicated, and it is hard to just jump into the show, if you happened to miss the first few episodes.  Thus, it did not last long.  Those of us lucky enough to follow the show all the way through, love it.  In fact, all my friends to whom I have showed Daybreak, are big fans now.

But Detective Brett Hopper has an advantage - he's reliving the same day over and over again.  Every day may be a nightmare, but every day gives him more clues and more facts to understand what forces have conspired against him.  Another chance to find out who sent him evidence of a past murder case.  Another chance to discover why his fingerprints are on the murder weapon.  Another chance to find out why the wife of the dead man has identified him as the shooter. And if he makes enough of a difference, he may change the day for the better - or worse.

The idea isn't new, but the time loop concept placed into the setting of conspiracy and mystery gives it a new twist.  The show was a lot of fun, and if you consider it a miniseries, you'll enjoy how it plays out.",1207267200,,970,4.368715083798882

I heard that it was supposed to be a 13-episode series with a definite conclusion. Since I tire of shows that get axed early (or end without logical conclusion); 'jump the shark' or otherwise outlive their usefulness, I eagerly watched the first 6 or 7 episodes.
Silly, gullible me. The local channel the carried it soon abandoned it when it was clear it was a ratings failure. Non-USA residents didn't have access to ABC's on-line content, so I was still stuck wondering what happened.
At last, with this DVD release, I think I shall be satisfied. It was the most interesting and creative 'cop' series to come along since Boomtown and High Incident.",1203465600,3,834,4.566666666666666
3076696,4,B00125JPMQ,"I liked this show, however, after 3 episodes I got a little tiresome. I thought it all stayed the same. Luckily the story evolved rapidly after that and you go on a ride with the chararcters and stay on that ride right until the last episode.

However, if you have more than two brain cells to rub together, this is worth seeing. It's a half-season that was completely filmed before ever being shown, and it's nicely cohesive and engaging. The effect is that of a very long movie a la ""Groundhog Day"" but with a gritty action/adventure twist.

It's a shame that shows like this no longer find an audience big enough to satisfy the producers' avarice, but over a half-century of leftist dumb-down has rendered the bulk of the populace incapable of comprehending anything as intricate and involving as this.

In summary: if you think most TV sucks, and miss the days of solid storytelling and inspired casting, you will probably like this very much. If you think ""The Apprentice"" constitutes ""quality entertainment,"" then you probably won't be able to follow this show.

One of the many unique aspects of this fascinating show is the brilliance in its casting.  The cast consists of a broad spectrum of ethnicity that delightfully, does NOT have anything to do with the storyline.  Just fine actors playing their parts to perfection.

3311107,5,B00125JPMQ,"Day Break is a polished Touchstone TV series with a compellingly strange premise: Groundhog Day recast as a police procedural. It even includes the classic movies close-up of a flip-display clock showing the same time over and over. Yet unlike the films weatherman Phil Connors, whose nose is rubbed in his moral failings, Detective Brett Hopper has to uncover failures of his detective work regarding a murder for which he is being framed. The plot is an intriguing maze in which on every repeated day Hopper makes a new mistake, and every day someone suffers for it. Hopper is driven by having to protect himself and others, including his threatened girlfriend, and his frequent errors make him credible and someone to root for. None of the episodes are particularly violent. Only six of the thirteen episodes were broadcast originally, and the ratings declined, probably because it must have been hard to follow the plot when you had to wait a week for the next chapter. On DVD, of course, this problem dissolves. We binge-viewed all thirteen chapters in three or four sessions, and it was usually hard to stop watching. The DVD includes a jocular yet revelatory commentary by director Rob Bowman of The X-Files and Castle, and writer Paul Zbyzewsky, who worked on Lost.",1388880000,2,1273,4.925581395348837

3311110,5,B00125JPMQ,"I didn't expect DAY BREAK to be as good as it is. It is not for viewers with IQ's under room temperature. It's tricky as it is risky, sophisticated, avant garde and needs a bit of
time and exposure to get into your head. Once there you'll appreciate the complex script,
characters and unorthodox concept.

No, it's not a knock off of GROUNDHOGS DAY; DAY BREAK a whole other animal, very sophisticated and put together to draw you in.  You will get hooked; buy not right away. Its complexity will challenge you. Unlike many TV plots today, thinking is required. And shrewd observation and the realization that what's obvious isn't all there is.

It will take some (very enjoyable) deductions  to get into the right mindset. Once there you'll really be challenged and certainly edge-of-your-sofa entertained. Your perception should be, as a bad guy character says, that decisions lead to consequences. Maybe it was Aristotle who first thought up the line, like 'for ever cause there are many effects; for every effect, many causes. There are many clever causes and effects here. All real, all believable and mostly exciting.

It  took me two viewings to get what was going down. Three to really appreciate the fine
writing and so-unique concept and direction. A virtue with DAY BREAK is that you'll be able to
see it many times and each time see, enjoy more. I'm now looking forward very much to re-view
and expect to view again.

Production, from acting to editing, posh green LA venues to hot women and either cool or cruel
men is first-class. I lived and working in media writing and never saw better locations. In all, DB is the best mini-series I've seen in a long while. It should've, could've been a major theatrical release. It would have been a sensation with its new actors and attitudes and action. The deep, complex plot's
a wonder.

And wonder of wonders, the more the onion's peeled the better it gets. The final denouement is
believable and hard to believe at the same time. Give it time, you'll see what's what. I watched as I, under my breath kept saying ""aha and oh yeah and (expletive deleted)now I get it. DB's an education In the Making Of segments you'll see some dedicated young filmmakers talking about the risks they took and why the risks were worth it, whether they were accepted or not by some viewers. I agreed. For me everything in DB was worth it; surprising and memorable. I'll wait a month or months and see it all again.

Surprisingly, seeing it more than once, the surprise quotient stays high. Mostly when surprises are revealed it's a rush. Will you guess the surprises? Many will, many will hit replay to go back to the scene and see what led to the consequences.

Taye Diggs is perfectly cast as a hard cop with compassion, one who makes mistakes and accepts the humanity (failings included) of other characters, good or bad people - and those lines are blurred throughout the595 MINUTES. Every character is real and human as can be. They're mostly familiar faces and a great very balanced, true to live ensemble.

Okay, enough raving. This fine show lasted one season? The rumors that bean counters lack taste and and feel viewers are are mostly oblivious. DAY BREAK is a bargain now; get to Amazon Marketplace and get it for a lot less than it's worth; it's far more than worth its price.",1375660800,2,3327,4.679794520547945
3311111,5,B00125JPMQ,"I was oblivious to the existence of this series until I spotted it on a popular online streaming service last month.

I must say that I found the series thoroughly enjoyable. Time is a mysterious little bugger, in an old chestnut sort of way. The story has a knack for highlighting the value of ignorance; trying to know the unknown is exciting. Once the previously unknown is known, however, that excitement fades rather quickly. And no matter how much one knows, mistakes are still part and parcel of the human experience, or just the way things go, and, you know, what are you going to do about it?

The show has action, mystery, suspense, relationship drama, and also some careful (and somewhat slow moving) philosophical moments. So why did this series fail so colossally on its first run?

I'd imagine that this show would have been difficult to keep up with in once-a-week doses. This show does require careful attention or else you can easily lose your way. It is not the type of show to ""watch"" in the background while you're texting everybody and updating your social media status and playing video games and so on. I watched it over a three day period, and if I had spread it out any more, I probably would have had to backtrack over some of it again in order to get up to speed. It is a very dense show.

The production values are good, it is photographed well with plenty of exterior scenes. You'd really be cheating yourself if you don't watch it in HD (at least 720p). In fact, I'd save it for another time if an HD source isn't available.",1375315200,,1554,4.5

The audio has been ruined and at first I thought I'd been sold a counterfiet version but upon seeing the top review here it now appears the bad audio is down to the fact that they have replaced the 5.1 channel high fidelity soundtrack with two-channel stereo. Every time a scene involves excessive background/ambience noise the main voices from the actors are muffled & hard to hear.

I've played it through a DVD player and my PS3 on my Sony Bravia HD TV and no matter how much I try and change my audio settings it still sounds awful when there's a lot going on on-screen.

One other point to note, there are no subtitles which I find very strange.

3311135,5,B00125JPMQ,"Day Break (2006) is an extremely complicated crime drama that was cancelled after only six of the thirteen episodes in the series had aired.  The whacky central premise is that Brett Hopper (Taye Diggs), a police detective accused of murder, is continually reliving the same day.  Using information that he learns from his past experiences, Hopper attempts to solve the murder, and discover the secret to what seems to be an ever expanding mystery.

The entire series, including the seven unaired episodes are in this set.  Due to its non-linear constantly evolving plotline, and focus on the time element, Day Break lends itself extremely well to DVD, where the episodes can be viewed one after another, and the characters and plot elements are perhaps easier to remember and keep track of.

The story begins on what is called ""Day 2"" with Brett Hopper waking up at 6:18am in the apartment of his girlfriend Rita Shelten (Moon Bloodgood).  Hopper soon discovers that he is wanted for the murder of district attorney Alberto Garza, a man he has never met.  While trying to avoid capture by the police, Hopper turns to various people for help, including his current partner Andrea Battle (Victoria Pratt), his sister Jennifer Mathis (Meta Golding), Damien Ortiz (Ramon Rodriguez) a criminal informant, and Chad Shelten (Adam Baldwin) his ex-partner, and Rita's ex-husband.

A detailed plot synopsis would be a challenge and take too long, as numerous events, even the death of various characters, are frequently negated when Hopper's day ""resets"" to ""Day 2"".  One long continuous nonlinear adventure, Day Break has to be seen in chronological order, to be truly understood and appreciated for the amazing experience that it is.  The writing is absolutely first class, continually keeping you off balance, until finally the numerous overlapping events and conspiracies, evolve and meld into one coherent event.  Several times, the story seems to be resolved, only to restart again.  At one point Brett and Rita are relaxing on a beach in Mexico, but even while there Hopper's day is repeating, compelling him to resume the search for the truth.

From beginning to end, Taye Diggs is simply outstanding in what is an extremely challenging role.  Much like 24's Jack Bauer, Hopper is put into all kinds of unlikely situations, but he has the advantage of remembering what has happened in the past, which helps him to prevent disaster and death, and also helps him to make progress faster.  Has the story proceeds, Hopper learns to expect the day to reset, and he becomes more methodical, and less emotional about the events that happen.

Moon Bloodgood is also excellent, as her character Rita goes through almost as many permutations as Hopper.  The terrific supporting cast includes Jonathan Banks, Mitch Pileggi, Ian Anthony Dale, Jim Beaver, Joe Nieves, Michael McGrady, Marlene Forte, Don Franklin, and Bahar Soomekh.  As the story continues, many of the supporting or peripheral characters are thrust into the spotlight, or become a key piece in what seems to be an ever changing puzzle.  None of the acting performances disappoint.

ABC deserves some credit for greenlighting Day Break, however with its overly complicated plot, it was perhaps too much to expect that the series could sustain an audience though 13 episodes.  People may not have been able to figure out what the series was really about, and they were perhaps looking for something with a more obvious direction.  The ratings for Day Break steadily declined until cancellation, but fortunately it is still possible to see the entire series.

It you enjoy a convoluted crime drama that requires that you pay close attention, and features great writing and acting, give Day Break a chance.  The series is available in a four disc version, and a lower cost two disc version.  Either one is fine, and the total runtime is about ten hours.  The episodes are subtitled, and each has some kind of commentary track that provides tons of information about the backstory of the series.",1328918400,13,4044,5.034534534534535

3311138,5,B00125JPMQ,"On a shopping binge i picked up the first season of a lot of shows - Mad Men, White Collar, Dexter, Six Feet Under, Veronica Mars, Numb3rs and a few other whose names i'd heard and were highly hyped. i found this cheap and it sounded like a detective Groundhog Day so figured i wasn't risking a lot of money. Boy was i surprised - this was BY FAR the best TV series i picked up. Had a friend over and we watched episode after episode wanting it to not end (although my friend liked that it ended before it got old).

Here's the basic idea - a cop is framed for murder, his day goes poorly, he wakes up the next morning and it all starts over again. His hope is that if he finds out who framed him (or more appropriately, who heads the shadowy organization that framed him), the day will end and life will go on. A detective Groundhog Day. Within a few episodes you learn one thing is different - any damage (or gunshot wounds) he receives are still there the next day. Not the bandages that kept him alive, just the wounds. So, unlike Bill Murray, he can't just do anything, he has to try to stay alive.

A few more episodes go by and you learn that the day CAN change. There are several people who are important to him, each with a problem, a problem that ultimately causes him problems. If he solve that person's problem, the next day that person ""feels"" different and does something to make his day easier. For example, his partner has an issue that causes a death every night. Once he solves her problem, from every day forward, she solves her own problem and he has one less death to worry about. Solving other people's problems helps solve his problems, little by little.

A few more episodes go by and you learn that he isn't the only person who can tell when the day repeats. This part could have been developed better and perhaps would have been had the show not been cut short.

So it's not exactly Groundhog Day. It's also not a comedy and he's not stuck in place - every day he researches a clue and tries to remember it so that the next day he can learn a little more, eventually working his way to the bad guy. You watch him make progress little by little, and it's interesting to see.

i buy a lot of cheap stuff and i'm almost always disappointed but this month has been good - i picked up Fast Forward (another canceled show) that is fantastic and this one, which is better than fantastic. Since i also liked FireFly (another show canceled in its first season), maybe i just like shows everyone else hates.

I sat through the first implausible, just barely interesting enough episode, wishing only that it would conclude (the sooner the better), so that I could go on to the next episode, and hopefully discover the sort of obsessive appeal that draws one inexorably into the world of cinematic addiction.  (Don't you just love it when you discover a series that grabs you by the throat (so to speak) and literally compels your undivided time and attention, so that everything else in life falls by the wayside?)

Unfortunately, DAY BREAK'S run-of-the-mill acting, direction and copycat storytelling -- NOT TO MENTION THE REGRETTABLE LACK OF ENGLISH SUBTITLES, MAKING IT REPEATEDLY NECESSARY TO TURN UP THE VOLUME AND STRAIN MY EARS TO MAKE SENSE OF SOME OF THE DROWNED-OUT MUMBLING -- led this ""series-junkie"" to conclude (possibly erroneously) that it was time to dump this middling production and move blithely on to the next one.",1316476800,4,1096,5.010989010989011

I'll just have to watch disc 1 on my computer. That didn't work either the audio & video tracks were not synced together(that means when the actors move their mouths & then you here the word a few seconds later).That's truly how bad it was.

3311144,5,B00125JPMQ,"This series managed to avoid just about every temptation to take shortcuts, be trite or follow the crowd. It is a tour de force of creative energy in the writing, acting and editing. The stand out performance by Taye Diggs is my welcome first introduction to the actor. I want to see what else he has done.

The story demands concentration and a good memory, as the frenetic pace and sometimes breathtaking plot twists take a toll on the audience as much as the characters - but don't be put off - this is an excellent series and solid entertainment.

My family watched this over three days, which may have been a mistake. We actually came to dread the last three episodes, we wanted more! Highly recommended. Catch the first episode on Hulu then, if you like it, save your bandwidth and buy the DVD's. My DVD set of 'Day Break' has pride of place on my shelf.

3311148,5,B00125JPMQ,"This series was one fine example of great science fiction and drama.  It had an intriguing premise, executed with sharp direction, clear writing, and an excellent cast.  There were never any segues, and the confident pace established trust, never stirring suspicions that the writers might be making it up as they went along.  Like LOST, it got more complex as it went along (though not nearly as labyrinthine).  It was one of those series that, if you didn't get in on it at the beginning (which I didn't), it would be difficult to catch up.  This is probably why, despite all that was good about the series, it never gained an audience and the network canceled it before the conclusion.  But kudos to the network for taking the chance, and more importantly, having enough respect for the viewers to complete a final episode, even if it wasn't aired.  And it's here, in this DVD set.  There are so many examples of creators of shows like these, simply driving away after the ratings fail, leaving us in the middle of the desert.  For not abandoning us, the network should be commended.

If you enjoy fresh original television, I highly recommend you pick this up, and then spread the word.  The series deserves a bigger fanbase, and is just too wonderful to let whither unseen in dusty back annals of TV history.  I bet you could bring it up to your friends and they'd have no idea what you were talking about.

Whatever.  The good thing is, now you can see the entire series, right up to its satisfying conclusion.  The picture quality is rich and clear, with a lot of detail, even though it's in SD.  And there are lots of extra features to boot, such as featurettes and commentaries by different cast members, writers, and producers.  And let's not overlook the presence of Moon Bloodgood as Rita Shelton, love interest to Detective Hopper (Taye Diggs).  Moon is a woman I'd like to see grace more often our screens at home and in theaters, as her beauty has a serene warmth to it.  It's always nice to see her.

At $10, this is a STEAL.  13 great episodes with a great story.  Probably in my top 5 of TV series of all time.  Unfortunately, it just didn't catch on with viewers and was cancelled midseason. Perhaps my biggest TV disappointment ever. But the DVD set wrapped up the story (for the most part...a few questions were left unanswered).

If you like shows with mystery, intrigue and some creative twists, you'll love this one.  Go to a movie and spend $10 or buy this set.  The choice is really easy.  I am purchasing many to give as gifts.

(EDIT:  I failed to realize this series was released twice.  This one was from Mill Creek Entertainment...the one I bought for $20 a year ago was from Navarre Corporation.  I didn't experience the same quality problems that other people posted about.)",1282608000,3,1002,4.469613259668508
3311150,4,B00125JPMQ,"I was very happy with the price that I paid for this DVD set. I give my thanks to the other reviewers who pointed out that the packaging is cheap, the shows have a lot of compression artifacts, the ""extras"" are minimal and there are no subtitles for the hard of hearing. That's acceptable given the price. It's a really good show.

Day Break (two words, not one like in the product description) was a short lived series on ABC during the 2006 season. ABC pulled it after airing just six episodes but allowed the company to resolve the show and put the remaining show out on the web. It is a really good series and i am baffled about why they cancelled it after just six episodes. Maybe the show was too complex to retain viewers. I can understand that since I had to review prior scenes a few times to understand the plot. Subtitles would have helped with the understanding. Also, the picture was very dark and murky at times. At first I thought that it was from the low-budget compression but it turns out that it was just the way the show was produced.

The basic story is simple - Detective Brett Hopper is accused of murdering a district attorney. He says that he's framed and tries to prove his innocence. The twist is that he relives the same day over and over again. Unlike the movie Groundhog Day, his injuries carry through from day to day and he continues to age. nice touches are things like his beard growing and him getting hungry from not eating the ""day before.""

What I liked about this series was the character development. Not only does Brett have to save himself, he has to save the people that he loves. He resolves issues with his family, his girlfriend and his partner. Even characters that in other shows would just be stereotypes to support the plot are given a chance to evolve. For example, his sister Jen's husband is initially presented as an abusive man who happily turns brett over to the bad guys. Over the season we find out that he's actually a scared man trying to protect his family. In one conversation with Jen we see the whole issue turned inside out.

What i didn't like about it was the way that Brett's sense of morality degrades throughout the series. at one point Chad (his girlfriend's ex-husband) asks Brett why he just doesn't walk into the station with a sub-machine gun and get what he wants by force. Brett replies, ""I don't know, maybe because it would be wrong."" On other occasions he tells himself that he is still a cop. But by the last episode, he's allowing people to be murdered. Don't get me wrong - this decline is very believable. He is fighting desperately to save those he cares about. I just would have preferred a less cynical ending.",1275177600,5,2697,4.475609756097561

As described in other reviews it comes in a thick DVD case which should be able to accommodate the four or five Disc that you would expect with 13 episodes plus the extras. When you open the case there are 2 Discs in paper sleeves that sit in a pocket of the case. Very odd. After reading the small print on the DVD packages I did find that it states there are 2 Discs while the DVD packaging gives the impression that it would contain more. What a shame since it potentially had a chance to be a very nice set with the commentary extras.
The good news is that this set was found at Target for $5. At that price it might be worth buying since the show was entertaining and did have some closure.",1256256000,16,780,4.172185430463577

This DVD set, however, is the worst DVD set I have ever had the displeasure of trying to watch. The sound is awful. It's very hard to hear what the characters are saying over the background noise and music. The video is very grainy and it looks like someone filmed it with a cheapo home video camera. The lights are too bright, and the darks are muddy and hard to distinguish.

I know this show looks and sounds better then what is represented on this set. Someone decided to re-release this to make a quick dollar and screw over consumers. Do not buy this set. You will be sorry. I am. This show deserves a much better release.",1255996800,28,700,4.2556390977443606
3311158,3,B00125JPMQ,"I really liked this show when I watched the original broadcast in HD, but this is a review of the actual product (which I received today), not the series itself.

It comes in a thick plastic case which might be used for four discs, but there are only two discs. How do they fit 13 episodes on only two single-sided discs? First, they replace the 5.1 channel high fidelity soundtrack with two-channel stereo. Then they compress the video a lot more, and it shows, more or less. It actually looks better than I thought it would, but compression artifacts are obvious in the details, such as the weave of his shirt, or the color banding in the sky of a rising sun. All the commentaries seem to be here, however, sometimes two per episode, and there are three video features as well, probably from the original DVD release.

For reasons unknown, the discs are in two loose paper sleeves. It may be that the distributor intends to save money by using the same thick plastic box for all their releases requiring more or less discs (and sleeves).

The ideal Daybreak on DVD would be on Blu-ray, so that I could see a version that looks at least as good as the original broadcast. Second best would be the previous four-disc release. Last of all is this two-disc set, though it's still worth watching if you haven't seen the show yet.",1254355200,97,1326,4.516666666666667

After watching just the first episode of Day Break, I was instantly hooked. This show is finely written, with a thought-provoking story line and wonderfully created characters. As expected, Bloodgood is fantastic, but  Taye Diggs absolutely dominates in his role as Detective Hopper-- the man is an amazing talent. The rest of the cast holds their own too, especially Adam Baldwin as Diggs' nemesis.

Not surprising that a show this good couldn't survive on network television (much like the aforementioned Journeyman). Had this show been on HBO or Showtime, it would have been a different story.

It takes a little brain work to follow what is going on, and perhaps that was why it didn't catch on - it's not ""mindless"" entertainment.

The show's premise is like Groundhog Day, but I think it works even better in this case. If you like watching detective shows, where the plot sort of unfolds in one hour, then you will LOVE this show because it unfolds over the season, brilliantly. Brett Hopper is repeating the same day over and over again, and he learns so much from every character, what they were going through that day, and it's almost scary to think about his relationships and how shaky they really were. But you come to see that he is a fast learner, and really the day repeating is the only way to allow him to find the truth. I think the element of repeating the day, learning from mistakes, decisions and their consequences make this show a great teaching tool, you will learn a lot from this show. If you think about it, each day is a mystery in itself, and you will love this show from the pilot until the end.

I caught the last few episodes on the ABC.com. I gobbled them 3 at a time. It's that yummy. If you like 24 or Prison Break, this has the same amount of suspense and action, plus it has a bit more ""whodunnit"".

3311179,5,B00125JPMQ,"I am so angry right now.  This has been a terrible morning for me.  Why?  I watched the entire Day Break tv show this week and I just finished the last episode last night.  This is, by far, one of the best tv shows I have ever seen.  So, why am I'm angry... because it was canceled!  I knew it was canceled before I started watching it, but I didn't expect the show to be that good.  I assumed it was canceled because it wasn't good enough to compete with other shows.  So many of the shows I watch has been canceled recently.  Shows like Moonlight, Deadzone, 4400, and Journeyman.  Though I love these shows, deep in my heart I knew that they weren't up to the standards set by other shows in their genre (Heroes and Lost).  My mistake, Journeyman was up to the standard and was also an excellent show, but I can imagine it was hard to get into if you missed the first few episodes.  Day Break may have had the same problem, but I feel like the network could have done a better job in helping the show find it's audience.  Replay the first episode, try different timeslots, whatever.  Anyway, I'm starting feel better... I think I needed to vent.  I give it 5 stars for this dvd set.  Though I would have enjoyed watching interviews on the cancellation of the show find out where they had plan on taking it next.  The show is excellent.  Great acting and great storyline.  I have to applaud the writers, because they made each and every episode different even though the same day was repeating.  One positive thing about the ending of the show was that everything was wrapped up at the end.  I wanted more because I enjoyed the ride, but at least the storyline of that season was completly wrapped up.  I didn't feel like it was canceled and they just completely stopped production on the show.  Bottom line... buy this dvd.  It's great movie like tv show that is worth having and watching again and again.",1210896000,4,1907,4.367521367521367
3311180,5,B00125JPMQ,"Very rarely does a show come along that I truly look forward to every week.  This was the show for me.  I loved everything about it.  I was very upset when it was canceled midseason.  Fortunately, all the episodes were already complete and I was able to catch the remaining episodes online.  Now the DVD set comes along and the price is great.  For the price of taking a date to a movie, you can buy this set and spend hours on the edge of your seat!  I highly recommend this show...",1210032000,,483,4.184782608695652
3311181,5,B00125JPMQ,"Detective Brett Hopper is framed for a murder. He lives the same day over and over and over. The day is the same, but different things happen. Let me tell you, Taye Diggs is very good in the action role he plays. All the little details Hopper remembers that help him deal with situations that arise the next day, which is actually the same day - that's what was the most intriguing. It takes a long time before tomorrow comes, but even then he still has a lot to deal with.
This is a great show that should have never been taken off the air. I was enjoying watching it every week with my son, and then out of the blue it was gone! I'm glad it became available in dvd format. I really have to applaud the writers. They did a fantastic job!",1209513600,,738,4.131944444444445
3311182,5,B00125JPMQ,"It was a long wait to see the remaining (unaired) episodes, but was it ever worth it. Great writing, great characters, first rate story, it's all here. A fast-paced mystery with a touch of the supernatural.",1209513600,,206,4.75
3311183,5,B00125JPMQ,"Day Break is a groundbreaking series... I wish it was never taken off the air... I couldn't wait to see the last seven episodes... Each episode makes you anticipatge every moment... Your always thinking what happens next and you never want the episodes to end...  Taye Diggs is great... He is a superb actor and has a great supporting cast.  Taye Diggs plays Detective Brett Hopper... a detective who gets framed for the Murder of D.A. Alberto Garza and he wakes up to the same day everyday, trying to make it to tomorrow... Watch as he tries to change the day by changing  his actions and trying to save his girlfriend from harm in this thriller... It will keep you in your seats from beginning to end.",1209254400,,703,4.519685039370079
3311184,5,B00125JPMQ,"I love Daybreak.  It is a great show that never really got the chance to flourish, as it came on during the Lost hiatus.  Taye Diggs is great along with the gorgeous Moon Bloodgood and big Adam Baldwin.  The storyline is excellent and is a great mystery all the way through the show.  Just like shows like Arrested Development, the plot gets very complicated, and it is hard to just jump into the show, if you happened to miss the first few episodes.  Thus, it did not last long.  Those of us lucky enough to follow the show all the way through, love it.  In fact, all my friends to whom I have showed Daybreak, are big fans now.  So, if you're looking for a great mystery show, with an interesting twist, Daybreak's the show for you.",1209254400,,734,4.306569343065694
3311185,5,B00125JPMQ,"This show is exciting, thrilling, and captivating. I was hooked the moment I saw it. In previews of this show, I thought it was going to be reminiscent of a Groundhog's Day kinda thing, but it's not. It's complex and entertaining, and leaves you wanting to watch episode after episode to find out what will happen next.",1209081600,,319,4.614035087719298
3311186,3,B00125JPMQ,"I recently purchased this series since they didn't finish it on regular television (I really hate when they do that, don't you?) I have to admit it is hard to confuse me, I enjoy intricate plot lines and twists, but this series has led to some confusion.  I think I will have to go back and watch it again to fully get the entire gist of the story.  I will say though that it is fun and very entertaining.  Make sure you have some time to watch it all the way through, otherwise if you wait too long, you may forget details that are needed for the story.",1209081600,6,554,4.111111111111111
3311187,5,B00125JPMQ,"What a great show with a talented cast. Taye Diggs is hot, talented and very great in his role. I am glad to see it in full on DVD and wish there was more to watch.",1208908800,,164,3.5833333333333335
3311188,5,B00125JPMQ,"This series was taken off the air before the first season was completed.  Well I am glad I bought this, because just as I had imagined, after week 5, it just keeps getting more interesting! The story spins into directions you can not anticipate.  If I could have viewed it all in one sitting, I would have!  But it is well-written and dense material, so it's necessary to take a break to think about all the connections.  I'm going to watch them all again.",1208563200,,456,4.392857142857143
3311189,4,B00125JPMQ,"He's framed for a murder he didn't commit.  His sister and girlfriend are threatened.  His partner has her own problems, and his informant has been compromised.  In short, it's been one lousy day.

But Detective Brett Hopper has an advantage - he's reliving the same day over and over again.  Every day may be a nightmare, but every day gives him more clues and more facts to understand what forces have conspired against him.  Another chance to find out who sent him evidence of a past murder case.  Another chance to discover why his fingerprints are on the murder weapon.  Another chance to find out why the wife of the dead man has identified him as the shooter. And if he makes enough of a difference, he may change the day for the better - or worse.

The idea isn't new, but the time loop concept placed into the setting of conspiracy and mystery gives it a new twist.  The show was a lot of fun, and if you consider it a miniseries, you'll enjoy how it plays out.",1207267200,,970,4.368715083798882

3311191,5,B00125JPMQ,...was ABC thinking when they cancled this show it was pure geneus. I hate it when ABC pulls the plug on a show without finishing out the season. They are known for doing this because they did it to Night Stalker and that was another show that was pulled without being given a chance.,1203552000,,284,4.277777777777778
3311192,5,B00125JPMQ,"All I can say is I am thrilled this is finally on DVD. I was so ready to get into this, because at the very beginning, I stupidly assumed I had the assurance it wouldn't be cancelled. I heard that it was supposed to be a 13-episode series with a definite conclusion. Since I tire of shows that get axed early (or end without logical conclusion); 'jump the shark' or otherwise outlive their usefulness, I eagerly watched the first 6 or 7 episodes.
Silly, gullible me. The local channel the carried it soon abandoned it when it was clear it was a ratings failure. Non-USA residents didn't have access to ABC's on-line content, so I was still stuck wondering what happened.
At last, with this DVD release, I think I shall be satisfied. It was the most interesting and creative 'cop' series to come along since Boomtown and High Incident.",1203465600,3,834,4.566666666666666
3311193,4,B00125JPMQ,"I liked this show, however, after 3 episodes I got a little tiresome. I thought it all stayed the same. Luckily the story evolved rapidly after that and you go on a ride with the chararcters and stay on that ride right until the last episode.

If you like fastpaced shows this is truly must have series",1202601600,,302,4.298245614035087

I just thought he was a pretty boy because he has been cast as such.  He is excellent and Moon Bloodgood as the girlfriend is also excellent.  In a whole generation of Gen X actresses she has found a niche and I'm really happy for her.  Why don't these two have prime-time, steady projects?",1520640000,,455,4.232558139534884

8243927,1,B00125JPMQ,"The worst dvd set I have ever seen. 13 episodes plus a large number of extras and commentaries.....on 2 discs! The sound is awful, the picture quality sub VHS and there are no subs in any language. The discs regularly skip when you try to play them due to being overloaded with poor-quality content. I have in all honesty bought better quality illegal knock-off discs on the side streets of Bali, Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh while on holiday in the 1990s. It seriously boggles my mind that this can be a legitimate release and that the copyright police would not be knocking down the door of the company that produced this boxset. Day Break is an excellent TV show and it is a travesty that no other version currently exists. It is no longer possible to get this in any form outside the USA, but I'm seriously considering sending this straight back from Australia. Even the way the discs are placed in the box is dodgy as hell: despite the creation of dvd boxes with plastic spindles to hold the discs in place some decades ago, the two discs in this set are just wedged into paper sleeves and left to bounce around inside the box.  Shocking that Amazon would want to associate their name with such a shoddy product.",1497657600,,1212,4.484162895927602

8243933,5,B00125JPMQ,"There are plenty of great reviews here to tell you all about this series and how good it was, so that's not what my review is about. I never did write a review on this when I purchased it seven years ago (too busy then, but retired now), but I am compelled to do so now after reading reviews from people who have purchased a more recent release version of the series, which is apparently very poor in quality.

The original DVD release was a boxed set of four discs in three plastic disc cases, and the quality was great. I am including two photos showing the box and contents, so you can see what it actually looks like. This was originally released by BCI Entertainment and Touchstone.

Hopefully, you can find a used set like this, or maybe another release will come along on BluRay, but in any case this is absolutely worth the trouble of finding and watching. I was really upset when they canceled it after only six episodes, and no wrap-up episode. It was a real pleasure to find it later on Amazon with the additional episodes to conclude the story - a real exception to what usually happens with canceled series, and I seem to get caught up in so many of them...",1458000000,3,1170,4.362385321100917
