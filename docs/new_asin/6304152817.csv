792721,5,6304152817,"Anton Chekhov's play 'Uncle Vanya' has been re-written and transplanted to turn of the century South Wales in this production, which is directed by Anthony Hopkins. For all of the many translations and rebirths of this 'comedy' by the great Chekhov, this one seems to work best. There really is very little linear storyline, but it is filled with the author's recurring themes of unfulfilled dreams, boredom, longing for an elusive future.

The plot (!) is really a discourse among the players: Ieuan Davies (Anthony Hopkins) is a bored older man who spends his days drinking and talking with his small family and servants on the country estate owned by Professor Alexander Blathwaite (Leslie Phillips) who comes for a stay with his beautiful wife Helen (Kate Burton) for whom Davies lusts and pines. A doctor (Gawn Grainger) visits, stirs discontent while mixing in family gossip and caring for the victim of a mine explosion. The bulk of the dialogue is centered on some fine expositions about women's rights, class inequality, and Davies' boredom with life, his aborted chances on having a significant life, and his longing for a future that seems as elusive as the summer breeze that fans the tea garden in this wistful, atmospheric setting.

To enjoy 'August' the viewer must be in the mood for conversation, wit, banter, and ensemble acting, and given those prerequisites, this film is a joy. Hopkins gives a magnificent performance, loathable and lovable, and the entire cast is so polished that the play becomes chamber music. Hopkins not only stars but also directs (not always successfully attending to the small details of action), and also provides the musical score - no mean feat! Not a film of action this, but rather a summer reverie piqued by subtle comedy. Grady Harp, February 06",1140134400,12,1798,4.99

792723,5,6304152817,"Sir Anthony gives this gift to the world. Every aspect of this film is perfect.  Not just a couple of actors or a couple of scenes-- but in its entirety, this film is brilliant.  I was completely bowled over.  Hopkin's touch as a director is as a wizard-- it is a story that could have dragged out, been heavy and melodramatic.  Hopkins releases the story from that with his instinctive ability to allow the story to unfold the way the sun first appears on the eastern horizon...lightly, quietly, softly leading up to the crescendo of full morning light.  Yes. This movie is like watching a magnificent dawn.  I watched it three times in a row and cried and laughed each time as if it were the first time through. My god.  Hopkins, you are a gift to this plane of existence....thank you for sharing yourself with all of us!",985219200,17,823,4.483221476510067
792724,5,6304152817,"I thoroughly enjoyed this production. The actors' professionalism made this movie one of enjoying the story's plot rather than watching one or two stars vie for your eye.  The catch of this movie is to pay attention to what one puts their life's work to - be careful what you ask for, it may not be what you wanted but it will be what you asked for - this is riddled throughout the story: Iuean and Helen, Sian and Dr. Lloyd, Dr. Lloyd and Helen, Iuean and Sian to Herr Profesor, Iuean and Professor Blaithewaite, and on.  The movie also renders conversations as that which is often spoken in real family circles: facial antics, people talking over another, people countering another while a third adds a retort or countenance, etc. And this is all done with excellent timing - the content of the comments is not lost in the rush to make or finish a scene.  The scenery itself is awesome - reminescent of Nova Scotia. The muscial notation sets the conflict with an air of lightness - who hasn't encountered some family member(s) that's gotten on your last nerve?  The interaction of the events at the estate and the mining incident is sequenced very well. The movie has a rhythm that these actors are familiar with and it is readily shown in their facial tones, gazes at one another, and the awareness of the quirky comedy. The meeting in the parlar is especially comical in its obvious irritations of family with family.  The final question: he who defines life's parameters is the one who may claim the harvest. Alas, we often don't see where our untimely pursuits will take us nor are we sure of how to continue once we see the results. Great perspective to look into periodically. Great movie to own.",984960000,5,1704,4.592105263157895
792725,5,6304152817,"The action takes place outside and inside the very large house at the center of the Davies' estate, in the 1890s at Caernarvonshire, in North Wales. But despite the play's Welsh setting and characters called Mair and Prosser, August is a faithful reworking of Chekhov's Uncle Vanya. Vanya had become Ieuan and he's played wonderfully by Anthony Hopkins who also is the director of the movie (made in 1994). I have to mention also that he composed the music that is realy beautiful, romantic and melancholic. Very good others actors: Gawn Grainger as Dr Lloyd, Lisa Orgolini as Helen and Leslie Phillips as Prof. Blathwaite. It's one of my favorite film! It's really how life can appear with desillusions, good and funny moments, peace, love and hate.",973209600,2,750,4.913385826771654

792944,3,6304152817,"""August"" IS Anton Chekhov's Russian Classic ""Uncle Vanya"" set in Victorian Wales.  If you like Chekhov's works you will more than likely enjoy this Hallmark production.  I loathe Chekhov and I admit that I have no feeling for his writings or his characters having had to read his works and having seen his plays, AND (perhaps because I work FOR the rich and grow tired of their bitching about ""How bored they are!"")....so I admit I am biased.  That said, at least this production set to film is allowed to breathe beyond the stuffy and dark drawing room of the stage versions, and we are treated to glimpses of the Welsh countryside and some daylight.  The soundtrack, composed by Anthony Hopkins, who also directs and stars as ""Uncle Ioean"" also helps to somewhat lift the self-admitted boredom of the characters.  If you enjoy characters who sit and moan about their lot in life as wealthy people, and love the words ""tedious"" and ""boredom"" over and over again from their lips, by all means have a go at ""August.""",1208995200,6,1015,4.679775280898877
