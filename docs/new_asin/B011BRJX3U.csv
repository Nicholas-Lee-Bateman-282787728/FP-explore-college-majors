8724027,1,B011BRJX3U,DVD was defective - missing the first 49 minutes,1518307200,,48,4.444444444444445
8724028,4,B011BRJX3U,This was a pretty good B&W WWII downed British aircrew film.,1509408000,,60,4.545454545454546
8724029,1,B011BRJX3U,"A good film, but it is NOT a DVD as described, but instead is a cheap, made-on-demand DVD-R, so will likely last just a few years before becoming unplayable.  In fact, I have one player that doesn't play DVD-Rs at all, and never has.  If you've recorded this film off of the air, don't bother with this DVD-R; it's no better.  Really, I don't understand the DVD-R craze, as except in quantities of, say, 200 or less, proper, pressed DVDs are cheaper to produce and will last a lifetime.",1489190400,5,486,4.438202247191011
8724030,4,B011BRJX3U,Excellent period war movie.,1479772800,2,27,6.0
8724031,5,B011BRJX3U,"Most of the action takes place at Air Sea Rescue headquarters, RAF Rescue Launch 2561 and the dinghy being rescued.  Another launch 2559 is also featured.  There are brief shots of a Hudson, a Lancaster, a Sunderland and more of a Sea Otter as it picks up the German pilot that shot down the Hudson.  There aren't any flashbacks, just real time discussion of what is happening, with chitchat on their lives to fill up the time waiting.  It is more about the process and keeping the melodrama low key.",1405123200,6,500,4.522222222222222
