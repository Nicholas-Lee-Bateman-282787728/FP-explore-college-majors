3846589,5,B0024EWOWW,"This is a very informative release about Bonnie and Clyde, Dillinger and Babyface Nelson. It even chronicles some criminals that I've never heard of. It's a very well produced DVD like any other history channel release. As a bonus it also has the a&e biography of Bonnie and Clyde. I was unaware of that when I purchased this so it turned out to be a nice little extra.",1311379200,2,369,4.4411764705882355
3846590,4,B0024EWOWW,"Just to think that my parents lived through this ""Crime Wave"" when they were younger. Not much difference of what is going on today! This really was quite a defining period of our American history. They actually made these killers ""special celebrities"" at the time. Guess it was the mood of the country. They put them up on pedestals. These killers have been romanticzied in movies and when they ""get theirs"" in the end - and they always do - we feel sorry for them. Poor, misundersood little darlings who wouldn't think twice about mowing down your mother or father if they got in the way! A sign of the times. Good video for history buffs and for those who want to reminisce about the 1930's and the great depression - educational. Fast paced, like the old newsreels they would show at the theatres. Well worth the money.",1285286400,6,823,4.5675675675675675
3846591,5,B0024EWOWW,"I purchased this for my girlfriend who read ""Public Enemies"" before seeing the movie.  She really enjoyed the scope of this DVD and said it tied in very nicely to the book.  I also enjoyed watching the DVD even without reading the book.",1268784000,,236,4.465116279069767
3846592,5,B0024EWOWW,"During the Great Depression in the United States, emerges an unforgettable 18-month crime spree that terrifies and fascinates its citizens. The outlaws run wild, outwitting most state cops with their technologically advanced weapons, bulletproof vests, and superior rides!

This documentary provides a riveting and explicit account during the gangster years, thus giving rise to America's first national police force: The FBI. It's a fumbling and humbling beginning. Its special agents learn on the job; lawyers and accounting degree holders with limited or no law enforcement knowledge. However, in the end, they succeed in bringing down America's most notorious criminals.

It's an enthralling, dramatic, and educational docudrama--an excellent production. HIGHLY recommended!",1247356800,8,778,6.0636363636363635

3846618,4,B0024EWOWW,"I chose this product for it's historic accuracy. The material is presented in a 'time-line' fashion to give the viewer an idea of the incidence in relation to each other. I had never seen it presented in this fashion.
It doesn't have as much dramatization as other documentaries I have seen, but stays as true to the facts as possible. As an example:
One scene showed Bonnie and Clyde stopped along a roadway in the country with Henry Methvin. The version stated that it was Henry that shot the police first - Clyde had to jump into it once it started. The media of the day had used this to turn the public against Bonnie and Clyde. They were hero's to people that had lost everything to the banks. They robbed 'mom and pop' stores a number of times",1393632000,,749,4.39568345323741
3846619,5,B0024EWOWW,This documentary follows three different gangs during the 1930's ganger crime spree era.  The information is well presented and the historical reenactments are well done on what I'm sure was a limited budget.,1362182400,,208,5.303030303030303
3846620,4,B0024EWOWW,this dvd shows the real people of the Mob gangsters and the wild ways they break the laws from drugs to murder,1359072000,,110,4.045454545454546
3846621,3,B0024EWOWW,"This documentary, chronicling the Mid-West Bank Robbing spree of the 1930's was released to coincide with the release of the movie ""PUBLIC ENEMIES"" starring Johnny Depp. As such, it seems a bit hasty in it's assembly and is severely lacking in the whole story.

The documentary opens with the June 7th, 1933 ""Kansas City Massacre"" in which an FBI agent, three policemen, and a federal prisoner are killed and more or less ends with the death of John Dillinger outside the Biograph Theater in Chicago on July 22nd, 1934.

The documentary primarily focuses on Dillinger, Bonnie & Clyde, ""Baby Face"" Nelson, and ""Machine Gun"" Kelly. My biggest gripe is that it doesn't even mention ""Pretty Boy"" Floyd or ""Ma"" Barker's sons or Alvin Karpis, who were just as important in that era. Also the re-enactments are a little shoddy and sometimes innacurate in their staging.

It's a nice introduction to that era but crime buffs would be better served by reading Bryan Burroughs book ""Public Enemies"" upon which the Johnny Depp movie is based. It's a more comprehensive and accurate rendering of that time.",1332633600,,1094,4.934782608695652
3846622,5,B0024EWOWW,"If you are into Dillinger, Bonnie and Clyde, Baby Face Nelson etc., this is a must have! Great documentary on not only the outlaws, but of the trials of being an average person living in this most trying of times. Well researched by the History Channel, I can not be more pleased with this product. I feel it is a must have by anyone even mildly interested in this subject.
