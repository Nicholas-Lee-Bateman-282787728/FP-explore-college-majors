8239427,2,B0010YSD4K,It was alright.  The kind of movie you'll watch once.  Wish  I'd rented it and not brought it.,1411603200,,94,4.111111111111111
8239428,3,B0010YSD4K,"I enjoyed this; however, why do these film makers insist on throwing plausibility out the window. First, that the guy didn't think to look on the other guy's phone in this day and age is a bit of a stretch. Then, once he has the movie, he doesn't just upload it to the internet so it would be safely in the public eye. I guess that wouldn't have provided for a car chase though. Oh well.",1386288000,,387,4.105263157894737
8239429,4,B0010YSD4K,I wished Americans learned how to do good movies with young actors the way the British do. Let them speak!,1355011200,2,106,4.35
8239430,3,B0010YSD4K,"The thing about plot-driven movies is that they have to have a tight plot, which this doesn't.

It's fun to watch. It does a very good job of being very matter-of-fact about the lead character's gayness.  The movie isn't about ""being gay"", but it is central to the story, which is nice if you like gay flicks.

The editing is fun and creative, and the characters are fun to watch. Pretty boys, pretty girls, fun accents, good actors, nice lighting. Music was OK, but not particularly wonderful, and sometimes it was intrusive or not quite right.  It seemed pensive sometimes - think piano bar and violin - and this wasn't a pensive movie.

This might be a spoiler alert here:

But the key part of the story is this cell phone, and everybody's looking for it, but the thing is, this movie is about constant surveillance, but no one thinks to triangulate on the cell phone?  And the ending twister makes the whole movie totally stupid.  At the end, what was the point? I totally didn't get it.  And why did they try to ""warn him"" with a near-miss, if all they needed to do was ask him for the cell phone?  It's not like they didn't know he had it, or where he was?!?

There is a real movie to be made about living in a pan-opticon society, but this isn't it.  If you like watching pretty people running and emoting, this is an OK movie.",1319673600,3,1334,4.3562753036437245
8239431,4,B0010YSD4K,"Although I enjoyed the movie it is definitely hard to follow the plot.
So if you are planning on a make out session this is not the movie.
I like it because it tries to merge other genre and it is not just ""another gay movie""
there is suspense!
and it makes you think. what will the future hold?!",1239926400,,296,4.033898305084746
8239432,4,B0010YSD4K,"In response to another reviewer: The Making Of on the DVD makes it clear that the story took years to be developped, and so YouTube didn't exist at that time (it was created in 2005).
This is not a pop-corn movie, but an entertaining What If? story with a believable development, and a lot of twists and turns. I thought the storytelling was rather intelligent, I'll certainly watch this film again to catch what I missed the first time. The actors were all uniformely very good, with the gay aspect of the story mixed into the plot in what felt as a very natural way. We have few thrillers with gay characters as leads, and this one is definitely a keeper.",1239494400,6,657,4.43801652892562
