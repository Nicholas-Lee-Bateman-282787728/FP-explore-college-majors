8086703,5,B000BH4BRU,"Back in the 1950s, Detroit's auto industry was in its heyday. Detroit and the country as a whole was innocent and economically prosperous. The teenagers of the 1950s started cruising Woodward Ave. in Detroit and the northern suburbs, having fun and listening to the popular rock music of the day. Along the way, they'd stop at diners, drive-ins, and drive-in movies. A movie like American Graffiti (1973) accurately depicts what cruising is all about. Cruising Woodward carried over into the 1960s. The '50s and '60s were the heyday for cruising.

Fast forward to August 19, 1995.  The first Woodward Dream Cruise was held on this day.

The Woodward Dream Cruise is an annual classic car cruise that is held the third Saturday in August. Classic car enthusiasts and fans experience the sights and sounds of classic cars of yesteryear as well as the latest hot rods of today and look back on the heyday of cruising with a sense of nostalgia. To me, the Woodward Dream Cruise is more than just cruising up and down Woodward and looking at classic cars. It's an opportunity to let loose, have a lot of fun on a late summer day and night, check out the ""sights"", listen to hard rock, heavy metal, and music from the heyday of cruising. I see it as a sort of pre-grand finale of summer, with Labor Day Weekend being the official grand finale.

This DVD shows the highlights of the 2005 Woodward Dream Cruise, held on Saturday, August 20, 2005.  I've been to every single Woodward Dream Cruise, from 1995 to 2010, and this week will be the 2011 event.  The 2005 event was one of my personal favorites throughout the years, ranking in my top half.  I have my own arsenal of Woodward Dream Cruise camcorder videos throughout the years, but this DVD is good for people who would like a quality DVD that depicts the highlights of this massive August event.  It's good that it's called ""The Unofficial Woodward Dream Cruise DVD"", because it seems like everybody and their dog is filming the cruise, so there are a lot of personal camcorder videos being made as well as more professional ones.

If you're a classic car enthusiast, this is a good DVD to have.",1313366400,2,2146,4.641160949868074
