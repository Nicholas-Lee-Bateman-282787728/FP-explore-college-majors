7489497,5,B0176IENR4,"Big Stone Gap is filled with down home, great feeling small town values and struggles.  The cast is incredible, and the movie is beautifully shot.  It is one of those films that big Hollywood doesn't make anymore.  A film that has you laughing, then shedding tears of joy at the end.  Great family fare.",1453161600,5,303,4.555555555555555

7489499,5,B0176IENR4,"This is a precious movie.  I have not read the book but I thought the production was very well done.
Great shots of the mountain community.  Ashley Judd does a wonderful job in the lead role.  Funny and irreverent.....but  you won't be embarrassed to go with your Mother!",1450742400,18,271,4.583333333333333
7489500,3,B0176IENR4,"There's something special about seeing your hometown on the big screen. Not just as part of a movie, but as the central, driving force. Tonight at the Virginia Film Festival, more than a 1000 anxious locals had a chance to see their town represented in the opening night feature, Big Stone Gap, a heartfelt and earnest homespun comedy about the family ties that bind us all together.

Based on the book penned by director Adriana Trigiani and partially influenced by her own life, the story centers on Big Stone Gap's town ""old maid"", Ave Maria Mulligan, played by Ashley Judd with her usual blend of beauty and spunk. Of Italian descent, Ave makes for an odd fit in the Southern-rooted Big Stone Gap, but she stands as probably the most ""normal"" of a quirky cast of characters. She's the shining, good-natured centerpiece of the coal mining town, delivering meds to her neighbors and directing the town's play, but passion is something she's sorely lacking despite being in a relationship with her longtime best friend, the flamboyant Theodore (John Benjamin Hickey). But there's clearly something brewing between her and the town hunk, Jack MacChesney, played by Patrick Wilson whose Big Stone Gap roots run deep.

While the comedy and various romantic entanglements are pretty conventional, what shines through is that this is a labor of love for all involved. That includes Whoopi Goldberg as the acerbic Fleeta, who runs the town pharmacy along with Ave, and Jenna Elfman as the flighty and superstitious Iva Lou Wade, who believes love can be found through Chinese facial readings. It's an oddball mix of Altman-esque characters, with a deep multigenerational theme that really hits home. Feeling as if life has begun to pass her by and that Big Stone Gap has become more confining than rewarding, Ave reaches out to find a piece of her Italian heritage by locating her estranged father, but it's a development that arrives after long stretches of narrative drift. Not much happens in Big Stone Gap, it's a gradually paced film about a gradually paced place. But there's real chemistry between everybody involved, most especially between Judd and Wilson, and their romantically awkward scenes together are a joy. It's also safe to say Goldberg, who doesn't make many appearances on the big screen anymore, chose the perfect role for her brand of sharp-witted humor.

After tonight's world premiere, a woman next to me captured the essence of Big Stone Gap and why this simple film of modest aspirations works: ""I loved it. It reminded me of home, the people and the places I knew"".",1448323200,37,2587,4.942528735632184

7489523,5,B0176IENR4,"A sweet story about life in an actual small town in southwest VA with some quirky characters.  No cursing, violence, or sex.  I guess the PG rating was because you see the main character, Ave Maria, in her underwear from the back for about 2 seconds and later Ave and her boyfriend lying together in bed talking which leads you to believe it was the morning after.",1485561600,3,364,4.417910447761194

7489525,3,B0176IENR4,"This movie was ""okay"" and funny in parts, but corny otherwise.  I felt that Patrick Wilson was ""miscast"" in his role as a small-town country boy.  His status as a A-1 movie actor is just that.... not in a comedy.  He is more of a dramatic actor.  I loved him in Lakeview Terrace with Samuel Jackson and Kerry Washington.  Whoopi Goldberg was a hoot in this movie.  SHE MADE THE MOVIE!!!!",1484179200,,387,4.380281690140845
7489526,2,B0176IENR4,"Disclaimer: posted by Lance's wife.  Wasn't 100% awful, but most of the accents were bad, lines stilted and obviously slanted to score several heavier than usual political points. The ending was false (not the only part) and so syrupy it felt uncomfortable. Ashley s patented ""Sweet, soft eyes"" felt not only patronizing, but in stark contrast to the childish acting out in her character otherwise. Whoopie's early lines were largely inexplicable. It overall felt insulting. I wanted to enjoy this but almost turned it off more than once. Word to the wise: it's free on Netflix Jan 2017, if you must.",1484006400,,600,4.9405940594059405

7489557,4,B0176IENR4,"This movie -  the only reason I initially decided to watch it was because when I logged on to Netflix, this one was right on the home screen, and while I really wanted to watch a movie that night, I was in no mood to browse and select.

Which is how, I ended up seeing this one, and which is why, I had no idea that this was a book to movie adaptation. Nonetheless, I don't think I would have ever gotten to this book, so just as well that I saw the movie.

At first sight, this one did not seem to be my type. As I got through the first half hour, I was convinced that this was most definitely not my usual type at all. But for some reason, I could not stop watching. At that time, I chalked it down to laziness, but now, in hindsight, I know - it wasn't that - this movie had a certain irresistible charm.

And honestly, it is difficult to pinpoint what is it exactly about this movie. The plot/story and the acting - while good, is nothing out of the ordinary. But that's just it, I think - this movie is able to capture the charm in the ordinary and mundane.

It's about a simple girl, and the small town in which she has lived all her life. It has romance, and it has its genuinely hilarious moments, but I would not call it a romantic comedy. It's more of a feel-good romance, which is heartfelt and homey - something that puts a warm smile on your face.

So, if you are looking for the screen equivalent of comfort food, I would certainly recommend this one.

7489579,3,B0176IENR4,"To the extent that this is a movie about talented actors having a good time hanging out together in a small town, it's decent. The cast is weird but fun to watch, Ashley Judd is lovely and Patrick Wilson makes an excellent case for bringing back 1970s sideburns even if he's a little too pretty to be believable as a lifelong coal miner. Unfortunately the story is all over the place. It takes almost three-quarters of the film for the plot and the central romance to come together and then the ending is a rush job that doesn't make a whole lot of sense or match the tone of what came before.

Still, it was enjoyable enough that a) I was legitimately bummed that it was not better and b) it would not put me off trying the book series.",1472169600,,737,4.264285714285714

7489588,3,B0176IENR4,"Like an inexpensive Pinot Grigio that is refreshing for an evening but not long remembered, this Ashley Judd film is entertaining, good for lots of smiles and a few laughs.

The film is clearly designed to showcase Judd's beauty and talent. She's not short on either, but the enterprise stretches itself a bit to make the point.

The film leads us through an unlikely scenario in Virginian Appalachia with a certain brio. The plot is spelled out in many reviews, so I'll tread lightly on that in this reviewer's note. The sentimental value is high, and there are some genuine tear-jerker moments, prominently in the last five minutes.

Among the actors and actresses going small-town, Anthony LaPaglia is likely to escape mention for his role at small-town lawyer Spec Broadwater and friend-like-brother to Judd's Ave Marie Mulligan. But he should not. He plays it like a man on the verge of long-term depression who never quite gives in, somehow maintaining a focus on others rather than on his own deep darkness. Jasmine Guy's small role as Leah Grimes is also well turned.

This light flick is not one for the ages. But there's nothing wrong with store-bought Pinot Grigio on a summer evening.",1469491200,,1196,4.876847290640394
7489589,4,B0176IENR4,I haven't read the books.  I noticed a lot of reviewers compared the books and the movie and the movie came up short by comparison.  I enjoyed the movie for what it was: an entertaining story about a woman who must make a hard choice after her mother's death.  Whether to stay in Big Stone Gap or go to Italy to look for her father whom she has never met.  The actors were competent.  The production values a little lower than some big budget films.  But that's okay.  I liked the heart of the story.  That small town folks support one another.  And I loved the multicultural cast. It's the type of movie you watch on a rainy day.,1469404800,,630,4.226890756302521

The ending was supposed to be heartwarming but to me it was a feeble attempt to pull the whole mess together.  Have you ever seen an entire town gather to watch someone greet an out of the country relative?  Give me a break.

7489639,5,B0176IENR4,"'Ave Maria Mulligan' (Ashley Judd) calls herself the towns Spinster. Happily, though, her life appears full as she is quite a busy woman most all of the time, there just hasn't been enough time for her... for Ave. She lives with her mother, owns, and works at, the familys Pharmacy alongside coworker, ""Fleeta Mullins"" (Whoopi Goldberg in a smaller but acerbically comedic role), but Ave has started questioning everything about her life. She directs the towns production of The Tale of The Lonesome Pine at their outdoor theater while most of the town is involved to some degree. This is their Virginia; a lush and foliage splashed, beautiful little country town softly settled in the atmospheric Appalachian Mountains. The background scenery (Renaldo Villalobos) along with the residents going about their lives helps paint a picture of small-town life that looks and feels as if it was pulled from the pages of a Norman Rockwell coffee table book.

In the town of Big Stone Gap, their men toil daily in the coal mines and they return home when the day is done. Aves friend, Jack MacChesney (Patrick Wilson) is dating Sweet Sue"" Tinsley (Jane Krakowski) even though his mother isn't too pleased about it. She has another on her radar for him. Iva Lou Wade (Jenna Elfman in another quirky role) is the librarian who drives the bookmobile around town while dropping off books for those who need them and purporting the facts of ""Chinese Facial Reading"". As you can see, ""Big Stone Gap"", written and directed by Adriana Trigiani, is filled with colorful people who have known each other for decades and some since their school days. Along with the daily shuffle of the citizens, pleasant country-based music (John Leventhal) keeps us waxing nostalgic; if so inclined.

Its now the year of 1978 and Ave hits forty then realizing that her world just got complicated in every way. She has to find more information about something her friend, Spec (Anthony LaPaglia), has told her. For Ave Maria Mulligan, it is a something concerning her past, her life, and her identity which inevitably could change her whole reality.

This is a sweet film that creates an easy mood to view during a lazy weekend or evening dedicated to relaxing. There is great comedic timing from Goldberg and Elfman which is done quite well and adds so much. You'll view lovely scenes of small town life along with an unhurried, uncomplicated storyline that won't wear you out with its pace. An easy to view drama and another feel good movie for me",1465862400,3,2515,4.844186046511628

Besides, I really like Patrick Wilson.  I saw him in 'A Gifted Man' and he was so handsome.  And I was happy that he did get together with Ave at the end.  I also thought it was funny when Elizabeth Taylor came to town with her then husband John Warner (on a Campaign bus no less) and choked on a chicken bone, even though we never saw her face.  I don't know why this was even in the movie?? I was dying to see her face because in real life she is married to Patrick Wilson.  Patrick Wilson, by the way, comes from Big Stone Gap!

Maybe there wasn't enough time.  I loved all of the casting except Ashley Judd.  She's a great actress, but Ave Maria is supposed to be a very Italian looking, dark haired spinster.  That's just not a role she can pull off.  I'm not sure I would've been able to follow what was happening and make complete sense of it if I hadn't read the books.

7489726,4,B0176IENR4,"I had read the book first and really wanted to like this film, which was made just up the road from me. For the most part I did. However, whoever staged the coal mining scenes knew absolutely NOTHING about what a coal mine should look like. Men shoveling coal into piles by hand. Really?!
This was 1978 after all not 1878. And what all those half buried corrugated pipe thingies were supposed to be I have no idea. They should have just stuck to the scenes where the men were coming and going from the mine and left it at that. It was totally ridiculous. Also, I felt that the characters were a bit over the top, especially Sweet Sue and Iva Lou. But I could forgive that, since I know she was writing broadly, not for realism but for iconic effect. Ashley Judd does a great job and I loved The character of Jack Mack. He was perfect!  So was his mom. And whoever made those biscuits for that scene in the Mac Chesney kitchen deserves the academy award for realism. They made me hungry just to look at them! I also loved Whoopi Goldburg as Fleeta. Even though the character in the book is very different she brought the heart and spirit of Fleeta to life I thought.
  Over all, a sweet but somewhat over the top movie, that manages to capture the magic and love that is Appalachia. I had to knock off one star for not getting the coal mining scenes even close to correct but the outdoor drama was dead on. Likeable characters and a happy ending.

7489776,5,B0176IENR4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was quite surprised that I did!  Based on the movie trailer,  I really expected it to be silly and stupid despite enjoying  the book a few years ago.  The author of the book directed this film ( and stars in it at the end of the movie) and she did a fabulous job.  There is an all star cast and some locals from BSG and they each played their parts with perfection.  There seemed to be a few sub- plots in the movie though the central plot revolves around Judd's character.  It's a story about the human pursuit of success and happiness and our need for connection of community & family and love.  It was such a pleasure to watch a very realistic human story without any violence, lewd language and sex.  I think it's a sad world today when people actually vote a movie down because it wasn't action-packed with vices and violence.
As a family historian with roots in BSG,  I enjoyed the actual footage of Big Stone Gap and surrounding area.  The movie was filmed entirely on location in BSG.  The soundtrack is AWESOME!
Thanks Adriana for a job well-done and for keeping it real in BSG.",1458777600,,1123,4.398058252427185

The movie doesn't follow the book exactly which is to be expected but it went off the tracks in this case.  It ended ABRUPTLY.

There were a few quirky bits that could have stood some fleshing out (the transformation of Pearl, for one), but the cast and setting, the filming and music, the ""realness"" of the people in the town made this movie an absolute charmer. Ashley Judd is always a winner, Jenna Elfman a wonderful choice for the best-friend-bookmobile-driver-love-guru-matchmaker, and Patrick Wilson the perfect love interest. In fact, the whole cast of actors seemed like they stepped right out of the book. Fairly clean, great comedic timing, good message about happiness and home, but not necessarily a great Family Night movie if you have younger kids. Because most of the main characters were in their late thirties/early forties, the movie felt geared more toward the same aged audience. Our teenager enjoyed it, but younger kids probably wouldn't find it interesting.

If you're older it will be a nostalgic trip to a simpler day where everyone knew their neighbor and stood by them in a pinch. Younger viewers can get a glimpse of a life that many of us cherish.  One thing we liked is that it is a ""clean"" movie that a family can watch together. It has a strong cast of top actors and beautiful scenes of Southwest Virginia.",1454976000,,513,4.029411764705882

7490298,5,B0176IENR4,"The film takes place in 1978 in the small mining town of Big Stone Gap, Virginia. It centers on Ave Maria Mulligan who is ""the town spinster"" and owns the pharmacy. Her boyfriend is Theodore Tipton (John Benjamin Hickey) an outsider.  It is clear her heart is with Jack MacChesney (Patrick Wilson) who likewise had loved her since the sixth grade. Jack works in the mines and is dating Sweet Sue (Jane Krakowski) a single mom who oozes with love and affection. The deck is stacked against them.

The film had its mildly humorous  moments, but is clearly not a romantic comedy. It is a feel good formula romance. It won't win any awards, but there was nothing bad about the feature. Whoopi Goldberg had a role slightly less than her billing, but was still entertaining. Dagmara Dominczyk who plays Elizabeth Taylor in the film is Patrick Wilson's off screen wife.

If a simple small town formula feel good romance is what you want to watch, look no further.

I can't imagine someone making sense of this film if they hadn't read the book first.  Although I love Ashley Judd as an actress I feel she was miscast for this role; I have a difficult time seeing her as the 40 year old Ava.

Maybe a Hallmark series would have been a better choice. Fleeta - performed by Whooping Goldberg is by far my favorite character in the movie. I don't think Theodore is a good reflection of the book. It's tough for me because I love the series - because of the characters and storyline.  I just don't think the movie delivers. Maybe if you don't know the books, you will enjoy.

Ave Maria is the pharmacist in the small town and a self-proclaimed spinster. She keeps herself busy helping everyone in town, but never really thinks of herself. Upon her mothers' death, Ave Maria learns about her mother's life and a secret that was kept from her. Ave Maria decides to start thinking about herself and reinventing her life. Big changes are coming. Ave Maria is a very complex character and I enjoyed watching her grow (even though she's in her 30s). She started off not trusting people or herself. She had amazing daydreams about what she thought people were saying (reading between the lines). Her friends in Big Stone Gap are very loving and people I would like to have as friends. Ave Maria has two love interests and I would have had a hard time choosing as well. The book moves at a good pace and although I was expecting things to happen quicker, it all comes together nicely.",1521504000,2,1014,4.607734806629834
