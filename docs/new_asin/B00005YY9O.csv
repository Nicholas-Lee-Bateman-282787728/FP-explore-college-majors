7957344,5,B00005YY9O,"I found these two movies absolutely fascinating, and so did my kids! The first - Marathon in the Sky, has great aerial shots of pigeons in flight, a ton of history about the sport, and great information on homers in general. Oldest Feathered Friend gives another perspective to the history of pigeons. My kids learned about Darwin from a movie about pigeons! Along with covering Darwin and dovecotes, Oldest Feathered Friend has some truly beautiful shots of the many varieties of fancy birds. My family thoroughly enjoyed these movies. My kids want to help me in the loft AND they want their own fantails and rollers.",1218672000,,618,4.839622641509434
7957345,5,B00005YY9O,This DVD is a wonderful combination of films. Marathon In The Sky is an absolute classic on the pigeon racing sport.  Nothing else ever made comes close to this stroy of modern pigeon racing.  Oldest Feathered Friend is equally fascinating because it presents a broad historic perspective on how important pigeons have been to mankind for centuries.  Jim Jenner is an absolute master at combining wonderful pictures with superb writing to bring across the drama and beauty of pigeon racing and the joys of keeping these birds as pets.,1132272000,9,534,4.977528089887641
