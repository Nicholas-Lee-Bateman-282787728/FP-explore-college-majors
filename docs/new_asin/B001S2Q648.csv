8339318,5,B001S2Q648,"I designed and created this instructional DVD for people with little or no computer experience. More experienced computer users may find the pace too slow (but I hope not too slow).

I drew on my experiences as an adult services librarian and computer technologies instructor to create this program.

This computer help video can be watched on a computer (that has a DVD drive) or on TV through a standalone DVD player.

This program includes step-by-step visual demonstrations to get ""computer shy"" users of all ages up and running with Microsoft Word 2003 in less than two hours.

Topics include: getting started with Microsoft Word 2003, how to open and save documents, how to create and edit documents, how to format documents, how to insert headers and footers and how to insert images into your documents.",1240876800,,811,4.9411764705882355
