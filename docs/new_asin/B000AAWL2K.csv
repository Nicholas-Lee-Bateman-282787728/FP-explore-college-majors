8472905,5,B000AAWL2K,"This review is on the DVD ""La puta del Rey"" (the King's Whore. Spanish/English version) 95min and ""La Putain du Roi"" (The King's Whore. French version) 127min.

Good music and a very good performance of Timothy Dalton in the main role. I didn't know this actor (I don't like James Bond films) and I was surprised. I don't understand why he is not better known.

The film portraits this conflictive situation:

KING VITORIO AMADEO II : He is a XVIIIth century King and he is a bored man who has always had everything in life without effort and is sourrounded by people who fear him and bow to him. He lacks a goal in life and being an intelligent man he resents it.

One day he meets Jeanne and she is the first person that not only doesn't fear him or wants to gain his favour, but she also is a happy person (which the king is not)

Consequently he wants to get her and logically the more she refuses him, the more he wants her, until conquering her becomes an obsession.

He thought first that having her body would suffice, but as she made it clear from the beginnig that only her body - an this as a matter of duty - was all she was going to give him, the King tried everything in his power (from giving presents and kindness to outbursts of desperate violence) to get her love too. He devoted his life to this only goal, forgetting everything else, his family, his kingdom and this obsession had terrible consequences for him and his country.

His error was to behave as he had always been used to, that is, comanding. He would probably have had better results if having the power to force her, he had respected her while continuing to let her know how much he loved her. In fact the only time he got her to call him by his first name was with a most humble present (a wood comb the king had himself carved for her), the only present that Jeanne didn't consider as a payment for her ""services"".

JEANNE: the film is also the sad story of this young girl, happily married - a quite rare condition at the time - , who had the misfortune of encountering the King. Her drama was that not only her family in law, the priests or even the Queen asked her to yield to the King, but her own husband agreed to it.

When she realized this, she gave up and accepted to become the King's mistress, but she then became bitter and decided to take revenge on everybody, from her husband to the King. She couldn't exit this situation, she felt trapped with the King forcing her to be his mistress and no husband or family to help her.

She therefore forced herself to hate the King, without realizing that by showing her hate she enticed him even more, as he was obsessed to conquer her. But I suppose that her heart was the only thing left to her to decide on her free will, and she was determined to at least not give this to anybody again.

JEANNE'S HUSBAND: this is the worst defined role of the four main involved in the film. We are not completely sure why he gave up his wife.

There are at least 2 versions on DVD of this film. In the short 95min Spanish version, we get the idea that he is rather indifferent towards this situation and that he probably gave up her wife to the King to assure himself the success in his career, but in the long 127min French version we see that the night he follows Jeanne to try to stop her, when he realizes that it's too late, he throws himself weeping on the floor, under the rain, letting us think that he loved her and it was perhaps a matter of blind loyalty towards the King which make him give her up. Anyway, the husband role is not well enough developed.

THE QUEEN: very little is told about her, but we get to know that she loved her husband. She loved him enough to humiliate herself by begging Jeanne to give up to the King and to later get a medicine to heal her rival when Jeanne gets ill.

A complicate story, with good performances, good music and costumes, but a gloomy story. The best performance is by far that of the King. His predator eagle look over Jeanne is unforgivable.

There are several DVD versions, and surprinsingly the long ones lack some scenes that the short has. The ending (and other details, even the order of some scenes) is different and less depresive in the short (Spanish) version and apparently more acurate as King Vitorio Amadeo II didn't die young.

I'd advise to buy the longest one, as the short is so severely abridged that it's hard to understand why some things happen.

But if you like the story I'd advise to buy both as it's the only way to see some relevant scenes that are in the short 95min version (for example, the brief but interesting scene when the King asks Jeanne to give him a son and she refuses. Also how Jeanne manipulates her husband to help her to flee at the end of the film)

Even watching both versions we get the idea that there may be more deleted material, as the progress of King's Vitorio falling in love with Jeanne is not developped but rather happens too quickly. Also why she flees just when she's starting to fall in love with him is not well explained. But the original film was already 132min and I suppose exceeding this would have been unreasonable. Well, I'd have deleted those symbolic scenes about freedom with the fox, in order to give more filming time to the story itself and fully develop it.",1272844800,2,5318,4.332997987927565
