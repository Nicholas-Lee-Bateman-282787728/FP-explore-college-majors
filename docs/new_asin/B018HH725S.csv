8742344,4,B018HH725S,"Basically, I like Ovidie's work. She believes in sexual freedom and that's what this movie is about.  Claire (Tiffany Doll) is in a relationship with her boyfriend, lasting 10 years. She bumps into Jolene, a visiting woman (from San Francisco) and the two of them have a relationship. There are two bisexual men from San Francisco who also play a major part in this film. There are explicit scenes with Jolene and the two men, which Claire watches and gets pissed off. I enjoy watching the director's commentary and the making of the film. There is a scene where Claire's boyfriend has sex with a beautiful Asian girl, but this is cut from the actual film. That's why I give it four stars. The finale with Claire and Jolene is very explicit. In fact, Claire looks on with an amused expression. This is not porn.  The movie is in French, with subtitles.",1527206400,,852,4.598684210526316

8742346,2,B018HH725S,I was surprised by this Ovidie movie. Wish I did more research on this one. Straight guys beware!  This has gay male oral sex! Only reason I rated this 2 stars instead of 1 was because of the lesbian strap on scene.,1459123200,,215,4.119047619047619
