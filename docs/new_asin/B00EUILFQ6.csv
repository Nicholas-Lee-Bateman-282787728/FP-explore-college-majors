8627986,5,B00EUILFQ6,"Now for those who don't already know, Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (P.W.G.) is a promotion based out of southern California who holds events monthly/bi-monthly that feature local independent wrestlers along with some names who work for other promotions as well like Ring Of Honor, DragonGate, Evolve, and Championship Wrestling From Hollywood with this event celebrating the decade anniversary of the promotion.

The main event here was a triple threat Ladder Match with the P.W.G. Tag Team Champions Young Bucks defending the titles against the Dojo Bros. & Inner City Machine Gunz that started off with a bang with one man being knocked off the apron into the second row taking out fans in the process & the action not letting up from there with a ladder being used as a springboard & ramp, various backdrops onto & falls & drop offs the ladder, Ricochet diving through the ladders on more than one occasion, some big moves off the ladder such a frog splash & powerbomb off the ladder through a table & piledriver with the spike coming off the top, and 3 different ladders in the ring at one point including one ladder that was just too high to the point where the fans chanted ""IT'S NOT SAFE!""  P.W.G. Champion Adam Cole defended the title in a Guerrilla Warfare match against Kevin Steen & Drake Younger in a match were Cole was clearly the odd man out leading to various double teams with the fight going in & out of the ring along with weapons being used such as plastic & steel chairs, trash cans & lids, tables and even a traffic safety cone.  Other matches include the return of Joey Ryan teaming with Ryan Taylor & Peter Avalon vs. Willie Mack & B-Boy & Candice LaRae that also saw a return of the P.W.G. legend, Anthony Nese making his P.W.G. debut vs. Brian Cage with both men showing athletic ability for their size & body builds, RockNES Monsters vs. Forever Hooligans that saw some unique & comedic double team moves from both teams, Michael Elgin vs. A.R. Fox in a ""power vs. aerial"" match-up with some of the most unique top rope & power moves you've ever seen, Brian Kendrick & Paul London vs. Johnny Gargano & Chuck Taylor in an athletic match that saw it all from dancing to duels with the match starting with a chicken fight, and T.J. Perkins vs. Kyle O'Riley in a technical submission based encounter.

One of the best shows in P.W.G. as they gave you a taste of everything here from top to bottom with each match having a special highlight of the night so this is an event I have to recommend.",1383177600,,2511,4.573333333333333
