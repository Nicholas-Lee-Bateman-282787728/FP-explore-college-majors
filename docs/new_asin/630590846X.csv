7897356,2,630590846X,"The group I Vespri Musicali sounded interesting, though I had no specific recollection of it, and the program of music looked OK, so I ordered the DVD to supplement my rather meager collection of music DVDs.  (Most of my music collection is on CDs.)  When the disk arrived I rather eagerly popped it into my player to enjoy a bit of music made more realistic by being able to see as well as hear the players.  It wasn't very far into the first piece that I began to wonder about the wisdom of my purchase, and each succeeding piece served to strengthen my sense of musical malaise.  The instrumentalists played quite well, though the mannerisms of one or two were a little distracting.  The singers, however, for all their earnestness, just didn't measure up.  One problem was a rather slippery concept of pitch.  Another was simply delivery.  The soprano and tenor simply did not seem prepared to give truly professional performances, despite their obvious training.  I abandoned my audition of the DVD after 4 or 5 pieces, and felt that I had wasted most of the time I'd spent.

For its part, the instrumental group did a pretty good job of presenting its part of the music, even negotiating successfully some rather demanding passages.  I really don't find any fault with them.  It is too bad, though, that they were encumbered by such unimpressive vocalists--a real mismatch of talents.

I naturally cannot offer a favorable recommendation of this DVD.  Though it seems to be available at Amazon at modest prices, I don't suggest ordering it.

The concept of the DVD--Da Vinci's famous Last Supper painting and music thematically connected with it--is interesting enough, but even Da Vinci's genius can't make up for the deficiencies of the DVD.  Too bad.",1384300800,,1759,4.832775919732441
