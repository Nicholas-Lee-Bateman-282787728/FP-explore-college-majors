727782,3,6303918468,"I think if Joan Crawford had not been cast in this film it would not be given much importance because it is not that good a film but she manages to give one of her most sympathetic performances, one for which she was nominated for an Academy Award, although she should have recieved this honor for some of her other work like JOHNNY GUITAR or WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE?. Almost singlehandly she manages to provide the movie with many moments of unbearable suspense though the directon is not too shabby. The director David Miller uses light and shadows to provide a good, tension filled atmosphere and Gloria Grahame,in a performance for which she was nomintated as best supporting actress, also supplies great support and she is defintley a highlight. Jack Palance is very menacing in this movie and he also manages to do a good job. The script is not that original though and ultimatly the script is the problem with the movie. And before i forget the story is about a playwright named Myra Hudson(Joan Crawford) who marries the actor she fired from her play(Jack Palance). She then discovers a plot that has been concocted between her husband and his lover( Gloria Grahame) to kill her for her money. Then she comes up with a plot to kill them instead. But will she go through with it? You will have to find out.",987552000,3,1321,4.601694915254237
727783,5,6303918468,"This is a first-class thriller based on the novel by Edna Sherry of an affluent playwright who discovers her new husband is planning to kill her. You see, she done him wrong at an earlier date. Now it's retribution time. But who is outdoing whom? Twists abound. Joan Crawford (Oscar nominated) and Jack Palance (his first Oscar nomination) are excellent. The cast also includes Gloria Grahame, Bruce Bennett, Virginia Huston and Touch (Mike) Connors. The effective Black and White cinematography is by Charles Lang (also Oscar nominated). This film also boasts one of Elmer Bernstein's earliest scores. Bernstein has been a leading writer of film scores since the mid-1950s, when his work on THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM (1955) and THE TEN COMMANDMENTS (1956) elevated him into the front rank of Hollywood composers. His score for THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN (1960) made him immortal and launched him into a string of successful Western scores through that decade. However, he highly has been noted for his strong use of solo instruments and his facility with the jazz idiom. 1999's WILD, WILD WEST returned him to his beloved Western.",982368000,16,1128,5.037433155080214
727784,4,6303918468,"One of the problems with buying Joan in the woman-in-distress in this movie is just that Joan is just not very good at playing it (She stares Palance down with the eyes of a gunslinger and looks as if she could take him out with one punch). Once she decides that she is going to engineer the demise of both her murderous husband and his girlfriend, we are in territory that Crawford is best in. But I am not saying she can't be good- despite the nutty scene where she finds out that Palance plans to off her (where she does everything but juggle while spinning her head around a la Linda Blair in ""The Exorcist""), she's good in this one. (Especially in the scene where she catches her reflection in the mirror with a gun and actually ""sees"" herself for the first time. ) Slighly looney, like most late-middle era Crawford flicks, but our Joan makes you buy it lock, stock, and barrel.",964137600,,884,4.396341463414634
727785,5,6303918468,Joan is superb in this thriller! Joan earned her second oscar nomination as she plays a playrite who fall sfor the wrong guy and then learns the horrible truth and in such a rottten way too! I marveled at Joans character  plots her clever defense! This one will keep you on the edge of youe seat.  They aren't made like this any more but they out to be!,962928000,,353,4.176470588235294
727786,2,6303918468,"Can anyone who watches this movie ever erase from their mind the scene where Crawford finds out Palance and Grahame are plotting to kill her and  goes stark, raving mad? It an Olympian display of overacting that has never  been equalled: Crawford pulls at her hair, wildly darts her unfocused,  bulging eyes, clamps her ears shut, pulls tight her grimacing mouth.  A  lunatic chimpanzee receiving electroshock couldn't do justice to Crawford's  facial contortions here.  I guess the reason that Crawford is such a  fascinating screen presence to fans and nonfans alike is that she's a  relentless masochist. In movie after movie, no matter what terrible fate  befalls her, no matter how many times she is betrayed, it's nothing  compared to the mental punishments she visits upon herself.  The movie  itself is serviceable but fairly ludicrous; there are glaring plot holes  almost never seen in true film noir. The entire switched-identities ending  is just about as bizarre as Crawford's performance.",950832000,6,1002,5.213836477987422
727787,5,6303918468,"One of the best Joan Crawford movies I have ever seen.  It really kept me interested the entire time (but to be honest, I could watch her do the dishes and be pleased!)  Myra Hudson overhears her husband, a man she has  adored, plot her murder with his mistress.  Using her ingenious mind, she  plots her own revenge against her unfaithful husband and his mistress.  Not  one minute of the movie is wasted.  She honestly deserved the Academy Award  nomination she received.  Sit back!  Watch the show!  Be thoroughly  entertained by one of the best!",913939200,10,549,4.652631578947369

7855180,5,6303918468,"WOW Sudden Fear! One of the first Joan films I have ever seen(way back in 99/2000),it still remains one of her best! If I had to choose(from the titles I have seen/own),A Woman's Face,Sudden fear,Mildred,Dancing Lady,The Women.

First off, some side notes...By 1952,Joan had terminated her contract with Warners after some less than mediocre assignments. For the first time in her long career, she became a freelance artist. She found the script at RKO,and ultimatly doubled up as actress and producer. Joan also took less money up front and more percentage from the potential(big)box office. When the film became a huge hit,it help revive her fortunes as well as her 3rd oscar nod. Incidently, Joan INSISTED on Marlon Brando for the role of husband from hell ""lester Blaine"" Apparenly she hounded him a few times, and after she sent him the script, she recieved a note stating he ""isn't interested in doing any mother-son pictures at this time"" HARSH! I'm sure Joan reached for the 80 proof when she got that one!

In this film,Joan plays""Myra(Can't remember the last name)"" a older playright/hieress. Only in Joan's world can someone be both a playright AND an heiress! One a cross country train trip Myra encounters an actor she recently fired from one of her play's""lester Blaine(the wonderful Jack Palance in his movie debut)"". Of course they get to talking and romance blossoms(sigh).

Upon the new couple's return to San fransico, all is right with the world and Joan is feeling ""very gay"" due to her impending engagement...

THE DICTAPHONES SECRET;

Myra keeps a BIG ASS dictaphone in her study for the purpose of recording anything she needs to apparently. One morning after a party, Myra turns it on and to her SUDDEN FEAR, she encounters a plot by her new HUBBY to kill her during the thin window before her new will bequests the majority of her vast estate to charity,,,Instead of a NORMAL person whom take the recording to the police, Joan attempts to hie it and BREAKS IT!Joan realizes she must take it upon herself to save her own life! Ergo,Joan world becomes a crazy mix of paranoia,hallucinations, and nightmares. Some of joans acting in the nightmare sequences is pretty hokey, but excluding this, her acting can't be topped! Again, as in 'A Womans Face"" in the crucial third act, Joan is required to emote bec she is hiding in a closet from lester,,,This is one of the best sequences of the film and is beautifully shot,,,There is alot of tension in this film after Myra's discovery(obviously)...and the viewer never forgets Joan MASTERED the requisite talent harking back to her silent days.... Another highlight is when Joan(earlier in the film-pretending she knows nothing) sickenly sweetly proclaims to lester,""I don't know what i did to deserve you...""After she turns her back to him,,,,you can REALLY see what is going on in her head,,,,,but the brilliance is how quickly, severly, and convincingly her mood changes,,,One of course can only expect this from truly great talent....

Also worth mentioning is the excellent Gloria Graham(as Irene the other woman unbeknowst to Joan) whom was making a name for herself in gritty,hardboiled tough guy films... her comments to joan after joan'sprains"" her ankle are quite snarky and fun! This is one of Joan's best!",1279152000,,3285,4.963636363636364
7855181,5,6303918468,"Joan Crawford richly deserved the Oscar nomination she garnered for her emotionally charged performance of wealthy heiress and celebrated playwright Myra Hudson in the taut and suspenseful ""Sudden Fear"".

Crawford monitoring the previews for her latest Broadway play fires leading man Lester Blaine played by also Oscar nominated Jack Palance.  She doesn't feel that the craggy Palance has the proper matinee idol looks for the role.  She soon after embarks on a transcontinental train headed for her home town of San Francisco, when she unexpectedly bumps into none other but Palance.

Palance turns on the charm and woos Crawford and they fall in love and marry.  Though acting as the perfect husband, conniving deceit surfaces through Palance's transparent veneer when he encounters ex-girlfriend Irene played by the lispy Gloria Grahame.  They still are in love and plot to do away with Crawford before she can sign her updated will which will provide only a relative pittance for Palance.

Palance and Grahame discuss a scheme to kill Crawford by an accident, in her office and are unwittingly recorded by her dictation machine which was left on.  Crawford learns of the plot and with her calculating mind devises a strategy to save herself and murder Palance while implicating Grahame.

Although her plan seems infallible she can't go through with it but the co-conspirators get their just desserts regardless.

David Miller's apt direction and stark black and white cinematography are bolstered by the Elmer Bernstein musical score to create a gripping film noir thriller.",1130803200,6,1579,5.254980079681275

7855184,4,6303918468,"Perfect casting, careful pacing, and precise characterizations are the specialties of this suspenseful film noir.  Of particular interest is the plot's patient development of the relationship between Crawford and Palance, an intricate bond that continues to intrigue as the harmony of their home begins to ring hollow.  Palance's powerful sex appeal is like a lightning rod that draws both Crawford and Grahame, and, though nothing in the storyline comes as a shock, the details are utterly jolting!",1032825600,2,499,5.467532467532467
7855185,4,6303918468,"Most of the previous reviewers have done an excellent job of outlining the plot details of this fine older film.  I have just a few comments to add.
Since DVDs have arrived and video has become a stepchild, we have an excellent opportunity to view old favorites with little impact on the purse.  Sometimes a visit to old haunts proves our memory a little faulty or shows the film itself just hasn't aged well.
I loved this movie that first time around and it proved to be just as wonderful in a recent memory lane visit.
Joan Crawford, never one of my favorite actresses, deserved the Oscar for this performance, not just a nomination.  It was definitely one of her best.  She was able to convey the 'fear' without making one groan at any overacting.  She portrayed a bright woman with a fear, a plan, a conscious, and a heart with  brilliance and with just the right amount of conviction.
Jack Palance, conversely always a favorite of mine, was his menacing best in this performance without having to overact for a second.  The perfect role, played to perfection.
It is always enjoyable to see the work of stars you have forgotten were in favorite old films.  Touch (Mike) Conners (TV's Mannix) played Sonny in this film, which didn't rumble back into memory when I watched him each week on TV, but I recognized his name in the opening credits immediately this time. It was very interesting to watch him in retrospect in an early effort (perhaps his first?).
Hollywood in their infinite wisdom seems to have decided that today's audiences are too jaded, too sophisticated, too juvenile, or too something to enjoy a simple thriller in the ilk of 'Sudden Fear', 'Midnight Lace', or other great 'woman-in-distress/woman-with-a-plan films, unless they modern-it-up as in 'Panic Room'.  Perhaps they know a thing or two, since they are wealthy and I work a 9-to-5 job and post reviews on a website.
However, speaking for myself, and hopefully for other viewers who still enjoy; a simple plot with character-study, suspense, b/w beauty, and pleasure while viewing, 'Sudden Fear' tells a great story in a suspenseful manner.  I still makes for great  viewing.  Grab yourself a bargain and enjoy!",1030838400,4,2189,4.823529411764706
7855186,5,6303918468,"Joan Crawford achieved one of her greatest performances in the 1952 suspense classic ""Sudden Fear.""  In the manner of so many great Hollywood classics, this film overcame an initial major hurdle when, after the film's director, David Miller, following dinner and discussion with the great actress, was reportedly told to leave in the most emotional terms by Crawford.
The basis for Crawford's strong creative disagreement with Miller, and what would be a pivotal element of the project, was Miller's belief that film newcomer Jack Palance would be ideal for her leading man.  As proof of his point, Miller had brought along a film for Crawford to watch after dinner, which was Palance's debut, ""Panic in the Streets.""  After viewing the film Crawford mistakenly believed that Miller had either Richard Widmark or Paul Douglas, longstanding film professionals, in mind to play opposite her, and was insulted when Miller suggested newcomer Palance.  Crawford reportedly also was turned off by Palance's appearance.
Miller finally got Crawford to see things his way and the rest is cinema history as both the great leading lady and Palance received deserving Oscar nominations for their brilliant performances.  Miller was shrewd enough to realize that an offbeat, terrifying looking leading man was just the antidote for Crawford, who therefore could appear vulnerable as was required by the exigencies of the story.  The fascinating element about Crawford in this film is that she appears appropriately terrified, forging an entirely different persona from the assertive executive female type she normally played who was in full command of her agenda.
The early phase of the film has a ""life imitates art"" aspect when Crawford, as Myra Hudson, a successful playwright, rejects actor Lester Blaine, played by Palance, for the lead in her Broadway play because he does not look appropriately romantic enough to play as leading man.  He angrily tells her before leaving the theater that he looks exactly like that legendary lover of old, Cassanova.
After Crawford's play opens to smashing reviews in New York she returns to her home in San Francisco, meeting Palance again as they are traveling on the same train.  The second meeting between them becomes so supercharged with emotion that Palance abandons plans to stop in Chicago, where a new job offer beckons, traveling instead to San Francisco with Crawford.
Myra Hudson comes from old San Francisco wealth.  This along with her rich play royalties make her an enticing catch for the opportunistic Palance, who in time proves he more than looks like Cassanova.  Before long the successful socialite and playwright becomes Mrs. Lester Blaine.
At that point Palance's old romantic flame from New York, Gloria Grahame, enters the scene.  They then plot to kill Crawford for her money.  Crawford learns about their plot when it turns up on her dictating machine, unknown to the plotters.
The story then enters a uniquely fascinating phase as Crawford seeks to use her playwright's imagination to concoct a scenario wherein the Palance-Grahame team will fail in their attempt and she will survive.  Many of the scenes contain little or no dialogue, with Crawford's expressive eyes revealed with haunting conviction as they register alternately sadness over being betrayed by someone to whom she gave her heart and fear over being killed by the ruthless team of Palance and Grahame, who are tough-willed and make it plain they will stop at nothing to achieve their objective of wealth at Crawford's expense.
In addition to pulsating drama, viewers are also treated to the beautiful scenery of San Francisco, which is captured magnificently by the camera's all-seeing eye.",1025740800,6,3715,5.2130872483221475
7855187,5,6303918468,This is definitely one to add to the collection!  Joan Crawford gives a dynamite performance here.  And the great ending caught me completely off guard!  Very neat twist!  Now available on DVD too.,1009065600,2,197,4.878787878787879
