It takes you on an indepth journey with 22 feature film directors as viewed through their eyes as well as famous actors that they have worked with.  As in any documentary setting, the editions vary in quality, but the good ones make the purchase well worth while.  In particular I enjoyed the interviews with: Ron Howard, John McTiernan, Steven Speilberg, Milos Foreman, and Joel Schumacher.  These interviews expand the viewers horizons and allow them to get an inside look at the successes and failures that each feature director has experienced.  Well worth the purchase...",996451200,25,663,5.101851851851852
