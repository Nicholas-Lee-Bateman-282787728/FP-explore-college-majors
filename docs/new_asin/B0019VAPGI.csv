8275336,1,B0019VAPGI,I have the Earth Science Essentials series and it is poor. I would not recommend this company's products based on my review of THIS OTHER PRODUCT: there are scattered errors and the video is poor quality. One positive note: the content seems closely aligned to NEA teaching content standards. Have not actually seen the Ecology video however.,1226448000,,342,5.017543859649122
