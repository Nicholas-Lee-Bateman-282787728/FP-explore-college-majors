8319484,4,B001LQK39U,"If you teach poetry, this is a nice safe video to show just like the title says. However, I would not label this as a ""slam"". There is no ""rating"" of the poems and there is no explanation of what a ""Slam"" is.

It is a collection of poets reciting their original poems and some published poems such as:  Victor Herendez Cruz ""Problems with Hurricanes,""Death be Not Proud"" by John Donne, ""The Tuft of flowers"" by Robert Frost, ""When I have Fears that I may Cease to Be"" by John Keats.

The original poems appeal to middle school kids. Some of the original themes are: video games, school lunches,dreams/goals, A.D.D.,fireworks,and quite a few Haikus. It is about 55 mins long. If nothing else, it would be a safe DVD for a ""sub"" day.",1300406400,,731,4.481203007518797

We were looking for a safe way to show our students what a poetry slam looked for and I bought this video.  We watched it and the kids loved it and so did the teachers.  Thank you for introducing us to Joaquin as he came to Amarillo later this year and we got to meet him.
This is a nice safe product for junior high kids!",1243728000,10,397,3.876543209876543
