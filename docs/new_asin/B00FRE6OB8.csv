6027654,5,B00FRE6OB8,"A surprisingly well done hour long show about Corrie Ten Boom, the Ten Boom family and their faith. The story is set in WWII era Holland, as well as how Corrie moved past that to do God's work elsewhere in the world. I am happy to have invested an hour watching this. I learned more about WWII as well as learning about the Ten Boom family.

I would suggest this to those I know.",1404000000,33,379,4.121621621621622

6027745,2,B00FRE6OB8,"I found the Dutch host of this documentary annoying, not least because of his over-the-top, often jarring and out-of-the-blue acting, AND the fact that he consistently mispronounces the family name in order to make it more palatable to English speakers (in Dutch, it's pronounced BOHM, not BOOM).

But the real nail in the coffin of this film is that it is set up as a Christian witnessing document. No doubt the members of the Ten Boom family were indeed sustained and inspired by their Christian faith, but the relentless emphasis on their religious righteousness made me want to hit the stop button. Not a minute passes without the film makers exalting the Bible, Jesus, church services, prayer, etc. It starts to get prideful and crass after a while.

Corrie ten Boom's own insistence that it was God's providence that saved her and her Jewish charges is problematic when you realize that six million other Jews perished at the hands of the Herrenvolk. Where was God's providence those six million times? God also didn't save the patriarch of the Ten Boom family, who, for his bravery, deserves as much praise (if not more so) as Corrie herself; he died in a German prison.

I gave up two-thirds of the way in.",1484611200,,1214,4.771428571428571

I prayed near the end for God to use me to help others, as all Christians do everyday or almost everyday yet it had been a few months for me. My favorite part was when her sister's faith grew after being beaten nearly to death in Ravensbrook Concentration Camp. In our weakness He is strong. When we are filled with the Holy Spirit, and forget ourselves He brings us such amazing joy.

6027768,3,B00FRE6OB8,"I could not force myself to view through to the end. This Dutch documentary was a mosaic abstracted from the World War II lives in Holland of Ms. ten Boom and others.  While it mentions acts of treachery of fellow Hollanders, it elides over the fact that the vast majority were co-conspirators with their Nazi occupiers, betraying ten Boom, her family and others, eventually sending them to the Nazi death camps from which ten Boom was the sole survivor of her family.

Of the 200,000 Hollanders who died during the war, about 110,000 were Jews, included among whom were those who had fled Germany and had re-established themselves in the Netherlands.  These figures are revealing, emblematic and unforgivable.

Nevertheless, Corrie ten Boom, ostensibly motivated by her Christian religious zeal, travels to Germany following the war to minister to the very far from hapless and deserving Germans who both wrought and supported the devastation and murder of millions brought upon Holland and all of Europe in their name by their Nazi regime.

The Germans were not mere ""victims"" during the Nazi era - there were participants and co-conspirators - with only a minuscule fraction having been brought to justice for their reprehensible crimes against humanity, with nearly all having been reintegrated, humbled but unrepentant, into post-war German society.

Ten Boom's ""faith"" in just what was ""undefeated""?  This is at best hinted at - is it Christian ""hate the sin but forgive the sinner""?

Some ""sins"" are far too egregious, premeditated and calculated to be forgiven.",1481068800,,1569,5.149606299212598
6027769,5,B00FRE6OB8,"Magnificently done. Corrie Ten Boom and her family heroically and unselfishly put their lives on the line to help the persecuted, and they suffered greatly.

6027783,4,B00FRE6OB8,"This documentary drama following the life of Corrie ten Boom was enlightening. The several books I had already read of her history did not inform nor impress me nearly as much as this film. The insertion of living characters who knew her made one feel close to the truth of her story. Since these people were not introduced by any narration, it was a little confusing in part. But this added to the ""you are there"" intimacy. Understatement only made more real the horrors of Nazi cruelty. It also showed the immense faith and gentle strength of Corrie  her family and her "" houseguests"", I came away feeling that I had met these people. Their fear was pitiful and matched by their astounding courage. I believe this is an important film to experience.",1476144000,5,751,4.646616541353383

Her story is inspiring, and she was such a good example of a humble servant of Jesus.  This is a very well made documentary that includes views of the house where she and her family hid Jewish citizens when the Nazis occupied Holland during WWII.  (You may recall the film, ""The Hiding Place"", which is a dramatic portrayal of this part of her life.)  The dramatic events that followed are all recounted, some with scenes reenacted.  Throughout, excerpts of her life story are retold by her personal assistant, and that was so interesting.

I recommend watching this program because it IS so very inspiring...not only how she lived for Christ, but how God worked in the midst of her circumstances.  The program, as Corrie's life, will point the viewer to Him and His great Son.  We enjoyed it immensely!",1472428800,,911,4.65

6027897,4,B00FRE6OB8,"I read Corrie's story many years ago. I remember seeing the Hiding Place when I was in Jr. HS and was so horrified by it because I didn't know people could be so evil. Later in my 40s, I developed a reading interest in the different wars. That's when I read the horrific stories of what happened to the Jewish people. Again, it was so unimaginable but I  understood the importance of everyone knowing what really happened. Best part of all this were the stories of survival, forgiveness and healing.

Having just finished reading her book, The Hiding Place, this title caught my attention. Our family wanted to see pictures of Corrie and see what her house was like. We saw pictures, and video of her home. We heard audio clips and saw photos of Corrie's public speaking. It was a great way to finish up our study on her life.

This sucked and I think it is disrespectful to have Christian people talking about how much God loves them when Nazi imprisonment had NOTHING to do with then. As a Jew I like to learn about my heritage. I don't care about Christians and there high and mighty pedestals, Christian Germans were the ones killing the Jews and now I have to listen to how much they love GOD? Guess what GOD will not forgive you people and you will never make up for what you did. The families you destroyed and the torture of over 2 million people. No, Christian God has no place in these documentaries none at all.

6027980,5,B00FRE6OB8,"Ever since reading Corrie ten Boom's book, ""The Hiding Place"", I have been an admirer of the ten Boom family for their work with the resistance during World War 2. So, I was interested in seeing this documentary about Corrie ten Boom, the only one of her immediate family to have survived the war. I was not disappointed. This is a fascinating look at her life, her family, her work, and her faith. It is wonderfully narrated and many personal photos, archival film footage, and even clips of Corrie ten Boom speaking are seamlessly interspersed throughout.

While there is a certain amount of Corrie ten Boom's Christian ideology included in the documentary, that is to be expected, as that is what made her who she was and that is what sustained her during her darkest hours. It is also what motivated her to help countless others not of her faith at great cost to herself and her loved ones. I, myself, am not a religious person, but I have nothing but respect for someone who holds such deep rooted beliefs and then  translates those beliefs in such a positive way. This documentary certainly shows that good can triumph over evil.

Those who read ""The Hiding Place""  and/or saw the film of the same name  and fell in love with the ten Boom family will certainly relish this documentary, as it lovingly  takes the viewer  through her life, the family home where the real ""hiding place"" was, and the beliefs that made her a beacon of light to those whom she helped in their hour of greatest need. This is a wonderful documentary and fitting tribute to a woman and family whose goodness is simply transcendent.",1453939200,22,1612,4.635087719298245

Touching and engaging, the film captures the devastating struggles Corrie Ten Boom faced as Nazi Germany invaded her homeland, Holland, and how her faith in the Lord Jesus Christ caused her to not only have hope, but to prosper in serving Him all of her days. Despite her suffering, Corrie clung to God's Word and His sovereign care. Her story is worthy to be heard as an encouragement to all Christians to persevere and learn forgiveness, as well as a call to all people to repent and trust in Christ for salvation.",1449187200,2,669,4.775862068965517

They held bible studies in their barracks and often passed scriptures among each other in other barracks or even camps and hide them in their heel of their shoes and any else where it is hidden as possible from the SS.  They needed their spiritual food to keep going.  They wore purple triangles. Who is the bravest? those who refused to salute the flag of the Third Reich, not what you were born with a Jewish heritage, handicapped, homosexuality and were gypsies.  The Jehovah Witnesses were also given a chance to abandon their faith by signing papers but did not, they love their Father in Heaven that much.  Corrie Ten Boom was brave to hide the Jews in her home as many did.  But let us not forget the Jehovah Witnesses who often have doors slammed on their faces or were butts of jokes.  Let's not forget them.  Please, thank you.",1428710400,2,912,4.58641975308642

6028145,5,B00FRE6OB8,"This is the true story of a Christian Dutch woman who lived through the Holocaust in Nazi Germany. Her prevailing endurance provides an example of the practical application of faith. She did not turn away from her fellow prisoners, but provided healing for their broken hearts; she is well acquainted with the trauma of PTSD.
Corrie experienced the physical, mental and spiritual trauma of the Holocaust and experienced the challenges that accompany surviving such an ordeal. However, she was able to overcome by her effective relationship with God and her service to those who were touched by the trauma.
She was wise enough to realize that those who ran the concentration camps were scarred almost as much as the prisoners. They needed healing as well. So, Corrie served these people, loving the unlovable. Her life serves as an example of what faith really is (it is not a belief system).
I recommend this video to anyone who has difficulty with forgiveness, moving beyond trauma, or growing out of victim-hood.",1426032000,7,1014,5.005917159763314

I remember reading the hiding place when I was a kid around age 13 and thinking what great faith and hope Corrie had. Little did I know what my own life held however the last bit mentioned by Corrie herself struck a chord within my own soul when she said:

Pray for yourselves and for other Christians. Where there is no vision the people perish. And we all know that we live in a time now that there is a great darkness and fog over the whole world. The great joy is when we have the Word of God, we can see things as it were from God's point of view. Look around and be distressed. Look within and be depressed. Look to Jesus...and be at rest. -Voice Recording of Corrie Ten Boom

6028212,5,B00FRE6OB8,"This is a great way to spend an hour of your life.  For those who have watched ""The Hiding Place"", this adds some information that was not included in that film. One is a diagram showing the layout of the joined homes the Ten Boom family owned. The narrators give the story a human touch without being overly dramatic or preachy.
Whether struggling or victorious in your life, this movie will greatly bless you.  The simple Christian humility & lives of the Ten Boom family's example is both sobering and moving.  It is such a testimony to: 1. God's ability to shine through suffering & 2. How to use what you find in your hand to serve God.  There is much self-glorification in Christianity today & prideful posturing even in those who claim to know God the most.  This film stands as a challenge to us all.

Very inspirational. They helped so many people throughout their lives, and risked their lives to help Jewish people escape the Nazi regime. Also, Corrie was able to forgive those who betrayed and abused her family.

6028229,5,B00FRE6OB8,"Corrie ten Boom: A Faith Undefeated ...Pam Rosewell Moore -- This documentary on Corrie ten Boom is an excellent glimpse into her life and the example she set for all of us to stand up for those who cannot defend themselves. It was filmed several years ago, so it does not have the flair of the current, but the content is excellent. I say glimpse, because no one can ever understand the experience of a Holocaust Survivor or those that tried to defend them.  The horror is too great. However, we MUST NEVER ever let this happen again. We can vehemently disagree on political, social, and religious issues, but we must never determine or allow that we have the right to execute an entire people with whom we have differences or for whom we have little value. That last phrase is a clue, if you feel that way, to reconsider human worth.  Please watch this movie if you want to know more in a very personal experience kind of way about the Holocaust and the thinking of the people in the neighborhoods (like you and me) during the 1930's and 1940's. Watch, also, if you want to be inspired to step outside of yourself and see what one person can do, one day at a time. Praise the God of Corrie's faith for His faithfulness, provision, and empowerment for her...and maybe, you, too.",1407024000,15,1279,4.484978540772532
