8764168,5,B01GWDI2GM,"Charles Bronson plays a police lieutenant who goes around the law to apprehend a murderer of women in this R rated film, which is filled with suspense. we know who the killer is because we see him commit murders. Bronson suspects him but is unable at first to prove he has no alibi because the killer cleverly adopted one, and then went out and killed a girl who insulted him. Bronson notes that the killer does so with a knife, which he interprets as the killer's penis. We see support for Bronson's theory because the killer always kills when he is naked. It is interesting to watch how Bronson develops his case. Among much else, the killer goes after Bronson's daughter to kill her and Bronson plants incriminating evidence on the Killer's clothes.",1497571200,,752,4.661654135338346
