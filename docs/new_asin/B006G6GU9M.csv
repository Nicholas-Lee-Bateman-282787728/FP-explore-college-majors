Kellan Lutz, Gabrielle Anwar and Ashley Greene are just pluses to this story....I cried thru some of this story because it is such a heart raunching story, especially the part where the father dies.. But it is such an awesome story and acting that I want to watch this movie over an over again, it worth buying and watching",1324166400,6,648,4.408333333333333
4985740,1,B006G6GU9M,"I can usually find some good in any film. That being said, this was a HUGE waste of money and time. I was in the mood for a sweet/sentimental movie so I chose this one. What I got was an extremely boring, horribly acted, overly-priced made for t.v. movie. Please, please, please don't waste your time. I didn't even bother finishing it(that never happens to me).",1323734400,4,362,4.5

4985744,3,B006G6GU9M,It was a good story line. However it moved a little slow. We had watched crooked arrows (which is a phenomenal lacrosse movie for at least the 6th time ) and was looking for another lacrosse movie. That's how we came across this one.,1459123200,,233,4.318181818181818

4985751,3,B006G6GU9M,"In 2011s A Warriors Heart Lutz plays a skilled lacrosse player whos not much of a team-player. His family moves from California to the East Coast where he learns to deal with his hotheadedness. Ashley plays his girlfriend and Beach his Native mentor while Gabrielle Anwar and Chris Potter play his parents.

To be honest, I didn't know much about lacrosse until viewing this movie. Turns out it originated with the Iroquois, inhabiting what is now New York, Pennsylvania, and other parts of the NE America. In some aboriginal traditions the games lasted all day for 2-3 days straight and were played as part of ceremonial ritual, a kind of symbolic warfare, to give thanks to the Creator or Master.

This was a small production, only costing $2.5 million, but its generally well made with a likable cast and quality soundtrack. Some people have criticized it as predictable, but this is only true in the sense of the sports film maverick who must be broken in order to be a team-player, which ultimately ushers in victory. Beyond this, I wasn't able to predict where the story was going, like a certain persons sudden meltdown and the arduous wilderness lacrosse camp.

The cast is great, but it felt like the story needed something more to hook the viewer, such as edgier drama or deeper subtext, but something. Another flaw is the final game where its clear there aren't that many people in the audience (or maybe lacrosse doesnt draw that many spectators, but this was a NATIONAL championship). Another glaring flaw is that the wilderness camp is supposed to be in the Northeast when its clear that its Southern California. A superior sports movie of this low-budget sort is 2010s Cutback (see my review). Nevertheless, A Warriors Heart is a must for fans of lacrosse or sports movies in general, not to mention fans of Lutz, Greene and Beach.

The movie runs 86 minutes and was shot in Santa Clarita (College of the Canyons) and Pasadena, California.

has ended, you realize that it concerns the old Oedipus problem, how to reconcile a boy aith his father.  bUt the setting is sarong.  Does the  Maine Corps have a high school for iys members' children. on both set and Eastcoasts ?  Are they run by the ora?  This is news to me,  or phantasy ? ? ?

4985780,4,B006G6GU9M,"Watched this with my 10 and 9 year old boys.  The message of the movie is great, it is clean, and the length of the movie was just long enough to keep their attention.  It is a bit cheesy and choppy in some parts, but overall a feel good movie.",1399852800,,244,3.86
4985781,2,B006G6GU9M,"I was unmoved by this film for a number of reasons:
1.  The story structure was defective.  Many scenes were bland and pointless, adding little or nothing to the story.
2.  The protagonist didn't have much at stake.  His goal may have been to play lacrosse for the Naval Academy, but what would have happened if he failed to attain his goal?  Not much, apparently.
3.  I thought the characters lacked depth, reflected in the failure of the actors to portray deep emotions anywhere in the story.  Only when Connor lost his temper on the lacrosse field did I find the acting convincing.",1399248000,,584,4.611650485436893
4985782,2,B006G6GU9M,This movie was hardly worth sitting through. It had a good premise. But it was filled with a lot of nonsense especially in the middle of the movie. Kellan Lutz is definitely too old to be a teenager in this movie. But it did have a message. Too bad you have to sit through the whole movie to get the message. This movie is definitely for college age folks and younger.,1398988800,,368,4.197183098591549
4985783,5,B006G6GU9M,"One of the best movies I've seen, very compelling, highly recommend it to kids and parents alike, nice message too",1398729600,,114,4.75

4985785,1,B006G6GU9M,"I cannot even begin to describe how horrible this movie is. Let me begin.

1) A Marine...a MARINE dies in Iraq because he is TEXTING during a shootout?? Are you kidding?? That is entirely impossible and the stupidest thing ever...and he is a good ""warrior""? Please.

2) Everyone (including the female lead) is way too harsh on Connor. It is disgusting and I am actually really angry about it. This kid is in high school and his absent father just died. Very disturbing how people are treating him. Also, his counselor who is supposed to be helping him is an alcoholic. Also absolutely disgusted that he is so judgmental of Connor.

Just, bad. Wish I could go in there and try to help Connor myself. I'd do better than all of those selfish stupid people and I'd do it faster. Poor Connor. So bad.",1397779200,,795,4.506944444444445

4985789,3,B006G6GU9M,I really enjoyed this movie and the story of lacrosse.  I had no idea it was a native American game.,1393891200,,100,4.0
4985790,3,B006G6GU9M,It was entertaining and a nice way to pass a couple of hours. I enjoyed the narrative style of the story telling the most.,1393459200,,122,4.125
4985791,5,B006G6GU9M,A somewhat cheesy story is redeemed by the simplistic ideas presented and backed by historical viewpoints on respect and honor.,1393372800,,127,5.4
4985792,4,B006G6GU9M,"This was a very good movie with heart and a message. I rented it because of the actors in it and was very happy that I did. It is a story of taking what life gives you, especially when bad, and choosing to work hard to get past it and use it to make oneself better and not sink into despair.

If you like movies with heart and a good story, then this is for you. It is also a family movie and i would recommend it for boys, 9-13 to watch with parents, especially, with fathers.",1392768000,,477,3.917525773195876
4985793,5,B006G6GU9M,Great movie and a must see movie.  Sincere and meaningful  great for teens as well as for adults you will like it,1392595200,,113,4.090909090909091
4985794,3,B006G6GU9M,A little predictable but it was a good movie to watch on a rainy day. I'd suggest u grab some popcorn.,1391731200,,102,3.9047619047619047
4985795,5,B006G6GU9M,This is a really good movie that I had never heard of before I stumbled on it.  I cried and laughed before it was over...,1391644800,,121,3.84
4985796,5,B006G6GU9M,There is a job to do. Loosing your temper is a distraction that will keep you from reaching your goal. A warrior's heart is a heart is one that gets the job done. Stay focused. Keep moving toward your goal no matter how many times life knocks you down.,1391644800,,252,4.163265306122449

4985801,5,B006G6GU9M,this is a great movie i could watch this movie every day i really love it thank you so much,1380931200,,91,3.6
4985802,5,B006G6GU9M,I have to say that I did not think of Twilight as I was watching it. Ashley and Kellan can act and you don't even see them as Alice and Emmett. It was a cute movie with a great message. I went on a limb and got this because of Ashley and Kellan in it but it was a great buy and have seen this movie a few time since I bought it! It's a keeper!!,1380844800,,344,3.539473684210526
4985803,4,B006G6GU9M,Provided a good story about anger management.  Seemed a little long at times and was not familiar with the sport played.,1379462400,,120,4.714285714285714
4985804,5,B006G6GU9M,"This is a very nice family movie. I watched it on TV and then ordered it and gave it as a present to my son and his wife. It's time that movies get back to entertaining families and not the high speed chases, shoot em up, cursing, like so many movies are today.",1378857600,,261,3.943396226415094
4985805,4,B006G6GU9M,"It was nice to see Kellan handling others roles other than Emmett.  He portrayed the anguish of loosing his father well, and he grew as a person.  Ashley Green is more than the little pixie Alice and still her sensitive side shines through as well has her tough approach to life.  Because of Twilight I watched this and was equally entertained.",1377216000,,344,4.60655737704918
4985806,5,B006G6GU9M,This movie is very heart warming.  I really like Kellan Lutz and Ashley Greene since I am a fan of Twilight.  They have a good connection working together,1377043200,,154,4.464285714285714
4985807,5,B006G6GU9M,Excellent because it showed how a young man could work to overcome his anger issues and achieve his dreams in the sport he loved.  I bought it for my grandson who loves lacrosse and has also had issues similar to this young man.  It was inspirational and I wanted my grandson to see how dreams can be realized with hard work.,1376784000,,325,4.311475409836065
4985808,3,B006G6GU9M,"Unlike others who watched this movie purely because some Actress named Ashley Greene (who was terrible in this movie) was in it, I chose this movie because I love sports movies and a Lacrosse movie intrigued me. I can honestly say, the Lacrosse part of this movie was the best part, and the rest of this movie was a patchwork of things done well in other movies.  So, let me give you Check list of things in this movie you've elsewhere:

SPOILER ALERTS

MOVE TO A NEW SCHOOL: Chiefly The Karate Kid, but also found in about a dozen other teens flicks.
TEENAGER WITH ANGST: Too many to name.  Common plot device.
FATHER DYING:
UN-ACCEPPTING COACH
MR MIYAGI - This plot device has been so overused that it deserves it's own genre.  Actually, Micky from Rocky pre-dates The Karate Kid.
LIFE AS A HOUSE - We've see the whole ""make him work"" theme before, the whole tear it down thing lost me (as it lost Connor in the movie) and felt unsatisfied by the whole ""workcamp"" experience.
TEAM STRIKE FOR PLAYER - Seriously, this would work if it was Rudy, but the main character almost killed a another player, then trashes the trophy case.  All the sudden, because he spent a week at work camp, he's the team's favorite player???? What the?
FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS - They even had a character named ""Riggins"" lol...the music sounded the same too.  Plus real lacrosse footage spliced with actors.

All and all, it was a predictable movie, but the subject matter of Lacrosse was worth the view, because no one has ever done a Lacrosse movie before.  And if I see Adam Beach play another Native American Military guy in another movie I am personally going to call his agent and complain, poor guy. :)",1376697600,,1684,4.549668874172186
4985809,3,B006G6GU9M,This movie was made for those Twilight fans that just wanted to see the two vampire siblings do something else where they end up being love interests.  The girl is a decent actress and the guy is acceptable.  You know how everything will play out from the beginning and everything works out perfectly and easily at the end... fine when you just want to veg.  Not much romance and no real conflict between the two to make the movie engaging.,1376524800,,440,4.475
4985810,4,B006G6GU9M,"My kids and I watched this movie together.  Great story with good, clean, heartwarming motives behind it.  Acting so-so in some places",1374624000,,134,5.045454545454546
4985811,5,B006G6GU9M,This one will tug at your heart strings. Very touching and great movie. Has a great story line and like watching and learning more about the sport.,1374451200,,147,4.481481481481482
4985812,2,B006G6GU9M,"I'm a big fan of the ""Twilight"" movies and had seen the preview for this one featuring Ashley Greene and Kellan Lutz.  A movie about lacrosse also seemed unique to me, so I kept searching for it to buy--couldn't find it in a store.  Now I now why!  The writing for the film was particularly weak, and I also think that the first-time director didn't help matters (he reveals that in the ""Special Features"" section of the dvd.)  I'm glad that I paid under seven bucks for this one because that's about all it's worth.  Teenage girls are probably the only ones who'd like this.  I do, however, give it 5 stars for being a wholesome, family film with absolutely no smut or cursing.  I really don't think it's the actors' fault that this is a flop.",1374364800,,744,4.386861313868613
4985813,4,B006G6GU9M,"Pretty predictable story but it is entertaining. Dabs into a little history and significance of the sport which is nice. It and ""Broken Arrows"" are about the only halfway decent movies dealing with lacrosse.",1372377600,,207,5.117647058823529

4985816,5,B006G6GU9M,Great story would recommend to anyone ....Would rent it again .  Family movie night rental for sure.  Hope you enjoy it,1369872000,,119,4.619047619047619
4985817,3,B006G6GU9M,"You typical after school special movie of young love, loss and a lesson learned the hard way. I think it is a good movie for high school kids, not overtly sexy but Kellan Lutz is worth looking at and Ashley Greene is so cute too.",1369785600,,229,4.111111111111111
4985818,5,B006G6GU9M,this is totallyy brillant and i will watch it forever...you guys are the best ever people ever and i will never forget this,1368057600,,123,4.391304347826087
4985819,5,B006G6GU9M,"This was a good movie, dealt with lots of issues and watching this young man deal with crisis in life.  Worth watching the movie.",1367798400,,129,4.375

Our main character gets served a raw deal.  His father comes home from his tour in the military and moves the family across the country.  Our warrior was a star LaCrosse player on his former team, but now is bottom man and only gets a chance at the team because his father is a legacy.  His whole future is on the line, but his new teammates feel they earned their places on the team and are not willing to take a step back to give the new guy a chance.  Their futures are on the line, too.  Battles happen on and off the field - until a true warrior steps in and gives him a whole new outlook on the game.

4985843,4,B006G6GU9M,"A nice film that tells many stories, which all rely on courage, strength, self cultivation, self discipline and letting go of self indulgence. There are a lot of fluffy films set in schools, set in military schools, set in prep schools, but this film wants to navigate past most stereotypes to try to get to the core of how does a person in pain get in touch with their pain enough to grow. There are many key points made throughout in this film through the characters choices, and circumstances the characters are placed in. The film does not hammer the viewer over the heard with historical stereotypes, but tries to find a middle ground for personal growth of everyone concerned in the story. I would like to see more of Adam Beach's story, more of his character's background and strength full purpose in the telling of this story. I would like to see more history of lacrosse as sacred play for healing and character building. With all the points the story tellers wanted to touch on, and get across, they did a good job of not losing sight of one main story -which could have gotten splintered into quite a few stories.

4985853,4,B006G6GU9M,"A Warrior's Heart came up on my watch list on my Netflix account and I will admit that I was iffy on watching it mostly because it is a sports movie, something that I sometimes enjoy (Remember the Titans) but I do not always come to like them all.

Now I will go ahead and say early on this movie starts two Twilight Stars, not just one.  We have Kellan Lutz and Ashley Greene, two of my favorite actors in the Twilight Series.  Ashley Greene stars as Brooklyn the daughter of the Lacrosse coach at Conor Sullivan's new school he has transferred too.  Conor has a problem sharing the spotlight in a ""team"" sport and likes to be the one leading the plays.  But when his father is killed in action Conor takes to destruction to school property, getting himself arrested.

Taken to tear down a old building by one of his fathers old military buddies for his transgressions and to help him clean up his act, he ends up on the native reservation in their version of Juvenile Detention.  This is where Conor learns the true meaning of Lacrosse and the fact that it is the sport of a true warrior where the Native Americans are concerned.

This movie was great and it has some great moments by Lutz and Greene.  But lets not forget about the other actors who you see in this movie.  Chord Overstreet who you may know as ""Trouty Mouth"" on Glee is one of the Lacrosse players on Conor's team.  Gabrielle Anwar from Burn Notice plays Conor's mom.",1357344000,,1436,4.401515151515151

4985859,3,B006G6GU9M,"Loved the scenes sans the shirt... worth every other bland minute in my very humble opinion.

Look it takes a lot of work out of a multitude of people to make a movie, and a good bit of those folks have far better skills than I when it comes to acting, directing and photography - all I thought was fairly good. However, I felt the powerful overhang of morals almost more than a mere suggestion. And in my experience that smacks of subcontextual meaning that might not line up with how I feel.

You really want something to curl your toes? Go watch Irreversible, it's a Prime movie on Amazon right now... (or at least they were).

4985868,5,B006G6GU9M,"Even though Kellan plays the main character of the story, Ashley is the one narrating and it adds another layer to the story coming from her point of view.  I can honestly say I cried multiple times throughout.  Kellan is brilliant and proves he is leading man material. He takes you through the journey of becoming the man he is meant to be and you can't help but root for him.  When Kellan cries, it is so moving, you can feel his pain.  Even if his portrayal doesn't get you crying (and it should its that good) the music will.  The song selection is spot on and really lets you know what the producers want you to feel.  There is a great moment between Kellan and Ashley in a car that is just so moving, the connection between the two is magnetic.  When the two of them have a scene together the chemistry is powerful and translates on screen well.  While Kellan pulls off the more serious parts we still get to see his fun loving side and hear some great wise cracks that we are all used to.  Plus you do get to see him shirtless at some points which is never bad lol.  The ending was perfect and the last image was breath taking in my opinion. There are a few twists that I didn't see coming (I am pretty good at guessing twists) that gave more of a background to the story as a whole.  I guess what I am trying to say is if you are looking for a good heartfelt movie, or if you are just fan of Ashley or Kellan's, this is a must see.",1326240000,14,1440,4.088967971530249

What you don't see, what's impossible to know at first glance is everything else. At least everything that counts."" Conor Sullivan (Lutz) is the best Lacross player on his team.  The only problem is he is cocky and not a team player.  When his dad is transfered across the country Conor has to start all over to make the team and prove that he is a team player. This movie is not terrible, but very cheesy and extremely predictable.  Much like the recent faith-based movies all the problems in this movie seemed to be solved way to easy.  To me a movie without a real push back against the lead actor seems boring and too cookie cutter like.  While I can't really say anything bad about this movie because I did like it, I can't really say anything really good about it either because ten minutes in I could tell how it would end.  That makes a movie boring to me.  Overall, not a bad movie and if you like this kind of thing you will really enjoy it.  I give it a B-.",1324944000,15,1076,4.287128712871287
