7269167,5,B00YTSKLZ8,"You better watch this one if you plan to move to NY.  A shocking documentary, and it is all true.  Only an issue of SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN did the engineering side better by detailing how and why it happened, down to the circuit level.  Otherwise this doc is perfect.",1447459200,,264,4.458333333333333

7269173,2,B00YTSKLZ8,"Well things start off promisingly enough, with a lot of contemporary news footage and an obviously interesting premise. But about 20 minutes in, the main point of interest lies in watching the films producers do a dexterous (and unintentionally humorous), dance to absolve the looters of any and all blame for pretty-much anything. Not that most of us don't expect this kind of thing from PBS, but y'know...hope springs eternal.",1462665600,,428,5.128571428571429

7269176,2,B00YTSKLZ8,This was interesting until it began to get political and started pointing fingers at a government as scapegoat for all that went wrong. It would have been far more interesting if they'd concentrated on the engineering infrastructure that couldn't recover from a lightning strike during a heat wave. Too little was mentioned of the human interest stories that make this sort of documentary 'real'.,1462320000,,396,5.203125

7269183,3,B00YTSKLZ8,"I was wondering more about the earlier blackout.  I worked at the Federal Reserve bank and had I not rushed out, I would have been safe, they have their own power.

7269186,3,B00YTSKLZ8,Informative but not extremely so ! A droning on & on of the same subject matter which could have been more explanatory in nature. Go ahead and take a look for yourself......and have a flashlight handy......just in case !,1461024000,,220,4.666666666666667

7269192,5,B00YTSKLZ8,"I was a teenager in New York when this happened, and not only did I get to see it happen -- I was in the best place to see it happen. Times Square. My father and I were walking home from a free open-air concert at Lincoln Center. We had gone into the Barnes and Noble in Times Square to look around, and the lights went out. We emerged from the store to find someone had pulled the plug on Times Square, the only lights being car headlights and emergency lights. Store owners were rapidly closing up, and tourists were standing around, puzzled. My father strolled over to one family and said, ""We do this every 12 years for you guys...I told Con Edison I paid my bill."" Then we walked home.

This documentary brought the entire story back to life for me in three-quarter inch tape's harsh color, told virtually entirely by actual newscasts or testimony from people who endured the ordeal. Some were middle-class and upper-crust types, caught in the World Trade Center or ritzy neighborhoods, who turned the situation into a summer community party. Others were residents of the disintegrating communities in The Bronx and Bushwick, where looting and violence took over, who saw their homes and shops destroyed. The final voices were cops, firefighters, and a doctor who coped with the chaos.

Their stories, told without much embellishment or hyperbole, speak eloquently about New York's blackout night and the human experience of it. These stories are overlaid with video and commentary from historians and journalists about the issues of the time that were straining New York's life -- its budgetary bankruptcy, the intense heat, the divisions between rich and poor, the crumbling of its industrial base, the fear generated  by the ""Son of Sam"" serial killer. The documentary also touches on the roots of New York's decline, comparing the November 1965 blackout, which saw very little looting and crime, with the 1977 disaster, and shows how the city had changed in those 12 years.

The 1977 blackout was a permanent memory for anyone who lived through it, and an unpleasant one for people whose neighborhoods were burned through by looters. Parts of Bushwick and the South Bronx looked like downtown Berlin after the RAF's Bomber Command got through with it in 1945, for years. Only recently have those neighborhoods begun to emerge from the nightmare, as middle-class and working-class people displaced by Manhattan's insane rents refill those communities, seeking living space.

This documentary will have two primary audiences: people interested in urban public policy and its history, and people who lived through the blackout. both will find it riveting.",1460937600,,2661,4.997742663656885

7269196,4,B00YTSKLZ8,"Who knew?  In 1977, New York was without electricity for hours and hours.  Within ten minutes the looting began, while others were oblivious to the criminal activity and were enjoying candlelit sing-alongs.  A fascinating look on a New York I didn't realize existed.",1459209600,,266,5.1395348837209305
7269197,5,B00YTSKLZ8,Good film for an update on the blackout and the challenges that followed for years in the city of New York.,1459209600,,107,4.142857142857143

7269224,3,B00YTSKLZ8,"I watched this video because of Ted Koppel's latest book ""Lights Out: A Cyberattack, A Nation Unprepared, Surviving the Aftermath""  pub. 2015.... Mr. Koppel warned of what could happen and mentioned this movie and it does show what can happen to those that are living in America's cities.... the movie was Informative 3.5 stars",1457222400,,327,5.055555555555555
7269225,2,B00YTSKLZ8,"This infuriates me!  Why would you loot from your neighbors and burn down your own neighborhood.  This happens all the time.  If you are mad at rich people, that's where you should take out your frustrations,  Not on people who are giving you a store and more than likely, they are struggling too.  How can these people live with themselves and why in the world would you interview people who were making up excuses for thieves and arsonists!!!  Awful!",1456963200,4,452,4.658227848101266

7269229,3,B00YTSKLZ8,"It's a good little doc to show you about a super-strange event that happened in the US. It's also a very real sort of tactic that could be used by those who want to destroy our country/democracy: i.e., shut down the power to America's hugest cities. What would YOU do if this happened? (I'm at a modest advantage: I grew up in rural America and electrical storms would knock-out power on a fairly regular basis in the summertime.)",1456617600,,430,4.5256410256410255
