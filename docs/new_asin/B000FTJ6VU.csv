8126502,5,B000FTJ6VU,"I love Grand Designs and devoured the episodes we could find on streaming.  Ordered this from a UK vendor and scoured product description for info on region code.

Sure enough, my disks did not play on a U.S.-only DVD player.  Bought an Amazon all-region player and it worked fine.

If you only have a US player I would buy from prime only to guarantee a return.

I give GD a 5-star review!!! Be aware some disk sets require an all-region player.",1495324800,10,446,4.45679012345679
