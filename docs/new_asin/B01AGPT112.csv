7600007,5,B01AGPT112,"The dvd is great! I wish they would do more dvd's so we could finish the series? Tim sorry but most of us don't have region 2 DVD players, and 80 Dollars per. DVD. So we have to do the next best thing.",1384992000,,201,3.697674418604651
7600008,5,B01AGPT112,"This is a powerful, well-produced, and interesting series.  I highly recommend it.  The animation is top notch.  Suspense, action, romance--it has everything.",1375315200,,158,6.090909090909091
7600009,1,B01AGPT112,"This is most assuredly a pirated copy.  The real thing cannot be had for under $90 from US websites.  You can get the real thing from Amazon Japan for under $55 and even under $50 per Blu Ray.  If it's not a Blu Ray, and not in the official box, it's a pirate.  I've bought the real thing and it's 100% worth it.",1375056000,5,312,3.9047619047619047

7600012,5,B01AGPT112,Love this series as I grew up with the old one in the 80's.  Realy looking forward to getting the rest of the series!,1367539200,,117,3.875
7600013,5,B01AGPT112,"First of all I want to say that love this series and would love to see it come out in a box set release in America.

Second if anyone know why Yuki (Nova in American Starblazers version) had her name change to Mari instead of keeping her original Japanese name like the other characters please leave me a comment on it.

From 1973 classic to the 2010 live action movie to this 2012 re launch of the series it interesting how many ways they can tell the same story and still make it a bit different each time. The C.G.I space ship battles are fantastic and it wasn't until I saw all the women crew members in this remake that it dawn on me that Yuki was the only female crew member of the original series.  While some characters seem to have the classic large saucer anime eyes it seems that the series tried to go for a more realistic look for most of the characters. Probably because as their talks with those from the U.N. on the view screen would indicate whole Yamato crew is made up on Japanese instead of the best the world had to offer like the original series stated.

  From 1950s to the 1970s sci-fi film makers had their special view of what the future would be like with hover vechiles and such that was reflected in old series while the modern underground city is much more real right down to the subway car they ride from the surface or the troop transports that takes new Star Force to the Yamato. Even the uniforms have a more military and less coveralls look them in this new series. Mari, Akari and the other girls suits remind me of the plug suits from Evagalian series.  Speaking of suits interesting to see the crew put on cool designed space suits for the warp jumps which the original crew didn't seem to require. Even the flight suits worn in the jet fights and how the tiger squardron is swung out to the launch bay has change though neither for better or worst. Again just different as both old series and new are great.

If you prefer blu-ray Amazon Japan has the first three volumes on Region free with English subtitles taking one up to episode 10.  Course I don't know how much they cost in dollars since the site sells in Yen.",1365724800,2,2157,4.332506203473946
7600014,1,B01AGPT112,"Tim Eldred here, Space Battleship Yamato researcher. A friend just directed me to this product listing and asked if I thought it was a bootleg. My answer is ABSOLUTELY. The low price, absence of a manufacturer name, and lack of bonus features are a dead giveaway.

Yamato 2199 is high-profile enough that we would have all heard about a legit import by now. This can't be anything other than a rip from BR to DVD. Don't buy it, or you'll be participating in active sabotage.",1354320000,42,474,4.576470588235294
7600015,5,B01AGPT112,"I was a bit concerned that the $20.00 or so version was something different than the Blu-Ray versions and wouldn't be the same Yamato 2199 that I have seen youtube preview clips on.

It turns out that this version is a 2 disk DVD with episodes 1 and 2 on disk 1 and 3-6 ending with the battle between the crew of the Yamato and the Gamilon satellite reflex cannon base on Pluto.

It has no special features, booklets, posters or anything other than just the two disks, but if all you want is to watch the episodes, this is the version to get.

As a fan of the original ""Starblazers"" Anime that came to the US in the late 1970's and early 1980's (and on youtube), I really like this version. There have been some things that have changed for people who have seen the original series, but I believe that what the producers have done (like keeping the original music) is to remain true to the original spirit of the series while having the artwork reflect the technology and techniques available today. Some plot problems from the original series were fixed, but in a good way.

I can't wait to see the rest of the series and I hope that there will be more editions like this for those of us who cannot afford to spend the extra for the Blu-Ray and it's accompanying collector's items.",1352419200,6,1282,4.373949579831932
7600016,3,B01AGPT112,Movie came in with audio not in English. Returned for full refund. I appreciate all the help,1496966400,,92,4.470588235294118
7600017,5,B01AGPT112,"Shipped quick and fast, product is as advertised.  Thanks much!",1496620800,,63,5.3
7600018,5,B01AGPT112,"This is the DVD, which is priced decently. An update/remake of the first series, the Quest for Iscandar, this is basically the same story but with a few new characters, a bit of new technology and a change in a few of the original characters. Very enjoyable with only one or two clunky episodes. I loved the original, which I raced home from college to watch - Starblazers was for many of us the show that really showed what Anime could be like. This is just as enjoyable with even better animation.
Now here's the caveat. This also comes with Space Battleship Yamato: Revival. Basically it's nothing new. The Earth is menaced by a cascading Black Hole, which will swallow the entire system. Commander Yuki Mori, leading a fleet of emigrant ships is killed early on - and unlike in the past - remains dead. Kodai is a freighter captain who comes back to command the new Yamato with a brash young crew. This is partially a remake of the third season of the original show, the Bolar Wars. While attempting to evacuate earth, the Interstellar Alliance destroys the first and second fleets, until Yamato arrives with the Third. Basically there are a lot of story lapses and the movie just ends. But the two discs of the series, are superb.",1496016000,5,1235,4.592760180995475

7600023,5,B01AGPT112,Amazing value compared to the blue ray disks for upward of $70 each.  Same content on 2 dvds plus a bonus movie (not the live action one).  Seems to follow the original storyline from the 70''s pretty precisely.  I can't wait to watch it all and relive what until now was too cost prohibitive to relive!,1487635200,,303,4.375

7600027,5,B01AGPT112,"WOW. SBY is great. Great story. Great art work. This is a wonderful updated version of the 1970's classic. I loved this movie and the Kids loved it too. It helps you learn Japanese (Has good English Sub-Titles, plus several other sub-titles) and it truly a great glimpse into modern Japanese culture and thinking.  Recommended. Good if you like Anime, space cartoons, Japanese sub-culture, or want to improve your Japanese.",1484438400,3,423,5.042857142857143
7600028,4,B01AGPT112,"Couple things to note here. This set has 3 DVDs in it. Two for the Yamato 2199 Series in 2012 and One for the Movie, ""Yamato: Resurrection"", which is actually from 2009 and completely unrelated to the 2199 series, aside from the Space Battleship Yamato property itself. If you haven't seen the 2199 series, and are a Yamato (or Star Blazers) fan, you are really missing out. It's amazing. I do wish that the movie included here was at least the ""Voyage to Remember"" compilation film for the 2199 series, or better yet, the ""Odyssey of the Celestial Ark"" movie, set between episodes 24 and 25 (I believe). However, the movie included her is not either of them, and so I'll have to purchase Celestial Ark separately. Still, the entire series of 2199 for $30 is fantastic.",1483660800,4,769,4.62043795620438
7600029,5,B01AGPT112,"I wasn't sure about ordering this. I had seen the branded individual disks from voyager at $45 a pop and thought what's the catch? why is this so cheap? So far none. I have only watched one eppisode but if they all transferred like this, then they are perfectly fine. I watched it on a sony bluray player with no encoding issues. Also the package arived way earlier than expected. Count on me to look this company up again so I don't pay the over inflated price.",1481241600,12,462,4.32183908045977

7600031,5,B01AGPT112,Great movie. This is a new way of telling the story. It's not like the original but it's still a great movie just a different version. Can't wait to hear it in English instead of reading it if that ever happens,1474588800,,210,4.146341463414634

8747295,5,B01AGPT112,"This series is amazing.  They took everything that worked in the original and kept it.  The producers then changed what needed to change to modernize the series.  Overall an incredible job.

Only complaint is that the movie really sucks.  So if you buy this open the case and just throw that away.  It's not worth the electricity it'll take to run your DVD player to watch.

But the series is wonderful.",1520899200,,403,4.591549295774648
