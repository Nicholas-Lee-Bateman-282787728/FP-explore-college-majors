8053620,4,B0007XPV4A,"Pushover (1954) is a solid film noir that starts out a bit slow but then gets steam, and how fun it is.

Philip Carey, Fred MacMurray, and Kim Novak all give credible leads here.  Fred MacMurray is a cop who turns bad because of Kim Novak's beauty.  He whacks a bank robber for the loot and betrays and whacks fellow cop Paddy Dolan.

Nice flick.",1441756800,,346,4.276923076923077

8053622,4,B0007XPV4A,"Okay, once again, here is the drill, the crime noir drill anyway, crime does not pay. Got it. Ya, but what they didn't  tell you, not that it would have helped, what about when some stray femme fatale, all blond and curvy, not Marilyn Monroe blond and curvy but still a nice package, comes at a guy with her one hundred dollar an ounce perfume scent, in 1950s dollars scent, and her come hither smile. And gets a guy, guys, usually rationale and business-like stick-em-up bank robber guys or guardian of law-and-order guys, kind of screwy and dreaming funny dreams. And have , in the end, the latter doing screwy stuff with enough moxie to face the chair, or face  a stray bullet or two, with kind of an ironic smile just for another whiff of that expensive perfume. Ya, they don't tell you about that part.  But I will, because in that just mentioned end, the film under review, Pushover, is all about that crazy stuff a good-looking dame can make a guy, maybe any guy, do. And even Karl Marx, and his kindred, haven't figured a way around that one.

I might as well start at the beginning. Harry, like a lot of guys, didn't like nine-to- five work, although such guys, like the rest of us, needed dough for this and that, so he did what came natural to such guys-rob a bank (with a confederate of course). He got the dough okay, a couple of hundred thousand (not much today but serious money in the 1950s, serious easy street money until it ran out and you needed to plan another caper), but the heist got fouled up, as usual, when some bank guard (seemingly unaware that the bank was probably insured and, in any case, that it wasn't his dough) decided to play hero. Harry threw a couple of bullets his way and that was that.

Except in 1950s law and order America, and now too, killing bank guards sets the citizenry aflame and so the cops have to press hard on this one to stop the bad press. And here is where the fatal perfume scent comes in. See, Harry, like many a  guy has a woman, a  ""kept"" woman in the parlance of the day, Nora (played by Kim Novak),  who he keeps coming back to for one more whiff of that scent that he has paid for. (And other stuff too but remember this is a 1950s movie so we won't mention s-x.) And that is where the law gets a break. Somehow they find out about Nora and have her followed. Why? You know why just as well as you know the cat will go after catnip.

Nora is followed by a kind of cynical, hard-bitten, seen it all career cop, Paul (played by Fred MacMurray), whose ""job"" is to get close to her. Well he does, but he doesn't figure on that scent. The scent that will lead him, and gladly, down a crooked road.  See Nora had her own agenda.
Her own agenda being to get Harry's dough and run off, maybe to Mexico, where the living is cheap and nobody, nobody with any sense, asks questions. But in any case somewhere far away, some white picket fence cottage for two far away. Paul resisted the idea for a while but you know it would be a very short film if he didn't succumb. And if you saw Nora, and the whole package, you would know why too.

Of course the best laid plans of mice or men go awry, real awry. The plan is to set up Harry, bump him off under the usual ""trying to escape"" police gag, grab the dough and scram to that little dream cottage future. No problem, easy as pie, just like clockwork and all the other clichs. Not. The thing unravels by the minute and every improvisation by Paul only gets turned around against him. As his fellow cops finally get around to figuring out he has gone ""rogue"" he has gotten into such frenzy about the dough that he kind of fatalistically pushes on. And in the end takes those stray cop bullets that have his name on them kind of smiling, an ironic smile. See what a dame will do to a guy, a rationale guy. But what are you going to do.

Note: Fred MacMurray should have seen this coming. It is not like he hasn't been down that blond femme fatale road before. He took a couple of stray bullets for a smile from Barbara Stanwyck in Double Indemnity so he was forewarned. He had better stay away from those blonde dames with big crooked plans. I suggest a brunette.",1330819200,,4164,4.25031605562579
8053623,4,B0007XPV4A,"""Pushover"" is an example of a middle-of-the-road film noir well into the 1950s: not as interesting as a comparable film would have been in the 1940s but reflecting rapidly changing post-War ideals. Police detective Paul Sheridan (Fred MacMurray) is asked to get close enough to the young beauty Leona McLane (Kim Novak) to discover if she is really the mistress of bank robber Harry Wheeler (Paul Richards). When Paul is certain, he and partner Rick McAllister (Phil Carey) stake out her apartment. But Leona has figured out that Paul is a cop, and the prospect of this alluring blond and her boyfriend's stolen $200,000 prove too tempting for Paul. He concocts a plan to get the woman and the loot, which, predictably, turns out not to be as slick as he hoped.

Leona is exemplary of a 1950s femme fatale: kittenish, brainless, helpless, and devious almost in spite of herself. She's not the single-minded master manipulator of the 1940s. Kim Novak fills the bill but seems to do little else than give come-hither looks until late in the film. Paul is an older man, determined to get that money more out of boredom than ambition for high living. ""Pushover"" would be a run-of-the-mill example of film noir late in the cycle, as classic crime films were withering under pressure from television, color, and post-War ideals, if it were not for its heavy dose of voyeurism. We spend a large part of this film watching people watch other people. Paul and Rick are not just surveilling Leona's apartment but spying on every young woman in the building, setting up an odd power dynamic.",1279065600,,1580,4.8088235294117645
8053624,4,B0007XPV4A,"Really taut little thriller, with enough cat and mouse to satisfy fans of  the old Tom and Jerry. Fred Mac Murray's cop starts out as a professional but ends up in a vortex of crime thanks to the compelling allure of the shapely Miss Novak. Good thing she's called on to do little more than stand around looking sexy, because her bad, breathy imitation of Marilyn M. in the opening garage scene had me reaching for the off button. I gather Columbia (read Harry Cohn) had high hopes of launching Novak's career with this role. Too bad she had to compete with a hundred other bosomy blonde Marilyn's for the honor. I like the seduction scene with its subtly unzipped zipper, about as far as the screen could go at that time. The plot wrinkles get pretty complicated at times, but the pace keeps moving nicely along. Then too, the final line presents a cleverly  poignant slice of insight. There's the inevitable comparison with the thematically similar Double Idemnity, but then Novak is no Stanwyck and MacMurray is a ten dissapated years older. Still, this little suspenser needs no help from the past and can stand firmly on its own.",1184457600,,1134,4.665
