2591929,4,B000FVQUNA,"This may not be the most overwhelming performance but I like it.  It's overall a straight forward production -- no ""what does that mean"" ideas.  Hofmann is much better here than in the Met DVD with Eva Marton.  I'm curious though if anyone else thought that disc 2 (with Act 3) seemed VERY slightly out of sync -- picture and audio.  I just didn't feel right and after watching it very closely, I think that is the problem.  This would definitely be my 1st choice of the 3 currently available.  However, I will be interested in seeing the version from Baden-Baden that is due to be released by Opus Arte with Kent Nagano conducting.",1155513600,23,632,4.5
2591940,4,B000FVQUNA,"Wagner - Lohengrin / Peter Hofmann, Karan Armstrong, Bernd Weikl, Elizabeth Connell, Leif Roar, Woldemar Nelsson, Bayreuth Opera is a recording under the direction of Woldemar Nelson who leads Orchester Der Bayreuter Festspiele on this CBS Records Inc record from 1982. The choir is lead by Norbert Balatsch. I find the pace of the music to be a bit fast and I would like a very controlled pace. We get a well written untitled short essay by Uwe Kraemer and translated into English by Michael Danner/Richard Hockaday. The lyrics are available in English, French and German. No photographs of the performers except one on the cover of the cd which is a bit blurry and out of focus. Still a fine enough recording that should please affecionados of Wagner. Recommended. 4/5.",1286496000,,771,4.893129770992366
2591941,3,B000FVQUNA,"Serviceable.  No Wager work is ever staged the way the artist originally intended.  I thought the DVD would be subtitled in English,  but it wasn't - which is a big disappointment.",1209945600,2,180,4.741935483870968
2591942,3,B000FVQUNA,"This is a fabulous production, great singers, fascinating visual effects, etc.  But I was so disappointed that both my disks (it is a 2-disk set) were printed somehow incorrectly so that the DVD fritzes out at the end, of both disks, on at least 4 different DVD players!  I am sure the disks are defective but I don't have the receipt so I can't return it.  I wonder if the Euroarts label is a cheap label?  I have other opera DVDs and no problems.  But with this Lohengrin set, BOTH disks behave badly in the same way!  Very sad!",1196812800,8,530,4.303030303030303
2591943,4,B000FVQUNA,"I had avoided this DVD since the CD version had never garnered very positive reviews especially when compared to Kempe's and Keilbert's verions, both of which had been in my collection for many years in both LP and CD format.  Fortunately a friend of mine advised me that the DVD version was worth a look, definitely superior to the later version from the Met.  I knew Armstrong as a singer with a lovely lyric voice but her venues were restricted to Europe and a marriage to Friedrich, plus assumptions of roles I wondered about; in short another lyric who  longs to sing roles that make demands that the artist is unable to deliver.  Hoffman certainly looked ""right"" for the role, and fortunately his voice was still an instrument of some beauty and ""right"" for the role in a way that Domingo's could never be.

As a production it is very conservative even if it is not set on the river bank. There is no swan, but costumes are appropriately period and Hoffman looks like the knight he is supposed to be.  After hearing Vogt, he sounds overly stentorian but is capable of giving a nuanced performance. He lacks the ultimate sweetness of tone and too often he fails to sing softly, but he is one of the better Lohengrin if in the main beause he looks the role.  Armstrong suffers from the same problems of Kringleborn.  When any pressure is applied to the voice the tone becomes splayed and ugly.  Fortunately the role doen't required spinto tones too often, but in concerted numbers she is unable to sing the music with real beauty of tone.  Studer alone (in DVD format) has the requisite power, but alas her DVD has been deleted from the catalogue and is currently unavailable.  The male contingent of the DVD under consideration is superb.  Bernd Weikl's Herald is luxury casting and Leif Roar is a very good Telramund.  Connell's Ortrud would suffer comparison to Varnay and Ludwig, and on DVD to Meier, but she sings the role beautifully lacking only the malevolence inherent in the character.

As with most Bayreuth performances the orchestra and chorus are first rate. I would recommend this performance over the Met's which suffers from the casting of Marton as Elsa and later Hoffman, a performance that suffers when compared to his earlier Bayreuth performance. The Vogt performance (I refer to the production) may be too radical for some, but the bel canto singing of Vogt surely compensates for any supposed shortcomings.",1195603200,12,2434,4.764285714285714
2591944,5,B000FVQUNA,"I recommend this DVD.  I've heard and liked the music from Lohengrin for decades.  I knew the story etc, but didn't understand how specific songs fit in the opera's action.  I finally decided to get the opera on DVD so that I could understand how it all fit together, and so I could sit back and enjoy the entire show.  I purchased this specific version of Lohengrin because reviews on Amazon recommended it - those reviews were correct, this DVD is great.  One surprising break for me, there are sub-titles in English, German, French, and Spanish so that I could easily follow what was going on and associate specific songs and music with action in the opera - there's no need to understand sung German, or even German, to sort out what's going on.  Now, finally, I can tie specific music and songs to the action in the opera, and I've got a great opera in my DVD collection that I can watch and listen to again and again.

Wagner's music is fantastic, of course, but the staging, acting, and singing were great as well.  There's nothing second class about this DVD, it's the real deal.  You'll watch it again and again.  The music and imagery will echo in your memory the rest of your days, seriously.

I did have a few surprises.  There is no explicit swan in the production - for those of you who haven't seen Lohengrin it turns out the swan is of some interest.  Lohengrin arrives and departs from shadows and in darkness - too bad, both seemed like an opportunity for a grand entrance and departure.  His entrance, as I recall, was at high-noon, when you'd expect a lighted entry.  King Heinrich's apparel could have been more regal- perhaps a few self awarded medals.  All of the above are zits, don't worry about them; the singing, acting, music, and staging are absolutely world class.  Fantastic singers, great acting, great orchestration and staging.  Go for it, you'll love it.

Look at it this way, you can spend $30 for 2 country/western CDs where you listen to some guy moaning about his truck breaking down in the barroom parking lot, or you can spend less than $30 for a 2 DVD set that will let you watch and listen to some of the best music in the world, sung by some of the best singers in the world, supported by a world class orchestra, well acted and well staged.  Why are you waiting?  This is a great deal.  Ten years from now you won't remember a bit about  the guys truck, but the music and imagery from Wagner's Lohengrin will still be echoing in your memory.  Buy this DVD, watch and listen to the opera.  You're gonna love it, trust me.",1187740800,21,2565,4.464516129032258
2591945,4,B000FVQUNA,"My perfect-pitch ears tend to be angered a lot when listening to any performance, particularly opera. During this entire performance though, I was stunned and at ease for all of it. The choir was also very rich, something difficult to pick up in a non-studio recording such as this.

Even the minor roles were spot-on their notes. Just the right amount of virbrato, and beautiful tones from all of the performers. The main roles could not have been better. Hofmann and Armstrong were a wonderful pair on the screen.

The orchestra was also beautiful. Very rich, full, and for the most part dead on their notes as well. In my opinion Wagner's best orchestration to match the mood of the people on stage. In the third act though, it sounded as if the brass section was falling apart, especially toward the end. Perhaps they fell from fatigue? Well, it did not ruin it for me, and I highly doubt it would for anyone else.

The sets were very basic, something I don't mind, but what did annoy me was how confusing they were. The swan was instead a faintly glowing white disc in the background. I had no idea what that was supposed to be until they kept shouting, ""The swan! The swan!"" In other cases, you had no idea where the characters were in general. I'd have to read the program notes to see what was happening.

Aside from the confusing sets, it was a very enjoyable show that I will watch again and again. I would say this is a great choice for any Wagner fans wanting to see a performance of this. This particular performance had no audience, though it was performed in the same manner in front of one with this cast and orchestra.",1184630400,6,1635,4.476510067114094
2591946,5,B000FVQUNA,"This was the first time I watched a Wagner opera. I have been listening to the music for years, but I felt I was missing out by not actually seeing a performance. I have yet to be able to see a live performance, so I ordered this DVD. Now I know why Wagner is so loved. The seriousness and drama of the performance was unlike anything I had ever seen. The singing boggles my mind, and the music is simply beautiful. I know very little about opera, but I know this: this breathtaking.

Our uncivilized culture is unaware of the true beauty German culture is capable of. Yes, Beethoven and Bach are wonderful, but Wagner is totally unique. Peter Hoffman, who plays Lohengrin, is the quintessential Germanic man - blonde, strong, stolid, and honorable. His performance was excellent. The woman who played Elsa was too old, but her voice is awesome. I have always wanted to go to the Bayreuth Festival, and I will. Wathcing this performance made me feel as if I was there. I highly recommend this.",1176163200,8,993,4.5474860335195535
2591947,5,B000FVQUNA,"When one of my friends suggested me to introduce into the Wagner world (during the VHS good old times)through Lohengrin, he knew what he was advising a newcomer and he did it right! I just loved the music, nothing was better than that for me in that time (10 years ago or maybe more) and I loved Wagner's music, then was Tannhauser, Fliegende Hollander, The Ring (exciting Walkyrie), Tristan und Isolde, Meistersinger, Parsifal...and every discovery was a trip to excitement.

So this Baeyrouth version was my first Lohengrin, and it has remained unsurpassed. I've tried to follow other versions (now in DVD and CD), and I yet I have not been able to find another Elsa as MS Armstrong's and another Ortrud as MS Connell. They are credible, they are fabulous, their voice match their character and their wonderful lines. So I have to say to Mr Roar's Telramund and Mr Hoffman's Lohengrin, and of course, the chorus, masterful, brilliant, overwhelming. So, for someone who is hesitating which version to get, I would advise this one. A must in your collection.",1174694400,21,1058,4.845303867403315
2591948,5,B000FVQUNA,"I purchased this DVD after getting Nikolaus Lehnhoff's interpretation of the opera on Opus Arte and being somewhat disappointed with it. While the Opus Arte has its moments, the heart of the drama is here.  One is never in doubt that this Lohengrin loves his Elsa but their love is doomed (and he is cursed) by his need to keep his name unsaid. The magic associated with the fearful question, not an inability to communicate, is at issue and the drama of the opera is heightened considerably by the tension of their predicament. Singing and acting vary from very good to excellent. Orchestra and chorus are very fine. Sound and picture quality are excellent - and Act III was NOT out of sync on my copy. I agree with all the positive other reviews listed. This, indeed, is the preferred Lohengrin.",1172188800,8,797,4.652482269503546
2591949,5,B000FVQUNA,"This is the best Lohengrin available. The Bayreuth forces under the direction of Woldemar Nelsson are excellent. The Bayreuth chorus is splendid throughout, and Lohengrin is an opera where the chorus performance is vital. The orchestra plays superbly except, perhaps, in the Prelude of Act I, which sounds less opulent than oither performances because of the fast tempo adopted by Nelsson. Peter Hoffmann is  much better here than he was in the Metropolitan production. Karan Armstrong may have some vocal problems, mainly in the most dramatic moments of the opera, but her weaknesses convey the frailty of the character. In this aspect, she is a much more believable Elsa than Eva Marton, whose weighty voice does not suit the role. Leif Roar is a very good Telramund and so is Siegfried Vogel as the King. Elizabeth Connell is a surprise as Ortrud, both as a singer and as an actress. I did not expect so much from her in this role, but she is excellent. Of course, she cannot match the best Ortrud I have ever heard: Christa Ludwig in Rudolph Kempe's Lohengrin, available in CD (nor can Roar match the Telramund of Fischer-Dieskau for Kempe). But who can equal these two singers in these parts? Bernd Weikl is excellent in the small role of the Herald. Good image quality and superb sound. Highly recommended.",1167696000,33,1312,4.831111111111111
8127224,5,B000FVQUNA,"I am now the proud owner of two Bayreuth Lohengrins.  My enthusiasm for this production parallels my enthusiasm for the other, which I believe you can read on this  site.  The singing is magnificent and the scenery and all the production values contribute to the integrity of the whole and fidelity to Wagner.  Ludwig II would be in transports of ecstasy.",1464393600,,355,4.770491803278689
8127225,3,B000FVQUNA,"I prefer the Met performance. Peter Hofmann is wonderful in both performances. But Eva Marton is a better Elsa. She is wonderful. Karan Armstrong has a beautiful voice, but not for this role. She is good, but not great. Levine is a better conductor and the Met orchestra is a better orchestra than the BFO. And the Met production is better than the Bayreuth production. The Met wins hands down. Met=5 stars. Bayreuth=3 stars.",1449619200,,425,4.756756756756757

8127227,2,B000FVQUNA,"We live in a cinematic age and often viewers are mollified by the appearance of young and sexy singers even if they aren't very good singers.  This Lohengrin is a classic case in point.  Peter Hofmann looks incredible, just like the Knight in Shining Armor of every girl and boys dreams.  He even has on really tight white tights that shows that he 'dresses' to the left.  Sexy, right?
Of course, Hollywood learned that trick 100 years ago.  Too bad the guy can't sing for beans at this point in his career.  He's not exactly terrible or anything but he is definitely about the least vocally appealing Lohengrin I've ever heard, and I've heard a truck load of them.  Hofmann was having problems back in 1978 when he was recording Florestan in Fidelio with Solti in Chicago.  I know, I was there.  Solti was tearing what little hair he had out of his head after rehearsals, trying to teach poor Hofmann how to sing between rehearsals.  Peter Hofmann was a victim of the Vanity Trade in the entertainment industry.  He was very handsome and sexy and his voice was strong but not trained properly.  He was a rock musician before venturing into the Boulez Ring as Siegmund in 1976.  By the time this Lohengrin was produced he was already on the banana peel to vocal decimation.  But he eeks his way through it with his boyish sex appeal.

His beloved, Elsa, is even worse.  Karan Armstrong is without question the most poorly sung Elsa one could possibly imagine short of Susan Kane singing Salmmbo in Citizen Kane.  Of course she was conveniently married to the famous and influential stage director/designer Gtz Friederich which is probably why she landed a job at Bayreuth in the first place.  She never appeared there again after this show ended.  She was an attractive woman and a fine actress which mitigates her singing performance on film, but if you shut your eyes and just listen what you will hear is pretty bad; out of tune, shrill, wobbly and clumsy in the little roulades that litter this role.  Armstrong specialized in 'contemporary' music in which she could fake her way around and have unreliable intonation without drawing too many complaints.  But in Wagner she is way out of her league.  She does possess a full and well-centered middle register which has beauty in it but too often the intonation is suspect to allow pleasurable listening.

It is all a great shame in some ways because the other four principals are very good, indeed Elizabeth Connell's Ortrud is outstanding, one of the finest.  And Bernd Weikl was a beautifully voiced Herald.  Leif Roar is an excellent Telramund as well.

Siegfried Vogel's King is also a fine voice but his chance to make an impact at the end of Act I in the great ensemble goes for little due to the Sony (CBS's) muddy sound recording.  Woldemar Nelsson's sloppy conducting doesn't help in that regard, especially when the chorus is singing and display very little discipline with entrances.  This is the only recording from Bayreuth that I've heard in which the chorus sounds poorly rehearsed, comparatively speaking to the usual phenomenal group that it is.

I suppose if you don't care what singers sound like but like to look at heavenly male pulchritude then this Lohengrin may be for you.  In fact the entire cast is very good looking, though Armstrong looks older than the very handsome King!  The production is 'traditional', no Konzept antics by arrogant Wunderkinds who know better than Wagner.

The only Lohengrin film I own is the one from Baden-Baden conducted by Kent Nagano in a sadly silly production by Nikolaus Lehnhoff.  But it is fairly benign and the singers are tremendous, notably Waltraud Meier's excoriating Ortrud and Klaus Florian Vogt's supernatural and handsome Lohengrin.

Haven't seen the Hans Neufels production from Bayreuth recently released, the one with the singing rats.  I am curious about it but only because reviewers suddenly think it's a work of genius, whereas when it premiered it was a pile of cow dung.

People are fickle.

I'd skip this Nelsson film from Bayreuth however.  The Herzog production from 1990 is very beautiful and I may pop for that one if I need another film of this opera.  Frankly, I prefer the movie screen in my head when I listen to this music.",1414627200,,4268,4.770804911323329
8127228,5,B000FVQUNA,"The best all round performance of Lohengrin that I have personally heard. Though performed & recorded in 1982, the sound is spectactular and again, brilliantly conducted by Woldemar Nelsson.",1411603200,,190,5.586206896551724
8127229,4,B000FVQUNA,"In terms of performance, I don't think this can be beat.  Hofmann, Armstrong and Roar are all close to ideal.  I thought Connell's voice was a little light, but she was effective as a sexy Ortrud.  Weikl's Herald is a nice bonus.  As usual, Friedrich's production is excellent.  I took off one star because the video quality leans toward the fuzzy side.",1368403200,3,353,4.629032258064516
8127230,5,B000FVQUNA,"This video features the lead singer who actually resembles the title character, which is a blessing. The others are less convincing, with the exception of Ortrud: she's fine. The sets are atrocious as usual: minimalist nonsense. Elsa is, well ... never mind. The orchestra is nearly perfect, the tempi pretty good (almost no dragging). All other video recordings of this masterpiece are worse, some of them a lot worse. During certain portions of this production you'll actually get the sense of what Wagner was trying to convey. The English subtitles are so-so. The voices are exceptional.",1343001600,3,590,5.15625
8127231,1,B000FVQUNA,"Overall performance is excellent, the set is simplistic yet effective. But I am surprised that nobody mentioned about the poor video quality. It's like watching VHS tape copied about 30 times, on overused cassette. However, the cover art on DVD case looks amazing!

And Karen Armstrong playing Elsa, looks way too old! I believe Elsa is supposed to be late teens (17? 18?) in the play. Karen Armstrong was ""only"" 41 when this was filmed, but she looks more or less about 50-60 in this opera. The wedding scene thus looked ridiculous...

Peter Hofmann in contrast looks amazing as well as all other supporting roles. No wonder the album cover shows Hofmann's face, but not Armstrong's.",1327968000,5,684,4.887931034482759
8127232,5,B000FVQUNA,"Goetz Friedrich's production of ""Lohengrin"" was first seen at the Bayreuth Festival in 1979, and was filmed in 1982.  The cast is headed by Peter Hofmann, Karan Armstrong (now Friedrich's widow), Elizabeth Connell, Leif Roar, Siegfried Vogel, and Bernd Weikl.

The late Hofmann certainly looks the part of the knight of the title, and he was at his considerable best in 1982.  Armstrong is one of the greatest singing-actresses, and is extraordinarily moving as Elsa.  Far from the usual simpering heroine, Armstrong's portrayal is far more nuanced--even negative--than most, her tortured soul made plain before us.  Her voice is not conventionally beautiful, to be certain, but is completely expressive.  This is a great portrayal.

Connell sings well as Ortrud, but what we miss is the demonic aspect that the great Dunja Vejzovic gives us so memorably in Herbert von Karajan's recording (1976-81) and the DVD conducted by Claudio Abbado (1990).  Hers is a towering characterisation.

The remainder of this Bayreuth cast is excellent, with Weikl the greatest imaginable Herald.  This is perhaps the finest Friedrich production on DVD, exposing the nerves of Richard Wagner's romantic opera, with beautiful costuming (by Frieda Parmeggiani) revealing the physical beauty of the hero and heroine.",1325376000,9,1296,5.402985074626866
8127233,5,B000FVQUNA,What a sensational production. It can never get any better. Peter Hofmann (RIP) the best Lohengrin ever. A voice directly from heaven! Karan Armstrong the perfect match for an Elsa you'll never forget. The DVD is a crown jewel of Opera DVDs.,1302652800,7,241,4.761904761904762
