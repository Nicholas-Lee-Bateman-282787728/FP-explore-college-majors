8353354,5,B0026P4DLO,"This is the most compelling DVD produced to date on St. Catherine of Siena. The art work is fantastic! Catherine was said to be beautiful and the illustrator really makes her shine in  beautiful plates. The use of pastels really allows for a fresh upbeat appearance for this video. Among the topics covered, are several interviews with Dominican sisters around the USA. They discuss a variety of topics that address current issues within the scope of Catherine's teachings. I really like the fact that it is divided into sections, so it can be used in teaching separate sections.
  Just a fantastic job.",1393977600,3,603,4.892156862745098
