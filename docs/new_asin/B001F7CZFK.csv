8494353,1,B001F7CZFK,"Don't waste your money! This is a cheap rip-off of Kung Fu Panda. The animation sucks, the characters are unlikable, and the voice acting is so poor that it makes Norm of the North look good.

The animation is top notch, the story is heartwarming, and all in all, this movie is just incredible. And let's not forget the well done voice acting. Mike Pollock as Master Xin is brilliant. It made me laugh at unexpected moments and was a great film to watch with my family.",1484092800,4,390,4.430555555555555
