 The story follows a group of kids who run an arts camp over the summer.  It was cute for what it was , but some of the details were hard to overlook.  Such as a talent agent who drives an older Nissan, a little league team comprised of two kid and some very strange costume choices . Although I admit it was the Supertones T-shirt that led me to watch the movie in the first place . Penny, the narrator, is on the obnoxious side of quirky.  She is more on the outside of the story, so her interpretation of events comes across as preachy and judgmental, which if you are looking for a good Christian movie that might be a little offputting . Especially since the intended audience is young Christian kids, whose parents probably don't want to instill those values in them . But that's just my take on it there's obviously nothing inappropriate in here and probably parents wouldn't be too bored watching with their children . The rest of the kids were cute and made for a cute movie.",1498435200,,1092,4.412935323383085
8652883,5,B00JPO96HA,"This is a fun movie for kids that carries a great message. It's a prodigal son story featuring lots of fun dancing, music and comedy. My children laughed a lot and really loved all the characters, including the dog! It is well produced and features lots of younger actors that our children really connected with. We definitely recommend this to parents for children and pre-teens (and you will probably enjoy it too)!",1436659200,2,417,4.805555555555555
