8377902,1,B002QVFOPM,"This movie is Horrible!!!!!! it is way awful to be this long. The effects suck. The Kills suck. I mean come on the name says it all.

The ONLY way this is a ""good"" movie is if you're into really bad movies that are so bad they're comedies--the reason I Picked it up. Even going in with that attitude it is a bad movie. save your money.

The monster looks like a lame invisible(predator style) power ranger",1271376000,10,405,4.246753246753247
