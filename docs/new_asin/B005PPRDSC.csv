8482567,5,B005PPRDSC,"That pretty much sums it up.  I loved seeing and hearing from all the native Kahunas in Hawaii, who found Braco genuine and a true vessel of Light.  A big thanks to Angelika Whitcliffe for bringing Braco into the 21st Century of Technology so that his Mission can be live streamed from wherever he is in the world, Gazing with others and bringing his mission to light our inner spark into a blaze of Light is individually realized, worldwide.  A wonderful Light Messenger.  I loved the DVD.",1389398400,7,490,4.597701149425287
