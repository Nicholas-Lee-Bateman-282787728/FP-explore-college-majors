8523159,3,B007YAMPWU,"Wow...I just watched this again and was literally blown away.  This is unedited film so you get a real behind the scenes look at the interactions of the band members with each other before, during and after the songs.  Plus there are some great versions of songs never officially released.  This is not a high quality video but considering it was likely not intended to be released, it's a great look into this once great band.  Highly recommended for the true CSN&Y fan and collector.",1401062400,,485,4.670588235294118
8523160,1,B007YAMPWU,"I agree with the first two reviewers, this is pretty ordinary, I enquired before I purchased in relation to its' origins, but didn't get a real answer, so I took my chances! Hopefully the authorised version is released, and then we will have something to watch!!",1364342400,2,262,4.717391304347826
8523161,2,B007YAMPWU,This is not a quality show. The footage and audio are sub-par. It is not an official release - grey market. Let the buyer beware.,1345248000,6,129,4.2
8523162,1,B007YAMPWU,"This is a bootleg, please don't buy it! The official version is finally set to be released next year, so wait for that and get the real deal.",1342828800,13,141,4.071428571428571
