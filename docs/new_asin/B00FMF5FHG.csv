8616885,5,B00FMF5FHG,The staging and location as well as performance were amazing.  I wish there had been cameras involved in the stage more for that perspective but it's not worth any deductions,1426809600,,174,4.8
8616886,4,B00FMF5FHG,"Okay, this is a reprised production of the grand 1913 La Scala premiere, the sets of which were designed and made with the involvement of Auguste Mariette, the eminent French Egyptologist at the instigation of the Khedive (Viceroy) at that time. The Khedive stipulated that the opera that was to be premiered was to be a purely ancient Egypt with the sets to be based on historical accounts and costumes to be designed after the archaological bas reliefs of upper Egypt. Mariette knew what the Khedive wanted and said No effort will be spared in this respect, and the mise-en-scne will be as splendid as one can imagine. You know the viceroy does things in a grand style.
Imagine, what joy it is to be able to watch a re-creation of that splendid premiere version, especially for Asian viewers who had not been able to see the great inauguration production, nor given any idea of what that looked like!
Apart from the vocal side, this production has great choregraphy and great dancing. The venue, the Arena di Verona, has an even larger size than La Scala in which this production premiered, with a grand scale and magnificent acoustics of the Roman arena that is even more ideally suited to the pageantry of Verdi's Egyptian opera, framed by obelisks and sphinxes and filled with chorus and dancers.
Filmed in the 2000 year-old Roman amphitheatre at Verona with 20,000 seats and in 3D & High Definition in 2012.
Gianfranco De Bosio directing the revival of the original 1913 production, and he, together with conductor Daniel Oren, approach the production at a 'grand' manner.
Luckily, in the title role, sung by Hui He, she is able to provide the dire subtlty and musical nuances of the work in the portrayal of the eponymous slave girl.
Both her big arias, Ritorna vincitor and O patria Mia gleam. As her competitor for Radams love, the experienced Hungarian mezzo-soprano Andrea Ulbrich has a voice is big enough for the role and although not particularly subtle in characterisation. However, she has the vocal heft and bite to come over in the large Verona Arena while her acting is committed.
As the war hero Radams, Italian tenor Marco Bertie retains his usual good standard as a true Verdian tenor, though imperfect in his acting, but strangely works well enough for the large space at Verona.
The real vocal king in this production is Ambrogio Maestri, who looks as if he could stomp the Egyptians to death if he wanted to, who sings and acts a monumental Amonasro.",1402444800,3,2475,4.771561771561772

8616888,5,B00FMF5FHG,The singing is magnificent and the production exceeds anything I've ever dreamed possible. Add to this the realism of 3D filming and you too will be enthralled.,1391990400,,160,4.962962962962963
