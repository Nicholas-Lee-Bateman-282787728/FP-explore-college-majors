5738166,4,B00CT1NSC0,"This is awesome, and I can't wait to watch the entire show.  Including all of the TV movies makes this a must-have for any classic TV buff.  An important FYI for those about to start the set: ""The Kirkoff Case"" is actually the second episode.  The pilot TV movie can be found on Season Two's disc 6 as a bonus feature.",1433030400,33,318,4.180327868852459
5738167,5,B00CT1NSC0,"ROCKFORD FILES was a private detective drama about a pardoned ex-con, now down-on-his-luck private investigator Jim Rockford(James Garner)who investigated everything from divorce cases to homicides, and lived an eccentric lifestyle since he lived in a rusty trailer in a parking lot in Malibu by the beach, always struggling to make ends meet, especially since Rockford was frequently getting snookered by clients and was always getting his overworked cop buddy Det. Dennis Becker(Joe Santos)from the LAPD in hot water with his superior officers Lt. Diehl(Tom Atkins)and Lt. Chapman(James Luisi), plus Rockford's sexy attorney girlfriend Beth Davenport(Gretchen Corbett) was always bailing him out of jail, plus Rockford was always getting in trouble by his sleazy ex-con buddy Angel Martin(Stuart Margolin).

This show also takes me back to memory lane to my childhood days when I used to watch it every Friday night on NBC during its 1974-80 run, but unfortunately the last season was cut short since Rockford had been abruptly cancelled in mid-season back in the Winter of 1980, due to James Garner developing health problems, along with the fact that Jim was getting tired and Garner had ran out of steam along with the fact that THE ROCKFORD FILES started losing viewers through THE DUKES OF HAZZARD when the Dukes premiered on CBS in the Winter of 1979 since Rockford's 9PM timeslot on NBC conflicted with the Dukes 9PM time-slot on CBS, especially since DUKES OF HAZZARD was an instant smash that was a lot newer than ROCKFORD FILES was, plus Bo & Luke Duke(John Schneider, Tom Wopat)were just young-farts with lots of energy just getting started in their showbiz career while James Garner was becoming an old fart who ran out of gas, plus the General Lee outclassed Rockford's Firebird on top of that.

THE ROCKFORD FILES also had a lot of interesting guest stars throughout its whole 6-year run on NBC like
*Gerald McRaney whom is best known for the gonzo, often short-tempered private dick(Rick Simon)on SIMON & SIMON
*Tom Selleck before his stardom days as the Hawaiian beach-bum private-eye Thomas Magnum on MAGNUM, P.I.
*Mary Carver whom played Rick & AJ's kind, but long-time suffering mother(Cecilia Simon)on SIMON & SIMON
*Erin Gray whom played the sexy Wilma Deering on BUCK ROGERS and the charming Kate Summers on SILVER SPOONS
*Sorrell Booke whom is best known as the greedy police commissioner Boss Hogg on THE DUKES OF HAZZARD
*Tim O'Connor whom is best known as Dr. Huer on BUCK ROGERS
*Country Western singer doing a cameo in the ""Love Is The Word"" episode
*Bill Boyett whom is best known for his Sgt. MacDonald role on ADAM-12
*Linda Evans before her co-starring days as the sexy Krystle Carrington on DYNASTY
*Jack Colvin whom is best known as the nosey obsessed reporter(Jack McGee)on THE INCREDIBLE HULK
*Award winning Mariette Hartley in the ""Paradise Cove"" episode
*Lance LeGault whom is best known as the abrasive Army nemesis(Col. Decker) on THE A-TEAM and the antagonistic Navy nemesis(Col. Green)on MAGNUM, PI
*Joan Van Ark before her co-starring days on KNOTT'S LANDING
*Del Monroe after his co-starring days on VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA
*Larry Linville during his co-starring days on MASH guest starring in the ""A Deadly Maze"" episode
*Lindsey Wagner whom is best known for her Jamie Sommers role on THE BIONIC WOMAN guest starring in the pilot episode
*Ted Schakelford before his co-starring days on KNOTT'S LANDING
*Mills Watson whom is best known for his doofus Deputy Perkins role on SHERIFF LOBO

Additionally, I used to watch Rockford in reruns from 1993-1995, TNN from 2001-02, TV Land from 2002-03, WGN from 2003-07, and now I sometimes watch it on MeTV weekdays at 12PM.

It still baffles me why Universal is re-releasing a complete set of Rockford, especially in todays troubled economy along with the fact that Universal already released a complete series box set of this detective drama back in the Summer of 2012.",1428278400,5,3967,5.051908396946565

Hard to imagine the cars were so BIG back then and that people thought those styles were attractive for hair and attire and d&eacute;cor.  What were they thinking?  In any event, the episodes are enjoyable and it's nice to see James Garner handsome and young again.  Well worth the expense of purchase to time travel back 43 years ago into a world that looks familiar - and yet very alien.

5738226,5,B00CT1NSC0,"This review is for the 2015 complete collection set.  I grew up watching this show as a kid, and this and Columbo were favorites.  So the content is well known and familiar to me.  The show ran over six seasons plus there a few feature movies for TV in the 1990s.  The first five seasons are 22 episodes each and the last season was 12 episodes.  There is an additional amount of bonus material on the discs.  Unlike current times each episode ran a full 50 minutes in an hour because of fewer commercials and station breaks then than now.  The DVD case inserts have a listing of each episode and a brief summary.  There are four or five episodes on each DVD on average.  Each DVD is single sided and the cases hold each DVD on a separate secure spindle.  Much of this show was shot outdoors and there are usually two or three car chases per episode.  The number and variety of indoor and outdoor filming locations is remarkable and gives a great view of the time period around LA.  Just like the Columbo series you will see a lot of actors who became bigger stars later.  Just in the first two episodes James Woods appears as a wealthy murder suspect and James Cromwell appears in the second episode as a tennis instructor.

A couple of things bother me.  The pilot episode appears in the season two set, meaning the first episode in season one starts cold with no background on who the characters are.  I have no idea why the pilot is included with the later season, and then hidden as bonus material on the last disc.  The video and audio quality are mostly good.  In some sections there are noticeable audio dropouts, but those are few and far between.  Audio is Dolby stereo but I watch using Dolby Surround activated on my receiver.  The video is more problematic.  Most scenes look vibrant and crystal clear.  Others are washed out and have a lot of flecks and specks from the film because the transfer is not put through what could be an expensive restoration process.  I watch on a 4K 65 inch TV and am impressed with the video quality considering the material available but it would of course be better if the show was restored.  Given that the set was released in this version in 2015 they could have done even better, but then the whole set would be more expensive than the below $60 price I paid.",1475625600,17,2309,4.4170616113744074

5738245,5,B00CT1NSC0,We really enjoy watching this,1468627200,,29,5.0
5738246,4,B00CT1NSC0,"Sporadically, I have watched most but not all of these episodes in re-runs. So, when I saw this set was available I decided the series warranted the purchase and decided to watch the entire series, in order. The show is an interesting record of the 1970s styles and cars but it is the iconic character created by Stephen Cannell and fleshed-out by James Garner that keeps the series watchable and timeless.

Regarding this particular product, the DVDs are one sided, the problem is the transfer to DVD was not cleaned-up so there are specks and flecks and flaws in the video that, depending on each particular episode, can present a truly irritating distraction. Overall the picture, while definitely not high definition is also not fuzzy and the audio does not break-up, but if ever a series deserved respectful handling and a superior transfer to video this is the one. So, the result is disappointing.

With most of the seasons there are four episodes on each disc. I have been working my way through the set as time permits for the last six months. Finally done and after playing each disc encountered no problems. Also, in some recent DVD sets to conserve space the discs are stacked, but this one is packaged with each season is in its own DVD case with the six discs staggered throughout the case, a method I think keeps scratching to a minimum.

If unfamiliar with the storyline, this is a series where a world weary ex-con anti-hero provides the moral compass for a not so reliable crew of regulars and episodic guest stars. Wrongly convicted, jailed and then pardoned, he is acutely aware that even a small misstep can have dire consequences. So, although he is a private investigator (PI) and must make a living, he is usually reluctant to take a case. His go-to response is, no.

His expectations are low, people have failed him, the system has failed him, and most cases that fall in his hands are of questionable merit and often have even less of a monetary incentive. Reluctant as he is, a good sob story and/or basic injustice (given his own first-hand experience) is often enough to convince him to take a case.

Hes a good guy but has been through enough to not be surprised when clients are revealed to be liars and crooks. He is understandably cautious with personal involvements, and other than the one with his father, there is always a wall up. The relationship with his dad is an anchor in the show. Typical of any parent-adult child union it is fraught with on-going annoyance along with genuine affection.

His Firebird is periodically stolen, his trailer broken into, he is frequently not paid and there is the on-going threat of having his PI license pulled, but things are usually somewhat resolved by the episodes end. Helping his clients out of one jam after another, he is a reluctant hero at a time when there often seems to be few heroes of any kind.

Hes a survivor and a character the viewer wants to see prevail. It is difficult not to admire his ability to keep his humanity and carve out a life on his own terms with heart and humor. Pleased as I am to own the entire series, the transfer to DVD is much less than it should be.",1467849600,22,3166,4.602836879432624

Can anyone, or all of you who have purchased this set before, tell me if the Complete Collection (Series and Movies Boxed Set) has an inferior picture quality due to video compression issues, a superior quality picture quality or the same picture quality as the individual DVD Volumes 1 - 6 and Movies Volumes 1 & 2. I am trying to decide if I should purchase the set or the individual volumes one at a time. I don't care about cost, I care about quality. Currently I am viewing this spectacular show on Netflix and the picture quality on my 75 inch 4K TV is amazing. I want the disc but not if the quality isn't as good as the streaming service.

Several Christmas' back, {in back to back years,} I purchased complete series of Get Smart and The Man From U.N.C.L.E. I realize it had been a while since I "" treated"" myself to a complete series as a ""from-me-to-me"" Christmas present.
 I know RF is shown on METV, but I don't watch it. Then I got to thinking, why not see about getting the complete series. So, I did, but I didn't want to, {hopefully wouldn't have to}, spend a lot for it. Well after checking several places {the lowest I saw it for was $75.00} Then, while searching Google, I noticed that e-bay was selling it for $65.00 snatched it up!

5738311,1,B00CT1NSC0,"For people who would like to see the best quality presentation of the Rockford files, which I would consider to be one of the 10 best tv series of all time.

This sets episodes have been compressed resulting in a poor quality artifact laden blurry mess, like Universals complete monster collection.

Sadly there was no mention that these would be of LESSER quality than the original separate releases of each season. And the ""reviewers"" on amazon must need glasses or just don't care to be critical of a substandard video.

I curse at Universal for their terrible treatment of Rockford and the Monsters

So if you don't care about the image quality by all means waste your money supporting Universals slap in the face of a re-release.
 Having also wasted money on the edited bluray I have to say...if you want to see Rockford in the best NON BLOCKY uncompressed unedited manner buy the original individual dvd releases.",1441152000,80,919,4.791139240506329

5738313,5,B00CT1NSC0,"It's actually a great set. Garner was one of my favorites. They clean these old prints up to something very bright and clear. Garner was one of the last in the line of somewhat Noirish actors, never cheerleaders, always under the gun, never that confident.

5738330,5,B00CT1NSC0,"Some people think that going to an art museum to see a painting is fun, for others it's hob-knobbing at the country club.  For me, it is admiring the masterpiece that I think Mr. Garner built around his character of Jim Rockford.  If I were to ever have had the chance to meet Mr. Garner, I would have just thanked him for all of his hard work and told him how much his series made me feel good about myself.  It's okay to not be all wrapped up in the hype of what the world thinks you are supposed to be wrapped up in. Although you may have to walk out the front door every morning to go earn a living in the jungle, you don't have to buy into it. You get to keep it simple, know what's really right and wrong and just enjoy life and people whenever you get the chance.., and that you are the one in control over your own life and God help anyone who thinks that they can take that from you.  Thank you Mr Garner.  -Richard Hodgkinson",1436745600,18,935,4.032432432432432

5738337,5,B00CT1NSC0,"I've already written a review about The Rockford Files series on here. So this review is solely about this ""Complete Series"" package. I completely appreciate the fact that not only do they put in the regular seasons but they put in the ""movie collections"" too, unlike, oh, Murder She Wrote or Absolutely Fabulous that require you to buy the movie specials separately. Staying true to the Jim Rockford character I think.",1433894400,18,419,4.915492957746479
5738338,5,B00CT1NSC0,"A great upgrade. I had only one season of the Rockford Files before purchasing this. My reluctance to continue buying the series was based on the fact that the discs were double sided. So you get those stupid flip discs, which I hate immensely. With this set you get six the right amount of DVDS (one sided) with pictures, you also get individual/standard sized cases which if you wanted to take out it out of its slipcover they would fit better in your collection than the old packaging. Also you get both volumes of movies (which I also loved) so everything is included in a nice/neat package without any of the things that annoyed me about the previous release. Episode Descriptions are on the inside of the clear cases (interior side of the label). So there is nothing not to love about this set. I loved the series growing up and though it's a little dated in parts, that simply just adds to the fun of re-watching this series. James Garner is a great actor, and the writers and directors knew just how to write for and showcase his talents. It's one of the best detective shows on t.v. past present or future. I'm sure you'll enjoy the series as much as I have and still do.",1433808000,110,1180,4.442396313364055
5738339,5,B00CT1NSC0,The s one Rockford Files was always one of my favorite T.V. shows I remember watching it on Friday nights as a kid. Its better than ever since its been released with DVD'S of the made for T.V. movies which I never had the opportunity to see all of. I never paid attention to all the big name stars that stared  in it. Some of them were not big stars at the time they starred in it. The Firebird became as much a star as the celebrities. I wonder who many people know that James Garner did all his own driving in the show!!!,1433030400,14,523,4.028846153846154

8585977,5,B00CT1NSC0,"Firstly, it's good.  It's Rockford so what did you expect. It's well packaged and has none of those ridiculously annoying double sided discs.
I must say though, that looking at the episode sequence(s) had me a bit confused. I was going to write a review, slating the manufacturers of this particular set for not not providing the 'Complete' series. The first episode I expected to see was the double feature, two-parter, starring Lindsay Wagner, called Backlash of the Hunter. It aired on TV in March 1974, six months ahead of the series proper in Sept of 74.  It also starred Robert Donley as Rocky (Jim's dad).  This was changed for the actual TV series and he was replaced with the lovable Noah Beery.
However, when I unpacked my eagerly awaited ""complete' boxed set, Backlash of the Hunter was not where I expected it to be.
It wasn't until the following day that I discovered that some bright spark had decided it would be a good idea to include it as a 'Bonus' episode buried at the back end of season two.  Why? Your guess is as good as mine. Personally, I think it's in entirely the wrong place. If you're going to release a complete series like this, then at least it could have run in chronological order.  That said....  It's still excellent! and I would highly recommend this set over the cheaper double-sided disc versions that are on offer.",1528156800,,1354,4.620833333333334
