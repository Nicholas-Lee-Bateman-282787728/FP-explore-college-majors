2859659,5,B000R7I3Z0,My daughter just loves this series. Especially Nat Wolff!! Anyone who loves this series will want to have this dvd.,1194480000,,115,4.8
2859660,4,B000R7I3Z0,"Okay, so my kid, now 10, gave up piano years ago.  But now wishes she was in The Band!  Instead she just follows every move these kids make.  I told her she should get back into lessons and she too could be a star.  Well, maybe.  Anyway, I love that these kids actually have a bit of comedic timing and seem to enjoy every minute they are on camera.  I know their parents (Nat and Alex Wolff's Mom and Dad are actor/director and pro musician respectively) are very talented and look like they are having fun with the show too.  Get it for your kid if they are a fan.  They'll dig it and it's all good fun and totally family friendly.  Now we hope her uncle can get their autograph next time we go to LA.  He claims to know someone that works with them who is famous in her own right. Cool!",1193097600,2,789,4.064935064935065

8199148,5,B000R7I3Z0,"My 15yr. old daughter has taking a liking to these guys again.  She used to watch them when they were on the TV.  Then along came Justin Leave it to Bieber  ( I'm stuck on myself, don't care about my young fans anymore, just buy my songs so I can party like Miley C. etc..)  and she fell in love like the rest of young girls.  But now she has seen how he treats his fans.  So down came the posters and delete his songs from her mp3 player and she remembered The Naked Brothers Band didn't let the fame get to their heads like others.  So she is really interested in them again!!  Trust me these guys are alright!",1377302400,2,612,4.041666666666667
8199149,5,B000R7I3Z0,"By the time my daughter is done with it, EVERYONE in my house will know these episodes word for word.",1358294400,,101,4.1

8199151,5,B000R7I3Z0,"My children ages 5 & 8 just love the Naked Brothers Band.  And to be honest I really do, too.  This is a good thing since the DVDs (as well as the CDs) are played quite frequently at our house and in our car.  Just last night when we were driving they were quoting lines from Nat & Alex  in a friendly family backseat competition of ""Which Wolff brother said this?"" Too fun! And guess what?  My daughter just read this review over my shoulder as I was typing and said ""Tell them I'm gonna go watch the NBB right now!""  Like I said it is frequently played and we love it!",1200096000,,570,4.044642857142857
8199152,5,B000R7I3Z0,"My Grandson, who is 5, thinks the Naked Brothers Band is the greatest!!!  He is very musically inclined, learns the lyrics and sings and dances right along with the group.  Crazy Car is one of his favorites.  I think this group is pretty neat, too!!!",1199232000,,250,4.511111111111111
8199153,3,B000R7I3Z0,"I wouldn't say this movie is totally family friendly. For a kids show, it has several sexual references. Nat Wolff pats Rosalina on her butt. They also showed a teen couple kissing really passionately. The youngest band member swears a lot, but replaces them with other words (""poo-poo sauce"").
The band members mocked the only girl in the band because she had a crush on a rival band member.

Still, I give it 3 stars since it shows that kids can write music and put together a band and even if they fight, they can make up later.",1194566400,5,531,4.418367346938775
