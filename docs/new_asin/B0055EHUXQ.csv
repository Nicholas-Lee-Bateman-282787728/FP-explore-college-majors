8458145,3,B0055EHUXQ,"I picked up this movie at Dragon*Con in Atlanta this year and figured, ""hey, free movie, what do I have to lose?""

I went into it with a little hesitance (Kinda burned out on vampires) but tried to keep an open mind.  The film seemed self-aware as far as the, ""yes, we know everyone is doing vampires now and no, we don't sparkle,"" which as a fan of more traditional horror I appreciated.

[SPOILERS]

With a 14 minute run-time unfortunately the movie doesn't really have enough time to develop the ideas introduced.  I understand that in independent film budget and therefore time is very restricted but the premise of the film (there's a building conflict between vampire factions, the White Clan wants to ally with the Templars but their emissary is killed) was interesting and deserved more development.  The film just kind of...stopped.  I didn't feel like there was an adequate climax and there really is no resolution to the conflict.

[/SPOILERS]

That being said, I gave this film three stars for he following reasons:
(+) The vampires did not sparkle
(-) The George Lucas Effect/the dialog was clunky.  Whether this is entirely due to writing not being edited well or the actors not knowing to/not being allowed to use the script as a guideline versus a word-for-word I can't say.
(o) The female lead had believable body language but again, poor line delivery.  She wasn't bad and maybe with a bit better writing she'd shine in the role but it's difficult to tell.
(-) Supporting acting was not good.  Wooden line delivery.
(+) Good soundtrack.
(+) Interesting story in concept, would be better with a longer time frame to explore (at least 30 minutes but easily an hour)
(o) Odd choices in special effects (did Crystal really need to get knocked out 5 times?!)
(+) Cool comic-ish credits.

So overall, give it a shot since the proceeds go to a good charity, but don't expect too much.",1318204800,,1895,4.740853658536586
