732489,5,6303894534,"One of Nashville's supreme singer, songwriter and entertainer, Alan Jackson will forever be etched into the traditional country sound. Like Hank Williams, George Jones, Merle Haggard, Johnny Cash, Waylon and Willie.....today, we have Alan Jackson!

Alan Jackson's music video collection begins with 1989 ""Blue Blooded Woman"" to ""1995 ""Tall Tall Trees"".

The music video that propelled Jackson to superstardom, his ""signature song"" is ""Here in the Real World"" .....where the boy don't always get the girl!  Probably no other music video reflects the development of his career like ""Chasin' That Neon Rainbow"" You'll see visuals of Alan ""growing up"" right before our eyes. I love the line.....daddy won a raadeeoooo...tuned it to a country show....

Each video is produced with a degree of excellence, whether it was homage to an idol, Hank Williams in the somber ""Midnight in Montgomery"" or ""Livin' on Love."" its message clearly, the adulation for his parents who survived on simple things in life....plain ole love. The fun ones are here, ""Chattahoochee"", ""Mercury Blues"" ""Don't Rock the Jukebox"" ....wanna hear some Jones......

Alan Jackson wrote much of his own music, but with collaboration and guidance, he sure picked 'em! In ""Song for the Life"", written by artist and songwriter, Rodney Crowell, memorable images of Jackson's string of videos enhance the lyrical tune. Storyteller songwriter Tom T. Hall wrote the upbeat ""Tall Tall Trees"" and who would ever think to countrify the Eddie Cochran rock oldie, ""Summertime Blues""?

Others included are: ""Someday"", ""She's Got the Rhythm"", ""Mercury Blues"" to love's desperation ""Wanted"", and ""Tonight I Climbed The Walls.""

One of my favorites is ""Gone Country"" I like everything about that, image, lyrics, melody; its message of country gone pop.

Still some fine ones,  ""I Don't Even Know Your Name"", ""Who Says You Can't Have it All"", ""She's Got the Rhythmn"".

It's hard to select a favorite, but I think it's ""Gone Country"".  Alan Jackson is a legend! .....Rizzo.",1023926400,10,2017,5.252336448598131

732893,5,6303894534,"All the other country singers could learn a thing or two from Alan Jackson.
He was smart enough to make a video for almost all of his recorded songs.  Just try to find videos of many of the other country singers.
I'm thinking specifically of Carrie Underwood.  She also has made several videos, but just try to find a collection of them on DVD.  Also, I saw her give an incredible rendition of ""Stand By Your Man"" on one of the awards shows.  Where is that?
Of course, many of the early artists we would love to be able to see on DVD were around before that technology became available, so a CD is the best we can do, but the DVD has made the CD obsolete, to my mind.
Anyway, Alan is great, and this DVD is wonderful.  Fantastic.  Just blows me away.
What a terrific age we live in - where we can amass a library of fantastic music videos and see, as well as hear, our favorite artists.",1314662400,2,886,4.152046783625731
