7803179,4,6300161374,"Wow, not only is this a really shoddy 80s karate action wannabe flick, but it's done in such a serious tone that there are no moments of comedy...except for the pathetic acting!  Our reject prototype of Daniel Larusso couldn't kick a dust ball.  The monk training scenes are hilarious.  You know you're in for a hoot when you're cracking up hysterically as the hero's face takes a pounding.  If you don't mind unintentional laughs, casio soundtrack, and cracker jack fight scenes, then watch it.
Still, way better than Double Impact.",1086739200,,533,4.888888888888889
