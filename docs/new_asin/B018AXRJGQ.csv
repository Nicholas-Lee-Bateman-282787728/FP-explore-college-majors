7544037,5,B018AXRJGQ,"As this title has not yet been released in the US I'll primarily be commenting on the story.

Sakura has a crush on Nozaki and when she finally gets up the nerve to confess her feelings to him she blurts out that ""she's a big fan of his"".  Misunderstanding the situation, Nozaki provides her with his signed autograph.  Mortified and a little confused, Sakura believes that she's lost her chance and prepares to leave, when Nozaki suddenly invites her back to his house... to draw for him.  It turns out that Nozaki is actually a famous Shojo (manga targeted at girls/women up to 20 yrs old) manga artist known as Yumeno Sakiko and he's had his eye on Sakura as an artist to help him out.  As Sakura assists Nozaki with his manga she meets up with the various people that have helped him along the way and others that have unknowingly provided inspiration for his story.

the cast of characters that's introduced in this anime are brilliant and what make this show so enjoyable.  From the dead-pan, almost emotionless Nozaki, the handsome, yet incredibly shy MIkorin, to the oblivious, thick-skinned, angelically voiced Seo (my personal favorite).  All of these elements combine to make an enjoyable, light-hearted romantic comedy.  the emphasis being more on the comedy than romance, though not by a lack of trying from Sakura.

when you get down to it, this is a romantic comedy about a romantic manga.  How can you go wrong?",1454889600,5,1427,4.7368421052631575

7544050,5,B018AXRJGQ,"One of the best recent animes I've seen, and much better than I expected. It makes the old anime tropes seem fresh, and has some really endearing characters, despite a focus on comedy. Very enjoyable and highly recommended.

Monthly Girls Nozaki-Kun is a high school comedy about a genki girl who loves a very tall boy who is a manga artist on the side. Once she gets involved in his work, their friends and associates are quickly drawn into a series of off-beat antics. This show looks a bit like a reverse-harem, but as there is no real plot, I suspect it was based on a four-panel gag manga. There is a good variety of characters, all normal at first glance but kooky in various ways. I laughed out loud a few times, which for me is rare. There's also some clever insight into the workings of shojo manga (romance comics, basically), and a clever bit where the silly conventions of shojo manga and computer dating games are compared. The only real downside is that the main character is bland, which is typical of harem shows. I'd love to see another series of this, but they'd have to introduce some sort of plot to maintain interest.

BTW, the Australian edition (if you can get it) includes three soundtrack CDs. That's good value, but the music was probably the least interesting part of this show....",1485648000,,1308,4.585470085470085
7544051,3,B018AXRJGQ,"Great series. Very funny and great characters. Terrible dubbing. The worst dubbing i have ever heard. I normally watch dub anime when possible, but the dub on this is so bad its not watchable. It does not do the japanese voices any justice. The japanese voices are great and the main female leads voice is so cute and funny which is completely destroyed on the dub. Even jokes aren't told right or sound right. 5 star series, took 2 stars down for a extremely bad dub. They should have had better voice actors.",1483056000,,510,4.494623655913978
7544052,5,B018AXRJGQ,"This anime is perfect for anyone who likes a nice romantic comedy, while at the same time likes a cliffhanger at the end l. I especially liked the the fact that nozaki never notices chiyos affection for him, and if he does he misinterprets it as something completely different. This is great as a starter anime for the beginner",1481587200,,327,4.559322033898305

7544055,5,B018AXRJGQ,"Quick shipping,  and was packaged perfectly, as to keep the cas and discs undamaged. I absolutely adore this anime, and am so glad to have found it at a reasonable price!",1470441600,,170,4.483870967741935
7544056,1,B018AXRJGQ,Personally I love this series. It's hilarious and adorable! My rating is solely based off of the condition that the case came in. I removed it from the package to find the case open already. Then upon further inspection I found that the box was broken on the inside cover are and on the side where the box opens. Plus all around the edges the plastic is bent. This is total bummer since I like my DVDs' packaging to remain pristine and right from the start its been messed up!,1467158400,4,476,4.3
7544057,5,B018AXRJGQ,"I saw the first 4 episodes in a movie theater premier of the English dub  a few months back and the audience was literally rolling in the aisles. So of course when it became available, I purchased it and watched with family. Needless to say, we laughed, and laughed and fell in love with the heart warming, zany characters. As an actress myself, who has watched a lot of anime--dubbed and undubbed--I know in years past English dubs often failed to meet up to the Japanese originals. In recent times though, I have found series dubs that do them justice. In my opinion, in this particular case,  the actors did such a bang-up job, this series will be the comic classic our family turns to when we just need a hearty laugh. I enjoyed their work tremendously!",1467158400,5,757,4.518248175182482
7544068,5,B018AXRJGQ,"Seemed brand new and clear shrink wrapped. Although had a sticker on the shrink wrap that wasn't from the dvd company that indicated the product.

Dvd case had no dents, and contained 3 discs.
The dvds had the complete season and the special episodes scattered between the 3 discs, among with special trailers and such (even the specials are dubbed!)

A++ quality for Dvds!",1465776000,,373,4.8125
7544069,5,B018AXRJGQ,the shipping was fast and my package came safe. Now for the product itself this anime is by far the funniest movie going its got all sorts of different feelings. One minute its lovey dovey then it gets into tummy grabbing lauphing. Then it becomes good confusing etc. I cant explain how much fun this anime is but you want know till you give it a watch . Very worth it too me thank you !!!,1463011200,,389,4.131578947368421

7544071,5,B018AXRJGQ,One of my favorite RomComs. Absolutely Hilarious and it has an amazing cast of colorful characters. I highly recommend this series if you want to laugh.,1461801600,,152,4.884615384615385
7544072,3,B018AXRJGQ,"I have discovered something: anime from Sentai Filmworks should never be purchased for hearing the dub.

Nozaki-kun is a terrific anime, and I have very much enjoyed the sub. But when I went to listen to the dub (I find it helpful to have a dub track going while I do other things, particularly chores), it was abominable. I can't believe they would consider this to be a sellable product.

It is possible that Sentai was focused too much on finding American voices that most closely resemble the Japanese voices. This is not entirely without reason -- the voice of a character should be relatively in sync with the character's personality and role in the show. HOWEVER, that is no excuse for subjecting fans to actors who are unable to act. The ""actors"" chosen for the American dub are lacking all ability to control their vocal performance (inappropriate stresses, poor pronunciation, stumbling, poor vocal technique, and worst of all: just plain bad acting, resulting in the wrong emotions/sense of characters being portrayed to the audience), which all adds up to an absolutely terrible experience.

5 stars for the series itself
0 stars for the dub",1461801600,4,1153,4.902564102564103

7544075,5,B018AXRJGQ,I really enjoy this anime. You will fall in love with all the characters and it was interesting to see their perspective on the development and creation of a manga. Definitely will rewards and recommend to any and everyone.,1459641600,,223,4.743589743589744
7544076,5,B018AXRJGQ,"I have not been a fan of Sentai releases in the past but with how great this Nozaki-kun box is I had to put my money down for it- not just because I loved the show but as an investment in future great Sentai box sets. I love that it has so many great extras, the bluray as well as the Dvd, the cd collection, and a nice box to keep everything collected. If you're looking for a great way to show you love of this series, this limited edition is the way to do it.",1459382400,3,462,3.8229166666666665
7544077,5,B018AXRJGQ,"Chiyo Sakura finally works up the courage to confess to her crush, but she cant quite bring herself to use the word like so she tells him that she is his fan. Unfortunately for her, Nozaki-kun is a manga artist and thinks she means that she is a fan of his work. So he gives her his autograph and then recruits her as an assistant to help him with his manga.

I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this series. The first episode was fun, but I wasn't really hooked until the second episode and the supporting characters began to be introduced. The characters are all fun to watch and the humor had me actually laughing aloud every episode (not normal for me).

There isn't really much plot progression, it is primarily a comedy, with about two vignettes per episode. Characters do grow a little closer together, becoming friends or possibly even couples, but nothing is really resolved for sure. Which is fine, the show is plenty enjoyable without that sort of development. I just wish they would do a second season!",1454976000,13,1016,4.546448087431694
8741910,5,B018AXRJGQ,I love this series! the artwork and story are really cute!,1534118400,,58,4.363636363636363
8741911,3,B018AXRJGQ,"The anime itself is fantastic.  A parody of shojo manga, it follows a stereotypical shojo protagonist (cute, energetic, flustered around the boy she likes, who has such love-inducing traits as being tall, and manly) as she tries, and fails, to confess her love to the boy she has a crush on.  In response to her botched confession, he recruits her as his assistant for his hobby, which is drawing romance manga for a monthly girls' magazine, and the two of them embark on various character studies, using people from their school as reference for the manga.  Tropes are turned upside down as they learn that none of their friends are a typical fit for the world of romance manga.

The voices were great in the original Japanese, and they're pretty good in English too, but I absolutely hate Nozaki's dub voice.  The voice actor is not a bad actor, but he sounds like an adult man, not a teenager.  It is possible to get around that with the proper intonation (My Love Story's dub is a fantastic example), but this was not done. The other voices are all pretty good.  And if you really can't stand them, the Japanese voices are great.

But the DVD release itself was a disappointment.  While none of the anime was missing (the six shorts are on the last disc, in the bonus features), the fact that my options were Japanese+subtitles or uncaptioned English, with nothing in between, is really frustrating.  Sometimes I like to watch my anime in Japanese, with no subtitles, to practice my listening comprehension and test my understanding.  Sometimes I watch the English dub with subtitles to compare the original with the localization.  And sometimes I watch the English dub with annoying people who talk, or with deaf people who rely on subs or captions for a complete understanding of what's going on.  It doesn't cost anything extra to make a single video track, two audio tracks, and a subtitle track that can be turned on and off.  That has been the standard for anime DVD releases for many years.  There is absolutely no reason why I should be disallowed from turning on the subtitles while watching in English.  There is no reason the publishers need to have two separate video tracks just to make a version with subtitles and a version without.  It is a frustration for me, and a waste of space on the disc.

A minor gripe I have with the packaging is that, in Sentai's attempt to make the discs ""cute"" by adding manga frames and placing screencaps of the anime in the frames, all three discs have the exact same layout, down to the same fountain pen in different colors on each disc.  It's lazy.  If this is going to be a bare-bones release because I didn't want to shell out for the Blu-Ray, fine, but don't make the discs so stylized if you're going to make them all the same.",1531094400,,2786,4.58989898989899
