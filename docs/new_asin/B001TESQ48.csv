3789775,5,B001TESQ48,"When my kindergartner was younger, we used to read Richard Scarry's stories and we both loved the fun characters and the morals in the stories. Recently, we discovered the cartoons based on the stories and they are indeed fun.

Huckle Cat, his sister Sally, and their friends investigate various mysteries in their neighborhood in Busytown. This DVD contains six episodes, and the animation quality is quite impressive, credibly bringing to life the very characters we used to read about in the books. Children ages 3-7 will enjoy these as the stories focus on problem solving.",1304294400,,577,5.073684210526316
3789776,5,B001TESQ48,The movie was in great quality and came in excellent time. The picture looks great and my son was thoroughly entertained throughout the whole movie.,1282348800,2,148,4.96
3789777,5,B001TESQ48,"So I haven't watched or read anything Richard Scarry since I was a kid, and this DVD brought back good times.  Richard Scarry has been entertaining and educating kids with Busytown characters, including Huckle Cat, Lowly Worm and Hilda Hippo.  It has great graphics and it is not at all cheesy at I expected.

There are six episodes on this DVD so you can watch them separately or watch them all at once!  I know we prefer episodes because my boys can't sit for the length of a whole DVD usually, so this is perfect for them to watch a few episodes, play, and then come back.  Although, this DVD is so cute they have watched it in its entirety.  The episodes also are wholesome and perfect to get your kids in the mood for springtime!  I also don't mind watching it with them and I know that they are watching something appropriate.",1267142400,6,832,4.398692810457517
3789778,5,B001TESQ48,"Fabulous DVD!  We watched this together and my son was just as enthralled as I was reading the books about thirty years ago.  The quality is perfect and an absolute wonderful match to the Busytown world I imagined so long ago.

This is not one long movie; it's actually several episodes compiled into one DVD.  Perfect for the car on short errands.",1247184000,5,348,4.564516129032258

8341274,5,B001TESQ48,"This product came to me as described, in wonderful condition, played well with no issues. My daughter loves the cartoon. It is as absolute favorite, and it is educational too.",1397779200,,175,4.866666666666666
8341275,5,B001TESQ48,Great video for young kids.  I would use this shipper again as they were prompt and the video came in great condition.,1381017600,,118,4.363636363636363
8341276,5,B001TESQ48,Good quality and fun to watch. Catchy songs with the same characters from the book. My kids ask for these again and again. None of the cartoons are scary or intense and they do a good job introducing problem-solving techniques in a fun way--by solving simple 'mysteries'.,1373068800,,271,4.787234042553192
8341277,5,B001TESQ48,"Since checking it out of the library, my 3-year old boys have been enthralled with this DVD!  The episodes are nice and short (about 10-minutes) and the kids just laugh hysterically at the funny parts.  They love the characters from the Richard Scarry books that we read together (Huckle & Sally, Lowly Worm, Hilda Hippo, Pig Will & Pig Won't, Sergeant Murphy, Bananas Gorilla, Miss Honey, Bruno, etc.)  The theme song is pretty catchy, so you might find yourself singing it throughout the day.

Anyway, I mostly wanted to write this review to give more details on the content of this DVD.  These are the episodes you will find:

1) Litterbug Busters (aired November 12, 2007) - Using clues found in the litter, Huckle hunts down a litterbug
2) The Playground Mystery (aired November 14, 2007) - Huckle, Lowly, and Sally must figure out why playground items keep disappearing
3) The Bank Note Mystery (aired November 21, 2007) - Lowly and Sally team up to decipher a mysterious bank note's meaning
4) The Flying Saucer Mystery (aired November 21, 2007) - Huckle and his friends find a tiny flying saucer
5) The Falling Fruit Mystery (aired November 23, 2007) - A cherry tree mysteriously drops all of its fruit
6) The Disappearing Swimming Hole (aired November 24, 2007) - When they find their favorite swimming hole empty, Huckle, Lowly, and Sally set out to find out where the water went

This is a fun, non-annoying show (at least to me!) and it does have the potential to teach some reasoning skills.  We are definitely going to buy some of these DVDs, as the prices are very reasonable.  I just picked up a brand new DVD of 26 episodes (52 mysteries) for five dollars; you can't beat that!",1370390400,,1694,4.6767676767676765
8341278,4,B001TESQ48,"My grand niece listens to this book regularly. I want to give her books that teaches, and will have her ready to listen and learn FOR her life journey. I have a few purchased through AMAZON . She enjoys them all. I am happy she does.",1369872000,,233,4.086956521739131
8341279,4,B001TESQ48,"My 3 year old daughter loves Huckle, we had been getting the DVD's from the library and I finally bought one!  The other DVD's we had been watching have 10 episodes that are each ~20 minutes (2 stories per episode)... however this DVD has 6 episodes that are each ~10 minutes (1 story per episode)... so really only equivilant to 3 of the standard 20 minute shows.  So there aren't as many stories as I was expecting but still a good value for the price.",1368748800,2,454,4.329411764705882
8341280,5,B001TESQ48,"the grandkids love these movies and they are easy to watch and follow.  busy town is great, this is especially good.",1367452800,,116,4.523809523809524
8341281,5,B001TESQ48,I would recommend this movie for toddlers or older kids. My son loves it. He is 1. It is educational and engaging.,1359676800,,114,4.2272727272727275
