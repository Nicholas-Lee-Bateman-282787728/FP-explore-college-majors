4047875,3,B0030ZOYVI,"As a note, although this is marked as ""season 2,""  in the way the series is actually presented here and on hulu ""season 2"" is actually the second half of season 1.  Up to episode 51 is ""season one"" in Japan, to avoid some confusion. (And by episode, I mean a 23 minute block).  The second half of season 1 (season two) is available on hulu, but it is subtitled.",1273622400,2,361,4.128571428571429
4047876,5,B0030ZOYVI,"if you like the first season then you should like this one as well. its more crazy adventures and wild schemes filled with lame puns and popculture references. the only thing i didn't care for in season 2 part 2 is that there is more momoka. i cannot stand her and she is the center of...2 or 3 episodes i think, she's just so annoying. i mean we've got it, you love fuyuki, your crazy, rich and your plans never, never work, can we please move on to something else and never ever have to deal with you again. also i think they changed the voice for Aki but thats not really a big deal.  over all it kept me laughing and thats what really counts.",1272153600,,646,4.126984126984127

4047919,5,B0030ZOYVI,Order arrived immediately and my children screamed with joy. Netflix canceled the show and we were all too enveloped for there only to be three seasons in the U.S. We would still buy the non-English versions if made available.,1396396800,,226,4.82051282051282

4047922,5,B0030ZOYVI,"SGT. FROG is brilliantly done.  Everything from the animation to the English dubbing is perfectly done.

Season Two is perhaps my favorite.  I think the writers were at there peak, with lots of inside jokes, and references to things like Twitter, Facebook, and gossip magazines.

My tween, teen, husband, laugh and talk about the stories all the time.  I know the kids' grandmother wouldn't ""get it""; and I'm not sure that all elementary children would like the episodes.  The move along at a pretty good clip.

Excellent, humorous entertainment with heart.
