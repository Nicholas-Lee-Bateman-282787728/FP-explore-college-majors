8448713,5,B004YOEGJO,"I realize these are public domain prints & no distributor thus far has released official season sets.  I really hope they do.  This is the kind of show that isn't circulating in rerun syndication & hasn't for some time, so VHS & DVD being the only viable venue will do nicely.  Given Trouble With Father is an Alpha release, the prints may at times vary in quality, but again, this program is highly obscure, so if Alpha continues releasing future DVDs, I'll keep buying what they put out. Overall, the picture & sound quality really aren't all that bad as I recall. I would recommend Trouble With Father to anyone who enjoys nostalgia & early sitcoms from this time period.",1316995200,2,674,4.6
