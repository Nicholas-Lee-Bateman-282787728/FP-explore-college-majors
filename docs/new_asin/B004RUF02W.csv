8439269,2,B004RUF02W,"Let me state here uncategorically that, to me, Holst is a first class composer -- genius personified. But this video is a real mixed bag -- from the great to the what-the-heck-is-that-doing-in-a-video-like-this.

I don't know where to begin. Maybe that's ok since Tony Palmer doesn't either. The first scenes are aerial views of sand dunes accompanied by -- I am not making this up -- Maurice Jarre's Academy Award winning score from ""Lawrence of Arabia"".

The program lacks any resemblance to a coherent timeline. The story of Holst's life is fractured and is formed in any way that strikes the director at the moment. We are presented with one segment of Holst's life and then something way down the line and then back again to something in the middle to some other segment in time. Doctor Who's time-stream makes more sense than this.

There's some good information here but it get's waylaid by flagrant lack of structure and insertion of images of desiccated concentration camp corpses, malnourished children, a nude dancer, an Indian festival, a battling French (?) army, and some industrial mishmash. Odd visual juxtapositions to say the least.

Presentations of orchestral forces is quite good but who are these people and who's conducting what score? The end credits list them but by then they're disembodied from the performances. What and where are these churches? What is the context for these compositions in his life? What music is being performed?

The program dances around The Planets before finally addressing it (almost) properly an hour and a half into the program. During the course of the program we learn about three out of seven pieces. What inspired the form and orchestration of The Planets? We'll leave that for another film.

We are told that neither Vaughn Williams and Holst enjoyed their countryside walks. Later we are told Holst enjoyed countryside walks. What are the facts?

Video quality is uneven. I can understand archival footage being what it is but some contemporary stock footage is sub-par. Choirs and orchestras and churches and recent interview segments are quite good but some other footage -- not so good. Archival 4:3 images are stretched out to fill the 16:9 format rather than perhaps being cropped or inserted using black bars.

Audio is generally good but sometimes uneven. There are no extras.

This might be a good program if were re-edited with some segments deleted and others expanded.

YMMV. I really had hoped to enjoy this program -- but I didn't. Holst deserves better.",1458000000,6,2529,5.014319809069212
8439270,2,B004RUF02W,I thought it would be more of a biography than analysis of his music.  Even if analysis was what I was looking for it's definitely close to an R rating.  The topless dancing girl did not add to my enjoyment and it wasn't a quick scene.,1454716800,3,235,4.086956521739131

8439273,3,B004RUF02W,"I agree completely with  eclipse1960.  The good parts of this film are really nice.  This film is worth it alone for the wonderful interviews with Holst's daughter, Imogen.  Also the film has many live musical excerpts that are very well played, nicely filmed and importantly are quite extended.  Since Holst is mainly known as a one hit wonder it's nice that this doc gives the listener an opportunity to hear the other works many of which are so unfairly neglected.  On the down side a number of the interviewees are downright banal (one person goes on quite enthusiastically about how revolutionary the opening of Mars is since Holst has the strings play col legno!!  Mozart even used col legno, which should give you an idea of how revolutionary it is by the 20 century.).  And at one point the film goes on a ten minute detour about a priest (Conrad Noel) who was a friend of Holst.  In Imogen's bio of her father this guy gets one sentence so I'm not sure why Tony Palmer thinks he deserved 10 minutes in this film.  He suggested a text which Holst set...big deal.  There are other bizarre elements to this film such as during a musical excerpt they'll suddenly cut to footage of nude emaciated men who look like they were just liberated from a WWII concentration camp.  What?  And perhaps the weirdest thing about the film is while the credits are rolling the doc shows footage from a present day military/patriotic celebration accompanied by some very new age-y African folk inspired sounding music.  Totally left me scratching my head.  However, despite these complaints I do recommend this film due to the above mentioned attributes and also due to the total paucity of films regarding Holst.",1400803200,7,1702,4.741496598639456
8439274,4,B004RUF02W,"This film is the only one-stop resource that explains why Gustav Holst is more than the one-hit wonder he seems to be. As a political activist, a musical populist, and a born teacher, and the author of a stunningly original body of work, he casts a larger shadow over the music of the 20th century than most people are aware. The film does a good job of explaining that. Unfortunately, because unneeded segments of violence and nudity make it impossible to use the film in schools, its message will go unheard by those who most need to hear it.",1393027200,7,544,4.505050505050505
8439275,5,B004RUF02W,A story little known but absolutely worth your while.  Just meeting the composer's daughter is reason enough.  Blithe spirits really do walk amongst us.  Maybe the next Mozart is your gym instructor!,1392508800,2,199,5.15625
