3881487,3,B0029WGIDK,"Even though the back of the box says it is copyrighted by Hanna-Barbera, the Plastic Man TV series was made by Ruby-Spears Productions.  Joe Ruby and Ken Spears created Scooby Doo for Hanna-Barbera and left to start their own studio.  At their own studio, the made Plastic Man, Fang Face, Rickety Rocket and a series of Puppy specials.  I worked there in the cel painting department.  The person in charge of the cel painting department posted funny cels from the cartoons on her door.  Once when Plastic Man was tied up from head to foot so he couldn't stretch his arms or legs, all he could stretch was his nose.  She posted a cel overlay that just had Plastic Man's nose stretching out with a round cheeks on either side of it.  You can probably imagine what this drawing looked like.  (If you can't, just email me and I will draw it for you).  This flesh colored drawing in isolation had viewers who passed the door to her office laughing for a week.  After the laughter died down, I made it last for another week by adding a caption to the drawing of the stretched out nose, ""Excellent example of rotoscoping"".",1255219200,3,1115,4.502487562189055
3881488,3,B0029WGIDK,"Here's the reality check: we are discussing a cartoon from the late seventies/early eighties with a laugh track. This isn't like Animaniacs or Invader Zim or Spongebob or Bakshi's Mighty Mouse where you appreciate all the humor that goes over the heads of kids. It's entirely kid's stuff, and creatively-limited kid stuff at that.

The show resorts to formulas typically found in Hanna-Barbera or Ruby-Spears cartoons of that era. In this series, Plastic Man is a government agent...or something. He answers to a mission-dispensing authority called ""The Chief"", identical to so many other cartoon crimefighters (e.g. Superfriends, Super Globetrotters, Birdman, Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kids), and is accompanied on those missions by a couple of useless cronies that don't seem to contribute anything to his efforts, and are often completely detrimental. You never get any background on how any of this developed. You don't even get a catchy theme song that ezplains the show's premise.

At least in this first season, the show sticks to fighting superciminals. And that's a good move, because they're a bizarre bunch--Half-Ape, the Weed, Disco Mummy, Computerhead, the Clam, and other oddities represented the only real area where the show's creators exhibited any fresh ideas.

In season two, the show really takes a nosedive. The prevailing wisdom at the time was that the best way to keep a cartoon fresh is to either add an anthropomorphicized dog or a precocious kid. So, in Plastic Man's second season, we get this show's equivalent of Scrappy Doo in the form of Plas's offspring, a mischievous baby named Baby Plas (I'm not sure naming your baby ""Baby"" demonstrates much long-term thinking). Baby Plas gets to have his own adventures, where he does warm and fuzzy stuff like rescure animals and give bullies their come-uppance--in other words, stuff much more boring than fighting bizarre supercriminals. It's a major detraction from the series, much like how the Wonder Twins bored audiences with their teenager-safety-sermon segments.

If you never watched the series when it initially aired, don't expect much. This isn't a precursor to Freakazoid or The Mask. It's pretty tepid.",1254441600,9,2193,5.239316239316239
3881489,5,B0029WGIDK,"There aren't too many cartoons I'd commit to buying a whole season of, but Plastic Man is the exception! If you were a child of the 70s or 80s then you'll hopefully remember this. Nostalgia at it's best! There's Plastic Man with his wit, Hula-Hula with his distinct voice, Penny, the no-nonsense Chief and a whole host of villains.

3881494,3,B0029WGIDK,"Funny how we remember things from our childhood and later find that our minds eyes saw something completely different than what we are seeing now.  That being said, it was still a great cartoon.  Corny? Yes, but it wasn't filling your head with nonsense of buying hundreds of trading cards and the such.  Personally I use cartoons to fill in a lazy day, sick day, or just to fill the void during a nap or while cleaning or getting a home workout.  I wouldn't call it a the best choice, but it is a good one.",1494806400,3,507,4.25

Sure, the cartoons are a little bit cheesier than the comic books were, and sure they tamed it up a little bit for television and added in a few standard-to-the-era sidekicks, but it's Plastic Man and his show is still as entertaining today as it was when I was six.

3881543,2,B0029WGIDK,"One of the more unique shows of the Ruby-Spears years (the creators of Scooby-Doo), this one likely won't do much for fans of the comic books (it didn't me, anyway). Jack Cole's Plastic Man was always one of the more humorous characters of action-adventure comics, more like Will Eisner's Spirit or something on the order of Mad magazine's writer-artists Kurtzman, Wood, and Davis. The Saturday morning show was a more youth-oriented, dumbed-down version, much like most of this studio's output (see the '88 ""Superman"").",1407628800,,520,5.2023809523809526

I could not believe it was exactly like I recalled-the really great looking ""head"" with the perpetuated frown in between two squared cheeks. It was such a smash, as it reminded me when in 1978-a year ERLIER-I created something strikingly smililar to this which is now published in my book ""DELL"" co 2005. NOW soon to be publicated this year in another story-a bonus story-after another novel, the original story I had actually written and created strkingly similar as this character-even the face and its squared HEAD. COOL, and FAR OUT!
It was a great ""view' down memory lane!!

A rescue one time consists of Penny having hot sauce In the heel of her shoe. Not overly impressive.

Yup Plastic man a father lol! That's why I give this a four star. Should give it a one for miss labeling and not saying which seasons of these great shows!

3881578,3,B0029WGIDK,"The first time I've heard this series was coming to DVD was back in 2009. Let's say it was a good thing I've waited for the price to drop. I don't like the episodes being on PAL format (meaning the pitch was high, and the quality of the picture varied). That's why I gave this review three stars, because of the quality.

I give the series five stars. I enjoyed Plastic Man as a kid through reruns (The Plastic Man Comedy/Adventure Show live action version via syndication) and later, Cartoon Network. All of the first season eps (excluding the preview episode from the '79 ABC Satam preview special) are present. Three second season eps (with ""The Plastic Man/Baby Plas Super Comedy Show"" titles, minus the supporting segments) are present. It's great to add these to my Hanna-Barbera collection (Yes, this series was produced by Ruby-Spears, NOT Hanna-Barbera).

Either way, enjoy the DVD's.",1338336000,9,893,4.868421052631579

3881581,5,B0029WGIDK,"Although I am saddened there are no Baby Plas episodes here, that's not to say there won't be a set release of those exclusively or Plastic Family episodes down the road. Then the whole series as a set. Eventually. What I like about this show, which I've lovingly owned on DVD since 2009, is that it gives a unique take on a character that's not given the love of Batman or Superman in the DCU. Plastic Man here reminds me of a comedic, superhero version of Magnum P.I. Or an island version of Inspector Gadget. He does the whole investigation bit but somewhere in that he finds time to let of steam by cracking jokes. Outside The Flash, Plastic Man is the most wholesome character in all the DCU to get the cartoon treatment. Booster Gold and Blue Beetle appearances on Batman: The Brave and The Bold notwithstanding. And Plas is the only one to get his own exclusive DVD set! That's gotta account for something, huh? HUH?! =  Nudge, nudge, ;) ;) B-) :D Someday I'd love to see a live-action Plastic Man movie! Apparently he works better on the islands than in the city. With those glasses its easy to see why. He's just wacky enough that he'd blend right in with Tokyo and the Anime cosplay crowd.",1319068800,,1199,4.45
3881582,4,B0029WGIDK,"A long time ago the voice over guy used to say this to open the episodes: ""From out of the pages of DC Comics comes the world's newest and greatest super-hero: Plastic Man! He can spring. He can stretch. He can fly. He can bounce. He can change his shape. And... he can even dance...""

Because of that sense of silly so inherent in Plastic Man, not many people realize just how friggin' powerful the guy is. He's just about invulnerable and his ridiculously malleable rubbery form can shape shift into anything. That is serious, serious mojo. Imagine if petty crook ""Eel"" O'Brien hadn't decided to switch sides and become a crimefighter? The Elongated Man and Mr. Fantastic have got nothing, compared to Plastic Man's tool box. Really, other than the most powerful of supers and supernaturals out there, who can take Plas down?

Of course, creator Jack Cole set the tone from jump, establishing Plastic Man as a humorous character, and this perfectly transitioned him into Saturday morning cartoons. I used to love watching him on Saturday mornings so long ago. His world was topsy-turvied some to make him even more accessible to kids. Plastic Man, in his cartoon, is a fully deputized government agent, receiving his assignments from the smoking hot Chief. He flies around in a plane that resembles his costume. Plas also has his two friends to help him/get underfoot in his various missions. Southern blonde bombshell Penny has a thing for Plas (although, early on, Plas seems oblivious to this). Penny is there probably mostly to offset certain assumptions. I mean, our guy strolls around in a red leotard, know what I mean? But Plas and Penny eventually do get married and have a kid, Baby Plas. Meanwhile, his sad sack Polynesian sidekick, Hula-Hula, sounds and acts and even kinda looks likes Lou Costello. Hula-Hula was one of the minorities the show had to choose from the network's list. Else, we maybe would've seen Plas's long-time comic book pal, Woozy Winks.

THE PLASTIC MAN COMEDY ADVENTURE SHOW, man, this show was so much fun when I was a kid. I did sort of think it'd be asking too much for the high muck-a-mucks to release a DVD set which also collects the segments featuring Baby Plas, the Plastic Family, Mighty Man & Yukk (a particular favorite!), Fangface, and Rickety Rocket. Anyway, part of the fun used to be trying to figure out which item on the screen is actually Plas in disguise (you always looked for that tell-tale red color; it's the only thing that kept him from being the perfect chameleon). Plas's rogues gallery is pretty wild, too. The Weed. Half-Ape. The Clam. Disco Mummy. That heinous genie of the lamp, Badladdin. They all fall in perfect for the cartoon's trademark broad humor. Plastic Man and slapstick go together like Saturday mornings and cartoons. But, one of these days, someone will write a dark, dangerous Plastic Man story and eyes will be opened. If Plastic Man were a villain, he'd be one scary mother. Oh, if only Alan Moore were still writing comics.

PLASTIC MAN - THE COMPLETE COLLECTION has the entire 35 episodes on 4 discs and with the following bonus material: ""PLAS-tastic: A Brief History of Plastic Man"" is a retrospective exploring the backstory of Plastic Man from his comic book origins to his move from Quality Comics to DC and his various incarnations on television (00:14:07); and ""Puddle Trouble,"" the unaired pilot episode commissioned in 2006 for a new Plastic Man animated series that never materialized (00:10:06).

3881585,4,B0029WGIDK,"I've waited forever for this to hit DVD. A h. school grad of 79, my first 2 years were loaded w/ Partying Friday nites, followed by coffee drenched hungover Saturday mornings watching cartoons till I reawoke. No Saturday morning was complete w/o ""Looney Tunes/Bugs Bunny"" and ""Plasticman."" You couldn't have 2 more contrasting cartoons, their humor and approach are completely different, but got gut busting laughs from me just the same. For me, it was a show canceled long before it could pick up steam, and a following. But, this DVD is not complete w/o the Adventures of Baby Plas. As much as I've waited for this to hit DVD, I won't buy until those segments are included. To exclude them is a travesty. While Hanna Barbara comparisons aren't totally inaccurate, the spin on this cartoon's super hero routine is more a tongue in cheek wink at the serious super hero cartoons that preceded it, HB's last quality output.",1259625600,5,921,4.79874213836478
3881586,5,B0029WGIDK,"Finally released, this memorable series debuted the villain turned flexible fun bound superhero who could stretch and turn in to anything, do anything, be anything and simply blend in his surroundings and no one would even know he's there.  That was his flex appeal, I remember always wondering cos you'd never know what he'd do next.

This 4 Disc Plastic Man collection is great, it came in a nice sturdy clear plastic case, and retro comic art. Though it doesn't include the baby plas and Plastic Family series, hope it's released soon, this original 35 episode collection is hilarious to watch.",1259107200,,597,4.900990099009901
3881587,5,B0029WGIDK,"Plastic-Man began as a comic in 1941 that told the story of a crook named Eel O'Brien who was gunned down in a chemical factory as he fell into chemicals with that stuff seeping into his wounds and skin. The chemicals alter his body chemistry, DNA and Bone structurs making him flexable, stretchable, bendable and that kind of thing as it makes him a Genie-like person who can shape his shape, body and makes him into a superhero known as Plastic-Man as he fights many evil-doers and save the world.

The comic was an instant success as it blended Mad Magazine type of wacky humor with superheroism, later on in the 60's Plastic-Man was aquired by DC comics and would soon be part of the Justice League as of today. In 1979 Ruby-Spears (Makers of the 80's Alvin and the Chipmunks cartoon) would make a successful saturday morning cartoon on NBC that was one of their highest rated shows and became a cult fave. The show featured the voices of Michael Bell, Melody Britt, Hal Smith, Frank Welker, Janet Waldo, Peter Cullen, Alan Oppenheimer and many other well known voice actors including Key Luke. The show became ""The Plastic-Man Comedy Adventure Show"" which had a few original characters to help him like sexy Penny, bad luck ridden comical character Hula and gorgeous boss known as The Chief and some original villains with a few DC ones.

""The Diabolical Dr. Dome"" is about a dome-headed bad guy who wants Plastic-Man to be blamed for bad things that he didn't commit, next ""Honey Bee"" is about a lovely villainess who wants to control the insects of the world.

3881589,4,B0029WGIDK,"the title isn't as true as it would leave it to believe as while it does has the complete season 1 of Plastic man I don't see anything among the episode listings for the baby plas or plastic man family cartoons being listed for the set which does disapointed me. even though last couple episodes does use Plasticman baby plas comedy show credits.  Plasicman was a super hero who was originally created in 1940s by Quality comics and later bought by DC when the company went under. Th special features of the set shows the original direction the show was going to go for and I'm glad it didn't.  While I never read the original 1940s version of the comics I never liked the solo Plasticman comics that DC put would with his over weight side kick Woozie.  The cartoon series is a far improvement with Plasticman having constant contact with his female chief who sends him on missions, a jealous Penny who wanted Plasticman all to herself. While Hula Hula has some what the body of Woosie the addition of super bad luck that like Jinx bad luck from Teen titans but he can't control makes the series far better than the show and glad for Warner brothers release to allow me to see this classic 80s favorite of mine.",1255996800,2,1211,4.470588235294118
3881590,4,B0029WGIDK,"Dang! Why are some of these reviews so damned bitter? We are talking about a cartoon, right? A cartoon that entertained millions of viewers every week on ABC? We're not talking about someone that just bombed an abortion clinic are we?

First, to correct some of the information, this series was produced by Ruby-Spears Enterprises, not Hanna-Barbera. If the back of the box states Hanna-Barbera, it's simply because the Ruby-Spears library of programming was absorbed into TimeWarner and for legalities, it's under the Hanna-Barbera umbrella.

I remember watching this cartoon, and while I never thought it was up to the superior standards of an HB product, it did have its moments and is worth purchasing if for no other reason, than to relive your childhood memories. People just love to trash Hanna-Barbera, and Ruby-Spears but I dare any of you to compare their product with anything that Filmation or DIC put out.

My only complaint about this set, is that it isolates the ""Plasticman"" segments and does not include the other cartoons that were a part of ""The Plasticman Comedy Adventure Hour"": ""Rickety Rockey,"" ""Mightyman and Yukk"" and ""Fangface."" I would have loved to see the entire block included. As it stands now, it probably won't happen. Oh well, that's why God invented Boomerang.",1255996800,30,1295,5.042056074766355
