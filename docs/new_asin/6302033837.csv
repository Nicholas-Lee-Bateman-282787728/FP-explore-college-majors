419401,4,6302033837,"Even though CAGED WOMEN, Mattei's other prison flick, had better music and better lesbian soft-core scenes, this one takes the cake in the trashiest atmosphere yet.  Right off the bat you feel immersed in the pure sleaze of this movie, complete with clantily clad women mouthing some of the dumbest dialog I've heard.  The film essentially picks up, however, when Gabriele Tinti and 3 other male inmates escape from a prison escort and take a guard (Carlo De Mejo from CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD and TERROR EXPRESS) and the warden (Lorraine De Selle from CANNIBAL FEROX) hostage.  The following half-hour or so, in which the male con's brutalize and rape the female prisoners is completely hallinatingly dirty.  Luigi Ceccerelli's piano music and some weird attempts by Mattei to get some Dario Argento-ish lighting help the atmosphere out a little, and there's plenty of action and gore to keep most fans of the genre awake.  The best part hands down has a girl blowing her brains out after a game of Russian roullete -right all over Gabriele Tinti's face while he laughs gleefully!
Genre fans should also watch for Jacques Stany and Laura Gemser, who used to be a big porno sensation worldwide.  One of the pseudonyms for this film was EMANUELLE ESCAPES FROM HELL and Gemser's character is named ""Emanuelle"", but other than that there is little or no relation to any of the other Emanuelle films I've seen.  Mattei's subsequent efforts were by far less polished and original, though some of them so laughable (like ROBOWAR, ZOMBIE 3, and COP GAME, that they remain outrageously entertaining.
I urge most fans of sleaze and depravity to check this one out.",972172800,29,1654,4.864768683274021

419553,3,6302033837,"WOMEN'S PRISON MASSACRE opens w/ a stage play about -what else?- life in prison. Emanuele (Laura Gemser) is the lead actress, and she's under the heavy scrutiny of prison security. She's also on the last nerve of her rival, Albina, who insults Emanuele and challenges her to an arm-wrestling match! Suddenly, we're taken to the showers, where the female inmates can't keep their hands to themselves! So, obviously, it's time for the fascistic femme-guards to use their aquatic torture techniques. These guards are awful! They're nasty! They're available! Poor Emanuele falls prey to their relentless abuse. Oh, the horror! These guards laugh at her agony! Thankfully, Emanuele is tougher than they think! She's actually a reporter, framed by a drug dealer. Next, we're introduced to one of the inmates' blow-up ""boyfriend"". Yikes! Meanwhile, a group of infamous murderer / rapists -of the male persuasion- are being transported to the men's penitentiary, Oh no! They're forced to go to the women's prison instead, after a brazen assault on the police van! Upon their arrival, these terrible men take two femme-guards hostage, killing one by throat biting! They soon take over the whole place. Can Emanuele figure a way out of this mess? She'd better hurry, since these hairy beast-men have become pretty popular w/ the ladies! WOMEN'S PRISON MASSACRE isn't unwatchable, but it's soft-core cheeeze-factor is extremely high! Those unaccustomed to such idiotic fare might find that their brains have crystalized by film's end.

It seems obvious that the guys who designed the cover had never seen the movie.  Made on a budget that would nt cover the cost of making a 2 minute TV comercial this film was just a complete bore. No graphic violence to speak of and the nudity, often the backbone of this kind of film, was also non existance.

7820307,4,6302033837,"Only someone who was in junior high when cable was first becoming a ""thing"" can remember the sense of excitement when you learned that Cinemax, Showtime, or HBO was having one of their ""free preview weekends"" and, when you checked the *TV Guide,* an ""Emmanuel"" movie was coming on one night at 2 am.

Not every ""Emmanuel"" movie was great - but if you were a junior-higher, let's just say that you weren't watching them for their literary value.  Having said that, when you take a great number of them for what they were, they were good, and better than any of the self-righteous Leftist drivel that is being shown in movie theaters since the 90s.

""Emmanuel"" movies were, to start with, ""B"" movies (if not ""C"" movies).  Nevertheless, they were often based upon a literary manuscript and, of course, contained what every junior higher wanted a little bit more of (because, contrary to popular opinion, MTV really didn't show that much and no, ""Charlies Angels"" did not show the girls nude):  Sex.

This particular film is decadent.  If I had known how decadent, I probably would not have watched it.  Having said that, if you can get past the first seven minutes or so (which not only are grotesquely badly acted, but seem to have little connection to the actual story), eventually, a yarn begins to emerge that is engrossing in a decadent 70s foreign film kind of way.  I confess, I got sucked into the story, and while not significantly different from any ""women's prison"" tale, it works.  And in my opinion, it works well.  This is definitely one of the best representatives of the ""women's prison/sexploitation/is that the real Emmanuel or are they just using the name as a marketing ploy?/Cinemax shows 'C' movies because we aren't trying to compete with HBO"" kind of genre.  Really.  One of the best.

The overacting is extreme, the violence is gratuitous, and the political incorrectness reaches levels of majesty unimaginable to the modern snowflake.  The villains are properly demonic.  The sexual content (not all of which is nude) appears designed specifically to titillate the junior high male.  What's not to love?  This is the kind of engrossing naughtiness that was commonplace when the world still had a little sense about it: before ""entertainment"" became yet one more excuse to push Marxism down the throat of the general population.",1526169600,,2350,4.86180904522613
