6256718,2,B00IC13UEM,"This movie starts with a terrible story line, it has shoddy film work in what seems to be an attempt at making the movie look stylish, overall just hard to watch because it had no substance or aesthetic value. I stopped watching half way through so who knows if it gets better.",1426982400,,277,4.346153846153846
6256719,2,B00IC13UEM,"Real bad sound and visual effects.  I think somebody borrowed mom's camcorder.  Some of the guns would flash when fired some didnt.  For no reason at all the film would keep cutting to scenes of metal bands(possibly the worst part).  ""Oh you thought that was crazy look at this cut scene from a rock concert that we already showed you twice!).  Now the plot...  I have no f****y clue i really don't sorry.  I would not recomend this movie.  Overseas maybe this was a big hit.  But for me you are going to have to develope your characters a little more before I give a s**t that they are dead.  Acting was good.  Maybe a more enjoyable experience for a younger audience.  That's my two cents.",1424563200,2,691,4.396825396825397
6256720,2,B00IC13UEM,Bought it specifically because there was supposed to be a fight scene with Sheamus (Stephen Farrelly) in it.  Guess it was edited out of the US version.  The film itself was pretty mediocre.,1419984000,2,190,4.7272727272727275
8640764,4,B00IC13UEM,"Entertaining the whole way through. If you like crazies with UK accents (like I do) watch it. Not the easiest movie to follow, despite to whom it's narrated. (You'll have to watch to see what I mean, can't  ""spoiler""!). The characters all look and speak quite alike, and the flashbacks and continuity of the makeup (read: the blood on their faces) make it hard to follow without some concentration (I admit, if I wanted to engage my brain I'd be reading a book, not watching a movie). Regarding the characters' speech; whoever subtitled this did a terrible job. I watch the Irish/Scottish/Cockney movies with captions on to avoid going back (""What'd he say?"") and with this one I understood the wording in almost every place the subtitler put ""unintelligible""; and there were many words they transcribed wrong (like every 5-10 minutes). There was no slang that made me pause to Google (thinking of ""Lock, Stock...""), which was almost weird in this type movie.
I thought it was well-edited and the cinematography was actually fresh and not overly derivative, a tough task nowadays.",1496102400,2,1080,4.934065934065934

8640767,1,B00IC13UEM,"Such a boring first five minutes I didn't bother to watch the rest of the movie. Instead I decided to train my cat to River Dance, which he learned quite well, and I put on some Pogues, slammed numerousl shots of good Irish whiskey, fashioned a St. Patrick costume out of a Hefty trash bag and a mop, and recreated his driving the snakes out of Ireland although the snakes were substituted by the customers of a grocery store and Ireland was substituted by the local Piggly Wiggly that has been giving me a hassle because of one bounced check and an unfortunate pants falling off incident along with a cantaloupe molestation but I still maintain that was how I see if it is ripe, so, as I felt that, being St Patrick, and have driven all of the snakes out of Ireland and, being still shagged out from checking the ripeness of every cantaloupe in Piggly Wiggly, decided to try misdirection and deception by instructing my cat to start River Dancing when the police entered the fray all to no avail. It sure would have been a better time if the darn film editor just cut the ten minute opening credits down to three..",1474156800,,1115,4.443902439024391
