8111110,5,B000EM8W9K,"I visited Mt. Vernon back in the 1980's before anything in video was available.  The best a person could get back then was a small number of pages book in the gift shop.  This video is one of the best put out by Finley Holiday.  The photography is excellent, covers all major points of interest, & gives interesting history.  It also covers sections of Mt. Vernon not available to the public.  It's a great way to relive one's trip, or view if you've never been there.",1244592000,11,468,4.395348837209302
