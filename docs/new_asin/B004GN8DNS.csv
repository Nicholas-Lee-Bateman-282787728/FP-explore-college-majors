8428891,5,B004GN8DNS,"The Australian documentary about a man and his quadraplegic wife whom he married after her stroke that left her totally immobile is astounding and a salute to men, to what they can be. There is extended family involvement who helps them care for sheep and cut timber, but he is the main caregiver and his wife had her stroke when she was pregnant and before they were married, so by Grace she had a perfect baby and they married in spite of her condition. Then ten years later they had another baby boy that she breast feeds. In order to make money the man built a brothel with help and took his wife to it so he could work nights there and not leave her alone. Tho she cannot speak she can give clues so communion does take place between the two of them. The brothel was not successful, but while it was trying to be, the women would help out and were shown in a very positive light. His trouble was that he could not see women as animals that need to be worked like such, so eventually he lost two hundred thousand dollars and moved the house, put half of it onto his house and used the oher on another parcel of land. In the beginning, you wonder if you can stand it and by the end you are proud of mankind and lifted up to see such people and how they live and how much they love each other and their lot in life. He went back to work the land which is what he loves anyway and how I wished that I could order this and have it play in American machines, but I can't evidentally. Anyone who has a chance to see this, will come away richer for having done so and I would love for them to do more so I can see how the boy turns out, he helps his dad on the farm and how his wife, who was a nurse, made out. Truly, this is what chuch should be, only with humor and joy. Astonding film.",1340236800,,1785,4.030985915492958
