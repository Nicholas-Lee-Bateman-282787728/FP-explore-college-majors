2924762,4,B000URDEAG,"This movie is under rated! Forget anything about the story line or acting. If you are a student of film,
look at the camera shots, angles, edits etc. Very, very good. Cro cop's acting could could use a little
more mentoring, but for a professional fighter, he was very good. The other actors were up to par.

The only real problem I had with this movis was the violence in the church at the ending. If you like
Croatia, buy this movie and work a little to understand what went into making it!!

2924763,5,B000URDEAG,"The movie has a great plot and the acting ill keep you on edge. I am sure that a sequel is in the making. Rumor of an inside source says that Jennefer Anniston and Robert Wagner will co star with Cro Cop. The sequel will most likely be called '' Packing heat in San Francisco ''. My favorite scence in Ultimate Force is when Cro Cop chases a bandit down the block while carrying a bag of groceries. you can tell that he did all the work without a stunt man. I won't say more, make sure you get this flick its worth it.",1302307200,,518,3.9903846153846154

It is without a doubt the worst acted, worst directed, worst written and worst filmed so-called movie I have ever seen in my life and I have seen alot of bad movies. It's a travesty that this was even released on Blu Ray at all. The PQ on this is horrendous! I just wish I could give this zero stars because I surely would.

Trust me, instead of wasting your money on this thing, put gas in your car or go buy yourself dinner. There are way better things to do with 90 minutes of your life than submit to this.",1211241600,36,545,4.0

2924767,1,B000URDEAG,"This movie has the biggest delta between the description on Amazon and the actual content of the movie. Unlike Hong Kong B movies, this title has not only poor acting, poor lines, and crappy camera work, but also surprisingly bad picture quality. I kept thinking that I could have done a better job with an analog video camera from 1988.

The ""action"" in the movie is bordering on the ridiculous. For example in the opening scene the main character easily overwhelms a half a dozen guards with a suppressed pistol, even though all of the guards were within ten or so yards of each other. This is followed by an execution scene that borders on the comical. And it doesn't get any better.

Short version: save your money.",1204070400,21,719,4.609375
2924768,1,B000URDEAG,"Apart from the weak plot, I find the fighting scenes to be poorly Choreographed, not to mention the acting which leaves a lot to be desired!!
Most importantly, I find it incredible that this piece of junk was actually on 1080p format as the picture and audio qualities were far below that of standard DVD's!!
I actually threw my copy in the GARBAGE after patiently watching the first 15 minutes of this trash. I should have just tossed my $16.95 in the garbage in the first place!!

2924769,2,B000URDEAG,"Dear Amazon:
  The movie ""Ultimate Force"" was a movie made for action/martial arts lovers with a B movie cast and production.  I was expecting better since I bought it in the Blu-Ray DVD format; a bit of a let down.
  The actors are Eastern European and of the old Soviet Russia extracts; poor acting by unknown actors in other words.  The color quality is very poor, but plenty of action from start to finish for all the action pack lovers.

Looking for a lot of CGI to knock your socks off? This is NOT it!
Are you hungry for death and mayhem? This is NOT it!

So then what is Ultimate Force about and why have I given it 4 stars?

Despite the fact that the soundtrack tends to drown out the audio
feed of the dialogue between the characters in this film, it is quite
possible to watch this movie without any sound and be able to
understand just what is going on!!

So just what is going on? This is a well developed but plainly
developed film that explores the human psyche and those forces
that affect or influence it.

And in the end that basic need that underlies our reality is
finally rooted out for all to see!!

So should you watch this? How patient are you?
Are you interested in character development? Or are you
more interested in being overwhelmed by action sequences
and staggering consequences?

Perhaps if you are young and in a hurry you will be unable
to savor this presentation? If you have the time to just sit
and watch and see what is happening then maybe it might
work for you. The message is plain. The presentation is
basic so as to emphasize that message.

2925138,3,B000URDEAG,"Not the greatest movie, not the worst.  Usual suspects and betrayals.  It seemed like they took a street fighter game and turned it into a movie",1392422400,,144,4.5
2925139,1,B000URDEAG,"I couldn't get past the first 15 minutes it was just that bad. Its a shame that prime doesn't give us access to better movies, not the latest blockbuster but good movies that you can watch on AMC, FX or regular TV for free.",1392336000,,223,4.090909090909091

2925141,1,B000URDEAG,"I couldn't make it past the 2nd ""fight to the death"" scene. It was just too terrible. Released in 2005? Did they film in the 80's and decide to release it? Video quality is terrible, acting is amateurish at best and the dialog is bleh. Sharknade in all of it's ridiculousness was much better.",1391904000,,292,4.425925925925926

2925143,1,B000URDEAG,"Don't waste your time with this one. It completely sucked all the way through. And they had the gall at the end of the movie to say they would be making a second one? They should save their money and put it to something useful. This doesn't even rate high enough to make it a ""B"" movie. If I said it was a ""B"" movie, I'd be giving it way too much credit. Believe me, IT SUCKED!",1391472000,,377,3.909090909090909

2925157,1,B000URDEAG,"Sphinx (Mirko Cro Cop Filipovic) is an assassin, one that was ""made"" like Jason Bourne. He is a rather large and ominous person dressed in black, clearly the assassin in the room. He has a pet rat which he seems to care for in a bad ""gerbil"" sort of way. After he fails to kill a woman witness, he is sent off to an island where he exhibits some of the worse on screen kick boxing since Pam Grier stopped making films.

You might find parts of the film funny for the wrong reason. I thought the metal soundtrack and basic plot outline were passable, they just couldn't do anything with it.

8214585,5,B000URDEAG,"Absolutely top-notch! Although the dialog is limited, these non-native English speaking actors deliver with force and feeling. The action scenes speak for themselves, and well. (There is one apparently ironic ""magic magazine"" scene, but Filipovozic keeps checking his mags thereafter in the film.)
It seems we have to look outside the Americas these days to find actresses who are very fit, and very sexy: Madarevic is a blue-eyed, honey blond who is very fit, and not covered in grotesque tattoos. Worth your time right there!
For those who don't know, Filipovic is an accomplished UFC fighter, and a natural action hero.",1506643200,,622,5.1683168316831685
