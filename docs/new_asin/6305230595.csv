7886093,4,6305230595,"Zhor's Magical Tour of The Ancient Art of Belly Dance is a colorful, and beautiful display of Male Belly dance. It covers basic break downs of belly dance technique including basic arm positions, positions of the feet, Hip undulations and stomach isolations. Zhor presents a couple of dance pieces that are amazing and unique. I was amazed with the transitions of his movements and the simple grace that he demonstrates effortlessly.

Zhor's video is one that I would recommend to anyone interested in the Art of Belly dance.",1115510400,,525,4.965909090909091
7886094,1,6305230595,"This poor video is so pathetic it isn't even very funny. Zhor apparently has had some ballet lessons, but that's about all that can be said for his dance ability. His ""teaching"" is incoherent - we couldn't even figure out what moves he thinks he's teaching, much less how he thinks you're supposed to do them.
Also, he looks like Data the Android all dolled up for a boys night out. Not what I want to see.
Highlight of the video is when he tucks his sword into a roll of pudge on his belly and stands up - into the same hunched pose my dog assumes when she's about to heave on the living room rug.
Zhor means well, and seems like a nice guy, but he's not a great dancer and based on this video, he's a terrible instructor.  But he does seem like a very pleasant person!",1038182400,,770,4.133333333333334
7886095,2,6305230595,"The real title of this video is Zhor's Magical Tour Of The Ancient Art Of Bellydance.  Reviewer K. Allison writes, ""I'm a sweetheart, so I guess I'll start by saying that my copy of this video won't soon see the trashcan. It's just too much fun. As we all dearly know, bellydancing can be the sexiest of stuff. Not so, however, in the hands of Zhor. For one thing, he might lay off the baba ganoush this Christmas. But like most white, male belly dancers from Chattanooga, Zhor means well and we sure do love him for it. That said, be forewarned: learning a single dance move from this 30 minute flurry of inanity would require the most exotic agility with the remote control. And don't forget your breathing exercises for holding back the yuks. Not recommended.""",972777600,4,763,4.569343065693431
