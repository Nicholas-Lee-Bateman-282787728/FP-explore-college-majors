8386651,4,B00316DDYU,I got this for my granddaughter who is 2 1/2 years old.  I was looking for something for her to watch and try to follow.  The music attracted her before I could call her to the TV to watch the DVD.  She just started trying to copy what she saw.  I had the parts playing where they were already doing ballet as opposed to teaching the individual steps.,1365984000,,351,4.117647058823529
8386652,1,B00316DDYU,"I had a different idea of what this DVD would be.  It has a young girl on the cover and 80+ minutes of instruction but, the actual ballet instruction for kids is maybe around 25 minutes.  The other hour just watching older dancers, learning about point dance and the shoes.  Its almost like a documentary, so your little primaballerina will find most of this boring.  The actual instruction is being interpretted into english and doesn't really give you comprehensive instruction on the ballet moves.  If your child is already in ballet then it might make more sense to them, but I'm not sure if they will find if fun and once you've watched it once, most likely they'll never want to watch it again.",1325030400,9,700,4.612903225806452
