8442506,5,B0000XO68E,"I have worked my way through the Par and Birdie Levels of Roberts' series and am now ready to embark on the much more strenuous Eagle Level.  Katherine Roberts delivers exactly what she promises--a feeling of increased well-being and improved golf.  She takes her students carefully through a series of increasingly difficult poses, explaining in detail both the poses themselves and their benefits to a golfer.  Unlike some other yoga instructors, she does not assume that her students are human Gumbis.  She constantly urges them to go slowly and work at their own pace.  If they are not capable of attaining a pose to perfection, she counsels them to do as much as they can and to avoid strain.  I particularly appreciate that her pace and her manner are reassuring and non-threatening. You feel that you are in the hands of a friendly and supportive mentor.",1194825600,3,861,4.863013698630137
8442507,2,B0000XO68E,"Katherine Roberts seems like a nice, well-intentioned lady, genuinely interested in helping golfers. Her PAR, BIRDIE, and EAGLE level Yoga for Golfers tapes and DVDs are minimalist at best. There really is very little there. I would highly recommend Yoga for Inflexible People or Vinyasa Flow Yoga. These programs are filled with VASTLY more help,information, and instruction at less cost. Or, if you are really serious about helping yourself, look up a local Yoga instructor and have them guide you for a few dollars more.",1091836800,4,523,5.1647058823529415
