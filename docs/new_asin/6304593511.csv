900580,5,6304593511,"The quality of this DVD is amazing. An 18 year old Sophia was precise and convincing in her ""lip sync"" of the great Renata Tebaldi. Her acting phenomenal. This is a treasure.",1248393600,4,174,4.46875
900581,2,6304593511,"A disclaimer at the start of the video says that this DVD has been assembled from surviving sources and is the best available. Really? Was there some sort of opera-lovers' witch hunt, destroying all a but a few extant prints? From the look of what remains there might have been a good-to-great film of Aida somewhere in the dark past, but its hard to tell from what is presented here.

Editing seems to have been performed with a hatchet and scotch tape by a blind, tone-deaf drunkard.

What remains of the music is sung by as good a cast as one might have assembled anywhere in 1951. Tebaldi is in her glory years; Stignani, a veteran by then, shows no sign of decline; Campora was secure and Becchi in fine form. What little of the chorus we get to hear is solid, and the orchestra is fine.

The sets and costumes are Hollywood-style sumptuous and nearly as tacky as you could get, and additional scenes have been staged and music composed and arranged for battle scenes that aren't in the opera.

If you are looking for a video of Verdi's masterpiece DO NOT BUY THIS!

If you are an opera queen looking for a campy party tape, this might do the trick. (The actor playing Radames is pretty enough and there are plenty of hunky shirtless extras in miniskirts to fuel the replay button.)

If you collect cinematic or operatic ephemera, this is for you. Sophia Loren fans will want it, too.",1238284800,,1389,4.492063492063492
900582,3,6304593511,"I'm disappointed. It is not what I expected. Aida is a great Opera with many choir sequences. In this film many choir arias are avoided. The opera is shortened.

900583,3,6304593511,"Everything the other reviewers have said is true, so there's not too much to add.  I will say, however, that I was impressed with the sets and costumes, which were far more sumptuous (albeit tacky) than I had expected.  And Loren and Maxwell (what bizarre casting!) are fabulous lip-synchers and throw themselves into their roles with passion and tremendous energy.  Unlike the supremely wooden Luciano Della Marra, the ladies look as if they could actually be singing.  No, Verdi doesn't quite survive, despite Tebaldi and Company, but one has to believe that the filmmakers had their hearts in the right place, as their respect and affection for the material is palpable in every frame.  Given the noble idea of bringing opera to a wider audience, the fact that this ""Aida"" isn't very good is almost beside the point.",1204502400,6,819,4.905797101449275
900584,2,6304593511,"This is strictly a curiosity item.
Nineteen year old Sofia Loren looking lovely in dark body makeup and frizzy wigs plays the Ethiopian princess with the voice of the great Renata Tebaldi; and Lois Maxwell, yes, Lois Maxwell nine years before she became Miss Moneypenny in the first James Bond movie Dr. No(She went on to play the same character in 14 of the Bond films.)plays the Egyptian princess Amneris with the voice of Ebe Stignani, one of the leading mezzosoprani of the first half of the 20th century.
If you are a movie buff and/or an opera buff, (I am both!) you may enjoy this DVD, but as I said before, just as a curiosity item.
It's neither a good movie, there are cuts, jumps, blackouts, terrible editing; nor a good opera presentation. The musical score has not been just abridged but simply mutilated.
The only value of this venture is that it's kind of historical in the sense that in one you get two great divas very early in their careers, Loren from the screen and Tebaldi from the opera stage.
There is a voice over narration in English, but the opera does not have subtitles in any language.",1200787200,4,1113,4.54228855721393
900585,2,6304593511,"This historic movie is in bad shape.  Sonically it is 50's bad; visually it is not cleanly transfered; there are major cuts and disjoints.  As an early attempt to present opera on film it is interesting.  The double cast technique actors/singers is difficult at best.  Sophia Loren is beautiful as Aida; and Tebaldi sings it well.  However the whole effort doesn't come off very well.

But if you want a historic recording and sample of how not to do opera on film -- this is it.

Fing a good Aida on DVD is difficult.  The best I have seen so far is the hard to fine EuroArts dvd of Aida from the Festival of St. Margarethen.  The singers were unknown to me as well as the conductor, chorus, and orchestra.  The set, performance, and singing are excellent to extraordinary.  If you can find it buy it.",1163894400,12,802,4.424657534246576
900586,4,6304593511,"I'm a Tebaldi fan so there IS a bias. For 1951 this is an excellent introductory offering. The opera purist can find much to complain about here. The biggest of these would be that gorgeous pieces of music are not included or cut. IF you've never heard Aida in its entirety you probably won't notice. The Tebaldi voice in '51 was at its youthful best -- I have yet to hear ANY singer do ""pianissimos"" the way Tebaldi could!  The story is that of a love triangle that ends with the death of two leaving the third  desperate with self-recrimination.  Sad all around. Aida is in love with Rhadames. Unfortunately so is Amneris the Egyptian Princess. And while Aida is an Ethiopian princess she has been captured by Egypt and is Amneris' slave. Both Amneris & Aida are in love with Rhadames an Egyptian warrior.  Rhadames is in love with Aida -- sticky isn't it?  During a pivotal battle Aida's father Amonasro is captured but the captors think they've killed the Ethiopian warrior king. One of my personal favorite parts of Aida is  ""Ma tu oh Re.."" in which Aida pleads for the lives of the captured Ethiopians. In this selection you get only a taste of what the entire selection is like.  Aida & Rhadames plan on escaping to Ethiopia.  Enter Amonasro who having convinced Aida to trick Rhadames into devulging the secret route his soldiers will take for the next battle against Ethiopia announces ""There will my army be!"" As Rhadames is about to flee with Aida to Ethiopia Amneris arrives and accuses him of treason. Rhadames presents his sword to the high Priest while Aida & Amonasro flee.. During the trial Amneris is distraught ""Oh chi l'o salva?"" Who will save him? Rhadames id found guilty and sentanced to be buried alive in the tomb. Meanwile, Aida has made her way into the tomb to die with her beloved Rhadames. Above Amneris prays to the gods to give him (Rhadames) peace. Curtain falls. The major arias are left intact. But I still found myself wishing they had NOT left out ANY of the gorgeous music and singing that abound in this opera. IF you're looking to ""get your feet wet"" this is a very good selection BUT bear in mind that you're not hearing ALL the music. I gave it a 4 because it's incomplete to me AND I would rather have seen Tebaldi than Loren. BUT IT IS A COLLECTOR'S ITEM!!  This one film helped launch the careers of both performers. It's worth having for that alone.",999302400,15,2395,4.538283062645012
7874535,5,6304593511,"This is an old favorite, dating back to college days. Seeing a young, unknown actress (Sophia Loren) is always a treat. Paired with one of the greatest Sopranos of all time,(Renata Tebaldi) it' unbeatable!",1441324800,,205,5.0588235294117645
7874536,3,6304593511,"Lip-synching is a talent unrelated to musical ability.  Here we have actresses Sophia Loren, and Lois Maxwell (i.e., Sean Connery's Miss Moneypenny), neither of which are or were singers in any sense I'm aware of, doing the most natural and convincing lip-synching witnessable in 60+ years of lip-synching.  In the same production we have a couple of old-timer actual opera singers whose lip-synching efforts (to their own voices, no less) are absolutely execrable.  For example, near the end of the opera we have the high priest singing ""Radames!  Radames!  Radames!""  Granted, it is difficult, considering rubato and the nature of unaccompanied entrances.  But the singer begins to move his lips for each ""Radames"" AFTER the soundtrack has completed the entire three syllable utterance.  Three times!  And that is just one example.  The many instances of poor lip-synching makes this epic essentially ... unwatchable.

It's a shame too because this is a true epic picture, of course not on the same level as Ben Hur, but clearly on the spectrum.  And now, I will throw out a controversial suggestion.  IT COULD BE FIXED.  A company like Criterion (not gonna happen, I hear you scream!) which has restored pictures like A Star is Born, and It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World, could work its magic on this Aida and make it far more than adequately enjoyable.  Careful manipulation of soundtrack and possibly video, could clean up many if not most of the lip-synching problems.  And for those not fixable, let the audio run while briefly switching to an alternate scene (such as a repeat of someone else's reaction), or worst case, a brief still shot.  We can tolerate these in Star is Born, and Mad Mad World, so why not here?

Then we will need subtitles throughout (this version only provides subtitles for the brief Italian narration between scenes, which while appreciated, is not really what we like subtitles for).  And then ... voila ... enjoyment the way it was supposed to be enjoyed :)

7874538,4,6304593511,"We lose *musical* detail but gain in *histrionic* detail with wonderful acting by Loren and cast. (Although, when I think of Lucianno's ""Celeste Aida"" and I watch this Geoffrey Hunter-looking dude lip-sync, I have to curb my urge to go for a lemonade).

Loren is incredibly sensual and the 8 millimeter quality of the VHS does not detract at all. (good gosh!). But the actress portraying Queen Amneris is no slouch, neither -(James Bonds') Lois Maxwell. This may be the hottest Opera ever realized.

A Reviewer here noted the makeup used by Sophia Loren here. Not to make skin tone an issue but he has a point: all players are African and to cast Ethiopians as Black and Egyptians as White, is a little strange.

Another oddity: the Triumphal March (sans elephantidae) and with Egyptians marching on the beat.

Yes, the production looks one draft away from "" 'A' movie "" but that element is not really important, unless you are an archeologist.",1373155200,,944,4.773006134969325
7874539,5,6304593511,"I can't comment on the image quality that some reviewers here seem to complain about. I have the Italian DVD,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aida-IMPORT/dp/B0013XSIGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aida - IMPORT</a>(zone 2), and the image quality is excellent. Considerations of image quality aside, this film has come under heavy flak, because of the cuts, the supposedly rough edits (not clear if the reviewer complaining about that is referring to the musical montage or the film editing proper), the kitsch. I think it is a great version of Aida, both for the beginner and the cognoscento.

Sure, it is heavily cut. It doesn't purport to be the complete operatic Aida, it is a cinematographic adaptation, trimmed down to feature-film length. And when David Lean films Pasternak's Doctor Zhivago or King Vidor Tolstoi's War and Peace you don't expect the film the run the week or month it takes you to read the novel, do you? Here, it is not just that some whole numbers are cut, with especially the finale of Act I reduced to a few seconds (other than its ballet of priestresses): there are also many slashes within the duets, trios and Finale of Act II, some of them huge, or some get interrupted (way) before their operatic end to segue into the next scene. This editing is usually stylishly done and the transitions from one scene to the next are very cleverly managed, and if you don't know the opera well you are likely not to notice the seams (and some of them even if you do know the opera well). But to be honest, a few are very perceptible, and jarring. Note also that the two great arias, ""Celeste Aida"" and ""Ritorna vincitor"" are sung complete (not ""Patria mia"" alas), and the final scene is complete from the ""immense Ftah"" chorus and Aida's line ""triste canto"".  All the ballets are also played complete and danced - the ""Sacred Dance of the Priestesses"" at the end of Act I, the Dance of the little Moorish slaves at the beginning of Act II and the Ballabile in the Finale of Act II. Yeah, it is totally kitsch and campy - but that's also part of the opera, and you must put it to the credit of film director Clemente Fracassi that he didn't cower in front of those setpieces. Incidentally, one reviewer attributes at least part of the choreography to Leonide Massine, but he is not mentioned at all in the opening credits, neither as choreographer nor as dancer: Margherita Wallman is. And, naturally, the opera's signature, the famous triumphal march, is there, complete. Still, when you do know the opera well, some of those cuts are very frustrating because a lot beautiful music is left out - just as some wonderful episodes are left out of the cinematographic adaptations of Dr Zhivago or War and Peace.

But the loss of the music wouldn't be half as frustrating if this Aida wasn't so well sung, at least by its three principals. Both Tebaldi (Aida) and Stignani (Amneris) had recorded it together just the year before for Decca with Alberto Erede (with Del Monaco as Radames,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Guiseppe-Verdi-Aida/dp/B00000421U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Guiseppe Verdi: Aida</a>), but in many aspects this is better. I don't know who conductor Giuseppe Morelli is, but he and the RAI Roma orchestra acquit themselves very competently, where Erede often pulled his Aida down through sluggish tempos and lack of bite. The ballets are even conducted with true verve and dynamism, and the march isn't as vulgar as it can be, and quite convincing as background music to the triumphant return of the Egyptian armies seen not with the ""voluntary suspension of disbelief"" required of an opera staging but as a (admittedly, rather cheap) filmed historical epic set in Ancient Egypt, something like RKO's version of Michael Curtiz' ""The Egyptian"" or Cecile B. DeMille's ""The Ten Commandements"" - and you can easily fancy Mussolini's armies returning from their own conquest of Ethiopia, a few millennia later ""(search on Google ""The Ancient Egypt Film Site"" for more on the topic).

And anyway Aida is an opera of singers more than of conductor. A Karajan won't save a trio of lousy singers, but a trio of glorious singers will make a great performance of Aida, whoever the conductor. Tebaldi is fab - the tonal purity, the ease of delivery draw tears from me, I don't think she has sung it better in her two ""official"" recordings, Erede's and Karajan's in 1959, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verdi-Aida/dp/B000KLRUKC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verdi: Aida</a>). In truth, part of it comes from the fact that the soundtrack runs a semi-tone too high, giving the voice a purer, more girlish timbral quality. For the same reason, Ebe Signani sounds less mezzo-ish than on the Decca recording, maybe not mezzo-ish enough for Amneris, but the voice is differentiated enough from Aida/Tebaldi's, easy and wonderfully enacted. But Giuseppe Campora, singing Radames, isn't, I think, recognized as one of the great tenors of the 20th Century. His Radames is great. He was thirty when he recorded it (and Tebaldi 31 - a perfect match), and he sounds it, the voice is youthful, clear, valiant, easy. The timbre (as heard here, a semi-tone too high) may not be as intrinsically beautiful as Del Monaco's, Bj&ouml;rling's, Corelli's or Bergonzi's, but there is such an adequacy between the vocal color and the juvenile looks of actor Luciano Della Marra that one doesn't even notice. As most tenors he rings out the concluding b-flat of ""Celeste Aida"" rather than sing it pianissimo as Verdi instructs, but his characterization throughout is great (try his ""&egrave; vero &egrave; vero"" in the tomb scene, a phrase that can be ridiculously matter of fact), and whatever he does vocally, even the small sobs in his voice in the opening of the tomb scene that, on a record, might sound too sentimental, make entire sense as acted here by Della Marra.

And that is the whole point of this movie and that is why, added to the fine singing of its three principals, it is so great. This is an Aida in which, for once, the visuals match the singing. So, the actors lip-sync the lyrics, and they do it expertly, to make you believe that they were all Conservatory-trained and read music (in fact, the actor playing Amonasro, Afro Poli, was indeed an operatic baritone, to make one wonder why they took Gino Bechi to sing it and not him). There is a total adequacy of the physical looks, the facial expressions of the three principals, and their respective vocal timbres. In ""Celeste Aida"", hard to think that this very voice is not emanating from this very person, and the youthful loving enthusiasm of Della Marra makes Campora's ringing final b-flat entirely convincing. And how great it is to see these arias, those high notes, those fortissimos, sung with no trace of muscular effort, no mouths hugely gaping, as if they were naturally spoken. Della Marra is also the only Radames I've ever seen who doesn't look utterly ridiculous in an Egyptian mini-skirt.

In truth, Della Marra, beyond his handsome and youthful looks, isn't hugely expressive, but it sits well with the character: straightforward, pure, innocent, nave, entirely un-political, the kind of guy who'd be ready to let the whole world collapse rather than do the slightest compromise - and not even realize it. But with an Aida like dark-skinned Sophia Loren, you really understand why this young general is ready to relinquish fame, honor, glory, power (hey, he's slated to become the next Pharaoh) for this girl. Until then, based purely on voice, I had thought it was for her innocent purity. Well, there is that. But guys, it is also for her HUGE TITS! I'd happily relinquish all that too, for just one night with 19-year old Sophia... And isn't great to have Miss Moneypenny as Amn&eacute;ris. Hey, she was beautiful. And what emanates simply from her eyes... The baneful look she directs at Radames when she starts realizing that something is cooking between him and Aida... James Bond, you're an ass, running after all those Soviet bimbos and being blind to the gem you have right there at the office, just sitting by the hat-hanger (truth is, her boobs don't compete with those of Ursula Andress. That's probably the secret link between Radames and Bond). There's some great acting, too, some of it so subtle that I noticed only on second viewing. When, at the beginning, she asks Radames why that look of noble pride in his eyes and comments that a women would be fortunate to be the cause of such a look, and he answers that he was contemplating an adventurous dream: how obvious it is that, for an instant, she believes - and hopes - that SHE may be that adventurous dream! And then, when he adds that he was hoping to be elected as the chief of the Egyptian armies, the slight - princely Egyptian proprieties do not allow for outward spectacle, I'll say - air of disappointment on her face... Well done, Lois! That said, I find that she acts with not enough fury for the character and a touch of British - I'm sorry, Egyptian - understatement in the 4th Act's Judgment scene, in her anathema hurled at Ramfis and the priests. Small detail.

Still, the great success of this Aida is that even when the voices are no more than average or even less than that, as is the case with the nasal and tremulous Amonasro of Gino Bechi, you hardly notice it because the dramatic presence of the actors conveying those voices make them sound entirely natural. You are not so much listening to (and for) a vocal performance as you are when hearing a disc or even watching the video of an opera production, you are watching a film and those actors simply have the voices they have.

There's some great camera work too. One fine moment is when, during her ""Rintorna vincitor"", Aida sings of her brothers (""vincitor dei miei fratelli""), and the camera show the two-dimensional Egyptian bas-relief on a pillar, before having Sophia enter the image. And the final trio is great, with the visual and sonic focus on Amneris alone, with the voices of Aida and Radames sounding from afar, as if already in heaven, in a Wagnerian transfiguration.

Other editions of the film, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aida/dp/B000HOJTVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aida</a>, do not have English subtitles, just an English voice overdubbing the Italian off-voice narration that summarizes the plot at the beginning of each act, I don't know about this one and nobody here has commented on that. My Italian DVD doesn't have any English subtitles either (I know the opera well enough not to need them), and, thank God, no voice over either. In fact - I shouldn't say this, it's not going to help sales on Amazon - someone has posted the complete Italian version on You Tube, search Verdi Aida Opera Film Sophia Loren. That's how I first viewed it. Well, Amazon, it didn't prevent me from buying the DVD, on the contrary, it prompted me to do so.",1350000000,2,11072,4.961206896551724

And then, when he adds that he was hoping to be elected as the chief of the Egyptian armies, the slight - princely Egyptian proprieties do not allow for outward spectacle, I'll say - air of disappointment on her face... Well done, Lois! That said, I find that she acts with not enough fury for the character and a touch of British - I'm sorry, Egyptian - understatement in the 4th Act's Judgment scene, in her anathema hurled at Ramfis and the priests. Small detail.

Still, the great success of this Aida is that even when the voices are no more than average or even less than that, as is the case with the nasal and tremulous Amonasro of Gino Bechi, you hardly notice it because the dramatic presence of the actors conveying those voices make them sound entirely natural. You are not so much listening to (and for) a vocal performance as you are when hearing a disc or even watching the video of an opera production, you are watching a film and those actors simply have the voices they have.

There's some great camera work too. One fine moment is when, during her ""Rintorna vincitor"", Aida sings of her brothers (""vincitor dei miei fratelli""), and the camera show the two-dimensional Egyptian bas-relief on a pillar, before having Sophia enter the image. And the final trio is great, with the visual and sonic focus on Amneris alone, with the voices of Aida and Radames sounding from afar, as if already in heaven, in a Wagnerian transfiguration.

Some reviewers complain that there are no subtitles and an English voice over the Italian voice that introduces each act and summarizes the plot. Selfishly, this is not a problem for me: I've bought the Italian DVD,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aida-IMPORT/dp/B0013XSIGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aida - IMPORT</a>&nbsp;(zone 2) and I know the opera well enough not to need subtitles. Some also complain about poor picture quality: not on the Italian DVD. In fact - I shouldn't say this, it's not going to help sales on Amazon - but someone has posted the complete video on You Tube, search Verdi Aida Opera Film Sophia Loren. That's how I first viewed it. Well, Amazon, it didn't prevent me from buying the DVD, on the contrary, it prompted me to do so.

Unlike most reviewers, I find this film suited both for the Aida cognoscenti, and as a first introduction to the opera (just as any film can serve as an introduction to the novel from which it derives).",1348358400,9,10784,4.871934604904633
7874541,2,6304593511,"A disclaimer at the start of the video says that this DVD has been assembled from surviving sources and is the best available. Really? Was there some sort of opera-lovers' witch hunt, destroying all a but a few extant prints? From the look of what remains there might have been a good-to-great film of Aida somewhere in the dark past, but its hard to tell from what is presented here.

Editing seems to have been performed with a hatchet and scotch tape by a blind, tone-deaf drunkard.

What remains of the music is sung by as good a cast as one might have assembled anywhere in 1951. Tebaldi is in her glory years; Stignani, a veteran by then, shows no sign of decline; Campora was secure and Bechi in fine form. What little of the chorus we get to hear is solid, and the orchestra is fine.

The sets and costumes are Hollywood-style sumptuous and nearly as tacky as you could get, and additional scenes have been staged and music composed and arranged for battle scenes that aren't in the opera.

If you are looking for a video of Verdi's masterpiece DO NOT BUY THIS!

If you are an opera queen looking for a campy party tape, this might do the trick. (The actor playing Radames is pretty enough and there are plenty of hunky shirtless extras in miniskirts to fuel the replay button.)

If you collect cinematic or operatic ephemera, this is for you. Sophia Loren fans will want it, too.",1298937600,4,1388,4.488095238095238
7874542,4,6304593511,"This is a very interesting movie. Unlike most of the DVDs on sale it is a filmed version of the opera, rather than the recording of a staged opera. I think so much is clear anyway, but I thought I'd mention it in case somebody is in doubt.

So, first the problem: The picture quality is really bad and there are no subtitles. The latter is not such a problem because every scene is introduced by a speaker from the off and a short synopsis of what is to come is given. The picture quality....well is really borderline and drags the movie down. A thorough restoration would be needed.

What about the movie itself? I personally enjoyed it, bearing in mind that it is a Hollywood movie, very much in the style (albeit not the scale) of monumentals such as Spartacus. S. Loren (with a nice tan) looks stunning. In fact, I think she looks better with her artificial black skin color, then she does in reality. She also acts the part well, which is rather rare in opera films.

Summary: If you are into opera-movies, as I am, then this is a must-have. If you are into S. Loren (I am not) then you might consider this film as a curiosity. If you are simply after a good production of Aida, then this DVD is not for you.",1271203200,7,1213,4.288209606986899
7874543,5,6304593511,"This film version of Aida features Sophia Loren at the outset of her career. Besides her stunning beauty, she is totally involved in the character, and her lypsyncing to Renata Tebaldi's voice is very accurate. Luciano della Marra as Radames has the right look, and the singing is dubbed by Giuseppe Campora. Lois Maxwell as Amneris delivers a fine portrayal, and is properly villainous, and convincingly vulnarable towards the end of the judgement scene. Ebe Stignani does the singing. Afro Poli, a reknowned baritone is a striking and powerful Amonasro. His singing is dubbed by the famous Gino Bechi. I'm surprised that Afro Poli does not do his own singing, even though I'm a big admirer of Bechi.

The video quality is very good, although the colors appear to be on the bright side. I recommend this DVD highly.",1271203200,2,816,4.870503597122302
7874544,3,6304593511,"In spite of the heavy make-up to make her look Ethyopian, Sofia - that's how her first name was spelled before Hollywood renamed her Sophia - manages to project a truly moving image of passion (for  her Egyptian lover Radames) and duty (for her imprisoned Ethyopian father). In later years the soprano Renata Tebaldi remembered  the actress as being ... a very shy and simple girl, quite different from the sophisticated woman she later became"".

The score has been somewhat shortened, so what you get is not the complete opera, but about 90% of it. Sets and costumes are quite rich and the second act ""divertissement"" was choreographed by L&eacute;onide Massine.",1267056000,2,663,4.954954954954955
