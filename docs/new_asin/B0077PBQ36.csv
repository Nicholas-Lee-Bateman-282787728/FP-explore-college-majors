5062230,5,B0077PBQ36,I stumbled onto martial arts films about a decade ago and began by watching anything and everything. Eventually I wanted to know more about the genre and how to be more discriminating. This film did the trick. It is an excellent overview with a lot of specifics so that I knew more about what I was seeing. It also pointed me towards many more films and directors worth watching.,1446854400,,379,4.507246376811594
5062231,5,B0077PBQ36,Great documentary for kung fu junkies! And yes-Donnie Yen is interviewed in it.,1444348800,,79,5.153846153846154
5062232,5,B0077PBQ36,Very entertaining Kung Fu movie DVD? The author/narrator does an excellent job of hosting this movie and has lots of great classic Kung Fu scenes. For $7.99 I was very pleased.,1374883200,,176,4.709677419354839
5062233,1,B0077PBQ36,"I bought this movie with great expectations that it will provide a comprehensive overview of all kung fu movies produced within a chronological time-line but it leaves out several notable figures in martial arts cinema while doing a passable job at chronology. If you're interested in kung fu movie guides, there are better that can be found.",1370908800,3,342,5.017543859649122
5062234,5,B0077PBQ36,"Having viewed Cinema of Vengeance and The Art of Action, I was on a quest to find a film that was an update on the current status of the martial arts genre in those two movies' same style, and this is it. A hilarious and fun look into the history of the genre, this film takes its own approach. The normal everyday guy who loves these films wants to tell you about them in everyday speaking and charming animation. I applaud the movie for sticking with this style. Its less formal than any documentary you may ever see, but its completely relatable in the excitement one may have for these movies.

The movie follows the history of martial arts cinema, basically. The Art of Action did a better job of going in chronological order compared to this film, which jumps back and forth in the timeline. This can be excused though since it wants to group everything together that belongs in a certain category. The film's strong point though is that its up to date and covers more than The Art of Action did, being 9 years newer. A lot has happened in the genre and that's what I wanted to see. This film is heavy on using clips from several movies which is great. It gets you interested in some of the films shown.

Some personal highlights for me:
-Seeing Jacky Wu Jing get a mention! He is a very underrated modern star of the genre who deserves more serious roles. Sadly nothing was mentioned about Fatal Contact, an awesome movie that he stars in.
-Showing how Hollywood ripped off Police Story, with side-by-side comparisons to prove it!
-Everything about Bruce Lee was covered, and acknowledged that Bruce-splotation was terrible.

My minor complaints:
-Footage from Legend of the Drunken Master was used instead of Drunken Master II. The former release of the film had dull sound effects, a butchered soundtrack and a changed ending. Even though it was stated once in this film as Drunken Master II, the footage was not of that and was not stated about the American changes.
-Sammo Hung deserved a bigger chunk of the film. He was breezed over and just sort of mentioned. What he has done for the genre is immense.
-Yuen Biao was not mentioned at all! How can you have Jackie and Sammo and no Yuen??
-Woo Ping should of also got his own section of the movie. His contributions to the genre as a director and choreographer are legendary.

For a big martial fan like myself, this movie is a godsend. It is a welcome update to The Art of Action. It makes you appreciate the genre and may get you interested in some new films you haven't seen. To any newcomer to the genre who may have seen only a hand full of martial arts films, this is a great film to see where the genre came from, where it's going, and what is out there for you to start watching. I recommend it to anyone!",1356652800,5,2776,4.458661417322834
5062235,4,B0077PBQ36,"A solid, if strange, look at Kung Fu cinema and it's influence on American Cinema.

The film clearly bears the stamp of it's writer- Ric Meyers- and represents his opinions as well as his research.  Though clunky in parts, it definitely seems like a labor of love and if you are a Kung Fu fan you will probably learn something new.  If you aren't a fan of the genre, it might be a way to learn about the history, but then again it might be interminably boring.",1336003200,2,460,4.264367816091954
8511897,3,B0077PBQ36,Fun little documentary meant for someone with no prior knowledge of Kungfu Cinema.,1509580800,,82,5.384615384615385

8511900,5,B0077PBQ36,"A history of- a review of, both one might say of mostly Chinese cinema martial arts. They are there the real, the fake but no doubt the stars of this aspect of film history.",1483401600,,173,4.117647058823529
8511901,3,B0077PBQ36,A fun documentary. Great for beginners. But not worth the current $7.99 price tag for streaming video. Might be worth it at about half that cost.,1476489600,,145,4.615384615384615
8511902,5,B0077PBQ36,This film offers some very interesting insight on some of the genres most well known martial art films. A real gem for fans Kung Fu Films.,1473206400,,138,4.346153846153846
8511903,4,B0077PBQ36,Interesting way the history of kung fu movies was presented,1466208000,,59,5.0
8511904,4,B0077PBQ36,"This might well serve as a great intro to the genre for newbies. For me, a lifelong fan of kung fu movies, I'm not sure there was a single thing I learned from it that I didn't already know, but I still enjoyed it quite a bit despite the silly animated bits. There are far worse things I could do with my time than watching an hour and a half of clips of Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee, Michelle Yeoh, Jet Li, Gordon Liu, Stephen Chow, and Donnie Yen. Some other stars get less screen time than I might like, particularly Sammo Hung, and it's strange that the Shaw Brothers were never even mentioned while clips from a hundred of their movies played, but on the whole this is a fun little doc that I'd recommend to anyone who is interested in the genre, regardless of previous experience.",1465171200,2,780,4.312925170068027
8511905,3,B0077PBQ36,"Good but dated Martial arts documentary,it should have had more on what effect Chinese ""Kung-Fu""movies had in America after Bruce Lee passed away.",1462406400,,146,5.391304347826087
8511906,5,B0077PBQ36,I would agree that it is perfect movie for Kung fu fans.,1456876800,,56,3.75
