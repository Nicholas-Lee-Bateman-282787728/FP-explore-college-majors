2069097,2,B000294RTO,"While this DVD has a new name, all but one of the 6 episodes are reruns, seen in the other Kipper DVDs and VHS. While this DVD is 109 minutes long, over 60 minutes of that are clips from other HIT shows, or trailers. ""The little Ghost"" is the only ""new""  Kipper episode there. Unfortunately, this website does not show that this DVD is full of reruns, so there is no way to know if you are buying something new. The same problem exists with the Kipper show ""Water Play"", it has all used episodes except for one.",1092441600,38,511,4.214285714285714

We all adore this guy & his pals [but mostly Kipper.. he's so kind!] Great for younger kids --I know, I know they shouldn't watch until after 2.. but this is real life ;) lol Sooo anyway it's great slow-paced, easy on the eyes. He gets excited to watch but never rowdy watching this show. We enjoy it as a little down time together as a family (it gets him to sit still for a few minutes!)",1420243200,,446,4.022471910112359

2069133,5,B000294RTO,First thing our grandson asks for when he comes to our house is to watch Kipper.  We have five DVD's and he LOVES every single one.  It's funny because he even talks to them while he is watching them.,1395532800,,200,4.102564102564102

2069135,5,B000294RTO,My son is almost 3 and loves all of the Kipper shows. They are just so sweet and simple. Great dialogue and the cartoon is never too flashy. Some stories are very imaginative while others are more simple.,1392768000,,204,4.394736842105263

2069139,5,B000294RTO,"My grandson at 2-1/2 is very adamant about what he wants to watch. This is by far his favorite Kipper, and is actually his favorite of all his videos. His parents like the gentleness of the characters and the ways in which the characters disagree but work out their disagreements. Good role models for little ones. From my perspective, it doesn't drive me crazy like some series do!",1379635200,,382,4.632352941176471
2069140,5,B000294RTO,Kipper is a great video series - whichever Kipper video you end up getting/watching will not disappoint.  Both my 4 yo and 2 yo love Kipper!  And who wouldn't - he and Tiger are so cute.,1361577600,,186,4.138888888888889
2069141,5,B000294RTO,This little dog is a MUST for all children! The video is entertaining and calming. My grandson LOVES-LOVES all of the Kipper episodes. The monotone voices and storylines are very entertaining for toddlers.,1352160000,,205,5.242424242424242
2069142,5,B000294RTO,"This is basically the only TV we let my very active 12-month-old watch. He looooves Kipper, and so do we! While he is impatient and bored with other shows, he is really drawn in by Kipper. I think it is the gentle, simple pacing of the stories and illustrations. When he is tired and whiny, we play some Kipper and he instantly chills out. He even laughs at certain places in the story (although I am not sure what his little one year old brain thinks is funny).

As a parent, I find this show enjoyable as well. The characters aren't annoying, it's relaxing, and cute. Also, I like how the stories are all based around simple every-day events that my child is likely to encounter. I think this brings it more to his level. I also feel like the slow, regular pace of the show is much better for his little developing brain than shows that skip crazily from one thing to another.

Two thumbs up from both of us.",1292544000,,910,4.315789473684211
2069143,5,B000294RTO,My 2 1/2 year old twin boys LOVE to watch Kipper -- they think this one is especially funny!,1270425600,,92,3.8947368421052633
2069144,5,B000294RTO,"My grandson loves ""Dog.""  That's what he says when he wants a Kipper DVD.  He has 3, so we haven't noticed repeat stories.  Kipper is great when your child needs some quiet time - time to wind down, not up.  There is no jumping and dancing, no excitement inducing songs. The narrator is very soft-spoken.  We like Kipper and his friends.",1245801600,,337,4.459016393442623
2069145,5,B000294RTO,We bought these nearly two years ago and she still loves them. We like them for the calm stories that don't wind her up.,1243209600,,120,4.041666666666667
2069146,5,B000294RTO,Another lovely group of Kipper tales you'll want to watch again and again with the small fries in your life.,1242777600,,108,4.45
2069147,5,B000294RTO,"This is the first choice of my grandkids. Kipper and his friend Tiger are like part of the family. I had almost forgotten about Kipper-my 10 year old grandson liked him. Then I saw someone complain about always getting ""Kipper recommendation"" in her choices. Kipper is like an old friend back for another extented stay in the Hackney household. WE LOVE KIPPER !!",1217289600,,362,4.761904761904762
2069148,4,B000294RTO,My grandkids love to watch Kipper and his friends but most of the selections on this DVD we had already seen on other ones. (We have three other besides this one.)  It is a good DVD for someone who has not already purchased other Kipper movies. I would recommend it to anyone who has not already seen some of the other DVDs.,1206489600,2,324,4.225806451612903
2069149,2,B000294RTO,Parents may like it the kids are not too impressed. They watch Barney 100* this barely once.,1179100800,,92,4.470588235294118
2069150,5,B000294RTO,"Kipper, a never ending source of entertainment in our household!  I particularly like it for its good language use and word pronunciation; I live in a non-english country and have need of finding other tools (other than my own voice) to assist my 3 year old son with his english vocab. and language.  That said, Kipper is a delightful dog with a big heart; he teaches sharing caring and thought assembly.  I enjoy all of these movies; this one is my latest and Alex loves it!",1173484800,3,475,4.5
2069151,5,B000294RTO,"As I have said before, My children Adore kipper. This video is so cute! The kids just giggle all of the way through. This dvd is in constant play at my house, It is funny and educational.",1163289600,,187,4.081081081081081
2069152,5,B000294RTO,"Despite being only 16 months old, my son loves this DVD and he actually sits and watches the stories quite intently, ocassionally talking at the tv screen, or aping the characters' moves. The deliberately slow pace of the stories and slow delivery of the dialogue seems to be easy for him to follow, though he can't understand the words yet. The characters in the stories convey a lot by the expressive nature of their voices, and I think very young children can pick up on this. But, as an adult I found the stories entertaining as well, which underscores the charm of this series of cartoons.",1144627200,4,594,4.613207547169812
2069153,5,B000294RTO,"This is the latest Kipper DVD to be added to our collection.  It only has six stories, but they're really good ones.

We didn't get the earlier VHS editions, so all the stories are new to my four year old, who thoroughly enjoys them.  As a matter of fact, my two year old nephew is now a convert.

The beauty of the DVD edition is the feature which allows you to choose an episode, or play them all, or play them all continuously, the last being the favorite pick at our house.

In ""The Visitor"", Kipper looks after a little lost gosling.  This is a good story if your kids are really messy, as Kipper is continuously cleaning up after his little charge.

""Pig's Present"" tells of Pig's birthday and all the pets he receives as gifts.  The part with the hamster going through Kipper's ""obstacle course"" is great fun.

""The Butterfly"" teaches that the best things in life should be free.

""The Bleepers"" will have your kids speaking strangely, and eating lollipops.

Arnold is formally introduced in ""Pig's Cousin"" - I had previously thought they were brothers.

""The Little Ghost"" is the most entertaining story of the lot, with the most ""special effects"" of any Kipper episode.

If you haven't already seen the early episodes, I strongly recommend this one.  If not, borrow it just for ""The Little Ghost""

2069155,5,B000294RTO,"This is the first Kipper DVD I bought for my 3 year old.  He likes it and so do his parents and even his little friends that come over for play dates.  My child now pretends with a British accent!

Kipper episodes aren't filled with the violence, crude language or visual bombardment of other modern day toons.  Instead Kipper toons offer a hip soundtrack, simplistic settings, and gentle storylines.

I highly recommend Kipper video for anyone with class.",1102550400,,456,4.794871794871795
2069156,5,B000294RTO,"I always love Kipper, probably even more than my 2 1/2 year old, and there are years to come for her to enjoy them.  I like the British humor and the simplicity compared to the chaotic cartoons around.  And I like how kind the characters are to one another.

Another reviewer complained that all but one of these stories are repeats, but I have every DVD or video Amazon offers in the Kipper series, and there are no repeats on here or on the 'Kipper Waterplay' DVD.  But here is a list of the stories on the 'Kipper Helps Out' DVD:
The Visitor
Pig's Present
The Butterfly
The Bleepers
Pig's Cousin
The Little Ghost

Enjoy!

Update: My daughter is now nearing 3 years of age, and she is a HUGE Kipper fan!  She always liked Kipper, but lately is very into all of our Kipper collection, can't get enough.  You can't go wrong with any of the Kipper DVDs.",1098057600,28,852,4.314465408805032

I watched with my wife later and we feel it's not appropriate for our son's age. We don't have a very good explanation about what a ghost is, which will make him even more confused. That doesn't do any good for kids this age whose imagination are so fertile, leading to bad dreams at night. That's definitely not funny for him nor for us.",1466294400,,508,4.414893617021277
