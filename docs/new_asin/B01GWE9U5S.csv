8764153,3,B01GWE9U5S,"The Man Who Knew Too Much, 1934 film

The film shows a ski jumping exhibit in St. Moritz Switzerland. Mrs. Lawrence takes part in a skeet shooting contest, and misses. The polite chatter tells something about the times and popular culture. There is a shot, and Mrs. Lawrence's dancing partner dies after giving a message. Mr. Lawrence goes to the man's room to retrieve an object - a message in a shaving brush handle. He now asks to speak to the British consul. But he gets a message warning him to say nothing or his child will never be seen again! Upon his return to England they are questioned by the authorities. Mr. Gibson tells them Louis Bernard was a special agent for the Foreign Office, and knew of a plot to assassinate Mr. Rapa, a foreign official. A telephone call reminds them not to talk to the authorities. The call is quickly traced to Wapping (the name on the message). Mr. Lawrence and his friend Clive visit the name on the message. The dentist gets a treatment instead. Mr. Lawrence hears the words of two conspirators. Next they visit the Tabernacle of the Sun. But they are caught! During a fight Clive escapes to warn Mrs. Lawrence.

When a policeman shows up the conspirators convince him that Clive was drunk and disorderly, so he is arrested. We then learn more about their assassination plot. Mrs. Lawrence is warned against interfering. A scream is heard before the shot is fired. Their plans have gone awry. The shooter is followed back to their lair. They open fire on the police, who send for rifles at a local gunsmith's store. (No gun ban in those days.) The police open fire then break into the building. The shoot-out at the end is unusual for a Hitchcock film. Their daughter escapes to the roof, and her mother takes aim to protect her from her pursuer. None of the terrorists are taken alive. [It must have some political message for the audience.]

Two decades later another version of this story was filmed, updated for a new audience. Four decades later yet another film was made from this story (""Foul Play""). Comparing them will tell how they match popular culture of their times.",1508630400,,2125,4.63129973474801
