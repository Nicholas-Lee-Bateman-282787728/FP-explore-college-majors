1047357,5,6305461821,"Sometimes the impresive achievements of the Imax and dvd technologies exceed the quality of the content of a certain documentary. This is not the case. If any, this video keeps us longing for more, much more. Since the  beginning of this highly entertaining video we feel commited to watch one  of the untamed scenaries of our world. Virgin Landscapes (rivers and  mountains that are yet to be named), wild and funny animals (such as the  black bear taking a bath, the humpback whales bubblenetting, the wild polar  bear cubs and the stubborn salmon) and an extreme weather that changes the  sorrounding scenary on a daily basis are described and tought with either  the lightness of humour, or the concern of a nature fan. If you like to  watch beautiful images over and over, buy this dvd.",962323200,53,791,4.764705882352941

The narration by C.Heston fits the somber,harsh yet beautiful imagery of this  DVD.I know some people complain that for the money its to short. However,the  thrill of seeing such sharp,clear,pristine views in my view,makes up for  it. And,until more networks broadcast true HDTV programs,this is the best us  nature lovers can get!",954460800,14,478,5.25

1047436,5,6305461821,its a good film /amazing cinematography and amazing in bluray people buy this and think its a 2 hour doc but its not look up how difficult it is working with a camera that is the equevalent pounds of a tiger making an imax film  takes up to a year while making a film on a regular panavision can be 2 weeks to 3 months wich is the average of a movie learn about imax thats why all of their films are within the time lengths of 30 to 40 minutes.,1262044800,,444,3.879120879120879
1047437,4,6305461821,"This disc has great HD quality. 1920x1080 as advertised.  My Sony Blu-ray is consistently churning out 30-40MB of content per second.  The reviewer who thinks it's not HD needs to take a lesson in HD.
However, something left to be desired on the audio side. One review already commented the LFE (Low Frequency Component) is not present which I agree. Overall sound is not quite theater quality.

As for the content: it's well shot, well scripted, well narrated. The iceberg crashing scene you will not catch it on HD anywhere else.
very entertaining and worth the money. Only downside:  1) animals scenes are great but need more geology  2) too short.",1246233600,2,651,4.828828828828829

1047439,3,6305461821,"This disk has great HD quality and the scenery is generally pretty good but the it's a bit like the travel channel, a bit like a sales pitch to travel Alaska. The scenes move along quickly and you wish the DVD were a little longer with better scene selection. Unfortunately, I guess I will forever judge outdoor content to the standard set by Planet Earth which really isn't fair. Overall the disk is good and I think it's probably worth buying if you want a primer to Alaska.",1241222400,,476,4.420454545454546

1047483,1,6305461821,"If you're interested in bears then you might enjoy this.  As for me, I was hoping to see more of Anchorage & the Northern areas, and just more of the land in general.  But this movie is 40 minutes of bears, whales, and sea lions playing to a Charleton Heston narrative.  I liked the short clips about the Inupiat and the gold rush but other than that I just felt jipped, honestly I'd expect more from a documentary about such a great place as Alaska.",1234224000,,450,4.270588235294118

1047542,1,6305461821,"If you want to fill your kids with with misinformation about Alaska, this is the movie for you. The scriptwriter apparently flew by the seat of his pants, making stuff up as he went along.

The script says that the famous Iditarod dogsled race originated to commemorate the Gold Rush. Wrong. The Iditarod commemorates a desperate dogsled race against time to transport smallpox vaccine from Anchorage to Nome, where children where dying of the disease.

In another error-filled scene, the script refers to the fiercesome black bear.  Clips are shown of wolves, foxes and even elk cowering and running for cover because of a black bear. They were probably running from the camera crew. Wikipedia describes black bears as omnivores whose diet relies most heavily on grasses, herbs, fruits, and mast. They also feed on carrion and insects such as carpenter ants, yellow jackets, bees, and termites, and raid bees nests for honey. They sometimes kill and eat small rodents. They seldom attack other animals unless cornered, threatened, or wounded.

People believe the stuff in these documentaries, especially children.  Parents, beware of scriptwriters such as the one who wrote the narration for this film.  He was intoxicated with his purple prose and made up his own drama when the real facts weren't conveniently at hand.  This guy should be writing soaps, not nature documentaries.

A pox on this movie. Smallpox, if you like.",1175472000,21,1427,5.094420600858369
1047543,5,6305461821,"This is wonderful for the family. Super shots of scenery and animals (the latter with good humor as well). Charleton Heston's narration is apt and not overdone (though the volume is a bit low as compared with the otherwise excellent music soundtrack that is Aaron Copeland-esque). A very nice intro to the glories of Alaska, it even includes a bit of history on the Gold Rush.",1144281600,16,376,4.712121212121212
1047544,5,6305461821,"The spectacular scenery and fascinating wildlife of Alaska are seen at their most intriguing in this film, which was nominated for a Best Documentary Academy Award. The history of the land from the height of the last great ice age 18,000 years ago is also explained, showing in some well made graphics how man and beast were able to cross into Alaska on the Bering Strait from Asia.  With marvelous aerial photography, as well as some underneath a stampeding caribou herd, and underwater for the hatching of the salmon and swimming seals. Other animals seen hunting and at play are the brown, black and polar bear, bison, musk ox, eagle and red fox. Beavers building their homes, whales in unison making bubble circles to catch herring, sea lions, and their predators, the Inupiat (Eskimo), who survive their year around existence in the harsh environment eating seal and whale meat.

It follows this great ""land of extremes"" from spring to spring, a land that took the lives of hundreds of men seeking wealth during the gold rush, as well as their pack horses, shown here in some historic still photographs.

Directed by George Casey, and written by Mose Richards with clarity as well as an almost poetic grace, it is narrated by Charlton Heston, who is gifted with a voice that is always a pleasure to listen to.

Educational as well as glorious to look at, this is an excellent documentary on America's  least explored state.

Total running time is 40 minutes.",1118707200,10,1463,4.808764940239044

A:SotW is entertaining and enlightening... with breaktaking scenery and unexpected humor, courtesy of the Alaskan wildlife.  (there's a scene with a black bear that's absolutely hilarious.)  Charlton Heston's narration doesn't annoy or interfere with the scenes as some narrators do...  I highly recommend this DVD become part of your collection, if only for the sheer beauty of the Alaskan landscape that is shown.",1070668800,8,519,5.142857142857143
1047546,5,6305461821,"I am an aerial/landscape photographer living in Alaska and some aerial scenes in this movie remind me of my photoshoots and fights through steep valleys. In IMAX format, it's almost spellbounding!  With the size of Alaska as large as 1/2 of the contiguous 48 lower states, it's hard to document everything 'wild' about Alaska in a short 40+ minute film.  However I will give the film-makers credit for doing a fantastic job of showing the audiences the differences of seasons while integrating the wildlife aspect of this great state. This film will do wonders for the eco-tourism of Alaska.  The aerial scenes taken from Denali National Park via K2 Aviation (the red small aircraft) are especially inspiring.
