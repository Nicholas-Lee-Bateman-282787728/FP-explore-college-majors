8231875,5,B000YDAZ5S,I have used all of them and they are all easy for a senior citizen to follow. Have not used them over the summer but now that it is colder outside they will definitely be used regularly.,1382832000,,186,4.054054054054054
8231876,4,B000YDAZ5S,I bought these for my aunt who just turned 60 and she really likes these. They give her a good workout without being too difficult.,1268870400,2,131,4.28
8231877,5,B000YDAZ5S,"I am 61 and wanted a set of exercise videos to keep me limber and strong.  Mirabai Holland's trilogy for beginners is perfect for me.  After the initial viewing, I could follow along, even though I couldn't do all exercises completely.  She goes slow deliberately so that you can feel the muscles working.  The trilogy is good for me because I tend to tire of using the same program daily.  This way I can rotate which one I do each day.  I also purchased her video for strengthen bone mass and I like that one also.  If you want an exercise program you won't get bored with, try the trilogy.",1220054400,12,592,4.327272727272727
