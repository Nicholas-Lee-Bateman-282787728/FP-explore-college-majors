8600441,4,B002DXJRFQ,"It's almost like a Spanish Troma film.  Low budget camp, but very entertaining for fans of crazy genre films.  This director has a great visual style, which gets better with each film.  (I believe this was his 1st film, but don't quote me on that.)  Watch out for his newest film ""The Last Circus"".  I saw it at SIFF, and it was loads of psychotic-clown-fun.",1309651200,,358,4.446153846153846
