4092865,5,B003916HMW,I heard there was a mess-up with the bar codes which is why people got a CD sent to them vs a DVD but this has been corrected.  I urge every Chet Atkins fan to check out this DVD - It's really an incredible show with a fantastic collaboration of music saints - from Willie to Waylon and the Everly Brothers in between....not to mention Mark Knopfler!!!,1269820800,,352,4.253731343283582

4092871,5,B003916HMW,Chet Atkins and Mark Knofler are amazing on this video. All my friends think so too. I can't count how many times I've played it.,1386115200,,129,4.2
4092872,5,B003916HMW,Excellent concert i have been wanting to get a copy for years. I was delighted to find you had a few copies left,1372723200,,112,3.9130434782608696

4092874,5,B003916HMW,"I saw this on TV when it first aired and enjoyed it so much.  I was happy to find it while browsing one day recently.  Chet Atkins was certainly a Country Gentleman.  Mark Knopfler is a very talented artist; besides having an infectious smile which just puts you in a good mood.  This video also contains one of the most beautiful renditions of Precious Memories I have heard, performed by Emmy Lou Harris. Thank you for making this available.",1368144000,,443,4.569620253164557
4092875,5,B003916HMW,I HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED LISTENING TO CHET PLAY THE GUITAR AND SO I PURCHASED THIS DVD. IT WAS NICE HAVING A MIXTURE OF GUESTS ON WITH CHET BUT THE TIME SEEM TO PASS TO QUICKLY AND I WANTED MORE. HOW COULD I NOT RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE. CHET HAS HAD A LOT OF HITS OVER THE YEARS AND ALSO WITH OTHER GUITAR PLAYERS LIKE EARL KLUGH AND GEORGE BENSON PLUS MANY MORE. IT WAS A VERY NICE DVD.,1366675200,,385,3.948717948717949
4092876,5,B003916HMW,"After I saw this special on PBS, I knew that I had to have this one for my collection.  It is truly a special keeper.",1365120000,,117,3.68
4092877,4,B003916HMW,"Very nice DVD, but should hve been longer. Would probably not buy this same one again. Really surprised by his choice of guests",1361059200,,127,4.565217391304348
4092878,4,B003916HMW,I had seen this on PBS and had to have it.  Lots of good music and great artists to perform.,1360195200,,92,3.6
4092879,5,B003916HMW,Taped this years ago on VHS and have wanted it on DVD for a long time.  Was very glad it became available.  Chet was one of a kind and will be missed.,1359590400,,150,3.65625
4092880,5,B003916HMW,I have nothing but total respect and love for these two guitarists.  If was fun to see and listen to the rest of the artists too.  Just not long enough.  Needed more.,1348444800,,166,4.125
4092881,5,B003916HMW,"If you appreciate and respect Chet Atkins, this is a must.  Accompanied by many performers that he has influenced, this is a wonderful look back to his music and I feel sorry for anyone who listens to the last piece by Atkins solo and doesn't feel some emotion swelling up inside.",1341014400,,280,4.490196078431373
4092882,5,B003916HMW,"Although
I eventually became a jazz guitarist, I grew up with Chet's
LPs, & even played the famous Chet Atkins Gretch model guitar. This DVD covers a concert I attended, so it bringts back some great memories. He has all the greatest country & Western giants there with him like Mark Knophler (Poor Boy Blues) et. al.
Get this DVD. You won't be sorry.",1337558400,,351,4.5
4092883,5,B003916HMW,Chet Akins Music has always been around in my family growing up. I have a brother -in-Law who can play his songs just like Chet. It is amazing. I got great service from Amazon.com. It arrived in 3 days!,1334275200,,202,4.205128205128205
4092884,5,B003916HMW,"I ordered this for my son, who is a huge fan of Chet Atkins, and is himself an expert 'finger-style' guitarist.  He said it is a very enjoyable DVD, made even better because of all the other musicians, who were also included.  Very worthwhile DVD for those interested in this style of guitar playing.",1330300800,,300,4.537037037037037
4092885,5,B003916HMW,"As soon as I saw this show on PBS, I knew that my boyfriend would absolutely love it.  He's been a guitar player for over 40 years and idolizes all the guitar gods. I was right, he was totally thrilled to see what he got for his birthday!",1325116800,,238,3.9583333333333335
4092886,5,B003916HMW,"This DVD is Mr. Guitar showing his great musical talent and also his caring for and helping others.

The 1950s and 1960s were my teen and young adult years. I always wanted to play guitar like Chet Atkins. And The Everly Brothers were one of my favorite singing groups

(In my 40s I learned how to strum a guitar. Even now I play most days to relax. But, I can't even follow Chet's chord fingering!)

This DVD brings back memories of my early days of listening to and appreciating great music. It also is a testimonial to a great musician and humanitarian.

I'll also buy a copy for my son who plays guitar much better than me.",1321833600,3,627,4.333333333333333
4092887,4,B003916HMW,"This performance simply oozes class from every direction.
I never knew how many musicians from different generes owed
their start to this extraordinary man!",1316044800,,156,5.541666666666667
4092888,5,B003916HMW,"I had seen this on TV two times and can't wait to watch this DVD with the added footage not shown on TV.  If you like Chet Atkins and the others in the show, this is well worth the price.",1315353600,,187,3.675
4092889,5,B003916HMW,A great production with the best duet guitar playing you must hear. Mark and Chet are to be seen along with the rest of the stars. I great buy!!!,1299369600,3,145,4.0344827586206895
4092890,4,B003916HMW,"I ordered the DVD, but got the CD. I don't know how that happened. But I did not return it. I kept it. The music is that good, the playing that great.

So I can't really say too much about the DVD. I saw this on PBS, so enjoyed watching the playing. But sometimes the visuals can distract from the performances. So the CD is a good thing and allows you to concentrate on just the pure joy of well performed and arranged music played by masters at their craft.

And oh, what masters they are.",1295049600,3,491,4.104166666666667
4092891,5,B003916HMW,"I've had a great respect for Chet Atkins ability to play the guitar since I first heard my parent's Chet LP when I was 9 or 10 years old. Chet has a unique sounding style, and can make guitars do things that I've just never heard anyone else do. You can tell when you see joint appearances that other great musicians feel the same way. When I saw the concert coming up, I was looking forward to it.

The concert turned out to be a surprise in a very pleasant way. It wasn't really a Chet Atkins concert, although he certainly got his time in the limelight with solo and duo performances. It was really a tribute to his behind the scenes work over the decades as a talent manager and record producer. The concert was filled with a continuing stream of top stars that Chet had groomed over the years. The performances were mostly stars like the Everly Brothers, Waylon Jennings, and more. I won't spoil the surprises here, although if you've read the promo material above, you already know the surprise performers. And the stars aren't all on the stage. Keep a sharp eye on the crowd when the camera pans to the audience. Its full of big time music stars.

The music played in this concert was of incredibly high quality. All the performers, both musicians and singers, are top notch. Not knowing who was coming on next as we watched, we were continually surprised and delighted by the appearance of the next performer. There is no question: we considered this was a real treat, and will watch it many more times over the years to come.",1294099200,16,1534,4.475
4092892,5,B003916HMW,"This DVD is priceless!  I don't know when I've gotten so emotional over a song, a song such as the one Chet Adkins gave us about his Dad - "" I Just Can't Say Goodbye"".  The entire program was absolutely marvelous.  I'll watch it over and over again.  You can't miss with this one!",1291939200,,280,4.12962962962963
4092893,5,B003916HMW,The DVD arrived quickly and in great condition.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime performance of very accomplished musicians and vocalists. Chet Atkins is the best guitar player ever!,1289174400,,179,5.62962962962963
4092894,5,B003916HMW,"We DVR'd this program when it ran on PBS and have enjoyed watching it. However, when we switched satellite providers, we lost the program. Having the DVD is more enjoyable. (Much as I support PBS, I don't miss the pledge requests during the program.)",1289001600,,250,4.704545454545454
4092895,5,B003916HMW,"I so enjoyed this dvd!  I wish it was complete as it jumps from song to song, but still well worth the view!  An intimate setting with Chet and Mark which brought me to remember ""Neck & Neck' that they did.  He will be missed!",1284163200,,226,3.977777777777778
4092896,5,B003916HMW,"This DVD has some great selections on it, but especially the song about his dad's hat (I Still Can't Say Goodbye). I watched the original broadcast of this on PBS back in '87 and that was the song I particularly remembered.  Get out your kleenex before you watch it.  Recommend!!",1282953600,,279,4.56
4092897,2,B003916HMW,"Disappointed  in this,too much chatter and not enough on Chet Atkins. These multi star concerts become an ego trip for most participants and then lose sight of what it supposed to be about - CHET ATKINS GUITAR WORK!",1281398400,3,215,4.657894736842105
4092898,5,B003916HMW,"This show was originally on Cinemax Sessions and I loved it.  I have it on vhs and I have been longing to have a dvd of it.  My dreams have been answered.  This is one fabulous show.  Chet singing ""My Father's Hat"" brings tears to just about everyone's eyes.  Willie and Waylon are awesome.  This whole show is one blast from start to finish and it was great to see the Everly Brothers back together again with their beautiful harmony still there.",1280361600,7,447,4.390243902439025
4092899,5,B003916HMW,I thought the DVD was well done and I enjoyed the content very much.  Chet Atkins was much more than a great guitar player and this DVD gives a good look and listen into both his music and that of other musicians that he was involved with.  Excellent!!,1278460800,5,252,4.229166666666667
4092900,5,B003916HMW,"Wonderful!! After catching part of it on PBS, I feared I wouldn't be able to find it. Thank you!!",1276473600,,97,4.157894736842105
4092901,5,B003916HMW,"Great DVD. Exactly what I ordered at a fair price and prompt delivery. Fans of Mark Knofler, Emmy Lou Harris and the Everly Brothers will especially like this DVD.",1274054400,,163,4.655172413793103
4092902,5,B003916HMW,"I saw this show on PBS  and loved it ........... had to have it , and it was worth every penny paid  for it .. if you love great  music and appreciate the talents of Chet Atkins this is for you ... so add this to your collection you won't be disapointed ...anytime  I want to sit and watch great musicians I pop this one in and have a blast every time ...  Digital Row  is great to buy from  too would  buy again ...",1272931200,3,416,3.8117647058823527
4092903,5,B003916HMW,"This DVD is wonderful.  When I first ordered the DVD the barcodes were switched and the company, Digital Row, sent me a CD by mistake.  They contacted me and sent me the DVD and told me to keep the CD at no extra cost to me.  I would highly recommend this company and this DVD to others.  The music and performances were wonderful.",1271980800,,331,4.2063492063492065
4092904,3,B003916HMW,"Not bad, given that I thought a DVD would be video, and this isn't.  Much of the byplay dialog loses it's appeal when you can't see what's going on as you hear it.  The music is great, but I feel the listing for the product is misleading.  The seller sent what I apparently ordered, and in a timely manner.",1271376000,,306,4.1525423728813555
4092905,5,B003916HMW,"There was a problem related to bar coding when the seller first listed this item. That is why most people, like me, received a CD instead of a DVD. However, Digital Row was aggressive in fixing the problem, and very courteous in the correspondence I had with them. I now have the DVD and it is great. If you are even just a casual Chet Atkins fan, you will love this show. Everyone of his guests (Emmylou, Waylon, Willie,etc.) has a tremendous respect for him and their performances show it. For me, the outstanding segment was at the close, when Chet sang ""I Still Can't Say Goodbye"", which he says always reminded him of his father. It is beautiful and very moving. I highly recommend both this DVD and the seller.",1271376000,20,716,4.473282442748092
4092906,4,B003916HMW,"This is a really great CD, (not a DVD). The sound was taken from the DVD.  I have not been able to actually find the DVD for sale, but it must be out there somewhere? You do not often hear Chet sing, but he does on this CD. The other musicians on this CD are remarkable rendering a tribute to Chet",1271376000,,297,3.8688524590163933
8391873,5,B003916HMW,Great DVD. Such a sad loss when Chet died and he leaves a giant hole that will never be filled.,1495238400,,95,3.8
8391874,5,B003916HMW,"Wonderful background music.  Just becoming a fan of the two, especially when they due a combined performance.",1493510400,,109,5.411764705882353
8391875,5,B003916HMW,...wonderful...replaces a faded old VHS mono cassette...,1484438400,,56,7.142857142857143
8391876,5,B003916HMW,"One of the best music videos I own. Chet, who is definitely NOT a singer, brings his fellow performers and sound crew to tears with his sensitive performance of a song about his dad,  'I Still Can't Say Goodbye'. (Merle Haggard also does it well on his CD Chicago Wind.) This video is an hour chock-full of fabulous performances by Chet, Mark Knopfler, Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris, The Everly Bros, Michael McDonald, and Waylon Jennings.(On VHS, this TV Special is entitled 'Chet Atkins And Friends--Music From The Heart. It's always MUCH cheaper than the in-high-demand DVD). There's also a CD under the same title as the DVD.",1481673600,,629,4.878504672897196
