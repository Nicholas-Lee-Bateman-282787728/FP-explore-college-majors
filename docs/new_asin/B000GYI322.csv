2620669,5,B000GYI322,"By it's fifth season, HBO's Tales From the Crypt had more that established itself as the greatest horror/thriller anthology of it's era.  The 13 tales featured in this season don't boast many of the big name horror directors of seasons past, but there's still plenty to love here.  Ed Begley Jr. plays a con man who gets way, way more than he bargained for in ""Death of Some Salesman""; which also features the great Tim Curry in multiple roles and was directed by Gilbert Adler who would go on to do the much maligned Bordello of Blood.  ""Forever Ambergris"" features The Who's Roger Daltrey and Steve Buscemi as rival war photographers, who naturally get a taste of war and hell unlike either could ever imagine.  ""House of Horror"" features Kevin Dillon as a frat leader breaking in new pledges (including Will Wheaton), Ernie Hudson stars as a gluttonous, evil man in ""Food For Thought"", ""Creep Course"" features Jeffrey Jones as a history teacher with a diabolical scam who gets the tables turned on him, and ""Half-Way Horrible"" is a season favorite featuring Clancy Brown as an unscrupolous businessman that finds his way into voodoo.  All in all, there's plenty of blood, guts, laughs, and thrills to behold in the fifth season of Tales From the Crypt, and chances are that if you loved the series, this is already on your buy list.",1164240000,17,1335,4.737068965517241
2620670,4,B000GYI322,"I am currently watching some of the episodes of this season, but if you watch the entire opening sequence of the DVD before selecting from episodes, play, etc, they give away the twist endings for a few of the episodes.  For season 6 & 7, PLEASE WB, put back the Crypt Keeper where you can select an episode.",1162598400,16,308,4.310344827586207
2620671,4,B000GYI322,"The fifth season of Tales from the Crypt started off with a bang, every single episode on the first disc leaves you with an eerie feeling with endings of episodes that you can't forget. Then towards the middle, it kind of fizzles a little and never gets quite as good as the episodes at the beginning of the season.

This season really did feature the gore, especially with the first few episodes of the season I was talking about. Forever Ambergris alone was extreme gore and I loved it! This season is definitely worth getting and is better than season three and four overall. There is also an abundance of stars in this season; John Stamos, Steve Buscemi, Tim Curry and even Trek stars Will Wheaton (Wesley Crusher from The Next Generation) and Robert Picardo (The Doctor from Star Trek: Voyager) make an appearance this season.

The extras were few; a virtual comic book of ""Death of Some Salesmen"", but it is a really cool extra. John Kassir, the Cryptkeeper, narrates the comic book that the episode was based on while the comic is being shown. I really enjoyed it! Overall, this is a definite must have for fans! I just hope they continue to do the virtual comic book for episode in the next two seasons as well, it was awesome.",1162512000,,1235,4.558558558558558
2620672,4,B000GYI322,"The Tales From the Crypt series was some of the best television airing back in the final year of the 80s and into the early 90s. Deliberately over the top. Deliberately funny. Deliberately campy at times. Deliberately scary. Deliberately gory. Deliberately one of HBO's finest creations.

The episodes are all based on EC Comics of old...mostly from the self titled Tales From the Crypt, Haunt of Fear and Vault of Horror comic books. But I'd guess that 90% of you reading this already know that, and you're here as I am delighted that it is finally out on DVD.

For those that have not seen these wonderfully entertaining episodes of dark humor and horror...if you're into the genre this collection and any of the other HBO seasonal Tales From the Crypt releases are for you.

Season five of the seven season series is where the producers should have considered bringing in some adaptations of modern short stories from the likes of Stephen King and Dean R. Koontz, because a lot of the best EC Comic stories were done in 5-star seasons one through four. But I guess the producers felt it was taboo to stray from the EC Comics classics. Still...the series is strong in season five. You get:

""Death of Some Salesmen"" - Get yer tombstones here! Rocky Horror meets Lilly Munster.
""As Ye Sow"" - Holy con-job, Batman! Adam West stars.
""Forever Ambergris"" - Roger Daltry gets fooled again...fatally.
""Food for Thought"" - Psychic ability or monkey business?
""People Who Live in Brass Hearses"" - Ice Cream man has a ""back"" up.
""Two for the Show"" - Instant karma's gonna get you!
""House of Horror"" - Haunted hazing incident.
""Well Cooked Hams"" - I will now attempt to pull a corpse out of a hat. Abracadabra!
""Creep Course"" - Mummy Dearest.
""Came the Dawn"" - Brooke Shields goes Psycho!
""Oil's Well That Ends Well"" - Texas tea party in a cemetery.
""Half-Way Horrible"" - Voodoo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
""Till Death Do We Part"" - I've heard of fulfilling your wildest fantasies, but this is ridiculous!

Hit the buy button. These'll kill ya!",1155772800,10,2029,4.736543909348442

DEATH OF SOME SALESMAN - dir. Gilbert Adler; starring: Tim Curry, Ed Begley Jr.

I have to say this is probably my favourite season. With brilliantly creepy ""Death of Some Salesman"", truly disturbing ""Forever Ambergris"", traditional yet surprising ""House of Horror"" and Psycho-esque ""Came the Dawn"", with all those great actors and well-known to horror buffs directors the fifth season really stands out among all others.

It's such good fun to watch the episodes all over again after so long. This Tales From The Crypt series has no rating but I would DEFINITELY say R due to the language and nudity so this is NOT kid appropriate.  5 stars.,1332374400,,397,3.817073170731707
2620791,3,B000GYI322,"Well this show was on a long time ago, but it still has a kind of old school coolness to it. While some jokes are great, and some bomb; the variety of different 25 minuet episodes makes up for it. It's basically set up like the twilight zone, but with ""scary"" episodes.

The story is vastly different from each episode, with a twist at the end. The variety of stories like this is where it shines. What's nice about have a bunch of random stories is that you can watch any episode, from any season, without needing prior knowledge of what happened. These stories are based on an old comic series with the same name.

With a variety of stories like this, you always have new actors and actresses in each tale. I've noticed some actors who have acted after this in famous movies (Like Wormtong in Lord of the Rings, or the preacher from Carnivale) and its pretty good acting for a show like this. It's cool the variety of characters that show up, and like the actors should, they bring them to life. While most of the acting is good, you do have some people who it's so obvious they are ""acting"".

The music varies from episode to episode, and it seems to fit with the episode its playing. It's nothing really spectacular though, the only memorable music piece in the start and end of the episode.

This season of tales is 380 minuets long, houses 13 episodes, and it's on three disks. Even with only 380 minuets it still holds entertaining value. It only has one virtual comic as the special features though, which is kind of disappointing.

Overall I say pick this up if you find it under 20 dollars, as it's pretty cool watching each episode and trying to figure out what's GHOULING on. Ha.

That's why i would recommend any Tales fan to purchase this season!

Best ones on this season: (the episodes listed are VERY tales from the crypt)

Death of some Salesman (the best in the whole series in my opinion, it's that good!)

Forever Ambergris (goriest episode i've seen so far)

People who live in Brass Hearses

Two for the show

Don't get me wrong, there are some other cool episodes on this season,
along with a few duds, but the episodes I have listed are the best by far!!
I would tell you what each episode is about but I don't want to spoil it for
you! As a Tales fan to another, it is better to watch em for yourself than
find out what they're about.(it's more suprising, trust me.) Most of the re-
views on amazon spoil it for you by telling what the episodes are about,and
I regret reading them before I bought this season. Overall, this is one of
the best seasons besides 3&4 in my opinion. This season is worth buying just

2620794,5,B000GYI322,"Every season has at least one clunker. You have Showdown from Season 4, Deadline from season 3 and to a point Cutting Cards from season 2. But IMO season 5 really is overall perfect. Not a bad episode in the bunch.  Let's take a look at the episodes.

Death Of Some Salesman - Tim Curry's brilliant performance on 3 different characters is just one of the few highlights of this opener. A salesman picks the wrong family to try to con. It's brilliant and creepy. Probably the best premier in the history of the show. Perfect. 4 out of 4

As Ye Sow - One of the more serious episodes of the season. Hector Elizondo stars as a husband who thinks his wife is cheating on him with a priest. Well done episode, good performances and trademark twist ending. A little slow at times but all in all this is a great effort. 3 out of 4

Forever Ambergris - A washed up photgrapher plans a scheme to take him out and get with his wife. Easily the most gruesome episode of Crypt. Seriously this is pretty gross. Some of the scenes are the most memorable of the whole series. Brilliant. 4 out of 4

Food For Thought - Ernie Hudson chews up the scenery in this one. He plays a clown who can read minds. There is a lot of jealousy here. Not a memorable one till the gross out finale. But the last couple minutes really make this episode stand out. Great. 3.5 out of 4

People Who Live In Brass Hearses - Two brothers plan to rob the ice cream truck man. They will regret it. Loved it. It was campy and over the top. It was very tales. The finale is gruesome and full of twists. 4 out of 4

Two For The Show - I loved this episode. A man kills his wife and hides her in a trunk.  He takes her on a train as a cop is after him. Another one with a brilliant finale. This one keeps you guessing as your not quite sure how it is gonna end. Love it (Though I kinda wish they did not have the final scene). 4 out of 4

House Of The Horror - One of the best of the series! A group of frat guys make their pledges go into a haunted house. Great twist ending! Done perfectly. A 80's cast do a great job with Kevin Dillon stealing the show. Outstanding. 4 out of 4

Well Cooked Hams - I really did not love this when it started but as it went on it got better and better. A bad magician needs to liven up his act and sees a chance when another magician shows him the box of death. Over the top ending fits the episode nicely. Felt very comic book like. Billy Zane stars along with Martin Sheen. 3.5 out of 4

Creep Course - Masterful.  Anthony Michael Hall stars as a dumb jock who gets the clas bookworm to help him with an Egyptian test. Add horror. Loved it. So awesome in so many ways. Anthony Michael Hall is terrific, it is also quite gory. 4 out of 4

Came The Dawn - One of the best and scariest of the whole series. A man picks up a hitchhiker in the rain at night. There is also a killer on the loose. Scary, intense and full of surprises. Very Hitchcock. 4 out of 4

Oils Well That Ends Well - Weaker episode for season 5 but it still works. Watch this episode early on! Pricialla Pressley leads the cast as a woman tricking a group of guys into thinking there is oil under the cemetery. Not scary but this works for 2 reasons.
1. John Kassir the voice of the cryptkeeper is in it.
2. The end is amsusing.
  3 out of 4

Half Way Horrible - A man looks for ways to preserve food. He uses voodoo. He makes zombies. It felt a little like a Tales From The Darkside episode at times but I still loved it by the finish. A strange episode for sure. Great. 3.5 out of 4

Till Death Do We Part - John Stamos stars in the finale. A mob woman and her younger husband plan to kill the younger husbands affair. It's a good finale to an amazing season though some may complain about the final twist, I usually hate these kind of ends but it works here. 3.5 out of 4

Buy it!!!!!! Also the Cryptkeeper is HILARIOUS this season.",1298592000,3,3896,4.049479166666667
2620815,5,B000GYI322,I really like this season was full of surprises. You will like the twist endings in every single chapter; is just great. I give 5 stars to this season because for some reason I enjoyed it more than the 4th. The fourth season was kind of so so; it missed some of the good stuff from the previous ones. I guess in the fifth season they got back to the good stories. Great show if you have the chance to buy all of them BUY THEM...,1296259200,,428,3.988372093023256
2620816,4,B000GYI322,"What good fun!  Less scary than a Twilight Zone episode, but what fun!  Just the right amount of today's stars doing work before they ""made it"" mixed with juuuust the right touch of cheesy goodness.  On a cold day, I could light a fire, make some tea or hot chocolate, pop this in the DVD player and lose myself for hours and hours.

2620817,4,B000GYI322,"Again, this is another personal favorite of mine since I was very young.  First, Billy Zane is an amazing actor anyway, so they chose him perfect.  Brooke Shields is outstanding as well, I loved all 'tales' ; some of which I found (one) to be even taken from a Hitchcock film itself.  I never get tired of watching ; they keep you with suspense and sitting on the edge of your couch.

Again, Billy Zane was in another 'Tales' but the movie & he played it terffic.  I can't wait for the other seasons.",1266624000,,500,4.276595744680851
2620818,5,B000GYI322,"Here we go with the fifth volume in the Tales From the Crypt DVD series. I would place it behind Season Two in terms of my personal favorites. There is a whole grimoire full of nauseating novellas here, let's take a look at each one.

*POSSIBLE MILD SPOILERS*

1. ""Death of Some Salesmen"" - Ed Begley Jr. plays an unscrupulous salesman who brings his business to the Tim Curry household. Great performances in a very gross episode. I am reminded of the Dan Aykroyd film Nothing But Trouble... you'll need a shower after viewing. 4 Stars

2. ""As Ye Sow"" - Hector Elizondo is a husband consumed with jealousy and not even Adam West can stop him from suspecting his very religious wife. There's some decent suspense to be found here, but it won't knock you out with the typical TFTC horror. 3 and a Half Stars

3. ""Forever Ambergris"" - Roger Daltry and Steve Buscemi star as war photographers who come across some really good stuff. But if you thought they were just going to smoke the peace pipe and listen to The Who, you would be mistaken. Pretty cool episode with some nasty gore. 3 and a Half Stars

4. ""Food For Thought"" - I've said it before, any TFTC set in a carnival is destined to be great. Ernie Hudson owns this one as the evil, telepathic clown and this episode is a CLASSIC. This is what Tales From the Crypt is all about. 5 Stars

5. ""People Who Live In Brass Hearses"" - Another classic. This one has Brad Dourif and Bill Paxton as brutal redneck brothers looking to make a buck as modern-day outlaws. It reminds me of the film From Dusk Till Dawn in the sense that it is a very strong crime-thriller before the over-the-top horror begins. This particular episode becomes quite ridiculous, but on repeated viewings you'll see the brilliance of it. 5 Stars

6. ""Two For The Show"" - A decent thriller starring Traci Lords. This one feels campy at times and the ending is funny. But they can't all be champs. 3 and a Half Stars.

7. ""House of Horror"" - This episode seemed like it featured every teen supporting actor of the late 80s / early 90s. Kevin Dillon, Courtney Gains, Brian Krause, Jason London, Keith Coogan, Meredith Salenger, Wil Wheaton, and even one of Dom Deluise's sons all appear in this! Whew! They play members of a fraternity that conducts a yearly ritual of investigating a haunted house. Words can't describe how much I love this episode. It is creepy and hilarious, I've probably watched it fifty times. 5 Stars

8. ""Well Cooked Hams"" - One of the most amazing episodes you will see, ever, from any television show. Billy Zane and Martin Sheen play rival turn-of-the-century magicians. I won't give too much away, I will just say that Martin Sheen gives a performance that reminds me of a small screen version of Peter Sellers' multiple roles in Dr. Strangelove. I adore this, one of the greatest installments of TFTC. 5 Stars

9. ""Creep Course"" - This season was performing at an awesome level at this point because ""Creep Course"" is another masterpiece. This one features Anthony Michael Hall (during the bully phase of his career) as an egyptology student in the class of Jeffrey Jones. As you might suspect, there is a mummy involved. Fabulous. 5 Stars

10. ""Came The Dawn"" - Very atmospheric and eerie installment. I have known people who weren't impressed with the story but I thought it was pretty cool. Brooke Shields stars. 4 Stars

11. ""Oil's Well That Ends Well"" - Lou Diamond Phillips and Priscilla Presley are scammers trying to make a buck in the oil business. But no good comes from it since they are hanging out with The Cryptkeeper, portraying a human character. 3 and a Half Stars

12. ""Half-Way Horrible"" - Another great zombie episode. In general, there are certain themes in TFTC that never go wrong. And zombies are one of them. This one has the great Clancy Brown as an executive marketing a special new preservative. Unfortunately for the consumer, he got this preservative from a juju man. 4 Stars

13. ""Till Death Do We Part"" - A gimmicky season finale about a mob hit in the woods. Well, this is no Miller's Crossing. Then again, John Stamos is no John Turturro. Entertaining, but not horrifying... the season does technically go out with a ""bang"". 3 Stars

Season Five was an excellent season, and, as it turned out, the pinnacle of the series because things began to go downhill with the VERY disappointing Season Six. If I were buying these sets one at a time, I would buy this one second, after Season Two. Season Five contains probably my favorite single disc of the entire collection. Disc 2 is something I've put in the DVD player more times than I can remember, and is great to watch each time.

The special features are very slim. A couple commentaries, and a virtual comic book for one of the episodes. The virtual comic books are cool, I wish they had them for every episode on the set.",1266192000,,4857,4.571921749136939
2620819,5,B000GYI322,"I'm a huge ""Tales from the Crypt"" fan. It was certainly the best series of the '90s. My favorite part about ""Tales from the Crypt"" was always the Crypt Keeper. He was always such a cute little guy, and so funny and playful. Anyone who enjoys sci-fi or the classic slasher films of the '80s will love ""Tales from the Crypt."" Although by comparison to most horror it is rather tame, since it was on Home Box there was some t&a and a little bit of shock thrown in with a twist ending, but it was always a lot of fun.

This is a 3-disc set which includes a total of 13 eps (all original/uncut). It also includes a ""virtual comic"" book as a special feature, read by the Crypt Keeper. The DVDs are housed in a bookcase packaging and include colorful and vivid comic book style pictures throughout.",1248998400,,791,4.308724832214765

2620821,4,B000GYI322,"There are a couple of episodes here that are really only average, but there are also some excellent ones (Death of a salesman, House of horror) that hold up well even now, more than ten years after they were made.

2620822,5,B000GYI322,"TALES FROM THE CRYPT had to have been a guilty pleasure for all the actors, directors, writers, and others involved in the production of the series all seven years it was on HBO. The series was a chance for everyone who had grown up on the old EC Comics horror magazines that were jam-packed of the grossest black-and-white illustrations to ever corrupt young minds to work with those stories and bring them to life -- or unlife.

I remember coming across some of those old magazines in the swap shop where I bought my paperback books for 15 apiece. Since there was no tax on those piddling amounts back then, I could buy seven books or magazines. Sadly, it wasn't often I had a whole dollar to spend, nor could I get someone to take me there very often.

But when I went, it was always agony. So much to choose from, and so little I could walk out with. Even sadder, some of those magazines a pickup for 15 are probably worth hundreds of dollars by now - and I no longer have them!

Thankfully I have the memories. I remember opening those magazines and being totally grossed out. My mother would've had a cow if she'd known what I was reading. I was always very careful to keep those magazines hidden away under superhero comics. And if she knew I'd watched the HBO series even after I was grown up she wouldn't have been very appreciative.

HBO did a magnificent job of delivering 30 minutes of gross-out horror with a twist at the end (and even though you were expecting a twist, you did and often figure it out).

In this set, you get a mixed bag of high-powered talent, emerging talent, semi-retired talent, and even a porn star princess turned legit. Oh, and did I mentioned Tim Curry? You get Tim Curry!

In fact, Tim Curry leads off this collection in an episode called ""Death of Some Salesmen"". He gets to play three roles that really twist the plot on a gender bender. Ed Begley stars as a conniving salesman who gets his comeuppance at the end of the story.

Adam West and Hector Elizondo head up the cast in ""As Ye Sow"". It's really weird watching West play this role, since I remember him so much as Batman from the 1960s television show. If you're familiar with the EC Comics, you'll probably see the end of this one coming. But it's still neat to see these actors in these parts.

""Forever Ambergris"" has a traditional kind of plot of the old master (a combat photographer) jealous of a new kid on the block. Steve Buscemi does a great job here, but the plot just isn't sparkling. It was refreshing to see Patsy Kensit, the hot blonde from Lethal Weapon 2, who had seemed to drop off the face of the earth after that movie.

Ernie Hudson (Ghostbusters) plays Zambini, a circus psychic with the power to control others in ""Food For Thought"". This is a role we haven't seen Hudson in before, and he does a good job. But, again, this is one of those episodes that has a predictable ending for anyone who's become familiar with the twists and turns of the plots. Jealousy plays a part in many of the episodes.

A pair of brothers, played by Bill Paxton and Brad Dourif, try to get revenge on an old boss in ""People Who Live In Breast Hearses"". This episode is really well done, mixing just the right amount of gore with tongue in cheek humor. But Paxton is one of those underrated actors that's truly gifted enough to pull off any role.

Admittedly, in this day and age of terrorist paranoia, the plot of ""Two For The Show"" just wouldn't fly. There's no way a man could get onto a train with a suitcase full of his wife's chopped up body. However, ignoring that for 30 minutes isn't hard. Traci Lords turns in one of her better performances in this episode.

""House Of Horror"" is another one of the standards from the old EC Comics days. Here we have a supposedly haunted house and a group of fraternity guys to get drunk enough to try to prove those old legends and superstitions are bunk. Kevin Dillon, Michael DeLuise, and Wil Wheaton head up the cast. Despite the old plot, chills are a-plenty and the twist is on the button.

Playing off the jealousy angle again, this time a professional jealousy, Martin Sheen stars as Zorbin the Magnificent. When he finds the younger magician who has a whole lot more talent than he does, Zorbin decides to kill the other man and steal his secrets. Of course, we know it isn't going to be that easy. Unfortunately, neither is pulling off this aged plot.

Anthony Michael Hall (Dead Zone) plays a true college cad in ""Creep Course"" when he lures an unsuspecting student to a professor's house and locks her in a mummy case. The professor kills his accomplice, but things don't turn out the way he thought they would.

Brooke Shields stars in ""Came The Dawn"", and she definitely doesn't get typecast because she plays a thief. Suffice to say this one gets a lot of its chops from one of Alfred Hitchcock's most famous movies. But it pulls them off well, and Brooke Shields is surprisingly good. Just goes to show the good material can make nearly anyone good as well.

""Oil's Well That Ends Well"" is one of the two stinkers in this set. There's no polite way to put it. Even the surprising presence of Priscilla Presley and Lou Diamond Phillips can't save this one. The plot is just too predictable and the whole effort comes across as very wooden.

We have another premature burial in ""Half-Way Horrible"", which may have been a clue for future episodes: don't do premature burials. Cheech Marin is in this one. Marin has been in a lot of movies and television before and has done exceptionally well. His part here is small, so saving this one isn't his job. But they did have the talent. The episode just didn't come together.

The series ends on a somewhat weak note. John Stamos (Full House) plays a male escort who has agreed to marry an older woman who's insanely jealous. I hate stories where everything is ""just a dream!"" Have mercy!

Overall, this collection of the fifth season of TALES FROM THE CRYPT is definitely worth adding to the home library if you're a horror fan. You get a large accumulation of actors at different points in their career, who bring a lot of different takes to various roles, and get to see the final visions of a lot of directors that worked on the series. Anyone interested in film scripting, directing, or acting might be interested in picking this up, too. There's not that many places we can get this much talent for such a small price. And there's a lot of entertainment here for the horror aficionado.",1185753600,3,6495,4.479695431472082
2620823,3,B000GYI322,"Let me start off by saying that I am a huge horror movie fan and a huge Crypt Keeper/Tales From The Crypt fan.  This show was a part of my childhood and makes me feel like a kid again!  I love the Crypt Keeper and his sometimes-bad jokes and I usually love the show and find that most episodes have a pretty high ""rewatch"" value.  However, as a kid I never made it to this season of Crypt because we no longer had cable by the time this season was on TV.

That being said...I find this season to be rather disappointing, mainly because it seems the show has gone from showing suspenseful, sordid stories with good old black humor, true scares, gruesome imagery with a nice ""and the moral of the story is"" type endings to a show that is primarily just serving up pure, raunchy, no holds barred gore and violence with far less focus on the stories themselves and atmosphere.  That is not to say that the episodes here are completely lacking what I listed as the great factors of the previous seasons but the main focus has certainly shifted to gross-out imagery that can make the strongest of stomachs turn.  Rather than covering my mouth in shock from the characters' words, reasoning and actions I now find myself covering my eyes because I anticipate not being able to handle what I am surely going to see from minute to minute.  Rather than lying in bed at night being scared to look out the window for fear of seeing a deranged, axe-wielding Santa looking in at me I lay there feeling utterly barfy from seeing a gorilla eating brains out of a human head or eyes exploding from their sockets.  I'd rather be creeped out than disgusted, but that's just me.

As I said I am a huge horror fanatic who normally can stomach most anything in movies except vomit and anything related to teeth yet I couldn't even handle watching more than a couple of episodes at a time in this season due to feeling so nauseated by what was shown!

I suppose I would still recommend this season but certainly it's not the season I would recommend starting off with if you're not a seasoned TFTC viewer.",1180569600,6,2082,4.4267015706806285
2620824,3,B000GYI322,"...it can lose some of its bite.  I watched all of the episodes contained on here, some of them could be considered shockers, but some are a little ho-hum and outrageous even for this show's standards.  Still, I like them for just the nostalgic value and the fact it can be considered in my mind, a family show.  Always a good buy for a collector or a real fan.",1174953600,2,361,4.202898550724638
