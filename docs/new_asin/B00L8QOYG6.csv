6474734,5,B00L8QOYG6,"This is a review of the entire Universal Complete Legacy Collections, as rereleased on DVD in September, 2014. I will leave others to complain about the lack of blu-rays.

First the pros: All the films where the character appeared are included in EACH collection, so if you buy them all you'll get a double or even triple dose of films like Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, House of Frankenstein and House of Dracula. Also included for the first time are the Abbott and Costello mash-ups, including Abbott and Costelllo Meet Frankenstein, the Invisible Man, and the Mummy. All discs are single sided not the double-sided disasters of the first release. All of the extras from the previous release seem to be present. The packages are nice and thin.

The cons: The Creature Legacy Collection is a mite skimpy. Three movies and a documentary on two disks could have been done cheaper. Universal decided for some strange reason to leave off Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde and Abbott and Costello Meet the killer, Boris Karloff. There is no Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde collection, of course, but the film could have been added to the Invisible Man Legacy Collection (two Mad Scientists for your money) and the Killer, Boris Karloff could have gone on the Frankenstein collection.

Be that as it may, this is a nice, economical step up from the previous release",1409788800,53,1370,4.796610169491525

6474759,5,B00L8QOYG6,"I anticipated the release of this Blu-ray collection as much as I anticipated Christmas when I was a kid. Sometimes films first seen as a child are disappointing when seen again as an adult. With these films it is the opposite. Now I can view them for the nuance, cinematography and subtle humor that went over my head as a kid. James Whale was a masterful director his films define all that was great about 1930s cinema for me (also including Showboat, Waterloo Bridge, One More River, etc.).

Of course Whale's 2 Frankenstein films are at the pinnacle of classic cinematic horror but as a kid I especially loved the humble post-Whale ""Ghost of Frankenstein"". It got right to the action and reprised the only real ""Igor"" in all of horror filmdom. To me this was Lugosi's greatest role. Let us not forget that from this point on, Frankenstein's monster had the brain of Igor in his head. As a kid this is how I rationalized why the Monster looked so much like Bela Lugosi in ""Frankenstein vs the Wolfman"". He had acquired Igor's brain so of course there would now be a physical resemblance. Was this why Lugosi was cast as the Monster? Probably not but to me it made perfect sense.

Anyway, I love the way Universal is giving these classic films the respect they deserve. I'm looking forward to similar consideration for the Invisible Man and Creature series. I was disappointed by the lackluster effort they made on the re-release of the Karloff/Lugosi trilogy but its still better than nothing.",1523404800,,1496,4.684410646387833

6474772,4,B00L8QOYG6,This is a very nice set if you're a Frankenstein fan .  Some of the transfer can be a little bit grainy but overall a very nicely put together Bluray package,1512345600,,157,4.064516129032258
6474773,4,B00L8QOYG6,"During the 1930's and 40's Universal ruled monsterland. ""Dracula"" became the studio's first break through hit (although during the silent era ""Phantom of the Opera"" performed much the same function but without the outpouring of franchise films--indeed, Universal helped define the term ""franchise"" and sequel with these films) followed by ""Frankenstein"" (which Bela Lugosi turned down in favor of ""Murders in the Rue Morgue""--he hated the make up and thought it would be a role that wasn't his cup of tea) which made a star of Boris Karloff (who had been drifting around in various films since the silent era) and Karloff brought both a menace and pathos to the role that few others could have done quite as well.

This set includes James Whale's films ""Frankenstein"" and ""The Bride of Frankenstein"" both of which have never looked better and for films that are over eighty years old is quite an accomplishment. ""Frankenstein"" may lack of the smoothness of the sequel ""Bride"" (and also largely lacking the black humor of the sequel) but it still remains a vital and entertaining film. Acting styles have changed with time so Colin Clive's performance may appear a bit over the top for current actors but his nervous performance brings vitality to even scenes that are a bit static (it was shot early in the age of ""talkies"" and the cameras were often rather large and clunky to use).

""Son of Frankenstein"" followed four years after ""Bride"" but without Clive and director Whale. It's still a very strong sequel focusing more on the thriller aspect with expressionistic lighting and sets. Karloff gives a good--if under utilized--[performance and Lugosi appears providing a terrific performance as Igor who has plans to use the monster for his own ends.

""Ghost of Frankenstein"", ""Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman"" and ""House of Frankenstein"" followed and, finally, closing off the series ""Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein"". With the last film--a comedy--the monster was finally put to rest (at least for Universal). Karloff had moved on to other roles (Lon Chaney Jr. played the monster in ""Ghost"" while Lugosi, Glenn Stranger AND Chaney played the monster in various sequences with Lugosi playing the monster most of the time finally taking on the role that allowed Karloff's star to ascend higher than his).

Like the DVD sets, these include commentary tracks on ""Frankenstein"" and ""Bride"" by Rudy Behlmer and Scott MacQueen providing lively and informative discussions on the various films. We get ""The Frankenstein Files"" ported over from the DVD set along with ""She's Alive"". The commentary track by Gregory Mank for ""Abbott and Costello Meets Frankenstein"" also provides some interesting and sometimes humorous stories around the production of the films.

Why only four stars? As great as some of these films are, there are a couple classics here that aren't quite as innovative, well written or imaginative as the first three films in the series. These are still a lot of fun.

As mentioned, the Blu-ray benefits from a top notch restoration and transfer (if you are on the fence about getting this and waiting for a 4K version, I'll be straight forward here--a film this old doesn't have a heck of a lot more information to squeeze out for a higher def transfer. More modern films benefit directly from 4K transfers so I kind of doubt the quality will show a large jump compare to a contemporary film).

Audio is clear and the subtitles in English are a nice touch particularly if a word or two might be muffled due to the old mono soundtrack here.

This set is essential for classic horror movie fans. Now if we can just get Warner to release ""Curse of Frankenstein"" and ""Horror of Dracula"" with special features and a 4K restoration/transfer, I'd be a happy camper.",1511827200,2,3777,4.965189873417722

6474807,5,B00L8QOYG6,I loved the original story and subsequent sequels. The Boris Karloff monster is still the best. I wish Universal would make a real great attraction using the old movie props and models based on these old movie sets and props.,1508976000,,225,4.65
6474808,2,B00L8QOYG6,"Beware if you plan to buy individual discs of the Complete Legacy Series on Blu Ray - I ordered 4 blu ray sets of this Universal series which states the number of films on each:
Dracula (6 films) Frankenstein (8 films) Wolfman (8 films) and The Mummy (6 films).  Which would leave one to believe there would be 27 films in the 4 sets I bought.
However, there are 3 to 4 films repeated on each disc. Three of the movies are repeated on three discs... The movies -House of Frankenstein-, -House of Dracula- and -Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein- are repeated on the Dracula, Frankenstein and Wolfman discs.
In addition, -Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman- is repeated on the -Frankenstein- and -Wolfman- discs. Only The Mummy collection has 6 mummy films with no repeats like the other 3 .
Very disappointed to learn that so many of the same films are on multiple discs. I might have been better off to purchase the Universal Classic Monsters: Complete 30-Film Collection. The 30 Film collection set includes all the films, with no duplicate titles, Dracula / Frankenstein / Wolf Man / The Mummy / Invisable Man / Phantom of the Opera / Creature from the Black Lagoon.
As far as I can tell, the Complete 30 movies collection appears to be only in DVD format at this date. Checking several sites, I was not able to locate it in blu ray.
Because this wast a necessity item or something I *had* to have right away, I wish I would have waited for the COMPLETE 30 Film Collection to be released in the blu ray format.
So I  spent 87.94 for an incomplete set and multiple repeats on each disc. I see a new 30 Film sets in DVD format are listed from some sellers for 88.48. It would cost me another 41.98 dollars to add the Legacy Collections for -The Creature from the Black Lagoon (3 films)  and - The Invisable Man - (6 films).
Buying them I ndividually, it would cost me a total of 129.92 to completely the collection. Even then, my set would still be missing - The phantom of the Opera - which is included in the 30 film set.
With that said, my order arrived today and I had removed the cellophane before I read the contents of each. Otherwise I would have definitely sent them back to Amazon tomorrow. I am guessing they are not returnable once the seal/cellophane is removed.
I don't see anything that indicates that these are digitally remastered or cleaned up versions. I will update my review to include audio and video quality after I have had time to watch a couple movies this weekend.
My advice ..... Save your money and spend the little extra to get the 30 Film set when/if it is released in blu ray.",1508976000,9,2608,4.463312368972747

6474811,5,B00L8QOYG6,"Halloween is coming and what better time than that to treat yourself to one of the original scare-a-thons? The Frankenstein movies don't hold the visceral terror that they used to but they are still fantastic and increasingly far-out features about the hubris of mad unfettered science and man playing his hand at being God with consequent disastrous results. For myself who either had not seen these movies for around 35 years or so or who had never seen some of these, they were all a treat and there were wonderful and fascinating bonus features included that added to the depth of feeling for these films and revealed secrets of times past that really make you appreciate the hard work and dedication the film makers, actors, and participants of these films went through. So much groundbreaking stuff! What do you get in this collection?

Frankenstein: The original masterpiece that started it all. We often forget that Frankenstein refers to the good mad doctor who creates the monster. The seemingly mad scientist Victor von Frankenstein is the scariest person on screen as he charges death to bring forth life.
Bride of Frankenstein: A sequel that is superior in virtually every respect and regarded as one of the best monster movies of all time. The titular Bride is hardly in the movie at all but what makes this movie so great is the cheeky way in which its told, with our narrator being Mary Shelley who spins the tale that builds rapid sympathy and even some natural humor in and Frankensteins monster and reveals his Bride as the same actress (Elsa Lanchester) as our storyteller, Mary Shelley.
Son of Frankenstein: While critics rightfully note that the quality of the films heads downhill after Bride what doesnt get mentioned is that the movies are still great, if not derivative now, but highly entertaining and they coyly add special elements which continue to distinguish them from each other. Son distinguishes itself with the introduction of arguably another monster, Ygor (played by Bela Lugosi of Dracula fame, and you cant take your eyes off of him he steals every scene), a seeming hermit who has been deformed at the neck after he failed to die in a hanging. He has befriended the monster, and has influence over him having the monster do his bidding and kill those men who had previously failed to kill him.
Ghost of Frankenstein: Ygor returns in the fourth film with a sinister plot to have his brain transferred into the monsters body and achieve what he believes will be his immortality.
Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man: A seminal moment in the Universal monster movies as, from this point out, most sequels would crossover with other monster entities. Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, which feels much more like a Wolf Man movie with Lon Chaney taking up so much screen time, has one of if not the most exciting climaxes of the entire series with absolutely fantastic miniature work.
House of Frankenstein: Boris Karloff, who played Frankensteins monster in the first three films, plays the role of another mad scientist who has escaped prison with a hunchbacked assistant and taken over a travelling horror show that has Draculas bones. Dracula is used for the mad doctors nefarious purposes and when he searches out and finds Frankensteins monster and the Wolf Man buried in ice he thaws them out only to use them too. His hunchbacked assistant, whom the doc promised to cure, falls in love with a gypsy who then falls for Talbot (the Wolf Man), and the whole affair turns into a dizzying swirl of nobodys going to come out of this looking pretty. A pretty wild romp!
House of Dracula: The series was running out of gas here and the big push again was for Talbots Wolf Man to be cured. Nobody gets along well with anybody else, and the poor monster is an impoverished weakling at this point starving for electrical current to animate him. While House of Dracula was still enjoyable, the scripts were beginning to get (pardon the pun) long in the tooth.
Abbot & Costello Meet Frankenstein: Cashing in on the funny duo the two mix it up with Frankenstein, the Wolf Man, and Dracula. Hijinks ensue.",1506470400,,4128,4.805907172995781

6475098,5,B00L8QOYG6,"What a wonderful set. Throughout the years I purchased and re-purchased these films. Now, for the very first time, all of these films are beautifully remastered. Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein and Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein are the same as the Universal 100th Anniversary edition - the highest quality version of these films ever released. But now, add to it Son of Frankenstein, Ghost of Frankenstein, Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, House of Frankenstein and House of Dracula - all remastered.

I recently purchased a Blu-Ray version of Son of Frankenstein from France. It looked about as good as the DVD version - washed out with low contrast. However, this release has the contrast fixed. Also gone is the content brightness changes and the jumpiness of the picture. Universal took lots of time in effort in to the restoration of this film.

Just like Son, the other films in this collection have been masterfully restored to pristine standards. I compared Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man in the French Blu-Ray release to this one. There is no comparison. This release is top notch. The French release had white dots throughout the frames in the beginning and even a splice in the titles. This release is sharp and clear - free of artifacts and changes in lighting.

This is the ultimate Frankenstein collection. If you have this in DVD, I highly recommend upgrading to this Blu-Ray edition. You will be thrilled with the quality. Even though there aren't any extras on the Son/Ghost or the triple movie disc except for unmastered theatrical trailers, the value of such high-quality films outweighs the lack of extras.

If you're a fan of these classic film, this is a must-buy collection!",1474070400,42,1710,4.989473684210527
6475110,5,B00L8QOYG6,"Outstanding HD transfers. Video & sound are excellent. What a surprise to find about 30 seconds of previously unseen footage in ""Son of Frankenstein"". When Ygor peeks in on the sleeping child, the mother runs to his room to check on him. I've never seen THAT before. Also, there's a shot of Ygor leading the Monster through a corridor before emerging through a secret sliding wall. I've seen this film countless times on TV and on DVD and I've never seen these shots before.  I don't know if this is mastered from a foreign print or what, but what a great surprise to see this extra footage, and in such fantastic quality. Universal really did a great job with this release. Now, how about the Mummy series and some W.C. Fields features?",1474070400,16,737,4.583333333333333
6475111,5,B00L8QOYG6,"So far I've watched Frankenstein, Bride and most of Son.

All 3 have the best picture for these films I've EVER seen. Son looks like a brand new movie! Since I already had the first 2 in Blu-Ray (from the set from a few years ago) Son has been the biggest star so far. Clarity is much improved as the contrast and sound. I've watched these on a 75 inch 4K screen and it's simply incredible!

Even my wife, who's not a big fan said, 'Wow, this is like watching a brand new movie!'

My ONLY complaint is I wish they had released a set with Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolf Man so that there wouldn't be so many duplicates. For a Universal monster lover like myself it just doesn't get much better than this!

I would rate this a VERY high 9.75 to 10 out of 10 - only way to improve it would have been some new and fresh extras on Son and Ghost!

Priced was under $29 when I bought this so even the price is REALLY, REALLY good.

***********UPDATE - I started watching Ghost last night - have watched about 50 minutes so far. Once again picture is crystal clear and as sharp as possible. In fact it looks almost like a brand new move!! I VERY HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS TO ANY UNIVERSAL MONSTER MOVIE LOVER!!",1473984000,14,1201,4.2

6475114,5,B00L8QOYG6,"This set from Universal represents a spectacular upgrade from previous formats.  They went back to archival materials for these restorations and some problems have been fixed that were seen in all previous home video incarnations of these films.  As others have mentioned, you basically get the same discs previously released for FRANKENSTEIN, BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, and A&C MEET FRANKENSTEIN.....they were all previously restored.  GHOST and SON share a disc.  MEETS WOLFMAN, HOUSE OF FRANK, and HOUSE OF DRACULA share a disc, but it's a dual layer BD50 and their data rates average 27-33Mbps.  All of the previously released supplements are included as well as trailers for all but SON.

Bottom line:  this is a very affordable set and something that Universal really (REALLY!) got right.  For the price, the complaints about certain films being repeated between the sets is moot.  This way, at least you can watch the series through in order without having to search for another set.  Well, technically you need to watch THE WOLFMAN and GHOST before MEETS WOLFMAN!",1473897600,56,1067,5.151162790697675

Son Of Frankenstein has a great grain and contrast look to it, Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman no longer has that damage in the titles and looks really good. The other new titles, Ghost of Frankenstein, House of Frankenstein, and House of Dracula, look exceptional, with loads of details and film texture, never looking as good as in these new transfers! Plus all the soundtracks have a much fuller sound with the uncompressed audio. Looks like the other titles are the same as the Classic Monsters box set, but they were great, so this set is a must have....Now how about a Karloff & Lugosi in the 1930's (Black Cat, The Raven, The Invisible Ray, Black Friday) collection?",1473811200,26,722,4.692913385826771

Same with the ""Bride of Frankenstien"" which they also showed that day.
I hate to do the double-dip thing for these companies but at least this has been remastered so they've done SOMETHING to earn it.  I will definitely be adding this to my collection - can't wait.",1473292800,2,530,4.28

6475119,4,B00L8QOYG6,"I caught some flack because of my premature review of this Frankenstein Legacy Blu Ray set, stating the inclusion of several films in both that set and Wolfman set was unfair to fans. I am still a little salty about it, but finding the Wolfman Legacy set for $14.99 has certainly made it easier pill to swallow.

First the bad news, there are no commentaries for the sequels, this is disappointing as I think fans would like to hear some background stories for them. Besides the need to buy 3-4 films three times (once the Dracula set comes out) to own all of the sequels, the only other thing worth mentioning is that there are no new extras.

The great news is Universal did a very good job on the newly transferred films, the sequels have never looked this good, free of scratches and defect, the sound is crisp and clear. Some have said these are 4K masters, but I doubt it, there is nothing on the packaging that indicates this, the films look excellent with minor softness in certain scenes, but this is probably due to the films themselves. Hardly looking 4K, but I really don't care, these films are very old and they look better than ever. A plus is all of the bonus content has been carried over so discarding your DVD sets or selling them for a few bucks is an easy decision.

The first disc holds Frankenstein ( same disc as in the individual release) with all the extras ported over from the first Blu Ray release. The second disc holds The Bride of Frankenstein (same as the individual release) with all its extras ported over, the third disc holds Son and Ghost, but the only extra is a trailer for Ghost (Huh?!), Where is the trailer for Son of Frankenstein?, it may be the most interesting trailer for this franchise and it mysteriously isn't here. The films look really nice and have received the best treatments of the sequels. The fourth disc holds three films with trailers as the only extras. It is the same disc that's in the Wolfman set, Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman and the 2 ""House"" films. This isn't a deal breaker as the films run around 70 minutes each and there are only trailers included as extras. The trailers look better than ever, but naturally show some wear and tear. It would have been better if they split the films up two to a disc, but I think the reasoning behind this was that they used the individual release of A&B meet Frankenstein for the fifth disc included are the extras from the original Blu Ray release. The case is attractive if not a bit familiar, but overall I am surprised that Universal delivered somewhat here.

I only needed the Frankenstein set for two films included on it, I was lucky to pick that one for the same price ($14.99) because of a mix up with the the store I purchased it from. . Next year maybe Dracula and Mummy sets will follow, with The Creature and Invisible Man sets to come shortly after. If Universal keeps the price point low, no one will mind all the extra copies of these films, but if history has told us anything there will surely be a 30 film Blu Ray set around the corner.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Just saw ""SON OF FRANKENSTEIN"". I've seen that flick many times---hell! I dress up AS The
Monster at The Burg Frankenstein castle ruins in Germany... down the road from me. I watched
Karloff----a frail man----easily carry the body of Bela Lugosi's character (({and for the first time!}))
noticed that there were piano-wires holding up Igor as The Monster walked along with that crane-
device. It was OBVIOUS on a 55"" TV. None-the-less.... a testament to the video CLARITY!

 This.... like the Wolf Man Collection, have two flicks previously ON Blu-Ray.

Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein on B-O-T-H of these new releases. I'll just re-gift my, pre-
vious, Blu-rays of, both, the 1931 & 1948 flicks to a friend.
I suppose ""they"" could've just combined A-L-L the FRANKENSTEIN and WOLF MAN movies,
and put out a ""Mega Collection"". They could've even used the title:
""FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLF MAN ON BLU-RAY""
I----for one----would've paid more... to get LESS. Huh?
Here, on separate discs with tons of bonuses are:
FRANKENSTEIN
BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN

6475303,5,B00L8QOYG6,"As with the other Universal monster franchises, the first three films are the best, after that it's as if the scriptwriters got tired of going over the same ol' theme and gave up. After the first film, the titles are also a bit of a play on words. The ""Bride of Frankenstein"" refers not only to Henry's bride but also to the bride he creates for his monster; the ""Son of Frankenstein"" is his actual son Wolf, but also the monster, and the ""Ghost of Frankenstein"" is Henry himself, appeared in a vision to his second son. ""Son of Frankenstein"" also introduces Igor, played by Bela Lugosi, a role which I considered done much better than Dracula, though few people remember him in this role, assigning it to Dwight Frye who was the hunchbacked assistant in the original. It's also ironic that Lugosi, who turned down playing the onster in the original, later played him in one of the last of this series.

Some of the stories are well-scripted and well-acted, others are the usual mishmash.  The early ones bring to life the pathos of the monster, generating sympathy for the artificially-created man, instead of the fear exhibited by the villagers. It's almost irritating to see them scream, run madly, and fall into near-convulsions the moment he appears, with never a question as to why he's there, but...  That was the mindset then, so... The stage was set for audience sympathy for the monster, but as with the vampire, it would be any years before the wheel turned enough to portray either creature in a more understanding light.

These are good fun for all, with a bit of good acting thrown in, as well as a bit of nostalgia for the days when suggestion rather than full-out blood and gore splash across the screen could scare us.",1443571200,5,1735,4.641693811074918

Universal have now reissued all the Frankenstein sequels from 1935 til 1955 on blu-ray
plus also including the original Frankenstein & Bride of Frankenstein that were already reissued on blu-ray few years ago
pretty pathetic of universal to only now reissuing all the sequels in HD, better late than never i guess
amazon are selling it for $30 so here's what you get,
all 5 Discs are on Disc trays inside clamshell blu-ray case with outer box slip cover
which is what i prefer i hate the fold out Digi-pak packaging
so i'm happy Universal made the right Decision about the packaging
ok Disc 1 is the exact same Frankenstein blu-ray reissue from 2013 with all the old dvd extras carried over of course
only difference is universal have widen the ratio a little from 1:33:1 to 1:37:1
Disc 2 is the exact same Bride of Frankenstein blu-ray reissue from 2013 with all the old dvd extras carried over
again the ratio has been widen a little to 1:37:1
Disc 3 has both Son & Ghost of Frankenstein in new 1080p 1:37:1 HD transfers with new 2.0 master audio mixes
both HD transfers do look amazing quality hardly any Grain or Dirt 8/10 much better than the very old Digital remaster
both sound qualities are much better boost than the old Mono sound for sure 6/10
the only extra is the original Trailer for Ghost which is only Digital remaster quality
Disc 4 has Frankenstein meets the Wolfman, House of Frankenstein & House of Dracula all given the exact same
1:37:1 1080p HD transfers which again do look amazing quality Hardly no Grain or Dirt
plus all 3 sound quality mixes are new 2.0 master audio stereo again sounds really Good better than the old Mono sound
8/10 for the HD transfers, 6-7/10 for the new sound quality mix for each film
the only extras are the original Trailers for each film in Digital remaster quality only
Disc 5 is Abbott & Costello meet Frankenstein which is the exact same version as the 2014 reissue
except the ratio has been widen to 1:37:1 and all the extras carried over of course
so time to scrap the old dvd versions of these Frankenstein sequels
and definitely buy this new blu-ray reissue of all the Frankenstein sequels, worth buying for sure

6475341,5,B00L8QOYG6,"Frankenstein - Complete Legacy Collection, 4 DVDs

This product has four DVDs with eight movies from the 1930s and early 1940s. The story of Frankensteins Monster came from a novel by Mary Shelley in the early 19th century. Stories about vampires and werewolves goes back centuries in folk legends that have no authors. These movies are digitally enhanced for clarity and contrast, they are much better than anything you saw on videotapes. One book said Frankenstein symbolized the Great Depression that plagued the nation and the world. Only by uniting could the people destroy the monster and the castle that produced it. The horror movies of the 1930s to 1940s ended after 1945 when victory in war led to new interests. Read the individual reviews for more information.

Frankenstein (1931) was the first adaption of the novel. The Monster is eliminated after the people attack the barons castle. Baron Frankensteins marriage promises happiness for the village (and another sequel).

Bride of Frankenstein (1935) tells how the Monster survived and how the village people tried to capture him. The body of a young woman is reanimated to provide a mate to the Monster. Can they propagate a new race of manufactured beings? Things don't go as planned. Will they survive the destruction of the tower?

Son of Frankenstein (1939) tells about the new history of the Frankenstein family. The Monster is dormant and hidden away. Can he be revived? Ygor commands the Monster to kill his enemies. Where is the Monster now? Baron Frankenstein seemingly eliminates the Monster.

The Ghost of Frankenstein (1942) continues with Ygor and the monster fleeing the destroyed castle to travel to another village. The other son decides to transplant another brain into the creature. The people attack the mansion and set it afire. Will this be the end? [No.]

Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man (1942) is another example of a sequel that follows a successful movie. Lon Chaney Jr. continued as the werewolf while Bela Lugosi played the part of Frankensteins Monster. There is a musical number for entertainment.

House of Frankenstein (1944) tells what happened to Draculas skeleton. When freed, Dracula goes on to attack people until he suffers from a fatal case of sunburn. Later they find the Wolfman and the Monster in an ice cavern. Can the people put an end to the Monsters?

House of Dracula (1945) is the last of the sequels during this era. It is an average story that seems to put an end to the monsters. At least until the economy and market research decides there is an audience for this type of movie. Then a new generation of movies are produced and marketed.

Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948) shows boys work moving crates from Europe to the House of Horror. These are the remains of Frankenstein and Dracula. Larry Talbot calls to warn them!

The black and white films, costumes and the peculiar use of the English diction is a nostalgia which is only used for comic affect in contemporary theater/cinemas.

8664393,5,B00L8QOYG6,"The Frankenstein movies I ordered were brilliant.
I never imagined they'd be more than just dumb
old black & white movies, but holy crap.
They restored these films so nicely.
And the movies themselves...See them!

***SPOILER ALERT****

The first film surprises you because every Frankenstein's
monster you've ever seen doesn't compare to Boris Karloff's
face. It's special. And then he actually KILLS the little girl
which leaves your mouth agape, as the towns people
become enraged and burn him to death in a windmill.
This is NOT the tame old movie you'd expect.

In movie 2 (Bride Of Frankenstein) we see sci-fi elements.
The scientist meets another scientist who's working on the
same thing, but he grows his people in a bottle,
and he shows them, and the movie is great!

And then movie 3 (Son Of Frankenstein)...wow.
It's actually 30's Sci-Fi, in glorious blu-ray.
In the era of Art Deco architecture,
it was filmed with bright spots and shadows, and diagonal lines
(even if the architecture had to be changed to create them).
In the walls are those hallways that get smaller as they go.
And in the town: cool looking houses you'd never see in real life.
It's visually stunning. And the story keeps your rapt attention.

From there (the set has all 8 original Frankenstein movies)
I found movie 4 to be ""just an old b & w film"".
It, and movies 5, 6 & 7, are the ones Boris Karloff refused to do
(He did actually play a role in one of them)
But he said, after the third movie, that the story had been played out,
and he was right. But the movie company saw profit in rehashing it.
And they did so repeatedly, each time adding more monsters to the cast,
to lure kids into the theaters...so you ended up with movies that ridiculously
had the Wolf Man and Dracula and Frankenstein all in one movie.
And they'd even advertise the ""mad scientist"" and the ""hunchback"" as part of the
circus type attractions cast. I got tired of the whole thing during movie 5, 6 & 7.
And then movie 8 is Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein, which was actually okay.

But I'm telling you -->the first three movies, wowee!
Well worth the admission price to see historic film greatness beautifully restored.

though I could be wrong - I'm convinced that cover was inspired by some scenery in Son Of Frankenstein.
 A 'window' in a wall, at some point. Very visually cool movie!",1530230400,,2553,4.788636363636364
