200759,5,1596686537,"The title pretty much says it all. No one DVD can tell it all and this one only has one hour and 27 minutes to get the point across.

One point that is interesting is that she has a floor loom but finds the rigid-heddle loom more efficient foe many projects.

I also have a floor loom but after watching this DVD dusted off a couple of rigid-heddle looms for projects. Found I needed to buy a few more bits and pieces. If nothing else they can also be used for tirals.

Liz Gipson is clear to understand and easy to look around when she is demonstrating. However se does not have time to tell all the part names or any peripheral skills as we concentrate on warp methods. However even for veteran weavers there is always something new to learn.

This also includes Three PDF projects. Even though this demonstration is for universal equipment I cannot help notice Schacht symbols on most of the equipment.

I have to confess I had to watch the section on warping two reeds a few times.",1387584000,7,985,4.360655737704918
200760,5,1596686537,Great information and a lot of great tips (like the wreath holders for the warping board -- LOVED IT).  A great resource.,1357084800,8,121,4.5

7799779,5,1596686537,Very easy to watch and learn. Most camera angles are good. I'm a new weaver and this video is very helpful.,1494201600,,107,4.142857142857143
7799780,5,1596686537,"Liz Gipson takes the angst out of warping looms. She presents the information in an engaging and enabling way, that should help new weavers, or experienced weavers looking to improve their skills, to put warps on their looms easily so they [we] can get down to the fun business of weaving textiles. This video was created with professional standards, yet is accessible enough so you feel like a skilled friend is right there with you, guiding you along. Once or twice during the presentation, I felt the camera angle made it difficult to see exactly what she was doing, but her explanations clarified. There are some handy hints and hacks too, which serve as jumping off points for experimentation and problem solving.",1488412800,2,718,4.89344262295082
7799781,5,1596686537,Haven't had time to watch this.  Too many knitting projects that need to get done before Christmas.,1481241600,,99,4.823529411764706

7799783,5,1596686537,"Liz Gipson is a great instructor, and this video showcases her teaching skills.  In this dvd, she covers three warping/threading techniques for the rigid heddle loom:  direct, indirect, (using a warping board) and threading two reeds for weaving finer fabric with finer yarns.  I already knew the direct warping method and I bought the dvd for the purposes of learning how to thread two reeds, but learned much more.  I have learned to love the direct method, and now give my warping board a regular workout.

While giving clear instruction on these techniques, helpful hints and tips are sprinkled throughout.  The tip about the L-shaped brackets and clamps have helped immensely, as is the one about using wreath holders for positioning the warping board in a more comfortable position.  She breaks down the process(es) into steps, explains why she is doing what she does, and gives advice to help the weaver avoid troubles.

Liz Gipson is an excellent instructor and this dvd is great with helpful camera angles and clear audio.  I plan to purchase more of her instructional dvds on rigid heddle weaving to help me continue my weaving journey.",1475971200,,1146,4.958115183246074
7799784,5,1596686537,It explains a bit about each step in weaving. Very easy to understand,1472428800,,69,4.384615384615385
7799785,5,1596686537,"This is a great dvd.  Ms. Gipson is a warm and relateable teacher who obviously knows her stuff yet is not afraid to admit to some past boo-boos as cautionary tales.  I loved her style and I found the content to be exactly what I needed.  I live in an area that does not offer rigid heddle classes beyond introduction to  direct warping so this was the perfect tool to learn other methods.  And she even explains when and why you need those other methods!  There was only one teeny little issue that was when she was showing how to pull the yarn through the holes in the direct warping section, her hand was in the way and a beginner could not tell that she was pulling the yarn through the holes with the hook.  But that was it.  I still give it 5 stars.  I cannot wait to use my warping board and get started now....but I am going to watch this dvd a few more times first!",1466640000,3,874,4.124260355029586
7799786,1,1596686537,"I know a lot of people love this video but I was exasperated with it.  Why?  A lot of talk and bad camera angles.  When showing what I thought were the tricky parts of the warp frame, the camera showed her back or her hands were blocking what she was trying to show.

I am really sorry that this happens to be the best video out there for purchase ...

I did have a rollicking laugh though.",1414368000,7,390,4.012987012987013
7799787,5,1596686537,"I've been fortunate enough to take an in-person class with Liz and am happy to say that this is almost as delightful as being there. Her scripting flows nicely with what's happening onscreen. Lots of whys along with the how-tos. I've been warping frame and floor looms for at least 40 years and still learned some new techniques. And, icing on the cake so to speak, sound and photography -- in fact, overall production quality -- was quite good and added to overall instructional value.",1391126400,7,486,4.729411764705882
