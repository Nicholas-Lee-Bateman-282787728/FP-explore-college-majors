When I put the DVD into my dvd player, my dvd player said, ""Wrong Region.""  I have no way of seeing this movie I guess?  I will have to return this DVD.

I am so disappointed as I wanted to see this deep story and try to understand what Goethe was saying.",1369958400,2,495,4.051546391752577

5000575,5,B006KAPMVG,"Where I live, in Paris France, we are still lucky to have hundreds of movie theatres, and playing not only the recent Hollywood blockbusters but also all kinds of ""exotic"" films and ""cin&eacute;ma d'auteur"". So I just saw Sokurov's Faust, not on DVD, but ""for real"".

Powerful film, powerful vision, between Tarkovsky (Sokurov studied with him) and Wojciech Has (the film's atmospheres, between day-dreaming and nightmare, evoked&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hourglass-Sanatorium/dp/B006LGRIJS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hourglass Sanatorium</a>). Sets and costumes are breathtakingly imaginative. The story draws partly on Goethe's Faust (and Thomas Mann's Doctor Faustus), excerpts of the original text are even used, and the costumes evoke the author's time, the early 19th century; but the action is situated in some sort of German medieval village or small town, with narrow, dark, filthy streets - an environment evocative of the late middle-Ages/early German Renaissance in which the action of Goethe's drama is supposed to take place. And never was I shocked by any semblance of contradiction; it is true that German culture nurtured for very long a kind of medieval fantasy, and, before they were bombed to ashes by the Allies' airforce, the German cities retained vivid traces of their medieval past.

The universe depicted by Sokurov is hunger-ridden (to point to the burning demands of the flesh maybe), in a jawdropping opening scene (double-meaning not intended - but now it is) Faust is dissecting a human cadaver and doesn't find the soul, his apprentice the simpleton Wagner seems to have understood more things than his master, Mephisto is a pawn-broker and a usurer (money is the Devil), half-man half animal wearing his small traces of manhood in the back.

Once in a while it is great to see true human mugs on the screen, faces that you can easily fancy are those you would have seen anytime in the past before our era of hygiene and phenomenal improvement in health conditions - or maybe these days still in Russia - rather than your blandly and anonymously handsome Hollywood star, young or old. It is like eating a real tomato, grown in the earth, not looking good, but tasting so rich. But Isolda Dychauk, the Russian-German actress who plays Margarete, seen through the eyes and camera of Sokurov, is of breathtaking, angelic beauty.

There's a great sense of humor also, especially located in the character of Mephisto. Anton Adassinsky is phenomenal, a disturbing jester.

Of course, just as there is litterature and airport litterature, there is cinema and there is entertainment cinema - a difference the French understand probably better than the Americans; in fact, they think they invented it. Faust is cinema. Like the films of Tarkovsky it is a film that takes its time to unfold, and that time is part of its very nature and appeal. It is a film that talks and talks and the talk is part of its very nature and appeal - plus, it talks in Goethe's language, and at times in his words.

The cinematography, by the French cinematographer Bruno Delbonel, is phenomenal: my overriding impression was of monochromatic ochers, depicting, maybe, the mediocrity of this earthly life, except one scene, when Faust looks for Margarete in the Church, invaded with a blinding white. And the screen size: square, 1.33, evoking the early days of cinematography, as if one was watching a Murnau film shot today.

Now, what the film is ""about"", I don't know. Sokurov considers it the fourth and final pendant of his tetralogy on power and its corrupting effects. Maybe. I don't know. Sure Faust tries to ascertain his power over knowledge (fails) and over Margarete (succeeds). But really, that's not comparable with Hitler, Lenin or Hiro-Hito. That's what humans do, every day, not monsters thirsting for boundless power. I will not try to rake my brain too much and be content to consider it as a film on human desire, mankind torn between a lust for knowledge and lust for the flesh, and maybe it is the same lust.

I haven't tried to write a very coherent review (and if I did, I am aware that I failed), I'm just trying to convey the notion that it is a film that stirs complex, and powerful emotions.

5000576,5,B006KAPMVG,"Alexander Sokurov is in my view, the spiritual descendant of Andrei Tarkovsky. His filmography is dense, full of visual metaphors and cinematic time management like no other.

This time, Sokurov presents us with the eternal dilemma of Faust, but not as a crazy transition between the man who wants (like most) for eternal youth jointly with the ineffable attraction that provides knowledge.

But Sokurov does not seek to repeat the anecdote but delve into the most intimate of power granted by the science and how to obtain such hegemony is full of dissatisfaction, doubt and spiritual emptiness. The zeal to get at all costs Margarita's love is more than just a trophy than a goal. And Mephisto is portrayed as a mercenary and elementary merchant can sell your product.

The intriguing thing is that - at the end of the story, Faust is not redeemed, it is doomed to wander - as Dante in hell eternally for the most inhospitable  region on earth where it takes place an ethic revenge at the expense of dignity swollen with pride and arrogance.

The camera depicts with ruthless cruelty, the elemental life of people in the village, the homunculus phenomenon, the role of immortality as well as sharp reflections on the role of men in this world.

5000577,5,B006KAPMVG,"It seems that Alexander Sokurov had to appeal to the highest authority in Russia to get the financial support he needed to complete his final installment in his great ""Power"" tetralogy.  Vladimir Putin would seem an unlikely patron for Sokurov, who has long bucked authority ever since completing his studies at VGIK in 1979.  But, after an hour's discussion at Putin's country retreat, Sokurov had his backer.  Although Sokurov claims Putin was drawn more to the subject matter of the movie than to him, one can't help but think that Putin saw in Sokurov the international recognition he brought to cinema.  After all, Putin is more a power player than an auteur.

Whatever the case, we should all be thankful Sokurov got the opportunity to complete this marvelous film, which takes a whole new look at the Faustian bargain, seeing it more as a power game than a question of spirituality.  This might put off some Faust fans, but I think most will be mesmerized by the way in which Sokurov explores his subject, portraying Faust not as some Romantic but rather as an exceedingly rational man obsessed with knowledge, and determined to understand the underpinning of the universal order.

The film opens with Faust, as played by Johannes Zeiler, opening up the body of a man in search of his soul.  An amusing dialog takes place between Faust and his assistant Wagner (Georg Friedrich) as to where the soul might be located.  A disgruntled Faust has the dissected body carted away and goes to his father for a handout to keep him going, but his father shuns him, regarding his son's experiments as fruitless.

The devil is less a Mephistopheles than a devilish little pawnbroker, played to great effect by Anton Adasinsky, who leads the good Dr. Faust around a labyrinthine Medieval village, tempting him with Margarete, played by the radiant Isolde Dychauk, and eventually getting the doctor to ""autograph"" a book for him in blood for the money he needs to carry on his research into the soul of man.

There is virtually constant movement in the film, as in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Russian-Ark/dp/B0000ALPJ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Russian Ark</a>.  Sokurov gives the viewer little rest visually or in following the cascading subtitles, as he presents the dialog like a stream of consciousness, pulling from the lines of the play, inserting his own subtexts and even providing an amusing cameo by Chichikov and his manservant Selifan on the road from Russia.  There are many subtle role reversals as you wonder who is leading who in this existential quest.",1336435200,21,2611,5.129716981132075
8500109,5,B006KAPMVG,"In eastern cultures a mirror, and by extension the mind, is thought to be pure no matter how many images are reflected in it. Once the images are gone, the mirror remains stainless. Sokurov's Faust begins with a mirror hanging in the clouds, and forever after, the film's images are periodically seen reflected in mirrors. And, not in a perfect mirror, but curved, distorted mirrors that bend the images almost to the point, at times, of what you might see in a funhouse.

Despite the visual distortion, or because of it, and true to form as a folktale, Bruno Delbonnel's cinematography is luscious, painterly, and ever as the voyeur watching the characters' secrets, their hurry and confusion, their constant squeezing through narrow places as if they were being born again and again. The script is not without humor, but it rolls on heavily with Faust and the Devil's philosophical dialogue. This, however, is coupled with such stunning visuals, characters whose faces and expressions, hair and costumes are completely out of a storybook. A storybook that ends in eternity.

Anton Adasinsky is perhaps the prize as a backwards Devil, the most perfectly deformed being with endlessly fascinating movements of his body. Isolda Dychauk as Margarete shimmers like a painting and Johannes Zeiler as Faust often is befuddlement itself. Their love making scene is the best rendering yet that I've seen. Hanna Schygulla and Lars Rudolph lend their cameo appearances.",1487203200,,1460,5.130252100840337

8500114,4,B006KAPMVG,"This came out in 2011 and won the Venice International Film Festivals Golden Lion award, which I am guessing is the award they give to the MOST INSCRUTABLE film which therefore most voters feel must be saying something VERY IMPORTANT!

Sadly I never read Goethes original story (either the original or in translation) but from summaries it seems the director Sokurov kept at least the kernel of the story intact.

This is the fourth of a tetralogy of films by Sokurov meditating on the nature of evil.  The first 3 are based on real characters: Moloch [Hitler], Taurus [Lenin], The Sun [Hirohito], and then Faust, the main evil character in this film being the devil himself, or at the least one of his minions.
The films used Russian actors from the Saint Petersberg area, and for at least two of them, the voices were subsequently dubbed over by German actors from Berlin (as is the case here).  Having studied some German years ago, I was able to make out snatches of the audio, but good American-English subtitling is provided.  So in a sense, we are hearing dialog that started in Russian, then became German, then finally English in the subtitles.

The repeated translation of dialog is far from the only aspect making the film a little inscrutable.  Its almost like watching a dream unfold: the events as depicted are often hard to understand at least on the first viewing; often impossible or at least improbable from a strictly literal viewpoint, and obviously metaphorical in nature.  The filming has a certain haziness about it reminiscent of a remembered dream, in which the central image was clear enough, but the background was somewhat hazy and hard to identify.  Time doesnt skip backward and forward but often skips forward abruptly from one scene to the next [not far forward, but at least some hours].  Sometimes scenes are almost frozen; at other times much action is taking place [without much explanation].

The centrality of the story of Faust is a man selling his soul to the Devil.  Im not clear on the why of Goethes original story, but in the film at least the Devil seems easy to find, while God is basically unseen.  In fact one character goes so far as to say that he does not believe in God, but evil is obvious.  Second reason [at least in the film]: Faust is of a somewhat philosophical bent, and seems to think the Devil will have a broader perspective on reality than he could.  Third: hes HUNGRY.  As a doctor in a time of poverty, he himself goes to bed hungry, and doesnt have enough to pay grave-diggers for patients who die.  Fourth: for love [or lust?].  He has no family life and is enchanted by a young, single, common girl with beautiful ivory skin, piercing blue eyes and blonde hair [played by Isolde Dychauk].  Yet rather than asking for a full life with her: marriage, kids etc., he only asks for a single night.

Doctor Faust is played by Johannes Zeiler, with a combination of an aristocratic yet scruffy look, a kind and honest face but a gruff voice, which perhaps was a good way to show doctors in an age when the distinction between treating patients and conducting autopsies was hardly known; when surgery (without decent anesthesia) was perhaps the most successful practice, because antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals were pretty much unknown: a peculiar combination requiring the financial wherewithal for University study, but frequent witnessing of mortality in its most depressing forms.

Average peoplein fact most people and places were shown with the kind of poverty one tends to associate with the Middle Ages, and the original story was set at about the transition between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.

Goethes Faust had a major impact on later European thought and even on German expressions.  Sokurovs film, much shorter than the story, keeps some of the essential dynamics intact: good and evil, science vs religion, when the quest for knowledge leads us astray; wealth vs. poverty, the nature and possibility of redemption, but all infused with his own imagery.  Though it is meant as the end of a tetralogy, I think it can be appreciated on its own.  Ive also located 2 of the other films on DVD with English translations, but haven't yet found Taurus.  This film at 132 minutes, seemed a lot longer since it requires constant attention, and is far from the usual Hollywood fare.  Oh lastly I should mention, theres little in the way of swear words (and the audio is in German anyhow), not a lot of violence but some definitely disturbing scenes, and some female nudityin short, were it rated, it would probably get an R.  Hopefully this will help someone considering whether or not they want to watch the film.",1420502400,2,4692,4.780669144981412
