3844063,4,B00243HD2Y,"I know that millions of people read the novel and many of us felt cheated and manipulated throughout that book. The silly concept of the ""speed plane"" that flies from Boston to Geneva in like 4 hours warns the reader that the book is going to be VERY dumb. I can honestly say that this movie is better than the book and in fact is a decent action movie. Ron Howard thankfully cut the silly airplane part and removed the sexual tension between the ""bad guy and the girl"", which was also silly and unnecessary in the book. Also, a character who dies in the book surives in the film and I think that change gives the viewer more hope and encouragement for a positive outcome while still being suspenseful. Han Zimmer's amazing score and some stunning cinematography make this movie worth seeing, despite the far-fetched plot. Truly, this is one of the very few moments when I can say that the film is much better than the book and not the other way around.",1255564800,4,953,4.451428571428571
3844064,5,B00243HD2Y,"I rememeber when I first saw The DaVinchi Code in the theatre. I thought the movie was good but it didn't do the book justice. I thought the book was far better. Then Angels and Demons came out in theatres and was leary about going to seeing it because of the first movie. But I did go to see Angels and Demons and I loved it. The movie had my full and complete attention for the entire two and a half hours. In fact, I loved the movie so much, I walked with a smile on my face and bought another ticket and walked right back and in and saw it again!

This movie has it all. It follows the book but strays when necessary, but not to the point of where it ruins the movie. It is chalk full of action and suspence, a total on the edge of your seat movie. The choice of music complements the movie beautifully. I could go on and on.. but one of the things that really made me catch my breath was the portrayal of the passion and history of catholicism. The cardinals in conclave, climbing the stairs to enter the Sistine Chapel in the Apostolic Palace, St Peter's tomb, exc.

I highly recommend this movie. No movie since had captivated me in a way such as this one. Enjoy!",1254960000,55,1170,4.12719298245614

movie/tv dvd release dates I'm glad I decided not to pre-order Angels & Demons (it's a great movie).

3844066,3,B00243HD2Y,"""Angels and Demons"" is another of Dan Brown's complicated conspiracy thrillers. Not as good as ""The Da Vinci Code"" but along the same lines, again starring Tom Hanks as the symbologist, Robert Langdon. This time it's the death of a pope and a great deal of intrigue in the Vatican. As usual there's mumbo jumbo, hokum, hocus pocus, wild hectic headlong helter-skelter chases and quests.
 The movie unwinds at a fast pace so you don't have time to question the idiocies and intricacies of the convoluted plot. Even though he is hated by the Catholic Church because of his machinations in ""Code,"" Hanks is called in because four cardinals have been kidnapped and Vatican City may be in extreme danger. He is joined by a female scientist in the case though no love interest seems to develop. She is trying to get back some highly explosive anti-matter that her lab has produced.
 The trail leads to a series of four churches in Rome where a missing cardinal is to be found. The trail is similar to the rose line in ""Code.""
 A secret society, the Illuminati, with moles within the Vatican itself are the culprits, and you'll probably be struck dumb when you find out what they are up to. How a person parachutes from a helicopter at the crucial moment may baffle you. The crowds in St. Peter's Square, waiting for the election of the new pope, are shown frequently. The cardinals are meeting in a consistory in the Sistine Chapel to choose a papal successor.
 The movie has some great shots of Rome, the Vatican, and some great reenactments of ceremonies within the Vatican. The scenes, though staged, seem very authentic.
 Some of the film which, at times, is difficult to follow seems more opaque and obtuse because of some severe editing. Amid the skullduggery a monsignor in a skull cap is shown very briefly, and he comes into play several times. It's very difficult to figure out what he's up to and which side he's on. It's the good guys versus the bad guys, but we're not too sure about the motives of the good guys.
 Tom Hanks, though in charge, sometimes acts as mystified as we are by events, but, hey, he's already read the script, hasn't he?
 If you're looking for an exciting thriller, this may be up your aisle, but don't look for too much clarity or common sense. It's a corkscrew of a plot with its Byzantine conspiracies running amuck and astray.",1253836800,3,2360,4.6181384248210025
3844067,4,B00243HD2Y,"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE SINGLE DISC BLU-RAY VERSION ***

There's probably millions of physicists, theologians and hugely academic types out there who can't wait to poo poo ""Angels & Demons"" - the sequel to Dan Brown's ludicrously successful book and movie - ""The Da Vinci Code"" - I'm not going to be one of them.

While you wouldn't call it a ""Bourne-like"" masterpiece in terms of non-stop plot and thrills, A&D gets damn close - and almost all of the time. Sequel or stand alone - it's a brilliantly executed movie - and far, far better than its predecessor ever was, entertaining the weary pants off of you with real style, skill and panache.

To start with - ""Angels & Demons"" has the magic triple whammy - a really great cast who can bring gravitas to any part they play, a fantastically well-adapted screenplay from great source material (AKIVA GOLDSMAN and DAVID KOEPP who are both Oscar winners and nominees) and the best entertainment Director in the movie business today - RON HOWARD. I mean the guy just delivers time after time after time - ""Frost/Nixon"", ""Cinderella Man"" and ""Apollo 13"" are among his superb former credits.

It goes like this (and every word of the following is Gospel)... There's a plot to bring down the Catholic Church and replace it with an order based on science rather than faith, which may or may not have something to do with the ancient and mysterious cult of THE ILLUMINATI. Despite being purged centuries back by scared zealots in the Catholic Church, these are powerful people still in high places who have remained undetected down through the ages by the modern world - patiently waiting for their time of revenge. And an experiment in Switzerland has given them that chance.

TOM HANKS is back as the permanently po-faced Professor Langdon summoned by a devout priest (EWAN McGREGOR) to the holy city of the Vatican in Rome to protect the Catholic Church at a time of Papal re-election. A slick assassin who is prepared to carry out grizzly acts of torture (played chillingly by NIKOLAJ LIE KAAS) is killing off high-ranking Catholic cardinals in a countdown to an apocalyptical 'light' that will consume the throne of Christ's church on Earth. And wouldn't you know it, but poor old butter-brains Langdon has only 4 hours to work it all out and stop the end of...well the world frankly... Luckily he is ably aided by a particle-analyst in the shape of the leggy AYELET ZURER (it's a scientific fact that all lab scientists look like this woman - I swear). And on it goes....

It's all utter knob of course, but the historical linking of actual statues, churches and symbols all over the city make you believe every cleverly preposterous word of it. Throw in the brilliance of actors like ARMIN-MUELLER-STALH as a Cardinal who may become the next Fisherman and STELLAN SKARSGARD as the head of the Vatican Police who trusts no-one including his employers - and you have enough diversions, red herrings and word-like genius to make the men who make up the British Government's balance of payments forecasts positively blush with envy. It's brilliant stuff - it really is - and every scene is filled with it.

The locations and sets are all ace too - the catacombs under the streets, the reproduced airtight Vatican Archives and the ornate rooms in sumptuous buildings - all of it helps the stunning look the movie has - and the BLU RAY picture (no pun intended) is immaculate throughout. The extras are extensive and add to the experience nicely (an impressive amount of effort was involved) and the extended cut is included.

So there you have it. Whether or not you consider all organised religion to be a corrupting force or the very bedrock on which civilized society is based is not going to get talked about too much in ""Angels & Demons"" - it's far too busy trying to entertain you for all that stuff 'n nonsense... But you are more likely than you would think to get up out of your comfy chair, brush the crisps and curry off your faded Metallica teeshirt and say, ""Well, bugger me sideways with a can-opener from Mars...but that was damn good!""",1253664000,12,4098,4.705718270571827
3844068,3,B00243HD2Y,"Ron Howard turns the original Robert Langdon adventure from Dan Brown into a sequel to The Da Vinci Code.  Tom Hanks returns as the symbologist responsible for the exposure of the Catholic Church's sacred feminine conspiracy, this time hired by the Church itself to prevent a revenge attempt from an enemy scientific cult. The on-location shooting from the first film is substituted here with unconvincing computerized recreations of places like Vatican City, but its somewhat forgivable considering permission was not granted to film there. The booky pace of The Da Vinci Code is alieved here since Langdon is racing against a real-time threat instead of going up against a warble of historical puzzles. The plot moves faster, contains more action, and the players seem less like caricatures and more like characters. It's an improvement on its predessecor and worth a viewing even for those who didn't enjoy the first one.",1253491200,17,924,5.16
3844069,2,B00243HD2Y,"Not a complete disaster, but loses the dynamic feel of the book. Many of the details are changed including some major plot points and for no apparent reason other than to shorten the movie. The progression of the clues moves in a paint-by-numbers fashion.  I was looking forward to the movie and had high expectations given the director and actors. Very dissapointed.",1253059200,8,367,4.919354838709677
3844070,5,B00243HD2Y,"This is one of those movies that was truly better than its predecessor. The good thing is you don't need to see Davinci Code to understand this movie. Its like Ron Howard took it to heart what people were saying regarding the DaVinci code, it was good but needed some more action to keep you interested.

Angels and Demons does this perfectly. Still a great story line, but tons of action, and a great score.

I left the theater after seeing this with a huge smile on my face. In plain words...

It was awesome!

3844071,5,B00243HD2Y,"I enjoyed watching this movie when it came out in theatres. This marks Robert Langdon's first-ever adventure as a Harvard symbologist. Even though it is considered a 'sequel', I view it more as a 'prequel'. That's just how it is in the books.

I hope Tom Hanks reads the following... For 'The Lost Symbol' bring back your mullet style hair as you did in 'The DaVinci Code', just hire a better hair stylist this time around. Sporting your normal 'short hair' for this movie made me feel like it's just another Tom Hanks movie. When I saw 'The DaVinci Code' for the first time, I became excited because you (Tom Hanks) had a different look than most of your movies and I enjoyed it better than Angels and Demons. The longer hair fits the profile of Robert Langdon! In my opinion.

Do me a favor and get the Angels and Demons DVD. If you enjoy the Robert Langdon series, you will enjoy this and not be disappointed. Robert Langdon is my hero!!! Woo-hoo!",1252886400,11,950,4.485549132947977

The Victoria character in the book is so smart, independent and key. In the movie she's less than a side kick. Movie is full of church shaming, which is not what the book focuses on. The main character is also made to be as if he is a super genius.. which he is not.  He is human and requires help figuring out things.",1486771200,,434,4.105882352941176

3844385,5,B00243HD2Y,"With the upcoming release of the new Ron Howard-Tom Hanks thriller INFERNO Sony has chosen to re-release their first two original outings together with the Dan Brown character of Robert Langdon. Its a good thing to as some may have forgotten how great those two movies were. Not only that but it makes a great excuse for upgrading from the old DVD to blu-ray formats. And of those fortunate enough to have upgraded to the new 4k format it is available that way as well.

Ive reviewed the first film so now on to the second. This time around we begin with the passing of the Pope and a papal conclave about to begin to select his replacement. Coinciding with this is a test at the Hadron collider where a new form of antimatter has been created. One of the team responsible is found murdered with a word burned into his chest: Illuminati. In addition to that, one of the containers of anti-matter has been stolen.

Symbologist and religious iconography expert Harry Langdon (Tom Hanks) is called upon by the Catholic Church to assist in investigating the murder and helping to interpret the symbols being used, in particular the one on the dead mans chest. As the best expert in the field he is flown to the Vatican to assist only to find disagreement among the different security teams working there. Along with Vittoria Vetra (Aylet Zurer), one of the scientists from the Hadron collider and confidant of the recently murdered man there, the pair arrive just as a video message arrives for all involved.

Four members of the church have been kidnapped and are being held in a secret location seen on camera along with the container of anti-matter. As the recording plays out clues are offered as to what is to come. Langdon deciphers them to be a warning of the deaths of each and a final blow to the church to follow in the upcoming hours. But those clues also give him an idea of where to look for each coming murder and the possibility of catching the man behind it all.

The race is on as this film focuses not just on Langdons knowledge but the battle against the clock as one member is to be killed each hour from 8 until midnight. Each location will provide clues to the next. All of these clues stem from an ancient secret organization known at the Illuminati, religious followers who were persecuted for thinking there could be a co-existence between science and the church who went underground. Langdon is the perfect choice, the right man in the right place to try and stop not just the murders being planned but the possible end of the Catholic Church as well.

While featuring the same main character this movie is like the first film only in the lead actor and the polished look director Ron Howard presents on screen. The rest is far removed from that film in that this one spends as much time showing the race against the clock as it does Langdons attempt to try and figure out just what is going on and where. He finds himself drawn into conflicts where he has to become involved physically as well as mentally this time around.

Again the movie looks gorgeous. Howard has again assembled a crew that brings forth some of the most amazing scenes to watch, even more so when you learn that most of them were not even filmed in Vatican City or in the buildings there but on sets surrounded by green screens. The extra go into detail on how this was accomplished. Youd never know it while watching the film, a statement to how fantastic a job theyve done.

Hanks is again perfect in his performance as Langdon. That right combination of awe when confronted with things like the Vatican library and the locations each clue takes him to combined with that sense of urgency as he tries to save another life is something that would not be possible in the hands of a lesser actor. Ewan McGregor as the late Popes right hand man, now in charge until the conclave finally selects a new Pope, does a fantastic job as well. Zurer attempts to hold her own and does so but her part never really feels fleshed out.

As with the first film this movie stirs curiosity in the viewer making you want to learn more about the history involved and the icons on display. It pulls you in as a mystery and has you wringing your hands that the bomb is found before it goes off releasing a force as deadly as an atom bomb if not more so. And when its over it leaves you wanting more, which fortunately we will have when INFERNO is released. One can only hope that Howard and Hanks don't make us wait as long for them to film author Dan Browns other Langdon book, THE LOST SYMBOL. And if he write another lets hope they pick up on that one as well.",1477008000,,4638,4.461084905660377

One other point worth noting for those of you who are considering purchasing a HDR TV: Go for ones that support Dolby Vision in addition to HDR 10. All discs are currently on HDR 10, but having watched three such discs and also watched Marco Polo and others in Netflix that are streamed on Dolby Vision, Dolby is way superior.",1476662400,,556,4.514851485148514

Dan Brown is easily one of the worst writers I've ever encountered (I've yet to finish one of his books; the premise is generally too stupid to accept but I keep trying) but I guess his commercial success among the easily impressed (and hardy) readers demands a film.

The colour palette was not that intense.

Second, there was too much exposition, what is commonly known as talking heads syndrome.

Other than that, the story is as real as the action genre permits. The movie sugarcoat the Illuminati,
To avoid the dreaded adults only rating. The Illuminati as a secret society do exist, the only requirement
For membership being g a Satanist in good standing with a net worth of 300 million or more dollars.

The movie ends beautifully - with a vision of hell - to remind the Holy Father of his duty.",1459209600,,640,4.5964912280701755

For my 18th-Century styled living room, I wanted something that was classy, worn, that looked like it had some history to it. Then I discovered this Angels & Demons gift set. I bought it immediately.

The bookends are heavy; I wasn't expecting the weight of granite or anything, but they do their job in holding books upright. It's some kind of heavy or weighted plastic. The paint job is done to look like they're old, worn statues [see photos]. It is numbered on the bottom to let you know they are limited.

Dan Brown's books are among my favorites and the movies based on them and directed by Ron Howard are superb.  There is just no match for the cast and crew that  created this film.  The special effects are great , the acting is wonderful and the pace is non-stop action.  You would never suspect that all the scenes that take place in the Vatican are actually sets.  Brilliantly done.  Although, the story and some of the characters vary a bit from the original book, they do a pretty great job of re-creating a complex story and keeping the original premise of it intact.  The only drawback to this particular version of the film is that some of the scenes are very dark (as in poor lighting) and hard to see, which I don't remember being that way on the dvd.

3844656,5,B00243HD2Y,"Watched this film with a handful of travelers about to embark on a trip to Italy.

The storyline is compelling and suspenseful as Robert Langdon must unravel ancient clues from the Illuminati, and time is ticking down, literally, in the form of an anti-matter device.  Far-fetched?  Maybe, but Dan Brown brings the story together as masterfully as always, and Ron Howard has the monumental task of making the story work on a visual basis.  Neither ever fails the audience, and this film is a compelling piece of artwork (in my humble view).

This film is another one (along with Roman Holiday) that I watched with several fellow-travelers as we embarked on a trip to Italy.  I would highly recommend watching it, if for no other reason than seeing so many of the famous sights, but the film is gripping and will have you on the edge of your seat.",1441670400,,846,4.644295302013423

3844697,5,B00243HD2Y,"There may be something to be said for a getting a second chance. Ron Howard's film based on Dan Brown's first Robert Langdon offering, ""Angels & Demons"", is a tighter better-wrought experience than the first movie ""The Da Vinci Code"", which is actually the second Langdon novel. Tom Hanks is back as Robert Langdon, symbologiste formidable, Dan Brown's Harvard scholar who is always getting drafted to participate in political espionage that is also wrapped up in ancient and medieval history, culture, theology, tradition, symbols and artifacts. You might characterize this stuff as Robert Ludlum meets the History Channel. The beginning is slightly different than the book but keeps the spirit of it well intact.

The plot itself is not that dissimilar to the Da Vinci Code. A person has been murdered, an old man no less, in order that a person or persons calling themselves the Illuminati can pilfer a canister of anti-matter, which is as potent as a few nuclear bombs. The Illuminati, an intellectual order that rebelled against the Roman Catholic Church in the 17th century, have apparently reemerged to enact revenge for injustices perpetrated on them by the church 300 to 400 years ago. They have hidden the cannister somewhere in Vatican City, the smallest sovereign country in the world and the political and cultural center of the Roman Catholic Church. When the cannister's batteries run out the anti-matter will be let lose and turn the Vatican and part of Rome into the cultural equivalent of a US land-fill. The Vatican and its 1500 years of history, art, books, records, and architecture will be turned into something reminiscent of Hackensack, New Jersy.

And to add insult to injury, the Illuminati have also kidnapped four cardinals. These events also coincide with ""Conclave"", the small period of time when the Roman Catholic Church must determine the new pontiff, aka the pope. All the members of the College of Cardinals have left their respective dioceses from every corner of the world to attend the secret election of the new pope. During Conclave, the cardinals are locked inside an inner set of chambers of the Vatican and do not have access to the outside world until they choose a new pope. Of course, the four kidnapped Cardinals are some of the top contenders for the Office of the Holy Father, aka The Bishop of Rome.

Similar to the Da Vinci Code, Langdon must use his knowledge of church history, art and symbolism to find the canister and also save the four kidnapped cardinals. And do it all before midnight when the Vatican will turn into a pumpkin. The film is a nice blend of religious art history with the intensity of a political thriller that you might find in a Robert Ludlum novel. And being able to peruse the Vatican archives, arguably the greatest collection of ancient books dating from the early Middle Ages to the present time, is a scholar's dream. Simultaneously, the intensity never lets up for those who like the sensibility of an action thriller.

The outstanding performance of the film has to be Ewan McGregor as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, the priest who is the acting ""head"" of the church while a new pope is being chosen. In what seems a small insignificant role at first gains high import as the story unfolds. High marks for Hanks, reprising his role as Langdon, who seems to better understand his character than in the first movie. And Ayelet Zurer as Vittorio Vetra holds her own in a stellar cast. The only criticism I have is that the film glosses over her significance and the role of her father, a priest-turned-scientist, which is more fully developed in the book. In the book, Langdon first arrives at CERN, not Vatican City. Some have complained that Langdon's tour of CERN is completely left out of the film, including the late priest-scientist's study.

Still an incredible film, far superior to the recent Indiana Jones movie and the last National Treasure installment, with an incredible ending that makes the entire film. Not to give it away, but it rings of a counter-reformation Baroque-style fresco atop the ceiling of a Roman Church. This is one I will definitely have to acquire on DVD. If this is the best way for Americans to learn about their European cultural heritage, via an action movie, then so be it.",1432684800,,4290,4.8712328767123285

Now, I'm not a book purist by any means when it comes to translating them to movies.  I understand some things simply won't really add much to the story but there was a great deal in this book that was left out that would have made the movie even more interesting and compelling that I really wish they had included, I won't go into details so as not to give away any spoilers.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Angels & Demons takes place mainly in the Vatican, and is festooned with the rites and ornaments of Roman Catholicism, I might as well begin with a confession. I have not read the novel by Dan Brown on which this film and directed, like its predecessor, The Da Vinci Code by Ron Howard is based. I have come to believe that to do so would be a sin against my faith, not in the Church of Rome but in the English language, a noble and beleaguered institution against which Mr. Dan Brown practices vile and unspeakable blasphemy.

And it was partly, perhaps, because I chose to remain innocent of the book that I was able to enjoy Angels & Demons more than The Da Vinci Code which opened almost exactly three years ago to an international critical hissy fit and global box office rapture. The novel Angels & Demons was published three years before The Da Vinci Code.

The only people likely to be offended by Angels & Demons are those who persist in their adherence to the fading dogma that popular entertainment should earn its acclaim through excellence and originality. It is therefore not surprising that the public reaction so far has been notably calm. Theological hyperventilation has been minimal, and Columbia Pictures has not been accused of falsifying the history or corrupting the morals of Western civilisation.

Played by Tom Hanks in his high minimalist mode. Once again Mr. Hanks is accompanied by a ravishing international film star, in this case the Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer Munich and Vantage Point. She plays Vittoria Vetra, an Italian scientist, specialising in bioentanglement physics, whose role is to serve not as a romantic foil, but rather as his sidekick sleuth and fellow panellist in a high-velocity interdisciplinary seminar.

And as an exercise in extreme mass-market tourism Angels & Demons gives pretty good value. Unable to shoot in the Vatican itself, Mr. Howard and his team have deftly blended actual Roman locations with Hollywood stage sets and CGI images to make a dreamy, ephemeral Eternal City.

The costume and production design, all those red cardinals robes swirling dervish like in the incense-tinted light, those sensuous Bernini sculptures and soundless library stacks, nearly steal the movie from the bland, dogged heroes. Luckily an international squad of potential villains and victims, youll figure out who is which soon enough, since Mr. Dan Brown tends to let the wiring show when he rigs his surprise twists, has already carried out the larceny.

The interesting thing about this film is its treatment of the Catholic Church. Many have criticised the film and labelled it as anti-Catholic but I feel thats not a fair criticism. While the film is critical of many of the Catholic Churchs failures over the course of centuries, it does have a reverence for Catholicisms place in the world and as a source of hope and comfort for hundreds of millions of people across the world. The struggle between faith and science is not something that is easily reconciled and its something that is still a source of conflict today.

Ron Howard is a skilled and talented director and is one of the few actors that have made the transition from actor to full-time director with commercial and critical success. Ron Howard took the criticisms of The DaVinci Code and made improvements in the pre-sequel to quicken the pace. Rumour has it that Ron Howard and Tom Hanks aren't done with Robert Langdon and will be getting back together to adapt Dan Browns latest book Inferno in the coming years.

Angels & Demons is a great mix of tense action, religious intrigue, history, and conspiracy theories. Its smartly written, even if it does have some inaccuracies. Its also mostly independent of The Da Vinci Code with only brief allusions to the other story so if you haven't seen the first film you won't feel lost watching the second. If you enjoy history its worth a watch.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Presented in a 1080p encoded image and aspect ratio of 2.40:1 transfer that shows more detail and deeper colour than the Blu-ray I reviewed earlier this year of the extended version of the prior film. There seems to be a much greater variety of colours, textures, people and environments on display with this film, and the HD transfer appropriately reveals a satisfying depth of detail in everything from a CGI representation of a super collider at work to a depiction of a Vatican Conclave of Cardinals trying to elect a new pope. The marriage of CGI to real locations is fairly seamless, except in the very few situations when its clear that nothing but CGI could depict the visual. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Presented in an English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix in English and French. The mix provides clear dialogue from the front channels and no mean feat given the wildly varying accents on aural display here from the cast, along with effective use of the surround channels for atmosphere and music. There is some satisfying use of directional effects in the surround channels, particularly one search sequence within a construction area. As with the first film, the subwoofer gets a pretty intense workout, particularly during the big action sequences, the big music moments, and during the obvious opportunities like the aforementioned super collider event, and the films climax.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Original Theatrical Version [1080p] [2.40:1] [138 minutes]

Brand New Extended Version [1080p] [2.40:1] [140 minutes] The extended edition adds a mere eight minutes to the film's running time, and while much of the material is brief snippets of useless filler, there's substantially more gore during the violent encounters. To get a PG rating for the theatrical cut, many of the graphic shots had to be altered or eliminated, and they have been reinserted into the film here. The extended version definitely earns a 15 rating in the UK, and parents should be cautioned about potentially objectionable content.

Special Feature: Path of Illumination and Tutorial Video [1080p] This is an interactive tour of five major locations for this film in Rome: Piazza Del Popolo, St. Peters Square, Santa Moria Della Vittoria, Piazza Navona and the Pantheon. Each location has its own sub-page, containing clickable access to a glossary, some general information about the location, a brief 1080p clip about the filming there, story information about the clues found at the location, and basic information about the element discussed there. Each location also has a brief 1080p summary clip, and is narrated by Ron Howard.

Special Feature: Rome Was Not Built In A Day Part One [1080p] [17:00] This feature addresses some basic areas, from production and an interview with the producer and the 2nd Unit director, through to costume design, production design, visual effects, editorial, music, and the conversion of a Hollywood Park lot to a large exterior square.

Special Feature: Rome Was Not Built In A Day Part Two [1080p] [17:00] This is another brief collection of interview snippets and behind the scenes footage. Here, we see materials about shooting on location in Rome, building the films sets, making costumes for hundreds of people in the depiction of Vatican City, the work of DP Salvatore Totino, and a look at the filming of a fire stunt sequence. I suppose you could put this together with the earlier Rome Was Not Built in a Day featurette and have a more complete view of the film. Its puzzling why the two features were split apart in this fashion.

Special Feature: Angels & Demons: The Full Story [1080p] [10:00] This feature that discusses the casting of the film, and includes interviews with almost every major player in the film. THERE ARE MAJOR SPOILERS IN THIS FEATURE. Theres not a great depth of material here but mostly its just Ron Howard describing what a great actor is playing the part, and then the actor talking about what a great experience they had on the film.

Special Feature: CineChat: Send on-screen instant messages to your friends across the world while you watch the film together! An internet connection is required.

Special Feature: Movie IQ: While watching the film, this Blu-ray function allows you to bring up an on-screen trivia box, with information about each scene, from the cast to the musical score cue to the relevant part of Dan Browns book. Theres some interesting trivia here, but for the most part, I found this function to be limited in entertainment or informational value.

Finally, Angels & Demons is an equally successful adventure romp to the earlier film The Da Vinci Code. It doesnt have a lot of substance to it, and the mystery does not hold up to much scrutiny, but its very well crafted and its beautiful to watch. Fans of Ron Howard and Tom Hanks will have a great time here. I expect that fans of Dan Browns book may or may not completely embrace this adaptation and theres always an argument, but I had a great time with the film. I didn't find a lot of depth to the special features here either, but theres certainly enough material to keep fans occupied for an additional couple of hours past the viewing of the film, and some interesting material along the way. I would recommend a rental before purchasing, but this is still a fine HD transfer and a fun film to watch. Highly Recommended!

3844780,2,B00243HD2Y,"Tom Hanks returns as Robert Langdon, dedicated cryptologist and all-around smartest guy in the room, just in time to save Catholicism from conspiracy and MacGuffin alike. The film moves at a rapid pace, and excels at white-knuckled, buzzer-beating thrills, but it's got problems. Not the least of which is Langdon himself, who spouts like a broken nozzle atop the fountain of knowledge for the duration. OK, we get it, he's exceptionally smart and this is what he does best, but his act quickly grows redundant and tiresome. Not only does he know all the answers almost as soon as the riddle presents itself, robbing the audience of the joy of working anything out for themselves, he's also immediately ready to fire off a lengthy dissertation about the relevant historical figures, masterpieces and religious movements while muscling about various set pieces. That evil becomes necessary when the film quickly paints itself into a corner, setting a merciless time limit on each puzzle that pushes suspension of disbelief right out the window. Now, not only are we unraveling mysteries older than recorded time in less than sixty minutes, but we're also visiting libraries, slicing through political red tape and effortlessly navigating the whole of Vatican City, swamped by humanity in the midst of a papal election. Despite all that, I still held the film in good graces until the calamitous final act, which is capped by exploding helicopters, ludicrous swerves and a parachutin' pilot priest. More generic than The Da Vinci Code, it places a much heavier emphasis on nail-biting than convention-challenging, which is a shame because that's precisely the trait that set the original apart. Not quite disastrous, but dangerously close.",1416960000,,1737,5.207142857142857

Ewan McGregor is the star of this film; he gives an excellent performance as the antihero. Moreover, there isn't any similarity between THE Da VINCI CODE or this film; they are completely different.

3844803,4,B00243HD2Y,"Angels & Demons

 Angels & Demons is more enjoyable than the Ron Howard/Tom Hanks predecessor, the colossally successful The Da Vinci Code.  In a reversal of the chronology of the Dan Brown novels, Angels comes after the Code.  The movie is a faced paced thriller.  Hanks must find the villain before midnight.  Starting at 8 pm a man will be murdered every hour.  At midnight a bomb will rub out Vatican City.  Hanks must hurry.
 I read the novel recently, so surprises were out of the question for me.  I was able to concentrate on the beauty of the sets and the wonderful quick timing of the action scenes.  Director Ron Howard, now a well tried professional with 19 films to his credit, had a budget of $150 million to work with.  Boy did he spend the money wisely.  The interior scenes of Saint Peters Basilica in Rome are lavish enough for the most eye greedy.  The Da Vinci Code brought in a staggering $758 million world wide.  Angels is behind that with only $414 million so far, but it is still in theaters.  It ranked #8 this week after five weeks in general release.
 Hanks is one of our best loved movie stars.  He is at his considerable best in this film.  But for me it is really director Ron Howards film.  His sets are stunning.  The photography is inspired.  And the movie has those little details that are so important to the movie buff.  In one instance rival groups of protesters argue with each other in St. Peters square.  It is a realistic touch that lesser directors omit.
 This film is set largely within the most holy of sites in Christendom.  Matters of faith are dealt with dignity, complexity and sympathy.  This alone sets this film apart in todays Hollywood.
 This PG 13 film lasts 2 hrs and 20 minutes.  It earns a strong 3 and a half saw blades.",1412208000,4,1779,4.437888198757764

3844872,2,B00243HD2Y,"I always thought I have very low standards when it came to movies.  I like almost everything.  But evidently I saw a different film than those who gave it 4 and 5 Stars.  This movie sucked.

To begin with, Tom Hanks was pathetic in this movie. Indian Jones he is not.  An example: The bad guy is killing all of the police in a church and Tom can't seem to pick up one of their guns on the floor and return fire.  Instead, he escapes the carnage by pulling out an iron grate in the wall and falling into a basement.  He is safe, but the police that were protecting him are all dead.  Way to go Americano.  (If the film had been centered in France, the French police who help Tom out of the basement would have shot him.)

Another example: Near the end, he and the love interest and the police are chasing the bad guy through a labyrinth.  Tom never asks for a gun from the police, so when the police go one way, and he and the love interest go the other way, guess what?  He finds the bad guy -- but he has no gun. And do you think he says to the love interest ""Get behind me.""  Nope, it's every man/woman for themselves.  And facing the killer, he doesn't even have the sense to at least ask the major question of the film: ""Where is the goddamn bomb?""  Or the secondary question: ""Who's behind this?""  He simply goes mute. Wets his pants.  And the bad guy escapes.

Obviously, director Ron Howard does not portray Tom as an action hero.  Much more of a bookworm who happens to be caught up in an action film.  Woody Allen could have played this role better.

Also, Tom and Ayelet Zurer (the love interest) have absolutely no chemistry.  As a matter of fact, after she steals a valuable page from a book in the Vatican Archives, and a police officer questions him about it -- he rats her out immediately!  So much for his being a big brave hero.  (Truth is, I kept expecting his character to tell her he was gay.  That would get him off the hook for not smiling at her during the entire film, and being such a weenie in general.)

Also, this is another movie about a bomb clock ticking down and our ""hero"" must find it (before Vatican City is nuked).  The majority of Tom's dialog seems like he is reading from a text book to explain to us what & why the movie is taking place -- yeah, he pontificates in the pontiffs palace.  And note when he is involved in the action (i.e. running, climbing, falling) his dialog is limited to ""Over here, over here!"", ""This way, this way!""  ""Down here, down here!"" -- you get the point.

And I finally got to the point that I didn't care if they found the bomb.  I think it would have made a better ending if they didn't find the bomb and the whole place was nuked.  The Japanese in Hiroshima and Nagasaki would laugh their asses off.

For a better ""bomb clock ticking down"" movie, see The Peacemaker.  Palpable chemistry between the stars and great action.",1399161600,,2893,4.247706422018348

The assassin, responsible for the death of four of the Vatican's Cardinals, kills each in the manner of the four elements: Earth, Air, Fire and Water.

All in all, the acting is good, videography great, editing top-notch.  And the ever popular reminder, IT IS A MOVIE!  It's meant for entertainment.

I support others in their religion, as it is a very personal and often passionate choice. This film talks about the Illuminati in Catholicism in Rome. I suppose it is because I was raised a Christian and never exposed to much in the way of Catholicism, but I was completely unaware of the Illuminati. I had never even heard of them to this point. I know that much of what is showcased is for the drama effect, but this certainly wowed me. The history behind it was so intriguing. Tom Hanks did a wonderful job. This is a follow up, per se, to The Da Vinci Code. I was unaware of that until after I watched this film.

While much of the casting was good, the beautiful and talented Ayelet Zurer is wasted by a script in which she has very little to say. Let's hope Hollywood has bigger and better roles for her.

3844925,4,B00243HD2Y,"Rome was indeed the star of the movie. The visual splendor was a feast unto itself. A low key performance by Tom Hanks suits his role as the College Professor brought in by the Vatican to find the device which can destroy it and part of Rome as well. Several key male roles were quite well played with the only featured woman being OK. Admittedly, I am leary of any movie centered on a religion and its adherents,  when those elements are other than a background to the story. It is very easy to offend if one is dealing with other than the Father O'Malley (Bing Crosby, a Catholic actor) or Father Dowling (Tom Bosley, a Jewish actor) type of character and setting. If one can take these portrayals of the significant figures of the Church of Rome as being what they are, fictional characters in fictional situations, the film will be an enjoyable 'where is it going to happen' thriller. I call it that since the theme of most of the picture is 'will the Tom Hanks character  be able to find four kidnapped Archbishops before they are murdered' and, to repeat, a hidden bomb sufficient to do colossal damage.
I cannot remember my reaction to the earlier movie based on a Dan Brown novel, The Da Vinci Code, so I cannot compare it with this one. Taken by itself, it is by no means first rate, but it is good and worth seeing.,",1376870400,3,1326,4.408163265306122

3844938,5,B00243HD2Y,"""Angels & Demons"" is great! This is how the story goes: When Robert Langdon discovers evidence of the resurgence of an ancient secret brotherhood known as the Illuminati -- the most powerful underground organization in history -- he also faces a deadly threat to the existence of the secret organization's most despised enemy: the Catholic Church. When Langdon learns that the clock is ticking on an unstoppable Illuminati time bomb, he jets to Rome, where he joins forces with Vittoria Vetra, a beautiful and enigmatic Italian scientist. Embarking on a nonstop hunt through sealed crypts, dangerous catacombs, deserted cathedrals and even to the heart of the most secretive vault on earth, Langdon and Vetra will follow a 400-year-old trail of ancient symbols that mark the Vatican's only hope for survival.

The cast led by Tom Hanks (returning as Robert Langdon) is great! The directing by Ron Howard (who also produced with Brian Grazer, again) (who also directed Hanks in his first go-round as Langdon in ""The Da Vinci Code"" (2006), which was based on Dan Brown's novel, he also was nominated, recently, for an Oscar for Best Director for his work on ""Frost/Nixon"" (2008) is excellent! The screenplay (based on Dan Brown's novel, who also executive produced) by David Koepp (who also co-wrote the screenplay to ""Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull"" (2008), he also wrote the story and screenplay and directed ""Ghost Town"" (2008) & Akiva Goldsman (who also wrote the screenplay to ""I Am Legend (2007) & ""The Da Vinci Code"") is excellent!

The music by Hans Zimmer (who also did the music to ""Frost/Nixon"" & ""The Da Vinci Code"") is excellent! The cinematography by Salvatore Totino (who also did the cinematography to ""Frost/Nixon"" & ""The Da Vinci Code"") is excellent! The film editing by Daniel P. Hanley & Mike Hill (both also did the film editing to ""Frost/Nixon"" (Oscar-nominated) & ""The Da Vinci Code"") is great! The casting by Janet Hirshenson & Jane Jenkins (both also did the casting to ""Frost/Nixon"" & ""The Da Vinci Code"", they also did the casting to the upcoming ""Surrogates"" (2009) & ""I Love You, Beth Cooper"" (2009) is great! The production design by Allan Cameron (who also did the production design to ""The Da Vinci Code"") is excellent! The art direction by Alex Cameron (who was an assistant art director on ""The Da Vinci Code""), Luke Freeborn (who also did the art direction to ""Star Trek"" (2009) & ""Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull""), Marc Homes (who also did the art direction to ""10,000 B.C."" (2008) & the upcoming ""Robin Hood"" (2010), Giles Masters (who also did the art direction to ""The Da Vinci Code"") & Dawn Swiderski (who also did the art direction to ""Spider-Man 3"" (2007), ""Hancock"" (2008) & the upcoming ""The Rum Diary"" (2010) is excellent! The set decoration by Robert Gould (who also did the set decoration to ""Live Free Or Die Hard"" (2007) & the upcoming ""The Expendables"" (2010) & Richard Roberts (who also did the set decoration to ""The Da Vinci Code"") is excellent! The costume design by Daniel Orlandi (who also did the costume design to ""Frost/Nixon"" & ""The Da Vinci Code"") is excellent!

For this one movie I can get audio using an optical cable or I can get audio via HDMI by selecting 2 channel stereo on the Roku box, but not 5.1 via HDMI.  I have never had an issue streaming movies in Dolby 5.1 via the Roku box before so I believe this is a technical issue on Amazon's side.  Even so, I tried swapping out all of the HDMI cables and got the same result.  My issue is I use an ActionTec wireless HD transmitter / receiver which only has HDMI connectivity and as such I get no audio unless I opt for 2 channel stereo on the Roku box.  I believe the ActionTec transmits only in stereo so switching the Roku box to 2 channel stereo is a work around.

They are seen as harmless and scholarly, not wanting to hurt anyone and wanting to be ""gentle"" even to their enemies.  Though conspiracy theorists generally put the Papacy at the very top of the Illuminati pyramid, here the RCC is pictured as being very different from that, even the victims of the Illuminati in this case.  The Illuminati itself is pictured as a bunch of archaic cranks and stumblebums, not that hard to figure out and outwit.

If I were given to conspiracies I would say the RCC had tons of their faithful to paste good reviews for this movie.  But, I don't think it's a good movie at all.  The plot was grindingly slow and totally predictable.  You really didn't get involved with the characters.  The only interesting one was the rebel in the Vatican, but even he wasn't that interesting.

Though there are male & female leads, there is no romance.  The relationship between Hanks and the woman scientist is purely platonic, not even a hint of a spark between them.  Yaaaawn.

""We will destroy your four pillars.  We will brand your preferiti and sacrifice them on the altars of science then bring your Church down upon you.  Vatican City will be consumed by light.  A shining star at the end of the Path of Illumination.""

The above comes from this thrilling movie that was directed (and co-produced) by Ron Howard.  This movie is based on Dan Brown's novel of the same name.  (Brown also was co-executive producer of this movie.)

This film is a sequel to the movie ""The Da Vinci Code"" (2006).  (Note that Dan Brown's novel ""The Da Vinci Code"" (2003) was actually written after Brown's novel ""Angels & Demons"" (2000)).

The quotation that opens this review is actually a message sent to the Vatican from a secret and ancient scientific organization called the ""Illuminati.""  This organization wants to kill the four favourite cardinals (or senior priests) considered to be Pope (the ""preferiti"").  As well, the Illuminati want to destroy Vatican City in a blaze of light using a bomb--not just an ordinary bomb but an ""antimatter"" bomb.  Note that:

 (ordinary matter) + (antimatter) = (annihilation)

At his point, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks reprising his role) is summoned by the Vatican.  His along with a woman scientist's (Ayelet Zurer) mission is to save the four preferiti and locate the antimatter bomb.

I liked this movie because I found it to be an interesting blend of the ancient with cutting-edge science.  This movie is also beautifully filmed with equally beautiful background music.

One word of caution: you have to pay careful attention when watching this movie.  If you don't, you will likely get lost, and the rest of the movie will not make sense.

There is no stand-out performance in this movie.  However, Tom Hanks effectively advances the plot and Ewan McGregor gives a decent performance as an ambitious priest.

This movie was filmed in Rome, the U.K., and in studios in California.

So far, this movie has grossed about four hundred and eighty-five million dollars.  (This is pretty good considering that it cost one hundred and fifty million to make.)

""The Da Vinci Code"" was banned in many countries but this movie was banned in only one country--Samoa.

Finally, the DVD itself (the ""theatrical edition"" released in 2009) has five extras.  The most interesting extra, at least for me, is entitled ""CERN: Pushing the frontiers of knowledge"" (15 minutes).  This looks at one of the world's largest and most respected scientific research centers.  (CERN stands for the ""European Organization of Nuclear Research."")

CERN is especially important for two reasons:

(1) It is the birthplace of the World Wide Web.
(2) In 2012, its ""Large Hadron Collider,"" an ""atom smasher,"" is thought to have discovered what the media calls ""the God particle.""  (This particle is mentioned in this movie.)

In conclusion, this is a thrilling movie that definitely entertains!!

When Da Vinci Code came out, I had just seen National Treasure, and there were so many similarities, that I didn't enjoy it as much as I should have. Angels & Demons does what every sequel aspires to do. It takes the characters we like and puts them in a similar but different story. Tom Hanks is once again terrific, bringing an intensity that few others can match.

Third in the book the final brand was a diamond with earth, air, fire, and water.  It the movie the final brand was two crossed keys.

The video of the canister containing the anti-matter is broadcast using a wireless camera.  This means that it transmits on a certain frequency.  So that means there is a wireless receiver that 'captures' the video on the frequency being transmitted to be viewed by the vatican police. I am an electrical engineer have been involved in many, many, many wireless designs in the past and to my eyes it would be very easy to triangulate the location of the transmitter and find the canister very quickly.

Dan Brown weaves many story threads in to a tapestry of intrigue. The story takes place over a 24-hour period.  A positive thing about this tale is that it is told in a linear fashion with very few flashbacks except when it is necessary for a back-story.  In this story he treats Robert Langdon's character as if Langdon is not aware of many, well known technical items and theories; this may be true of Robert Langdon, but Dan Brown also irritatingly treats us as if we do not know these things!

On the surface, we are treated to a ""who did it"" and ""will we get there in time"" story.  We must separate the goats from the sheep. However, we are also confronted with science versus religion.  Is science and religion like oil and water or is science and religion just two of the facets of God?

The Vatican is threatened by an anti-matter bomb in the middle of a papal election. Four prominent candidates to the papacy are kidnapped and held incommunicado. Until they are murdered in various grizzly ways, that is. The secret order of the Illuminati claims responsibility, and Professor Langdon of ""Da Vinci Code"" fame is called in to crack their usual symbols and riddles. This time, he has to work even faster - the bomb is set to destroy most of Rome at midnight the same day. The usual suspects turn out to be the good guys, while the good guys turn out to be...well, Illuminati.

OK, I admit it. I didn't threw up when watching ""Angels and Demons"". The film is better than ""The Da Vinci Code"". But then, virtually everything is better than *that* horrendous production!

""Angels and Demons"" is also more irenic. This time, the old men of the Catholic Church and their security apparatus turn out to be on our side. The Illuminati are the criminals. The pro-occult tendencies of the first movie have been quietly excised, and I don't think anybody so much as mentions the Devil. The story ends with faith and science holding hands in the election of a new pope, while one of the cardinals gives Professor Langdon a precious document by Galileo. Amen to that.

As for the God particle...please come on. ;-)

I really wanted to diss ""Angels and Demons"", but I admit that it's OK as lighter Friday night entertainment (or Thursday night, in my case). I feel charitable nine minutes past midnight, so I'll give this film three stars. How about that?",1337212800,,1589,4.742753623188406

Vittoria Vetra (Avelet Zurer) has been working on the Hadrian Collider, and collected the first substantial bit of antimatter. It's perfectly suspended in a magnetic bottle, but the bottle relies on batteries that must be changed every 24 hours. Frankly, I found that rather artificial aspect of the suspense a bit hard to swallow. Anyway, using a rather gruesome method, the bottle was stolen from the lab despite extremely tight security. Probably an inside job.

Now the old pope has just died, and a conclave is called to select a new one. And during this time, an ambigram has shown up with the name ""Illuminati."" An ambigram is a neat bit of graphic art that reads the same upside down and right side up. There was a ""legend,"" according to Langdon, of four brands for earth, air, fire and water which were all done in ambigrams. One cannot help trying to figure how they were done hundreds of years before the sophisticated computer software necessary to create them today.

So why was Langdon called to the Vatican? Because four cardinals have been kidnapped, the four most likely to be chosen as Pope. A message is received from the Illuminati (or someone claiming to be them) that one of them will be killed at 8 pm, 9, 10 and 11, and the Vatican will be blown up at midnight. Langdon has written part one of his study of the Illuminati, and can be acknowledged as an expert on them. But he has been petitioning for some ten years to gain access to the Vatican archives so he can complete the second volume.

So, the Cardinals, minus the four kidnapped favorites, have been locked in the Sistine Chapel by the Camerlengo (Ewan McGregor), who was the dead pope's closest assistant and acts on behalf of the papacy itself until a new pope is chosen. He is thus available to help the Swiss Guard, the Vatican police, Langdon and Vetra to search for the kidnapped cardinals and ultimately the canister of antimatter.

There. I've set it up for you. There is much racing all over Rome, of course, looking for clues among the art treasures, in the Vatican archives, crypts under churches, and all sorts of creepy places. I'm not going to ruin the incredibly complex plot by telling you any more, except to remind you that just as the theft of the antimatter was apparently an inside job at the lab, clearly there is an inside man in the Vatican and nobody is to be trusted. OK; you can trust Langdon and Vetra; but watch the rest of them very carefully.",1336867200,2,2701,4.654088050314465
3844995,5,B00243HD2Y,"I really enjoyed ""The da Vinci Code"" --- both the book and the movie. I liked them both so much that it prompted me to read ""Angels and Demons"" which I actually liked even better.  When the movie came out, I had to see it and thought it was great.

Last night, my husband and I sat down to watch ""Angels and Demons"" --- me for the second time and him for the first.  I enjoyed it every bit as much this time around and he thought it was great as well.  I remembered most of the plot but it didn't diminish the impact, in fact, it may have made it better since I wasn't trying to figure everything out, I could just enjoy.

My husband often has difficulty following this type of movie but he didn't this time.  Things are explained well as the plot unfolds and you don't need to read the book ahead of time to understand what is happening.

Great casting (Tom Hanks is perfect in this role), a well-written script, and a story that is suspenseful.  What else could a viewer ask for?",1334448000,,981,4.180851063829787
3844996,3,B00243HD2Y,"I've not read any of Dan Brown's books, so my opinion that this movie is not as gripping as it could be shouldn't be attributed to any reaction to differences between the book and the film.  The flick is marvelously seamless in its combining of location and studio shots and computer-generated material.  Unfortunately, the nonstop action seems considerably less interesting than you'd find in an episode of the English TV series ""Spooks"" (called ""MI-5"" in the U.S.).  It essentially involves chasing around Rome in search of a bomb that is assumed to be set to destroy a lot of people and property.  I say "" assumed"" because the device's active ingredient is an eighth gram of ""antimatter"" filched from the CERN particle-accelerator facility in Switzerland.  The premise is that this stuff will raise some real hell when it blows.  This would probably happen, although it's apparently near impossible to assemble enough antimatter to permit building a bomb with it.

Anyway, the antimatter bomb has been planted by the philosophical descendants of early scientists persecuted by the Catholic church.  These people have also kidnapped four Catholic cardinals who are to be murdered in various religious sites around the city of Rome.  I guess killing cardinals and blowing up things are intended to bring about a revision in Catholic dogma.  The movie seems to have omitted the background info most of us would need to understand the historic relationship between the Catholic church and the bomber/kidnappers besieging Rome.

The numerous errors attributed to the novel, and I suppose also affecting the movie, have been gone into by various critics and involve the author's mislocating of historic structures in Rome, misspellings of Italian and religious names and terms, misrepresenting Catholic procedures, and so forth.  I suppose some of this could be excused as artistic license if it improved the story, but when so much of it exists, sloppiness in research and editing comes in for much of the blame.",1334102400,,2010,5.131901840490798

They, along with the English and Dutch (research the Paper Wars against Spain in the 16th century) have been masters at the art of deception and propaganda for more than 500 years. Moreover, this film is nothing more than brainwashing and perpetuating the Black Legend and anti-Catholic sentiment in our country by stealth indoctrination carefully woven in mindless entertainment (a very effective Zionist tool).

The Black Legend against Spain is part of a vast movement started by the enemies of the Faith to destroy the Catholic religion. It is not an isolated case; other Catholic countries like Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and Poland have had their reputations smeared for their adhesion to the Faith. The Black Legend seeks to throw discredit upon the Faith by building biases and prejudices against Catholicism. A current example of these attacks are Dan Brown's books ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""Angels & Demons"", a malevolent cocktail of fake scholarship, lies and half-truths. It seeks to instill in Catholics a sense of embarrassment and shame about the way in which their ancestors lived and practiced their faith. The effect is subtle but too often ends by Roman Catholics then doubting the truth of the Faith.

Which makes ANGELS & DEMONS one thrilling ride, but overall it's as lame as a pack mule swimming a mill pond.

We're all familiar with the story; suffice it to say Professor Langdon (Tom Hanks, reprising his role from 'The DaVinci Code'), accompanied by his appealing compadre Vittoria (Ayelet Zurer), rushes breathlessly from one Roman locale to another to prevent the murders of four cardinals who are in line to succeed the just-departed Pope; meanwhile a canister of antimatter must be found before it obliterates all of Vatican City.  And who, pray tell, initiated all of this chaos?  The Illuminati!  <<Shudder.>>  Only was it truly the Illuminati, or a desperate plot inside the Vatican to make Catholicism--and religion in general--more essential to mankind?  Only Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (a confused-looking Ewan McGregor) can answer that! This is a movie that rushes at breakneck speed from one depiction of carnage to another until the over-the-top ending has us chuckling under our breaths.  Yes, ANGELS & DEMONS is darn fun to watch, but it's as silly as The Three Stooges in hemp-colored vestments.

3845007,4,B00243HD2Y,"I was surprised at how entertaining this movie was.  Because The Da Vinci Code was, in most respects, an artistic failure, I had every reason to expect another dose of lackluster storytelling from its sequel.  But this movie is sharper, smarter and snappier than its predecessor.

This edition seems much less heavily laden with obtuse mumbo jumbo theology than was the case with The Da Vinci Code.  The action initiates furiously at the very beginning of the picture and it never slackens.  I wasn't ever bored for a second, and I'm not a religious person.  This is fundamentally an action flick and philosophical musing isn't really required.

The casting of all the major and minor roles is absolutely perfect.  Great casting usually results in a great movie and that is certainly the situation here.  Tom Hanks nicely underplays his hero's role and it is fun to watch him figure out the solutions to the various puzzles that are presented.  Those actors who play heroes masquerading as villains or vice versa also perform their duties flawlessly.

This is a wonderful movie, all in all, but the ending is a stinker.  I assume the ending is the same one that is found in the book, so the screenwriter really isn't to blame.  The frenzied action found at the end of the movie piles implausibility upon implausibility until it becomes a terribly silly situation. I wanted to laugh but I hated the senselessness of it all.

Just about anyone viewing this film could craft a superior conclusion to this story than the one that the movie has to offer.  So, see if you can write your own ending to Angels & Demons and just let it percolate inside your head.  Let the bad old ending simply fade away.",1315094400,,1696,4.698305084745763

3845009,1,B00243HD2Y,"I watched this movie simply to see how  bad it could become. I wasn't disappointed;

* Plot:  What plot?  It's nothing but a sequence of breathless rushing about from one glamorous Roman tourist spot to the next and then expounding, like some tourist guide, on why it's significant. 'Did you know that Bernini sculpted this fountain for Cardinal so-and-so?' Or.. 'You are aware that the Pantheon originated as a Roman shrine to all the Gods.' Etc. etc. Also,  the director over-uses a silly plot gimmick of which direction some famous statue happens to be pointing at the time as the indefatigable location of the next 'clue'. This is ridiculous since these statues have been moved and relocated countless times over the centuries and thus could not possibly be such reliable guides.  But,  nevertheless we're off again on a breathless rush to the next hotspot. So contrived is this that I half expected one of the locations to be some flashy wine bar with the latest vintages on display;  'Did you know that Barolo is Italy's greatest wine and can be purchased in fine stores near you? We recommend the 2007 vintage.'
Who funded this movie?  The Italian National Tourist agency?? The average James Bond movie is more believable than this idiocy.

* Acting: What acting?  All anyone does is stare with wide-eyed terror and gritted teeth the entire time as they're rushing breathlessly around.  There's not even a fun villian in the movie, as there at least was in Da Vinci code with Ian McKlellan and Alfred Molina. In fact the only reason I gave this movie one star was for the hot Italian chick who implausibly plays the nuclear physicist. I kept hoping she would rip her blouse off from all the exhausting rushing about. ""Professor Langdon, I hope you won't be distracted by my smoking hot rack waving in your face as we rush wide-eyeed to the next clue?. By the way Professor, did you know that my bra is made by Perla, one of Italy's top couture of women's undies?'

* Editing:  How many times do you have to watch cars speeding recklessly through the streets before you laugh out loud at the utter impossibility of that in Rome's famously inpenetrable gridlock?

* Music:  What music?  It's nothing but the usual pounding beat heard so much these days in a forlorn attempt to create excitement. Then the 'music' flips to etheral, choir Muzak whenever solemn faced cardinals progress slowly up flights of stairs in yet another tourist location. And then, like flipping a dial on your radio, back to the pounding beat.

This movie is so bad it's a college  course on how NOT to make a movie. Or one step further and it could have been one of those satirical 'Naked Gun' movies with Leslie Nielsen instead of Tom Hanks.",1314489600,5,2722,4.70464135021097
3845010,4,B00243HD2Y,"Angels and Demons tantalizes us with an ancient story of awesome secrets buried within the depths of Vatican City. It also contains a modern day conspiracy theory, complete with guns, car bombs, and double agents. I get why the political intrigue is there. You need some sort of clock ticking for these things to generate excitement. But so help me, I wish we could get rid of the gunmen, the security tapes, and the nuclear devices and just follow this agnostic professor as he unlocks a puzzle from the distant past.

Tom Hanks is superb as always, racing from historical hot spot to hot spot as he follows a hidden path across Rome. The biggest thrills are when he takes something arcane or cryptic, and provides a new way to look at it so that you can almost see the door unlocking before you. It works best when the director shows us the puzzle first, like a good magician, and it's much more fun to have Hanks come in and offer the solution. Fortunately, this is most of the time.

It works not so great when we have Hanks explaining stuff to us as we race down the crowded streets of Rome, on our way to stop the next assassination attempt. There's a whole angle involving the selection of the next Pope, and the kidnapping of the four leading candidates, that propels Hanks forward. This is compounded by a truly over-the-top ""God Particle"" device that threatens to prematurely punch the city's ticket to Heaven, and its disposal in the critical moment is even more outrageous. And that's before the twist ending.

But get Tom Hanks and his pretty scientist companion alone in a dark chapel, hunting for hidden insignias and secret crypts, and Angels and Demons turns into highly compelling entertainment. It doesn't court the same controversy as The DaVinci Code, and therefore is allowed to stand on its own as pure entertainment, and it is top notch filmmaking.",1313452800,5,1872,4.683890577507599

Be that as it may a movie is modern storytelling and the important question is did you enjoy the tale?

I found the film somewhat a disappointment. It was a case of alot of glitz but no substance. The production values are first rate with an accomplished cast to match and the central character Harry Langdon is more complex and fascinating than, dare I say it, Indiana Jones (did I just hear thunder from on high). Yet with that said I must also say that I never got caught up in the story. There was no emotional connection, no pounding heartbeat, no anticipation of what was going to happen next.

3845013,2,B00243HD2Y,"Intro: I do not usually review movies on Amazon. It would take forever... But some of them are so dumb, or dull or clear examples of propaganda.

1) this movie has mixture of factual boloney, anti-Catholic and anti-Christian rants.

2) boring and predictable for the most part story.

I've read and watched DaVinci Code. It was not as bad storywise, considering you DO KNOW the history and watched it as fiction. This one however not just wrong on history, it is boring and dull. Honestly, I was expecting better.
From the most retarded phrases imaginable (22m:20s ""science obliterates religion"") to idea that Illuminati were persecuted by anti-science Catholics scientists, to idea that there are such thing as ""five element of science"" (which happen to be fire, air, earth, wind...) and all in between is seems like Dan Brown ONCE AGAIN failed to do his homework.

There's another episode, which makes you think ""what was that?!"". When the hero symbologist walks in Vatican (or where ever it was) with other person, he sees naked male statues along the wall with their genitals covered with leaves. Symbologyst gives of course tour of history as some pope in the past took a hammer and chopped off the genitals, and covered them with leaves. Now, the guy who was accompanying symbologyst asks ""do you have something against Catholic Church?"" to which he replies ""No, I have something against vandalism"". This of course should make you think, 'hmm, is this symbologyst some sort of a queer?"". Why in the world, would any man would want to see male genitals on statues? :D
Look at this different way. If statues belong to Vatican, and they decide to chop them apart it is their business. If I have inherited a statue from my grandma, it is not for symbologyst to tell me what to do with it.

Now, Illuminati. If you have heard this word before it is most likely it was not associated with science. This is rightly so. To say Illuminati were closeted scientists is ridiculous. Illuminati were/are(?) a typical secret society. And as all secret societies the main reason they exist has to do with rituals and perhaps secret 'knowledge' only for initiated, and perhaps mutual obligations of members, and perhaps strive to control masses of people.
To be honest, when I heard word Illuminati mentioned in the movie first time I was sort of excited, expecting some interesting insights. Alas, my expectations not just failed. Illuminati presented in this movie about as accurate as Christianity is presented by Hollywood - that is COMPLETELY wrong.
If you share my interest in knowing about secret societies perhaps you may look at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Invisible-Empire-A-New-World-Order-Defined/dp/B003H23KSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Invisible Empire: A New World Order Defined</a>&nbsp;which is sort of informative.

And what with the 'elements of science'? So-called elements are nothing more than vestiges of alchemy or some sort of witchcraft, or pre-Socratic philosophy... nothing more.

Considering boloney that Christianity is anti-science, Dan Brown should better do his homework. From, popularizing usage of codex, to printing press, to founders of scientific disciplines (as in genetics for example)... one has to be completely illiterate to believe this.

All in all, I paid $1 to watch it. It is about it's cost. Of course time spent is a different issue...",1308960000,2,3421,5.2413162705667276

***SPOILERS***

The problems are only for the people who did read it

 ****LAST CHANCE TO AVOID SPOILERS*******

Ron Howard (One of my favorite Directors) appears to have made way too many arbitrary changes that don't advance the plot. Here they are in the order that they occurred to me while watching the film.

1st, CERN does not bring in Langdon, the Vatican does.  This cuts out the entire CERN Director 11th Hour Samaritan plotline. The first brand is not actually a brand but a fax copy of the Illuminati ambigram.
I can argue this either way due to time constraints but I did not like it.

2nd, Olivetti is no longer the Swiss Guard commander for reasons that make no sense at all. This makes Richter the new Swiss Guard commander with Olivetti in a support role. The film lists this as part of the jurisdiction nightmare that is Vatican City. Since Olivetti dies on schedule, this makes no sense to me. Richter could still have done his part. But without the CERN director Richter takes that role in trying to unmask the Camerlengo with a new character taking Richters place as the second person to die as an Illuminatus in the Papal office.

Since the director is no longer in the film this has to be done by someone. Might as well be Richter.

2nd a. It is made clear that the events unfolding are after the DaVinci Code not prior as it was written.

Again I am sure that this was to avoid confusion to the people who had not read the book.

3rd, Changing the professional killer from an ASSASSIN from the Middle East with Misogyny issues to a paid professional actually worked for me. Right up until this paid killer actually takes a vehicle, prepared by his employer, which is supposed to have his final payment. No way would that happen. A hired hit man has to worry about his employer as well as the authorities. Someone who did that job for a living would not just walk into that lame trap especially after all the other payments had been EFT to his Isle of Man Account. If I am not mistaken, the Isle of Man is a tax shelter that has very strict banking laws about giving account info to anyone. Cops included.

Since this guy is no longer a misogynist that takes away the entire Vittoria has been kidnapped for immoral purpose plot. This takes away Langdon's more personalized reason for wanting to find the Temple of Illumination. Okay that means we never hear about Yoga or that Landon never gets his carnal reward by having hot, wild, intense sex with a Yoga Mistress.  For personal reasons, I will say that is something not to be missed if the opportunity is available, BELIEVE ME.

Also, no fight between the Assassin and Langdon & Vittoria. I wanted to see it.

4th, Langdon saves the fourth preferiti, Cardinal Baggia. I will refer back to this because it allows a major change. One that serves no purpose that I can tell.

5th, they removed all reference to the Illuminati Diamond. They changed the sixth Brand into a set of crossed keys to indicate the Papacy. Why?

This change served no purpose.

6th, as a direct result of the 5th change, we get a condensed version of
the Camarlengo's divine revelation of where the Antimatter is.

Again I believe this to be a time constraint versus Plot pacing. Could be argued either way.

7th, Langdon does not get into the helicopter with the Camarlengo.  This COMPLETELY removes the saved by possible divine intervention sub-plot. One of the things that I truly wanted to see in this film was Langdon's Fall and Survival.

This is where the filmmaker lost me. That scene is pivotal to this story.

The Camarlengo is SEEN using a parachute rather than the appearance of Divine Intervention which also negatively impacts the story, in my opinion.

8th, Instead of an audio recording of the conversation between the Director and the Camarlengo, we get video from Richter's office.

I won't quibble about this except to say I preferred the scene as it was written in the Sistine Chapel.

9th, We don't get to hear the Camarlengo defend his actions to the entire College of Cardinals. Granted we do see him try to justify himself to Richter so I guess the exposition is in there but because of the way it was done we lose the entire Pope as actual parent to the Camarlengo due to artificial Insemination of his former Nun mother sub-plot.

AS stated in the book, the use of artificial means meant that the Pope
was still celibate and therefore not in violation of church law. I can only assume that this was removed to keep the peace with the Catholics since they don't seem to be very reasonable on this issue. This is just my opinion and is not meant to offend but merely clarify. Reasonable people can disagree without reducing their opponents to evil caricature.

A direct result of this revelation to the Camarlengo was his self-immolation. Instead we have a priest who is running from authorities and decides to kill himself. I prefer the book version.

10th, in a direct result of 4th change, Cardinal Baggia is elected Pope instead of the Great Elector cardinal. No reason given. No reason for this change that I can see. Totally arbitrary and without purpose.

Nobody wakes up one morning and decides they're a psycho, like the camerlengo does in the novel.  It's an insult to the reader's intelligence.  Also, the movie mercifully omits the media nonsense, the pope as biological father nonsense and leaves us with a nonsense-free experience that's believable.  I highly recommend the extended edition over the regular one, even though it's only about eight more minutes of footage.  Those eight minutes are valuable ones that flesh out the characters and plot more completely and that's almost always to the benefit of the viewer.  I only wish I could find an extended edition of Howard's first Langdon movie, the DaVinci Code.

3845025,3,B00243HD2Y,"The *only* people who should be watching Angels & Demons are those who actually understand and follow the Pope, the Illuminati, the Cardinals and everything else associated with the Vatican City because if you DON'T follow any of these events, I can promise you- you WILL be completely lost and uninterested.

Such as the case with me unfortunately. Being a non-religious person nor someone who follows the Pope or the religious history connected to the events portrayed in the film (whether fictional or not, it doesn't matter) I wasn't able to comprehend a single thing concerning any of the stuff presented in Angels & Demons so as you can probably imagine, I was completely confused and unsatisfied.

The second half of the film is devoted to quite a bit of action and suspense, however not being able to even remotely understand the storyline makes all that action and suspense completely ineffective and almost comical for unintentional reasons. Comical because there's no reason someone like me should be watching it.

You're probably asking yourself ""Why bother writing a review for a movie you didn't get?"" and the reason is very simple. Let me explain.

It would be completely ignorant for me to give Angels & Demons a low rating just because I wasn't able to understand any of it. However I believe it's important for me to write a review for those out there reading who might be leaning on the fence deciding whether to see this film or wondering whether it will just be a giant bundle of confusion. I can say with certainty- yes, it *will* be confusing.

I can almost guarantee those who don't know the history of the Pope or his religion -nor those who keep themselves up to date with the Vatican City events- won't be able to grasp the storyline. Even in the film they say there's over 1 billion Catholics. That means there's 7 billion who aren't, which definitely increases the chances of more people not getting it compared to those who do.

Obviously not all 7 billion people on the planet will have access to this film, but that's beside the point. Angels & Demons is designed for those who follow and get the plot, which is a minority.  The description did not warn me about this.

As for Tom Hanks, his acting skills are right on the money like always. However I prefer the easily understandable storylines he's starred in over the years such as Forrest Gump or Castaway.

3845026,4,B00243HD2Y,"The Pope has passed, and in the moments before the preferiti - the Cardinals next in line to be the Pope - are to be notified of succession, the Illuminati kidnaps them before their seclusion.  The mysterious and clandestine Illuminati plan on killing all four Cardinals at altars along the ""Path of Illumination,"" and then destroying the Vatican with stolen antimatter from CERN.  Paired with CERN scientist Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer), noted symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is summoned to neutralize the Illuminati's threat by saving the Cardinals and recovering the antimatter.

What is apparent upon first viewing is a heavy dosage of Dan Brown's influence, that Tom Hanks is Robert Langdon personified, and themes of technology versus faith flow seamlessly into all facets of the film.  The visual aspects of A&D are absolutely stunning.  Considering Roman Catholic officials wouldn't allow filming inside any of their churches, the visual smorgasbord is even more impressive.  A&D has everything from St. Peter's Square to the Vatican and Sistine Chapel, it's what amounts to history and landmark pornography.  To look for some of the intricacies from this film while wandering throughout Rome might be ridiculous, but the special effects are done so well the viewer may get the feeling of a Frommer's tour guide.

If Brown's meticulously researched style is your thing, then this wonderfully translated movie - despite its differences with the book - is sure to excite.  Fast paced and full of enough thrills to distract from the esotericism inherent in all of Brown's work, the action and acting are balanced predictably well for a big budget film featuring Hanks and Ewan McGregor.

Bow down to the religious conspiracy in this adult version of National Treasure.  Honestly, taking Nicolas Cage out of any movie is a good move, amirite?

The plot was well thought out and the amount of research Dan Brown put into the book clearly translates to the movie in a very interesting way.  I thought the plot was pretty good and it kept me on my toes right until the end.  The ""bad guy"" aspect of the movie really threw me for a loop as I had always assumed the guy with the glasses that was killing the Cardinals was the one they were after, but the ending was shocking when we learn who was really behind it all.

I am not religious at all, I am an atheist actually, but I thought this video showed a side of the church that not many people get to see and also made some very appropriate points in its message.

Dan Brown Da Vinci Code is a book based on the Gnostic Pagan work not the Bible. Dan falsely claim it to be from the Bible, misleading millions. Dan uses the Gnostic Gospel's were named after known bible characters to justify ""Gnostic"" doctrines
:Gnostic works contradicted the Both Old and New Testament scriptures...The God of the Old Testament was viewed as an evil demon and the serpent as good.
:Gnostic works were not connected to the Apostles...but battled their teachings
:Gnostic works quoted from the scriptures to weave in their doctrines...but the scriptures do not quote from Gnostic works.

The Gnostic took Christian names and terms and rebuilt Greek paganism.

:The God of the Old Testament was a God of the Jews and a low level evil angel who trapped mankind in a physical body. They called him,  ""The Blind one"", ""Demiurge"" the lesser power.
:Jesus came to deliver ""Gnosis"" knowledge from the ""All-Father"" the unknown God.
:Christ did not die on the Cross, but only a phantom.

Is the Da Vinci Code  the book accurate?

The Book is filled with historical and factual errors. Here are just a few to make the point.  If this book is wrong on such minor points why would anybody trust it for eternal issues?

  Brown's Error: The book claims there are 666 panes of glass on the pyramid outside the Louvre.  The Museum says there are 673.  (Page 21)

  Brown's Error: The book claims the Olympics were held for Venus in 8-year cycles but they were actually held for Zeus in 4-year cycles.  (Page 36)

  Brown's Error: Mona Lisa is an androgynous portrait representing the fusing of male and Female (Page 120)

  However, Mona Lisa is a young Florentine woman who in 1495 married the well-known figure, Francesco del Giocondo, and thus came to be known as ``La Gioconda'`.  This is confirmed by the discovery of documentation in Florence, Italy archives.  She had five children and two became nuns.

  Brown's Error: Sir Isaac Newton was a secret ""Goddess Worshipper"".  Yet it is well known that he was a devout Christian ...who wrote a commentary on the book of Daniel and Revelation and calculated the physical return of Christ between the years 2000 and 2050

  Brown's Error:  The Dead Sea Scrolls were found in the 1950's and included the Gospels.  History clearly show that these scrolls were found in 1948 and there were no Gospels found there.

  Brown's Error: The Gnostic Gospel, The Gospel of Philip was not written in Aramaic as the  Da Vinci Code implies but in Coptic, translated from Greek. (Page 246)
-------

Mary Magdalene was part of a group of women who were followers of Christ along with the disciples.  She was a witness to his resurrection and healing but nowhere in the Gospels is any marriage even hinted at in the slightest.  Jesus healed Mary Magdalene of demonic possession, the idea that Mary was the harlot of Luke 7:36-50 is only made because Mary Magdalene is mentioned in Luke chapter 8, following the story of the adulterous women in Luke 7:36-50.

  But the adulterous women of Luke 7 is not noted for demonic possession, but for adultery, she is told, ""Go and sin no more"", there is no mention of demonic possession, therefore Mary Magdalene is not the same women.

3845037,3,B00243HD2Y,"Ron Howard has led a team of who's who in Hollywood to crank out another one of the town's patented ""Must-Be Blockbusters.""  In times of yore, Hollywood would crank out ""must-see"" movies that were so good that, if you missed them, you felt like the village idiot.  Now, however, when an author writes a smash hit (and Dan Brown's ""Angels & Demons"" surely qualifies), Hollywood invests hundreds of millions buying and adapting the book into a movie, leaving no expense unspent in its quest to crank out a sure-fire smash hit.  So expensive are these movies that they become products of a thousand hands, trying to maximize the tickets sold rather than just tell the darn story as well as the author did the first time.

And so it is that ""Angels & Demons"" hit the big screen and went away without raising so much as an eyebrow.  This non-essential film is satisfied to hit the necessary high points of the book within the time allotted (no three-hour movie here - we have to get enough screenings per day on 3,000 multiplexes).  All the marks are hit - Tom Hanks is the acting royalty in the lead, Ron Howard is behind the camera, and top-notch screenwriters, composers, cinematographers, and make-up staff on on the scene, probably down to the top Key Grip in the industry.  But the movie progresses from scene to scene without generating a hint of tension or interest, and when the final credits roll you wonder, what was the point?

""A&D"" tells a dark, sinister, thrilling story.  A dangerous quasi-religious sect has kidnapped four candidates for the papacy after the death of the beloved Pope.  Proclaiming vengeance for the Catholic Church's repugnant persectuion of scientists over the centuries, the Illuminati promise to murder these priests along with blowing up half of Rome with antimatter.  Dr. Robert Langdon (Hanks) is whisked away from the Harvard swimmming pool to save the HQ of Christendom, which is a little strange because everyone in the Church heirarchy is still mad at him over the recent events in Paris in ""The Da Vinci Code.""

A pell-mell race against time ensues, but one that unfortunately skims over the coolest aspect of the book - Dan Brown's explanations of the various symbols hiding in plain sight throughout the Vatican.  Hanks remains Tom Hanks, one of my favorite actors.  But it gets tiresome that he rubs up against movie stars in every conceivable role, or if they aren't movie stars then they are clearly in the ""Hey, It's That Guy"" club.  Remember the scene at the end of ""The Player,"" when the movie that was supposed to be made ""with no stars"" eventually becomes a bloated mess starring Bruce Willis, Julia Roberts, and every well-known supporting actor in Hollywood?  That's ""A&D"" in a nutshell.

I saw an interview with Tom Hanks where he talked about filming ""A&D.""  Like Mel Brooks saying, ""It's good to be the king,"" Hanks waxed nostaligic about sitting at a sidewalk cafe in Rome waiting for the filmmakers to get a scene set up.  I think we can all agree that Hanks likely had a terrific time making this movie.  It doesn't mean that you're going to have a great time watching it.

The only thing that is truly terrific about this movie is its capturing of the beauty and majesty that can be found in Rome and the Vatican.  Statues, domes, fountains, and even cobbled streets shine with a divine glory everywhere you look.  For that alone, the movie is recommended.

But if you want a thrill ride through Rome and the Vatican, courtesy of the murderous Illuminati, I suggest you just read Dan Brown's book.  You will see what the movie missed.",1291593600,,3594,4.730337078651686

What was worse was the fact that there was ghosting of the image on my screen as if the compression had been done at a low quality setting. The delightful crispness I've grown accustomed to with most Blu-ray transfers was completely absent here... to the point that I double checked the disc to make sure that it was, in fact, a Blu-ray disc.

This film features a few nail-biting scenes, so it is not as boring as its predecessor.

The kind of film that manages to look at once expensive and cheap, it's a lot less effective than the first film - the casting is much poorer, the script considerably weaker (especially one big rallying speech) and the absence of flashback montages makes the exposition seem far more perfunctory than its predecessor, not least because Hanks seems so bored with it all for much of the movie. Even the literal ticking clock device that drives the plot fails to produce any tension despite the high stakes, the villain and his motivation fairly obvious through heavy-handed writing and a couple of strikingly unconvincingly acted scenes long before the absurd sequence involving an anti-matter bomb, a helicopter and a parachute...

Everything is more run-of-the-mill here - even the internal Vatican politics play like the kind of TV miniseries that went out of fashion in the 70s, complete with a feelgood finale that sees its medieval conspiracy theory proved a blind and its atheist hero firmly back in God's good books to reassure the faithful that God is in his heaven and all's well with the Church.

  I've never been a big fan of the material Ron Howard chooses for his movies. The 'Da Vinci Code' and 'Angels and Demons' are no exception. But by the same token I will concede that Mr. Howard has come along way as a director. Most of his films are technically brilliant and he has evolved in his abilities to direct his actors.

  After consulting Wikipedia's article on this film, I learned that there is actually an organization, CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) and there actually is a contraption, the 'Large Hadron Collider'. I also found out that the organization spent a good deal of time reassuring the local population that what they were doing was safe. Therefore, the whole idea that they could create anti-matter in three small cylinders, which could be capable of creating a low-grade nuclear-like explosion and then some psycho could somehow get through security at the facility and steal this anti-matter, was laughable.

  If you're a Vatican History buff, you'll find 'Angels and Demons' just up your alley. The story begins with the death of the pope and a papal enclave is convened to choose the pope's successor. You'll find out who the 'preferiti' are--the four most likely candidates to be elected pope; they're kidnapped and immediately the Vatican police assume that the the Vatican's nemesis, the Illuminati, a secret society persecuted by the Catholic Church dating back to the time of Galileo, is behind the nefarious deed. In a nutshell, The Illuminati were the 'free-thinkers' who were suppressed by the Church during the Enlightenment, due to their advocacy of science. Later they supposedly turned violent and held a grudge against the Church for years.

  Tom Hanks plays Robert Langdon, the Harvard symbologist who is summoned by the Vatican police to save the four cardinals. Also called in is Vittoria Vetra, the scientist at CERN who's in charge of replacing the cylinder's batteries since once they run out, the explosion will occur (where was the Energizer bunny when you needed him most?) Langdon demands access to the Vatican Secret Archives where he discovers clues in a banned book by Galileo. The clues lead to four points of the compass in Vatican City, representing the four elements--fire, earth, air and water. Langdon deduces that the four cardinals will be murdered at four altars at these four different locations.

  Langdon races around Vatican City along with the Vatican Police trying to save the four cardinals. The first three cardinals are dispatched in the manner associated with each particular element: Earth: Cardinal #1--suffocated by dirt; Air: Cardinal #2--lungs are punctured; and Fire: Cardinal #3--burned to death. Langdon manages to save Cardinal #4 who is dropped into a WATER fountain in a weighted gurney. The fourth Cardinal clues Langdon into the Assassin's lair--where the four cardinals had been held earlier. The police find the killer's van at a Mausoleum but conclude it's a dead end. Langdon and Vetra find a secret passageway and end up confronting the assassin who holds a gun on them. He reveals he's been hired by the Catholic church but has no orders to kill them so he lets them go (not at all credible). Langdon finds the last clue in the form of crossed keys, the Papal symbol. He concludes that the final victim will be Camerlengo McKenna (a priest who is chief administrator at the Vatican). The crafty assassin who outwits everybody, is unconvincingly outwitted himself by stepping inside a car and getting blown up by a car bomb (who worked that out, I have no idea!).

  Now here's how all this nonsense is saved by the twist ending (SPOILER ALERT!). We're led to believe that the Camerlengo is the good guy. He tries to convince Cardinal Strauss, the head honcho at the conclave to evacuate the Vatican, since the anti-matter is about to explode. The Cardinal, and the other stuffed shirts want to follow their protocol in choosing the pope, so they decide to rely on the Vatican police (along with Langdon) to save the day by finding the anti-matter. Also when Langdon finds the Camerlengo with the chief of the Vatican police, it appears the Illuminati have already branded him (just as they did with the four other cardinals) and the Camerlengo blurts out that the Police chief is in league with the Illuminati (so he gets killed). Finally, when the anti-matter cylinder batteries are about to run out, the Camerlengo (who believe it or not, has training as a helicopter pilot) takes the cylinder up into the clouds in a helicopter, where the anti-matter explodes but kills no one. The Camerlengo parachutes to safety and is hailed as a hero--in fact, the conclave (using an arcane rule) wants to vote him in as the new Pope.

  The twist is when Langdon, using a key the Vatican Police Chief gave him just before he dies, unlocks surveillance video stored on the hard drive of the Chief's private computer, revealing that it was the Camerlengo who was the bad guy all along. Not only did he kill the three cardinals but also his adoptive father, the Pope himself. It seems that the Camerlengo was mad at the Pope due to his liberal stance toward science. After Langdon reveals the plot to the Papal enclave, the Camerlengo commits suicide by setting himself on fire.

  Ron Howard did well in concluding that the Da Vinci sequel needed to move at a faster pace. And kudos to the production team who recreated Vatican City without having any access to shooting there. Despite the positives, I did sit through most of 'Angels and Demons' with a smirk on my face. After all, the entire premise is based on completely implausible events. But I have to admit, the twist ending at the end is so clever, that I didn't see it coming at all! And yes, I'm willing to say, despite all the hokeyness, to a certain extent, it won me over.",1276473600,2,5880,4.851148851148851

3845055,3,B00243HD2Y,"Angels and Demons(released May/09)brings to the screen yet another Dan Brown novel of the same name. Like its' predecessor(The Da Vinci Code)Brown throws together a mixture of historical fact,conjecture and mythos to bring to vivid life another story involving the Church,its' past and it's atonement for past sins. Unlike the former movie,this film is almost apologetic in its' tone at times,especially near the end giving the viewer a more even approach to the subject matter. It also has a different focus than Da Vinci.
The story here involves the return of the Illuminati. This was a group formed as far back as the 8th century but in the 1500s included many scientists(Galileo was reputedly a member)and intellectuals who thought the Church's dogma and control of science and scientific ideas was flawed and wrong. The Church in response publicly killed four of its more prominent members and now the Illuminati,it would seem,is out for revenge. Their target is the LHC(Large Hadron Collider) in Switzerland where anti-matter has been produced and subsequently stolen by them. At this same time the Pope has died and a new one has yet to be voted into office. Carmelengo McKenna(Ewan McGregor)is the person officially in charge until a new pope is elected and he is overseeing the Cardinals all being sequestered to vote a new Pope in. Before they can go into conclave four of the Cardinals up for election are kidnapped by members of the Illuminati. The Vatican sends one of its' security team to the US to find Robert Langdon(Tom Hanks)to assist in finding the captured Cardinals.
There is a serious twist involved in the Cardinals rescue. Each one will be executed on the hour starting at 8PM and at 12AM the missing anti-matter will explode killing thousands of Vatican citizens and visitors. Langdon is introduced to the head of the Swiss Guard who is directly responsible for the Pope and Vatican security,Commander Richter(Stellan Skarsgard).He is very much aware of Langdon and his work and two consistently butt heads as the investigation takes them on a windy path. Langdon finally latches on to the first clue and they travel the city from one end to the other trying to locate where the bomb and Cardinals are located. Langdon is even given access to ancient Vatican archives which helps them to narrow the search area. Three Cardinals are unfortunately killed as the police and Langdon arrive just a little too late,but ever so closer with each point searched. The final Cardinal to be executed winds up in a deep fountain which Langdon witnesses;tied and weighed down by weights on a trolley. Calling for help Langdon finally manages to rescue the Cardinal and learn the whereabouts of the bomb/antimatter.
The bomb is located right below the modern Vatican in the Necropolis,the foundation of the modern Church where St Peter himself was executed,upside down. Langdon and the police race back. In the meantime Commander Richter has confronted the Carmelengo in his office,alone. When screams are heard the security force breaks in to find Richter standing menacingly over the Carmelego who is shouting he is the one and has a gun(pointing to Richter).Richter is shot as another papal official comes running in also bent on doing the prostrate Carmelengo in. He is also shot. There is no time to think or act as all race down to the Necropolis and finally find the vile of antimatter. They are unable to change its batteries which would have enabled safe transport back to Switzerland,so in an apparent act of selfishness and higher calling the Carmelengo takes the vile and flies with it(in a helicopter)straight up as far as it will go and out of harms way. All watch the helicopter go out of sight then a glimpse of a descending parachute,just as the explosion occurs. All in the square are knocked to the ground and as the blast wave subsides the Carmelengo comes drifting in unconscious to the ground.
While the Carmelengo is being tended to by medical personnel Langdon makes a discovery on Richter's security video. The real truth comes out that the Carmelengo staged the entire Illuminati threat himself. Richter confronted him with the truth and unfortunately the unsuspecting security men had no idea what the real situation was and shot him and the other papal employee by mistake. The video was brought to the attention of the sequestered Cardinals and the Carmelengo was summoned to account for his actions. The Carmelengo was cornered as he tried to leave the Vatican and killed himself in a horrible fiery death. As Langdon leaves he gets a thank you from Church officials,the newly elected Pope(the cardinal he managed to save) and an ancient booklet of which he had repeatedly asked for but had been denied.
I found this movie a little less engaging than the first one. The acting throughout is great but the premise hasn't got the bite of the first one. The first movie was full of Vatican complicity and intrigues dating back to the origins of the Church itself and doesn't make apologies for its stance. This film seems to be making amends for the first and the controversy it created...big time. Sometimes the script even sounds as if members of the Church themselves wrote it,as near the end when Langdon is told that the Church is flawed because it is run by men,who are also flawed. And the Carmelengo is given several good lines regarding the Church,its' good intentions and deeds. This has the effect of rendering the scripts bite down to a slight scratch at times. It also makes the movies center shift away from possible Vatican complicity in shadowy undertakings to focusing more on the Langdon angle and his amazing abilities to unveil the clues for the race against time to save the Cardinals and the Vatican itself. Much different from the first film which was what made it the huge success it was.
Technically the movie has been transferred wonderfully as is the sound. It is in its 2:40:1 aspect ratio. The 2 DVD set extras include the featurettes:""Rome wasn't built in a day"",""Writing Angels and Demons"",""Characters in search of the true story"",the story of the LHC,""Handling props"",a look behind the scenes of the movie,and a interview with the real John Langdon. Impressive extras they are.
In conclusion I do recommend this film to all. If you liked the Da Vinci Code you will like this one but be warned in the end the tack that has been taken in this film plot is quite different from the first. Vatican complicities and wrongdoings are not so much the focus this time,as is the hunt to find the truth instead.",1275177600,,6570,4.887992831541219
3845056,5,B00243HD2Y,"The Da Vinci code movie came out in 2006, but I was just this year seeing it. Great, great movie. I've never actually read the book, but the movie makes me want to get it. The movie suggests that Mary Magdalene was supposed to lead the church and not Peter based on the perception that it was Mary Magdalene that sat next to Jesus at the Last Supper and not a man.

Which leads to Angels and Demons. First, I must say that this is a movie you MUST watch from start to finish. Do not assume once everyone is ""praising"" the Camerlengo that it's over. Oooooo, that's where the BEST part begins! This movie is even better than the Da Vinci code! I love movies that tie religion, science, conspiracies, and history all together! Dan Brown's next movie ""The Lost Symbol"" is not set to be released until 2012. Oh boy, can you imagine the hype for this movie? The year 2012? A Dan Brown conspiracy movie? That spells a classic!

3845067,5,B00243HD2Y,"Spoilers

The movie is far superior to The Da Vinci Code since it contained suspense, betrayal, murder, a detailed look inside the Catholic Church without the anti-Catholic slant, a look at some aspects of choosing a new Pope, and wasn't an overtly critical essay like Da Vinci. Director Ron Howard even corrected some inaccuracies from the book. Tom Hanks got a better co-star with Ayelet Zurer. Fiesty and full of hope for the future not a critic. Ewan McGregor, as always, was brilliant in the film and, in my opinion, stole a lot of thunder from Hanks. Ayelet Zurer was the only one exhibiting his acting prowess. The movie was intricate and fooled you to the end. It actually, despite Hanks and Ron Howards anti-religion slants, told what a real Catholic was and what a bad one was, and how God can work in mysterious ways. Stellan Skarsgrd stood out as the Swiss Guard chief. Without Stellan Skarsgrd, Ayelet Zurer, and Ewan McGregor, this film would have been poorly done with an expensive budget.

Tom Hanks was the star but really the story and his fellow actors, especially the other three I mentioned, poured a lot of heart in this movie and upstaged him.

The movie does have some humor and is not heavy. If you don't know the ending, you'll be shocked who the real villians are. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and is NOT anti-Catholic. The story's twist and turns, sometimes ending back at the begining, and the awesome cast make this movie an incredibly worthwhile experience. I'm pretty sure some Pope ended up Pope the wrong way in the past. However, this movie is inspiring even for Christians and Catholics if you set aside your inquisition tendacies. God works in mysterious ways even though Dan Brown, the author, Tom Hanks, and Ron Howard definitely didn't want it too.

3845068,3,B00243HD2Y,"It is most important I start writing this review by stating that I do not read Dan Brown's books.  I saw film ""Da Vinci Code"" and was suprised that most viewers were commenting on Tom Hunks' haircut.  This time around his haircut is in much better shape.  Also this film is set in Vatican and Rome and many of the beauties of the area make film so much more appealing to the audiences.  Premise is interesting - scientists in Cern, Geneva are searching for the antimatter.  If proven to exist, this will be a basic particle from which universe was created.  Is it possible to reconcile this scientific ""proof"" (in real life anti-matter is not discovered yet) with the old traditions of christian faith (Catholic faith in particular).

The inconvenience of the situation is that the pope has died and the new pope is not selected yet.  In a situation where there is no appointed leader of the 1 billion faithful Catholics around the world, power struggle is imminent between Vatican's police, security and priests placed in temporary power of the Holy Seat.  I loved the beauty of the city of Rome with its architectural delights and catacombs.

There was a lot of hype and controversy surrounding the Da Vinci Code book and movie, and to be honest with you, after seeing the moving I was disappointed and just didn't get all the hype.  The movie just didn't intrigue me.

Angels and Demons on the other hand surprised me.  I watched the movie with low expectations, thinking it was just going to be more of the same, but it wasn't.

There was much more action and suspense, and the movie moved along quickly.  Also, the locations and photography were stunning, and as much a part of the film as the actors were.

The opening scenes were actually filmed on site at CERN, but that's just about where reality ends in this movie.  The plot line involving CERN and the ""black matter"" stored in cylinders similar to what bank drive-thru tellers use to shuttle paperwork and deposits between themselves and the drive-thru clients is pure science-fiction.  The sought after particles (i.e. the Higgs-Boson particle or the ""God"" particle) as well as any anti-matter that might be created by CERN dissipates within fractions of a second.  Technology has come a long way but it hasn't come far enough for this movie to not be science-fiction.

However, with a healthy suspension of disbelief Angels & Demons can be quite an enjoyable movie to watch. Despite the rich symbols and carefully crafted dialogue, sets, and plot it still retains the fun factor of an intellect action movie which makes this movie worth watching again.

The Da Vinci Code is a very complex book and it is difficult to translate that complexity into a movie, even for an accomplished director like Howard.
In contrast, Angels and Demons is a more or less a straightforward story and that is discernible in this movie. Granted, the screenwriters have taken some liberties with the book, but that is par for the course for book adaptations. The result is that Angels is a far more rewarding movie than Code. It is exciting from the beginning to the end - this applies even to the longer version included in the Blu Ray. The acting overall is very good and so is the setting - Rome and the Vatican. The art director, set designers and costume designers have all done their homework remarkably well, down to the tiniest detail. The film can be enjoyed regardless of whether you have read the book or not.
This is easily one of the best films I have watched recently - and one of the best blu rays too, from a purely technical viewpoint. The packaging is excellent. My Sony Bravia enjoyed the feast of colours thoroughly and the sound system loved the intense workout. The extra materials could have been more comprehensive and one does feel shortchanged on that count.

STARRING: Tom Hanks, Ewan McGregor, Ayelet Zurer, Stellan Skarsgard, Pierfrancesco Favino, Nikolaj Lie Kaas and Armin Mueller-Stahl

WRITTEN BY: David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman; based on the novel by Dan Brown

DIRECTED BY: Ron Howard

Rated: PG-13
Genre: Thriller
Release Date: 15 May 2009

Being arguably the best actor in Hollywood, Tom Hanks could probably make any bad movie good. Throw in additional acting talents like Ewan McGregor, Stellan Skarsgard and Armin Mueller-Stahl and the brilliant directing of a genius like Ron Howard and can you really go wrong? I doubt it.

Angels & Demons is a big bright and shiny Hollywood adventure and isn't afraid to show it. Its premise is absolutely ridiculous and everyone in it knows it and we know it; especially if we saw the first installment, The Da-Vinci Code. Going forward from there, we can relax and enjoy it for what it is.

Tom Hanks (a religious man who believes in God in real life) received a lot of negative press, when he filmed The Da-Vinci Code. That film was even more absurd than this one but Tom's argument was that the point of the film was never intended to be taken literally. It's an adventure film; nothing more. The same goes for Angels & Demons and I am sure he and director Ron Howard and everyone Else involved, will go through it all over again.

What's the touchy subject matter? Why, religion of course. The first film focused on the belief that the Bible was filled with lies about who Jesus Christ really was and this one deals with the dark underbelly of the Catholic Church and its oldest enemy: science. So can we forgive the filmmakers for obviously not being allowed to film on location? I think we can. You can hardly notice anyway; they did a great job re-constructing Rome. I wonder if they built it in a day.

I have heard from others that they believe the film doesn't necessarily try to make the Catholic Church look bad. I have my own relationship with God and am in no way Catholic at all so I'm not in the middle here and I say very sarcastically, Yeah Right! What are you going to tell me next, that W. was a pro-Bush film?

I found it blatantly obvious that the filmmakers are against Catholicism. Now I haven't read the books (yet) so maybe they are just adapting the material to the screen as was previously written by Dan Brown, but even if that were the case, it still seems like some things were purposely placed in the film. Maybe it's just the artist in me that picks up on these commonly missed subtleties in films, or maybe it's all in my head. After all, what makes my opinion better than anyone Else's? The only advocate I have for it is that as of yet, I have never once disagreed with myself.

We see Priests talking on their cell phones, wearing dark sun glasses and smoking cigarettes, in their robes. Some may not see anything wrong with this and I am not implying that this makes the characters bad people. But you have to ask yourself, `Why did they show us that shot?' It's a very quick shot and then it's gone, so what was its purpose?

It is constantly mentioned throughout the course of the film that the Catholic Church has covered things up over the years. I'm not saying that this isn't true; I'm just saying it's in the film. Even at the end of the film, all of the events that just took place are covered up and the information that is put out to the press is a lie.

When one member of the Church tries to express how the Church gives to the people, he is shut down with the fact that the Church is also a bank and houses at least one Mercedes and several people's assets.

SPOILER ALERT: If you haven't seen the film, just skip this paragraph. I'm sorry but this point just has to be disclosed. Let's not forget the fact that the villain in the film is the only character who completely disagrees with science and is 100 percent pro-God (as far as we know he is the only one, some others may be as well, but it is not shown to us). I'm not saying the character isn't bad (yes he is a murderer); I'm simply saying that this priest is made into the villain and his faith in the Lord is stronger than anyone Else's. It feels a little weird to me. Why would you want the villain to be the only guy in the film sticking up for God completely, if you weren't trying to make the Church look bad? This does make for an interesting plot twist, totally. I'm only referring to the point that to me it is obvious that there is anti-Catholicism viewpoints pressed upon us in the film. There is also the scene where he burns himself alive at the end of the film; I don't think I need to discuss that one any further. And in the scene with him and the head of the Swiss Guard towards the end, they clearly wanted us to side with the opinion of the Guard over the Priest; thus he having no comeback to what was said, even if he was wrong.

There are several more of these elements but I haven't even gotten to the plot yet.

The film starts off with a very dangerous weapon being stolen from a Swiss laboratory. The weapon is simply a special something created through science known as anti-matter. Next we have the death of the Pope. Now someone must be chosen to take his place. Coincidentally four of the favorite selectees are kidnapped and the Vatican is notified that at eight, nine, 10 and 11 p.m., one-by-one they will be murdered throughout the city of Rome. Then at midnight, the stolen anti-matter will lose its battery juice; causing it to explode and completely annihilate Vatican City.

The conflict in the film arises from an old enemy of the Catholic Church, known as the Illuminati; a group of scientists who seek revenge for the torment they once suffered from the Catholic Church for simply expressing their scientific beliefs. Of course, none of the Catholic characters in the film ever deny that these things took place and none of them shine light on the fact that it was wrong. It was so long ago that it is sort of brushed off and accepted.

As if the plot itself doesn't have `Big Hollywood Movie' written all over it, every single sequence from there out is a fun movie-magic-ride, reeking of warm buttery popcorn.

Enter Tom Hanks, returning as Robert Langdun; the awesome symbolist who isn't afraid to poke fun at his own profession. We meet him in a swimming pool at Harvard University, of all places. He is met by a man requesting him to accompany him to Rome. Langdun has a brilliantly written opening set of one-liners. We are forced into liking him instantly.

Langdun has been requested by the Vatican (despite the bad taste he put in their mouth with all of his shenanigans from The Da-Vinci Code) to help them discover the locations to where the priests are to be executed. We learn that Langdun's side goal in the film will be to obtain the missing documents he needs from the Vatican archives (which he was denied several times by Vatican Officials) to finish his novel. He has no outright intention of going about achieving this goal; we just know that it will at some point come up again, because we have all been to the movies once or twice and that makes it fun.

The Church teams him up with a woman who for cinematic purposes will accompany Hanks around Vatican City as a form of eye candy and someone to exchange various dramatic one-liners with. Again, fun though. Plus they throw in a plot joiner slash back story that her father was murdered when the anti-matter was stolen, so naturally she'd want to be a part of all this.

The entire thing seems pointless. Why wouldn't the killer just murder all of these priests and then blow up Vatican City? Or better yet just blow up Vatican City with the priests inside? Why all of the cat and mouse chasing around? The answer is because then the movie would be over, silly.

Langdun somehow knows exactly where to look for clues in the Vatican archives (although he has never been there) and of course manages to use those clues to find the location of the next victim. Once he arrives at said location, he finds more clues to lead him to the exact location of the priest.

Meanwhile, there is another side-story going on back at the Vatican. It has been discovered that the previous Pope was in fact murdered.

Ewan McGregor gives an outstanding performance as Camerlengo McKenna and is grief stricken at this discovery. He's a high priest, put kind of in charge but not entirely as he still gets his but chewed by Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) while they seal the doors to their private chamber to select a new Pope.

No-one seems bothered by the fact that their fellow priests will be slain. Even after a few of them actually are murdered, there is still no cause for alarm or a need to show emotion.

The Swiss Guard has implemented a strategy in hopes of finding the killer by randomly shutting down power grids to certain locations of the city. This adds to a great deal of suspense to the film as our characters are already pressed for time as it is, and of course undoubtedly some of them will become trapped when this happens.

Is the movie a bit over the top? Definitely. Is it worth your time anyway? You-betcha. If you are of Catholic faith will you be left with itchy elbows and an upset stomach? Probably, but at least you will have been entertained.

The movie does exactly that. It entertains us and what adds to the value of its entertainment isn't the story and the ridiculous plot; it's the great characters and the amazing actors that bring them to life, that keep us intrigued. Everyone did a great job here. Armin Mueller-Stahl could very well be elected the next Pope; and after his performance as the Swiss Guard, Stellan Skarsgard will have no problem starting his own security company, should he ever tire of acting.

Ron Howard is brilliant behind the camera whether he's doing a comedic classic with Jim Carrey (Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas) or a Masterpiece of suspense like Angels & Demons. Yes he may make some people uncomfortable with this film; but that's why there's Cable folks.",1264809600,,10057,4.494794520547945

And what I thought was a main part of the storyline... The media aspect was also left out. It seemed like the whole point in the book was that the camerlengo was trying to get the word out about God, and he was using the media to do so.

3845110,3,B00243HD2Y,"I confess:  I fell asleep -- twice -- while trying to watch the Da Vince Code, so I wasn't exactly anxious to see this movie; however, Angels and Demons kept my attention from start to finish.  Although it wasn't great cinema, at least I didn't have to listen to Tom Hanks talk in rapid fire exposition just to get to the next scene.  Instead of offering intellectual treatise on centuries of conspiracy, Angels and Demons is more physical, more visceral, with the fear of mass destruction taking the front seat to the finer details of the Illuminati.  The film is more or less a series of chase scenes, with Robert Langdon (Hanks) teaming up with physicist Vittoria (Ayelet Zurer) to stop the imminent murders of four cardinals as the other cardinals meet to elect a new pope.  The kidnapper has a dangerous capsule filled with anti-matter stolen from Vittoria's lab at the Cern Accelerator, and its detonation could destroy all of Vatican City and a good portion of Rome.  Add tension between the Camerlengo (Ewan McGregor) and Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) who presides over the conclave, and the plot gets just enough complexity to add a twist or two.  The only aspect that is truly annoying is the time-line:  the characters have only an hour to identify and get to each location, yet they seem to take their time until the last minute.  And there's no way that everything that happens could do so within the amount of time described.  Just suspend your disbelief, and go along for the ride.

The conspiracy theory in Angels and Demons is less intricate than that of The Da Vinci Code and thus makes for better cinema.  The simpler plot allows for one chase scene, one murder, one explosion/fire after another.  For this reason, it is an exciting action film without offering much to consider in retrospect.  It is decent entertainment, but not much else, making it a good choice when you want your adrenalin to course and your brain to coast.

First off I liked the movie the first time I saw it, it was visually stimulating and had a plot that went smoothly. With that said, I understand they took liberties with the screenplay cause they can't include everthing from the book. But, how do you change characters that are pivotal to the story line. How do you make a charcter that Dan Brown spent so long describing and develpoing totally disappear from the movie. Let me explain:

-They deleted Maxamillion Kohler the founder of CERN intirely form the movie, he is the person to discover the journals and expose the Camerlengo for who he was.
-How do you make Vitoria discover the body when Kohler was the one to discover the body in the book?
-How do you make her father become just a business partner?
-Then they changed how Langdon was informed of the situation.
-Next they changed the name of the great elector from Mortati.
-How do you change the Hassassin's motives and thoughts to just a man hired for money.
-They made Cardinal Braggia live, when no prefertiti survived.
-The omitted Gunther Click and his entire role in reporting the events to the world, captivating everyone including the poetic speech given inside the Sistine Chapel by the Carlomengo.
-The incorprated some father in the story to die with Rocher, when in the book it was Kohler and Rocher killed in the Pope's office.
-They changed the brand from the illuminati diamond, which is one of the biggest myths in the story to the sign of the Palpacy.
-They changed the Carmalengo's name to Patrick they called him Carlo in the book (that might have just been a reference to Carlomengo).
-They omitted the entire struggle between the Hassassin and Langdon at the Illuminati Church.
-The removed the fact that Langdon was with Carlo in the Helicopter and that he actually was left for dead by Carlo with the antimatter.
-They omitted the story about how the Pope was Carlo's actual father and how that drove Carlo over the edge which caused him to set himself on fire inside the Vatican rather than outside infront of the world.
-They entirely deleted the undercurrents of attraction between Vittoria and Langdon.
-Then as a last kick in the a** they change the entire ending including the gift given by the new Pope.

Now some of these changes I can understand and agree with but certain things have to be included and shouldn't of been f***ed with. As anvid movie watcher and owning close to the neighborhood of 1,000 movies, I am totally shocked that Ron Howard would put this together. Did he really bother reading the book at all, cause if he did he would of incorporated more of the book. I mean look at Harry Potter, they split the last novel into two movies to tell it in vivid detail. Why couldn't they of done this to a superb book so the movie would of been more accurate. Some questions will never be answered, but they should of been more true to the book. My last suggestion is that if you loved the movie don't read the book, or you will not like the movie and its shortcommings campared the to discription used in the book.",1264032000,4,3179,4.613074204946996

From that standpoint, I found this movie fairly entertaining.  The acting, scenery, and special effects are solid, as one would expect with a big-budget high-profile movie like this.  The plot, though implausible in many ways, still manages to passably hang together, and it's plenty suspenseful with some good twists and turns, so I had no problem staying engaged for the full duration of this fairly long movie.  And the ending was also pretty good, surprising me in some ways without feeling artificially tacked on or rushed.

As far as broader messages we might apply to real life, I see two of them.  First, as the movie emphasizes, it's silly to assume that science and religion must be in conflict; that's the case only if one or both of them dogmatically overstep their bounds (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Science-and-Religion-From-Conflict-to-Conversation/dp/0809136066/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Science and Religion: From Conflict to Conversation</a>&nbsp;by John Haught for a good book on this).  Second, in a world which is now dangerously replete with nuclear weapons and other WMDs, we really need to think carefully about where our science and technology may lead before we continue developing them; it's immature and irresponsible to pursue them simply because we wish to satisfy our curiosity, revel in our ingenuity, or perpetually raise our standard of living (enough is enough at some point).

Overall, this certainly isn't one of those really great movies which changes you for a long time (or permanently), but it's still decent entertainment, so I can recommend it to people looking for a combination of detective work, action, and suspense, all with a background of religious symbolism.",1262995200,3,1993,5.423948220064725

The book went into fine detail as to the development of anti-matter at the CERN Institute as well as exquisite detail as to how the Vatican works when a Pope dies.  That is all absent here, instead the audience is force fed this info in a couple of minutes.

The movie does have a lot of tense moments as Langdon races to save each of the Cardinals before they are killed.  Langdon must solve riddles (a la Da Vinci Code and National Treasure) to find where they are but where that translated well in the other movies it falls flat here.

I did give the movie three stars because of the grand scenes we see at the Vatican and inside.  There are some tense moments too and while most of the acting is good, the character of Vittoria is nowhere as good as the female character that assisted Langdon in the prior movie.

I recommend reading the book before you see this film so you would have too much shoved down your brain at once.",1262995200,2,1909,4.401709401709402

With Tom Hanks returning as Professor Langdon, the movie also features the beautiful Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer in probably her biggest role so far.  This time around, our scientist hero, Dr. Langon, is running around Rome trying to find four kidnapped cardinals and a bomb before midnight.  Not quite like the TV show ""24"", but close in its fast paced action interspersed with good dialogue.  The key of the movie is the hidden motives of multiple characters, and how they are not revealed until the very end of the movie.  The film's location is great, and authentic as this reviewer has visited many of the locations in Rome that featured in the movie.  The language is also good, as the locals talk in Italian, and when speaking English, do so with Italian accents.  All in all, one of the better movies of 2009.  It would surely have done better at the box office if not for the proximate releases of other blockbusters such as X-Men Origins two weeks before, Star Trek a week before, and Up 2 weeks after the May 15th opening date of Angels and Demons.",1262822400,,1210,4.543778801843318

3845136,3,B00243HD2Y,"Here we have the sequel to the rather mediocre film The da Vinci Code. The source material for that film was pretty weak. Angels and Demons, thankfully, has stronger source material and is, also thankfully, a far better film.

The movie tells the story of a group of terrorists who get their hands on some anti-matter and hide it somewhere in the Vatican, promising to blow the place sky-high. They haven't any demands or anything like that. They just plan to blow it up as revenge for an act the Vatican did back in the late 1600's. The Vatican, in the midst of trying to elect a new Pope, calls in symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), to find the bomb and save the day.

And that's pretty much it for the plot. What follows is a series of chases through Rome, searches through archives and a lot of eye-rolling on the part of the audience. Well, at least on the part of anyone who knows anything about the Illuminati (which contrary to the story, was not founded 400 years ago and which Galileo very likely did not belong to, given that it was founded over a century after his death). Also near as I'm aware the LHC does not generate anti-matter. That's not what it's built to do, and we already have other ways to make the stuff.

But despite the large amount of eye-rolling and suspension of disbelief that's required, the film largely works. Tom Hanks does his usual good job, and the supporting cast is acceptable, if nothing to write home about. The movie also changes several of the more preposterous things from the book (we don't get the reporter subplot, and the film makes it clear that, hey, news stations actually go to places and film stories rather than standing in front of green screens, though ironically, I bet while filming the movie that's what they did), and in doing so turns it into a better story. It's still not great (but how can it be?), but it is at least entertaining.

I don't know. There's not a lot to say about this movie, really. It was fun, it was interesting, it was entertaining and I'm sure two months down the line I'll be hard-pressed to really remember anything about it.",1262217600,2,2117,4.505208333333333

Just too much in an otherwising very tasty mystery story. The movie version if you've missed it dodges around that rather weird bit of story telling and gets the rest of it right.  Rome is an interesting and beautiful city, the Vatican is a really fastinating place and the the charaters are believible enough given the whole idea of suspending belief, hard to fault Tom Hanks work, ever - ok, Money Pit, Bachelor Party and Joe vs the Volcano but he manages to move through this with conviction and does Prof. Langdon justice again.  I also have to comment on Ron Howard.  I was never much of a fan of his television personnas but he always amazes me as a director - to the point that I'll see a movie of his that doesn't interest me because I know it'll be terriffic.  A&D is no different in that regard.

I've not looked at the extended edition disc, rarely do.  Knowing how it's done doesn't inhance the magic for me.  I assume they're clever I don't need a guided tour.  The DVD is fine otherwise.  Actually for me selling a basic edition for $5 cheaper wouldn't upset me at all.

It cuts inportant parts completely out to the film the head of Cern a very important character is not even mentioned, therefore requiring the Vatican to be the ones to contact Robert Langdon which is ironic at best.  I for one can not understand why Hollywood thinks itself a better story teller than the writter they took the title from and but placed the guts of a Ford in the body of a Ferrari and want us to believe it will still do 0-60 in less than 5 seconds as it sputter for air just after the engine is turned over.

I watched this movie last night and it kept me suspensefully riveted to the movie. Tom Hanks does an exceptional job as Professor Robert Langdon and Ron Howard creates a suspenseful thriller amidst a background of a Rome and Vatican City which captures the history and romanticism of its locations, even those that were recreated in the studio.

The twists and the turns of this move truly caught me by surprise and I did not see them coming. The reason why I give it only 4 stars was that a few of the scenes seemed to either stretch credibility and logic and a couple events, such as Langdon almost suffocating in the Vatican archives, leads nowhere.

Take the best elements of an action film,mix it up with the best moments of National Treasure or the 1990's Mummy series with Brendan Fraser along with some horror elements & POOF! you get a great movie.
Tom Hanks was brilliant in this, in fact the entire cast was tremendous. Hanks character as Robert Langdon as a character that we as viewers can root for. For me it was a rare thing in today's movie to actually like the character and root for him to stop the evil doings.
The story has Langdon tracking down an evil society known as the Illuminati who are murdering 4 Cardinals for the sake of religion, sin and God. It was a thrill ride as Langdon goes from one Church to another in pursuit, going through catacombs, crypts, following signs to track the group down.
It was very , VERY suspenseful, non stop & just a lot of fun to watch. The gore pieces were really well done. One scene with rats reminded me of a movie called Virgin of Nuremberg. It wasn't gory just have gore, it was more of style like Dario Argento used to do. It was also refreshing to have a man and woman work together and not have a romantic interest. It was also refreshing to see a more mature picture or a film where characters have that 'been there,done that' attitude with corny dialog. It wasn't tongue in cheek (thank God)

The film is both worse and better than the book.  Worse in the sense that anyone familiar with the book will find it completely different from Brown's work - plot lines have been changed and major characters eliminated or relegated to more minor roles.  Better, in the sense that several of the outrageous plot devices in the book have been eliminated.  But while the plot of the movie holds together better than the one in the book, I found the movie awfully frenetic, with too many chase scenes and not enough of the humor and interesting back story that's found in the book.

Major kudos to the designers of the sets and props, some of which are discussed on the second disk of the Extended Edition.

Movie Review

The movie diverges from the book quite a bit, enough I think to annoy ardent fans of the book. Though I enjoyed both the DVC and A&D, I also enjoyed both movie versions. I think in A&D, the essence of the story was preserved, and so I have no major grouses with the movie adaptation. The main theme explored in A&D is the perennial battle between religion and science. A canister containing anti-matter (and highly volatile at that) is stolen from a super collider facility where scientist Vittoria Vetra is working (played by Ayelet Zurer). Meanwhile, in Vatican City, the Pope dies, presumably from a stroke and the College of Cardinals gather in Conclave to elect the new Pope. Things become complicated when four of the Cardinals (who also happen to be prime choices for the Papacy) are kidnapped. Here is where our beloved symbologist comes in - Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks, looking a lot better than in DVC, and also with a better hairdo) is roped in by the Vatican to investigate some mysterious symbols that point to an ancient foe of the Vatican, the Illuminati. Soon enough, both Langdon and Vittoria find themselves trying to desperately unravel the clues so that they can help save the kidnapped cardinals. They find obstacles in the form of a taciturn head of the Swiss guard , Commander Richter (played by Stellan Skarsgard), and things are also made difficult by Vatican politics, embodied in the tension between the deceased Pope's Camerlengo (Ewan McGregor) and Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl).

The acting was well-done by all accounts in this movie - due to the fast pace, there really is no in-depth character development. Hanks plays a credible slueth/symbologist and though his miraculous 'saves' defy credibility at times, he puts on a credible performance for the most part. Ms. Zurer is also suitably intelligent in her role as the scientist, and Skarsgard puts on a good performance as the enigmatic commander of the Swiss Guard. Both McGregor and Mueller-Stahl are wonderful as always, and I thought McGregor's role was the most well fleshed out in this movie.

So, in the final analysis - this is an enjoyable thriller with plenty of twists and will please fans of the genre. It is not altogether faithful to the book, but it does retain its essence. The cinematography is exquisite - the glorious wonders of Rome's architecture is a delight to watch on-screen, and the score suits the religious themes in the movie quite well.

Watch and enjoy the movie for its own merits. Simply put, the movie is good entertainment.

If you insist on comparing the movie to the book, perhaps the book should be rated poorly because it's not in full color, 1080p with surround sound like the movie is. Sound silly? I agree...just as silly as rating a movie poorly because it's not the book.

3845186,4,B00243HD2Y,"This film is very good in some respects, and very poor in others. Firstly the bad: the music is much to intrusive (kind of like Orff's Carmina Burana on steroids). I wouldn't mind so much but it also intrudes over dialog, and there's not enough quiet time to take in the ambience or background noises of Rome or the Vatican. Secondly, some of the physics is nonsensical - antimatter is possibly a viable method of STORING energy, but energy cannot be created from nowhere, so the atomic collider that made it must have had one hell of a power supply! Thirdly, the leading lady (Zurer playing Vetra) seems to be both a medical doctor and an atomic physicist and a biologist (an unusual combination), and also seems to be knowledgeable about the history of science, and yet she is able to contribute very little, other than as a vehicle for listening to Langdon's ""miraculously"" correct explanations. The power cycling idea was an interesting plot twist, but why so long a black-out on each region? Finally, the pace of the film is often too frenetic - a ""by-the-numbers"" scheduling dictated by on-the-hour deaths, and the ability to predict precisely when a battery will run out (something that even battery designers would have a hard time doing!).

The good: I liked some of the photography, and the image quality of the Blue-ray disk is superb. I always enjoy watching Tom Hanks, and the film has enough puzzles and detail to support multiple viewings (I doubt anyone would spot all the clues - even after seeing it twice). The eclectic mix of particle physics, history, present-day Vatican protocols, and power politics makes for an interesting entertainment.",1260057600,5,1662,4.872791519434629

While I understand Dan Brown's stories are works of fiction, this just goes too far into the realm of unbelievability. It seems ass if one man was able to launch an entire conspiracy against the papal leadership, kill dozens of cops, and kidnap four cardinals with minimal help. Professor Robert Langdon, the protagonist, is able to draw connections between vague clues and never seems to get shot (even when the bad guy sees him, he refuses to shoot Langdon). Meanwhile, the whole bomb plot revolves around an antimatter device developed by Vatican scientists - technology far out of the reach of modern science, much less a few Vatican scientists. Even at the end, I couldn't figure out what was going on. There were so many loose ends that I was convinced the movie was made by a bunch of amateurs rather than a highly paid Hollywood scriptwriting team.

As with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Da-Vinci-Code/dp/B00005JOC9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Da Vinci Code</a>, the acting in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angels-Demons/dp/B002O5M4TE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angels & Demons</a>&nbsp;was pretty decent, particularly the supporting cast.

However, Tom Hanks as Professor Langdon was pretty forgettable as he was almost like a robot - always right, always the smartest guy in the room.

SPOILER: The end scene sums up the message of the film: that men flaw religion, and that there is hope for the church. Well, what is religion (especially the Catholic Church) BESIDES men? Perfect example in the film: scores of men die, but because ONE cardinal (who they have not qualified with any extraordinary qualities) lives ""God must have sent"" the MAN who solves the riddles and the city from demise. So, did God brutally kill those people who died also? No... a person did. Just like PEOPLE worked their tails off to prevent the explosion. Tom Hank's character was WAY too ""on the fence"" about faith in God, with no payoff in the end.

In the film the previous Pope was opening his mind to science, the implication at the end of this movie is that will continue with the new Pope. Well, that is great, but the REALITY of the current Catholic Church could not be more different. Just because the church says they support science does not mean anything if they continue to oppress people and ideas that contradict their teachings without any grounding in reality.

There are a few major holes in it, but whatever.  These things you just overlook, and enjoy the ride.

******spoiler alert

While I give the film a good review, I have to get a couple things off my chest that I thought were ridiculous.

1)  When Robert and the woman are cornered by the killer in an enclosed space, the killer who has previously killed at least a dozen people doesn't kill Robert.  The reason is that he ""wasn't told to"".  Was he told to shoot the two policemen five minutes earlier?  Or the seven policemen in the church earlier?  That was simply ridiculous that a killer would do this, and not even tie them up.  Plus, it would have benefitted Ewan McGregor's character if Robert and the woman were eliminated.  If anything he would have told the killer to get rid of them!

2)  When searching for the bomb, they were pretty sure to have narrowed it to one location.  Why didn't they turn off the lights in that location, like they were doing everywhere else?  This would have been much more efficient, instead of searching through an entire building.  Stupid.  And I never understood why would they put a camera on the bomb like that?",1259452800,,1463,4.482889733840304
3845198,2,B00243HD2Y,"Wow. so many problems exsit with this poor excuse for a film and entertainment. I read the book in two days and enjoyed it. A fast fun read and even  though I was a little disappointed in the ending in general, I was entertained.

The Movie is another matter. First of all this is not a film for Ron Howard; he is simply too inclined to gloss over important elements like screenplay and dialog. Four times we are asked to participate in a big chase scene triggered by some sudden symbology-based revelation from Tom Hank's character and then we race all over the narrow streets of Italy to find the cardinal of the moment dead or being killed.  Another example of ridiculousness is when 4 cardinals all start brainstorming about how to bend the rules to make the priest the new pope. Really silly and unbelievable.

Just how does the priest who suddenly learns of the God Particle, so quickly craft such an intricate plan incorporating the illuminati to the extent that he has to know their history and symbology so well to figure out where and how to kill each cardinal? One would think he would have to hope that someone would be smart enough to hire a symbology expert to help them figure everything out in time so that he can save everyone at midnight and force all to then conclude that he should be the new pope?  even if I assume that he has had relgious history beaten into to him daily since the day he was adopted- when did he have time to also learn how to fly a helicopter and remain current with his skills to allow him to fly the anti-matter away? Since he had so little time to come up with his big complicated plan, how did he have time to find and recruit one guy to do the mutilation and killing and also ensure that this accomplice gets car bombed in the end?

I'm willing to set aside a few errors in the interest of entertainment but this was way too much of a stretch.

Cinematographer Salvatore Totino offers us views of Rome and  Vatican City, both from the exterior and from the historically significant interiors, that are as stunning as any on film. The actors look well and seem as involved as the creaky script by David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman have pasted together from Dan Brown's first (in a probably endless line) novel allows about the derring-do of symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks reprising his role from The Da Vinci Code).  But while the story is interesting - illuminating the Illuminati's centuries old plight to force the Catholic church to accept scientific reasoning instead of condemning it - and while Ron Howard as director does his best to give us a fast-paced thriller, the dialogue dumbs down the audience by the simplistic, hurriedly discovered answers to the meaning of symbols that drive this story.  Dan Brown's novel gave the reader some breathing time to digest the ancient codes and incorporate them into the action: Ron Howard's film condenses the important findings in favor of emphasizing special effects and splendid footage of the inner chambers of St Peter's and the various churches that become destination points for the murders of the 'preferiti' cardinals gathered to elect a new pope after the surprise demise of the current pope.

The cast includes some fine, interesting faces and actors - Ewan McGregor as the recently dead Pope's camerlengo, Stellan Skarsgrd as the suspicious Commander Richter, a very beautiful but bland Ayelet Zurer as the sole female scientist Vittoria Vetra who understands the importance of rescuing the 'antimatter' that threatens the end of the church and a good part of the territory around Rome, Armin Mueller- Stahl as the crusty old Cardinal Strauss,  Pierfrancesco Favino as the Inspector Olivetti, and the always fascinating character actor Nikolaj Lie Kaas as the assassin - but Tom Hanks' Robert Langdon rattles off his obsession with ecclesiastic symbology with such speed  and nonchalance that the mysteries become almost insignificant to the audience who simply go along with the patter. It is a mad chase of a film, fortunately treating the audience to some wondrous scenery and lighting effects.  As a film it is entertaining, but then that was the purpose of the book, too.

3845206,4,B00243HD2Y,"Angels and Demons is the second of Dan Brown's books to hit the big screen. This time Professor Langdon is called to the Vatican to investigate the resurgence of the mysterious Illuminati; a Catholic faction that opposed the Church's persecution of scientists during the Scientific Revolution, and was crushed as a result.
Tom Hanks does a great job in his respective role (as he always does), however, the rest of the cast's performance (including Ewan McGregor's) is nothing to write home about, especially Ayelet Zurer who seemed very much out of place (and was rather annoying too). Nevertheless, the setting, the dialogues, the action, and the music are quite decent.
In short, though not a masterpiece, the film will provide for an evening's entertainment!",1259366400,,762,5.153225806451613
3845207,5,B00243HD2Y,"5 of 5 Stars rating for the movie version of Dan Brown's book Angels and Demons. This book is considered to be the #1 book in the Robert Langdon series as it was written before Da Vinci Code. However, with sales & marketing, most people assume Da Vinci Code is #1. A&D happens before the Da Vinci code. However, Ron Howard & team decided to make A&D happen after DVC in the timeline with several references to DVC. BTW, The Lost Symbol is considered #3 in the series happening after both DVC and A&D.

The story opens at CERN with a group of scientists trying to create anti-matter in large quantities. There are references to finding the ""god"" particle. We soon learn that one of the scientists is killed and his eye used to gain access to the secure room with the anti-matter. One large container (magnetic enclosure container) was stolen.

Flash forward to Robert Langdon's apartment where a Vatican police officer approaches Langdon to come to Rome to help with an investigation. Well, it is an active case with four kidnapped Cardinales who are to be killed one each hour leading up to midnight when a (anti-matter) bomb will destroy the Vatican. At this time, the current Pope has died (humm, maybe murdered?) and traditional efforts are happening to pick the new Pope. Oh, the four Cardinales are the four leading contenders for the role of new Pope. Why Langdon? Ah, the people claiming to cause this are the Illuminati of which Langdon has been working on a book about them.

Langdon performs some quick research in the Vatican Archives to learn where to start the search for the Cardinales. As with Da Vinci Code, Langdon's search is lead by symbols and history. As he chases each of the four victims, he is too late for most.'

The cool thing about this story is that it takes place within 12 hours of real-time. It is fast paced, exciting, good action with Langdon becoming more of an Indiana Jones with some of the action. The Langdon character is deeply and richly described and is likely to become iconic much like Jones.

As before with Da Vinci, Dan Brown's deep research and crafting of historical facts and locations to meet his needs for the story is impressive. It is interesting to note that all of the Vatican scenes were created in LA as they couldn't get permission to film. Scenes of other locations around Rome were shot on-site. The detail and richness of the sets and costumes is amazing! Tom Hanks as Langdon is wonderful and he is well on his way to being an icon. I can only hope that Howard/Hanks are working on the Lost Symbol.

I highly recommend Angels and Demons it is now on my favorites list. I specially recommend the Blu-Ray 3 disk set with an entire disk of behind-the-scenes materials.",1259366400,,2728,4.614432989690721

First off, am not a huge fan of books by Dan Brown.
Did not read The Da Vinci Code. The movie was good, but as much as I like Tom Hanks, in this role, not.

Read the first part of A&D, just watched the movie. The movie strayed from the story line of the first part of the book, and was not as good for this viewer as TDVC.
Am going to read all of the book and then view again to see if my opinion changes.

My wife reads all the works of Dan Brown and liked TDVC plus A&D movies. But, she is not impressed with Tom Hanks in these parts either.",1259280000,,671,4.275590551181103

There have already been two cardinals killed and if Tom doesn't figure out the next clue FAST, there will be two more dead.  How can Tom STOP IT??????

I have already got over the fact that Hanks should not be playing Langdon and that a lot was going to be cut but I never expected the movie to be this bad. I loved the book. I could not put the book down. Here are some of the things the movie is missing:

1. There is no Max Kohler in the movie. AT ALL
2. There is no Gunther Glick or his camera woman. Or any scenes that involve what they do

Here are some big differences:
1. In the movie the Olivetti contacts Langdon and flys him to Vatican City in a Vatican aircraft
2. In the movie Olivetti is not head of the Vatican Guards... He is a regular police officer
3. Vittoria had a huge team working on the antimater.
4. Vittoria found her father dead... They do not even really explain that it is her father.. and they do not show he is branded
5. They do not mention the illuminati diamond, nor do you see it.
6. They do not talk about the IVF or The chamerlengo's mother

3845215,5,B00243HD2Y,"I enjoyed this movie on many levels.  To me it was good art: great special effects -- especially the simulated matter-antimatter explosion, nicely scripted from the book, very well directed, well acted, intriguing, and exciting.  The depiction of the funeral of the late pope, Sede Vacante, and the Papal Conclave to elect a new pope were especially fascinating to me.  I remember some of the events immediately following the death of John Paul II and appreciate Ron Howard's handling of like events in Angels and Demons.

Tom Hanks seemed a lot more like Robert Langdon in this movie.  An agnostic as in the book, Hanks/Langdon made the spiritually insightful statement that ""faith is a gift,"" but honestly admitted that he had not yet received that gift.  With that said, he put the pedal to the metal in trying to unravel the clues in time before any more of the four cardinal papabile were murdered.  And he was not unnecessarily distracting to Vittoria.  He let her perform her critical tasks as well.  After all, she had been traumatized by the grisly death of her mentor and would not have been in the mood for playing around.

The scientific aspects of the movie were interesting.  It begins at CERN in Switzerland, where scientists are presently conducting experiments that may produce antimatter or microscopic black holes, all in an attempt to replicate conditions similar to the original singularity event -- the Big Bang.  The idea of producing a ""god particle"" is not irreverent, but it may actually promote a better understanding of the beginning of creation by a transcendent power.  A&D the movie, even as fiction, whetted my appetite for some of the wonders of cosmology.  Whatever faults related to deviations from the book do not penalize this movie even one half of a star, in my estimation.  Highly recommended!  Fr. Dennis",1259280000,,1845,4.922330097087379

Movie goers are often disappointed that the film does not follow the page, but I would hate to endure a movie that followed War and Peace to the last period.  Having said that, Angels and Demons addresses a centuries-old issue that continues to vex the faithful and the sceptics alike.  As Cardinal Strauss said, ""Religion is flawed because men are flawed.""  But then, so is science. Angels & Demons addresses the on-going conflict between ""faith"" and ""fact"" and comes to a satisfactory, though temporary, solution because even those of us who hope the two will meld are also flawed.

3845218,3,B00243HD2Y,"I finished reading the book ( for the second time) 2 days ago.
I just finished seeing the movie.
I did NOT expect the movie to be entirely faithful to the
book because I knew there was too much info. and detail
in the book.
That being send,for me,this book to movie transfer was butchered!!
Why? Outside of the search for the four cardinals and the anti-
matter bomb there is little else that relates to the book.
  The two MAJOR problems were the entire lack of motivation behind the
main characters actions and no character development. For example,in the book,the heroine,
Vittoria Vetra wants very much to be a part of the search for
the killer of her FATHER/scientific partner. In the movie she just
seems to tag along with Robert Langdon because she's just there.
In the movie the camerlengo kills and hires an assasin to kill because he feels his father the late pope is too liberal?
That's ridiculous. In the book his deep motivation is that he did
NOT know the pope was his father initially for many years.
He only knew that the man who became pope had looked after
him since he was a child. When the pope told him that he actually
was his biological son,the camerlengo was horrified to find
out that the pope had broken his vow of chastity. He had broken
his promise to God!!!This is what motivated the camerlengo in the book.
In the movie the assasin is just a cool unemotional hired killer. In the book he is a rabid nutcase who enjoys killing.
Because of the lack of strong motivation by the central characters
of the movie, it presents these people as having no depth and being more like cardboard cutouts.
Now for the ending. No I won't reveal it but,it reminded of
movies from the 50's where there is a miraculous event,and
everyone lives happily ever after.
I also feel that the makers of this movie were so wrapped up
in the set design and visual effects that they forgot about
character development. If you want to see a beautifully made
film about the slecting of a new pope, with great shots of Rome etc.,may I suggest The Shoes
of the Fisherman. In this movie they did not forgo character
development in favour of set design !!!
It struck me as strange that Robert Langdon virtually ignored
the stunning looking Ms. Vetra, yet in the the book he was strongly
attracted to her.
 Personaly,I was really looking forward to seeing who would be selected to portray Max Kohler,the director of Cern. I think that part would have been any actors dream and if he was any good he
could have ""chewed up the scenery.""
 Can anyone tell me the reason for changing the name of the cardinal who was chosen to be the great elector ( in charge of
conclave)from Mortati to Strauss or why the commander of the Swiss
guard was changed from Olivetti to Richter? Lastly why change the
design of the last branding iron? What's the point???
 Lastly, I think ,to get the movie anywhere close to being like the book would have required 2 full discs because the book is incredibly detailed.",1259020800,8,2984,4.518518518518518
3845219,3,B00243HD2Y,"THE DA VINCI CODE was easily one of the most lackluster action thrillers in recent ages.  To be fair, the movie didn't have much going for it: miscasting in the lead role (Hanks is great, don't get me wrong, but he's not fit for thrillers); a short time frame (to cash in on the book's popularity); and a rather mediocre source novel (let's face it, Dan Brown isn't a literary master; he's just good at pushing buttons).  The film had some good supporting performances, but overall it simply wasn't as good as a Ron Howard film should be.

ANGELS & DEMONS is an improvement from that.  The film is pretty much a nonstop race to stop the religious terrorist organization Illuminati from setting off an anti-matter bomb.  It picks up quickly and never rests.  It isn't quite as good as the book--the novel, while no great piece of literature, is a decent-enough thriller, and far better than its sequel--but let's blame that on the PG-13 rating; the novel was gory and dark, with a truly haunting premise and enough truth-bending ""facts"" to make for a thoughtful (if not accurate) thrill ride.  The film has toned it down a bit, honing the dark, rough edges to make it a little more palatable for movie-going audiences.  And sure, it still doesn't feel like a Ron Howard film (anybody could have made this); and sure, Tom Hanks is STILL miscast; but we have three great supporting roles--from Stellan Skarsgard, Ewen McGreggor, and Armin Mueller-Stahl--and enough action for us to forgive the fact that the movie doesn't go as far with its subject as it should.

Of course, thrillers like this--where the facts are bent, where the action and cliched dialogue is laid on so thick that close inspection of the details is all but impossible--have their audience, and ANGELS & DEMONS delivers to that audience in spades.  So, in those regards, this film is definitely worth seeing if you're a fan of the genre.  If, on the other hand, you're like me and just wanted to kill two hours with some mindless entertainment, you can see this one or not; you won't be missing much, but it is, if nothing else, entertaining.  Perhaps that's the best we can expect from mainstream Hollywood these days.  (Though we certainly expect more from Ron Howard.)",1259020800,5,2238,4.722365038560412

I was much more satisfied with this book adaptation than I was with the Davinci Code adaptation.  If you loved the book, I think you will thoroughly enjoy this movie.  I love how it tied into Davinci Code with the score.

3845221,4,B00243HD2Y,"Dan Brown's controversial novel ""The Da Vinci Code"" was a best seller and the film adaptation of the film was box office gold as the film grossed over $758 million worldwide.  Needless to say, controversy helped catapult this film and the novel and it was no surprise when it was announced that Ron Howard (""A Beautiful Mind"", ""Frost/Nixon"", ""Cinderella Man"", ""Apollo 13') would return as director and Tom Hanks (""Forrest Gump"", ""Castaway"", ""Big"", ""Sleepless in Seattle"", ""Saving Private Ryan"")  as the main character Robert Langdon in an adaptation of Dan Brown's 2000 mystery-thriller novel ""Angels & Demons"".

The film would feature a screenplay by David Koepp (""Hack"", ""War of the Worlds"", ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"", ""Ghost Town"") and Akiva Goldsman (""I Am Legend"", ""I Robot"", ""Cinderella Man"").  Music for the film is by Hans Zimmer (""Frost/Nixon"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Kung Fu Panda"", ""Pirates of the Carribean"" films) and cinematography by Salvatore Totino (""Cinderella Man"", ""Changing Lanes"", ""Frost/Nixon"").  The film The film opened in May 2009 and like ""That Da Vinci Code"", received a lot of controversy and did well in the box office as ""Angels & Demons"" made over $485 million.

Now ""Angels & Demons"" receives its entry to High Definition with a two-disc Blu-ray release which includes the theatrical and extended edition version of the film plus a third disc which contains a digital copy of the movie.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Angels & Demons"" is featured in 1080p High Definition (with an aspect ratio of 2:40:1).  The film looks absolutely stunning on Blu-ray.  Salvatore Totino and Ron Howard make a great filmmaking couple as the Director has trusted Totino to capture the setting in Rome and its people with clarity, amazing detail of the various architecture and the surrounds outside the Vatican.  And of course, the skin pores and detail on the characters face.  It's all captured quite well and to add to that, a nice fine layer of grain.  Overall, picture quality is fantastic.

And as for audio quality, the film is presented in English and French 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  Unlike ""The Da Vinci Code"", ""Angels & Demons"" is a film that features a lot of action scenes (which either is going to make you feel its going a bit too farfetched or will make you feel that it's wonderful).  From the gunshots from the assassin, the helicopter overhead, the cars racing and of course the anti-matter scenes, there is a good use of audio because of those action sequences.  But what about the ambiance of a crowded area of the Vatican.  Yes, you can hear the crowds with clarity and you can hear the people in the Vatican chit chatting, it's a wonderful use of the soundscape.  But the main thing that you will notice right off the bat is Hans Zimmer's music.  The music plays a big part of the ""Angels & Demons"" in creating that feel of action, sadness or the key dramatic moments.  Overall, this is another lossless soundtrack that really utilizes audio completely well.  It's not a full-on action-based film but it's a film that does sound remarkably well.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH and French.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Angels & Demons"" is one of those films that you either love or hate, as the same situation with ""The Da Vinci Code"".

I found the film to be quite entertaining and the cinematography and music to really enhance the film because the biggest problem that I found was the overuse of CG.  I know the goal was to show how religion and science can work together but I tend to have a disdain towards films that try to be real but overuse CG in ways that are a bit farfetched.

Also, there was a problem with character development.  In ""The Da Vinci Code"", there were characters that you actually cared about.  With ""Angels & Demons"", I could hardly care for the Dr. Vetra because she's hardly around Robert for most of the film.  That's what I enjoyed about the last film, the characters of Audrey Tautou's Agent Sophie Neveu and Dr. Robert Langdon developed well over the course of the film, while in ""Angels & Demons""...somehow the symbiologist ends up becoming an action-hero, escaping major predicaments, one after the other and it was one thing to see it happen but seeing him do it over and over again, was a bit too farfetched for my taste.  I wanted to see more of that intelligence and knowledge in symbiology and history to play a big part of the film.

But the saving grace for this film was my appreciation of ""Angels & Demons"" cinematography and music.  Similar to how Jacques Tati made the city come alive in a film like ""Playtime"", Rome was captured as is.  No matter how many people were loitering near the set, director Ron Howard wanted to capture the city and its beauty and they succeeded.

This is definitely a beautiful film and the Blu-ray release definitely brings out the film's detail and clarity.  I was quite impressed with the picture quality, although the CG was just a bit too out-of-place it seemed.  But the overall locations of where the film was shot and the creating of the sets to make the film come alive and make a set in Los Angeles look like Rome, a job well done by the production department.

And the lossless soundtrack is solid as well.  Special features wise, ""The Da Vinci Code"" was packed with bonus features but ""Angels & Demons"" had about seven major features and no commentary track by Ron Howard either.  But I did enjoy the use of ""The Path of the Illumination"" featuring the various areas around Rome.

Overall, ""Angels & Demons"" is an entertaining film, it's an ambitious and beautiful looking film that looks and sounds fantastic on Blu-ray.  But the film does have its shortcomings and some scenes are a bit farfetched, but yet in the end, I found the overall content and presentation of ""Angels & Demons"" on Blu-ray to be quite fascinating and entertaining and feel it is definitely worth checking out.",1259020800,5,8744,4.75480450629556

Dan Brown is flying high these days. His novels are hot property in Hollywood, even before they are written. But, the fact is that the man can indeed produce great suspense literature - if it qualifies for that --, the one that can translate well into films, such as his incredibly popular ""The Da Vinci Code."" ""Angels and Demons,"" I am happy to say, follows that tradition. It delivers great, smart entertainment, the one that you go to the movies for.

The film starts at the Vatican, just when it is announced that the Pope has just died. Simultaneously, we are transported to a laboratory known as the Large Hadron Collider, in Geneva, Switzerland, where scientists are about to successfully launch an important experiment which will generate antimatter. Unfortunately, once the antimatter is produced, one of the scientists handling this valuable product is assassinated and the antimatter is stolen. Enter Harvard's Prof. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), a renowned authority of symbols.  He is informed by a Vatican cop that four priests - the apparent finalists to replace the Pope -- were kidnapped and that the Vatican's police was requesting his help, because the kidnapper(s) left a symbol of the Illuminati at the scenes of the crimes. Once in the Vatican, Langdom teams up with Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer), an Italian physicist who was working with the antimatter experiments at the time it was stolen. They will try to put the puzzle that ties the antimatter and the Illuminati together. By doing so, they will realize, the hard way, that this is a dangerous game, in which science collides with religion and the Vatican's internal politics..

Some fans of Dan Brown's novels have criticized the adaptations of his work to the big screen -- ""Angels and Demons"" not being the exception --, and they may have a point. That's the danger of reading a book and expecting too much from Hollywood. However, having not read the book, I found this film to be highly provocative and intriguing, and I truly enjoyed it. In fact, I can't wait to see the installment of Brown's next book, ""The Lost Symbol."" I just hope that Hanks returns as Langdon and Ron Howard as its director. The formidable cast includes Ewan McGregor, Stellan Skarsgard, and Armin Mueller-Stahl. The DVD is loaded with extras, such as the mini documentaries ""Rome was not built in a day,"" ""Writing Angles and Demons,"" ""Characters in search of the True Story,"" and more. (USA, 2009, color, 138 min plus additional material).

3845223,3,B00243HD2Y,"The original novel, which began as a silly but fun pot-boiler, concluded with the absolute worst ending I may have ever read - just stunningly bad, one of the ""WTF???????"" endings, which, thankfully, has been changed for the movie to something a bit easier to believe.

I can understand people being disappointed in some huge changes from the book, but they're all for the better. The entire super-duper light speed jet was a howler, and Langdon surviving a fall from a helicopter...well the less said, the better. Brown isn't the most elegant of writers, a few years back on a 24 layover in Dubai I tried to read DaVinci Code and gave up, the hilarious use of exclamation points didn't help, and AGAIN in his newest Langdon adventure , he uses the same plot device he's used in every novel - a mysterious ( at times disfigured in some manner) assassin drives the plot, taking out everyone who can provide information and putting our hero in danger - come on Brown, this is what...the 4th, 5th time you've done this?

But yes overall the book was fun, if stupefying with it's ludicrous climax, and the Angels and Demons movie makes huge improvements that streamlined and clarified the plot to a great deal.

The movie moves along well, helped by Hans Zimmer's surging score, crisp photography and impressive locations and sets. While I enjoyed the film version of DaVinci over the book, this improves on both. Although the script is overstuffed with exposition it speeds along at a good clip, entertaining while trying to be be the ""thinking person"" 's thriller, a Die Hard for academia .",1258934400,,1588,4.746376811594203
3845224,1,B00243HD2Y,Maybe they should have read the book before they made the movie! The book is great but the movie doesn't hold true to the book at all and was very disappointing.,1258848000,5,161,4.225806451612903
3845225,5,B00243HD2Y,"I actually liked how this package ended up taking more time to read than watch (and I did watch both versions). Regardless of your take on the book to film translation or beliefs, the film came across on Blu wonderfully.

The Blu clarity is finite throughout with the only shortcomings being the CGI and green screen lines. The DTS was superb, though the score drowns out some material a few times, but certain sequences were reference (the interior water sounds at unrated 48:10 and several dialogue echoes in chambers throughout). The case is a much stronger hinge than the other Blus I have rated this quarter (wish they were all made this way) and I actually had to work at breaking it.

BD DISC 1: (Films only)
Both versions of the film are playable with CineChat or MovieIQ. There was no one online yet for Cinechat so I was pretty lonely on that one. MovieIQ only takes a minute to load up on my PS3 and provides the usual plethora of IMDBish material and trivia regarding plot, actors, score, etc. The unrated plays eight minutes longer and the edits are scattered equally (1.5 minutes  added in by the 24-minute mark, 5 minutes by the burning scene). The main rating change would have been in the burning sequence as they edited out all of the kills in the rated (the gore is graphic so would have garnered an R here).

BD DISC 2: (Supplements only)

Rome Not built in a Day: 17:30 minute making of. Shows the amount of CGI involved and the usual logistical stuff and interviews.
Writing: 10:09 minute Ron Howard interview narration on the script and such.
Characters: 17:10 minutes of interviews and the actors giving their takes on what they were trying to do here.
CERN: 14:50 minute documentary about the science center shown in the film. I liked this the most but I am a dork that way, will probably be the dryest supplement for most people.
Props: 11:35 minute take on the obvious need to make the stuff look good.
Full Story: 9:46 minute further making of with Ron Howard. Covers some wardrobe stuff and could have been included with the first one.
Ambigram: 4:46 minute history of the word history by John Langdon. Interesting little tidbits here adn there - especially the part (they show from the film) where his book is next to the one Hanks picks off a shelf.

Path of Illumination.
Five sections of learning material divided into two parts each, one part has Ron Howard describing the section (Plaza, Pantheon, etc.) and the other part has tons of textual info regarding the location selected. If you read everything offered it can eat up an hour or so. I think the experience is worthwhile and it contained some solid material.

DISC 3: Digital Copy and Zimmer Music software.

* The Music part (copy/pasted from text info):
"" This trial version provides the full functionality of the Sequel 2 retail version. While it contains only a selection of the retail version's content, three Hans Zimmer projects with audio material from the movie Angels & Demons have been added. Feel free to modify the projects with the sounds and tools Sequel 2 Trial Angels & Demons Edition has to offer. Pictures taken from the movie have been added to the list of track icons, which are used to label individual tracks.""

The installation process takes a bit as it puts in several programs - but I must not be musically inclined because the program looks overwhelming. LOTS to go through with music creation, recording, and so on - wow.

* There are weblinks and Sony website sign-up info for getting Sony stuff.

Overall, a large volume of material added to another history/drama/Hanks/Howard production that entertains the masses. Enjoy.

EDIT: A good point was brought up after I posted this review about the artwork pictured here - this set is the 3 disc BD set described (but the artwork is the same as you would get on the 2 disc DVD set).",1258675200,5,3850,4.662241887905605
3845226,5,B00243HD2Y,"When a murder of a physicist, Leonardo Vetra, finds a symbolist, Robert Langdon, and Mr. Vetra's daughter, Vittoria, on an adventure for a secret brotherhood, The Illuminati. Clues lead them all around the Vatican, including the four alters of science, Earth, Air, Fire and Water. An Assassin, working for the Illuminati, has captured four cardinals, and murders each, painfully. Robert and Vittoria also are searching for a new very destructive weapon that could kill millions. Ron Howard and Tom Hanks have really topped The Da Vinci Code in every way possible. The heart- racing hunt through Rome to find ancient clues will blow your mind.",1258588800,2,642,5.123809523809523
3845227,4,B00243HD2Y,"""Angels & Demons"" is the sequel to ""The Da Vinci Code"" and stars Tom Hanks reprising his role as symbologist Robert Langdon.  As the film opens, the Pope has died.  Before the Conclave of Cardinals can assemble to select a new Pope, the preferitti, the four leading contenders for the position, are kidnapped.  A threat of their assassination as well as the total destruction of the Vatican City is made, and a mysterious symbol is found.  Langdon is summoned to the Vatican and determines that the kidnapping is the work of the Illuminati, a centuries-old deadly secret society.
 ""Angels & Demons"" is filled with red herrings, some obvious, others that come as a surprise.  Director Ron Howard keeps us guessing as a literal bomb ticks away and the lives of four cardinals hang in the balance.  There are several strong supporting performances. Ewan McGregor plays Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, the man in charge of the Vatican during the transitional period between the death of one Pope and the election of the next.  Stellen Skarsgard plays the head of the Swiss Guard, the Pope's personal security staff.  Armin Mueller-Stahl portrays the elector in the Conclave of Cardinals.
 Author Dan Brown's formula -- creating maze-like mysteries in the milieu of the Catholic Church -- allows him to combine murder with clouded motives and Church history to elevate what would otherwise be fairly ordinary whodunits.  ""Angels & Demons"" is a stylish film directed with care by Mr. Howard, who understands the importance of good casting in making a movie click.
 ""Angels & Demons"" is available in three editions: single-disc DVD, two-disc DVD, and two-disc Blu-ray.  The two-disc DVD edition's bonus extras include the featurette ""Handling Props,"" in which the filmmakers discuss bringing the props from Dan Brown's book to life; and ""Angels & Demons: The Full Story,"" a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the film.  The Blu-ray edition contains these extras as well as both the theatrical and extended film versions; ""The Path of Illumination,"" which follows Robert Langdon's path through Rome; ""Movie IQ,"" containing loads of production facts, cast and crew details, and music and soundtrack info; and a digital copy of the movie.",1258416000,3,2229,5.121546961325967

3845230,1,B00243HD2Y,"I am an avid reader, and have thus seen many movies that were based on novels.  I understand quite well that the story must be changed in order to make the movie work within its time limit.  For the first time in my life, however, I was ready to cry when I left the movie theater.  I would like to believe that it is probably a perfectly lovely movie if you have not read the book.  Unfortunately for me, I felt betrayed that afternoon.  It seems that the screenwriters missed the entire point of the book or perhaps failed to read it at all.

The short of the matter is this - don't buy this book for someone just because you know they read and enjoyed the book.  Buy it only for people who have no interest in the book at all.",1257897600,7,728,4.084507042253521
3845231,3,B00243HD2Y,"This was marketed as a sequel even though the book itself is actually a prequel to Davinci Code. No matter, in either instance, that isn't really important; just a side note. Another side note: I despised Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon in The Davinci Code, and my feelings have not changed regarding Angels and Demons. He is terrible for the role. But at least they fixed his hair this time around...

As for the film itself, well, it is engaging and fast-paced. It almost never lags and gets to the point quickly without little confusion. It does help if you've read the book but it really isn't necessary. The film keeps viewers guessing and hopefully the twist entertains and surprises, as it does in the book. The visuals are quite lovely to look at and the backstory behind what goes on inside the Vatican when a Pope is being replaced is quite interesting. This movie succeeds as a mystery thriller. It has its flaws of course, but it really is a fun movie experience overall.

Ewan McGregor is quite good in this, as usual and you can thankfully ignore Hanks when they are onscreen together.

Overall, I was skeptical after The Davinci Code, but was glad I watched this afterwards. It easily surpasses that film in pace, acting, suspense and plot. Skip that one and see Angels and Demons instead. I'd give it a solid 3.5 stars.",1257465600,2,1331,4.6075949367088604

If I never read the book I might have liked the movie, but from the stand point of someone who thinks that a movie should follow the book as close as possible, this movie was a huge disappointment.",1257379200,16,402,4.10126582278481

8350304,4,B00243HD2Y,"The Da Vinci Code was one of the most anticipated movies of the 2000s, and upon its hyped release, was met with lukewarm reviews. For a filmmaker who constantly pushes his heroes to the breaking point, Howard does not go easy on Hanks in the sequel, and in turn creates one of the most satisfying follow-ups to a disappointment. Whereas The Da Vinci Code was a murder mystery, Angels & Demons is a ticking-time-bomb thriller with more energy and an eerie level of macabre.

Tom Hanks/Robert Langdon is just the smart man in the prequel, yet in Angels & Demons the Catholic Church gets to challenge him back. Additionally, the casting of Ayelet Zureh tags a subliminal romantic tension for Langdon  which is often a narrative vantage point which Howard uses in flushing out his characters. Digging into Langdons character lends more for the audiences to invest in; similar to A Beautiful Mind and Frost/Nixon, the more desperate the situation becomes, the more we see the characters develop.

Furthermore, the Robert Langdon films owe a debt of gratitude to the masterful score of Hans Zimmer. The music and songs of Howards films are essential to the tone, particularly the spirited themes in the finales (few of Howards films ever quietly fade to black). Zimmers requiem Gregorian chants for The Da Vinci Code are ideal, yet in Angels & Demons he outdoes himself, setting the film on a higher plateau from standard popcorn flick.",1527465600,,1430,4.8765432098765435

In the category: mystery, this is actually not bad -- it did keep me guessing up to the end.
In the category: investigation, it's too busy -- and I could not help noticing certain similarities between this film and /Inferno/, as if the author knew only one way to tell a story, and used it over (and over?) again with variations on the details.
