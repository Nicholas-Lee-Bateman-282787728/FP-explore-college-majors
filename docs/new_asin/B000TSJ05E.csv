8210763,2,B000TSJ05E,Just found too many of the storylines unsuitable for children. Maybe it was not meant for children at all in the first place (need to check the rating),1403049600,,151,4.428571428571429
8210764,4,B000TSJ05E,"It's been decades since we watched Shirley Temple, and watching these oldies took us back to our childhood days when we were mezmerized by the new technology of television.  Movies were simplier back then.",1389916800,,205,5.029411764705882
8210765,1,B000TSJ05E,"I bought this mainly for the feature film ""The Little Princess"" but thought the shorts from the earliest days of Shirley Temple's career would be entertaining for the 5 year old for whom it was purchased. I'm so glad I watched it with her as I was able to continually skip scenes. I'm not real big on political correctness but the shorts were completely offensive and inappropriate. I know that comparing the societal and cultural norms of the 30's vs. today is like comparing apples and oranges. But these films were nothing but child exploitation bordering on sexist kiddie porn with doses of racism thrown in here and there. I gave 1 star only because of ""The Little Princess"" which is as wonderful as I remembered. I tossed disc one. Pure garbage!",1326499200,,751,4.696969696969697
8210766,3,B000TSJ05E,"About PASSPORT box sets--
This company has a penchant for frequently flashing an ID watermark on the lower right-hand corner of the screen. Also, their public domain material is clearly unrestored and often has oppressive audio filtering. Claims like ""Fully Restored"" can't be proved by my past purchases from them.

About the films--
The three from 1932 are ""Baby Burlesk"" one-reelers in which Shirley is part of an ensemble. She's also a supporting player in ""What To Do?"" and ""Dora's Dunking Doughnuts""-- shorts that have few laughs. Shirley either stars or co-stars in the balance.

All shorts are directed by Charles Lamont. He also wrote many of them. Lamont later directed Abbott & Costello and Ma & Pa Kettle movies.

""The Little Princess"" is the only Shirley Temple feature to fall into the public domain. As such, it's a title widely available since the earliest VCR days. Few transfers have ever been of decent quality, unfortunately.

In the cast of this fine picture are Richard Greene, Anita Louise, Ian Hunter, Cesar Romero and Arthur Treacher.",1241222400,8,1059,5.034285714285715
