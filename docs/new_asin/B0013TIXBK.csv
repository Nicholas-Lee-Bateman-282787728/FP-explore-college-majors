8252764,5,B0013TIXBK,"This DVD is the best on Frozen Shoulder syndrome, I've seen. The late Elaine Calenda who taught at BCMT for many years shares her knowledge and visionary moves working with this condition. I have used many of the techniques in my practice and can attest to their effectiveness for freeing chronic holding patterns in the shoulder. Elaine's legendary sense of humor comes forth in this DVD but more importantly she truly presents helpful techniques that can lead you to Mastery. I am not sure if this video is still being produced but note the limited supply available. Grabbing this now insures a truly valuable learning asset to any massage therapist who works with clinical issues. The best I've seen and the only one I recommend.",1424304000,,732,4.864
