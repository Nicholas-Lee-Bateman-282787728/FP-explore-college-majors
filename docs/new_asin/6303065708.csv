7836431,5,6303065708,"The video provides just the right amount of instruction and a great workout.  I purchased the tape to go with a slide that I got at a tag sale.  Unfortunately, the slide was more used than I thought.  The tape is great, but I won't be using it for a while now that the bumpers are falling off of the slide.  Oh, well.",1257465600,,317,3.984126984126984
7836432,1,6303065708,"I did not receive the video I ordered.  The video I received was with Nancy Carrigan - this is the introductory video that came with the purchase of the Reebok slide board.  I wanted the video shown, the video I had ordered.  I am highly disappointed and will never use this site again.",1242086400,,286,4.3584905660377355
7836433,4,6303065708,"I have dusted this video and slide off after about 4 years of having it.  I am loving it.  Great for beginners, though I wish Reebok had produced a more advanced routine as well.  This video is great for fat burning and also for great legs (your legs use the same action as skaters do - and they have great legs!)",1034553600,3,313,4.098360655737705
