I was hoping that the soundtrack would be more energizing and uplifting such as it is in the second half of the preview.  But in reality that piece of music is pretty much only as long as it is on the preview and the other 89 minutes of the video is all filled with the somber music from the beginning of the preview.  That was extremely disappointing.  Especially when you have to sit through 70 minutes of the video to get to that point.

It's okay, but just okay. For a little more tweaking of the soundtrack this could have been awesome.",1374192000,,632,4.460869565217391
8401008,2,B003NFHTM6,I enjoyed the content and music but the video is quite jumpy when any motion is depicted. Haven't seen anything like this since the very early days of DVD so I'm not sure if I got a bad copy or if it's something in the production of the video or manufacturing. I guess I will return to the Earthscapes series.,1319760000,,309,4.166666666666667
8401009,3,B003NFHTM6,"Very good compositions and videos, but I was expecting more from Blue-ray...
In some scenes I see jumpy image during panning ""flying""...
In couple other scenes I saw very noticeable steps in color gradient.",1296604800,,206,5.088235294117647
8401010,4,B003NFHTM6,"Very nice filming of extreme beauty places on Earth  !
Good companion for a more colorful living room !
In my opinion its a best deal around $5 to $7 value if it is on this price buy instantly.
I gave it a 4 star rating because I do not like the mix of cars etc with beautiful natural scenery.
Music is ok but a bit repetive.",1294185600,5,325,3.8507462686567164
8401011,5,B003NFHTM6,"This is an incredible thought provoking film.
It's like a non-verbal travel log that takes you around the world, viewing our world from new perspectives. Each part is followed by a musical track giving you a gift every few minutes. Beautiful and humbling...",1290902400,5,257,5.0
8401012,5,B003NFHTM6,"AMOS' form of world fusion music video is bringing inspiration to us all. Visually, ""Rise"" is a transport to a wide variety of scenic marvels and wildlife encounters, along with essences of humanity. The soundtrack starts with a classical focus and then expands to include diverse cultural influences from all over the globe. Their content is an exhilarating reminder of the beauty that does exist in this life and the spiritual presence flowing throughout. I'm excited to see more of this kind of material. Thankyou AMOS!",1286064000,8,522,5.0813953488372094
