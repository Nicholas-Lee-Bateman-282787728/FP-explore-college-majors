8299071,2,B001EO61UE,Does anyone remember Darnell Robinson from season 3. He had rihanna as his date. Does he appear in the dvd anywhere? I am curious as to what is on the dvd.,1359331200,,155,4.032258064516129
8299072,2,B001EO61UE,You get most of the same episodes on seasons one and two (sneak peeks of season three)  Save your money.,1303171200,,104,4.2
8299073,3,B001EO61UE,"I just wanted to put something here so anyone considering purchasing this item is aware that this is NOT the actual Season 3 DVD of My Super Sweet Sixteen. This is just a BEST OF compilation of Season 3. Not only that, but it's just the second disc of a two disc set, so it only contains 4 episodes. (Amazon does sell Disc 1 as well, but separately.)

This raises the question...how do I get my hands on the complete Season 3 of this show because I am not finding it here?",1278979200,5,472,4.130434782608695
8299074,3,B001EO61UE,"No problems with Amazon or delivery. However, I already purchased Seasons 1 and 2, and there was a lot of repeats.",1272153600,,114,4.476190476190476
