1958304,5,B0000X2ECE,"Like many shows that are on the air a long time, Friends declined in quality somewhere along the way.  Mind you, I always enjoyed it, but I think every fan will agree the early seasons were the best.  For some reason, I had in my mind that season six is when the quality went downhill.  Having just rewatched the season, I can say I found it very funny and enjoyable with no loss of quality at all.

This season picks up where the last one ended  Vegas.  Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) have just gotten married!  However, it was a huge drunk mistake.  When the gang arrives back in New York, that means that Ross has to get divorce number three, something that is a running joke for the rest of the season.

Also on the return to New York, Chandler (Matthew Perry) and Monica (Courtney Cox Arquette) decide to move in together.  And so some of the most stable roommates on the show so far get switched up.  Rachel winds up moving in with Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) while Joey (Matt LeBlanc) searches for a new one.  For a little while, its hot dancer Janine (recurring guest star Elle MacPherson).

As the season progresses, Chandler and Monica figure out living under the same roof.  Ross gets a new job teaching at a university and finds a forbidden romance with one of his students, Elizabeth (guest star Alexandra Holden).  Phoebe and Rachel have a tragedy at their apartment.  Joeys lack of a roommate forces him to take a job at Central Perk.  We meet one of Rachels sisters (guest star Reese Witherspoon).  Joey might finally land his big acting break, if he can get along with his cheesy co-star.  And the gang spends one hour imaging what might have been if their lives had taken on turn differently.

There may not be quite as many classic moments during the course of this season, but there are still plenty of great laughs.  I laughed through every episode, both the ones Ive seen several times before and the ones I didn't really remember.  The characters are still growing and that leads us to some great lines.  The writing hasn't faltered a bit and things are still crisp and sharp.

Want to know how much we still care for the characters?  Watch the last few minutes of the season finale.  I teared up both times I watched it just now, once without and once with the commentary.  Thats good stuff.

The actors are still at the top of their game as well.  No matter what the writers throw at them, they bring it to life with hilarity grounded in reality.  Yes, we still believe what we are seeing even as we laugh along the way.

And as a bit of trivia, this is not only a rare season without a Ross/Rachel cliffhanger, but without a cliffhanger of any kind.

About the only real misstep is one the feels like a giant ad for Pottery Barn.  The idea behind the episode is funny, and if theyd used a generic store I would have loved it.  But as it is, Im not the biggest fan of the episode.

This season consisted of 25 episodes, but two of them are two parters that aired the same night as events.  They are all preserved here on four discs in their native full frame and surround sound.  Frankly, surround doesnt do much most of the time on a sitcom filmed before a live audience, but it is nice to have.  In the way of extras, we get three audio commentaries, two of them on the two hour long episodes.  (And it explains why Ross wasn't in that final scene of the finale.)  Frankly, the commentary on the finale was fascinating as the three creators talk about things they almost did in the finale; trust me, it is a great thing that they went with that they did.  The last disc also has a featurette with interviews with four of the recurring guest stars and a very funny gag reel from the season.

The laughs really still are good in season six of Friends.  Its been too long since I did more than catch a random rerun, and Id forgotten just how fun the show can be.  Hopefully, I can make some time to dive into the next seasons laughs soon.",1434758400,,3977,4.3669849931787175

The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that I was hoping that the episodes would include the full length time as the DVDs do (FYI: the show on TV doesn't actually play the entire episode. They cut out a few minutes worth of dialogue and plot to shrink it for TV. The full length episodes are on the DVDs.). I find myself really missing those extra couple of minutes, but I'm a hardcore fan. If that doesn't bother you, go for it! You can't ever go wrong with Friends.",1420502400,,570,4.098214285714286

I made good on my promise, and after watching all 10 seasons, I become a fan.

You'll laugh out loud when Joey has to deal with a hernia and no health insurance (it's even funnier when he gets the insurance back), pretends to own a Porsche, wins money in a fake game from Chandler only to lose it in the same fake game against Ross, gets a dancer roommate who is quite hot, and much more.  Phoebe runs like a hybrid of Kermit the Frog and the Six-Million-Dollar Man (Rachael's words, not mine) and it's certainly a sight to see.  Living arrangements change and Conchata Ferrell makes a noteable appearance as a judge...and it's a view through a crystal ball as to what she will later be like on Two and a Half Men.  But perhaps the highlight of the season is Thanksgiving, where you get confessions, wierd Trifle/Sheperd's Pie, Jack and Judy Geller...all rolled into one...that's a holiday to remember.  And finally, see Joey's brief stints as a detective with a robotic sidekick (a sad preview of Iron Man) and as a server at Central Perk.  For whatever reason you like, you must go out and get this sixth season of Friends.",1378684800,,1417,4.689516129032258

1958413,4,B0000X2ECE,"The producers/writers of Friends wisely allowed the characters to age as the series progessed.  Not only did this introduce new story possibilities (as the Friends matured and wanted more permanent relationships, for example), but kept the characters aging with the core audience that was aging at the same time.  In this season, the primary season-long arc is the relationship between Chandler and Monica, culminating with Chandler's proposal in the season finale.  Naturally, a Chandler-Monica pairing breaks up the Chandler-Joey and Monica-Rachel pairings that dominated the first 5 seasons, adding a fresh look to the apartments and the interactions between the characters.

Obviously one storyline does not a season make: other major occurances in this season include Ross dating both Rachel's sister and a 19(?)-year-old former student, Rachel and Phoebe moving in together, and Joey starting on a new TV show and having a rare ""long-term"" relationship.  Prominent guest stars include Reese Witherspoon and Elle Macpherson as Rachel's sister and Joey's love interest respectively.  They both fit seamlessly into the show, and I especially liked Macpherson's caustic outsider (of Monica: ""She's awfully loud for such a small person!"") having to pretend to like Joey's friends.  Not as successful is Bruce Willis's appearance as Ross's girlfriend's father (and briefly Rachel's boyfriend).  Like Julia Roberts in Season 2, he brings a weirdly inappropriate intensity to the role (although it almost pays off in the final show of his arc, when he ends up weeping on Rachel's lap for hours).  Finally, the incomparable Tom Selleck makes his final 2 appearances as Richard, playing the part of spoiler in the season finale when he tries to win Monica back just as Chandler has worked up the nerve to ask Monica to marry him.

These middle seasons are the best seasons of Friends.  The early seasons were dominated by too many gimmicks (Ross's monkey, Phoebe's pregnancy, etc.), and the later seasons seem to run out of steam.  In Season 6, the writers and the performers are at the tops of their games, and this is one of the best seasons of Friends.",1203379200,,2151,5.184971098265896

1958426,4,B0000X2ECE,"The sixth season of ""Friends"" has a strong start and the first half of the season continues the creative climax that the writers were on since season four. The dialogue was taut, fast, and witty and the stories were compelling, funny, and continued the evolution of the maturation of our ""friends."" The beginning of season six saw the unfolding of Ross and Rachel's fifth season ending marriage, as well as the deepening of Monica and Chandler's relationship as they agree to move in together. The whole Ross/Rachel secret marriage storyline could've been too out there and too zany, but Aniston and Schwimmer kept it grounded. Schwimmer makes viewers empathize with Ross and gets them to understand why he is hiding the marriage from Rachel. Schwimmer is also hysterical and is at his neurotic, hapless best as Ross struggles with a third failed marriage. Aniston continues to develop as a comedianne and she shines here, especially when Rachel finds out that she's still married to Ross. Aniston is always hysterical when reacting to others, and she hits it out of the park when she first gets the call from Ross's lawyer about their marriage. Cox and Perry on the other hand seem to suffer this season. Cox's Monica is not charmingly obssessive anymore, but she now becomes shrill and controlling. However, Cox does the best with her material and she does manage to elevate her lines and despite the rigidness of Monica, I still find myself laughing because Cox makes it all so funny. Chandler's relationship to Monica is charming and was funny in season 5, but the character begins to tone down his once razor sharp humor once he becomes committed. For what it's worth though, Perry and Cox do have excellent chemistry together and are very believeable as this neuorotic, mix matched couple. On the secondary story line front, Joey tries to find a roommate to replace Chandler and stumbles upon hot dancer Jeanine. LeBlanc is always funny and this season is no exception. Kudrow's Phoebe is not given a lot to do this season but play support to the other character's, and this is where I believe Kudrow does some of her best work. While she does not get to explore Phoebe's emotional depth and complexity much this season as she does in seasons past, Kudrow is still able to have fun with Phoebe and she is given some of the best lines of the season. Phoebe is hysterical aiding Ross in his plan to hide his marriage, and Kudrow and Aniston are so funny together as rommates this year.

 Near the end of the season there is a slight drop in quality and the stories aren't nearly as funny or interesting, as they all seem to be filler for the season ending proposal. The last few episodes of Season six foreshadow the decline that will take place in season seven and they are not ""Friends"" at it's hillarious, good hearted best. ""Friends"" on a bad day however is still much better and funnier than most other sitcoms are on their best day. Nonetheless, the beginning and middle episodes of season six still show ""Friends"" on a creative and humorous high. Standout episodes from this season include ""TO After Vegas,"" ""TOW Ross Hugs Rachel,"" ""TOW Ross's Denial,"" ""TOW Joey's Porsche,"" ""TOW On the Last Night (Aniston,Cox, and Kudrow are all at the top of their game here) ""TOW Phoebe Runs,"" "" TOW Ross Got High"" (one of the best Thankgiving episodes and probably Jack and Judy Gellar's best appearance), "" TOW the Routine"" (great physical comedy from Cox and Schwimmer), ""TOW the Apothecary Table,"" and ""TOW the Proposal"" (if just for the last five minutes. ""Friends"" classic moment)",1150156800,2,3584,4.779032258064516
1958427,5,B0000X2ECE,"Wow, a lot of people do not like this season, but I really enjoyed it! This season had a lot of highlights for me. The Proposal at the end of the season was really great.

Well for Season Six, Ross and Rachel get a divorce after their drunken marriage. Ross dates a student, Monica and Chandler get engaged and Rachel moves in with Phoebe only to end up living with Joey.

Season Six should be there in your collection, it is the best since Season 4 and has episodes that will have you laughing for ages!

My Personal Top 5 Episodes Are:

The One With Ross's Teeth

The One Where Ross Got High (Hilarious!)

The One where Chandler Can't Cry

The One That Could Have Been (Best Here!)

The One with the Proposal

This season starts off back in Vegas after Ross and Rachel's drunken marraige, deciding that they should get an annulment.  Meanwhile Chandler and Monica each realize that they don't want to get married, but both think the other does want to get married.  They realize that and decide not to get married, but they keep getting signs to get married.  Eventually they decide to move in together.

Meanwhile Ross tells Rachel that he got the annulment, when really he hadn't, with the fear of having three failed marraiges.  He then realizes how stupid he's being, and goes to get the annulment. When Ross finds out that Rachel needs to testify to get the annulment, and Rachel thinks that it is taken care of, so Ross decides to let it go.  Until Rachel finds out after she moves in with Ross (having no place to go after Chandler moved in with Monica), when Ross' divorce lawyer calls.  Ross and Rachel decide to get the annulment, but Rachel writes obscene things on the forms, and their forced to file for divorce.

While this was all happening Rachel had moved in with Phoebe, but when a fire starts in it, complication arise.  Phoebe's candles are blamed, so Rachel moves in with Monica and Phoebe with Joey.  It is then found that Rachel's hair straightener started the fire, so they switch places.  Rachel enjoys living with Joey so much that she decides to stay.  Meanwhile Joey loses his health insurance, and with bad timings, gets Hernia.  Joey is forced to work more, and gets it back.  Unfortunately not long afterwards Joey's fridge breaks, and lacking the money to buy one, tries to con his friends into helping him buy one.

This when Ross starts to date one of his female students in secret, seeing as it's forbidden.  Meanwhile Joey gets a job on a show named Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E, but the show eventually fails.  This is when Ross meets Elizibeth's (the student he has been dating) dad, who ends up going to the family cabin with Rachel, when Ross and Elizibeth have the same plans.

This season ends with Chandler and Monica getting engaged, which earlier was thrown off course by ex boyfriend Richard Burke showing up.

From Ross and Rachel's drunken marriage, to Chandler moving in with Monica, to Joey's new TV show, to Rachel's sister seducing Ross, to Phoebe's running, and finally, to Chandler proposing to Monica, this season has so many great moments that are not only funny, but heartfelt as well.

1958432,5,B0000X2ECE,"I've already wrote like 4 reviews for Friends and I still can't stop writing because there are just too many good seasons.

This season shows the gang maturing. Entering a new world. Monica and Chandler realize marrying after only a one year is inapropriate and moving too fast, so they decide to just move in together. Rachel and Ross' friendship surviving their disastrous, drunken marriage, and Phoebe..Well...Phoebe just being plain Phoebe, but still managing to move along with time. The world of fantasies and dating games become reality around them as they sit in Central Perk sipping coffee.

The thing I liked the most about this season is how different the gang has become. Rachel has become independent, tackling problems that she wouldn't have able to do in the earlier seasons. Ross has had 3 divorces and is FINALLY taking time on a relationship (Also dating a 20 year old student) Monica becoming over-obssesive with cleaning and Chandler being less afraid of comitment. Even Joey changed a little.

The problems gathered on this season was absolutely fun to watch.

And, plus the special features on this dvd is great! My favorite one was The One That Goes Behind The Scenes, where the shooting of season six's first episode was shown.

Witness the gang going from 20-somethings hanging out in a coffeehouse to 30-somethings hanging out in a coffeehouse. Buy this dvd to know what I'm saying.",1132444800,3,1408,4.9491525423728815

The season ends with ""The One With the Proposal"", when Chandler is pyching himself up to propose to Monica, and Richard intervenes. The season ends with their engagement, and I would definatley recommend this one to any fellow Friends fan.",1114732800,3,651,4.7105263157894735
1958436,5,B0000X2ECE,"Along with Seinfeld and Frasier, Friends dominated the must-see TV of the 1990's. Winner of innumerable television awards, the show features the lives of six friends in their late-twenties/early-thirties living in New York City - Monica Geller (Courteney Cox), Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), Ross Geller (David Schwimmer), Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc), and Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry). The six friends spend the majority of their time in a coffee house named ""Central Perk"" or in either Monica's apartment or Joey and Chandler's apartment.

The Friends (Season 6) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere in Las Vegas where Ross and Rachel wake up to discover they've gotten married. Ross tells Rachel that he annulled the marriage, but then tells Phoebe he really didn't. Meanwhile, Chandler and Monica decide to move in together rather than get married... In other episodes, Joey pretends to be the owner of a Porsche, Ross bleaches his teeth, and Reese Witherspoon guest stars as Rachel's sister. In the season finale, Chandler proposes to Monica...

1958437,5,B0000X2ECE,"I'm a huge Friends fan, so I was excited to see that I had gotten FRIENDS: THE COMPLETE SIXTH SEASON for Christmas. This is one of the best seasons, and its a DVD set I enjoy watching regularly.

Highlight episodes are:

*The One Where Phoebe Runs - Phoebe and Rachel decide that they're going to go jogging in the morning, because not only will they stay in shape, but it provides a great way to meet some new guys. But Rachel soon realizes that Phoebe doesn't just jog - she runs around like a maniac, causing a lot of unwanted attention and strange looks.

*The One With Ross's Teeth - Ross decides that he wants to whiten his teeth, but when he leaves the bleach on for too long, his teeth are practically radioactive. Not only do the ""friends"" make fun of him, but his new date thinks he's a little bit too weird for her liking.

*The One With the Unagi - Ross claims that he found some new martial arts thing that makes him ""unbeatable,"" when when Phoebe and Rachel challenge him, he decides that he's going to teach them a lesson they'll never forget.

FRIENDS: THE COMPLETE SIXTH SEASON has a lot of great moments, including a look back at what could have been if Carol hadn't come out of the closet and Rachel started dating Joey, Chandler admits that he can't cry...ever, and Ross dates one of his students while the rest of the group picks on him for it.

HIGHLY recommended!

1958438,5,B0000X2ECE,"We all wanted to know what had happened when we saw Ross and Rachel come out of the chapel after exchanging drunken vows. Well, the six friends let us in on what had happened when they returned for the sixth season.

Ross and Rachel wake up the next morning, thinking about nothing, except that they have severely bad hangovers. They then realize what they had done and figure out what to do. Rachel wants a divorce, but Ross immediately disagrees, for if they go through with a divorce, that'll make it Divorce #3 for Ross. He promises that he'll take care of it, but tells Phoebe that he did nothing and is letting the marriage stand without Rachel knowing. Rachel finds out and takes care of it herself, acting like Ross planned the drunken marriage. But Ross points out that it was Rachel who suggested it, not Ross. Rachel apologizes deeply.

Meanwhile, Monica and Chandler decide to move in together. Rachel moves out, but Phoebe invited Rachel to move in with her. Rachel accepts. Joey has Chandler's bedroom unoccupied, so he puts an ad out for a new roommate. Taking the extra room is Australian dancer, Janine. Joey is head over heels for Janine, but she feels nothing for Joey. Janine is then hired to be one of the dancers for Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve. She invites Joey, Ross, and Monica. Joey hopes to kiss Janine when the countdown begins, but when they finish the countdown, they director yells cut. Joey and Janine both confess to each other that they wanted to kiss each other, which leads them into actually kissing. The kiss leads them into a relationship. But that doesn't last long, for Janine does not like hanging out with Monica and Chandler. Joey asks her to move out, for he can't have this between her and his friends.

Phoebe's apartment burns up. The damages are bad, but they can be easily repaired. Monica makes up the extra bedroom for Rachel, while Phoebe moves in with Joey. But when Phoebe finds out that Rachel was the cause of the fire, when she left her hair-straightener plugged in, Phoebe moves in with Monica and Chandler, while Rachel moves in with Joey. Rachel's sister, Jill Green, shows up. She is just as spoiled as Rachel was, where Rachel tries to help Jill come out of that. She also tries to persuade Ross not to date Jill, but Jill seduces Ross into dating her, because of Rachel going against it. Ross sees that dating Jill is wrong, so he dumps her. Jill yells at Rachel for doing what she did and tells her that she will not change her spoiled ways.

Meanwhile, Ross, who is now a college professor in Paleontology, begins dating Elizabeth, one of his own students. He meets Elizabeth's dad, Paul. Paul disapproves of Ross, because of their age difference, but Paul makes the same mistake when he dates Rachel. Ross dumps Elizabeth because of her immaturity. Rachel breaks up with Paul, regretting that she made him get in touch with his sensitivity.

Chandler than decides that he is ready for full commitment. He decides that he wants to propose to Monica. But he wants the proposal to be a major surprise for Monica, so he throws her off track, making her think that he is never going to marry. Phoebe helps Chandler buy the ring. Chandler thinks of a way to propose to Monica, until Richard shows up. Richard had dated Monica during the last half of the second season, but they broke up because Richard did not want kids. Chandler is ready to ask the question, but finds out that Richard still loves Monica and wants her back. Chandler talks to Richard and finally makes Richard realize that his chance is gone. Richard agrees 100% and tells Chandler, ""...When you do get her, don't ever let her go"". He heads back to the apartment, hoping to find Monica there. But Joey comes out from his apartment and tells Chandler that Monica is gone. He tells him that Monica was so upset with Chandler, that she moved out of the apartment and moved back into her parents and does not want to see Chandler for awhile. Heartbroken, Chandler goes inside the apartment to call Monica, but he finds the apartment filled with candles. And there is Monica. Monica begins proposing, but she claims in joyful tears that, ""...There's a reason why girls don't do this"". Chandler bends down on one knee. He tells her, in the most romantic way, how much he loves her, while shedding a few tears himself. He then pulls out the ring and asks the big question. Monica, through her tears, more than happily accepts.

Just think that this almost became their last season, until their producers promised the cast their full share. This is another one of their best, so buy it and get ready to laugh your a** again with the complete sixth season. Guest stars include: Tom Selleck, Elle Macpherson, Reese Witherspoon, Christina Pickles, Elliott Gould, & Bruce Willis.

In this episode they are invited to Dick Clark's ""Rocking New Year Eve Party."" There they decide to do ""the routine"" some dance steps that they did when they were a children. These two think that doing this will ensure that they will get picked to dance on stage and be seen on national television. Ross and Monica are the only ones who seem to think that there dance moves are good. They get chosen to dance on stage but unbeknownst to them it's for the ""bloopers"" part of the show. I also enjoyed the episode entitled ""The one where Pheobe runs."" Instead of jogging through the park like normal adults Pheobe runs through the park like a giddy child. Chandler as a good gesture attempts to clean the apartment for Monica. Then Ross tells him that Monica will not be impressed. To keep Monica from coming into the apartment they say that Ross is naked because he has something. Then Monica lets the cat out of the bag by asking him ""Do you have what Chandler had."" Now Ross is curious as to what did Chandler have. The funniest line in the show is when Ross asked ""So dude what did you have."" After the subject has changed and Chandler thinks that it has escaped Ross's mind he asks again. ""Really dude what'd you have.""",1107475200,,1391,4.416342412451362

1958443,5,B0000X2ECE,"Season 6 is a sentimental favorite of mine of all the seasons of Friends because this is the season when I first started watching the show. And now that I've seen every single episode in the entire series, season 6 still delivers.

Highlights have to be TOW Ross Got High(one of my all time favorites, all six stole scene after scene from each other, cementing their ensemble as one of the best in TV history), TOW Rachel's Sister and TOW Chandler Can't Cry (Reese Witherspoon is one of the best guest stars in the series, the two part episode was memorable), TOW the Last Night (hilarious and moving, the three ladies stole the show), TO That Could Have Been (seriously funny, Kudrow, Perry, Schwimmer, and Cox were all a riot in here) and of course the big payoff TOW the Proposal (most memorable engagement ever, Cox and Perry were especially moving)

As for the special features, I've listened to all three commentaries by the creators (Ross Got High, TOT Could Have Been, TOW the Proposal) and I must say all three are good. My only complain is please have the cast do a commentary I'm sure it wouldn't be the worst thing. There's also a blooper reel for the season and some really hilarious like Matthew Perry's obsession with his feces (lol). There's also short interviews with some of the recurring stars like Maggie Wheeler, Christina Pickles, Elliot Gould etc.

I've watched several seasons of FRIENDS. At first, I enjoyed it. Then I realized how I was losing my time following the ""exploits"" of these utterly mean characters. Do you doubt me? So, let's check it:
* Chandler: sarcastic, annoying, jealous of his friends or girlfriends. Who would support to live so many years alongside a ""friend"" that makes fun of everything you say?!
* Ross: insecure, jealous (all of them are jealous to the bone) and also bad to other people. It was HE who proposed to Emily, only to humiliate her at the altar by speaking Rachel's name. Absurd.
* Monica: the control freak who became worse and worse with each passing season. I'm sorry for Chandler...
* Joey: theoretically, a good guy, but in truth a guy that has absolutely no respect for women, dumping them at will, and telling anyne about his ""exploits"". Disgusting.
* Rachel: alwayas dating, dating, and more dating. A spoiled girl.
* Phoebe: absolutely insane, full of psycological troubles, utterly boring,the worst of them all. Lisa Kudrow hit the jackpot here.",1087948800,2,1090,4.803191489361702

1958449,5,B0000X2ECE,"Ah, season six, the last season when these six actors, each generously endowed with natural comedic gifts, actually used those gifts to develop clean, finished performances. This fine season produced some very high quality episodes. The One Where Ross Got High is one of my favorites, in which each of the friends has a relatively small comic thread which they spin out just enough to make it uproarious yet somehow subtle, with almost Frasier-like precision and elegance, and they are all pulled together in the end by a hillarious monologue delivered by Christina Pickles in her most delightful guest appearance ever in her recurring role as Mrs. Geller.
""Friends"" was a SUPERB show --once upon a time. It started sagging in season seven, and never quite made a full recovery. It probably should have folded like ""Seinfeld"" the minute the writers could sense the decline (and a good writer would have). And season six would have been an incredible final season. Perhaps more loose ends would have to be tied up at the end --but just having Monica and Chandler get engaged did half the trick! It was the last ""Friends"" season finale to not be a cliffhanger, so it wouldn't need too much tweaking. Why does everything have to change at the end of a series anyway? One of the all time greatest sitcom finales was from Cheers, where life emphatically went on as usual, with just the realization that this was ok. So, here's what I'm going to to do to keep ""Friends"" as one of my all time favorite shows: I'm going to pretend it ended with season six.

Chill! As Ross and Rachel Ross and Rachel Ross and Rachel (the least likely couple since those two from 'Chips') whine and priss and evoke feelings of vague-yet-palpable Murderousness in the viewer.
Spill! As Joey and Phoebe bring up the rear of this dismal sextet by glorifying Stupidity and Mental Weakness.

There is nothing funnier at the end of a long work day than these episodes and this is by far my favorite season.  It ends with Chandler proposing to Monica and it is fantastic!

As the series goes on, and continues to be released on DVD it only gets better and better.  If you want something great to watch over and over, you won't regret buying any of these.  In fact it seems to have gotten better around season 3, when the writers got more into the character's lives.  For a long time, I thought friends was a chick thing, but after watching I realized it's not.  Not to mention it's damn funny.  Enjoy...",1075593600,5,559,4.226415094339623
1958464,4,B0000X2ECE,"""Friends: The Complete Sixth Season"" ends on such a high note, arguably the finest moment in the history of the series, that you tend to forget that this was an uneven year.  In retrospect it marks the irrevocable shift from the Ross and Rachel axis to the Monica and Chandler axis, but it took some doing.  After all, the previous season ended with Monica and Chandler deciding on an impromptu wedding only to discover that a drunken Ross and Rachel had beat them to the punch.  The aftermath of that great joke (you want to see Ross and Rachel married?  Presto!  They are married!) takes up the first story arc of the season while Chandler's proposal to Monica provides the season ending bookend.
Best Episodes of the Sixth Season: ""The One After Vegas,"" the season premier, where Ross and Rachel wake up without any memory of being married and Chandler tries to let Monica know that he thinks they should move in together; ""The One With Ross's Denial,"" has Monica and Chandler finding over where ""his"" stuff will go in ""their"" apartment, while Ross suggests Rachel move in with him, still having avoided telling her that he has not gotten their marriage annulled; ""The One on the Last Night,"" has a great bit where Chandler has to invent a game called ""Cups"" to find ways of giving Joey money until he finds a new roommate, while Phoebe tries to save everybody else from Monica having them help Rachel pack, but the best bit are Monica and Chandler saying farewell to their old roommates; ""The One Where Ross Got High"" has Monica's parents visiting for Thanksgiving dinner and she does not want them to know that she is living with Chandler because they do not like him.  Apparently they think he turned Ross on to drugs way back when (that was Ross's story and he is sticking to it), which leads to one of the funniest 30 seconds ever as the Geller siblings totally out each other to their parents; ""The One Where Chandler Can't Cry"" continues the misadventures of Ross with Rachel's kid sister, Jill (Reese Witherspoon), but the best bits here are Chandler's explanation for while the fact the cartoonists stopped drawing the deer in ""Bambi"" never made him cry and the clip from the infamous porno video made by Phoebe, ""Buffay the Vampire Layer""; and, the best for last, ""The One with the Proposal, Part 1 & 2,"" where Chandler wants his proposal to Monica to be a surprise (just writing about this scene starts the tears coming).
The pivotal moment in this season comes in a rather lackluster episode, ""The One Where Paul's the Man,"" which has stupid shtick going on with Ross and his college co-ed girlfriend Elizabeth hiding form her father (poor Bruce Willis).  A subplot has the gals visiting a museum where there is a long waiting list, and as a lark they all put their names on the list.  Of course, when the phone call comes to tell Monica that there is an opening available for the Geller-Bing wedding, it is Chandler that hears the phone message first.  A frantic Monica rushes to convince him that it did not mean anything, not knowing that Chandler has already decided the idea is perfect, thereby starting the final story arc centering on the big proposal.  There was a chance that ""Friends"" was going to end with the sixth season, so they came up with something that would have been memorable enough (which would be a good portent for what we will see this spring at the end of all things).
But as great as the grand finale ends up being, it does not make up for some of the low points of season six, such as ""The One With Ross's Teeth,"" ""The One with the Joke,"" ""The One with Joey's Fridge,"" and ""The One Where Ross Meets Elizabeth's Dad.""  You look at that list, and it becomes clear that any episode that centers around the guys without seriously involving the gals, was an iffy proposition during season six.  Get them involved, e.g., ""The One with Unagi,"" and you have something.  Do a clip show (i.e., ""The One with MAC and C.H.E.E.S.E.) or double up for a ""what if"" episode so Monica's fat suit can come out of the closet (""The One That Could Have Been Part 1 & 2"") and the results are even worse, although even that debacle emphasized the idea that Monica and Chandler belong together, which is what this sixth season certainly boils down to in the end.",1074816000,8,4280,4.5718015665796345
1958465,1,B0000X2ECE,"Friends is immensely popular.  No doubt.  And I guess I understand that.  The characters are very much like the ""populars"" you find in high school.  Maybe a little bit smarter.  Definitely a little bit funnier.  But they're are the same shallow, repulsive folks that--if you had a little on the ball--you tried to avoid.  Like the plague.  You know the type.  The girls who were more attractive than average, usually really skinny, and way too chipper.  And then the guys.  Kinda clunky.  No depth at all.  Smug.
As you might have guessed, I find it very difficult to watch this show.  Far from making me laugh, these characters make me want to leave.  And the writing is so flat, so corporate, so uninspired, that it amounts to junk-food humor, with a carefully orchestrated laugh track so numbed viewers know exactly where to laugh.
It's because of stuff like this that I've stopped watching TV altogether.  Try it.",1074038400,10,917,4.745222929936306

 Monica and Chandler move in together,jarring the winning chemestry a bit. The winning pairing of former roommates Joey and Chandler takes on a new direction. Ross struggles with his third marriage(to Rachel),and Phoebe is still the only reliable constant.
 The classic episodes include The One where Phoebe Runs,....Ross's Teeth,....the Routine,....Unagi,...and....That Could Have Been.
