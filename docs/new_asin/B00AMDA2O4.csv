5450534,5,B00AMDA2O4,I have thoroughly enjoyed the newer trend toward these collections of somewhat obscure but enjoyable movies.  There is no requirement for all the latest and greatest and this fills the bill very well.,1400544000,4,200,5.0606060606060606
5450535,5,B00AMDA2O4,"Don't miss out on this one, 10 movies in 1 set, you can't beat it!

You have to love the variety of shows on this one,",1396915200,2,118,3.5384615384615383
5450536,1,B00AMDA2O4,"I would have to be paid to watch some of these again.  The best of them are maybe two star movies, the worst are not deserving of a single star.",1395187200,7,144,3.8
5450537,5,B00AMDA2O4,"Great value!  The movies are fairly family friendly as advertized.  My kids have loved them.  For the price, hard to go wrong.",1391644800,11,126,4.636363636363637
5450538,5,B00AMDA2O4,This collection is great. I purchased this because my wife likes Ghost Dad but the other movies are also really good. I would recommend this movie collection to all.,1389830400,7,165,4.724137931034483
5450539,5,B00AMDA2O4,The movies are great and my kids love them. They are movies that came out when I was in college so I was not familiar with them. Our sitter was excited when she saw this disk and grabbed my kids and they were immediately immersed.,1388361600,13,230,4.133333333333334
5450540,4,B00AMDA2O4,"I did enjoy some of these, such as ""King Ralph"" and ""Cloak and Dagger"". But i found some of the others too slow, like ""The Wizard"". Still, there aren't any movies here I wouldn't bring kids to see, so it does meet the description of ""Family"" movies; although I'm not sure ""Favorites"" is a good choice of words - I'm not quite sure whose favorite these would be. (Personally I'd rather see ""the Goonies"" and the first three Indiana Jones movies in a ""favorite"" collection)",1387065600,2,471,4.552941176470588
5450541,5,B00AMDA2O4,"Great collection of family movies! I bought it for ""A Simple Wish"" and ""The Borrowers"", two of my favorite movies as a kid. I haven't had any picture or sound issues with any of the movies, and watching stuff like ""Matinee"" and ""Srgt. Bilko"" bring back fun memories. Definetely one of the better movie collections out there. I got mine at Wal-mart for $5, in a sale bin. Amazon has it for $9 and even at that price you're paying a buck a movie, still a major deal.",1386028800,24,464,4.284090909090909
5450542,5,B00AMDA2O4,these films bring back memories. my favorite movies are ED(1996) GHOST DAD(1990) COP AND A HALF(1993) MATINEE(1993) THE WIZARD(1989) CLOAK AND DAGGER(1984) A SIMPLE WISH(1997) KING RALPH(1991) if you love classic funn films this is a must have dvd for families.,1376265600,10,261,5.390243902439025
5450543,5,B00AMDA2O4,I had dinner and a movie party for my eight-year-old and purchased this as party favors. 10 movies for $499 each as an add on item. Ive  only watched one of the movies . I cant imagine they're not all amazing  choices for that age group and definitely priced right. Ive wrapped them up with candy and popcorn for the girls to take home and its a non-junk party favor item that will be valued.,1524182400,,392,4.213333333333333

5450570,4,B00AMDA2O4,Great price for 10 movies. The only reason I didn't give it a 5-star was because a few of the movies have several incidences of bad language which doesn't work when you have little kids in the house.,1511481600,2,199,4.2631578947368425

This was a mistake. The set contains 10 movies on 3 discs. I assumed they'd be double sided DVDs and Dual Layered. They weren't. They were single-sided Dual Layered DVDs with some of the video quality lowered for data space. And They took out the captions and subtitles, also to save space on the discs.

I borrowed my friend's copy of ""the wizard""s indvidual release and it had better quality.

So, IMO, stick with the original indvidual releases",1464134400,10,724,6.22

Cloak & Dagger--2 stars---best suited for school-age children--too much talking for younger kids.
The Wizard--1 star-- depicts violence in some scenes.
Cop and a Half--3 stars--fun premise, but shows a woman leaving a child alone by himself at night.
King Ralph--2 stars--small kids didn't like it, maybe school-age children would.
Matinee--3 stars--won't hold a smaller child's attention--otherwise--okay.
Sgt. Bilko--4--not great, but fun for everyone.
Ghost Dad--2 stars--foul language.
Ed--1 star--kids did not like it--we shut it off after 12 minutes.
A Simple Wish--5 star--most entertaining one in the collection!
The Borrowers--4 stars--silly and fun for everyone--some destruction in the film prevents me from giving it 5 stars.",1458345600,,842,5.682539682539683

Like many movies in the 80s the language was not suitable for children, and it left me wondering would it have been better to just by the individual movie.

Ghost Dad

One Simple Wish
The Borrowers

I'm certain there's been some compression done on these, but if there was, it's hardly noticeable. I'm sorry for all you film majors, I'm not that familiar with aspect ratio and compression ratings, and for you English professors, I'm well aware of my, abuse, of the comma in this sentence. (,)

The PROS are that you get 10 films for the price of one. It's a hodge podge of flicks noticeably marketed as Family classics. I don't know about YOUR family, but I seriously doubt any of these films can be considered family classics. In fact, I think the only classic here is GHOST DAD, but it's status in the classic section is listed under excrement. So in a sense you've got a fossilized POS in Ghost Dad (or so reviews would say when it was released)

I purchased this set in order to acquire another copy of one of my favorite flicks: MATINEE as directed by Joe Dante (of Gremlins fame) I find it to be a hilarious look at the golden age of b-films in theaters and a welcome tribute to the legendary King of Theater camp William Castle. The film recreates the gag that William Castle had done with the film THE TINGLER (starring Vincent Price) and the allusions to corny scientific exposition is present here as well, you'll hear medical terms and made up terms deefined the very second they're mentioned.

The film within the film: MANT is worth the price of admission alone.

Basically the film is about a group of adolescents living near military camp in the 1950's at the peak of the Cuban missile crisis and it draws comparisons between the fear and panic of the time vis a vis the same matinee experiences the children had at the theaters watching Ghoulish B movies about hypnotism, and the ramifications and fantastic results of atomic energy exposure. There are elements of doom present in the film, and it serves as a comedic coming of age slice of life; and presents many perspectives of the day: those who believed the government propaganda about duck and cover safety and those that didn't. I believe that this is likely the ONLY ""kid-themed"" movie on the collection, unless you count the pile of chimp crap that is ED.

KING RALPH: I'll keep it brief. This movie is hilarious. But it will likely find an audience with adults or 10-13 year olds. There's a sentimental scene that starts in a British strip joint. Although there's no direct nudity, it's half there for anybody concerned with such things titillation. There are a few curse words as well but it's safe. The film DOES have that boring UK feel to the color scheme, I wonder if it has much to do with film stock or just the grey casting of the environment out there. Had the film been a bit crisp and brighter it'd be a really youthful appealing film. The title Credit Fonts are bad too. Those and the ""zip"" noises at the culmination of the introductory scene are the only things I can complain about. Had I never bought this collection I may have never bothered watching this film. It's hilarious.

The concept is that Ralph (a sports junkie everyday man who sings in a lounge in Las Vegas) is a distant relative to the throne of the King of England. As the royal family rather stupidly arranges for an elaborate family photo on the wet lawn in front of several submerged power connectors they all die on camera when the camera man clicks the electronic shutter. Ralph inherits the throne by being the only surviving member of the royal family. Various people in the aristocracy take offense at the fact that an AMERICAN will be assuming the throne; there are several ploys to have his name tarnished through his activities, and ""hijinks ensue"". You get the point. This film is hilarious fun for people who love John Goodman (still probably THE greatest guest host ever on Saturday Night Live)

The only other film I have bothered to watch so far was GHOST DAD, it was NOTORIOUSLY panned when it was released. It's namesake is up there with OH HEAVENLY DOG! and other such box office failures.

I found the effects to be tastefully done and pretty good given its era. But the overall film was too grim for me to really consider it a comedy. The family loses their father (who is already living mostly in absentia due to his strenuous work schedule) to a freak occurrence with a ""satanic taxi driver"" (yes, that's a key plot element). Its up to Bill Cosby to discover he is actually dead (or is he?) and try to save the family from financial ruin and well, homelessness. Not a really funny situation. It is far too realistic for me to laugh at, no, not the ghost dad part, the vulnerability of his family to succumb to peril when the bread winner dies.

Somehow most of the family seems to deal with his death rather conventionally and easily. Although he can be SEEN in the dark, for some reason no one is horrified or really truly sad on screen after finding out their father is dead. He eventually summons some way to grasp and touch things but this is still a frightening position. That this was directed by Sidney Poitier makes it all the more stranger. Its an odd film, i'm surprised it was even made. Though there are a few comedic bits, it all felt in the end like a bad dream I might have had after a few pints too many; not funny, not scary, almost not interesting, but just a total strange experience. I can't see others finding it ""so bad it's good"" either. I actually thought the special effects were pretty darn good considering the era.

Anyways, that is all I'll review of the collection: the only other film I Intend on watching is THE WIZARD with Fred Savage. I remember that film with an incredible nostalgia for its corniness ""YOU SCORED 50,000 POINTS on DOUBLE DRAGON!!??!!"""" and the incredible POWER GLOVE scene. Growing up with Nintendo in the golden age of the late 80's was a great time to be a child. Not perfect, but before the decline of street playing and sports, and the advent of the digital age. I'm holding back watching this one in order to prevent losing the sentimental value it has had over the years. Sometimes you can't go back home.

I don't believe I'll watch any of the other films

DETAILS: 8 films on 3 DVDS: There is only ONE MENU on each disc, although the chapters are still intact, you don't get a SUB MENU or even a TITLE MENU for any of the films. These are bare bones but good transfers. Almost like the modern dvd rental copy.

I really wish MATINEE would get a better treatment on DVD, I wish Joe Dante could produce MANT into a feature length film. The humor of it is just so hilarious.

I'm also still waiting on CRITERION to do a true upgrade of THE WIZARD; maybe give the public an idea of what it meant to be in that era where there were the incipient video game battles and contests. It would be something for a historical sense. Not that anybody really truly cares these days, but I have just realized that my joke suggestion for a CRITERION release might actually have some merit. (BARELY)

Enjoy a couple of films. I'm sure they're not ALL horrible. I'm looking at Burt Reynolds here and thinking that COP and a HALF would appeal to a 3-5 year old.",1442448000,34,7271,4.505311077389985
