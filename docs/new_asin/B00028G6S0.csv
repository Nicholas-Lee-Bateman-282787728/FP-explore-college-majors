2067465,3,B00028G6S0,"Although the title is very misleading to me as a researcher of laboratory alchemy, the video is interesting and well thought out non the less.

It primarily focuses on the ""Cross of Hendaye"" found in france which was supposedly created by an unknown alchemist. After an incredibly thorough investigation into the symbology depicted on the cross Mr. Weidner concludes that it is warning us of an impending global/galactic disaster caused by the center of our galaxy exploding and spewing deadly dust onto the earth on or near 2012 which also happens to be the end of the mayan calendar.

His conclusions were very interesting but left many unanswered questions that seemed foolishly overlooked such as the massive distance measured in many light years from earth to the center of the galaxy. This distance is so vast that it would take hundreads of years simply for the light from such an explosion to reach us not to mention that the fallout from such a dust cloud would literally take thousands of years or more to reach earth. It just doesn't make any sense that such an event can occur here on earth in 2012 if caused by such an event. Its very strange to me that someone as intelligent and thorough as Mr. Weidner failed to explain this point at all.

Although his research is highly thought provoking, i find his conclusions are not well supported (at least not yet). The video is much more about end of the world prophecy than it is alchemy in any sense of the word.",1145664000,60,1472,4.653846153846154
2067466,4,B00028G6S0,"I think the film is informative and well disposed to an audience not already familiar with the findings of Weidner and Bridges. The deschiffering of the inscription of the crux though is difficult to follow, as in the book. But a structured mind mabye here find the clues she or he needs to go on by her/himself.",1122508800,9,312,4.491228070175438
2067467,4,B00028G6S0,"Recently I read the Da Vinci Code and my eyes were opened to a different view of the spiritual history of the West. In my opinion, Secrets of Alchemy does the Da Vinci Code one better because it is a true story.

In this documentary, we learn of a cross in a churchyard in the south of France that predicts the end of this age in which we live.  Jay Weidner leads us through the experiences, outer circumstances and inner revelations, which helped him to crack the code on this cross. He tells us of his many adventures going from Hollywood to France to Egypt and Peru to follow this trail no matter where it leads him.

My friends and I have watched Secrets of Alchemy repeatedly now and each time its magical quality changes. Thanks to this documentary, I think that I have developed a greater understanding of what alchemy is all about. It helped me to finally comprehend why knowledge of the tarot, astrology, alternative history, mystical Christianity and the Kabbalah is so essential to understanding alchemy. Secrets of Alchemy has given me a lot to think about.",1113868800,43,1069,4.61578947368421
2067468,5,B00028G6S0,Stunning metaphysical detective work.  Jay's imaginative and cretive thought process opens new realms in numerology and esoteric principles.  It is obvious that Jay has studied many traditions and has come up with his own unique perspective.  Alchemy is still alive and effective in our so called high tech society.,1113782400,11,315,5.387755102040816
2067469,5,B00028G6S0,"The film Secrets of Alchemy is not just a work about alchemy but is also a work of alchemy. By juxtaposing his inner and outer alchemical adventures with montages of flowing light filled vistas, clouds and landscapes, Weidner creates a visual tapestry that has the same feel as the films Koyaanisqatsi and Baraka.  Moreover, Weidner's fascinating tale of his personal journey has inspired me to look deeper into the ancient teachings of my own Western heritage. My only complaint is that it left me wanting more.",1112400000,19,512,4.953488372093023
2067470,4,B00028G6S0,"Jay Weidner has produced an excellent documentary, with high-quality visuals and a compelling flow that will keep you interested until the last minute.  At the end of the DVD, I found myself thirsting for more.  The only reason I didn't rate this 5 stars is because the visuals displayed a tendency towards redundancy.

""Secrets of Alchemy"" explores the underlying ""mystical"" meaning of alchemy, as opposed to the commonly-held ""literal"" view of its purpose.  Although the documentary leans towards interpreting the symbols on the ""Cross of Hendaye,"" I felt as if Weidner was really trying to communicate profound mystical concepts inherent in an understanding of alchemy.

Well thought out with excellent story-telling, this DVD will not disappoint anyone on the road to enlightenment and meaning in a world seemingly devoid of both.",1109548800,38,834,5.33587786259542

8023676,1,B00028G6S0,Just an advertisement for an other DVD. Don't waste your time or money. This DVD was lacking in content.  Felt like a rip off.,1396137600,2,126,4.25
8023677,5,B00028G6S0,This product came at a low price and it arrived ahead of schedule which is a win-win for me! Great product and great service! Item was as listed/pictured! I will buy from this merchant again and I highly recommend them!,1378080000,,219,4.5

8023680,2,B00028G6S0,"I think this documentary was entertaining. But if you are in the pursuit of divine truth, I think this is not what will provide it. I may be wrong, though.",1196380800,2,155,4.2
8023681,5,B00028G6S0,"This DVD is a wonderful companion to Weidner & Bridges book, The Mysteries of the Great Cross of Hendaye. Weidner is a Think-Outside-The-Box kind of guy. That's probably why he was able to reach the conclusion that he comes up with concerning the Great Cross of Hendaye. When you get to the part where he reveals the deciphered message encoded in the Cross you may be as blown away as I was. It's an impressive (dare I say almost magical) solution to the puzzle. Breathtaking visuals and plenty to think about when it comes to the underlying philosophy.",1190505600,7,553,4.653061224489796
