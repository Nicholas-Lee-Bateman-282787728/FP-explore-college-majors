A bit long but quite a tale",1435363200,,67,4.230769230769231
7090399,3,B00VHAGCJA,"Thoroughly entertaining and extremely frustrating is how Lil Quinquin ended up being for me. If you search the internet you will find a lot of fancy reviews that try and analyze, philosophy and compare this to Twin Peaks and True Detectives. Believe me when I say that these comparison are the farthest from the truth. Just because you have two detectives riding around in car trying to solve multiple murders doesn't make this a True Detective clone as well as having a town with quirky characters doesn't make it a Twin Peaks clone. The tone, plots and execution of these two series are completely different then Lil Quinquin.
The set up is that a cow has been found dead in a concrete pit and they end up finding body parts inside the cow. The detective starts his investigation and as the 3 1/2 hour story unfolds, more and more bodies start to pile up. This is the main plot along with kind of a subplot about a boy, Lil Quinquin, and his girl friend who just started summer vacation. You follow their exploits and adventures as they get involved to some extend in the investigation plus doing what kids do in the summer. I have to admit I really like these two kids. They were interesting characters and they did a great job acting. You could also see the love they had for each other at such a young age. They really played off each other well and I give the director credit for finding two kid actors who could do that.
The detective is the funniest and most entertaining part of the film. It's obvious that the director wanted to do a Inspector Clouseau type being very serious with a bumbling idiocy to him. It's not as over the top and crazy as Peter Sellers was, but you can tell.
It is also true that some of the other characters are quirky in some ways but it's mostly done for subtle comedic value. Sometimes it comes off extremely well and other it fails. A good example of failing is during the funeral for the first woman they find murdered. There are two priest conducting the service and for some reason the director thought it would be funny to have these two act like bumbling idiots. They actually turn it into a sort of a Three Stooges routine but not quite as crazy. It just doesn't work and seems ludicrous and out of place to see priest acting like this at a funeral especially when this is a comedy drama and not a full on slap stick film. Also, there seems to be a running gag of mentally and physically disabled people in this town, including Lil Quinquin and the detective.  I'm not really sure what the point was with this other then comedic value, though I'm sure some people might find it exploiting and tasteless. It just seems odd to me, yet it was pretty entertaining  to watch these people as well.
So now we come to what frustrated me about this film. The ending....Stop reading if you don't want spoilers.........

So you have this 3 1/2 hour murder mystery with a handful of people that get murdered and the clues start coming together over the story. You have your suspects and perhaps there is one in particular that has a motive and could be the killer, which is Lil Quinquins father. However, you think the thing is going to be solved and BAM....it ends.... No resolution.. No mystery solved... 3 1/2 hours the viewer spent investing in this story, the characters and the murders and the director ends it while the detective is still investigating. I find this a total slap in the face of the audience. I find it a joke that is played on us the viewers. I just can't understand why you would end a murder mystery like that. Can you imagine getting into a great gothic murder mystery novel and the last few pages had been ripped out. One possible explanation is that I read that this was actually a series in France and possible it was going to be renewed for a second run. If that's the case, perhaps we will get a ending revealing the killer and his motive but I have a feeling this was a one time deal and this is how the director decided to end it. Such a good film with a crappy ending and that's very frustrating..",1435363200,5,4064,4.416
7090400,4,B00VHAGCJA,"Director Lasse Hallstrom was great at taking small cloistered communities, with their oddball inhabitants, and making them come alive and make a certain amount of sense. Creator Bruno Dumont takes that same sensibility to the enth degree with this far out gem.

Here's the scoop. In a small, farming community on the French coast, bodies start turning up. Some are found in pieces inside dead cows. Others are found whole. All are related to one another either by blood or by marriage, The local sheriff needs to find the nefarious individual responsible for these dastardly acts.

This is so far out you can't even see reality from here. Take the title character Quinquin. He's a moon-faced young boy with a hearing aid and a hare lip. He's full of hell and always stirring things up with firecrackers or just general mischief. But he is surprisingly tender toward his neighbor/girlfriend Eve. Eve's older sister is entering a local singing contest but only seems to know one song. Every third or fourth person in the town suffers from one mental disorder or another. Even the sheriff has a bizarre facial tic and sports a tremendously odd gait. He also seems to see himself as a cop from a movie or TV show. The way he interacts with people has to be seen to be believed.

I guess you can call this cinema of the absurd. It is one weird scene after another. I can't say there is any one anything that is played straight. And, as a series totaling a near three and half hours, that's a lot of weird. Surprisingly, they don't spend all that much time on the murders themselves. The viewer gets a taste of the community. There are German bunkers on the beach left over from WWII. Grenades that have not been disposed of. A couple of Muslim young boys who are not thought well of by some of the locals and an assortment of cows, pigs chickens, horses and what not.

All I can say is this has to be seen to be believed. It's not for every taste and will frustrate all but the most ardent fans of wild and wooly cinema. If you like your movies served up with a side of bizarre, you'll be stuffed to the gills.",1434672000,4,2105,4.473958333333333

8710147,1,B00VHAGCJA,"What the movie has going for it is the absurd. Really weird character, played by excellent actors. The plot is just horrible, without any discernible reason or logic. The murders never get solved. There is no rhyme or reason. The movie loves just showing static scenes for ever and ever - the same content could easily have fitted in a 40 minutes sequence vs. 3 and a half mind numbing hours. The only reason we kept watching was to find out who dunnit and if there would be any reason to it after all. Neither gets answered, the movie just ends. Avoid at all costs.",1529107200,,566,4.4
8710148,1,B00VHAGCJA,"Really hated this; quit after an hour and I think we weren't even halfway through.  Tried it on the basis of a review in the New Yorker magazine, but I think the reviewer was stretching to come up with ""5 videos to stream this weekend.""  Creepy characters.",1505260800,,256,4.425531914893617
8710149,4,B00VHAGCJA,"Ptit Quinquin sounds like something out of Tin Tin, but it is the reverse side of Dumonts serious realistic dramas set in Northern France, like LHumanite and Hors Satan. Just as Greek drama has its tragedies, it has its comedies. This 4 part series made-for-TV channel Arte, is a subversive take on a very dark Gallic black humour. A murder investigation that remains a mystery, with the two clueless gendarmes, one Van der Weyden (Bernard Pruvost),  too busy mumbling vague warnings about the presence of evil, to actually ask any real questions,and his side-kick, Carpentier, who is equally odd with a mouthful of crooked teeth and an inability to drive his car on more than 2 wheels or to do 180 degree turns whenever he takes off. Of course Van der Weyden has bushy eyebrows that he raises a lot and facial tics,  also trips over continually and stares as if dumbfounded by the increasingly macabre deaths. He explains nothing and misses everything. There are cattle mutilations, human body parts eaten by cows, ad a young chanteuse eaten by pigs. The cows are found on the beach or in a bunker. During the investigation the officers are followed by a band of children headed by farmers son Lil Quinquin (Alan Delhaye) and including the young neighbour he loves, and trumpeter Eve(Lucy Caron). They are often on Lil Quinquins bike as he gives her a lift, a picture of innocence cruising the countryside.

There are scenes with people of disability, like the  comic scene in which a young man with learning difficulties joyously wreaks havoc in a restaurant, and the ones, where Quinquins Uncle Dany,  keeps swivelling round in circles before falling flat on his face. Dumont works with non professional actors, who bring a raw, awkward screen presence. Lil Quinquin s actor has a squashed flat pug nose. Quinquin and his neighbour Eve truly love each other, but he displays a vicious racism,that drives youth Mohamed to react violently, by shooting from his window, shouting Allah Akbar! The Commandant is in the habit of describing a horse as if it was a woman with its broad flanks( he doesnt see its a stallion), and he describes a killed naked woman as if she were a horse. He likes to feel the warm flesh of animals, as women are unobtainable. The murder investigation never finds a solution, nor registers any wisdom in solving the mystery or saving the potential suspects from being slaughtered apart from their passive routine investigation, and if you expect a thrilling whodunit, forget it, the ending can be overwhelmingly frustrating. The rustic storyline plays out like a farce, in a surprisingly broad, knockabout way. Subjects include immigration, racism, martial discord and of course death, with religion being satirised at a funeral, as priests cant contain themselves laughing.it gradually reveals  almost in spite of itself  a hidden network of secret family relationships and illicit liaisons in the small, ingrown community. When finally linked together, they provide a likely motive for the murders. A picture of post-Frexit France, isolated, provincial,inward-looking and prejudiced.",1470700800,,3111,5.052631578947368
8710150,4,B00VHAGCJA,"Li'l Quinquin is one of the strangest films I have ever seen. Somehow it grabs you and you continue watching through the 3 hours and 26 minutes it takes to the finish. It is at once perplexing and has the funniest funeral scene I have ever seen.

Alane Delhaye, plays the Quinquin, he is a funny looking kid and lives on a farm with his family, mother, father, grandparents and an uncle who has some form of mental illness. Li'l Quinquin has an impressive girlfriend, played by Lucy Caron, cute, intelligent and needs li'l for some reason.  These two are usually riding Li'l's bicycle, and often armed with two friends. On a particular day they find a murder investigation near their property.  The body of a woman has been found stuffed inside a dead cow, her head nowhere to be found. The Sherrif in charge of the investigation, played by Bernard Pruvost, is a man in his late 50s, with big hair and eyebrows, a strange gait, often trips over his own feet, and very pronounced facial tics. His second in com and, Chartier, has few teeth in his mouth, loves to drive the official po,ice car on two wheels, and in reality is a very poor driver.  These look like the two most careless and incompetent investigators, and they are. As one murder and another, and another occur, I thought I knew who the murderer was, but....

We follow the day to day lives of these people as the investigation continues. Again, the funeral service for the first victim is one of the funniest scenes I have seen. This is a small French community where it seems people are born, live and die in the same place. Not much changes, but racism, bullying and murder occur more frequently. This is a must see for mystery/detective lovers, bumbling Pink Panther it is not, but almost.

8710156,5,B00VHAGCJA,"First of all, this is marketed as a movie, but in fact it was shown as a TV series in France.  It is 206 minutes in length, and is best taken at least in two parts -- I had to watch it in three parts.  The blurb for it makes it sound like Twin Peaks and/or a murder mystery.  In fact, it is neither.  David Lynch might like this movie, but mainly because it portrays an affection for small town life that one can see in Twin Peaks.  Of course there are quirky characters aplenty, and that is part of the fun.  On the one hand we have a sort of unfiltered child's view through Li'l Quinquin and his pals (and boyhood enemies), and then we get the viewpoint of the comical and puzzling pair of investigators, the Captain (or Commandant?) and his Lt. Carpentier.  The evidence that can be found for the initial murder are illusive and seemingly impossible.  It may well be that this TV series will be continued, but just as with Twin Peaks, the point of the story seems to be the characters and not the solving of a murder.  If one can be satisfied with a slow, leisurely and somewhat twisted look at a modern small town in France, with its cast of imperfect, often virulently racist and contentious citizens (the Captain, or Sheriff is both derided and referred to as ""The Fog,"" for his peculiar ways), juxtaposed with the serene peace, frustration, and boundless enthusiasm of the children, then this is a very enjoyable film/TV series.  I found in the end I had escaped to another part of the world, and sometimes that's just what I need.",1435449600,3,1538,4.402826855123675
