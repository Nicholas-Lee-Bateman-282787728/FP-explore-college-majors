When I read the reviews I wanted to see the film for myself first. when I saw it the reviews were correct. This sucked! All they did was talk, talk, talk ,talk,talk, talk, talk. And there was this stupid sentence which stayed right in the middle of the movie saying Property of Retarded Films or something like that. Anyway trust me. I know and I was in the same position you were in. This movie sucked. If you don't believe me rent or borrow it and see it yourself.",1105660800,3,631,4.138211382113822
