  The experience has been great for our family. When you get these DVDs, you'll never want to watch anything else again! why?! because Worship DVDs contain God's truth and God's praise! Nothing is as awesome and beautiful and you totally get Addicted to it! lol! yeah, its a phrase used worldwide now amid our generation. i've been to India, Africa, China, and more, and everyone has the same phrase... ""Are you addicted to Hillsong?"" LOL! its because our generation is one that is really addicted to music and to God's presence, and when we find Him, we dwell there. finally! Good Christian Music in our generation! Praise the Lord! Thank you Jesus!

  Don't Worship worship. Worship our Beautiful, powerful, loving, caring, Just, Righteous, compassionate Savior, Healer, and Best Friend - The Father, The Son, the Holy Spirit... our Awesome God!

 God Bless and Keep blessing God!

They have brought us through many challenging times in our walk with the Lord and have given us such encouragement. Prior to ""Mighty to Save"", our favorite CD/DVD, by far, was ""Blessed."" Honestly, it took us several listenings before ""Mighty to Save"" attached itself to our hearts. Now we can't keep it out of the car's CD player nor the DVD player. What an awesome night of worship that was--and it lives on as it transports those who listen before God's throne of grace and glory. We would recommend this album to any who enjoy passionate, heartfilled praise and worship. The production of the DVD is tasteful yet graphically exciting. Thank you Hillsong for producing another great product.",1160265600,9,765,4.847328244274809
2630483,5,B000H7JCIM,"This one definitely has high energy - which is not always my preference for worship music, but in this case, I found it easy to enter into worship. I love the intro video composition, very moving. I am not crazy about the video editing, as others have mentioned, but I didn't find it that distracting after I got used to it for a bit. I also liked the variety of music as well, there is a good change of tempo and style throughout. Most importantly, you can sense that there was a prayerful and reverential approach, on the part of the musicians and the worshipers as well.",1234483200,,573,4.364485981308412
2630484,5,B000H7JCIM,EXCELLENT MISIC AND THE LYRICS. NOT ONLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE BUT FOR EVERYONE. NOT ONLY FOR LISTENING BUT ALSO GOES DEEP DOWN. I RECOMMEND VERY MUCH.,1224460800,,146,4.653846153846154
2630485,5,B000H7JCIM,"Awesome DVD.  The live worship was awesome and a blessing!  The 2nd DVD has great teaching resources on worship and playing the songs with guitar and other instruments.

Highly recommended!",1214956800,,189,5.233333333333333
2630486,5,B000H7JCIM,"The Hillsong team leads an arena full of people into musical worship for 18 songs.  The musicians and the audience seem to be completely focused on God, unaware of the many cameras that are capturing everything.  Just a powerful and moving display of praise.

The drum workshop on the bonus DVD is excellent, teaching drummers to play 3 of the 18 songs.  It's pretty detailed, explaining the feel of the song before demonstrating each part of the song.  There's also a guitar workshop and two documentary features on the bonus DVD.",1188345600,5,531,4.791208791208791
2630487,5,B000H7JCIM,This DVD is very highly recommended.  I have had this DVD for about 2 months and it is always a blessing whenever I play it.,1186185600,,124,3.96
2630488,5,B000H7JCIM,"Hillsong church has God's anointing on their song writers. The music is great, the lyrics are reflective of hearts. Relevant worship that will lift your spirit to enter His presence.",1184198400,,182,5.1
2630489,4,B000H7JCIM,"Although not a fan of the swirling cameras and jump cuts in the DVD, the music is excellent.  As a guitar player in a praise band, I found the guitar workshops very helpful.  They show you how to play a few songs (3) and share what effects they use to get their sound. If you play in a praise band and want to get your tone closer to Hillsong, this DVD will definitely help (with a little practice of course!)",1180656000,,409,4.1
2630490,5,B000H7JCIM,"Once again the Hillsong team has produced worship that helps your passion for God come out!  The video work is similar to ""God He Reigns"", and the music is still very inspirational.  I don't know how they outdo themselves every year, but they did it again!",1177372800,,256,4.543478260869565
2630491,4,B000H7JCIM,"The first 3-4 songs are a bit too 'rocky' for me and the camera work goes crazy during them, just hard on the eyes and is a distraction, however the rest of the DVD is quite good, overall I would recommend it.",1175817600,,209,4.0
2630492,4,B000H7JCIM,I love this DVD and all of Hillsongs music is uplifting and great for home worship.  I was disappointed that the words are not in the cover or on the DVD.  The children's DVD's are awesome too and they have an option with words on the screen so my children can sing along and it is good for children's church too.,1170028800,,313,4.114754098360656

8137367,5,B000H7JCIM,Simply next Gen Live Worship music geared to the teen & 20's even the 30's.  Great music again.,1421366400,,95,4.277777777777778
8137368,5,B000H7JCIM,This dvd is Awesome!!!! Two of the bonus songs is sang by Darlene Zschech which is a must have. The songs that did make it to the cd are more extended on the dvd cause on the cd they had to edit some stuff out of the songs due to the space. Cause the dvd can fit more than the cd can. MORE TO SEE & FOUND are 2 good songs but i feel they should of not been on the cd just the dvd only. THE DEEP OF YOUR GRACE & OPEN MY EYES & HOW GREAT IS OUR GOD. should of Made it on the cd in the place of MORE TO SEE & FOUND.,1389571200,,512,3.3846153846153846
8137369,5,B000H7JCIM,"If you need some time to worship the Lord Jesus who you believe in, be sure to have this as am inspirational tool to do so.
The Lord will come down not because of the CD or the videos, bur because of the willingness you have to do so and your personal relationship with HIM.

Love,

Carlos",1381449600,,289,4.052631578947368

8137371,1,B000H7JCIM,"The earlier Hillsong performances had something special; it was and is great. This dvd had too much visual flashy worn out editing gimmicks and desperation. Joel Houston didn't even sing his own song ""From the Inside Out.""  The 2nd dvd with guitar workshop was not worth watching from learning to play the songs point of view.  You'd think from the cover, it was going to be their best; they are living off the power of Mighty to Save song to push this thing.  More like Mighty Big Shame?  Christ you know it ain't easy......I'm a recent fan to Hillsong so I'm still enjoying the best from their past.  Oh well, the danger of losing critical perspective is a continual factor in Christianity.  And these people loving this thing have got their head up their .....abyss.  Maybe if I pray about it, I could find couple of more stars to stick up there?  I am grateful for the Message, A whole lotta stuff I've got to change in Me.",1370736000,,927,4.476190476190476
8137372,4,B000H7JCIM,Good vido but I like Hillsong,1311292800,,29,4.0
8137373,5,B000H7JCIM,This DVD is wonderful to watch and sing along to. It is entertaining but at the same time very touching and inspiring. I love to sit and pray while listening to some of the songs. It builds up my passion for God and gets me on fire to worship.,1256083200,,243,3.979591836734694
