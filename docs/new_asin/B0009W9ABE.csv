8068095,4,B0009W9ABE,"Interesting finale to the Cutting It series from Great Britain.  You often see this for extraordinarily high price, for some reason, but a reasonable copy can be found if you look hard enough.

The highlight of this last season is the addition of the beautiful James Murray to the cast.  He is in and out of favor, as the intrigues continue.  Now the salon has started an Academy and he involved in a shady way with the financing.  But, even if the rest of the series weren't as strangely interesting as it is, it might be enough just to watch James Murray.

Nicely photographed with interesting shots of modern Manchester.",1437350400,,623,4.618181818181818
