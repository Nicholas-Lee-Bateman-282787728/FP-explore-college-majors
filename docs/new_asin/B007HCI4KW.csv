8516623,5,B007HCI4KW,"Vice Raid stars the Fabulous Mamie Van Doren, as a hooker who frames a cop. Then the fun begins. I have met Mamie and she is so nice to her fans. I admire her for her stand on women's and gay rights. A living legend and one of the last of the stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood.",1396310400,3,280,3.76271186440678
8516624,4,B007HCI4KW,"I watched this today. Loved it. Mamie Van Doren is the only Marilyn clone who'd star in a movie called ""Vice Raid"". I love how blunt and no nonsense this picture is. It's a B picture and owns it. Mamie is a ""model"" from DETROIT. She empasizes ""Detroit"" when she says it. Everything she says in the entire picture sounds dirty. She's used by both the cops and the mob throughout the picture in a confusing web of entrapment schemes between all parties involved. Then Mamie's innocent kid sister moves in. Sis eventually is sexually assaulted and finally Mamie wises up! Richard Coogan is the supposedly good cop. Brad Dexter (Mr. Peggy Lee) is the mob boss interested in modeling agencies. Mamie wears white all the time in it and the musics swirls whenever she walks seductively- which is always.",1391126400,4,796,4.692857142857143
8516625,5,B007HCI4KW,"This movie is obviously not an Oscar winner, but it was a fun view of a bygone era of movie making.  It was a little bit film noir, a little bit exploitation film, but Mami Van Doren did what she did best...chewing up the scenery.",1375660800,,230,4.111111111111111
8516626,4,B007HCI4KW,"Vice Squad is an entertaining film and there's also a good amount of suspense as to how everything will actually work out. The plot moves along at a good pace but there are a few too many details that should have been left out to make everything a bit more understandable. The sets are not bad and the cinematography and choreography work well, too. The musical score, while not extensive because this film doesn't exactly scream ""musical,"" enhances the film as well. I also like the way the film was narrated.

When the action starts (and there's plenty of it for a 71 minute film) we quickly meet police Sergeant Whitey Brandon (Richard Coogan) and his assistant Ben Dunton (Joseph Sullivan) who, unbeknownst to Whitey, is also working for crime syndicate boss Vince Malone (Brad Dexter). Vince and his gang are especially notorious for running ""model"" agencies that are really a front for ""call girls;"" and Whitey like the other vice cops is trying to nab Vince. But things change when Vince hires Carol Hudson (Mamie Van Doren) to trap and frame Whitey so that he'll get kicked off the force. Even though neither Carol nor Whitey has any witnesses to what actually happened at their rendezvous in a hotel room, the police force finds Whitey guilty and he's canned as a result.

Whitey is furious, especially when he discovers that Ben has been working for Vince all along. Whitey tries to get his boss Captain William Brennan (Frank Gerstle) to help him clear his name and get Vince out of ""business"" for good; but this, too, is difficult because Brennan doesn't want to get involved. However, when Carol's younger sister Louise (Carol Nugent) suddenly shows up at Carol's fancy apartment given to her by Vince, this sets off a chain of very unexpected events that really kept me on the edge of my seat!

I've already left out some of the plot and I won't write more so that you can watch and enjoy this film. Look also for solid performances by Barry Atwater as Phil Evans, a guy working for Vince who won't keep his hands off Carol or Louise; Chris Alcaide as Eddie; Shepherd Sanders as Muggsy; George Cisar as Marty and Nestor Paiva as Frank. Juli Reding plays Gertie and Jeanne Bates plays Marilyn.

Vice Squad is a very good film for fans of the actors in this movie; it nicely showcases Mamie Van Doren as an actress who played her part better than I expected after reading so much about her lack of acting ability! In addition, people who like crime dramas will not be disappointed.",1371859200,8,2493,4.64625850340136
