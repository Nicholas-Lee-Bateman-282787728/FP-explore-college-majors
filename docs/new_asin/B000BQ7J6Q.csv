2437583,5,B000BQ7J6Q,"Five minutes into Santa's Slay, if you don't have a big grin on your face, you'd might as well shut it off, coz it doesn't let up from there.  This is a very fun film.  To horror fans, the concept of a maniac in a Santa suit isn't new, but this film does have a few original twists.  The Santa in this film is actually supposed to be the real Santa.  Apparently Santa was born of the devil on Christmas along with Jesus.  Being the devil's spawn, Santa basically enjoys killing everyone he comes into contact with on Dec 25th.  Why did he stop and become the lovable bringer of gifts we all know and love?  In a great flashback sequence(done in stop motion animation to look like the old Rudolph The Rednose Reindeer Christmas special) we learn that Santa lost a wager to one of God's angels and to fulfill his end of the bargain, had to bring happiness and cheer on Christmas for a thousand years.  Well, on Christmas of 2005, his contract is up and now he's back to the murderous son of satan that he originally was, killing just about everyone he can with exploding Christmas prsents and badazz Goldberg wrestling moves.  He's hot on the trail of the angel he lost the bet to, as well as the angel's grandson.  This film is 100% comedy.  You have to view it the same way you'd view one of the Leprechaun films, or the similarly themed Jack Frost.  The only reason it'll end up in the horror section at the video store, and not the comedy, is coz it has the structure and violence of a slasher film.  I've never been a fan of wrestling, so I know very little about Goldberg.  I remember his fifteen minutes of extreme fame a few years back, and that he was in that horrible Universal Soldier sequel with VanDamme, but I wasn't sure what to expect from him as a killer Santa.  Surprisingly he does a very good job!  Santa is supposed to be a Norse character in this film, and basically have the burly look of a viking.  Goldberg looks great as a viking Santa, even sporting a red hat with a spiked ball that looks like a viking helmet.  No reindeer pulling his sleigh, just a big mean looking ox, perfectly suited for Santa's barbarian look.  I was a little leery seeing that Brett Ratner was executive producer of this film(he directed the awful Rush Hour films as well as they dreadful Red Dragon), but in the end it made no difference, thank God.  This is 70 minutes of fun, and sure to become yearly Christmas viewing for my family.  Hopefully for yours too!",1135296000,2,2463,4.357456140350878
2437584,5,B000BQ7J6Q,"I originally watched this movie on Spike TV right before Halloween 2005. I hoped it would be on again before Christmas 2005, but no luck.  I guess it's one of those movies that they play on TV once, then move it onto video/dvd.

Let me say, this movie is a real good balance between Halloween and Christmas.  Right from the start of the movie  where Santa comes down the chimney, bounces on the table and 'carves' up the family during Christmas dinner, to the ending where Santa has the ""battle"" you'll laugh.

The plot synopsis in the movie description sums it up well.

The movie isn't for children, but older teenagers and up it should be fine.  There's some interesting lore on Santa and why he turns bad.

I liked Santas Slay.  It's not an Oscar winner, but it's enough to scare you as well as get you in the Christmas spirit.",1135209600,,831,4.4144736842105265

This was awesome... 3 scenes I thought were hilarious.

1) Beginning scene where everybody acts obnoxious and Santa comes in and kills them all. (Futurama rip-off?)

2) He walks into a stripper bar and says ""ho ho..."" and as one of the strippers walks past him he looks at her and says ""HO"".

It's got the stoic majestical cinematography of Gone with the wind yet still holds the viewers attention with pinpoint choreographed action packed adventure that the whole family can enjoy. Bill Goldberg paints his masterpiece in this sure-to-become holiday classic and the subtle social undertones really makes the film a credit to the industry. The only problem I have with the film is that I'm not watching it right now. If they could find a way to make it six or eight hours long, that would be a good start.

2437628,5,B000BQ7J6Q,"Christmas camp and horror doesn't get any better than this. Combine a solid back story with good actors,clever dialogue, and an especially appealing hate-to-hate-him bad guy, wrestler Bill Goldberg as the not-so-nice Santa, and you have a winner! From the excellent cameos at the start (James Caan, Fran Drescher, Chris Kattan from SNL) through its rollicking and irreverent conclusion, the movie is a one-liner-quip-filled joy ride from start to finish.

Why do I think it absolutely deserves 5 stars? Besides loving the film myself, I sat down and watched it with a non-horror fan who laughed out loud throughout the movie. Its outrageous humor and sometimes subtler nods to other campy horror films (""What is that, grandpa, the Necronomicon?) makes this winner.

2437645,5,B000BQ7J6Q,"This is a very good film for Christmas that is unexpectedly good. The film starts with an old lady at the deli and she is a shrew calling everybody names til' she gets rammed by Bill Goldberg playing Santa. Santa is supposedly the son of Satan & Erika,an immaculate conception like that of Jesus. The kids that work at the Jewish deli are kinda boyfriend and girlfriend. Everybody in town believes the boy Nicholas is as crazy as his grandfather(who is actually an angel who traded his immortality for a lady,Nicholas' grandmother) so after a bet made with Santa by the grandfather who was an angel at the time to make Santa be nice to kida for 1000 years and after the bet is up he can come
back and wreak havock on the town. So he comes to Hell
township to find the old man who he placed the bet with & his grandson Nicholas. So he starts the movie by executing an entire family,including Fran Drescher and Chris Kattan to name a few. He starts to go through the town 1 citizen at a time,the pastor in town is a sleeze who enjoys the stripclubs and he gets grabbed by Clause(Bill Goldberg) and he keeps knocking him out to keep him as the guy to put the blame on at the end. This is a comedy as well as a very unique spin on the story about Santaclaus & it is just good ol' fashion fun to watch. It has lots of unique ways of execution and lots of plot twists. I don't want to give the story away but the movie is pretty cool,it will be a definite favorite of yours. This is by far 1 of the most insane horror comedies ever. Set in Alaska it is so beautiful,there are a decent cast of actors and a really cool story. Check it out and enjoy.",1427760000,4,1642,4.150470219435737

2437684,3,B000BQ7J6Q,"Santa's Slay is yet another in a long tradition of crappy Christmas ""horror"" films. What sets this film apart, however, is that it is all too aware of its place in the ""Silent Night, Deadly Night"" pantheon, and so it is not so much trying to frighten as it is amuse. I would say it would have succeeded if it hadn't felt the need, now and then, to try to get weirdly schmaltzy.

According to the story, Santa is actually Satan's son, and after losing a bet (over curling, of all things) to an angel, he was forced to turn his yearly slaughterfest into a yearly festival of love and happiness and presents. This was to last a thousand years and -- uh oh! -- the time is up and Santa finally gets to return to his first love: killing people indiscriminately. What follows are a fairly clever string of PG13 deaths, a single blip of horror-audience-placating nudity, and more Christmas puns than you can shake a candy cane at. ""Christmas can scare the Dickens out of people!"" Santa growls right before hitting someone in the face with a hardcover copy of Dicken's A CHRISTMAS CAROL.

It's actually not bad, when all is said and done, and the appearance of more than a few fairly recognizable faces (foremost among them, the talented James Caan!) makes it even more enjoyable. However, our lead -- a sixteen year old boy named Nicolas (oh, the irony!) -- is played by a kid who appeared to have taken acting lessons from a soda machine at a two-year technical school. Even his yogurt-based emoting wouldn't be half-bad if the movie didn't feel the need to inject some kind of drama into the script, centering around his relationship with a blonde NRA-loving classmate (don't know her name; she played the Australian Claire on the TV show Lost). I can suspend my disbelief enough to imagine that Santa has a ""helldeer"" and even that, when people's heads are blown off, all that is left is a black, smoking, cartoon-style stump, but asking me to believe that a boy and girl running for their lives would take five minutes to make out when there is an evil hellbeast literally searching for them in the next room is annoying. Cheesy violence and horror is one thing; cheesy romance is another. They don't really mix very well.

Add in the fact that the plot -- which is actually fairly tightly crafted in the first half -- completely jumps the rails in the  last fifteen minutes. I know I'm harping on the logistics of a movie that claims Santa was created out of an evil entity losing a curling match, but still, there's gotta be some kind of logic to your movie unless you want to go full Monty Python with it, in which case, you should do that from the get-go. At any rate, the movie takes pains to establish a story and then throws it out the window in the last three scenes, as if the scriptwriters had completely forgotten what they were talking about.

If you stick this on at a tongue-in-cheek Christmas party, it'll probably do the trick. People will pay attention to the first half, and by the last half, they'll be so drunk and carefree that none of the plotholes and poor acting will matter. Sit down and try to give it a sober viewing from start to finish, though, and you'll probably not have as much fun.",1355702400,,3212,4.502572898799314

""Santa's Slay"" -- uh -- treats us to a revised origin story of Christmas and Santa Claus, which I won't spoil. It's shown in stop-motion animation, an obvious poke at the Rankin/Bass holiday films.

At 77 minutes, it's no longer than it needs to be, and we have the pleasure of seeing the still-missed Robert Culp in one of his last roles. A number of ""good"" actors, who really shouldn't be slumming in a film like this, make cameo appearances, especially Saul Rubinek, who played Daphne's boyfriend in ""Frasier"".

My only real complaints are that the violence seems nastier than necessary (a matter of opinion, of course) -- with Dave Thomas impaled Kenny-like on a flag pole -- and the foul language is largely gratuitous. The supplemental material is generous for such a film.

If you have the stomach for it, ""Santa's Slay"" is clever and well-done, better than the brainless exploitation flick it might have been. (Bill Goldberg's Saint Nicholas costume is magnificent.) Yule probably like it.",1293235200,,1204,4.945544554455446

To her surprise there was a lot more then just presents in that Christmas stocking as a crazed bearded elf popped out yelling ""meeeeeeee!"" As he chased her with all his might finally his hard work had paid off once he corned her by the dining room table taking out the pink turnkey baster Santa had left. Ahh the holidays just bring out the best in Sid, which is why we wanted to share a portion of our favorite Christmas tale in this annual holiday review. With another Christmas upon us we naturally had to thrown in some Christmas B of the horror variety for the second straight year. Last year we chose&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christmas-Evil/dp/B000IJ7A60/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christmas Evil</a>&nbsp;in a tough debate forcing Santa's Slay to be done in 2010. Much like last year the brother's Sid were not let down by Goldberg playing the evil version of old Saint Nick.

Going into Santa's Slay one must have an open mind to the fact your dealing with a comedy B horror much like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jack-Frost/dp/B00008AOVG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jack Frost</a>. It's a genre not meant for just anyone. The film opens with Santa bursting through the chimney into James Cann's family Christmas by demolishing everyone at the table. From there he hops on his steroid injecting reindeer and heads for a little quit town known as Hell Township. In between hammer curls and shoulder presses Santa simply kills everyone he can leaving resident Nick Yuleson and his lady friend on a quest for the truth. Turns out Santa is really a demon that lost a bet to an Angel forcing him to play Santa for 1000 years. Year after year he played nice until now. With the final year coming to a close he decides to make up for all the lost killing he missed out on.

For us Santa's Slay worked very well for a nice B horror Christmas entry. Most would be let down if thinking it's a straight up horror because there's not a scare in sight. It's a total goofball flick that will be loved by the right audience. Goldberg did a solid job playing a roided up Kris Kringle not straying far from a roided up wrestling character. It's non-stop one liners and a whole lot of a** kicking for the Hell Township. Possibly our favorite part was when Santa raids a strip club all killing all the old Farve jersey wearing perverts in hilarious fashion. That portion just seem to hit home for some obvious reasons. So on that note Sid wishes you to get wiched haaaaaard, since you were a bad girl and you deserve it.",1292630400,2,2770,4.94206008583691

2437696,4,B000BQ7J6Q,"I went into this little film with an odd mix of apprehensions.

It was produced by Brett Ratner, whom I've enjoyed a lot of his films, yet starred former pro wrestler Goldberg...a jumbled bag, indeed.

From the opening scene, however, I was hooked...we go from a cookie-cutter Christmas movie beginning (""Family Around The Table For Christmas Dinner"") into a twisted, hilarious, and darkly satisfying realm that lets you know in no uncertain terms that this ain't ""Miracle on 34th Street"".  If you flipped this on a television channel and came in at this beginning, I think you'd be floored...you have a cast of known and famous actors around that table, and it looks for all the world like a made-for-tv Christmas film kicking up, until Santa appears and everything takes a turn for the surreal.

Moving through the flick, you run into several scenes that really don't make sense plot-wise, but you just HAD to have them in any film about a Santa Claus with an evil bent...the main plotline is actually well-thought out without tripping over itself, and it's told in a flashback using stop-motion puppetry that we're all used to from Christmas classics; a stroke of genius.  The ironies and in-jokes abound, and it's worth watching more than once to catch what you missed the first time around.

I have to say I was pleasantly shocked by this one; the production values were far higher than I expected, the cast was excellent (the lead was really the only complete unknown in a starring role, and he acquitted himself nicely), and the story itself was far superior to what I was expecting.

""Santa's Slay"" isn't going to be put in there with the typical holiday horror fare with ""Black Christmas"" or ""Silent Night, Deadly Night"", but instead I think it's in a class by itself; kind of a ""Return of the Living Dead"" of Christmas horror.

2437698,4,B000BQ7J6Q,"I don't know what it is about Christmas and horror, but it's amazing how the two fit together so well.  I've enjoyed many a gruesome Christmas-based horror movie in my time, and Santa's Slay definitely makes my list of favorites.  No doubt we've all noticed at some point that Santa is spelled with the same letters as Satan.  That can't be a coincidence, can it?  What do we really know about this Santa guy?  We know the man works one frickin' day a year - that can't be on the level.  He almost has to run his whole elf-based enterprise as some kind of sweat shop in order to turn out so many toys every year.  Nobody in his right mind would live in such an extreme environment as the North Pole unless he has something to hide.  During those months without sunlight, the man has to watch every step he makes to avoid stepping in reindeer patties or little elves, and you know he has to get tired of 364 days straight of Mrs. Claus.  Oh, he says it's all for the good little boys and girls all over the world, but what if that isn't true?  What if Santa actually hates little kids?  Can you imagine how much rage such a man would have built up inside after all these years?

In this dark twist on the Santa legend, old St. Nick is actually the son of Satan who lost a bet to an angel.  As the loser, he was compelled to spend one thousand years spreading joy to the hearts of boys and girls all over the world.  He hated every minute of it, but now those thousand years have passed and Santa is finally free to unleash his true evil nature.  Eschewing the traditional eight reindeer for a single evil ""helldeer,"" he guides his sleigh to Hell Township and starts laying the smacketh down all over town.  This ain't your traditional fat old Santa; this dude is as big and bad as they come.  This is a man who took the world of professional wrestling by storm in the late 1990s, a man I watched lay out Hulk Hogan with his patented Jackhammer finishing move to win the WCW Heavyweight Championship in what has to be my greatest wrestling memory of all time.  If you had told me back then that Goldberg would one day play Santa Claus in a movie, I would have questioned your mental capacity.  As it turns out, though, the filmmakers couldn't have chosen a better actor for this part.  While there is definitely a lot of comedy to enjoy alongside all of the killing in Santa's Slay, Bill Goldberg never goes too far over the top, even when he's dishing out ironic Christmas clichs to his victims (and, of course, he's a natural at throwing people around like ragdolls).

The film gets off to a rousing start, as Santa takes out an entire star-studded, highly dysfunctional family.  I can see taking out the likes of Fran Drescher and Chris Kattan - but Rebecca Gayheart?  Come on, man!  You know this guy's pure evil right from the start.  And this little mass slaughter is only the beginning, as Santa basically goes through town killing people in all sorts of ways.  It's amazing how many Christmas decorations can be used as implements of death.  The only hope of putting an end to his rampage (which, oddly enough given all of the dead bodies stacking up, no one else in town seems to notice) seems to lie with teenaged Nicolas Yuleson (Douglas Smith), his exceedingly cute friend Mary (Emilie de Ravin), and his crazy old grandpa (Robert Culp).  It turns out that there's a lot about Grandpa that Nicolas could never have imagined.

With its great mix of murderous mayhem and comedy, Santa's Slay makes for a wickedly entertaining little movie.  Some of the sleigh-flying scenes feature some of the worst special effects I've seen in a long time, but those brief moments really take nothing away from all of the things the movie does quite well.  The entire cast is great, the funny lines in the script are actually funny, and the pacing is spot on.  It does have a rather short runtime of 78 minutes, but it's also the kind of ""tell your friends"" movie you'll want to watch more than once.",1263340800,3,3993,4.427397260273972

I'm used to seeing Goldberg toss guys around, but this suit on him really threw me off and I wasn't sure who I was watching. I kept saying its Santa, but Santa was just really ugly. He looked more like a biker who dresses up as Santa for the neighborhood kids during the summer.

To be honest with you, after the opening credits I fast-forwarded through most of this movie. I think I was just tired and had a headache, but I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Some of the kills were very creative, and the reason I gave this more than 1 star. But I couldn't bear to watch the rest of it at normal speed.

2437703,4,B000BQ7J6Q,"As the title implies, SANTA'S SLAY is a slasher movie that is set during the Christmas season. But unlike many Yuletide horror flicks, the murderer in this film isn't some refugee from the nuthouse dressed in Santa garb. No, the killing Kris Kringle in this film is, in fact, ol' St. Nick himself.  Turns out that Santa is actually the son of the Devil, and the only reason he's been delivering holiday cheer to millions of children during the past 1000 years or so is because he lost a bet with a Heavenly angel.  Well, now the debt is finally paid in full, and this Christmas the not-so-jolly Santa is free to deck the halls with bowels and folly as he spreads a ton o' holiday fear.

Although the film is as hilarious as it is gory, there are two standout scenes that alone make the film worth watching.  In the opening scene, James Caan (1990's MISERY), Fran Drescher (television's THE NANNY), Chris Kattan (television's SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE), and Rebecca Gayheart (1998's URBAN LEGEND) cameo as a wealthy but dysfunctional family whose Christmas party is crashed by the now murderous Santa.  It is impossible not to laugh as Caan gets shish-kebabed, Drescher is roasted with an open fire before getting her egg nogged, Kattan gets the boot, and Gayheart is beaned with a Yuletide log.  And during a scene that reveals the details behind the pivotal bet between Santa and the angel, puppet-like animation turns what would normally be boring exposition into an unforgettably hilarious send-up of those saccharine Rankin/Bass stop-motion holiday programs that annually grace the boob tube.

As the ferocious Father Christmas, hulking pro-football-player-turned-wrestler Bill Goldberg delivers a deliciously over-the-top performance, and the venerable Robert Culp--co-star of the classic seriocomic TV series I SPY--is perfectly cast as Santa's angelic rival.  SANTA'S SLAY also co-stars Emilie de Ravin, who is better known for her role as Claire Littleton on TV's LOST; respected character actor Saul Rubinek, appearing here as a Jewish deli owner who learns to believe in Santa Claus...the hard way, of course; and popular Canadian comedy actor Dave Thomas.

The DVD from Lions Gate presents SANTA'S SLAY in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1 (enhanced for widescreen TVs), and the digital transfer and 5.1 Surround Sound are excellent. Bonus features include an informative feature-length commentary with the filmmakers, deleted scenes, a short making-of featurette, and a couple of cool Easter Eggs.

Yes, SANTA'S SLAY is frequently corny, sometimes bloody, and often outrageously over the top, but the film is always hilarious and never boring.  The clever script avoids the cliches of other holiday horror flicks and never forgets that it's all meant to be played with tongue planted firmly in cheek.

He's really the son of Satan. The only reason that he's been acting so nice all of these years is because he lost a bet to an angel 1000 years ago, requiring him to be the person we all know and love for the next 1000 years. However, the 1000 years is now up and Santa has a lot of evil to catch up with. The only thing that can stop Santa are two teenagers and the grandfather of one of the teenagers. Sound like fun? It is.

The whole premise of this film is just an excuse for 80 minutes of gratuitous violence involving Santa (who is played by wrestler, Bill Goldburg). Come on, admit it, haven't you ever wanted to see Santa walk into a bar and kill everyone in sight, just for the hell of it?

It says that Brett Ratner directed this film but I cant tell if its the Ratner who made big Hollywood movies or a guy with the same name. I checked The Internet Movie Database but it gave little info about the movie. It starts off by killing some C list celebritys and then ensues a funny moment with a old woman in a deli.

2437720,4,B000BQ7J6Q,"It turns out there were 2 Immaculate Conceptions: One was Jesus and one was Santa Claus. One day, Santa loses a bet with an angel and must play nice for 1000 years (this part was told in stop motion animation). Well, his punishment is up and he's here to wreck havoc. Only an old inventor, his grandson ""Nicholas Yuleson"", and girlfriend ""Mary"" (played by Emilie de Ravin) can stop him.

This film takes a fun look at the Holidays with the blackest of black humor. It opens with Chris Kattan, Rebecca Gayheart, Fran Drescher, and James Caan getting slaughtered by Santa. There are countless of other cameos strewn throughout the movie. Oh, and did I mention that WWE wrestler Bill Goldberg is playing Santa and doing his own stunts? And that Brett Ratner (Rush Hour 1-3, X-Men 3) produced this?

There is much fun to be had here such as Santa beating up Christmas Carolers, kids running from Santa on snow mobiles, and a Jew holding up the Star of David to Santa (similar to a cross to a Vampire) in hopes his faith would save him. You will see a candy cane in the eye, a Christmas star in the back, Santa's sleigh getting valet parking, and some Ho-Ho-Hoes in stripper attire.

The production values were very high and it looks as though it was shot on 35mm. They had great props like a Santa's Slay driven by a yak/ buffalo (?). The sound varied a bit during dialogue-heavy and action-heavy scenes, which caused me to raise and then lower the volume a few times.

I only have two minor gripes. While there is a high body count, they skimp on the gore. The film overall is more comedic than scary, so Gorehounds will not be as amused.

Another thing was girlfriend Mary's personality inconsistencies. (Yes, I pay attention to character development even in horror films). They show her as a strong woman driving a big truck, shooting guns, and putting her boyfriend's hands on her breasts. But once Santa arrives, she can only whine about how scared she is. She even pulls out the Stupid Card by stopping dead in her tracks while in the middle of a getaway to talk to her boyfriend about her feelings.

Favorite Quote: A few good ones, but my favorite was when Nicholas shines a flashlight in Santa's eyes temporarily blinding him and Santa yells, ""I'm Santa Claus, not f*cking Dracula!""

DVD Extras: Scene Selection, Audio Set Up, Deleted Scenes, Casting, ""Taking the Reins"" (Steiman's First Film), 2 Easter Eggs (one features 6 trailers), and of course Commentary with the Director and Producer. This explained how Goldberg met his wife. She was a stunt double for the trapeze stripper in pasties whose crotch his face was buried in for 4 days. Duh. How else would they have fallen in love?

Bottom Line: Good for some laughs, but minimal gores/sex. Best viewing with friends and beer.

Rating: 7/10

This is one of the most awsome holiday movies since ""Nightmare Before Christmas""! While being a low budget flick it keeps you laughing and leaves you wanting more - SEQUAL! SEQUAL! Santa Slay II!!

This movie brings new light the age old story that Santa and Satan are indeed both one in the same...don't belive me? Well lets just examine the facts for a moment:

1) Both consider ""red"" as their favorite color.

2) Both choose to work at night.

3) Both have children as a target audience.

4) Both have that ""something for nothing"" idea. (gifts, power, etc)

5) Both live in secluded areas.

6) Both have little minions that do all the work.

7) Both know when you are sleeping/awake and good/bad.

8) Both use fire (or a place thereof) as a chosen entry/communication point.

i couldn't believe they got Goldberg to play this role, but i am glad they did. not many people could have made this movie work the way he did. there was enough surprisingly original killings to make this stand out from the rest. Santa's slay is a really nice departure from the average crappy boring Christmas comedy (any one of Tim Allen's retarded movies) and i was happy that i could actually let others watch this with the same enjoyment value as i got out of it.

there was even a nice little background story to why Santa was the way he was. any sort of cheesy plot possibilities were met with undercutting comic relief and that is why i cannot call this a horror movie. i recommend this to anyone who has a general dislike (or even hatred) for the other 95% of Christmas movies (Except Scrooged with Bill Murray, i liked that one).

2437728,4,B000BQ7J6Q,"""Santa's Slay"" is a very dark and wildly funny evil Santa film.  In the film Santa was actually the son of Satan, who made a bet with an angel over a game of curling.  If he lost the bet, Santa would have to be good for 1000 years, and if he won the bet the angel would have to go to hell.  Santa lost, and had to spend 1000 years being sweet and jolly...  Fast forward to 2005 when the 1000 years are up and Santa reverts back to his original hate-filled self and goes on a killing spree in the town of Hell's Corner.  It's shocking and ridiculous and so-so funny.  In the opening scene Santa kills Fran Drescher and James Caan; it was such a surprise to see them in this ""B""-type film, and then see them get whacked in hysterically gruesome fashion.  The angel is played by Robert Culp, and Santa is played by WWW wrestler Goldberg, and is really buff.  He rides in a sleigh pulled by a giant musk ox.  Hah! (""...He's not just scary; he's educational..."")Very much worth a view... but not for the little kiddies.

Someone else had mentioned ""Jack Frost"", and if you can get a copy of that one watch it, too.  (Not the schmalzty one with Michael Keaton, but the horror version.)  Best scene in that one: when the humans are trying melt Jack, a murderer-infused snowman, with blow dryers.

It's violent, cheesy, and just plain fun.  Who doesn't want to see Goldberg as Santa kill Chris Kattan?  Or how about all the great one-liners?  For me, what separates this movie from just regular B movie horror trash is its self-consciousness and the effort the writers put into the story.  It's not just your run of the mill slasher flick, they actually rewrote the history of Santa Claus and created their own myth.  And it works, for the most part.  The first half is much more entertaining then the second half.

2437733,4,B000BQ7J6Q,"I'm not a huge fan of slasher films.  There are some good ones, sure, but for the most part, they are predictable, unremarkable, and often just plain stupid.  Which is why Santa's Slay was such a pleasant surprise.

The idea:  Santa's really evil and has only been good because of a bet he lost with an angel.  Now, the wager is over, and he gets to be bad again.  The film works because it pretty much runs with this concept without apology.  Also, it's got a lot of energy.  Santa's Slay is rarely boring.

The opening is the best part.  We get to see a list of recognizable actors sitting down to dinner.  Then Santa comes in and kills them all.  It's graphic enough to deter sensitive viewers, but nothing too gruesome.  From there, the movie barrels along to a satisfying conclusion.

My only complaint about Santa's Slay is that the last half is just not as good as the first.  Still, it's an enjoyable ride.  Plus, it's nice to see a film that doesn't mind pandering with a superfluous strip bar scene filled with topless babes.

For another great killer holiday film, I recommend ""Jack Frost"" and ""Jack Frost 2"" about a psychotic snowman.  Like Santa's Slay, it's equal parts silly and gruesome, but somehow the combination works.",1140393600,,1238,4.575342465753424

The result of this paring? Something that is about as appealing as rotten limburger cheese that's been left out in the sun for a few weeks.

The story is another take on Santa Claus. This Santa is an evil, murdering monster, bent on killing everyone. The murders themselves are filled with more bad one liners than a kindergartener's comedy routine, and the fact that Goldberg is the one delivering them doesn't help matters.

Most of all, the biggest problem is that this movie is TRYING to be over the top funny, but it's so low budget it can't quite get there. Yet, the fact it's trying to be funny ruins its kitsch value. Also, fans of Goldberg may or may not like this. It's not his best work.

Over all, there's a lot of better Christmas movies out there, and there's a lot better horror movies out there. This is just in the middle of everything, and that just makes it mediocre.
