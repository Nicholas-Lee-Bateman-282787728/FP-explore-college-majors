173764,5,0971744319,"I've been a member of the Mormon church for over 40 years and a researcher church history for more than a decade.  I can certainly understand the defensive reactions of members of the LDS church toward ""The Lost Book of Abraham: Investigating a Remarkable Mormon Claim"" DVD since it denounces long held beliefs about this book of LDS scripture contained in the Pearl of Great Price.

The information presented in this DVD is quite accurate, however.  Some of the statements and claims are a little biased, but as a whole, the presentation is good.  After years of studying the issues related to the Book of Abraham, I have firmly concluded that the text of this book did not come literally from the papyrus from which it was supposedly translated.  To me, that is absolute.

There are at least three theories how Joseph Smith may have obtained the ""Abraham"" information.  1) Hidden within the text are ""secret"" meanings that Smith, himself, was able to discern by the power of God.  2) The papyrus was a ""springboard"" for God to reveal to him about Abraham even though the papyrus itself was completely non-related.  3) Joseph Smith made it up.

I am not going to declare which of those three possibilities I currently believe.  However, as a member of the LDS church, I will declare that I know beyond any doubt that the ""old"" belief that the Book of Abraham was a literal translation from the papyrus is not accurate.  The church knows this and most LDS scholars accept and promote one of the other alternate theories.  There are many LDS sites that will go into great detail about these alternate theories.

When current members of the LDS church are first presented with this ""new"" information that the BOA is not a literal translation, the negative hostile reactions are understandable.  They will write scathing reviews and try to defend the traditional belief.  As you read the reviews on this DVD, you will notice that the ""1 star"" reviews reflect this very defensive position.

However, as members of the LDS church investigate and research the actual findings of the BOA (as I did), they will come to know that the text of this book came from means other than a literal translation of papyrus.",1126396800,60,2203,4.755263157894737

This video does not seem ""anti-Mormon"" to me, just factual.

I did not enjoy the recreation of 1840 scenes.  The filming did not seem to match the times.  I think it would have been more interesting just to have pictures of the 1840 era used in the film with maybe a Ken Burns type of effect.

If the Egyptian-studies scholars had been interviewed, the 1840 pictures used, I would have found it more interesting.  the scenes recreating the times just seemed too bright, the actors seemed too modern.  Just not as believable as other films depicting that era.

BUT...that is not to say the film is not interesting.  It is.  And the facts speak for themselves.  Another interesting book: You may wish to read By His Own Hand Upon Papyrus.

If you are LDS, you may find a good rebuttal to this film by searching for publications from FARMS (at BYU).",1123459200,11,952,4.535294117647059
173767,5,0971744319,I teach Egyptology and no self-respecting Egyptologist would agree with the Mormon claim about the Book of Abraham.

That's why reason doesn't always do the job.  It's unreasonable that Christ was resurrected, it's unreasonable that Moses parted the red sea.  It's unreasonable that the world was created by a god.  It's unreasonable that we go anywhere after death.  There's no proof of any of it, and therefore it's open to debate and vulnerable to attack.  Anyone could take the Book of Abraham, or the Bible or the Koran and ""disprove"" it's origins or it's meaning.  For that matter philosophers and physicists are constantly ""disproving"" subject matters, and theorems.  But does that necessarily make them untrue?

This movie does a good job of what it was designed for, but it doesn't change my feelings on the matter.  The only thing that could do that is myself.",1097539200,18,817,4.8478260869565215

This video isn't a documentary by qualified professionals despite the format it's presented in.  I've been creating my own DVD's for years and could come up with something like this and not be factual.  A reviewer here wrote the following:
'I find it amazing that a church that refers to potential new converts as ""investigators"" insists that people stop investigating as soon as they hit the baptismal water.'

(Both of which are all about Jesus Christ, the Lord).  Read those, pray about those, and don't be blown about by every wind of false doctrine because you will know with Jesus Christ as the rock you build on.",1070668800,24,597,4.458715596330276
173776,5,0971744319,"Produced in a History Channel format, this video is excellent because it relies on factual history to report the events that led to the publication of the Book of Abraham in the LDS scripture Pearl of Great Price. The question is this: If Joseph Smith was truly a prophet of God, and if he accurately translated the Book of Mormon plates into English, then shouldn't he have had the ability to take the writing of the patriarch Abraham and accurately translate it into English as well? However, as the video points out, the Book of Abraham is nothing more than common funeral papyrii that was sold to Smith by a traveling salesman. With the science of Egyptology in its infancy at that time, Smith was able to convince his people that this papyrus had been produced by Abraham himself. Although the scroll was lost for a century, it was uncovered in the 1960s and given back to the LDS Church. For the first time, this papyrus could be studied in light of the abundance of work that had been done in the field of Egyptology. In effect, the truth about Joseph Smith has been revealed.
All in all, this video is interesting to watch and accurate in its analysis. Although it may cause some honest Latter-day Saints some sleepness nights, grabbing ahold of truth is the most important thing anyone can do. I challenge every Latter-day Saint to see this video for him/herself and then weigh the evidence. If Mormonism is true, then it ought to stand the test.",1064880000,72,1455,4.621621621621622
173777,4,0971744319,"I find it amazing that a church that refers to potential new converts as ""investigators"" insists that people stop investigating as soon as they hit the baptismal water. The children in Primary sing the song ""Search, ponder and pray"" but apparently only about Church approved materials. The details behind the so-called  ""Book of Abraham"" are fundamental in mormon beliefs. When viewed through mormon colored glasses, the ""Book of Abraham"" is yet another example of the prophetic calling of Joseph Smith. When approached from outside the fold, it can be seen as yet another example of a master [cheat]artist getting himself deeper into his lies. The mormon church spends millions on self-promoting videos designed to lure unsuspecting Christians and unchurched folks into their church. Yet dare raise questions about the authenticity of mormon writings and you get labeled with the same broad brush of ""anti-mormon"". If there is nothing to hide, this video should be informative anyway. If there is something to hide (and there certainly is from the mormon hierarchies perspective), anyone who testifies on the first Sunday of the month that they know Joseph Smith was a prophet owes it to themselves to see what sort of ""prophet"" he really was. The video itself lacks some of the slick marketing of mormon published works, but like many books that call mormonism out the material is more important than the package. If you are witnessing to mormons, you are more likely to get them to sit down and watch this video than to read a lengthy book on the topic. Makes an excellent gift for mormon friends and family, or to have handy when missionaries stop by and want to watch a mormon video with you.",1047254400,35,1697,4.933566433566433
173778,1,0971744319,"Upon seeing an advertisement claiming that this video is a ""fair and balanced documentary"", I became very interested and immediately began to investigate. The Institute of Religious Research? I had never heard of them. Are they really fair and balanced as they claim? My first stop was to look at the experts interviewed in the film. There I found Protestant Seminary professors, including Craig Blomberg of the Denver Seminary who along with Stephen Robinson of BYU wrote How Great the Divide. That's okay, but where was the balance? Where were the BYU and FARMS scholars? Where were Daniel Peterson, Hugh Nibley, and other renowned LDS scholars such as Richard Bushman of Columbia University? There were not there? Rather, those supposedly presenting the ""balance"" were former LDS Church employees, former BYU Professors, and former Utahns. The most glaring omission was Stephen Robinson. Why was Craig Blomberg appearing and not Stephen Robinson? I then followed the provided link to ""find out more about the Book of Abraham"". I assumed that the link would take me to the LDS church's website where the actual text of the Book of Abraham is available. Oh contraire, the link instead took me to a site called Mormons in Transition (definitely no balance found there).  I then went to the Institute of Religious Research own web site to see what other publications they provided. No surprise this time. There was an arsenal of anti-Mormon books, pamphlets, and videos. The cat was now out of the bag. This is just another anti-Mormon production masquerading as a documentary. As with other anti-Mormon productions, the producers do their best to get the viewer to believe that the LDS view is being presented (the former employees and former BYU professors, and yes, even former Utahns are supposed to have some degree of credibility) when it really isn't. With the same tired, old scurrilous tactics employed here, this film can hardly be classified as a documentary of any sort.

UPDATE: I completely forgot about this DVD and the review I had written until I happened to hit the SEE ALL MY REVIEWS button (being very busy I rarely take the time to write a review). I laughed when I came back here to see that this snake oil was no longer being manufactured. People are not stupid. They can see when something is not what it claims to be. This pile of junk was nothing but Anti-Mormon propaganda doing its best to disguise itself as a documentary. It is good to see it gone. Rest in peace.

UPDATE: I have not thought to come back here in ages. I forgot all about it but I happened to stumble back here and sure enough I see some responses to my comment. Those of you who are sincere seekers of truth will want to see the following analysis of the Book of Abraham by an actual professional Egyptologist who holds an actual Ph. D. in Egyptology from an actual university (UCLA).&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Understanding-the-Book-of-Abraham/dp/1621084833/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Understanding the Book of Abraham</a>",1035072000,59,3068,5.083333333333333

I found it most interesting that, although several were invited, LDS authorities refused to be interviewed for the video.

I can't recommend this video enough!  Even those unfamiliar with the LDS Church would find this video informative and interesting.  I will be using it quite a bit as a ""teaching tool"" for both non-LDS and LDS friends and family.

The two young LDS women interviewed in this DVD talk confidently about the importance of personally investigating those claims. What I discovered in 10 years of active LDS membership is that the Mormon definition of investigation only includes approved, sanitized sources. Mormons are trained from an early age to automatically dismiss ""critics"" as a personal act of faithfulness. This aversion to intellectual scrutiny on matters of Mormon faith is not surprising. The more you honestly study the lives of LDS founders such as Joseph Smith, the more you discover credibility questions that cut to the core of Mormon faith. This film looks at Smith's life during the Kirtland-Nauvoo period, when he produced and promoted the Book of Abraham as inspired scripture. The film suggests Smith lied repeatedly about his ability to ""translate"" ancient writings, and that his church today deliberately ignores the obvious implications. Sadly, well-intentioned Mormons nowadays who think they have to ""follow the prophet"" to follow Jesus, will probably automatically turn a blind eye again.",1034294400,67,1264,5.35678391959799

Is not the greatest gift from God to his children, the human race, the gift of choice and the gift of living with the consequences of that choice.

I am sceptical of any review the focuses on distorting my choices through distortion, extortion, missing facts, out of context quotes, biased oppinion or otherwise dishonestly portraying the belief of others. With such animosity between the sect of Christianity, it is no wonder so many leave it for Islam, Budhism, or any number of other belief or non belief systems throughout the world.

The Church which this film (The Lost Book of Abraham)seeks to discredit is far from hiding its past. If fact as one investigates, there are remarkable resources available.

The quest of any spiritually inclined person, and I believe we all to some degree fall into this category, is to find answers to the questions of the soul; Where are my origins (am I just a biological accident), Why am I here (eat, drink and be merry or be of service to self and fellow traveller on this great journey) and what is to become of me (is this all there is?)?

Truth reveals itself to me as I study a broad spectrum of literature, both inspired and otherwise. It seems to my advantage to collect the greatest number of answers and solutions to lifes quests from any source that the Spirit of Christ (perhaps also known as consience)leads me. I don't have to trash another persons beliefs in order to draw closer to my Heavenly Father. In fact I have found that when I let myself be drawn into such, the light recedes, the consequence of a bad choice.

7794412,5,0971744319,"This is an excellent documentary that displays a laudable respect for the Mormon faith even as it authoritatively puts the lie to Joseph Smith's translation of ""The Lost Book of Abraham.""  It may appear biased to some, but the relatively one-sided nature of the presentation is largely due to the fact that no Mormon scholars or church leaders would agree to even a mere interview on the subject.  That being the case, the producers went out of their way to ask a number of LDS members their opinions on the Book of Abraham.  That, to my mind, makes this documentary is as fair and balanced as it could possibly be.  While the presented findings raise crucial questions about the very foundations of the church Joseph Smith founded, the presentation never turns into an attack on the LDS faith itself.

The more I learn about the Mormons, and Joseph Smith in particular, the more fascinated I become with the whole subject.  As an outside Christian looking in to the facts of the LDS Church, I am continually amazed that this religion survived the assassination of its prophet, Joseph Smith, as it has much in the nature of a cult of personality.  Even today, though, Mormonism is inextricably linked with its controversial founder.  If Smith's claims are untrue, the church has no legs to stand upon.  That is what makes this analysis of Smith's ""The Book of Abraham"" so intriguing.  Smith's ""translation"" of the Book of Mormon, while highly dubious, cannot be tested because the gold plates containing the original text were supposedly returned to the angel Moroni - and thus cannot be tested.  The same cannot be said of the Book of Abraham, as the original source - long thought to have been destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 - is extant.  Authorities within the LDS church probably wish otherwise, as the true meaning of those documents greatly undermines Joseph Smith's integrity and has forced the church to backpedal mightily in the face of academic scrutiny.

When a traveling salesman came through Kirtland, Ohio peddling several papyri from ancient Egypt (along with several authentic mummies), Joseph Smith could hardly dispute his ability to translate the ancient Egyptian writings (despite the fact that no scholar on the American continent could have done so at that time) - not after having translated the Book of Mormon from the ""Reformed Egyptian"" language.  Scrounging together the $2400 needed to purchase the salesman's ancient wares, he diligently went about said translation.  According to him, these papyri contained a lost book of wisdom written by the very hand of Abraham himself during his time in Egypt.  The Book of Abraham soon became a work of great importance in the Mormon religion and has remained so to this day.

Smith's translation, particularly in terms of the copies of three plates included in The Book of Abraham, was called into question as soon as Egyptologists possessed the knowledge necessary for accurately interpreting the ancient hieroglyphics.  Now, numerous experts have had an opportunity to study the ancient fragments, and you'll hear from many of them in this documentary.  Smith's translation appears quite laughable and obviously wrong in just about every way possible according to all these experts.  The papyri contain fairly common funerary odes and have nothing whatsoever to do with Abraham.  The truth has compelled some LDS members to leave the church (you'll meet one in this documentary), and no Mormon leader would even agree to appear in this evenhanded presentation of fact.

There can be no question that this is an informative, very professional documentary which concentrates on the establishment of truth rather than a de facto attack on the Mormon religion.  The fact that no authority in the LDS Church would agree to defend Smith's translation speaks volumes as to the scholarly import of the transportation.",1193184000,10,3895,5.042121684867395
