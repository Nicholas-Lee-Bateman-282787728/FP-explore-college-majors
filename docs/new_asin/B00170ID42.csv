Nice too to see stuntman Yakima Canutt, a little piece of history. Years ago now, when I was a boy growing up in and just after the second world war my great joy was to go to "" Saturday morning flicks "". This film is of that ilk. A beginning, a middle, and an end. Good guys, bad guys and a story easy to follow.
O.K. there is obviously not the slickness and special effects of 21st century cinema. Also I have seen better actors .Never mind. For those of us who like to take our pleasure simple this is a great hour, that moves at a good pace, and where, as they should, the good guys win. By the way the youngsters can watch it too.
