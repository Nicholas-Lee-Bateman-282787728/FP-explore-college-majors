7914970,5,B00001W9GQ,"""You're Under Arrest"" is completely unlike any other law enforcement anime series out there.  There's no gratuitous sex, little fan service, few high-speed car chases and lots of bureaucracy - and vehicle repair.  That said, why would anyone want to watch it?
Well, to begin with, it's utterly charming.  The series is light, funny and very brightly animated.  Just like in Fujishima Kosuke's other series to hit US shores, ""Oh My Goddess!"", ""You're Under Arrest"" is beautifully animated.  Fujishima does as much with color and light as most other Japanese animators do with earth tones and shadows.
The story is also fairly atypical.  It is equal parts light comedy, romance, vehicle envy and office politics.  What other anime cop show would use that blend?  The plots revolve around life in a police precinct, not (necessarily) chasing down criminals.  The criminals also aren't the usual type you'd expect either.  While not necessarily terribly realistic, it's also not your usual mix of drug dealers and militant murderers.
Also - and this may seem minor - my favorite reason for watching the series is the way it portrays Tokyo.  The animation and the style of the series shows more accurately what Tokyo is really like than any other anime series I've seen.  Tokyo is usually as clean, cramped and bright as they portray it in these four OVAs.
The entire OVA series is a gem and AnimEigo should be congratulated for putting it on one tape.  It's a better deal than much of what is out there today and certainly well worth the price.",977097600,,1540,4.854406130268199
7914971,5,B00001W9GQ,"Phew, I got hand it to Animeigo. Had they not released this title in one tape form, I was gonna start having second thoughts about buying this  series. Luckly after watching this tape, I am certain that even if I had  bought the tapes seperatly, I still don't think I would have been  disapointed.
The series doesnt take itself too seriously and has many  moments that have you thinking ""Is a trafic ticket worth all this  effort?"" But in all honesty, the whole premisis of ""making  mountains out of mole hills"" is what makes this series just so  interesting and entertaining. The character designs are extremely well done  and show the trade mark Fujishima pain staking detail that makes him my  favorite manga/anime artist of all time(so that scores big points with me).  The animation is very impressive(especially for an ova. Hell some anime  features aren't animated this well) and the music adds to the overal fun of  the series.
At its core, it is a series that is easy to swallow, easy to  follow, and hard not to like. And now that Animeigo has decided to release  the TV series. That in and of itself just makes watching this even more  nessary! Good stuff!",966729600,2,1167,4.624390243902439
7914972,5,B00001W9GQ,"Endearing story (broken up over four 28 minute episodes) about two smart and dedicated policewomen who develop a strong bond with one another. Beautifully drawn (the designs are from the creator of Oh! My Goddess) and  acted, there's plenty of humor and a surprisingly high amount of action  considering this is technically in the ""drama"" category (if you  like car chases, you'll be very happy) .
Mild language and no nudity  make it one of the rare animes not directly aimed at children, but suitable  for them.
As an extra, an informational sheet containing Japanese  culture notes, the lyrics of the opening and ending songs, and other  interesting tidbits is included in the box.
If you enjoy intelligent  characters and feel good story lines, you'll be very happy you purchased  this VHS.",963792000,4,794,4.954545454545454
7914973,4,B00001W9GQ,"Watch this Anime with your family. Police force fun with not one gun. Love and highspeed hijinx set the tone for this one with good dub if you want it that way. No street words no evil bad guys just good clean family fun.  ""Something for everyone a comedy tonight.""",962928000,,265,4.3
7914974,5,B00001W9GQ,"Take wonderful character designs (by Fujishima Kosuke, the man who created Ah! Megami-sama, or in the USA: Oh My Goddess).
Add two heroines, Natsumi and Miyuki, who are both clever, funny and fully clothed (an anime  rarity!).
Mix in engaging storytelling (the premise is two young ladies  partnering together as traffic cops); lots of humor; beautiful animation  (the main characters and autos are drawn extremely well); and, good voice  acting/subtitling (the subtitles are superb! they even include cultural  footnotes!).
The result? A fabulous feel-good, character driven, down to  earth anime - with car chases to boot!- that mostly everyone will enjoy!  (Warning: If you're looking for extra terrestrial mechas or demonic  wizards, look elsewhere.)
To make the deal even sweeter, the Criminally  Complete Collection features ALL FOUR OVA's at a super price (previously  each 28 minute episode was sold as a seperate volume). Also included are  liner notes, which despite being plainly printed, are very interesting  (tidbits about the show, a translation of the theme song).
This VHS is  definitely worth adding to your collection!",962928000,,1137,5.428571428571429
