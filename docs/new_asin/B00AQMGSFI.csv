8556457,5,B00AQMGSFI,I love the Ice Age movies. I had these 2 on DVD and was waiting for them to come out on 3D but since that is not going to happen got them on bluray. Why did they quit making 3D? I love 3D. I have 2 3D TVs and surround sounds just my luck 3 D didn't pan out. I'd kill to get Wall E in 3D how amazing that would be. Anyway product came in good shape and timely manner.,1438560000,,366,3.5308641975308643
