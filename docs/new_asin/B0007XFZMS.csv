Warner Bros announced the release of SuperFriends - The 2nd Season for May 24. These are all 16 episodes from the 1978 run of the show featuring Zan & Jayna: The Wonder Twins! This 2 disc set (365 mins) The release will sport a full frame (1.33:1) transfer, and English mono audio, with English, French and Spanish subtitles. Two bonus features were announced:

-Pajama-Rama: Super Friends Retrospective - A group of pop culture enthusiasts and fun celebrities share their memories of the world's greatest team of '70's super-heroes, The Super Friends!

-The Ballad of Zan & Jayna - A wild and wacky music video celebrating the Wonder Twins, and of course, their pet primate Gleek!

SHOW HISTORY:

1973 saw the original Superfriends show, featuring the heros followed by non-powered kids Wendy & Marvin, and their pet Wonderdog. There are not too many cartoons in that series, and they were repeated quite a bit on and off until 1977's All-New Superfirends Hour came along. That is the show where the tag-along teens were first replaced by the Wonder Twins, Zan & Jayna, and their space-monkey Gleek. In 1978, the show continued, retitled as simply Superfriends. That season is the one which aired the episodes announced today for DVD release. At the same time, Challenge of the Superfriends was running adjacent to this, featuring the episodes of the Justice League of America vs. The Legion of Doom. All 16 of *those* episodes are already on DVD in Challenge of the Superfriends - The 1st Season. Since they call that ""the first season"" and the new title ""the second season"", we honestly can't tell if Warner means to ignore the 1973 Wendy/Marvin/Wonderdog installments totally.

Zan, Jayna, & Gleek continued in 1979's World's Greatest Superfriends, with a few new episodes mixed with repeats of the older ones. 1980 saw more than 60 new shorts (under 10 minutes each in length) made featuring just the heroes, with no teenage sidekicks, and those were combined with old episodes into a new Superfriends Hour show. But then that show was shortened to a half-hour for 1981-83 and the show went under various names, accompanied by maybe about two dozen more new shorts...some of which were never aired in the original rotation, but which aired later in syndication. Then, in 1984, ABC wanted to revitalize the series, and that's when they did Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show, using the new DC Comics name from the action figure lineup that was being marketed at the time. The cartoons mainly featured the heroes from the toy line, so now Cyborg (from the ""Teen Titans"" comics) and Firestorm (from ""Firestorm: The Nuclear Man"") were on the team. There were only 15 episodes produced under that name, and then they finished up the SuperFriends' TV run with The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians. That 1985 show had more of the heroes who hadn't been seen the previous year, especially fan favorites who had mostly been missing since Challenge, like Flash, Green Lantern, and Hawkman. There were approximately 10 episodes of that show.",1110240000,157,3773,4.971473851030111

2248201,3,B0007XFZMS,"Like most of Warner's complication of the Super Friends series - terrible. The DVD authoring and restoration is much to be desired. I don't understand Warner. They have the opportunity to restore animated classics and yet alter the way it was originally broadcast for some reason, a reason that points to the ill-fated attempt to show how ""wonderful Warner is"" (they are not). I would have given this more stars if the presentation of the DVD was worth it.

The cartoons are OK and since Warner holds the rights for now this is the best you can get from the classic Super Friends series produced by the talented Hanna-Barbera. It does show how this show influenced many other contemporary programs such as the Justice League/Unlimited and even other offerings from Marvel, Family Guy and The Simpsons.

At the time this was made Superman was perceived to be the all-powerful untouchable hero who would be overcome by kryptonite and red sun energy while Wonder Woman and Batman would occasionally exert their full abilities depending on the writer of the story. Watching the story with one of these latter characters would beg the question, ""hang on, they CAN do this and this and yet are doing NOTHING, why?""",1440028800,,1208,4.859223300970874

2248224,5,B0007XFZMS,the quality of the DVDs that I purchased is great. the sound is a little low but the pictures are fine. I really like this version of superfriends because they always have interesting lessons and a lot of the episodes seem to have environmental themes. I didn't realize it was so old and all the characters basically sound like all of the Hanna Barbera characters of that time. but I love reliving my saturday morning childhood with the kids. the villains don't seem so scary as in some cartoons but it's probably better for kids over 5.,1414540800,,537,4.546391752577319

2248236,4,B0007XFZMS,"Back in the late 70's/early 80', there was no Marvel cinematic universe or DC films.  If you wanted to see your comic book heroes on a screen, you were limited to the Christopher Reeve Superman films and a handful of live action tv series.  The only other real outpost were the various incarnations of the Super Friends cartoons.  The Super Friends was Saturday morning fare targeted at children, and the simplicity of the show speaks to that, particularly when compared with most modern superhero cartoons.  The Super Friends are not edgy, conflicted heroes with a dark side, but are versions of some of DC's most popular characters, written and drawn to be as approachable as possible for any audience.
It has been said that the Super Friends are the Justice League in a form where instead of destroying the bad guy's doomsday device, they must trick said bad guy into destroying it himself.  This attitude is visible in most stories, as the Super Friends spend most of their adventures getting their butts kicked, becoming trapped in near impossible to overcome situations, and only just managing to overcome their foes with a desperate, last gasp plan.  Watching the Super Friends is watching familiar characters with their super powers on mute or low.
The animation of the Super Friends is not of the highest quality but is acceptable.  Those familiar with the Super Friends would agree that the animation in this edition is lower than the later 'Super Powers' team entries in the franchise.
This incarnation of the Super Friends is perhaps most effective when the episodes are structured around some sort of pre existing mythology or characters, ex. Sinbad.  A good example of this is the episode the 'Battle of the Gods,' where the Super Friends must face various creatures from Greek mythology.  Placing the Friends in the context of ready made settings and characters, with slight alterations, helps frame the episode stories and carry the plot.  Still, expect the Super Friends to lose, and lose again, for the first 2/3 of each story, only to overcome the odds near the end and just carry the day.  The Friends episodes seems to be more effective when the entire team is not featured and there are less characters that require filler dialogue.  Stories featuring, for example, a combination of Batman, the Twins, and Wonder Woman seems to get the job done better than the entire ensemble at once.
The lineup of the team is not the entire JLA, and is a smaller cast that the older 'Challenge of the Super Friends' series and the later 'Super Powers' lineup.  Superman and Batman are here of course, and Batman is written as a less powerful mirror of Superman.  Robin is included as Batman's sidekick and to be another 'skills and gadgets' only member of the team.  Aquaman serves as a blonde version of Superman and Batman.  Wonder Woman is a female presence on the team.  This version of Wonder Woman is not as strong or confident as later animated versions.  This later approach to the Amazon princess is hinted at a bit in the 'Battle of the Gods' episode, another reason the episode seems to be the gem of the collection.
The presence of the Wonder Twins and Gleek is to add a bit of comedy to each episode and serves to cement the show's 'just for kids' status.  Super Friends fans have a range of opinions on the twins from Exor and their simian sidekick, and those do not need to be rehashed here.  However, in finding similar types of characters in other cartoons from the period, one wonders why producers did not trust their audiences more, and not realizing that kids would rather have more screen time for Batman and Superman as opposed to scenes featuring more Zan and Jayna.  This type of plot device appears to have worked itself out of modern cartoons, as creators seem willing to trust their audience to enjoy the show without trying to force laughs using 'created for the show' sidekicks.
Overall, this is a nice purchase for those of us who grew up with the series",1401321600,,3993,4.749638205499276
2248237,5,B0007XFZMS,"I'd forgotten that along with the Legion Of Doom episodes, there were a set featuring the Super Friends as we were used to seeing them, with the Wondertwins in full length adventures. Having seen a lot of the classic episodes recently, I'd been looking for the one where the Wondertwins returned to their home planet, and was pleased to find it in this compilation.

2248244,5,B0007XFZMS,"These DVDs have seen very heavy play the past several months. They were my 4-year-old son's introduction to the Super Friends and there's been no turning back. Since he started watching these we play Super Friends every day with little figures and the Bat Cave and he's convinced he wants to be Batman when he grows up.

As to the episodes, these are the hour-long ones with Wendy, Marvin, and Wonder Dog. I prefer these to the Wonder Twin episodes in later seasons, which include four shorter stories in each episode and seem less well-written. (We got one volume from each season.) I watched both when I was a kid and had fond memories of them, which is why I figured my son would like them.",1394582400,,693,4.5
2248245,5,B0007XFZMS,I read reviews saying this DVD title was corny because of the secondary Marvin & Wendy characters.

2248253,5,B0007XFZMS,Always wanted to acquire this entire collection. I've had many good memories watching the SuperFriends.  I cannot wait to watch these again,1374451200,,139,5.318181818181818
2248254,4,B0007XFZMS,"I love how I can relive my childhood by watching these old cartoons that used to air on Saturday mornings. Man, those were some good times. Waking up early in the morning before the sun came up and munching on Cap'n Crunch, or Froot Loops, or anything else to make you hyper and your teeth rot. Back then I loved Superman, and Wonder Woman. I wasn't all that crazy about Batman, and Robin. I actually thought they were dorks. I do love the newly revamped versions of the Caped Crusader and Boy Wonder, though. I liked some of the other heroes as well but not as much as the aforementioned ones. Great children's show. It should definitely be passed on to future generations.",1373587200,,674,4.487804878048781
2248255,5,B0007XFZMS,"This was during the time when Saturday mornings were all about the cartoons when you were a kid. They ran all day long from as early as 6 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. or 12 p.m. The Hanna-Barbera Super Friends shows were amazing. They're less dramatic than what is shown on television nowadays, but they were still good in their own right. I loved watching these shows again, they made me relive my childhood days. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to relive those childhood days and if they want to pass this on to their kids, this is the way to go.",1372291200,,549,4.288461538461538

2248258,5,B0007XFZMS,"I am 51 years old but still a boy at heart. I am only going to write about this DVD of Superfriends because I'd say pretty much the same things in any of their releases. This is a long running series that began in 1973. It was strictly for kids since it was one of many Saturday morning cartoons we used to have when I was a young boy. Yes, these episodes are not anything like the Justice League series that was aired a while back. It's also nothing like ""Young Justice"" or any Superhero team up. These stories were written at an innocent time when writers were not allowed to have any hero even make one punch on the bad guys. Even the writers have admitted that it was quite a challenge. Many of these episodes throughout the series would teach the kids lessons about topics to help kids make the world a better place when they grow up. These stories are very juvenile but also great fun and can be viewed by the entire family without fear of violence. Another aspect that I really enjoy about these stories is that many of the actors who play the various Superfriends also play other characters and villains by trying to change their voices. I find it lots of fun to pick out which Superfriend the voices are. It was obviously a money saving tactic and the kids would probably not have noticed it at the time. This series has Marvin, Wendy, and Wonder Dog who were obviously included for little viewers to relate to. I remember being very young and actually having a bit of a little boy crush on Wendy, even if she was just a cartoon!! Yes, these are lots of fun. I have all of these releases but, as of this writing, there are still episodes not released on DVD which doesn't make sense to me. One of my favorites to watch, especially around Halloween is ""The Superfriends meet Frankenstein"". We have them meeting Dracula, but not Frankenstein. Well, anyway, I pop one of these stories in my DVD player every Saturday morning soon after I get up just like I used to watch them on regular TV when they first aired. Other seasons include the Wonder Twins (Wonder Twin Powers...ACTIVATE!). Even though they bring back fond memories, I personally would prefer not having them in the stories at all. The shows always begin the storyline with the Wonder Twins doing something, taking up time for the actual storyline to begin. But it is what it is. Some other Superfriend series' do not include them at all.  I simply hope you find these stories fun, safe for kids, and nostalgic for the little boys or girls inside of you. I'm glad so many of them have been released.",1362787200,12,2567,4.450106157112526
2248259,4,B0007XFZMS,"Perhaps a bit dated, but still, it is the Super Friends!  My nephews have enjoyed watching my 70s childhood play before their eyes.",1360713600,,131,4.695652173913044
2248260,5,B0007XFZMS,I grew up on the Superfrineds. It is really nice to be able to relive that wonderful memory. Must watch!,1360540800,,104,4.25
2248261,5,B0007XFZMS,"I enjoyed watching the Super Friends cartoons in this Season One, Volume Two release and while the plots are soaked in environmental messages, strangely enough, the stories do not condemn those who have an opposing view. There's great pains took to show how people have the right to live as they see fit as long as it doesn't endanger or directly threaten the rights of others. In all the episodes in this collection the Super Friends set out to fix the problems created by those who are described as misguided. Most of the villains are written as eccentrics who mean no real harm to human life and that the motive for their actions is based upon correcting an existing ""problem"" in society.

I title this review ""The EPA Era"" because it was in the early '70s that the EPA came into existence. The Environmental Protection Agency and it's mission apparently had a big influence on the writers of this version of the Super Friends due to many of the stories relying on mad scientists and ""misguided"" citizens seeking to solve the problems of the world. In ""Fantastic Frerps"", for example, the Super Friends battle a villain named King Plasto. The plot of this episode deals with Plasto creating plastic replicas of buildings and cars and entire towns in an effort to preserve the use of natural resources that 'real' cities, cars, and factories use up. His creations are kept inside egg shells and when cracked open the contents unfold right before your eyes.

Greed is dealt with in the ""Ultra Beam"" episode where the villain uses a device he calls a Getty Graph to extract atomic matter and gold from the Earth. He doesn't do this for selfish reasons...instead he uses his device to rid the Earth of what he must consider one of the most dangerous elements of all-time, Gold, due to it's tendency to spur on the greed in people.

In ""Balloon People"", a family from another planet land in Marvin's backyard and gain the unfortunate attention of Wonder Dog, who appears as a growling monster in the eyes of the small balloon people. The family has the ability to inflate and deflate with a twist of a knob. The family is scouting for planets that are suitable for their race and free from pollution. A villain named Noah Tall and his assistant, Twisty, want to capture the balloon people.

In ""Gulliver's Gigantic Goof"" we have a story of a man, Dr. Gulliver, who uses a device to shrink people. In his mind he theorizes that if he shrinks the population it would aid in population control. He has at his side a pet cat named Igor. Gulliver's voice is based on horror/gangster movie actor, Peter Lorre, and it's performed by Casey Kasem. In fact, Kasem is not only the voice of Robin and the Justice League computer, he's also the voice of most of the villains or their assistants during Season One. Kasem is heard hilariously as the bumbling assistant, Twisty, in ""Balloon People"" while Norman Alden, the voice of Aquaman in Season One and the 1977 season, is heard as Twisty's boss, Noah Tall (a pun on the phrase, Know-it-All).

In ""Planet Splitter"" Wendy and Marvin are abducted by two eccentrics, Dr. Laban and Wilbur, who are out to split the planet in half. To pass the time Marvin tells the two about Superman's life and how his planet, Krypton, blown up seconds after having escaped as a baby in a rocket ship built by the baby's parents, Jor-El and Lara. We see Jor-El and Lara work on the device in addition to the famed scene of Jor-El delivering his speech to the High Council about Krypton's upcoming destruction. Toward the end of Marvin's story they try to get Marvin to reveal Superman's real identity...but Marvin caught himself in time.

In ""The White Dwarf"" we see the story of a villain named Raven who is bent on revenge. He terrorizes a rural family due to there being a kryptonite stone on their property. The Super Friends manage to gain access to the kryptonite and hide it in a lead box. In addition to launching the Washington Monument to a cloud (with Marvin and Wendy inside), Raven puts Superman on trial.

All in all Volume Two as well as Volume One of Season One are entertaining and yes, there's social messages for sure, but I came away with the feeling that the messages were just that: messages. The messages conveyed didn't bother me at all and a lot of that has to do with what I hinted at earlier: there's no strong condemnation or holier-than-thou attitude displayed at the characters who are described as 'misguided'...and that, in my opinion, makes all the difference between a cartoon coming off as preachy and one that doesn't come off as such.",1356912000,2,4588,4.649815043156597
2248262,5,B0007XFZMS,"My son is in love with super heroes, but the modern ones are too violent or the banter between the characters is too mature.  I found these older ones and they are PERFECT for my four year old.  He watches them again and again and again.",1355788800,9,237,4.130434782608695

2248266,4,B0007XFZMS,"This version of the Super Friends is minus the Hall of Doom, and minus any supervillains.  They battle electric monsters and tar monsters.  It is NOT nearly as good as the BEST Super Friends series 'Challenge of the Super Friends', however, I like it because I watched it on Saturday mornings with a big bowl of cereal, so the quality is not all that important to me.  Get 'Challenge of the Super Friends' FIRST, then if you don't mind a more silly version with less Super Friends, then rent this one from the library/video store and see if you like it.  For me, it reminds me of being a kid, and I love that!",1311206400,2,609,4.315789473684211

2248268,3,B0007XFZMS,"It was neat seeing the old cartoon especially with Green Arrow in one of the episodes.  Too bad these didn't have any REAL villains in like Joker, Mirror Master, Riddler, Luthor, Captain Cold, Black Hand, etc., and have some REAL villainy in the stories.  Unfortunately, these were sooooooo politically correct and environmental that they were getting very sickening.  Of course, liberals were whining about the violence in cartoons which was a bunch of garbage.  This was the beginning of the ""No Absolutes"" ERA.  These liberals were also whining about the Bugs Bunny and Road Runner cartoons being toooooooo violent...what a JOKE!!!!  Any parent worth his/her salt would take the time to explain to the child/ren, that these cartoons are fantasy and are supposed to be funny and that NOBODY can fall off of a cliff and bounce like an accordion.  Of course, this is also the era of the TV babysitting the kids and career minded parents who let their kids go to get in trouble.  SOOOOOOOOOO SAAAAAAADD!!!",1294876800,2,1004,4.934523809523809

It Just Brings Me Back To A Simpler Time & Era When Saturday Mornings Were For Kids & Cartoons, Such As This, Ruled The Airway.",1286582400,,418,4.172839506172839
2248271,5,B0007XFZMS,"You've been waiting for it and now it's here.  Volume 2 of the 1973 First Season of Super Friends, with Wendy, Marvin, & Wonder Dog is now on DVD!

The episodes from this season were an hour long each (about 46 minutes without commercials) and focused more on mystery solving and plot developments rather than pure action and adventure stories like later Super Friends incarnations.

Episodes included with Volume 2:

Disc 1:
01) The Balloon People
02) The Fantastic Frerps
03) The Ultra Beam
04) The Menace Of The White Dwarf

Disc 2:
05) The Mysterious Moles
06) Gulliver's Gigantic Goof
07) The Planet Splitter
08) The Watermen

Just like Volume 1, there will be another Super Friends interactive Trivia Challenge Quiz game included as bonus material.

If this sells well, we should see the release of the three remaining Super Friends series some time in the near future.  ""The World's Greatest Super Friends"" is even mentioned on the back of the case, which may be an indication that it will be the next season to be released.  (Update: Turns out ""World's Greatest Super Friends!"" was the next season to be released on DVD [as a TARGET STORE EXCLUSIVE], but it took nearly 3 years to come out since the last release.  All other seasons are also now available to order.)

2248273,4,B0007XFZMS,"This is the second series to be called simply The Super Friends (1978-1979) Thus the label volume 2. The First series under the same title which ran from 1973-1974 is the one that featured Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog. The episodes on this disc were not part of the All New Super Friends Hour. Or any other Super Friends incarnation. This was a stand alone series. Check out Hanna- Barbera's Super Friends Chronology. It's a great source for helping you keep track of all the Super Friends series and their actual titles.",1218931200,15,521,4.673913043478261
2248274,5,B0007XFZMS,"This video has excellent storylines involving some of DC's best superheroes.  The downside is the WonderTwins.  Half of the time you see these two nimrods and their stupid pet monkey, you'll laugh at how ridiculous they are.  The other half will spent wishing they would just go away.",1202947200,,284,4.875
2248275,3,B0007XFZMS,"Despite how it might appear, the Super Friends, Volume Two (DC Comics Classic Collection) is the second part of the 1978 season (red box set) that featured the Wondertwins and Gleek (in addition to 5 of the 11 Justice League Members).  It appears that the Amazon description of this set is filled with errors.

For starters, this is not the 1973 season as the title of this page suggests.  In addition the plot synopsis says to expect 'apprentice' super-heroes Marvin, Wendy, and Wonder Dog.  In reality, by 1978 the two junior members and their dog were replaced with the Vulcanized versions of Donnie and Marie Osmond and their pet space monkey, Gleek.  Finally even the special features aren't immune to such inaccuracies, promising a retrospective featuring Kevin Smith (of Clerks fame).  Nowhere is Mr. Smith found on this two-disc set.  Although Paul Dini (eating a Pop-Tart no less) makes a pretty funny appearance in the retrospective.

Errors aside, this collection contains 16 episodes that ran as the second portion of the season that introduced us to Challenge of the Superfriends back in 78.  The show's writers were clearly making strides in the right direction (especially compared to the 1977 season which also featured the Wondertwins).  The shows each run for just under a full half-hour and unlike their Challenge counterparts, do not offer a villain (or legion of villains) to battle.  Instead the show takes a similar (if not slightly improved) approach that was taken in the previous season where scientists and aliens make up the threats to the world.  Actually, expect a dose of alien activity that could put X-Files to shame! Among the strangest villains encountered is none other than Count Dracula himself who, rather than bite his victims to infect them, merely sprinkles dust on the exterior of a jumbo jet to transform the passengers into vampires.  In most every episode on the set, the Wondertwins disobey orders to stay at the Hall of Justice and wind up saving the day in the process.

Having never been a big fan of the Wondertwins in the first place, I do feel that this set pales in comparison to the Challenge of the Superfriends box set but remains an essential piece to the complete SF collection.

2248279,4,B0007XFZMS,"First off, everyone has an opinion on the entire SUPERFRIENDS series. Sticking with the episodes at hand on this DVD i liked them all. Before i read any reviews on here, i watched the DVD and i actually liked the story of the Anti-Matter Monster. The little, subtle things like Aquaman for example being taken to Atlantis in ""World Beneath the Ice"" is a good use of character history. I have my favorite episodes from the DVD, however. The favorites for me are ""Rokan: Enemy from Space"", ""Battle at Earth's Core"", ""Terror from the Phantom Zone"" which features Superman aging after being exposed to red Kryptonite and his having to travel to the asteroids of the blown up Krypton and recover blue Kryptonite to reverse the aging process, and ""Attack of the Vampire"" on DVD #1 and ""Anti-Matter Monster"", ""World Beneath the Ice"", and episodes #13 through #16 on DVD #2: ""Batman: Dead or Alive"", ""Battle of the Gods"" which makes good use of Wonder Woman's nemesis, Hara, and other mythical Gods more specifically Medusa. ""Journey Through Inner Space"" is just a knock-out episode...giving Aquaman center stage and using radiation and an underwater disaster to transform Aquaman into...well...i won't give the plot away. The last episode on DVD #2 is another good one. It involves an actual comic book villain, Superman's foe, Mr Myxlpltk. I know i have the name spelled wrong...it's pronounced ""mixel plick"". All in all, the DVD isn't as bad as it is being let on to be...plus, in my opinion, the Wonder Twins are what created the hype when these episodes were first being aired. Like them or not, they did bring in the viewers...keeping the show a success in re-runs and in first-run syndication for a few years. If i were to have a complaint it would be the use of Flash and Hawkman and Apache Chief on the DVD fold-out cover...scenes that took place on CHALLENGE OF THE SUPERFRIENDS are shown on the fold-out cover. Those characters are NOT on this DVD. Oh, of course, scenes from the actual episodes on this DVD are also shown in small thumbnail pictures on the fold-out cover, too.",1180742400,7,2081,4.767313019390581
2248280,2,B0007XFZMS,"I loved this series as a kid, but these DVD releases are a complete disaster. Firstly this is not Super Friends (1973 to 1974) as the DVD title might have some of you think, it is actually The All New Superfriends Hour (1977 to 1978) which was Season 2 of the whole Superfriends series. Secondly it's incomplete & doesn't contain all the episodes for this season & what's more they aren't even in order. This season should contain 26 episodes not including the 40 shorts from 1977, instead all you get is 16 episodes. I payed only $42 AUD (less in $USD) for the entire 65 episodes of Defenders Of The Earth & yet WB expects us to fork out around the same price for one fourth of the content & an incomplete series of episodes that aren't even in order. Lastly i am completely baffled by the logic behind WB choosing not to release each season in order from season 1 to 6 or correctly labeling each box set. This makes things all the more confusing since they released Challenge Of The Superfriends on DVD first (which is actually season 3) & labeled the DVD as Superfriends: The First Season??? In protest i suggest you just download the series instead if you can find it, you might not get DVD quality & special features, but at least you'll be able to have all the episodes & in order. The only reason this gets even 2 stars is because the cartoon series itself is great, it's just these DVDs themselves that are an absolute mess. Save your money unless you're not bothered by any of the things i've mentioned. Hope this review is helpful to others out there who are like myself & like things complete & in order.",1180396800,12,1615,4.404682274247492
2248281,3,B0007XFZMS,"Bought this as I had watched this as a kid.  It is definitely a classic but unfortunately, it pales in comparison to the cartoons of today which has smoother movement and more compelling storylines.  Even kids I showed it too were bored watching it.. Probably coz they are more accustomed to the newer cartoons of today.

Would I recommend it?  Probably for adults who watched it as a kid.. But not for the kids of today.",1163894400,,421,4.5
2248282,5,B0007XFZMS,my boys got this one at christmas from santa and have worn out the disc if thats possible. the only thing i never liked about this show were the tag along kids. first the earth kids then the space twins(even my boys don't like the twins). some great shows here and they are all great for the superhero in all of us!!,1148428800,,316,4.112903225806452
2248283,3,B0007XFZMS,"Unfortunately, my kids were disappointed upon receiving this dvd. They were expecting the series that contain the characters of Wendy and Marvin and Wonderdog. Instead, it has Jayna and Zan.

Please correct your description of this item, so people buy what they are really looking for.",1146528000,9,285,5.195652173913044
2248284,3,B0007XFZMS,"This set contains only 16 of 23 episodes. The 8 missing episodes are:

- Rub Three Times For Desaster (featuring a genie)

- Lex Luthor Strikes Back

- Space Knights of Camelon (featuring King Arthur)

- The Lord of Middle Earth (!)

- Universe of Evil

- Terror at 20,000 Fathoms (featuring Captain Nemoy ;))

- The Superfriends Meet Frankenstein

- The Planet of Oz (!)

Some of these episodes featured crossovers and might have tangled copyright issues (Tolkien, Land of Oz, Frankenstein, King Arthur) so I ask myself whether this is the reason they are missing in this release? It's a pity this set isn't complete.",1139702400,43,618,4.700934579439252
2248285,4,B0007XFZMS,"This series includes the first appearances of Mr Mxyzptlk & the Phantom Zone villains, as well as introducing us to Aquaman's undersea Atlantean friends. Great stories focussing on the five lead characters and the Wondertwins.",1128297600,6,226,5.485714285714286
2248286,5,B0007XFZMS,I watched these episodes as a kid and nearly 30 years later I enjoyed them all over again as a married adult. The storylines are all the same and the drawings are crude compared to today's Justice League but what makes this a great DVD is the dialogue. The voices go with each character especially the voice of Batman. This is a wonderful way to bring the Superfriends to your kids both young and old.,1126742400,6,401,4.36
2248287,3,B0007XFZMS,"The reviewers saying that these episodes are from the 1977-78 season of The Superfriends are wrong. This DVD release is a compilation of episodes from the 1979 season ""The World's Greatest Super Friends"". It should be noted that this release does NOT contain every episode from that season. It only has 16 of the 23 episodes. Why they did not include the entire season is anyone's guess. If you doubt what I say, go to the ""Superman Homepage"" and check for yourself. Whatever you do, don't listen to these turkeys. They have no clue what they're talking about.",1124841600,14,560,4.724489795918367
2248288,4,B0007XFZMS,"So glad to see Superfriends brought to life on DVD. This was hands down my favorite Saturday morning cartoon. Volume 2 delivers the lesser seen 1977-78 season of episodes that were excellent. The animation was really starting to develop here. The best are Battle of the Gods, Batman: Dead or Alive, Terror From the Phantom Zone and Attack of the Vampire. The latter being a prequel to Superfriends Meet Frankenstein (one of the all time best episodes where the 3 Superfriends are combined into one monster and Robin finally gets to save the day as a true superhero).  The worst episode in this set is definitely the Anti-Matter Monster which is more of a who-dunnit from a Scooby-Doo episode than the Superfriends saving the world.

There is also a humorous retrospective from 30-something ""celebrities"" which is worth a watch.

I wish they had done more to enhance the sound and picture, but I'll take this collection over the VHS ebay hacks that we've had to endure until now. This is a must buy for all Superfriends enthusiasts. Looking forward to the next season!",1116979200,8,1067,4.819672131147541
2248289,3,B0007XFZMS,"The Super Friends were riding high after just coming off of the incredible ""Challenge of the Super Friends"" series, which success was arguably lent to the presence of the Legion of Doom. So to build on this success, what did they do? Raise the Hall of Doom? No. Have a select few of the most amazing villains ever (Black Manta, Sinestro and Cheetah) battle the Justice League? Nope. What they did was scrap all the known and beloved villains! No more Lex Luthor, no more Scarecrow, not even The Toyman. Instead we get lame...er new baddies such a Dracula, robot cowboys and a big green thing that likes to hold Superman.

I know everyone hates them, but I feel a special place in my heart for the Wonder Twins and Gleek. They had that cool sounding intro to their powers and Zan could only be water-based objects. Trust me, if we had never of had the Wonder Twins, then we could never have been given that awesome episode of Harvey Birdman where we see Wonder Woman bathing with Zan as the bath water!",1116892800,7,1001,4.469945355191257
2248290,1,B0007XFZMS,"Wonder Twin powers ACTIVATE!

Shape of an out of chronological order DVD set!  Form of borderline litigious crosses between Donnie and Marie and Vulcans joined by that popular trope that ruined many a Hanna Barbera cartoon in the 1970s and 1980s, the oft-nonsensical (oftener still-animal) sidekick (see: Fonzie's dog on the Happy Days time travel cartoon, the pig drill sergeant on Laverne and Shirley, Baby Plas on Plastic man, Son on Captain Caveman and Son, ""the dangerous not to cities, just himself"" Godzookie on Godzilla, and the anti-Christ: Scrappy-Doo) this time being Gleek, a blue monkey.

Yes, coming from the same period that saw the Fantastic Four trade in the Human Torch for H.E.R.B.I.E. (they were afraid kids would set themselves on fire, but replicating the piling on of rocks that turned Benjy Grimm into The Thing was perfectly fine) and predated those half hour commercials for products that would dominate the mid-late part of the 1980s (My Little Pony, Potato Head Kids, Care Bears, Transformers, Rainbow Brite.  You played with them.  Rep-ra-ZENT!) the latest installment of the HB releases of The Superfriends cartoon.

Is it good for nostalgia?  Yeah, sure.  It's just far enough on this side of ""sane"" that you aren't like the forty-something virgin denizens of comics shops who ditched their jobs to wait in line for Episode III (Gee, d'ya think he really turns into Vader at the end?)  The animation isn't as bad as, say, the Filmation stuff from the late 1960s or the mid late1970s superherowise, but still, of all the periods of the cartoon, this was my least favorite.

Why the Marvin and Wendy period is being avoided like a hand grenade with Herpes, I have no idea.  This is the same company that has yet to touch any of its late 1950s/early 1960s cartoons like Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound and/or Quickdraw McGraw.  Who knows?
