8628810,1,B00GZ0NS9O,"I am shocked with the positive reviews on here. This movie is just bad and I feel bad for Edward Furlong. The CGI / green screen effects are so distracting and bad in this one. Usually I can look past that when taking into consideration budget constraints in movies, but this one has a green screen or awful CGI shot in 95% of the scenes. The story is pretty bad and predictable and some of the dialogue is laughable. There are also pretty glaring continuity issues as well. There is also a giant plot-hole that I can't believe made it into the movie (I don't want to give spoilers but it has to do with the presence of their car). Maybe I totally missed something, but this was so blatant that I went back to see if I missed anything after finishing this and I don't think I have.",1488931200,,781,4.248322147651007
8628811,5,B00GZ0NS9O,"Forget the vaporware digital version, get the Blu-ray-DVD combo! Great flick with plenty of imagination and imagery. Special effects are quite good and there are several ""jump-out-of-your-seat"" moments. Ending is a bit vague, but full of consequences!",1476230400,,251,5.8108108108108105
8628812,4,B00GZ0NS9O,"This movie is far from a classic, but it's actually quite enjoyable!  The main complaint I have is that there's no way that Waldron and Furlong would have a daughter that old, but aside from that, those two performances are highlights in this flick, Waldron especially.  There are a few legit creepy scenes that make this one worth checking out.",1402963200,,345,4.733333333333333
8628813,5,B00GZ0NS9O,"Popping an independent film into the blu-ray player is always a gamble.

One of the first things that hits you when watching STITCH is a cheesy effect. The camera swoops over a car driving along a desert highway and then flies towards an abandoned house. The CGI shot was clearly meant to be epic but looked more like it belonged in a video game. So I thought I lost the gamble. Thankfully things got better.

We follow along with a husband and wife who are mourning their dead kid. A couple of their friends have invited these depressed parents to an abandoned house in the deep desert (!) for some type of healing weekend. I thought that was interesting take on the cliche of a cabin in the woods. This is a mansion in the desert; Hardly a quantum-leap from cliche but an interesting choice nonetheless. Dozens of such interesting choices add up throughout the film and make a difference.

The healing weekend suffers a misfire and all hell breaks loose. The skies open up in an apocalyptic lightning storm (via a few more wonky effects) and the characters get attacked by a demonic force. The demon's specialty is scarring human bodies with some pretty gruesome stitches!

The story is engrossing and quite original. I was never quite sure what was going on and what to make of things. But instead of losing me, the film held my interest. Wonky effects aside, the overall visual palette was surreal, original and disturbing in some undefined way. And just when the plot achieved maximum confusion, all the pieces started to come together and make sense. The stitches made sense. The characters made sense. Even the surreal house in the desert made sense. I really think this little horror movie redefines the genre in some ways. There are a lot of emotional and metaphysical truths beneath all the surface scares and gore. STITCH manages to satisfy as a horror-thriller while offering some extra mental meat for anyone who cares to dissect it.

So the gamble paid off for me but I would throw out some cautions for the average viewer. The film can be cryptic and a bit hard to follow initially. You have to put your thinking cap on. It's definitely not a standard slasher or thriller. So if you are looking for the latter, you will probably hate it. But if you are interested in something different with your scary-fix , then this just might do the trick.",1399075200,3,2358,4.6450839328537175
8628814,5,B00GZ0NS9O,"The first 20 minutes are a bit slow, unlike most modern horrors that hit you very quickly with shocks and what not. I found that refreshing but some viewers might not have the patience. After that first slow bit though, the movie grabs you by the throat and doesn't let up until the end.

The Story - A couple, saddened by the death of their daughter, is invited to the desert by their friends for some kind of healing ritual. It's a fire ceremony where the dead kid's toys and pictures are burned in order to ""let go"" of her memory. But the couple's friends are either quacks or they dabble in the black arts. As a result, the fire ritual unleashes paranormal forces. The demonic entities trap the characters in the desert and attack them by slashing their skin with gruesome stitches.

But everything is NOT as it seems.

Without giving up spoilers, Stitch blends elements of horror, thriller, psychological and apocalyptic epic movies into one. And while that might sound like a jumble of incoherent themes, it manages to blend them in a clever way.

How are all these themes blended? The movie is really a metaphysical vision told through the eyes of one character. That character is depressed, possibly suicidal. And like anyone in that mental condition - the world might as well be coming to an end. Through such a person's eyes, the world would also look quite horrifying and scary, as anyone suffering mental illness or delusions can attest to. So what seems to be happening in the movie, may only be occurring on a different level of reality, so to speak.

Everything is clear by the end but it does take some mulling over in order to make sense of it all. That makes Stitch challenging to the viewer. But it still manages to thrill and scare. So if you don't like mental challenges you will still be entertained.

As for flaws, there are several scenes where this indie movie smashes head first into it's obvious low budget. Most of the effects are quite good but I rolled my eyes at least six times due to some effects that tried to punch above their weight. Not a deal breaker for me by any means. But younger kids used to the spectacle of Avatar or Transformers might not be so forgiving.",1394409600,2,2201,4.545454545454546
8628815,3,B00GZ0NS9O,it was a alright movie but at times it didn't make sence to me it also was quite borning at times,1394064000,,97,3.6666666666666665
8628816,2,B00GZ0NS9O,First of all I would like to say that the special effects is the only thing this movie has going for itself.  The story was very confusing and only till the end do we see it is HELL.  The constant weird flashbacks and outtakes were somewhat annoying.  I am glad that little Eddie Furlong has returned to  acting and hope he finds a vehicle that is worthy of his talents in the future.,1392422400,,384,4.219178082191781
8628817,5,B00GZ0NS9O,"I buy too many blu-rays (and before that DVDs). I'm a movie fan and it's an addiction - plain and simple. So it was easy for me to pick up this blu-ray without knowing anything about it, other than it starred Ed Furlong. He's seared into my memory from hundreds of viewings of Terminator 2, so why not I thought.

I settled down with a six-pack and a big bag of nachos and was ready for a laughable z-movie, a la Sharknado or Furlong's last piece of junk, The Zombie King.

Boy was I wrong!

Stitch is one of the most unusual and effective horror films I've seen in a long time. Yes, some scenes betray low budget roots. But it more than compensates for any flaws with tremendous heart, a very original story, a lot of terror and some of the most surreal situations and imagery I've seen in a long time. It's the type of movie that just had to be an independent, mainly because big-budget Hollywood no longer takes risks like this any more, rarely veering off standard formulas.

Don't get me wrong - Stitch still has enough ""standard storytelling"" tropes in its basic plot. It's not some Gaspar Noe acid trip (though some scenes go there). You can follow the story. But it takes chances. You can't predict where it's gonna go and that, for me, was a huge breath of fresh air. And just when I though I knew what the movie was about, the final act really throws the viewer for a loop. In a good way. In fact, I plan on watching it again in about a month, which means that it's now on my personal Recommend List. And only good or great movies make that list. I'm not yet ready to call Stitch 'great' but it's definitely 'good' and could move up a notch or two on subsequent viewings.

Oh, and Furlong is finally amazing again, as are the other actors. The overall quality in acting, effects and music are well above what you would expect from this genre and budget. Really top notch on all levels.

Never even heard of this film before and I read a ton of movie sites. I think it's reputation is bound to grow. Either way, a pleasant surprise for me!",1392336000,3,2048,4.306493506493506
8628818,5,B00GZ0NS9O,"I've been to the screening of Stitch a few days ago, expecting the classic cheesy horror movie with lame effects and clich storyline...
I'm glad I was wrong. Very wrong!

First of all ""Stitch"" is not a classic horror, more like a thriller with supernatural elements. There are scare jump moments, but the idea is more tension rather than gore and fear.

Since from the intro we would see how the visual elements are portrayed in an epic yet useful way, as they were building and hinting about a world that we would experience shortly.

The story flows nicely without rushing to the action parts, explaining precisely the plot and the characters.
The acting is great: all the actors are believable, especially Shawna Waldron is giving a hell of a performance through the entire movie. Laurence Mason and Edward Furlong are great too, a perfect fit for their respective roles.

Photography is probably the weakest part, but the visual effects are balancing the visuals with a variety of epic and impressive eye candies, never gratuity and always on support of the story. The thunderstorm and the ritual scene, both heavily post produced without feeling fake, are probably the most impressive scenes in the whole movie.

Special Effects Make Up is absolutely outstanding, the gruesome stitches on the characters are absolutely believable... sometimes even too much!

Score and sound effects are great as well, helping to bring yourself into this infernal world.

As for the art department, I was really impressed about the set design and the abundance of different textures and elements in the scenes, usually a flag for cheap productions.

Last but not least, the directorial debut for Ajai is really impressive, showing advanced storytelling skills even at the first experience and on a low budget production.

Overall it's a must see, especially if you are looking for a story unique and smart. If you, instead, are looking for just mindless violence and gore, you might be nicely got off guard.",1390176000,,1995,4.984939759036145
