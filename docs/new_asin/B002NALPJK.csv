8374909,5,B002NALPJK,"As an American born in Vienna, with relatives still in that city, and having visited Vienna numerous times, and having collected a number of Vienna travel videoes, I can with with all honesty rate this one as one of the best. I don't understand how they can sell this one so inexpensively. It's really wonderful the way it incorporates the history of the city all the way through the film. Yes, true, it doesn't have that many interior views, but all the more reason to visit and see for yourself. None of the DVD's I have had many interior views, either. The last time I visited was in 2001 having returned home just a month before 9/l1. I left just when the Museum Quartier was being built and a friend of a friend was allowed to show me the construction that was going on. I  have not viewed the Berlin part of the DVD yet, Never been there, but I expect it to be just as good.",1385164800,,880,4.269461077844311
8374910,1,B002NALPJK,"This is the WORST travel video i have ever seen.  I warn you, do NOT buy any of these.

Like a fool, I bought four of the series for my parents for a gift, but when i screened them, i was hugely embarrassed, and my parents said the shows were too boring to keep watching.  The writer/director/narrator drove through the heart of each town once and shoot footage of one museum and one church.  The rest is filler.  Hardly any interiors.  The guys is a genius -- after all there aren't many people who could make Rome and Paris and Amsterdam and Tokyo so utterly boring!!!",1372809600,,570,4.330188679245283

8374912,2,B002NALPJK,I was disappointed with this book in that it seemed to very briefly cover some standard sights at each of the two cities.  There was little depth in the coverage and a great deal of interesting information about the cities and their cultures seemed absent.  I would prefer separate and much more intensive books about each of the two locations.,1310515200,,344,4.716666666666667
8374913,5,B002NALPJK,"This series of DVDs is the best series of travelogues I have seen and I've seen many of them. It is very comprehensive and well done. They give you just enough historical background of each city then show you both the outside and inside of about 20 of the top attractions, such as cathedrals, museums, parks and palaces. They don't waste time showing you things that you can see anywhere as some travelogues do-- you see what is unique to the city being discussed. They concentrate on the core of the city. You will feel like you really know the city when the DVD is done. This DVD was produced in the 21st century so it is a generation more up-to-date than most travelogues you see.  Both the photography and the narration are excellent. Highly recommended.",1254873600,2,758,4.573529411764706

8374916,5,B002NALPJK,"This travelogue is very well done.  It shows you at least 20 of the most popular tourist attractions of each city it explores.  You see both the outside and the inside of the cathedrals, museums, palaces and other attractions.  The attractions are very well selected and the narration and photography is excellent.  This is one of the best travelogue series I have seen, and I have seen a lot of them.  Highly recommended.",1254355200,8,422,4.726027397260274
