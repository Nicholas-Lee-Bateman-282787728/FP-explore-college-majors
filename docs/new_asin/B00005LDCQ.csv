1621446,3,B00005LDCQ,"Sure, this movie isn't much good.  A lot of time it looks as if it were made by a small child.  Did they even have a script?  But all that's really beside the point for fans of this stuff.  Here's the great Klaus Kinski in a Jess Franco movie!  Wonder if he slept with Lina Romay?  Klaus slept with everyone else, at least according to his book.
Klaus stalks, female flesh is exposed, blood flows, and Jess does something that might, in a pinch, even pass for direction.  What are you waiting for?  Buy this DVD!",1000771200,2,512,4.260416666666667
1621447,2,B00005LDCQ,"With the release of ""From Hell"" sure to revive interest in Jack the Ripper, this 1976 effort from exploitation director Jesus ""Jess"" Franco is going to get some revived interest.  But this ""Jack the Ripper"" is only loosely based on the historic murders.  Klaus Kinski plays the title character and his ""true"" identity of Dr. Orloff.  The explanation here is that ""Jack"" was abused by his prostitute mother and so he starts butchering prostitutes on the streets of London.  Even in a film career based on dishing out the gory, Franco finds a way to go way over the top with this one.  This is a movie of stomach turning, savage violence that is rated ""R"" only because they did not have NC-17 way back then.  You do not want to know anybody who can laugh their way through the gore in this one.  The DVD version includes the theatrical trailer (""Close your eyes and whisper his name...""), photo stills and liner notes.",999993600,4,916,4.58282208588957
1621448,3,B00005LDCQ,"This film is a relatively decent portrayal of the ripper murders of the late 1880's. Klaus Kiniski does a very good job depicting the mental instability that must have plagued the real Jack the Ripper. Overall , I was a bit dissappointed in the film's relative lack of gore considering the unsavory reputation this film supposedly has. But there is plenty of atmosphere and a touch of gothic to the fim's ambience. If you want blood and graphic depictions of murder check out New York Ripper instead, but if you are in the mood for a good european style thriller with some creepy atmosphere and an even creepier actor then check out Jack the Ripper.",999475200,9,649,4.6521739130434785

1621455,2,B00005LDCQ,"...made even more insufferable by poor narration. Why they couldn't narrate this documentary in a faster, clearer tone is beyond me. The slow grating OTT narration belongs in a hammy horror film not in a serious documentary.

If you can get beyond this and the cheap clich&eacute; re-shoots of Jack walking the cobblestone streets with a gladstone bag then the contemporary shots of the crime scenes are fascinating to those who have not been to Whitechapel and wish to see how things have changed (and see how things haven't changed) since the days of 1888.

1621458,5,B00005LDCQ,I had never witnessed a Jess Franco film before I picked up Franco's Jack The Ripper and I'm extremely impressed! It's a low budgent venture but Franco is obviously the right man for the job and knows exactly how to make this type of film work. Highly entertaining.,1102032000,2,265,4.541666666666667
1621459,2,B00005LDCQ,"Let me begin this review with the statement that DVD packaging does make or break a film.  Also, DVD packaging that attempts to be creative and exciting (when it is actually not) will only break a film.  I mention this because it is what I experienced with Jack the Ripper on DVD.  When the film's menu started it seemed like there was some time and effort put into this release.  As the menu opens there is Kinski's spooky eye twitching back and forth with several options for special features and extras.  I was impressed; I thought that this film would just start without really any detail going into the DVD.  This is what I thought, until I tried to work the audio options.  With my German not up to par, I needed some subtitles or anything to help translate this film.  What I discovered were flags for different countries to have the characters speak.  This was a dubbed film, and the only flag that I knew (since there was no American flag) was Britain's flag.  A made the choice and changed the outlook on this film forever.  While it was grizzly to watch, there was quite a bit of humor behind it as D-grade British actors attempt to dub over German words.  The character voice placement was horrendous.  The main police officer sounded more effeminate than respectable and the others had this feel that they were behind the microphone speaking their lines.  You never really felt like the voices matched the characters.  What began as a developed horror story soon turned into a possible MST3K episode.  It really detracted from the overall feel of the film.

This was my first Jesus Franco film and let me say I was taken aback.  I wasn't expecting to see the gore and disgusting acts that Jack the Ripper did to these unsuspecting women.  Franco holds nothing back from these deeds.  The blood is fake, the bodies are doubles, and Franco is behind the camera making this all work.  Outside of Clint Howard, Franco could be a master of this genre.  I need to see more of his work, but this initial taste left a flavor in my mouth I cannot seem to fathom.  I was impressed, and not impressed with this body of work.  Kinski did a fantastic job of creating this hellish creature devoid of fear and compassion.  The raw power in his eyes alone will send shivers up your spine as you sit in the comfort of your own couch.  This was awesome to see, but then on the other side of the spectrum the voice and sound that came from Kinski's mouth was embarrassing.  You were scared, yet laughing at the same time.  This is the first time that I have ever experienced this feeling while watching a film.  Kinski pulled me into this film, but the sound yanked me back out.

Before you expect too much from this film, you need to realize that this was a B-rated horror film.  The young women show their breasts, they run into the woods instead of into safety, there are dark alleyways and implausible characters.  This is not a film to win awards, but to a newbie into the world of Jesus Franco, it was fascinating.  This was not in anyway the caliber of From Hell, because it is a slasher film to the utmost degree.  It was somewhat of a tame slasher film, but nonetheless one in that genre.  Sexual instability is the culprit in Franco's eyes that built this mass murderer known as Jack the Ripper.  While Franco does skew the truth a bit about the actual murders involved with Jack the Ripper (throwing the bodies in the Themes, etc.), it still makes an interesting story.

Overall, it was decent.  After I watched it and thought about it for some time, I had a better respect for the film.  It wasn't the greatest, yet it wasn't horribly bad.  The dubbing caused me the most irritation, while Kinski raised the bar on this film.  If you go into this film with high expectations, you will be utterly disappointed, but if you go in with an open mind and an ability to laugh, than it may just be up your dark alley.  The DVD packaging is impressive, yet very misleading.  The transfer of this film to DVD is impressive for it being made in 1976.  Again, not expecting a lot will lead to a better film experience.  You should also accompany this film with your favorite six-pack of beer and your most eccentric friend.  Sit back, relax (as much as you can with this film) and enjoy the next hour and a half.

Grade: ** out of *****",1101945600,12,4330,4.450381679389313
1621460,1,B00005LDCQ,"This Jess Franco film is as bad as it gets. I will not waste either my time or those of reviewers with a long diatribe.  Unless you want to build a collection of the worst films ever made, then you probably want to stay clear this Jack The Ripoff who lurks the dark corners of your video store.

All I can say is that I bought this film because I'm a Klaus Kinski fan: particularly of his work with Herzog.  Without knowing it, this catchy title with Klaus Kinski caught my attention in an obscure corner of the video store very much like the infamous killer jumped on his victims from out of the London fog.  Next thing I know, I fall victim to the jabbing pain of pathetic scenes and horribly fake special effects.

This is quite a stretch from Herzog's work and Klaus Kinski is horribly underused in this film: he barely utters any lines!  Everything about this film is cheap and just bad: the plot, the acting, the directing, the filming, everything!  Avoid this film at all costs!",1092096000,4,985,4.4088397790055245
1621461,2,B00005LDCQ,"As my title says ,this DVD was a rehash of the murders,not enough on the Conspiracy theories part for my taste ,but the scenes of the crime scenes then and now was interesting but not enought o carry this DVD",1084233600,8,208,4.225
1621462,3,B00005LDCQ,This is a good looking package. The print is fine and the color and photography are sumptuous. But the film itself is another matter. The dubbing is laughable with voices mismatched to the characters so that whole scenes are comical when they should be serious. The victims are too healthy looking and pretty and costumed for a rock video---not the Whitechapel period of the Ripper. And boy do those costumes come off fast. The girls don't even put up a fight. They just whimper. The gore is confined to one scene that's gross but not very convincing. Klaus Kinski is sufficiently sinister as Jack but he just mopes around and tangles with the girls. So this is just a sexploitation effort by Franco although it looks good. Too bad it isn't.,1044144000,12,741,4.66412213740458
1621463,2,B00005LDCQ,"Make no mistake about it, the movie is very poorly made and has laughable acting, but this one is still entertaining. ""Jack The Ripper,"" One of Jesus' most well known films, is a test for average film goers. Necrophilia (almost) and really low budget gore make this movie hard for the ""Lord Of The Rings"" viewer to witness. But that fact is the beauty of it all. If you ever watch a Fraco movie it's a badge of honor: ""Hey, that movie was funny as junk, it was awesome."" Jesus Franco's perception of The Ripper is a unique one, making him an insane doctor who treats the less than fortunate Fellow. Warm hearted doctor Luv by day, Cold blooded pscho necrphyliac murderer. Doesn't fit, but is certainly entertaining.

Image's disc is the US version of the legendary European VIP edition, featuring a new, longer transfer which adds so much more atmosphere to this masterpiece of horror. Kinski as the maniac killer and Lina Romay as a sexy prostitute are reason enough to make this movie a classic.",1039132800,5,306,4.685185185185185
1621465,2,B00005LDCQ,"I purchased this DVD on a whim because of its ultra-low price and the fact that I really liked ""From Hell"" and horror/true crime films.  Well, I can safely say that this is not ""From Hell,"" and any resemblance to the actual Jack The Ripper murders in 1888 is tenuous at best.  Here's why (possible SPOILERS ahead):
1. I realize that this is a low budget film, but this is absolutely the worst DVD transfer I have ever seen.  It makes Caligula look like Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace as far as picture quality.
2. If this film was supposed to be set in Whitechapel in 1888, you could have fooled me.  Whitechapel at that time contained a population of several hundred thousand; this film made it look like it was a small village consisting of two policemen, an old blind guy, three or four prostitutes, an old lady, two fishermen, and a few others.  Was this filmed in London?  Once or twice, we see Big Ben, but it might have been stock footage.
3. Jack The Ripper did not dump his victims into the Thames, nor did he likely have some woman in a greenhouse helping him.  (Who was she, anyway?)
4. Many of the fashions are all wrong.  The men wore shirts and ties which looked to be from the 1920s, not the 1880s.  Where were the derbys?  Prostitutes also wore more clothes than these women did.
5. Klaus Kinski speaks very few lines in this entire film, few enough to rival Charles Bronson's lack of verbosity in the Death Wish series.  There is little room for character development in this film, and we could have used a bit more background on him.  Was his name ever even mentioned (beyond merely ""Doctor""?)
6. The film had a lame ending, to say the least.  (...)
In summary, this film is not a must-see proposition.  But for the price, buy it anyway just so your friends can say, ""Hey, is this that cool Johnny Depp movie?"" and you can smile knowingly.",1006041600,8,1866,4.402332361516035
1621466,1,B00005LDCQ,"Definitely one for Thanksgiving Dinner - a real turkey
Putting on one side the appalling print and sound quality, and suffering from a dreadful transfer to DVD, the film itself should get an award for awfulness.

7943791,3,B00005LDCQ,"""Jack the Ripper""(1976) is directed by Jess Franco. This is the story of a serial killer who was thought to have killed at least 5 women, and possibly as many as 11 from 1888 to 1891 in London. These were particularly brutal murders that involved the removal of organs, which led some to believe that the killer had some surgical knowledge. In this movie Jack the Ripper (Klaus Kinski) is depicted as a doctor. The actual killer was never captured, and it was believed he either died or moved out from the area. There were other murders at the time, like the ""torso murders"", but these were thought to be from another serial killer, or perhaps copycat killers, since the method of the murders differed. In this movie those murders are lumped together. It was interesting to watch his much earlier film ""The Awful Dr. Orlof""(1962), which is much more convincing in its portrayal of the cabaret scenes. ""Jack the Ripper"" is obviously not on the same level as that earlier, somewhat groundbreaking film, neither from the quality of acting, nor to his deft balance between fluid and static shots, never the less this is still worth taking a look at if one is a fan of Franco films.

This blu-ray looks good and has been remastered. Unfortunately the English is poorly dubbed and there are no English subtitles to accompany the German language, which might have been the preferred way to watch this movie. Oddly enough there are subtitles in other languages like Finnish, Japanese, Chinese, and Greek. There is a German commentary track with the producer(Erwin Dietrich) that has English subtitles. There are also some special features, including interviews with actors, and Jess Franco, as well as one on the restoration, and another which is a homage to Jess Franco with Dietrich, but for some reason none of these worked on either of my North American blu-ray players(the screen just went blank whenever I tried to access these features). This may have something to do with this disc not being totally region free. The movie, however, does play on a North America blu-ray player with no problems.",1455148800,3,2094,4.832869080779944
