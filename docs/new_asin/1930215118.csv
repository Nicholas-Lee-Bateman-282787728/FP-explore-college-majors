7801378,3,1930215118,"Shaping 101 is a decent overview of the shaping process.  However, Carper seems more exceited to show his prowess with a power planer after telling the viewer that the power planer is an optional tool.  90% of the shaping you get to see is Carper using his Skil 100 planer.  I would have rather have seen more Surform use.  He builds in the rail bands in about 90 seconds with the Skil 100, whereas a novice will take much longer using hand tools; and a beginner should not be using the planer for more than skinning the blank on their first board or two.  Honestly, if you can pick this video up 2nd or 3rd hand, it's worth the money.  Don't pay full retail for this.",1282521600,6,668,4.261904761904762
7801379,5,1930215118,"good video, it goes over tools and tricks of the trade...if you want to shape, this is where to start.",1189382400,,102,4.15
7801380,2,1930215118,"When bought togeter with the Glassing 101 video,

this totals out to $70.  Ouch!

The methods of shaping presented mimic the same kind of wasteful spending, with expensive (and optional) power tools and an arsenal of obscure equipment presented as almost mandatory.  It is of almost no use to the common DIY shaper, who needs only basic and inexpensive tools.

It's also kind of cheesy, and the video format means that you better be taking notes if you want to learn anything.

I would recommend ""Shaping and Glassing"" by Steven Miller instead because it has probably more information, better diagrams, and costs about 15 bucks.",1152576000,12,628,4.933333333333334
7801381,5,1930215118,"As my title explains, there is no one else out there who put out a  surfboard shaping video on the market except for John Carper.  Fortunateley, the video is an excellent resource for learnig how to shape  surfboards for the first time.  He explains everything step by step from  begining to end.  His particular attention to detail is evident throughout  the entire video as he explains, and demonstrates his shaping techniques  and theories surrounding the many designs for different suring enviorments.  If I did not know anything about surfing and watched the video, I probably  would still enjoy it.  There are some clips of surfing footage with the  different surfboards JC designed which keeps you glued to the tv.  Great  music too.",968716800,8,740,4.959016393442623
