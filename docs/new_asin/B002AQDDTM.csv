3890861,4,B002AQDDTM,"This definitely a low budget film, but the acting was good.  The story line was a little sketchy, but considering the plot I can see how that would happen.  All in all I gave it a four.  I'm a Prime member so it cost me nothing to watch the movie.  If I had paid full price, I would feel a little ripped off.  So, if you watch Prime movies for free, go for it.  If you have to pay you may be disappointed.",1433289600,8,405,3.819277108433735

3890865,5,B002AQDDTM,"This is a very convoluted sci-fi movie with a much different twist on it than I have ever seen before, and it is so well done; especially the CGI, that it is spellbinding for a low-budget Indie production and proves how imagination can blend into a story-line to keep the audi9ence deeply involved right tup to and including the rolling of the credits!

3890867,5,B002AQDDTM,"Excellent movie that keeps you thinking.  It took a very long time to reveal what was ""wrong"" but that made it worth watching.  If this could only be real, it would give you a a chance to be forgiven and be to forgive, start life over if you should ever mess up.  Awesome movie.",1432166400,,278,4.111111111111111
3890868,5,B002AQDDTM,"Fissure is an excellent movie with a lot of second guessing yourself.  I loved it! This is the perfect movie to get a bunch of friends together and then have a great time discussing afterwards.  Is this a ghost story, is the main protagonist crazy and why, or what else could be wrong.  Following all the clues to see where they lead is a quiet but suspenseful movie that leads people on a crazy mystery.  I really can't say anything about the story line itself.  Why should I give you an advantage?  The acting was great, the set design and even the lighting very important and very well done.  This really was a difficult subject to capture on film and Russ Pond did a fantastic job.  I highly recommend this movie.  In fact my sixteen year old is telling all his friends to watch it and it's not a high action film.  It just captures the imagination.",1261785600,9,853,4.375796178343949

3890925,4,B002AQDDTM,"Science fiction movies are often times tricky.  If you are given too much storyline information in the beginning, usually you can pretty much figure out how the plot is going to evolve.  However, in Fissure, it is obvious from early on that our main character, a police detective, may be suffering from serious psychological problems that were caused by his accidentally killing his own son.  Here is a father grieving the loss of his son and obviously unable to reconcile so traumatic an event that we think he is withdrawing from reality, into a world of disconnected, confusion, while emotionally abandoning his wife to work through her grieving, alone.

His premature return to police work immediately thrusts him into a somewhat bizarre investigation of what we are led to believe, resulted from a ""prank"" emergency call to his police unit.  When he arrives, it appears to be an apparent suicide, but gets complicated when the body mysteriously disappears while our detective searches the house for occupants, clues and encounters other members of the household.  Through logical investigative deduction, he uncovers the possibility that he might have been there before and most likely discharged his weapon.  Along with our police detective privately questioning each household member, we begin to piece together a suspicion that the death may have been a murder; that is, until the victim turns up alive in the study.

After being knocked unconscious from behind, by an unseen figure, finally our revived detective begins to understand how thing are fitting together, and solves the crime, just in time to prevent it from happening.  Sounds confusing?  You might need a PhD in theoretical physics to figure it all out.  But it is possible.",1464566400,5,1746,5.112676056338028

3890928,3,B002AQDDTM,"I think that this movie is essentially about time travel, but it was so confusing to me that I am not totally convinced of that. The main character moves in and out of time, apparently, discovering that things have changed, possibly due to his interference. It is quite incoherent most of the way through the movie. I was so bored and confused that I drifted off to sleep several times during my viewing of it.

If you have the time (no pun intended) you might want to peruse this movie. Otherwise, you can skip it.",1464393600,,515,4.421052631578948

The actors were all into it. But it felt a lot like a play on a stage. I liked it, but it could have been better.",1435795200,,281,4.035714285714286

3890991,5,B002AQDDTM,Pretty good for a B movie. I recognized the main actor from The Kids Are Allright. It's sort of a Sci-Fi Crime movie. My husband liked it better than me.,1435276800,,153,4.133333333333334

3891004,5,B002AQDDTM,"Very well done!  Amazing what can be done on so called ""Low Budget"".

I suppose those of us in the viewing audience might need some knowledge of ground breaking work in the quantum scientific field to get an inkling of what may be going on in the initial part of this murder mystery.

There has long long been speculation within the Science Fiction genre concerning the nature of time and assumed paradox relating to manipulation of it.  The many worlds/Universes Theory came out of this Sci Fi exploration.  Simply put...there are many Universes existing at the same time.  More...new ones are being created every moment via our very own personal decisions when faced with situations at any particular time.  World without number or end...""Many Mansions""...Imagine That...  Absolutely anything and everything is possible.  Even better...if you have the imagination and visualization skills and the positive emotional energy to fuel it...you can change and/or create anything.  This last is the final implication that the modern Religion of Science is terrified to explore...Further, there likely is active discouragement being employed to block any action toward this end...  Yet, it has already been done many times over the ages.  There is NO DEFICIT in everyone being trained to this knowledge and natural skill.

Speculation upon this phenomena began amongst Einstein and his colleagues over a hundred years ago.  Einstein knew that his Theory of Relativity was false...but could not explain the phenomena that disproved it...so the rest is history.

This Detective, doing what they are trained to do, finally figures it all out...and also ""Intends"" to change a few things in his past with what the gathered facts imply...  Interestingly, he also manages to convince the good scientist to do the same with his own Son.  Still, one never knows what the total consequences will be of stepping out into the unknown...at least within the confines of this reality we generate.  A wonderful ending...also a Morality Play with a message for all of us.  What are/is the most important things in our lives?  Do Not Ignore Them for something as transient as a J.O.B..  ...or so many other distractions from reality.

What do we take with us when we leave this life?  Whole civilizations in the past have been dedicated to this realization.",1433808000,3,2334,5.100263852242744

8360029,3,B002AQDDTM,"It has a very, very, slow developing story line. You keep waiting for some action, until you realize that its not really going to come, and that the plot is not what you anticipated, it just stays flat. I didn't watch all the way til the end, maybe 3/4 of the way. I expected an action drama, so I kept expecting the drama/action to pick up, but it was more like a 'C' grade mystery movie. I struggled to keep watching, before I realized what it was actually about, then I gave up.",1485993600,,481,4.182795698924731
