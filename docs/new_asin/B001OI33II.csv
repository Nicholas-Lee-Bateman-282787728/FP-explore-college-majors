Chicago Cubs' superfan Ronnie Woo Woo is a quintessential American character, whose story is told with energy and artistry by Paul Hoffman. Framed with insights into his often tragic personal life and his very public love affair with the ""Cubbies,"" Ronnie's quest to sing ""Take Me Out To The Ballgame"" at Wrigley Field is the dramatic center of this affecting story. I definitely recommend it, even to non-baseball fans. Ronnie Woo Woo's story is universal, and worth experiencing.",1231891200,,561,5.2444444444444445

3730279,5,B001OI33II,"The first time that I met Ronnie was in 1995, during my first visit to Chicago. Quickly, I learned that he is a Chicago institution. I see him annually and he is always warm and kind to me and everyone around him. Over the years I thought that I had gotten to know Ronnie quite well. It was not until I saw this film that I really learned what Ronnie is all about.
Ronnie is often misunderstood, however he has earned the friendship and respect of the people who do understand him. Some of which are the most well respected people in baseball, including the late great Buck O'Neil.
This film really illustrates all of that and everything else that Ronnie is about. It tells his heartbreaking back story eloquently. It is immensely moving and is undeniably strong with its message of resiliency and strength of the human spirit.
Everyone should see this film. There is not a person alive who could not learn from Ronnie.",1231804800,,919,4.542168674698795
3730280,5,B001OI33II,"I saw this movie at a charity benefit and I was really impressed with the filmmaking, especially considering this was from as first time director.

I am not much of a baseball fan but I was drawn in by the passion for the game  displayed by the people involved with this  film.

I am glad to see it being made available to a wider audience.  A touching and funny movie for all ages.",1231632000,,382,4.178082191780822
3730281,5,B001OI33II,"Paul Hoffman's documentary about Cubs super fan Ronnie ""Woo-Woo"" is amazingly captivating.  He reveals many of the struggles Ronnie has gone through in life, and how he was able to overcome them.  There are moments that are difficult to watch, particularly when Ronnie goes down to Lower Wacker to reconstruct his years of homelessness.  Then there are moments that are endearing and funny, like when Ronnie receives his dentures.  Hoffman also shows how tenuous relationships can be between a fan of Ronnie's notoriety and the management of his beloved team.  The overall themes of enjoying everything life has to offer and triumph of the spirit are emphasized throughout the film.  For those unfamiliar with Ronnie, Hoffman offers a keen insight into the importance we place on our team affiliations which any sports fan can relate to.",1231459200,,837,5.117647058823529

8330610,5,B001OI33II,"I very highly recommend WooLife. This really isn't a movie about the Cubs, though if you are from Chicago or a Cub's fan it will be a very special film. This film is more about having the intelligence and courage to do what you want to do each day because you love it, not because it is easy, convenient, or even really makes any sense. The path to happiness is not an easy one, and there in lies the irony of life. WooLife will show you how to be happy and, in the end, how others will recognize your strength and support you along your journey. I will be watching for the next project from Hoffman. A very intelligent film.",1272326400,2,625,4.216666666666667
8330611,5,B001OI33II,I watched this movie with my family.  It is amazing what someone can do with so much determination and passion.  Paul did a great job capturing Ronnie's life for all to see.  Ronnie's love for the Cubs was depicted so well in this movie.  The Cubs should be proud to have such a dedicated and loyal fan!,1238716800,,303,4.2631578947368425
8330612,4,B001OI33II,"I watched this movie with my 8 year old daughter.  Although we both love baseball we're not devout followers.  And although this movie is defined by baseball, Woo Life is about so much more!  It's the telling of Ronnie's story that kept us glued to our seats.  It's very well done, and I bet someone picks it up for a feature film before the year is up!",1234137600,,353,4.223880597014926
8330613,5,B001OI33II,I first met Ronnie in Chicago in 1996 at a Cub's game with friends and thought he was an ardent Cub's fun. I also met him during several visits to San Francisco at Giant's games and started to hear about his amazing story. I had no idea how intense this story was until seeing this wonderful film. I will certainly share it with my baseball and non-baseball fans alike. It truly is a testimony that the human spirit can overcome even the most horrible adversities and go on to lead a happy life.,1234137600,,495,4.333333333333333
8330614,5,B001OI33II,"It's not just the players whose lives are changed by baseball--we all know countless stories of fans who meet the loves of their lives at a game, develop life-long friendships with people they sit with season after season.  But in WOOLIFE we get to see the inspiring story of a man and a few good people persevere and triumph, after what is entirely too long.

This documentary introduces the world to Ronnie Wickers and in the best documentary fashion, lets him tell his story and dreams.  It is entertaining and heart-breaking, a testament to the human spirit and a true example of the power of community.  The baseball scenes at Wrigley are well-produced, too.",1234051200,,663,4.7894736842105265
8330615,5,B001OI33II,"I was lucky enough to get an early screening of the movie.  What seems to be a simple story has many layers.  And the eye of the director takes a local Chicago sports fanatic/mascot and makes him a person you really care about.

It is a great movie for those who love the Cubs and baseball as there are many interviews and shots of past stars and Wrigleyville.  But it works even better as a story about hope and dreams and never giving up.  It definitely has its share of light moments but its the ones from the heart that you really remember.  I recommend it to all.",1232928000,,568,4.212962962962963
8330616,5,B001OI33II,"Ronnie Woo is a heck of a good guy- an inspiration to anyone who has ever taken the time to get to know him.  WOO LIFE could not have been made any better!  My husband and I went to the premier screening of the documentary in April, 2005.  I cried at his hurt and abuse as a child but laughed and celebrated his love and passion for the Chicago Cubs.  His good buddy Buck O'Neil helped celebrate the evening.

I would recommend WOO LIFE to any and all Cubs fans.  Ronnie is a huge part of the Chicago Cubs and I embrace him each and every time I see him at Wrigley Field.  He is honest, gentle, and has the spirit and love that each and every one of us should have.

Go Ronnie!  Thanks Paul for making this DVD!  I have taught for 30 years and I see the young Ronnie in many of the students I teach.  It breaks my heart every day but I also know that with love, there is hope.

WOOOOOOOO LIFE!!  It is the best!
