8462166,4,B0058P8DII,"A nice, fun family movie from a more innocent time. A touch more violent than the TV series - Ranger Matt Hammond shows some real aggro and shots are acutally fired at Jerry in the helicopter. But it all comes right in the end, with no one the worse for wear. Anyone who likes Skippy will enjoy this movie, and it's great to watch with children or grandchildren.",1370131200,3,362,4.338235294117647
