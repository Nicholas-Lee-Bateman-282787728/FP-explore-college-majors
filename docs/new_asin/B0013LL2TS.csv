3116118,5,B0013LL2TS,"When I bought this movie I did not think it would be this good, As a matter of fact it is GREAT! I liked it and most importantly my girls loved it. I wanted an entertaining way to give them a breif history of the beginning of Islam, and what can be better than a well produced and portrayed cartoon. It gave them so many questions to think about and enlighten their intelligent little brains about Islam and the prophet and why so many events that are regularly mentioned, happened and how it started to make sense to them now.
The audio features were great I wanted them to learn Arabic and this was a great start since their surrounding language is English in school and daily life. The other DVD with the songs was also of a unique nature although I missed Sami Yousif and wished that there would be video clips instead of only audio streams. However the selections were great and we loved them.
Awesome film!!!",1216080000,11,914,4.414201183431953
3116119,5,B0013LL2TS,"When I bought this movie, I was merely curios of what the movie creators have to produce about Islam. However, after watching the movie, i highly recommend everyone to see it, Muslims and Non-Muslims.
The movie creators were sucessful in making a beatiful movie about the birth of Islam. It may not be the best movie ever and there are some main characters and events that were left out but in overall it's a wonderful introduction for those who want to know about the birth of Islam and the Prophet Muhammad(PBUH), whether they were Non-Muslims or Muslims.
The movie is beautifully supported with music, islamic songs and prayers, our Prophet's (PBUH) preaching and some quotes from the Holy Quaran.
I hope you enjoy it the way I did.",1209859200,49,735,4.75

3116136,1,B0013LL2TS,"Full disclosure: My ancestors (or so I have been told) were Jews. I became an atheist at the age of 10 and remain one at the age of 69. I have religious friends and neighbors, but as I live in a mostly Christian nation, most of them are Christians. However, I have had friends who are Muslims in America. So far (I am about a third through the movie), I see no reason to feel any differently about Islam than I do about Judaism, Christianity, Islam, or any other religious belief. 1. We are all going to die; so it's natural to imagine a universe where we have a ""soul"" or ""spirit"" that survives our physical death. However, religious believers do not think through that an ""eternity"" of anything would be Hell. 2. Life is not fair. In this mundane life, the good do not always prosper; the wicked and evil are not always punished. Thus it is natural to imagine ""Karma"" (for reincarnation religions) or Heaven and Hell for Abrahamic religions); that is, some sort of imaginary ""balancing of the books"" that takes place before an impartial, fair, and omniscient deity. Seems obvious to me that no such justice prevails in the universe.

As far as I can tell, no religions have an empirical basis in reality. Personally, I am fairly strongly biased toward science and empiricism. That said, it's better to live in peace and to help each other than to struggle in conflict and to oppress each other. Nothing I have seen so far in the movie has given me any reason to believe that Muhammed was any more in touch with God than Jesus (who may have lived, who may not have lived, the jury is still out) or Joseph Smith (who founded Mormonism, close enough to modern times to reasonably evaluate as nonsense) or L. Ron Rubbard (founder of Scientology) who openly admitted that he was going to create a religion out of whole cloth (usin his skills as a science fiction writer).

It is difficult for different religions to live together in peace. It is even more difficult for religious believers such as Muslims and Christians and Jews and Hindus and Buddhists, etc., and atheists such as myself to live in peace. So this is a test. I have expressed my opinion honestly and frankly, but without intent to offend. If you take the trouble to read this review, can you respond in the same manner?",1368835200,4,2284,4.54126213592233

3116142,4,B0013LL2TS,"Perhaps made to emulate the success of Disney's ""The Prince of Egypt"", this vivid, beautiful and faithful-to-the-sources animated film is a great way to introduce children to the life of the Final Prophet, Muhammad, pbuh. For adults, however, the unsophisticated dialogue and exaggerated intonation in every voice can quickly become a bit grating. Adults will probably watch this once with their children, but thereafter leave the kids to watch it by themselves.",1335484800,7,462,5.430555555555555
3116143,5,B0013LL2TS,I wish more movies of this quality will come out. My self and my family enjoyed watching it. My girls loved it! (they already saw it several times),1333843200,,147,4.285714285714286

3116145,5,B0013LL2TS,It is a very nice movie for the kids no metter which religion. So humanistic and encourages a good character..,1325116800,,110,4.55
3116146,4,B0013LL2TS,"There is a severe lack of decent programing for children dealing with Islam, so this fills a void.  I look forward to watching other productions by these companies, as some projects are promised in the Extras, such as ""Salman, The Persian.""

Unfortunately, there are a few problems with the endeavor, most of them concern minor historical details.  I understand the reason behind them - they would have been too confusing for children and so were omitted.  However, some inaccuracies appear to be pointless - such as Ubaydah (RA) killing his opponent at Badr.  Everything I have read indicates that Ali (KA) and Hamza (RA) intervened in that duel.  Parents may wish to watch the movie with their children and fill in the blanks, as it were, depending on how old the children are.

I notice some people suggesting that this is a good movie for adults as well.  I would suggest that ""The Message"" still remains the best movie I am aware of in that regard.  Even so, this is a solid production and useful for Muslim children.  Buy the product to encourage other productions of this nature!",1315785600,7,1086,4.7287234042553195

3116154,1,B0013LL2TS,This is a propoganda DVD to promote the acceptance of Islam.  It is a childlike presentation with an obvious spin to present Muhammad positively and mentiions nothing of his barbaristic history.,1294358400,13,194,5.258064516129032
3116155,5,B0013LL2TS,"My kids, who are 7 and 10, and I watched this video as part of our effort to learn a little about world history.  This was a very nice introduction to the story of Muhammad and the beginnings of Islam.  Told as an animated adventure film, it easily held our young audience captive throughout the 90 minutes.  The film depicts Islam as a religion devoted to peace, equality among people, and helping others, and it also shows the conditions under which Muhammad sanctioned taking up arms and going to battle.  The video relays the story of Muhammad and early Muslims taking refuge from the idolatrous Meccans in a tolerant, friendly Christian city.  It accentuates commonalities between Islam and Christianity, and hints at the feasibility of coexistence between those two faiths.  The film is creative, yet slightly awkward in working around the admonition not to depict Muhammad himself.  But, just enough so to generate some conversation about that particular facet of Islamic practice - the effect is by no means disruptive to the story itself.  I agree with other reviewers that the video is reasonable for non-Muslims who simply want to gain some awareness, as it conveys the original stories and essential spirit of the faith without overtly proselytizing.  This is one of the kids' favorites on my recommended list of videos covering world history for younger audiences (see ""learning history"" on winstonsieck dot com for the full list).",1290556800,12,1444,5.033613445378151

It is even more difficult for religious believers such as Muslims and Christians and Jews and Hindus and Buddhists, etc., and atheists such as myself to live in peace. So this is a test. I have expressed my opinion honestly and frankly, but without intent to offend. If you take the trouble to read this review, can you respond in the same manner?",1368835200,4,2284,4.54126213592233

For adults, however, the unsophisticated dialogue and exaggerated intonation in every voice can quickly become a bit grating. Adults will probably watch this once with their children, but thereafter leave the kids to watch it by themselves.",1335484800,7,462,5.430555555555555

3350643,4,B0013LL2TS,"There is a severe lack of decent programing for children dealing with Islam, so this fills a void.  I look forward to watching other productions by these companies, as some projects are promised in the Extras, such as ""Salman, The Persian.""

Unfortunately, there are a few problems with the endeavor, most of them concern minor historical details.  I understand the reason behind them - they would have been too confusing for children and so were omitted.  However, some inaccuracies appear to be pointless - such as Ubaydah (RA) killing his opponent at Badr.  Everything I have read indicates that Ali (KA) and Hamza (RA) intervened in that duel.  Parents may wish to watch the movie with their children and fill in the blanks, as it were, depending on how old the children are.

I notice some people suggesting that this is a good movie for adults as well.  I would suggest that ""The Message"" still remains the best movie I am aware of in that regard.  Even so, this is a solid production and useful for Muslim children.  Buy the product to encourage other productions of this nature!",1315785600,7,1086,4.7287234042553195

3350652,5,B0013LL2TS,"My kids, who are 7 and 10, and I watched this video as part of our effort to learn a little about world history.  This was a very nice introduction to the story of Muhammad and the beginnings of Islam.  Told as an animated adventure film, it easily held our young audience captive throughout the 90 minutes.  The film depicts Islam as a religion devoted to peace, equality among people, and helping others, and it also shows the conditions under which Muhammad sanctioned taking up arms and going to battle.  The video relays the story of Muhammad and early Muslims taking refuge from the idolatrous Meccans in a tolerant, friendly Christian city.  It accentuates commonalities between Islam and Christianity, and hints at the feasibility of coexistence between those two faiths.  The film is creative, yet slightly awkward in working around the admonition not to depict Muhammad himself.  But, just enough so to generate some conversation about that particular facet of Islamic practice - the effect is by no means disruptive to the story itself.  I agree with other reviewers that the video is reasonable for non-Muslims who simply want to gain some awareness, as it conveys the original stories and essential spirit of the faith without overtly proselytizing.  This is one of the kids' favorites on my recommended list of videos covering world history for younger audiences (see ""learning history"" on winstonsieck dot com for the full list).",1290556800,12,1444,5.033613445378151
