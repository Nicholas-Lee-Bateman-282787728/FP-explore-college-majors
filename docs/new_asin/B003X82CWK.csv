8407884,5,B003X82CWK,"I am a huge fan of Silent Hill, when I was looking for it I found this special package, Grudge is great too
The only con is that isn't Spanish subtitles, I am from Costa Rica
Awesome collection",1356480000,,193,4.105263157894737
8407885,5,B003X82CWK,"This bundle is a definite must collection for lovers of the cult and alternative horror films. This U.S. version of The Grudge is as scary as Ju-on the original Japanese version, kudos to Sony Entertainment for the hiring the same director Takeshi Shimizu. Sarah Michelle Gellar was so good in this film and so is the rest of the casts'.
  With Silent Hill I simply love that they stayed true with all the great aspects of the video game's atmospheric look and feel and the very poignant ending. Think this is one of the more underrated horror flicks out there that if you haven't seen or played the original video game, quite possibly you might not like nor understand the movie.",1340841600,3,680,4.6115702479338845
