8131608,5,B000GFLEMM,"I might have given this four stars but in light of what I perceive as a rather sour review I wanted to assign five stars to balance things at least partway. This production does have some weaknesses but none of them are disqualifying. The tenor Berti is surely unsubtle but I do appreciate that he's trying to project his voice throughout the Arena. When this recording was taken there was not an audio enhancement system and I can appreciate his insecurity over whether he could be heard. The same thing happens in large opera houses, only one of the reasons why I prefer smaller regional opera.

What makes this the top choice for me is its Italian spirit that goes right to the bone. La Gioconda is an intensely emotional Italian Grand Opera where the characters are under stress and in life and death situations, and Ponchielli exploits every bit of the drama.
For video the use of body mics is essential at the Arena, old recordings without them or too diffuse.
This same basic production is also presented in the Liceu recording on TDK/Arthaus on a smaller (indoor) stage. Using most hanging curtain mics, it sounds like a stampede when cast are walking and the principals are caught more distantly.
Gruber is a fine if under-recorded singer and is emotionally authentic. Same is true for most of the other singers. The lack of ballroom scenery and palace faade doesn't really bother me; I was much more impressed by the sweep of the stage area and the opportunity for long shots to the sides.
The Liceu presentation of this production is also fine with its own pluses and minuses. The Liceu orchestra is better recorded and the Liceu ballet troupe is breathtaking in its precision with mostly the same costuming and choreography. But Voigt is cooler and not as well recorded, and her boobage is not handled well to the point of being distracting. The Liceu has Ewa Podles as La Cieca, although Fiorillo does a fine job here.
The 1980s Vienna production with Domingo and Marton has worn well but is older, and Marton's voice is barely under control at times.
While I enjoy sampling highlights from Liceu and Vienna, the Verona recording is the one I will sit and watch thru.",1415923200,3,2180,4.691906005221932
8131609,1,B000GFLEMM,"this DVD reports one of the worst performances never delivered by a tenor that has been made available to a so wide range of people!!Since the very beginning of his performances, Berti is able to miss any note that Ponchielli wrote in such amazing way. Listen to his ""vituperio!"" and go further to ""Cielo e mar"" and you'll understand what I mean.
Without pointing out that recording has been made at least in 2 different representations (note in Cielo e Mar, once he has microphone and immediately disappear)!!Meaning that even with technology mumbo jumbo was possible to make it better, unbelievable!!!",1258934400,7,603,4.98019801980198
8131610,3,B000GFLEMM,"When I selected this DVD of La Gioconda, I did so without the help of any previous reviews.  I don't like minimalist productions of operas...unless they're free. There are basically no sets to this production filmed in the Verona amphitheater, other than three bridges over what is suppose to be the Grand Canal in Venice. The costuming is uninspired. One would think that someone would have changed their clothes at least once during this production, if for no other reason than to attend Alvise's party.  I've never figure out exactly what the choreography is supposed to be for the Dance of the Hours ballet, but I don't think it would have been danced by ballerinas in pastel colored slips.  As for the singers, I found them adequate and well cast in their parts.  I was going to give this production three stars, deducting one for no sets and a second star for marginally acceptable costumes, but then decided to deduct another star for the make up artist giving La Cieca large red racoon circles around her eyes.",1183766400,16,1018,4.734463276836158
