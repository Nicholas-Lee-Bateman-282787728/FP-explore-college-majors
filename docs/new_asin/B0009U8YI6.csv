8120310,2,B0009U8YI6,I should have listened to those making ratings before me. The only two movies I ended up watching was Bandit King of Texas and Wagon Wheels Westward. Bandit King was the reason I purchased this DVD. The movie was watchable. Roy Rogers' movie flickered so badly I turned it off. Sagebrush Trail is a disaster. The taping is alright. But it is not John Wayne's voice. The opening song is not the usual music for Lone Star productions. That should have been a clue. If you like Rocky Lane movies it is a buy otherwise pass on this one.,1393891200,,532,4.383838383838384
8120311,2,B0009U8YI6,"I cannot really complain, paying only 5 bucks plus for this DVD, however, any prospective buyer should be aware that the 4 films included vary in their clarity.

One thing in particular, concerning the John Wayne SAGEBRUSH TRAIL, the original sound track, at least on 'my' DVD, has somehow been overdubbed with voices that ARE NOT the original actors/actresses.  You will not hear John Wayne's voice on this one, close but no cigar.  I have another copy of Sagebrush Trail and the original soundtrack is there, so why on this DVD, the decision was made to re-record I have no clue.

All-in-all for the price, the DVD is passable. The Allan 'Rocky' Lane movie, King of Texas, is very clear, but the other 3 are below that quality. But again for the money it might serve some viewers.
