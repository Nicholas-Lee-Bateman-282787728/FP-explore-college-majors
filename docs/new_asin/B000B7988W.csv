8082754,5,B000B7988W,"I teach body mechanics and do body work for a living.  When buying a DVD or book on movement or soft tissue manipulation technique, I consider it a good purchase to find even a few useful strategies.  This 2 disc DVD set contains an abundance of techniques that have immediately influenced the progression of my manipulative work as well as how I get into position.  My results using this information have been exhilarating.  My clientele literally demands this work.  WARNING: this is not a mastery in one watching video.  I have been reviewing parts of it every morning for 45 minutes since I bought the DVDs a month ago.  Two recalcitrant problem areas that have responded well to this therapy have been the proximal hamstring/ischial tuberosity area & the posterior margin of the greater trochanter area.  Thanks for reading this review.",1191628800,17,841,4.914893617021277

8082756,5,B000B7988W,"Chuck Duff is an amazing teacher.  I was able to follow along easily with Chuck's clear directions.  This DVD is the best Thai Massage instruction that I have encountered.  I found his focus on good body mechanics very helpful.

Thank you Chuck for sharing your valuable knowledge.
