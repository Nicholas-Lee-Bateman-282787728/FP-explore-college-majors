7879224,4,6304744560,"You may not wanna watch this one with your little brother. Sooo many people die in this movie it's insane. Cool story, plenty of action, original Venoms, need I say more? Sholin gets revenge on Wu Tang, Wu Tang strikes back, back and forth until Wu Tang viscously crosses the line. You have got to see it.",1047340800,3,305,4.368421052631579
7879225,4,6304744560,"This is one of my top five Shaw brother movies. Original VENOMS, cool story, LOT'S OF ACTION. You may not wanna watch it with your little brother because so many people die in this movie. Sholin gets revenge on Wu Tang, Wu Tang strikes back, over and over and over, until the WU Tang commit an unforgivable offense. Bloodthirsty Kung fu fans will enjoy. A must have.",1047254400,4,366,4.477611940298507
7879226,5,6304744560,"The Venoms never EVER cease to stupify me with their hypnotic and god-like martial arts sequences.  Chang Cheh once again takes the helm and the result is a lesson in kung fu perfection.  Granted, the movie does drag in the middle but the beginning contains some of the best fight scenes ever conceived and the end... well if you're a Venoms fan already you know what to expect.  The most insane display or martial ingenuity ever conceived that will blow your freakin' mind and make you nearly jump from your seat and utter profanities uncontrollably.  The Venoms strike again and this is one dose of the poison clan that will leave you intoxicated with wonder and amazement.",1034208000,2,675,4.743589743589744
7879227,4,6304744560,"A treasure for me, as this was a Venoms film I'd never seen or even heard of before spotting it on Amazon.  It's a good print, though not anamorphic as with Five Deadly Venoms and one or two of the others.  The plot is predictably convoluted and lame, but apart from the Venoms (with Philip Kuo Tsui noticeably absent...?!) there are plenty of familiar faces from other Venoms efforts.  The sets and costumes look to have barely been changed from Killer Army, but at the end of the day (or should I say night?  There's something extremely nocturnal about these flicks), who cares as long as the combat's good, and it is.  Lots of treachery, poison needles, ambushes and noble villains, all the classic elements are here.  Highly recommended.",1018396800,2,741,4.705426356589148
7879228,4,6304744560,"Gordon Liu is definitely among the greatest martial arts stars to ever live and this film contributes to that fact. Great fight choreography, wicked training sequences and an abundance of old-school goodness make this flick a must-see for fans of 70s kung fu.",1003536000,,259,5.046511627906977
7879229,4,6304744560,"Well, a good movie, highly thought of. An evil warlord type guy wants to learn both the Shaolin Fist and the WuTang sword,so he tries to convince a teacher from each to teach him. When they refuse he uses manipulation and murder to get what he wants. Each teacher has a student. The two students both go back into training at their respective schools,once their masters are killed and they are turned against each other. In the end though
both must come together to fight the evil warlord type guy. Good Movie - stars Gordon Liu and Adam Cheng.",974073600,,544,4.505050505050505
7879230,4,6304744560,"Excellent classic kung fu film starring Gordon (Master Killer) Liu in which he also directed.  Very memorable and entertaining opening sequence with shaolin monks vs. wutang warrior.  Includes a shaolin training sequence in the same style as ""Shaolin Master Killer.""  Also has a similar ""exhibition"" fight with his teacher (the SAME exhibition teacher as in ""Master Killer""). Great fighting to be had by all!  One of Gordon Liu's better films.  Starts out slow, ends like a firecracker.",970444800,,486,5.259740259740259
7879231,5,6304744560,"Adam Cheng and Gordon Liu play the rolls of two great friends torn apart by a sceaming lord, who wants to see them kill each other, and also learn  both of their respective styles (wu tang sword, and shaolin fist).  Through  a thought out plan the lord get's the two friends to hate each other, and  swear revenge on each other untill they finally  meet in a competition to  see who's style is the best.  Amazing fight scenes, great story line,  training scenes like no others, and a final fight scene that tops many. If  you dont' have this film in your collection then what kind of collection is  it? !",967334400,,604,4.36036036036036
