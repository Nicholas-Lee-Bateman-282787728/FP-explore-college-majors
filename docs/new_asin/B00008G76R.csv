1846443,4,B00008G76R,"Whoa, Rodney, this is for beginners? OK, yes, I feel great after doing the workout. But this is definitely not for anyone who has never taken a yoga class and who doesn't know at least the basic poses. How anyone can support their body weight doing the legs-elevated poses (e.g., pendulum pose) is beyond me. This will probably prove to be especially difficult for women without extremely strong arm and shoulder muscles. I found myself doing modifications on those poses because my jaw dropped watching Rodney Yee doing them effortlessly and calling them ""simple.""

This is very fast-paced, also, but it seems less so after doing it a few times.",1134518400,37,646,4.872727272727273
1846444,4,B00008G76R,"I've never done yoga but I am enjoying doing, or trying to do, these routines.",1125619200,7,78,4.266666666666667
1846445,3,B00008G76R,"For me (I've taken a few intro-level yoga classes), there is too much emphasis on ""power"" in these workouts and not enough on the ""yoga.""  The routine moves very quickly, at least compared with the tempo used by the instructor in the classes I took.  The first time I used the video, I got a little dizzy from having to do the forward bends quickly enough to keep up.  In my classes, I learned (I think!) that the exercise in yoga comes from holding the poses while you breathe, reach and stretch.  On this video -- at least in the movement portions -- the poses are not held long enough to breathe and stretch through adequately.

 The insert inside the video case indicates that Rodney conceived these workouts as a transition for people who have been doing aerobics and are looking for a change, but who may be dubious that yoga can give you a good workout.  That would explain the faster tempo, but it may not satisfy people who don't need to do reps and chart their heart rates to feel like they're exercising.",1123632000,32,1015,4.454054054054054
1846446,3,B00008G76R,"I have been weight training for over 15 years and feel very tight and stiff all of the time.  I wanted to try Yoga to loosen up a bit.  This DVD has helped.

This Flexibility section of the DVD has provided some basic stretching moves that have helped me to loosen up.  I also find that I am standing straighter after the routine.  I also like the relaxation period at the end of the routine.  I find that it works very well.

The DVD's biggest weakness is that it does not spend any time demonstrating how you should execute each position.  Rodney simply tells you the name of the position and he gets into it.  True beginners have no way of knowing if they are doing things correctly.  I would suggest seeking a different DVD is you are a beginner like me.",1121817600,49,758,4.274647887323944
1846447,3,B00008G76R,"I am a big fan of Rodney Yee as a yoga instructor -- I've bought and use almost all of his workouts and I really appreciate his clear and straightforward instruction and the precision of his own demonstration of yoga practice in his videos.  So when I saw this one listed, with a 2004 release date, I was excited at the prospect of adding some fresh variety to my workouts, which I like to do from time to time to keep it interesting and effective.  I was very annoyed, however, to receive it and see that is merely a repackaged edition of an earlier DVD I bought 4 or 5 years ago -- and at that it was only 2 out of the 3 workouts on that older DVD (the 3rd was Stamina)!  Maybe there are some additional special features, but the workouts are the same.  I was torn over how to rate this DVD:  These are great workouts, but if you bought that older video, don't bother rebuying it here.  And I wonder why they dropped the Stamina workout?  That one is also very good -- well rounded and thorough, and short enough to fit in those times when you want/need to do something but can't spare a half hour or more.  Maybe the older DVD is out of print now -- but I'd recommend finding a used copy of that one than only getting 2/3 of it for the same price!",1116806400,51,1250,4.11522633744856
1846448,4,B00008G76R,"I love these because I'm usually combining them with some kind of cross-training (running, elliptical) during my workouts, and it's a great way to get in yoga in a short amount of time (they are about 22-25 minutes each).  They are very relaxing and a great way to stretch out after a workout.  Yee has a calm, soothing voice and the music isn't too irritating.  Stick with it and you will be surprised at how strong you can become, particularly in the arms!  I will mention that the second and third programs do have some positions that are not easy...some involve balancing yourself on just your hands, which I still have not worked up to, and you never want to push yourself into a pose, just work up to it.  But overall, great yoga DVD.",1110412800,17,740,4.451851851851852
1846449,4,B00008G76R,"Despite what other reviews have said, I really like this workout. I had never practiced yoga before and have suffered from a lot of back problems in the past. Once I started doing Rodney's workout, my back problems disappeared. After a couple of weeks I was noticeably more toned (hello triceps!). As far as the quality of the yoga, I can't say, but at the end I feel relaxed and completely stretched out. After a few months this workout seemed a bit easy (so I guess it's time to move on) but I still feel relaxed and stretched at the end, so no complaints. It is short enough that I can do it when I otherwise wouldn't have the time, and once you learn the basic routine, it is easy to follow along with just Rodney's voice and the pace is slow enough to follow but fast enough to break a sweat. I think this is a good workout for those who don't want something incredibly strenuous but want to stretch and increase their flexibility, as well as building a better body awareness.",1098230400,55,981,4.366120218579235
1846450,2,B00008G76R,"This is not a bad yoga workout. The main reason I'm giving it two stars is for deceptive marketing.

When you start this DVD, you will notice the titles include the words ""for beginners"". In the accompanying interview with Rodney Yee, he talks about this being a starter workout, for the beginner. Yet nothing on Amazon or on the outside packaging of the DVD mentions that it is for beginners.

This is very basic power yoga, with sun salutations broken down into smaller and modified bits, and a few basic modified yoga poses. I would not even call it power yoga, as there is no way anyone who has any yoga experience will even break a sweat with this one.

There are two 20 minute routines on this DVD. I bought this to have a nice short routine for days when I don't have time for a full class, or even for 30-45 minutes of home practice. However, I don't find it useful for this purpose. David Swenson's ""Short Forms"" DVD is much better, and offers shorter routines of actual ashtanga yoga poses, in a more logical sequence.",1092441600,232,1028,4.457446808510638
1846451,2,B00008G76R,"My goal as a 39-yr old, fairly athletic man was to learn yoga basics before I embarassed myself in a class at the Y. I wanted to learn some breathing exercises, which were never mentioned here.  I wanted to learn positions too, and at one point Rodney said he would show introductory versions of his more difficult ones (imagine some tripod thing, but angrier), but that never came. He told me to move my ""sip"" bone.  I'm guessing occipital, but how about a little help here? Beginner, hello.
For intermediates this is probably a great workout-Rodney knows what he's doing. As a beginner, it wasn't for me.",1088035200,34,606,4.654205607476635

1846476,5,B00008G76R,"Quick delivery. This is one of my favorite yoga at home programs but as other reviewers mentioned, this series is not for total beginners. If you are looking to move into a more flowing, fast paced practice this is a great starting point. But for someone completely new to yoga, this is not the DVD or the program. No instructions or technique tips are offers and you need to have a basic understanding of yoga postures to follow this practice. When Rodney moves through the Sun Salutations, there is no time to watch and imitate his movements. You need some understanding of what a basic Sun Salutation is comprised of and what a Triangle pose, a Proud Warrior Pose and several others are in order to follow along. But I love this series and and finally replacing my old VHS tapes!!",1412640000,4,783,4.560283687943262

1846478,5,B00008G76R,"I just want to say that Rodney Yee is the BEST Yoga instructor out there. I love his free form style. I'm reaping the benefits of doing Yoga with a back that is now pain free, great health, happy and positive outlook on life. I supplemented that with a vegan diet, and I got a really nice, slim and strong body.

The Power Yoga Strength and Flexibility is a great DVD if you still want to do Yoga, but you're short on time. Been doing it, together with the hour-long sessions (other Rodney Yee DVD's), since 2009. Never got board with it. I bought multiple copies for friends and family members.",1406851200,,595,4.36036036036036
1846479,5,B00008G76R,"I am relatively new to yoga, but not new to exercise. I really like this program. It is short and easy to fit into my day. I like to do it to relax before bed at night. It is perfect for when I haven't been able to exercise and still want to get some movement into my day. The more I practice, the better I get. I have definitely seen an improvement in my flexibility since starting this. Rodney Yee is calm and easy to follow; he gives enough instruction (once you get the basic poses) while still being very relaxing. I feel great when I finish this.",1402617600,,552,4.12037037037037

1846491,5,B00008G76R,"This is a great Yoga video that use poses that really test your abilities and strength. I also love the Stamina version as you hold the posses longer (hence stamina) but Strength has some unique poses that really forces you to use your muscles in unconventional ways strengthening not only your muscles, but ligaments and tendons for an overall flexible strength that you cannot attain through weight lifting alone.",1372723200,,415,5.028985507246377

1846493,1,B00008G76R,"Although I can do most of the poses in this and am suitably challenged by the few I can't (or can't do well), I find this DVD to be, overall, not worth it. Yee is inconsistent both in instruction and in pacing.

Instruction: Sometime he doesn't tell you to exhale or what to do while you're exhaling -- he'll skip over a pose. (You go from inhale back bend to inhale namaste hands, but he didn't tell you that you were supposed to do mountain pose on the exhale. One might say you could get it from watching, but when you're in a back bend, you can't see your television.)

Pacing: If you follow him properly, your breathing cycle can go from inhale and exhale in the same second to inhaling over three or four seconds. I understand that this may be intentional, but he doesn't really give you anyway to gauge which it's going to be until you're in the middle of it.",1353110400,2,866,4.274390243902439
1846494,3,B00008G76R,"I love Rodney Yee, but this particular workout I only give 3 stars because it's repetitive, and some poses are really difficult even for an intermediate like myself, and there wasn't really a good warm-up or cool down.  I feel like I mostly did the following flow over and over again: push up pose, upward dog, downward dog.  He also did a lot of standing forward bends and powerful pose.  Then some very tough balancing arm poses that I really can't even attempt.

I LOVE the other power yoga workouts that it looks like are now sold on separate DVDs (Stamina, Flexibility) but this one I'll probably pass on unless I really want to work my upper body.  It definitely does that.  I'd recommend it for people who want to really focus in on their upper body or for men, who naturally have more strength in that area.

Definitely NOT a beginner workout, so stay clear if you are a beginner.",1339804800,,888,4.478260869565218
1846495,5,B00008G76R,LOVE this DVD!!! I like that yoga sequences are only 20 minutes each. It works for my busy and early mornings. I also enjoy doing the sequences back to back on the mornings I have a bit more time. Rodney Yee is a WONDERFUL yogi! I'd love to take a class with him someday!,1339027200,,271,4.037037037037037
1846496,4,B00008G76R,"I'm not a huge yoga aficionado, as in I like the little bit of it I've done and I'm interested in learning more, but it's one of those things I mean to do and never make the time for.  I like the idea of strength and flexibility from yoga that will complement my usual workout routine (weight lifting, cardio and HIIT) and about a year ago I got a yoga mat that came with a Rodney Yee DVD that I did like, so I gave his Power Yoga DVD a try.  I LOVE that it's short -- anyone can make 25 minutes and make them count! -- and I think it's effective. Some of the other reviews mentioned that he moves fast/the verbal instruction is not always perfectly in sync with what he's performing on the screen, which is true.  If you don't know the basic poses (upward dog, downward dog, powerful pose, etc.) you may want to just watch the DVD a time or two so you can follow his spoken instructions without needing to watch the screen the whole time.  This is a video I can do every day, either first thing in the morning to wake up or as a cool-down after my regular workout.  Hats OFF to ANYONE who can do the pendulum pose; I have a new crazy goal to work for now!",1332201600,3,1156,4.052631578947368
1846497,4,B00008G76R,"This DVD is a little shorter then I need but it does do the trick. I found it a bit easy but I'm almost in the upper advanced level, it is challenging for most if you follow Rodney's DVDs this one is a good progression from beginners. I gave it a four stars because of it's length if it was 90 minutes I would have gave it 5 stars.",1311292800,,331,3.8115942028985508
1846498,5,B00008G76R,"I have never written a review for a product before, but I needed to share how great this dvd is. I was skeptical that a 25 minute yoga workout could do me any good, but this short workout by Rodney Yee works body and mind in a remarkably complete way. It focuses on upper body strength and is challenging enough for me (I have been practicing yoga for 2 years and am in pretty good shape) so that I break a sweat, but because it's only 25 minutes from start to finish there are no excuses to not do it at least once per day. The only problem is that now I am getting a little bored with it. So I am back on amazon looking for another- just thought I'd share. Namaste.",1302566400,4,667,4.022556390977444
1846499,1,B00008G76R,"This workout doesn't flow and is a very boring workout. The half hour feels like 2 hours. Bryan Kest gives a better more intense workout with great flow leaving you feel refreshed as well as having worked muscles and the 50 minutes goes in no time.

1846518,5,B00008G76R,Yet another great DVD with the amazing Rodney Yee.  This video is not too hard but not too easy for me.  I highly recommend it for anyone who is a moderate yogi.,1295654400,,161,4.0
1846519,5,B00008G76R,This is an excellent dvd for the yoga practitioner whither  you are a beginner or a little more advanced. This man's yoga exercises WILL break you off.

1846521,1,B00008G76R,I have several other Rodney Yee DVD's and they are great. This one comes with no verbal direction and no time between transitions to get ready for the next activity. Poorly done.,1283644800,,178,4.59375
1846522,4,B00008G76R,nice workout...but I crave a higher level workout.  Rodney Yee is a true master teacher.  His DVDs are ALWAYS great...but as I have gotten into advanced yoga practices...this one is good for a refresher...but not enough push.,1278028800,,225,5.054054054054054

Also I was aware that this was for upper body and I like that, however the moves are very advanced and if you aren't able to do a handstand forget about being able to do most of this dvd.",1268697600,2,347,3.7260273972602738
1846526,4,B00008G76R,"I wrote another review for Rodney Yee's Power Yoga. What I like about Rodney Yee is that his yoga is gentle, easy to follow and challenging enough to keep you interested and not bored. His DVD's are geared more toward the novice however, yoga is only as challenging as you push yourself. If you are looking for contourted poses, this is not your DVD, if you are looking to get a good workout quickly this one is for you. I like it because the workouts are quick, he doesn't cue the poses in Sanskrit but rather uses the English translations. Plus, he does a good job making you aware of your breathing and where you should focus your attention in the poses.",1262563200,,657,4.39344262295082

1846530,4,B00008G76R,"You really can't go wrong with Rodney Yee. But he does lack the attention to the viewer and practitioner you'll get from Bryan Kest, for example. He doesn't talk to you or about your feelings and the poses are too quick in some places to do much good. A pose should be held about 12 seconds at least. You're in up dog about one to two seconds and must revert to down dog.

Nonetheless, you get a good general physical workout and feel tenseness fade. So this short yoga session serves it's purpose.

Recommended.

1846533,4,B00008G76R,"This DVD is one of Rodney Yee's earlier yoga DVDs, and it shows a bit.  While shot on glorious Maui, the production is a bit more grainy than some of Yee's later projects (""Yoga Core,"" ""Yoga Burn,""), etc.

But you don't buy yoga DVDs for their glossy productions - you buy them for the workout.  And this is a darn good beginner workout, focusing on building strength through fairly quick but smooth transitions.

This workout features a lot of sun salutations, flowing from standing mountain pose through lunges through upward dog and into downward dog.  All these poses are achievable by the beginner, although a newbie should probably watch it through once before trying the workout because Yee goes pretty fast through his paces.  Lots of back and arm-work gets worked into the mix, and you're sure to have your heart rate elevated to a nice degree.

To be fair, there are a couple of poses where the word ""beginner"" doesn't apply - Yee supports his entire body in squat positions on his hands.  No yoga beginner I know could do anything approaching these moves, but they are nice aspirational poses for us beginners to shoot for.

All in all, this is a nice short yoga DVD.  If you have to pick just one yoga DVD, it shouldn't be this one, but at this price it's a good buy to fit into your larger collection.",1241568000,6,1314,4.553191489361702
1846534,4,B00008G76R,"This DVD contains 2 great workouts that have remained a constant in my exercise schedule for years now. Both practices are almost 30 minutes in length and very fast moving. As stated in the title these are `Power practices' so there is a flowing sequence to the poses which includes some jumping. I wouldn't recommend this to the beginner as you will need some basic knowledge of the poses as Rodney moves very quickly from one to the next (sometimes even exceeding his own dubbed in voice instruction) and if you have to keep looking up at the TV you will get left behind and frustrated. However these are great workouts and Rodney Yee's voice instruction is impeccable, there is also excellent background music and beautiful scenery. The only props needed are your yoga mat and a strap.

POWER YOGA FLEXIBILITY has been filmed in Joshua tree national park. This practice includes: Triangle pose, Pigeon and Backbend lunges, Seated and Wide angle forward bends, Cobblers pose, Reclined twist and finally a great relaxation/ meditation segment at then end. This is my favourite of the two workouts.

POWER YOGA STRENGTH is a slightly repetitive practice in that it is a long series of Sun Salutations alternating with advanced arm balancing postures, which you will definitely feel this in your shoulders the next day. It has been filmed on a cliff overlooking a Maui beach, so the scenery's not too shabby. This practice includes Sun Salutations, Exalted Warrior, Side arm balance (bent and straight leg) Staff, Sage and Crane poses, Eastern plank pose, Cobblers and Pendulum pose, Cross legged lunge (in the air) Simple arm balance and a brief relaxation at the end.

Highly recommended for an intense quick workout that's great when you're short on time or have trouble (like myself) getting motivated for a longer workout. Namaste.

Both of these practices are also available on their own; POWER YOGA STRENGTH, POWER YOGA FLEXIBILITY but for a couple dollars more this DVD contains both.",1241395200,3,1991,4.96996996996997

I am still in the process of learning to breath along with the poses as is emphasised in any Yoga practice. Apparently not in his Power Yoga series. It felt as if I was doing an aerobics workout.

Workout is intended for intermediate to advanced level of yoga experties.  It does not provide any instruction describing postures, and includes several postures that will be impossible for beginners and advanced beginners.  The recording quality is fair, with a lot of background noise in both picture and sound.

So, there's the overview.  This DVD features beautiful scenery and an incredibly buff man with bare chest for the women to admire.  Alas, you're looking at the floor or ceiling for 95% of the workout, so that's all irrelevant.  Facing the floor and ceiling is also a problem because the verbal instruction is lousy -- it just names the next posture.  This ""move into posture such & such"" dialog is very poorly synchronized with the video, sometimes leading and sometimes lagging.  Since the entire workout is fast paced, you would need to memorize the workout somewhat to make up for this flaw.  There is a lot of repetition (i.e., same basic sun saluation), so this won't be so difficult -- but you will need to sit and watch the DVD several times before you start.

Several of the upper body strength exercizes are impossible for most people to perform.  There are three different ""fold your body into a small ball and hold yourself up on your hands"" postures.  Few women have the upper body strength to hold themselves up this way, and few men have the flexibility to fold into a sufficiently tiny ball.  You also need to be able to do the downward facing dog for a long time, and be able to do pushups (the real ones on your toes).

Overall, I wouldn't recommend you purchase this DVD.  If you want a combined strength building and aerobic workout, you'll be much better off buying one of ""The Firm"" workouts like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Firm-Total-Body-Toner/dp/B000TJ6P60/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Firm - Total Body Toner</a>.

1846548,4,B00008G76R,"This is an intense, fast moving, almost 30 minute workout that you will definitely feel in your shoulders the next day.  Incorporating challenging arm balancing poses into the sun salutation.

As stated in the title this is a `power' practice so there is a flowing sequence to the poses and it moves very quickly from one position to the next. I noticed that sometimes even Rodney's dubbed in voice instruction had trouble keeping up. Those with a basic knowledge of the poses shouldn't have any problems but be aware that some of the arm balancing postures are quite advanced. The instruction here, although brisk is easy to follow and the workout has been filmed on a cliff overlooking a Maui beach so there's some nice scenery too. The same music has been used here as on other DVDs but you won't mind because it's quite good.

I did find this practice to be slightly repetitive, in that it's a long series of Sun Salutations alternating with advanced arm balancing postures. I would recommend 'Power Yoga Flexibility' over this or better yet both workouts are available on one DVD (Power Yoga Strength & Flexibility) for a few dollars more.

The practice includes; Sun Salutations, Powerful pose, Exalted Warrior, Side arm balance (bent & straight leg) Staff, Sage and Crane poses. Eastern Plank pose, Cobblers and Pendulum pose, Cross Legged lunge (in the air) Simple arm balance and a brief relaxation at he end. The only props needed are a strap and your yoga mat.

This dvd combines two different classes (Flexibility and Strength) that were previously sold as two separate videos. They are both perfect for anyone that is just starting a yoga practice, whether at home or in conjunction with a group class: with this dvd, you get both classes in one dvd, at a bargain price. The two classes are great for getting ready for the more advanced yoga dvd's also offered by Rodney Yee, or any other more advanced classes that the yoga student aspires to. Yoga is a great thing, and I encourage anyone that is ""just thinking about it"" to make the leap and make it a regular practice in their lives: it will bring profound and positive changes to your life in health, well-being, and mental-outlook.

Rodney is a great instructor that is calm and guiding in his presentation of the material.  Though a few poses may present a bit more challenge depending upon how new/strong you are, they are within reach with just a bit of practice.

To the extent that people have mentioned that the cues are off, that was not an issue at all.  After the first or second time you are listening more than watching anyway, though the setting and Rodney's movemments are definately worth watching.

I have used the AM and PM Yoga series as well and those are great too.  This workout I find provides a great base for building and toning muscles in your arms.  I do lift weights, and exercise regularly- including yoga.  The day after doing this DVD, I always notice that my arms feel like they've been worked the same way they would be had I been lifting weights.

1846571,3,B00008G76R,"The Good: Delivers a decent arm/shoulder workout. Puts in a few arm balances. Gets into the workout fast.

The Bad: Pacing is very fast, few poses are held for more than a couple seconds. Apart from a few arm-balances, not much to look forward to.

The Verdict: With only 20 minutes to work with, Yee gives your arms and shoulders an aerobic-yoga workout. Unfortunately, the practice is so short and fast paced, that it stands to be nothing more than a yoga-supplement to a more complete workout.

Full Review: I've been using Yee's ""Power Yoga: Full Body"" for a while now, and thought I'd put some mixture into my routine. As always Yee's calm delivery makes this easy to listen to. I nearly didn't have to watch the DVD before first attempting it, as it's not that difficult to follow-as long as you can move quickly between poses. No, really. Move FASTER!

The pacing of the routine is going to turn some people off, plain and simple. ""Power Yoga: Full Body"" is medium paced, while this is fast paced. Very fast. In fact, you barely have time to hit a pose before moving to the next. The only poses that you'll spend any time in are the arm-balances, and downward-facing dog.

It's a short, accelerated, 20 minute aerobic workout for your upper body, shoulders, arms, and reportedly abs. Realistically, I felt it in my arms, and to some extent my shoulders. After doing to routine a couple of times, I was able to keep pace easy enough, though admittedly I felt like I was really rushing through an otherwise enjoyable yoga practice.

The workout itself is brief, jumping straight into sun salutations (which remain for the entire workout), lots of up/downward-facing dog, standing forward bend, mtn pose, lunges, and a few arm balances and chair poses. You do two or three seated poses, then go into a short relaxation pose.

The obvious question here is why would Gaiam/ Yee make such a short ""Strength"" video? I mean, I did 20 minutes of Intermediate yoga and then had absolutely no problem knocking this one off. In no way am I saying that this workout is easy, but that it really is only worthwhile as a supplement to another routine I'll do before/after it.

In many ways, I just don't feel the workout was constructed well. Why cap a yoga practice at 20 minutes? Apart from a few arm balances, and a lot of downward-facing dog/sun salutations - this really isn't that inventive. Why didn't they put in at least another 10 minutes of arm balances... handstands, shoulderstands, forearm-stands, headstands, something, anything more? I think they could have slowed the pace back down to medium fast and added a few more strength poses to extend the time to 30 or 40 minutes, creating a fuller experience without losing the spirit of the practice.

I like Yee's instruction and delivery, and the DVD is a unique yoga workout-but I can't give it more than three stars. It's fast pace, and brevity make it of limited use to me.",1185062400,42,2931,4.675728155339806
1846572,5,B00008G76R,"I enjoy this DVD.  I bought it some time ago at a Barnes and Noble, and have used occasionally.  Then when I finally decided to fully lose weight and get back into martial arts (which I have done for about 13 years now) I needed something that would help with my conditioning.  This dvd helps with that, I will go running and then come back and do the strength rountine every other day and then on the other days go for a bike ride and do the flexibility routine.  It has since helped with both my overall body strength and flexibility and losing weight (I have now lost 40lbs since February 2007).

As a martial artist these routines are great for contributing to a whole body power that you need in sparring and general fitness.  I was doing weightlifting as well, but I think that the Power Yoga is enough.  Also I like the fact that these exercises are short (appx 20min for each) because I work full-time and go to school full-time.

I would recommend that if you are completely new to yoga, that you first attend a few classes in person first.  This way you can get a hands on instruction so that you learn the postures properly.  I have been to a few myself, and try to go to one or two every now and then.",1181779200,4,1213,4.25764192139738

I've been doing it for about 2 months and my flexibility has increased dramatically.  The first couple times I did this it was a little hard but after awhile it'll be second nature although I still can't do pendulum pose.  Word of advise, be careful when trying pendulum pose, I thought I could do it right away and wound up falling on my face!  To wrap this up, you can't go wrong with this DVD.

Rapid flow almost moves into a cardio workout for short periods

Negatives:

Voice-over narration is behind on-screen poses much of the time

Difficult poses, particularly for a ""beginner"" DVD

Overall, this is a good DVD to use as a variation from other yoga practices, but I don't think I'd want to use it daily because of the level of difficulty for me and the voice-over problems.",1174348800,3,533,5.0344827586206895

1846577,5,B00008G76R,"First a few words about myself so you can more easily judge if my opinion might be helpful to you or not. I teach Power Vinyasa Yoga at a local Hotel Spa Fitness Club. I train every day and prefer complete Power Yoga Flow Routines that challange your overall bodystrength a lot and still contribute to every aspect of Yoga (meaning the meditative aspects, proper breathing, inner awareness and so on).
Since I'm german my english spelling is pretty bad, sorry for that!

About the DVD:
The routine is about 25 Minutes long but still offers you quite a challange for the short time. I can't do 60 to 90 Minutes of Yoga every day, so I'm glad to own a couple of shorter programms for the days in between or for early in the morning.
Rodney Yee is a hihgly skilled Instructor with a very gentil and calm manner and an interesting style of Yoga. His voice is always soothing, but still encouraging.

The programm on the DVD is specially challanging for upper body strength but still working the whole body. It's fluid and, regarding the short time, complete.
The only one little thing I can critizise is that the verbal instruction is somtimes not absolutly in line with the instruction on screen. From time to time Rodny on screen is movin just a little to fast compared to his verbal instruction. But that's not very important and doesn't cause any problems, so I can still rate this 5 Stars.
If your looking for a short physicaly demanding Power Yoga routine, this is for you. It's not suitable for absolute Beginners since Rodny moves pretty fast from Pose to Pose and some are to challanging for an absolute beginner. I would recommend it for intermediate to advanced students.

He also goes a little fast from pose to pose, but after doing the workout a couple times it doesn't seem so fast.
