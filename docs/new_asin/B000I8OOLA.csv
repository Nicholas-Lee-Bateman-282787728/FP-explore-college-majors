2654072,4,B000I8OOLA,"Great DVD for the diehard redhead fans.  Don't like the commentary during the songs, to much fast editing of different concerts.  I prefer one concert and not a lot of editing.  Sound is great and I like the Circle, just bad producing....",1451692800,7,238,4.619047619047619
2654073,2,B000I8OOLA,"I'm very disappointed in this DVD. I hate to say that because I love Sammy's music and also love the CD of this product. My problem with this release is one of many.

First, lots of fast editing. Along with that, each time the camera changes views, any one of the band members are wearing different clothes.... obviously different shows. And I mean it's rampant to the point that it ruins the flow of what you're watching. Then some of the camera footage looks like it was taken from a cheap phone camera. Not all of them, mind you, but quite a bit. Then as reviewer D. Kishinevsky said, there's interviews in the middle of the songs.

Save your money unless you're a completist.",1451606400,4,679,4.467741935483871
2654074,3,B000I8OOLA,"Over the many years my wife and I have collected a lot of rock/metal DVDs. Sometimes we win out, and sometimes we have lost out due to someones bad production call of some kind or another. We bought the double CD set for The Circle a ways back and recently the DVD for it came out so we bought it as well. But, I was blown away when I looked on the back of the DVD  (which is still sealed for the moment while we debate what to do with it) and I found that missing from the DVD (unless hidden some place) are the CD tracks listed as: ""Mikey Bass Solo"", ""Jason Drum Solo/Moby Dick"", and ""Vic Guitar Solo"". Sheesh! All the solos edited out for the dvd? Very disapointing. Now I don't know who made this very un rock n' roll call to leave these off the DVD, but doing something like that seems like commercial pandering at the expense of the great rock/metal tradition of the concert solo by individual band members to show their stuff! Maybe groups that are not yet legendary might question doing a lot of solos in the early stages of a career till more fans learn about them, etc. The world today and its aweful limited attention span isn't the same as it was a few decades ago. But The Circle consists of extraordinary musicians and their solos are as much an important part of the whole experience. We want to see these performances not just hear them on CD. They had a chance to produce this DVD in a way that makes us proud of the guys in the band. At the least, if not put in their proper place on the DVD, they could have at least had them on there as extra bonus features. Sammy comes across as a cool, laid back dude, life of the party. But leaving out these highpoints of individual artistic expression is a bad call IMHO. If anyone knows anything about why this happened and who made the call on this, please do tell and provide some evidence to support your claim.",1450828800,4,1874,4.23463687150838
2654075,3,B000I8OOLA,"Great Songs !! Good sound  !! Mostly good picture ( taken from different shows on all songs ) BUT They decide to talk over all songs !!! just lower the volume of the music , make same commentaries , and raise the volume again, I don't think there is ANY song you can play whitout interruption !!
Can't they make their comments between songs ??",1450742400,8,343,4.276923076923077

2654080,4,B000I8OOLA,"I ordered this because I love the live audio CD of this. I see some have complained about the cutting back and forth between various concerts. Remember though that Sammy did this with VH Live:RHRN. So, I was kind of used to this. This DVD release did seem a little rushed after the release of the CD. As a drummer, I am inspired by Jason Bonham. I love the drum cam shots of him playing. I've said it before, Sammy seems like the ultimate guy just to hang out with. So, the talking between/during the songs seems like Sammy inviting us into his world and lets us fans know that he loves doing these songs as much as we love hearing them..WELL!",1454630400,3,643,4.278688524590164
2654081,1,B000I8OOLA,"I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this DVD. After hearing the CD, I was excited to watch what I thought was the full live show. Instead, it turns out to be 5% actual live footage, edited clips from multiple other shows, and commentary all throughout that interrupts the music. My personal favorite is when Sammy talks about how great a guitar player Vic is DURING HIS ENTIRE SOLO!!! This reminds me of every crappy ""live"" VHS that came out in the ''80's. Total bummer :(",1454371200,6,484,4.511363636363637
2654082,2,B000I8OOLA,"The band is great but the production is horrible, like everyone says the interruptions ruin it. It should have been a bluray release with dts option, no interruptions, and no quick camera movements. I can't understand how something like this was released.",1454025600,2,255,5.095238095238095
2654083,4,B000I8OOLA,"A decent DVD. It didn't need all the talking over the songs thought.  The directors/editors ""creative choices"" didn't help this concert. I just wanted to enjoy watching these guys perform and put on an awesome show since I didn't get to see it live myself. It would've been better.",1453852800,,281,4.73469387755102

2654087,2,B000I8OOLA,"Worst DVD Sammy has ever put out.  Gave it a 2-star versus a 1-Star only because the songs still rock.  The DVD was put together from at least two concerts and you can tell.  It keeps jumping from footage to footage within the songs.  It is like watching the previews of a movie.  There is also no indication of the sound quality either so there is no option for Dolby 2.0, Dolby digital, nor DTS.  The sound and quality of the video are both poor as well.  I agree with other reviews about the talking clips, some which can barely be heard, during the songs.  Very annoying and useless.  I will continue to watch while exercising but I am very disappointed.  It should have been one concert filmed and talking only before a song.  I hope they do ""the Circle"" justice by hiring another producer who can put of a much better product.",1452816000,8,832,4.372549019607843

2654089,3,B000I8OOLA,"Minus 1 star for quick camera cuts/editing. Why go for  seizure inducing visuals?  I don't need to see Sammy wear 5 different shirts during one song nor do I need to see what every band member is doing every 3 seconds. Minus another star for commentary during performances. Why would you interrupt the momentum/continuity of a live performance by jumping into the studio or interview room for supposedly candid talking. Overall, the performance of the band is stellar and song selection draws on Montrose/Van Halen/Led Zep & Sammy solo - excellent stuff. It's a shame they mucked this up with the choices they made.",1451865600,8,615,4.903846153846154
8144496,1,B000I8OOLA,"A video by Sammy and for Sammy, this is a joke. Thanks Sammy for wasting my hard earned money,not to mention my time watching,or should I say,my time trying to watch this unbearable piece of sh@#!  The audio is incredibly horrible and the video is even worse. Not only does it jump scene to scene in half second intervals,but putting in useless clips of you talking during EVERY song? Sammy talks about how great the musicians are, then drops the volume and puts in those lame clips during their solo's. I did notice he did NOT do it anytime while HE was singing or playing a solo. These MUSICIANS deserve much better representation than what is shown so poorly here. These guys are top notch players but you can't see it on this dvd, just mere glimps and then right back to Sammy, the very least talented member in the band. Sammy also talks about how this is a band, yet this is completely a Sammy dvd, doing nothing but telling us how great and how cool Sammy is.  Yeh, we get it, your just a cool, rock & roll legend in your own mind,Sammy, keep tellin' us,maybe someday we'll believe it almost as much as you do. Problem is, you gotta put something out with some quality to it.",1516492800,,1182,4.368181818181818
