5130714,5,B0084I7OJ0,"Mary Silliman is a superb video for showing to high school students. I have used this video for several years to explore the costs of war during the American Revolution.  The Silliman family lives in Connecticut between the hotbed of rebellion in Massachusetts and the Loyalist colony of New York. As an American Studies teacher, I have used the relationships in the movie to explore gender roles between male and female, how different the slave is treated, the role of the indentured servant girl, the moral choices of the profiteer, Mr. Hawley, and the effects that war had on neighbors with different ideology towards the war.  There is no offensive language or nudity in this film and violence of war is minimal. Since this movie is based on the diary of a real woman from this era, I believe it gives an accurate depiction of her life in the revolutionary era.",1350777600,,865,4.7218543046357615
5130715,5,B0084I7OJ0,"Mary Silliman's War tells the story of one woman's tragic experiences during the Revolutionary War.  It is based on letters and documents from her life.  She was married to the State's Attorney for the newly created state of Connecticut.  Her hometown of Fairfield  experiences the not uncommon divisiveness  of the war as neighbors align themselves with the Loyalists sympathetic to the crown and the Patriots determined to be free from British tyranny.  Numerous themes are woven throughout the plot which centers on Mary's attempts to arrange the release of her husband who was kidnapped by Loyalists and is being held in British custody on Long Island.  Slavery,gender roles,religion and the brutality of war are explored in this well-acted dramatization.  Over the years, my high school students have given this film a positive review.  It brings to life the effects of the Revolution on ordinary folks by being not only historically accurate but very realistic in its portrayals.  Suspense builds throughout the film as Mary meets obstacles in her quest to get her husband returned.  I highly recommend this film for the high school, college and adult education classroom.

5130716,5,B0084I7OJ0,"This film contains all the information you'd need for an intelligent discussion about the Revolutionary War (and more), while being entertaining enough to stand up to any blockbuster. Love the characters and how they make this well-worn period of history come alive again.",1350000000,,272,5.348837209302325
5130717,5,B0084I7OJ0,What a great experience for high school students! This is the Revolution from a woman's perspective. It also makes it clear that the conflict was a civil war to Americans who lived through it.,1349654400,,192,4.676470588235294

8525130,5,B0084I7OJ0,Very interesting story.  Made more so because they are relations on my mother's side of the family.,1459209600,,99,4.823529411764706
8525131,2,B0084I7OJ0,"The book by Joy Buel was well written and very interesting about the life of a woman during the American Revolution. This film evidently sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts is grim, not well dramatized, and was clearly done by amateurs.  This is not worth the high price. Read the book instead, or watch the HBO John Adams series, which was so well done. The actors in this production, Mary Sillimans War, are like a group of community players or high school theatricals.",1438819200,,484,4.694117647058824
8525132,5,B0084I7OJ0,"An excellent movie that brings the Revolutionary War into focus in the lives of the people. Not a lot of ""fighting"", but an aspect of the Revolution we don't often see.",1386374400,,168,4.451612903225806
8525133,5,B0084I7OJ0,Excellent presentation of a trying chapter in a woman's life during the American Revolution. An individual who is required by circumstances to perform beyond the usual for that  period of time. Well acted.,1385942400,2,205,5.212121212121212
8525134,5,B0084I7OJ0,"I originally decided  to view this film based upon a simple synoposis. The film portrays the struggles of a woman in revolutionary Fairfield, Connecticut when her state attorney husband is kidnapped by Tories. His work as the state attorney resulted in the sentencing to death of two young Tory boys for their work in aiding the British. In retaliation, relatives and fellow Tories launch a raid on the Sillimans home, take Selleck hostage, and quickly condemn him to death. With this cursory understanding of what to expect, I took up to review this film, only to discover its intimate connection with real primary and secondary material.

Not only is the film accompanied by a study manual that describes some of the themes to be found in the film, it is supported by the weight of primary documents in the form of Mary Silliman's correspondence and journal as well as relevant material describing the reality of 18th century New England. The film is directly grounded by a scholarly biography of Mary Silliman by Joy Day Buel and Richard Buel, Jr., entitled The Way of Duty: A Woman and Her Family in Revolutionary America, published by W. W. Norton in 1984.

As a result, the film is firmly intertwined with primary and secondary sources, and I can honestly say it is one of the most accurate representations of historical events from the 18th century that I've ever seen. Another major component of my positive impression of this film is the purpose of the film. It is clear that the director, as well as Richard Buel and the historical consultants working on the film, were aiming to portray the complexities of revolutionary New England. The study manual points to four themes that the production team sought to incorporate in the film: ""The Revolution Considered as Civil War""; ""Gender Roles""; ""Religious Culture""; ""Social and Family History""; and I would add ""Race and Class relations"".

The Revolution depicted in this film offers a clear indication of the intense civil war that accompanied it in communities just like Fairfield, Connecticut. Intense divisions amongst loyalists and patriots were acted out in the same court proceedings as the one depicted in the film as well as the social tensions that accompanied it. Mary's struggles also depict the assumed roles of women in society and how she came to fit into, and circumvent, those notions. In one scene, Mary delivers a petition to the Governor of Connecticut hoping to elicit his help in securing her husband's release. Not only that, she even begs leave to make a comment on politics even though she recognizes it is not a place for her sex.

The film explores all of these themes. These themes are the very contribution this film has made to my understanding of the American Revolution. When the film was released in 1994, these themes were quite relevant to the historiography. So while I may have been aware of these themes and the complexity of communities like Fairfield, Connecticut, the film helped merge them into a cohesive portrayal of how all of these themes interacted with one another on a daily basis.

In all, I cant recommend this film enough for anyone interested in seeing an actual accurate portrayal of a small town in revolutionary New England.",1363564800,5,3237,4.897810218978102
8525135,5,B0084I7OJ0,"I've been using Mary Silliman's War in my United States History class for several years now.  Mary's is an amazing story, all true and based on her letters.  The film is beautifully done and engrossing to watch.  It communicates so many aspects of those revolutionary times: the torn loyalties, the religious and moral underpinnings of colonial life, the tenuous self-government of the fledging nation during wartime, the deep divisions between British and American lifestyles, and the very real day to day hardships required of those who sought independence.  Every year I ask my juniors if I should show the film to the following year's class.  The answer is always a resounding yes.  Great film.",1359936000,4,698,5.078947368421052
8525136,2,B0084I7OJ0,"Granted I had to watch this movie for class and write a paper for it. I'm sure it's a good movie in its own right, but I didn't like it.",1358121600,,136,3.566666666666667
8525137,5,B0084I7OJ0,"This did the trick.  It's exactly what I needed for class.  According to my professor, it's accurate as well. Well",1353024000,,114,4.65
8525138,5,B0084I7OJ0,"This movie is an excellent source for teachers.  As an AP US History teacher, I have seen many reference it on the AP list-serv, and reviews of it are glowing.  I have shown it to my American Studies students for years, and they truly enjoy the story and characters.  Told from a female perspective, it addresses the American Revolution in an interesting and informative manner.  Gender relations, religion, duty, and morals are all included.  My students even enjoy the writing assignment that I have them complete.  I'm definitely planning on using this video for years.",1350777600,,572,4.968421052631579
