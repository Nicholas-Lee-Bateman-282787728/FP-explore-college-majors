8297319,4,B001EAWMO2,Great fun. Great indie cast by Directed by an amazing Indie director.  If you want to have some light hearted fun its a good choice.,1471996800,,132,4.28
8297320,3,B001EAWMO2,"Splatter Disco is a decent, but not great indie horror/comedy/musical. It is seriously lacking on the horror side of things, with only a handful of onscreen deaths, most of which don't show much ""splatter"". What makes Splatter Disco worth watching for indie horror fans is the casting. Trent Haaga, Debbie Rochon, Lynn Lowry, and Ken Foree all appear. And Lynn Lowry is especially good, playing a mayor's devious mother. Debbie Rochon even has a brief nude scene. First time in a while that I've seen her ""Rochon's"". Anyway, Splatter Disco isn't for everyone, but it's worth watching if your a fan of any of the aforementioned actors.",1304640000,2,634,4.934579439252336
