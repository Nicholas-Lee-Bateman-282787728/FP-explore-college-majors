1388596,4,B0000524ED,"I teach aerobic kickboxing and I purchased this video to get a look at some different moves.  Although the video is not extremely high tech, it does have a good variety of basic and more complicated moves.  I also liked the idea of getting two workouts on one DVD.  The second workout is more complex than the first, but is in no way overwhelming.  Overall, this DVD was worth the purchase and I was not dissapointed.",1003449600,16,417,4.447368421052632
7929808,5,B0000524ED,I have had and used the VHS for this since i came out!,1485734400,,54,3.230769230769231
7929809,4,B0000524ED,Great workout video. . I never got bored with this one. I bought it first in a $10 clearance combo (10 fitness dvd set) from a store & loved it. But I lost it and find its worth buying it again for the higher price.,1470873600,,215,3.8
7929810,5,B0000524ED,"I lost almost 100 pounds doing the first video, yea, not a well done video, but the work out is great.",1330560000,,102,3.9047619047619047
7929811,4,B0000524ED,"This video is not as awful as some of the reviews make it out to be.  Yes it is low budget, and sometimes the cues and voiceover is a little off, but overall the workout is a solid one, especially for people that are new to working out or haven't worked out in a while.  I had the original Kick Butt workout on VHS tape when I was senior in high school trying to lose weight to join the Air Force.  I did this workout 3 days along with running and I lost 15 pounds in about 2 1/2 months.  This workout is functional and does what is supposed to do, its just not pretty.",1325721600,,569,3.9217391304347826
7929812,4,B0000524ED,"This DVD gets a bad rap but personally, I have been using this video for years.  In fact, I have two copies. The obvious comparison is to Tae Bo and since I own both products, here is my two cents...

The Kick Butt Combo isn't the Hollywood production number that Tae Bo is however, I am interested in a good cardio routine and not flashy production or celebrity status.  More importantly, The Kick Butt Combo isn't as fast as Tae Bo videos nor do I find the moves as jarring.  The older you get the more important this becomes.

Kick Butt I is 20 minutes of good cardio, followed by a short weight training section, followed by an ab workout and ending with stretching.  In 45 minutes you have all you need.  No, I can't understand what the Italian instructor is saying either but I just follow along just the same.

Kick Butt II is slower paced than Kick It I and it has more of a boxing format, which I happen to like.  It ends with a section that uses a chair and works the legs.  Though each Kick Butt is similar, there is enough of a difference to have both.

Tae Bo made one attempt to market a slower video to the over 40 crowd - Tae Bo Gold(VHS only).  It was a good idea but the overall quality of the video was horrible.  Billy Banks never tried again because his real market is the 20 something crowd.

If you are in extremely good shape go with Tae Bo Get Ripped Advanced or Tae Bo Total Body Fat Blaster.  These are both intense workouts!!  If you ain't 20 anymore or you need to lose at least 20 pounds, I would recommend the Kick Butt Combo to you.",1117670400,2,1564,4.1806020066889635
7929813,3,B0000524ED,"Kick Butt 2, led by a professional instructor, has good cuing and instruction. It's 40 minutes. She also does a good bonus instruction on technique.

Kick Butt (45 mins) is led by a European kickboxing champion. His form and flexibility are inspiring. His English and cuing are light, and the instructional voiceover is like an afterthought. The routines are simple, and if you have kickboxing experience, you'll have no trouble following along. There's a terrific bonus arms workout, followed by mat work and a thorough stretching cooldown.

That said ... the production quality in KB1 is abysmal. Both students show terrible form. One, an actual fitness instructor, looks more made up for the nightclubs than for a good workout. She looks seriously bedraggled at the end of the workout. The dimly lighted set looks more like a medieval torture chamber than a boxing gym. And, the cutesy camera angles (such as zooming in on a speedbag as the exercisers work out in the background) are an annoying distraction.

Otherwise, the instructor is very likeable and the workout is a good one. Consider this DVD is you love kickboxing. If you're new to it, try Donna Richardson's 3 Day Rotation. Her 20-minute Kick & Jab is dynamite, with thorough and fun instruction throughout.",1096416000,,1272,4.990566037735849
7929814,3,B0000524ED,"This kickboxing workout is much better if you do the SECOND one with the woman instructor.  The first is odd, where the instructor cues poorly and there is a weird voiceover sometimes (sometimes with the wrong cue for what he's doing).  He looks like a boxer-- and while the workout would be okay if you had enough patience to figure out what they were doing, it's just hard to follow and weird.
But the second one had me feeling worked out, and happy--it really released my inner ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"".  The section where she works the legs would be dangerous for anyone who wasn't already a bit fit, however, so skip that unless you know what you're doing and get a DIFFERENT floor leg workout.  You also need an additional ab workout (you get some ab work with all the high kicking-- if you kick high enough, but most people won't find this obvious) and you might want to jog for a little while (maybe just 15 minutes-- it'll give you a fulll 45 minute workout if you do) before or after to get a really hard sweat going.  But all in all, this SECOND workout gets the arms & legs really well, and is fun.
This second video is good for variety-- if you're tired of the same tapes all the time.  I wouldn't get it as your primary workout-- but if you want to see someone new now and then... it's worth it.  (The second one-- I know I said that before-- but I can't emphasize it enough).",1080691200,2,1392,4.310344827586207
7929815,4,B0000524ED,"If you've had some experience with martial arts and know how to punch and kick, you'll probably enjoy this more than the other kickboxing videos.  Kathy Smith is great at making workout videos, but would you trust her to land a punch on you that would do any damage?  Nope.  Wimpy punches and kicks are annoying.
It's true the backup people in theses 2 workouts don't really know as much as the lead instructor, but if you follow the lead instructor you will get a great workout.  Also the butt exercises in the 2nd workout, really get you in shape.",1078963200,9,549,4.46
7929816,1,B0000524ED,"I recently received 14 workout videos and this one is the worst out of them all. first off there is a guy that doesn't speak English that well. He is guiding you through your workout.. He doesn't count off the exercise he is on, the warm up is not long enough and  he switches to the next exercise with no warning. ON top of him talking there is a women talking over him telling you what to do after he has switched to the next exercise. If you look at the soap opera actor in the back he is not doing the exercises correctly. I ended up stopping the video and putting in  one that proves to be more professional and user friendly.. IF you want a good kickboxing workout try Kathy Smith kickboxing workout or any of The Firm Videos... They have many different workouts on one DVD..Making it more bang for your buck..",1069372800,,816,4.258064516129032
