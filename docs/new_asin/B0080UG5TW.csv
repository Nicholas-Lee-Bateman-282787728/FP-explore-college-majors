8523799,4,B0080UG5TW,"""In The Beginning"" is the first episode of the remake of the Biblical animated series made by CBN or Christian Broadcasting Network known as Superbook back in the 1980's. This was made for today's generation of children. The characters involved in it are Christopher Quantum,Joy Pepper and the robot Gizmo,which are Christopher Peeper,Joy and the wound-up toy robot named Gizmo.

It starts when Chris and Gizmo are trying to eavesdrop on the door of Dr. Crispin Quantum,who apparently was busy with a new invention. Later,Joy caught them as well as the Dr. Quantum that made the laboratory dirty. As things were falling,Superbook surprisingly appeared and brought the trio - Chris,Joy and Gizmo - back in time. They find themselves at the several incidents such as: God's creation of the world;the battle between God's angels and the fallen angels that eventually led to the fall of Lucifer;meet the first man and woman in Adam and Eve; and witness the fall of man after the fruit of the forbidden tree was eaten after the successful temptation of the serpent. Their journey ends when the trio together with Adam and Eve leave the Garden of Eden. Later,the trio meet Dr. Quantum and apologized for their actions after learning the valuable lessons concerning obedience and following orders.

The new Superbook will definitely provide great CGI effects that will astound viewers from all ages. The animation is well-done. It will definitely surpass the old series which is too be expected considering it is thirty years advance. What is just somewhat discomforting about it is the story has somewhat left behind. It did not become the central part of the series. It was diminished into the background.

I feel that the Biblical stories should remain central to the story for this is what made CBN successful with the Superbook series in the 80's. Children enjoyed the stories and the characters. Don't forget the lessons learned as well. Not the CGI effects which proved to be always have the tendency to become the main attraction of the episode. Creators should not overdo them.",1444608000,3,2079,5.002890173410405
