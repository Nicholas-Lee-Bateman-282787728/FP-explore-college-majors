8354534,1,B000KC8NF2,"This video was about as fun as dental work (with apologies to my excellent dentist).  The instruction was lacking,  the trainer lacked charisma and energy, and even he had difficulty with some of the moves.  Combining the balancing with the strength work takes practice and coaching, but the trainer just went into each move without any kind of information about how to do so.  (I've worked out for years, but would have needed help finding ways to do the upper body work while standing on one leg.)  I went to Target after watching the dvd once and bought The Firm for $12.00 (rather than $19.95), which is much better and more effective.

8354535,5,B000KC8NF2,"I was having problems with my right leg; andeed, I had a noticeable limp. Rather than take my internists suggestion and consult with an orthopedic surgeon, I took my problem to my wife's personal trainer, Benjamin Cox. Under his guidance, I now regularly do sets of stretching and balance exercises, and my limp is gone. The DVD allows me to follow his lead and exercise at home. My overall feeling of healthiness has improved greatly. I highly recommend it.
