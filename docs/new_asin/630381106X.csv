Here is the Bond man again as Mike Graham.
In this one you see a mutual chemistry between Graham and Sabrina.
He orders vodka martini, straight  up with a twist.
This one could have been longer too.
It was unusual  seeing Pierce with long hair, but you get the feeling by the opening that  he just got back from this mission before they send him off to help Sabrina  on a mission, and he just didn't have time for a hair cut and  shave.
Anyway, he still looks great to me.",928454400,8,535,4.096153846153846
7853602,4,630381106X,"I never even saw the first movie but you don't have too. Pierce Brosnan showed that he could be James Bond in this performance. He played Michael Graham, an United Nations agent with Alexandra Paul (Baywatch) who played Sabrina Carver on a case to find ""The Night Watch"" painting stolen in Europe and located in Hong Kong. The film was based on Alistair MacLean's novel of the same name. The television movie was shot on location in Europe and Hong Kong with a great cast such as William Devane and Rolf Saxon as supporting players. Paul and Brosnan have some chemistry on screen and there is a usual chase throughout Hong Kong. If you want an entertaining film with Pierce Brosnan and Alexandra Paul, you will enjoy this action packed film.

There are no special features for the DVD to mention about the film. They could have added some features like the first film to help explain the Alistair MacLean series or anything about the author and the novel.",1522108800,,955,4.650887573964497

7853606,3,630381106X,"Interestingly I am the first person to rate three stars. Apparently you love it or hate it.

What you have here is a James Bond movie without Bond. Maybe. Envision Brosnan in his Bond capacity and you have a standard Bond film. But otherwise it doesn't work so well. We accept that in the casino, James Bond will always hit the card he needs. When Brosnan hits a six card blackjack hand on the second deal, it is not believable. Nor is the way everything else magically falls into place. Alexandra Paul only got the role because of Baywatch, but she isn't sexy here in the least, and her acting is predictable.

I have not seen the first Detonator, maybe that changes how someone sees this one. But on its' own merits, this is not a bad film but there is nothing in the least outstanding about it.",1424563200,,797,4.378378378378378
7853607,4,630381106X,"Although the DVD says it was based on Alistair MacLean's novel it was not.  It was based on a Alistair MacNeil novel which was based on an outline by Alistair MacLean. But that doesn't much affect my review its still a pretty solid action outing for a tv movie.  While the first Detonator was pretty much a special ops story this one seems like it was an audition for James Bond for Pierce Brosnan.  It has the hero beating his rival at cards, the at times vicious bickering between Mike and Sabrina is toned down a bit in the second outing in favor of a more flirtation relationship,  a smash crash fist fight with a super strong henchman, a marriage cover with the leading lady, two gorgeous girls (although our hero doesn't exactly make it with either the attempt is hilarious though), a megalomaniacal plot with a super destructive weapon, and the action scenes are a bit more slick rather than the special ops type of the first film. If you like action thrillers of the nineties or Brosnan as Bond you will no doubt like this Brosnan and Alexandra ""Bay Watch"" Paul are both at the height of their sexiness and have a good chemistry in this made for tv flick.  I have watched this many a times and still enjoy it today.",1417219200,2,1223,4.441964285714286

7853610,2,630381106X,"Pierce Brosnan is back as a government soldier/agent, this time looking for whoever stole a famous Rembrandt painting and replaced it with a forgery. Working with a female agent played by Alexandra Paul they travel to Holland where they find the painting in the possession of a businessman. He has a deal with gangsters from Hong Kong that involves a computer chip that can be planted in any telephone and then controlled by a satellite he has invented and plans to launch into space.

Detonator 2 is a little more light hearted in tone than the first one but its really no better of a movie. The plot is convoluted and dopey. The acting is somewhere between amateur and people hired from the local mall. William Devane hams it up during the action-packed but wholly unbelievable ending and then its over, leaving you feeling cheated out of quality entertainment.",1296259200,,863,4.791946308724833
