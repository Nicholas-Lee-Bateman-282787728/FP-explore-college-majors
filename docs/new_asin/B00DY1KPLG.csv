5864326,5,B00DY1KPLG,"I'm going to be completely honest here, I bought this movie for myself and I'm glad I did. My little cousin adored this movie and so did I. The thing I respect about these movies is that even though they're aimed for a little girl demographic, they still attempt to be likable for an older audience; That way it isn't painful for older family members to sit through. No matter what's going on in Monster High, there's ALWAYS something interesting to see; all of the designs are extremely creative and there's an abundance of Monster puns(Seriously, student DISEMBODIED president, why didn't I think of that?) The characters are extremely cute and likable and all the diverse monsters embrace they're quirks and it teaches kids to embrace what makes them unique. The major downside of this movie and all monster high movies is that it could be really clichd; this wouldn't bother me too much but it's especially irksome because I think things like the the one-dimensional bully characters clash with the overall message of tolerance to others. But aside from that, the movie's are cute and fun for all ages. The fact that it genuinely makes an effort to be fun for everybody(and the fact that the animation is spooktacular!) is the reason why I'm an 18 year old male who can't wait for the next Monster High Blu-ray!",1381449600,32,1315,4.746724890829694
5864327,5,B00DY1KPLG,My daughter loves monster high. To be honest I enjoyed watching it too. These movies just get better each time.,1381449600,2,111,4.6

5864329,5,B00DY1KPLG,"I purchased this DVD today for my daughter.  She and I are Monster High fans.  We watched the DVD as a family including the hubby.  It is really good and we stopped the DVD and discussed how this DVD is related to ""real life issues"".  For example, we all have 2 inner voices:  good & evil.  Choosing which voice to listen to will determine your journey.  Plus, other details, without ruining the movie for those who have not seen it.  This dvd has a message for ALL viewers.  Enjoy!  Highly recommended & good price (to be honest, I purchased my copy from Target & got 5% off).",1381190400,25,577,4.308411214953271
5864330,5,B00DY1KPLG,"Monster High: 13 Wishes is yet another step up in quality for the Monster High film series. I was impressed at how much better the editing and story telling was handled. While Friday Night Frights, Why Do Ghouls Fall In Love and Ghouls Rule are all good movies, they are more of an extended Saturday morning cartoon affair. 13 Wishes improves in all ways, without losing the core of what makes Monster High so enjoyable.

Nearly all the guys and ghouls make an appearance in the movie, even if it's just a short cameo. There are also a nice variety of outfits that the ghouls wear throughout the film. The new characters Twyla, Gigi and Wisp are all interesting and likable. The story teaches the importance of appreciating what you have, who you are and the benefits of selflessness. The lessons are taught in an entertaining manner and don't come off like a cheesy Saturday morning special.

I am a twenty seven year old male fan of Monster High and I would gladly recommend this movie to any fan of animation. I think it goes without saying that existing fans of Monster High will love this movie, young or old.",1381190400,49,1114,4.565

5864332,5,B00DY1KPLG,"I love all the movies from Monster High, but this one has such a great sense of pace and build up and all around story.  It was definitely my favorite one of them all. 13 Wishes introduces a few new characters(Gigi, Twyla, Whisp), gives us hints at characters to come(Wydowna Spider, Catty Noir), and even has easter eggs of Ever After High.  This movie is clever, funny, and somewhat more mature than some of their other titles.  I highly recommend it.",1380672000,23,453,4.567901234567901
5864333,5,B00DY1KPLG,Best movie I've ever seen!!! I recomend it to any ghoul who loves Monster High. Go buy this movie now!,1380585600,8,102,4.15
5864334,4,B00DY1KPLG,"I purchased this movie for my Goddaughter, and I to watch we're both Monster High doll collectors,, I thought the storyline was very cute, and it kept my attention from beginning to end.. Mattel did a great job introducing the new charactors , I especially liked Twyla, and her raspy voice.. The scenery colors , and costumes were beautiful , catty Noir was absolutely stunning,, I wish Mattel would've showed the entire performance by her,, ""side note"" -""Mattel make a music video with Noir singing the same song""... My 10 year old Goddaughter was thrilled .. Great job Mattel, keep the adventures coming.",1380499200,28,606,4.893203883495145

5864339,5,B00DY1KPLG,"This movie is a good spin on an old tale. Howleen finds a magic lamp that gives her 13 wishes. Gigi Grant is the genie, and Djinni ""whisp"" is the evil twin genie who misdirects Howleen into making selfish, harmful wishes. Howleen aspires to popularity, and needless to say, it gets out of hand. Howleen's friends have to save her and Monster High from the shadow people taking over their lives. It's not scary, but the ghouls do face the evil whisp and her posse of shadow figures. My favorite part is when the main ghouls get banished into the genie lamp. They get new attire, and the lamp is a labyrinth of rooms and booby traps. This is definitely on our fave list of Monster High movies! It's fast paced, and covers the perils of popularity and being less than popular.",1474588800,,773,4.450704225352113

5864345,4,B00DY1KPLG,"I initially was very against my daughters owning Monster high anything. But after watching a few of the movies I have to say that the overall message of loving yourself and your friends no matter if they look or act differently is a great message. 13 wishes also teaches about being happy with what you have, working for what you want and recognizing true friends. This movie was well written not corny like many Barbie movies. The story progressed smoothly and even for a children's  movie keeps even adults engaged and rooting for Clawdeens sister. An excellent story and movie",1457395200,,579,4.79

The lesson in the movie is about selfishness & I think it does a good job of getting through to girls, on topics valid to their lives. Topics, such as; popularity, wining over kids at school (school office), treating people how you want to be treated & quite a few others.

The main messages in this movie are ""listen to what you know is right in your own heart,"" ""be a loyal and caring friend/sister,"" and ""resist acting upon bad thoughts coming from others or within yourself. "" I was disappointed that the girl ghouls wear extra high heels and very short skirts.  The story and message were good enough for me to let my girls watch anyway. After all, fictional cartoon dolls don't have to worry about sprained ankles, and Monster High dolls are very stylized artistically anyway (fur, fangs, gils, rainbow colored skin, etc). After droning on about stuff like that, my girls realized they would have to continue wearing leggings or playground pants under their skirts and save the heels for home dress-up or after their feet are fully grown.",1395014400,,818,4.801418439716312

The story has a good moral.  The friends show what caring about each other means and how important that can be.  It also shows you that sometimes what you wish for isn't what you really want, or need.  A new and different delivery method but it provides a good foundation for a conversation with your kids about what is important in life.",1392508800,,508,4.419354838709677

One girl wishes her sister is gone, so she will finally be noticed, and with that comes more wishes and trouble.  The fashions are adorable and while they are various monsters (vampires, beasts, various animals and so forth) they are not really scary - my 2 year old daughter actually watched it and like it.  This is a great DVD for any girl who is not all pink and Barbies, its a story of girls who are unique and monster-like.  The colors are bright and the fashions are funky, very cute to watch.

She wanted me to watch this movie with her and, I must admit, I really thought that she was talking about ""Monsters Inc."" or ""Monsters University"". Well after being a bit ""confused"" about some of the characters and asking my niece numerous questions, decided to just watch the movie and enjoy spending some time with my niece. Must admit, again, that I thought that this film was VERY GOOD!! Was quite impressed by it and how everything in the monster genre was more or less incorporated into the film. Also liked how a lot of the wordage used had monster themes as well. Overall, thought that this was a rather well made film and was very good to watch, not insulting to young kids or older people like myself - I am a 50 year old male. Thoroughly enjoyed watching this film with my little niece and also enjoyed learning from her about all the different characters, the speech used, and the world of ""Monster High"". Now she has me hooked on this world and learning more about it and am playing different games on the ""Monster High"" home page on the internet.",1386460800,,1170,4.523584905660377

This movie begins in the distant past when disaster is narrowly averted by the genie, Gigi Grant, who just barely prevents her shadow sister Whisp from tricking the most recent Finder of the Lantern into wishing her All Powerful, during a solar eclipse, which would have made it permanent, but it's a narrow escape.  Lessons have been learned, and tools have been destroyed, meaning that the next time the lantern is found just prior to a solar eclipse, the Day might not get Saved after all....

Is anyone surprised that said Next Time turns out to be at Monster High?  It is the start of a new school year, and everyone it seems has wishes for it,...

and don't we viewers just know that they are all going to turn out disastrously?

Clawdeen Wolf's younger sister Howleen is the Finder this time, and to her credit her first four wishes are almost entirely selfless, which doesn't mean they aren't going to turn out disastrously, but by her 5th wish Howleen is falling into temptation and being corrupted by Whisp into abusing her power.  By her 7th wish, Whisp has gotten Howleen to start banishing people into the lantern and replacing them with Shadow versions, but that's turning out to be a double-edged sword because by now these ghouls have a great deal of experience at being a pretty good team.  Soon the steadily augmenting force of ghoulfriends banished into the lantern is in a race against time to reassemble the tool that defeated Whisp before,...

before Whisp can get Howleen to wish her All Powerful during the coming eclipse.  Though I found the ending a bit eye-rolling-ly pollyannaish, I thoroughly enjoyed the several running gags: Lagoona as the fresh water creature of Gil's worst nightmares, Clawd, Heath, and Manny Taur trying to survive the most insanely dangerous reality TV show for moronsters, and Cleo's increasingly desperate attempts to become popular again after Howleen has wished her into a Nobody.  The most intriguing new character that viewers will want to see more of turned out to be Twyla, daughter of the Boogieman, a quiet voice of reason that goes too often ignored by her BFF Howleen,... and pretty much everyone else until it is ALMOST too late.  Gently Pushed Moral: Be careful what you wish for (of course).

Note: The DVD contains three (formerly) exclusive ""webisodes"" now watchable for free on the Monster High web site:

119 Department of Monster Vehicles
120 Royal Pest Sitter
121 Cookie Creeper

along with the very first Ever After High ""webisode"": The World of Ever After High, and it should be noted that the events of ""Monster High: 13 Wishes"" clearly place Monster High and Ever After High in the same universe,...

so now you'll have to buy your Monster High obsessed daughter the Ever After High dolls as well (insert evil laugh here)!...  Hey, at least they haven't worked Barbie into the same universe...

yet.

5864621,5,B00DY1KPLG,"Now originally i looked at this film and was like oh my gosh, not another Bratz Genie Magic Movie. However, this was much better than Bratz. The story was amazing. I have to say that the movie was very dark. There were moments were I was actually scared for the main girls if they were gonna actually be successful. I almost thought Frankie died at one point. I love Twyla's voice it sounds very girly and I wasn't expecting that from her. I also love how everyone became evil at one point in the movie. The ending was a little too obvious I knew what Howleen was gonna spend her last two wishes on but I'm glad that the villian got a nice ending for herself too. This was however one of the best movies I've ever seen and defanitely the best Monster High movie.",1381622400,,762,4.2620689655172415
