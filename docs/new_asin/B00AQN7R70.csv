5471607,5,B00AQN7R70,I absolutely love the entire series and will be devastated when it ends Martin Beck and his sidekick blend together marvellously.,1368403200,,129,5.190476190476191
5471608,5,B00AQN7R70,"The Swedish ""Beck"" police mysteries are very enjoyable.  The plots are interesting and unusual.  We are shown a different setting--Sweden.  The characters are all realistic and believable as they are well-written and perfectly-acted by the outstanding cast.  We get to know hard-working Inspector Beck, his volatile deputy, the long-suffering boss, the female police officers who have to prove themselves, Beck's crisis-prone daughter, and his weird but affable neighbor.  The viewer truly cares about what happens next to these characters because the series is well thought-out.  I recommend ""Beck"" to mystery fans.",1366502400,2,616,5.714285714285714
5471609,5,B00AQN7R70,"Thank you for putting out  more of this wonderful series. Anyone who loves NORSE NOIR will love the team and the stories here. Great acting, great actors, great writing. The best.",1365033600,,179,4.774193548387097
5471610,5,B00AQN7R70,"We have thoroughly enjoyed this series of Swedish police investigating murders in and around Stockholm.  Even though it is subtitled in English, it is entertaining and full of twists, turns, and surprises!

We would recommend this series for anyone who finds mystery and solving the crime of murder socially redeeming.

Our only disatisfation is that there are no more available...",1363219200,4,381,5.316666666666666
5471611,5,B00AQN7R70,"It is an excellent series.  Realistic, very well scripted, acted, no gimmicks. Just good stories well executed. Another Scandinavian top notch thriller noir series.",1360022400,3,164,5.833333333333333
5471612,5,B00AQN7R70,"I ordered all Scandinavian series. Beck is a very good film noir.
It arrived in good condition.looking forward to receiving the remaining episodes.",1359504000,3,147,5.434782608695652

8556535,5,B00AQN7R70,"I wouldn't have rated this 5 STARS from the start, but as others have stated, the series has improved dramatically---and in comedic terms as well---over the years. The two leads are excellent and the crimes they attempt to solve intriguing and compelling---as well as surprisingly violent and bloody. I still think the packaging of these DVDs leaves something to be desired, with either 3 disks stacked all together on one spool, or really cheap plastic ""pages"" with spines that break right off. 3 90-minute episodes for about $25 warrants better quality packing, in my book. But the stories and acting are good enough that I don't consider this a big enough flaw to downgrade the rating.",1446076800,,688,4.939655172413793

8556538,5,B00AQN7R70,"I don't know how this show does it, but each dvd is better than the last one.. Well developed/well written script/characters. I espec loved seeing the soft side of gunvald, in the episode involving his sister. I wish they would find a steady girlfriend for him, and let us in on why he hated his parents so much. once again, the show could do without beck's neighbor. the only problem i have with nordic detective shows... they are slow and drag out incidents that could take way less time. Even if this show were bad, i'd watch it just to look at gorgeous, mikael persbrandt, gunvald, with his commanding walk. and ghostly, crystal clear blue eyes",1427328000,,648,4.594827586206897
8556539,5,B00AQN7R70,"We knew what ""Beck"" involved having been with the episodes from Episode One.
The shipment arrived intact and quickly.  There were no glitches in the viewing.
All the interest in the Scandinavian novel and video series in this family stems from the excitement of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.""  That led to Wallander, Jo Nesbo, Varg Veum, Per Wahloo (all ten of the Beck mystery/ police procedural writings) , Borgen.  There's something FRESH available in these works.

8556540,5,B00AQN7R70,"See my review of Beck, episodes 13-15.  Beck and Wallander will make a great contribution to your DVD library.  Highly recommended.  You may also want to consider Dalziel & Pascoe, the BBC's excellent police procedure.  Warren Clarke, the detective superintendent, plays his character as the kind of guy you either accept and laugh at or despise.  Coarse, rude, arrogant, self serving, unsympathetic, he's completely the opposite of Colin Buchanan, his sidekick.  Taciturn and almost morose, seething with resentment towards his boss, you want him to bust out of that famous English reserve straitjacket and bring his boss down a few notches.",1403568000,,642,5.306930693069307
8556541,5,B00AQN7R70,"I love Beck stories, acting, and plot lines. Beck is as easy to get hooked on as the Swedish version of Wallander, as played by Krister Henricksson.",1395273600,,148,4.518518518518518
8556542,5,B00AQN7R70,"I have loved this series since the very first episodes (now quite a long time ago). This series continues to evolve. Seems like the production values have improved. Character development is well handled, even if some of the lesser characters appear and disappear a few episodes later. Beck and his side kick Gundvald just get more and more interesting. The writing for this program is absolutely first rate, the subject matter is dark (sometimes uncomfortable to watch) but so maturely handled. No fake drama, just the everyday job of investigators that have to deal with the darker side of humanity. I have to admit that I am a bit sad that I am nearing the end of the series. If you enjoyed Wallander or the Girl with the Dragon Tatoo, you will love this one. Scandinavian Noir at its best!",1388361600,,792,4.664285714285715
