8578297,1,B00C7OB6MI,"There's a reason it took 6 years from making to DVD release - no one would touch it unless desperate.
(1.) 98% of movie is just talking and walking in the hallways of a pretty boring school.
(2.) Stupid story of a high school chemistry teacher injecting a student for an experiment that turns him into a person for about five minutes in the movie we see walking around in a really cheap fabric costume that makes him look like a cheap stupid deformed person. Even the fabric of the costume would wrinkle when he did his Frankenstein walk.
(3.) A few cheap props like plastic chemistry lab ware and colored water.
(4.) Horrendous acting - I think they just gave a bunch of homeless individuals $20 a day to partake.
(5.) To save money you don't see any actual horrific moments which is the main plot point.",1381881600,,805,4.445945945945946
8578298,3,B00C7OB6MI,"There is an incident at a high school where the janitor is brutally killed and a student goes missing. The authorities or CNI recruit two ""Dead Hunters"" out of prison to patrol the school at night. There are also 4 girls who sneak in at night to hold a seance, but for weeks go unnoticed by our crafty hunters. There is also a student being experimented upon by a teacher in a lab that plays the sound of something boiling. There is also a couple of reporters, some evil guys within the CNI and the bishop.

Eventually the film settles on our hunters attempting to kill a CG bullet proof creature in painted long johns and a rubber mask who likes the boobs of Vero (Ibai Snchez) which isn't a bad thing.

This is a low budget production with bad effects and a terrible introduction. There is plenty of fake blood, some ripped off body parts, bad acting, bad dialouge, and Ibai Snchez as the plaything of the demon, the highlight of the film, see the back of DVD cover.

Spanish hip-hop music. The movie is in Spanish with English subtitles. It is a stinker. For Troma fans only.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, Nudity (Ibai Snchez) and brief male nudity.",1379980800,2,1147,4.473684210526316

8578300,5,B00C7OB6MI,"Somewhere, a monster roams the halls of an ordinary high school--it stalks the students, kills them mercilessly, and leaves the school with no option but to get help. The Deadhunters, tasked with taking the monster down, must lock themselves in at the high school overnight with the very monster they hunt. Such is the basic plot of Killing Twice, a Spanish-language horror film directed by Julian Lara and released through Troma Entertainment. Released in 2007, and bearing the seal of a Stiges Film Festival official selection, this is certainly an indie horror movie to be paid attention to. With a visual style that recalls gritty horror-suspense films of the mid-to-late 1970s, and a flair for both dramatic tension and striking imagery that hearkens back to the works of John Carpenter and Dario Argento, Killing Twice is a great example of low-budget horror done right. It has loads of atmosphere, plenty of great character-building moments, and some excellent practical effects that really sell the premise, along with some excellent writing and a cast that works well within their skills and within the story at hand, making the best of what they have to use. It's an excellent addition to the collection of the horror fan who's seen it all, as well as being a great film for anyone looking for some high tension and good, fun scares.

The DVD, released by Troma Entertainment, is a high-quality package typical of their releases. The menus are easy to navigate and easy to look at (even though the music gets old after a while,) and there are some great special features included which really add to the value of the release, including a making-of featurette, an assortment of short films from Troma (including an excellent segment from Lloyd Kaufman's ""Make Your Own Damn Movie"" series,) and a selection of trailers for other Troma films. They're all worth watching, and definitely give you more bang for your buck on this release. The main feature itself looks very good--the picture is crisp and clean, being a recent film shot on good-quality cameras, and although the sound is occasionally muddy, the subtitles (the film was written and performed in Spanish) are clear and legible, making up for the somewhat-uneven sound quality.

In conclusion, Killing Twice is a clever twist on a classic concept, and more than that, it's executed with style, class and a subtle wit that contrasts with its outwardly-trashy facade. It's an example of how an independent film can engage in a challenging premise and still come out being entertaining, smart, and a real pleasure to watch.",1372204800,2,2588,4.988425925925926
