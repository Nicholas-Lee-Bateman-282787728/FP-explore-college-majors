2748289,5,B000MTOM8A,namek and ginyu sagas are going to be great.  finally some consistency in voices.,1176508800,3,81,4.785714285714286
2748290,3,B000MTOM8A,"I'll give Funimation credit on one thing, and that is the restoration and preservation of this series. Since I'm an anime purist, this goes against everything that the series has come to be. That's the same as cropping a series like Neon Genesis Evangelion. I mean who would do that? It's one of those ideas that wasn't thought out too well. I mean they should've just released it in 4:3 and let the watcher decide if they want to see it cut off because that is possible with the proper settings, but no choice was given so I'm highly disappointed with this release as I am glad that I at least got a chance to enjoy it for what it was; a chopped classic. I will also agree that it is very claustraphobic which means it wasn't what the artist indended in the first place.",1174003200,9,771,4.324137931034483
2748291,1,B000MTOM8A,"FUNimation's latest release acts as a slap in the face to fans of the series. After 6 years of DVD releases, which consisted of 79 discs at approximately $2,000 retail, FUNimation has pulled the rug out from underneath the very fans that helped them establish their position as a respected anime company. Now, fans who had 251 episodes out of 291 will never be able to complete their collections legally.

The release itself consists of 39 episodes which have been cropped, losing 20% of their original vertical resolution. While this is often minor details such as hair and so forth, during high-octane fight scenes entire characters can lose the majority of their bodies and half of their heads. This is most definitely NOT the way the series was intended to be seen.

As DragonBall/Z/GT is being mastered from 16mm film, it is essentially a 4:3 presentation (it is slightly larger, but nowhere near a widescreen aspect ratio). FUNimation, in conjunction with Video Post & Transfer, have destroyed the original framing of the series by carelessly cropping it to widescreen. While people seem to mock those who are angry about this, proclaiming the details lost to be only ""hair and feet,"" in truth the detail gained is usually even less (5% which tends to consist of rocks, clouds, etc.). In addition, the cropping makes the action scenes very claustrophobic.

In addition to the above, FUNimation and VP&T have destroyed a great deal of detail in the digital print by applying Digital Video Noise Reduction (DVNR) by way of an automated process. This results in the series looking like a pastel painting and even causes some lines in the animation to disappear completely in certain scenes (such as Nappa's teeth, Goku's face and more). This completely eliminates the point in doing an HD transfer, as the purpose is to capture more detail not to destroy it. Add to this the obvious changes to contrast and color balance, which cause humorous problems such as Gohan flashing blue when bursting out of Raditz's spacepod, and you have a release that is truly worthy of laughter.

The worst part, however, is FUNimation's advertising techniques and the very documentary on this disc. FUNimation has tried desperately to sell this set on lies and insults, such as trying to insinuate that overscan has anything to do with why the show should be cropped. In truth, my television (which is a Pioneer Elite PRO-910HD widescreen plasma) has 2.5% overscan on all sides, meaning I lose 25% of the vertical picture and gain *nothing* horizontally. My television is also fairly high end, as you can verify by looking online. Also, the fact that FUNimation and VP&T felt the need to fabricate the scenes with grain (the framerates of the 'clean' footage and the grain don't match, see for yourself) serves only to insult our intelligence more.

This release embarasses me and it should embarass FUNimation. I've been a fan of the series for 12 years now. I own all the DragonBoxes from Japan because I wanted the series *truly* remastered and not just automatically filtered. I truly had hope that FUNimation would produce a set that was worthy of those who helped them become a force in the world of anime production, however after 7 years FUNimation still hasn't learned.

This release is insulting to the original animators of DragonBall Z, the fans of DragonBall Z and to FUNimation themselves, who have proven they are capable of much more than this. If you want to be respected as a fan and as a consumer, don't buy this set. Don't send FUNimation the message that we like being lied to and will accept whatever they toss us. Just remember, whatever they may say, numbers don't lie. We're losing a net 15% of DBZ. And seriously, who wants that?",1173571200,26,3740,4.85423197492163
2748292,5,B000MTOM8A,"This season had more character building covering the best support cast the show had.  Kurririn and Gohan faced the ruler of the universe's army, and somehow helped start Vegita's turn to g...not as evil.  The following seasons were more flashy, but not necessarily more ambitious.",1173139200,11,280,5.2
2748293,5,B000MTOM8A,I can not wait for this set to be released as I have not seen any of the revoiced Namek saga and being a season sets saves having to buy every individual DVD.  Any DBZ fan would be mad not to get it.  You can really tell the difference in the season 1 set with the quality of the image and I am sure this level of quality will be in the second installment as well.  A must buy!,1173052800,3,377,3.7468354430379747
2748294,5,B000MTOM8A,"I can't wait for this to come out. I just hope Funanimation bring us all the episodes of the series in this format. I was waiting for ages to see this product come out and finally my wish comes true. Go Dragonball Z you will never die because you fans will always have a piece of your history in their hearts, just like me.",1172793600,7,323,4.0625
2748295,5,B000MTOM8A,"I am anticipating this release more so than season 1,since the namek saga,as it was known in the usa,has my favorite characters and the best villains. I have been a fan since I was in the first grade,and have the manga series,so seeing the japanese original episodes is what I have always wanted.",1171324800,3,296,4.60377358490566

This box came in scuffed up as well, the paint on the box has been danaged slightly at the corners and it is very noticeable",1515369600,,267,4.254901960784314
2748336,4,B000MTOM8A,"I have no idea why they split these into 30ish episode seasons. They should be split into sagas instead. The beginning of the Red Ribbon Saga was on the previous season for some reason. It ends up breaking up the sagas in strange places.

That said, the Red Ribbon Saga really picks up this ""season"". It drags in the middle, especially during the tower storyline. You get to meet some great characters, like Tao and Goku's most underrated teacher Korin. Overall, a pretty cool story.

That said, it is really rough watching the racist caricatures of people of color. I mean, there is a black character with big red lips named Black. I try to keep it in cultural context, but man, it is painful to watch.",1515369600,,703,4.52755905511811

When i came across Dragon Ball i instantly fell in love with this anime. Now I purchased seasons 1-5 to have all the episodes as part of my collection. I really like the booklet the DVD'S are inserted in and the slip cover is very nice as well. The audio is really good. I definitely recommend Dragon Ball to anyone whether you are new to anime or not. I've got to say this is a great gateway in order to get into other anime's. Great blend of action and comedy.

I think they split them into weird seasons considering this show was on for only 3 years but is split into 5 seasons. It's well worth the money though.,1471478400,,421,4.023809523809524

2748544,5,B000MTOM8A,"Dragon Ball is one of the earlier classic anime (cartoons) from japan.  It's not super old, but it's been around for awhile now released back in '86 and this original Dragon Ball seasons 1-5 are probably some of the funniest and a bit crude.  Let me explain,  the series has been translated into english and a lot of the subtle jokes about the old master being sort of a perv permeates throughout the series.  If you know japanese, watch it in the japanese language,  it's so much more funny because of the slight crudeness.  There's no nudity or anything really bad in this series as it's more about martial arts and fighting bad guys,  and Goku's own story,  but season 2 adds kurilin, but you need to get all 5 seasons.  Some of the seasons are hard to get now as they're backordered, but if you can get the whole set, you should, it's really good.",1445385600,,851,4.403846153846154
2748545,4,B000MTOM8A,"this season Goku continues his search for the four star dragon ball. but he learns that he is not alone in the search. expirer pilaf has once again started looking for the balls. and there is another group looking for them as well. this group is known as the red ribbon army and they are lead be the man known as commander/ general Red.
Goku's first encounter with the red ribbon army is with the forces of Cornel Silver, who Goku defeats with ease and clams his first ball. his next encounter is in the frozen north and the forces of General White in their base mussel tower. Goku finally beats them with the aid of a new friend and clams another ball. Goku's next stop is to west city to see Bulma and to get her help to repair the dragon radar. this turns out to be more fun them Goku may have thought. with Bulma by his side Goku goes south to look for the next ball and runs into the forces of General Blue. General Blue turns out to be a little more difficult to beat but in the end Goku clams another ball.
the next ball is found in the land of Korin, where Goku make a friend in Bora and his son Ob the guardians of the land. together they beat the forces of Captain Yellow. by this time commander Red can no longer stand this men being beat by a child and sends in Tao, a ruthless kill and kills Bora and takes three of the balls. at this point Goku decides to climb Korin tower to become stranger. but he finds a cat named Korin who is making Goku try to catch him in order to get a jug of water.",1445299200,,1506,4.057046979865772

2748597,5,B000MTOM8A,"I was kinda worried the original Dragon Ball series didn't age that well, but it kinda has. This set in particular has the majority of the Red Ribbon Army Saga which is really entertaining.

Not really good at saying specifically positive things so I'll just say it's a great buy. I've even planned on ordering and watching DBZ Kai to watch soon after I finish this show. :)",1429228800,,374,4.5

2748631,5,B000MTOM8A,"Dragon Ball: Season 2 is a good buy for anyone aiming to collect the series. (Which they should, since the show is so great on its own as well as in correlation with DBZ). I won't go into too much depth about the story since you should already be aware of it going into buying the show, but I can assure you that it's as fun loving and whacky as the first season set is.

Animation/Sound quality is as good as you'll get with something coming out of the 80's. DB is one of the franchises that has struggled to keep up with the times as technology kept progressing too fast for any solid releases to come out. To my knowledge, this is one of the only ways you could buy and own the entirety of the original Dragonball series. The remastering quality is good and there isn't any cropping that I can see since it plays in the original format. The sound quality is pretty nice too, although you can only get the Japanese soundtrack in mono. The English track comes in 5.1 surround sound. Each disc comes with 6 episodes and a marathon feature as well as a play all feature. (Marathon = Episodes - openings/closings)

As for packaging quality, the logo on the front of the slip cover is raised and if you're buying each season, you can take off the slip covers and line it up for a cool mural type picture of Shenron. The slip cover quality isn't absolutely amazing and will easily be susceptible to wear and tear if you're not careful with it but who doesn't expect that? Don't chuck it on the floor every time you hold it and you should have a pretty easy time dealing with that. In addition, there's no booklet or episode guide since FUNimation went green.

Shipping was good, although it did damage the sides a tad with the plastic wrapping and that makes the slip cover a little difficult to put on. It came two days later than the first expected delivery date but was still within the estimated 5-8 days delivery time. I'm happy with my purchase and suggest it to anybody looking for Dragon Ball! :D",1421107200,,2000,4.370967741935484

2748648,5,B000MTOM8A,"Honestly, what amazed me about this season was Goku's challenges with the Red Ribbon Army and how it ended with a huge cliffhanger leading into season three.  It was well written and you wouldn't think Goku searching for his Grandfather's ball would really keep interest but each twist and turn as the RRA tries to achieve world dominance for their leader is as breathtaking as the last.  It's a great season for your collection and I can't wait till I get paid Friday, I'll be buying season 3 :D

Just a hint.  If you do get this season, make sure you buy season 3 once you get the disc 4, I wish I had done that, because you'll want to at the end of Disc 5 :D",1418169600,,661,4.181102362204724

2748706,5,B000MTOM8A,"Overall it's well worth the money, especially since buying this set from retail stores can up to $20 more. The box and discs really do look amazing and if your favorite color is orange (like me) you'll most likely love it even more. The show itself is a big improvement over Season One. There is more action and a little less talking. Lastly, the box says ""digitally remastered"" and they mean it. Compared to the original animation, everything is much more vivid and clear. It almost looks as if it wasn't made in 1989. But if you're one of those people who likes to see the original piece this might not be ideal for you, but give it chance. It's almost hard not to enjoy it but if you don't you'll always have the pretty box to look at. Seriously, it looks so great. You should buy it for just that reason. Enjoy!",1398988800,,815,4.333333333333333

2748713,4,B000MTOM8A,"Season 2 is a cool season of DragonBall, as it shows how Goku confronts the different divisions of the Red Ribbon Army.  The saga Of General Blue is an awesome saga as General Blue is a high ranking cool general.  What was really cool about that saga is the very well written storyline with it.  Toriyama wrote a storyline of Goku, Krillin, Bulma, and the Red Ribbon Army discovering this high tech ancient pirate cave deep in the ocean through an air pocket.  It shows how the treasure is protected by certain traps remaining there even if the pirates supposedly died off there hundreds of years ago, and nobody had discovered the cave since.  I've wondered after that storyline if there are deep underwater caves with air pockets like the one you saw in these episodes.  I highly doubt there'd be a pirate cave like the one we saw in DragonBall underwater, and I do believe there are some underwater caves with a slight air pocket you can swim up to.  But, is there one with that much of an air pocket as we see in DragonBall, as you could easily walk around it?
You get anxious to see how Goku defeats the Red Ribbon Army, but these DVDs don't finish after the Red Ribbon Army Saga.  Even if it's just one disk later.  They probably did that to encourage you to buy the next DVD set.  It's just a cool adventure story.",1391817600,,1321,4.399176954732511
2748714,5,B000MTOM8A,Love Dragon Ball!!!!!!!! What can I say happy with the artwork and the case. The series is the best what can I say Dragon Ball Rules! The foldout setup that holds the CD's art work is awesome a sight to behold every time you open it. Product continues to work perfect which has been well taken care of. One minor issue but nothing to even consider the cover/box will begin to show wear if you don't carefully slide the CD holder in.,1391558400,,432,4.280487804878049

2748721,5,B000MTOM8A,"I know a lot of people don't like the orange bricks since the series is cropped in 16:9 instead of being 4:3. Trust me, I know your pain losing some of the picture. However with the Blu-rays being cropped too (no idea if Funimation will cancel those too) and the Dragon Box sets being expensive as hell, this is your best bet having DBZ in English on DVD. I can point out a handful of times in each episode where the heads are cut off from the cropping but the picture is remastered in comparison to the old VHS releases. This set is perfect except for the cropping. Get past that and you got DBZ!",1389916800,,597,4.2

2748726,5,B000MTOM8A,"I love everything DBZ! This is such a cool Saga.  I love the fillers that this season has.  Some of them have nothing to do with the main story but I don't care.  The action is good and the characters are fun to watch.  I want more for my money and this gives it to me. If you are a DBZ fan then this is a excellent addition. The coolest part of this saga is when the Ginyu force arrives.  They are so awesome.  Like wow look how strong they are.  Makes even Vegeta get worried.  Just gives me so much excitement and energy.

I wish I could just this more then 5 stars.  Everything DBZ is something amazing.",1388534400,,607,4.025210084033613

2748770,5,B000MTOM8A,gotta love all the dragon ball action. reminds me of when I watched it years ago. just had to own it.,1365292800,,101,3.857142857142857
2748771,5,B000MTOM8A,"I love all the DBZ and DBGT episodes and movies.  These were cheap, at least when I bought them so I don't know what the price is now, and they arrived promptly.",1365033600,,161,4.03125
2748772,5,B000MTOM8A,"My favorite anime continues.  And this season is even better than the first!  All the episodes here are from the Red Ribbon Army Saga, one of my top 5 Dragonball sagas ever.  And apart from some bits on the last disc, they're all good.  Even the last disc is good, honestly it is; it's just that it will dovetail into the worst Dragonball plotline ever.  Some are better than others, but there are at least 2 dozen great episodes here.

Picking up where the last set left off, Goku leaves Chichi to go after Pilaf, who is quickly beaten by the Red Ribbon Army.  After beating up Colonel Silver, Goku flies to a wintry village.  A girl named Suno takes him in out of the cold, & grateful for her family's hospitality, Goku decides to rid them of the Red Ribbon Army base known as Muscle Tower.  There, Goku faces the Arnold Schwarzenegger-like robot known as Major Metallitron, the goofy Ninja Murasaki, the would-be killer who turns good Android 8, the pink monster Buyon & the Russian-accented General White.  This arc and the episodes with General Blue are my favorites on the set.  It's classic Dragonball, fun action & funny comedy (Ninja Murasaki is particularly hilarious).  Oh, & Android 8 (or Eighter as he likes to be called) is my favorite android, apart from 18.

Then he goes to the city where Bulma lives & 2 episodes later they both go off to find a Dragonball.  These were my least favorite episodes on the first 4 discs.  They're good, but I have to admit a Kai version would make Bulma look a lot better here.

And now we get to my other favorite part of the set, the episodes with General Blue.  He is my favorite Red Ribbon Army officer ever.  He is hilariously prissy.  In his first episode, he has a soldier shot for picking his nose.  In 3 of my favorite episodes here, Goku chases him into Penguin Village, home to the characters from the manga Dr. Slump.  I had read some of the manga before seeing this so I knew I was in for a treat, & it was just as fun & hilarious as I expected it to be.  Honestly, it was just perfect.

The last great episode is when Goku meets the Indians Bora & Upa, & saves them from Captain Yellow, a tiger who appears to be the highest ranking animal in the Red Ribbon Army.  They tell him about Korin Tower.  Then the downward slide begins when Tao shows up & kills Bora, beats Goku & takes all but one of the Dragonballs.  Goku then decides to climb to the top of Korin Tower so that he can drink some mystical water that will make him stronger so he can avenge Bora & then get all the Dragonballs to resurrect him, & meets the legendary Korin, an old white cat.  Really, what's here is good, but after this; well, I'll just explain it all next season.

So overall this was a really good season, my personal favorite of the Dragonball sets, apart from maybe Season 5 (haven't finished watching it yet but that could possibly be my new favorite).",1364688000,,2899,4.358208955223881

2748781,4,B000MTOM8A,"The presentation of the Dragonball Z series is brilliant. It is well worth the money and I would suggest it to any DBZ fan.

The remastering quality is good, just the cutting of the frames that really irritates me. Having been moved aspect ratios, the top and bottom have both been cut off leaving you with a lesser image. It would have been nice to have the opening scene like I remember it to, I'm not a big fan of the japanese version, and what the heck is the ending scene all about?!

Other than that, the marathon feature is  a brilliant idea if you plan watching a DVD in full. The casing and DVDs themselves look professional and good enough to sit on your DVD shelf.",1361232000,,675,4.299212598425197

2748796,5,B000MTOM8A,The second season of dragonball z arrived to me in great condition along with my season 3. The delivery was a lot faster than expected. The season has some filler in the beginning but the rest is just action and the main story. These sets aren't for the die hard core fans of DBZ but for the fan that wants to watch the show as they did when they were younger. I was a bit disappointed that it didn't come with the character booklet for season 2 yet my season 3 came with one. I knew it wasn't going to have one but it made little difference as everything is just in amazing condition. My brother and I really enjoy the show and I'm glad it helped to complete my collection. Now I'm currently getting the movies. Overall great service and product.,1360108800,,747,4.267605633802817

I enjoyed this product because it has the original funimation voice actors in it with improved graphics. The quality of the DVDs on a bluray player make the quality even better. One thing that may defer fans in the United States is that it does not contain the original music that was added when they dubbed over the Japanese in English.

When I have purchased these remastered sets in the past from other retailers, I have received an episode guide booklet. I am disappointed with Amazon for not including these in my order. They can be very helpful to those who are deeply into the Dragon Ball Z series just as I am.

2748830,5,B000MTOM8A,"This set has 30 episodes of the Red Ribbon Army saga. We meet enemies like Commander Red, Colonel silver, Genreal White, and General Blue. There's a lot of fun and action in Dragonvall season 2. Dragonball is lots of fun and a must see for all anime fans. I love that they have remastered this old series. The audio is in 5.1 Dolby Digital surround. It sounds great. It also has a marathon play feature that allows you to skip the annoying opening and closing animations and previews. This set is great.",1351123200,,503,4.478260869565218

It goes all the way up to where the Namekian Dragonballs have been collected and are ready to have a wish made to them. My favorite feature of this box set is the marathon feature option. This allows you to watch all the episodes on each disc w/o any previews or opening/closing songs. It makes everything flow so much smoother. The video and audio quality is also very good in this collection. It is presented in 5.1 dolby digital. The dialogue has also been revised. It's a great addition to any DBZ fans collection.,1351123200,2,584,4.571428571428571
2748832,5,B000MTOM8A,"well the review is for the DVD set itself not so much about the season as i LOVE the dragon ball z series and i think every hardcore fan should own all the seasons as i have them all including dragon ball and dragon ball GT. the DVD set is great: great artwork, great CD's, so all in all its perfect to own. i do recommend buying for people who would like to own the whole seasons as its basically what was shown in TV but you can watch it at your own paste. Nothing was cut from this DVDs as i heard with some of the newer that are coming out. Great for the money and for the collection.",1349481600,,588,3.908333333333333
2748833,2,B000MTOM8A,"There was a time I ordered a lot of these Dragon Ball Z sets, wanting to watch with ONLY Japanese audio. This was a preference, and with the intention to immerse in Japanese because I'm trying to learn Japanese. I was off to a good start, but really, the show has always been just okay to me, better with Japanese dialogue. Gave it a shot for the preference. In the end just not too impressed. Near the end of this box in the set, it seemed the better choice to be done with it. So I got rid of them, instead of getting sets 5 and 6 I was considering. They are gone, and the last thought I would give DBZ is this review.

Full of filler, I got the original full DBZ because there were some scenes worth keeping (longer fights, and Goku training in space) but the positive points could not save this show. If only there were a few changes I might have liked Dragon ball Kai. In this case, okay sometimes is not quite enough.",1349395200,,923,4.156424581005586

2748858,5,B000MTOM8A,"DBZ season 2 focuses on a lot of things this time around. Noteworthy is that for the first time some of the Z-fighters go into space, a new powerful villain is introduced (you don't see much of him until season 3), Goku is all healed up and is traveling into space to help his friends Bulma, Krillin and his son Gohan gather up the Dragon Balls from Namek. Also worth mentioning is the Z-fighters killed in season 1 are now training with King Kai (it's mentioned that they made it to King Kai's faster than Goku!) Vegita is back (he got to Namek just before Bulma and co. did to also gather the Dragon Balls) although this time he is somewhat neutral towards the Z-fighters. Goku shows Vegita that he is much more powerful and that he and Vegita are no longer equals in battle (this is true for much of the DBZ series).",1313020800,,819,4.324675324675325

I have the whole series on VHS Uncut, the DVD sets Uncut, and now I am beginning my collection on these. So far I have seasons 1-4 and this one along with the others are all great! 5 star material all the way! My only complaint with these new sets are that they are not using the music I grew up with! Perfect cell theme, Hell's Bells, etc. Other than that though these are great quality! With excellent sound effects and visual unseen in the series before! And c'mon its centered around the Namekians who are cool and you get some flashbacks of the past! You see Dodoria, Zarbon, and one of my favorite villains in the series, Frieza! You also get a peek at the Ginyu Force which brings a refreshing sense of humor to the story along with a roster of villains!",1310947200,,862,4.262195121951219

I decided to go with the Orange Bricks instead of the Dragon Boxes for one main reason: The Orange Bricks contain the Bruce Faulconer American soundtrack, and they're cheaper. To be honest, I prefer the show with the Japanese music, however the American music is nostalgic for me, so I wanted these for that reason as well, and there are some episodes where I think the American music works really well.

The Dragon Boxes, however, have better remastering. With those, the artists removed the dirt and scratches by HAND. With these Orange Bricks, the film was put through a machine, which ate up not only the dirt and scratches, but some detail as well. It sometimes results in blurry image quality, and when characters are powering up, some of the detail is gone from their face. This is a problem, but it's not a huge problem for me, because overall it still looks good. The colors might be a bit oversaturated, but they still look very good. Another flaw in this set is that the image is cropped 16:9 instead of 4:3 when it was originally intended to be 4:3. This results in some of the top and bottom being cut off. Again, not a huge problem for me, but for some it is.

Overall, if you want to go cheaper or if you want to have the American background music, I'd go with these sets. If you want the best remastering and prefer the Japanese dub, I'd shell out some more money for the Dragon Boxes (which contain both the Japanese and English dub). But for fans like me who just want to own the series, this is still a good set to collect.",1309305600,3,1628,4.36963696369637

2748866,3,B000MTOM8A,"Let's be clear about a few things right off the bat: this chapter in the Dragon Ball saga is probably the weakest one of the entire series (if one includes Dragon Ball Z and ignores the apocryphal Dragon Ball GT).  Its plodding pace, predictable plot lines and offensive stereotypes make it hard to sit through at times in America in 2010.

Viewed from the context of mid-1980s Japan, it may be a little more tolerable.  The pace, for one thing, was dictated by the speed at which series creator Akira Toriyama was turning out the manga version; the teleivised anime was intended to closely follow the printed page, and as a result sacrifices had to be made in terms of storytelling and animation.  Stories that could be told in a single 22-minute episode are dragged out to fill five or six shows.  At times you'll feel like you've been watching the same episode over and over again.

Then there's that not-so-funny Japanese racism and sexism.  It is essential that Dragon Ball be viewed in its cultural context, and therefore this is no children's cartoon.  You will see full-frontal child nudity (animated, of course); pederasty (Bulma is, after all, only 16 at this point in the series); and what to an American audience will seem ghastly racist and homophobic stereotypes.  Virtually the entire Red Ribbon Army seems to be portrayed as gay, but none more than the flamboyant General Blue who in the original Japanese dub expresses horror at the affections of a woman and lusts for the love of a much younger man (boy?).  To their credit, the Fort Worth-based team at Funimation has done an excellent job of changing the English dialogue to mask these scenes that would be extraordinarily offensive to most Americans today.

Beyond that we have the painfully rendered Native American characters of Bora and Upa; the almost blackface Officer Black (whom the English dub team skillfully avoids naming for the entire series until just seconds before his death); and a host of other shallow, boring support characters whom I just could not bring myself to care about (Snow; Android 8; the Dr. Slump crew; etc.)

Having said all that, it's a fascinating trip back through the early days of Goku and company, as Toriyama really began to flesh out his hero and what makes him so admirable, or perhaps annoying depending on one's point of view.  The action is decent but offset by the sluggish pace; this is amended in Episodes 50 to 54, which feature some terrific fight scenes and dialogue; and of course by the fiendish Mercenary Tao, easily the most cruel and contemptible villain of the series to this point.",1290816000,3,2609,4.796875
2748867,5,B000MTOM8A,"Dragon Ball Z: Season Two went way beyond my expecations.  In the past I'd only seen the re-runs, mostly of season one on satellite, so this was totally new to me.  This season has so much action in it that I couldn't explain it to you if I tried.  You have to see it for yourself.

2748869,3,B000MTOM8A,"The Dragon Ball Season Two DVD box set includes five DVDs that contain thirty episodes.  The first three discs contain seven episodes, the fourth disc contains six episodes, and the fifth disc contains three episodes and the DVD extras.  The focus of this box set is Goku's search for the Dragon Balls, and his various run-ins with the Red Ribbon Army.

One of the best features of this set is the marathon feature; this allows you to watch all of the episodes back-to-back.  However, with the marathon feature, you only see the opening credits once, and the ending credits are not shown.  This feature is very helpful when you're trying to watch all of the episodes on a disc in a single sitting.

However, the special features on this set aren't very special.  All you get are the textless versions of the opening and ending credits (which are the same as what appeared on the first DVD box set), and trailers.  The trailers included on this set are for Nabari no Ou, Tsubasa, Fullmetal Alchemist, Evangelion 1.01, One Piece, Spice and Wolf, Comic Party Revolution, and Dragon Ball.

In some respects, I thought the episodes on this set were decent, but they weren't quite as good as what appeared on the first box set.  I thought the section where Goku ends up at Penguin Village was a bit on the strange side.  My biggest disappointment with this set was how FUNimation decided to split the episodes between discs.  Instead of making a five disc set with five episodes on each disc, or a set where the episodes divide out a little more evenly, they decided to cram as many episodes as they could on the early discs in the set, and only placing three measly episodes on the final disc.

While I'm a little disappointed by the episode breakdown of the discs and by the lack of special features, this set is still a ""must get"" for any Dragon Ball fans that want to own the series on DVD.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD box set through the King County Library System.",1288656000,,2001,4.5069252077562325
2748870,5,B000MTOM8A,"After his very first venture out into the world, the young Goku is eager to get back out and explore. Goku is on the hunt for just one of the seven Dragon Balls, but he is not the only one. Now, Goku is about to face his toughest challenge, the evil Red Ribbon Army. These men are fierce and mean serious business. They will do whatever it takes to get the Dragon Balls for their leader, Commander Red. With the help of some old friends and some brave new ones Goku is going to make sure that the beautiful planet that he has just started to see will not be painted red with the bllod of the innocent.

As a fan of Dragon Ball Z, I am loving every episode of Dragon Ball. I love how the story is much simpler and so much more fun. It is amazing to watch Goku grow up into the noble warrior that he is in DBZ and now it is great to finally see how all of his friends are thrown into the story. The best part about DB is because the story is so much smaller all the characters that didn't get so much development in DBZ are getting their much deserved time in this series. Master Roshi, The Ox King and yes even Oolong have so much more importance in this piece of the story and it just makes me so happy to see it. What I do know is as the story moves towards the DBZ sagas the story of Dragon Ball will get darker, but for now like Goku in the first and now second season I am just having fun.",1283644800,,1393,3.9397163120567376

2748879,3,B000MTOM8A,"The Dragon Ball season 2 box set offers nothing new in terms of quality, packaging, or extras. It's the same old package but of course with new episodes. As such I will focus mostly on the new episodes and story arcs themselves, as the rest is self-explanatory.

Season 2 continues the lengthy Red Ribbon Army saga where the last set left off. This story arc for me represents the ultimate low point of the series. Goku fights his way through the ranks of the Red Ribbon Army, resulting in a series of short one-sided battles. There isn't a whole lot of plot going on at this time. Goku is on a quest to relocate his grandfather's four star dragon ball, but the Red Ribbon Army is also searching for the balls for their own corrupt devices.

The episodes start to drag by the time Goku climbs muscle tower. We're introduced to the first Android character, number 8, but he doesn't fight Goku, and doesn't become a regular character either. Krillin and Bulma join in around the same time General Blue debuts and things get even more redundant. The set pushes Blue as being the first character capable of challenging Goku, but this is far from true. General Blue is tougher then the rest of the army, but he's still shown to be a chump compared to Goku inc. The only attack he has that gives him a cheap edge is a rather annoying paralysis inducing gaze, and some very limited telekinesis. After being a pain in the neck for far too many episodes, Blue is finally sent packing not by Goku or Krillin, but by a new character named Arale.

Arale was the main character in another children's manga written by Akira Toriyama. She was an android with a simple and innocent personality but with incredible fighting power. Her home, penguin village, is like a ride through the mind of a drug addict. Nothing makes sense and everything is really weird. It's easily the most bizarre episode in the history of the series, and that is saying a lot.

Things only start to pick up when Mercenary Tao is introduced. A hired killer, Tao is not only the first villain to flat out beat Goku, he's also the first to kill another character. Bora and Upa were only just introduced but we see Bora is a superhuman fighter like Goku as bullets bounce off his chest and he tosses giant boulders like they were small stones. Still Tao sets the pace by killing Bora with ease, and then eliminating Goku almost as easily. Tao is the first true threat Goku has ever faced, and he would be the last for some time.

The story takes a pace after that more akin to a typical Chinese martial arts movie. Goku must undergo special training to be able to defeat Tao so he climbs Korin's Tower for the first time and trains under the mystical master, who also trained Master Roshi many years ago. Unfortunately the set ends there. There's only a few episodes left in the Red Ribbon Army saga so I really don't see why they didn't bother to include them. In the same way, it would've helped if they tacked a few more episodes onto the first box set, and things would've evened out more for them. At this point it appears Funi is starting to fall back into old habits of bilking the series for all it's worth. As if releasing three distinct sets of DVDs simultaneously wasn't enough, right?

All things considered the saga drags on very slowly but the fight with Tao is not only important to the story, it's also a pretty darn good fight. The best yet in the series. Unfortunately you have to wait until you get the next set to see how it plays out. However I can't feel that the end justifies the means here and the rest of the saga is just so bad that it's hard to give this set a decent score. The fight with Tao and the training with Korin are important, so even if you aren't a completist I would still recommend this set. But be warned before wading through the other four discs. It's going to be a long and slow journey.",1272931200,2,3888,4.4156206415620645

2748887,4,B000MTOM8A,"Dragon Ball Z Season 2 naturally picks right off where Season 1 ended. Most of the features on this set haven't changed, so I'll just summarize them quickly. Picture looks great, widescreen crops a bit but it's minor, even full screen DBZ is cropped, audio comes in English with Japanese music in Surround, English with TV music in Stereo, and Japanese in Mono. No extra features except for alternative marathon play and a few trailers.

As for the story, this box set covers the Namek/Ginyu Force/Captain Ginyu Sagas and continues immediately where the Saiyan saga left off. Out of all of Earth's defenders only Krillin and the very young Gohan are able to travel to the planet Namek to collect a new set of dragon balls to restore their friends who died on Earth. Goku is the only other fighter left alive but his injuries prevent him from coming at first. Meanwhile Vegeta survives the final battle on the Earth and recovers quickly. He heads back out into space with the same objective, to collect the dragon balls to grant his wish.

After a group of rather boring episodes, the story kicks up once again as Krillin, Gohan, and Bulma all arrive on Namek at the same time as Vegeta and the Saiyan Prince's rival Cui. They also discover another being already on Namek who's power far exceeds even Vegeta. Things go from bad to worse. Vegeta's strength continues to grow as he takes out Freeza's elite soldiers one by one. Krillin and Gohan ally with a young Namek child who they saved from Freeza's wrath. In return this child, Dende, takes them to meet the leader of the Namekian race. All the while Vegeta manages to collect six of the seven Dragon Balls, stealing five right from under Freeza's nose. Krillin and Gohan collect the last Dragon Ball and get a power boost while they hide from Vegeta.

The Saiyan Prince finally finds the warriors from Earth when Freeza's most powerful warriors, the Ginyu Force, arrive. An unlikely alliance is formed between Vegeta and the Z-Fighters to battle the formidable Ginyu's. In the end they all lost, but Goku arrives at the last minute to save the day. Things get a little typical from here. Goku stomps out the entire Ginyu force, leaving only two members alive. After he outclasses them Captain Ginyu uses a really cheap body swap technique to steal Goku's body and drag the fight on to a slow, dreadful end. After all that, we're back where we started. Goku is too hurt to fight, and Vegeta must maintain his alliance with the Earthlings while they try to figure out how to get the Dragon Balls to work.

The story has it's high points and it's low points. The opening episodes are really slow and boring, and while the fighting between Vegeta and Freeza's men is all good, the finale leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth. The story is a lot more dynamic then what you typically get in DBZ. It's interesting to see all these different factions fighting over and trying to hid/steal the Dragon Balls. Vegeta brings a nice wild card element to the action, and proves himself to be a very cunning warrior as he outsmarts his enemies over and over again.

There's also some interesting notes about the audio. The beginning of the set is all new English dubbing to make up for the work that Funimation had never dubbed to this point. These new lines where substantially different from the previous dubbing and it also featured frequent swearing, which was new for the English version at this point. Unfortunately when Funimation catches up to it's original dub work, it leaves most of the audio as it originally was. The old background music comes back and sounds pretty horrible compared to the new music. While a handful of old characters continued to be redubbed for the sake of consistency (Vegeta, Krillin, Dende) many were never redubbed. For the most part this is inconsequential, but Funi was a very small company when they first dubbed these episodes and the voice actors weren't nearly as talented as they have since become. Roshi sounds like a really bad Elvis impersonator, for one. This would be a bigger problem in later box sets, but I'll talk about those issues later. It also means that while much of the dialog at the beginning of the set featured swearing, the second half features almost none.

Overall this set is an excellent purchase for any DBZ fan!",1261872000,,4326,4.678055190538765
2748888,5,B000MTOM8A,No complaints. All the episodes are there in good quality. Recommended to any DB fan,1260576000,,84,4.666666666666667
2748889,5,B000MTOM8A,"It's the series that started it all... ""Dragon Ball"".  Originally, a manga series written and illustrated by Akira Toriyama for ""Shonen Jump"", the manga series lasted from 1984 through 1995 and since the manga series has produced several anime series which include ""Dragon Ball"", ""Dragon Ball Z"", ""Dragon Ball GT"" and currently in Japan, a new HD broadcasting of ""Dragon Ball Kai"" and in 2009, an American live action film titled ""Dragonball Evolution"" was released worldwide.

""Dragon Ball"" is the first arc of the series which aired in Japan from 1986 through 1989 and lasted for 153 episodes.  The series was released by Harmony Gold USA in the late 80's and then by FUNimation Entertainment in 1995 and uncut episodes were released on DVD in 2003.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

When I first saw ""Dragon Ball"", it was probably back in 1992 and the quality of this raw Japanese video was so rough and hard to watch, it was just bad.  Several years later, I was able to catch the first few episodes that aired on television but the problem was that the schedule was inconsistent and our television network was quite bad.

So, it is great to see this uncut, remastered and digitally restored version on DVD.  Presented in its original format of 4:3, one thing I noticed is how good this anime series looked on DVD.  The series is nearly 25 years old and just watching it, FUNimation Entertainment did a great job in bringing this series out and making it look very good with only a hint of dust particles and scratches but for the most part, this remastered version definitely looked very good on DVD.

As for the audio, similar to the recent FUNimation Entertainment ""Dragon Ball Z"" and ""Dragon Ball GT"" releases, the English voice track with original Japanese music comes in 5.1 Surround, while the Japanese voice track is in its original Japanese mono.  I watched both English and Japanese and of course, there are some changes in the English dialogue (ie. Master Roshi  and in the Japanese track, Kamesama Sennen) and grew up watching the original Japanese version but for the most part, I have enjoyed the ""Dragon Ball Z"" and ""Dragon Ball GT"" dubwork and similar to those two series, I found th English dubwork for ""Dragon Ball"" to be quite solid.  Dialogue is clear and understandable and for audio settings, for both audio tracks, I found the best setting for me was to select on my receiver ""Stereo on all Channels"".

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Dragon Ball - Season Two"" comes with the textless opening and closing theme songs and FUNimation Entertainment trailers.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Another action packed volume of ""Dragon Ball"" and this time around, the battles become more prevalent as Goku takes on the Red Ribbon Army and Mercenary Tao.  But my favorite episodes feature characters such as Android 8 and Arale but things are definitely getting more interesting with the arrival of Mercenary Tao and an opponent that actually is much more powerful than Goku (at that moment).  Also, to watch this series once again, not only was it a nostalgic time for me, it was just great to see the episodes and watching how fun, humorous and action-packed they were.  Although, ""Dragon Ball"" is not as intense as ""Dragon Ball Z"", the series still manages to capture a lot of action.  Bare in mind that Goku is a young boy in this series but even so,  he still has enormous power including his recently learned ""kamehameha"".

For parents wondering about the TV 14 rating, although the first volume featured some risque situations (ie. Goku putting his hand on crotches to see if they are male or female), if anything, there's nothing like that in this second volume although there is much more violence in this volume and characters are getting killed off.

As for the DVD, as mentioned, this is the best I have seen ""Dragon Ball"" look and 3o episodes for the first volume is pretty much a bargain for what it's sold for.  Granted, I wish there were some special features included outside of textless theme songs but overall, you're getting your money's worth with these box set releases.

Granted, if I had to find a negative and wanted to be nitpicky, I can easily complain that the fifth disc only contains three episodes and that the Japanese audio track was not in Dolby Digital 5.1 but truthfully, 30 episodes is still plentiful and for purists, you do get the Japanese audio track in its original mono format and its in 4:3 and not made to be widescreen.  Really, there is nothing I can really complain about this release.  It's a very solid release that is affordable and just worth it!

Overall, ""Dragon Ball - Season Two"" is another wonderful release from FUNimation Entertainment.  Fans of any of the ""Dragon Ball"" series will definitely want to make sure this one is in their collection.  Definitely recommended!",1258329600,8,8876,4.476577139287945
2748890,5,B000MTOM8A,"I hadn't seen Dragon Ball in over 20 years, but I remembered watching it with a pastor's then-5-year-old grandson back then. The label on the box says contents may not be appropriate for children under 14, and a quick watch showed me why.

Most of the sexual references flew over my 9-year old's head as we watched together (with my thumb positioned over the ""skip"" button on the remote). The only odd moment was in the Pengiun Village episode when Blue Shogun said a helpful boy was ""his type."" My daughter asked what they meant, and rather than explain paedophelia I gave a vague explanation that saying someone is your type means you like him/her.

My 9-year old loved Arare chan from the two Penguin Village episodes so much I wish someone would come out with Arare chan DVDs, also (or at least reprint the old Dr. Slump comics). She also liked the slapstick and body-function humor (e.g. Kame Sennin's accidentally farting when struggling to unbind himself from ropes). So far I haven't come across more problematic scenes where my duty as parental censor will come into play, but I remember from watching all those years ago that they're either in later Season 2 or Season 3 episodes. The violence can get intense at times, so I'll make sure the 3-year old isn't in the room when Tao Pai Pai comes on.

The colors in the DVD transfer are better than I remember, and the audio (I've only wathed with the original Japanese track) seems about the same. Maybe the animation doesn't dazzle me because my eyes have been so spoiled by Pixar over the past two decades. All in all, Dragon Ball has been lots of nostalgic fun for me and ""new"" entertainment to my 9-year old.",1257897600,,1670,4.597315436241611

2748893,5,B000MTOM8A,"Dragonball fans have been waiting for a proper Dragonball dvd set for years. Due to the fact that lionsgate owned the rights to the first 13 episodes and the first movie, we have NEVER had all the Dragonball episodes uncut on dvd. So now it is time to enjoy this series uncut, uncropped (fullscreen aspect ratio 4:3)in the way it was meant to be seen. With the first 31 episodes on dvd, Dragonball fans will be pleased.",1251676800,,419,4.454545454545454
2748894,5,B000MTOM8A,"The new first season set of Dragon Ball uncut isn't even out yet and they've already announced this season two set. While the main reason to buy the first is the first chance ever to own the original thirteen episodes uncut in a proper North American set most fans will probably continue on buying this one as well. I suspect many of those who already own this batch of episodes uncut on the old sets will buy this one as well in an effort to collect all the episodes in nice sets that complement each other when lined up on a shelf. Given the running time of 720 minutes this set should contain the following thirty episodes from the Red Ribbon Army, General Blue and Commander Red Sagas:

32 The Flying Fortress: Vanished!
33 The Legend of a Dragon
34 Cruel General Red
35 Cold Reception
36 Major Metallitron
37 The Ninja Murasaki is Coming!
38 Five Murasakis
39 Mysterious Android No. 8
40 Horrifying Buyon
41 The Fall of Muscle Tower
42 The Secret of Dr. Flappe
43 A Trip to the City
44 Master Thief, Haski
45 Danger in the Air
46 Bulma's Bad Day
47 Kame House: Found!
48 Deep Blue Sea
49 Roshi's Surprise
50 The Trap is Sprung
51 Beware of the Robot
52 The Pirate Treasure

54 Escape From Pirate Cave
55 Penguin Village
56 Strange Visitor
57 Arale vs. Blue
58 The Land of Korin
59 The Notorious Mercenary
60 Tao Attacks!
61 Korin Tower

All these episodes are being presented in remastered editions of their original full frame (4:3 Aspect Ratio) format. Audio is being done with English or Japanese voice track options and the original Japanese musical score in 5.1 Surround. Funimation Dragon Ball releases haven't had any special features other than previews for other Funimation products, so don't expect to find any here either.

I'm very happy with the cover art selection for these titles so far. Let's hope they don't start just throwing random characters on the cover (Piccolo on Dragon Ball Z Season 7??? What was that?). Hopefully all the Dragon Ball sets will come out as fast as these first two, thanks for your time.",1251158400,35,2058,4.512064343163539

2748896,5,B000MTOM8A,"I've been a diehard ""DragonBall Z"", ""DragonBall"", and ""DragonBall GT"" fan ever since I was six years old and I love this DVD boxset! In this remastered boxset, the entire Namek Saga and the Captain Ginyu Sagas are in it. In the Namek Saga, after the Saiyan Saga ends, Piccolo died, so Goku is training in case they are attacked by someone else, and Bulma, Gohan, and Krillin decide to go to the planet Namek to search for the Dragon Balls to revive Piccolo. After they accidently get tricked into going to a fake planet Namek by some shapeshifting aliens and eventually get to the real planet Namek, Vegeta, who's also searching for the Dragon Balls, shows up, and they all find out that Frieza, one of my favorite villains from ""DragonBall Z"", and his henchmen, Dodoria, the big, pink, spiky alien, Zarbon, a good-looking alien that transforms into a monsterous form, and his Frieza Soldiers, are taking over the planet to search for the Dragon Balls so Frieza can wish for immortality so he can rule the universe/world, so Gohan, Krillin, and the rest of the heroes try to stop him. In the Captain Ginyu Saga, after the good guys battle Frieza and his henchmen for a while, and some of the henchmen die, Frieza's Ginyu Force, a bunch of obnoxious, dancing/posing henchmen he hired, led by Captain Ginyu, come to the planet Namek and try to help Frieza find the Dragon Balls and get rid of the good guys, and this saga leads up to the Frieza Saga, that's in the next boxset. All thirty-five episodes (the Namek Saga and the Captain Ginyu Saga combined) are in it; you get all of the episodes, including ""Escape from Dodoria"", the first episode of ""DragonBall Z"" that I ever saw, ""Goku is Ginyu and Ginyu is Goku"", the one where Captain Ginyu uses his shapeshifting/body-switching ability/attack to switch bodies with Goku and attack Gohan, and the very funny ""Captain Ginyu the Frog"" episode where Goku tricks Captain Ginyu into body-switching with a frog so Goku can defeat him. The only things that I miss on the boxset are that there's no scene selection feature and that the original American music from Bruce Faulconer isn't there, but the show is still amazing! I love this boxset and I can't wait to get the rest of them: Season One, Season Three, Season Four, Season Five, Season Seven, Season Nine, and the DragonBall GT Season Two boxset and all of the DragonBall boxsets!",1247529600,,2383,4.6761904761904765
2748897,5,B000MTOM8A,"Let me start off by saying this...If you are worried about buying this set because of the well known ""cropping-issue"" don't be. It's not nearly as bad as most people make it out to be. I finished watching it and there was not one instance where I could point out that it had in fact been cropped from the original episodes. I had to go online and find the comparisons to even notice. So yes there is cropping but in my opinion it in no way took away from the amazing experience of watching DBZ.

I think what I like about this the most is that they have redone the voice acting. You can now watch the entire Dragon Ball Z series start to finish with the same voice actors. That and the fact that you can get most of these sets for $24.99 makes this a steal of a deal.",1244073600,,767,4.079470198675497

This season was one I saw more than once, and the network always seemed to skip segments that left me confused as to what I missed.  After purchasing the whole season, and watching all the episodes, I got to fill in those missing blank spots from years ago.

2748910,3,B000MTOM8A,"The Dragon Ball Z Season Two DVD box includes six DVDs that contain thirty-five episodes.  The first five discs contain six episodes, while the sixth disc contains five episodes and the DVD extras.

One of my favorite things about this DVD set is the ""marathon feature.""  This allows you to watch all of the episodes back-to-back, but you only see the opening credits once; the ending credits are not shown when watching with the marathon feature.  This feature's really helpful when you're trying to watch all the episodes on a single disc in one night.

I was rather disappointed by the special features.  All you get are the textless versions of the opening and ending credits (which were previously included on the box set for the first season), and trailers.  To be honest, I didn't think these features were quite so ""special.""  The audio mastering levels for this DVD release were also an issue.  FUNimation's opening splash screen and the trailer at the beginning of each DVD were mastered at a high audio level, but then the menu and the actual episodes were mastered with a rather soft audio level.  This would mean having to have my volume turned way down until the main menu appeared; then, I would suddenly have to crank the volume back up quite a ways in order to hear the audio for the episodes.

While I was disappointed with the audio levels and the lack of special features, this set is still a ""must get"" for any Dragon Ball Z fan that wants all the episodes on DVD.  The price isn't too bad for what you get, but it would have been a little more worth the price if FUNimation had gone to a little more effort on the special features.",1224547200,,1653,4.547297297297297
2748911,5,B000MTOM8A,"Well this is a great addition to a DBZ fan's collection. On the single DVD's they had a really cool song that was replaced by the original Japanese start song, which is worse in my opinion. I have also heard some reviewers saying something about widescreen black bars, but on mine you could resize it so the video takes up 90% of the screen and the bars take up 10%. Also while the ""next time on DBZ"" is missing"", nothing else is, so unless your a die-hard collector, this shouldnt matter much as it was just a tv hook spot to get people to watch the show. If you have not seen the ORIGINAL TV spots of this show way back in the 90's, then, like me, you won't miss that much since you never knew about it to begin with. As for me, I read shone jump graphic novels of dragon ball and dragon ball z before I started watching the episodes. Still a great anime and there are some minor problems such that i mentioned before, but that won't affect the average fan. I'd say buy season 1 first, and if you like it, buy the rest because not much changes, because you can't change perfection, although this isn't ""perfect"", it's pretty damn close to it!",1220745600,,1144,4.252293577981652

Also i would of relay loved to have had the orignial Theme they had on the Cartoon network version (Rock the Dragon) but this one not bad.

2748916,5,B000MTOM8A,"Let me take a brief moment to get something off my chest before I start the review.  A little more than midway through we are introduced to the figure of Captain Ginyu and his ability to change bodies with other people.  We know Ginyu can switch bodies, we know that Ginyu is aware of Frieza's superiority.  Why doesn't he switch bodies with Frieza?  Not only does he not switch bodies he apparently doesn't even consider it.  He doesn't talk about he DOESN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.  If I served under an almost godlike boss and I had to power to transfer bodies I certainly would consider the possibility of a switch.  Either he is incredibly stupid or incredibly loyal or Frieza has some defense against a switch.  Considering how much filler gets thrown out onto the screen I'm amazed there isn't an overly long bit of Ginyu imagining himself as frieza.

  Oh well, now that I have said my piece on that topic I must say I enjoyed this season.  Compared to the end of the saiyan saga the action is somewhat sporadic.  The saga introduces Frieza, one of the most annoying villains of all time.  He is an obnoxious effeminate buffoon.  Clearly he is the most powerful being in the universe because if he wasn't he would be forcibly removed from his seat of power.  However, Vegeta, who is recovering from his beatdown at the end of season one, clearly doesn't possess the same loyalty that Captain Ginyu does to his superior and plots rebellion, even though he seemingly has no chance of matching Frieza's power.  His gambit?  The dragonballs which he learned about while on earth.  He heads to the planet Namek to obtain them.  Of course, things are never easy for the Saiyan prince as his attempts to become immortal are thwarted by Krillin and Gohan who are there to get the D-balls to bring their dead friends back to life(are they ever used for anything else?)  Much fighting begins when the Ginyu force is hired by Frieza who(like all good megalomaniac villains) refuses to do his own dirty work until he is left with no other option.  Frieza's arrogance in the end is what bring's his downfall.  But I am getting ahead of myself.  This saga is not as epic as the next one but there is a little more variety and different adventures to be found.  There is also a bunch of filler to be found but isn't that always the case.  I think it's a great saga.",1214870400,,2355,4.508274231678487

2748925,3,B000MTOM8A,"The chase is on for the Dragon Balls of the planet Namek, but this time there is more to worry about than just Vegeta. It seems there is a much more powerful being out there with alot of skeletons in his closet. Enter the all powerful Tyrant Frieza, he has stolen Vegeta's idea for immortality and with a whole army of bloodthirsty killers. It's up to the cunning of Bulma, Krillin and Gohan to try and stop them all in time before either evil power gets all the Dragon Balls and of course before Goku gets to Namek to help them.

This re-issued dvd has put together two sagas wisley for the second season. As a real Dragon Ball Z fan knows there are long sagas and short sagas. There is no reason to put all the sagas in seperate boxes so why not put a few together just to get 6 disc sets out to the public. I am sure season 4 will be comprised of possibly three sagas altogether. Once again the re-mastering is great the picture is clear the sound is great and now that it's all uncut there is so much more to see and it all flows well. The only reason I gave this dvd only 3 stars is just because the saga its self is very boring. There is really not much that goes on but a big chase for the dragon balls and a little bit of character development. On a lighter note there is one thing that made me so happy to see when the Captain Ginyu Saga began they did not touch the Bruce Falconer soundtrack they re-mastered and enhanced it to make it sound so much better than origional released. You gotta give Funimation credit, they know how to please their fans.",1194393600,,1561,4.16887417218543
2748926,4,B000MTOM8A,"I have been a fan of DBZ since it first started airing in North America, I never bought any of the previous DVDs though ($25 for 3 episodes is a rip-off). The visual/audio quality is great considering it's an anime that originally aired in the early 1980s and had a very tiny budget. There are 35 episodes in this set:

1)Held Captive (Bulma, Krillin and Gohan convince the kids on the ship that they are not allies of Frieza)
2)Friends or Foes? (Bulma, Krillin and Gohan land on what they think is Namek and find two Namekians willing to help them find the Dragon Balls)
3)The Search Continues (Bulma, Krillin and Gohan face more dangers as they continue their search for the Dragon Balls. Back on Earth, Goku escapes from the hospital and resumes his training).
4)A Friendly Surprise (Bulma, Krillin and Gohan find out that they are not really on Namek and that it was just a trap. Goku continues his training, and Vegeta decides to go to Namek for the Dragon Balls.)
5)Brood of Evil (Bulma, Krillin and Gohan arrive at the real Namek, only to find out that Vegeta is on his way there as well.)
6)Frieza Strikes! (Bulma, Krillin and Gohan discover Vegeta's space pod, but he is the least of their worries since the tyrannical Frieza is also on Namek and looking for the Dragon Balls.)
7)Defying Orders (Krillin and Gohan realize that they will need help against Frieza, and Goku begins his journey to Namek using a spaceship built for him by Dr. Briefs.)
8)Namek's Defense (Frieza and his henchmen Dodoria and Zarbon find the location of the 6-star Dragon Ball and demand that the villagers give it to them and the Namekians start to fight back.)
9)The Hunted (After seeing one Namekian child killed and another about to be, Gohan can't hide anymore and he and Krillin grab to kid and flee.)
10)The Prince Fights Back (Dodoria continues searching for Krillin and Gohan. Vegeta comes acroos Dodoria and decides to get revenge.)
11)Unexpected Problem (Goku continues on his 6 day journey to Namek but gets knocked off coarse by an asteroid. Now he has to put on a spacesuit and repair the damage.)
12)Vegeta has a Ball (Vegeta uses his new ability to sense energy levels to find a Namekian village and take their Dragon Ball. Frieza now has 5 Dragon Balls, Vegeta has 1, and the last one belongs to the Eldest Namekian.)
13)The Past and Future (While on his journey to Namek, Goku hears that his friends Tien, Chiaotzu, Yamcha and Piccolo have arrived on King Kai's planet. King Kai is disturbed to hear that Goku is rushing to face Frieza, and Vegeta begins his fight with Zarbon.)
14)Zarbon's Surprise (After Vegeta takes the upperhand in his fight, Zarbon transforms and increased his size and power.)
15)Guru's Gift (Krillin and Dende speak to the Eldest Namekian, Guru. Guru not only gives them his Dragon Ball, but he also awakens the sleeping power within Krillin.)

Onto the bad things about the set. The only closed captioning on the DVD are for the Japanse dialogue (the literal English translantion of the Japanse dialogue), making it worthless to those who are deaf or hard of hearing and would like the know what the Enlish dialogoue is. Another annoying and bizarre thing is that the names of the episodes are the Japanese titles (in actual Japanese), which I find inexcusable since the season 1 DVD release had the English titles. FUNimation has also chosen not to include the ""Next time on Dragon Ball Z!"" scenes that are included on the TV airings even though they have the ""Last time on Dragon Ball Z!"" ones. It's still a great release though for any Dragon Ball Z fan, and these minor annoyances are the only thing stopping it from being 5 stars. I hope they do season sets for Dragon Ball GT next.",1193616000,,7476,4.794573643410852

2748931,4,B000MTOM8A,"Quick Facts: I'm 27, been a fan of Dragon Ball Z since 1999, and a fan of anime since 1992. I'm very picky about uncut anime, and I always prefer the original aspect ratio. I dislike English dubs as most any anime fan does. This is my first review of a DVD.

Video: FUNimations claims this is a widescreen transfer from the original video. Dragonball Z fans are screaming the original video was cropped to make it widescreen. I've spent the last 2 days with WinDVD and Photoshop to confirm or disprove this. Anyone who does image editing knows that cropping a 4:3 image to 16:9 can be really dramatic. After watching 67 episodes of this new release from FUNimation, I wasn't completely convinced about the transfer being cropped from it's original 4:3 aspect ratio. Dragonball Z fans are correct to say the widescreen transfer is cropped, but they also would need to admit to that the 4:3 broadcast we fans know and love was also cropped! The widescreen transfer has extended video on the left and right that was cropped for the original 4:3 TV broadcast some 18 years ago. A time when 4:3 televisions were standard. In recent times, 16:9 televisions have taken over, and we're much more widescreen oriented. The original animation aspect ration I got when I was done sizing and layering the images over each other from the 4:3 and 16:9 gave me a 16:11 aspect ratio. This my Dragon Ball Z fans... Seems to be the ORIGINAL size. 16:11 though won't look all that great on any TV set. Also makes sense though since animators make the original larger so when transferring the animation to video, there's room to play with so you don't have random spots missing on the sides, top and bottom. So if you have to ask yourself if this is a legitmate 16:9 transfer or some 4:3 cropped (cut/edited) video, the real answer is... It's a legimate 16:9 transfer. Both the 4:3 and the 16:9 are cropped from the original... In the end, it depends on personal preference.

The video was supposedly cleaned up, and the colors remastered. Personally, For the most part, I see an increased brightness on the video, which actually does look better. They did clean up the video and removed grain and video noise. All in all, the remastered picture looks better compared to the original DVDs that FUNimation released.

Audio: I can't say much about the sound quality since I'm using my computer for the time being. Just moved, and have yet to hook up my home theater again. FUNimation is releasing this with 3 settings. The original Japanese language and music. Nothing seems to have changed between the original DVDs and this release. For those who watch DBZ subbed only, I see no change at all. The second option is the English dub with the Japanese music. This is actually quite interesting, and I give credit for this addition! In this rare instance, I have always like the dubs for Dragon Ball Z, so having the option to watch it with the original music is great. If that isn't enough though, this new way to watch the series is in Dolby Digital 5.1. Then there's the third option which is the English dub with the US music done by Bruce Faulconer in stereo. I guess doing this in 5.1 would have taken too much time.

The dub was also redone for whatever reason. After comparing the original DVDs vs the new ones, the older ones sometimes seem a bit more consistent with what was originally being said. One quick example would be this...

Japanese Audio: Vegeta ""I suppose""
Original English Dub: Vegeta ""I guess so""
New English Dub: Vegeta ""Shut up!""

Why FUNimation went out of the way to do a whole new dub, I have no idea... This seems to be wasteful of production time, or maybe they can't use the original dub anymore. Why FUNimation does anything at times is beyond my understanding. They have time to redub the series, but they can't make the English dub with the US music in 5.1...

The menus on these discs are light years ahead of the original DVDs FUNimation released, with much more chapter points, and the MARATHON option which allows you to watch all the episodes on a disc straight through without the opening/closing between the episodes. More like watching a movie than episode after episode, having to skip after each one.

The packaging of the discs in the case is rather nice. Seems upon collection the series, you can line them up for a large ""DRAGONBALL Z"" title! Each season comes with a small booklet with character information, episode information, etc.

Also want to note that according to FUNimation, this video was remastered on HD 1080/24p. This doesn't mean the discs are HD and can optimize the new HDMI 1.3, but it does show that 1080/24p mastering is being done, and we're probably not far off from seeing this much more commonly done and seeing HDDVDs with actual 1080/24p video as TVs are now coming out with HDMI 1.3.

I hope this information helps people looking to possibly buy this series or in the case I'm in, buy it again for the remastered video and widescreen version. Also much more compact compared to dozens of standard DVD cases!

Giving this 4 stars. Why not 5? Because there is still room for improvement. The new dub doesn't always seem to fit, and in comparison to the actual translation of what was being said, it's like comparing black and white. FUNimation was always lousy about the dub translation, and there's little excuse for rebubbing the series and making it just as poor as the first time around. Making the English Dub with Japanese music 5.1, but the US music in 2.0 is another point away from me. While this doesn't change anything for me, if they had the time to redub and upscale to 5.1 for the Japanese music, it seems to me they should have taken the time to upscale the US music track too. Lazy? Additionally, they should have some slight explanation of the widescreen transfer included. The extras on the discs are meaningless.

For the price these new box sets go for... It's an unbeatable deal for the series and Dragon Ball Z fans.",1188172800,39,5987,4.621825023518344
2748932,5,B000MTOM8A,I watched all six discs over the weekend it was great.  Digitaly remastered looks fantastic.  Can't wait for the next saga to come out digitally remastered.  Cheers Guys!,1186963200,,170,5.0
2748933,4,B000MTOM8A,"The only flaw in this set is the fact that the episodes are not presented in their original aspect ratio.  The series was initially filmed on 16mm film, with an aspect ratio of 1.37:1.  For TV, VHS, and early DVD releases, the episodes were presented in the close-enough television ratio of 1.33:1.

In making these Dragon Ball Z box sets, FUNimation decided to crop the image in a unique way:  they chopped off the top and bottom of the picture in each frame and left the sides alone, thus converting the picture to a widescreen format, which I'd guess at 1.85:1.  Their official reason for this was that the top and bottom of each of the thousands of frames per reel were damaged, and that this solution to the problem was the easiest.

It was also the stupidest.

FUNimation could easily have obtained better transfers from Japan, the country that recently remastered all of their Dragon Ball series and released them on Region 2 DVD boxsets (titled ""Dragon Box"").  This problem does not necessarily affect the user's enjoyment adversely.  This, however, is the only major flaw on these two Dragon Ball Season sets.

The picture looks great, the colours seem balanced, and the audio is crisp.  In addition, the English audio is uncut.  The American dubbed audio is the highlight of this set, since the voices presented are those that people living in North America have grown accustomed to hearing, notwithstanding the fact that the voices originally heard in these two seasons have been rerecorded with the voice actors used after the middle of the Frieza Saga to perpetuity.

Furthermore, the video, despite being cropped, is uncut in that it is devoid of television edits.  All blood, mild swearing, broken bones and severed limbs remain.

It is hoped that FUNimation will eventually be able to release the entire series of Dragon Ball completely uncut.  In the meantime, at least three of these sets are coming out this year, the next on Sept. 18.  Moderately priced, they're worth every penny.

In all, I rate this box set, as it's predecessor, a 4 out of 5.",1186531200,,2066,4.788135593220339

This set contains 2 sagas. The Namek and Ginyu sagas. I enjoyed season 1, but I thought this was a little bit better. This season mostly focuses on Vegeta, Gohan, and Kurillin(don't know if I spelled it right.)

2748936,5,B000MTOM8A,"I'm not going to get too deep into the remastering debate. Personally, I own a 1080p 50"" and this series looks amazing, especially when compared to the way the DVDs used to look and the way the show looked on Cartoon Network. I love this series, and the only gripe I have is the music. I liked Bruce Falconer's mix a lot when I first watched the series, but hearing the first 50-60 episodes with a more epic and orchestrated soundtrack (audio 2 on the dvd) made me wish that Funimation rewrote the entire soundtrack. I'm not a fan of the japanese music, though, either as it's a bit too cheesy and old sounding. The series just seemed more meaningful listening to strings, choirs, etc. Also, getting these uncut, even in English, is so nice. If you're a fan of the Japanese version, or the English version, this collection is highly recommended.",1182729600,,845,4.565789473684211

As far as I'm concerned, I like having a clean, new looking set of episodes.  I understand that it is hard to retransfer all the eps into DVD and touch up the problems caused by the old, soft, and dirty film used in producing this show.  To me it is alright to not have a little bit of Goku's torso in the shot.  The story is what I'm watching for.  I hope the people that are whining so much don't cause Funimation to cancel this series of boxsets like they did the last one.",1182124800,4,629,4.024193548387097
2748938,2,B000MTOM8A,"Dragonball deserves better, the fans deserve better.

I was concerned with the Widescreen issue and find that I just don't like it. I was annoyed by how often characters' heads are cut off or just touching the edge of the frame. It's often the case that the missing area would've given just enough room to give the shot some(needed) breathing room. As it is, it feels cramped, not just that something is missing.

I was hoping to own the series some day but I just don't want to invest in another flawed attempt that leaves the door open for yet another dip into the pot of gold that the fans represent.

How can The distributor miss the point after 2 'uncut' versions that clearly reflects the desire for the original version? Stop 'fixing' it, okay?

2748941,2,B000MTOM8A,"To start off, I did not watch this set on hardware that would be considered anything near good. A ten year-old analog television and a Playstation 2 were the means I used to watch this set. I'm a long time fan (maybe not as long as some, but this is my ninth year of fandom) and this is the first time I've ever owned all these episodes. So here's my review:

The packaging:

Most people do not like the packaging used for these sets. Personally, I'm a fan of them. They're compact and pretty nice for the price. They are reminiscent of the packaging common among bootleg sets, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. Don't get me wrong, the images used for these sets so far have been mediocre at best, and by no means do they compare by the Japanese singles or the Dragon Boxes.

Overall: 5/10

The video:

I can not compare the quality of this release to previous releases (other than the season 1 set), but they did a lot more wrong with it than right. First of all, lighter-skinned characters look white in some scenes. This really bothered me, personally, and distracted me at times. I eventually grew used to it along the way, but it was odd to say the least. Another complaint I'd have is that, like many before me, this really isn't a remastered set. The video looks a lot better than previous releases from FUNimation, but it still doesn't compare to the Dragon Box footage (comparing it to screenshots alone). And finally, the widescreen! I didn't mind it in the first set, but I noticed it a lot more in this one. This aspect of the set alone, combined with FUNimations false advertising that you are seeing more with these sets, is enough to hinder the video to utter crap.

Overall: 3/10

The audio:

This is one aspect of the set that shines, in my opinion. You get three different audio tracks to watch this set in. I have not watched either of the English tracks for this set. I watched the entire thing with the original Japanese track. Even with my stereo, the mono Japanese track sounded wonderful. I have two complaints about it, though. One of the episodes got really soft on me for the entirety of the episode and they could have touched up the track a bit like they did with the Japanese releases, but I'm just nitpicking. Also, they could have included the Mexican dub on these sets like they did with the UUC DVDs, but again I'm just nitpicking. As for the English tracks, I've heard that the  background music and sound on the English w/ original Japanese music track is really soft. Another thing that people have found weird is FUNimation's choice to redub certain characters for these episodes, but not others.

Overall: 8/10

The menus:

Not much to say about the menus for these sets other than they seem like they really did not care to put much of any effort into them. Various static images of characters from these episodes. Not impressed in the least.

Overall: 1/10

The extras:

Again, not much to say about the extras. You get trailers and a textless opening and ending. No effort at all, when they could have done so much more.

Overall: 2/10

The content:

There is some really bad filler in these episodes, but I didn't really have much trouble sitting through it. This set probably has the least amount of real content than any other one we will be seeing. There is no major conclusion or battles, but this does not mean the episodes aren't enjoyable. Containing the first half of the Freeza arc, these episodes were quite enjoyable. As a fan, I love these episodes because of nostalgia and the fact that you see Goku on his way to becoming a Super Saiyan. To any fans of the series, these episodes will be enjoyable and fun. But if you aren't already a fan of the show, you might find them boring and simply a means to move the story along into the battle against Freeza. So here's my somwhat biased score:

Overall: 7/10

Conclusion? You probably won't be buying this set based on my review. If you bought the first one, you'll likely be getting this one too, inorder to finish you collection, or because it's ""So cheap!!!"" Either way, these sets are a slap in the face to the fans. I won't defend my purchase because these sets are simply coming out as I get back into the show and want to finally see it in Japanese. These sets are cheap, and that really shows. If you're a hardcore fan, they probably anger you to no end. If you're just getting into the show, go for it. Or if you're like me, and have waited too long to see these episodes in Japanese, go for it. There are better alternatives  and there will probably be more in the future.",1180656000,3,4600,4.4523809523809526
2748942,4,B000MTOM8A,"For many, such as myself, Dragon Ball Z is many people's first introduction to the world of anime. Granted there is better anime out there from story to character to animation but there's a kind of accessibility that exists with this show that makes it ideal, unlike let's say Neon Genesis Evangelion which can give your brain a workout regardless of how many times you've seen it. Taking place directly after season 1 (the Vegeta saga), the Namek saga is spotty in parts but it's still fun nonetheless.

The season starts off mainly following 3 storylines: overexerted from the fight with Vegeta, Goku struggles to get back to full health just in case Vegeta comes back. Goku's son Gohan, and his friends Bulma and Krillin are on their way to planet Namek to gather the 7 titular balls to wish back their friends that were killed off by Vegeta and his former sidekick, Nappa. Meanwhile, Vegeta is travelling through space and is on the path to recovery when he receives news that an incredibly powerful warrior named Frieza is on his way to Namek to get the Dragon balls for himself. The 3 storylines will end up intersecting, just as a mysterious elite force arrives on the planet, that of the Ginyu Force.

It was my cousin who got me into this show halfway through the Vegeta saga and I was quite hooked ever since. And like nostalgic things, regardless of the time gaps, things just stay with you. This on the other hand is the show but it feels different and it's down to the voices. Given a new dub, the show's dub is serviceable but I miss the old voices. One minor character in the beginning of the season says the words ""I see only one, where's Nappa?"" in the original as a very lizard-like rasp, now he just sounds like a regular guy. And Vegeta with season 2 being arguably my favorite voice and almost being the epitome of an arrogant tone, now sounds way too gruff, as if he's a 3-pack a day smoker. We get the Japanese dub but it's in awful Mono whereas the English gets a 2 channel and a 5.1. Ugh.

As for the season itself, it's kind of all over the place. It's probably got the most laborious set of opening episodes I've sat through with Gohan's team landing on a Namekian planet, or is it? Once they arrive on the planet, things really kick into gear as the group as to fight or outrun several of Frieza's warriors and Vegeta even gets in on the action. And the Ginyu force as always been one of those groups that are so powerful yet such oddballs. It's one of those kind of seasons where individual episodes probably aren't the strongest yet taken as a whole it at least gives a solid enjoyment.

While I am partial to the original English dub, this is serviceable and good for DBZ fans.",1180483200,,2708,4.442655935613682

The widescreen did crop the image, but not so much that it distracted me. After a while I forgot it was cropped. I wish some lines in the dubbed version were changed, because being the big fan that I am I am bothered by it and it is annoying. Ofcourse the marathon feature is great. The extras are nothing but textless songs. The dvd set itself is not all that good, but for me getting 35 uncut episodes  remastered at a good price is all that really matters. If you love DBZ buy this DVD, but if a little cropping gets to you then don't, cuz really it only was a little cropping, continue buying other sets for $10.00 or so that only include 3 episodes and watch how your wallet empties.",1180396800,,857,4.131736526946108

But comparing the first season to this new redubbed version of the Namek Saga, I couldn't help but be blown away. Many fans across the country would agree with me that the dubbed Namek Saga of the late 1990's. Many scenes were cut, endless censorship, and the dialogue and the voice acting was terrible. With the redubbed version of these 30 some episodes ushers in a new era of Dragon Ball Z that completely wipes out the memory of those horrible horrible Saban plaqued episodes that we all gagged at. (I'm sure some of us even cried with how bad it was). Regardless, Funimation has come a long way and has sucessfully created a new version of the dub that (at times) can even be more entertaining than the original japanese version.

2748948,1,B000MTOM8A,"With the first season set getting some mixed reactions from all fans, you would think that FUNimation would at least have the decency of cleaning up any problems they put upon themselves, specifically, the widescreen. However, this is basically the same quality release as the last set, with the only difference being the episodes.

Episode-wise, I think this set covers one of the best episodes of the first half of the series. Even the filler episodes are actually related to what's going on at that time, unlike later filler like Gohan's random birthday. For those not in the know, the heroes are off to planet Namek, where the original dragon balls were created, so they may resurrect their fallen comrades who died against the Saiyans in the previous season set. But when they finally reach the planet, they find that new villains are after the dragon balls for their own greed. Filled with some of the smartest moments in the series (throwing dirt at the other guy to momentarily blind them, stealing the dragon balls from each other, hiding their power levels from the scouters, etc.), this is definitely one of the better arcs, balancing the massive amount of fights with some clever strategies to boot.

Sadly, all this is practically nulled out by what FUNimation has done to this release, mainly, the false remastering and the widescreen. While some of the scenes look beautiful, others really stand out. The main problems with the remastering are the outlines of characters and objects suddenly disappearing, and the over-brightening of the lighter colors. This is just something that words themselves cannot explain and that one must see themselves to fully comprehend. And while brighter colors may be a good thing, they make it a lot easier to spot out the random black blotches (wear and tear from the film masters) that appear on occasion. I personally think the remastering job seemed like someone just pushed a button to do the job and walked away, failing to oversee the job in case things like the aforementioned would happen.

And the widescreen... ah the widescreen... how random of a move was that? As opposed to what others may have said, this series was NOT meant to be viewed in widescreen format. It was a series that ran from the early `80s to mid `90s. Like the other shows of that time period, it was made with the intention of it being viewed in fullscreen (4:3). While removing the top and bottom does not ruin the viewing experience entirely, just the fact that it WASN'T ""the way it was meant to be seen"" can really get under your skin. I'll stop on that topic before I go into a major rant.

And with all these strange decisions on FUNi's part, they add in one more thing by changing up the original dub voices. When these episodes were originally dubbed, the voice acting (as well as big chunks of the script) was far from perfect. So, they try fixing that up by re-dubbing all the characters who could be re-dubbed (Krillin, Vegeta, Ginyu). The problem is that the Captain Ginyu episodes were only partially re-dubbed, with Vegeta and Krillin's current American voice actors, but with Goku's older voice work. It's just so strange and random.

I don't really mind the packaging of the episodes, with the discs overlapping each other. If it saves space, then all the better. The only minor grip I have is how it looks. I mean, have you seen it? It's a big orange brick.

Even the ""special features"" couldn't save this set. All the negative aspects are just so bad, especially since we know that FUNimation could have released things in their normal non-remastered (but still watchable) and fullscreen version. I mean, they've done it with the past single disc releases, so why not now? Also, the special features are nothing but trailers. I would have liked something like a comparison between the American and Japanese version, or some Toonami promotional commercials, but I guess that would be asking for too much.

In conclusion, I think this second set could have been vastly improved upon, fixing up all the problems with the first set. But instead, it looks like we'll be stuck with these releases. So, I'm gonna say you're better off with FUNimation's 3-episodes-per-disc releases. You can get most of them for under $10 nowadays, anyways.

The only reason I've bought this set (and the last one) is because they're the only episodes you can't get uncut without resorting to importing the Japanese releases. If you've got the money to spring for the Japanese releases, then go for it. Otherwise, these releases are your best bets in getting the first 74 episodes. Episodes 75 and on can be purchased via the single disc releases.

NOTE: If this review didn't make sense at certain points, that's only because FUNimation is doing so much random and uncalled for things to the Dragon Ball Z series that confusion was inevitable.

EDIT: And just for you haters out there, I will say that Funimation releasing the Dragon Box releases in the correct aspect ratio following this line of releases is proof enough that enough people weren't satisfied with these sets that a separate release had to happen. For those interested, these episodes can be found in better quality in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragon-Ball-Z-Dragon-Box-Two/dp/B002Y0KR7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragon Ball Z: Dragon Box Two</a>.",1179964800,22,5392,4.961240310077519
2748949,5,B000MTOM8A,"First the set itself, Great price, very noticeable picture/color improvements, its completely Uncut (Blood! in a number of interesting colors!) and the Widescreen feature is only noticeable every once and awhile.  The only problem is the so-called revised dialogue.  Funimation started dubbing the series at the end of this set i.e. the last 7 episodes.  I owned these so I ran one on my computer and one on the TV to see what is different because A. I was curious and B. I'm a huge nerd.  First off the only characters unchanged were Goku, Nail, one scene with King Kia 2 of 3 Bulma scenes and Jeise.  Sean Schemmel voiced the first three and to be honest needed to be changed.  Apart from sounding very different Goku's lines are all horrible.  He sounds too serious and his dialogue is like a Saturday morning cartoon superhero.  Only 1 single line was replaced and it was completely pointless.  Jeise also suffers from horrible lines and Bulma sounds like a valley girl.  Next comes the rest of the cast Vegeta, Krillin, Gohan, Frezia and Ginyu.  With the exception of Ginyu(who even sound eerily similar) all are redone by the same actor/actress as before but all there lines are redubbed.  The only thing is A. With the exception of Vegeta, who was still trying to sound like the actor he replaced in the old dub, all sound fairly close to how they sound today and B. Almost all the dialogue is THE SAME.  Why even botter.  Only about 8% of the lines were change even when a different guy did Ginyu.  At one point Vegeta even creates a new plot hole by calling Goku GOKU. Very out of character.  Even some minor no named character are redubbed and say EXACTLY the same thing.  Grunts even sound the same.  Granted the acting is a huge improvement but why not take out some of the stupider lines.  Some are cut but a lot of them stay in.  So what does this mean?  If you love DBZ buy it.  If you own the last 7 episodes on DVD it's still worth it because the 8% that was replaced is bad.  If you own the Frezia Saga on DVD when Season 3 Comes out don't bother replacing it.  It will be basically the same thing.  But if you don't own the Frezia saga, buy it, cuz that is the greatest fight of the series!",1179964800,,2209,4.3817733990147785
2748950,5,B000MTOM8A,"In the Dragon Ball Z Season Two DVD Box Set you get 35 episodes of the show, and specifically the Namek and Captain Ginyu Sagas. You can choose to watch these episodes in Japanese with the original Japanese music, or in English with either the Japanese music, or the English music that originally aired with the episode on television.

This set is composed of 6 discs, each having six episodes except the last which only has 5 and the extras. The extras are pathetic at best, but as I've already pointed out in the Season One Box Set, I bought this for the episodes themselves. You get 35 episodes of the show for a price much better than if you were to buy the episodes individually. Of course, the marathon mode is back where you can skip the opening, ending, and, ""Last time on Dragon Ball Z...."" part and instead watch every episode back to back. This is a terrific addition to these sets. Again, the top and bottom are cut off a bit, but not enough to take the enjoyment out of watching these episodes. After the first episode, you get used to this.

Season two focuses primarily on Krillin, Gohan, and Bulma as they journey to Namek in an attempt to use the namekian Dragon Balls to revive those killed by the saiyans. The majority of the season lacks Goku fighting anyone, but does have him training, Vegeta is a constant threat through most of the season until a power even greater than he can handle forces him to team up with our heroes.

As a big fan, I was wondering how and if they were going to redub the Ginyu saga as Funimation had already dubbed it once before. I hoped they would fix the voices as that was their first dub and many were off during the original dubbing. Thankfully, characters like Vegeta, Frieza, and Ginyu did have voice changes in the redub, but unfortunately others like Nail, King Kai, and Goku did not. All in all, this left me with a mixed feeling, but the voices that needed to be changed the most were and the others really didn't take away from the enjoyment of watching the episodes.

These two sagas take place almost entirely on Namek and action is abundant. Season Two is perhaps most important due to its introduction of Frieza, a monster so powerful even Vegeta fears him. Frieza is a truly evil and interesting villain. His minions also portray evil well. Vegeta seems very evil through most of the season, but eventually becomes an ally to our heroes. Again, this season has great characters, good fights, and best of all, ultimately leaves you wanting more. As the season ends, the summoning of Namek's dragon, which our heroes have been hoping to summon since before the season began, and the ultimate climactic battle against Frieza are both close at hand... A terrific set recommended for any fan of anime, or Dragon Ball Z.",1179878400,,2780,4.542914171656687
2748951,5,B000MTOM8A,"Cropping issue is NOT a big issue.  It does not distract from the great price and wickedness of this second set.  Watch it with Japanese language with Subtitles, it's much more enjoyable that way.  Peace!",1179792000,,204,4.771428571428571

The cropping was very brief, mostly unnoticable, and shouldn't b a problem here. When DBZ 1st came 2 the US, the Namek Saga was My favorite Saga, and now that its uncut it should be better than ever.

With the loads of action in Season 1 I'm hoping it'll be the same for season two; ""The Namek/Frieza saga.""
