8021146,5,B00023BMFW,"Macabra la Mano del Diablo AKA as Demonoid: Messenger of Death (1981), is certainly not horror cinema at its best, but it's the kind of film I enjoy. There are a surprising degree of horror films built on the proposition that the human hand can act individually (usually to annihilate people) if severed from the body or if surgically attached to a new body. In a Mexican mine, some ancient demon possesses the left hand of a woman. Stuart Whitman and Samantha Eggar in the present, battle against that ancient bloodthirsty demon which possesses people's left hands.

The Mexican director showed great imagination with an obviously low budget. A very interesting horror film, low production values aside.",1291766400,,704,5.017094017094017
