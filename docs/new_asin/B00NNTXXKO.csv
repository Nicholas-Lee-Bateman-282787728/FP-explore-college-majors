6673147,4,B00NNTXXKO,"One of the pleasures of watching Top Gear US is watching the relationship between the 3 hosts evolve. In the 4 years the show has been on, they've developed an easy comraderie.  They shoot zingers at each other constantly, groan whenever Tanner wins a challenge--which is often--and are relentlessly competitive. There are 2 fun episode commentaries that continue the tradition started with the first DVD set--true fans will know what I'm talking about.",1418515200,8,453,5.205479452054795

6673150,5,B00NNTXXKO,I really enjoy this show.  If you're thinking of buying it you probably do too.  This is were the guys really jell.  But what I didn't see in other reviews is this isn't just season 4.  It's also season 5.  20 full episodes with a ton of extras.  If you like this show this is great value.,1465171200,,289,3.982456140350877

6673152,5,B00NNTXXKO,"Tanner, Rut & Adam have nothing on the originals from UK Top Gear James, Jeremy & Richard but the American guys have their own flair and using more american cars than the UK Top Gear guys do is refreshing :)
This dvd only has challenges, no boring ""star in a reasonably priced car"" but then again doesnt have car reviews/test drives but every episode has a challenge so sure is worth what u pay",1457395200,,394,4.337837837837838

6673165,4,B00NNTXXKO,"So it's about this season that I think the cast and crew start getting more comfortable with each other.  But it's important to note that this is a VERY different show than the UK version.  The three hosts, while likeable enough, still seem a little awkward.  I don't think they have the easy rapport and chemistry that Clarkson, Hammond, and May do.

Which is OK.  I mean, it's a different show made for a different audience.  I really do appreciate that it's not trying to be a carbon copy of the UK version, which, if they did it, would be grounds for criticism from the other direction.  That said, while it's entertaining to watch (indeed, I enjoyed the Land Barge episode), I just feel like there's a spark missing.

The hosts are informative and I think it's one of the better shows on television.  In my opinion it pales somewhat in comparison to the UK version as this isn't nearly as over the top, but it's a good way to spend an hour.",1427241600,,945,4.416184971098266
