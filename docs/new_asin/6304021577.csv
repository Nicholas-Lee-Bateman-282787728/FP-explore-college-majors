5627214,5,6304021577,In the spirit and tradition of Tom Sawyer and the quest for the lost gold this story is one of the best I've seen in a long time. Jodi is a victim of abuse who has created a world for herself away from the pains of everyday life. Her friendship with the new girl in town is the basis of this story. This is an example of an excellent character study and a delightful adventure for all ages.,1267574400,2,390,4.012820512820513
5627215,5,6304021577,Purchased this to upgrade from the VHS copy I have. My family loves this movie! Picture and sound quality are far superior to the VHS tape. Another bonus I am surprised that Amazon didn't mention is that the DVD is Widescreen. I also tried this DVD in different players (including a PC drive) and it played OK. I recommend this DVD if you don't have a copy of this movie or if you want to upgrade from a VHS copy.,1266883200,2,413,4.175

5627316,5,6304021577,"I've liked this movie ever since it first came out when I was a kid. I still own my original VHS copy of it, and I've watched this movie many times over the years. The story has adult themes in it so that even if you are older, it doesn't watch entirely like a kiddie movie. There's alcoholism, abuse, broken families/homes, teenage runaways and stealing. You get to enjoy the beautiful views of the mountainside and forest and rivers of Virginia and British Columbia.
You have the lead character Beth (christina ricci) and her mother, who have just moved to Wheaton from LA. Her mother inherited a house from her sister and they move into it. Beth then runs into Jodi (Anna Chlumsky) who is the bad seed in town and has a notorious reputation for it. She's the product of a dysfunctional home, with an alcoholic mother whose boyfriend beats them both. They wind up becoming fast friends and Jodi reveals the Legend of Molly Morgan, who was a girl in the 1800's who disguised herself as a boy to travel across the country and then became a miner, but supposedly died in the collapse. The story has it that there's treasure buried in the mountain and Jodi has a map of it, so the two head out to the mountain to find the gold but Beth winds up getting trapped under some fallen rocks. Jodi has to find rescue for her and after Beth is saved, her mother forbids her from seeing Jodi. Finally her mother caves in and allows her to see her, but when she brings her to Jodi's where they find her mother badly beaten and the house a mess, and they must all go to the mountain to save Jodi who is being pursued by her drunken stepfather. They catch him and send him away and the girls receive an anonymous donation of two bags of gold.",1439164800,,1728,4.352941176470588

5627392,4,6304021577,"When a young teen (Beth- Christina Ricci) abandons city life in LA with her widowed mom in the summer of 1980 for a country town in the Pacific Northwest, she discovers the great outdoors and finds a very unusual best friend.

Jody comes from a dysfunctional home and lives with her drunken, divorced mom and abusive boyfriend. She (Anna Chlumsky) is a careless tomboy with a penchant for lying and thievery and is ostracized by her peers who suspect she's on a clear road to either a mental institution or prison. In the spirit of Huck Finn, Jody rejects ""civilized"" life and all the senseless cruelty it's given her... she's become a free-spirit who prefers the hidden depths of nature and Bear Mountain as her proper home. And one day she aims to find the gold hidden in Bear Mountain by the legendary Molly Morgan (her mountain woman idol).

I laughed the first time Beth spots Jody. Jodie totally looks like a cute boy. I appreciated that the story was more about friendship than finding the gold. It's an honest and emotional friendship that is made deep by loyalty and acceptance... and there are no friendships like the ones you find around this age. It has an excellent message. These two bond over chance meetings, a love for Winnie the Pooh, and on some level, probably because of the absent father thing. I don't think there is a stronger healing force than the bonds we have with other females, especially as a troubled teen.

This is a fun little pre/early teen adventure where nature is easily a secondary character and two females get to be the adventurers that boys are typically cast in. I found it very nostalgic. If you grew up with your own bit of nature you'd spend all day exploring while playing imaginary games with your friends, this will definitely bring you back. Loved the feel good song at the beginning and end.

Surprisingly, I'd never seen this one before (1995 release). But I'd put it on my list of movies to watch when a friend I know said she watched this one over and over as a confused youth and now she knows why, lol. Now I know why, lol. It's a cute one.",1387152000,3,2096,4.537037037037037
5627393,3,6304021577,"The discussion between the girls at one point (re: sex, nudity) was unnecessary.  Plot was interesting.  The ""secret"" stuff in the mountain was somewhat disappointing to me.

Keep that in mind when you read negative reviews about the quality of the transfer of this film to DVD.  Those reviews are NOT for this newly released DVD, so they can be safely ignored.

I gave this only 3 stars for the quality of the film itself, not for the quality of the DVD.  The widescreen video on the new DVD is perfectly fine, showing none of the flaws of the original release.

The movie is OK for its target audience, and while it has positive qualities, it isn't a great film.",1356739200,5,598,4.247787610619469

It didn't. It got so-so critical reviews and not enough fandom to demand a DVD release until now.

Whether adults will like it or not is harder to determine. I loved it re-watching it on ABC Family, but I had nostalgia. My parents didn't like the film as much as I did.

Your kids will love it though.",1295222400,5,562,4.0

5627479,2,6304021577,"The movie is just as cute as I remember. A fun kid-friendly movie.  That's why I gave this review a 2.  The movie itself, I'd rate higher, but the transfer to dvd brings the rating WAY down.

In other words, buying it as a DVD-R transfer is at your own risk. I ended up having to return this once and get a 2nd copy. The first one was badly burned and had several sections throughout the movie that jumped, skipped several seconds and froze making it unwatchable. I was able to get a replacement copy which just has one jump towards the end that I'll end up keeping as I have no idea if a good copy exists.

Also, they put no effort in this transfer at all.  For instance, the dvd has no menu. It automatically starts and it replays after the movie is over in an unending loop.  Also, there is a jump in the sound right in the first seconds of the opening that was there when the movie played years ago that is still there.

So in otherwards, if you've waited years to see this on DVD, you might want to give it a shot, but be prepared to get multiple copies before you get a workable one. Kind of a sad end for a good movie.  Here's hoping that they get enough business to make a real transfer of this movie!",1272326400,6,1209,4.093220338983051

If you want a positive film to show your children - particularly your girls - don't hesitate to grab this. I was 10 when my dad took me to see it and was elated to finally see it again all these years later.

I do wish there were bonus features, but considering it lingered in the ""vault collection"" (aka print-on-demand DVD-R) for so long before this, we're lucky to have what we have at all. This release is absolutely bare bones. The ""menu"" is a single screen that lets you play the movie and turn subtitles on & off, no chapter select or anything, so I'm docking one star for that.",1516752000,,742,4.188811188811189
