8066626,5,B0009UC81U,What more can you say about meet the fockers/meet the parents. They are the funniest comedies out there.  Not to mention the all star cast. Well worth the price for comedy at hand.,1217116800,,180,4.454545454545454
8066627,5,B0009UC81U,"The duo set of `Meet the Parents' and `Meet the Fockers' is a nice addition and a good buy if you don't already own one or the other.  Both of them are funny in their own rights, but truth be told, if you haven't seen `Meet the Parents' then you will miss most of the jokes in `Meet the Fockers'.  To me the first film is still the better of the two, although the second film has the whole rubber boob scene which is more than hysterical.  All in all these are two very funny movies that most everyone can enjoy.  Highly recommended.",1167868800,,533,4.145631067961165

Meet the parents is the story of Ted, the male nurse who is wishes to get married to his true love Pam. But, first, he goes with her on a vacation to her parents' house. There, Jack and Dina Burns get to meet him. But Jack, played beautifully by Robert De Niro used to work in the FBI and is worried about Ted who is unaware that this is his real proffession. The weekend goes terribly wrong as Ted gets put under Jack's lie ditector, burns down an altar, loses the ""gifted"" family cat, Jinxie, breaks Pam's engaged sister's nose and much more. Beleive me, it's a real treat for the whole family and is absolutely hilarious. I especially like the ending when Ted addresses a flight attendant who tells him that his bag can't fit in the over hand compartement.

It goes something like this:

Her: Sir, you're going to have to check that.

Him: No! Your stupid airlines already lost my bag and it really screwed things up.

Her: Sir, I can guarantee that it will be safely put below with all of the other luggage.

Him: Oh, can you guarantee that? Are you personally going to take my bag with the guys with the earmuffs and put it down below? ETCCCCC

You get the picture, but I didn't even give away the best part of that scene which is the last things that he says.

In the the sequel, Pam and her parents go to meet Ted's parents. I actually probably liked the sequel better, which is definitely something to say! Of course, things go awry with the over agressive dad (hilarious football scene)and the mom that's a sex therapist. Well anyway, I don't want to give anything away but it's trully hilarious. 1 example is when Ted's dad call him Gay (short for his full name, Gaylord Focker) and has a wall prepared which makes Jack say: ""I didn't even know that they made 12th place ribbons!"" And the cat flushes their dog down the toilet! Anyway, I don't want to give too much away but believe me it's hilarious and can be loved by all ages!",1119398400,9,2166,4.330864197530865
