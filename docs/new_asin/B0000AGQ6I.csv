7997150,2,B0000AGQ6I,"No peirda su tiempo o su dinero. Ya estan advertidos, esto es una broma o una payasada, lo unico bueno que tiene esta pelicula si se le puede llamar asi, es el caminado de la que hace el papel de la mujer de Bolivar.  Como asi que Bolivar anda a caballo por el (Santa Monica freeway en Los Angeles) hablando por cellular..
Va a Caracas por avion......que payasada es eso.
Lo del Santa Monica es por decir nomas, me estoy refiriendo por Bogota.",1368662400,,443,4.337349397590361
7997151,4,B0000AGQ6I,"This film was an easy watch and was more interesting when I was given a different way to look at it and it became even more amusing, up to then I did not know whether it serious or a comedy, it is a light comedy, no doubt.

Yes, some understanding of Latin history does make it easier to understand and to watch, but an understanding of present Latin American events makes this even better.

I was given a different way of looking at it when my partner (who is Latin American) made the comparison between the main character and Chavez, soooo funny but so close to the mark. I am not wanting to offend anyone with that comment but the comparisons are just too close.

Enjoyable movie, easy to watch and just good fun..... I would encourage people to watch it and make their own opinions.",1279756800,,786,4.36986301369863
7997152,5,B0000AGQ6I,"Este es uno de los mejores ejemplos de la calidad de cine que se hace en Colombia.
No solo es una produccin fenomenal con una actuacin impecable sino que la originalidad del tema y la presentancion del mismo que hace Jorge Ali Triana, es simplemente brillante! No se la pierdan!",1272240000,,278,4.58
7997153,3,B0000AGQ6I,"The merit of the movie is not technical (a department in which you will notice some crapy work), and not even the script (that oversimplifies the psychology of the characters). What it is good about it is the story itself: a real life story of an actor going mad and people going along. This marvelous story reminded me Cervantes novel. I think they could have made (and did not) a master piece. The end result is very good though.",1264204800,3,431,4.468354430379747
7997154,5,B0000AGQ6I,"The premise of this movie is quite simple: if Simon Bolivar reappeared, even in the figure of a TV actor, how would those around him react?  Would history repeat itself?  Both the government and the guerilla want the charisma provided by the fictional Bolivar, whose enormous popularity stems from the fact he stars in everybody's favorite soap.  The movie blurs fiction and reality, past and present and the outcome is both predictable and horrifying.  Bolivar is betrayed and abandoned a second time.  It is made clear how the left and the right ""construct"" a Bolivar that will suit their political ends, and it is chilling to hear the ""mad"" actor quote passages from Bolivar's writings verbatim. The balkanization of the Bolivarian dream began even as he fought for it. See it together with the excellent ""Manuelita Saez"" for another version of the same betrayal.",1256774400,2,866,4.986111111111111
7997155,5,B0000AGQ6I,Esta es una excelente pelicua que todos los colombianos deberian comprar.  Se las recomiendo a todos.  Tienen que verla para que sepa de lo que se trate.  Robinson Diaz esta excelente en su actuacion como siempre.,1225584000,,213,4.861111111111111
7997156,5,B0000AGQ6I,"You m ust know a little  bit about South American history to understnad this movie on a deep enough level to think it is great. From the on set history is changed in the filming of a telenovela in order to increase popularity. This happens all the time in the telling of history. The other part that I love is th esupport the crazy modern Bolivar character gets from the people because they still want a Gran Colombia. Hugo Chavez and his Bolivariano movement, is trying to achieve this same thing and he has quite a bit of support [not from the USA, of course]. This movie involves history and current events, not to mention how life and people are sometime just plain funny. It is worth the money and time to see.",1180137600,7,715,4.37593984962406
