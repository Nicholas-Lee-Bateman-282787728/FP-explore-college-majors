8265931,4,B0017HEYDY,"I first saw this film over 50 years ago when I was a member of a university film club. I saw it in the original French so the plot(?) was difficult to follow but some images were indelibly imprinted in my brain - the mouth, the rifle shots. After all these years it is still an incredible film - it shows the possibilities of film as a media.  It's possible to really challenge your mind/views/prejudices.  I like a film that is hard work - not froth and bubble.so this is not for everyone. I've lent my copy to a neighbour who likes ""films"" so I'm eagerly awaiting her reaction,",1517270400,,579,4.302752293577981
8265932,4,B0017HEYDY,"I ordered a copy of the DVD because I think it is probably going to be more durable than the copy of the film I have on VHS tape.  I have not watched the DVD all the way through, but what I saw looked good.  I have not seen it yet, but apparently the DVD includes a short film about Cocteau.  In general, I am satisfied with this purchase.",1484524800,,339,3.8840579710144927

8265934,5,B0017HEYDY,"A truly great, surrealistic film by Jean Cocteau: poet; artist; novelist; critic; film director; Honorary President of Cannes Film Festival; etc.

Early in his multifaceted career, Cocteau asked the great novelist and essayist, Andre Gide, to judge the quality of his work. When Gide replied that he was not impressed, Cocteau asked for pointers on what he needed to do to improve. Gide replied, ""Astonish me!"", and Cocteau followed this advice by astonishing everyone in all of his subsequent works.

Cocteau's first film, ""Le Sang d'un Poete"" is certainly astonishing. The action is supposed to take place in an instant, represented by the time it takes for a large smokestack to crumble to the ground. The first part of the film relates to the struggle of the poet for enlightened inspiration. The second part deals with the acquisition of a muse (his anima) and his spiritual journey through a form-shifting world to which he alone can impart meaning. In the third section, the poet enters the purgatory of literary icons through his suicide. In the fourth section, his work is corrupted and debased by persons adding their own, lesser interpretations, for their own purposes. And finally, after a second death by misinterpretation, the poet achieves Immortality of the Ages, as Time resurrects the underlying, enduring value of his artistic contributions.

Of note, Lee Miller, famous photographer and girlfriend of Man Ray, is the lovely statue/muse of the film.

If you are a fan of surrealistic art, you will find this 1930 film to be a cinematic treasure.",1249603200,15,1564,5.073929961089494
8265935,5,B0017HEYDY,"i may dislike cocteau's literature, but i'm a fanatic when it comes to his work in film.  ""blood of a poet"" is such a gem that it almost makes up for the instinctual dislike and boredom i feel when reading his poetry and essays.  from start to finish this masterpiece will fascinate and hypnotize the lover of surrealist art, and also lovers of film  as a whole. the image i most love from this movie is the armless greek statue with a superimposed mouth on it's face.  it is, of course, useless to try to interpret intellectually and it doesn't have a 'meaning' rationally, (at least to the viewer), but don't dismiss it as nonsense for this reason.  revilers of surrealism don't seem to understand that art is the beauty of the irrational, NOT, as the classicists believe, an expression of excellence or perfection through order.  the appeal of this movie lies in it's appeal to the dionysian, primal side of our aesthetic organ.  sheer genius on the part of cocteau the like of which we may never be fortunate enough to see again in this age of multi million dollar special effects-corporate (...) festivals.",1004832000,7,1111,4.666666666666667
