1848001,5,B00008HCBM,"Katey Sagal should have won an Emmy for this role! No lie, I wept and wept! She was nothing short of phenominal! Forget that Married With Children mess, she is a masterpiece as a dramatic actress! And as a singer she is equally as gifted. Get her CD entitled, ""Well ..."" You will be pleasantly surprised!!",1158364800,2,305,4.464285714285714
1848002,5,B00008HCBM,"This movie would be depressing to some, but I found it interesting, believable and captivating.  Katey Sagal couldn't have played the part any better.

I was there, and I felt her anguish, her suffering and her courage all the way through.  The acting was superb, and the story line was heartwarming and covered many facets of love.

I recommend it!",1140998400,7,349,4.766666666666667

1848009,5,B00008HCBM,"What a wonderful look at a woman fighting for her life, her babies life and her husband's. Katey Sagal is great as
a woman who gives birth , forms a close friendship with a nurse in the hospital and when faced with a deadly illness
makes plans for her daughter's and husband's future happiness when she is gone. Well acted and a real tear jerker
with a happy ending.",1391558400,,366,4.318840579710145

1848027,5,B00008HCBM,"I had taped this movie, which was called God's New Plan, from a t.v. showing many years ago. Always went back and pulled that old VHS tape and looked at it because of the real pleasure it gave me. Decided to look on Amazon and there it was with a different name but obviously the same movie. Though Katie Sagal did a wonderful job in it I couldn't quite believe how he was supposed to have fallen so in love with her at first meeting as she isn't really a pretty woman. But, through her performance she was able to convince me that it had happened the way she said. Come to think of it, he is no Adonis is he. It's a wonderful story of the triumph of love over death. No horrible mean characters, no bratty, talk back kids, no ulterior motives.  It's the type of movie you can look at over and over again and always enjoy it. I thought this was an unusually good use of actors known only from t.v. shows. All of them did an excellent job. I've never understood why Annabeth Gish has not had a bigger career as an actress.  She is lovely to look at and a very good actress.  Remember, she was one of the girls in Mystic Pizza.",1327708800,2,1125,4.127853881278539
1848028,5,B00008HCBM,"This was a wonderful true story.  I thought the actors and actress' was terrific in this sad but heart loving film. It takes God, faith, and a lot of love to have a dying spouse to ask what she did of her spouse and friend to do after she dies. I would ask everyone to watch this movie. Watch this movie with your family, friends and church members.",1327449600,,349,4.132352941176471
1848029,5,B00008HCBM,"Katey Sagal should most have been given a""Best Actress ""  she played the part as woman, loving and the kind of mother all children should have!!!!!!  I wept and wept for hours after the movie was over.  I started to tell my husband about the movie and started to weep more.  Anyway all the actors should get an award for their parts in this movie also. I know me and I never could have been a part of this movie, because I would have spent the whole time crying, that's why I could never be a nurse. Mothers and Fathers everywhere should see this most loving and inspirational movie.....  Sunny  This movie was bought at Amazon.com.",1325808000,,632,4.405172413793103
1848030,3,B00008HCBM,"This was quite a tear jerker that's for sure.  Although I was a bit skeptical in the beginning with very poor acting and dialogue, it did pick up and get better along the way.

The acting was just not there in my opinion.  Katey Segal is usually spot on with her characters, but it took a while for her to embrace this one and flow into it.  Her emotions were quite bland in the beginning when she is reminiscing about her childhood, and then when she finds out she is going to have a pre-term baby there was no emotion at all. She lays quietly on the gurney and stares at the ceiling. Doesn't cry at all. Having been in the position of a pre-term baby I could not understand why her character wasn't devastated or shocked at the thought.  I couldn't understand why her character didn't get emotional at two major life changing instances. 1)She has Cancer~AGAIN, 2)She is going to have to deliver her baby at 23 weeks.  Knowing either one of these were going to happen to me I would be a bit more emotional.

Katey Segal behaves as if she has never had a baby in her life.  There was no convincing dialogue when it came to her pregnancy, or the reality that she was going to have a baby so early it may not even survive. At one point she casually tells her husband to get up she's bleeding. And when she goes to the bathroom it was monotone ""oh no. I'm bleeding."" Just matter of fact, no urgency, no emotion. She was not in touch with the pregnant part of her character at all.

However, when her character is in pain from the cancer, walking with a walker, then weak and confined to bed, she really takes off and gets it.  It is at this moment when you need to reach for the tissue box.  When she is coming to terms with the reality of never seeing her family, husband, baby, etc. again, she is most convincing and it really hits home and pulls at your heart.

The movie basically rolls along slowly as you follow this woman through her daily routine of having a premature baby.  Taking care of this baby in the hospital for months. Her cancer diagnosis. Her plan of attack on the cancer. Her acceptance of death and planning for it.

She is not forced into giving her husband to her nurse, the nurse and her family just happened to have formed a close bond while caring for her premature baby for so long in the hospital in which the nurse works.  So they truly see the nurse everyday and build a relationship together with her.  It is when she is diagnosed with cancer and told to prepare for her death that she starts thinking of the possible future her husband could have with the caring and nurturing nurse. She sees that the nurse cares for her daughter as much as she does, and could easily replace her as a mother. Her main concern is giving a mother to her daughter.  Finding a woman who can give her husband what he needs as well is a bonus to the situation.

At times the film is awkwardly written and it lags quite a bit.  The story isn't really that great, it is just a touching and sensitive subject that stirs your emotions.  It is a depressing movie that can bring you down, and I cannot imagine watching it very often for pleasure since it is so emotionally draining. It does say it is based on a true story, but they don't give you any history or follow up at the end that would connect you to the story better.  I like knowing more about the family the movie is based on when they say it is based on a true story.  I like the connection and the association between the real person and the character the actor is portraying.  It would be a nice addition to the dvd extras area.

Brian Young who portrays the husband has his moments of good acting, but then a majority of the time he is just not with it convincingly enough. The same goes for Annabeth Gish.  She is good at times, but the three actors together do not have a cohesive bond or the convincing comradery that you would like to see and feel.  It just always felt like something was missing.

Overall it isn't a movie for kids since they would be extremely bored and possibly confused over the cancer and death topic of the story. It is older and a bit dated.
 I think if it was on TV it would be a good one to grab for the night.",1308009600,4,4209,4.2406015037593985

7984488,1,B00008HCBM,"The original title of this ""made for TV"" movie was ""God's New Plan."" It was changed to ""No Higher Love"" after it hit cable TV's ""chick-channels"" and has periodic showings under the new title. The producers, writers and director pulled out all the stops to make it as weepy as possible in their attempt to ensure viewers will consume an entire tissue box before the first commercial break, and an entire case before the end. I'm wondering how much kickback they received from Kimberly-Clark.

There's little doubt the story is based upon the life -- and death -- of a young Baltimore mother who is diagnosed with cancer for the third time shortly after giving birth to a girl, and eventually succumbs to it. While the real story is both compelling and tragic, the operative words are ""based upon"" as this fictionalized TV dramatization is overwhelmingly targeted to the ""chick-flick"" demographic. More of the story could have been -- and should have been -- spent on her husband, father and close family friends -- without the heavily cliched dialog. A potentially dramatic story is smothered by the screenplay and scripting which fails to portray an appropriate level of emotional anguish and grief, and a more accurate picture of the toll terminal cancer takes on everyone: patient, family, friends and caregivers.

There are much better and more realistic films about cancer, cancer survivorship, and the impact it has on everyone affected by it than a real story that has been morphed into an unrealistic, excessively lachrymose melodrama by its screenwriters, producers and director. Ingmar Bergman's classic ""Cries and Whispers"" and the more recent ""The Fault in Our Stars"" are infinitely better, to cite just two examples.",1437696000,,1728,5.059649122807017
