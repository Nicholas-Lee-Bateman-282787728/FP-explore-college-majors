7797804,5,1572524529,"Audio Galaxy has done it again, this collection of shorts is the bee's knees. These are the cartoons I remember growing up with, collected here, with beautifully restored picture and sound. The added history of each cartoon was very enlightening, and provided some great insight. I have some very young cousins and this is a collection I will gladly recommend to them, they will absolutely love this DVD and will be rolling on the floor laughing at the antics of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and more. You go get 'em Audio Galaxy, another great set.",1413244800,,543,4.726315789473684
7797805,3,1572524529,My son loves these old cartoons!  Some of them I don't really like and find some material objecitonable. Like the use of guns and all the love stuff from Pepe Le pew.  I skip those cartoons.,1366761600,,190,4.25
7797806,2,1572524529,"Before buying this DVD, I already owned the vast majority of these cartoons on various VHS tapes. The reason I purchased it anyway was to get superior copies of the toons listed. Boy what a disappointment! The sound  has been totally screwed up! In an attempt to enhance the the sound, Fox  Lorber added sound effects that don't fit very well with the cartoons. (In  other words the sounds they added are louder than the rest of the sound  track and more clear... making them a serious distraction) The most  obnoxious addition is on ""Daffy Duck and the Dinosaur"".At the  end, when the Caveman goes to stab the giant inflatable duck, the morons  who worked on the restoration added sounds from the ""Psyco""  shower scene. What a waste of money. I'll be watching my old VHS tapes  instead. Fours stars (for providing a copy of great cartoon shorts) minus  two stars (for terrible sound) equals two stars.",958694400,17,902,4.687898089171974
