2615307,5,B000GNOH8W,"As my title suggests, this film is an instant classic, albeit, of the grindhouse/exploitation genre. The director Duke Hendrix has a keen eye for 70's foreign film sensibilities, with many of his shots portraying a perfect blend of atmosphere and parody. The narrative is as old as the ages, like Homer (or Ulysses depending on your historical preference) Count Bloodspit just wants to go home. Aided by his menagerie of kooky emo sluts, a scottish vampire with a foul mouth and temper, a wolfman who can't stop grooming his genitals and some weird geeky transvestite, he sets out on his way, but little does he know his arch nemesis Dr Ludvig and his assistant Mr Handsome, are hot on his trail.
Hendrix is a master craftsmen who uses his palette well, he seamlessly blends gore, sex, violence, atmosphere and humor to paint a picture worthy of remembering. Let's hope that Hollywood picks this guy up and lets him loose on one of the horror franchises or even better a Batman movie.",1216080000,,984,4.760233918128655
2615308,4,B000GNOH8W,"Thank god for Troma. The titans of all things tasteless, tacky, and terrific are back with a film more than worthy of addition to their illustrious canon. Bloodspit is a fang fest of twisted depravity, a cacophony of decadent ear candy and a visual banquet of perversion. The story follows the crazed Dr Ludvic as he tries to steal the crest from Count Blaughspich's (aka Bloodspit's) coffin. Meanwhile the horny old count occupies his time by indulging in anomalous sex play with the female members of his castle in between bouts of an illness that gives him the death rattles, and constant pining for his homeland known as the ""mirror world."" Director, Duke Hendrix mashes a blend of John Waters, Andy Warhol's ""Flesh for Frankenstein"" and the ""Munsters"" into a toilet bowl of postmodern and old school mayhem. Hendrix and co writer Leon Fish, hang outrageous gags on a thin storyline that both tickle and fracture the funny bone. The beauty of such no budget films is that what they lack in money, they more than make up for in characterization and imagination. Bloodspit is a twisted, crazy vampire epic that not only follows the Ed Wood ethos, it embraces it. Viva la Troma!",1212883200,,1179,4.784313725490196

8133511,1,B000GNOH8W,"This movie was badly made, acted, with a rather moronic story line. To sum it up in a word, ""PATHETIC"".",1463616000,,103,4.2

8133513,5,B000GNOH8W,"Pretty brilliant, this movie was fun as heck.  First of all you will want to know that the film is crude with a capital CRUDE.  Sometimes X-rated humor (although semen has made it's inroads into R-rated movies so maybe not X), the humor is also delightfully immature as in a farting scene (which frankly if you don't understand the absurdist humor of this scene you won't understand any of the movie).  However, if the immaturity of today's youth turns you off as it turns me off, don't worry as the whole film achieves a timeless vulgarity.  I think it would have been at home on the vaudeville stage of Mozart's time (at least according to Amadeus). Now technical stuff.  Acting was spot on and a joy to watch. These are real performers, not some nobody's relatives. I even developed a fondness for many of the characters!  It has a very low budget, but a level of professionalism was attained in every shot.  It is shot like an old Dracula movie, practically back in Nosferatu times, with characters you would recognize from the same. Because the budget is ultra low and this is supposed to take place in a gothic-y mansion, extreme close-ups were successfully utilized to minimize suspension of disbelief. The film comes together remarkably well all things considered, and I loved every freaking minute of it!",1456531200,,1313,4.757709251101321
