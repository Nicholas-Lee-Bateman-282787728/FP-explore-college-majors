7865923,4,6304215673,I just found the VHS when looking to replace an old copy we had made from the original TV program.  It is well done and reflects the way production values and technology have progressed to today's standards.  That being said it is a good copy and I appreciated getting because mine was the backup choir that was used in the production.,1423267200,,335,4.475409836065574

Vince is at his best, along with Amy Grant, Chet Atkins,  the Tulsa Philharmonic, the Oral Roberts University Chapel Choir and others.  Seeing it along with hearing the music adds to the enjoyment of these treasured traditional Christmas songs.",1135382400,,369,4.903225806451613
