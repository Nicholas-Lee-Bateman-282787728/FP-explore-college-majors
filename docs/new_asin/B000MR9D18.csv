The murders seem to drag this one down, I don't know how, but they do. Cute girls. There seems to be a whiny notion that every horror movie needs nudity, but as someone who has seen horror movies as far back as the 1910's I can tell you that story trumps nudity; sure. nudity is always welcome but I want a story, too; this movie has a story, a bit dirivative, yeah, and a little tedios to getting to its point, certainly, but it had a plot that hasn't been used to death. Fine B-Horror, just a bit monotonous.",1349481600,,630,4.214876033057851
8171147,1,B000MR9D18,"The film is not very good horror. The blood is overly red, they clearly added too much dye to the clear Karo syrup. I was surprised to discover these actors have appeared in other movies. The dialouge was extremely bad which made any attempt to ""act"" only comical, which the movie was at times.

Before the credits we get a glimpse of 1791 France where witches are being killed and they curse the priest and all of his generations. We switch to modern times where we have a girl being raised by her father a priest. The iron mask ties into the story, but not too well. It is enough that they use it. Teens go to a house to party only to be trapped inside with the killer. The girls were very pretty, sometimes in bikinis, sometimes in bra/panties, but never nude. There is no character development, the soundtrack is bad, and the special effects is comical.

No f-bombs, no sex, no nudity. Girls getting spanked.",1314748800,,912,4.455089820359281
