3936583,3,B002IH81YK,"Once in a while you actually find a no budget cheap film that actually has entertaining properties in it. Some people actually know how to make a so bad it's good film, instead of just a bored to tears bad movie. I think part of it lies in not taking yourself seriously, making sure that there is something going on at all times, and not trying to make a film bigger than what you have the budget for. Thankfully, ""I Spit Chew On Your Grave"" follows all of these guidelines, and comes across as a pretty hilarious throwback to 70's exploitation cinema with lots of dirty laughs thrown in for good measure.

Our ""Hero"" wins 100,000 dollars in the lottery, and goes with his friend to celebrate at the bar. Unknown to them, the bar is home to a gang called ""The Gash Nasties"", who are led by a warlock (looking like David Bowie from Labyrinth). The 3 girls in the gang, Honey Lips, Love Juice & Balls Deep are into raping guys and stealing their money. They're more than happy to do this to our hero & steal his winning lotto ticket. After they've left him for dead, a demon comes and ""Rescues"" him. Once in the demons lair, he is healed and given training to fight the evil Gash Gang to try and get his winning ticket back. Will he be successful, Or will the Nasty Gashes give him the raping of his life? Watch to find out.

Now, with a running time of only 58 minutes, there isn't really any time for a back story, or much set up at all. But that all right. With one liners flying such as one of the Gash Nasties stating that one of her deceased clients is ""Deader than Corey Haims' career"", you know you've got a winner on your hands. And pay attention too, because that witty dialog never lets up, and you'll want to catch it all. The movie is full of sight gags as well. You'll be very surprised at how much stuff they cram into the hour they have to work with. Fake hair, mustaches and accents abound. This is also a throwback to '70's cinema, so you get an aged looking film print, some great faux '70's music (one sounding like Led Zeppelin), and out of left field characters that try to fit in every exploitation film ever. The acting is purposefully bad, and humorous. This is a great movie for the dirty minded, and those who have a soft spot for cheap wackiness.

The film is shot in full frame, on video. The picture is just fair, but that is done on purpose to try and copy the grind house, exploitation look of '70's film and does a pretty good job. The extras are a commentary track, and some film trailers, including some of this directors' other films. Give this one a try with the gang on Saturday night. You might be pleasantly surprised.",1382400000,,2656,4.308
3936584,1,B002IH81YK,"It was void of anything positive. Bad plot, bad flow. I think a good cheesy horror movie should still have elements of horror. This was completely mocking not only the genre, but its own effort. Too lighthearted and even approached as a comedy, not funny.",1376352000,4,255,4.688888888888889
3936585,1,B002IH81YK,"I tried to force myself to watch this 'movie', but only made it to 17 minutes. All it is is a group of horrible actors with extremely foul mouths talk about depraved sex acts. (I have nothing against depraved sex acts and foul mouths, but at least give us some action.) The closest it came to sexy was a bunch of big busted girls shaking their breasts at the camera and each other - while clothed.
How does something this bad even get released??? I see it's available on DVD! Buy it now!
Amazon, I had better hopes for you!
Terrible acting and not a sign of story line or plot!",1375660800,11,577,4.207207207207207
3936586,4,B002IH81YK,"FOUR STARS - But not for everyone. Only those who can tolerate extreme stupidity & silliness. There are several actors that work together making very silly low budget films for our viewing pleasure. In fact, the production company for some of their films is called ""Low Budget Films."" This core of actors appears to be led by non-other than the comically gifted Josh Suire A.K.A. Leo DeChamp(a) A.K.A. Caspian. The group led by the versatile Suire have made several films together. All (that I have seen) have ridiculous & vulgar humor. This film, like some of their other films, is definitely not for everyone. The sheer vulgarity alone would be too offensive. If you like this kind of stuff I can assure you there are some chuckles if not out right laughs headed your way. By no means is this film supposed to be serious at any point. I have found the lack of seriousness to be the trait or common thread within all of their films. Again, I have not seen all their films, but I would like to recommend the outrageously crazy ""The Evil Dead Inbred Rednecks"" 2012. In my opinion it is the best one yet. After reading the aforementioned words I have written & you feel comfortable about what I said (regarding their films) then you should check this film out (as well as others). One last note...Josh Suire is evidently starting to catch people's attention. He has recently starred in a ""Troma"" production... ""Mutantz, Nazis and Zombies.""",1375315200,,1437,4.7063492063492065
3936587,1,B002IH81YK,"""I Spit Chew On Your Grave"" is another intolerable ""movie"" from Director Chris ""Terror At Blood Fart Lake"" Seaver and Executive Producer Ron Bonk. It's obviously an exploitation flick, but before you rent or buy this 58-minute long short on depravity, know this: it contains really nothing but disgustingly rude dialogue. There is absolutely nothing to make the film visually interesting, despite the attempt to make it look like an older exploitation flick.

I have always firmly believed ""The Underground Comedy Movie"" to be the worst movie ever made, but now I'm not so sure. ""I Spit Chew On Your Grave"" has a completely unsavory plot that I will entirely avoid discussing, the central theme of which is so un-funny that even this group of veterans of no-taste cinema didn't want their names on it. I will say that the story revolves around a disreputable warlock, Gareth, the ""Mythical Prince From the Third Realm"" (credited as both ""Daz Maddison"" and ""Daz Madison"") and his three vixens with names like Honey Lips (""Gwendalyn Booviay;"" the film also ostensibly stars ""Taco Stephens,"" ""Mandy Bovine,"" and ""Jock De Queaf"" as himself.)

Those of you who have seen other films from the same troupe of regulars will recognize the star to be none other than mustachioed Josh Suire as Leo DeChamp (as Leo DeChamp, to add to the annoyance) once again spouting what passes for dialogue (enjoy the connections between Toblerone and Canada. Or don't. Your choice. I didn't.) As the non-plot progresses revel in the horrible spectacle of dancing, a painful standup comedy routine about dry cleaning, assault with a garden weasel, and the worst faux-Chinese accents since ""The Wild, Wild World of Batwoman."" Leo and Gareth (who has among other powers, and ability to use a split-screen effect and who controls a sock puppet chorus) battle for supremacy, though if you can understand what's supposed to be happening you know (or care) more than I do. Eventually Leo gets advice on revenge from a devilish Grizzelda (""Madam Croakus"") in an attempt to parody vengeance flicks, and the film concludes with the worst battle for good versus evil (or something versus something else) in the history of cinematic choreography. (I know it's supposed to be a spoof, but it's just not funny. Or scary. Or exciting. Or interesting.)

This film combines an impossibly un-funny premise, awful dialogue, acting, and direction and blends them together into an absolutely dreadful viewing experience. The DVD also features an astonishingly juvenile and self-congratulatory commentary track if you can bear to sit through the film a second time. (I dare you.)

I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy. It's dumb, rude, and offensive, and has nothing to show for it at the end of its tortuous 58-minute run.",1308700800,3,2791,5.021598272138229
