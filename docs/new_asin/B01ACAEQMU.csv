7597397,5,B01ACAEQMU,I have no idea with the people who gave this movie one or two stars are talking about I don't even know if they actually saw it. It was an original idea no nudity hardly any blood in it I thought it was a good scary movie worth the time.,1457740800,6,237,3.76
7597398,4,B01ACAEQMU,"The biggest issue people tend to have is that they are expecting a horror movie. The Forest is more of a psychological thriller with a mere dash of horror elements.

7597399,2,B01ACAEQMU,"I honestly think horror movies may be dead. I've always been such a fan, but for the last several years, it's been one load of rubish after another. Same stories you've seen, same people doing the exact opposite of everything they should, and unsympathetic characters being completely responsible for the bad things that happen in the first place. This latest addition to the mounting rubish pile is about a modernized woman who goes to a place she shouldn't, and does the things she's not supposed to in an effort to save her twin who knew better in the first place. Cheap scares, a few jumps, and an ending you have seen so many times it should be gospel, for poor script writers by now. Say the money, rewatch Evil Dead if you need a haunted forest. Chances are you will have more fun and at least you will know that the feeling of dejavu is from having already having watched it, and not from seeing something new that feels like everything else that has ever been done wrong.",1457136000,12,980,4.51123595505618

7597402,1,B01ACAEQMU,"Nine Things About the Movie ""The Forest""

1. There is a forest in Japan, named Aokigahara, which is a popular place for people to go in order to commit suicide. It is a real place. And now it's the basis for what is already one of the worst films of 2016. The movie makes absolutely no sense.

2. This is an incredibly amateur paint-by-number horror movie. This is what the filmmakers must have said:
""Let's make a horror movie about that one forest in Japan. But we need to make sure there's a dark hallway with some flickering lights. And we need a cute little girl to suddenly turn into a demon. Actually, let's do that a few times. And, um, we need the main character to fall down. A lot. And at the very end, right before the credits, let's have a scary person rush toward the camera. OK, are we good? Let's go make this movie!""

3. It's about a lady named Sara (played by Natalie Dormer), who has a twin sister named Jess. Jess lives in Japan. Sara gets a call from Japanese police saying Jess was spotted going into Aokigahara forest. But the police won't go look for her because she went into the forest, so she's probably dead and they will leave the body there.

Sara uses her twin-sister powers to figure out that Jess isn't really dead. So she flies to Japan to look for her. She first goes to a visitor center at the forest that recovers the dead bodies of people who committed suicide there. But they don't give the bodies to the police, they just keep them in the basement and watch them, so they don't start screaming or something.

4. She also meets Aiden, an Australian with an American accent. He tells her he can't be in the forest alone with her, because he would get lost. Then he stays in the forest alone with her.

5. Sara seems to make every decision by picking the option that makes the least sense. She also must have an infinite battery in her phone so that she can use it forever as a flashlight in all the dark places she goes.

6. A lot of the movie is just people walking around in the forest. Since the movie itself is completely not-scary, we get to see Sara's dreams, which are supposed to be weird and scary. But they are just regular horror movie dreams.

7. It was directed by Jason Zada, who works on websites and Facebook apps.

This is his first movie. Let's hope it's his last.

He actually turned down scholarships to film school because he wanted to learn things on his own. Bad idea, Jason.

8. Considering the fact that the ""suicide forest"" is real, the movie is kind of exploitative and insensitive.

9. This is a boring, lazy, stupid, predictable movie with bad acting and cheap jump scares. Do yourself a favor. Instead of watching this movie, go to the nearest forest and walk around for 95 minutes. You'll have more fun.",1453593600,141,2772,4.371595330739299
7597403,5,B01ACAEQMU,I've seen it in theaters four times now. I think it it a great movie to pass time quickly. Would recommend.,1453593600,7,107,4.142857142857143
7597404,3,B01ACAEQMU,"A few years ago, I was on YouTube and saw an episode of Vice called Suicide Forest.  It is about Aokigahara Forest which is located at the base of Mt. Fuji.  Each year about 50-100 people commit suicide there.  If you walk around the forest long enough, you just might run into a corpse.

The Forest is about a sister whose twin goes to the forest and does not come back out.  The sister then travels to Japan to go find her.  Is she okay or did something happen to her?  That is basically the story.  The movie is less than an hour and a half, so it goes by fast.

If you take out the twin sisters' story from this movie, it is basically the Vice Youtube clip on the same topic.

1.  There is a Japanese guy leading the foreigners around the forest.
2.  Guide sees someone making a campsite at the forest and walks up to him to make sure he is okay.
3.  Dead body is found and examined.

The only difference is the movie talks about something supernatural causing people to commit suicide.  Overall, the movie is okay, if you want to watch something spooky with your friends late at night.  It's a decent time pass.  I did not find it scary as much as I found it to be suspenseful.",1453507200,8,1182,4.15929203539823

7597408,1,B01ACAEQMU,If you are interested in Aokigahara the haunted forest in Japan this is not the movie for you. This is just a poorly done horror movie. I recommend the sea of trees it gives you a much better idea of what the forest is and has a great cast.,1520294400,,240,3.9183673469387754

7597415,4,B01ACAEQMU,"Hmmmm, where to begin.
The review of the Amazon experience is 5 star. Easy to order, shipped quickly and prices are good.
Review of the movie is 3 stars. It isn't bad. It isn't great either. This is more of a suspense and psychological thriller than a slasher movie (which is a good thing). To watch the character's mind spiral out of control is amazing to watch. If given the right script Natalie Dormer could be a major A list actress. Taylor Kinney is great as always. He too could be a major big screen force if given a decent script. They both did a respectable job with what was presented to them. There are a few editing mistakes but they don't detract from the story. This movie could have been so much more but it was still an enjoyable watch.",1510704000,,752,4.340425531914893

Other than that the movie was very good, lots of tension and plenty of scenes to make you jump.  If you are looking for a blood and guts movie move on this is not for you, but if you are looking for a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat and have you holding your breath from time to time then you will not be disappointed.",1509321600,,599,3.9338842975206614

Her acting was great, and she's beautiful.
And Japan is awesome.

That's about where the good stuff stops.
Thankfully, it's not a slasher or torture flick.
But it consists primarily of a collection of ""jump"" scare tactics, and it's very anti-climactic.
It really adds nothing to the genre.",1497139200,2,401,4.897058823529412
7597424,3,B01ACAEQMU,"Somewhat decent horror/thriller movie.  Scenery lovely, folklore-based Japanese setting refreshing.  Sadly, it was cheapened with unimaginative jump-scares.  What could have been a deliciously atmospheric spooky film ended up being a somewhat scary movie with a so-so plot brought downward by brainless/predictable ""scares"" and a lazy, fairly juvenile ending.  It wouldn't have bothered me so much had I known it was going to be that type of movie, but it's passed off as something a little bit more ""grown up"" and creative, so I was surprised at the parts that just seemed like the writers ran out of fresh content, and settled for the obligatory normal-to-suddenly-scary faces and hands grabbing out of the darkness.  Ultimately disappointing, but not bad for one quick watch if your expectations are low.",1496275200,,807,5.322834645669292
7597425,3,B01ACAEQMU,"Better than the 10% given by Rotten Tomatoes.  Natalie gave an overall decent performance but her character swung too wildly between calmness and hysteria.  The Aiden character was never clearly explained and the lighting was too dark all the time.  The ending, while a surprise, was too muddled to make much sense.  It is more of a psychological thriller than a horror story.  Overall it is a fun Saturday evening film but don't expect much more than that.",1495238400,,457,4.8076923076923075
7597426,2,B01ACAEQMU,"The only reason this gets 2 stars is because Natalie Dormer is so beautiful that being able to look at her for 90 minutes is of at least some value. Sadly, she is the only bright spot in this otherwise dull and poorly written script. There's nothing that annoys me more in scary movies than a female character that is always falling down and this movie is one of those movies. I lost count of how many times Dormer's character fell down in this movie. I've known lots of women in my life and literally zero of them are unable to run or walk without falling down all the time. I don't get why directors always feel the need to portray women characters in scary movies as feeble, clumsy, and unable to escape danger without hurting themselves or without help.

Beyond that, the movie is predicatable and relies on the cheapest and oldest scary movie tricks like jump scares, sudden loud noises, creepy sounds, and ghostly faces. Cherry on top, the ending sucks.",1489708800,6,959,4.543352601156069

7597431,2,B01ACAEQMU,Yes this place is real and Natalie Dormer annoys me. This movie was all about the jump scare. 5 minute scenes of someone walking down the hall of a hotel with no reason for the scene except a jump scare of at cat popping out with a loud noise then character returns to their room scene over.,1486771200,,291,4.12280701754386

7597450,1,B01ACAEQMU,"This movie had no idea what it wanted to be. Takes place in Japan with random American's peppered in including a guy who works for an Australian magazine who is a potential serial killer who lures unsuspecting dimwits into the suicide forest.
Dormer plays twin sisters who share some sort of psychic connection, and even though they're twin sisters who love each other with all their hearts they're never in the same shot together. The editing is so comical I couldn't help but laugh, and as for the acting I wanted both sisters to die a horrible death in the spooky suicide forest.
The forest isn't even a character it's just a set. The Japanese people are just props; why didn't they just film this in some American forest since the only main characters are American?? (even the guy who works for the Australian magazine) And to those reviewers who say there were no jump scares, this entire film had nothing but jump scares, and it's a good thing too because otherwise it is not scary.
Dormer annoys instead of grows as a character and from the beginning she lies to the guy about how her parents died, but later is upset when he lies about something so now all the sudden he's this giant unforgivable liar even though her lie was much more dark and upsetting.

Anyway, I had to try to watch this three times before I could sit through it once and when I did boy was I upset because my time would have been better used elsewhere.",1483488000,,1432,4.486590038314176

7597471,1,B01ACAEQMU,"Watched this last night on Uverse; glad I didn't pay to rent it.

<<The Forest>> is set in the Sea of Trees, legitimately one of the most disturbing places on earth, in Japan, one of the world's greatest sources of seriously-chilling supernatural folklore traditions.

As such, one might expect an atmospheric thriller that takes advantage of its setting to slowly drive its characters and viewers right out of their minds.

Instead, one gets a bunch of talk, predictable Quasi-Smarmy Guy In Foreign Land tropes, and a few cheap, unconvincing jump-scares. (And a hilarious scene in which Girl At The Visitors' Center/Morgue explains Central Casting Scary Granny's antics with a totes-legit, ""She's elderly."" Like, we can see that much, GATVC/M, but that doesn't explain why she be actin' cray.)

Um ... yawn.

Seriously, I'm not sure that the creators of this flop could have sucked any more suspense out of a potentially-promising story and setting if they had tried.

This movie aims for Blair Witch-style woodsy-spookiness and misses. Seriously, <<The Blair Which Project>> was a letdown in many ways, but its creators masterfully used setting to build tension and eschewed lame jump-scares.

It tries to call upon Japan's folkloric lineage and fails. How can you possibly get yurei wrong, guys?  I mean, seriously.

It attempts some American-style jump-scares and completely tanks. I just can't even, with this part.

Solid efforts on the part of the cast don't manage to yank even mediocrity from the jaws of pure, unadulterated lameness.

The result: a disjointed (and not in a ""creepy girl from <<Ringu>>"" sense), meandering bunch of forest scenery populated by some people who are trying their best to be in a scary story.

TL;DR: Meh/10. Skip this one unless you need a good nap. Rent <<Ringu>> or <<The Grudge>> or either American remake instead. Heck, if you never want to sleep again, rent all four and write a paper comparing them through a sociological lens, because watching all four of those movies that closely is asking for trouble. Ask Me How I Know.

:::SPOILER BITS COMING:::
Note to American horror film makers: jump-scares can be great when you use them effectively, but for Pete's sake, learn how to use them (hint: rent <<Ringu>> and its American remake...) and stop trying to make them carry *all* the weight of suspense and horror in your movies. Please. Setting, dialogue, and story-building are so much more important. They're also arguably cheaper than fx makeup, and they don't give your actors hives. Mostly.

Also, Hoshiko was way scarier in Almost Normal Schoolgirl mode than in Greyish Dead Girl mode, which just basically made me giggle. Seriously, I LOLed, guys. In fact, the harder you try to make her creepy, the less creepy she gets  she just leaps right over the Uncanny Valley straight into the Land of Laughable Zombies.

There's exactly one really creepy moment in this movie, and that's when the camera lingers on Aiden's blank, open-eyed face as he lies awake by the Hilarious Fire of Ever-Burning Twigs. For like five seconds there, the viewer is like, ""Dude, this could get weird!""

... Aaaaaaand then the movies like, ""LULZ, FULED U"" and goes merrily tromping along its predictable way. It does not get lost in the Forest, not even for a minute.

Most of the rest of the movie is spent going, ""OMG, how dumb ARE these people?!""  Gaijin no baka, indeed.

On the upside, slept like a baby after watching this, so there's that.",1478476800,2,3473,4.944922547332186

One minute she's saying repeated ""it's in my head"" but then she believes she is seeing a child's toy in the dirt?

What I did find interesting was the ambiguity of it all. There was nothing concrete nor tangible about the characters. So we never know if the forest drove Dormer to do certain things or if she was acting with a sane mind.

At the end of the day to cast such negative reviews without truly understanding Dormer's character and decisions, is to assume that if in the same situation we would make the ""correct"" decision. However, in the forest what exactly are those ""correct"" decisions?",1465603200,5,789,4.669064748201439

In fact half of the scene clips they show in the trailer literally aren't. There was so much they could have done and didn't. Why wasn't there more weird, creepy, eerie stuff happening to the protagonist while in the forest? Instead of that we get some minimal forest scenes and then a bunch of flashbacks of stuff that happened outside of the forest. I understand it's probably intended to establish a back story, but it feels like a cop out in this, because honestly the movie feels unfinished; like they could have used an extra hour to add in those forest scenes. I think in trying to keep with the currently popular short horror movie length they did this story a disservice. I kept waiting for something to happen, and nothing really did. Add in to that the absolutely terrible ending (I'm looking at you ""The Skeleton Key"") and it's just not worth watching.

The location, a forest in Japan of exceeding dread, is a site of suicide for Japanese and Foreigners alike and her twin sister has gone missing in it. The sense of foreignness here is palpable and everything is understated. People, events and occurrences are rarely what they seem. It is as much psychological suspense as it is horror or mystical.
The above sense of place is as much the  plot as the location. It is spare and unrelenting. The movie, like most indies has a pace that is more enveloping and slower but in the end very rewarding.",1464393600,3,695,4.650406504065041

 I loved the plot that they go into the suicide forest and they really do stick to the folklore, that was a huge plus to me. I think it just got lost somewhere in the middle and while it moved quickly, there wasn't much to see. It did have a nice dark, ominous tone through out so it was more of a atmosphere type of movie.

7597745,5,B01ACAEQMU,"I thought this movie was good. I had seen a documentary on haunted places around the globe and this location was featured. The storyline on the forest is accurate. People do go in to kill themselves, they leave the ribbons so others can find their bodies and they do find empty tents with no one around.
Knowing those facts, it does make the setting edgy...
I read reviews of all kinds and decided to watch it. I'm a Natalie Dormer fan from ""The Tudors"" and wanted to see her in something other than historical fiction. I thought she did well.
For those who found it boring, hated it or didn't make it to the end.... I guess it just depends on your mood. Would you accept help from a total stranger if you were desperate to find someone you love?

7597779,5,B01ACAEQMU,"It's really unfortunate that a brilliantly creepy and effective horror film like this is getting slammed by ignorant viewers who judge movies based on gore factor or cheesy dialog. The Forest immediately became a must have movie when I saw it in the theater. It's got a very eerie sense of doom and confusion as to what's real and what's imagined, and you never really know. I admit that the lead character is a bit annoying or over the top at times, but it doesn't ruin the overall chilling feel of the film, with it's foggy settings and ghost imagery.

The premise, as I'm sure you know, is a sister looking for her missing twin after she disappeared into an allegedly haunted Japanese forest know for being a place where people go to commit suicide. The missing sister has a history of emotional issues based around being the one who saw her parent's bodies after a murder suicide. The searching sister finds herself some guides to help her navigate the forest, and the weirdness begins. At nightfall, sounds and images appear in an attempt to claim her as another victim of the forest as well. Once it starts it doesn't let up. But one of the things that really cemented this as a classic for me was that it did not have a happy ending. When I see scary movies I want them to linger, and everyone skipping happily into the sunset does not do it for me. What happens here is what creates a lasting impact.

The Forest may not be perfect, but it's definitely one of the better horror releases in years. But then I assume those who hate this probably adore over-hyped garbage like The Witch, which was neither horror, eerie, interesting or effective.

The film relies on a poorly justified quest and a thrown-together bit of historical content from the protagonist's childhood to move things along. Nothing about this film immerses the viewer into its world beyond, perhaps, the Japanese landscape.

Other users have commented that this film does great justice for slow-tension psychological thriller/horrors. I'd be strongly skeptical of those claims - things roll along slowly, sure, but nothing more than jump scares and poor decision making fuel this roll. The connection between the sisters is never explored, making this already confusing film simply more frustrating.

Natalie is such an outstanding addition to the caste.
She is believable and haunting as she plays twin sisters. When their parents die when they are  young children the only  thing the sisters do not share is seeing their dead bodies. As adults one sister (Jess) goes missing in the Suicide Forest and the other (Sara)  goes on a mission to find her.
Many aspects of the film are in fact based on truth
*Aokigahara, also known as the Suicide Forest or Sea of Trees, is a 35-square-kilometre (sic) forest that lies at Mount Fuji's northwest base in Japan. *
(The 3rd most popular place in the world for suicide. )
Because the forest is so thick and dense people do use tape now as a way to mark their paths so as not to get lost.
Close to the start of the film a school girl and teacher/principal are speaking to Sara (Natalie Dormer) about the suicide forest and they actual give real life facts- after watching the film I wanted to know how much was truth about this area if anything and appears all of it is truth..

SPOILER INFORMATION BELOW:

She befriends a writer who offerers to help her find her sister or at least attempt to find her.  They enter the forest with the help of a park guide and they find her sister's tent. Sara refuses to leave and Aiden (Taylor Kinney who plays the writer) does not want to leave her alone depiste thinking her sister is already dead. They both stay the night..........................
I love suspenseful movies but my husband does not, this is a Physiological thriller and had me captivated up to the last minutes of the show.
Although they are warned to not believe anything you hear, see or think that is evil as it is y'rei (angry spirits) pulling out your sad thoughts and using your fears against you, Sara fails to remember this and it ends tragically as her thoughts take over her actions.

7597878,3,B01ACAEQMU,"Cliff Notes version: This movie lands us in Japan and is centered around ""The Suicide Forest"", which actually does exist. Not exactly a tourist hot-spot, but our main character, Sara, travels to Japan in search of her immensely irresponsible twin sister, Jess. Jess, who now lives in Japan for work, has disappeared into the ethers. Enter, Sara, Jess's sister. She takes off after she receives a phone call explaining her sister has been reported missing, assumed to be lost forever in the Suicide Forest. The ever helpful police tell Sara they will simply declare her sister dead after 3 days because 'nobody escapes alive'.
  On to the ""meat"" of the movie: Sara, the main character, is NOT a likeable heroin by any stretch of the imagination. There is a huge difference in being a strong, independent woman and one who is simply just a massive bitch. 'Sara' is the latter. There is NOTHING likeable about her. Nothing that makes you silently cheer for her throughout the movie hoping she finds her sister and lives happily ever after. In fact, I wanted to see her eaten by wolves, pushed off a cliff, or hit by a car. There is a scene where she falls into a pit, I smiled and was chuckling inside, like a sociopath, hoping she was meeting her end.
  Next up: 'Aiden', also an unlikeable character. He is a journalist from Australia who just happens to speak with an American accent (Say what??) and is currently living in Tokyo. He is a VERY underdeveloped character, so much so in fact, you kind of wonder why he is even there at all. He ultimately ends up ""helping"" Sara search for her lost sister in the Suicide Forest in exchange for the rights to their story so he can write an article about it. But is he there to help her or to murder her?? We don't know if he is well meaning or a serial killer and frankly, as the credits roll, you still have no idea as to ""what he is about"".
  The Forest is more of a paranormal-psychological-thriller than it is a horror movie. There are a few jump-scares peppered throughout, but this is by no means a slasher type movie. It's good at showing the psyche and what happens with the power of suggestion vs what is reality. In this sense the movie scores points with me. The acting, at times, is horrible. The script is even worse. Pair this up with an unlikeable lead female, a wishy-washy story line and you have a messy concoction that leaves you shrugging your shoulders and forgetting the movie within minutes after viewing. I really wish this movie was done by a Japanese director as the Japs have mastered the art of scary movies and paranormal chillers like nobody else can.
  In closing: Deep thinkers may appreciate this movie more than slasher, blood and guts lovers. You may want to wait until it premiers on HBO where you can watch it for free. The movie can be confusing at times but then it hops back on track and grabs you again just when you've decided to walk the dog rather than finish watching the movie.",1461369600,,2968,4.524253731343284

She's been in trouble her entire life, but she's a schoolteacher in Japan. Right. A story about the 'suicide forest' was a nice idea, but poorly executed in this movie.

7597888,4,B01ACAEQMU,"Natalie Dormer is best known for her roles on The Tudors, Elementary, and Game of Thrones. As I haven't seen a single episode of any of these, I scoured through her acting credits to see if there was anything I had seen her in. Turns out she was in Captain America: The First Avenger, but, alas, I cant remember her. At all. Nor did I recognize any of the other actors in the movie. In fact, the only thing I was familiar with was the forest itself, having previously tried to read a book based in it, and failing miserably.

The Forest moves slowly. Theres a few token jump scares, but it feels like you spend half the movie just waiting for things to pick up. Not that its necessarily a hardship, as Dormer is a good actress. Her facial expressions alone at times sell the scene. It moves almost seamlessly from straightforward drama to a state where you're never quite sure if whats going on is actually happening or not. The surrealism continues until the end of the movie, and to tell the truth, Im still not sure about one of the things that happened near the end.

Overall, The Forest wasn't a bad movie to watch by any means. I will say I don't think a lot of the jump scares they threw in were necessary, especially at the beginning and the one at the end. It was almost like they thought they needed them in order to classify it as a horror movie, where its really just better suited as a thriller. Its more believable as a thriller than it is as a horror, in any case.

Id recommend it, but not if you're going to pay more than 2.99 to rent it. Its not quite that good.",1461283200,,1580,4.2425249169435215

Suicide is no joke. Escpedially not in Japan where it has always been a pandemic. Mental healthcare is on the rise but it holds an even greater taboo than in the west. People feel lost and their illness forces them to take their own life.

Here is a great idea! Lets make a white washed horror movie that turns these sad souls into murderous monsters. Natalie Dormer, I love you, but this was a horrible choice.

This is a slower paced horror film, so if that's not something that interest you then this movie is most likely not going to be for you. It starts a bit slow as characters are introduced & things are set up. It picks up later on, especially when the characters are in the forest. Basic plot is a woman has a dream that her twin sister is in trouble & in the forest so she goes to Japan to find her. The cast is ok, nothing really great but far from bad also. A few jump scares & some creepy parts also but I wouldn't say the film as a whole was actually scary but that doesn't mean it wasn't enjoyable.

7597951,2,B01ACAEQMU,"This is a 3 star movie, demoted to a 2 star rating, because it should've easily been much better. (NO SPOILERS!)
First off, before I say more... People need to understand one thing and one thing only before watching this film:
This is far more psychological thriller, than a straight out horror flick... Which is why many people are unhappy -- Expected one thing, got another, and they either couldn't enjoy it as a result, or psychological horror/thriller just really isn't their cup of tea.

The Good:
Natalie's acting is superb throughout, something I wasn't sure she could pull off (being basically the sole main character, twice over) especially since her GoT character isn't all that multi-dimensional and haven't really seen what she can do acting-wise, outside of that and Mockingjay)... Anyway... Her acting saves this movie from being Zero to One stars, because had they cast anyone even slightly less talented, it wouldn't have been enough, imo.
-- The cinematography is also really beautiful... Creepy-beautiful at times, but beautiful regardless.  The visual effects, while not terribly original, were very good, albeit reserved mostly toward the end of the movie (as it the case with most movies like this)... Would've liked a few more scary bits (not ""gotcha"", but ""tense-scary bits/scenes"") but there was still a decent amount.

The Bad (and the Ugly):
They try WAY too hard trying to confuse the audience as to whether her fears are justified or whether it's all in her mind.
The pathetic thing is, one of them is an obvious horror-movie ""red herring""; and trying to convince us otherwise, REPEATEDLY, is not only a waste of imaginative possibilities that could have replaced that erroneous and cliched concept; but seriously, it's insulting as hell.
-- It's like the movie Titanic... You know the essential story before you ever go into the theater... The ship sinks and nearly everyone dies.
The film Titanic was named Titanic for a reason, as was Psycho, and as was The Forest.
--- Did Cameron try to convince us that the passengers sank the Titanic using sabotage?... Did Hitchcock try to convince us the Hotel was supernaturally killing its occupants?... NO!... So WTF!?... Honestly, How Did NO ONE Argue This To The Writer &/or Director!?
Obviously, it's still necessary for her to play those emotions and situations because SHE IS unsure sometimes... But WE ARE NOT... and this was never a matter of, ""we see her trying to figure out if it's real or not""... no, this is mostly a case of, ""watch her try to figure it out when she notices it... and in the meantime, here, let me cram some cliched misdirection, shifty glances, creepy gazes, and uncomfortable silences down the throats of the audience (most of which the character is oblivious to) and so that way, the audience will be just as unsure as the character"" and on and on and on...  Look, that kind of film-making works for some movies, IF it's done correctly... BUT THIS IS NOT THAT FILM, and even if it were a film that could work in, THIS IS NOT HOW YOU DO IT.

In summation:
Sloppy, unimaginative writing, opting for a focused and yet half-a##ed ""who's the real culprit"" gag, instead of using ELEMENTS of that, combined with transferred focus on other areas (scares, thrills, drama, backstory, what the hell ever).
I guess mostly it just pisses me off that they think we're really that freaking stupid... that we'd actually believe their ""red herring"" the 3rd or 4th time they tried so desperately to convince us that we should expect the ""red herring twist/reveal"" at any moment.
-- You want to ""plat the seeds of doubt"" once or twice... that's one thing, and it's to be expected... But my God, I lost count of how many times they honestly try to convince the AUDIENCE (instead of the character) which is frankly insane since doing so ensures LESS doubt, not more.
Aside from that VERY annoying aspect of the film, and the disappointment that they didn't really explore the forest and it's mythology to my satisfaction (just a few brief mentions, mostly)... It was a decent film that I wouldn't mind watching again, if I had to... But I'll sure as hell never pay to do so.",1460505600,,4159,4.811188811188811

7597955,5,B01ACAEQMU,"I gave this film 5 stars to offset the horrible (and quite non-sensical and confused lower star reviews). In truth, I would rate this film anywhere between 3.5 - 4 stars (that's pretty good for a non-A-list type of horror film). I'm objective, I'm picky with what I watch, and I'm greedy with my money. You can be sure that I read through all of the 1 stars before viewing this film for the first time. I wanted to know what I was paying for and was almost discouraged from buying this and watching it. Boy am I glad that I didn't listen to the haters. I rarely leave reviews, but I wanted to give this film its due by adding my two cents to the mix. So here comes an honest opinion from someone who is a film veteran and an avid fan of all types of horror.

There are several types of people who will likely be drawn to this film by viewing the trailer:

1. Date night/boredom/need something to kill time
2. Supernatural horror fans
3. Gore/Slasher lovers
4. Asian horror lovers

If you are possibly one of these people, then you should be aware of something important. ""The Forest"" doesn't fit into a neat category but, in many ways, encompasses a lot of different things. From the trailer, I went into the film expecting a supernatural scare or something of that ilk. What I got instead was a kind of psychological thriller that took me for quite a ride. There are many elements of the supernatural (as you can see from the trailer), there are elements of Asian horror (aside from the obvious fact that all of this takes place in Japan), there is blood and gore and creepiness (just enough to make you uncomfortable, but not a slasher at all), and there are enough twists and turns to keep the average viewer guessing.

This is not a slasher. This is not really a ghost movie. This really isn't classical horror. What truly makes this movie terrifying is the thought that our minds are our greatest enemies and that our fears, regrets, and emotions can be pitted against us in the most monstrous of ways.

People in the lower stars have been complaining about slow pace, cheap scares, and bad acting. Let me diffuse that. There are a couple of cheap scares that make you jump then frown at the screenwriter's lameness. These are, all in all, less than 30 seconds of the film. The pace is a bit slow for a classic horror film. It's not all chase scenes, blood, screaming, and mindless terror. This is a movie that takes its time to build a real and believable atmosphere - more than that, it takes time building the protagonist, which is the driving force of this entire movie.

The protagonist in ""The Forest"" isn't a brainless meat bag meant to run around and scream her lungs out or cower in the darkness as footsteps of her hunters approach. This is a character we have to know and believe in because most of the film (and the horror) focuses on her internal conflicts. In that sense, the movie will have disappointed those looking for truly ""basic"" thrills because they didn't come to the theatre to think about symbolism or to get attached to a character. They came for thrills, but they weren't open to them.

The acting wasn't terrible. All in all, the role of Sarah wasn't a difficult one, and the actress they chose pulled through just fine. She didn't carry this movie, nor did she need to because the director and producer did a marvelous job with filming and creating the world of her mind. There were plenty of side characters that did a marvelous job in supporting the movie and making everything much creepier and more believable. Overall, this was a great movie that I'm happy to have in my collection to see again and again over the years.

Not quite a Crimson Peak or The Ring in my book, but it's far far away from the true flops of this genre like ""Witch"".",1460332800,40,3779,4.458755426917511

7597957,2,B01ACAEQMU,"This movie took a really great premise and totally wasted it. The pacing never really gets off the ground as attempts at building tension fall flat, cheap jump scares are telegraphed from miles away, and a promising beginning just fizzles out with no payoff. A subplot about the main character's parents gets teased constantly and then gets buried by a jumbled dream sequence. Ultimately what could have been a really interesting and creepy ghost story becomes over an hour of watching an unlikable protagonist get lost in the woods and behave irrationally without much provocation from the ""ghosts.""

7597963,5,B01ACAEQMU,"I don't think the people rating this movie so low are doing it for the right reasons. Symbolism is absolutely entrenched in this film, but most of us aren't looking for ""smart"" in our horror films these days, are we? So no, it is not an obvious, in your face scare fest. The fear it evokes occurs on a far deeper level; the imagery creates tension, the pace creates tension (yes, it is slow, but purposefully so), the whole point is that nothing is truly as it seems and we are not in control. When you think about it, what is scarier than not having control?
Plus, as always, Natalie Dormer is enchanting.

I thought the premise behind the movie was cool and unique. Fun fact: the movie takes place in a real life forest near Mount Fuji where many people had gone there to end their own lives. Going back to the movie, I definitely felt that the movie had potential to be good but was sadly not executed in the best way. Is it a horrible movie? Not necessarily, there were a few moments that I was invested in, like the main character and the story. Some major criticisms I do have with the movie is that the movie, like a LOT of horror movies today, relies HEAVILY on predictable jump scares and doesn't have a particularly effective atmosphere. Overall, The Forest, while I wouldn't call it the big pile of garbage that a lot of people refer it as, could have been better had they avoided the overuse of jump scares and tried to make the movie creepy and atmospheric.",1458518400,,1086,4.354679802955665

First off this is a snorefest from top to bottom the characters are uninteresting, clearly they weren't in Japan and resort to using stock footage. The script is all over the place and clearly doesn't know what it wants to do and the direction is effortless and lazy. There's a scene where the main character goes to a Japanese restaurant and her food squirms I mean not only is this film bad but it wants to portray stereotypes. Also this is the movie where the character resort to being pretentious in an attempt to seem interesting.

8747024,4,B01ACAEQMU,"This was a good, atmospheric supernatural horror film set in Japan. It wasn't particularly gory, had a lot of jump scares, at times it was actually quite beautiful, had great production values, was well cast and well-acted, had believable dialogue, and the main characters personality and history figured nicely into the narrative.

The story centers on the character Sara Price (played by Natalie Dormer). She gets a call from police in Japan that her identical twin sister Jess is dead. She was seen going into Aokigahara, a forest at the northwest base of Mount Fuji in Japan, long famous as a destination for the suicidal to venture to (and also quite, quite haunted). Over the fairly reasonable objections of her fianc Rob (played by Eoin Macken)  as Jess has gotten into trouble before and Sara has always come to her rescue  Sara flies to Japan and stays at the hotel Jess had been staying at.

At the hotel Sara meets another American, a reporter by the name of Aiden working for an Australian company (Aiden is played by Taylor Kinney). She grills him about Jess, they bond some, with Sara sharing the sad tale of her parents death from a drunk driver years earlier and the very different ways Jess and her handled it (Jess looked at the horror, Sara kept her eyes closed), Aiden ends up inviting Sara to accompany him to the forest as a park guide by the name of Michi (played by Yukiyoshi Ozawa). Michi is on a trip to find people who might be wanting to commit suicide in the forest and if possible talk them out of it, and if he finds dead bodies to note them for other park rangers to retrieve.

Michi is quite reluctant to bring along Sara, mainly because there is a legend that the ghosts of the forest will tempt those already sad to stay and commit suicide and he rightly sees Sara is already sad.

The following day the three enter Aokigahara, with Michi noting that if the see a tent it means whoever entered the forest might be having doubts about committing suicide, while if they leave behind twine or rope they either want to find their way out again or sadly want people to be able to find their body when they have died.

The three towards the end of the day find Jesss tent  we see this tent in an earlier, creepy flashback, the tents ownership confirmed when Sara finds some of Jesss things in the tent  but Michi doesnt want to stay and search, not wild about being in Aokigahara at night (saying he fears being lost, though I think he was also a bit fearful of the place after dark for other reasons). Both Michi and Aiden try to convince Sara to return with them, fail, and Aiden volunteers to stay with Sara overnight, with Michi returning the next day and having given Aiden and Sara firm orders to stay put.

They of course do nothing of the kind, as in an amazingly short amount of time both end up wandering off from their tiny campfire, with Sara finding a young Japanese girl called Hochiko, one who claims to know Jess and warns Sara not to trust Aiden (but doesnt stick around when she hears Aidens voice).

What happens next is a series of ghostly encounters, mounting paranoia over whether or not Aiden may have killed Jess or at least lied about knowing her before he met Sara, with the viewer wondering how much of what Sara sees is real, how much imagined or in dreams. I won't say more than that, but there were many scenes that weren't what they appeared at first, lots of creepy jump scares, and quite a few ghosts.

I liked the movie, the woods were beautiful, I liked the twist of Sara wondering if Aiden was a killer or not at least (believably so) who he said he was (did he already know Jess, was he really a journalist or just trying to pick up Sara, how much of their conversations had he recorded?). The supernatural menace of Aokigahara was subtle, as Gollum might say tricksy, with not say a creature that will just come out and kill you, no, but if you are in the woods (and especially if you are already sad) you are in grave danger as it plays on your mind and your perceptions.

Though Sara and Jess outwardly differed only by hair color (Sara was blonde while Jess was dark-haired), they differed a lot in personality and this personality differences (Sara being the rescuer, Jess the adventurer, Sara still sad about the past, Jess moving on  this established in a flashback scene  and importantly Sara having closed her eyes at the sight of their dead parents, not only not having embraced a very dark moment in her life but having guilt that Jess bore that burden alone), these differences played a big role in how the two handled this haunted forest.

Few complaints about the movie from me. I don't know how Sara didn't see Hochiko as a ghost, just wandering in the woods at night with no light and with mysterious knowledge of Jess. Sara certainly got used to the idea during the movie that she couldn't trust her eyes and had in fact seen ghosts, but she never was to me sufficiently skeptical of Hochiko. I think Aidens and Saras early separation at Jesss tent after Sara went to bed was very poorly explained, though them separating was vital to the story. It wasn't a huge problem and given the lying, deceptive nature of the forest it might have been different for Sara then it was for Aiden.

I have seen some reviews say that the Aokigahara was somewhat trivialized by its use in the movie. I cant really speak to anything other than my impression and that wasn't how I felt. No one mocked those who went to the forest to die or to at least contemplate dying, when bodies were found they weren't lingered on as being grotesque and the other characters  if they weren't frightened  did treat the bodies with respect. I also didn't see anything I would call stereotypical Japanese behavior (there were other characters, including Japanese police officers, rangers, hotel workers, and students and teachers at Jesss school that Sara meets).  Japan wasn't presented as a superstitious place and indeed most people connected with the forest itself acted in a professional and compassionate manner with regards to Aokigahara.",1524441600,,6095,4.559011893870083
8747025,4,B01ACAEQMU,"Interesting setting in the suicide forest.  The ending was a bit unclear, but  I would definitely watch it again. It moves along at a good pace.",1522022400,,144,4.5
