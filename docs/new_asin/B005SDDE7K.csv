8484740,1,B005SDDE7K,"This is a Region 2 DVD, in PAL.  It will not play on most American DVD or blu-ray players.  I had stopped ordering from Movie Mars years ago because of all their problems and should have known not to order from them again.  It took me months before I had time to sit and watch this and when I finally did, I put it in and it won't work on any players in my house.",1505692800,,363,3.8133333333333335

8484743,5,B005SDDE7K,"Cold war storylines, intelligent scripts and wonderful background Music by Ray Ellis highlight this forgotten but excellent series from Filmation Productions.  Some of the layout/animation looks straight out of a marvel comic book from the same era. With the exception of a few episodes, it's obvious that this animated series was not written or produced for a kids audience which makes me love the series even more!  It would be great if the DVD was released domestically as opposed to ordering the UK version.",1484870400,3,511,5.071428571428571
8484744,5,B005SDDE7K,I was wondering if the New Players will play Region 1 in the United States or is there a Region 1 Version for this DVD,1483228800,,118,3.76
8484745,4,B005SDDE7K,"Very few people will remember this animated series,loosely based on Twentieth Century Fox's 1966 motion picture of the same name,but the cartoon series ""FANTASTIC VOYAGE"" made its debut on ABC Saturday mornings on Sept 14,1968,and was the second of three animated TV shows produced by Filmation Associates and Twentieth Century Fox Television,exclusively for ABC-TV.  the animated series focuses on the four main characters working for the CMDF-Combined Miniaturized Defense Force,under the supervision of a mysterious Top official,who the CMDF team answers to,before being dispatched on their various missions, the main characters are ""Cmdr Jonathan Kidd"",a ""Nick Fury"" type of person,and the mysterious ""Guru"",a master of certain mystical spiritual powers,,and ""Erica Lane"",a lovely Blonde haired beauty,and a scientific medical aid,,and the obnoxious,but highly inteligent ""Busby Birdwell"",inventor of the ""Voyager"" craft,that functions both underwater and in the air,and used on many of the CMDF missions! then there is ""Professor Carter"",who supervises the functions of The Miniaturizer,a top secret device,that can shrink people and equipment down to microscopic size. in the 17 produced half hour shows,""FANTASTIC VOYAGE"" focuses mainly on adventures,using the miniaturized team of agents to aid in the government's most top secret missions,involving rogue spy satelites,dangerous double agents,an occasional rogue mystic,and alien encounters- even one episode called ""Mind Of The Master"",where ""Guru"" is ambushed and put into a mysterious coma,that eventually results in the CMDF team being miniaturized into their friend's body,to zap the source of their friend's condition-a former mystical colleague from Guru's past,is the culprit!  while the show wasn't exactly as original as the movie it was based on,it was still well written,using the voice talents of Ted Knight,Jane Webb,and ""THE MILLIONAIRE""s Marvin Miller,who voiced many characters in his distinguished film and TV career! but ""FANTASTIC VOYAGE"" would be the major stepping stone to Filmation's cartoon history,as the studio would later take on the outstanding task of bringing ""STAR TREK"" back to the small screen,after its unwise cancelation by NBC in 1969. Fall 1968 was also a milestone for Filmation,as the studio also produced it's ground breaking series,""THE ARCHIE SHOW"",which,through music supervisor Don Krishner,and vocalist Ron Dante,would be a Rock Bubble Gum sensation,with ""Sugar,Sugar"",and several other record albums to follow! but the longevity of ""THE ARCHIES"" was to run a whole decade,until February 1978,when the series was finished! Filmation in Fall 1968 was also responsible for bringing Batman & Robin into their very first cartoon series,shortly after ABC cancelled the 1966-68 TV series,in a new animated series called ""THE BATMAN-SUPERMAN HOUR"" for CBS,,all relevant to ""FANTASTIC VOYAGE""s animated series,that ABC ran until 1970,and still fondly remembered by older Baby Boomers who grew-up watching this show! while the DVD set has yet to see an American release,i'd recommend this series to only serious cartoon fans,who knew and appreciated shows like this,when they were produced by cel animation studios,back in the days of hand drawn animation,before CGI technology made all of that obsolete! Lou Scheimer,Norm Prescott,and Hal Sutherland were true pioneers of Saturday morning cartoons,with Hanna-Barbera and DePatie-Freleng and others,,and their Filmation cartoon shows will always be remembered,and seriously enjoyed,for decades to come!",1474156800,8,3548,5.927734375
