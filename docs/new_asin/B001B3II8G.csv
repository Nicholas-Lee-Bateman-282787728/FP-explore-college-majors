8281736,5,B001B3II8G,My son started watching this since he was 6 months old and he loves it. This is one of the best Farsi educational videos I have found for my child. I wish there were more like it but unfortunately there aren't. I also have the color one but please make more!!!!,1390435200,,261,4.137254901960785

8281739,4,B001B3II8G,"I got this because its the only Childrens Farsi Dvd I could find. It was done pretty well, but some of the images are pretty boring. Pointing to body parts and saying the names for example. This could have been made more interesting with a song. However there are some great puppets, especially the one that sneezes, there are also plenty of things to keep my 9 month engaged.",1269907200,,376,4.463768115942029

8281741,5,B001B3II8G,"A charming production of characters, colors, and music with the latest animation techniques bring to life a powerful message of family unity and respect.  I highly recommend the trailers (in both languages) to the parents.  Well done.",1221609600,,234,5.297297297297297
