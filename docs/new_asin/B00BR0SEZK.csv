8572976,5,B00BR0SEZK,"I was always a fan of Johnny Mack Brown.  In the late 1950's i met Johnny and found him to be a great person.  His ""B"" grade movies were a lot of fun and great to watch.  No singing or gimmicks just lots of action and lessons to be learned.",1383868800,4,240,3.76
8572977,5,B00BR0SEZK,"I wasn't old enough (born in 1946) to see Johnny Mack Brown at the theatre, but I do remember watching his westerns on TV in the mid-to-late 1950s. As I watch them now on DVD, I realize that the dialogues were at times rather hokey, the story-lines were not that original or creative, the acting was not terribly nuanced . . . But, I still love these old westerns and take them for what they were. My wife doesn't understand why I enjoy them so much, and I'm not sure why I do either; but if you love old westerns, then this Monogram Cowboy Collection won't disappoint you.

8572978,5,B00BR0SEZK,"As a young boy  6 years of age and older we went from the farm to town on Saturday and some of time I got to go see those old ""B"" westerns and I still enjoy seeing those old westerns today.",1372464000,4,189,3.6097560975609757
8572979,5,B00BR0SEZK,"Another excellent DVD from the Monogram Cowboy collection with 9 features from the great Johnny Mack. The transfers are practically perfect. THE TEXAS KID and PARTNERS of the TRAIL are two of the better films as the series nears the end in 1952. Marshal Reed is good in a support role in THE TEXAS KID. One note of interest: The last film in the series, CANYON AMBUSH, has an original screenplay by Joseph Poland, but the plot and much footage are from MONTANA DESPERADO from a year earlier written by Dan Ullman. Brown was a football hero, helping Alabama win the ROSE Bowl in the late twenties, and getting into the movies. If you ever pass thru Dothan,Alabama, be sure to look at some wonderful murals of Brown's career on a downtown street near his boyhood home.

How do I find out. I don't want to wait til ""Mr Jim"" reviews it. (He always tells you exactly what's what). Can anyone help?? AW",1364860800,2,302,4.135593220338983
