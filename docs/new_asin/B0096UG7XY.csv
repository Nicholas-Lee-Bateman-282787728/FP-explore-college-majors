5274489,4,B0096UG7XY,I enjoyed watching this film very much. I am a big Rob Williams fan and was not disappointed. The fresh take on maneuvering through relationships was delicately and maturely dealt with. The sex-positive approach was also very welcome. Another good job by Guest House films.,1354838400,7,273,5.088888888888889
5274490,5,B0096UG7XY,"After his friends flake out on his planned 40th birthday celebration, Doug (Eric Dean) is feeling alone, with nobody special in his life, except for Jacob (Michael Nicklin), an older man with whom he occasionally gets together.  When hunky 30 year old new neighbor Colton (Benjamin Lutz) comes to the door, a fortunate misunderstanding throws he and Doug together, and they start to develop a promising relationship.  All goes well until he finds out that Colton is actually Jacob's son, so he has been dating ""the boy next door"" and his dad!.

An interesting and amusing screenplay by director Rob Williams, with an ambitious cast of supportive players that adds much to the story.  An amusing situation, but it also raises serious issues about ageism in the gay community, as well as making a sacrifice for the happiness of someone you love.  It's a positive message appropriate for viewing in mixed company.

DVD has deleted scenes, bloopers, commentary and a ""making of"" featurette.  Not rated, but would be a light R for brief nudity and sexual content.  Five stars out of five.",1354147200,36,1083,4.912087912087912
5274491,5,B0096UG7XY,"This movie blew me away! I had the extreme pleasure of seeing it at a Gay and Lesbian Film Festival where it won a much deserved 'Audience Favorite' award.
Rob Williams has done it again! I laughed until I cried-- the entire audience laughed-- and I am convinced we missed half the comedic genius because we were so busy laughing at the previous line... I cannot wait to get my copy of the film so I can hear what my laughter drowned out the first time!
And the cast? WHERE do they find these people? I've seen Eric Dean and Benjamin Lutz in other films- both smokin' hot and on top of their games-- but Michael Nicklin is a new face to me and -WOW!- drool worthy and a brilliant actor!
The characters were bumbling and lovable- completely believable- and Heidi Rhodes was hysterical! The plot was outrageous and the dialogue pure awesomeness!
I cannot praise this film highly enough!",1350604800,15,884,4.53125
5274492,3,B0096UG7XY,"Surely, surely it must be possible to locate and cast some reasonably good-looking actors willing to play gay roles who can actually ACT ?
Every gay themed movie I have ever watched that has come out of the USA suffers the same problem.
Come to think of it, do they even have to be all that good-looking? Is that such a necessary pre-requisite for us to watch these days? Why not present ""normal"" people?
Are they casting for looks alone now?  Must be so, because there's a lot of ""wood"" here, ...and for those of you of gay persuasion, NOT the sort you're probably hoping for!
(I'll get that bit over now. There are TWO scenes of full frontal male nudity, (one apparently SUPER-endowed bloke to freeze-frame), and one lesser but by no means inadequate onscreen for quite a while, but neither are main characters, right?)

This rather predictable tale concerns a gay man turning 40, (yeah, year, mid-life crisis ho-hum), who suddenly discovers he's bedding both Father AND Son...like you do!
(They look nothing alike, ...nor does the actor playing the protagonist look anything like his own twin brother! Small point but....?)

Now this unlikely situation is let go on for FAR too long...(as if it was ever going to work), until FINALLY a decision is made and then everybody lives happily ever after...of course!
The writing is fairly poor, there is little real exposition .....and some of the performances just weird.
There is this female best friend who has an apparently unruly kid. (Mercifully we never see him, just her shouting at him.)
I'm not sure just how to describe her acting style but she's obviously been hitting some sort of chemical assistance, as evidenced by her truly odd grimaces, postures and deliveries.  What is she on...other than wine?
Mind you, she's not given the best dialogue to work with, but tell me you don't think she's pilled to the gills?

A male best friend does little other of significance than get his jeans and briefs off and play the rest of the conversation with his genitalia fully exposed to his platonic friend...like you do!
Anyway, ....after much angsty conversations and descriptions about who's doing what to whom, ...both with friends, brothers and the participants, ...we finally get to the bloke's 41st birthday party and THE END.

Now while I didn't ""HATE"" this, it breaks no new ground and apart from the initial promising set-up of the Father/Son dilemma, nothing else is really explored or developed to any extent.
Would having gay sex with two different family members (boom-tish?) (no, NOT at the same time you porn-fed pervert !) cause any worries to anyone these days?
If this was a straight move where the man was having it off with the Mother AND the Daughter, would it even cause so much as a raised eye-brow?

Mention must be made of the poor sound recording on this DVD.
Sometimes you will have difficulty understanding what they are saying, it seems a little gabbled at the very beginning.....then it's very soft, only to become unexpectedly VERY loud in parts.
Quite annoying as you have to keep fiddling with the remote to try to modify this defect....and protect your ears.

A bit ""meh"" overall really, .....needed some good editing, but OK if you're not looking for anything in the way of a story line.
Three stars....I suppose.",1425859200,,3298,4.8144876325088335

Not your typical storyline, not your typical gay movie, with incredible actors, a great plot with a nice surprise ending.  A must have for any movie collector.",1391558400,2,442,4.176470588235294
5274518,2,B0096UG7XY,"Now the central conflict of the movie focused on Doug and what he actually wants in life. And while this is going on, he continues to entertain both father and son as far as going on dates, taking trips and of course a lot of sleeping around. And while there are some nuances to each of their personalities, it almost feels like it does not matter who they are and it's all up to Doug.

But what becomes frustrating is that Doug isn't actually taking steps to figure things out. Instead he just goes on having fun, which may be generally realistic, but it doesn't make it any less annoying. I would still think that any regular guy would actually take more action to help him ""choose"", although why Jacob and Colton feel Doug should take the lead is a little beyond me. So I guess they get what they deserve in this regard.

Moving beyond this little quagmire in the middle of things, the rest of the movie isn't quite bad but isn't remarkable either. Acting is passable with both good and bad moments. The guys are relatively hot (which somehow still matters in these movies), although we are stuck in the stereotypes that gay men quaff wine by the case at any given moment.

The movie is described as a ""fast-paced comedy"", but I didn't necessarily feel that. Maybe it was the lack of musical scoring for most of the movie (which may more a trope for comedies than a necessity) or the lack of narrative progress as we wait for Doug to even just begin to make a decision about the two men in his life. Thankfully, they never have a threesome.

The Men Next Door had a theoretically funny premise but didn't really know where it wanted to take things. The central plot may be appreciated by others but it really just didn't work for me and it took a lot of the movie down with it.",1390176000,,1780,4.3685800604229605
5274519,5,B0096UG7XY,This was worth the purchase. I can't begin to express how good this movie was. I can't wait to purchase more in the future.,1388793600,,123,4.166666666666667
5274520,3,B0096UG7XY,"This movie had a sexy premise however poorly executed.  It was a low budget film but thats no reason for poor choices in direction.  The dynamic between father and son could have been so much deeper....and the shared love interest could have also been fuller and more meaningful for all involved....I just didn't believe any of it and I really wanted to.  As gay men our lives are very different from that of straight men so a situation as quirky as the premise of this film interested me.  I think more could have been gotten from the actors with better direction.  I don't mean to be so harsh on the director but after all he's the captain of the ship and if the ship goes down he's responsible.
I would rather see a smaller simpler approach to this story then attempting to make it ""more for less""  This is a prime example where  ""less is best""!",1388188800,,848,4.397435897435898
5274521,3,B0096UG7XY,"I watched the entire show and was on the fence, but came to the conclusion that this was rather ridiculous.  It's not inconceivable that a man would date two individuals and that they turn out to be related, so the premise of the men next door being father and son, while unlikely, seemed within the realm of possibilities.  But they main character (whatever his name was) refusing to choose between the two, yet having the expectation that both his lovers would just let him go on dating the pair of them since he couldn't decide, seemed ludicrous to me.  Not ending it immediately or having the decency to at least pretend that you'd work towards a solution to the debacle seemed very selfish and hugely immature.  As for the men, the older of the two, looked extremely haggard for his age. A charming gentlemen, but no offense to the baby boomer generation - love scenes were painful to look at.  The younger of the two was by a landslide the more attractive actor, but he acted more like 17 than the 30 year old he was meant to portray.  He seemed rather emotionally unbalanced....  (pouty, emotional, possessive)  I'm not sure that I would have wanted to end up with either of the father/ son pairing.  This was just - well, weird.",1387670400,,1236,4.5565610859728505

5274527,4,B0096UG7XY,"The main man in between the father & son, was a good try. I thought he should be a bit more hunky. The son himself is cute but knowing that they're supposed to be related, they didn't look like it. Trying to date 2 men at the same time is confusing, but dating 2 men that are related is even more complicated. The concept for the story was a good idea. For a few good laughs, I'd recommend this movie. It's definitely not your typical gay themed comedy! But in my opinion, to each his own.",1380931200,2,489,4.104166666666667

5274531,5,B0096UG7XY,"Disclaimer: some plot spoilers involved.

Quite interesting and good.  Sort of a sexual farce.  About a man, Doug, his 40th birthday, and how he starts to date two men  one 30, one 50. They both seem such good matches for him. Then he discovers why they both feel so familiar  They are father and son.

The story is told though several perspectives, but mostly through Doug sharing the events over the phone  with his fraternal, married, straight, twin. There is a lot of bawdy nudity and sex jokes, but nothing that really classifies as porn, or even really erotic.  It has a backsided sort of romantic feel.

There is also a lot of short scenes with his friends, who provide insight and comic relief.  One event in particular with one of his gay friends has these lines:

You have me when you want to get fashion advice on your pathetic wardrobe. The only time Ive ever approved of your wardrobe was on that cruise when you coordinated your cock rings with your swimsuits.

Well who doesnt do that?

Oh, youd be surprised.

During the setup, there is part of the movie where Doug and the father know about him and the son, and they try to keep it quiet while trying to figure out how to tell him.  Of course it comes out in a very humorous moment.

So when they all know, the decide to just see what happens.

What happens is father and son become competitive with his time and coming up with better things to do, dates, places, sex 

Until the father and son decide for the sake of their relationship to both break it off.  And then they all find it hard to bear. Each makes their case to Doug about who he should choose, and Doug finds himself turning to his brother, to ask him how he knew his wife was the right one. His brother replies:

When I made plans with Karen I felt, different , excited, no exciteds not the word. I felt . content. Like nothing could go wrong. Like being with her is exactly where I was supposed to be.

Does one of those men next door make you content. Not just happy content.

Well that is enough spoiling.  Won't tell you who he chooses.",1375315200,,2072,4.3359375

That being said, this movie completely fits the bill.
The situation is quite humorous, and how the protagonist works his way through deciding what he needs to do is captivating enough to draw you into the story.

5274561,5,B0096UG7XY,"This movie was a great film. We watch a lot of gay movies that are plotless or it seems as if the film makers ran out of money during production. A lot of the movies just kind of end leaving you guessing what happens next. This film was very interesting and it has a surprise ending.

What I liked most about this film was the fact that it seemed real and it also addressed the older generation of gay men. Unfortunately 50 is like 80 to most gay men. Just remember that the older gay men paved the way for a more acceptable society for younger gay men.  I am in my 40's and my partner is 30 years older than myself. We have had a wonderful and monogamous relationship for 13 years now. Yes this is a big age difference, but chemistry is chemistry and what we have together works on so many levels. I just wish that this film was available in Blu-ray format, but the picture quality is really great and it does not have black bars.

I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is dating an older or younger man as they will relate to the film more than the 20 somethings will, unless they have older partners.",1361145600,20,1119,4.219626168224299

5274567,4,B0096UG7XY,"Doug (Eric Dean - `Arizona Sky') is a forty year old gay man who is dating a fifty year old man Jacob (Michael Nicklin) and they are getting along just fine, but not ready to commit. Then on the night of Doug's actual fortieth birthday he invites all his friends around, and they all fail to show for various reasons. His brother does send a stripogram though, only it's a lady. Then hunky next door neighbour calls round with some mis delivered mail and things sort of happen, as they only can in the movies.

Any way his bestest gal pal Evelyn (Heidi Rhodes) turns up and catches them, but she is actually really supportive and Doug decides to see both men as Colton is thirty he has one lover ten years older and one ten years younger - possibly a dream come true. Colton is played by Benjamin Lutz who you may remember from `The Love Patient' and as ever is really rather good. But there is always going to be a problem with trying to see both men and his schedule gets busier and busier and it is inevitable that both men will eventually meet, even though they know it is an open relationship, but the real big deal is that they are father and son - oh very dear indeed.

Anyway this is billed as a fast paced gay comedy, well it is not my idea of fast to be honest and I did not find myself reaching for the Kleenex to wipe away tears of mirth - or for any other reason as there is not that much in the way of bed room diversion either let alone a gratuitous shower scene; never mind. However, that said I found this to be a rather an awkward funny and as such much more of a drama. There are some well observed lighter moments, but selling it on the gags is a bit mis leading. The acting is all above par and Eric Dean is a great leading man, we even get Mark Cirillo (Going Down in La La Land) doing a good supporting role, and at a ninety minute run it is a satisfying film in many ways.

This does deal with the obsession of youth rather well which is often missing from main stream films let alone those of this genre. So if you like a warm love drama and like a gay film that is not an excuse for lots of rumpy pumpy then you will find something here of interest.",1359763200,3,2175,4.10093896713615

The story flows, it does leave you wondering ""which one will he choose""; though, personally, I would have told the lead to take a hike given his inability to select which relationship & man with whom he wishes to move forward.

The production values are very good.  Most of the acting is good; though the woman playing the requisite straight friend is all but unwatchable.  Neither of the two female characters (the other being a stripper, in a cameo role) is particularly well drawn or complimentary to the gender.

The Men Next Door is a beautiful movie that shows its audience that Love comes in many variations. Regardless, of the ""mainstream"" kind of ""Love"" that is pumped from the social media of our society. There is a kind of Love that never gets old and that has been placed in an individuals heart all along for that one special person, and it will always remain there as those individuals go through their journey we call Life. This is beautiful movie that catches the eye of many who like to have an after feeling of thought, contentedness, and a heart-warming, heart-felt laugh throughout the movie. It is beautiful written and directed and ALL of the characters are portrayed beautifully! :)  I loved this movie a lot and it is definitely a movie that I will own to watch again and make me feel good and look towards my future so that through my journey as I keep going, that I will find my loved one as well. I highly recommend this movie, I promise that you will not be sold short and want your money back! :)  I can see why this movie won so many awards it is absolutely flawlessly done and I could tell that this movie was not just a ""quick"" movie to be done, but rather a movie that wanted to be seen as it is, A Love Story.

I thought the cast was perfect for the roles they play, and the film is a satisfying journey into love. I really enjoyed the movie, and found myself wondering who would pick who. The ending, while a little bit too neat given the complexity of the triangle was the perfect ending for the film.

It's simply not easy aging in the gay community, and being older on the gay dating scene is particularly challenging.  The criticisms that some Amazon reviewers have made of this film didn't hold true for me.  The production values were remarkably strong for an Indie.  There were at least six distinctly different locations for the action -- a Pilates studio, ""Doug's"" house, ""Colton's"" rental, ""Jacob's"" mountain cabin, ""Derek's"" house & patio, and ""Evelyn's"" kitchen.  The gay male characters weren't particularly butch or femme, they were just guys.  The one exception was the flamboyant comic relief provided by ""Doug's"" employee at the Pilates studio. The gratuitous full-frontal nudity of actor Mark Cirillo was a pleasant surprise, and made me look at him in a different light, having just seen him in another gay-themed indie this weekend.  On balance, this film was a delightful way to spend a little time on Christmas afternoon.  And, best of all, the story ended far differently than I expected.  A delightfully unexpected conclusion was frosting on the cake.",1356393600,19,1188,5.151041666666667
