3473158,5,B001AXTV88,"I want to tell every one that this is a very good set of 4 movies English style
I especially like the Poldark movie here
It is an extention of Poldqark 1 and Poldark 2
the children have grown up and Poldark has gotten involved with politics.
Very good acting
I do hope the BBC makes another installment to this story
Buy this set for some very good movies.
chfancier, fancier of fine movies",1306627200,16,390,4.283783783783784
3473159,5,B001AXTV88,"I bought this DVD because I had seen The Cater Street Hangman on TV and I wanted to own it.  It appears to be an ITV and A&E co-production.  I miss A&E(before Bounty Hunters).  It is an enjoyable film.  I am now watching Lady Audley's Secret, and it is also enjoyable.  The casts of both films are very good. I waited a long time for the price of this DVD set to go down.  At the current price, it is a good deal and worth purchasing.",1304380800,23,434,3.988372093023256
3473160,5,B001AXTV88,I really enjoyed the Cater Street Hangman and being able to see one of Anne Perry's novels on the screen.  I liked the Four Feathers but I believe that I have seen that on TV.  I watched Poldark and did not understand why the movie ended the way it did.  All in all it is good to have movies of the Victorian period to go with the Victorian mysteries I love to read.,1293235200,4,366,3.9863013698630136
3473161,4,B001AXTV88,"I'd already bought and seen ""The Four Feathers"" and ""Lady Audley's Secret.""  The first is not bad, the second is excellent. What I really bought this DVD for was the two films I had not yet seen:  ""The Cater Street Hangman"" and ""Poldark.""  If you take the ""Cater Street Hangman"" as melodrama with a modern socially concious twist, it's a gripping film:  Taut, suspenseful, and fairly mystifying till the end (I guessed the killer's identity fairly early on, but many viewers may not).  The production values are excellent.  ""Poldark"" is another story, a historical with a very thin connnection to reality, complete with many problems such as the young lady who always rides bareback--even the lower classes used saddles. The worst problem, though, is that this ""Poldark"" is so very much part of some series not given elsewhere, that not only are most plot lines entirely unresolved, but it ends right in the middle of a scene!",1221782400,90,926,4.86624203821656
3473162,4,B001AXTV88,"I have watched almost every film version available of THE FOUR FEATHERS (including this one), and was pleasantly surprised to find this now available on the instant video format. Beau Bridges plays ""Harry Faversham"", a young man who resigns his commission (by secretly tossing the orders into a fire place) to go with the Royal North Surry Regiment to the Sudan campaign and is subsequently branded a 'coward' by his friends and love interest (played by the lovely Jane Seymour). Faversham then spends the remaining portion of the film attempting to redeem himself and return the feathers one by one, demonstrating that he indeed is 'not' a coward. The sincerity of a man wanting to make amends for his shameful cowardice and the inner termoil that accompanies makes for good programming.

Harry Andrews gives an excellent performance as ""Gen. Faversham"", Harry's overbearing father. (Note: Casting an American in what is clearly intented to be a British role seemed a bit awkward - but Beau Bridges gives a fine performance.)

3473163,3,B001AXTV88,"Give the C ater Street Hangman a ""10"".Would love to see more inspector Pitt Videos...but there are none.
The Four Feathers was a good story too, and would recommend watching it.
As for the other two....Lady Audley's Scret and Poldark....I was unimpressed with Lady Audley....and felt like we were left hanging at the end of Poldark.",1362182400,,332,4.946428571428571
3473164,5,B001AXTV88,The first movie of her first book by Anne Perry. Followed the book very closely and had good actors and dialogue.,1357948800,,113,4.428571428571429
3473165,1,B001AXTV88,"When we ordered this set, my wife and I had high hopes.  We watch a great deal of British dramas and mystery series, and this looked like it might be entertaining....although I had my doubts of Beau Bridges in the Four Feathers.  While the costumes and locations added a nice touches, for the most part, it was over-acted and under-cast.
The Cater Street Hangman was the most watchable of the four made-for-British-TV movies, but not by much.
Lady Audley's Secret had its moments, but after a bit, the contrived plot twists went from melodramatic to silly.
The Four Feathers was, at best, poorly acted and stiff and stuffy and the action scenes were so badly done as to be comical
Poldark was unwatchable. Admititdly, we had recently watched the original Masterpiece Theater series which is excellent and a far better expenditure of resources - both time and money, and when we saw this story took place years later, we were, initially, intrigued.  It proved to be unnecessarily salacious and, again, poorly acted.
We could not finish it.

3473166,2,B001AXTV88,"I thought that two of these mysteries were entertaining and fairly well done, however two were not.  Poor quality of film, and they seemed to be quite old - I did not like ""Four Feathers"" and ""Lady Audley's Secret"".  Very poor.",1346025600,,227,4.512195121951219

3473168,1,B001AXTV88,"I have received and watched many movies and of course like everyone else I've had good and bad opinions about all of them. I am not a good writer so I have never wanted to write my reviews about previously watched Amazon films. This 1996 Poldark movie directed by Richard Laxton and produced by Sally Haynes is an exception. I write to warn others not to spend a penny on this DVD.
Other reviewers have made comparisons between this version of Poldark and the long running BBC series. I can make no comparisons because I've never seen the long running version. I actually thought all the lead actors in this 1996 version did a good job and that is the only reason I'm giving one star to the review rating. The producer and/or director who approved the release of this DVD should be ashamed and explain to the paying public what possessed them to rip people off.
This is the first film I've ever seen that provides no ending to the story at all. Several characters were set up to possibly form relationships and fall in love (Steven Cravenson with Clowance Poldark and Jeremy Poldark with Cuby Trevanion). The DVD takes the viewer nowhere near resolutions with any of them. The one thing I think any film viewer expects from a film is an ending (be it good or bad).
SPOILER: An Example - The film exposes strong emotions growing between Steven and Clowance. There is a dramatic scene between the two of them where the viewer is lead to believe some resolution will be worked out. Instead Steven runs after Clowance to presumably do just that and the film abruptly stops before they even speak. It's so obvious that there has to be more film somewhere resolving some of the plot lines that were developed. The resolutions never occur-an ending is completely left out.
Sadly, I liked what little story line was presented but with the abrupt stopping of the plot this DVD is a solid rip-off. Don't waste your hard earned money.",1332028800,17,1923,4.593023255813954

3473170,3,B001AXTV88,So far I've watched the Poldark video.  It is good but just not long enough to get a really good feel for the characters.,1308873600,,121,4.041666666666667
3473171,5,B001AXTV88,I enjoyed these movies immensely the whole 4 of them! The only comment I have IS THERE A SEQUEL TO FOLLOW POLDARK? They are well worth the price. I had seen Four  Feathers before and had been looking for a copy of that movie for my collection. The others I had not seen at all. And as I have already mentioned Poldark left me wanting to see the next episode. This is definitely worth buying.,1307836800,2,391,4.213333333333333

8280052,5,B001AXTV88,"Movies like this are what I love about older productions.  The costumes are good, the acting is acceptable, but the story that is told is just wonderful.
