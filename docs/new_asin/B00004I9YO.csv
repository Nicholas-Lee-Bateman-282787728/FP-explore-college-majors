1341053,4,B00004I9YO,Dance Hot Salsa 2 video follows the same pattern as video 1 but with more  advanced BASIC steps. There are 22 steps shown in this video. A person with  rhythm will be able to do any of the techniques in both Hot Salsa videos  with ease due to the teaching style shown. Both videos teach basic Salsa  steps. Together both videos give you a total of 47 Salsa steps. All you  will need for nightclub dancing. This is a very popular video. I use it for  video teaching.,965174400,12,465,4.2272727272727275

I got the basic so it made more sense to me and the lessons look very simple",1395964800,,103,3.727272727272727
7920535,5,B00004I9YO,"this video is packed with a lot of fantastic dance routine taught in detail by josie ""lovely legs"" neglia.
she has outdone herself again with this video.  i would also recommend her other salsa video levels 1 & 2
which are worth is price.",1355184000,,238,4.409090909090909
7920536,3,B00004I9YO,"For more views of this series, check out the VHS reviews. General consensus among reviewers is that this series is the current benchmark for LA style salsa instructional video. It is somewhat fast paced and contains large number (22) of steps and variations. Content-wise, I did not like this DVD as much as level 1 & 2 for several reasons. In general, I don't think use of instructional video(s) without lessons with real live teachers and multiple partners work well for learning salsa. This video more than any other video I have seen confirms this opinion especially because of vast differences in level of difficulty (and dangerousness) of moves in this video. Some of the steps (especially the solo steps) are too simple for advanced beginners to beginning intermediates, while some (in particular the dips) are too dangerous for advanced beginners to beginning intermediates at the pace of instructions given here. I think this video still works as a ""reference"" but I would recommend this video only to instructors or others who would like to have several salsa ""reference"" videos along with other videos in Josie's series (as well as videos by other instructors) because this video does not work well as a stand-alone.

Same faults that plague Josie's level 1 & 2 video are left uncorrected in this video. This DVD is not very fun to watch because of poor video and sound quality. On certain TVs (and TV settings), dancer's feet are nearly cut off at the bottom. The background is unnecessarily dark. Sound quality is abysmal (yes, the overdubbing 5-6-7 counting is still there!). I have not seen the VHS version but I suspect that the only improvement this DVD offers over VHS is the ease of going back and forth between moves or repeating a certain segment. To be fair, this probably is enough of reason to buy the DVD over VHS because with the fast pacing, you will find yourself repeating most segments over and over again.",1116288000,2,1936,4.831325301204819
7920537,2,B00004I9YO,"i'm an intermediate/advance dancer - the steps are great for beginners - i found the steps too basic for intermediate dancers.
The quality of the tape is not that great (can't get a clear picture when you pause it or slow-play it  :(
lessons are explained very thoroughly - i would recommend this video to intermediate/beginner dancers.",1015804800,6,336,4.894736842105263
7920538,5,B00004I9YO,"This video is great for intermediate-advanced level salsa dancers who want to learn or sharpen their salsa variations. The video features Josie Neglia and her assistant who are excellent at breaking down each step both male and female and once completed they dance the variation to music at least twice. The moves are classified as level III & IV salsa and indeed they are intermediate to advance steps. The video goes through each routine clearly and concisely which prevents the viewer from being overwhelmed. This video can meet the needs of salsa dancers who are at the intermediate level and wish to perfectionize their moves and beginners who are ready to try more difficult steps. I strongly recommend this video as it displays great choreography, coordination and is well organized from start to finish.",1015372800,6,811,5.059701492537314
7920539,4,B00004I9YO,"This video is definitely not for beginners! Get the first video if you are, there are plenty of nice steps and variations there. Josie breaks down each partners step individually, making it easy to follow. The level 4 part ""Hot steps and trick"" (or something like that) is pretty lame for my taste. I was expecting more partner to partner dancing but turned out to be include several solo steps. Overall, I found this tape to be very good for two reasons:
 1. She knows how to dance!!! (unlike some other video instructors)
 2. Each step is repeated at least four times before moving on to the next.",981936000,4,599,4.537037037037037
7920540,3,B00004I9YO,"Many of the dance videos are too basic.  This one may err the other way.  I had taken a Salsa class, so thought I could move to levels three and four.  I was wrong.  I'll see what happens when I go back to the first tape which has levels I & II.  Although they do go through the steps slowly, one time, because there are so many combinations, it requires multiple replays for me to get the hang of it.  I would much prefer to have seen them break down the steps one at a time rather than doing the whole combination.  I'll check back in after trying the more basic steps.",977011200,6,571,4.044642857142857
7920541,5,B00004I9YO,A friend and I purchased Josie Neglia's videos and found them to be excellent tapes all around.  Very well done.,972777600,2,112,4.6
