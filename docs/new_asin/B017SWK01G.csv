7533237,5,B017SWK01G,"For those who don't know anything about this release.  It is the final six post series films released on three DVDs.  It includes:

Perry Mason: The Case of the Telltale Talk Show Host (starring Raymond Burr)
Perry Mason: The Case of the Killer Kiss (starring Raymond Burr)
A Perry Mason Mystery: The Case of the Wicked Wives (starring Paul Sorvino)
A Perry Mason Mystery: The Case of the Lethal Lifestyle (starring Hal Holbrook)
A Perry Mason Mystery: The Case of the Grimacing Governor (starring Hal Holbrook)
A Perry Mason Mystery: The Case of the Jealous Jokester (starring Hal Holbrook)

This wraps up the 30 post series movies (26 with Burr).  I'm really not interested in the Paul Sorvino/Hal Holbrook final four but one must have them for a complete collection of the movies.  If you are really dead set against having the last ones I'm sure this will be followed up with the individual movies released two to a disk, and unless CBS is really really mean, you'll be able to buy the final Raymond Burr ones on one disk at a later date.

Just thought it would be nice to let everybody know what they're getting.  On CBS's site it's going for over $40 and is suggested retail at the usual $59 per set elsewhere.  Obviously it will save you money to pre-order it now from Amazon.

Personally...I can't wait!!!  I've already pre-ordered mine.",1458000000,16,1345,4.680851063829787
7533238,3,B017SWK01G,"How is someone expected to review this when there is no indication of what the collection contains? If it contains the last 6 movies in the Perry Mason series, why doesn't someone say so?",1453420800,15,187,4.529411764705882
7533239,5,B017SWK01G,"AS ALWAYS, RAYMOND BURR WAS GREAT BUT EXCEPT FOR THE 2 MOVIES THAT HE WAS IN BEFORE HIS DEATH, THE REST OF THE MOVIES WITH HAL HOLBROOK AND PAUL SORVINO WERE TERRIBLE.  I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT ONLY THE ONES WITH RAYMOND BURR IF POSSIBLE BUT YOU HAD TO BUY THE WHOLE SET.  BARBARA HALE AND ""KEN MALANSKY"" WERE BARELY IN THEM.  MAYBE THEY DIDN'T REALLY WANT A LARGE PART AFTER THE DEATH OF RAYMOND BURR.",1479254400,,397,4.266666666666667

7533247,5,B017SWK01G,"This collection has the last six movies in the Perry Mason series.  Raymond Burr is only in the first two movies and the other four have friends of Perry Mason defending the accused with the help of Mason's secretary Della Street and Ken Malansky.  The movies are:  The Case of the Telltale Talk Show Host, The Cast of the Killer Kiss, The Case of the Wicked Wives, The Case of the Lethal Lifestyle, The Case of the Grimacing Governor and The Case of the Jealous Jokester.  Each movie has a person accused of a murder they did not commit and the team has to work together to find the real killer and let justice prevail.  This is a great addition to the other Perry Mason movie collections.",1462838400,3,690,4.4015748031496065
7533248,3,B017SWK01G,"I missed the real Perry Mason in all, but, two of these movies.  I did love the plots of all of them, though.  No one can ever fill the role that Raymond Burr created so naturally & skillfully  with his forever secretary in life, Della.  It is so fun to watch the friendly bond these two people had on and off screen.  The chemistry flows like an ebbtide  between them.",1462838400,2,369,4.2

7533254,1,B017SWK01G,"the last collection volume surprised me because I was not expecting the actors that had filled in for Raymond Burr to successfully pull off a great performance as spellbinding in the court room as he always did as the character of the great Perry Mason.  I have long been a Perry Mason fan since aired in 1958. Of course, i now have my whole collection complete  tnank you!! ",1461283200,,375,4.485294117647059

7533257,5,B017SWK01G,"Just what I was waiting for in UK the last Perry mason the Two last with Raymond burr fantastic not watched the other four yet but sure they'll be good but without Raymond burr it was still a good idea to keep going after he died even if just four episodes

That's all 30 I've got now

For those in Europe remember you need a region 1 or all region player",1459209600,4,355,3.9859154929577465

8740534,5,B017SWK01G,"I love Perry Mason and Della Street, but it's such a shame Raymond Burr didn't live long enough to finish the series of movies. I hate that he passed away so soon. Still, the final four movies were still good. Just not the same without him.",1534809600,,240,4.239130434782608
8740535,5,B017SWK01G,"This set finished off the series of Perry Mason Movies, with The Case Of The Telltale Talk Show Host & The Case Of The Killer Kiss(both with Raymond Burr), as well as the four Perry Mason Mysteries with the help of Paul Sorvino(The Case Of The Wicked Wives) and Hal Holbrook(The Case Of The Lethal Lifestyle, The Case Of The Grimacing Governor & The Case Of The Jealous Jokester). With Raymond Burr's health failing, it was obvious in the last two he was in, using a cane to get around and holding on to objects most of the time. Still he put in a great effort on these last two, as with all of his other movies and the TV series. Telltale is about a talk show(duh) run by Regis Philbin's  character and also has Montel Williams, Mariette Hartley & G. Gordon Liddy. This is not one of the greatest of Perry Masons, but still interesting enough. Burr's last round as Mason is Killer Kiss in which a former ward of his is blamed for the murder of a soap star! This one is very good, and a great send off for Raymond! Then we have the rest of the movies. Wicked Wives with Sorvino is Paul's only round in the Mason Mysteries, and he does a pretty good job, taking up the case of a friend of his that's, what else, accused of murdering her photographer husband. Helping out here are several models: Maud Adams, Shelly Hack & Kathy Ireland! A fine stand-in for Raymond! As for the Holbrook movies, the first one, Lethal Lifestyle, is about a reality show star that gets killed and Holbrook comes to the aid of the accused. This one has has Robin Leach and Robert Englund guest starring. Pretty good, with Holbrook doing a great job, just one minor flaw that I won't mention that was completely overlooked! Grimacing Governor has two deaths that are related and Holbrook coming to the aid of the daughter of one of them. Guesting here are Tony Curtis, James Brolin & John Spencer. Very good! And finally we have The Jealous Jokester, with Holbrook back to defend yet another niece of his, this time for murdering an actress. Sadly, Barbara Hale is only in this a short time, as she says she hast to fly to The Hague to help Perry with a case he's presenting in the world court! A decent enough send off for the series, but would have been better with Barbara! All-in-all, a must have for the Perry Mason fan! RP",1523923200,,2305,4.385514018691588

8740538,5,B017SWK01G,"Full disclosure,I was in an extra in one of these. Always a big fan of Raymond Burr. Tough watching his health fail . This box set contains his last two films in his signature role.
 The rest of the movies featured ""Perry Masons' friends stepping in while he is out of town."" Although Hal Holbrook did a fine job as Bill McKenzie in three of the movies,its Paul Sorvino as Anthony Caruso that should have had more than one mystery to solve.",1497139200,,440,4.365853658536586
