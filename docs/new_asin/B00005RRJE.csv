1657876,3,B00005RRJE,"Is there any intelligent, reasonably conscious person left in America that isn't at least vaguely aware that women in fundamentalist Islamic societies are treated, by Western standards, little better than dogs? Well, if you're living in a vacuum, see THE CIRCLE for an education.
The film begins at the birth of a baby girl to the daughter of a woman who realizes that this will be cause for divorce - her daughter's in-laws were expecting a boy. From that point, the camera follows several other women (played by actresses U.S. audiences have never heard of) around the streets of an ostensibly Iranian city, one's story leading into that of the next. Each is trying to do something without the permission or accompaniment of a man or the proper identification papers, such as journey to another city, have an abortion, or travel alone at night by taxi. This makes them outcasts furtively slinking about their business, subject to arrest and imprisonment. Even chewing gum or smoking in public is cause for rebuke by the authorities. Their plight is contrasted with the relative freedom of the males in their society. For these women, there's no joy, or laughter, or any facet of what would otherwise be considered a normal life outside of the Third World. The message is clear - life is wretched for the unmarried and unsupervised woman.
There's no nudity, profanity or violence in THE CIRCLE. Yet, as I understand it, the film was banned in Iran. It's a bleak presentation, and, I'm afraid, perhaps boring if you're not being shown something you don't already know. But, if you're so inclined out of curiosity about the world around you, give it a look, and then give thanks for your great good fortune for living in the US of A - especially if you're a feminist.",1034985600,,1766,4.79344262295082
1657877,4,B00005RRJE,"Iranian movies are truly a challenge for a viewer who is not used to Middle-Eastern cinematography : made with only the basics , with no special effects or soundtrack in most cases , they tell their stories with shocking simplicity and with an anything but polished way . The verdict of what have you seen is based mostly on the essence of the screenplay . The Circle follows various women in Tehran in their effort to runaway , each one of them from something different . Besides telling the tragic tales of these individuals , Panahi manages to make sharp additional comments on Iran's daily reality on the moments you least expect : while one of our female heroes sits at a waiting room at some hospital in the city , a dialogue between two women is being overheard....
- "" She has just been brought in . She's a suicide victim ""
- "" If she survives it will be a huge scandal !... ""
These women are constantly trying to find a saviour in a reality which seems to be able to provide none . As for the meaning of the tittle , a horrific ending scene will give you the answer .",1030233600,5,1077,4.258536585365854
1657878,1,B00005RRJE,"If you are used to American movies, don't be upset with this one. It's a different kind of movie from a culture very different from the one westerners are used to. A lot of this movie was just watching these women, and seeing their sad lives intermingle. If you want to see a good Iranian film, try The Hidden Half or Leila. They were much more interesting.",1028678400,3,357,4.343283582089552
1657879,5,B00005RRJE,"This was one of the best films I have seen all year.  It is beautifully done, very much a work of art in its portrait of the characters and setting.  I expected it to be a political or activist film, making its point in a hard and direct way, but it is instead a darkly beautiful portrait of the ghostly survival of women living on the fringes of an oppressive society (not beautiful in the sense of happy, though- this film is tragic- but so are many of the greatest operas, plays, and works of music.)  Not for the high school dropouts or hollywood action film lovers, though- I didn't find this a difficult film to understand, but clearly some of the reviewers did.  This is not an action film, or one that will entertain you with a simple story & happy ending.  I suppose the people who would like this film are higher than average in patience, intelligence, and experience with alternative film.  More a film for filmmakers or those who appreciate seeing something different from normal film studio fare than for average American audience members.",1026432000,3,1052,4.598930481283422
1657880,5,B00005RRJE,"Movies today, show us things that we have seen a lot of action adventure, suspense, but we are starting to see that outside of our comfort zone there is a whole different world that exists. The Circle Directod Jafar Panahi, gives us a glimpse of what women have to put up and deal with in other parts of the world, like for example where this movie was taken place... In Iran.... I watched this movie for the 3rd time yesterday and I decided to buy the movie.
There is so much behind The Circle that it will leave you amazed every time that you watch this movie, I know it did to me...
If there is one movie that you are buying today make it this one because I know it will be one of the best movies you will ever see. This movie got 4-1/2  stars, and was almost on every Top 10 list for best movies of the year... It also got ""two thumbs up""....
I thought this movie disserved a 5 out 5 and no less.....I hope that you will watch the movie to understand where I am coming from...",1011312000,5,980,4.077720207253886
1657881,4,B00005RRJE,"This Iranian film, is banned in Iran, consists of several intertwining stories of women, all living the sad realities of the circle of life that traps them again and again.  I understand it was filmed at night, in secret, using non-professional actors and smuggled out of Iran for the Venice Film Festival where it won the Golden Lion Award.
The camera is obviously hand held as it follows these non-professional actresses around.  Their faces shine out from their chadors - real, unpretty and blemished.  One of the women has a huge discolored bruise on the her face.  Another woman's face is deeply creased.  There eyes are huge and expressive.  The film begins with a woman's offscreen screams behind the title and credits.  At first I think she is being tortured.  And then there is a cry of a baby and we know she has just given birth.  ""It's a girl"" says the hospital nurse to the grandmother who is immediately saddened.  ""The family will insist on divorce,"" she says.  ""They expected a boy.""  Thus sets the tone of the film which now shifts to three women huddled together in a phone booth desperately trying to call someone who is not at home.  They are worried and afraid as they hide from authorities, especially since one of them gets arrested.  It takes a while for the audience to find out that they have just escaped from prison.  Their stories are never clear.  We don't know what their crimes were.  We don't know much about them at all.  But we do follow them through the city as they try to cope with all the restrictions around them and interact with other women in equally awful circumstances.
Without the proper papers, or without a man by their side, women can't travel.  Certainly they can't raise a child alone.  One woman tries to get an abortion but is turned away because she needs a husband's permission. One woman actually abandons her small daughter on a city street.  The audience sees pieces of stories such as the woman who buys a man's wedding shirt although the audience never finds out what the back story is or who the shirt is for.  And we never get to meet the woman who has borne the child in the first scene.  The city is filmed as a bustling but hostile environment without any hope for these women.  There is no joy in the film.  Only sadness.  And the script seems nonexistent with pieces of conversation that don't seem related to any of the stories.  Everywhere there is misery without one bit of relief for the women or the audience.
I saw this film in a theater and found it extremely difficult to watch.  Indeed, so did other people because many of them just stood up and walked out. Without a specific story to follow, I felt strangely remote from what was happening on the screen.  but perhaps that was the director, Jafar Panahi's intent. The film does work as a political statement but I needed more details in the script to be able to identify with these sad and remote women.  This is obviously a worthwhile film, but it is just too confusing for my tastes.",1004659200,26,3013,4.5464684014869885
7952703,4,B00005RRJE,"Jafar Panahi *steals* from Max Ophuls' LA RONDE and then has the gall to claim he's never seen it in his DVD EXTRA interview. That liar deserves to be thrown in prison!

Ha, ha, just kidding. His story does have the same structure--a series of vignettes with one character peeling off and leading you to the next, leading back to a reprise of the 1st--but these are No Fun stories of the ""joy"" of being a woman in Iran. Many of the characters are prison escapees on the run from the cops, and the atmosphere of clammy, running panic reminded me of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS(!) The chador cleverly serves a dual purpose here: symbol of oppression, but also much needed cover from the pod-like pursuit by the law. Wonderful shot of a fleeing woman whose billowing chador makes her look like a bird in flight. Circles abound visually in Panahi's locations and sets, notably the final shot in a circular prison cell. 7/10",1320364800,,922,4.587878787878788
7952704,5,B00005RRJE,"We have a circle of connected women's stories about life in modern Iran,filmed with great audacity and confidence. Iran is a city of intimidating bustle and restless energy,a city of men trading,hawking,playing music,riding motorbikes,swooping in police vans to arrest people. This circle of women struggle against restrictive male power structures that makes their lives a prison,a patriarchal theocracy,designed to marginalize and crush them. Bullied, intimidated,excluded by male chauvinism and at the mercy of arbitrary rules and ID checks,petrified by rigid dress codes,they dart and hide from passing police cars and policemen. At the start we hear the birth of a baby girl from a prison hospital,striking doom in the mother,whose in-laws will abandon her. Three other women leaving prison have to fend for themselves,They don dark chadors at moments of danger,fearing rearrest,Arezou and Nargess run away looking like huge crows. We are given no back stories,we are uncertain about their fates and plans,this compounds their mystery. Their untold lives formalised in a series of incomplete narratives.

We often find out their names when they have to identify themselves to male authorities:Nargess to be sold a bus ticket,Nayereh when she faces arrest. They can enlarge the circle of restrictions through female solidarity. One wife finds her husband has remarried and gets on with wife 2 because she has looked after her kids. Another,Pari, whose husband was executed 4 months before finds an old prison friend who has married into respectability and can't help her with her abortion. She can't get abortion without a man's permission. She has been cast out by her father and brothers onto the streets. A mother abandons her daughter on the street,unable to support her. She is picked up like a prostitute. Banned in Iran,dealing as it does with prostitution,abortion,family violence,the abandonment of children. What makes it riveting,is the way it depicts women as most deprived,living in a big prison,as if each woman could replace another in a circle. Society is the bigger prison they can't escape from.

Society has them within a circle,which will cost them to get beyond and these characters are trying to get out of. Throughout the film women look out at the world through bars, and windows and doors slam shut; they are forbidden to smoke in public places; they fail to complete their journeys to a place of safety. The spirit,strength and courage of this circle of women cannot be extinguished. We pass from one woman to the next as in a relay race, passing the baton on. If one succeeds they all succeed,if one fails they all fail. Finally,a woman placed in apolice van for soliciting,the sum of all the others who get to the dead end,is allowed to light a cigarette,before she is shut in a cell,along with the others we saw earlier,still trying to escape,completing the circle. Panihi's courage and opposition to the government has seen him imprisoned for 6 years,banned from film making for 20 more years, banned from travelling outside Iran. In this film he has given birth to hope through his art.",1305158400,,3121,5.153846153846154
7952705,2,B00005RRJE,"Say what you want about the regime in Tehran being a bunch of barbaric nincompoops, but they sometimes give the green light to films that make them look like the repressive idiots they are.  This film is a good example.

What I mean is that I was struck by the film's suggestion that the woes of women in Iran do not arise out of Islamic teachings or foreign influence, but rather the strictures of Tehran itself.  But aren't those the same misogynistic louts who allowed this film to be made?",1283990400,,493,4.455555555555556
7952706,5,B00005RRJE,"This movie could be viewed as a political statement (it was banned in Iran) or a purely artistic work.  Either way, it works, and it is Panahi's masterpiece in a filmography that has been dedicated to the disenfranchised (Crimson Gold) and women's secondary status (The Mirror, Offside, The Circle) in Iran.  It should be mentioned that the dvd includes an interview with the director, who makes it a point to mention that some of the Iranian laws depicted here (restriction from traveling with the accompaniment of males) have been abolished since the making of this film.  However, the familiarity with the customs are still intact.

This is a superb piece of work both in craft and emotion.  Beginning in a long circular tracking shot from a hospital window, a family learns a newborn is a girl when they expected a boy.  From here, it moves in a continuous shot out onto the street (Iranian filmmaking tradition is intertwined and indebted to the Russians as the Bolshevik Revolution forced Russian filmmakers to flee to neighboring countries, one of which was Iran. The Russians are famous for their long continuous tracking shots).

A baton relay ""race"" is set up as the story of one disenfranchised woman is passed on to the next.  Three women who have escaped from prison are attempting to move through the city with the least of means.  We go from one to the other, as we learn of their personal histories and events that have led to their present hour of desperation.

Non-professional actors and professionals share the relay.  Nargess Mamizadeh, whom Panahi came across in a park one day, was enlisted to play Nargess (the first girl with the thick handsome eyebrows and black eye).  She's extraordinarily pretty, to the point that Panahi had to ""dress her down"" with an unexplained black eye.  Fereshteh Sadr Orafai  as Pari who searches for a doctor to abort her child (the father was killed in prison and she has no way of providing), and Fatemeh Naghavi as a mother who dresses up and abandons an adorable daughter in hopes someone with better means can take her in, are both professional actors.

Circular motifs and circular settings get reiterated throughout the movie, illustrating an allegory of the vicious circle in a society that puts restrictions on women.  Panahi mentions that his film is an attempt to compress an entire lifetime of a woman into one day, using eight women's circumstances as a conduit.  The movie begins with fast, jittery hand held pacing, and eventually decelerates into stasis, before ending in the same window first shown in a hospital, but now belongs in a prison
cell.

Fatemeh Naghavi's desperate mother and her forlorn five-year old daughter was absolutely heartbreaking to watch.  When I watched the abandoned child crying, something inside me broke, and remained unmendable for weeks.

I never like recommending these types of movies to friends, because I shudder at the thought of them coming back afterwards with a review I see often about The Circle: ""It's depressing.""  Not all films are meant to entertain and make their audience walk out ""feeling good.""  But as much as Dayereh shows the miserable oppression of Iranian women by men, it's inspiring that as an Iranian man himself, Panahi is boldly speaking out for those whose voices have been muted.

I have Middle Eastern friends who often tell me that how they are represented throughout the world is not accurate.  ""We're not all like that.  It's just that the ones who have the loudest voices get heard.""  Panahi's work is a testament and tribute to the sensitivity of Iranian men who are concerned with the injustices dealt to the other half of the human race.",1218585600,2,3677,4.880837359098229
7952707,5,B00005RRJE,"Regardless of their awareness of conditions in the Islamic Republic of Iran, Western viewers will find this portrayal of the lives of four women on the streets of Tehran bleak and disturbing. Knowing is one thing; seeing another. Unmarried and without supportive families, each of them has served time in prison for unspecified offenses -possibly for violating the fundamentalist strictures prescribing and proscribing their behavior.

Director Jafar Panahi uses a documentary style of filmmaking to follow the events of a single day in the lives of the women, often relying on long, long takes captured with handheld camera. Using both professional and nonprofessional actors, he balances a gritty realism against visually lyrical moments played out in settings reflecting the symbolism of the film's title - the circularity of the women's efforts to flee the circumstances of their lives. The DVD includes an interesting interview with Panahi, who claims that he does not watch movies, is unaware of the French film ""La Ronde,"" whose structure his film resembles, and does not make films for an audience, in order to preserve the integrity of his own vision. Essential viewing for anyone concerned with women's rights in the developing world.",1207180800,,1244,5.314720812182741
7952708,5,B00005RRJE,"The circle is a struggling movie; the inner codes that feed the script turn around the lives of three women, oppressed by the masculine universe in a society that overlook with overwhelming indifference, those minor disgraces that may mean nothing for you and me, who live on the other side of the world, but what reflects the aberrant distortion and the abusive repression around the feminine world. Jafar Panahi reminds so much to Mira Nair, the talened Indian filmmaker, in what has to do with this nervous directorial style; cinema verit with the camera moving untiringly, to make us authentic trip' s partner of these unlucky women.

A bold and acidic film that securely will disturb you due we regard unthinkable these things may happen in this Century, but that are part of a way of thinking, feeling and living of certain societies around the world.",1176422400,,857,4.86986301369863
7952709,3,B00005RRJE,"This movie is a congregation of tales, where each tale is like the bead of a necklace, independent in itself and strung to the next bead through a thread, and whence one has traversed the various tales or beads, one finds oneself where one started - thus living out the title of this move

I saw this movie immediately after seeing my first Iranian flick, Hamoun. Thus I came with all expectations, and found myself briefly disappointed, which is not to say that this is a poor movie. Rather, the entire aspect of this movie seems to work towards its title. The characters are well created & are all women, having said that - the director I felt, was overkeen to ensure the cyclic theme's emergence and has in some parts of the movie, not done complete justice to the characters she has created. Thus when the movie hurtles to its closure, one sees the circle emerge and feels a sense of abruptness as the movie ends.

For those interested in checking it out, remember that this is a slow slow movie with little conversation, and well defined characters.",1149292800,2,1054,4.571428571428571
7952710,5,B00005RRJE,"This is an importnat and timely film, perhaps even more so now as Iran perepares for another crucial election in which moderate clerics will have to struggle against the conservative establishment, which refuses to note the calls for reform form the people. This film offers a valuable examinations of the current social and political situation in Iran. There was widespread hope that under President Khatami, Iran could have taken a more liberal course shedding by the wayside the conservative positions adopted by previous governments of the Islamic Republic.  This has also been reflected in the emerging and highly acclaimed film industry, which despite its success, has tended to shun political themes.  However, some signs of change are ther for those who observe carefully.  In the case of Jafar Panahi's ""The Circle"" the political allusions are evident from the title, which serves as a metaphor for the narrative and for what Khatami's politics have so far meant to Iranians who had hoped for change, in other words their hopes have been invain.",1074902400,3,1054,5.152046783625731
7952711,1,B00005RRJE,"A time waster! If you are completely oblivious to the lack of women's rights in the Middle East, then you may find this an interesting documentary.

7952712,5,B00005RRJE,"This is a harsh film made up of several fractured stories that eventually come all together in showing the life at the fringes of the Iranian society. It's about women, as ever culpable gender, walking the dreary space they could carve around, and temporarily away from, the LAW. These women's short lives on screen, though different, have a lot in common in their moth-like gyrations. Additionally noteworthy are the few powerful sketches of men as accomplices, LAW enforcers, women abusers, LAW distorters (i.e. 'law' abiders). The viewer's rage is well controlled; all the tragic becomes chronic sadness. Iranian expats' opinions would be more than welcome! Just above mediocre transfer on DVD.",1065139200,7,697,5.288288288288288
