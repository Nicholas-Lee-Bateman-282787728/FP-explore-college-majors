8704690,3,B00U8CIXS6,"The picture quality is mediocre.  Similar to a vhs tape recorded in 6 hour mode instead of 2 hour mode.  Meaning the crowd at City Stadium and the often the players were indistinct.  I expected b&w, but was disappointed in the poor picture quality.  Adequate.  If your expectations are low you won't be disappointed.  On the plus side every play seemed to be here.  Sound was adequate.  This was Lombardi's 1st NFL championship, the 61 squad.",1484006400,,442,4.723684210526316

Sure it wasn't great, but for something transferred to modern media that is 54 years old, it was really worth the buy.",1435363200,2,263,4.326530612244898
