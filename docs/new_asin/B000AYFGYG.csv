8080758,5,B000AYFGYG,I think I've already written a review on this TV show in the past. I just love the creativity and the adult content of it mixed with puppetry. I just thought it was so original and so refreshing and so offbeat.,1501200000,,210,4.146341463414634

8080760,5,B000AYFGYG,"I'm going to echo everything I said about the Season 1 dvd.

 I'm convinced that it's one of the greatest comedy series of any genre on broadcast television.  Top notch writing, acting and directing.

Just to give you a sense of my comedic sensibilities I would also put Strangers with Candy and The League of Gentlemen in this realm as well.  If you like dark dark comedy - you can't go wrong with this series.

The best of Season 3 + Season 4 are getting released this January as a 2 disc set.  That series features some of the best episodes in the series.",1290211200,,558,4.3076923076923075
8080761,4,B000AYFGYG,"A halfway house for puppets who have been found guilty of various crimes, including murder. It is run by a man who lacks morales and ethics and who isn't too bright. Sex robbery, extorsion, and murder happen in a tongue-in-cheek manner. As immoral as the show is, I find myself laughing at the situations and rapport and discord. If you enjoy murder mysteries checkout The Stolen Concept.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Stolen-Concept/dp/1424153530/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Stolen Concept</a>",1229040000,,540,6.513888888888889
8080762,5,B000AYFGYG,"Puppets Who Kill is one of the greatest series to hit Canadian television.  We were on a trip when we caught it on television.  We looked it up and found season 1 & 2.  If you like TV shows like South Park, or The Family Guy, you are right in step to like this one as well.  It is irreverent, sadistic, and really off color, and I loved every minute of it.  Must see for everyone over 18.",1176163200,,388,3.923076923076923
8080763,2,B000AYFGYG,"I got season one from a friend as a gift and loved it.  I bought season two and was pretty dissappointed.  The show just became vulgar and sacrificed the hilarity of season one.  I loved the ideas for episodes, but didn't care much for how they played out.  Bill got soft.  Cuddles and Dan got mean.  Buttons and Rocko stayed about the same, but it wasn't enough.  Great show, but stick with season one.",1174262400,,403,4.364864864864865
8080764,5,B000AYFGYG,"PWK is a show that is simultaneously hilarious, dark, sweet and intelligent.  Imagine the writers of Larry Sanders' penning Greg the Bunny.  A cult hit up in Canada, but will likely be too droll to ever air on US TV.",1164067200,2,216,4.375
8080765,4,B000AYFGYG,"The second year of PWK really pushes the envelope with story lines that surprised even my twisted little mind... and that's saying a lot!  The situations in the second year go to much darker places, while still maintaining it's great humor.  Though I like all of the characters, Bill is my favorite... just show me his grimmacing smile and it sets me laughing.  If you liked the first year... you're gonna love the second year!",1156032000,2,427,4.666666666666667
