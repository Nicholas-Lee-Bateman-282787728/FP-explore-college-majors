3669667,5,B001KVY41O,"I ordered a copy of this movie from amazon, and I was a little skeptical, since a lot of people have had issues with the blu-ray playing. I popped it in my PS3 and it worked right away. The video is absolutely amazing, as is the cinematography. Loved the soundtrack as well. Highly recommended.",1233014400,,294,4.462962962962963

3669669,4,B001KVY41O,I bought this disc from Amazon on 1/18/09 and it's working fine. No playback problems at all. Looks like fixed versions are out being circulated. The video quality of this title is just outstanding. Could easily be used for demo material on a HD display. The film itself is pretty darn good too. Music choices were decent. Recommended overall.,1232668800,,343,4.830508474576271
3669670,1,B001KVY41O,"i ordered that's it that's all on blu ray for my husband for christmas, and after waiting way too long (and paying extra for expedited shipping :/), it finally arrived on january 2. after all the excitement (we've already seen the dvd, just not on blu ray), the disc proceeded to freeze up our ps3 and then do the same on our brand new blu ray player. when i contacted amazon to exchange for a new one, they informed me that it is no longer available through them.",1231545600,,464,4.284090909090909
3669671,5,B001KVY41O,"I've heard of all the defects and issues with the Blu-rays.  Let me tell you that not all of the copies out there are defective.  I've been told that only 1-10% are defective.

Anyways, I received my non-defective copy from SportsFlicks, and once I started watching, I couldn't get my mouth to shut.  I've watched many snowboarding films, and this is just amazing.  The amount of work that they must have put into the creation of this documentary has to be unimaginable.  It gets even better on Blu-ray.  The picture is so clear that you can see every little detail.  The sound is okay, it's only normal Dolby Digital (no HD audio here) and it suits the film well enough.",1231545600,,671,4.533333333333333
3669672,1,B001KVY41O,"Got this from my wife for X-mas. Couldn't wait to watch it; and then, nothing... This disc doesn't work in my PS3, but not sure about other Blu-Ray players as I don't own one. I checked all over the web for ""known-issues"" and nothing. Finally, I found a Facebook for the disc and ppl on there complained as well. Then today, I go back to the Facebook profile to check the comments again and this comment was left by ""That's It, That's All""  - ""If your Blu-ray copy doesn't play, please contact the store you bought the Blu-ray from to return it. Thanks""

So... no word on the official website of this issue and it looks like they know about it. Way not Cool! They don't even say if they have fixed the issue or what? Guess I should just waste more shipping money and take a chance. What a JOKE?!?",1231027200,2,796,4.264900662251655
3669673,1,B001KVY41O,"After months of waiting for the Blu-ray version of That's It, That's All to be released, I was excited to finally find it in stock and at a decent price.  I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend.  I even paid extra for quicker shipping, to ensure delivery by Christmas.  My boyfried has been waiting months for this to be released on Blu-ray so he was very excited to receive this.  He invited his entire family over so that we could all watch it on our PS3.  We inserted the disc and nothing happened.  We tried everything we could think of, we power cycled the PS3, we upgraded the software, we removed the disc and tried to load it again.  Nothing would get the disc to be recognized by the PS3.  We tried other Blu-ray discs that we had and they all loaded normally and played the movies.  We finally gave up.  The whole situation was pretty disappointing.  The next day we took the disc to a friend that also had a Blu-ray player (not a PS3) and the same thing happened.  The disc actually caused the friend's player to freeze.  Now Amazon is out of stock and we are back to trying to find a Blu-ray version of this in stock, and hoping we will get a disc that works this time.",1230940800,,1194,4.253333333333333
3669674,1,B001KVY41O,i watched this movie at one of the LA Premier's and it was amazing. This is one of the best movies of 2008/2009. However i am very disappointed because i bought it and it won't play on my ps3 !!!,1230854400,,195,3.9
3669675,5,B001KVY41O,"if you are a snowboarder, you'll first cry your eyes out and then will put your boots and bindings on and then will jump off your friggin' roof regardless of there's snow or not!!!!! if you're not a snowboarder, you'll first go get a snowboard and then will jump off your roof!

3669746,5,B001KVY41O,"I adore this film, the talent, and the production quality. The photography is amazing, the quality of the picture, the soundtrack, just good stuff all around. If your looking for a good blu-ray, and you like snowboarding this a great option.",1365552000,,241,4.902439024390244
3669747,5,B001KVY41O,Travis Rice is the best and this video proves it. Love the sound track and the videography.  A must have for snowboard fans.,1365552000,,124,4.391304347826087
3669748,5,B001KVY41O,As a snowboarder I greatly enjoyed watching this movie. The visuals were remarkable and the best thing is this movie isn't overly long and it is a movie you can always go back to and watch multiple times without it getting old.,1357948800,,227,4.428571428571429
3669749,5,B001KVY41O,"This is a Great snowboarding film, awesome cinimaphotography!! Get pumped for the season with this film.. There is a Great soundtrack as well.. Can't go wrong",1357862400,,158,5.115384615384615
3669750,5,B001KVY41O,"This video is amazing and if you get it on blu-ray, wich is the best way to watch it if you have a blu-ray player, the detail is just spectacular. They shot pretty much the whole movie in ultra high definition so the clarity is like you are there. Shooting this way also allows them to play in super slow mode without distorting the image quality which makes for some epic footage. Travis Rice and his fellow riders are insane. The tricks they pull are out of this word. This is by far the best snowboard video I have ever seen. I've watched it over and over and still haven't got tired of it. If your a snowboarder or just like watching snowboard movies this is a must. Even if your not that into snowboarding you'll still probably like this movie. Its that good.",1316908800,,764,4.3125
3669751,5,B001KVY41O,This is an amazing film!!!  Worth every penny!! The cinematography is outstanding and the riding is extreme and totally sick!!!  Can't wait till Flight comes out.,1302566400,,162,5.1923076923076925
3669752,4,B001KVY41O,"I was a little skeptical about the documentary style format of the film.  However after watching, I enjoyed it very much.  The actual snowboarding in the video is amazing.  All backcountry.  Very different than the material that makes up a bulk of most videoes (rails/park).

As far as the quality of footage goes, it's the first blu-ray snowboarding vid i've purchased and it was A+.  Looks fantastic on my hi-def tv.  Highly recommended. still getting through some of the bonus features.",1299456000,,489,4.962962962962963
3669753,5,B001KVY41O,"I ordered this video for my son about 10 days before Christmas.  There was a warning that it might not arrive in time, but it arrived in plenty of time.  It was also the least expensive website of all places online and in stores that I checked.  Brand new.  Very pleased.",1294876800,,271,4.254901960784314
3669754,5,B001KVY41O,"I'm not going to harp on and on about this ground-breaking snowboarding DVD because there is really too much to praise. Great soundtrack, killer cinematography, a stellar cast of boarders, pitch-perfect editing, mile after mile of gorgeous camera work, and replay value coming out the wazoo. A must-buy for snowphiles.",1294617600,,318,5.38
3669755,5,B001KVY41O,If you enjoy snowboarding movies then this one is a must see!! Some very stunning visuals from the scenery and amazing talent from the riders.,1292198400,,142,4.72
3669826,5,B001KVY41O,"Wow... I did not even snowboard at the point that I saw this film. From the opening credits, all the way until the end, my eyes were glued to the screen like a kid in a candy store. This was better than a candy store though.

HD filming at its finest, the scenery is luscious, the action shots are truly superb, the editing is thoughtful and seamless. And on top of it all, the soundtrack builds slowly like a crescendo and makes you want to leave the movie on repeat in the background of whatever party you are throwing. This movie far surpasses any prior ski/snowboard, snow- porn film ever made, in every way possible.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/That-s-It-That-s-All-Snowboard-Blu-Ray-Disc/dp/B002SFYG3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">That's It That's All Snowboard Blu-Ray Disc</a>",1287619200,2,829,5.685483870967742

3669829,5,B001KVY41O,Great Purchase if you love snowboarding movies. This is the cheapest and one of the top buys of a must have in this sport. The shots alone are fantastic! The DVD brings you on a trip across a few spots but delivers some nice tricks and the camera work I cant stress enough. Really great DVD!,1278633600,,291,4.214285714285714
3669830,5,B001KVY41O,Nothing else to add. This is the best snowboarding movie that I have ever seen.,1269907200,,79,4.333333333333333
3669831,5,B001KVY41O,"I have seen a lot of videos over the years and this was is by far the craziest! Beautiful scenery, insane avalanche scene and mountain and huge big air tricks. This movie is actually worth more than what they are asking. I relate this to Planet Earth on Blu ray. It's a long movie and not the standard short movies where you kind of feel robbed. In my opinion whoever filmed this should start filming other sports films that are progressive like this one is. BUY THIS MOVIE!!",1267401600,,475,4.409090909090909
3669832,1,B001KVY41O,"This is an awesome video, but on blu ray it just didn't work. It's a shame too because this would be amazing in HD",1266364800,,114,3.7916666666666665
3669833,5,B001KVY41O,"I bought this for my daughter as a present for her 18th birthday -- a pleasant surprise for her since she had wanted it for some time. We sat down to watch it together, with me figuring that it was just going to be a boring documentary. Was I ever wrong!  We don't have HDTV but the cinematography was amazing even on our basic TV. Nevertheless, we just had to see it in HD so we went to my sister's house and watched it there. We were all blown away by this documentary. As a bonus, Travis Rice and crew are so funny. We will watch this again and again -- and I'm not one for watching any film more than once. Rice was trying to get across why he and his fellow serious snowboarders love the sport so much -- it's about much more than the sport. He succeeds, and that's an understatement.",1265328000,,789,4.123376623376624
3669834,5,B001KVY41O,"This is a fantastic snowboarding video. The the best description I can think of is Planet Earth on steroids. The scope of the visuals is mind blowing and the scenery alone could have merited an individual film. Oh yeah, and the riding was good too. Certain tricks involving the tops of spruce trees should not be humanly possible. Overall great riding, filming and soundtrack.",1264982400,,376,4.890625
3669835,1,B001KVY41O,"Got this last week, does not read the disc on my Blu-Ray player. Updated the firmware to 007, tried the trouble shooting tips to no avail. Sick movie, especially because its on BD, but it would be nice if it worked!!!",1264291200,,217,4.317073170731708
3669906,5,B001KVY41O,Great Vid! probably my favorite snowboarding vid i ever seen!!! looks great on my 46inch HD and works perfectly fine on my PS3. if you like snowboarding and have a HD tv this is a must BUY :),1262822400,,191,4.052631578947368

3669910,5,B001KVY41O,"By far the best snowboarding movie I have ever seen. Incredible shots. It is basically Planet Earth meets snowboarding. Also, the music is actually good, which is usually a big problem with snowboarding movies. I highly recommend this movie, I have watched it at least twice a week since I got it. It is just too good. Travis Rice is the future of snowboarding. Some of the tricks he pulls I have never seen, and I don't even know how to describe them. Also, the scene with him, Nicolas Muller, and Terje Haakonsen is insane.  I didn't have any of the problems with the blu-ray that other reviewers mentioned. I can not say anything but good things about this movie. A MUST PURCHASE FOR ANY SNOWBOARDER.",1256688000,,703,4.579365079365079
3669911,5,B001KVY41O,"This Film combines a truely amazing soundtrack with visually stunning scenery. Even if you're not a snowboarder, this film is a must see for anyone who appreciates documentary film-making. Travis Rice has created something special. This is five star excellence!

3669913,1,B001KVY41O,"I ordered this as a gift for someone and it does not work.  I have tried it on several DVD players and several computers.  I wish the seller had been more specific in advising which devises currently support Blu-Ray, especially if it is only a select few.",1253750400,,255,4.404255319148936
3669914,5,B001KVY41O,"Being that I have not seen much snowboarding videos, I cant comment on its content as I don't know what to compare it to. But I will say that the visuals on Bluray is SUPERB. Some scenes are just so mindblowing that your mind may think its actually a painting rather than real. For ~$20, I would say its well worth it.",1252281600,,318,4.145161290322581
3669915,1,B001KVY41O,"I bought this blu-ray and have the same issues as those who rated this 1 star.  The blu-ray can play on the PS3 but it will skip all over the first 10-15 minutes of the movie.  I have tried playback on my blu-ray laptop as well with the same results, so this is not a ps3 isolated issue.  It's really a shame because this movie is absolutely beautiful to watch (the movie did have a budget of $2 million afterall). If you're looking to buy this movie, I would advise against buying the blu-ray version until they hopefully fix it in their next disc run.  (I bought this recently from Amazon, August 2009)  The dvd version has no issues.",1249862400,,636,4.310924369747899
3669946,5,B001KVY41O,"Although not 100% in HD you can understand why no one would sponsor a high quality HD camera for them to tote around while hucking them selves through the air...

3669948,4,B001KVY41O,"The snowboard video ""Thats it, Thats all"" is a great, unique film unlike any I've seen yet. This incorporates the thrill of snowboarding with the beauty of nature and the inspiration of music. It is not your typical contemporary music bust out with high action scenes. There is plenty of huge air, deep powder, and hair raising drops. But it comes at a more inspirational perspective. I liked it a lot.",1241913600,,402,4.676056338028169

3669952,5,B001KVY41O,"First off, this film is just EPIC! During the Jackson Hole segment, Travis Rice does a double backflip into a 540 Indie! The PQ and AQ are phenomenal!

And those others rating this as 1 star, please stop. Just because you received a defective copy does not mean you rate this as a low star. The rating system is for the movie quality, not compatability/defective issues!",1234483200,,370,4.606060606060606
3669953,5,B001KVY41O,"While I was a little bit skeptical on purchasing this after reading all the negative reviews about compatibility issues on the PS3, I decided to take the risk after confirming Amazon's return policy and hearing about how awesome this video was. The disc I received worked fine on my PS3 and looks absolutely amazing. This is an epic snowboarding film full of back country, powder-shredding goodness. Park rats beware: there are absolutely no rails in this movie, it's all about big drops, big air and powder. The cinematography here is top notch and the blu-ray transfer looked flawless on my widescreen. This is something people who don't even appreciate snowboarding can get into. The only drag here is that there is too much Travis Rice and not much diversity in the lineup of riders. But hey, it's his movie! Jeremy Jones actually steals the show in a mind-blowing sequence that ends with him busting his face and your jaw dropping in amazement.  Another quip I have is the music is too slooooww. While it works for some parts it's definitely snooze-inducing towards the end. More Exodus, please! All in all a sick video, definitely up there with some of the best and worth buying even just to show off your blu-ray/hdtv setup.",1234137600,6,1231,4.806603773584905
