3632068,5,B001HN68ZU,"I saw this when it premiered, and even though I have been married almost 30 years, I recognized so much that is true of marriages of any length.  The movie is funny, inspiring, heartbreaking, and so well done it's impossible to believe that a CHURCH could have produced it  -- although I've seen the other films produced by this church and I would run, not walk, to get to see or buy any of them.  I'm going to pre-order 5 copies: 1 for us, and 4 for each of my children.",1223856000,13,471,4.153846153846154
3632069,5,B001HN68ZU,"This review is based on viewing the movie FIREPROOF, which had a profound effect on my thinking.

Suppose you are working for the fire department in your city and in the middle of a house fire your partner abandons you.  He has decided to leave you  possibly to burn while he decides to look for a possible victim in the house and perform heroics.  Although he is a mere rookie, he has the audacity to forsake you and all his training.  He does not realize the serious nature of the fire.  What do you do?  He has abandoned his partner.  Such action is inexcusable.

Back at the fire station, your supervisor lets you know that you will not abandon him.  You will work with him, learn to value him, and fight fires with him.  Your relationship will become fireproof.

What about your marriage?  Will  you abandon your partner?  Is it possible to make the most unlikely marital partnership fireproof?  Is there a chance some of the problem could be your fault?

Are you a woman finding it impossible to compete with pornography and fancy boats?  Are you a man unable to compete with a more successful man your wife is flirting with at work?

Is God the Leader of your marriage?  Have you talked to him about it?

That's what FIREPROOF is about.  One more thing:  Kirk Cameron acted magnificently.",1223596800,11,1295,4.534782608695652

3632847,5,B001HN68ZU,I do not understand the negative reviews. I do agree that the actress was not great but its a good video. It is not forcing religion on you. It's showing a couple in crisis and a way to help save a marriage. It goes through the different daily tasks in the dare. There are funny parts but is meant to be serious. Kirk Cameron was very good in his role. I have seen this movie every time on tv and now on DVD. I do think all couples should watch this movie..even if their marriages are great because it just reminds you that little things like a simple hug or flowers can mean a lot. It's the thought and meaning behind the act and not the price that can mean so much sometimes.,1508284800,,677,4.097744360902255

The acting is not stellar, or the writing (""You keep looking at trash on the internet!""  - just say it, lady...you mean porn.).

I personally think that Fireproof is good quality, but if it doesn't meet your standards, then you should watch War Room.

My husband and I really did enjoy this film. In today's disposable world, this movie has a clear message of hope, God's direction, and fighting to keep your marriage alive and well. In today's world everything is of the physical and not so much about God's principles. This movie delves into love, the meanings of marriage, virtue, principles, love, honor and even temptation.  This movie gives clear direction about patience, and loving one another. It is a Christian movie which I don't mind and rather enjoy. The film isn't one of the expensive Hollywood thrillers, but instead depends more on acting and the story line of the movie. I thought Kirk Cameron did a fine job of expressing his anger and resentment of his wife, and also his strength in not letting go of his wife too easily, once he realized the mistakes he had made. Once he's had a change of heart, His love for her is clear and resolute and good eventually wins her over in this film. The female lead did a good job of acting as a cold, but hurt and had enough wife. Her eventual softening and happiness was beautiful.  My husband and I both teared up and had an emotional reaction to the film. We truly enjoyed it.",1481328000,10,1320,5.045871559633028

3636742,1,B001HN68ZU,"Cannot believe this movie has such a high rating. I sometimes watch Christian movies for fun, although I'm not Christian. I've noticed that everything starring Kirk Cameron he is mainly just trying to push that Jesus/Christianity is great at the sacrifice of telling a good story. I'm sure there's a way to do both. I think people who are Christians are rating the movie high on the basis that is is echoing their beliefs, but not rating the movie itself. The plot of the movie, which supposed to be most developed part, was weak and the story telling around it did not give it much support. I see this on a lot of Christian movies. Christians deserves a good quality movie. Come on Kirk!",1468022400,2,688,4.556451612903226

I didn't see how a movie could accomplish anything, but I decided to humor her and give it a try. Boy am I glad I did! This movie was so powerful, so moving, and so realistically written that I could relate to both the husband and the wife (for different reasons obviously) and it pulled me into the story to the point where I was wondering how things would turn out for them. As the story unfolded, it made me cry and I don't mean a few years shed either. I went to bed thinking about the message this movie tried - and succeeded - to get across and I even wished the Love Dare was real so I could try it myself (it is real by the way and can be bought on Amazon). It's extremely powerful and I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is struggling in their relationship.

3638726,1,B001HN68ZU,"Good movie in general but i gave it a one star because, from my perspective, the acceptance of Christ into one's life was almost forced upon the troubled husband due to the constant offer of accepting Christ as a savior by his father every time an advise or a possible solution was asked. Also, the movie plot uses marriage counseling methods used by psychologists but such methods are presented as Christian faith approaches which at the end produce the miracle of saving the marriage. From a Christian perspective this movie can be rated with 5 stars but if you are open minded, as myself, this movie is very questionable due to the only faith approach shown as the most likely solution to save a broken marriage.",1456876800,3,715,4.682539682539683

Ephesians 5:1-2, 21-33

Follow Gods example, therefore, as dearly loved children  and walk in the way of love, just as Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.

Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.

Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, His body, of which He is the Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.

Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her to Himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church for we are members of His body.

For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh. This is a profound mysterybut I am talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.",1456185600,2,1560,4.303754266211604

3638856,5,B001HN68ZU,"Is your marriage considered fireproof?Well,we have this Christian movie with some suggestions to have it characterized as such.

The Kendrick Brothers - Alex and Stephen -released this Christian film entitled ""Fireproof"".It stars Kirk Cameron and Erin Bethea. It tells the story of a couple - Caleb and Catherine - who are at the brink of separation and divorce after constant arguments and fighting that have characterized their marriage. Caleb,a fireman by profession,decided to save their marriage and give it chance to survive once more time with a Christian-based experiment known as ""Love Dare"" coming from his religious father. Will the marriage survive?

Well,I think that I should have not asked that question considering that the viewer knows the answer to that when Caleb was in Day 1 of his 40-day experiment. Although it was only Caleb who seemed interested in saving the marriage which I felt wasn't really good in the plot and it was obviously a Christian movie which will definitely turn off viewers who are non-believers,I think that the movie did well in its presentation of how to save a marriage that is about to break. We get to see the sincerity of Caleb's sincerity in giving it another try. Also,I admire the determination he showed. The Christian viewer will definitely see how God was working on him to help save the marriage that probably has no chance whatsoever to hang on considering that Catherine is already looking forward to signing the papers and a relationship with a doctor/co-worker named Gavin. There truly is nothing impossible for the Lord our God especially when it is in His will for the marriage to survive.

This Christian movie will definitely inspire young couples to have a strong marriage and to have the Lord involved in it through prayer and scripture reading.",1455840000,,1811,5.009966777408638

3639210,5,B001HN68ZU,"Released in 2008, Fireproof is an inspirational drama about a couple from Georgia whose marriage is on the rocks. The husband, Caleb (Kirk Cameron), is a fireman with a hot temper and an addiction to internet porn whereas the wife, Catherine (Erin Bethea), is stressed due to her mothers medical issues and falling under the spell of a morally dubious doctor at work (Perry Revell). With divorce looming, Calebs dad (Harris Malcom) encourages Caleb to hold off on divorce proceedings for 40 days with a love dare procedure.

This is a compelling drama and genuinely inspirational to boot; it entertains while also inspiring without getting too preachy or heavy-handed, although some might argue that the endings too sappy. Unless you're a devout atheist, you should enjoy Fireproof if you favor spiritual dramas akin to 1991s Grand Canyon. But I encourage atheists to check it out too since it provides some food for thought. Its similar in tone and theme to 2010s Cutback and 2015s War Room, although it has a bigger budget than the former and less than the latter. It only cost half a million to make (whereas War Room cost $3 million) and this explains some of the dubious acting of peripheral cast members, like the doctor, which is one of only a couple reasons I rate the film as I do. Nevertheless, this is a potent drama and even potentially life-changing. The situations are thoroughly realistic and I could relate to them all, whether through my own experiences or those of people I know. Fireproof had a very positive impact on me, like the two aforementioned movies.

The film runs 118 minutes and was shot in Albany, Georgia.

Not good.
I expected fireman's hero movie with lovestory behind.
This movie was more concentrated in god's power as well as family love.
I believe in god but honestly don't want to hear anything about teaching how great the god's will and all. I was not prepared for that before watching this film.

This movie concentrates the main plot in believe in god. That solves the problem between husband and wife's problem.
Above all the way they solve the problem looked too cheezy too. Very cheezy that I almost about to shut down the dvd.

I really didn't enjoyed it.
It's like going to a class that I don't want to participate for 2 hours and sit there forcibly and I have no choice but to listen to the address that I already know.",1449705600,2,813,4.413333333333333

The movie has decent production value and a somewhat contrived plot with pretty average performances, but I still recommend it for married couples interested in doing The Love Dare book challenge together.

As a standalone entertainment piece, it is a bit lacking, but done in conjunction with the book's activities, or to kick off the 40 days, it definitely helps you and your spouse get into the proper frame of mind.",1444953600,,547,4.808510638297872
3639863,5,B001HN68ZU,Fireproof with Kirk Cameron is one of many strong roles he plays questioning his faith.  In real life he is a strong Christian so it is wonderful to see that he can show the side he once had before becoming a Christian.  A strugging husband caught up in a world of pronography and a demanding job of a fire fighter.  His father hands him a journal that will change his life forever.  The message his dad spoke of his own life and that of Christ in this movie changed my life.  The sound track is so beautiful.  I can't begin to tell you how many times I have watched this moving when I am struggling in my walk with God and every time I walk away with a compeletly new message.  Wonderful message and cast directeed for all ages.  To me a must own movie to add to your collection.,1444780800,,780,4.153333333333333

The actors worked hard to bring the message to life and I truly appreciate their efforts to bring this movie to pass. I think it was wonderful and I get the whole point of it all. Sometimes people can miss it and get distracted by the imperfections of the roles played in the movie. It is a faith based film by the Kendrick brothers who are lead to promote redemption, healing, unity, love, faith, forgiveness and second chances.

3640030,5,B001HN68ZU,"After watching the amazing movie ""War Room."" A friend of mine recommended this movie.

And I am glad he did, praise God!

It has the same theme as ""War Room"" and is expected (same director for both movies).

This movie is extremely powerful and unravels how marriage is sacred and must be fought for.  Caleb, a firefighter, is a selfish, prideful husband who thinks that working hard at his career is enough for their marriage.  Catherine is a beautiful, soft-spoken woman who desire Caleb's love in the household.  These two have clashing views of how their marriage is supposed to work.  It all goes downhill after a big argument and sets the path for Caleb's journey.

When we marry, we make a promise to love the other person through the good times and the bad.

This movie definitely shows the ""bad"" of their marriage for most of the movie.

The perseverance and prayer to allow Christ into their lives helps their lives in enlightening ways.

I can say this movie made me tear up.  I felt so enlightened after this movie. I gave my family a call and told them how much I love them.

Please go watch this movie with an open heart if your a non-believer.  And if your a Christian, well brothers and sisters, this movie will help strengthen your faith.

5/5. I will be watching this again after my 12 hour shift! (I can't wait).",1443830400,,1331,4.510460251046025

This movie strains the boundries of suspention of disbelief, much as a bad horror movie would.

If you are looking for the self-esteem building that knowing you are not one of the few still holding onto beliefs that are not in touch with the truth of the universe then this movie will give you that.  If you are looking for a quality movie that will leave you feeling like you escaped into another realistic story that drew you in with it's touch with reality, then unfortunately you will be sadly dissapointed with this one.

It is a 50-50 marriage and if both parties are not committed to doing their 50 % it will be hard to make it very long through the ups and downs of life.  My Husband and I are coming up on our 48th Wedding ANIV in Oct. I hope everyone that sees this movie will make it that far down the road of life together. We have had our ups and downs just like everyone else, but we both knew we still loved each other. And kept working out the kinks on a daily basis.

3640287,5,B001HN68ZU,"I really enjoyed this movie.  There is a good, solid Christian message in there-even though my 34-year marriage is great, this movie made me pause and think about it, and how I could make it even better.  There were some intense, nail-biting action scenes which made the movie even more enjoyable.  On top of all that, it has Kirk Cameron in it-I just love him and think he is a terrific actor.  It really impresses me that he sticks to his faith and stars in Christian movies instead of going the Hollywood route and taking anything he can for exposure to the public.  If you are addicted to the Hollywood blockbusters with outlandish plots, you may not enjoy this.  But if you are looking for a solid, faith-based, down-to-earth movie, please watch this-I highly recommend it!!",1440979200,5,779,4.6911764705882355

Also the book The Love Dare which was featured in the movie is excellent.

3640448,1,B001HN68ZU,"Troubled marriages don't have a chance with this kind of help film.  I don't like seeing constant hollywood films place the woman on a pedestal and point the blame on the man.  This film starts out with a little girls voice saying she wants to marry a fireman like her daddy.  Dads today spoil their daughters rotten by getting them everything they want and telling them not to settle for anything less because they are a princess. So the princess grows up thinking she's a queen and should be constantly served by the servant husband. The wife becomes upset because she can't get the unconditional yes to all my wants and princess treatment her dad gave her and her dad didn't ask for sex too. So the wife blames her husband for her disappointment and files for divorce. Two thirds of divorce are filed by women...Watch the documentary ... Divorce Corp...for a inside scoop.  So in the movie the wife has an emotional affair with a doctor and the movie places all the blame on the husband and his porn viewing...Did you know that no where in the bible does it say masturbation is a sin? and no where in the Bible does it say a unmarried man and woman living together is a sexual sin..in fact Mary and Joseph were NOT MARRIED when Jesus was born.... So in real life, would a woman choose a fireman over a doctor? I think very few material queens would but lets not blame the woman's selfishness of trying to upgrade to a doctor that makes more money...lets blame the husband because he has physical needs and deals with them by porn.  A virtuous woman in the Bible listens and supports her mother in law...Read the Bible book Ruth...A virtuous woman honors and obeys her parents ...Read the Bible book Esther.  A wicked woman paints her face and manipulates her husband which is what Jezebel did 2 Kings 9:30 and 1 Kings 21:25  So this movie has nothing to do with Bible representation but it falsely claims it does.  Read your KJV bible if you want the truth on how relationships should be.  A man is to love a woman as his own body and a woman is to SUBMIT to her husband.",1436659200,2,2074,4.436842105263158

Needless to say, my wife and I shed tears as we saw in Kirk Cameron's character our own dear family member.

3640802,1,B001HN68ZU,"There are so many things wrong with this movie I don't even know where to begin. The acting is SO bad. The situations are completely unrealistic. But most of all, the movie's ""messages"" make me sick. Let's recap those, shall we:
1. A woman can only find true happiness by being married to a good man who loves her.
2. No matter how messed up your marriage is you should stay married. After all, a 40-day Love Dare will fix whatever problems you have.
3. The only way to live a happy, successful life is to accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior.

So yeah: religious brain-washing at its finest.

And for the record: no I'm not some angry atheist who hates everything to do with religion. I'm not saying you shouldn't try to fix your marriage, but some people just don't belong together. If all else fails and you're both miserable, it's not helping anyone by staying together. Get divorced, move on with your life, find someone else, and die happy.

Now... you know how I saw this movie? I babysit a kid whose parents only allow him to watch crap like this. His perception of relationships and people who aren't Christian are already so perverted by things like this that he's never going to be able to see the world that is in front of him. At this point he's so far gone that his mind will never be open to new possibilities, and if he does find himself in a bad relationship he'll stay in it no matter what because that's what God wants. I read his Christian Science textbook and I'm not going to lie: THAT level of misinformation that people HERE in AMERICA are feeding to their children is criminally negligent. And that makes me SO angry. Have whatever faith you want, but when you're willfully filling your child's head with lies that's wrong. BUT I digress.

Movie = Terrible. Don't watch it. If you have it, burn it. See how ""Fireproof"" it is *snicker*",1428451200,4,1866,4.463343108504398

I thought the husband was a real jerk, and found his personal arc a bit difficult to follow.  However, the character of the wife was very believable, and her hurt was real.  There is a good message of hope for any couple that is willing to invest effort to make a marriage work, and it does take work.",1427760000,,462,4.157303370786517

3640900,4,B001HN68ZU,"Now don't get me wrong, this movie definitely has some major ""cheese"" factor to it, but the underlying message and core issues it brings to light with marriage are hugely important and often not talked about in our ""me, me, now!"" society. It shows a lot of the typical routines and situations the average person can find themselves in as opposed to the often fairytale, fluffy stories in many fictional romances depicted by Hollywood. I believe one of the most helpful things the movie shows is that marriage may have its bumpy patches, but what you gain in the end/totality of a lifetime together is worth more than giving up and jumping to the next person that is probably equally as flawed. Now there are certainly situations where a partner isn't safe to stay with, or has no intention of changing incredibly destructive habits which would be intolerable and unfixable. However, the point of this movie is that many people have a decent spouse, and they need to carry through and make things better together instead of separately. As a now 30yr old with parents that divorced in my tween aged years, I can attest that the some of the damage from a divorce never completely goes away for the entire family (I have a case of parents that in the end have admitted individually years later they probably should have stayed together, but one parent remarried too soon). So giving a case for holding on to a commitment and putting someone else first I think makes this movie one with a good message to consider.",1426032000,10,1509,4.676691729323308

3640918,4,B001HN68ZU,"Now one of my favorite movies, since it focuses me toward the minimum standards for being a husband.  Those standards are impossible for me to meet, but there's a pattern developed in the plot that explains in nonverbal terms what Eph 5:25 means when it tells me to love my wife ""as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.""  I was able to connect the dots to 1Cor 13: 4-7, so that my motives can't be seeking human approval, but loving her whether she ever shows any appreciation when I do right by my wife.  It connects back to my often failure to do right for God's approval instead of my wife's approval or affection (cf. Jn 12:43 ""...they loved the praise of men rather than the praise of God."")  I've lent my copy of the DVD to a friend who said to me in very graphic language (for sensitivity's sake, not repeated verbatim) several months ago, ""My wife says I'm indifferent and insensitive to her.""  Knowing that I wasn't the prototypical loving husband made my heart break for him, and I lent him my copy hoping that he'd get some benefit by applying the ""Love Dare"" to his own situation.",1425859200,,1108,4.411764705882353

Got to a bump in the road with my spouse and suggested he watch it. Well, he did and it has really helped our relationship. That's why I decided to get the DVD for myself, so we could watch at our will. A must see for all couples, those conemplating marriage, those newlyweds, and those married for a long time.

How we treat Christ and He keeps giving love when we don't deserve it. Often you will see movies with the couple already Christians, but they were the reverse. When one partner learned how Christ is love then they both came to Christ.

3641053,4,B001HN68ZU,"""Fireproof"" is a decent movie with an excellent message for those open to faith and spirituality. The story follows Caleb Holt (Kirk Cameron) as a fire captain who faces danger on a daily basis, yet who is in a deeply troubled marriage with Catherine (Erin Bethea.) Much of the dialogue is forced, but the Christian-based anti-divorce message is clear and a fresh of breath air. Most of the cast are simply adequate playing their caricaturish roles in the film, but Cameron is more nuanced and rises above. Ken Bevel as Caleb's closest professional friend and confidante gives the best performance here and it's largely thanks to him that the pro-marriage plot works in the format presented.

This film was recommended to me by a very close friend and I truly enjoyed it in spite of some plot contrivances and occasionally implausible dialogue. The DVD comes with many extras including a commentary, deleted scenes, making of feature, etc. It you are a Christian or are not overtly hostile to Christianity, this is a very good film reaffirming the importance of marriage and commitment. I applaud the Kendrick brothers for making this film, and think that despite its small budget (with some occasional budgetary compromises in the production values) that it is well worth seeing, especially for those with weighty marriage decisions facing them.",1421625600,3,1346,5.063063063063063

I was once traumatized by religion (I won't say which) because they believe in Jesus and I now realize that God wants a personal relationship with us. To me the point of the movie is that in order to understand true love you need to first understand Jesus & the sacrifice. Further, if we do not have God in our hearts we are susceptible to Satans attacks & the ways of the world. If you are not a Christian you might not understand this movie. Yes the character being played is a sinner and he's a jerk. When you get saved, by saying a prayer & confessing Jesus as The Lord of your life & savior, you get changed inside. It happened to me. You begin to want to please God and your views shift and your life is never the same. You want to be more Christ like although we could never be because he was sinless. It's great to see movies without a ton of naked people doing the wrong things so I liked it.",1416528000,,959,4.133689839572193

3641524,5,B001HN68ZU,This movie played a big part in saving our marriage when we were separated 5 years ago. Someone bought 2 copies and made us both promise to watch it even if separately as we were not living together at the time. It made us reach higher & determined to fight for our marriage. Between the fireproof dvd & some hard work in therapy we now have a 14 year old relationship that is stronger than ever before. We have bought many of these over the years as a gift when we see a couple struggling to pay forward. I believe it can save many relationships and help good ones become great. If a relationship is struggling or about to be lost give this a try. Its powerful & life changing. Risk a few bucks & two hours of your time to possibly save your relationship or marriage. It's a small price compared to the powerful message you'll remember for life.,1415404800,,846,4.29375

But that's what made the movie hopeful; of course it's a movie but when you're willing to give it your all, no challenge can be too great.
We bought the book and daily devo (The love dare) and have started it. Starting off slow, failing miserably the first few challenges, forgetting to do one here or there, but we both get back on track and have had great success. Hoping to draw near to each other and to God.

3641616,3,B001HN68ZU,"Fireproof

The word Fireproof in the title has a word play.  Although the Kirk Cameron character is a fireman, what needs to be made Fireproof is his marriage to co-star Erin Bethea.  As it is explained by a conversation with a supporting actor, fire proof does not mean a marriage will never suffer turmoil.  You Fireproof your marriage so that when the fire inevitably comes, the marriage will survive.
 It is clear that the writer has paid particularly close attention to watching the internal dynamics of a marriage.  The movie has been so popular because it truly reflects the friction, frustration, misunderstanding and anger that get in the way of two people in love.  In the movie, a ruined marriage and a broken man are both healed by intervention of the Holy Spirit, working through a 40 day scripted plan.
 This film has spawned a mini-industry of Christian marital help.  In fact, right here in Rim Country, one of our local churches celebrated St. Valentines Day by having a viewing of the film for couples.  It has already become another tool in Christian ministry, obviously focused on improving peoples marriages.
 Except for Kirk Cameron-who also produced the movie-the rest of the cast are unfamiliar faces, as is director Alex Kendrick.  The film is hurt by the sometimes wooden acting by these novices.  The production values are not first rate, as you would expect in a movie that cost a teeny tiny $500,000 to film.  It never made it into more than 900 theaters at a time, but still brought it a satisfying $33 million.  For comparison, the number one movie this week is in 3,175 theaters.  Fireproof is a small film, but important to those who can accept its message.  Viewers gave it a 77.7% A rating.
 I give this earnest little 118 minute, PG rated movie a scant two saw blades, because of the low production values.  It is less than it deserves.",1412208000,,1872,4.722222222222222

3641710,4,B001HN68ZU,"Lovable Actor - Kirk Cameron, stars in this drama of a Fire Chief Captain, who is appreciated and hailed as a courageous hero by everyone but his estranged wife. With his love-lost marriage all but incinerated, a fellow Fire Fighter encourages him to fight for and try too preserve..., his crumbling marriage. With the same intensity, if not more, as though he were fighting too keep the Marriage Covenant from the flames of Hell, itself. Intrigued, he is simultaneously inspired by his own father, who challenges him to stay his impending divorce and give it just 40 more days..., before agreeing to the divorce that his wife is seeking. And, just what was he supposed to do within those 40-days to save the marriage when years together as husband and wife, couldn't do it?! Heartbroken, on-edge, frustrated, emotionally drained and wandering... seemingly all alone, through his marital wilderness..., he reluctantly decided to try the 40-day challenge. The little booklet that his father had given him, with a 'do good' suggestion for each of the 40-days, changed him, his wife, saved their marriage and positively affected all of those that were around them. Both, platonicly and intimately. They even went so far, as too renew their marriage vows! So perhaps, you're experiencing marital or relational difficulties? And you're at the end of your rope and want to call it quits?! But, as tumultuous as your estranged relationship may be, ask yourself: Do I love this person? Is it worth it to try and save this marriage, partnership and/or friendship? Before things went sour and times were good between the two of you, for memories sake..., is this person worth a mere 40-consecutive days to you? If so, knowing this person as well as you do, what can you say or do..., with sincerity from your heart for 40-straight days that would re-establish communications and initiate contact with that person? Not only to apologize but with true, heartfelt humility, to show and tell them with the utmost candor that you miss them and that you want them back in your life?! A telephone call, a card, a letter, some flowers, some candy, chocolates, a lunch or dinner invitation, a leisurely day spent together just talking and enjoying each others company, going someplace to be alone so that the two of you can talk without interruptions (mobile phones 'off', please!) and so on. Are just a few of the things that come readily to mind, too try and save or salvage a friendship or marriage or perhaps, even a business relationship. Basically, somehow get together so you can at least 'clear the air' of any misunderstandings. So, that the two of you can at least, part in peace. If indeed, that turns out to be the case. The Military, Police and Fire Fighter's, motto is: ""Never leave your partner behind!"" So is 40-days really..., asking so much? You cared about each other once... and perhaps, because you're reading this, it is time to initiate your 40-day restoration process? This movie is for everyone that wants to revive, restore, renew and refresh a relationship. And is in need of a suggestive, viewing (audio/visual) tool and some much need assistance, as too how to possibly go about it. Is your relationship FIREPROOF? This color, single-disc, DVD which comes to it's audience in full screen format, is a powerful motion picture which is an initial spark, to the resurrection of an all but finished marriage or relationship. And, it's a helpful tool for the projected healing of any partnership. Along side of that, it's good entertainment with an endearing message. All in all, this thought provoking and perhaps... life changing film, is a useful keepsake for yourself or too share with those in need. So again, is your relationship FIREPROOF?

3641751,5,B001HN68ZU,"I'm going to review this movie from 2 standpoints: one as a Christian and one as if I was recommending to a non-Christiain friend, as I don't want to turn any audience away based on faith. Great family movie...especially for children/young adults getting into the ""dating/courting/marriage"" years. It is a reminder to everyone to put your faith in God, respect  and value your relationships of all kinds and honor the commitment or covenant of marriage. Kirk Cameron is always entertaining and has been a favorite of mine since Growing Pains! It is wonderful to see a Hollywood actor who hasn't compromised his principles while pursuing an acting career. In fact, his performance is that much more impactful, as it comes across in such a loving and genuine way towards viewers, that he is doing God's work not just starring in a movie. As for any viewer, I know it will impact the way you and your family think about commitment. The main character is forced to view his commitment to his marriage (which is lacking) to the commitment he honors through his work. I think most people can relate to that. We all have come home to our family and due to our stress, thoughtlessness, etc have been far less sensitive or caring toward them than we are to our work or even strangers. It is an actual realistic look at what can happen to a marriage if not cared for or worked on properly. However, it also offers a realistic (non- hollywood) answer for solving these problems: put the work in. Put the same excellence into your commitment to your spouse as your work. Whether you appreciate the spirituality or just the logic, it is a wonderful must see movie.",1406505600,,1651,4.673539518900344

Though this was a movie about very serious issues it also had enough humor to keep it from being too heavy.
Great movie for anyone that wants to have a good marraige and do what is good and right. Even if your spouse does not do the right thing you will know you have done everything possible to make your marriage work. God Bless!!!",1401494400,,665,4.450819672131147

When we get married the two become one and the way you treat your spouse is the way you wish to be treated. It felt so good to see what happens when a person admits his or her failures and forgivness brings them together. Admitting your mistakes can only lead to a better understanding of each other.

Its definitely dramatic, but unapologetic about being a faith-based production. Not preachy, but reaffirms marriage and obviously promotes the Love Dare books. Comes very close to being an lengthy advertisement for the book. But a good movie nonetheless.",1400284800,,376,5.283333333333333

3641832,4,B001HN68ZU,"SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!

Pros:
1) Clean & wholesome with a good message about loving during hard times
2) Acting could be better, but it's not exactly a blockbuster.  So I'll give it some lead way here.

Cons:
1) I didn't like how that the wife only came back to the main character after he spent his entire boat savings on her parents' convalescence care.  Up until that point - even though he had done months of little things for her - she was still going to leave him for the married doctor at her work.  This is what I didn't like about the movie.  She's a gold digger.
2) While I think it's great that they had a lot of gospel / relationship with God stuff, I'm not really sure how many nonChristians actually saw this movie.  It seems kind of like they were preaching to the choir.",1399507200,,783,4.285714285714286

3641834,5,B001HN68ZU,"I first caught it on tv not knowing what I was getting in to but for whatever strange reason,it caught my interest so I just started recording and kept watching it. Although it wasn't a great action flick or a great epic movie  and didn't have great movie stars like Tom Cruise or Kathy Bates it still delivers a great message.",1399248000,,327,4.360655737704918
3641835,1,B001HN68ZU,"Bad ideas found in this movie: Kirk Cameron's character never apologizes for being verbally abusive (he screams and rants and drives his wife to tears) but instead asks for forgiveness from his wife for being 'selfish.' Also, the character repeatedly smashes inanimate objects when he gets mad and physically threatens a doctor (and this is after converting to Christianity) for sending his wife flowers; nice message there, I'm sure Jesus would approve *sarcasm.* The wife doesn't really change her mind until she realizes that Kirk purchased her mom's medical supplies using his boat money. Other users have pointed out that this is like she's being bought, and I think that's pretty accurate. The work he does to change and all the housework aren't what push her to accept him, it's the money.

Machismo: a fireman brags a ton, so Kirk Cameron plays a nasty trick on him, which results in explosive fiery diarrhea for the poor guy. Kirk comes clean about the switcheroo after becoming a Christian but doesn't apologize for the suffering he caused.

Bad dialog: ""blah blah blah"" and the black Christian Fireman says he wasn't scared to die because he 'knows where he's going when he dies.' Some other fireman says to Kirk ""hey man, do you know where you're going when you die?"" and he then follows it up with ""I know where I'm going: in the ground."" Nobody asks the question that way and then states that! Argh! Nobody says this!

Kirk Cameron and the actress who plays the wife are good actors, but I found the rest lacking. The cinematography was good but neither were enough to save the movie.",1399248000,5,1598,4.782608695652174

3641839,2,B001HN68ZU,"This is somewhat sad. I was disappointed to see this as it does not deal directly with what her role is in the marital problem. It takes two. If he has an internet addiction, has she asked him what his needs are ( not that she is expcted to meet all his needs ) but has she even asked?  Is she just criticizing him without listening? He really wants his wife and not the internet addiction, it would appear. It can't always be his fault all the time. If she fails to listen to his needs, then that marriage will not improve, no matter what sacrifices he makes. This is more like a romance novel where he is in love with a wife who is not there emotionally for him. There are no scripture references that say she is to be so overly proud of herself that she is rude and disrespectful to her husband, flirts openly with other men while she is married, does so in full view of her co-workers, and then this is all supposed to be his fault.  If this is a Christian message for today, it is truly sad and disappointing. The wife has some responsibility here.",1398729600,4,1053,4.207920792079208

We got it because we wanted to watch a firefighter flick. Do not be fooled. It is not a firefighter flick. It is a heavy handed Christian-message film about being a good husband. The acting is bad, the story is maudlin, the two scenes that have to do with fire rescue (a car crash and a house fire) are unrealistic, and the firefighter gear isn't even right. (Also, it looks brand new.) Not only that, but the two main characters in this movie are extremely unlikable, and spend the first 20 minutes arguing and complaining that they don't give each other enough respect. We ended up fast-forwarding through much of this, because it was so repetitive and so hard to take. But we really hated them both.

The worst part about this movie? You couldn't rent it. You had to buy it. So now own a terrible, poorly written, badly acted, unrealistic, truly awful film. Ugh.",1396828800,6,1030,4.421052631578948

3641863,3,B001HN68ZU,"After hearing the hype for years, I finally watched this movie. It was alright, and it presents good Christian and marriage themes, but I was left feeling disappointed. The movie could have been much better.

To me, the issue seems to be that the movie's otherwise good storyline and characterizations were thrown off in order to appeal to the presumed fantasies of Christian women. This is particularly evident in the movie's early portrayal of the titular couple.  Caleb is portrayed as a complete jerk with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. All of the marriage's problems and most of his wife's personal issues are portrayed as his fault, arising from his selfishness. Catherine is a helpless victim of his emotional abuse. The divorce, naturally, is all his fault and he initiates it in a shouting match where he literally corners his helpless wife. Needless to say this is not very realistic. Real marriages fail because of mistakes on BOTH sides, no one is totally good or totally evil, and the majority of divorces are initiated by the wife.

While Caleb's portrayal improves and even becomes heroic (though notably not until after he has started trying to win back his wife). The movie remains consistent in portraying Catherine and women in general as victims in a world where everything is a man's fault. She's having an affair, but that's the other man's fault. She stonewalls Caleb's attempts to rescue their marriage, but that's because of bad advice from her friends based, of course, on the malicious intentions her husband had previously displayed (making this also his fault). In contrast, Caleb's difficulties arise from his own flawed character, which is magically transformed when he becomes a Christian. Catherine is said to need similar transformation, but it's not clear from what since she has no character flaws to speak of.

Nor is the title couple alone in this. The heroic friend of Caleb confesses total responsibility for his previous marriage problems. Even Caleb's father, an ideal character and mentor throughout much of the movie reveals in the end that he did not invent the Love Dare to save his relationship with his wife, but that it was Caleb's mother who created and used it on him.  All his virtue is actually from her. In fact, the only couple to whom the theme of universal male blame does not apply is Caleb's neighbors, seen only momentarily and played purely as comic relief. The theme may appeal to a twisted female psych that does not believe their gender is capable of flaws or responsible, even in part, for relationship problems, but it spoils an otherwise perfectly good movie.",1395619200,,2630,4.954648526077097

I would highly recommend this product to couples that are not communicating any more (if your at your witts end) but even if you don't have any 'problems' its still worth watching for perspective.

Additionally, I would recommend buying ""the love dare"" book/couples study ([...]).  All to often couples fall apart or grow distant because of lack of 'healthy' communication with one another. There are guides for all kinds of things SO why not try a guide on FIREPROOFING your relationship/marriage and cultivate good channels of communication.

Some key take aways from the movie which are also further explored in the book:
Why Marriage? Explore the blessings and challenges of godly marriage.
Contract or Covenant? Examine the difference between the worlds design for marriage and Gods original intention.
Clean Fighting. Learn how to fight the fires of conflict effectively and respectfully.
Leading Your Heart, Instead of Vice Versa. Practice choosing love when it isn't your instinctive response.

It teaches the message to step back, look at your mate's point of view and don't be so quick to give up on your spiritual commitments such as marriage. There's a very strong Christian theme, as in most all Kirk Cameron movies.

It's a very plain movie without a lot of bells and whistles. It reminds me of a work or school instructional video in some ways, however it's message does trump the quality in spades.

3641928,1,B001HN68ZU,"As an evangelical pastor and professional chaplain who does extensive and intensive pastoral counseling, I am appalled at the conclusion of this movie and its permissive stance on emotional affairs. In a modern world where emotional affairs are becoming more and more common, ignoring the damage such affairs cause to marriages is not responsible and certainly NOT a Christian message. It is not the picture of a Biblical, covenant-based understanding of marriage.

A truly Christian movie would have had Christina realize on her own (before the donation discovery from Caleb to her parents) that what she was doing was wrong. She was having a covenant violating relationship with a MARRIED man! Christina made a covenant not only with Caleb but also with God. This is a covenant she entered into freely. And to deny her agency (e.g. she was so miserable and just needed someone to give her attention...blah, blah, blah) is to go sliding down the slippery slope of justifying adultery and to actually disempower Christina as a woman in her ability to make God-honoring choices. Also, my training has taught me this movie is glossing over a dangerous truth: having a third party present (e.g. Christina's emotional affair partner) makes reconciliation next to impossible in reality. Also, this movie doesn't do justice to how damaging Christina's sin truly is...she is having an affair with ANOTHER WOMAN'S HUSBAND! Instead, it hints that she narrowly missed jumping off the cliff of divorce and consummating her affair, which totally dismisses the real damage she has already done in sinning against Caleb, the married man's wife/family, and God.

Is selfless love good? Does God pursue His Bride? Yes and yes. I commend the idea of caring for one's wife out of agape love. However, I do not commend a picture that puts women in passive roles in their marriages as simply pawns blown back and forth by the romantic guile of the men in their lives. We are each accountable to God for our actions, vows, and choices--both male and female. And adultery is VERY serious business to God (He prohibits it as one of the TEN COMMANDMENTS, after all.)

Don't waste your time watching this movie if you want a Christian perspective on marriage. And by no means use it as a basis to save your marriage! There are better and healthier resources out there for that.",1391904000,4,2352,4.934343434343434

My wife and I didn't do everything right, but working through our issues was an agreement we've always shared.  And leaving my spouse ""in the middle of a fire"" was never an option. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this video to all married couples. I also recommend watching the credits at the end to get the email address of the organization that produced this video. It seems they have resources you can acquire if your marriage needs help.",1391126400,,557,4.626262626262626

He has also had a hard life so the hope of a God-blessed life seems far-fetched to him. He's also seen plenty of Christians act less than they should. Sometimes, when we have no real life examples, we need a movie to give us a peek into how things SHOULD be.

3641952,3,B001HN68ZU,The movie show what may happen in marriages when partners do not communicate.  All of the reviews about Fireproof being funny are undeserved.  The movie does not have the acting quality of big studio releases because all of the actors and actresses are unpaid volunteers.  The movie was good for a low budget independent film.,1390867200,,326,4.890909090909091

3641986,4,B001HN68ZU,"With marriage under such attack these days and couples giving up far too readily on a relationship thats worth fighting for, this is one film with a message that really sets the bar and shows people a better way (not an easier one, but deffinitely a better one). The seriousness of the story is relieved by some welcome and genuinely funny bits.
 As a male, I was tempted to think the wife was being far too hard on her husband - given the effort he was clearly putting in to make ammends for his previously selfish behaviour and in attempting to win back her love and respect; and the doctor who she is drawn to is a real creepy, two timing slimeball - what was she thinking? An unashamedly Christian message carried out in such a way you that you wouldnt be embarassed to share it with non believing friends or family - entertaining,informative, challenging and funny - Recomend.",1389484800,,881,4.540880503144654

3642016,2,B001HN68ZU,"Unrealistic,  Churchianity at it's best. Nothing to do with God of the bible. Sad that people are so easily fooled. Interesting that in the bible there is a picture of the road to distraction, that its wide and many will follow it.
Upside down world we live in. This typical taking the word of God and twisting it, and make it fit to preach to an audience that cannot think for themselves anymore. This dumbing down is so sad. Simplistic view of our relationship to God and to each other.

Dude is put words in his mouth from very beginning, he is a jerk, selfish, porn lover, angry, two face.
Wife is tender, patient, enduring, hard working, sexy, overlooked by her husband.

There is nothing about why its started to fall apart. Its dangerous territory to offer some kind of guidance without knowing underlying problems. All you have to do is to give your life to Jesus and thats it. Is it really that simple?

And as he was progressing through the 40 days of dare to lure his wife back, she was just plain b***h, hard as a rock. Its awful. I will not go in to acting or production.

And what is with 40 day things? 40 days of Purpose. Purpose driven life. Love dare. This heresy is sweeping across the country.

3642031,3,B001HN68ZU,"The Evangelical Protestant movement is a cultural force of tremendous scope and size.  In recent years, it has moved from its Nixon Era niche of small publishing houses, Christian themed novels, and magazines to full length feature movies with at least one top notch actor.  This movie, Fireproof, is part of a sophisticated marketing package within the Evangelical Protestant community.  One can purchase the ""marriage saving"" book The Love Dare on amazon.com.

This film therefore has all the elements of a Hollywood Blockbuster but it is played specifically for a niche audience. The movie headlines with top notch actor Kirk Cameron, a grown up, former child star and a host of other actors who range from polished professional to amateur.  The movie itself is filmed in a sort of made-for-TV way.  It doesn't have the broad cinematography of a bigger budget movies.  All-in-all the film is a graft of a church play upon a larger production.

The movie tells the story of Fireman Caleb Holt (Kirk Cameron) and his rapidly dissolving, childless marriage.  Holt gets advice from his father to try a ""love dare.""  This dare is a 40 day program described in a hand written notebook.  Holt follows the dare and comes to a deeper appreciation of his religious faith, converts his wife, and restores his marriage.

All of this is great fair for the large, mostly feminine Evangelical community.

It does however suffer from several critical philosophical flaws.  Movies are nothing more than a technological upgrade from myths told by fire-light, but this does not in any way lessen their importance.  Mythological stories are central to humanity's understanding of things and they provide an easy to reference and remember guide to handling difficult situations.

In other words, Fireproof is not that much different than Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, where Snow White comes of marriageable age, and then runs into difficulties due to a jealous rival.  While initially defeated and exiled, she rallies and learns how to care for others and run a household.  One imagines that she will be an excellent wife when her prince claims her. Snow White, therefore teaches young girls the nobility of home economics.

Fireproof is like Snow White in this manner but is off in the same way that Disney's later Princess film The Little Mermaid is.  In the mermaid movie, the princess is a self-absorbed, reckless young lady that causes scandal within her household by missing important singing events (presumably important to the mermaid royal family as Remembrance Day is to the British Royals).  She enters into an ill-advised agreement with a witch and eventually risks the political stability of a human kingdom (the heir apparent nearly dies).  She also causes her father to forfeit the kingdom of the merpeople to an evil tyrant, if only temporarily.

The moral lessons learned in the two movies are therefore worlds apart.

Fireproof teaches a moral lesson, with all the force of a well phrased sermon from a well established church, but it is a warped moral lesson.

First, Caleb Holt is, in fact, a model husband.  His only flaws seem to be not doing mundane housework, watching some pornography, and concentrating on his job.  His wife is thus unhappy with him for very slender concerns.  Meanwhile, Caleb's wife is cold and is quite happy being seduced by an already married Doctor at the hospital where she works.  She has not given Caleb children in all their years of marriage and insists that Caleb should provide her ageing parents with great resources as the afflictions of old age come upon them.

In other words, this movie puts a theological stamp of approval on female abandonment and self centered behavior-including infidelity.

Marriage is an economic union between a man and woman for the purposes of raising their children in a stable household.  Sexual fidelity on the part of the woman is essential in that the man can be sure his resources are being applied to children that are his own.  Without the purpose of children and inheritance, marriage itself is nothing.

A more central and important truth is that the costs of marriage are primarily born by men.  That is why a dowry (or some like form i.e. paying for the girl's education so she can have a good job) is so important to get men to commit.  Marriage is expensive and this movie encourages marriage to be even more expensive.  Part of the advice given to Caleb involves ""studying"" ones wife-to the point of getting a ""Ph. D.""  This of course has significant costs.  In getting a ""Ph. D"" in the knowledge of what is otherwise an ordinary wife means that something else goes un-done.  Marriage is therefore a continuous exercise in flattery, courtship, and game.  No wonder the Holts don't have children.  There is also a large emphasis on making the man responsible for housework (in addition to changing the oil, paying the insurance, mortgage, and electrical bill.)

Caleb's wife, played by Enri Bethea is a nearly flat character with little independent moral agency.  She is an object that is won back by Caleb from another rival.

Ultimately, this is a simplistic movie with a simplistic philosophy that will not likely rescue the institution of marriage.",1388361600,,5247,4.946285714285715
3642032,3,B001HN68ZU,"As a Christian, I liked the fact that the movie emphasized unconditional love and service with no expectation of reward. However, there was an emotional overtone throughout that if you make sacrifices and treat your spouse with kindness and respect, you're going to have a great, or at least vastly improved, marriage. This may not end up being true. A friend's daughter married a man who, unbeknownst to her prior to marriage, had drug addictions and many other problems. He's a compulsive liar and a thief. He claims to have emotional and physical disabilities so he never helps his wife with any task and doesn't hold a job. She can't change him, but she takes her marriage vows seriously and is sticking with him. My own husband struggles with depression, probably due to being raised by a sociopathically selfish mom. He's tried counseling, prayer and medication, but his depression has not been healed and it has a negative effect on our marriage.

The other thing that bothered me is that while a man in a troubled marriage could possibly get the Love Dare challenge to work (since women are ""responders""), a women who tried the same thing might be considered weak, pathetic, and desperate. Many years ago, a female friend of mine knew her marriage was in trouble and suspected her husband was having an affair. She read marriage books, pampered her husband, and sought to allure him back. He divorced her and married the other woman.

Two pieces of advice for Christian husbands and wives: 1) Focus on the Lord. Only He can meet your deepest needs. Your spouse cannot, even if he is as good-looking and attentive as Kirk Cameron!; 2) Treat your spouse with respect, lovingkindness and forgiveness while keeping your expectations realistic.",1388361600,,1747,4.898648648648648

You think this is going to be a hot, sexy romance with a lot of danger - but instead, it's a religious propaganda piece filled with messages about ""faith"" and ""god"" and all kinds of other utter nonsense. Long-winded ballads about ""Jesus"" go on and on while trying to trap you emotionally.

The horrible way that the married couple treat each other should have been corrected by simply being better, more patient, more tolerant, and empathetic people. The agenda here seems to clearly be to make religion a cure for people's problems. In real life, being ""completely giving"" to another person will make you gullible roadkill in love. There are many people who are willing to take everything you've got and then leave you, but this movie (as a total fantasy) is about people magically changing their ways after believing in some mystical deity named Jesus or god.

As I watched it, I kept getting the feeling that it was one of those training clips they show you at work that are acted out by employees in human resources or whatever department the training is about.

Kirk Cameron by far was the best actor and even his performance felt more like a made for TV performance rather than a performance worthy of a Motion picture.  The rest of the cast seemed like they had likely never acted before. It makes it very hard to care for a character when the character seems like a talking doll rather than a human being.

While the premise of the story is a good one, the way it was told was jumbled and disjointed. I felt like it started off slow then was rushed at the end. It could have been better, but still the message behind the story was a good one.

He wakes up one day to realize she's leaving him. With the help of his father and a co-worker, he employs a method of demonstrating to his wife he still loves her and doesn't want to divorce. The method is the ""love dare,"" in which Caleb spends forty consecutive days performing some act for his wife, regardless whether the act is reciprocated. Over time, during the love dare, he gives up his `boats and hos' and eventually wins back his wife. Caleb discovers the love dare is not easy, and is treated unfairly for most of the dare, but whoever said marriage was easy, and whoever said life was fair?

Fireproof has a universal lesson for those trying to save their marriage: try to save it to the best of your ability. There's no guarantee you will succeed, but when resolution comes, you will know you did your best. I couldn't save my marriage because my wife couldn't give up her version of boats and hos, but now, years later, as a divorc, I have the peace of mind that I did everything I could, to the best of my ability, to save the marriage.

The most interesting thing to me is that Kirk refuses to kiss a woman other than his real wife, so in the end of the movie, they show Kirk kissing someone in silhouette - which is his real life wife!!!  I can't say enough good things about this movie!!",1384387200,,529,4.087378640776699

3642102,5,B001HN68ZU,"I didn't like this movie the first time I watched it, because I didn't need the message, and I was just wanting an entertaining movie.

I watched this movie again recently because I was standing at my kitchen sink washing dishes, griping and grumping about something, like Katherine in the movie, and all of a sudden out of nowhere came the words "" Love Dare "".
 I know HIS voice when I hear it and He told me Love Dare.
So I got the book and began to read it, and I got this movie out and watched it again.

I used to be married to a fireman, captain, engineer, paramedic. I know what its like to be a Katherine.
I even used to work in the emergency room at a hospital.
I could relate to this movie, especially the scene with the train coming down the tracks and they are trying to move that car off the tracks.
Aside from the girl screaming too much, that was annoying,
 watching that train coming and those firemen trying to move that car.. and that fireman being so close to the tracks
~  it was so real to me. I cried.
It was so real because I know, firemen really do have experiences like that.

I think if there are negative reviews of this movie it is because you are watching it as just a movie.
 He, the Holy Spirit told me to watch this movie,.
In order to get what this movie is all about you have to watch it with more than your eyes.
You have to watch it with your heart and with God's Agape Love.
If we can really get what Agape Love is all about we can get what marriage is all about.

I agree if you just watch this movie as entertainment ~ a movie ~ its not the best acting.

But if you watch it looking for Gods message you will find it.

If you love the way God loves, you won't need all those dumb marriage books, and how to books, because its all about Agape Love. God's Love.
And God's love, living in His Agape Love is a moment by moment thing.
Some people say day by day, but for me its moment by moment because I blow it all the time.
 I have a hard time loving like HE does.

Another book that really goes along with The Love Dare is a book by Nancy Missler called Why Should I Be The First To Change?
I think I had every passage in this book highlighted and underlined because it so applied to me.

Again if we can get God's way of loving someone, if we can love, if we can give first,
not looking for someone to fill our cup up all the time, then you won't need all those silly marriage books out there.

This is a good movie if you can watch it with the right heart.
It has a message to share. Its not just a feel good entertaining movie.
Its more than all that carnal temporal stuff.
It is laying down yourself, laying down your life, giving first.
Agape Love

3642108,4,B001HN68ZU,"I watched ""Fireproof"" in a theater not long after it was released. I knew that it had an explicitly Christian message to it and that as a Christian I knew that it would resonate positively with me. It did. At the same time, I also came to the film with the expectation that its storyline would be simplistic, the quality of the film would be average, and the acting would be pedestrian. My expectation was based on past experiences with Christian movies.

I must say that on all these counts ""Fireproof"" exceeded my expectations. While the storyline isn't profound, neither is it sappy. It portrays many of the conflicts that arise in a marriage and the difficulty of working these out without intense struggle and a true willingness for both parties to change in a way that is realistic. Occasionally (though just occasionally) the positive changes that bring about the reconciliation between Caleb Holt and his wife Catherine come about a bit too easily, but for the most part the portrayal is realistic.

The acting is very good though not great. Kirk Cameron does a fairly good job of portraying Caleb Holt, but it's clearly not a performance that would win an Oscar. The same can be said for the acting in general.

Thankfully, the movie is not ""preachy"" (a problem with some Christian films) but presents the intended message through the storyline itself.",1382572800,2,1361,4.8076923076923075

Kirk Cameron has given us something to believe in, hope for, and affirm in making a commitment and sticking with it.  Maybe why so many people ridicule him and the movie is because they secretly know that he is right.  Conviction is always an uncomfortable thing.

The Love Dare is a great way to help restore marriages, however, results probably aren't typical of the ending of this movie.

It's two people that have grown apart trying to decide if it's over or if they can come back together.  It's about seeing what is separating you from the person you love and eliminating the space between you.  It's about learning where your priorities lie.

Don't listen to the critics. The people can't be wrong. People made it (and still do) one of the highest grossing independent films of all time. The only reason they didn't care for it was that it was frankly too honest for them, poignant in its simplicity.

3642284,2,B001HN68ZU,"Hello.  First of all, I'll excuse the sometimes poor acting of this film because it was mostly done with everyday people.  That said, I really didn't like the way the plot was handled.

My main gripe is with Caleb's wife, Catherine.  I felt bad for her because of her failing marriage, and I wanted to like her, but the movie ended up making her seem so ungrateful.  It sets the married couple up in such a way as to take them to the extreme in order to dramatize their point.

I would definitely understand her suspicion of Caleb's newfound behavior, especially in light of the threat of divorce.  However, after a while, she just came off as being cold and unappreciative.  This, of course, was done to turn Caleb into a Jesus-type savior figure.

For example, Catherine sees the smashed computer outside and the roses and love card by the desk, indicating that Caleb took serious action in wanting to end his pornography addiction.  And yet, without even considering having a heart-to-heart conversation first to see if he really wants to change his ways, she simply drops the divorce papers on him.

Another time, she enters the hospital room where Caleb is receiving medical treatment for his injuries as a fire fighter.  One would think that if their loved one almost died, they would rush over to embrace them.  Yet all she does is coldly comments, ""You look terrible.""

Even when Caleb sacrifices his goal of buying a fishing boat to help her mother, she's not sensible enough to figure out it's him.  She actually believes that a doctor she's barely flirting with forked over the money!  Wow.

I enjoyed the movie overall; I just wish the execution of the plot was more realistic.  Although both parties were at fault, it was way too one-sided.  Anybody who behaves like Catherine after their spouse does all that for them is a terrible person.",1372982400,,1853,4.698757763975156

3642319,4,B001HN68ZU,"Main characters: Erin Bethea who plays Catherine Holt and Kirk Cameron who plays fire chief Capt. Caleb Holt.

Released in theaters on a very small budget in 2008, the film went on to gross over $33 million, not a bad return for a low budget film.  The film runs about 2 hours.

Summary: Capt. Caleb Holt is a successful fire chief married to the beautiful but doubtful Catherine.  Their marriage is on the rocks because they are no longer a couple in spirit; instead, each focuses their lives and energy on their own careers.  After being married for seven years, the couple has drifted so far apart that their marriage heads for a divorce and Catherine no longer trusts Caleb.  Once Catherine states she wants out, Caleb seeks guidance from his dad who asks him to commit to the 40-day challenge.  Although Caleb is hesitant at first, he finally comes to accept the challenge in its entirety.  He's moved by his love for Catherine even though she no longer wants to be with him and constantly rejects him.  He constantly seeks understanding from him dad until it dawns on him that he must change for himself.  His father explains that he must love like the love God shows us.  Committed to saving his marriage at all costs, including spending all of his years of savings on a selfless act, Caleb Holt is now ready to face his toughest challenge ever - winning his wife's heart back.

The film is very low budget even with a couple of popular actors.  The point of the movie is not so much explaining the ways of Christianity but showing that true love, selflessness, and a commitment to another person make a marriage strong.

I found the movie enjoyable and would recommend it to others.  The movie is definitely not filled with stunts and cool action scenes but it does deliver a powerful message.",1371081600,,1801,4.601880877742946

This movie shows how either spouse can re-ignite the love that has waned through inattention and busyness of our hurried and scattered lifestyles. It reminds us all how a little consideration and kindness....small deeds....loving words....gentle persuasion.....can turn a heart around.

3642378,4,B001HN68ZU,"I am giving this 4 stars for a few reasons, but I would like my review to point out the positive attributes of the movie that can apply to any relationship!  I also want to address some of the comments that state, ""this does not work in my relationship.""  I have a few prelude statements I think are pivotal before my main point.

Since the Christian message in this film is a subject of debate within the reviews, I first should state that I am a Christian and a licensed attorney.  I refuse to project my values onto others to insist that Christianity will save all marriages, or that non-Christians cannot have successful marriages! More on that below.  Second, the movies comes off more as a TV special, but I would not say the quality is bad...just not that of a movie.

As a ""open minded Christian,"" (I say open minded because I am extremely non-judgmental of others and I do not impute my values or those of the Bible and MY interpretation of it on anyone but me).  I have read several comments here about the book and its principles.  As a licensed attorney, having seen divorce and family law issues up close.  I also believe most Christian counseling does not go deep enough as it is often unwilling to address real gut wrenching questions about tolerance and empathy.  Example, while it is certainly possible for a spouse that enjoys pornography to quit viewing it, the basic desire is likely to continue and the marriage must be poised to deal with that in a mutually agreeable manner or compromise.

Don't get me wrong, the principles and values of the Christian walk are absolutely valuable to a successful marriage.  However, Christians do not rank the highest in keeping their vows...and there are many other faiths and non-believers that do have very successful relationships.  If successful marriage was solely for Christians, their faith, and their practice, then we would not need State or Federal approval or licensing would we?  I think this is an important distinction.  The rights granted at a State and Federal level have a place for any couple.  The great debate over marriage seems to not draw a distinction between individual rights and obligations created by the State, and that of God/Church.

With all this prelude stated, and having seen the movie I would advise ANY troubling marriage partner to see the movie and practice these principles (regardless of your faith), I will simply state to those that try this course and find it to be worsening the relationship, the journey is still very important!  In the END (emphasis added), but not necessarily in the attempts and journey, you MUST have a willing partner to want the relationship!  If you don't, and you do EVERYTHING...including PUSHING well beyond your preconceived limits by not listening to those friends and sources in your life that are encouraging you to divorce, you may or may not save your marriage.  But, you will come out far better than one who just quite prematurely...you will improve yourself, and you will have given it solid effort, and you will be poised better for other relationships in life!  If you watch the movie, you should be able to see there could be alternate endings!  Without giving it away, the couple could reconcile or divorce in the end despite all that was done!  While practicing these principles is best, when one partner wants out, and is not interested in reconciling, it is over and time to move on.  In the end, it takes two mutual people to form a marriage, partnership, or relationship!",1368316800,,3521,4.762767710049423

It gives hope to those not yet married that nothing is truly ""fireproof."" To be ""fireproof"" does not mean that a fire is not prevented, but that you overcome it....I think I paraphrased that correctly.

3642400,5,B001HN68ZU,"I would recommend this movie to all married couples. The level of effort placed in saving the marriage would still require self-denial that a lot of people would not be willing to put forth. That's what makes the plot so realistic and the transformation of such a stubborn husband so engaging to watch.

The performances were fairly good. The ending emotional performance was a bit melodramatic. But making up is usually exactly that - melodramatic. It's apparent that pulling the scene of discovery and preparation off (at the end) was challenging for the actress. But she did a good job in the rest of the movie.

Kirk Cameron gave a great roller-coaster-of-emotions performance. The obvious comic relief of the movie was in the character, Wayne. Arguably, this was pulled off successfully. I definitely like the actor's performances in the scene at the bathroom sink and in the hot-sauce scene at the table. Those were funny scenes. The only minor, minor criticism I could give those scenes is that they seemed to be thrown in for a quick laugh. Of course, the writer got the laugh out of me. I love those scenes every time I see the movie, which I watch every chance I get.",1367366400,,1177,4.736585365853658

There were scenes and characters that were totally irrelevant to the story (the firemen).  You couldn't get me to watch it again for money.  That was the most stiff and often poorly delivered dialogue that I've seen in a movie in a long time.  Guess what I do for a living?  I'm a screenwriter.  The easiest thing to fix in a screenplay is the dialogue, and the people that produced this thing should have let a real screenwriter give it a rewrite.  HORRIBLE.

This movie is about determining what is important in your life, what is important to fight for, and how to do the fighting.  The choices are not necessarily easy or even make sense.  Sometimes it takes faith, but the faith needs to be based on actual real life examples not pie in the sky dreams.  That is why it is important that in this story it comes from something external to the person.  The timing is also important.  When the thread is broken, repairing it may not be possible.  Of course where the breaking point is is not is not easy to determine, but as with someone who stops breathing you have a very limited time before the broken thread caused by inaction will never be mended.",1366502400,,845,4.192546583850931

All you need have is the desire to really make the changes YOU need to make within yourself.

It was as there was a seething irritation between the couple---but it was a bit of a shock----having no background as to how this developed.  Cameron's character was downright abusive....but the movie sought to offer no justification for this (other than a perception of a lack of respect)..it just started from that point.

I watched it with my wife and we could not get through 30 minutes of it. I've endured less excruciating pain during a root canal.

I didn't see her as a person that was really into Christian movies either, so I had to see what the fuss was about.  Wow!  I was totally blown away by the message in this movie and it really opened my eyes about how strong, biblical values can really transform your relationships.  While the emphasis was on marriage, I really feel the message can apply to all relationships.  Yes, I am still a little skeptical that you can turn a deeply soured relationship around in just a short time, but I love the writing/dialogue in this film and how it shows that most relationships don't start dying overnight, however much it might seem that way, and that it is rarely all the other person's fault.  This movie really makes you think about how God's word and presence is so important in a healthy marriage, but I also love the emphasis of personal accountability.  The production quality is on par with a made-for-television production, and the only actor's name I was familiar with was Kirk Cameron, but this was insignificant.  This is a must-see movie that will transform you and your relationships.",1360195200,,1198,4.671428571428572

A friend of mine told me about the book..briefly telling me that she saw the movie that compliments it (or vise versa ;)
I purchased the book ~ but the one for couples...and love it...my husband and I read it daily (which is how it is designed).

I purchased the movie about a year later.  With the first viewing it seemed awkward watching it because it's not ""super-Hollywood"" ~ it has a home-movie quality with the first viewing (after that, you know what to expect)...

This movie is just absolutely fabulous.  Brilliant writing.  Excellent plot.  It's funny yet has a depth that can only the Spirit can inspire...  Michael, Caleb's right hand man at the fire station, super-glue's a set of salt and pepper shakers together to demonstrate his point on commitment in marriage.  When Caleb gets ready to pull the salt and pepper shakers apart, Michael tells him to not do it...saying that if he tries to pull them apart now that he'll break either one or both of them.  Brilliant.

The bonus features should not be missed...  ""Wayne on Wayne"" is my personal favorite :) although ""Fireproof in 60"" is hilarious, too :)

3642529,5,B001HN68ZU,"I have to say that I thought that the movie was on point, period. I beleive in God and with this movie I feel and completely understand what the message is saying. People everday think that they can plot their paths on their own without God in their lives but what THEY don't understand is that life wasn't designed that way.

Thing are going to happen due to the forces in the world that WE ARE NOT EQUIPPED to handle. Examples? The shootings that are occurring both the ranm ones and the ones that are being done in the heat of the moment type of situations and the so called matters of the heart violences and deaths, and don't forget the suicides and other murders occuring everyday sometimes over silly things lika can of beer, a quarter, or name calling etc.

If we are not equipped to handle these thngs then who is? GOD is! Grant it the movie deals with marriages but the chaos and the results are the same, which is that they aren't favorable.

I don't admit to living within the will of God but I do understand how not living in Gods will can reflect on the hardships that come my way and can see how others lives can be affected the same way for the same reason as in the above.

As far as the technical stuff it actually never dawned on me to even take notice of that stuff. the message to me was about the people and not the problems and issues that lots of people are commenting about on how the movie was made. Frankly I simply wanted the message and that was all that my attention was focused on getting.

The movie to me was really provocative and if you just listen to the message you'll get it.  The setting between the average man and woman in a common marriage doesn't depict every marriage but then it does depict the average problems that most marriages face as far as opposition between partners each wanting what they wanted as individuals and even then not thinking or putting God first and the consequencies for not doing so. Depicted in the movie is the rewards of what can happen if we follow Gods will for us.

As long as we choose to listen to ourselves and be swayed by our own thoughts and emotions true peace and happiness will stay out of reach.

Indeed because of the incidences of infidelity and the divorce rate of today it might be safe to say that we as a society aren't doing too well in the marriage  department nor with social relationships.

If you can see past the movie and just listen to the message I think that many could come away with a new understanding but how many are willing to let go of their own free will enough to let God take hold of the reigns in their lives though.

The first and foremost problem in virtually all of our lives is that we really think that we are actually in control. We tend to easily view and break the one scripture in the bible that defines just how not in control we really are and that is the one that plainly states for us to not lean to our own understanding!

The way of the flesh is selfserving, it's without forgiveness and it has the tendency of being deceitful, destructive, hurtful, conniving, dishonorable, greedy, deceptive, vindictive and so many other things that the Spirit Of God is simply devoid of!

Not only is the flesh weak but it needs supervision and guidance from a higher power to sustain a healthy balance of decision making.

Look past the movie and put yourself in the situation,or perhaps at the very least compare the situation with your own, most of us are there already though many may not want to acknowledge it. But the message itself is simple and plain to see.

The bottom line is that given the statistics most of us do live out of the will of God otherwise the statistics that supports the high percentage of divorce and infidelity wouldn't be what they are today. It's also what prompted the movie.

If most did live within the will of God the statistical data that supports the very fact that many don't wouldn't be what it is, because most would then be living in marriages more compatible with scripture.

The movie for me was very provocative in a moving way. It opened up several avenues of thought like, not putting God first in both my relationships and my overall life, treatment to my partner and hers to me, my overall destiny and the path that it's on without Christ functioning in my life etc.

A Very Special Thanks

This movie was an amazing tool to help us understand one another. We had not talked in weeks to one another and after we watched this movie together it upended up endless discussions. The crazy thing if it all is we have friends who are in a very similar situation and they had watched this movie the night before we did. They called us about 15 min the movie was over and it was nice to know that other people experience what we are and that there are tools to help you open up to talk about issues.

3642556,5,B001HN68ZU,"This movie is light on the prince charming marrying the princess and living happily ever after theme that is so prevalent with nearly all other love stories.  It stays deep in the gritty track of real life selfishness, ambition, temptation, loss of puppy love idealism that is commensurate with real marriages.  It does align solidly with a Judeo-Christian reference for justification of the plot as the marriage is 'salvaged' which is noteworthy as that is the actual origin of the basis for the marriage covenant.

When Kirk Cameron appeared in the first two minutes, I said ""Uh oh.""  The next three or four minutes of scenes and dialogue were completely inane.  ""Am I going to waste my time watching this?""

I jumped one or two chapters ahead, at random.  Cue a scene in the fire hall where two experinced firefighters just finish the daily truck inspection with a rookie.  The dialogue was so far from reality of an actual fire department that I answered my question with a firm ""Not a chance.""

I have been working on repairing my marriage for 2 years and although things were amicable, we never got back together, UNTIL I watched this movie! In those first 2 years, I was in the ""first 2 months"" of the main actors roll... So, I got off the fence and laid it all on the line with courage displayed in this movie and I watched as her jaw dropped over the next 2 months. Many of our friends and family still can't believe we worked things out. I'm so glad I saw this movie! I even purchased Courageous, which I believe is the next movie. It also came highly recommended.

I'd HIGHLY recommend this to anyone wishing to repair or strengthen their relationship, even if it seems doomed, such as mine was... THANK YOU!!! My kids thank you, too. My fiance just smiles in pleasant amazement, most of the time... ;-)

Or you could go to a shrink and hope to work things out that way, after spending mega bucks and time.  I tried that and watched things continually fall apart. It was my idea, but now I won't go back unless she suggested it. This movie's concepts, some other relationship programs to study at home, my courage and perceverance and her open mind seem to be doing the trick as we continue to repair and grow, after almost 5 months... I'm still amazed as I keep watching the progress, even though I put my foot into it, periodically... LOL",1353456000,,1505,4.481751824817518

Those of us that have experienced similar transformation in our lives can testify to that fact. It's great having a movie to enjoy that emphasizes those values and has none of the normal Hollywood trash to contend with.
The only criticism I have of the movie is that the dialogue is a little phony at times in the delivery. Have you ever noticed that, when you're talking to somebody, especially somebody close like a spouse, you don't typically say their name every time you address them? There is a little too much of that going on here, and it rings a little phony. Some of the acting and dialogue seems a little too stiff, scripted, and unnatural, if you know what I mean, but it's still enjoyable.
The story line is interesting and relevant. I will watch it again.",1351123200,,899,4.555555555555555

The movie really reinforces the concept of loving your spouse even when the other may be difficult with actual steps to help prevent divorce and rekindle a marriage. My wife and i had troubles a few years into our relationship and we could certainly relate to some of the struggles that do build up and boil over if not stirred. A relationship isn't easy, but its worth it when you find a person you can comfortably be yourself with and you both genuinely care for.

Kirk Cameron brings his powerful acting skills to the set of this Sherwood production, which naturally sets this one apart from their earlier films. I enjoyed the other movies, but the acting made them hard to believe. Cameron made scenes believable, especially ones where he was in his wife's face screaming at her. That scene would not have worked with their usual cast.

Our church played this movie on our annual marriage retreat. Most of us had already seen it, but it was powerful to watch it in that environment too. All married couples need to see this film.",1349049600,,617,4.660550458715596

3642677,5,B001HN68ZU,"Fireproof is a great Christian story about love, redemption, and honoring the bonds of matrimony.  So many times, you hear stories of Christian marriages ruined by lack of trust, pornography, infidelity, money, etc and the characters in this movie are no different.  They are both young, career-oriented people who allow the pressures and stresses of life to get in the way of what should matter most in their lives - God and eachother.  Even as their marriage is rocks and ready to come apart, Calb (Kirk Cameron) rediscovers his faith, with the help of his father, and works to rewin the heart of his wife.  A beautiful love story without turning into the sex-filled dramas that Hollywood churns out.

They are either responders or reactors.  She was reacting to his behavior.  Once it changed and he could be trusted again, the change came to both.  In the Bible men are commanded to love their wife as Christ loved the church.  Women are not commanded. They are commanded to respect their husband.  The husband has to earn that respect because women will respond or react.  Well I could go on but this was a great movie that showed this well.

3642680,5,B001HN68ZU,"In this day and age, it is nice to watch a movie that actually has some substance. Although it is not a movie with top name actors and a lot of special effects, etc; however, it is a movie that will make you reflect on being a better spouse and inspire you to want to seek God and live according to His word.  I think this movie makes a very good point about taking a Chrisitan approach to marriage without being fanatical or shoving an agenda down anyone's throat.  Many movies these days do promote agendas and certainly do try to shove other viewpoints and lifestyles down our throats...this movie is inspirational without being overboard.  I applaude that.  God created us and the Bible is the guideline on how to live.  Movies like this remind us about that and try to show the positive results that we can get when living according to scripture.",1347235200,,851,4.5

""The Dare"" which is the main focus in the life of a troubled young marriage headed for divorce, forces you to examine your own life your own faults and how you still can make it better even if you failed before. It has everything you expect from this series of Movies and plenty of action. You will be touched, moved, laugh and cry.

I have to admit, it takes a few minutes into the movie for the actors to get into the swing of things, but they do.  A few times what they say seems scripted, but it does show you how ridiculous it is when you say those things.

Overall, great movie.  If you're not religious, you will still enjoy it.  It may even get ya thinking.  (I know it did for me.)  If you are religious, it will put in perspective how good of a person you think you are vs. how well you really do treat the people around you.

There's a lot of lessons to learn here.  It actually inspired me to do the LD for my husband (don't tell him, though!).  :-)

It may well help people defuse potential difficulties when they are small rather than when they are almost irreparable. For Christians ministers and those involved in counseling it offers a realistic presentation providing multiple issues for workshopping. The 'Love dare' book with the film, which I use, make a powerful combination - one can be really flexible and add or delete sections as your circumstances require.

3642693,5,B001HN68ZU,"I haven't read any of the negative reviews because I don't want them to tick me off. This movie was fantastic and rarely in my life has any film impacted me emotionally such as this one. I cried probably 4 or 5 times throughout this movie because it ws so powerful and touching. Yes some of the acting wasn't the best, but these people were all volunteers. Yes the production wasn't the best, but the budget was only $500,000.

But having said that the true quality of this movie with its relevance and positive impact for our lives is far greater than the biggest 250 million dollar blockbuster churned out by Hollywood. I'd rather see more films like this one than a thousand Avatar's.

UPDATE A FEW MINUTES LATER:
Ok, I read a couple negative reviews and now I am ticked off. I knew I shouldn't have read them. Granted these folks are certainly entitled to their opinions, but every negative reviewer missed the point of the film. They either criticized the acting and production, which I already addressed earlier. Or they criticized the message, which again they missed the point because of their own shortsightedness. For instance, over and over again from Christians and non-Christians alike you will read people saying they are upset because the turning point of the film was all about money. When in fact it was Caleb's unselfish act of giving up something he wanted to give his wife something she wanted which was the real point. Heck, its not even something for her. It was for her mother. So she is selfless too. So the reviewers are stuck on the money issue, not the film itself.

For the folks who criticized the acting quality and production...who cares? Take Avatar for instance. Huge budget and huge money maker right? Well, take all the fancy effects away and what do you have? Basically a modern day Dances With Wolves. I think Avatar is a perfect example of the idiocy of the masses who will shell out money to basically be numb for a couple hours so they can escape their messed up lives and never really change or improve themselves at all.

So the real difference between the 5 stars and the 1 star reviews...the reviewers issues within themselves.",1345593600,,2171,4.660574412532637

And perhaps some points they try to get across are a bit exaggerated, but that's just fine with me--it gets the point across in marvelous ways.

Every husband should see this. Perhaps wives, too. There's too much divorce in this world! We are all too proud and not willing to really give ourselves to our spouse. We treat marriage like a piece of clothing that we change when we tire of it. I hope this movie changes many lives.

However, I cannot discount a lot of the truly bad acting in this movie, most notably Kirk Cameron's dad, the woman who played Catherine, and ESPECIALLY ESPECIALLY that doctor whom she ends up having an affair with. They were supposed to be having a steamy affair, but there was acsolutely ZERO chemistry between them whatsoever, and the whole thing just seemed contrived. Catherine just ended up being annoying to me. That doctor is probably the worst actor I have ever seen in a movie.

First of all, this is not a chick flick at all. This film is very much about christianity. The reason I say it is offensive is that the theme of the movie is that people cannot truly love one another unless they love the Christian God first. As someone who is not christian, and whose roommates worked so hard convincing me to watch it, that is a very negative (and false) message. Furthermore, the acting and script are just awful. For much of the movie the actors appear to be just reading cards and barely put any emotion in at all.

During that ensuing point of jeopardy, the story depicts the bumpy journey the husband takes to win back his wife's heart. NOT corny. Well told and honest, this movie is a truthful reflection of the current pressures and prevailing attitudes which do threaten and undermine couples. The story underlines how fragile loving relationships are; and restoration and renewal does happen when one seeks and listens to God's written words prompting us, within the context of relationship, to continually offer forgiveness, thoughtfulness, kindnesses, gentle responses, reminders of His love and beauty.....These are not merely robotic actions to perform as if they are a formula, but rather, as in this movie, one must struggle until these actions spring from the heart.

Here's the deal:
1. It was anything but cheesy. Dealt with real life issues and had great messages like saving your marriage. I was glad to see that not everything was working out for the main characters, happily ever after, even at the end. Their lives weren't perfect and it made the movie real. Shaped my view of marriage a bit.
2. It got a bit preachy at times but it all fit with the story and it wasn't bad. It portrayed the gospel well.
3. Really appreciated a great movie that wasn't super cheesy but didn't have any foul language, sexual content, or racism!

3642717,5,B001HN68ZU,"As I watched the first 20 minutes of this movie, I couldn't help myself. ""That's us!!"" I said. This was a tough movie to watch at first, I must admit. However, that's because it starts out with exactly the sort of marriage we are in. Though not as bad as it used to be, it's far from smooth. Sleeping in seperate rooms, hardly any communication. Little respect, arguments over nearly everything. We live it daily. Yep, those marriages do exist outside of hollywood. Probably more than most people think, maybe even some of your close friends or relatives.

That said, we were inspired by the movie, and it definately can impact those who are willing to watch it with an open mind. For those who find themselves criticizing it, I'd ask you to watch it with an open mind toward the purpose it's set out for. I believe you will be inspired.

For us, we continue to take it one day at a time, and I read when I can. Pray daily, and continue to have patience.

Within a very short time the story had me so involved in the characters lives that any minor flaws were not noticed. As in their previous movies, the Kendricks brothers had me crying, laughing, cheering, and, during the action sequences, on the edge of my seat.

Being a Christian, I was not turned off by the message(s) of faith in Christ that are an inherent part of Sherwood Pictures productions, and I didn't feel like that aspect of the movie was being shoved down my throat. It is presented, laid out before the audience, and is there for you to take it or leave it. If you find occasional conversations about God, Jesus, or spiritual matters offensive, then be warned, you may be offended on occasion. I'm sure there are plenty of movies at your theater that push loose morals, profanity, and obscenity that you can choose if this is not your cup of tea. But if a message of being good, kind, and loving doesn't frighten you, I highly recommend this movie.

At times I saw myself on the screen, as most of us can relate to some level of tension in marriage (or any relationship). The principles behind the message can work in most situations - whether or not you are a Christian. And I believe people of any marital status can learn valuable lessons from this movie and be entertained at the same time.

An interesting side note - I heard in a couple different interviews that Kirk Cameron auditioned for this part like all of the other volunteer actors, AND was a willing volunteer himself - pretty much quieting the skeptics who claim he (and others) were making this movie to line their pockets.",1334534400,2,1744,4.583333333333333

I admit I asked my husband to watch it with me to see if he would want to do the love dare after viewing this film.

If all couples who are planning to marry would sit down together and watch this, then really talk, preferably with their pastor, they would probably have a more successful, happy marriage than without it.

Sherwood pictures/the Kendrick brothers did a great job on this film . . .  and this is no ""chick flick."" My own husband is an ""ice-hockey playing' macho man"" and he loved this movie lol!

EVERYTHING YOU NEED IS HERE IN ONE MOVIE:
Action, comedy, some suspense, drama AND A BONUS: REAL tools to help make your marriage work. This film/message is timely and contemporary and Kirk Cameron does a good solid job in the lead male role. Cameron plays a well respected fire captain with big problems on the home front including a pretty bad addiction or two (of his own.) He's quick to rush into a burning building to save strangers - but not so fast to put effort into his home life. In fact he's selfish, mean and sarcastic to his beautiful wife, who is being pursued by a Doctor she works with. The movie is made by Christians and has some Christian moments, but it is suitable for those of ANY religion. If you pass this by, you miss a GOOD MOVIE!

There is no inappropriate language or content, which is very refreshing. You can see this on a date, or watch it with  your mother and NOT BE EMBARRASSED LOL! :)

3642757,5,B001HN68ZU,The main purpose of this film is to follow a couple through their journey to faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour of their lives. The different scenes show the various stages that they go through. I found the film to be in the high standard that the Kendrick brothers started with in Flywheel and continued through to the newest one Courageous. The acting is believable and the direction is thoughtful. This film handles some difficult issues with truthfulness but with great care. You will find that you watch this one over and over again.

It was Christian heavy for the most part and that could turn some people off to this film but I'd hope not even if you are non-believer. As another reviewer posted, we were also turned off by the ""money factor"" $25000 bed and wheelchair that seemed to ring the bell for the wife to reunite with her husband. I guess the message was intended to be that instead of buying the boat he was thinking of her family but still, bad taste in our opinion. The acting certainly had it's ups and downs as well but we weren't so much distracted by the bad acting as we were amused by it. I was a little hardened at first by the the depiction of man as being the ""root of all evil"" but I liked the swerve at the end of the film when the father reveals to his son that he was the one who actually was going to leave his mother. Certainly evens things out that both sex are subject to fault and sin. I certainly left this film thinking of how I can be a better person to all.",1331078400,,1086,4.009216589861751

I bought all 3 movies they have made thus far and I will post the same comment as to each. They are great. Don't stop at just 1. Buy all 3 and loan them to friends and family who need to hear the message of God. I wish that we would see movies with this type of message in theaters with award-winning actors willing to sacrifice the million-dollar paychecks to share God's Word. Not because I long to see better performances, but because more people would be drawn to church if headliners would act in them.

Only through striving to live to a higher standard can we hope to have successful marriages. My wife and I enjoyed the realism of this movie and the promises it gives. This was an AWESOME movie because it was not fictionalized nor a HOLLYWOOD fairy tale cookie cutter movie with predictable outcomes and sensationalized content. It was touching and spiritually uplifting. If you are a Christian working to become a better example of a husband and father this is the movie to see.

Anyway, atheist or not I can enjoy a good movie regardless of its content. The Ten Commandments is one of my all time favorite movies. Fireproof on the other hand is littered with bad acting, and its plot is as predictable as can be. To sum it up: Homeboy Kirk Cameron's character cannot save his marriage unless he turns Christian. It's a shame Kirk Cameron didn't stay a comedic actor because he sucks when tries his hand at serious acting.......Bad acting, Christian propaganda, trash movie!!!!",1329264000,16,661,4.8584070796460175
3642772,1,B001HN68ZU,"There is an entire film genre known as The Retreat Movie, familiar to anyone who has ever attended a Catholic school and has had to sit through made-for-TV-ish ""message"" movies (drugs are bad, pre-marital sex is bad, drinking is bad) during sophomore theology. ""Fireproof"" is in that category,although it's geared toward married adults instead of tenth graders. The message here, of course, is that anything that distracts a couple from a monogamous, God-centered partnership is bad. Once those distractions are conquered and God becomes the focus of the relationship, the couple can take their marriage to the next level and give themselves to each other, while spreading the love to the rest of the world...or at least their co-workers.

I have no quarrel with that premise, but the other element of the Retreat Movie is that it has to be kind of amateurish and corny and predictable...and ""Fireproof"" is all that.

The script plods along, recited by actors who are clearly reading from the Teleprompter (except for Kirk Cameron, who SHOULD know something about acting after practicing ""the craft"" for decades).

The soundtrack is a bit grating (Christian rock--mellow tune with heavy-handed lyrics), and the set designer must have been color blind. No wonder Caleb and Catherine are cranky: I'd have a migraine two seconds after walking into their garish faux-homey house.

The other genre this film fits into is the Firefighter Movie. Full disclosure: my husband is a Chicago fireman, and his commentary while watching other firefighter dramas has, over the years, been very instructive. There aren't many that are realistic, and cops probably say the same thing about police dramas. Anyway, he refused to watch ""Fireproof"" with me, after I described a couple of on-the-job scenes to him.

One such scene involved a one-story house completely engulfed in flames, which of course draws the fullest response of the ""Albany Fire Dept."" Caleb rushes into the (flaming, but miraculously smokeless) building to rescue a young girl who is unconscious on the floor. He immediately removes his protective gear, including his oxygen mask and coat, and covers the child, and then he--impervious to the heat and able to hold his breath for a number of minutes--kicks out a window. The window happens to have burglar bars, so he can't get the kid out that way, so he chops a hole in the floor--exerting a great amount of effort STILL without having to take a breath, while fire boils across the ceiling and timber crashes down around him--and then pulls her out of the house via the crawlspace.

In all this time, not ONE fireman has run around to the back of the building to help Caleb. They're all clustered in front, watching helplessly as the house burns to cinders.

It's also interesting that this small town in Georgia gets more five-alarm fires in a week than a large metropolis, like New York or Chicago, gets in a month. It's like the town in ""Murder, She Wrote,"" that had record homicides on a weekly basis. Maybe arsonists retire to warmer states like Georgia.

The guys on the fire department aren't exactly drawn from real-life, either. They're all BFF's who occasionally play amusing, but character-building, pranks on one another. They have matching towel sets in the bathroom. I doubt any workplace in the world has such great chemistry--but hey, when you save your colleagues' lives a dozen times a month, that's probably a very bonding environment.

Anyway,(SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!) Caleb and Catherine seem to be on an express train to divorce court when Caleb's dad gives him a journal containing The Love Dare, a 40-day (significant!) process that saves Caleb and Catherine's marriage. Caleb (""Color me skeptical"") agrees to follow the book's instructions, and lo and behold, Catherine finally overcomes her mistrust of his motives and opens up to allowing their marriage to heal.

I guess ""Fireproof"" is okay, if Retreat Movies are your bag. It doesn't quite meet the bar set by the classics I saw in Catholic school during the 70's, though. And I've pretty much seen them ALL.",1328745600,18,4089,5.017699115044247

3642778,5,B001HN68ZU,"When I see that all the critical reviews of this movie are based solely on it's ""quality"" as far as acting and scripting and all the technical things go, it really disappoints me. I'd think that by now we could properly judge a movie based on its moral value...the value that matters. Isn't that why we go to see movies? Fireproof has done this ten times better than most other High-Budget Films that have all the bells and whistles and ""good"" scripts (and ironically, usually a complete lack of any substantial story value).

To be honest, I didn't even notice many of the things the critics are griping about...probably because i was more interested in actually watching the movie.

Anyway. The quality in this film comes from its message, which is worth all 5 of those stars by itself. This is the first time I've seen a movie that spoke so deeply about conflict in marriage and the supernatural healing brought to the lives of people through faith in God. The characters speak true to men and women today, and the dysfunction that comes in many relationships that are based off of conflicting and selfish expectations rather than God.

Let me tell you, it was truly refreshing to see a movie like this have such depth and richness to it. It offers insight into how true love works, and how even a hopeless situation can be turned completely around by faith. It also offers a sobering view of marriage and all its hardships for us hopeful singles ;) While also offering hope and joy at the prospect.

Fireproof is truly a unique movie...it's got a treasured place on my DVD shelf now.",1328054400,2,1587,4.617021276595745

The reason why I give this movie at least 2 stars because its going against divorce and leading towards Jesus Christ which is center piece of all things. However, the wife in this movie *sigh*; You're talking about ungrateful. This man is risking his life daily and trying to save his marriage while this woman walking around being ungrateful, discussing their business at work (wrong place). Yes, we all have our downfalls and issues, but I have to give her husband some credit for at least trying while most are willing to give up. Even after the fact, he continues to show love towards her, ask for forgiveness, and she had the audacity to say ""I need some time"". Later, after she discovered it was her husband who bought the bed, she decides to stay. This display ""love when conditions are met"". What if he didn't buy the bed, will she still "" need time?"" I respect a man who's willing to change for the better, focus on God and try to make it right.

After all, the Hollywood stars generally don't risk this type of subject, and the budgets for these films do not run into the 10's and 100's of millions dollars.

What is important is the message, not the stars and the budgets. So, with no caution, I recommend that anyone struggling in their marriage, as well as anyone concerned with making sure their marriage is on track, consider this video. It contains solid acting, good camera work and lighting, and a message of faith, which after all is the important part.

None of us truly knows what goes on in other households, what struggles come to bear, what the long silences between spouses would tell if they could talk, or what heartache exists between people who pledge to love one another. This movie takes just one scenario and brings it to life. In it we can see how good intentions can be destroyed by reliance upon material desire, failure to openly communicate, and failure to consider the pain of the other spouse.

Seeing it may risk one coming to see the value of their spouse and their marriage in a brand new light, and may, in some cases, bring a troubled marriage back to life.",1326758400,8,1279,4.552173913043478

There are tears, but also laughter.  Helps to show us that we are responsible for ourselves...we need to work on our personal relationship with God before we can truly work/change our relationships here with others.  Also shows us how not to be performance-based in our love for one another.  We need to love the other person in spite of their sin.  Condemning, controlling, & manipulating only makes things worse.

I have never seen this movie before, but I heard the raving reviews, so I went ahead and put it on. You could say I'm looking for change in my life.

This movie gave me a lot to think about in my marriage and in my personal life. I was so touched by the story and husbands persistent love, it inspired me. What inspired me the most is how the story and the directors were so able to bring the love of Christ into the midst of it. The husbands circumstances, cruel and unforgiving, and his resolve in the midst of them are a mirror of the love of God. This movie has actually painted the best picture I have ever seen of unconditional love, and mainly God's unconditional love, and has set a standard in my life that I want to live for.

3642822,1,B001HN68ZU,"There are a number of poor elements that make this movie really questionable.

First off, the soundtrack is lackluster and seemed to be a couple of musical groups who volunteered their material. Not a horrible problem. Movies get by with bad or even non-existent soundtracks.
Second, despite what other people are saying, the acting performances are amateurish. Bad acting would imply something that I'm not trying to convey. They are not acting and they are not being natural or documentary. the acting seems poorly directed and has a melodramatic quality about it.
Third, The pitch and repetition of the phrase ""Jesus"" is absolutely ridiculous. This movie has 'Towering religious saga' written all-over it.

If you are a person who likes to hear only what you want to hear, if you like modern evangelical Christianity then this is a movie for you. If you're a regular, average person who likes movies, I don't think that you will appreciate this cinematic stink-beetle.

I like a good low-budget movie and this is batting 1/2. Its low budget. An analogy for clarification. Christian rock is to Rock and Roll what this movie is to Hollywood. If you see Christian Rock as a tricky way to seem cool and get kids into church, you'll see this movie trying to accomplish the same thing. If that's your thing, thats cool. This movie is directed at people like yourself.

When I turned the movie off, my wife said ""I was hoping you were going to do that."" Of course, she was raised Catholic.",1318032000,16,1485,4.7890625

The first half of the movie is watchable, even with the bad acting and generic plot, but then it takes a turn, the second half of the movie is WAY too preachy, the story is lost almost completely and it turns into Sunday school.

3642826,4,B001HN68ZU,"This movie punches above its weight.  The production values, dialog, and acting are nothing remarkable, but the film has an emotional core that is compelling and rewarding, particularly if you have ever been through a divorce.

The only real negative I have, is that while Kirk Cameron gives a decent performance, he just doesn't have the physical presence to be believable as a firefighter.  He almost looks lost in the hat and uniform!  Plus the movie would likely have had all the more poignancy if a bigger tougher guy had learned the path of unconditional giving and love.  But overall, that is a minor point.

P.S. Re. the whole evangelizing thing: if you're not a Christian, all you have to do is view the movie as a story about love and marriage that just happens to be set within the context of contemporary Christian culture.

3642827,1,B001HN68ZU,"I did not really like this movie and i did not like how the christian community as a whole gobbled up this movie as one of the best movies ever.

The problem with the movie is that the wife is not a very likeable charecter.  Ok the guy was into porn that was not good and in a marrage that can really mess things up. but then again he TRIED and TRIED and TRIED to go out of his way to work things out....and the woman still was cold to him and even considered cheating on him.

The message basically is that men you have to roll over backwards for your wife.  I don't think this is a good message

I think a marrage is a partnership and its not about men having to bow down to the wife it should be a partnership sure the guy was a little bit of a jerk at the beggining but he TRIED to change. I think only superman could have kept doing what he was doing and having his wife keep rejecting him

Its really a biased and unrealistic look at what a marrage should be in all honestly i think the couple should have considered a divorce its clear the women only wanted him as long as he was Mr Perfect.  and only at the very last moment did she accept him after he did EVERYTHING EVERYTHING for her.

So basically this movie is saying that Love is a man bowing down to a woman.  Im sorry I don't see that.

and the problem is most christians are going to use this movie to cram down peoples throats (mostly this movie is directed at men) it was most likely a movie orginized by a bunch of church women in order to get their husbands to do what they want.

I dislike this movie and if your a woman i am sure you will love this movie but youd have to be very shallow to not see how bias this movie is!

I could have produced a better christian movie with one eye closed. This one is just preachy to the point of extreme

why cant a christian movie be good without having to be overly preachy?

Decent production values but you can still tell that the movie was not the greatest production wise

and no offense with Cameras that can produce good cinematic video and independent films that really have great cinematic even with not a huge budget it would be nice if at least they had that.

But to me it felt like a lowish budget ""preachy"" Christian movie.

update: i give this one star simply for the fact that yet another christian movie that has a huge missed opperuntity.
i don't GET why you modern christians THINK this bs is so great.  the women in the movie the wife is NOT a likeable charecter. tthe film screams low buget (you think they could have hired a bit better cinematographers even lower end tv series today have better cinematics then this)

This basically says that in a marrage a woman can treat a guy however she wants. and even if he tries to bend overbackwards to change for her. she can still treat him like a complete b*tch until he magically does that one thing to get her to turn around even though SHE was the one almost about to have an affair

and im sick of the whole christian push on pornography bull for the record pornography often can be used to SPICE up a marrage if you don't have some insecure woman who is so shallow to think her husband doesnt want her just because he looks at porn

come on.

this is for all the christian chicks out there to throw at the men as to why they their marrage sucks

it takes two.and this movie is completely one sided not at any time during the movie did the women say ""you know what im kind of being a stuck up c*nt as well .......we should work together and work this out............
yeah

but hey these days in order to make a great christian movie just put ""christian themes in it"" and people will eat up the crap.

3642829,3,B001HN68ZU,"This film puts a spotlight on the touchy subject of divorce, and demonstrates how God can redeem a marriage that would have ended if not for His intervention. Fire Captain Caleb Holt has been married for seven years to Catherine (""Cat""), an attractive young woman who works in public relations at a local hospital. Caleb is a respected leader at his job, where he and his squad extinguish fires and risk their lives to heroically rescue injured accident victims. But at home, he believes he gets no ""respect"" from Cat. During a series of intense arguments between them, it becomes obvious that Caleb is pulling out of his marriage.

He won't communicate with Cat about his whereabouts, and won't buy groceries or do any domestic chores on his days off. Without consulting with her, he's squirreling away a large portion of their income for personal pleasure, and blames her for working too many hours to recoup what he's drained away from their savings. He's disappeared from the marital bed, choosing to fulfill his sexual needs by watching internet porn. When confronted about his behavior, he goes off on an angry tirade and screams at her, ""What's the point of this marriage!"" before storming out of the house, beating a garbage can in frustration. Posturing himself for the divorce he's sure is coming, he attempts to coax friends and family into believing that Cat is the one who really wants to end the relationship.

In order to appear that he's willing to try working things out, Caleb tells his folks that he'll work on his marriage ""only if Catherine wants to"". His dad convinces him to try ""The Love Dare"", a Christian marriage challenge program, forcing Caleb to begin acting unselfishly toward his wife for the first time. At first, Caleb just wants to prove the self-help course is a wasted effort. But after some time, he strangely begins to hope that it really will repair his marriage. Caleb begins striving to obtain Cat's respect by actively sacrificing his priorities and agenda to her needs, rather than by demanding his rights.

Caleb's horrible attitude, words, and actions seems to have created the entire problem in this marriage, but as the plot progresses we find out that Cat has her own set of weaknesses -- stubbornness, pride, a seeming inability to forgive, and unbelief. Without giving away too much of the story, suffice it to say that she faces temptations to sin that are just as compelling as the ones her husband has fallen to.

Overall this movie carries a strong Christian message that doesn't beat someone over the head. I liked that a lot, but I do have several criticisms of the film. As we watch Caleb deal ""treacherously"" with his wife, much of the first half was hard hitting and tough to digest, and since the movie also ran long, I was unable to watch it all in one night. In agreement with Amazon reviewer JR Corry, I was also rather disappointed that the film focused much more on Caleb's spiritual awakening than on Cat's, to which only a few scenes were devoted. This film serves as a lengthy exposition of Ephesians 5:25-26 and 1 Peter 3:7 (i.e., the Christian man's role in marriage), but doesn't provide much Biblical wisdom for wives. Cat's faults, and the effect they had on Caleb as he tried to win her back, were quickly brushed aside. I know there will be many who disagree with this statement and therefore this review, but I believe the script was biased to appeal more strongly to women who feel fed up with their husbands.

This movie begins in the midst of full-blown marital meltdown, so we're only really getting half the story. Because Cat has a pretty nice diamond ring from her husband, we might assume Caleb had once been kind, loving, romantic and generous towards her.  However, during the first years of their marriage, and even before kids came along, his heart towards her grew cold and hardened. How did this happen? There is no explanation; the viewing audience is completely left in the dark about the origins of Cat and Caleb's marital discord! Did Cat ever love and respect her husband? If so, what was Caleb like when she did? Did he ever love her, or had he always acted like a jerk? Because the movie makers have premised that the unraveling marriage is a direct result of the couple's lack of faith in Christ, they've decided the details don't really matter and they are above having to explain it further.  I'm sorry but I find that condescending and rude -- and I'm a Christian.

I think the subject of marriage and divorce is a challenging one to tackle. To me, the script was very tasteful and for the most part, the screenplay was skillfully acted and produced (even those most of the ""stars"" were amateur actors). Heavier scenes were skillfully broken up with light hearted moments. I loved the action sequences involving the firemen rescuing people out of perilous situations, and the message about ""never leaving your partner behind"" as a tie-in to the marriage theme. The story upheld many Godly principles, so it's no surprise the film became popular some years ago within the Christian community. For those reasons, I liked this movie.  I wanted to love this movie, but some of the drama was narcissistic and immature and at times, dragged the plot down to the childish level of daytime soaps. More concerning, there was too just too much important content missing from the story to gain my approval.

At its conclusion, the film gave a plug for `Covenant Marriage' (over `Contractual Marriage'), which I agree with as a spiritual value. However, entering into a 'Covenant Marriage' legally, which is possible (as an option) in a few states, is not the best way to adopt that value.  Reports show that having government compel couples to remain legally married doesn't prevent divorce. I think marriage should remain a sacred covenant before God, legally recognized and affirmed by the state. That said, I don't think the state should play the role of compelling married couples to stay together.  You can't legislate morality in all areas of life!  If anything, it is the church's role to help couples work their problems out, and not the courthouse.

That said, this movie will help some people and will inspire more, so with reluctance, I recommend it to those who would like a general picture of what it might mean to love another person unconditionally through a Christian marriage relationship.",1315872000,,6397,4.793103448275862

3642836,5,B001HN68ZU,"A lot of people failed to understand what this movie really is.

First and foremost, the personalities of the man and woman are portraying extreme right and left field of women and men. They are only two types of many. I believe they were trying to emphasize women tend to be more emotionally invested and most men predominantly reason with logic. This doesn't mean all men and women are this way.

Secondly, from the Christian standpoint, "" you cannot give what you don't have,"" the father said. God designed marriage to be a reflection of our relationship with him. Thus needing to know how to love like Jesus to love our partner the same. I agree with the person who rated one star that the turning point should have been the computer to say I love you more, although in either case, It's saying, "" I love you more than my desires of the flesh (the porn, the boat, and money).""

From a secular perspective, many marriages fail because people don't want to work and compromise and learn selflessness. I can't exactly say It's not a perspective of Christianity, because that's how we were all designed whether you believe or not. We are wired to fail if we are selfish and flourish if we are compassionate.

That's basically the message given in the movie. The budget of the movie made it subpar to multi billion dollar Hollywood movies, and the acting for some characters wasn't perfect, but let's face it. I'm a harry potter fan and either was the acting of Daniel radcliffe. The strength of this movie is the message. It's not about a book, or even their personalities. It's about a transformation of character and how it makes one person better for it whether the other responds if not.",1314576000,,1691,4.607973421926911

3642841,5,B001HN68ZU,"Fireproof was a wonderful story about love, marriage and commitment.  We found the film to be very realistic to life's challenges and sensitive to each partner's feelings.  Sometimes we are so stuck in our own individual pain that we lose hope and give up on the marriage and each other.  Sometimes we say things we don't really mean to ourselves and each other.  We are too proud to admit our own feelings or that we really didn't mean what we said to our partner.  Instead, we hold on to our pride and then the marriage just slips away one moment at a time.

This film was beautifully done.  You could honestly relate to the frustration, anger and hopelessness this couple felt.  Ready to give up.  The couple shows every human emotion that one can experience when going through  a difficult time.  Then something miraculously takes place but not without a cost.  And so this movie presents a marriage that is missing its mark and exposes the changes needed to be made to make things right.  It couldn't be achieved half heartedly and it couldn't be done overnight.  It also wasn't dependent on getting anything in return.  It was dependent on facing your own addictions and making things right with yourself before you can make things right with others.

Kirk Cameron is not believable and the ""chick"" is not a good actor either. Kirk should stick to ""Way of the Master"" evangelism since he sucks as an actor. The story is a load of crap. Christians divorce more than non-Christians, and they lie more than non-Christians. Christian women are more prone to cheating and having affairs. This movie portrays a bigoted view of life and puts the ""bible"" as the answer to marriage. What a load of crap. If that were true, then you would find ""perfect"" marriages in any Christian home and no Christians would get divorced. The movie does not show what happens in real life. The chick would have slept with the doctor and banged all the interns. And then lied  and said she never cheated. And then kicked out Kirk. And then divorce him and take his home and car. And then say how she is a good ""Christian"". And then get knocked up by some ""sugar daddy"". That storyline would have been believable.

But after having seen a few Christian movies, this one leaves me feeling like the evangelical arts community is still hard of hearing at the call to true artistry.

3642860,3,B001HN68ZU,"This is a great film. Unfortunately, the acting, with the exception of Kirk Cameron and a few of his firefighters, was below sub-par. It's too bad, and I was *very* close to stopping this movie, for the suffering my wife and I were enduring with such bad acting....  However......

I *didnt* stop the DVD and we continued watching.... we are both very glad we did... by the halfway point, this movie and it's acting improves phenominally. The plot is predictable at times, but does have a few twists that were surprising....  the only flaws in this film are the acting and screenplay.

Moving beyond that, read all the positive reviews here.. This film *can* change your life...  it resonated squarely with our own marriage (even down to the 7 years) and although not as critically wounded as the characters marriage was, both my wife and I were affected and moved by this film greatly. It hits home for anyone who has been married for more than a few years.

HIGH RECOMMENDED, but please DO accept the sub-par acting through the first 20 minutes... the story WILL grab you and you'll praise this film by the time it ends.

EDIT: I've just discovered that the cast (except Kirk Cameron) were all local people of the town and a local church in Georgia where movie was filmed, etc. and were volunteers. Thus the lackluster acting... Also, K.Cameron volunteered his

3642871,3,B001HN68ZU,"This movie is about a fireman who's marriage is falling apart and takes advise from his dad.  His dad gives him a diary of 40 things to do in 40 days to show your wife that you love her.  The fireman follows this very carefully even though his wife initially rejects his love gestures.  Oh yeah and during the middle of this movie the fireman becomes a born again believer during the middle of the movie and everything turns out peachy king for this dude, when his wife finally decides not to divorce him.

Some of the positive things that I want to say about this movie is that it is better than most Christian movies.  The first one that I watched was Left Behind, which seemed to have a low budget and bad scriptwriting.  Kirk Cameron and the main actress do a good job acting.

This movie did not seem to have an extremely low budget, but the scriptwriting is still pretty bad.  It didn't seem to be realistic.  I am not saying that everyone should cuss, but couldn't they have some slang words.  Also, the story itself was unrealistic.  So, Kirk Carmeron looking at some porn ruins his marriage more than his selfish behavior.  WHAT??  And he only apologizes for looking at porn?  And what about his wife?  I think that she was as much to blame for their bad marriage as he is.  Part of love means accepting someone for who they are, and her husband is just not a sensitive guy who will talk about her father dying after he has risked his life battling a fire.  That is what your female buddies are for.  And the dude she wanted to have an affair with.  Please most women can see men like that a mile away.  Why not show a sensitive nice good-looking man, that women would really want to have an affair with.

WARNING: This may offend evangelicals.  I hate all Christian movies where they try to sell the Gospel.  Kirk Cameron becomes saved and everything in his life falls into place.  Please give non-Christians credit nobody believes that; everyone in life has ups and downs.  Even Buddha with all of his positive thinking still died.",1300147200,,2042,4.439353099730458

Yet this is the first time ever that I ever really believed a character was angry.  When Cameron becomes angry at his wife early in the movie and starts yelling at her, I cringed because I really sensed that this was not acting, but that he really was ballistic at her, like a line had been crossed from acting to real anger.

I've never sensed this before, but Cameron let me sense real anger, anger that I myself have felt.  It blew me away in a sort of scary way.

3642875,2,B001HN68ZU,"As a conservative evangelical Christian of 42 years, who at one time lived in the Bible Belt, this movie was saccharine, disappointing, and even disturbing at points.  Faith/Spirituality films are difficult to pull off successfully and Fireproof proved to be the case.  The movie's theme line--a struggling marriage of non-religious, white, thirty-somethings living and working in Albany, Georgia--sets the backdrop for marital redemption based on the efficacious power of unconditional love and forgiveness--the emasculated Christian gospel message.

A frustrated and angry Capt. Caleb Holt engages in chronic criticism of his wife, Catherine, for not doing more to make their American-dream and his self-center lifestyle function more smoothly.  The childless couple lives in an overly-large, expensive home decorated 'to the nines', drive new vehicles, but are alienated and devoid of marital intimacy.  Sound familiar?  While expectations for living the materialistic ""good life"" are ubiquitous to America, this cultural paradigm is greatly amplified throughout the southern United States and portrayed throughout the movie.

While beautiful Catherine is ensconced in sinless innocence, she unjustly suffers verbal abused and mistreatment from her immature and insensitive husband.  As things go from bad to worse, the couple toys with divorce as a solution.  In stereotypical fashion, the estrangement and absence of sexual intimacy drives the ignoble Caleb to fits of rage and online pornography, while emotionally-vulnerable Catherine is innocently drawn toward a winsome, young married doctor at the local hospital, whose intentions are less than honorable.

Caleb's white-haired father intervenes in an effort to forestall the divorce with a ""40-day"" marriage improvement program for Caleb.  When Caleb's half-hearted application of the program fails to soften Catherine's heart, his father further shares the core values of: knowing God, unconditional love, and forgiveness.  Eventually, Caleb changes his mental perspective regarding his own failures (repents), embraces the pre-packaged message, and become the town hero by rescuing a black child from a burning building.  Ugh!  Disgusting storyline/script writing.

But the real turning point comes when Caleb expresses his love in the form of spending his $24K boat savings on medical equipment for Catherine's mother.  For Catherine, and millions of women, love and commitment are most often measured in dollars--more being better--and her heart warms over Caleb's sacrifice of what previously mattered to him most.  In a reunion, Catherine expresses interest in Caleb's new found faith and verbalized her willingness to accept whatever changed him.

However, a final revelation emerges when Caleb's father confesses his own failure of spiritual/intellectual leadership, giving credit to Caleb's mother for having rescued their own marriage from divorce using the 40-day program.  Characteristic of American southern culture, Caleb's mother is honored as a paragon of redemptive and matriarchal virtue.  End of story and they all live happily ever after...with Jesus' help.  Sadly, this is not life in the real world.",1298851200,6,3182,5.814655172413793

3642879,5,B001HN68ZU,"I have read countless reviews of how this movie portrays men in an ugly light or how the message is as follows: you can ""buy"" your happiness.  Here is what I feel these people are missing:

When the main character, Caleb, is ""bending over backwards"" (as some have called it) he is doing it because he promised his dad he would.  He is not doing it out of love.  He has no heart in his actions...he is doing what he ""thinks"" is the right thing to do but he is only doing it to say he did it (a selfish act).

Love is selfless...look at the cross.  That is the most selfless act there is.  And we are called to a selfless love.  Ephesians 5:25 says that husbands are called to love their wives as Christ loved the church-not to literally be crucified for them, but to a love filled with selflessness!

As for the issue of porn, of course the wife is mad about that.  That is because porn teaches us men that you women are things to be used for our kicks.  We learn that it's OK to use the opposite sex for our own pleasures...and when we get done with that one or bored, we just go to the next one.  What happens is that guys get what's called emasculated...Emasculation is when a young man is robbed of his ability to be masculine.  If you look at the crucifix, that is masculine, giving of yourself for another person.  What porn does is the exact opposite.  It flips it around and teaches guys to get the ladies to empty themselves for the sake of ourselves and we miss the whole reason why God made us men.  It wasn't just the act of him looking at porn, but the way that she began to be treated as a result of him looking at porn.

So, maybe when Caleb destroyed the computer the wife started to think that things could change, but she wasn't convinced.  But when he finally put his selfish desires for a boat (that his wife didn't want in the first place) she finally realized that he was putting her needs in front of his own...and as she cried she realized that all this time he really was trying to love her.  It wasn't about the money...it was that he emptied himself for his wife as Christ did for the church!

I'm in no way saying that the wife is innocent.  I believe she should have forgiven him sooner and I think she was ""emotionally"" cheating on her husband with the doctor.  I believe both of those things (as well as Caleb's sins) are human desires that need to be confronted.  I think this is a beautiful example of how when you build your relationship on Christ-like love, selfless love, you can overcome whatever problems you are having.

My only criticism of the movie is that it is pretty unpolished as far as cinematography and acting.  But...I don't think the movie was made with that focus.  It was made to shed light on what can happen when you invite God into your marriage and keep him as the center of your relationship.",1298419200,,2849,4.2785046728971965

3642883,5,B001HN68ZU,"Free will is one of the most incredible gifts we have received from God and with it we can choose to marry, but along the way of life we often make other choices that create a gap between us and our spouse.  This movie reminds us that that no matter how large and deep the chasm between us we can choose to bridge that gap.  We have no control over the actions of our spouse, but we can control what we do and how we react to things. Even in the most dire of situations it can begin with a leap of faith. This movie reminds us of that fact. You are not in it alone.  In marriage while two become one the relationship requires both people to do the work day in and day out. One person can't keep it together on their on, but one person can start the relationship on a journey which encourages their spouse to follow - in the end it is their choice but through your actions you can remind them that your love for eachother is worth choosing everyday.

Thank you to the makers of fireproof for reminding us all that love is a CHOICE and that it is worth CHOOSING and worth the the work to make it grow and flourish over a lifetime together.",1297728000,,1137,4.085201793721973

But I guess if its a Christian movie, and its about stopping a divorce we are all supposed to clap and cheer and rave about it.

It is for those who are contemplating marriage or who may already be in a marital relationship.

With Kirk Cameron (Growing Pains) leading the charge as the hot-tempered Fire Captain Caleb Holt, this movie I believe will definitely be a hit for years to come.  Caleb is the type of firefighter who loves to be in the limelight with his hero status among the community and his men.  His wife Catherine (Erin Bethea) is the type of co-star that definitely accents the marital troubles they are facing.  At one point Catherine decides that she has had enough of Caleb and asks for the divorce he is seeking.  His father puts him to the test with a ""forty day love dare,"" so that he can learn that marriage isn't always about his needs.

 Fireproof

 The movie Fireproof starring Kirk Cameron is a heart twisting movie. Kirk Cameron who plays Caleb is a fire Captain who will do anything to save peoples lives. He lives by the code: Never leave your partner behind. Although he may seem like a hero at work he is far from one at home. He is letting his marriage burn right to the ground. Throughout this movie you will see a change in Caleb. With his father encouraging him to follow and trust the Lord, you will be flabbergasted by the end of the movie. Throughout this movie you will shed tears, laugh, think about your relationships, and learn that God is your rock.
 In the beginning of this movie Caleb is a very lost soul. He is addicted to pornography, and does not treat his wife with respect. He does what ever he wants at home, and has his own rules. The Bible tells us that we should respect our spouses in Ephesians 5:22, 28-31. The way that Caleb is treating his wife it way out of line. I like that this movie is showing men and women how they should be. They show how you need love, and respect. God plays an important part in this movie. It shows that once you have God in your life things will fall into place. It also shows that you will have a love like never before.
 Once Caleb realizes that his wife wants a divorce he talks to his father about it. Now his father is a Christian, and wants Caleb to be one too. When his father tries to talk with him about God he gets irritated. But his father really wants to help save his marriage. Marriage is not just some useless thing. Marriage is a special bond between you and your spouse the Bible says in Ephesians 5:31-33 For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become flesh. God takes this seriously and so should all of us. When we have to take care of each other we can not be selfish. We need to work together, and grow together. We should know hoe the other works.  Even if  your in a relationship, and not married you still should be respectful.
 Caleb's father asks him to do something called The Love Dare. This book puts you through different trials. You have a Bible verse for everyday, and something you have to do for your spouse. At fist Caleb was resistant to this idea but then decided to do it. While go though agony because of the things he has to do you will laugh like never before. You get to see a funny, and good side of Caleb. His co workers know about his condition so they try to give him advice. There are a few scenes that just shock me every time I watch this movie. I laugh over and over like it was the first time that I have seen this movie.
 Although this movie will make you laugh it will also make you cry like you got your finger caught in between a door, and the frame. Caleb realizes that he needs to put his heart into everything he does to win his wife's trust. He also realizes that God has helped him, and wants to be saved. His wife has no clue why Caleb has been changing. All she knows is that she is done, and  is going after another man. Little does she know he is already married. Caleb finds this out and gives this man a good talking to. Caleb starts to do some very nice things with all of his heart for his wife. Now she is really confused, just as anyone would be. You will feel the pain in your heart for them both, as if it were happening to you. I don't know why but this movie even makes heartless guys shed a tear. This movie can really move you. The way this movie presents itself is just amazing. The grace of God is shown so well, and you feel the love of God just touch you.
 Towards the end of the movie Caleb catches himself in a sticky situation. He puts all of his trust in God, and he make it though. He is just being molded into a new and better man everyday. I love how the movie showed that you are able to do anything when God is on your side. In the Bible it tells us not to be afraid of things and to put of faith in God. In Isaiah 41:10 Its says, ""So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."" The movie really gets into depth with this.
 At the end of the movie Caleb and his wife are happier than ever. You can see how their lives have transformed with the help of God. They were once lost, and now they are seeking in God. This movie goes through some emotions you would never even think you hade. They end up going to church together, and love the Lord. They also love one another like never before. This movie is a wonderful example of how your everyday lives should be.
 This movie will make you toss, and turn at night. No because its scary but because it makes you think. It challenges everything you know how to be. It will make you think, and make you want to change. It has a very powerful message for people to see. This movie is filled with so many different elements its hard to just name a few. You will cry, you will rearrange your thoughts, you will laugh, you will learn things about God, and you will have a new out look on things.  This movie will show you things that you will never forget, and make you want to share it with the whole world.",1296691200,,5317,4.133591481122943

3642894,5,B001HN68ZU,"My review is more of a review of a couple negative reviews of this movie. The two negative reviews I noticed both pointed to the wife not accepting her husband's change of heart until she discovered he paid for the hospital bed and wheelchair as being evidence that the wife was materialistic. One of them said something to the effect of this sending a mixed message. I believe the movie painted exactly the right picture of this type of situation. The husband had been changed from the inside out by God Almighty and the wife, until that point at least, had not. The wife still had her doubts about any real change in her husband. It took finding out that he secretly paid for items that her ailing mother desperately needed to make her realize the change was real. It wasn't until that that she desired the same change in her own life. If he had bought her a corvette I'd say there was a mixed message but anonymously spending the money he'd been saving for a boat on her mother's health needs was an act of love. There's nothing incompatible with these messages at all. The husband was transformed by the love of Christ and chose to mirror that love whether it was received or not. Showing that kind of love without any evidence that it would be reciprocated to his obviously unregenerate wife caused her to break down. I believe they were depicting a woman who not only recognized her husband's transformation was genuine but also realized she was no saint herself. I recommend this movie highly. I've watched it multiple times and every time I have a renewed appreciation for my own wife who, other than Christ himself, I consider to be the greatest blessing I have ever received.",1295395200,,1685,4.582781456953643

He overcame his sin but she was paid to leave hers. While I believe an honest attempt was made to make a good movie, the story line got sucked into today's mainstream thinking.

In my friend's search for what it means to love and to build a love that lasts, this movie made a big impact in his life.

There are plenty of posts that explain what his movie is about, so I'm just going to touch on a particular issue I had with it.

******SPOILER ALERT BELOW******

To tell you the truth, Catherine wasn't worth all the work. The new Caleb deserves better. I understand that she had not touched God yet, but you don't have to touch God to have a heart. I understand that she is upset at him for 7 years of neglect, but her reaction towards his continued acts of kindness would make you think that he beat her like a pinata every night for 7 years. From my observation of their interactions early on, it is clear to me that she is at least 50% of the problem in this marriage. Yet, the whole theme is that he is sorry and the conclusion is that she forgives him. A monster of a husband could have received more warmth by day 20 than he did. Heck, even the father couldn't believe how long it was taking for her to warm up. The guy had his hand on his mouth in disbelief in one scene.

Let's put into perspective the type of husband Caleb was the first 7 years: he watched porn and he didn't always listen to his wife; jeez, if real women graded on as high a scale as Catherine, nearly all of us would be out on our behinds!

From a religious perspective, I realize that I might be missing the point, but I believe this review is useful for those who are not religious and might have the same line of thinking as me.",1289606400,3,1849,4.271428571428571

But God brought me a woman that loves the Lord and now we have ""Fireproofed"" our marriage. This movie is a great help to begin the process to properly re-focus where your attention should be in any marriage- God and your spouse.  TV, Hollywood...the world, have been telling us quite the opposite. Pretty obvious they are wrong.

3642920,5,B001HN68ZU,"REAL LIFE MARRIAGE REPAIR 101:

Fireproof is by far perhaps one of the most important movies anyone who is either married, or thinking about marriage can watch. The story line is incredibly well written and follows the life of a struggling married couple as they plunge toward divorce. The course of events in the movie are typical of millions of married people who believe that their marriage isn't working and want out. Watching this marriage heal is absolutely amazing and the principles portrayed are are great guideline on how ""ice cold"" hearts of the self absorbed can be thawed and real life marriages can be repaired.

Fireproof will take you on a bit of an emotional ride as it is interspersed with a very small but just the right amount of humorous scenes to break things up and keep you locked in. When people say that the acting was bad in this movie, I believe it is because people are so used to having at least a small dose of profanity in every movie that when watching Fireproof, something seems to be missing but they cannot quite put their finger on it. The few corny scenes take up about 5 minutes of this fantastic movie, and they may even seem a little out of place, but they help to break things up. The acting in this movie was well done. If you don't like the movie, look elsewhere, perhaps at your attitude toward relationships or your views about spirituality.

Whether you are currently on the brink of divorce after decades of living in a ""bad marriage"" or newlyweds who are still riding the high new love, watch this movie. If you are in a bad marriage, you might want to watch this movie alone at first. You can always watch it with your spouse later. Either way, you will never regret watching this movie.

The main characters start out as unbelievers and eventually turn to the Lord for help. Atheists will probably get upset with this, but it's a Christian film so live with it.

The main driving force behind the film is no matter how bad a state a marriage is in, there is still hope, especially if you are serving the Lord. Marriages don't always run into problems over-night, but there can be gradual erosion over a period of time. Therefore the fix will also take time.

3642926,4,B001HN68ZU,"Christian movies are a new way of touching lives, and are being used more and more. Facing the Giants, Car wheel, Faith like potatoes, and Fireproof are one of those Christian movies. Fireproof can be used in excellent ways to evangelize and encourage Christians through the acting of the talented church members, the everyday life story in which we can all relate, and the place of God in our lives when everything seems to go wrong, that are seen in the film.
Contrary to what a lot of people think, the acting is really talented, knowing that most of the actors are volunteers and not professionals.  Just like I said, most of the actors in Fireproof, and other movies made by the Church, are volunteers who are not getting paid, and are simple church members. Of course, the movie would not receive a price for the best acting, but it is not as bad as people can say. Though they are not professionals, they still deliver the message that is supposed to be delivered and we can feel their emotions. Kirk Cameron is one of the actors in Fireproof, and he is a professional actor, which adds to the fact that the acting is pretty talented.
Having normal people as actors, and an everyday life story helps you apply the movie to your own life easily; you can identify yourself with the actors. Just like every couple on earth has problems in their marriage, the story is about a couple breaking apart. The fact that it is church members who are acting makes it again easier to relate to them, they are just normal people, simple church members who also have problems. You can relate to the story if you are a couple and also if you are single, because the movie is not only about a love story but also about sin, pornography in particular.
The only thing that I reproach to the movie, is that, even though you can do everything with God, the end is a little too ""cheezy"", in the way that it Christian life is not always easy, and it doesn't always finish with everything going great.
Taking into consideration that we all have problems, the movie shows that through every circumstances of life, bad and good, God is with you. This can be a real encouragement for Christians who are struggling with sin, with their marriage... It shows the real problem of sin, and the difficulty of overcoming it, but in the end, with God's help, Kirk Cameron overcomes pornography and shows his wife he loves her more. The message of the movie is that whatever you are going through, you ""can do all things through Christ who strengthens you"".  It can also be used as an evangelizing tool, to touch people's hearts. The message of salvation is exposed at the cross scene, when Kirk Cameron decides to follow Jesus. People might be able to realize, through the movie, that without God, they are weak.
 The acting of the talented Kirk Cameron and volunteers, the story to which we can recognize ourselves and the message of love and hope transmitted through the film make of the movie Fireproof, a real encouragement for Christians, and a useful evangelizing tool.",1285113600,,3047,4.5974264705882355

3642928,2,B001HN68ZU,"First, yet not all that important when considering the message of the film, the acting is TERRIBLE.  The movie was recommended by a friend for the message and I bought it without reading/watching the trailer.  Had I not been interested in only the message, I would have turned off this movie after the first 20 minutes.  I was expecting the plot of a man finding his faith and was disappointed by a man overcoming selfish behaviour.

I agree wholeheartedly with the message of this film, but you do not get the complete message without the book...SURPRISE...written by the same people who wrote the script.  It makes me wonder if the Kindricks' intentions were to boost book sales by releasing a ""companion"" movie.

That be said, unless you want to bolster Christian film sales, you may want to purchase the book and leave the movie on the shelf.",1284076800,4,846,4.72108843537415

3642931,5,B001HN68ZU,"This movie is an awesome tool for marriages, relationships, commitment, and many more things that involve serving, and getting along with the human race.. We have watched this movie so many times(my husband and I, and also our children have watched this movie with us and it is their favorite movie, ours to), and each time we enjoy the entire movie and the acting to the fullest.

When you look at marriages today, so many people want to through in the towel. Many forget that Marriage is work, and you work hard for what you want everyday, you meet people and treat them nicer than you probably treat your spouse.. But at the end of the day, what many don't realize is that your spouse is the one that matters most, as that is the person who has your back and will be there for you no matter if you are on top of the world or on the bottom, all they see is the person that they love.

Too many people today don't want to work for anything, they want everything handed to them and enter marriage to be served and not to serve. Your household is your first place of service, ministry, commitment, hero of the hour, etc... Many people don't want to understand that marriage is work or either they do understand but don't want to do the work to keep the marriage together. The funny thing about that is that they work hard at everything else, jobs, friendship, sports, people that don't even like them, they are trying to win over everyone but their spouse, they think the grass is greener on the other side, but don't realize that the grass has to be kept, and mowed. You have to take care of that grass to, or it to will turn brown, dry out, weed up, grow tall and wild if you don't keep care of it... Same thing with a marriage, you have to care for it, take care of it. I think that the movie covers all of this.

You have to realize that your mind can and will play tricks on you, along with the enemy to have you thinking something that is really not true. When you see things that you think you are seeing or even if someone comes and tells you something, stop and think before you act buy this movie and the love dare and look at it. Think about how many times your job has gotten on your last nerves.. have you quit your job? What about that habit you are trying to break, have you quit that? Point made, why would you give up so easy on your marriage? I think this movie should be seen by everyone before and after marriage and through out the years of marriage...

We must wake up and set our morals and values straight. Learn to work through the good and bad. You will love this movie and the Love dare, we sure do! And we share this with everyone that we can! Go ahead and fireproof your marriage and others as well!

This movie is for all marriages, good, bad, divorces, thinking about getting back together, separated etc.. It is also for singles and anyone involved in relationships

3642939,5,B001HN68ZU,"This movie about an individual's transformation can guide people to happier and healthier relationships.  I saw myself in this film at different stages of my marriage.  I didn't have the film's 40-day-steps to guide me through rebuilding myself, but the humbling of a failed relationship did bring me closer to God, family and self, my true self.  Once my faith relationship was restored, all other relationships seemed effortless. ""Fireproof"" strongly teaches us how to see ourselves and others as God see us.

I would strongly recommend to any couple at any stage of their relationship to sit down together and watch this life saving film.  I say life because there's so much more in this movie than just a lesson in making a marriage work.  The real relationship that is reconciled in this movie is a relationship with the Almighty.

If your relationship with God, family and friends is going well, then you might enjoy watching this movie for confirmation of what it took to make them successful. If you've committed to a relationship but things haven't been what you thought they would be, check out this movie and see if it addresses your doubts. ""Fireproof"" just might shed some light on where the love you thought you had for God or another person was misplaced or misled by you. And you'll be surprised at the place this movie points you toward in finding it.

It's definitely an instructive and thought-provoking watch if you're interested in building a relationship with a spouse/potential spouse and understanding the role that God/Jesus should play in that being successful.  It's disturbing at the beginning of the movie to see how broken the marriage of the main characters is and how little hope there seems to be for repairing that sort of damage, but ultimately the transformation and redemption is very believable and the message is awesome.",1276128000,,607,5.183673469387755

Things aren't so good at home, though; he and his wife have grown apart over the years and can barely tolerate each other.  Caleb is addicted to porn and hoards his money for a boat while she seeks the affection of a co-worker.

I was surprised by how much I liked this movie.  I usually don't watch Christian films, but this one is exciting, realistic, and has some fine acting.  Kirk Cameron has matured from teen heartthrob to middle-aged heartthrob and he's wonderful as the selfish husband.  All of the other actors were volunteers from a church in Georgia and were amazingly good for beginners.  The church pastors wrote, directed, and produced the movie. I was impressed with the high quality of the movie, considering it was made with a low budget.  There are thrilling firefighting scenes and all the characters are believable.

I feel that it is highly reflective on the Word of God about how a marriage should function, and it was also a very intense movie.  I will be honest that the first 20 minutes or so of the movie is really cheesy and poorly filmed.  However once you get past those first 20 minutes, you will see things like how pornography affects a marriage, how another man will vie for the love of your wife, how partners in marriage forget how to appreciate one another, how God is left in the background of a marriage, how some friends will give you secular answers to your marriage and will make it worse, etc.  Once all of these things are revealed, Godly answers are given about how to deal with the situation.  I can't say enough good things about this movie.  I promise you if you have faced rough times in your marriage that this movie will bring you to your knees before God, and restoration of your marriage will soon follow.

However, the message in this is very powerful. The idea is simple enough: love is not a feeling; it is an action. A marriage must learn to brave storms, both of a personal nature and of an external one, if it is ever going to survive at all.

Honestly, I don't think I would have held out as long as this guy's wife did. The computer smashing would have been the proof to me that he was for real. But I can understand why she would have held out longer thanks to the advice and goading of her ""friends"". There's a little interesting alternate meaning to this - beware of the friend that gives too much advice about your personal life without being asked.

My husband and I both learned a lot from this movie. Despite the poor budget the story itself was very engaging. We both cried at some parts and laughed at others. We are both so totally psyched now to read The Love Dare for ourselves. This movie is a great preparation tool for the book if the book is anything like it is in the movie.

But, my number one problem with this ""film?""

*SPOILER ALERT*

Her main issue with him is his pornography problem.  The director/writer ABSOLUTELY should have used the computer killing scene as the turning point.  Having her ""discover"" what a good man he is because he spent $24,000 on a bed for her mom makes this about money.  I was truly disgusted at that point.  Those two scenes should have been switched, so she could say that she ""can't be bought"" and that he showed himself a changed man by replacing his computer with her.

Caleb and his wife Catherine have been married for seven years, but lately arguments over career, housework, finances, and outside interests have driven the once-happy couple hopelessly apart. Kirk Cameron plays Caleb Holt and is the only professional actor in this movie. Since other parts are played by non-professionals, I consider the acting to be first rate.

Just a interesting fact of the movie: The actor in the end scene actually kissed his own wife. He didn't want to kiss another woman. He knew he only wanted to kiss wife, no one else.

3642964,1,B001HN68ZU,"So before I get into content, let me say that the ending was fairly cool -- because I'm a Christian.  But if I were any non-Chistian, I would have walked out of the movie.  But, if you didn't realize this was a Christian movie going in, you're a big dummy.

Next, mind you I just finished watching this movie 30 minutes ago.  It's 12:30 at night and I have to get up at 6:00am. I tell you that because I need to emphasize how bleeping ticked off I am.

There isn't one guy, who could honestly watch this movie, who if asked by another guy, what he thought of the movie would answer ""that was the biggest man-slamming, female dominated, liberal piece of junk I have ever seen"".

Can we just take out the Jesus parts for a minute?  I mean for the sake of discussion.  I love Jesus.  I am a huge fan.  But let's focus on all the other parts of the movie.  Kirk Cameron basically, in order to ""be forgiven"" by his wife (for watching internet porn, not doing enough around the house, not ""listening to her"" not ""communicating"" with her and for asking her to grocery shop) needs to prostrate himself before her royal majesty, smash his computer, donate his life savings ($26,000), buy her chocolate, flowers, make her candlelight dinner, make her coffee, do the dishes, Call her at work just to check-in, do the grocery shopping, convert to Christianity, give up on his dream of owning a boat, plus suffer the agony of being offered marriage counciling from his own mom and dad (who just saved their own marriage a year earlier. I mean really, really?

Oh, by the way, while he is doing all this ""sucking up"" or ""pennance for his sins"", his wife is majorly hitting on a another married man (a doctor, just to make men in the audience cringe even more)takes off her wedding band, serves him divorce papers, and scoffs at him bedside at the hospital while he is nursing a burn injury and being attended to by previously mentioned doctor)

The movie is so lopsided (as most marriages are post-60's) due to the mainstream fantasy of what a man is supposed to do in a marriage, everything.  GET OVER IT LADIES, HE DOES NOT EXSIST.  YOU WILL NEVER GET HIM TO BE YOUR SLAVE.  Kirk Cameron (whom I admire for his brazen hutzpah in regard to his faith) really let me down with this liberal drewl.

I'm not saying that there aren't some sick husbands out there, but of those real ""sickos"" how many are renting ""Fireproof"" and sitting down with popcorn with mama?  Gimme a freaking break.  Most guys that are watching this movie are sophisicated, frustrated and want to maintain the family.

With every action there is an equal and opposing reaction.  The queen had something to do with it.  Kirk is ticked off, but why?  Yes, possibly it is lack of fulfillment through Jesus.  But also likely, it's because of the fact that he is depressed with the economy, can't spend time with mama in front of the tv because all she wants to watch is Idol, Housewives, Man V Food, Wife Swap, House Hunters, Cribs, and all this other mind-rotting gluttonous, immoral garbage they feed us, heaven forbid she watch something the whole family wants to watch.

The guy is stressed that the dollar could crash anyday, our nation is involved in 2 wars, unemployment is at a 26 year high, national debt is over 11 trillion, budget deficits at 1.5 trillion, discussions abound regarding cap and trade, global warming, national health care, illegal immigration, stuff just goes on and on.....But now he needs to grocery not only be a Fire Dept. Captain and loyal husband, but also a housewife.

I would just like to see the director look at the queen and her faults if he is going to ""judge"" Kirk...  Have we become so liberal that we can't critique our wives?  Liberalism has destroyed the American family and the United States of America.  We all know it.  If in a marriage, we cease being two seperate bodies and become one, what is a body, without a head?  And what does the bible teach us about marriage? Who is the head?  The word used is ""master"". The husband is the master.  Liberalism has it flipped on its head.  The female is ""the master"" and the respect for each other is in the toilet. Man knows in his soul he is master, but she does not respect him as so.  She knows that she is not master, but pretends to be - sheepishly.

Fireproof does nothing to be fair and equitable.  Man was born to lead and serve the family, the female made to support the man. This marriage, is a marriage only Hollywood (a liberal, man bashing, man hating Hollywood) could create.

It is not biblical, it is false teaching.  Men, stand up and be men.  Women, confess your faults and support your husbands.  Kirk did show he was the master, by making all the sacrifices to save the marriage - but ladies,  if Christ sacrificed for us and we sacrifice back to Him shouldn't the same happen in our homes? What did the queen sacrifice?  Not sleeping with a married man?  Not following through with a divorce?  I mean, think about it.

3642969,5,B001HN68ZU,"I will never be able to write a review that gives enough credit to this movie.  We received a promotional packet in the church to present it to the congregation.  I purchased the movie because it sounding great - kind of like a chick flick for couples gone awry,  I thought it might give some value to the married folks in the church and the adult class chose it for a dinner and movie night.  Shockingly, it is incredibly emotional.  My husband had tears in his eyes and said that there was several occasions where he felt he needed to go to the men's room.  But we were not the only one's.  There were two other couples that did loose it during the showing.  The pastor said a quick prayer after it was over since so many had swollen eyes and obviously not up for conversation about the movie.  Several of us stayed over and discussed getting the kits that go with it.

The next day I ordered enough for a class and scheduled a study group for the next two months.  The kit is awesome too.  Our study group used the books to help spur conversation and life changing advise.  This was truly one of the best ""Bible"" study classes I have attended.  There is nothing on earth as important as your relationship with God and your spouse.  If you put God first in your life, He will help you with your problems.  He will heal your wounds, and that feeling of teenage puppy love will come back to a 15 year marriage.  I am living proof of that after this movie and program!

I also purchased a copy for a separated couple, the church library, and a couple other couples.  This is a movie, like the ""Passion of Christ"", that is worth purchasing just to make sure the director's, writers, cast, etc know that this type of movie is valuable and will be supported!

This is a movie that will be on the ""top shelf"" in the bookcase.  This is one of five movies that will not go with the other family movies.  It must be cared for and cherished.  I know that my husband and I will pull it off the shelf occasionally, ""to put things in perspective and get back on track with the important things in life"".

3642984,1,B001HN68ZU,"(UPDATED on April 9, 2012)

Most recently, Provident Films and Sherwood Pictures (the folks responsible for Facing the Giants, Fireproof, and Courageous) lashed out at Steve Taylor's Blue Like Jazz, a film which approaches issues of faith with brutal honesty and respect, based on Donald Miller's bestselling memoir. For whatever reason, they feel threatened by the film, which is probably going to change the ""Christian film industry"" as we know it. Provident Films and the good people at Sherwood decreed that anyone who had participated in the making of Blue Like Jazz would never, ever work on a Provident production in the near future. You see, Blue Like Jazz is a game changer. It is an attempt to bring authenticity into the realm of faith-based film, and so far, the response from audiences around the globe has been extraordinarily positive. Looking back on my review of Fireproof (posted below in quotations) Blue Like Jazz seems like a godsend.

Here are a few simple truths that I learned from Fireproof: If your marriage is on the rocks and you simply cannot control the wellspring of anger growing inside of you, there is something that you can do: take it out on the trashcan. If that doesn't work, smash your computer - first the monitor, and then the tower. A baseball bat or a large stick should do the job. While you're swinging the bat and/or stick with one arm, make sure you have a copy of ""The Love Dare"" in the other. Keep a steady swing while you read. There are forty-something pages to read, one page for each day. Do all of these things, and afterwards, all of your problems should automatically disappear and everyone in your immediate family will get saved, just like magic! The end.

I have recently watched Fireproof again. People claimed that I was a bit too harsh on the film the first time around. Well, it all comes down to this:

I cannot believe that this is the best that we Christians have to offer to the film industry. This film is basically a tract disguised as a movie. I found it incredibly offensive and false. There isn't one moment of authenticity to be found in the entire film. As it is, there is only one audience for this catastrophe - an explicitly Christian audience. Any non-believer approaching this material is likely to feel alienated for the majority of the running time.

I'm not going to lie. Fireproof is terrible. From the dialogue to the acting to the production values, it is one huge train wreck. I understand that the filmmakers used what they had to work with. This is obvious. However, other indie filmmakers have approached projects under similar conditions with much better results. Don't get me wrong - I admire the church for pulling together and getting the film in theatres. Not an easy thing to do. But a film class or two wouldn't hurt at all. Maybe they could read a few textbooks on Bergman and Kubrick. Perhaps an in depth study on human nature would help with character development. The way in which the characters interact in this film made me wonder if the filmmakers had ever had any real contact with an actual human being. No one talks like that. No one acts like that. It was incredibly distracting. The heavy-handed Gospel message took me completely out of the film. This is the point at which the film stopped being an ordinary corn-fest, and segued into grade- A propaganda. A little subtlety would have been nice, and could have possibly lent the filmmakers some sort of credibility. Ingmar Bergman focused on faith a great deal, and although he dealt with the subject with a touch of ambiguity, he still said what he wanted to say, and it came across as a work of art, and a foundation upon which people of every background could discuss the issue of religion and faith. There are times when Fireproof comes at you like a fifty foot Bible - just waiting to stomp you over the head with its skewed portrayal of the Christian life. In the world of Fireproof, all of the conflict ends at the moment of spiritual conversion. This is an unrealistic, dangerous lie to unleash on any audience, believer or non-believer. The Christian walk is full of doubt and constant struggle. A commitment to God does not guarantee - and does not even promise - freedom from such things.

The Kendricks still have a lot to learn about the art of filmmaking, about human interaction, and, most importantly, the cold, hard facts concerning conflict in relation to the Christian walk.""

Upon reading this, some of you may feel that my critique of the film is a bit extreme. That's okay. My opinion is still the same and has yet to be swayed, and I sincerely doubt that I will ever sit through Fireproof again. The fact of the matter is this: the audience of today craves honesty, and so far, the faith-based film industry has failed to deliver on every conceivable level, opting to play it safe with squeaky-clean moralism and sermonizing, leaving little to no room for reality. This is a sickening trend in the realm of faith-based artistry, and the audience is catching on. The motivating factor which initiated this current fiasco with Provident Films and Sherwood Pictures can probably be summed up in one word - fear.

It's all coming to an end.

Blue Like Jazz has finally arrived.

3642985,1,B001HN68ZU,"Most all good-intention men want to please their wives. This film like much of the marriage material today gives a clear message of a wife's need for love. I can see why women watching this movie would give it a big thumbs up. But most men already know this and feel inept in this area. The story is only mildly helpful with that. There is no insight in the other direction of a wife showing respect(love) to her husband.

The movie waste no time in pointing out his faults as well as hers. The only difference is she wouldn't have faults if it weren't for him. That is a slap in the face if you are a male viewer. Another slap is this. The main character spends 40 days jumping through hoops for his wife only to win her heart by the skin of his teeth. This must melt the women viewers but from a mans perspective this gives the impression that most guys following these steps only have a slim chance of success. Putting him on the never ending cycle of trial and error. The end result then is a performance based marriage. Certainly not the biblical view of marriage.

Got around to watching it las night and WOW was I moved. A realistic story that low and behold was extremely entertaining and had an uplifting yet subtle message that moved me to thank heaven that some creative inspirational movies STILL exist. I explored the directors commentary and it explained how and why THEY were moved to make it. For a low budget move it is done very professionally actually using real church members in some scenes. This movie DOES NOT preach! It presents a very real scenario that even as a single person or ANY person, of any age, will find very uplifting and unique from some of the movies that pass for entertainment today. One walks away a richer person after discovering this gem. I only hope that the director and film company make more of these.

3643004,4,B001HN68ZU,"Not every movie has to speak to everyone.  For instance, I can't stand Stanley Kubrick movies-  I think he's an over rated hack.  And just like that, some folks are not going to be predisposed to like this film.  If you are predisposed to be an anti-christian bigot, this film will rub you the wrong way.  If you aren't married and don't care for marriage, this film will pass you by as well.

Technical merits-  yes, the reviews that say this would work better as a Lifetime movie are correct- although, I think this would fit better on the Hallmark channel. ;) Some of the special effects were a bit on the cheap side, but they weren't so bad as to distract from the movie.  My biggest technical pet peeve was not riled- there were no booms in any of the frames- something I see more and more often in professional big budget Hollywood movies- so the budget here did put some constraints no the picture, but it is more in the sense of constraint, rather than resulting in an appearance of amateurism.

Acting merits- Kirk Cameron was great- the rest tried really hard and none of them stunk. Holding this movie to the Hallmark Channel standard, and you can say they all put in fine performances- none were oscar worthy, but that's not really where this movie is aiming. The yelling scene at the beginning was believable- I'm sort of baffled by the reviewers that didn't get that.  Frustrated folks lash out- and some people are yellers.  Such is life.

Plot and Story-  The first twenty minutes of this movie are the hardest to get through.  Most films get you to like people before they throw them through the wringer- this movie does it backwards.  You won't like anyone in this movie for the first fifteen to twenty minutes.  Why?  Because this is a film about a marriage about to fall apart and when a marriage is that broken, no one in it is at their best.  We are presented  with two selfish, self centered people.  (Yes, two, for those that cheered for the wife the whole way through the film!) It takes a while to warm up to them.

The role of Christianity in the movie-  Christianity is a true Deus ex Machina in this film.  But, for those that experienced salvific grace, that's exactly what it is. This movie was made by a Church, so should you really be surprised that Jesus gets a starring role?  Isn't it more surprising that in a country as Christian as this one, that we don't see conversion experiences playing a larger role in more films than we do?

This movie will make you cry, without a doubt.  And any stupid thing you did to your spouse in the last week?  You're going to end up appologizing for it.  But that's what this movie is for- not to entertain, but to help people build up stronger marriages.  And in that, five stars is not enough.",1258156800,3,2767,4.434523809523809

I recall hearing a story, a long time ago, about an anguished man who went to a pastor friend for help.  ""I feel like there is a dogfight going on inside me,"" he said.  ""A good dog and a bad dog, fighting to the death.  And I don't know which one will win.""

""I know which one will win,"" said his pastor friend.

""You do? Which one?"" asked the man.

""The one you feed,"" replied the pastor.

3643013,5,B001HN68ZU,"Caleb (Kirk Cameron) is an experienced and highly successful fire-fighter, who save people on an almost daily basis, proud of what he does for a living, and apart from the fire-fighting his main focus is to save money for his dream boat.  He spends very little time with his wife Catherine (Erin Bethea), and when they are together, they quickly get into a quarrel and they both realise that they are heading for divorce.

Caleb visits his parents to tell them, that he is finally giving up on his marriage.  They are not pleased with this news and his father is asking him for one last favour, before signing the divorce papers that Catherine has already served him.  Caleb doesn't give it many chances, but out of respect for his father he agrees to follow a plan for 40 days, each day having to do a small task for his partner, like not saying anything negative for a day, doing some chore for his partner etc.  Some tasks are very easy, some quite difficult, and the fun part is to see Catherine ignoring the coffee he made for her, and Caleb trying to cut corners on the tasks, like buying the cheapest possible bouquet of flowers.  The religious element is there, but it is not dominating the film, so non-religious people can definitely enjoy it too.  The message is very clear; fight for your marriage, it will be worth it.

If your relationship is in trouble, buy it to learn how Caleb and Catherine got past their trouble, and if single; buy it for the entertainment and the learning process.

I watched it with my wife, we both found it very worthwhile, only a bit one-sided as Caleb is the one doing all the work in saving their marriage, without any movement or encouragement from Catherine's side.",1256083200,,1711,4.547231270358306

3643015,5,B001HN68ZU,"I complement any director and cast of characters who can make me openly weep at the end of a story.

I do not find that as easy to do as it once was in my youth.

This movie was that riveting and emotionally moving. Well in the same class as the first ""Left Behind"" movie. I continued to contemplate the impact and message clearly given thorughout this entire drama for hours and even days afterwards.

I started this movie, but then took it out within minutes of its beginning and decided instead to watch the other four movies I had ordered with it before coming back to it.

Later I realized that of all the five movies I watched over the next week, the real reason I had done that was that the beginning of the movie looked far to familiar and much to close to home in it's portrayal of the conflicts that existed from time to time in my own family and in my own life.

It actually hurt to see these characters doing and saying the very same things I and my wife had done and said.

But after watching Pilgram's Progress (an excellent movie for adults), Second Glance (a great movie for teens), Final Exit (a good movie for all ages)and Escape from Hell (another good one for anyone)...and getting the excellent messages they imparted (both individually and combined)...I returned to Fireproof and decided it was time to go from front to back and just tough it out.

I am very glad I did that. Because it has a message for every couple, individual and group of people who work together about how good and pleasant life can and should be...with the Love of Jesus Christ in ones heart...and the realization of the fact that we need him so desperately in our daily lives and that we can be forgiven and blessed...if we only surrender our own ""arrogant will"" and stubborness to him and live by God's design.

The very best way I can sum up this movies impact and ultimate message for each and every one of us...is to recite a poem located in an American Poetry Anthology Book I have on my shelf.

Its called simply ""The Gift"".

THE GIFT

God did not come
to be a king,
To teach us prophecies
or to make us sing.

He did not want
to recieve great wealth,
Or even ensure the
people's health.

He came to give us
a wonderful gift,
The helping hand;
A spiritual lift.

It is a very simple
thing he left,
The right and power
to forgive ourselves.

The message of fireproof is encapsulated in this poem and that if we fall to our knees and first ask for, get and then give forgiveness. Then we can ultimately forgive ourselves...and we can move on to make our lives and the world a better place.

But this only comes with submission to him and from living for him and receiving his grace...not from within government, powerful men or women, a court system, and education system or those who follow an evil path.

Only Christ can give you what this movies message offers...true peace, restoration and love. Watch it and see if you can keep from tearing up at the end...I dare you to be honest and receive the blessing.

To those who negatively evaluated this film...???????

God Bless all who watch and open their hearts. Great movie, cast and message.

3643016,5,B001HN68ZU,"I'm biased.  I'm Christian and I care greatly about having a fantastic marriage, so I loved this movie.  Granted, the acting isn't great, the special effects aren't mind-blowing, and the dialogue is preachy at times.  But it had some invaluable lessons that anyone, not just a Christian, could incorporate into any love relationship to strengthen it.",1255219200,,350,5.214285714285714
3643017,5,B001HN68ZU,"My husband and I watched this movie the other night. No, the acting is not Oscar material, but it's by no means unwatchable. Ironically that is what makes this movie believable and so touching. Real every day problems that our society's busy modern day couples face. The wife wants the husband's help around the house, the husband wants respect, and God is an afterthought (or not thought at all).

As far as movies go, I'm not easy to impress, but this is definitely one of my all-time faves now. Perhaps the God aspect came into my life just when I needed it. I'm a lifelong Christian but frankly, I have not made the time, not for church anyway. The movie is heavy with the Christianity, so if that talk puts you off, you may not like the movie, although I think even non-Christian couples could benefit from watching.

Kirk Cameron plays Caleb, a fireman who's marriage is on the brink of divorce. Caleb's Christian father asks Caleb to spend the next 40 days taking The Love Dare. The message is clear: marriage + selfishness = disaster, and what stood out to me most was a line Caleb's father said. Something to the affect of, ""Sure, according to your standards you're a good person, but God doesn't hold you to your standards. He holds you to His.""

And although I do my best not to cry during movies (stifle, stifle) I was a boohooing mess for about the last half of the movie. I could really relate. Even ole tough guy hubby had a couple tears.

I have had my share of hard times in my marriage, and this movie spoke to me effectively in this manner.

Compared to many movies coming out of hollywood, this one is not superb as far as special effects, writing, and other items like acting.  The acting is cheezy at times, and the dialog can be unnatural.  However, the moral quality is far above anything that hollywood would dare to produce.

3643038,5,B001HN68ZU,"I recommend Fireproof to anyone, religious or not. For me, this movie ultimately transcends it's weaknesses. In spite of some awkward acting and cinematographic weaknesses, this was a great movie overall.

I thought Fireproof effectively portrayed a troubled marriage and the factors that can cause that. In this aspect, the movie engaged me totally and made me care about the couple. I found the central message of the power of love convincing and emotionally moving.

If you are not a Christian in the same way the characters are, then I think this movie is still a worthwhile two hours of your time. First of all, it could teach you a lot about marriage and divorce. Also, if you are the type of person who appreciates the ability of movies, books, etc. to teach you about the entire range of human experience, then this movie is a way for you to try to see beyond the stereotypes and experience a little of how some religious people see life. That is a very valuable thing.

It is nice, too, to see (what seemed to me) respectful portrayal of Black people, more so than in a lot of Hollywood movies. Kudos to the filmmakers for that. That shows an authentic Christian attitude, in my opinion. Kudos to the Black actors as well - I thought some of the movie's acting was weak, not from any of the Black actors.

On the aspect of religion I thought the movie had some mildly awkward moments. Although, I think people who are already believers in the actors' exact version of Christianity would probably feel the awkwardness less and would appreciate the religious message more directly.

From what I've seen of movies with a religious message, it's is exceedingly hard to portray religious experience in an authentic way. (Maybe partly because there are so few models of how to do it in mainstream Hollywood moves, which are mostly agnostic or hostile to religion.) Either a religious movie becomes too didactic, or the actors fail to convey religious faith that seems genuine, or the movie fails to communicate effectively to those outside its circle of believers and break through to reach a universal audience. Perhaps it's also the intensely personal nature of religion that makes it so hard to translate into a visual medium such as film. Fireproof does suffer some from these challenges. Maybe the producers weren't even trying to reach a universal audience, I don't know. However, in any case I think this movie is a leap forward on the learning curve, as religious filmmakers try to find how to translate religious experience onto the movie screen.

I imagine there are a lot of Mormons who will hear good things about this wholesome, clean movie - but who will wonder about the religious aspects, since the movie is apparently sponsored by a Baptist church. Here's my response to that question:

As a Mormon I believe in Christ, but I'm not quite in the same circle of Christian believers that the movie characters seem to be in. However, the Christian aspects are pretty general, and the religious message did ring true to me. The characters could just as well be good Mormons, as far as I'm concerned.

The core of Jesus' teachings is love, forgiveness, repentance (i.e. personal change and growth), and unselfishness. I thought Christ's core message was communicated effectively by this movie.  There were several points where, as Mormons would describe it, I felt the Holy Spirit witness to the truth of what was being said. For a Mormon, that is the highest compliment you can give any movie.",1250899200,2,3508,4.7947019867549665

Through self-searching, forgiveness and new found faith, they begin to repair their marriage.  It shows the difficulties and beauty of relationships between husbands and wives, parents and children, friends and co-workers.

I read many of the reviews about this film.  The overall theme to them were that it was poorly executed, not up to ""Hollywood"" snuff and that it was too strong with Christian messages.

In regards to the first, I really didn't think it was all that bad.  I have seen worse ""blockbuster"" advertised films that spent ridiculous amounts of money with ""A"" list actors that fizzled to obscurity and ridicule (Waterworld to name just one).  Kirk Cameron was great in this role.  And I have to give an honorable mention to the couple that play the neighbors, they were quite funny and memorable.

In regards to the second complaint, I don't see what the problem is.  When I see a film I don't enter the theatre with a mindset of ""this is a secular film.""  I let it define itself in terms of script and message.  I have seen many a film that are no where near themed ""religious"" and have walked away moved by their meaning (Edward Scissorhands, The Notebook to name a few faves but the list is endless).  You see this film would have been moving if it was a Buddhist couple, or Jewish or Muslim or Hindu, (insert your preferred faith here).

This movie centers on love, commitment, dedication, forgiveness, unity and acceptance.  It portrays the frailty of people and the need to be loved and accepted. Say what you will, but those are powerful things to fit into a two-hour format and have you walking away with HOPE.

Christianity, perhaps, is the framework for the interpretation of the message in this movie, but it in no way nullifies its meaning.

The 2 story lines in the movie are:

-encouraging you to work through your marriage regardless of the situation
-having a personal relationship with Jesus Christ

The theme line in the movie was to ""Never leave your partner, especially in a fire.""  Another was that ""Although I have shown love over and over again, I still get rejected.""

These lines can be applied to Christians and non- Christians.

What is very stunning to me is that non-Christians flocked to the movie theatre and watched this just as much as Christians.  And for the majority, everyone loved it that is why it stayed in the Top 10 for so long- right next to the BIG MOVIE BUSTERS.

This is a GREAT FAMILY movie.  I thank God for something nice and clean and  positive about marriage for once on the big screen.

And how sweet that his ""real"" wife stepped in at the end for the kissing scene.  What a testimony.",1248480000,,992,4.51123595505618
3643053,4,B001HN68ZU,"Yes, the acting was bad and it may have been a little over the top with it's religious message (and I classify myself as a Christian... just not a very good one).  I'm not one for religous movies but I fell hard for this movie.  I honestly feel that the movie industry has gone down hill.  Most movies are rip offs of other movies (can we say 'remake') or they're just special effects with very little plot.  Frankly, right now, I would take a movie with bad acting and a plot with substance than a story line that's been done a million times over any day.  Since watching this movie, my husband and I treat each other better - hey, I'm even treating my friends and family better!  When was the last time a movie changed your life?  If your marriage isn't as strong as you would like it to be or if you're looking for a movie that has substance, I highly recommend you watch it!",1248307200,,878,4.221556886227545
3643054,3,B001HN68ZU,"Fireproof portrays the failing marriage of two twenty-somethings who have seemingly ""fallen out of love"" and are on the verge of divorce.  Caleb, the husband played by Kirk Cameron, is insensitive to his wife's needs and interprets all of her actions as demonstrating a lack of respect.  Respect comes easy to Caleb at work as the Chief of the Albany Fire Department in Albany, Georgia and he is constantly bemoaning the fact that the only person in his life that he apparently can't command respect from is his own wife.

His wife, Catherine, has become cold and aloof and resents Caleb's addiction to internet pornography.  The distance between them has become a chasm neither seems motivated to close and both lack the tools to accomplish.

After an explosive argument Catherine reaches her breaking point and says she wants a divorce.  Caleb is certainly not surprised and just as fed up with their marriage as she is.  He is resigned to the fact that they have fallen out of love and that there is no going back, explaining to his Christian friend at work that they used to love each other, but have become different people.  Caleb breaks the news to his father on the phone and his father decides to take a trip and visit his son in his time of need.  During his visit his father urges Caleb to turn to God and give his life to Him.  Caleb is happy that his parents are at peace with their newfound faith, but insists he does not need a ""crutch"" to help him in his own life.

Caleb's father asks his son to hold off on the divorce for 40 days and tells him to expect a package in the mail.  The package contains a book with 40 days' worth of ""Love Dares"" that are designed to turn the couple back toward each other.  I appreciated the fact that the Love Dares did not result in immediate marital bliss. Catherine rejected Caleb's attempts to ""be nice"" and in one scene hurls the scathing words at Caleb that make him want to throw in the towel: I do not love you.  In the meanwhile, she is quickly falling for a handsome doctor at the hospital where she works in public relations.

But the message of the movie is that love is a decision and should not be based on fleeting feelings, but rather on the Lord's plan and design for marriage.  The Love Dares are based on the principle of selflessness and being a servant to your partner.

Kirk Cameron's acting was excellent; the others were mediocre.  The movie's greatest flaw was the unrealistic support that Caleb received from both his father and his Christian friend at the fire department.  Few men have the unfailing devotion and support of a wise Christian father to guide them through difficult times in their marriage.  Furthermore, the depiction of life at the firehouse was idealized.  Caleb would have faced far more temptation in real-life.  In reality he would have had male friends who were urging him to ditch his wife and blow off steam at the local strip club.

Despite its shortcomings, the movie is good and the message is much needed in a world where the divorce rate is well over 50%.  Some will be turned off by the movie's strong evangelism, but it is a Christian film after all.  As other reviewers have pointed out, we should be more incensed when the movie industry glamorizes infidelity rather than a movie that urges couples to turn away from sin and not break their covenant.",1247961600,7,3360,4.550748752079867

3643059,4,B001HN68ZU,"My critique is for the overall message of the film.  Considering these are Christians who, themselves, do not claim to have a ton of experience making films, I think what they have done is a big accomplishment.  To those who are merely looking completely at the quality only is missing the message of this film, so it probably was not for them anyway.  But for those who this movie did touch ""mission accomplished"" the message got across.  While the acting may not have been top notch, the message was. The Kendrick Brothers' main objective was for the film to minister.  Based on all of these responses, it has done that for the majority.  However, folks are so quick to tear down efforts when the ones talking about it are probably not reaching out in any way to God's body or those who need Jesus, but can only sit back and criticize.  Thank the Lord that He blesses effort not perfection.  There is always room for improvement.  And their next project will be even better than the ones they have previously done because that's how God does it.  I can imagine how Jesus must have felt when the Sadducees and Pharisees criticized all that He was doing because they felt He was not in alignment with God's law or more so with their agenda. We need as much God filled themes in films as possible.  If some folks will not receive it...shake the dust from off of their feet.",1247529600,,1372,4.491935483870968
3643060,4,B001HN68ZU,"This movie would reach people who would not pick up a KJV Bible.  My husband is a pastor and we have been married happily in a strong Christian home for almost 40 years.  We enjoyed viewing the movie on a Friday night ""at home date night"" by the recommendation of a dear friend.  My husband was so impressed that he is going to start requiring it for couples as part of their pre-marital counseling along with The 5 Languages of Love by Gary Chapman.  The movie has it all; drama, humor, suspense, conflict, and a strong message for all who watch.  I would give it 5 starts;  However the acting in the beginning is a little stilted and unnatural.  So if it's not a multi-million dollar budget movie, it's as good as many which are.  The movie actually is filmed in Albany, GA and the actors seem like real people.  The father in the movie is a positive role model for his son as Christ is for his church.  Even Christians are tempted to get off track, so this movie demonstrate the gift of salvation and community without sending the message that Christians are perfect or hypocrites.  We need more wholesome movies like this one.",1247356800,,1130,4.463414634146342

3643067,5,B001HN68ZU,"Good, clean movie that reinforces traditional Christian values that marriage is forever. Looks like a sanitized version of the TV series ""Rescue me"".

Caleb Holt, a fire station captain has strains on his marriage with his pretty wife, Catherine. Due to the nature of their jobs, they don't see each other round their house much. Marital conflicts arise, mostly stemming from a communication breakdown that grew to the point of no-return when Catherine files for divorce (sounds familiar?). Reactive Caleb agrees but reluctantly agrees to follow his dad's help plan to work hard for 40 days to save his marriage. You have to feel for this guy Caleb as he tries to win his wife back in so many ways while his wife goes outrageously flirting and shamelessly romancing with her cheating male colleague, a Dr. Gavin Keller (played by Perry Revell). I'll leave you to watch the DVD to see how it all ends....

It is very interesting to note from this movie is how Caleb a man reasons and reacts vs how his wife Catherine resorts to ""feelings"" to make decisions. The disparity in male vs female reasoning is what causes couples to misunderstand one another all the time and it should be an area that we can all study further. ""Men are from Mars, women are from Venus"", does that ring a bell?

As a single male who has never been married, I'll say this to all men out there: ""get a prenup secured before you think of getting married""! While I'd like to fantasize that there are still good women out there (I've never met one!) who still believe in love and marriage (from personal observations, modern women have it all, they're mostly selfish gold-diggers), we men should learn from this movie! Get a prenup! Find someone that share the same values as you do. As for working at a marriage, sure -I agree with that point in the movie. Communication is very important in any relationship, and so is trusting in God. When all else fails, say your Rosaries and call me. No, wait, call me before you even get married. I have a checklist ready for you to survey....

It shows how digging in your heels and just having faith can make a difference.

Yes, the film wasn't made like a Hollywood movie.  All the people on this project were volunteers from the local Baptist church.  It was done out of love and a wanting to help people see the truth.  NOT for the typical hollywood bottom line: money.  This film's bottom line was understanding, emotion, love, selflesness, faith, not excluding God from your life, friendship, and putting forth the effort to make marriage work; not just sit back and live a life of self-entitlement, and selfishness, like so many people in our culture.

All in all, this film wasn't superbly acted, wasn't the multi-million dollar California movie.  BUT, the message far outweighs the slight differences.

A little girl talks about wanting to marry her dad (really???). Then, the actors appear, and the acting is just as horrible. I can't believe any director would settle for this...

The couple argues frivolously like children, and it got old very soon. Their feuds seemed strained and fake. (Honey the door needs painting, but you won't...!; I'm saving for a fishing boat!; The lawn needs landscaping!; I've been saving for my boat for years!) The accents are too strong (""thick"") also for most of the characters.

Then comes the bit about the firefighters asking questions about heaven and hell, which I thought was odd. Then the father of the immature husband who can't handle his marriage suggests his son turn to the Lard to save his marriage, and then a 13-ft cross comes center screen as they're walking through a forest. The father says he used to be like his son, yada yada yada, then it became clear to me that a major theme of the movie is...surprise, faith in Jebus and the Father and Mother Nature, whatever.

Very, very poor acting. Full of clichs (sweet tea with lemon - surprise - for our Georgia natives, might as well have had peaches!) and tired, boring drama pressed hard by the actors by yelling the best they can at each other for what seems like their debut on camera.

3643095,2,B001HN68ZU,"Before I start this review I should state where I am coming from, as I feel that most reviewers neglect this fact and let their inherent bias' seep into their critiques gradually. So to start off with I'm a recently married guy with a wife who is beginning to get in touch with the Lord via a local church, and myself I am pretty firmly in the agnostic-atheist camp. So the wife wanted us to watch this together which we did the other night.

Now, this is a movie, so despite its underlying theme, message or what-have-you is open to critique apply so- for instance the holocaust was a bad thing, but Schindlers' list was a good movie, because of it's a)acting b)plot c)effects. So in this regard, Fireproof was about a falling apart marriage and the redemption of that marriage.

The acting was rather poor, for all the cast members. To be fair, by the end of the movie it had gotten much better, but I think this was owing to the fact that so much emotional content had happened by then that the characters themselves were that much more familiar and I was able to get past their acting abilities. The dialogue was also very, very stilted and unnatural. To me the effect was like watching a dinner-play rather than a movie, which was not what I had expected before-hand.

The supportive cast was very shallow in development, although the point of the movie was the marriage. Still, the nurses, the fire-crew, etc were really only there to make the viewer aware of the supposed underlying struggles going on in the main couples heads. For instance, the nurses seemed to me the exemplar of the `catty' girlfriends, and equally the fire-crew seemed the boiler-plate `bros'. The only character other than the two main ones whom I felt was developed at all was Kirk's friend, and this was during the railroad scene and the marriage `secret' revelation. The comical aspects of the characters were funny enough, only they too felt very strained and forced. As for the husband and wife characters, their fights and acting were also very jumpy and stilted. To be honest though it did take a while to adjust to seeing Kirk as all grown up- I kept remembering Growing Pains for the first half-hour. Kirk's father was actually the only actor I thought had who actually `acted'. His portrayal of a fatherly, benevolent guide was actually pretty believable and affable.

Now as to the plot, I thought it was a relatively good portrayal of a dysfunctional marriage. The self-centeredness and derisive nature of each was effectively conveyed, however spotty the dialogue and acting were. The simplistic aspects of the plot however, I felt were a bit biased, one-sided and unrealistic. The glaring obviousness I felt was that the husband's character was the one who changed the most throughout the film, and it was primarily about this change that the movie centered on. To be fair, the wife had to come to her own conclusions as to the worthiness of the marriage, yet I felt that the one actually going to put out the fire was indeed the husband, pun intended. I also felt that this was an underlying theme, that the males in the film were what needed fixing- be it the main husband, Kirk's father who was the one who was actually Booked on by his mother, the doctor who was also affairing around, the best friend who had a failed marriage and was trying to redeem himself, and even the `unbelieving' fireman who said we go into the ground and nothing more. It just seemed to me that the movie was anti-male across the board, and portrayed women as self-interested due to poor male influence or because their love was overpowering. The fact that neither the main characters nor Kirk's fire-man friend had any children was also a much more simplistic view about marriage- kids are an integral part of any marriage I feel, and even in their absence the need to talk about them or include them was a large piece of the puzzle that was left out. In fact the only child in the movie was the one in the burning house. Kirk's parents were also an idealized version of parents it seemed, the fatherly sage and the selfless mother. Granted there were mild tensions between Kirk's character and his mother, it just seemed too idealized for me. But it was more this general idealization of the entire cast that really brought the simplistic aspects of the film to the forefront. Each character did exactly what they were there to do, and nothing more, be it offering advice, casting disparagements, offering temptation, acting as comic relief, etc. etc. This to me simply downplayed the movie itself. I will say though that the plot was emotional enough, both from a male perspective and a female perspective. Again it had more to do with idealized truths though than any plot elements- i.e. courage, honor, sacrifice, devotion, harmony, etc etc.  It wasn't so much that the film lacked these understandings, nor had set up a bad track for them to unfold; it was the glaring and over-the-top bluntness of their display.

As for the message- it was simple enough; save your marriage through grit and fortitude and with a dose of the Lord. Now I am pretty neutral on the Christian thing, but for one thing, this was a Christian movie, so to sit back and bash it because it had a Christian message is nonsensical, you knew that going into it. Second, the Christian message isn't overpowering, it's not like every scene is an orgy of praying and Praise Jesus'. It wasn't subtle though either. To be honest, if the acting and the stilted dialogue wasn't such a drain on the movies effectiveness, the message was just enough to serve its purpose and not become overbearing. The only over the top scene that was Christian was the scene with Kirk and his father standing before the Cross, when Kirk is describing his lack of success with his attempts to save his marriage. Otherwise, the message was not as pervasive as I was expecting, but again the simplistic aspects of the movie, chiefly its idealized ideologues was what, for me, subverted its effectiveness.

So overall did I like the movie? Yes, but not for its acting, message or plot. Mostly I liked its ideal, that marriage is hard-work. But more than anything I enjoyed the attempt at an honest portrayal of a bad marriage, from both a female perspective and male perspective- an attempt, however simplistic to give both sides and pathos in a relationship equal merit and weight. So in a movie that focused on ideals it was the ideal that I was left with, and nothing more. So for this reason I wish the acting had been better.",1244678400,16,6555,4.66522491349481
3643096,1,B001HN68ZU,"Caleb, the husband was an insensitive jerk.  When he backed his wife into a corner early in the film and screamed at her about being disrespectful to him, I was too through.  I would have knocked his sorry behind to the kitchen floor.  Catherine, the wife, was a wimp, who took way too much from her husband.  Wayne, the comic relief, was annoying, not funny.  Caleb's dad, Caleb's African-American co-worker, and a nurse at the hospital where Catherine worked were indistinguishable from each other.  Why?  All three were preaching the theme of the film each time they were onscreen.  It only took one character to do that; it showed how poorly the script was written.  I also didn't like how dismissive Caleb was of his mother.  And the comment that Caleb made to his wife that suggested she had no business having a career?  I don't think so!

The production values were a little better than I've seen in most Christian-themed films.  The acting was not.  I understand that the church who put this film together has two other films they did prior to Fireproof.  I don't plan to rush to see those earlier efforts based on what I saw in this film.  I'm a Christian, but I agree with some of the other critics of this film that the message was too heavy-handed.  ""Beating people over the head with a Bible"" is never a good way to bring people into the faith, and that's akin to what this film did.",1244592000,21,1397,4.50199203187251

In fact, the people that I've personally change like this have WAY BETTER marriages than the people I know who have never struggled at all together.
I don't suggest that there is never a marriage not worth saving, but in the grand scheme of life (especially in our country), we feel injustice is having to wait behind a person with 11 items in a 10 item only line.  We have the same feelings in our marriages sometimes.  We tend to have this ""If I am putting even one ounce of effort more into our marriage than you are, then it's not fair"" attitude.  We need to get over ourselves and start giving our spouses (and children, friends, etc) 100% all the time, even if we feel like we aren't getting in return...the only way we can expect our spouse to change is if we're willing to change too.  Sorta goes right along with the idea of ""to get good friends we first need to become one"" theory.

This film is good food for thought no matter how good or bad you think your marriage is.  The story centers around the crumbling marriage of a control freak, pornography addicted fire chief.  He wants respect from his wife but can't see that he's not giving her any either.  Things have gotten to the point where both want out and are not willing to put forth any effort to lift or strenthen each other or their marriage.  It's a preachy film, but not overly so - for goodness sakes, it's a Christian movie made by and for Christians so I expected this and respect it.
My only complaint is that Kirk Cameron was the only person in the film who could act - although the guy who played his firefighter best friend was okay.

Not so with some of the recent Kirk Cameron flicks. Don't get me wrong.  The  technical production is often low-grade, and in some cases (the Left Behind films) the plot is a bit hokey.

But Fireproof seems to mark an evolution in the Christian film genre. One critic of the film has accused the film's message of being overly simplistic: find Jesus and your marriage problems are over.

Not exactly.

The husband's efforts to save his marriage are taxing and the road is long, and he even comes close to failure at one point. The point comes through loud and clear: marriage is work, whether you know Jesus or not.

That's the most honest  message about marriage in a film I've seen in a long time: ""It's not without its rewards, but it's work.""",1243728000,,976,4.627906976744186

But first, I must dive into the artistic quality of the movie.  It was less than second rate.  The main characters existed only to be married to each other - they had no other personality or depth.  The script - I don't even know where to begin to say how cheezy each dialogue was.  The so-called comedic reliefs, that were inserted throughout the movie, was bearable, but really had no place in the movie.  In a good movie, even the most irrelevant piece of scene is made to fit in - but Fireproof could not pull this off.  A few times during the movie, I was quite bored and had to find something to do while watching the movie...(like check my email).  But here come the reasons why I give the movie five stars.  It had a solid message - which moved me, even in my boredom.  The most pronounced message in the movie was how to love - as one who has been loved unconditionally and has been forgiven in the darkest moments.  The greatest teacher of love is Christ and when we understand that, we can love others so much better than we could ourselves.  What a powerful message.  There are also other beautiful messages that I take away from the movie - about being a Christian in the workplace and the other kinds of love between family and friends.  I don't think I'll watch this movie again, but I do want to recommend it those who seek a great sermon of a movie.  I feel like I've had a great devotional time with God.

3643128,2,B001HN68ZU,"I wiped Kirk Cameron off my list when he fired Playmate Julie McCullough from his TV show simply for being a Playboy Playmate. I guess Mr. Cameron showers with swim trunks on...

But to move on to other things, like FIREPROOF. The story of a young, struggling couple, FIREPROOF concerns the floundering marriage of a young firefighter and his pretty wife, who works as a hospital administrator. After a long day at work rescuing kids from burning buildings and lifting stuck cars off railroad tracks by brute force, hubby comes home to a dinner table full of nothing and a refrigerator full of his wife's favorite foods. Hubby withdraws, spending most of his home time saving for a sailboat and looking at (gasp!) naked women on the Internet (Julie McCullough does not get a cameo). ""Have you cleaned out your History folder?"" his perpetually toxic wife carps.

As for the young missus, she spends most of her time complaining about her husband to the girls at work, and making goo-goo eyes with one of the handsome young doctors on staff. She also takes care of her elderly parents, though this bit of humanizing behavior gets glossed. Women don't come out too well in FIREPROOF.

In the meantime, on the man front, our brave hero appears to belong to the only firehouse that runs a quilting bee. While there are a few moments of obligatorily ridiculous male bonding behavior, the hook and ladder company is more like an encounter group for spiritually bereft men. Actually, they might be bereft of other things too, or should I say two other things. Men don't come out too well in FIREPROOF.

Still, FIREPROOF is an okay movie until it starts preaching. I'd be the last person to argue against the importance of finding a spiritual center to your life, especially in today's modern, materialistic world. And I don't care if it's Jesus or the Jonas Brothers, the Buddha or breadsticks, as long as it bestows its gifts upon you.

But FIREPROOF takes God---the inconceivably vast and sentient consciousness that includes EVERYTHING---and reduces it all down to the size of a box of tissues. Hubby Dearest decides (with some prodding from his Mommy and Daddy) to take on a ""love dare,"" and to show his not-too-better half what love is, or can be. She isn't buying it. Not at all. He can't give the love away. Eventually she comes around and FORGIVES HIM HIS INDISCRETIONS (I guess playing Doctor with the Doctor isn't as bad as looking at Julie McCullough's photo shoot). They live happily ever after, having accepted Jesus into their lives.

Yeah, that's nice. But real couples have real problems, and FIREPROOF's cookbook approach to relationships and its absolutely patronizing attitude toward God, really rankled me. FIREPROOF allows for no thought---just do what the Bible says, mention Jesus a few times as garnish, give the Lord a pat on the head for being your own personal mascot, and that should do the trick. Jesus really doesn't come out too well in FIREPROOF.

I would really like to know how these self-righteous proselytizers can be SO CERTAIN that THIS is what God wants and THAT is not what God wants. I may be made in God's image, but I guarantee that God is a lot bigger, far smarter, immeasuably older, much more experienced, and infinitely more subtle than I will ever be.

It takes one arrogant ego structure to assert that anybody except God knows what God wants, but, of course, not only does FIREPROOF tell you what God wants, but it also markets (ah, Mammon!) a whole line of marriage materials to go along with the movie. God doesn't come out too well in FIREPROOF either, but I doubt God cares that Kirk Cameron has appointed himself as His press agent. Maybe Kirk should care though.

Ultimately, these acts bring him closer to the concept of God and Christianity. He overcomes his addiction to pornography and learns to be a considerate, loving, and helpful husband. I felt like Fireproof was a more realistic look at what love and marriage are really about, and didn't skim over the brutalities and confusion that will be experienced.

3643132,5,B001HN68ZU,"There have been many reviews and comments made on this movie and book but I just had to add my two cents to the pot.  Since the basic plot has been told in many other comments, it is not necessary to repeat it.  I saw the movie first and then bought the DVD.  I was not able to find the book in the local stores-finally got it through Amazon.  I would strongly recommend getting both.  I am aware that the book was made after the movie but it I still would recommend reading it either before or after viewing the movie as it fills in a lot of what Caleb and Catherine are thinking and their attitudes- which I think would be difficult to bring out in a movie.  I have watched the movie many times and each time it gets better.  True, some of the acting and dialog could have been better, but let's not shoot the messenger for the message, and I don't think it detracts from the movie at all.  I believe the best parts of the story are the scenes of Caleb's apology and the next one when Catherine finds out that it was Caleb who bought her mother the bed and wheelchair and not Gavin; all done without telling her and expecting anything in return-true agape love.  Those were really emotional moments and if they didn't at least bring a little misty eyed response, then you must be a walking zombie.
A couple of items:
1. Some bloggers commented there were some loose ends that were left in the movie and book.  One of which was Catherine's relationship with Gavin.  The DVD had a section of deleted scenes and one of them was when she found Gavin flirting with another woman in the hospital.  I think the look on her face would tell you that her `balloon' was punctured for Gavin.  I am not sure where in the timeline of the movie this scene would have been placed though.  There was one other deleted scene with the wedding album that would have added to the story and tied in with the `bay scene' but because of time constraints, it was decided to leave them out.  I think they could have shortened some of the dramatic fire and rescue scenes to make room for them or at least add them in the DVD version of the movie.  By the way these story lines are also not in the book.
2. The first several times I viewed the movie and read the book, I really felt for Catherine and the way she was treated by Caleb.  But in listening to her in the firehouse bay at the end of the story, one is given the impression that she feels that all this was Caleb's fault.  I was a little irritated that the last thing she said was `Is it too late for you to grow old with me'.  I thought she should have said `Is it too late for ME to grow old with YOU'.  I think that would have been better in keeping with the flow of the story.  I also felt the scene would have been so much more powerful if she also had added a line saying that she was sorry and asking Caleb to forgive her.  I think it would have shown the depth of her love for him. But of course she did not have the kind of love for him as he did for her as she recognized something in him that she didn't have and wanted to have the same thing.
Even with all the faults of the movie and book, you got to go get them.  Oh, and get the Love Dare also.  It will tell you much more about what Caleb went through and how he was changed.
I would like to add as a late entry that you should really read the novel as it will give you some insight as to why Catherine is not reasponding to Caleb as one might think she should.  I must have been a little slow as I didn't pick up on this only after reading the novel a couple of times.  In the novel she is depicted as a strong willed, self confident, and, I might add,an obstinate woman.  When she gets an idea, such as leaving and divorcing Caleb, she latches on to it and won't let go.  Because of this her heart is hardened and oblivious to the change that has occurred in Caleb until her heart is finally softened by the works of God.",1241913600,,3923,4.079530638852673

3643143,4,B001HN68ZU,"I saw the movie on DVD over the weekend and was pleasantly surprised.  The acting considering most of the actors save for Kirk Cameron were amatuers was fairly good.  The Story of a marriage on the rocks was engaging and the scenes of Caleb and his men working accidents and fires was exciting.  The films message and proselytizing may turn some viewers off but it is a perfect vehicle for the audience for which its intended.

Kirk Cameron plays a Fire Captain who's marriage is falling apart because he only thinks of himself.  The most important thing in his life is a new bass boat not his family.  His wife is an administrator at a hospital who's mother has had a stroke and is in need of in home care.  She is tempted by a swarmy doctor(role would have been better with a better actor IMHO) who sweet talks her and treats her with more tenderness than her self absorbed husband.

The couple get in a fight and start divorce proceedings.  Caleb's father meets with him and persueds him to follow a 40 day plan for winning her back.  Caleb then starts on a spiritual journey where he truly finds himself, but will his marriage be saved?

I heard that Kirk Cameron had them rewrite the script so that he would not kiss his onscreen wife  I think that was quite commendable.  It shows what an honorable person he truly is in real life.  The only peson he says he'll ever kiss is his real wife.

I enjoyed the film and think you will too.  Just think of it as you would a local Little Theater that has had a television star appear in their latest production.  Come into it with that point of view and enjoy yourself.",1241395200,,1617,4.37248322147651

When are church leaders going to start teaching us the truth on these issues and what it takes, if they would leave the false teaching and myths out that have not worked for years and get to the truth, families would not be in the messes they are in.

3643157,4,B001HN68ZU,"The fact that this low-budget Christian (and evangelical at that) movie did better at the box office than famous atheist Bill Maher's hit piece on religion, which I will only refer to as ""Ridiculous"", says quite a lot not only about what the majority of Americans believe (even if they don't always practice and vote in so-called pro-choicers), but also about the quality of this film, which was quite good. The acting was very realistic, the parts that were supposed to be funny were, and the plot was simple, yet interesting enough to keep me watching till the end.

That said, though I know this was a movie intended for Christian audiences, I can understand how those who are non-Christians might find the fact that the movie portrays that one cannot know what love really is or have a successful marriage unless they are both Christians.

However, the only part of the movie I didn't agree with, per se, was the fact that it was up to the husband to save the marriage, with the wife only coming back on board after her husband does everything he can to make her happy, but then, because he was the one who was looking at girls on the Internet and saving up money that could have went towards his wife's mother's health care instead of a boat, then it makes sense that the ball was in his court and it was up to him to make things right between them, because it was only after all this that his wife began to fall in love with another man, which, I believe became the underlying reason (along with skepticism) why she didn't want her marriage to work out.

Because I am a woman, I have to admit, I was sympathetic to Catherine spending so much time with the young doctor (doing nothing more than sharing lunch and chatting) who treated her much better than her husband, though one should never begin another relationship before ending the last.

I am so glad it ended the way it did (after all, we all know the ending--this movie is more about the journey), and I believe if both parties are willing, God can help save almost any marriage (and I am not referring to arranged marriages, or marriages of convenience, but marriages where two people married because they were in love).

I find it interesting that probably many of the people who found the Christian theme in this film offensive, probably don't find the gratuitous use of the Lord's name in vain in most all of the Hollywood productions so.",1240704000,,2406,4.534562211981567

The basic theme throughout the movie is Christianity saves all, including your marriage. If you believe that, then good for you. My wife and I both had enough of this movie and it's Christian-themed-infomercial-masked-as-a-movie somewhere around the half-way point, so we turned it off.",1240704000,10,582,4.989690721649485

The main concept of the show is that in a marriage each partner needs to focus more on the needs of the other person instead of his/her own for it to be successful.  Even though it makes some very important points, it is still done in a way that is fun to watch.

I recommend this for anyone who is married.  It will help open one's eyes to things that we tend to take for granted while also addressing the huge mistake made when one is too focused on self interest.  Along with the marriage theme, there is also a strong message about Christ and our need for a relationship with Him.

Fireproof's supporting cast includes members from Sherwood Church in Georgia.  The family atmosphere is always a welcome whenever I watch their movies.

The Special Collector's Edition DVD has extra footage that wasn't included on the original version, Casting Crowns Slow Fade Video and much more.

I've really never been a huge fan of Kirk Cameron, but this is the best performance I have seen from him yet.  He plays his role very convincingly, and respectfully.  I really gained a whole new respect for firefighters after watching this.

I dare you to buy this movie and The Love Dare and do it on any relationship you are involved in. Whether you end up becoming a believer in Jesus Christ is up to whether your heart can accept the spiritual and divine. Not all people are open to that. But Fireproof is undeniably a powerful film. The critics can pan things because they are ignorant of the biblical nuances - before Caleb deals with addiction, he places his wife's picture on his desk. Why? Because when you want to eradicate an addiction, you must replace it ... with something good to fill the void. There are many other parts of this movie that are worth a second look because it provides right biblical teaching. I liked Fireproof because it shows me the impact a film can have without all the waste of $ of a big blockbuster.

For almost the entire movie I was close to tears because the story was so compelling and beautiful. How often do you see people really fighting for their marriage against all odds?

This movie also has some good humor in places but the overall message is quite serious. Kirk Cameron was excellent in the role of Caleb and Erin Bethea is perfect as the neglected wife Catherine. I loved watching Caleb struggle to win back his wife after she declares she wants a divorce. Even though he decides to do the right thing (fight for his marriage) he is still rejected most of the time. Since I'm a Christian I didn't mind the fact that this had a spiritual theme to it. In fact I loved how this movie showed how a relationship with Jesus could help to solve some of life's more complex problems.

The story is based on a failing marriage, but easily applies to any relationship we have, whether it be a marriage, a dating relationship or the relationship with have with God. I believe it's about taking a good look at yourself and making a commitment to be the person God intended you to be. Too often we wait for others in our lives to make the first move after some hurt we've suffered and it's time we look at ourselves and what we contribute to all of our relationships and worry about changing ourselves first and allow God to truly lead our lives.",1239494400,,661,4.426229508196721

I am a Christian, I love God, I love my church, but I did not love this movie. I am an avid church go-er, but also an avid movie go-er and this movie was more focused on it's message than on the delivery of it. Yes, it's inspirational and carries a wonderful Christian message, but to review this film honestly, I have to say I didn't much care for it. The acting was just bad, the production was sloppy...for a feature film, that is. I am glad I watched it on DVD rather than the theatre. I would say it is more like a Hallmark film, but actually, it's more like a fancy After-school Special. The plot is simple and easy to relate to: a marriage in crisis. But the way that the Kirk Cameron character was ""converted"" was stilted. I would have liked to have seen him actually attending church and see his faith growing, instead we're just told that he's ""in"" when it comes to believing in God.

I like the idea of feature films incorporating moral values and Christ into their plots, I just think productions are going to have to be better if these types of films are to cross over into the mainstream. As I said, I love my faith, but I also love films and this just wasn't a very good movie.",1238889600,7,1320,4.28

This movie was about as ""real life"" as movies get! As one watches the steady disintegration of Caleb's marriage; the heated arguments with his wife, the growing hostility and the lack of respect they show one another, it is easy to relate to their situation. You see Caleb's fascination with pornography and how his wife is getting wrapped up in an emotional affair with one of her co-workers and you can totally relate to their pain. Just when all seems to be headed for certain disaster, in his desperation he agrees to try something his father suggests, the Love Dare. Your heart breaks for him when his efforts to show his love and remorse are spurned by his wife and her ""friend"" at work gets more of her attention than her husband. But God is at work behind the scenes and He alone gives Caleb the tenacity to keep working on the marriage when all seems a futile effort. Caleb comes face to face with his addiction to pornography and is willing to make his wife his first priority. That is the pivotal point in the healing of a broken relationship.
What a beautiful story of ""beauty from ashes""! It gives hope to couples struggling with the issues so prevalent in marriages today. This is not a ""cheesy chick flick"". It's a real life movie that will quickly pull you into the emotion of a troubled marriage spiraling out of control. Add to that the intense scenes of Caleb's dangerous job as a firefighter, and you have a family friendly movie that speaks directly to where many people are at today!",1238716800,,1640,4.967272727272727

It is a Christian movie, so if you're offended by Christian teachings, or view anything that has a Christian message as ""pushy"" then you want to avoid this movie.

However, no one's going to bash the endings of these movies, but will bash Fireproof. Reason is because in Fireproof, Jesus Christ is the one who brings true redemption and fulfillment. With Him, the end is always perfect!
The story was one that many can take as their own: a marriage that has seen some of its brighter days behind them due to becoming comfortable and forgetting your spouse and why you married them in the first place.

3643244,5,B001HN68ZU,"Let me first say, that I am a born-again believer (in 20's and been married 3 years), and in my opinion the movie was good.  The acting was not what some would consider ""oscar"" worthy (but I can never tell which actors will get oscars anyway), but the overall theme COMBINED with the acting was good and thus, the movie is good.  Even though I don't claim to be a complete jerk within my marriage towards my wife, I couldn't help be see subtle tendencies within myself and Caleb (Kirk Cameron).

As a review, this movie will be great to those who come with an open mind realizing the movie is about MARRIAGE - NOT FIRES.

Those who've had issues with this movie seemed to be non-Christians who are more irritated with the message of Christianity being incorporated than anything else.  While many may say the acting was HORRIBLE, they should realize that this is a movie through the eyes of a CHRISTIAN.  So often our movies are portrayed in such a different light, even if about marriage, where there are such extremes and this was a refreshing change (i.e. its nice to have a movie with this intensity that lacked any profanity).  Example: One person's negative review cited they disliked or felt it was so unrealistic for the woman at the hospital to say ""excuse me"" so she can bless her food before continuing in conversation with Catherine.  I thought this was great, because in going to lunch with my co-workers, it happens all the time.  They may just begin eating, but I stop to bless my food - happens all the time.

I don't think this movie was deceptive in that its really not about fires, I think that was a creative way of linking the theme (marriage) with the husbands occupation (even the ""OO"" in the title has wedding bands).

Question: Is it unreasonable for the church to create mainstream films that don't say, ""JESUS"" in the title?  Afterall, I've flip past quite a few movies on the movie channels that would indicate they are spiritual or biblical and they're not.  I don't get upset with the title, I realize they may merely be linking a portion of the movie to an element from scripture  and then I turn (i.e. titles such as the following are not biblical but appear to be: Jesus' Son, The Last Temptation of Christ, Babel, Saved, Jacob's Ladder).
Further, it's no more deceptive than Jerry McGuire which really isn't about a sports through the eyes of an agent as much as its about him finding himself and love.

Sadly, it shows the state of man in our society.  Even a movie that doesn't BOMBARD you with Christianity and scriptures, its is considered poor by some due to a lack of profanity, violence, and secular theme.

I pray this movie helps mend marriage relations and brings others to Christ.",1238112000,,2725,4.574074074074074

3643250,5,B001HN68ZU,"I just watched this last night with my boyfriend.  I didn't realize it was going to have as much of a religious theme as it did, but it wasn't overdone.  I think if couples took the dare for 40 days, there would be far fewer divorces.  In fact, if everyone applied some of these dares to friends as well as strangers, the world would be a far better, kinder place.  It's about doing the right thing rather than the easy thing.  The acting wasn't fabulous (Kirk is too sweet to be believably nasty), the budget wasn't huge, but that helped one focus on the content, which was very powerful.  Giving every couple the dare book for a wedding gift would probably be the most valuable present they'd ever receive.  I highly recommend this movie.  But if you're cynical, bitter, or take offense to a religious theme, you will probably not like this movie.  It was definitely a feel good type movie with step by step directions on how to enhance all of your relationships, not just your marriage.",1238025600,,989,4.51123595505618
3643251,5,B001HN68ZU,"My husband and I love that this movie portrays a realistic view of the hardships and trials that people can have in marriage.  Too often, a Hollywood ""happily ever after"" approach doesn't show the years of hard work it takes to make a marriage work.  I also liked the Christian aspect of the movie, because in real life, difficult situations sometimes bring people into a faith.  And I also liked that it brought out pornography as a problem because I feel that too often in our society it is ignored when it really can bring you down.

The acting was good, I will admit slightly cheesy at times, but the overall feel-good aspect of the movie was so overpowering, it didn't bother me at all.",1237852800,,691,4.504
3643252,5,B001HN68ZU,"I just watch this movie for the first time last week. My wife and I wanted to go to see it in the theater, but it just didn't seem to work out. When I did see it, I was glad that it was on the big screen, and not a direct to DVD Version. The point of this movie is not to wow you with great acting or action, it is to give a great message about salvation and marriage. Those two go hand in hand. True love / marriage will not work out without God in your life. He is the center of this movie, and it is why is was a great movie. For those of you who didn't like it because of the Christian message, I say to you, than don't watch. It never hid the fact that it was a Christian movie. What is so wrong with having a great Christian movie on the big screen anyway, when you have all this nasty movies on screen as well. Its about time we have something with a message in the movies that makes it to the big screen like ""Left Behind"" did. I only hope that more Christain movies make it to the big screen. If you are not a true Christian, and still want to watch this movie as I really encourage you, than do so with an open mind, and pay attention to the message. God will touch your heart with this movie as He did with me. If my wife and I were not Christians, our marriage would have failed in the first year. Because of the Lord Jesus, we keep on working to keep our marriage a loving environment. Marriage is never easy, and without God, it is impossible.",1237852800,2,1457,3.925675675675676
3643253,5,B001HN68ZU,"and that's what really matters to me. My husband is a tall and a big guy (macho type *lol*), who you'd think would not get the message the movie is conveying. But he did. He had tears in his eyes and he appreciates more of our marriage relationship. Marriage is not something we should take for granted, in fact, it is when a couple should try harder to make a marriage work. All married couple should have the book A Love Dare that the main character used to save his marriage. The movie is not a Hollywood production full of great Oscar winning dramatic acting. However, it's a natural acting that anyone could relate to. The performers are not known except Kirk Cameron. But the movie conveyed a simple truth that marriage and divorce do not go together. That if God is in the center of a couple's lives and they acknowledge God's guidance in their lives through His instructions and commands, a marriage stands a chance in surviving throughout a couple's lifetime. The marriage relationship is sweeter, full of love, understanding and, full of respect and trust for one another. My husband got emotional especially at the end when Kirk's character's dad revealed something to him that the son did not know about his own parents' marriage relationship. My husband really took it to heart. God is working in both my husband and I's lives. We had a rough start, but when God came into our lives, things definitely have changed for the better. All married couple secretly wish that in their relationship. That's why any couple can relate to the storyline--it's very common, but what to do to save a crumbling or a marriage that is collapsing is another thing. A man and a woman who decide to get married have to completely turn to God for guidance, it is the only way. God created marriage and He is the only One who knows how it would work in perfect harmony. This movie is a tearjerker especially for those who are going through rough times with their marriage, in the process of divorce or already separated and been divorced. This movie will touch a chord emotionally. The producers of this movie also were responsible for another great movie Flywheel, another eye opening storyline.",1237852800,,2187,4.683116883116883

3643268,4,B001HN68ZU,"Fireproof has a great message, one that I honestly have not seen in a movie or television for a long time. Though the acting at times can be somewhat faulty, in the end I still give this movie two thumbs up for both the story and message it gives. It is not a movie just for the religious or for those with a troubled marriage, no this is a movie that all can benefit from. It is a movie that will really make you think about your life and how you live it.

 When you look at the world we now live in we are surrounded by bad examples. Every time we turn on the television there is some celebrity who has cheated on his wife of 20 years with the nanny or a wife that has found some other man and has suddenly decided she is no longer happy in the relationship. We watch movies and see the charactors we love just give up on their relationship like it was nothing. Fireproof gives us a view that we have not seen on the big screen for a while, to work and fight for your relationship and to never ""give up"".

  My biggest (and probably only) complaint about this movie was that at times I found the actors/actress' to be a bit over the top. Don't get me wrong the movie is far from being unwatchable due to bad casting, but at times I did find myself wincing at the scenes. Yes at points the movie can be hard to watch, but the actors/actress' do redeem themselves and make the message really hit home.

  The movie does relate to the bible, and yes it is about a troubled marraige and a man trying his best to save it. So does this mean you need to be religous or have a troubled marriage yourself to get anything from this movie? No, this movie can teach you something about any relationship in your life not just one with a spouce, and not just for a troubled relationship. This movie can show you how to tend to a relationship and provent trouble from arrising. The bible is displayed in it, but only to back up ideas and give examples of the meaning behind them. You do not need to be extremely religous to enjoy fireproof.

  In the end this movie has a great story line and dispite the sometimes ""sketchy"" acting I would still recommend watching it at least once.",1237680000,,2169,4.177458033573141

We were tempted to ask for our money back but were so angry that we were afraid we would create a scene at the theater. Extremely disappointed and offended.,1237593600,10,550,4.739583333333333

It was painful to see the emptiness of a marriage having been neglected. It was portrayed in a realistic light. Yet this movie is about hope and forgiveness and about responsibility. This movie does not sugar coat and say all you need is Jesus and everything is fine. No. This movie says that we must work at love and act loving even when we don't feel like. If we can not get stuck in our own sense of entitlement and feelings, then even a marriage that seems lost can not only be saved, but blossom. This is a really good movie.

If you haven't heard of Living Waters ministries, you should check it out on the web, but seeing that Kirk Cameron was starring in this film, and having read that he actually had his REAL wife be a body double for the kissing scene with his ACTRESS wife, made me think that solid Biblical doctrine would be an important aspect in the script. I was not disappointed.
Even if you do not use the Bible as your Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth, I can still recommend seeing it.

The film teaches that having a good (or at least better) marriage, both parties should not be selfish and love each other. Loving as in the verb, not the butterflies-in-your-belly-feeling. The best way to go about this is being gracious and taking the first step(s), maybe not even expecting anything back.

3643289,2,B001HN68ZU,"Kirk Cameron and a couple of other actors were acceptably solid, but most of the rest of the cast was straight from the church drama club. This movie at best is a TV movie and more relevant as a DVD available through your church as a freebie or for a nominal fee. The sound quality was poor; I had to turn the volume up high.

*Spoiler alert*: The message is fine. And the yelling scenes and the issues were right on the money. Trust me..wives can scream just like that too. The conversion was a little too simplistic, but I guess that's to be expected in a 2 hour movie.  What struck me was that Caleb apologized to Catherine but she never apologized to him.  She just accepted his apology and said she loved him. She was just as guilty as he was.  I guess her conversion/acceptance is just implied after they have reconciled.

I wish the dare would work this well in real life. However, if both husband and wife are not fully committed to trying to save the marriage, it probably won't work. It takes two to stay married, but only one to get a divorce.

As an aside, three out of five people in that firehouse were obese. Surely, the percentage in the real world of firehouses is not that ""heavy"".

I do see the marital part of the story line as very believable.  I've been very close to people in rocky marriages, with similar problems as those related in this movie.

Sometimes one of the spouses in a marriage can do such heinous things, for so long, that the other spouse no longer has any desire to work on the marriage...and is very suspicious of the first few attempts made by the offending spouse to change.

But with persistence, and when the motive is to do what's right, BECAUSE it's right, not because you're getting the reaction you want, hearts change.

I write this because I've read reviews that state that many of the aspects of the marriage and its problems are unbelievable, and I completely disagree with those opinions.

I was really pleased with this movie because, while the acting wasn't without fault, the story-line was convincing, the message was principled , and the ending was uplifting.

As a Christian, I'm so glad that this movie shows that following God's direction changes hearts, lives...and marriages.  It's true...I've lived it, and I've witnessed it countless times.",1237161600,3,1250,4.863207547169812

Bonus Features are nice with this DVD: especially enjoyed the story in ""Behind Scenes"" supplier of fork lift on train scene as well as ""Wayne on Wayne.""

God started marriage between man and woman.  He further prescribed that this marriage would revolve around their relationship with Him, Ephesians 5:21.  From this marriage moves together in beautiful picture of Christ and His church and the married couple are to live this relational picture out as husband and wife, each playing different parts and roles.  In this film, the human nature to take marriage in other, sinful, self-centered directions is wonderfully depicted.  Christ enters the picture as the reconciler that He is, and puts the marriage back on Ephesians 5 tracks.  Interested couples will want to check out Peter Kurkowski's book: Lifelines of Love.

3643297,3,B001HN68ZU,"Writers are warned against ""deus ex machina"". The audience should not be aware of the author's hand controlling the story. I noticed this a lot during the film. That happens when you are a writer and pick up things the general population ""doesn't get"". But like a note out of key, those things irked me out of enjoying the film.

For example: it looks like one rescuer got hit in the head while trying to get the car off the railroad tracks. Then we find he is okay. Another example: you see the hero rescuing the child trapped in the burning building. His walkie talkie is naturally forgotten on the firetruck's bumper since he caught in a crisis, and this adds to the drama.

I hate to feel manipulated by a film, and this one had its fingers picking at me all the way through. That includes the emotional-relationship drama in the love triangle, that seemed scripted for a Christian Morality Play (and it is).

The director just HAD to keep taking us to the park with 3 crosses set up in it.... Not a subtle hint of faith. It reminded the audience that ""this is a Christian film""

... keep zooming in on the present or absent wedding rings, and the fresh or dying flowers - the audience MAY forget the point of the film...

They want to make the point that marriage is alot of work, and trying to make it work can be really hard. And sometimes people are just lousy people, and you have to take a stand on what's important to you, and risk being hurt worse. It would be nice if everyone was honest-hearted like the hero and his parents ... most Christians I have known aren't this mature/loving in relationships. So it rang false for me, like a romance novel would.

And for the record, I am not ""hating on"" the film for religious reasons, although it embarrassed me as a Christian.

That said, I know a number of people who loved the film. They completely missed the author's hand manipulating the scenes, and didn't object to the fraternity-level goofy humor.

It has the required happy ending. No cussing. No nudity.

Viewers may wonder *how* serious the infidelity is. Until the hero took ball-bat to his PC to stop looking at a certain website, we were not led to believe he was being unfaithful too.

I have to ask, HOW could trashing his computer ""solve"" that particular  problem???? Is that kind of violence ""good Christian behavior"" to model?

I know that it hit home for a lot of people, who may have been struggling with some of the same things that were in the movie, such as pornagraphy, having an affair, and the endless arguing that goes on between a husband and wife. Fireproof deals with the day-to-day struggles of a marriage while also cutting deep on in the tough areas. Fireproof also ties in Salvation into the plot. In a world where everyone is getting divorced and no one takes marriage seriously fireproof shows that no matter what there is always hope for your marriage.

I saw a lot of people criticize the acting. It's a Christian movie on a very low budget, they did the best they could and got the point they were trying to make across amazingly well.

This movie is a great example of what happens all to often to people today...relationships are tough, and when the tough gets going people these days seem more likely to run their seperate ways and leave their problems rather than address them and work on them together to improve. People forget why they got married in the first place (and I have known a few couples like this) and they just give up rather than examine what they have to try and repair their relationships and make them better than before.

This movie makes you think about marriage in a different way and certainly encourages alot of Christian values, but even without that aspect of the movie, the lessons learned here are great ones.

I have always been a Kirk Cameron fan (he's hot!), and he was wonderful in this movie. He brought me to tears more than once. He cries so well. His crying almost prompted me to start in with the Growing Pains theme song, ""Show me that smile again! Don't waste another minute on your crying..."" LOL!

As the movie shows us, the solutions to all of the above are not so easy...even when you become a Christian.

3643331,3,B001HN68ZU,"Fires can be dangerous--they can melt metal, burn down buildings, and are definitely not something you want to get caught in.  But isn't fire also sometimes positive?  Can't it provide light in dark areas and be used to ignite powerful engines?  Fireproof captures the dangers of a fiery relationship, but misses an opportunity to parallel those dangers with fire's potential to spark and transform.

Not that a transformation doesn't take place.  From the start, Caleb, the captain at the local fire-station, knows exactly what to expect from his men (all the workers at the station are men in this movie) and from life in general.  He knows he has an important job, and he also knows he is very good at handling the job's responsibility.  Being at home is his time to relax, unwind, and finally not care about anything.

Catherine's job as equipment supervisor at a hospital is very different.  She walks through the hospital overhearing nurses' gossip and having friendly conversations with doctors.  When she is home she wants ways to express her deeper emotions; not simply to ""not care about anything for awhile"" like her husband.

The movie accomplishes what it sets out to do, and achieves a visible (though predictable) growth in how Caleb understands his life.  Be aware the movie sets aside a scene or two to sermonize about sins and salvation.  It also selectively passes moral judgments.  It condemns Caleb's computer habits, while excusing, even admiring, his continued use of violence as an acceptable solution to problems, including threatening one of Catherine's coworkers for whom he suspects Catherine is developing feelings.  The message is: ""It's acceptable for a husband to physically threaten any of his wife's male friends.""

In a scene at the hospital cafeteria, an older female hospital employee, playing the role of mentor to Catherine, asks to sit down by her, and then rather than enjoying Catherine's company or beginning a conversation, excuses herself to silently bless her food.  There is no harm in this behavior, and perhaps it's an important and meaningful habit in this lady's life, but ideally shouldn't the act of sharing a meal with Catherine be blessing enough?

I wish the movie had portrayed the positive side of fire as a way of going beyond this exact sort of peaceful emotional sterility.",1236124800,,2334,5.033854166666667

3643335,4,B001HN68ZU,"You do not have to be a Christian to like this movie. If you are not, however, you will probably gag over the repeated and unequivocal references to Jesus. No watered down Oprah ""spirituality"" here; this is the real stuff, as Potterville Nick says in ""It's A Wonderful Life"", ""Hey, look, mister; we serve hard drinks in here for men who want to get drunk fast."" Well, Fireproof serves the same variety of strong liquor, and if you're not looking for an intense experience, you'd best go elsewhere. In Fireproof, there is one answer about God, not a bunch of them. There is one way to love, not a smorgasbord where we select the ones we like and pass over the troublesome ones. If you have been filled with the ""Every idea is equally good"" mindlessness, then it is likely you will hate this film.

Unless you're willing to contemplate an option. Now, I am pretty biased, but the best marriages I'm aware emulate the practices here, for better or for worse. The people I know with multiple failed marriages behind them, and even more failed ""relationships"", often with a disdain for truth and a belief in their victimhood, would scorn such shallow and simple minded pap as ""Fireproof."" ""Life is too complex,"" they'd say. ""Sure, that would work if you found the right person."" ""How do I know he will reciprocate?"" ""I've tried to give to her, but she never gives back."" ""The is too easy."" This despite all their failure.....

Well, this film tells you that you do not find the right spouse, you become the right spouse. Marriage is choice, and once you make that choice, you have to stand up and honor the decision. God makes it easier to do so, as He provides a standard and a wonderful example of unconditional love, but one could certainly live this way without a belief in God. So don't let that keep you away.

And don't let the amateur acting dissuade you either. While some are good and some are not as good, the story and the theme drive this film, not the performances. So yes, some of the acting is clunky. Big deal. This isn't Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart; this isn't some elaborate or complex or extravagant scene; there are no grand gestures, wild plot lines, or mind-boggling twists. Fireproof is a vivid portrait of what can easily happen in a typical suburban marriage between two ordinary people. Strife manufactures itself, carelessness descends into cruelty, self tramples giving, and pop psychology jargon justifies it all.

There are many things to like about this movie. Its central metaphor is prefect. A marriage is a team that is exposed to harsh and brutal trials, and though the temptation is to escape, that does not work. The world is a blast furnace doing its best to destroy every solid marriage. Temptation, condescension, belittling, and offers of escape are everywhere. Commitment is seen as silly and naive and foolish. ""Time to be moving on down the road, babe"" is the way we think.

Now, I wonder how the filmmakers hope to disseminate these ideas. I know they are good ones; they've been proved both throughout history and in my life. But their audience is going to be those pre-disposed to a Christian point of view (though I guess many marriages there could use a lift.) The vast unbelieving world will pass this by as the simple minded jabbering of the easily gulled church yahoos. How to get them to sit down and watch? How to get them to actually contemplate the option presented? Well, all I can say is that if you've read this far, give it a try. Want a better marriage?

Reviews stating that the acting is awesome, or that the movie as a whole is awesome are as emotionally driven and lack as much descriptiveness as the trolls leaving 1 star reviews. This is not an 'awesome' movie, but it is a decent one, if for no other reason than it is telling a story that deeply resonates with many in America who are vastly under represented by Hollywood. And no I'm not talking about the Christian message. I'm talking about those whom are in the midst of a troubled marriage, a theme that isn't dependent on any religion to be important and worth making movies about with a divorce rate of 50% or so.

The main point of this movie is that marriages don't work when one or both participants are not willing to work with each other, communicate, and practice loving one another despite the difficulties of life. There are plenty of movies that aptly depict marriages falling apart:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Beauty/dp/B00003CWL6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Beauty</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Revolutionary-Road/dp/B001KZIRKE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Revolutionary Road</a>&nbsp;for example. There are very few that tackle the topic of restoration seriously. Most Hollywood productions that deal with couples mending their marriage issues tend to be comedies and lack a serious take on the subject (think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleepless-in-Seattle/dp/B0000AOV4I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleepless in Seattle</a>). Forgiveness, humility, and good communication are all things that any marriage would benefit from and are not dependent on a Christian world view to value, and this movie does a decent job of showing how those applying them can heal a troubled relationship.

That said, the acting and technical quality of FIREPROOF are fairly low. The acting is average at best, and most of the special effects and camera work are amateurish. However, a good story is a good story regardless of the trappings, and so I still enjoyed this film.

3/5 Stars. Worth renting if you are not offended by the strong Christian world view that is presented in the film. If you dislike Christianity as a whole, obviously this is one you should skip.",1235952000,,2404,5.942196531791907

3643347,1,B001HN68ZU,"Sorry, but in the post-Bush age can we really trust evangalicals to teach us about right and wrong.  Their fantasies only exist in movies like these, and teach us little about reality.",1235952000,17,184,4.75
3643348,2,B001HN68ZU,"GOOD PARTS: Something about this movie made me want to see it to the end. The selfishness that ruined the marriage was well portrayed. And of course, I wanted to see the struggle and renewal. I love focus on the husband character as the one who, like Christ, has to suffer for the wife, the Church. Like the Church, the wife is not too deserving. (I don't know what he sees in her, she winces too much.)

BAD PARTS: The script was cornier than a bag of tortilla chips and almost as preachy as the 700 Club. I was expecting Kirk Cameron's ""dad"" character to look into the camera and offer to heal somebody's lumbago.
The action was predictable; so much more could have been done. For instance: instead of smashing the computer, Kirk could have taken it outside to smash it and then said, ""What's wrong with me? This thing's worth money!"" Then he could have called the newspaper and placed an ad. Then he could have set it back down in its old place and looked at it, feeling tempted and realizing that the safest course would be to smash it. A little more realistic for a guy who has been hoarding money for a boat. Unf. most of the solutions are just that easy, especially the ""getting saved."" God comes down Deus ex machina and makes everybody a nice decent Christian. Interesting how the very sympathetic best friend gets around the question of his divorce and remarriage, which Christ clearly forbids in the gospel. (It doesn't seem to apply to saved people.) The Christians are glossier than Currier and Ives.

UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS ESSENTIAL TO THE MEANING OF MARRIAGE:
The film does not even mention contraception. The childlessness of the couple is unexplained as if fruitfulness is some side issue unessential in Christian marriage.
A parallel can be drawn about their spiritual lives. They now have the pleasure of being with God but where is the fruitfulness? The sun shines down on an empty, barren cross. God did it for you, go back to your McMansion and have fun. What about taking up our cross and following him?",1235952000,12,2025,4.622222222222222

They are thinking of other couples they can loan it, too, that are going through hard times.  I have also loaned out my second copy of it to 3 other people, and they have all said it was excellent.

Remove these things from a marriage and what you have left is time for each other.  Your spouse becomes your focus of the day, your evening entertainment, your late-night show, your cyber-girl/guy, your everything!

In the movie, there is a booklet called, ""The Love Dare"".  This (now a book by that name) is an indispensable companion to making a steadfast marriage union.

3643366,5,B001HN68ZU,"Okay, I'm not surprised that the Oscars overlooked this one -- partially because there were better movies done by more experienced and more financed filmmakers and partially because they prefer promoting movies like ""Milk"" and ""Doubt"".  Does this mean one cannot enjoy this picture?

Actually, this movie did get some negative reviews.  One reviewer said that the negative reviews focused on the technical shortcomings, but my hunch is that if it was a horror movie some of those negative reviewers would give more slack, that the heart is they did not agree with the message.

Let's get to the movie first.  It is a drama, and deserves its PG rating -- some of the marriage difficulty scenes are too intense for the real young who should never see scenes like that on video or in real life.  As a drama, it is one that you'd need a kleenix for.  However, it effectively blends in moments of roll in the floor laughter (tomato juice -- you'll get it if you see the movie) and edge of the seat suspense.  There are some predictable parts in it, but bigger name films don't avoid predictability either.  And many of the predictable scenes are more predictable in the problem rather than in the resolution.  (For example, when a car is caught on the tracks, does anybody expect them to get the car out of the way without a train coming down the track?)

I have not seen Flywheel, but I have seen Facing The Giants.  My wife and I enjoyed looking for familiar faces, and there are some, but most of them are not a major part of the movie.

Some reviews make the point of where the marriage theme ends and the Christianity theme begins.  One can try to separate the two, but that is not a natural separation.  Biblically, God instituted marriage in the second chapter of the Bible, and it is dealt with by Jesus and by the New Testament writers.  One can have a good marriage without Christ, but it is tough.

As I said, this is not the greatest movie of all time.  But I believe it's probably enjoyable to anyone who wants to enjoy it.",1235779200,,2031,4.487738419618529

3643378,5,B001HN68ZU,"Fireproof is a drama, it isn't really an action film.  It is also pretty low budget so don't expect high end special effects.  But it does have a story to tell and does a pretty solid job of doing it.

The acting for the most part is not good, most of it is poor but the actors do try and you can tell.  Kirk Cameron's acting is fine, maybe not acedemy award excellence, but honestly he does play his role very well with a more well trained supporting cast this film would really have shined and his performance might have stood out even more.  The Lt. he plays off of does a pretty solid if not great job, and the actor playing his character's dad does a fine job.  Most of the scenes with just Kirk and his dad are excellent and that is why I think with a better cast you might think even more highly of Kirk's work.

The story is excellent, and for one who is married very much how things are.  Mariage is more about learning about how to live with each other then you can know until you get there.  It also takes constant care and work, something Kirk's character learns along the journey he takes in the film.

My wife brought this home and I was tempted to skip it, but after a bit I got sucked in.  I saw in Kirk's character many of the flaws I had as a husband, and have tried to overcome.  Learning to pitch in around the house even when you are tired, learning to give up some personal things for each other, and learning to do for each other without being asked all sound so simple.  But wait until you get married, what once seemed simple can overwhelm and evade you.  You have to be dedicated to your spouse and family in ways I can not even write, but the film does a good job of showing.

Sure production quality and general side character acting is subpar, but generally clean.  But the main character and story are excellent and well done.  I really enjoyed it a ton.

Just for the record I am not a bible belt person, I live in NY and was born and raised in NJ.  I'm north eastern all the way, I am not born again nor does the concept work for me.  I am christian though but even were I not many of the points and the general theme really should resonate with any married person.",1235520000,,2197,4.136792452830188

It is hard to even see a relationship between the two main characters, it is hard to see how anybody can see this for more than 15 minutes to be true.

I believe the media is the main source of our problems brainwashing our children, teenagers and adults. Not excusing anyone's choices they make....but when your young and dumb not knowing how to live and your watching the crap they have on tv you can be influenced by it eventually your morals gradually go away one by one alowly and then you end up getting high or drunk to deal with problems like many people do today. Why not give people good wholesome things to watch instead of junk. I guess just think about this and then go see the movie cause it rocks. end of story.",1235088000,,874,4.271084337349397
3643404,5,B001HN68ZU,"""FireProof"" is an excellent Christian based movie that is a must see for all married couples!  My introduction to the movie came from New Light Christian Center Church's decision to show this outstanding movie to all married couples and singles that desire to be married.

The only familiar actor in the movie was Kirk Cameron, but due to the excellent and awesome performance from each character in the movie...star power was not an issue.

Kirk portrays a Fireman who is respected at work for his chosen profession, but at home he feels like he does not get the love and respect he deserves.  His profession trains him to never leave his partner, but at home he has forgotten this rule.  As space and distance enter the marriage, so does negative competition.  Kirk has a fascination with internet porn and a very married Doctor at the hospital where his wife works, has his cheating eyes on her.  The good Doctor is sending flowers, hiding his marital status and doing all the things that the husband is not doing.  After divorce becomes a possible reality, a family member who has experienced a troubled marriage and was able to turn it into a better marriage through faith based acts, prayer and love...provides the husband with the tools needed to save his marriage.  Also a co-worker at the Fire Department shares how his marriage came to be what God designed marriage to be like.  In between the marital issues, the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat with the various daily runs of the Fire Department.  The close to death calls give you new perscpectives on life.

I highly recommend the movie and the book!  You can use this as a ministry tool at church, a couseling tool, or have some couples over to view the movie and call it ""Marriage Commitment"" movie party.  I hope more churches will do as my church did and promote this movie.  The movie will generate some awesome discussions, save some marriages, heal some relationships and help a single person decide if they are really up for the work that marriage requires.  Yes, this movie will do all of that and more!  It may even make someone rededicate themselves to Christ.

This is a must have for your library.  BUY IT and get one for a friend.

3643405,1,B001HN68ZU,"It had a great message, but it contained,in my opinion,terrible acting, too much preaching, too much of a predictable outcome.

It was a B movie all the way, but fell below that standard almost.

I still say it has a great message for all married couples, for all men and women planing on getting maried, and all folks that their marriage may be in diar straights...",1235001600,28,366,4.53030303030303
3643406,5,B001HN68ZU,"Not the perfectly made movie but with the budget they had, they did a great job. I appreciate the message that the movie is pushing which is to fight for your marriage (for the believer) and come to Christ (for the unbeliever).",1235001600,,227,4.428571428571429

3643408,4,B001HN68ZU,"While I agree that the acting isn't the greatest I've seen, we have to remember that the message behind is why Fireproof is so powerful.  As a minister who is in the process of utilizing The Love Dare principle with my wife and family, I have found that the movie shows us what happens when we just put half our heart into it.  We each have to be willing to commit 100% (not 50/50).  So do I recommend the movie for the acting-no.  Do I recommend it because it has a message that ALL couples need in today's active world--ABSOLUTELY!!!!",1235001600,,536,4.33
3643409,4,B001HN68ZU,I bought this because it was said that all couples should see this. I truly agree. Marriage is for life and you need to give it your all before you give up. I yelled at both the actors to just stop but in the end I was happy.,1235001600,,225,3.7083333333333335

3643413,1,B001HN68ZU,"Watching this movie reminded me why Kirk Cameron has not worked in about 15 years.  His acting is simply horrible.  I couldn't tell if it was the writing or the directing or simply his overall lack of ability but this may have been the worst movie of 2008/9.  I totally get that the ultra-right wing evangelical viewers want to pump up the rating so people will be duped into thinking it's good, or even tolerable but it's not.  Save you self the pain and skip this flick.",1234915200,23,472,4.390804597701149
3643414,5,B001HN68ZU,"Fireproof is an awesome movie concerning marriage, our relationship to God and our relationship to one another.  This movie gives a beautiful illustration as to the way God intended marriage.  The romance should never have to leave after the wedding vows are over.  It also demonstrates the unconditional love that we need in a marriage - the same unconditional love that God himself gives to us.  This is a wonderful movie and I would highly recommend it to anyone who feels lost in a marriage, anyone who wants a deeper relationship with God, and anyone who just wants to know that unconditional love that God gives us freely.",1234915200,,628,4.787037037037037

Families who are struggling with conflict with parents or siblings can also relate. Friends, who are true friends can be identified by the instructions show in this movie.  If we loose sight of our Creator, we loose sight of self.  If we really want to succeed, there is no half-way.  Very well done and you don't have be of any religious demonination to appreicate the uplifting values demonstrated by this movie.  I give it an A ..

My husband actually wanted to turn the tv off after about 10 minutes (which we should have done) but we instead watched the whole movie.  Do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie... just read the book and you will take away with it a wonderful message.

I actually love and respect my wife again like it was in the beginning.  If you're having troubles with your marriage, YOU NEED TO WATCH THIS FILM!!!!",1234915200,,575,4.572815533980583
3643418,2,B001HN68ZU,"I finally saw the ""Christian"" romance film Fireproof this last weekend for Valentines Day. My wife liked it... so did everyone else I saw it with at the little Valentines Day social that our local church put on (at least as far as I could tell). People were talking about buying it, that it was such a great film.

Me? Well... I watched the whole thing. But it seemed to me to be more-or-less just a Harlequin romance with an alter call, and a serious ideological bent. What I mean is this - there are several marriages either portrayed or mentioned in the film: there is the main character Kirk Cameron's marriage, which is on the rocks, and heading for divorce, until he accepts Jesus; there is his parent's marriage, which was on the rocks at one time, but then they accepted Jesus, and all is bliss; there are the two marriages of Kirk Cameron's co-worker at the fire station, for the first one, he hadn't accepted Jesus in time so it ended in divorce, the second was after he accepted Jesus, and was evidently blissful; finally, there is the doctor, who takes a romantic interest in Kirk Cameron's wife, and who hides his wedding ring in his desk, obviously doesn't have Jesus, and his marriage is heading for ruin. The message in the film is clear, if you accept Jesus your marriage will be bliss, if you don't accept Jesus your marriage is destined for ruin and divorce.

The thing is actual life isn't quite as idealistic as this film portrays. All marriages have problems. We're all people, we're all sinners, and we all make mistakes. But I've seen married couples who've not ""accepted Jesus"" that are doing just fine, moving right along with its bumps and occasional potholes, but far from ruin and divorce. More importantly though, I have also seen many couples throughout the years, who have ""accepted Jesus"" much like the film portrays, and whose marriages have not gone so well. Divorce still happens. And when real life doesn't match the idealization that is promised, people lose faith.

But the thing that gets me about the film, it's not just that we have imperfect married people, who still continue to sin, even after they have accepted Jesus, and they have to continually repent and overcome the effects of that sin that prevent it from being truly bliss. No, that's not it. It's that God doesn't anywhere promise that your marriage will be bliss if you follow Jesus in the first place.

The film tries to say that if you do things Jesus' way, if you follow the rules, and stick with it (kind of like the 40-day self-help challenge that Kirk Cameron's father gives him), and this goes beyond just marriage, that things are going to be great, you are going to be blest. Now go read about Job and his three friends. Yup, that's the same general message Job's three friends gave him that God scolded them on at the end of the book. Now go read about Hosea, and how his biblically arranged marriage to that harlot went. Yup, I'd say the message this film is trying to say is the wrong message. God isn't about the business of blessing your marriage just because you accepted Jesus. No, he has an altogether different idea in mind.

But besides all that... I guess I could say the film was kinda cute. My wife liked it. And the points in the self-help challenge are good advice. I think I'll do them.",1234828800,14,3317,4.568067226890756
3643419,5,B001HN68ZU,My wife and I really enjoyed this movie.  It is well done and delivers a strong message about what it means to be committed to your marriage.,1234828800,,141,4.222222222222222
3643420,5,B001HN68ZU,"Wonderful movie! Excellently written and acted (a few of the church member actors were a little awkward but that's okay).  Great direction.  I would put the 40 days list with the DVD so couples could get started on it right after the movie!

MAKE MORE MOVIES, church in Georgia!  Wouldn't it be great if more churches or Christian groups could get movies like this out there!",1234828800,,375,4.636363636363637
3643421,5,B001HN68ZU,"If you plan on buying or watching Fireproof then it is best to know that this movie is all about the message and not about the cinematography or acting.  Fireproof is a movie dedicated to helping couples find the love back in their relationship.  The true basis of this film is that no matter how hard you try another person no matter how much you love them will not fill the void entirely.  The movie is about finding Christ and letting him love you and in return you can love others with more energy and deeper than you could have before.

It is a great movie to watch whether you are in a relationship or not.  If people are able to learn the lesson of this movie before entering a relationship then that will only help your life.  The movie's acting is a bit corny but that should be somewhat expected.  If you can get past that then I believe that everyone will take something away from this movie.",1234742400,,903,4.3076923076923075
3643422,5,B001HN68ZU,"This movie was great! It is a movie that every married couple should watch! They did a great job putting this movie together! It brought tears to our eyes. My husband is a very masculine guy and it even got him teared up! It really hits home to a very large problem in our world: divorce. This movie helps inspire couples to hang in there and gives them some tools to work with. Ya, you can hang in there, but ""how"" do you make things better? If you haven't seen the movie, please rent (or buy) it and watch it. You won't be sorry. It is better than most movies which large budgets. It's a MUST SEE MOVIE!!!!",1234742400,,608,4.161016949152542
3643423,5,B001HN68ZU,"The Bible says that is pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to win the lost. Thinking that this movie will reach the lost is foolish as well, the acting is spotty at best, the editing and special effects are what you would expect for  TBN movie, and there are no big stars in the film. Reminds me of a lot of sermons I heard growing up when the preacher was less than artful with the text, and wasn't as prepared as one would like, BUT, at the end, people believed in Jesus. Why? Because God wants the glory on him, and it pleased him to use that man with that sermon to save those people.

That is the case with this movie. I am a movie snob, and can rattle off the laundry list of failings this movie has both from a technical and artistic point of view. But I absolutely loved this movie. The portrayal of a selfish man, gripped by his own lust and the devastation it caused to his wife and his marriage were spot on. It also did a great job of showing how he did not even think he had a problem, but his outward anger towards his wife and his demanding, confrontational encounters with her proved otherwise. The conversion scene was probably the first I have seen (that was not based on historical figures) that came off as genuine. The reconciliation in the marriage was something I have seen before (and I have seen failure too), and it was well done. The message here, that God empowers those who come to him to be the right kind of husband, is accurate.

As this trend in Christian movie making continues, the production values will rise, the talent pool will get deeper, and the commercial success will get bigger and bigger. However, those films will fail to have the lasting impact of a movie like Fireproof if they are not bathed in prayer every step of the way, and are not characterized by obedience to God during production as this one was. Hollywood could do movies like this, but will not , because they are not content to let the message of the gospel make it to the screen unchanged. Those of us who love Jesus Christ recognize his truth when we see it, and we saw it in this film and it resonated with us.

The selfless picture of being a husband is one that will have (and has had) far greater impact than the movie that came before this which focused more on the ""health wealth just obey God and you'll be a success"" message. God may add a few children to the Kingdom through a football program at a high school, but he adds (and keeps) far more through faithful husbands and wives who put him first. The family is the building block of the Kingdom of God (it is that from which churches are built), and the building block of society. The societies produced and the churches made are effective if the family places the Lordship of Christ at the head of the priority list, and fireproof shows a couple who are now ready to take their place in the church and affect society.

By the way, I really liked that Caleb paid off his in-laws medical equipment and did not even tell his wife about it, seemingly on the day his wife dropped the divorce papers on him. When she saw that he had done that, and not even called her attention to it, she saw his transformation clearly and came back to him. That was a great plot element.

Anyway, I highly recommend this movie to believers, especially to those whose marriages are being ravaged by the sin of lust. Very true to life portrayal of what pornography does to a marriage.",1234742400,,3445,4.349922239502333
3643424,5,B001HN68ZU,"I didn't expect much since I knew it was low-budgeted film but this movie really moved my heart. I sincerely learned a lot by watching and it helped me to realize a lot of things about myself as well. I encourage everyone who is married or unmarried to watch it. Maybe the acting isn't top hollywood notch but I guarantee that the content and the point of the movie is very heart-wrenching. This movie is no near trying to preach or trying to ""convert"" people to Christianity. However, this movie does display the TRUTH...the struggles of men and the insides of our hearts. Anyone who is/are struggling in their marriage or relationships should watch it because I believe that this movie speaks a loud & clear message for itself...that a Marriage is a covenant of a life time. A wonderful and great movie! I can not stress this enough. There is not one thing I would change about this movie. Some might find that the acting might be ""not good"" but it has a bit of everything...humor, drama, thrill and the truth. I loved it. Well thought out movie.",1234742400,,1048,4.550264550264551

3643426,5,B001HN68ZU,"On Valentine's Day, I went to a banquet at my church where we were shown the highly successful ""Fireproof.""  When it was over, there was nary a dry eye in the fellowship hall.  An extremely emotional, poignant film, ""Fireproof"" deals with one fireman's struggle to mend broken relationships in his life, primarily the one between him and his wife.

  ""Fireproof"" is a great teaching tool for anyone, married or single, who needs help rebuilding a broken relationship.  It can be a relationship between a spouse, parent, sibling or friend.  It teaches how to forgive according to how the Lord forgave us.  He loves us no matter how many times we reject Him and his love.  We can not truly love another person until we learn to love Him according to His will.

  At first, I detested fireman Caleb Holt (Kirk Cameron of the ""Left Behind"" series) for not being sensitive to his wife's feelings.  However, after his encounter with the Lord, he began to transform into a caring, loving person who I grew to respect.  I had to admire him for never giving up on fixing his broken marriage despite his wife's stubbornness.

  Thanks to the film ""Fireproof,"" I will soon be attending the marriage enrichment series ""Fireproof Your Marriage.""  I am single, however, I feel that this Christian series will help me improve my relationships with family, friends, coworkers and even strangers.  After all, we are commanded to love one another just as Jesus loved us.

  I highly recommend that all Christians watch ""Fireproof.""  It is also recommended that churches show it to their congregations as a teaching tool for strengthening and rebuilding relationships.  If your church is having problems unifying its members, ""Fireproof"" may help.",1234656000,,1728,4.940766550522648
3643427,4,B001HN68ZU,"I loved Fireproof.  It's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and although it's nearly two hours long, I could watch it over and over again.  I think that Sherwood Pictures is honing its talent, and is beginning to make films that not only carry good messages, but also stand up technically.  I thought the cinematography was flawless, the soundtrack was great - during the action scenes and the more heartfelt ones - and everything was well put together.  Some of the acting could have been better, but overall everyone did an okay job.  Kirk Cameron, as the established actor in the cast, was perfect as Caleb Holt.  He was very convincing, and it was surprising to see him play an average everyday Joe as well as he did.  The comedic relief was well placed, and didn't take away from the emotional tone of the story.  And the gospel message wasn't cheesy and didn't seem forced - which is a rarity in Christian films.  I was surprised that Fireproof made close to $3,000,000 when I first heard the box office reports, but after watching the DVD, I'd say it was definitely earned.",1234656000,,1094,4.540816326530612
3643428,1,B001HN68ZU,"Not only are Alex and Stephen Kendrick brothers, but they're also the media and teaching pastors at Sherwood Church of Albany in Georgia. The Sherwood Baptist Church congregation has been financing films, such as ""Flywheel"" (2003) and ""Facing the Giants"" (2006), and volunteers act in these low-budget productions. ""Facing the Giants"" dealt with a losing Christian high school football coach under pressure to win games, while ""Flywheel"" concerned a morally unscrupulous car dealer who swindled his customers, verbally abused his spouse, and neglected his son. In ""Fireproof"" the Kendricks tackle the marital woes of twenty-somethings. The metaphor for marriage that the brothers invoke is drilled into every fireman in the Albany, Georgia, Fire Department: 'Never leave your partner behind.' Like all their movies, the Kendrick Brothers want to spread the word of Christ on celluloid to save souls, so prepare yourself for some immaculate Christian propaganda.

Gung-ho workaholic Fire Chief Caleb Holt (Kirk Cameron of ""Left Behind: the Movie"") and his pretty brunette hospital P.R. wife Catherine (Erin Bethea of ""Facing the Giants"") are struggling to maintain their marriage after seven years. Catherine doesn't spend enough time shopping for them at the grocery store, and sex-starved Caleb spends too much time surfing Internet porn sites. She can get neither a wheelchair nor a hospital bed for her stroke-stricken mom. When she isn't at the hospital, Catherine spends every weekend at her parents' house. Meanwhile, callous Caleb dreams of owning his own boat. Each confides in their friends that the other is impossible to live with and each claims that the other doesn't realize all the pain that they have stirred up. Worse, our hero and heroine don't go to Sherwood Baptist Churchill, and their future happiness as a couple is doomed unless they become Christians.

During one of Caleb's temper tantrums, hubby gets up in wifey's face, and Catherine utters the dreaded D word--divorce--because he frightens her. Along comes Caleb's born-again, evangelical father John Holt (Harris Malcolm), who suffers a four-hour drive to see junior. John presents Caleb with a 40-day Biblically-inspired ""Love Dare"" manual to mend marriages with scriptures. Dear old, white-haired dad assures junior in solemn tones that the manual succeeded for mom and he. Caleb refuses to discuss God, but he is desperate enough to resort to the manual. Twenty days later, Caleb witnesses no visible change in his wife's adamant attitude. In fact, Catherine suspects everything that he is doing is designed to make her look bad in divorce court! Moreover, Caleb doesn't know that Catherine is flirting with a philandering physician, Dr. Anderson (Walter Burnett of ""Flywheel""), who is separated from his own wife. Caleb is at his wits end. He's brought her cheap flowers, stopped arguing with her, and washed the dishes. What more can a guy do?! Caleb's black firefighting buddy tells him to stop acting like a pinch-penny. Eventually, Caleb converts to Christianity and suddenly everything comes up roses. He wins Catherine back, and they reaffirm their vows as Christians and live happily ever after.

Just about all movies--Hollywood or independent--spout propaganda. Propaganda in a movie only bothers me when the movie stinks like stale cheese. Unfortunately, most propaganda movies conform their stories so that the stories serve the propaganda. ""Fireproof"" qualifies as nothing short of a Sunday morning sermon. Heavy-handed as the Kendricks are with their life affirming message, their latest squeaky clean melodrama doesn't even have the depth of a 1960s soap opera. Nobody but an aggressive, hardcore churchgoer would tolerate this predictable potboiler. Best known for his TV show ""Growing Pains,"" Kirk Cameron hams it up as Caleb along with an amateurish cast in this hopelessly unrealistic drama. Indeed, we feel no sympathy for either of the leads. Caleb is downright obnoxious, while Catherine is ignornant. Erin Bethea has a future in soap commercials. No doubt, the Kendrick congregation and churches that support mindless, antiseptic movies will pack in their flocks for this loquacious fare. Interestingly, blacks and whites intermingle in a denomination free form of Christianity. Further, no churches are shown during the action. Eventually, ""Fireproof"" will come to a church near you and Christian marriage counselors will no doubt urge congregational showings.

You might perspire for a tense second or two during a car removal scene on a railway track. Otherwise, nobody gets within hailing distance of death in ""Fireproof"" so the movie lacks any real honest-to-God drama. Naturally, the firefighting sequences are routine compared with those in the Kurt Russell movie ""Backdraft"" (1991) about Chicago firefighters. Furthermore, no firefighter in his right mind would remove his gear during a blaze like Caleb does in one sequence. Caleb and Catherine are so monumentally moronic that they should have gotten a divorce. Not only are they numb-skulls, they are dull numb-skulls. At one point, the ""Love Dare"" manual recommends that the owner rid themselves of anything that might be an addiction. Caleb destroys his Internet computer with a baseball bat. Wouldn't it have been easier to install an anti-porn feature? Furthermore, when Caleb takes days off from the fire department, he forgets to do everything but sleep and stare at porn. The Holts are the most irresponsible married couple imaginable.

Georgia-based Tyler Perry makes Christian-themed films about African-Americans that do not insult your intelligence with their complete lack of subtlety. Okay, the best moments in ""Fireproof"" are the funniest and they involve the next door neighbors, the black hospital nurses aides, and the goofy white fireman who chugs Wrath of God hot sauce. These moments constitute only about a tenth of the film's two hour feature length. The rest of the characters consist of stereotypes in situations that are predictable. Just because you're a Christian doesn't mean that you have to support amateurish Christian movies. ""Fireproof"" amounts to nothing more than a polished Christian scare film from the 1950s about drug, sex, and sex abuse.  Comparatively, ""Facing the Giants"" and the low-budget ""Flywheel"" surpassed this dross. If you really want to see a GOOD Christian movie, watch ""A Walk to Remember"" where the characters aren't a bunch of nitwits!

Fireman Caleb Holt is having a rocky time with his marriage, from his addiction with porn to his wife's resentment about how he's so often gone. Fights in their house are daily, from snide to yelling and with cutting remarks from both sides. When his wife, Catherine, finally tells him in tears that she just wants out, he yells back that that's fine with him. The marriage seems destined to end, until Caleb's Christian father sends him a package with a book called ""The Love Dare"", a 40-day challenge for couples on unconditional love. Caleb begins it tentatively, without telling his wife, and learns to persevere even after she gives him nothing in return.

You can guess that things turn out well, this being a Christian film with the message to never give up. I, however, was not by any means satisfied with the actions of some of the characters by the time the movie ended. From the beginning, the couple Caleb and Catherine have iniquities between them that keep them apart: Caleb has his occasional porn addiction, his work, a bad temper, and his unconditional demand for respect; Catherine has a flirting man at work who treats her better than her husband does, stupid negative friends that tell her to give up, biting sarcasm, and her unconditional demand for respect. Both are convinced that the other's the problem; both have issues they need to work on. The problem is, both of them do NOT end up focusing on fixing themselves. For the first 50 minutes of the film, Caleb does all the work in the marriage.

I understand that love is about giving relentlessly without expecting a reward, but I found some of Catherine's treatment of her husband to be inexcusably rude. He buys her flowers, she sniffs at them; he makes her coffee, she stalks out; he says he'll take care of something important, she grouches that he should have done it already. After he fixes her dinner, she coldly says she doesn't love him. Then, after he gets rid of his own final hurdle by destroying all his computer software and leaves a note saying he loves her, she leaves the divorce papers on his desk. Now, some of this is understandable; what I realized after watching this movie again was that Catherine was, simply put, very scared and confused. After the dinner scene, the film shows her crying in bed. After Caleb's failed first attempts to please her, the film shows her telling her friends about it and being told in return that, in their experience, he's probably just trying to butter her up for the divorce (this, and the fact that Caleb's heart wasn't really in it for the first few tasks and Catherine could tell, explains why she wasn't receptive to him). But you can certainly feel Caleb's terrible frusteration when her biggest rejection comes about. He endures this heartbreak in silence, still doing everything he can to please her, even tending to her while she's sick in bed. And at this point, I think Catherine could have opened up a little more; Caleb had been in earnest for some time. All this sacrifice, all this enduring of her snipishness, wins him nothing but an ""I am not ready to trust you again"" from her when she's sick in bed, after finding the Love Dare book. The scene ends with her softening, but really; enough is enough.

Though I sympathized with Catherine, there were times when I thought she was just a spoiled brat, especially while she was accepting the flirtatious behavior of that jerk-doctor at work while her husband was treating her well AND trying so hard to save their marriage. Even when she finally ran to the firehouse to re-declare her love for him, even then, it didn't show her literally say ""I'm sorry"" for her own disrespect to him. Why? I guess the filmmakers focused more on their embrace and her love declaration at the moment and apologies occured in private, but it would have been NICE to hear an ""If I haven't told you I'm sorry, I am"" right after her ""If I haven't told you I forgive you, I have"" line.

Not only was Caleb the only one to really offer a lengthy apology, but I noticed that the men were the ones who came out apologizing more: for instance, Caleb finds out that his mother was the one who used the Love Dare in his parents' marriage, not his father. And something else about Caleb's mother: she annoyed me. When Caleb first went to his parents to let off steam about his marriage, his mother started nagging him about how Catherine must have felt working all the time and needing help. What, and Caleb didn't work? Pulling people out of burning buildings, putting his life at risk? Are you forgetting your son does this, woman? And could use some appreciation from his po' little woman now and then? She misses the entire point of listening, and Caleb understandably wants to speak to his father alone then. Later in the film, though, when Caleb finds out his mother and not his father was the one who did the Love Dare, he runs home and weepily asks her forgiveness. For what? My mom, who watched the film with me, said that he'd been short with his mom, but I didn't notice that; what I saw was the old fussy cutting him off and giving him a lecture instead of listening when he needed her. Once again poor Caleb apologized his guts out, even when it seemed unnecessary, to a woman who had not been giving him all HE needed in the relationship either.

Caleb's mother and wife are not the only examples of women in the film acting in irritating ways. Part of the reason that Catherine's so confused about Caleb and her marriage is that she has some very stupid and gossiping friends advising her. While Caleb has wise male friends telling him not to give up, his wife has a bunch of gossiping snits for friends who egg her on, tell her to force her husband to respect her, and encourage her to drop him. Every action she reports from her husband, they sneer at and second-guess for the worst. When one of the biddies overhears Catherine's husband doing something noble for her, she decides not to tell her about it! Catherine's friends had no business telling her to get out of her marriage, and if she had, a great deal of it would have been due to the fact that those foolish and irresponsible women were goading her by painting her husband as a villain and not even bothering to tell her when he did something nice! I hoped that Catherine would tell them off in the end, or at least be shown giving them a glowing report of Caleb, but she never does; the lazy gossips never pay for their actions in the film.

This is undoubtedly a rare film with an amazing message; some parts were just a little much for my nerves, one being the Southern-slurring elderly father with his corny messages and automatic sermons; the dad was awesome and his advice was needed, but occasionally it went a little overboard, and the Kendrick brothers should be careful not to fall into a predictable pattern here. Plus, the unfairly heavy load of accountability on the men and the partially absent responsibility of the women did not sit well with me. If the film had edited Caleb's weepy apology or perhaps Catherine had come across the Love Dare book and tried it privately herself, the film would have had a much more balanced feel. It's remarkable and beautiful. Just do some more editing next time please, guys.",1234569600,10,7285,4.586339217191098

It seemed Kirk Cameron's father and best friend from the firehouse was the same character. And they only talked in ""sermons"" about Jesus Christ.
I was then told that the ending is ""Great!"". I reluctantly tried again to watch it. This time I did. The message is very good. Yet the acting?..... Sorry but I know the actors weren't paid for their participation but I'm betting that there are some decent ones out there that would be willing to volunteer. The dialogue, Like ""Fighting the Giants"" was horrible. These movies really only attract both partial believers and full on believers. There's really no attempt to draw in those without faith. That's were this movie falls short of ""Good"".

It's the Christian base that stereotypes the none believers. They are thicker skinned than what this movie shows.

The plus though was that Kirk can still act. And if he wants to play a 16 year old kid... He can probably still pull that one off with his little boy looks.",1234483200,2,1116,4.51980198019802

3643436,5,B001HN68ZU,"This is the best movie I have ever seen and I've seen a lot of movies. Is it the best quality - no. Is it the best acting - no. However,that is only because it was done on a shoestring budget. Movies like this can't get the expensive and special effects of Hollywood movies but it still does a pretty good job.  It's really sad that there are some people who are going to see that this is a Christian movie and never watch at all or won't follow through. This has so many good lessons for everyone.

There are some fire and accident scenes thrown in that will keep you on the edge of your seat. However, the main part of this movie is that it can help if you're in a marriage - whether good or bad. If you think it's hopeless, it shows it's isn't. If you think it's good, then it shows how to keep it good.  If you had a previous marriage that didn't work out, it can show you how to be a person wothy of being married, finding the mate and being the right mate. If you are wanting to find someone, there are tons of lessons to show you what to do and not do. It can also be a great movie for anyone who has any kind of addiction, whether it be porn, alcohol, drugs, etc.  The scene of him dealing with his addiction was wonderful and the whole idea of how that addiction was destroying his marriage was so important.

Because of time limits, they sort of made one part a bit more speedy. There was a part where she told him that it would be a while before she could trust him again.  Sometimes, it can take nearly a lifetime to rebuild trust but that doesn't mean that life is not wonderful and that marriage is not wonderful in the meantime.  Every little thing they do to prove that trust just makes it better.

My husband loved the surprise ending the father revealed to his son.

One of my favorite parts of this movie, most people won't know. When he had the kissing part with his wife, the scene goes to shadows and his real wife stepped up for that part because they believed that a person should not be kissing someone other than their mate. That's something I hate about other movies and wonder how spouses handle it. No wonder Hollywood divorces are so high.

And when we have question's who's asking them? Is it Detective Waters who missed a clue which kept me under a barn for ten years, or was it his partner who died twelve weeks prior to the wrap of this movie.

I want to be as cherised by my husband as I cherish him, and it can be a reality but it does take work.

Women are more tender and need ""flowers, candy, and nice words.""  If you do not believe that, you are probably not being terribly honest.  Men require respect and honor from their wives.

The lack of quality acting wasn't overly detrimental to the story line.  The comedic moments I thought were over the top.  Goofy more than funny.  My wife and I did laugh quite hard at some of the scenes together.  Many I don't think our response was what the makers intended.  Its not a great movie but the message is good and other than being a little slow, and some not so good acting it was still enjoyable.  Its a movie with a Christian message.

I think it should be a must-see movie for anyone in a relationship: engaged, married or divorced to see what unconditional love does and does not look like and how to incorporate in our daily life in 2009.

3643448,5,B001HN68ZU,"Divorce is pictured as a plastic salt shaker and pepper shaker once glued together with Superglue, but now torn asunder. Pieces of one still stick to the other. This movie has been misrepresented as presenting a ""Stay together and be miserable"" message. Actually, it presents a ""Stay together to work things out and avoid misery"" message.

Complaints about this movie having primitive visual effects also miss the point. This movie is not primarily about the technicalities of fire and firefighting, but about the nature of marriage.

Caleb is all wrapped up in himself. He wants to buy an expensive boat, and sticks all the household chores on his wife, who also works full time. He takes her for granted, and treats her as a servant. To him, online pornography is ""just an outlet."" Not surprisingly, he thinks that his wife is the one who has the problem. For her part, she spurns his sincere efforts to turn over a new leaf, in part because she buys into her friends' suggestion that he has suddenly turned nice on her because he just wants to butter her up for a divorce settlement more favorable to himself. To make things worse, she gets involved in an affair with a married doctor at her workplace.

Caleb's father presents him with a 42-day plan to rescue and revive the marriage. It is one that the father himself was familiar with when his marriage almost collapsed years ago. But it doesn't seem to work at all. There is also an ironic ending to the story of Caleb's parents which I won't reveal here.

This movie reminds us of the fact that marriage is not just a social institution nor just a commitment to the other person. It is a solemn vow before God.

Aside from the therapeutic aspect of this film, the acting quality and cinematography was incredibly poor. The story line was banal.  The characters were flat.  The lines were all over-scripted to the point that anyone with moderate intelligence would have known what the characters were going to say before they said it.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone.  Perhaps it would be useful at a pre-teen youth night at night or after-school special or something of that caliber.

3643468,5,B001HN68ZU,"Fireproof:  An adventure in Marriage
Don't let the cover fool you.  This is no ordinary adventure film.  Beneath the exterior story of a fireman coping with the dangers of  blazing buildings, lies a struggle that every marriage faces.  ""Fireproof"" is a name that applied to buildings and structures, but also relationships as Caleb Holt soon finds out.  Never leave your partner behind applies to marriage too.
The plot is simple.  Caleb and his wife are hitting a tough time in their marriage.  Both feel neither is appreciated, and the inevitable blow up leads to the talk of divorce.  Meanwhile, at `work', Calebs' partner Michael, and co-workers feel the heat and see the separation.  Calebs' father, who almost divorced, gives his son a challenge.  40 Days with a handwritten book called the Love Challenge.  Through 43 days, learns to love his wife, Catherine, unconditionally, while she struggles with a new relationship.  There is pain, there is hurt, there is heroism, and there is love...Fireworks not necessary.
The production company of Sherwood Baptist Church has broken new ground with this, their 3rd film.  Flywheel, Facing the Giants, and now Fireproof cements their reputation as a force to be reckoned with.  Produced by volunteers and a handful of professionals (including Kirk Cameron), this is a first class film sure to strengthen any marriage or courtship.  The Kendricks have a great thing going.
There are some very powerful scenes in this movie.  Caleb by the cross, Catherine forgiving Caleb at the firestation, and the rededication ceremony at the end.  There is something for everyone.
Who can watch this production?  Anyone.
Who should watch this film?  Everyone
I can guarantee that Fireproof will change any marriage for the better!
Along with the film, a host of marriage enrichment products are also available.  Don't shortchange your spouse, and more importantly, Never leave your partner behind.

Too bad Hollywood ignores truth in art. And it is PERFECT for Valentine's Day!",1233705600,9,426,5.014084507042254
3643473,5,B001HN68ZU,"This movie is proof positive that Kirk Cameron has chosen a different career path for himself than the other child stars of his generation. He chooses not to make trashy movies, and this was a low-budget, Christian film that has a great message about marriage and how God can work in your heart to look at your own marriage differently.

It is proven that couples who pray and attend church together have a very low divorce rate.  The more Bible-based the church, the fewer divorces. This is fact.  Love God, love your spouse and family.  Everything falls into place.

Kirk has a wonderful show on the Church Channel, and the title of the show is Kirk Cameron, and it is worth watching.  We see the show through DirecTV.  If you loved the movie, you will love the show.  Ray Comfort is a pastor and good friend of Kirk's, and the two of them have a goal of saving souls from eternal death.  It's great!",1233705600,4,902,4.451219512195122
