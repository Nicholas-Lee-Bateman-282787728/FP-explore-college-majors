8761669,2,B01FWNRFZW,"I brought this beacuse I wanted to watch the whole series of salior moon for one price instead of buying the series in seprate dvd sets or single disk  but with that said lets get to the meat and potatoes of this dvd set when you first open it there are 7 disk each disk having a salior moon character on it however they all have the new salior moon crystal look and not there old original look this dvd set looks miss leading in some ways but thats just a little thing this is still all the original salior moon but it gets your attainion the box set does look very nice (as seen in pictures)

Lets start with dub tracks, Salior Moon season 1has the new Viz Media English dub. However Salior Moon R, Salior Moon S, Salior Moon Super S are in there original english dub from ADV and Salior Moon Stars being only in Japanese the audio can be off from time to time but its still not that big of a issue when you get to the 3 movies it comes with on disk 7 they come with the option to change it to english and Japanese so that was a nice touch

the visuals can be better during fight scenes they get hazy and it might hurt your eyes but not all the time this problem mostly happens when watching salior moon season 1 but so far watching season 4 that problem is not so bad and you can get use to it and sometimes when watching it the lips sync looks off but I understand it being a old english dub sometimes there is a small delay of voice and lip movement but it happens in a very small way and it won't take away the experience

in conclusion this dvd set is put together to watch the entire series just to enjoy it all in one go well it could have been better but it is a bootleg its a decent one at that but not the best if you want the whole series in one fast go then this is for you but remember please support the official release",1472947200,8,1836,3.9809782608695654
