8310789,1,B001IDB96M,"I PAID $35.00 FOR THIS VIDEO, HOPING TO SEE REAL INDEPTH INFORMATION ON BILL VUKOVICH SENIOR.  ALL YOU GET IS A FEW HOME MOVIES, SO DARK YOU CAN BARELY SEE THEM....A VERY INTERESTING INTERVIEW HOWEVER WITH INDY MECHANIC BILL TRAVERS, BUT MOST OF THE INTERVIEW HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH BILL VUKOVICH.  THEN YOU GET A HODGE PODGE OF VIDEOS THAT MAKE NO SENSE...NO VOICE OVER, NO MUSIC.  MOST OF THE INDY VIDEOS OF VUKY ARE PIECES WE HAVE ALL SEEN BEFORE.  RICK VUKOVICH DID A HORRIBLE JOB ON THE DVD.  I LEARNED NOTHING ABOUT BILL VUKOVICH SR.  A TOTAL WASTE OF MY MONEY.",1293580800,,567,4.403846153846154
