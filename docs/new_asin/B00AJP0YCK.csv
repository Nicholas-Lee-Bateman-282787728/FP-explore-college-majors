5444126,3,B00AJP0YCK,"From a historical point of view I would rate it 5 stars but unfortunately the quality of the sound is less positive. It's mono and not stereo and comes from one channel most of the time!
But still it's a must have if you're an Outlaws fan, especially the playin to win era!!",1358812800,,274,4.188679245283019
5444127,5,B00AJP0YCK,"Highly recommended seller with superior product & packaging. Always consistent, prompt, and professional. Fantastic sound/ video quality for each. Honest descriptions and resolution to issues. Die Hard Southern Rock Fans, accept no substitutes!",1357171200,4,244,6.424242424242424
5444128,5,B00AJP0YCK,"Outlaws fans, Hughie Thomasson fans, Billy Jones fans, Southern Rockers...this is a MUST have dvd for you! The sound and video are awesome.  In fact, the camera puts you so close that Hughie and Billy's neck work are incredible.  I never got close enough in the old days to see it like this.  Their speed and precision, leads, and harmonizing guitar work are a real eye opening showcase!!  It puts me back there in better seats than I ever had.",1356566400,4,444,4.5125
5444129,5,B00AJP0YCK,"This is a must have if you're a Outlaw/ Hughie fan! Quaity is not that great, but it is very enjoyable.",1402876800,,103,3.9523809523809526
5444130,5,B00AJP0YCK,"I thought i was eighteen again and was able to go to an Outlaws concert!!! i would give the quality an 8 out of 10. I got shivers watching Henry and Billy !!! I just sat there with my jaw dropped!!! All I could think of was THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU",1399420800,,255,3.830188679245283
5444131,1,B00AJP0YCK,"This dvd is obviously dubbed from a 40 year old vcr tape. You can see the grainy lines running through the entire dvd, and the sound quality is the worst I have ever heard, A total waste of my time, and money",1396656000,3,208,3.9761904761904763
5444132,3,B00AJP0YCK,"Picture quality not perfect, but good enough for true Outlaws fans. I really enjoyed the interview with Hughie. Get this one.",1396396800,,125,5.0
5444133,5,B00AJP0YCK,"The  seller should be commended  for making this dvd and other rare Outlaw cd's available. The quality of the sound and picture from this 35+ year old concert is great. Excellent set list on this show.  Fast shipping, well packaged, I'll be back for more. Don't hesitate to buy from this seller!!!",1394841600,,297,4.673076923076923
5444134,5,B00AJP0YCK,"Great concert of a great Southern Rock band!!! My buddy, about 10yrs my senior, took a bus from South Carolina to visit his friend in Chicago and they went to this show. I found it on here and its gonna be his Christmas present this year. Know he'll love it. Ordered one for myself too, but HLLC forgot to send me two of them. Sent an email, very fast response. Today, I received my copy of this show PLUS another free dvd compilation of Outlaws music for my troubles(which were non existant to be honest). Excellant products, and excellant customer service!!! Every fan of the Outlaws and Hughie's music really should buy these products!!!! Thanks fer making them available to us fans!!!!!",1386547200,,690,4.663934426229508
5444135,3,B00AJP0YCK,should have been remastered for better sound quality. Also the video is not very good and skips a lot during play.,1380672000,3,114,4.476190476190476
5444136,5,B00AJP0YCK,"Another great concert from the road warriors from the 70's! Always a great time
when the Outlaws came to town and lit it up.",1378425600,,124,4.208333333333333
5444137,4,B00AJP0YCK,"If you love this band like I do, you won't be disappointed.  With the shipping charges and dvd cost to the total of $71.00 to Canada, after watching this live show I would of paid $271.00 for this dvd.  This is my favorite time for this band with Hughie, Billy Jones, Freddy Salem and lefty Harvey Arnold Dalton on bass.  With Monte Yoho and David Dix on the drums, this is a great show promoting one of their greatest albums ""Playin' To Win"".
I was warned by the seller about the sound quality.  There are times when the sound could be A+, but for whatever reason, I would rate the sound from good to very good.  Don't be gun-shy about what I just said, it's worth the money!!!!
I have waited so long to see ""Lover Boy"" and "" Cry Some More"" live on a dvd format and now it's complete.

The guys are in a groove all night.  With the unfortunate passing of Hughie Thomasson and Billy Jones, it's a piece of history for all to see.",1371772800,,929,4.185393258426966
5444138,5,B00AJP0YCK,"this is a top notch concert, hughie and billy playing really great, freddie salem doing a great job as well on guitar and vocals,and harvey grate on bass ,but the only thing i don't like about the video is it never views the concert as a whole band the whole spotlights are on billy and hughie you don't see any of david dix and monty yoho on their drumkits,or freddie doing a solo but its an outlaw recording .and it rocks!!",1363564800,2,425,4.2592592592592595
8552697,5,B00AJP0YCK,"Having a dvd of The Outlaws during the 1970's is worth its weight in gold.  The technical quality leaves something to be desired, however, it is easily overlooked from the joy of being able to revisit performances of the era.  Billy and Hughie are incredible during this concert and their legacy can now live on through the ages.....As an extra bonus I received an Outlaws cd in my order.  Thank you so much!!!",1507161600,,410,4.589041095890411
8552698,5,B00AJP0YCK,Awesome! Thank You Joe !!!,1489536000,,26,4.4
8552699,1,B00AJP0YCK,"Extremely poor quality. Even as a.long time die hard Outlaws fan, I didn't enjoy this.",1457481600,,86,4.8
8552700,4,B00AJP0YCK,"This is great if you are an Outlaws fan. Video quality and sound mix are not so good, but there is not much in the way of videos documenting this extraordinary southern rock band. Great guitar playing, great songs, and good singing. If you are a fan, as I am, you can overlook the video and sound issues. If video and sound quality is important to you, this might not be your cup of tea. Video is blurry in places, and the sound mix, especially of the vocals, is erratic. Bottom line, if you like the Outlaws, this is one of the few videos available. I'm glad I have it and would buy it again if something happened to my copy.",1453334400,,626,4.181818181818182
8552701,5,B00AJP0YCK,"This DVD has the Outlaws doing what they do best. It has songs off the Playin' to Win album and their classics. It was shot using only one camera , but to have an Outlaws show on video is worth it. It's quality is about 8 on a scale of 1-10. A definite must have for any Outlaws fan.",1436313600,,283,3.8135593220338984
8552702,2,B00AJP0YCK,horrible quality,1425254400,,16,7.5
8552703,3,B00AJP0YCK,Of course this was made from old tape. Digital video didn't exist then. I don't consider the sound or picture of poor quality. It's not perfect but is enjoyable.,1416873600,,161,4.586206896551724
8552704,5,B00AJP0YCK,It's a shame with such poor picture quality,1409529600,,43,4.5
8552705,2,B00AJP0YCK,"First i want to say the Outlaws are one of the best bands of all times. Been a fan since the early Tampa days. What a shame this dvd is. I purchased with anticipation of seeing  the band in their prime so to speak. The DVD is a disappointment  :  terrible sound, picture quality is miserable etc. I do not understand why this  concert wasn't  re edited with the technolgy that is available today. I would have paid more (within reason) to see it. Basicallly a disgrace to the legacy of this great band.",1404086400,,502,4.297872340425532
