7622440,5,B01B80LOA0,"I'm really happy to see the earlier seasons of Pokemon finally being released as box sets! When I first hear about 'Johto Journeys' being released a few months ago, I immediately pre ordered it and was extremely happy when it arrived! Now I definitely can't wait for 'Johto League Champions' to be released! I've waited a long time for the Johto episodes to finally see their own box set collections. Hopefully 'Master Quest' will be released as a complete collection too! :)",1454198400,7,475,4.804878048780488

7622460,5,B01B80LOA0,"Each disc contains 8 episodes and by the first episode, I could already tell that it looked better than Johto Journeys, which had 10 on a disc. It really makes a difference. It looks like earlier versions of this packaging said ""5 discs"" when there are actually 6, but that was removed by the time I bought it (see picture).

This season also marks a bigger change in the presentation of each episode. Each season, it seemed that 4Kids displayed more and more editing power in their dubbing. This time, they moved the opening of each episode to before the theme song so that it's a ""cold opening."" Then they changed the title screen to their own version and moved the final commercial break from the end to inside the episode. It's apparent that this last break is not part of the original Japanese version because it actually cuts out abruptly and in the middle of music. Thankfully, it picks up right where they left off so I don't feel like they are cutting things out. It's rather jarring and I can think that the reason must have come from the network. It also saves them from having to come up with some sort of final song or Pokerap (originally the Pokerap GS was going to be aired during season 4, right before the credits, but it aired only once and was most likely cut because of this change in format).",1476144000,2,1313,4.448132780082988
7622461,5,B01B80LOA0,"Awesome, nostalgic. If your trying to have your childhood all in one small place this is definitely worth it.",1476057600,,109,4.7894736842105265

7622467,5,B01B80LOA0,"This was a very good continuation from Johto Journeys Season 3. It goes all the way up to almost the 6th gym battle. Gary only appeared like one time and Team Rocket shows up almost every episode. Even though Johto Journeys is a long season, I still enjoyed it very much.",1468800000,,271,4.333333333333333

7622472,5,B01B80LOA0,just bought this from walmart heres to wishing that they release the next season this year as well.,1467244800,,99,4.555555555555555
7622473,5,B01B80LOA0,I've been waiting for this dvd to come out for months.,1465948800,,54,4.0
7622474,5,B01B80LOA0,"Yes you read right. All 52 Episodes from Pokmon's fourth season are finally available on DVD for the first time in thirteen years.
And what's more, it seems they're now being brought to us in the highest qualitty we've seen them in on Dvd.
In 2003 we got a seven disc release that crammed 7 episodes each on six single-layer Dvds and the last DvD had 10 and was a duel-layer disc.
The qualitty; as you might expect; was pretty bad for the first six dVDs, and that issue seems to have been resolved here.
The last disc in this set is almost the same one from 2003 with new logos, but that's not a bad thing as the qualitty for this disc was pretty good by comparison, and all episodes on this set have come directly out of whatever archive the episodes were stored in instead of being ported from the old DVDs.
They're all just a little longer, as they now contain the ""Pokmon Johto"" bumpers denoting each episode's final commercial break, and the end credits are no longer separated by a black screen.
The first chapter stopt for each episode also comes in after the title card instead of before it; as per the norm with newer Pokmon dVDs.
The price point is good to, as it's almost impossible to find the older set anymore without paying a small fortune.
As for the important episodes, you get three gym battles in this season, starting out right off the bat with the two-part battle against the Goldenrod gymleader Witney.
Morty from the Ecruteak Gym gets his chance to shine, as does Chuck from Cianwood citty.
Another gymleader also makes an appearance, but Ash won't battle her this season.
In other events; in no particular order;
Duplica returns, and Brok's Volpix storyline gets a rap-up.
Kecleon makes its first appearance, Rhydon gets to surfe and Smoochum gets to kiss people and Pokmon.
Brock gets Heartbroken, and he also gets sick and has a recurring dream about girls; not surprisingly.
Jessie tries to control Pokmon, and some old dood can speak Pikachu; and who knows what other pokmon languages, and three Pokmon get to speak as well.
Pikachu befriends a bunch of Pichu, Oh and goodbye Chikorita.
Articuno makes an appearance, and Snorlax gets into a Sumo Match.
As for packaging;
All six discs are packaged in one normal-sized dVD keep case that has an atracktivve slipcover.
All discs load with the viz logo, then go straight to a static menu with options to play all episodes or jump to your favorite one.
The packaging does say that 52 Pokmon adventures come on 5 dVDs, but that's a vary small price to pay for a complete season.
If you've just started your Pokmon dVD collection; or are just looking for that elusive season 4, this is the way to go.",1465344000,2,2672,4.56875
7622475,5,B01B80LOA0,"Just perfect, I love how the box is similar to the others so it's easy to know I was buying the real deal. I like getting the complete set cuz I don't want to spend a large amount of money getting each season. These box sets really make the process faster and cheaper. I can't wait for master quest to come out and I hope that it will have a similar box with the others.",1465084800,,370,3.9466666666666668
7622476,5,B01B80LOA0,"Alright, finally! This comes with all 52 episodes from the Johto League Champions season (which is season 4). This set is really similar to the previous season, The Johto Journeys The Complete Collection, same size, artwork, etc. After taking off the slip cover, mine says ""52 Pokemon Adventures on 5 DVDs!"" at the top however, there are 6 dvds (see pic). My only complaint would be that I REALLY WISHED Viz Media would put just a little more effort into these complete sets. For example, put background music on the menus on each disc, put what episodes are on each disc by making an insert inside the box set (it can be the size of the advertisement insert), and perhaps add some extras, pokerap, etc (probably will never happen). In summary I really am glad to own this and am glad Viz Media is continuing to release these seasons in complete box sets. Master Quest will be next (no release date as I am typing this (5/31/16)), should be coming out by the end of this year. That season had 64 episodes that aired in America so hopefully they will all be on the release! Below I will list the episodes that are on each disc:
