2650330,5,B000I0RNSY,"This is an excellent workout.  It gets the heart rate up and works the muscles well.  Lots of lower body work with arm movements designed to make you work on your balance at the same time. A real calorie burner, yeah baby!

I have the all three of this set, which I rotate with others that I have as well!
This is a more advanced workout so beginners take it slow.",1227484800,3,364,4.098591549295775
2650331,5,B000I0RNSY,"I have tried various other fitness DVD collectons are realized that I hate being told to ""get funky"". I don't need to awaken my inner goddess or learn moves that I can ""take to the dance floor"". I just want a good workout. That's why I love Gilad. He is encouraging and funny without being annoying. The workouts are challenging, but there isn't complicated choreography. This is perfect for anyone who just wants to get in shape quickly.",1206057600,32,438,4.628205128205129
2650332,5,B000I0RNSY,"Why becomes obsessed with exercising a few body muscles (calves and heart)as is the case with most aerobic programs, when you can exercise all moving parts. I can not speak more supportively of his video.",1192579200,,204,4.857142857142857
2650333,5,B000I0RNSY,"Well, let me start by saying this: It was back in September, 2006 that i suddenly realized ""Man i've let myself go.."" (An 8 yr. old daughter & 2 yr. old son later) i was at 213 lbs. my heaviest (scary i tell you!)

It was shortly after that i discovered Gilad and his workouts on fit tv, he is motivating & fun, but i am sometimes sore from his workouts. I DO feel very invigorated after doing them, no matter how sore i am!

Well, long story short.. i've been doing the workouts & have gone from a size 18 to a 14 AND i am continuing to do them to get much lower than what i'm at now (180 lbs. currently..)

IF you stick to doing the workouts you WILL see results, though i must say.. for me it's a long road. (BUT a road that i look forward to going down & STAYING down!) So, if you really want to get to your goal weight try them & have FUN !!",1175558400,26,846,3.8505747126436782

2650336,5,B000I0RNSY,"Gilad gives a great workout as he always does- this one is deceptively hard, the first time I did it using hand weights because it seemed too easy, and my butt and quads were sore the next day. He uses no weights or equipment, beginners need to be careful with their form because if knees are in wrong position they can get torqued. Gilad is a little less chatty than he is in his Fit TV series, and the exercises are a little different, but still fun.",1165708800,30,452,4.206896551724138

2650368,4,B000I0RNSY,"Requires no equipment, good workout. It is not cardio, it's body sculpting, so no big calorie burn.  It's not super challenging, so a beginner could complete most of it.",1421020800,,169,4.827586206896552
2650369,5,B000I0RNSY,"Amazing lower body workout!  I seriously noticed a difference in my buttocks and legs after doing the routine a couple times.  It is very challenging.  The moves are not awkward and feel ""right"" in that I am not positioning my body in ways that do not feel unnatural or strain my muscles in any way.  Gilad is the only workout I have found that does not cause me lower back and knee pain when I am finished!  The abs and upper body are very, very minimal so I do other workouts for that area.  My legs are so shapely and curvy now that I love wearing my jeans a little tighter!!!",1419206400,4,579,4.171171171171171

2650372,5,B000I0RNSY,"This video is excellent cardio and strength workout.  The video runs just over an hour total, which is much better than some which only run 30 to 40 minutes, which is not enough.  You do not need weights for these exercises because Gilad uses isometric conditioning in this video.

Would definitely recommend it.",1396569600,2,312,4.849056603773585

2650390,5,B000I0RNSY,"I love Gilad, he has been a favorite of mine since 1994. I have been actively searching for my favorite work out Video for years, hope this is it. Gilad if you are ready this , please help. The product was available in 1994 , I believe it was Bodies in Motion and the cover you were wearing a Red Shirt. I hope this is it.. This was a Great Work Out Video for me. I lost 19 lbs in 45 days using the workout  twice a week.",1360972800,,421,3.784090909090909
2650391,5,B000I0RNSY,"Gilad usually has good workouts for starting out, We're in bad shape and when we can get to where we can actually do these strong then we'll be able to start p90x or insanity without killing ourselves. Of course we got core and more and cuts and curves to alternate between.  We're sore but feeling good.  Love Hawaii in the background just takes you away.",1360627200,,356,4.461538461538462

2650394,4,B000I0RNSY,"Good cardio, excellent workout for your lower body, all areas of your thighs and butt. Not nearly enough core work, but i don't think it is designed for that. I just do core stuff afterwards. Good for weight loss and strengthing your lower body, maintaining your core.",1322179200,2,268,4.723404255319149
2650395,5,B000I0RNSY,I love this series best of all Gilad. I own all three DVD and workout with them everyday one by one and i see great results.,1314316800,,124,3.8076923076923075
2650396,5,B000I0RNSY,"I bought this dvd about a month ago, and I love it!  I feel like I get a complete workout, but I will say you have to be used to Gilad's style of workouts.  I personally think his workouts are awesome, but if you have never seen him before or don't know anything about him, you may want to watch his show on tv first.  Of all the other body sculpt workouts (in that series), I think the Power and Grace is the best because it combines cardio, with sculpting and a little bit of yoga thrown in too.  If you do this one and maybe alternate it with one of his shoulders/arms and chest/back exercises, you will have a truly complete workout!  I would totally recommend this workout to anyone, but it's not for beginners and you should check out his 'style' before you buy it.  Gilad is my hero and a true inspiration!",1312416000,3,813,4.212903225806452
2650407,5,B000I0RNSY,"Besides the old collections which doesn't use weights I luv:the total body sculpt',the total body sculpt plus and the ultimate body sculpt series. Gilad will transform ur body.",1295395200,,176,5.321428571428571
2650408,5,B000I0RNSY,Gilad's videos are fun and his videos are very good. I enjoy them a lot and do his exercises often.,1294531200,,99,4.0
2650409,5,B000I0RNSY,"This video is as promised. It is strictly a toning video to create cuts and curves. No abs, but that was strategic so you'd buy the Core & More video (which I think is well worth the buy). My triceps didn't like that band too much! OOH That was tough! Gilad likes to lunge a lot too so be prepared for that. I like Gilad's style -- it's definitely suitable for a man or a woman. There is no dancing involved! It has been offically added to the weekly routine.",1284163200,,459,4.111111111111111
2650410,5,B000I0RNSY,"This DVD is an enjoyable lower body and core workout. It is not just the same old boring lunges and squats - he does different exercises to keep you interested and it is effective. Although I would rate this as an intermediate workout, it is low impact so it can be utilized by those people like myself who have problems with impact due to foot surgery; however at the same time it is an intense workout.

Workouts: The main workout is more than 30 minutes of lower body and some core work without weights. Most people (including me) would think a resistance training routine without weights would not be effective, but this DVD will prove this theory wrong. Gilad's warm ups are always long - 10 minutes in this case, but don't miss this warm up because he does some good toning work.

Setting: The DVD is set on a beautiful beach in Hawaii.

Music: Typical of Gilad's shows, the music is not exciting but not distracting or annoying.

Crew: There are 4 people(2 men and 2 women) working out with Gilad who are always demonstrating perfect form.

Equipment Needed: None! This would be a great workout to take with you when you travel since it doesn't require any equipment at all. You can always use weights or bands to mix this up.

Instructor: I enjoy working out with Gilad on Fit TV and this DVD is no exception. His cueing and explanation of proper form is excellent as always.",1264118400,15,1383,4.512

2650412,5,B000I0RNSY,"I really enjoy Gilad's work-outs! The work-outs on this video are all bewtween 20-25 minutes. On days when I'm pressed for time, I can still squeeze in one of these work-outs rather than skipping exercise entirely & feeling guilty all day. On the days when my schedule is less hectic, I'll do one of Gilad's work-outs then go on to do some strength training with free weights. I would not consider this to be advanced in any way. A beginning exerciser could easily do it. If you've been exercising already like me, then you can just do the moves with more intensity. Some other cardio tapes I've tried were too hard to follow...I want to work my body not my brain when I'm working out. If I have to try too hard to follow them & I'm stumbling through mis-step after mis-step, at the end I don't feel like I got a good work-out. But I don't have that trouble with Gilad. Gilad's cues are good so he's easy to follow & you're always ready for the next move...the first time you do one of his videos, you'll be following along no problem. He's got lots of tapes...get moving & try one!",1252713600,,1082,4.361386138613861
2650413,4,B000I0RNSY,"I learned of the new workouts by Gilad and decided to give them a try.  This video is definitely good but not much is new so I am not really crazy about it.  If you are a beginner this workout is OK.  However, I feel that people who have been exercising for a while would need something more challenging and out of the ordinary.  I still admire Gilad and although this is probably not my favorite video, I would recommend it to beginners.",1236556800,2,438,4.240963855421687
2650414,5,B000I0RNSY,"Celebrity trainers and fitness fads come and go.  There's good reason the Gilad has been around for decades.  He is a good trainer, knows how to work you effectively to get results and comes across as someone you want to workout with.

2650416,5,B000I0RNSY,"Even with no weights, I am feeling it!  This was a pretty intense workout.  Gilad is a pretty good trainer, and I do use his videos and show quite often.  He's always a challenge and does some interesting variations on movements.  The only downfall of Gilad is that he walks around too much -- just WORK OUT!!",1232755200,,309,4.368421052631579

8142915,4,B000I0RNSY,"I enjoyed Power and Grace because it incorporates aerobics, isometrics, plyometrics and yoga into a low-impact 54-minute workout filmed on the beautiful sea shore of Kaena Point in Hawai'i. There is a warmup, workout and cooldown, each selectable from the DVD menu or by skipping chapters. The video combines standing moves and lying exercises with stretching of the major and medial muscle groups. No weights or heavy equipment are required to get the most out of this workout! All you need is $10 sticky mat for when you do moves on the floor. The standing moves are intricate combinations of girations, and yogic poses. Make no mistake, you CAN do these moves; You will get better and better with time and effort. If you are tall, make sure you can reach over your head in a 5' diameter area in your workout room because there are some moves that have you reach upward. Surprisingly to me at first, although lying on the floor is relaxing, the horizontal moves Gilad does are attentive, challenging and comforting, leading to an overall tangible feeling of well-being and enlightenment. I especially like warrior pose. If this description sounds interesting to you, then I recommend you give it a try!

There are 2 other Ultimate Body Sculpt Series videos, Core and More and Cuts and Curves. They are just as good. Core and More combines 63 min of functional moves with Pilates principles using a sticky mat. If you would like to use this workout, then you can buy the mat separately for ~$10. Cuts and Curves does 60 min of progressive resistance using two ~3lb weights, ~10lb weights, and a resistance band. If you want to use the video, then you can buy them separately.",1429228800,9,1676,4.759450171821306
