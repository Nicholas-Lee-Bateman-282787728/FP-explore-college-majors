5688969,1,B00C2R120Q,Terrible movie - delivery from seller was great,1421280000,,47,5.0
5688970,5,B00C2R120Q,I found this film by accident and it was extremely enjoyable.  Good acting and writing.  Enjoyed everything about it.,1418774400,,117,5.105263157894737
5688971,5,B00C2R120Q,This is one of my favorite movies. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Christian movies.,1399248000,2,123,4.636363636363637
5688972,5,B00C2R120Q,"This movie is about real people and real life---it has humor, great acting, and a wonderful story.  You know it's a great movie when you can remember it a week, a month, or years later, and this is one of those movies I will always remember.  Martin Papazian is a fabulous actor and he is so believable in this role---the movie sucks you in immediately.  You want to know what's going to happen to this character.  Endearing and cleverly understated, I will recommend this movie to everyone I know.  Thank you for this gem of a movie Martin Papazian!",1398988800,2,550,4.515151515151516
5688973,5,B00C2R120Q,"I would rate this ten stars if it were not for the over use of profanity. It is a great film about how love for another can redeem us. And why the young actor wasn't nominated for every award availible, I don't understand. He was outstanding.",1397520000,2,242,4.282608695652174
5688974,1,B00C2R120Q,"I would have thought this film might be worth something. Then I read IMDB's SYNOPSIS. It claimed the ""award winning director"" that created the film...blah...blah. So, I looked at his work history. The award winner was loading film into cameras in 2002. He has directed only one single film. Yes, this one. I looked at the box office. Gross brought in...in the 1,000s. No, I didn't forget any zeroes. It was likely made with a Sony hand-held digital video camera. The actors and actresses couldn't pull this film out of the mud if they all had stars on Hollywood Blvd (which they don't). I said, clearly, I did not want to watch this. But to avoid arguments, I at least played it. Now, I have bad dreams, upset stomach, headaches, and wish my life would end before I see anything else so lame and pathetic. So, don't watch it. and count your blessings. I, instead, recommend ""The Encounter."" A film, while not well known, at least has a good moral story.",1396224000,,953,4.578947368421052
5688975,5,B00C2R120Q,Great movie and great acting!!! It's really neat to see A.J. Cook go from a serious role on Criminal Minds to a drug addict...,1385337600,2,126,4.291666666666667
5688976,5,B00C2R120Q,I don't know what people are talking but I ppersonally love this film. I would recommend it to anymore that is into such story where two injured souls helped each other out,1384214400,3,172,4.40625
5688977,5,B00C2R120Q,"This film will make you laugh, cry and come out feeling amazing.

Such an amazing true story that alot of people will be able to relate too!

AJ Cook and Tristian do such an amazing job, as well as the rest of the cast.",1376006400,3,219,3.9545454545454546
5688978,5,B00C2R120Q,I enjoyed this movie a great deal.  The story line is difficult because so many veterans suffered emotional and physical issues when they returned that returning to their previous lives was almost impossible.  The main characters were excellent and I was happy with the ending.,1374537600,2,277,5.133333333333334
8576648,5,B00C2R120Q,A meaningful bond between 2 strangers dealing with tragedy . Worth watching.,1525564800,,76,5.416666666666667
8576649,5,B00C2R120Q,I loved this.,1516147200,,13,3.6666666666666665
8576650,5,B00C2R120Q,"This movie isn't getting the attention it deserves.  Fantastic cast, great story.  I came to it by way of Losing in Love, another Martin Papazian movie, also wonderful.

Afterthought:  One of the best characters was the social worker.  In a movie about serious issues -- PTSD, drug-addicted parents, abandoned children -- the lady from social services was hardworking, conscientious and absolutely hilarious.",1515888000,,408,5.516129032258065
8576651,5,B00C2R120Q,"I watched this movie because A.J. Cook was one of the cast members. As the events unfolded, I realized she would not be in the majority of it. I became emotional and sympathetic for Anthony, Wade, and Cheryl because of their traumatic experiences. I can not believe how amazing and realistic this movie is for me to not have seen it sooner. An excellent movie is one that makes the audience feel for the characters; this is one of those movies.",1499904000,,444,4.493827160493828
8576652,5,B00C2R120Q,Just loved this movie. So hearwarming.,1478390400,,38,5.5
8576653,5,B00C2R120Q,"Professional reviewers ridiculed this film. It is an excellent piece that is raw and realistic and accurate reflects how people in small towns deal with the variety of problems people face. The depiction of the serviceman returning from war and suffering with multiple PTSD issues is on the mark. Without being preachy at all, the film shows that often the way out of your own problems is to help others with their issues. If you see a negative review of this film, it is a good sign that the author of that review is not credible.",1453161600,,531,4.541666666666667
8576654,5,B00C2R120Q,Great story and realism. Inspiring!,1436745600,,35,6.2
8576655,5,B00C2R120Q,I was prepared not to like this movie but I ended really seeing how post traumatic stress can be for some our brave men and women returning from the front lines. Anyone saying that they don't believe in ptss is really putting blinders on. I was very impressed by Martin Papazian did in his directing debut. Charles Dutton was very good in his part as a compassionate police chief also.,1435708800,,385,4.514285714285714
8576656,5,B00C2R120Q,What can I say besides I just love this movie.  Try it!!  You will not be disappointed.,1432684800,,87,4.0588235294117645
8576657,5,B00C2R120Q,"Don't be fooled by the cover: this isn't a war movie. This is a movie about a man who comes home from war and doesn't know how to deal. His marriage has crumbled, he drinks and causes public scenes, yet still he has friends in police officers and even his ex-wife who haven't given up on him. When he steps in one night to help his neighbor, a single mom with poor taste in men, he is pushed into getting to know and help her son. As tragic events unfold, the unlikely bond between a boy without a father and a man without much of anything leads them through heartbreak towards deeper trust and maybe, redemption.",1429228800,,613,4.293103448275862
