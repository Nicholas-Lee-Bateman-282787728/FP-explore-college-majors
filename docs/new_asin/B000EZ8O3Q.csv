2547061,4,B000EZ8O3Q,"This wood fire is nicely framed, has very good coals and real fire sounds.  The visible fireplace wall might be a boulder.

The DVD starts with a short movie leader and goes right into the fire, with standard (4:3) video.  There are no options (no music), and the video loops continuously.  For widescreen (16:9), use the DVD player menu to stretch it.  Generally, I don't like stretching, but it does not seem to make much difference on a fireplace DVD.

The fire consists of about a dozen split logs stacked in a fireplace, with some in front - no grate or andirons.  It is already burning at the start, and no logs fall during the 30-minute loop.  The loop may actually be on the disc more than once, since the first transition that I watched was very smooth, while another was a little rougher.  [You need to watch closely, if you want to see the transition:  it's most obvious in the lower left corner, which does not burn for 18+ minutes, flames for 7 minutes, and then is mostly black.]  The fact that the logs move only slightly might tend to make this fire a little boring after a while.  I wonder if they are wired in position?  The consistency of the flames also makes me wonder if some gas or computer animation is used.  Still, I find it quite pleasing.  My wife finds the flames relatively subdued for such a large pile of wood.

2547062,3,B000EZ8O3Q,"It's just okay. The problem is you never really see a full raging fire. It begins with a slow to medium flame then NEVER changes at all (kinda boring that way). I also bought ""The Fireplace DVD"" by Plasmacandy. IT's way, WAY better! You see inside the fireplace at different stages of the fire and it's quite believeable. I could watch this one for hours and it's soooo relaxing! I'm buying more for great gifts this winter. This will help those ""firepit"" junkies wait out the storms.",1251504000,6,484,4.574712643678161
2547063,5,B000EZ8O3Q,"The other reviews on the DVD is what convinced me to buy it - they were right! This is a wonderful fireplace DVD.  Growing up in Northern Minnesota a fire was common, now living in Chicago this DVD brings me a piece of home.  I would caution that there is one loud snap/pop that made me jump.  After the first time I noticed it much less.",1232928000,6,338,4.090909090909091
2547064,5,B000EZ8O3Q,"I bought four different versions as I downsized from a house with a real fireplace and miss it in my apt.  Of all these, this is the best visually - just see the fire, has a very clear picture with good color hues, and it fills the screen and plays indefinitely.  As another said, no bells and whistles.  No outline of the hearth - just shows the interior of the fire so your tv becomes the hearth frame.  No electronic music or distractions.",1227139200,19,442,4.289156626506024
2547065,5,B000EZ8O3Q,"This will be great this Christmas. I don't have a fireplace but this will look great on my 50"" TV this winter. Great DVD. Worth every penny.",1192665600,9,140,4.222222222222222
2547066,4,B000EZ8O3Q,"This is a great virtual fireplace for those interested in one without the bells and whistles. After a short fanfare with production logo, it goes straight to a pleasant wood fire, with crackles, that auto-loops until stopped. I rate this, 'just right'.",1166227200,18,252,5.023809523809524

8115921,5,B000EZ8O3Q,"Best fireplace DVD out there as it is the most realistic....it always makes a great gift! Perfect for cold weather and rainy nights while reading a book, having company or even setting a staging for a home/apartment sale. It works for me!",1412380800,,238,4.690476190476191
8115922,4,B000EZ8O3Q,"I purchased the DVD because I can't have a real fireplace where I live. I read a LOT of reviews before I bought this one. I am VERY pleased with the DVD, it is realistic, the only thing that I think would make it better if they had pulled back just a little bit,I think it is just a little to close, I would DEFINITELY buy it again though.",1325635200,2,339,3.927536231884058
8115923,4,B000EZ8O3Q,"No gimmicks, just the beauty of hardwood logs slowly burning over a 1.5 hour period. Although the logs do not move much during the period you can observe the slowly changing patterns of the flames as they dance over glowing logs. The roar and crackle of the fire just add realism to the fireplace scene. Except for a brief 30 second introduction, the crackling fireplace movie loops continuously for an un-interrupted show. There is no optional music, animations, fireplace screens or other distractions, just the relaxing beauty of a real wood crackling fireplace. The picture quality was recorded at standard definition (320p/420p/NTSC), not high definition (1080p/720p/HD). It looks fine on smaller TV screens (under 32"") and computer monitors, but is just OK on a wide screen 50"" HDTV. I rate the content 5 stars but only gave the DVD a 4 star overall rating because it is not HD.",1316563200,3,884,4.939597315436242
8115924,3,B000EZ8O3Q,OK fireplace video...found one in Walgreen's for $2 the same day I happened to order this one and find it to be better quality...who figured?,1294790400,2,141,4.68
8115925,5,B000EZ8O3Q,"I have been looking at fireplace DVDs and reading reviews on them for a long time and I finally purchased this one as a Christmas present. I could not be more pleased with it. The sounds are wonderful and there's no extras-no music, no other sounds. Perfect. Exactly what I was looking for. It is very soothing and makes the room feel cozy. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is looking for a no bells and whistles fireplace DVD.",1293753600,4,435,4.382716049382716
8115926,5,B000EZ8O3Q,"I didn't just get the first fireplace DVD on the list - I carefully looked through reviews and descriptions until I found this one.  And it payed off!  It is a simple, no frills approach with a very warm and natural crackling fire on a perpetual loop.  The second best thing to actually having a fire!  So cozy and perfect for winter and fall months.  Highly recommended!!",1290211200,2,372,4.492537313432836
