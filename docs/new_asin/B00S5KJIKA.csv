6959321,4,B00S5KJIKA,"In theaters right now, I feel like I'm getting a lot of the same old junk. Liam Neeson movies and Michael Bay shoot-em-ups are getting really boring. As a movie lover, I'd been searching for an action movie that was both sexy, thrilling, and unique.... and I ended up finding two on one disc! From Asia With Lust volume 1 has two rape-revenge feature films. I'd actually never been big on the genre, since recent films are more my style, and the most notable of the genre are from the 70s, but this overseas update of a classic scenario gave me a whole new appreciation for the genre! This is the first film from the Troma company I've seen besides ""The Toxic Avenger"" and now I'm excited to see more!",1427068800,10,701,4.4

8697381,1,B00S5KJIKA,"Sorry, folks. As much as I love Asian films, even the Japanese pink films, this 2 volume set released by Troma is about as low-brow as we can get. These are basically the same film made four times. Rape / revenge / rape / revenge. I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE sort of stuff (or snuff). I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE was remade how many times? Well, this team evidently wanted to reach down to that record, but they wanted to use the same actress. Miyuki Yokoyama is quite lovely, but she must have had rape / revenge nightmares after this series. I hope she went on to star in movies involving love instead of violence. No love in these movies -- just hate and sadism.

One  wonders if someone is making a statement about Japanese men and that society, as the LUST OF THE DEAD  films supposedly are. We all  have our guilty pleasures, I guess, and I am not immune to these. However, it has been a long while since I wanted to dump DVDs in the trash after watching, preferably in a dumpster in another neighborhood.",1473379200,,997,4.287234042553192

8697386,3,B00S5KJIKA,"""From Asia With Lust - Volume 1"" provides 2 Japanese exploitation fliks for the price of one - a factor which slightly sweetens the deal as these type of films are, generally, relatively short in length (approx 70 min each).  As 'stand-alone' features these two movies might also seem somewhat disappointing, but as a two-pack their individual deficiencies become somewhat less annoying, for the price.

Both films have been released by Troma, but are NOT Troma productions. It would appear that Troma signed a deal to secure some low end Japanese weirdness to cash in on the surge of interest in Asian exploitation product and have released, to date, 2 separate 2-4-1 packages under the ""From Asia With Lust"" banner.

Having checked out the premiere offering (as a 'fan' of the genre) I'd remark that these were pretty lackluster forays into the venerable realm of the traditional Pinky Violence style of Japanese cinema.  Both of the films in ""From Asia With Lust - Volume 1"" (AND Volume 2 as well!!) feature Jap AV 'star' Miyuki Yokoyama in the lead female role(s). Mz Yokoyama is attractive enough, and doesn't mind shedding her clothes when required, BUT her ability to deliver a performance with any passion is sadly lacking... a factor that contributes to the somewhat low-key vibe of both of these, supposedly strongly transgressive, films.

The first feature: ""CAMP"" contains more sexually perverse action. Two quibbling sisters become stranded when they have a car accident and they take shelter at an abandoned 'summer camp'. Ironically, their time at the titular 'camp' is short as they are  discovered by a 'neighbor' guy who invites them to spend the night over at his place. The 'sisters' relief at this 'hospitality' is soon ended, however, when four more men show up at the cabin and things get weird. It turns out all the men are 'sexual degenerates' that were released from a near-by 'bankrupted' mental institution and they have continued to live together, trying to control their perverse libidos.  The presence of the two cute and  vulnerable women make them immediately revert to their wicked ways and each member of the group enacts their particular fetishistic fantasy upon the captives.  Torturous indignities are heaped upon the two girls- including: pee fetish, abuse w/ a BBQ lighter!, rape, and ultimately even necrophilia - after the younger sister is grimly killed by being put into a plastic garment bag from which all the air is sucked out by a vacuum cleaner! Pretty 'nasty' stuff.  The older sister (Miyuki!) escapes and fortuitously/improbably! hooks up with another woman who is also trying to hunt the perverts down (with a bow & arrow) and the whole affair moves into a classic feminine vendetta scenario as the women wreak their vengeance.  No 'surprises' here and, consequently, not a lot of excitement generated via the 'by-the-numbers' action.

The second feature ""Hitch-hike"" focuses on a road-trip by a husband and wife who share a pretty abusive relationship.
With Miyuki again in 'the driver's seat' they pick up a hitch-hiking man who turns out to be a dangerous bank-robber criminal on the run.  What follows is, again, plot-line territory that has been well mined over the years - as the psycho in the backseat proceeds to reveal his true identity and terrorize the couple for the duration.  Lots of fights and shootings, and a rape (while the 'husband' is forced to watch) provide the thrills in this one - right up to the predictable ending.

Both of these films provide over-the-top exploitation situations that are, unfortunately, dulled by clunky scripts, character development, and acting. Situations that could be considered as extremely shocking end up feeling sorta mundane due to the formulaic nature of everything.  There is a fair bit of female nakedness displayed in the film ""CAMP"" and a lot of sexual brutality! ""Hitch-hike"" relies more on guns and shocking murders to provide thrills and Miyuki is only briefly nude during her rape scene.

Ultimately, I found these 2 films to be an 'OK' watch - but not great.  Makes one appreciate the quality and craftsmanship that went into many of the 'older' Pinky Violence productions.  Technically - the DVD image quality is excellent (widescreen) - Japanese language w/ English sub-titles - no 'extras' of note.",1434585600,5,4320,5.033660589060308
8697387,1,B00S5KJIKA,"This review is from: From Asia With Lust Volume 1: Camp/Hitchhike (DVD)
Miyuki Yokoyama stars in both films apparently because she knows how to drive a vehicle and look unconvincing when getting raped. In ""Camp"" perhaps the better, if not more disgusting the two films, she gets stranded with her sister at a camp where they run into a group of almost reformed perverts. In the second feature her and and her husband pick up a hitch hiker, followed by abuse and he gets to watch while tied up.

Are there places in Japan where you can't get a cell signal?

Filmed with much of the same cast and location. Just didn't create the bad excitement of a David Hess film.
