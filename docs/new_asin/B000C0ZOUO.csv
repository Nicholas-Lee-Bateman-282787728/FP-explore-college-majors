8157766,5,B000C0ZOUO,I loved this series as a kid. I recorded it on vhs many many years ago but had been dying to own it on dvd. I had to get a region free dvd player so i could watch it in the U.S. thankfully Amazon suggested on with purchase of this dvd for like 30 bucks. I absolutely love it!!!,1474070400,,277,3.711864406779661
8157767,5,B000C0ZOUO,"very good, but remember that you most likely need to have a dvd player that will play dvds in all regions. that is the only downfall i have found. i can't wait to buy a dvd player that can play dvds of any region and finish watching the ""Tomorrow People"" series.",1421712000,2,262,4.1568627450980395
