3833195,5,B0021L8UMQ,"Today I had the privilege to view ""Little Ashes"" which Robert Pattinson starred in prior to becoming famous for his performance as ""Edward"" in the ""Twilight"" Saga.  I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to the great American Amazon site and to the British one as well who delivered the released DVD into my hands for this purpose.

To this date, I have not publicly reviewed any of Mr. Pattinson's movies, mainly because there were so many reviews already present, but today I felt compelled to share some of my thoughts because of his awesome performance in ""Little Ashes"".

Mr. Pattinson-Salvador Dali still remains as an image in my head; vestiges of emotions also linger. I know for certain that this movie will stay with me forever.

Before I watched ""Little Ashes"", I was already convinced of Mr. Pattinson's talent because of what he demonstrated in his three earlier artistic movies; The Haunted Airmen, The Bad Mother's Handbook"" & the musician Art in How To Be. I should note that I will not make mention of ""Harry Potter"" or ""Twilight"" in this review mainly because of my personal preference for artistic, independent and expressive films. All three artistic movies that I mentioned above can be categorized in this genre of movie-making.

These three films were made before ""Twilight"" but after ""Harry Potter"".  Mr. Pattinson carefully picked these roles, and challenged himself by extending his talent beyond a cookie-cutter role that a young handsome man could easily have accepted. He acted convincingly and should be extremely proud of this. These different roles allowed him to shine and confirmed that he is on the right path in his career. He has already been rewarded with worldwide fame and glory because of his starring role in ""Twilight"". I am convinced of his talent and am glad that he is receiving all of this recognition. He deserves it!

As a Dali fan as well, I was really looking forward to viewing another creative movie about him. Other films have been made on this subject but if weren't for Rob Pattinson's rising star status because of ""Twilight"", this movie would never have seen the light of day on DVD format. Mr. Pattinson played the role of the world famous artist/surrealist painter, Salvador Dali, or as others know him, ""Salvador Domingo Felipe Jacinto Dali I Domnech"", convincingly and memorably. The haunting story of forbidden love, the love between two men. The audience is left with the eminent question of whether one can deny their one-and-only true love?

During the film I was skillfully carried away on a roller coaster ride of intensity and emotions; laughing, enjoying the Spanish music, the idyllic surroundings and Lorca's poetry reading. The subtitles were crucial because of the strong Spanish accent in his use of the English language. It was easy to feel a part of their lives with how intimate the scenes were. I felt as if I was sitting beside them, reaching into their vulnerability.

Mr. Pattinson pushed his limits playing the iconic & genius Dali; hysterical but incredibly shy, wrapped up with his bizarre and frequent out-pouring of complex behaviours; pushing the contradictions and eccentricities of behaviour in a matter of hours, and always living a life with no limits!

I applaud Robert Pattinson for stepping so adeptly into this iconic and complex individual; a multifaceted exhibitionist and genius on one side, and an awkward and annoying Salvador Dali on the other.  This bi-polar complexity took an immense amount of skill, not to mention courage, on the part of Mr. Pattinson. He did this with precision resulting in an extraordinary performance.

Mr. Pattinson's own career is bi-polar much like Dali, namely Pattinson's involvement with big budget Hollywood films, which in my opinion are made for a large consumer marketplace, as well as his emotional & intelligent passion for making ""art"" on the big screen.

I know this is just the beginning for Mr. Pattinson in terms of his career.  The stage is set to accept and reward his efforts in the art genre... the doors are wide open and waiting for him.

My dream is to one day to see Johnny Depp, Jack Nicholson and Robert Pattinson acting together in a movie directed by Tim Burton.

I would like to thank Mr. Pattinson and wish him a well-deserved rest from the ""Twilight"" worldwide hype. I hope he knows that after this break at his home in England, the doors of the art movie industry and the big screen will be here waiting for something different...again...something different.....from this extraordinary Robert Pattinson.",1247961600,17,4569,4.968545216251639
3833196,3,B0021L8UMQ,"This was a good art house movie, but let me explain my two frustrations.  First and most importantly, THERE IS NO MALE NUDITY HERE!!!  There is much of the female kind.  Pattinson teases the viewers, but doesn't show the goods.  I guess this movie didn't want to be ""ghettoized,"" but in terms of naughty bits, this was the straightest rainbow flag movie I've ever seen.  Second, as beautiful as this period piece was, at one point, two actors are on a balcony and it is so obvious that their view of Madrid was computer-produced.  It reminded me of James Bond in cars where clearly a screen is just showing action behind him.
Many reviewers have said, ""How will Pattinson's female tween fans feel seeing this?!""  First off, it's too arthouse for them and I think they'd get bored and turn it off.  Plus, many in Mall America won't have access to this arthouse film.  I am glad the work was for more direct than ""Interview with a Vampire,"" but hopefully the tame kissing won't shock that many.
This is a fascinating tale about bizarre triangles.  It is an interesting twist on homophobes who have bonds with rainbow flag men.  The work tries to bring in a female audience with the role of Margarita and her ""Object of My Affection"" vibe.  It may be hard for some to differentiate characters when the three main men are thin, white, black-haired, and the same age.
Boy, have the times changed!  It's hard to think of men that we'd say ""dress preppy"" as being radical.  There seemed to be some sex-segregation in the schooling.  In many schools, Dali would face persecution now the way he first appears on screen.
If you love artsy circles, then you'll love this work.  Those who are interested in the Bloomsbury Group, the Beats, etc. will love this artistic exploration.  If you loved ""Frida"" or ""Head in the Clouds,"" then you should love this.  And to be honest, Pattinson does an amazing job as Dali.
This work was rewarding and disappointing.  I like how it has my mental wheels spinning, but it's no ""Color Purple"" in terms of awesomeness.",1242432000,14,2042,4.622222222222222

I have no idea how true this story is, so I will pretend that it is fiction, based on real people. In the most believable role I've ever seen him in, Robert Pattinson portrays Salvador Dal, brilliant painter and filmmaker; I'd never heard of this actor prior, but Javier Beltrn plays writer Frederico Garca Lorca and is absolutely brilliant. The story starts where they are in art school together and have a form of love affair, without an sexuality. You feel their tension and attraction, but it is so frowned upon that Dal can't bring himself to embrace it. Fast-forward to adulthood, Dal is married to a woman and Garca Lorca is in a relationship with another man. Their tension persists to their later years and, through twists and turns, they can't seem to find each other, even though there is obvious love and a connection between them. Pattinson, whom I find to be one of the worst actors of our day, was fantastic and Beltrn was superb. It's definitely a movie for the art fan, the love fan, and the fan of the unrequited experience. Fantastic film and underrated like crazy!",1487030400,3,1206,4.688679245283019

3833381,4,B0021L8UMQ,"I did not know this film existed until one day I came across it at my local library.  I simply cound not resist to see the movie that was showing lives of three great Spanish artists: Lorca, Bunuel and Dali.  It turns out that all three of them attended the same art school in Madrid.  As young men, their shared their passion for art but also for political changes that were taking place in Spain.  Set in 1922, film describes how difficult it was to be intellectual and have liberal ideas in Spain during that period.

I was not aware that Lorca and Dali had close and intimate relationship during that time.  It is not surprising that all young men and women at the Academy were drawn to Lorca.  He was well mannered, deeply sensitive, impeccably dressed and kind.  No one could resist such qualities and although he was a loyal friend to all of them, each one of his friends wanted him only to himself - perhaps because he left a deep and lasting impact on all of them with him humanity, humility, romantic ideas and idealism.  Lorca falls deeply in love with Dali and his feelings towards Salvador are pure and genuine.  There is such tenderness in his love that magnifies by the fact that Dali was awkward, eccentric person and that it was Lorca who introduced Dali to the artistic elite of the time.

However, Dali's feelings towards Lorca were not reciprocated and their affair was never consummated although Lorca was willing to keep it that was for as long as they could remain toghether and create great works of art - one with poems and the other with paintings, Dali decides to leave Spain, move to Paris, France and his anarchistic approach to life changes dramatically.  He marries Gala, who was someone else's wife when he met her; gala becomes his muse and dali turns his life to materialistic acquisitions.  For him everything is money and he exploits all of his relaitonships in that manner.

As eight years go by and Lorca emerges from depression, he never gets over the heartbreak Dali imposed on his soul.  Lorca dedicates his life and energy to political causes and his art.  He defies idea of being anyone's puppet, emotionally or otherwise.  So when Dali extends invitation to Lorca that two of them meet - one has to wonder about the reason.  Is Dali regretting his decisions and is trying to renew their relationship.  Or is this latest move just another attempt to use Lorca's talent as means of getting inspiration for the new kind of work?  After all, surrealists have expelled Dali from their circle fo rthe simple reason that he has fascist symphatizer.

I was amazed to find out that I was not the only one who cried after watching this movie.  Some of the reviewers admitted the same.  This is truly an art film, deeply emotional and impressionable.  I knew a lot about each one of the artists and for me personally the most tragic events of all was that Lorca was killed during the Spanish Civil war for the fact that he was homosexual and for his leftist ideas.  His poems are still being thought at schools and Universities and what would his contribution to the world be if he was not killed so young?  On the other side,  it is not surprising that Dali tried to keep his relationship with Lorca a secret.  At the time it was a taboo to admit one is homosexual.  But perhaps Dali's regret about his treatment of Lorca led him to his increasingly erratic behavior as he got older.  Grief and guilt are difficult to overcome, particularly since Dali was very much aware of the sincerity of Lorca's feelings. It must not have been easy for Dali to live his long life carrying that burden on his soul.",1414713600,,3635,4.556240369799692

3833385,5,B0021L8UMQ,I thoroughly enjoyed this story of an untold love affair involving Salvador Dali and Federico Garcia Lorca. Well told story and beautifully filmed. Robert Pattinson plays a very believable role in bringing Salvador Dali to life in this film.,1410134400,,241,5.205128205128205

3833387,4,B0021L8UMQ,"This movie is very beautiful to look at.  The cinematography was really something special.  The locations were beautiful.  It's set in Spain and was filmed on location in many beautiful parts of the country.  It's the story of three kind of liberal, sort of revolutionary college men.  I think it would be easier to understand if you are familiar with the Spanish revolution that took place in the 1930's.  This picks up in about 1921 when Salvador Dali joins the college clicque, and develops feelings for the already published poet Garcia Lorca.  Beltran plays his role to perfection.  He is layered and not at all flamboyant or feminine as many gay characters are portrayed.  Robert Pattinson as Dali, really shows the development of Dali from a strange kid and brilliant cubist painter to a super strange, somewhat weird, world famous painter.  The relationship is played very subtly and sweetly.  The odd man out becomes Louis, I apologize, I don't know the actor's name.  He's very good in showing his inner conflict with Garcia Lorca and Dali and his own sexuality.  He begins to develop jealousy over the close friendship that has formed between Garcia Lorca and Dali, and feels GL is not willing to commit to their shared politics.  All the while there is the undercurrent of revolution and communism.  There really is no happy ending for all of these characters in 1930's Spain, but it's quite interesting to see how the characters develop and grow as the years progress.  If you are a fan of any of the lead actors, I think you will love the film.  If you are a fan of history, I believe you will love it as well.  Anyone who just loves film would appreciate this one.",1405036800,2,1679,4.691780821917808

3833528,2,B0021L8UMQ,"This artistic little endeavor seems to emulate the writing style of Federico Garcia Lorca, the Spanish martyr/poet/playwright, with lingering artistic shots of waving foliage, drops of rain, flowering plants, etc., etc... The story itself explores the young adult lives of Seor Lorca (June, 1898 - August, 1936), eccentric Surrealist artist/playwright Salvador Dali (May, 1904 - January, 1989) and Luis Buuel (February, 1900 - July, 1983), the Spanish-born father of cinematic Surrealism. The three of them attended a Madrid college together in 1922. This movie is based on interviews with Dali near the end of his life.

We watch the three of them become friends; Lorca, appealingly played by Javier Beltran (""El paso"") and Buuel, capably portrayed by Matthew McNulty (""The Mark of Cain"" and LOTS of TV) are already chums when Dali, played by Robert Pattinson (""Twilight""), arrives, insecure but ambitious. All three of them assiduously date women, because homosexuality is illegal in Spain, as it is throughout the Western world at that time, but only Buuel is actually heterosexual. Of the other two, Dali seems to be bisexual, while Lorca plays (pretty much) for the other team.

We are subjected to numerous scenes of collegiate carousing which seem to be universal, whether in Cambridge or Madrid, and the Seattle audience applauded Dali's outspoken nonconformity. One of the actresses did a splendid job as the woman who was in (unrequited) love with Lorca, and I witnessed more of the history of the Spanish revolution than I really sought; but tragically, this movie didn't ""grab"" me. Many in the audience found it moving and informative, so I suspect I was in the minority.

It's clear to me that Pattinson is striving to avoid typecasting which could threaten his career due to his more recent starring role in the ""tween"" vampire franchise (he also appears in the ""Harry Potter"" series). He plays the eccentric artiste Dali very well, but unfortunately, his early variations of the characteristic Dali'esque moustache look glued on. I know, I know, that's pretty picky...

All this generation that eat, drink and have sex are no different from my generation at the University of Puerto Rico in the '70s or the generation of the 2000's and now. We can't call this ""decadent""  because we condemn all the generations to the same adjective. Garcia Lorca is one of the best, maybe the best poet and drama writer of the 20th century, as it was said by no one but Pablo Neruda. Garcia Lorca is the Shakespear of Spain.

I'll agree with those who thought there could have been more to the story but despite that, the film overall worked. It is beautifully shot!
Now for the acting, you have to remember that Bunuel, Lorca and Dali were 3 very exceptional artists in their own right and those are pretty big shoes to fill in. Especially for the Dali role. Take away the Twilight films and you could say Robert Pattinson has his heart in the right place as an actor. The man took on the lead role in the film Cosmopolis and wasn't bad there either. In an interview, Pattinson mentioned that he has never seen the finished version of Little Ashes. For some reason I don't quite believe that and if it's true then it's a shame because he shows a lot of promise despite some minor flaws in his delivery.
The best one was Matthew McNulty as Bunuel and Javier Beltrn portraying Lorca was quite touching and visceral.

If you're a fan of those 3 brilliant artists then jump into this film with an open heart because while it's not perfect, it isn't horrible either.

The first time was an eye-opening experience. The second time was an emotional experience. The actors bring the characters to life - the emotional experience is almost tangible. Love in a time when real love was forbidden, and longing in a time when heartache was the only option. The swimming scene with Federico Lorca (Javier Beltran) and Salvador Dali (Robert Pattinson) is magical. The actors express the freedom of Lorca and Dali - a freedom that ignores the social and polical restrictions of the time. I recommend this film to anyone who FEELS films like I do.

3833742,5,B0021L8UMQ,"Little Ashes is a fictionalized portrait of the relationship between three of the most charismatic and talented Spanish artists of the twentieth century: Federico Garca Lorca, Salvador Dal and Lus Buuel. Its title comes from the name of one of Dal's early paintings that Lorca and Dal discuss during an idyllic holiday they spend together in the Catalan coast.

Little Ashes starts in 1922 when a 24 years old Lorca first meets Dal, then 18. Lorca is shaken by his strong attraction to this shy and narcissistic youth who thinks himself a genius.

That Lorca was homosexual there is no doubt today. But to be homosexual in Spain in the 1920s was not something to flaunt about because it was a crime punishable with 14 years of forced labor. Besides, Spain was a strictly Catholic country, and Lorca raised in this belief would have perceived his sexual inclination to be a sin and a shame for his whole family.

What all this means is that Lorca and Dal's relationship would not have been an easy one in the best of circumstances. If you add to this Dal's pathological fear of being touched, Buuel's jealousy over loosing Lorca's friendship, a smitten girl's determination to make Lorca love her back, and a country already split in two political factions that eventually will fight each other to death during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), you will have some of the ingredients that make this movie such a powerful and heart wrenching story.

The actors, both the Spanish and the British, are excellent, including an almost unrecognizable Robert Pattison (of Twilight fame) as Dal, and the movie is a fascinating portrait of an era.",1345507200,,1637,4.835714285714285

By the time the movie was over and the closing credits were rolling all I could say was WOW! To me it was an amazing movie that has restored my faith that the art of film making does still exist. Far too many movies made nowadays rely way too much on senseless violence, explosions, car chases and way over the top special effects. There is none of that in Little Ashes. Instead they rely on the power of the spoken word and human emotion to create a story that compels you to watch and be drawn into the plot. I will say it helps in watching this movie if you know a little bit about Salvador Dali and his art. The movie does a great job in showing how Dali became the eccentric artist he was. Still even without knowing who he was you will find yourself fasinated by the artistic genious some would call a madman. Robert Pattinson (from Twilight fame) gives an outstanding performance as Dali. I feel though that Javier Beltran steals the show as Federico Garcia Lorca, an up and coming poet who would inspire many to resist against facists trying to gain control of Spain and who finds himself sexually attracted to Dali. There is no doubt in my mind that Little Ashes was one of the best films of 2009. It certainly was on my list among the best for that year.",1322352000,2,1404,4.2819548872180455

This movie tells the story of Dali and Garcia-Loca with sensitivity and passion. In a time where loving one another was not acceptable and where revolutionaries were routinely slaughtered these two artists found something that would haunt and inspire them forever.

There were some parts of the movie that were not really explained well that I would have liked to see some back-story on but overall I really enjoyed it. I thought the acting was superb and that the story flowed well. I found myself wishing that we lived in a world where people didn't need to hide who they really were and were free to fully express themselves.

3833749,3,B0021L8UMQ,"I admit I ordered this DVD partially out of curiosity (can Robert Pattinson really act? yes, actually) and also because I was familiar with Lorca and Dali, but little more than that.  Overall, I'm torn over it.  The cinematography is exceptional, creating a very beautiful film.  The setting, the time period, the costuming - all well done.  The dialog is somewhat sparse - there are long instances where there is little or no talking - but woven throughout are excerpts from Lorca's poetry that really add to the mood and tone.  The acting is superb, especially the leads, Robert Pattinson and Javier Beltran.  I was surprised at how they disappeared into their roles, even more so for Pattinson.  I feel he had the more challenging role in bringing the eccentric, brilliant and somewhat unhinged Dali to life.

The story is alternately angst-ridden, languid and intense. However, the movie is incredibly slow.  Almost tortuously slow at times.  I think the filmmakers intended to show the gradual growth of feeling between the two men, but sometime I felt like I was looking at a lovely painting instead of a living story.  There are some very intense scenes, in particular when Dali and Lorca attempt to have sex without really taking the reality of it into account.  This scene was gut-wrenching and emotional, but there were too few scenes of such intensity.  Overall, fans of historical and/or biographical films who have a lot of patience may find this rewarding.  I thought it was a good film, but not one I would watch again.",1298419200,3,1534,4.85

The acting is wonderful and genuine.  Javier Beltran beautifully creates the tragic Lorca but it is probably Robert Pattinson that has people seeking the film now.  Mr. Pattinson may have critics who begrudge him his Twilight success but his performance here as Salvatore Dali is captivating.  He transforms from the painfully shy and frightened young student to the eccentric, grandiose, successful artist.  It is the most challenging role in the film because this character goes through the most changes.

Dali created himself much in the way he created his art.  And Pattinson captures this.  You take the journey with him.

Matthew McNulty is another up and coming actor to watch.  In the end I believe this is really Lorca's story, a man who could never be free to be himself in his time and in his country.

3833915,2,B0021L8UMQ,"Based on the performances, this might have been a better movie if it had been all-Spanish rather than Spanish/English, both in language and production. In the four principal roles, the two Spanish actors (Javier Beltran as Garca Lorca and Marina Gatell as Magdalena) are good, but the two English actors (Robert Pattinson as Dal and Matthew McNulty as Buuel) are awful. Even I as a non-Spanish speaker could tell their accents were as phony as mine would be. Pattinson sounds like an American in the Twilight movies, but in this he just sounds English with a bad Spanish accent, and McNulty is no better.

Bad accents are forgivable if there's acting talent to make up for it, but there isn't in these cases. I never for one second believed in anything Pattinson said or did, particularly when he had to pretend to be attracted to Beltran; it was painfully incompetent acting. He should stick to imitating Marlon Brando with orange contacts and leave Spanish roles to the Spanish.

Since the Spanish actors were having to speak English dialog, their accents were pretty heavy too, so I needed subtitles, and if I'm going to be reading subtitles anyway I'd rather hear the right language in the soundtrack. This is one movie that should NOT have been an international production. That's a shame, because it's a fascinating story that could have been beautiful rather than tedious.

Dali denied any attraction to Lorca IRL although they were friends and Lorca preferred men.  In the film it's played as if they were having a more intense affair than they actually were.

Little Ashes is about Salvador Dali's time in Madrid at an Art School in the 1920's. Surrounding the story of his growing, and often strained, relationship with Federico Garcia Lorca is the growing political turmoil in Spain that ultimately brings about Federico's demise.

This movie completely utilizes Pattinson's strengths as an actor in ways that I have never seen before. It's absolutely wonderful to see him in this role which allowed him such versatility while still respecting the story and the character he was playing; remembering that Dali was a real person with real passions and eccentricities.

Javier Beltrn, who plays Lorca is fantastic! The gritty passion he brings to this character, while still implementing the strong religious backgrounds of the time, regarding the sexual relationship he so desires with Dali is astounding. It's worth watching over and over again. I honestly don't think that this movie would have worked as well if any other actor played this part.

There are scenes that are so raw you literally cringe with sympathy for the characters and there are scenes filled with delicate longing and passion. It's beautifully written and produced.

3834178,4,B0021L8UMQ,"Fundamentally, this is a truly brilliant and artistic exploration of the life of Federico Garca Lorca, in which Salvador Dali played a major part. Lorca was unquestionably a pivotal figure in the Generation of 27, and Dali was perhaps THE pivotal figure in the surrealist movement that alternately worshiped and shunned him. However, do NOT accept the hype of this work as ""The Gay Dali Movie."" This is the tragic and compelling tale of man who changed his world - Lorca, not Dali - a revolutionary, a poet, a visionary, a playwright, a genius, and a gay man in an culture where all of the above came to be despised.

This movie does him justice, and depicts his contemporaries (including the brilliant and increasingly mad Dali) in accurate, penetrating and often unflattering detail. It is a must-watch for those interested in the rise of fascism, the worlds of art and poetry, the culture of Spain or the artistic and cultural revolutions of the early twentieth century. If you're looking for a great gay period piece, go for Brokeback Mountain or Brideshead Revisited; if you're looking for a brilliant, sensitive and artistic work that happens to be gay, THIS is your movie.",1270252800,4,1179,4.865671641791045

im a huge Twi/Rob Patz fan--and a huge Dali fan.

defend it with a burning passion, even though i happen to be heterosexual.)

The beginning is cute and funny because Dali was such a 'wacko'
with his style/hair/socializing/compared with the 'normal' guys his age and of his time period..it made me laugh a lot.
There just didn't seem like there was enough to work with i guess, script wise?
As if maybe they didn't spend enough time developing the plot etc while writing it?
idk though i didn't even finish the movie so i guess i don't really have a right to talk about it badly...but;;
i could only get through half the movie before being so bored i had to go to sleep..:/
but i was also watching it with someone who wasn't very interested in it at all to begin with so MAYBE that could have effected my mood a TINY bit...
some of it did make me happy, a couple of scenes,
started to get mildly suspenseful for a dramatic-film's-plot

It's the story of three friends  filmmaker Luis Bunel, poet Frederico Garcia Lorca, and painter Salvador Dali when they were students at Art school in Spain.  However the focus of the film is the relationship between Lorca and Dali.  It's very moving and heart-wrenching.  The characters are beautifully  played by Javier Beltran and Robert Pattinson.  Both actors are fantastic.  I was surprized by the chemistry between these two actors.  They played off each other very well. Beltran illustrated Lorca's passion for Dali and Pattinson portrayed the conflicted & eccentric Dali to perfection.  It's about love, loss, fear,regret, love of country & family, prejudice and violence. I decided to look up the work of these artists b/c of the film.  I saw some films of Dali.  He really was eccentric and Robert nailed that.  I was crying at the end because it was very moving and sad.  I would have liked more background information on all three major characters.

He was a nutjob of a genious no doubt, he was eccentric, he was shy and an attention seeker at the same time. Spain at the time of his growing up was a social chaos and that influenced his early and formative years.
Now about the film I can say I believed in the character development and the beautiful photography of the settings. The screenplay could have been better as for the directing it was daring to say the least.
I gave it 5 stars for the subject matter but 4 overall.

Well for those who are buying this movie for their Gooey eyed Son or Daughter Because of the Heart Throb Knowen as Robert Pattinson Please read this review. I bought this movie for my 12 year old sister who is madly in love with the Twilight star, Not knowing this movie has content in it that is not in my opinion good for anyone under the age of 16. The movie it self has a great story line and plot, Very much an art film but for those who know the story behind the movie the subject matter is about a Famous painter ""Dali"" Played by Pattinson, but what they don't tell you on the package is that the story is about his dealing with being Gay, I myself being gay found the film a great art piece but the Nude scene, The sex scene with pattinson Masterbating in the corner while his friend makes love to a women a little bit inappropriate for a child to watch even with an Adult in the room. after seeing this movie with my sister i took the movie back and now keep it in my collection. If you are a parent who does not care about the content then this is a great movie, but if you do care please if you buy make sure you're child or children know about the subject matter. After seeing this movie my Sister will never look at Robert Pattinson the same way again and has told me and her friends she will not even see the Third movie in the Twilight Saga, It made her that upset.

A romantic story about the young life and loves of artist Salvador Dali, filmmaker Luis Buuel and writer Federico Garcia Lorca. Madrid is on the edge of change in 1922. As traditional values are challenged by what is deemed dangerous new influences. Salvador Dali arrives to university, 18 years old and determined to become a great artist. He is a bizarre mixture of shyness and rampant exhibitionism; this attracts the attention of two of the university's social elite - Federico Garcia Lorca and Luis Buuel. Salvador is captivated by their decadent group and for a time Salvador, Luis and Federico becomes a intimidating trio, the most ultra-modern group in Madrid. As time passes, Salvador feels an increasingly strong pull towards the charismatic Federico - who is himself oblivious of the attentions he is getting from his beautiful writer friend, Margarita. Federico and Salvador spend the holiday in the sea-side town of Cadaques. Both the idyllic surroundings and the warmth of the Dali family sweep Federico off his feet. Salvador and he draw closer, sharing their deepest beliefs, inspirations and secrets, convinced that they have found a kind of friendship unknown by others. It is more than a meeting of the minds; it is a fusion of souls. And then one night, in the phosphorescent water, it becomes something else, something much more.",1267315200,4,1424,5.115879828326181

3834483,4,B0021L8UMQ,"There are many reasons to see this film, not the least of which is the continuing fascination with the subject of the story.  Three of Spain's brightest artists of the first part of the 20th century each had live that have fascinated readers and historians for decades.  While this 'quasi-accurate' biographical script by Philippa Goslett is not the definitive documentary many have been waiting for, at least it is a wild quilt of bits and pieces of each of the artists' creative lives - and some of their private lives as well.

1922, Spain, and the art school in Madrid is ripe with talent: poet/playwright Federico Garca Lorca (Javier Beltrn) has already published some of his poems, Luis Buuel (Matthew McNulty) is more involved with the political festering of fascism and what will become Franco's Spain than he is with concentrating on the brilliant films he will eventually make, and the newly arrived Salvador Dal (Robert Pattinson) is making visually shocking entrances in wild clothing while rebelling against the current fads in art.  The three bond, encouraged by the writer Magdalena (Marina Gatell) who merely wants to become not only a famous feminist writer but also a part of the obvious changes in art these three men represent.

The sexuality of Garca Lorca is clear: he finds himself drawn to the creative but peculiar Dal.  Dal's preferences seem to include both men and women and as their beautiful friendship evolves it is Dal who ultimately runs to Paris out of self-doubt and homophobia.  Madrid may be avant-garde, but there is a strong anti-gay contingent (including oddly enough Buuel) and the discord politically and artistically forces many to flee to Paris, the mecca of art.  The bruised and rejected Garca Lorca finds solace in his creation of a traveling theater for his own plays while Dal marries Gala in Paris and completes the famous film 'The Andalusian Dog' with Buuel.  When the three men (and Magdalena) eventually meet again some years later the world has changed, even if old feelings haven't.

If the story sounds disconnected, it is.  There are some very beautiful scenes from director Paul Morrison: a scene with Garca Lorca and Dal in an almost underwater ballet is sensuous and beautifully photographed.  Javier Beltrn is a sensitive actor and does well with the little he has to work with as Garca Lorca.  Robert Pattinson can't quite find the level of the bizarre personality of Dal - it would take a really fine actor to accomplish this.  But the general casting is good.  The editing of this movie is some of the worse on record (Rachel Tunnard) and that factors in a problem with the flow of the film.  But for a diversion and another look at the arts in the early 20th century, LITTLE ASHES is entertaining. It could have been so much better.

Although the film focuses more on the poet Lorca than Dali, it perfectly captures the free-wheeling artistic milieu and the fervor of young artists finding themselves, creating environments with words, paint, costumes to express who they are.

If you are old and cynical you may not appreciate the beauty and sense of exploration and discovery of new worlds expressed by the young artists.  The film inspired me to read more about Dali, Lorca and the art scene of the time. Every moment Robert Pattinson was on camera, from the moment of his entrance in linen ruffles and riding boots, you couldn't take your eyes off him. Pattinson captured the complexity, intelligence and artistic sensibility of this artist, along with his (probably necessary) narcissistic and self-aggrandizing temperament. (Don't all artists need the belief in their genius to promote their art, rather than to end up crazy, cutting off their ears?)

It was disappointing that there were only 4 extras on the DVD, which consist of interviews with the director, screenwriter, and two actors. It would have been great to see some behind-the-scenes footage, deleted scenes or an audio commentary.

Of all the films, I was tremendously impressed at the skill in delivery of Salvador Dali's character by Pattinson.  So many people are aware of him on the BIG screen with works like Twilight, New Moon and Harry Potter, but I believe that his true calling may be with the independent artsy films like Little Ashes.

It may be difficult to see Pattinson as a character so opposite to his Twilight persona of Edward Cullen; however, he is truly an artist in its purist sense.  I look forward to seeing what he will do in the future with period works like Bel Ami and Water for Elephants.

We weren't expecting much simply because this was a low-budget independent movie not getting much attention/buzz.  So, how great to find a gem of a story and captivating acting by the two leads.

The movie is beautifully shot, the colors are magnificent and the story is one you are compelled to hear with an ending scene that will break your heart.

The acting of Pattinson at times can seem awkward, as he has much growing as an actor to do, but he delivers an appropriately weird and uncomfortable performance as Dali.  His performance, unlike those of just plain old bad actors, is anything but boring, and one can only wonder what Pattinson may be capable of with more experience.

And Beltrain as Lorca is hard to take your eyes off of.  He has an ease and sincerity to his delivery that never falters, and you'll wish he'd never stop talking let alone leave the screen!

3834574,3,B0021L8UMQ,"For most of his life, Salvador Dali denied that he had ever been lovers with the tragic poet Federico Garc&iacute;a Lorca -- until the end of his life.

So, writer Philippa Goslett and director Paul Morrison explore what may have been in ""Little Ashes,"" in which two young men become close friends, more-than-friends, only to have their relationship splinter apart. It's a powerful little story with astonishing acting by Robert Pattinson and Javier Beltran, but it tends to meander and shake way too much.

In the Madrid of 1922, a shy and awkward art student named Salvador Dali (Pattinson) is drawn into a circle of vibrant, iconoclastic young artists, including filmmaker Luis Bu&ntilde;uel (Matthew McNulty) and poet Federico Garc&iacute;a Lorca (Javier Beltran). Lorca in particular is intrigued by Dali, who is just discovering his unique melty surrealist style -- and it's not a platonic crush. And though initially he fights against the attraction, a trip to the seaside reveals Lorca's feelings to Dali.

But as their attraction grows, Bu&ntilde;uel feels shut out and tries to pull Dali out of Lorca's orbit -- and after an unsuccessful attempt to consummate their affair, Dali vanishes to Paris without a word. A possibly insulting movie and many years widen the split between them, until Lorca meets Dali, now world famous and in love with the ""witch"" Gala (Arly Jover). Dali has changed, and so has Spain -- with terrible results.

I know relatively little of either Dali or Lorca's lives, but it seems that ""Little Ashes"" is less about what happened than about what MIGHT have happened. Unfortunately it also falls prey to a common flaw in biographical movies, even if they're semi-fictionalized accounts -- it meanders randomly much of the time, and has awkward jumps between the different phases in the two men's lives. And what is up with Beltran suddenly reciting poetry in Spanish?

But if it meanders, it's a picturesque meander -- sunny streets of Madrid, shadowy apartments, rocky beaches, weird surrealist visions of Paris, and fun nightclubs where bright young artists congregate. Paul Morrison has a straightforward directorial style with few ups or downs, but there are some beautiful moments sprinkled throughout it -- such as a balletic swim in a moonlit blue sea, or the bittersweet final scenes for Lorca (interspersed with Dali frantically smearing black paint all over).

But this movie would be utterly forgettable if it weren't for the leads. Both are painfully magnificent, both in their chemistry and in their attempts to embody their characters. Beltran is a tragic figure who brims over with passion, sorrow and integrity, and somehow you know that things never end happily for this poor man. Marina Gatell has a small but well-acted role as a young woman passionately in love with Lorca, but obviously she can be nothing more than his friend (and once, a sexual proxy for Dali).

And Pattinson exudes almost Johnny-Depplike skill in almost becoming Dali. This is no glamorous ""Twilight"" role -- at first Pattinson plays him as a twitchy, painfully awkward and shy young man, but as Dali grows in confidence he also becomes more insistently eccentric and flamboyant, to the point where Lorca no longer recognizes him as a person. Mad laughter, insane grief, and all the time we're never quite sure what he's truly thinking about anything -- except, at the end, about Lorca himself.

""Little Ashes"" is a flawed portrait covered in jewel-like paint -- the actors are truly astonishing in their skill, but the direction is a straightforward and spotty affair. And it's all the more tragic because at least some of it is true.",1255737600,24,3661,5.039669421487603
3834575,1,B0021L8UMQ,"I bought this movie because I was interested in Salvador Dal - the artist. The movie rambles through his early college years in a two hour fixation with a homosexual affair he may or may not have had with another student. Who cares! Dali ate sandwiches, cleaned his shoes, had lovers, sat on the toilet, just like we all do. but what was extraordinary about Dali is that he was also a brilliant painter and this movie basically avoids that aspect of his life altogether. It also barely touches on any of the eccentricities he was famous for. If this were a movie about Joe Bloggs who was a nice looking guy who fell in love with his mate then it would be an ok movie, but as a record of Dali's life it's plain terrible! If you love Robert Pattinson you may struggle through this, if you love Dali it will bore you to tears.",1254268800,4,823,4.282051282051282

If this is the level of acting that Robert Patterson is capable of then I look forward to seeing the after Twilight films from him.,1251504000,11,425,4.2625

3834579,5,B0021L8UMQ,"IMHO this film is simply universally great. Thus not made for a target-group. If you need to belong to one, you will find much to dislike. If not, it has a richness beyond your imagination.

The title refers to a remark Lorca makes about the first of what would become the Dali-style paintings. Lorca is incorporated in the picture, and the inspiration for it, so Dali askes him to name his 'breakthrough'. Lorca's anwer,""Little Ashes"", is his melancholic reference to what in the end will remain of their relationship. ""The painting will still be there"" Dali objects. Lorca is not convinced but they find each other when Dali proclaims [that the only matter of importance is that]:""I can see you now, Frederico"". Which obviously is meant in the broadest/deepest meaning of the word 'see', and they embrace. At that moment their relationship remains still platonic but becomes a significant step more intimate, maybe uniquely intimate for Dali. The scene is important for many reasons, one of them is the fact that according to most historians Dali was incapable of being touched [man & woman alike]: it may be one of Dali's many made-up stories, but he once stated that he and his lifelong wife Gala were ""virgins to each other"" [Gala was famously very not a virgin, so to speak].

The atmosphere of the earlier scene is also in stark contrast with the scene eight years later [1936] when they meet each other again after a long period and Lorca is burdened with the threatening developements in Spain [and sadly not his own safety: Lorca was murdered by the fascists in '36] while Dali has become a money-loving poseur who almost advertises the concept of a world-war ""that will eliminate the weaker elements everywhere, a great cleansing"". They are worlds apart now.

Both scenes and the ones in between are brilliantly acted by Javier Beltran, who as Lorca radiates inner beauty and unworldly amounts of charm that make brickbuilded straight truckdrivers cry when he dies, while Robert Pattinson is amazing in his portrayal of the totally transforming Dali: Pattinson leaves you, as a spectator, completely in the dark where it all comes from, it seems like he managed to convince Dali's ghost to make a great come-back via him.

Matthew McNulty as a very macho homophobic Luis Bunuel is entirely convincing too, especially when he, as a result of reading Lorca's diary, is appalled because of it's content but at the same time doubts his independent mind, being not able to understand his friend. Thus he storms straight from the diary to a gay meeting place where he violently fails to achieve any 'progress'. In the end however his feelings of friendship for Lorca prevail, though he never will be capable to mention the subject. Which is kind of endearing when he franticly warns his friend not to go to a fascist dominated area of Spain because of Lorca's political convictions and the fact that ""they know.....everything!""
These will be the last words Lorca will hear from his friend.

More than enough said: this film is simply too good to put into words.

[I DO hope however that if/when released the American DVD will get another cover since the region 2 version is a 'Do Not Buy' add.]",1248220800,12,3199,4.828467153284672
3834580,3,B0021L8UMQ,"For most of his life, Salvador Dali denied that he had ever been lovers with the tragic poet Federico Garca Lorca -- until the end of his life.

So, writer Philippa Goslett and director Paul Morrison explore what may have been in ""Little Ashes,"" in which two young men become close friends, more-than-friends, only to have their relationship splinter apart. It's a powerful little story with astonishing acting by Robert Pattinson and Javier Beltran, but it tends to meander and shake way too much.

In the Madrid of 1922, a shy and awkward art student named Salvador Dali (Pattinson) is drawn into a circle of  vibrant, iconoclastic young artists, including filmmaker Luis Buuel (Matthew McNulty) and poet Federico Garca Lorca (Javier Beltran). Lorca in particular is intrigued by Dali, who is just discovering his unique melty surrealist style -- and it's not a platonic crush. And though initially he fights against the attraction, a trip to the seaside reveals Lorca's feelings to Dali.

But as their attraction grows, Buuel feels shut out and tries to pull Dali out of Lorca's orbit -- and after an unsuccessful attempt to consummate their affair, Dali vanishes to Paris without a word. A possibly insulting movie and many years widen the split between them, until Lorca meets Dali, now world famous and in love with the ""witch"" Gala (Arly Jover). Dali has changed, and so has Spain -- with terrible results.

I know relatively little of either Dali or Lorca's lives, but it seems that ""Little Ashes"" is less about what happened than about what MIGHT have happened. Unfortunately it also falls prey to a common flaw in biographical movies, even if they're semi-fictionalized accounts -- it meanders randomly much of the time, and has awkward jumps between the different phases in the two men's lives.
