4467769,4,B004ULEEY8,"This movie has received some pretty harsh reviews from critics, but I enjoyed it a lot.  No it's not ""the king's speech"", but who cares.

4467770,3,B004ULEEY8,"Battle: Los Angeles certainly seemed to have the same sort of potential that District 9 did leading up to its theatrical release. Some people were reminded of Independence Day from the promotion of Battle: Los Angeles while I leaned more toward District 9 since it was one my favorite films of 2009 and one of the more recent sci-fi films that left a lasting impression on me. Nevertheless, going in I was fairly convinced Battle: Los Angeles would have the same sort of impact District 9 did a few years ago; it'd make a pretty hefty profit while receiving a heap of positive reviews. While the film could still go on to make a killing at the box office, it unfortunately was fairly disappointing in the long run.

While District 9 was my impression going in, it didn't take long for that impression to be shattered. That could be a good thing if the film ventured off into original territory or decided to travel a path that hasn't been done to death, but it didn't. The film is probably closer to Independence Day than District 9 with a little bit of Speed and Armageddon thrown in for good measure. Speaking of Armageddon, I really felt like I was watching a Michael Bay movie. The camera work was really sloppy, especially during the heavy warfare and devastation scenes. It made me just as nauseous as some of the more irritating scenes in Cloverfield. For the first half of the film, you don't get a clear shot of these extraterrestrials or their aircrafts. It just seemed really reminiscent of Transformers with a lot of the action taking place off screen. In Battle: Los Angeles, you see a lot of the gunfire and much of the action but you don't get a clear shot of what they're dealing with until later.

It's a shame that the more action packed scenes aren't filmed better because they're pretty much the highlight of the film. Seeing the destruction these invaders have caused is incredible. The film makes you believe that Los Angeles is actually in ruins. The other really positive note is that the sound is fantastic. If you see this film, see it in a theater you know has a better than average sound system. When the aliens first show up and that high pitched squeal starts along with all of their other otherworldly sounds on top of roaring gunfare and marines screaming at each other is really just something else. The film uses two of your senses to a pretty fantastic extent, but your brain eventually steps in to tap you on the shoulder and tell you it's basically nothing more than glorified eye and ear candy.

The cast is really dull. It feels like you're watching a cast full of six to twelve duplicates of the same character. Maybe that's because we follow one platoon from the Marines the entire film, but still none of them really stick out other than Aaron Eckhart. Eckhart has the chance to let SSgt. Michael Nantz show some genuine emotion in the film. The platoon that died because of him on a previous mission is the driving factor of his character and him having to prove he's worth being where he is to another platoon that thinks he got those men killed just so he can survive ties into the storyline of the film fairly well.

Battle: Los Angeles doesn't come anywhere close to living up to its potential. Ever crave something you really like to eat it and then get it only to have it leave a bad taste in your mouth? That's Battle: Los Angeles. The film feels too common and too cliche. It honestly just made me want to watch District 9 again and anticipate a sequel to that more than anything. But whether Battle: Los Angeles reminds you of District 9, Independence Day, Transformers, or some other film you've seen before, you've probably seen an alien invasion done better. Besides, do you really want to watch a film that you think is done by Michael Bay when it's not? Still, the action fan in me can't claim the film is completely terrible due to the intense action sequences and incredible sound used throughout the film.",1299888000,5,3965,4.564606741573034
4467771,3,B004ULEEY8,"Movie opens with a platoon of marines out of Camp Pendleton flying into the heat of battle over LA as the alien invasion takes shape.  A flashback of twenty-four hours gives you the backstories on most of the featured characters right up until the action starts.  The aliens quickly take the coastlines and move inland quickly.  The decision is made to draw a line inland and use fighter planes to bomb out the alien ground troops, believing they lack airpower.  Staff Sgt. Nantz (Aaron Eckhardt) leads his unit into the bombed out streets of the city to rescue civilians holed up in a police station before the strafing begins.  But the aliens soon reveal their aerial strength, negating the military's advantage and hastening the takeover of the city.  Their numbers down, Nantz must both protect the civilians and reach a safe point before they're overcome by the invaders.  In the midst of a last ditch evacuation, Nantz discovers the location of the alien's command center and leads his team in a desperate strike to cripple their forces.

As far as the action goes- Note to Hollywood: get rid of that 'Shaky-Cam' garbage!  What's the point of a battle when you can't even tell what the hell's happening?  (Ok, they're shooting- wait, what was that?  Who got hit?  Where'd those come from... and how did he get killed?)  It's not edgy, it's not gritty and it's not dramatic- it's a stupid gimmick to fudge a fight scene... and it doesn't even do that anymore.  Xbox has clearer shootouts than this.  There's lots of bodies, bullets and things that get blowed up good- everything you want in an alien invasion/war movie.  Problem is they also drown out the dialog- half the time you can't even hear what they're saying over the gunfire and whatnot.  But the images of LA burning look pretty good, especially at night, and give a great sense of the grimness of the situation.

The script gets pretty silly at times, even for an action flick.  Much was made of the whole 'aliens have been spying upon us for decades' plot, but it never materializes.  They land and they kill, with barely a handwave as to why (we got water, lots of water).  The bulk of the movie centers upon the platoon's street engagements with the aliens as they struggle to reach the safe haven of the base. But whether you've served in the military or just seen a whole bunch of movies, there's some things that don't require both hands and a map to figure out: Why would you think the aliens don't have airpower when they just landed from outer space?  Hey guys- where would you put a command center to protect it if you were invading- underground, you say?  Wow.  Dude- how do we take out the Enemy Command Ship?  By firing only one missile at a time instead of unloading everything we got on that sucker so we can milk this a little longer?  Riiight.

Characters are straight out of the cereal box, with only a few brief deviations.  You'd think for all the time spent building them up at the beginning you might get some- nope.  The moments that are supposed to tug at your heart strings and inspire you a little, don't.  With a nearly full house there were no cheers, jeers or anything.  Plus you can pretty much tell which ones have the red-shirts on.

'Battle: LA' is nothing if not earnest, but you won't be too impressed by any of it.  But it's good for tossing down some popcorn and jujubees.",1299801600,17,3376,4.573333333333333
4467772,4,B004ULEEY8,"i would like to start off by saying that this movie was pretty well filmed good actors. but this is no star wars or avatar by any means. the one mistake and the one thing i did not like about this movie was the fact that they make it a war movie. in alien invasion movies like these you have to have more back story about the aliens ( which you get a little bit of in this movie) why their are doing what thier doing and so on. I was expecting much much bigger battle scenes like a bunch of tanks, troops, miltary vechiles, agaisnt the alien troops and their tanks. you get some of that and you do get good battle scenes (by the way the stuff you hear about the film having a lot of shaky camera movement during the battle scenes that is not entirely true  but some of it is) but i was hoping for something like star wars episode II the ending battle  in that film was awesome and i was kind of hoping for something like that in this film. but their is still good battle scenes in this movie. give this movie a chance it was not what i was hoping for but it turned out a lot better and i do mean a lot better then i though it would be.",1299801600,,1135,3.9304347826086956

4467780,3,B004ULEEY8,"The critics were way too hard on this one. It ain't fancy, but for a stripped-down sci-fi action flick it's pretty good. Think Black Hawk Down meets Independence Day. I like the economy, the way it wastes no time getting right down to it. I like the aliens and the other effects. I like most of the cast. I like the immediacy of the handheld camera work -- often annoying when misused, but here it does a decent job of putting you right in the scared, jumpy action. OK, the story gets kind of meandering about midway into it, and the dialogue gets corny and hoo-ra.

4467783,5,B004ULEEY8,"One of the more accurate depictions of U.S. Marines, in attitude, disposition, dedication to mission and combat loyalty to each other; Marines tend to complain about everything until the shit hits the fan. However, similar in traits to this film's depiction, when order and rules fly out the window, causing even the most stout of heart to run for the hills, is when it's time to send in the Marines.

Unlike most Hollywood tales of a liberalized, singular and often feminized, hero's journey, the inherent heart, courage and intuitive warrior-skills of well-trained, individual Marines, when engaged with an enemy, combine into the most formidable, offensive combat-teams. Advancing in highly-disciplined units of unstoppable, deadly-force, it is the rapid pace and coordination of improvisational teamwork that so often becomes the enemy's worst nightmare. ""Dogs from Hell"", as the Germans in WW-I called us, is but one small, albeit true attribute of Marines in combat. As an overall battle-assessment however, it was and remains a foolish, overly-simplified underestimation of epic proportion!",1520899200,,1097,5.529761904761905

4467786,5,B004ULEEY8,"Fabulous movie.  Sci-fi and action movies are a favorite of mine, but... they don't often offer the highest quality acting or writing, so generally I have lower standards for them.  But this movie was head and shoulders above most sci-fi invasion pictures I've ever seen - tight writing, terrific acting, even had strong women characters (Michelle Rodriguez and others).  And Aaron Eckhart was amazing, I'll be checking out his other movies now.

Strong story, great acting, lots of action, engaging characters - what more could you want?  Plus, the portrayal of marines and inner rank relationships was credible and compelling.  At the end, I actually jumped up and cheered - for our military, for the brave civilians, for people everywhere banding together to defend our families, our countries, and and our world.

4467815,5,B004ULEEY8,"This is a movie that really isn't anything new. In fact, if you seen Black Hawk Down and District 9, it may look familiar. What this film does that makes it so great is that it can combine these elements together so well, that you really can't believe that this hasn't been done before. They made the right choice by including a Marine platoon into the script, rather than some nameless group of soldiers or whoever wears a uniform so that Johnny Civilian can get the picture that they are U.S. troops. It isn't the most perfect depiction of Marines, as I was one and remember the ""F"" bomb being used a whole heck of a lot more frequently, but it is passable. Aaron Eckhart really does a great job in his role as a battle tested Staff Sergeant. I think anyone else playing this character would have a hard time pulling it off exactly how he did. The rest of the cast is not all that bad either, given the scope of the story. And I am not a fan of Michelle Rodriguez, but she was tolerable- for the most part.

You have to remember that this is a movie about an alien invasion, it is not mona lisa smile. You have probably seen these movies before, but not like this. This is urban warfare fighting in the streets of downtown Los Angeles. It's fun and exciting, and better than half of the other ""realistic"" war movies that are already out. I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes sci-fi and military movies. You won't be disappointed. The critics have taken a proverbial dump on this movie, but what do they know anyway. This is exactly the movie I expected it to be when I walked in to the theater, and a little bit more with some character believability and Aaron Eckhart's acting. I will be eagerly awaiting the Blu-ray release so that I can watch this all over again in HD in the comfort of my living room.

4467820,5,B004ULEEY8,"This got a 35% on Rotten Tomatoes, but I feel it fully deserves five stars from me. It's a tense war picture more than a scifi movie, capturing the experience of what it's like to be a Marine in constant, heavy combat. The characters are well-drawn and relatable. I am guessing they had a lot of actual Marine advisers, bringing plausible realism to the battle scenarios. To this civilian (and I may be completely wrong), it rings very true to what combat must be like --- you get a good peep at the professional standards and practices of soldiering.

I'm frankly stunned so many critics hated it when far stupider action flicks (e.g., Thor) get rave reviews.  Part of the criticism of the picture comes from ""stupid dialog"", but I honestly found the things people said not ""stupid dialog"" but an attempt to capture the way people really talk.  I mean, if you're in a war situation where you're trying to comfort a little boy who has just lost his father, you are not going to be spouting Shakespeare, and you're inevitably not going to say all the right things you might say if you had time to reflect.  That's the case with the dialog here.

As someone who is ignorant of military life, I found the teamwork very interesting to watch, and it seemed plausible to me, like it was the way Marines in such a situation who were competent soldiers would really interact.  Now, again, I say this as someone who has never been a Marine or even known a Marine, so I may be completely wrong, and, if I am, leave a comment telling me how this movie gets it wrong.  I'd be interested.

I liked the little detail of the ""Retreat, Hell"" chant, too.  It was inspiring, but not too corny.  It was sympathetic how they used the chant to buck up their courage and get focused back on task.

The effects in the movie are more subtly done than a lot of CGI.  It doesn't *look* like CGI in most scenes. There are not the annoyingly dark filters a lot of such movies place over the image to hide any defects in the computer work, so it has a kind of gritty realism.

One criticism I have is of the shaky camera work.  I understand that this is an attempt to add to the realism, but I find it a cheap trick.  The choreography of the scene should communicate the chaos and desperation, not the cameraman!",1500076800,,2283,4.389548693586699

Can't say more or I'd give too much away, but bottom line: really outstanding writing; very fine acting performances by at least half a dozen superb actors; too many to list.

There is one thing that drives me crazy in movies and that is shaky photography.  I think the shaky camera effect is overused and doesn't do a movie justice.  It makes the movie annoying and does nothing but cheapen everything.  It also gives me a headache.  I truly wish they wouldn't use that feature in movies but apart from that....the action, plot and music in this movie was very good.  Acting was fantastic and since I have actually walked on that Camp Pendleton base in southern cal... it was very interesting to me as I actual lived in the area for a couple of decades.

There's a total of about 5 good minutes in this movie, and that's the confusion in the immediate aftermath of the aliens' arrival, told mostly through news anchors in the background.

Other than that, it's as if the director tried to shove in as many war movie cliches as possible, ticking off the checkboxes of what they thought an epic war movie should include. Spoiler: that's not how good movies are made.

Here's the plot: aliens have invaded, so they need to be killed. That's it.

Additionally, many disaster movies fail in their over reliance on shock value of the disaster.

I love sci-fi space invaders-type movie.
1950s, japanese( w/ starman), triffids, not-too-distant-future, whatever.
but this was just about winning a conventional war.
it was through a military lens. like the soldiers stories.
if it was set in the battle of Faluja, it would have had higher stakes.
they would have been real soldier stories. not clichs in a fantasy war.
it should have decided to be a war and market itself as one.
as far as alien invasion movies go, this was loud and the shaky camera thing is outta control.

4467906,1,B004ULEEY8,"Even for a mindless action movie, it was sh177y.  I often try to give things the benefit of the doubt, but there was nothing that I liked about this movie at all.  The worst part for me was the terrible camera work, which, I believe, was filmed by an epileptic in an electric chair.  I could easily give it another star or two if it had ONE single steady shot in the entire film, but it just didn't happen.  Watching the movie gave me a headache and made me want to have a seizure of my very own.

I'm usually pretty cool with bad acting/thin plots/excessive explosions/etc., but mounting a camera to the head of a wild pig with an espresso IV is no way (in my opinion) to shoot a movie theater quality movie.

If this had gone straight to video, I would write a much different review.  Since I paid good money to see this in a movie theater on a big screen, I feel pretty ripped off.

I wanted to go to Wal-Mart and Target with a roll of stickers that read ""This movie sucks a$$"" when the DVD was released.",1475539200,2,1007,4.154639175257732

4467912,5,B004ULEEY8,"Very good action/sci-fi film.  Aliens arrive on ships in the initial form of meteorites and their intent is to suck up all our water, killing us all along the way.  That's where the military comes in.  Thus begin very good battle scenes.  The Marines have to go into the hot zone of Santa Monica to rescue civilians.  Along for the ride is a battle green lieutenant (the leader of the troop), a battle seasoned staff sergeant (whom no one trusts and want along because his last mission went badly), and a typical but eclectic bunch of grunts.  Some of the performances are quite good, including Aaron Eckhart as the staff sergeant, Noel Fisher as Lenihan, Will Rothhaar as Imlay, Gino Anthony Pesi as Stavrou and Adetokumboh M'Cormack as Adukwu.
The movie's weakness is a couple of corny dialogue scenes.  Its strength is the battle scenes and the comraderie amongst the soldiers.  I have to say that after the freeway scene I felt a little battle-weary.  The effects are excellent but they have their flaws.  The space vessels look like an intricate mess, not unlike the ships in District 9.  The aliens are slimy, icky and yucky.  My assumption is that they are bred and reared solely as fighting machines.  It appears that these E.T.'s have no culture or aims other than war and water consumption.  The aliens are never shown full-on, close-up and clearly; I suppose to mask the special effects failings.
Still the film is a wild ride and is worth getting.",1474675200,7,1459,4.715415019762846

4467936,3,B004ULEEY8,"Battle: Los Angeles
 Battle: Los Angeles is billed as an alien invasion movie but it plays much more like a conventional war movie.  In the recent War of the Worlds we had ample opportunity to be scared by the alien invaders.  In Battle: Los Angeles we are too busy dodging bullets to be afraid of the aliens in particular.  We fear the ordinary quick, random and final results of urban combat.  And Director Jonathan Liebesman (notably also director of the 2006 incarnation of Texas Chainsaw Massacre-so we know he can scare us) shows urban combat to good effect.  Most of the combat scenes are filmed using hand held cameras which gives a real sense of immediacy to the viewer.  He captures the violence, terror and confusing speed of combat to a tee.  Often the Marines fighting the aliens do not know exactly what they are fighting or where the enemy is.  This makes for tense and gripping combat scenes.
 Dont come to this one looking for subtle nuance.  The aliens invade our turf and kill our friends and neighbors-lots and lots of them.  The Marines mission is to stop them.  We do not enjoy, or suffer through, much in the way of character development.  The individual Marines seem to be as expendable as the security team members in the original Star Trek TV series.  Most don't last long enough for us to get very attached to them.
 Aaron Eckhart, recently staring in the ho-hum rom-com Love Happens is just the jaw jutting hero for this kind of film.  We know of his personal demons but true to the tradition of Sgt. Rock, he lets nothing human or inhuman stand in the way of his mission.  He is supported by Michelle Rodriguez as an Air Force soldier in a role critical to the plot and Bridget Moynahan as a civilian in need of rescue.  They exist only to make the plot have some glue to hold it from disintegration.  In the make believe historical war film earlier this year The Eagle such female additions were exempted entirely.  Bridget and Michelle might as well have sat this one out, for all their characters added to the film.  Blame the writer.
 If nonstop action is your thing, see Battle: Los Angeles.  It opened at number one, so you won't be alone.  The PG-13 (lots and lots of death) film brought in $36 million in three days, a good number to help make back the $70 million budget.  It hasn't yet opened overseas, where the least subtle films seem to do quite well.
 This two and a half saw blade war and testosterone film runs one hour and fifty six minutes.  Battle: Los Angeles views considerably better than last years alien invasion Skyline, also set in Los Angeles.  See it as a war movie; see War of the Worlds for a much better alien invasion film.",1469836800,,2684,4.5103734439834025

4467943,5,B004ULEEY8,"Battle Los Angles is one of my all time favorite movies. And being 56 yrs. old, and being female ,and ex-Army that's saying a lot! A whole lot! I do watch movies to be entertained and this movie is perfect for me. It's serious,fun,scary,bravery,honor and duty! All of which I hold in very high regard. All of the actors did an excellent job! This movie was exactly what it should have been. Being humans, we all have our own opinions, but honestly I never listen to the critics anymore. The few times I did in the past, put me in the mood to pull my hair out in frustration!!!! I believe they all must live in la la land and have no concept of actually just watching a movie with no ulterior motive such as taking a crap on it in the first 10 minutes. I think they have that as their standby plan before the movie even starts. That being said, I have watched this movie 12 times in 14 days! I love it that much! I've probably watched it at least 65 times in the last year alone. As to the special effects, they're great. But a lot is subtle. I've watched it in slow motion and picked up soldiers in the background getting shot or blown up on the tank firing from the middle of the road . I could go on and on but I'll just say, critics are like politicians , they're full of something bad. Just sit back and watch the movie and enjoy!",1468800000,19,1334,4.134615384615385

How foolish and impossible. An alien race that far advanced would be able to vaporize us with some far advanced weapon system so quickly that our race would be completely annihilated within seconds from the time they first came.

4468034,3,B004ULEEY8,"The planet is being bombarded by small meteors that are landing outside the beach coasts in the water. Military intelligence learns that the meteors are actually slowing down before impact. Minutes later various cities are being attacked with Los Angeles apparently taking the worst of it. A Marine unit is sent into Los Angeles to battle and rescue any civilians found on the scene. But what exactly are they up against? -summary

 Battle: Los Angeles directed by Jonathan Liebesman was a movie that I actually made some type of effort to see in theaters during its 2011 release. I heard about the cliches, the aping of other movies, and I really didn't care about these complaints, since I have always been a fan of both war and alien invasion movies. For the most part, I did enjoy the movie because there were plenty of things Liebesman did very well, and I enjoyed it a little bit more on my recent rewatch.

 The plot follows SSGT Michael Nantz played by Aaron Eckhart, and Lt. William Martinez (Ramon Rodriguez) as they take their platoon deep into enemy territory in battle torn Los Angeles. From there, they come into heavy resistance from an unknown, yet alien enemy that pours on some casualties; what soon begins is a fight for survival as they try and leave the battle area before a certain amount of time elapses.

 I have a very soft spot for military movies because I spent more than 5 years of my life serving. Yes, I do search for some cool action, in which I did hope to find here, but I keep a sharp eye for certain details in military themed movies. I want to see the selfless service, duty to country, and sense of brotherhood that captures all it means to be a soldier or a Marine. I want to see people from many different backgrounds and races coming together to form one unit, one blood, and this is exactly what I got with this film. The characters were developed well enough to at least let the audience know that these were people with real lives, problems, and families to go back to. Liebesman did a fine enough job in this area.

 I also feel he did an excellent job building up the threat and atmosphere. The first several minutes before you actually see the enemy is done very well, and the sense of confusion being attacked by an unknown threat felt real. I am aware that since this is an alien invasion movie, that it may seem as if I'm reaching for its good qualities, because in some folks eyes, these movies are seen as nothing more than mindless entertainment. Still, I commend the direction of this film because it did break from the usual formula in some way. My complaint to a certain degree is that it did abandon one genre cliche for other genre cliches, that did come off kind of cheesy and were even predictable. In any case, I can't say I completely disliked the script or direction.

 While the set pieces have its moments of coolness and even a gritty atmosphere; I can't say that the action scenes truly roped me in. I'll point out one moment was very well written and tense, but I didn't care for all of the action since I wanted more gore. This is an alien invasion film after all, and it really wouldn't have hurt to give us action fans some really Starship Trooper-ish blood soaked moments: red, green, blue, or chocolate, it really wouldn't have mattered to me. I felt the gun-toting payoff was kind of weak, yo.

 The aliens designs and equipment felt otherworldly, so props to that part. Eckert delivered a fine performance as the reluctant leader who suffered his share of losses, and the rest of the cast were OK at best. This is also one of the rare moments that the usual tomboy on the scene Michelle Rodriguez didn't make me cringe.

 Battle: Los Angeles has its problems, with being too predictable and sporting its fair share of by the numbers play put on blast, yet on the flipside it does plenty of things right. I lightly recommend this movie to action fans, just don't come into this expecting extremely over the top action like in Starship Troopers. The movie has a 116 minute run time.

It is like the movie Independence Day mashed with some Speed, bits of District 9, Black Hawk Down and Battleship.  Laze the target and send in that Copperhead.  The only thing maybe missing is a Kaiju that comes through a portal.  This movie is still very entertaining. LA gets hosed and starts looking a little like Baghdad.

4468119,5,B004ULEEY8,"Delete the alien references and this is a war movie, plain and simple. I grew up on those in the post-WW2 era--Sands of Iowa Jima, A Walk in the Sun, etc--and this follows their example, almost word for word.  There are the usual cast of characters, the commanding officer just out of military school, the sergeant ready for retirement and called back to duty, the beardless recruit, but all that notwithstanding, it's a good movie of its time.

As usual in this time of film, there's no reason given for the alien invasion. They're here and let's protect out planet and that's it! The experts quickly declare this a colonization--and the military definition of invasion versus colonization (which I'd never considered) will quickly make some think of our own arrival in the New World, but that's a debate for another day.  The aliens are also discovered to be using water as fuel and it's decided that's why they want Earth, for its oceans, though it's never explained how any of these facts are learned. One might argue that to exploit a planet's resources, colonization isn't really necessary. However...

The plot is for a group of marines from Camp Pendleton to rescue some civilians caught behind the lines as Los Angeles is being prepared to be bombed to keep it out of enemy hands.  The old ""Burnt Earth"" ploy. Their fight to get to the nearest FOB is the main focus and along the way, if they happen to take out some important alien targets, that's OK, too.

Though all war movie cliches are brought into play, they don't sound like cliches at the time.  The film goes into a bit of background of the main characters and makes it personal enough that all the players are given a sense of individuality. There's the usual camaraderie among fighting men, enough to make the audience care.

Though there's no real resolution at the end, hope appears evident as it's indicated a battle is won and so will be the war. (Spoiler?) The emphasis is on a small group of ground forces instead of fighter pilots a la Independence Day or one individual struggling to find his family as in War of the Worlds.  If you like war movies, ignore the alien juggernauts  and view it from a merely military standpoint.",1435190400,,2205,4.65979381443299

In the interest of full disclosure, my son is in the United States Marine Corps, so I may be just a bit biased. That being said, I feel this is, so far, the best blend of military & science fiction I've seen so far.  If you discount the aliens you have an excellent war film. Each of the men in the squad has a back-story that makes them compelling and easy to relate to. there is also the war-weary Sgt. just days away from retirement, the 'boot' who is so young his parents had to give him permission to enlist, the new 2nd Lt. who's wife is pregnant with their first child, the young Marine who is in the middle of planning his soon-to-be-wedding when the invasion comes, and the frightened yet patriotic civilian accompanied by his son who wants to prove to the boy he is just as manly as the Marines. Now if you've watched any war movies you will recognize these characters. One or two show up in every war movie and it is just a matter of time before they buy it in a blaze of glory. But in this film you have all of them in the same squad! Tension runs high as you try to figure out who will live and who will die before the movie hits it's end. To add to this drama, you have the aliens. A bit unlike anything to come out of Hollywood before. They are outfitted with weapons and equipment that is decades beyond ours and have a physiology that makes them nearly impossible to kill with the common arsenal of the average grunt. This is a well written, well directed, well acted film that uses a bit of that ""hand-held"" style camera work to give it a very real feeling news report style. If you like war movies or science fiction movies, you will like this. It is edge of your seat action from the get-go and the Marines act like, well, Marines and will make you proud.",1430611200,13,1795,4.233236151603498

4468152,1,B004ULEEY8,"Only one word accurately and effectively sums up my reaction to ""BATTLE: LOS ANGELES"" -- ""dull and boring"" (okay, you're right... that's ""TWO"" words, but apt all the same).

I'd long been aware of the less than stellar opinions others have had of this movie, and even before anyone even had a chance to review the film, the promotional materials did not make it seem all that interesting to me either. But not too long after it had had its moment to shine (as it were), I did finally decide to snatch a peek at it for myself so I could pass my own judgment on the property; as it would turn out however, I was instead introduced to the  ""Asylum"" knockbuster, ""Battle *OF* Los Angeles.""

But the real downside of that mistake was not the fact that I was slipped a cinematic Mickey, but that unlike ""B:LA,"" I was actually able to sit through the entire movie-- travesty though it was --and managed not to feel completely bored out of my mind! I don't even remember anything about the Asylum ""BoLA"" knock-off, other than that it had something to do with 'time travel,' but I do remember much of this movie, and wishing I could've just as easily relegated this one to the ""Memory Hole"" as well. By the time I was beginning to experience some relief with that ever-dreaded ""Thank God That Movie's Over"" feeling, lo and behold, I move to turn the movie off before the credits start to run (a rarity for me, as I typically watch all movies in their full entirety, from very beginning to very end), and... ""SUM-MUH-MA-BICH!!! -- You mean this movie is only *HALF* over???? I gotta sit through close to ANOTHER *HOUR* of this mess? Jee-Tee-Eph-Oh-Aych!"" So that was where it all ended for me, feeling that I had little to no choice but to shut the thing down and move on to the next offering in the queue.

Sorry, but not even Aaron Eckhart's usually strong presence was enough to salvage this shipwreck: I actually got more enjoyment out of watching ""BATTLESHIP""... now that ought to make you nervous.",1430438400,,1993,4.527777777777778

All right, Lockett. You wanna go there. Let's go there. I commanded men and men died. Kids. 19 years old. The best men I ever led. Do you think for a second I wouldn't rather trade places with them? I know you think I got my men killed. They're dead. I'm here. Like the punchline to some bad joke. You think I like that? Do you think a minute goes by that those faces aren't right here
[points to head]

President Thomas Whitmore: It's a fine line between standing behind a principle and hiding behind one. You can tolerate a little compromise, if you're actually managing to get something accomplished.

George Beckworth: Petersen, what was all that talk about the enemy building ladders and coffins?

Sgt. Petersen: Well, when Charlie knows he's got a nice box to be buried in, he's just as brave as hell.

George Beckworth: What about the ladders?

Sgt. Petersen: They throw the ladders across the wire to get at us. And later on, they use them for litters to stack on and carry away the dead bodies.

George Beckworth: Later on... you mean after everybody's dead?

Sgt. Petersen: Yes, everybody. Men... women... and children. Everybody.

4468211,5,B004ULEEY8,"Good solid sci-fi / action / war movie, can't believe I missed the theatrical release.

Do you know WHY critics panned this film?  Because it was patriotic, because the good guys win, because America was victorious!  There was none of this shades-of-grey, emotional hand-wringing, psychological soul-searchng introspection garbage -- just pick up a mother-effing gun and kill some aliens!  We didn't try to ""talk"" to them, we didn't send in then-Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton to seek a diplomatic solution.  The Marines weren't sent to Alien Cultural Awareness training  or given a 20-page booklet covering the Rules of Engagement, they went in to take care of business.

The brutal combat action sequences had the look and feel of Blackhawk Down; the depiction of the aliens, their weapons and ships were reminiscent of special effects used in District 9; and some elements from Independence Day.

The basic storyline was simple and uncluttered with irrelevant character-development, eye candy sex, love stories, car chases and similar filler baggage.  The bulk of the film was gritty scary urban warfare that was realistic but with minimal gore, except for the impromptu alien autopsy performed on a concrete floor with bare hands and a K-Bar.

Can't help but think this film was really an allegory for the Iraq / Afghanistan war -- only this time America was allowed to actually win!  Although this film was released long before the infamous 9/11 Benghazi attack, it was kinda eerie watching a scene showing Marines sacrificing their lives trying to use a laser target designator to direct a laser-guided missile into the alien control center ship.",1421020800,4,1657,5.164794007490637

The characters may not be full developed, but neither are they generic or faceless. I would have to agree with those who say it borrows a few ideas from other films (e.g., the LAV running over aliens instantly reminded me of a scene from James Cameron's ""Aliens""), but there are also plenty of fresh ideas to be found in the film (e.g., the design of the drones). One thing that did puzzle me, though, was that near the end of the movie, when the troops are approaching the aliens' command asset (aka command-and-control), they go underground in the dark of night at 1 hr 35 min, and emerge into broad daylight at 1 hr 37 min., despite the fact that the action seems to unfold in real time.

4468271,4,B004ULEEY8,"Actually, I liked the movie; it was a good alien-invasion action shoot-'em-up. After all,
I DID give the movie four stars.

However, I do have one nit to pick. Supposedly, the aliens' reason for invading Earth
is to harvest the planet's water. Well, that doesn't hold water (I couldn't resist). Water
is one of the most common compounds in the universe. If the aliens wanted water,
they wouldn't have needed to enter the solar system, much less invade Earth and be
bothered by pesky humans. All they'd have to do is investigate the Oort Cloud, which
is between 5,000 and 100,000 astronomical units (1 AU = average Earth distance
from the sun = 93,000,000 miles) out from the sun and snag themselves one or two
comets, a large part of which consists of water ice.

Another advantage would be that the aliens wouldn't have to expend energy maneuvering
within Earth's - or even worse, the sun's - gravity gradient. I know, one might speculate
that anybody capable of interstellar travel would have plenty of energy to spare. But why
would someone - even an alien starship captain - use up energy when there's an easier,
cheaper way?",1413072000,,1129,4.725888324873097

4468313,4,B004ULEEY8,"Really a 3.5. It's a very entertaining action movie with a good cast but there is nearly NO character development.

The movie is like a Call of Duty game, you're dropped right into the middle of the action with a little background provided through flashbacks throughout the movie and only Aaron Eckhart's character provided any back story at all and it's not much.

It's an pure action flick, if you're looking for a deep intellectually stimulating, thoughtful or deep movie you're off to a bad start looking at a movie with a marine standing in front of a burning LA and this is definitely not your movie. Citizen Kane it is not.

This movie is a great, easy to follow and fairly mindless but very entertaining action movie. I like all sorts of movies and found it to be well worth the money to watch. The effects are seamless and extremely well done, there isn't many moments of fridge logic or terribly implausible action (Of course, that is aside from the obvious fact that it's a movie about an alien invasion.) They packed about as much action into the movie as could possibly be done and just enough story to provide believable motives behind the characters actions but not much else.

The downside is you also don't care much for them. I barely even noticed when someone died because most of them were basically faceless red shirts and for as long as the movie is, a little more rising action would have been nice. In one sense, it was neat to be dropped into a tense and unknown situation alongside the marines just as they are in the movie but it also can come across as generic.

Bottom line, it's an imperfect movie and certainly has it's flaws but it's a very entertaining movie that's as straight forward as it can be with some great visuals and excellent use of effects. Independence Day without the Will Smith vehicle parts. As a plus, your drunk friends will have no problem figuring out what's going on.",1406419200,,1921,4.5726744186046515

This movie _is_ about aliens who get their butts whooped, but the alien tech is very good and otherworldly while being close enough to our own military development cycle that you can easily suspend disbelief and see how they might work, and imagine how close to them, yet just out of reach, for our own weapons development. There are definitely echoes in their weaponry reminiscent of the concurrently developed Battleship . But this is also about Marines. These guys are regular people who didn't sign-up for this, they're largely unprepared for what they're fighting, they're scared, but they do what Marines do : Stand tall, take the hits, and try to adapt. I really liked that these Marines were not portrayed like some gung-ho plastic-bombastic indestructible killing machine-dudes - these guys fight, the get hit, they bleed, and they die. War is hell, and they don't try to make war with aliens look like a video game. There are real human stories in here too: A rushed wedding, an old-timer who decides he's passed his best-by date and dreading retirement, a rookie who's got no idea where his butt is yet with buddies who try to get him drunk and laid before he deploys first time, people being a little like jerks to each other then getting straight-faced when things go FUBAR; military scrambling to figure out what to do and how to do it, and getting hit hard by superior forces they aren't equipped to fight. Heroes - the platoon/squad we follow are believable as individuals with real-life issues, but more importantly they respond the way many real military people respond, with fear, heart, grit, and the knowledge that if they run away, there's no-one else to hold the line and everyone dies. As I watched I wondered if the actors had spent time with the Seals who'd done Act of Valor - not because those Seals were great actors, but because they were real military and not primped-out actors, and it showed in the way they told the story. So, beyond all my expectations, I really like this movie. Don't let the critics put you off. If ID4 had been made this way it would have been an awesome movie instead of how it worked out. Buy this or rent it, but watch it more than once because this is a great movie with a lot more depth and richness to the characters and the story-line than you'll catch in one action-packed sitting.",1400457600,,2628,4.629550321199144

The true account was/is that something was over the U.S. west coast during  World War 2 and to this day, we do not know what it was/is. While America was in a state of war, the U.S. government figured it must be a new Nazi airship of some kind and gave the orders to shoot it down. You guessed it! We hit it with everything but a nuclear missile and I mean EVERYTHING other than nukes or chemical/biological weaponry, AND NOTHING WORKED. It flew away and never fired back and has not been seen since. The movie capitalizes on the true event and turns it into an all-out war planetwide!

4468358,5,B004ULEEY8,"I feel this is one of my better entertaining flicks.
It got some bad reviews, but they weren't mine.
I've watched the movie probably ten times which I cant say for most.
If it were up to me, it would be up for some awards.
We are paradoxically in between a movie fad of aliens and paranormal events, and the real deal.
If Y2K didn't get your attention, or 12/21/12, or comet Ison, then give this a try.
The movie industry has allot to offer, even though I like to read. You have to decide for yourself whats worth sitting down in front of for a couple of hours that you'll never get back, and just might repeat that expenditure,
and not let a critic tell you. Otherwise just sit in front of the TV and get programed by the subliminal
big brother.
I also like Battleship, another alien invasion flick. These two movies are an example of how
new faces can make alternate viewing a breath of fresh air. Not too spooky, not too dull. Battle LA is action packed from scene to scene and you don't know whats going to happen next. excellent use of smoke to make it real when the music is working on your anticipated fear. Your eyes cant see through it (the smoke) enough to see it coming, yet not so much that you don't bother leaning into the view of the screen to try to see whats really there. You won't root for the aliens in this one, but you'll be very satisfied with what the USMC does and you'll be glad you weren't one of them either.
Bring a drink and snack to the couch, you won't be getting up in the middle of the show, you won't be pausing it, not even on the 4th viewing. Each time you watch it, you'll pick up on another detail you missed before. I think that's what a good movie is all about. If you want gore and R rated scenes, get something else.

4468407,3,B004ULEEY8,"Battle: Los Angeles centers around a squad of Marines as they are sent into Los Angeles to fend off alien invaders who have taken other major cities across the globe. The movie is incredibly simplistic in its delivery of the story, and sadly, it's too simple.

Battle: LA is an entertaining, ""popcorn"" movie, as some people call it. There are no deep meanings, no in-depth story-lines, just a simple tale about Marines fighting a highly advanced race of alien creatures on American soil. Now, I'm not bashing the movie, I'm merely pointing out areas where they could have improved on to make this an actually great movie overall, instead of purely entertainment purposes. First, the script. The dialogue is extremely cheesy and is something you would see in a direct-to-DVD movie (not all direct-to-DVD movies are bad, but most have terrible scripts). The plot was filled to the brim with cliches, and the characters were static; no dynamic shifts whatsoever. The visual effects, in areas, went from amazing to just God-awful. Then, there's the directing; Jonathan Liebesman tried to make it like a Bourne-esque documentary style movie, and it failed, as the ""shaky-cam"" ruined many of the shots. Lastly, the rating. No matter what, if you are going to make a hardcore war movie, make it a rated R movie. There's not a single war movie that is PG-13 that has as much action as this, or as much violence. Example: Saints & Soldiers, a PG-13 war film, had less violence but was more graphic and realistic with it, and had a well-written script. Now, Battle: LA did have great acting from Aaron Eckhart, and a good, patriotic and bombastic musical score, but ultimately fell flat.

It's an entertaining, mindless sci-fi action movie, and if you want to see it with amazing picture and sound, i highly recommend the 4K version; looks absolutely crisp and clear. I hope that, for the sequel, they get a different writer or writers, and a different director.

If you still want to watch this, I suggest skipping the first 20 minutes.  They're entirely unnecessary - it's like a race to hit every action movie character cliche they could think of, from the grizzled sergeant who's two days from retirement to the buck private who's about to get married to the brash young rebel who doesn't respect your authority.  The rest of the movie just rises to the level of mediocre, with a roughly equal balance of adequate action and tedious moments.

I'd honestly be fine with all the cliches and the extraneous shaky-cam (During scenes where it's just two people sitting and talking? Really?) if they weren't constantly combined with an overwrought, super-serious score. The music in every scene of this movie seems to be saying, ""These people are HEROES, America!  They are dying for your sins!""  I'd be okay with that in, say, Flags of Our Fathers, but it feels ridiculous in a movie about shooting guys in rubber bug-man suits (or their CGI equivalent).

4468464,5,B004ULEEY8,"Critics evidently dismissed this movie as just another war flick. And perhaps it may seem such. However, for me, there seemed to be more substance here than the typical product of the Hollywood machine. Perhaps it partly due to Aaron Eckhart's acting, who plays a strong example of a man; of gentle strength, sacrifice, and leadership. Or perhaps it was the dignity with which humanity is treated. Amid total chaos and destruction, humanity is not lost; goodness, compassion, loyalty (as for example, when civilians die; the main characters actually show distress over the loss of life. Here, death is treated with more reverence than is typical in Hollywood. The main drama, in fact, revolves around the commander's apparent abandonment of his men).

The poster/cover for this movie was really all I needed to want to watch it - along with the fact that I was able to see it for free, I made that happen. From this point forward, however, let it be known that I would never recommend this movie to anybody unless they could also see it for free.

Alien invasion movies are to science-fiction cinema as vampire romance novels are to the Young Adult book industry. There are so many of them that 90% get washed out with all the other trash that is poor film making. There just isn't much to be said anymore about aliens that come to earth to destroy us for our resources. Survival Sci-Fi just doesn't cut it anymore. The formula is always the same. Aliens find us > Aliens want our water/air/whatever > Aliens kill lots of people > Sometimes we win, sometimes we don't. Boom! There it is.

The secret to success for these kinds of films is to throw a wrench into the machine so that it will explode in our faces. Something different, but relate-able. War of the Worlds (2005) - focused on family and becoming a better father. Cloverfield (2006) - Home video journal of what happened to very ordinary people (a la Blair Witch). Signs (2002) - rebuilding faith, along with the sense of seclusion from the rest of the world. These are wrenches that successful brought more credit to the alien invasion backdrop. Battle: Los Angeles` wrench was to follow American troops through the nasty, scary reality of battle for the protection of the weak. Did it work?

I have to say that with the heat of the war in the middle-east this concept was a sure-fire for getting people into the door. Everybody loves our troops. Only once you're in and through that door, none of the finished product really delivers. All the elements are there: Background stories of these great men and women, a view of the sacrifices they make for civilians and their families, the humanity and dreams of each one. It should be enough to keep us hooked and attached. It should be enough to make us care. It should work to make a decent film, but...

...well, let's just come out and say it. This isn't a good film. Not even close. It's actually a pretty terrible film.

For starters, let's go to the characters and background stories. In any good story, there are good characters. And for any good character there is a good background. The characters in Battle: Los Angeles have potentially good backgrounds and all seem like characters I might care for - but there are about 25 of them. No joke. The first 30 minutes of the film were spent showing little snippets of each one's current story, trying to shove in as much background possible in the 60 seconds that were spent on each individual. Before any action even took place, I was already telling myself that there was no way I'd remember did what or cared about whom, let alone names. Combine this with the 2/3 Rule of any invasion movie (as in 2/3 of all your characters are pretty much sure to hit the dust) and you're looking at a really low interest value for your characters' development.

The effects are good, but the creature design and action choreography are horrid. Sure, there are guns fired and lasers and buildings blowing up all over the place, but the renditions are really very poorly mastered. We're talking - and yes I'm going to say it - Syfy Channel poor. Despite the big budget and high potential for some real bad-A action sequences (who better to show up the aliens than the military?) much of the luster was lost in the underwhelming attempt of making the soldiers seem real. I understand that the director was going for a more emotional approach, but the result was a platoon of uninteresting soldiers whose names I don't remember running around without taking any initiative. Yes, if aliens really invaded, we'd be screwed. No, the military is not a club of super-heroes. But still...

It occurred to me while watching this film that we really love to think of ourselves as the good guys. What easier way to look at ourselves in a good light than to have somebody else be the threat we're fighting against. ""If aliens came to earth, we'd be like to Indians to Columbus,"" they say. Why is it always like this? Aliens need water, so the assumption is automatically that they are going to kill us right off the bat? Found planet, has water, enter orbit and destroy. It makes me wonder if man was the first into space and looking for new worlds, would we automatically destroy what we found without first attempting diplomacy or type of communication first? Of course not because we're the good guys, and even though they have greater technology and understanding of the universe, they wouldn't understand anything closely related to diplomacy.

Where have all the good writers gone?

When evaluating or thinking about all the elements of this film, there is no way I can give it a good rating. The heart is there, but the execution is not. Bad camera work, poor plot-line and character development and, while Aaron Eckhart does a good job, most of the acting is only slightly above mediocre. No amount of sentimental value toward our troops will push us beyond those flaws, unfortunately. The wrench was thrown, the machine crunched it up and spit it out.",1370563200,,5276,4.615138592750533

4468554,3,B004ULEEY8,"No one will ever accuse BATTLE: LOS ANGELES of being a good movie.  It has very little on its mind and accomplishes even less.  It's a simple story:  the world is under attack by aliens who have landed on the coastlines of major cities around the world and begun to lay waste to everything in their path.  Los Angeles is crumbling and the air force intends a HUGE airstrike on the city, in the hopes of laying waste to the aliens...and little of the city will be left standing.  A group of marines is sent in to rescue a small group of civilians who are holed up in a police station.  They have 3 hours to get in and back before the bombs start falling.  Things don't go smoothly.

That's all you really need to know.  The movie is mostly a sequence of one war-like action sequence after another.  There is virtually no time for character development, except for some pretty lame sequences early on that let us learn about one thing about each of the marines we're going into combat with.  Aaron Eckhart is the ""elder statesman""...a staff sergeant who has just turned in his retirement papers.  Eckhart is a good, stolid actor.  Very suitable for the role of a marine, and even though we know little about his character, we are okay with the persona that is Eckhart himself leading the film.  Other known faces pop up: the most successful is Michelle Rodriguez, who is always a bundle of energy and certainly convinces as a tough-as-nails soldier.  Bridget Moynihan and Michael Pena, on the other hand, are bland and their recognizable faces wasted.

The special effects of the film are largely competent and the battle scenes are convincingly jarring.  This is a PG-13 movie, so although the cinematography is trying for SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (or even BLACKHAWK DOWN) cinema verite (what war movie hasn't tried to replicate RYAN?), the rating ensures there are no guts and little blood, even as combatants drop like flies.

The most problematic parts of the movie are the questionable military tactics.  This group of marines consistently makes decisions that seem little better than the decisions teenagers make in slasher movies.  There's just random running about.  This is not to say the marines don't act bravely...but the strategy of what they are doing is sketchy and doubtful.  Their moves lack precision.

Then there is a scene about 2/3rds in that requires Eckhart to make a heartfelt speech about his time serving in Iraq and the men he ""left behind"" there.  It's meant to be stirring, no doubt, but I was embarrassed at the flat footed timing and the poorly written script.  There was no need for it, and the movie makes the huge mistake of thinking we've invested emotionally in the relationship between these characters.

On the technical side, this is quite a competent movie, and thus, it earns a couple of stars for that.  Script and characters suffer a great deal.  In this case, the filmmakers should have gone with less talk, more action...because the creative team clearly didn't have the skills to write meaningful characters.

4468566,2,B004ULEEY8,"So some meteor showers are hitting various cities around the world, one of these cities is Los Angeles, soon after it becomes obvious the meteors aren't the usual flaming rocks from space as aliens start attacking from the shores and they infiltrate portions of the city. These attacks lay waste to many people, buildings and the military is called into action where Ssgt. Michael Nantz (Aaron Eckhart, ""The Dark Knight"") leads his group in an effort to take back the city and destroy these aliens. I guess this was supposed to be moving to see people dying left and right but there was almost no depth to any of the characters introduced and a lot of the actors seemed to be going through the motions.

The look of the aliens reminded me a lot of ""District 9"" which isn't a good thing in my opinion, the action sequences are pretty mundane and the explanation for why the aliens have invaded our planet is typical and expected. Movies like these are meant to be at the very least entertaining, unfortunately ""Battle: Los Angeles"" comes across like a grittier but poorer ""Independence Day"" knock off without having any of that flicks charm.

Aliens are about the  only safe foe to choose these days for such a film, without raising somebody's  political hackles. I have never (to  my knowledge) seen any of these actors before, but they handle their jobs quite well.  The star is excellent. I can't comment on the verisimilitude of any of the combat hardware ( of our side) but it looked good as did the marine's responses to the tactical situation. There were cliche's,
of course, but that is just shorthand for experienced viewers to insert the appropriate behavior and respond to that rather than to the symbol which represents it. Actually, little time was consumed in such sidebars to the flow of violence (which is what combat is all about),
In sum, I was quite happy to have taken advantage of the skimpy price at which the disc is selling right now.

It's a perfect blend of nonstop action, great story made new and fresh again, and a cast of characters you come to care about and respect within the first 15 minutes of the film.  It is raw and real, which is what makes it so emotionally strong.

Battle Los Angeles is a war movie classic, in my opinion, and far far better than critics and some viewers give it credit for.  I wonder if we were even watching the same movie!  And no one could do the acting job Aaron Eckhardt did as Sgt. Nantz.  Bravo!",1364428800,,561,4.196261682242991
4468590,4,B004ULEEY8,"I hate to quibble over the details but in my opinion this is a sci-fi movie first and foremost and will appeal to sci-fi fans over action fans by a long shot. Sure, there is very little development of the Alien Menace being faced (hardly even a clear view of them). Sure there is a great deal of attention paid to the military aspects of the story. But the constant theme is one of battle against a unique and nearly overwhelming foe.

In any reality based war drama there is always an underlying understanding of who will win and who is the foe. Absent is any suggestion that the end of the battle will be world annihilation. Not in this movie. There is a constant theme of terror of facing an unknown foe. There is a constant suggestion that the battle may be un-winnable.

The attention to detail paid to the military aspect of the story is a deliberate attempt to create believe-ability and allow for suspension of disbelief. Once you believe that Aaron Eckhart is a career Marine nearing retirement and about to lead a team of un-trusting jarheads then you can accept that armored bio-aliens need Earth's water. Such is my opinion anyway.

But to the bigger issue; why all the nasty reviews? Look I appreciate Roger Ebert's opinion more than most and read all his reviews. But if you dislike a genre, how can you ever appreciate seeing it done well. Ebert compares this film (unfavorably of course) to a Classic Western and it's sacrosanct rules of good and evil and the staging of action. What he misses is that sometimes breaking rules creates new opportunities. This movie is something new IMO. I think District 9 fits a similar bill. Independence Day comes close as well but isn't nearly as good. This is sci-fi with a military angle added for realism. I haven't seen World War Z yet but I imagine it will join this list.

Ultimately I own this movie. I have watched it now 5 or 6 times. If you like movies that fare well on a big screen with good surround sound and the lights turned down and if you like sci-fi, give this a try.",1364083200,3,2039,4.473118279569892

4468593,5,B004ULEEY8,"Well, first of all, this is a WAR movie. If you are a sci-fi nerd who is intimidated by all things military, you need to move on. You will not like this.

If you have a latent hatred of the USA(although what other country would allow your sorry, fleshy rear end to continue to live out your ridiculous ""slacker-chic"" life),you also need to move on. So, if you would like to view an excellent war movie with above average acting, fantastic action sequences and not so much foul language that you can allow your 13 yr. old to watch it, you will enjoy this movie.

Sometimes I love them when they're together...but at that point, I'm expecting a large amount of suspension of disbelief, not 'hey, we're marines! And OH! We're fighting aliens!' In this movie, that's exactly what they tried to do, and for me at least, it fell short because of that. I could have done without the aliens while the audience followed the marines on the battlefield--honestly, the story would have done fine without aliens at all, and I would have liked it better. And when it came to aliens...there just wasn't enough of them for me to really feel like they were a threat. Just a target, better equipped, sure, but I just couldn't get into the 'alien invasion' part of the movie. Between that, and the two or three 'false endings' before they got to the real one, it felt dragged out. By the end of it, I had lost focus and was pretty much hanging on so that I'd at least know how it all ended. I felt shell shocked, and not in a good way. They either needed a better balance between war story and sci-fi, or they needed to pick one.

There is a solid story here, and I was pleased to discover that this film held my interest at all times -- something that many films these days fail to do.

4468619,1,B004ULEEY8,"The back of the cover essentially called it a mixture of Independence Day and District 9. Independence Day was enjoyably stupid and idiotic, and can be considered a good old popcorn flick. Battle: Los Angeles is too generic and boring to be enjoyable.

District 9 is ugly, prententious and derrivitive. There's nothing in Battle: Los Angeles that is remotely close to being as ugly or pretentious as District 9, and yet it's even more derivitive than District 9 was.

Acting is irrelevant as there's no character to speak of. Unless you're a die hard fan of Aaron Eckhart in Two-Face Mode of acting and you'd like to see him in military uniform. I'm not.

There's no plot to speak of beyond the mere premise that aliens are invading Los Angeles and only the United States Military can stop him. Sounds like Battleship and Act of Valor, only all the scorn directed towards the latter ought to be transferred over to Battle: Los Angeles as sheer indifference instead (FYI: Battleship was dreadfully boring as well). And there's no point in talking about the techniques of the film because doing so would be irrelevant.

Derivitive, boring, and completely worthless. Many, many people rank this movie as one of the worst films of 2011. Alas, it deserves the low scores it gets, but none of the extreme venom. It's worth more time forgetting the movie and doing something productive--like playing Pokemon like I did during the movie last night--than it is to despise it. Think of it this way: If I could rate it a 0, I would.  But it doesn't deserve a place on my 10 Worst Films of the Year List.

The worst crime an action movie in general can commit is to be boring (though there are exceptions where the crimes can be more severe; Looper, anyone?). And this film is a violater of that crime.",1359244800,,1790,4.64873417721519

The film follows the experiences of a small group of Marines (from the same regiment as Eugene Sledge of `With the Old Breed' and `The Pacific' TV series as it turns out) who are sent to rescue some civilians trapped in the `infestation zone'. As others have written, it is mainly a war film but the Sci-Fi element utilises some of the aspects of horror films too. It was genuinely tense at times and the camera work emphasizes the grit, dirt and violence of urban fighting. There are plenty of explosions and not everyone makes it out alive. There's not a lot of time spent on character development and it's hard to believe that real marines would engage in some of the exchanges that take place. Some of the visuals are fantastic!

The aliens always have some sort of weakness that can be exploited, fortunately -- something that I suspect will not be the case should anything like this (unlikely though it might be) actually happen.  But it's the weakness of the individual aliens that perplexes me somewhat.  Initially, they seem virtually indestructible; then it's determined that they do have weak spot; after which they are picked off relatively easily even though most of the nearly-continuous shooting on the part of the Marines does not appear all that precise; then toward the end one of the character feels the need to remind some of the others where weak spot is.

4468651,3,B004ULEEY8,"Battle:Los Angles(released Mar/11)stars Aaron Eckhart as USMC SSgt. Michael Nantz,Michelle Rodriguez as USAF TSgt. Elena Santos,and others as part of a Marine division from Camp Pendleton,who must defend L.A. from an alien invasion:the last bastion of defence on the west coast. While the movie sure is a promising one in idea,in execution it fails to deliver the goods. There are some tense moments,but they're confined to a very specific section of the film,and what one finds is before and after to be a let down.
The plot involves Sgt. Nantz who is due to be retiring after 20 years on the job for his country. However,the next day,what appears to be a shower of meteorites into the oceans off of many major coastal cities,turns into our worst nightmare. The press of course are all over it and we see innocent civilians being killed on a beach as an alien attack force comes ashore. A forward base of operations is established at the Santa Monica airport,from which Sgt Nantz is now commanding a small squad of soldiers to rescue anyone still alive at a police station in a hot zone that has been established. In fact it is this hot zone,a section of the city leading to the waters edge,that is slated to be carpet bombed at a predetermined time. Nantz's squad,therefore,is on a strict timetable to get everyone out and back into the safety zone before the bombs drop.
Nantz and company's progress through the streets is slow and tedious. They have met no resistance,and they're within a short distance of the police station. Suddenly all heck breaks loose as the company has been led into an ambush,as the aliens have the rooftops to their advantage. It is now a game of survival,along with meeting their objective. They finally reach the police station,hold off the aliens there,then regroup with forces stragglers and civilians,and hop aboard a commandeered bus back to safety. It is not going to be an easy trip,as along with ground alien forces,there are alien airborne hostiles and they are homing in on any radio transmissions that are sent out.
The groups bus is stopped just short of their goal,and from here they must battle a serious group of alien forces to get out of the area,with the clock,of course still ticking on the bombing. Their group,now decimate down to a paltry few,finally make it out of the zone and brace themselves at the appointed time for the bombing to start;but nothing happens. When they reach the airport they find out why;it has been strategically taken out by the aliens. Nantz learns of an alternate evac zone and takes his people there. A helicopter arrives and they fly away. However Nantz looks down to see a rather large area of the city blacked out. Nantz believes this is the aliens command post. He orders the chopper pilot to let him repel off the chopper and recon the area. His gung-ho attitude by this time has spread to what is left of his squad and they all repel down with him. It turns out he HAS found the alien terminus and the aliens become aware he has. A huge alien ship slowly rises from the ground and attempts to leave. Nantz and company radio in that that they will laser target the craft for incoming missiles. The alien ship is successfully taken down and all alien activity in the area ceases. Back at base Nantz and his men are told to rest up but Nantz gears up once again for more action,as does his squad.
The film is shot in a you-are-there style,with alot of camera movement and fast lens focusing. The film makes the most of it in the section of the film where Nantz and company enter the hot zone,winding their way to the police station. This is when the film finds itself at its best,fighting the aliens up close and personal. But in the lead up to this and the time afterwards,I find the film settles back and coasts along,not generating much excitement. The filmmakers took great pains in acquainting us all with tactics forces personnel would use,and do use,under such circumstances;a little too much. We are with the soldiers themselves for a good part of the movie,and,like them,are never in on the bigger picture of things,until they are. This works against this film and doesn`t generate the sustained excitement it needs throughout the picture. Also the only time we really see an alien up close and personal is with the ``autopsy``scene. Otherwise the aliens pretty much keep their distance and mimic combat tactics the humans are using,of course with a different technology,making the,in the end,far less intimidating.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and looks clear and crisp. Extras include four featurettes on the movies making.
All in all a lacklustre film from all standpoints. The aliens themselves are interesting but the filmmakers chose to have these things using human like tactics in fighting(which makes them less threatening)and the camera technique of a you-are-there feel only works,in the long run,against the film. Take it or leave it,it`s up to you.",1350864000,,4982,4.794186046511628

4468660,2,B004ULEEY8,"I didn't 'hate' this movie. The concept was there, but it could have definitely been much better.

I started watching this movie without reading any descriptions or having any clue of the storyline.

That being said I assumed it was a human conflict movie. I did not realize it was an alien invasion movie.

The movie starts off pretty quick with you finding out it is aliens that are invading. I'd say about 10-15 minutes in.

After that its 2 hours of a group of american soldiers dodging an astronomical amount of enemy shots.

How any of them are eluding the onslaught of alien projectiles is beyond me. It took away from the realism.

Also, because of this account, it made the aliens seem unintelligent, which in turn didn't make you feel uneasy seeing them.

It was more like 'oh boy...there goes another dumb alien.'

I felt more uneasy watching the movie Signs, when the alien ran past the window for 2 seconds near the end.

The movie seemed forever long and I found myself longing for the end to come after investing some time into this movie.

Also, I didn't feel a connection to any of the characters. So whenever a character died, as dramatic as they were trying to make it seem, it wasn't.

I feel they definitely could have made this movie shorter and it would have helped make it a better movie, but it was too drawn out.

As I said, I did not HATE the movie per say. But it is not one of those movie where I feel the need to ever see it again.",1346889600,,1461,4.350553505535055

While watching this movie I could understand why these men get traumatized. They see their friends be killed & they do not have the time to grieve for them. I think the end can be taken different ways - they go back into battle to help fight or they don't know what to do now that they made it to camp.

cliche, but the whole thing surges along with such power that you scarcely have
time to think about that. Also, with so many soldiers and so much action, you

There are a few equipment issues, such as M4s changing to M16A4s and back again or UH-1D Huey helicopters standing in for UH-1Ys, but the thing that stood out was the sterility of the language (i.e, the lack of ""colorful metaphors""): only one (1) F-Bomb was dropped during the entire movie. If these were real Marines, soldiers, sailors, or airmen, ""colorful metaphors"" would abound and the ""f-bomb"" would be used in ways that one would not think possible ;)  Other than that, it is a good action movie and if I had to give it a letter grade, I would give it a solid ""B+"".

It was intense and realistic enough that it knocked on the door of the old PTSD, but it was awesome enough to keep me watching. Responses to previous critics: repeating phrases (move! move! , etc.) is common military practice to ensure everybody gets the message - there's no time for ""sorry, what did you say?"" in combat. And putting Starship Troopers or Independence Day in the same box as this movie is ludicrous - this movie followed a realistically depicted Marine unit repelling an invasion, while Starship Troopers' military was nothing but bad Hollywood cliche, and Independence Day's actual military battles were all completely unrealistic air strikes and most of the movie didn't involve combat of any sort. So this movie used a lot of standard tropes - big deal! They're standard because they sell movie tickets. This is an awesome movie for fans of real modern war flicks like Black Hawk Down or Jarhead.

Don't get me wrong, the visuals are pretty cool, and there's a range of behind the scenes goodness that isn't boring to sit through.

4468677,1,B004ULEEY8,"The movie starts with Staff sergeant Nance retiring after a 20 year career in the military before being brought back to deal with an alien invasion. We learn that some of his men had died on his last mission and he feels guilty. Knowledge of his failed mission makes the other marines he encounters question whether or not he values the lives of his men. Since it is not that unusual for marines to die in battle, I wrongly assumed that later in the movie they would reveal that Nance had made a big blunder in leadership for the marines to treat him like a pariah. Nope, all that is ever revealed is that people died. After making a long winded, uninspired speech about how much it haunts him that his men died, he wins over the softest group of marines in movie history, and they discover the secret for defeating the enemy; shooting at their communications ship.

Every time someone dies they stop the action to play the sad music and show the pained expressions of every character in the film. There is plenty of time to do this while a battle that has destroyed most of Los Angeles is being waged.

For those who watch the behind the scene footage, the cast does it's best to convince us this is a ground-breaking movie because never before have we seen a military movie with aliens (Yep, Independence Day, Starship troopers, etc do not exist in their world). They also try to convince viewers that a hand-held camera style movie with big effect shots is revolutionary. It borrows so much from movies like Cloverfield, Saving Private Ryan, and the 2004-2009 Battlestar Galactica that it is difficult to find something new in this movie.

The characters are so poorly developed that it is difficult to care when one dies.

The aliens are unimaginative mechanical contraptions. No matter how many times the Marines get attacked from rooftops, they seem to think it's a good idea to march down the middle of the street. The aliens have a centralized command center and they stupidly leaving it hanging in the air to assure that it will be an easy target. Aaron Eckhart seems to have learned how to act by copying The Batman's deep whisper while Eckhart was playing Harvey Dent.

Things I liked: pundits on talk shows speculating about the reason for the invasion when they have no idea what they're talking about; cool alien battle vehicles; lots of explosions. There are some good visuals here. The story follows a predictable formula but it's a reliable formula, making this sort of a fun, guilty-pleasure type movie. You might want to watch it with the sound off; otherwise you'll start thinking about the story and asking, repeatedly, ""Why did that happen?"" 3 1/2 stars.",1333152000,,1123,4.788659793814433
4468683,1,B004ULEEY8,"The movie did not play. When I contacted goHastings, they said they cannot replace it because more than 30 days passed. I thought they stood by their products. I was wrong. I will look for other retailers next time.",1332201600,,215,4.538461538461538
4468684,4,B004ULEEY8,"I bought this because my husband really wanted to see it after watching the trailer.  I'm not a big fan of shoot-em-up movies...whether they are westerns, crime movies, or war movies...but I have to admit this one was good enough to keep even my attention through the end of the movie.

The movie is supposedly based on a ""real"" story about aliens that attacked Los Angeles in the 1040s.  The first part of the movie sets up the storyline which explains that a platoon of marines are risking their lives to rescue some trapped civilians in Los Angeles during this alien invasion.  The remainder 95% is pure action.

If you like action war movies, you will love this one.  Lots of fighting, lots of killing, happy ending.  What is really refreshing is that they managed to make a very realistic movie without all the blood and gore so many movies depend on these days.  Killings are not close up, and even the aliens are only seen at a distance. My husband watched it again the next night with my 11-year-old grandson who liked it as well.  He pointed out that this movie has nowhere near the amount of violence in it that our grandson's video games have.  There are a few swear words (which I'm never thrilled about), but they are very limited and nothing terribly offensive...no ""F"" word (which is where I draw the line).  There are a couple of human-interest stories about the characters, and the movie has just a hint of ""Independence Day"" flavor about it (without the humor).  I won't spoil the end, but you'll know what I mean when you watch it.

All-in-all, it was well worth buying.  I'm not sure where we were when this came out in theaters, but I'm surprised we hadn't heard of the movie till recently.  I guess it didn't win any awards for story or acting, but the special effects make up for anything that might be lacking there.

This set comes with both the regular DVD and the BluRay disks.",1332115200,5,1904,4.523391812865497
4468685,5,B004ULEEY8,"I came here to order another DVD as I have my first I kept from redbox... and its clean and I know how to look for that, but it hesitates and stops then skips ahead. So I will order it again. I am 53 yrs old and my father passed in 2008. He was and probably still is a Marine in heart wherever he is... heaven and in peace. I read some of the reviews. I can see why we can't elect a good president or get away from the very poor educators and the lack of understanding is here in the population of America. Ignorant weak idiot people.
OK... I said where I am coming from... my father was trained at Pendleton I was born nearby and lived on base, and my Grandson 3 now was born on base... when the hell are you people going to be smart before you talk? Know what you are saying? Sure this is a little or a lot hollywood... but the principle, do you know what principles are anymore? The principle is true! These men and women will go this far and do the beyond to achieve. They don't quit. They don't run away... unlike other ground forces in the military.
So... Dad was of the first battalon- first Marines in Korea... nobody knows what that means right? Well look uo WWII in the Pacific or the CHOSIN RESEVOIR in KOREA thousands went in a few hundred came out.
The film is hollywood the 'spirit' of the USMC is absolutely correct and spot on.

4468686,5,B004ULEEY8,"This is one of the best alien invasion movie I have seen. The movie never slows down, out is a very fast paced movie, but you still connect with the characters. Really enjoyed this movie.",1331251200,,187,4.371428571428571
4468687,5,B004ULEEY8,"This is the most realistic movie for showing the relationship between enlisted, nco, and officer I have ever seen. Although I was in the Army for 30 years, I worked with the Marines in Mogadishu, Somalia and I find this movie to be amazingly true to life in the simulated combat scenes. The relationships shown between the marines and the one airman mirror what I saw in the 10th Mountain Division in Somalia.

If you want to see what really happens when soldiers go to combat, this movie shows you. If you want to see a fantasy that bears no resemblance to real life then watch another action movie. Face it, our military join up, for the most part, because they believe in our country and each other. They learn discipline and faith in both the chain of command and each other. If you believe that soldiers do not act like the actors in this film, then please do not join the military and never try to rise above the fashionable self interest that is so evident in our society today.

I find it sad that critics of this movie label it as ""cliche"" or ""stupid"". It takes a real intelligent person to demean the love of ones comrades in war or the ability to see a goal above oneself.

If you want to see why our military win wars, watch this movie. Fiction? I stayed in the military for thirty years so I could see this behavior every day.",1331164800,3,1339,4.348

If you like fast paced and non stop action type movies this is for you. This movie combines REALISTIC marine type genre with OUTSTANDING acting, screen play, plot, costumes, special effects etc... No joke here; this is a gutsy, brutal, suspensful, violent and entertaining thriller.",1329523200,,568,4.989473684210527
4468689,5,B004ULEEY8,"""Battle:Los Angeles"" starts with the alien invaders, then takes you back 24 hours where you actually get to know the Marines, especially retiring Staff Sergeant Nantz. This was the best acting of Aaron Eckhart's career. Bridget Moynihan played the vet's part so well, and actually had one of the best lines in the movie, when Eckhart's character sustained minor wounds, ""[I] only treat animals and aliens."" Then she asked what, ""Retreat?Hell!"" came from, and Eckhart told her the story behind the REAL MARINES who the actors played. They didn't show them getting together at the end, just a report the civilians were safe. However I could imagine nothing less than Eckhart and Moynihan (when the war was over and the aliens gone), taking her niece, her nephew, the orphaned boy, and getting married. This movie took you into an actual combat zone. People died. The platoon Nantz ended up commanding because the officer, with his wife pregnant, died. ""Independence Day"" didn't even come close to this movie in terms of war. You were divorced from the fact the President's wife died, and the only thing you felt good about was the firing of the wimp Secretary of Defense. Michelle Rodriguez actually pulled off her role as an Air Force Intelligent tech Sergent, adding a dimension needed without overpowering the rest of the troops. Eckhart and Monyihan nailed their roles. I love sci-fi, but that wasn't the issue: they provided an enemy that you didn't mind being blown to hell. The focus was on the Marines! I loved this movie more than ""Black Hawk Down"" -- where the only two characters that I had any interest in were Ewan MacGregor and Eric Bana. The rest of the cast of ""Black Hawk Down"" was nominal. I felt like I didn't know any of them except MacGregor and Bana, and even then I felt in this movie that I knew the characters, every one. The officer that dies, leaving his wife to raise their child alone. I felt for the solider with PTSD, who wasn't cleared for duty, except the aliens showed up. He switched immediately into ""war mode"" and did everything right, including sacrificing himself near the end of the movie. I ""felt"" it; his sacrifice would have earned him the ""Medal of Honor"", no doubt. Afterwards, my husband and I had a discussion about what medals and commendations they would earn as individuals who put themselves aside for the sake of their unit. Give Bridget Moynihan her due; she might not have had as much screen time, but when she did she nailed it. This movie is better than ""Avatar"", and that's saying a lot.",1329091200,,2542,4.7274774774774775
4468690,2,B004ULEEY8,"Hollywood actors, upset by alien bullies, dress up like soldiers, go where they shouldn't, give away their positions, waste thousands of rounds, have tantrums, and generally get into lots of trouble before eventually turning the tide by taking out the enemy's space-hog network server.

You sense that a fair amount of money went into this movie, but it's mainly stuff blowing up. The plot and interaction of the 'soldiers' is so unreal that the aliens are more interesting. The dialogue is so trite that my girlfriend got the giggles and annoyed some students sitting nearby in the theatre. The camera tremors are so bad that another good title would be ""JIGGLE: Los Angeles.""

The explosions are convincing. If you like lots and lots of shooting and hollering and very large scale urban renewal, check it out.",1328832000,,811,4.955882352941177
4468691,5,B004ULEEY8,"This movie looks much more as a sequel to ""Blackhawk down"" than another ""War of the worlds"", but this is exactly what I liked in it. When the invasion of Earth begins, the US Marines do not ask many questions about the motivations of invaders or the sense of life in general - they just grab their weapons and start shooting back. And they give a great show!

This is an excellent war movie, picturing modern urban warfare in a series of fights which look much more like battles of Khorramshahr 1980, Beirut 1989, Monrovia 1990, Vukovar 1991, Sarajevo 1992-1994, Mogadishu 1993, 1st Grozny 1994-95, Jaffna 1995, 2nd Grozny 1999-2000 or Fallujah 2004 than the ""classical"" movie fights against alien invaders.

There is a relatively short introduction, in which we get to know soldiers from the Marines platoon we will follow, but after that it is the non stop battle. Action is made of numerous marches and engagements, interrupted just for short stops to regroup, catch breath, drink some water, tend to the wounded and find more ammo. Fighting is very well filmed and looks quite a lot like in ""Blackhawk down"". The gunfights are quite realistic and the Marines are far from super heroes - they use quite a lot of munitions to kill every enemy trooper, they make mistakes, they sometimes fall when running, they get lost in the labyrinth of ruined city, their only machine gun jams in the cloud of thick dust, etc. The butcher bill is heavy and many characters will not make it to the final credits.

Contrary to many other alien invasion movies, in this one the invaders seem to be absolutely desperate and their attack seems to have been hastily prepared and even largely improvised. Frankly, I believe it was a good idea, as it makes the whole plot credible - otherwise, if they have the secret of interstellar flight, why couldn't they just wipe us safely from the orbit (or at least destroy all our significant defence installations)? But clearly they are in an incredible hurry and they had to do fast and with what they just had at hand right now, rather than carefully plot the invasion. Also, alien invaders, their engines and their weapons look really alien - there is almost no similarity with anything earthly.

As for their motivation, at one moment we are told that they are after Earth's water, but that is clearly ludicrous as once you got the interstellar travel technology there is enough water in the space in places where there is absolutely no opposition. Aliens seem however able to use water in ways we still did not discover and as they can bring only a limited quantity of supplies with them, they depend heavily on local water to fuel the invasion. May be it will be better explained in the sequel, if there is one.

This is in large part a one man show, as the central character of Staff Sergeant Nantz gradually takes over the action. This is I believe the greatest role Aaron Eckhart played until now and he is very credible in it. It certainly took a great effort on his part - if you saw him in ""Thank you for smoking"", you will simply not believe that it is the same actor! Michelle Rodriguez, who appears in the middle of the movie, plays the only woman soldier we see in the battle - her character, Sergeant Elena Santos, is an electronic intelligence technician who was separated from her unit and joined the first friendly group she could find. Other actors are also doing well, but their characters mostly follow the leader.

Being very fond of war and SF movies, I must say that I was delighted by ""Battle Los Angeles"" and I certainly hope for a sequel - in fact I would be very pleased if it could become a franchise showing the whole history of this war, until the day we chase this space scum to their home planet and dictate them conditions for surrender!",1328572800,3,3798,4.602658788774003

4468693,1,B004ULEEY8,"I love alien movies. I love disaster movies. LOVE them. All of them. Except this one.

When people say a movie like this is bad, they usually mean the premise is stupid, or the action is just too over-the-top ridiculous to be believable. Which is why when people told me this movie was bad, I was not expecting it to be a boring, incoherent second-year film student project.
The characters are completely uninteresting, the camerawork and shot editing are a total mess, the sci-fi themes are several decades out of date (""They want our water!"") and, I kid you not, FIRST CONTACT HAPPENS OFF SCREEN.

The only thing halfway decent are the special effects. But most of the time (seriously, the overwhelmingly huge majority of the time) is spent on shaky close-ups of the actors' faces during ""dramatic"" and ""emotional"" scenes that, trust me, you will not care about at all... so there are almost no effects shots. And the aliens are basically just guys in body-armor (or whatever) with guns. NORMAL guns. They might as well just be other humans. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but does make me wonder why they didn't just make this a regular war movie. Not that that would have improved it. It still would have been a terrible movie.

And it's not like I don't enjoy a good war movie. It's not like I don't get pulled in by emotional, dramatic scenes. I don't just watch movies like this for the effects and the cheap thrill. I pretty much ALWAYS cry. I just want to make that very clear. I'm definitely the type who gets sucked into the emotional plight of the characters in movies like this. But there just wasn't an opportunity for that to happen with this movie, not even for a few minutes. It sucked that bad.

Again, I love alien movies. I'll give every movie the benefit of the doubt, and suspend my belief through even the most ridiculous action and nonsensical disastrous event, but this is just another kind of bad entirely.

4468695,4,B004ULEEY8,"If I remember correctly this movie when it came out to theaters wasn't very well received.  Not surprised.  Sci-fi is a genre that is sometimes hot, sometimes cold, and war movies without romance are a guy's thing.  And this movie is both of those things: sci-fi by way of war.  Even though the scenario is familiar and people might be thinking ""ID4"" this movie is focused on being more compact.  It follows one man (Sergeant Michael Nantz played by Aaron Eckhart) and one platoon over the course of a day as they make their way through LA with initial confidence in order to rescue stranded civilians and, with each seeming alien encounter, their confidence is eroded as the aliens demonstrate that they are adapting their military strategies; at first they are just a ground force coming out of the ocean but soon they have air support and then unmanned drones via a central broadcasting hub.  These bugs adapt.  And this is what makes this grimy, compact movie more interesting.  This could be a metaphor for a new virus attacking populations; it could be a metaphor for a well-planned war against governments; or it could just be any invading force that is going to give us a run for our money.  The military is played straight and makes our fighting men and women (though vulnerable and being pushed back in the film) look intelligent and sympathetic.  The film doesn't try to make any grand statements about anything really; you can take it for what it is or sprinkle in your own interpretations.  It is well-acted, fast paced, with good special effects and a sustained level of tension.  Going into this one with lowish expectations I came out of this very pleasantly surprised.",1326844800,3,1685,4.752577319587629
4468696,5,B004ULEEY8,I could watch this movie over and over again.  It is action packed and a good watch for everyone.  It is a thrill a minute.,1326585600,3,123,3.88

Not sure well just ask the American Indians or the Australian Aboriginals. Now imagine thoese people really defeating the powers that invaded them, yeh right.

There are a slew of characters all layered with `real life issues' and yet none of them feel even remotely `real'.  They are all empty and soulless and `who really cares' and yet, this film thinks that it is saying something important.  I hate when a film thinks it is saying more than it really is.  This film desperately wanted to be `District 9', or at least capitalize on its success, but it lacked so much of the formers rooted realism.

Fortunately for the good guys the aliens lack one important defense that made the enemy in ID4 a lot harder to defeat. I'll go no further there to avoid a spoiler; let it suffice that the good guys, played by a platoon of Marines, win the day and save the earth.

4468718,4,B004ULEEY8,"I remember seeing a beat-up helicopter in a park near the San Diego Comicon in the summer of 2010 with the name Battle: Los Angeles on it and wondered what kind of movie this could be.  ""Skyline"", the other invasion movie, was pretty bad and so there is no comparison.  Quite an improvement, actually!

First Impressions:  Despite several of the critical reviews I really liked this film.  I brought in the best of past war films, had some decent characterization and did not overdo the whole ""blow everything up"" thing.  It is clearly a ""guy"" movie!

Story:  The aliens have landed under the guise of a meteor shower in 20 areas across the planet Earth.  What arises is a war machine that has troops, air support and a similar communications system as our own, with auto-drones and their version of mini-tanks.  And they're cleaning up Mankind to take our water.
They clearly had never dealt with marines.  Aaron Eckhart plays a retiring staff sergeant, who is haunted by the memories of the men who have died under his command.  As he is making preparations, the invasion begins.  Soon he is redeployed with one of his men the brother of a man he let die!

The good parts deal with the war, the blood and terror of it, civilians standing in the way to guard their land; marines being brave and self-sacrificing to lead the charge.  Sure there were some cheesy lines and the occasional undeveloped character that dies and we don't care, but overall great film!

Cons:  The only thing I did not like were the occasional plot holes, such as one guy was going to get married, a civilian woman was checking out the staff sergeant, and a little boy remained orphaned - and I would have liked to have seen a closure for them somehow.

Bottom Line:  Definitely a film for any military or war buff.  The science fictional trappings are subdued and the story is really about the marines under incredible pressure and odds and how one guy who thought he was washed up rises to the occasion.  Several points may bring one to tears it's really that intense.  Recommended.

DVD:  The DVD I had was poor.  Not even a scene selection and no special features except for upcoming previews of Sony movies.

My sci fi friends like detailed story lines, (somewhat) believable technology type devices/theories, and a little bit of humor helps too. My budget horror flick friends prefer something that scares the poop out of them every few minutes and the less plausible the storyline with moronic characters the better chance to do this (otherwise the movie drags).

This movie is like some idiot in hollywood thought it would be a great idea to give a low budget horror flick director/writer a chance to make a sci fi movie.

None of my friends liked this movie for this very reason.

Sci fi friends found the alien invasion premise and technical weapons/tactics nonsensical and the military characters stereotypical cookie cut actors (not believable). My budget horror flick friends thought the aliens were not scary at all, the human characters boring, and most of all, the movie was a real drag. Having no humor in the movie did not help.

Both groups felt the people who created this movie had no original thoughts of their own and possibly were on crack when they wrote this thing up. Okay, maybe not on crack, but pretty close to it.

Instead, it focuses on one group of U.S. forces fighting an alien invasion into L.A. The whole world is under siege but the tale is mostly kept on said forces with a gritty feel. I was pleasantly surprised that the characters were well developed and had actual back stories with substance. Urban fighting galore. Some really nice action scenes for bloodthirsty types like myself. Aaron Eckhart plays the reluctant leader marine who is just about to retire when the aliens show up. Most of picture was filmed in Shreveport and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, not Los Angeles, as it cut budget costs. An FPS video game was spun from this film. Critics were mixed in their opinions of this film but the Box Office ignored them. It cost $70M but made over $211M. It won't get Best Picture but it's good fun for those who like the genre.

Aaron Eckhart (Harvey Two Face from The Dark Knight) does an impressive job of spitting out ham-fisted dialogue like he really, really means it in a John Wayne type mode. He is the highlight of the whole film. His Marine  Staff Sergeant  headed to the way of retirement may be the only reason you may want to watch this film. Otherwise, the Poor character development and a worn out storyline make this a very forgettable film otherwise.

Charlie's Angels Ramon Rodriguez and Lost's Michelle Rodriquez seem wasted in their supporting roles.

The humans vs Aliens type storyline seem weak. I blame the story, not the filmmaker. However, the film is so gritty that you cannot keep up who is who.

4468731,5,B004ULEEY8,"I was SO impressed with this movie for a number of reasons.  I normally don't go for war movies but I like sci-fi and the blend of 'real life' and 'sci-fi alien invasion' seemed like it would be a good solid entertaining movie.

This went deeper than that.  I must say that the cast, ESPECIALLY Aaron Eckhart, was phenomenal.  They had to have spent a good chunk of time with real Marines to get the camaraderie and dedication to their fellow soldiers down the way they did.

The plot of having aliens invade for our water is fine, it gives an explanation why they'd target our planet, but the movie is really about this group of Marines who are tasked with getting the last civilians out of Los Angeles before they take bombers in to level the alien menace creeping in from the Pacific.

You get a real visceral feel for these soldiers and their committment to each other and duty, that no matter how terrified they are in the face of an unknown enemy with unknown weaknesses, that they continue to dig in and fight with everything they have.

Courage, determination, ingenuity and heart.  They protect the civilians, children and adult, and the best part is that the civilian adults step up to help when and where they can with whatever expertise or skills they have that might help the Marines gain the upper hand and give everyone a chance of surviving the morning.

There is fast paced action, special effects and truly wonderful acting, which makes this a trifecta winner in my opinion.

It will appeal to everyone in your family, although I would caution to pre-screen if you've got younger children.

I think the best thing that can be said about this movie beyond its entertainment factor is the realistic view it gives you of the courage and strength our soldiers have to do what they do for us when battling our own home grown terrestrial evil.",1318464000,,1855,4.590909090909091

""Battle: Los Angeles""
(2011)
------------------------------------------------
This is a very loud movie, with a pretty clumsy script.  Meant to be sort of a sci-fi update of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" with a grunt's-eye view of an alien invasion of Earth, seen from the perspective of a Marine unit sent into the battle zone to save a handful of civilians.  The ""War Of The Worlds"" premise is appealing, but the delivery is leaden - the constant screaming and on-screen mayhem is quickly monotonous and numbing, none of it delivered with the directorial grace that would make it worthwhile. Plus the script is corny and riddled with inconsistencies, such as the indestructible aliens getting easier and easier to kill as the movie goes on.  I watched the whole thing because I'm a sucker for this kind of stuff, but I didn't really enjoy it much and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  I suspect the title, ""Battle, colon, Los Angeles"" was chosen because they thought -- hopefully -- this could be turned into a franchise, with the battles of New York, Paris, being made as sequels. Well, that could be okay f they get more skillful producers and way better scripts.  This one was kind of leaden and uninvolving.  Axton)",1317168000,2,1265,5.086956521739131
4468738,3,B004ULEEY8,"This is more of a war film than sci-fi in the sense that the emphasis is on the military combat scenes, mostly ground combat, and is shot in a hand-held camera way. Although the soldiers are fighting aliens (and I don't think it's a spoiler to reveal that since you can figure it out from the trailers and it's revealed very early in the film) we don't get a lot of info on them, what they're here for, etc. - in other words, the story isn't about them or their relationship with any humans. It's about the fight.

It's also about the soldiers, which the film tries very hard to make us care about. Aaron Eckhart stars as a battle-weary, middle-aged staff sargent, who has decided to retire, but gets pulled into this battle before that comes about. He is the only character that I even remotely cared about, because he's a fine actor, and despite a horridly cliche script, manages to bring some real depth to this character at times. The others characters are nothing more than stereotypes, borrowed from every war script ever written - the cocky just-out-school officer, the soldier about to get married, the soldier whose wife is about to have a baby, the just-out-of-high-school virgin, etc. I couldn't keep them straight, and so I could hardly mourn the passing of those who didn't make it.

I also found myself confused at times, because of the way the film is shot. I know it's trying to capture the chaos of battle, but as a viewer, we still need to make some sense of it, so it's more than simply a video game of fight after fight. I couldn't always follow what they were trying to do, so too often it was just random explosions and yelling to me.

So overall, the 3-stars is for the quality of the combat scenes and the special effects, but I couldn't go any higher than that because of the uninspired writing and confusion.",1316995200,,1834,4.501501501501502

4468744,3,B004ULEEY8,"The alien invasion story of ""Battle: Los Angels"" may remind you of Tom Cruise's blockbuster ""War of the Worlds,"" but Sony Pictures Entertainment's sci-fi action movie looks more like a cross between a war movie like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and a sci-fi action ""Independence Day."" ""Battle: Los Angels"" takes itself more seriously, however, than Roland Emmerich's ""ID4,"" leaning towards realism visually, if not storywise.

In ""Battle: Los Angels,"" a U.S. marine platoon has to fight the hostile aliens from outer space, to rescue the civilians trapped in the Santa Monica area before the Air Force strikes. Aaron Eckhart plays SSgt. Michael Nantz, who is planning to retire, but when meteorite-like strange objects hit the ocean and the global alien attack begins, he is called back into action once again.

After a short flashback introducing the back stories of the main characters, ""Battle: Los Angels"" starts off promisingly, straight to the action. The action seldom stops, which is s good thing, but as the story unfolds, ""Battle: Los Angels"" suffers from a clichd plotline and confusing camerawork. With mostly familiar narrative devices, there are not many surprises as to what happens to stock characters. Also, as we are living in the post-Jason Bourne era, almost all action scenes are shot with a shaky handheld camera, which soon becomes annoying, sometimes leaving you wonder what is going on.

Directed by Jonathan Liebesman (""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning""), the action-packed film is surprisingly gore-free, but the film delivers some intense combat scenes. Sound effects are superb, and visual effects are pretty impressive, especially the flying machines. With more careful choice of camera (less close-up shots, more steady camera), and a better screenplay, ""Battle: Los Angels"" could have been a more engrossing experience.",1316217600,,1854,5.386206896551724

Who did these people have sex with to get this made?  This is Mystery Science Theater 3000 stuff; as much as the similarly-named Battle of Los Angeles that Netflix keeps trying to trick you to rent.  Note: the true measure of the badness here is not the special effects or the production budget.

Throw out everything good about the genre.  Keep all the clichs.  Employ a producer, director, and/or writer whose main hobby has to be playing Call of Duty and who's been robbed the patience they were born with for not only reading books, but just watching entire cut-scenes or intros at the beginning of their video games, because they just gotta go blow some stuff up quick.  Add some really overzealous lighting techs who want to bath everything in solid ""motif"" colors.  That's Battle: Los Angeles.  Heck, I would bet the writing in Call of Duty is better than this stinker.  The dialog is so terrible you just have to see it for yourself to believe.  The news people, scientists, and officials talk like a(n) (possibly aforementioned?) pre-teen wrote the lines.  How on Earth (no pun intended) does this even pass the test audiences?  Is Facebook causing brain damage?  Quick, they're after our water!!!  Cuz, yeah, you know... it's like liquid and stuff.  After seeing this steaming turd, I don't blame the CGI people who worked on it for going off and doing the still mediocre Skyline.  I can see how, in spite of that film's SERIOUS problems, it's still bafflingly superior and they actually did have better ideas that the B:LA 'tards had no interest in using.  They still made the odd repeat misjudgment of opening the film with yet another unnecessary foreshadowing of a cinematic money-shot (take a tip from the porn industry).

As ""Hollywood"" and jazzed-up and pop-cultured (think of a petri dish of infectious mimetic waste) and all around happy-fun-timed Independence Day is, that's practically Oscar-caliber compared to this. ID4 is rather masterfully structured and paced, if you analyze it.  And aside from its last act... correction, aside from Tim Robbins onward (love the guy, hated that casting and how it totally lost its cathartic way after this point), Spielberg's War of the Worlds gave a decent high-drama post-modern, neo-realist whateva-you-wanna-call-it retake on the H.G. Wells concept.  Copped-out on the ending, but it's a Spielberg, after all.  B:LA practically rapes Aliens, Blackhawk Down, District 9, Independence Day, Terminator Salvation, and even first person shooters... it rapes and pillages their content and yells ""HOORAH!"" and says ""Master Sergeant!"" incessantly at every available opportunity until you get to the end and go, ""dude, where's Dude Where's My Car?""  Could B:LA possibly be a worse film?  Not to mention you're left hoping real marines are not this annoying, otherwise it's Please, please find a war and a beach you can send them to get blown up on.  Fast.  From the letters home, they're clearly breeding.  And after all this time we were left endearing to them by good `ol boy Tom Hanks.  Here, they buy the farm and you just cheer.  That has to be some kind of travesty.

I could write and direct a better movie than this with half my brain tied behind my back.  Hit me with a bat so I can prove it.  No, give me the bat.  I'll beat myself with it for spending 2hrs watching this.  Oh... oh... the humanity.

It's always either marines, green berets, etc. Never a bunch of average enlisted personnel from any branch of the armed services.

The blu-ray is great. The picture is second to none. The sound overall is good, although i did find at times the talking was a little quiet but that may be due to my sound setup and not the disc itself.

This had so much potential - a sci-fi thriller about an alien attack on Los Angeles, with a band of hard nuts defending the city - but I got a sinking feeling right from the first words spoken by the characters in this film. The script. My God, the script. Chris Bertolini, the writer...you need to go around your house and destroy every pen, throw out every laptop, break every pencil, in fact get rid of anything that will ever allow you to write again, such is the monumental awfulness of the dialogue in Battle: Los Angeles. There are so many clichs packed into this film that they almost create their own little clich vortex. Every single character in the film talks in a meaningless stream of utter drivel, spouting ""snappy"" gung-ho one-liners that stare utter dullness in the face, and dare it to go one better.

There are some things to admire here, notably the special effects, which are absolutely top notch, and some of the acting is of a good standard...well, as good as it can be when faced with lines like ""When invading a place for its resources, the first step is to wipe out the indigenous population!"" or ""I need you to be brave for me! I need you to be my little marine!"".

Surely SOMEONE in the production team would have been brave enough to call for a rewrite, or for someone to reboot the dialogue? All of it? From scratch?

About the only difference is that a somber Aaron Eckhart replaces a cavalier Will Smith as the primary human assigned to take out the alien invaders.  The movie opens with the invasion already underway but then the film quickly cuts back 24 hours to see the buildup.  These aliens come in like meteorites splashing down initially in the oceans just off the World's populated coast lines.  Evidently the water's composition is the key to their life and power.  After Staff Sergeant Nantz's commander is killed, he must take what is left of his squad along with a few civilians and retreat out of harm's way.  The film is pretty unrelenting in the battle sequences, spared only by a litany of clichs.  The set up is pretty traditional as well.  We have the usual diverse team make-up of various ethnicities, genders and ages.  We know that everyone won't make it out and sure enough you can pretty much pick the order.  Still, the performances are convincing.  And while there certainly is no lack of explosions there is also some close combat as well.

4468768,1,B004ULEEY8,"After much anticipation, finally had a chance to watch this and I had to take it off my wishlist.  It sucked!!  I love scifi movies and love action movies, and I especially love alien-invasion movies, but I couldn't even finish watching this!  I'm one of those people who can't ever miss a minute of a movie, I'll rewind if I look away, and I watch until the credits are done, so it has to be really truly awful for me to not even finish it.  The movie has no backstory, it is difficult to become emotionally involved with the characters, the acting is poor, the lines are clich, and the special effects are bad too.  I like cheesy low-budget movies too, but I think the killer here was that pretty much the entire movie was done in close camera shots.  A key element of science fiction, is to get that sense of the fantastic, and that is near impossible to do without some breathtaking wide shots.  The spaceships are always half-hidden and the movie is nothing but close-ups of people firing guns at shadowy creatures.  It's basically no different than watching someone play a videogame (and the clich lines don't help).  Some influences I saw were /Independence Day/ (of course), /District 9/, and /Blackhawk Down/, all excellent movies.  /Independence Day/ is famous for its breathtaking wideshots of the spaceships, but the reviews I read for /Battle: LA/ praised it's so-called ""gritty cinma vrit style  la /District 9/.""  /District 9 /did gain a lot of notoriety for its unusual cinematographic style, but they had those necessary breathtaking shots of the spaceship.  What we have in /Battle: LA/ is what could have been a really good movie ruined by lack of backstory and storyline (a key component in any of Emmerich's excellent series of disaster movies, including /Independence Day/ and /Godzilla/) and lack of breathtaking visual stimuli.",1314489600,11,1851,4.838095238095238

It is little boring in that nothing much else happens in this movie.  For example, the 'District 9' was interesting because it was an unusual take on alien movies.  The Independence Day had very good special effects and also it was at times funny.  The special effects in this movie are not as refined.

After the invasion starts a platoon is assigned to rescue civilians from attacked zones and bring them into a Forward Operating Base, however when they finally get there they find that it is all destroyed.  They proceed to find the alien Command Control Center and destroy it saving the Day.

4468773,4,B004ULEEY8,"Sequel please.
Although I have to confess, I was worried by the opening.  It starts as a standard issue war movie, a false start as it turns out.  I hate false starts; they're a stale gimmick sorely abused by those who think a shot of action will get us all pumped up for what's to follow.  Unfortunately, when you follow an aborted scene of action with something truly mundane, it has the opposite effect.  Instead of being in the thick of it we're mired down by people with issues, a rocky past, leaders with no experience, a lot of macho posturing, and LOOK, meteors with a sense of direction!
Yes, it's a clich plot and yes, it's riddled with clich characters, so what.  I eventually ended up liking this movie a lot because it was so safe and predictable and I liked the characters that stuck around long enough to tell them apart (most were DOA).  I also liked the pairing of a by-the-book war movie with a Sci-Fi creature feature.  Although I would have liked a better look at the creatures they were fighting.  Maybe they'll do close-ups in the sequel?  I also think they should have stuck with the original title: Battle For Los Angeles.

4468775,4,B004ULEEY8,"In terms of audience reaction to ""Battle: Los Angeles,"" I think it's interesting to look at the breakdown of 5's, 4's, 3's...etc.; at the time I wrote this there were slightly under 50 reviews, and it was the complete opposite of a ""bell"" curve.  Most reviews were positive, with over half of the ratings in the 4 and 5 region.  Then there were over a third of them in the 1 and 2 region...and only FOUR rated it in the middle, a 3.  The audience either loved it or hated it, and...

I really enjoyed it myself.

I thought it had a nice, gritty approach, with the emphasis on a single platoon's encounters with their portion of alien invaders.  Handheld cameras, soot, dirt, grainy shots, chaotic action...it seemed much more realistic than I was expecting.  As one of the interviewed actors said, it was  a war film that happened to have aliens in it.

When  people claim it was like ""Independence Day"" I have to disagree.  Certainly there were similarities, but heck, they're both alien invasion films.  I thought it shared more similarities with ""District 9"" actually; both were similar in technical approaches (see the preceding paragraph), and both emphasized a plot that was about a problem that also happened to include aliens....in ""District 9"" the subject was immigration.

(And I think holding ""Independence Day"" up as a bastion of All That Is Great in Sci-Fi is faulted, by the way.  Really, think about it: almost any individual aspect of that movie was pretty bad: the cliches ran overtime, what with Randy Quaid,  and Judd Hirsch... and what about that ridiculous scene where Will Smith hijacks a helicopter to his old base, where his fiance just HAPPENS to be waiting WITH the President's wife?)

I felt this movie did a fine job emphasizing the smaller, more personal aspects of battle, rather than the grand D-Day approach of thousands of men and dozens of personalitiies.  While Aaron Eckart's character (Sgt. Nantz) had a pretty timeworn problem--in that he was a warrior facing the end of his 'useful' days--I felt he did a terrific job of infusing the role with the hoorah! of the marine, and the characters serving under him came off as authentic as well.  There were hardly any really name actors in this film, and I think that made this more genuine, too.

The action was constant, from the moment the troop helicopter touched down in L.A.  There was almost no let up, and I don't need a spoiler warning to tell you that a good deal of the cast in the beginning of the movie isn't around at the curtain call.  And those that are around at the end look pretty beat up, scraped up, and worn...not like those old movies where John Wayne's uniform wasn't even dirty at the end of the movie.

Special effects were terrific, as one is coming to expect nowadays, and the movie incorporated a pretty solid alien enemy, keeping them hidden and mysterious for a good deal of the film, then letting us in on them bit by bit.  One of the ""meatier"" moments involved probing an alien's body in a scene that goes a good deal further than waterboarding, which I thought would receive at least a little more of a reaction from the general public--it was certainly worse than anything Jack Bauer did in ""24.""  But I guess it's one of those things that we would shout out about were it an enemy soldier who also happened to be human.

Watch this film, and try to think of it in terms or what it is: a war film.  I think you'll like it....I certainly did.",1313884800,4,3459,4.583739837398374

You don't walk around with the scope view on, you only zoom in once you see the enemy. And it is difficult to hit targets if both you and they are moving, even if you have them in scope - you need to kneel with your rifle, stand, lie face down or stabilize it on any object you can find. Google shooting positions. You need to crouch and peek around corners first before entering rooms. You can't rush into rooms shouting ""US marines"", ""US marines"". The soldiers talked and shouted to each other during combat! No scouting, plus they rarely hid behind obstacles... $78m. Get professional soldiers to help advise you.

But it seems bipedal aqua aliens and Lamborghini jet hovercraft once again wish to ravage the earth's natural resources (see Independence Day, Skyline, War of the Worlds, Signs, Mars Needs Women, and Battlefield Earth minus jumbo dredlocked Travolta).  Oh yeah add the movie ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" to your reference list.

Thus the gruff Marine Staff Sergeant (not Clint Eastwood but Aaron Eckhart) with a troubled history seeks redemption and honor by leading an unknown band of soldiers to an area about to carpet bombed in a few hours to rescue stranded civilians. Add in a brand new lieutenant (not Boyd Gaines but Ramn Rodrguez) for stabilizing cordial benignity.

Every available combat aviation and ground scene is evident and the action moves faster than Falluja on steriods. One by one the platoon is whittle away from an unknown deadly entity that slowly starts to reveal itself through out the movie. Then by chance a wounded enemy is found, is split apart to see the inner workings like a beetle. By the end the individuals all have a specialty to overcome the odds. The special effects work in the aviation scenes but not as much in the ground footage, but still provided some favorable moments. This movie also added a subliminal flip role reversal. Instead now the USA is invaded by superior technological army, what are the enemies goals?

At least in this one, the actors aren't sleep walking through their parts.  You've seen this movie before in Blackhawk Down and War of the Worlds with a little Heartbreak Ridge thrown in for character development.  Marines take casualties in an urban setting, torture an alien to find his weak spot, save civilians and then somehow using conventional weapons, begin to save the planet.  For peaceniks this is a trite recruiting film for hairy, war mongering, knuckle draggers. For wargame and war movie fans it's a fun ride.  I really like the characters in this movie. The remind me a lot of the way the real American military thinks, acts and talks to each other.  I wouldn't' have watched this film because it seemed such a trite premise.  But my son, a former Marine officer, recommended it.  I can see why.  The characters here are interesting, the combat scenes are gripping.  The tension between leaders and the lead has a sense of realism.  So while it's a science fantasy with some deus ex machina plot devices, there is an underlying realism to the characters that makes this one more than your usual alien shoot-em-up for me.

Otherwise stick to watching Saving Private Ryan for good war movie or War of the Worlds or Cloverfield for traditional alien/monster mashup. The last sci-fi film I truly adored was Cloverfield - that was a movie that's part of our collection to watch and re-watch. Battle Los Angeles won't make our movie collection. Last time we made a mistake by listening to critics when District 9 came out - we bought the DVD thinking it would be great and it was terrible.

And Michelle Rodriguez, I could watch all day, she's great. Several of the other soldiers also did a great job of acting. The script in places was sophomoric but some marines and army rangers I knew were just like that in real life. The aliens and their weapons were great, the scenes of a destroyed LA was great, and it had a great ending. I look forward to a directors cut with more footage.

It illustrates really well the reason why troops hate urban warfare: the casualties pile up really high and you can't tell very well where the enemy is shooting at you from. The scenes are graphic.

The pro-Marine esprit de corps is high in this movie, which I can understand since many Marines see the Corps almost as a cult. Needless to say, some people got turned off by this either because they dislike Jarheads (understandable) or because the ""sophisticates"" hate the military. Whatever.

Another thing: I can't see why some would compare this film to District 9, which is about apartheid, and why others compare it to Independence Day, which screenplay was apparently written by a high school dropout and a Zionist.

There is a snoozer scene about half way to the middle so be prepared to bring a nite-nite pillow.

The sound effects is what people are referring to as a 5 star movie.

That is 10+.

But as far as a storyline goes, they failed misserably in that dept.  The best thing about this movie is how they took the time to care for civillians!!!! I kept saying ""come on""-  these poor civilans"" are going to slow you down so cut them loose because the Alien dudes were bringing up the bossman unreal tournament gadgets.

What they need to do is make a saucer movie of us fighting the greys, complete with hyperspace and everything. That I'm still waiting for.  Maybe Hollywood thinks you have to blast it all up like a bunch of monkey's would do to sell the tickets.

I guess I should have know what I was in for, but after reading several reviews saying this movie was better than District 9 (which was smart and inventive), I went for it. Mistake. Short story, this movie is big, loud, and dumber than a post. This was by far one of the most trite, contrived, melodramatic, uncreative alien movies I've ever seen. It was almost bad enough to make it into the same category as Starship Troopers, but just took itself waaayy too seriously to fully commit to being a parody. As others have said, it plays out like a video game and I frequently found myself saying ""Here comes the end boss"", or ""Level 3, Objective: secure the police station and rescue the civilians"". In a game it works, in a movie, it sucks. All of the creature movie cliches are here including many versions of the ""is it really dead?"" scene. Heaped on top of that is every military buddy movie stereotype we've seen a thousand times, done here do poorly that I really just wanted everyone to die just so the movie would end. Oh and it's long, dragging on...and on....and onnn....is it really dead yet?...NOPE!

I love sci-fi and it's too bad that Hollywood has to screw it up so thoroughly so often.

The ""aliens""  resemble somewhat the robot character in Terminator, hard to knock down.  The story seems to have been written very fast and with no thought given to allow enough time to a prelude to an earth invasion.  What can I say, the acting is so, so,  the story even worse.

First of all, the trailers give the silly impression that for some reason aliens have decided to set their sites only on Los Angeles and launch a brutal attack on that city. As it turns out, the attack is much more widespread than just LA; but the focus of the movie is on a battalion of Marines stationed at Camp Pendleton that are sent to defend the LA area against that regional attack. The story is told from a military perspective and it worked very well for me.

If you're a gamer and you've played any of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Call-of-Duty/dp/B00269QLH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Call of Duty</a>&nbsp;games,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Resistance-Fall-Of-Man/dp/B000JLIXIG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Resistance: Fall Of Man</a>&nbsp;or better yet both...you should love this movie. Call of Duty = lots of well designed, tactical military combat missions. Resistance Fall of Man = lots of military combat action against aliens. And both of those game descriptions sum up what you get with Battle: LA...with the exception of course being that you get to sit back and enjoy the movie action in under 2 hours versus the up to over 10 hours it might take you to finish just one of the games.

Aaron Eckhart (who I hardly recognized and thought was an odd choice for the role) actually did a great job as the Staff Sergeant tasked with leading his team of Marines into battle. He and his cast turn in some Hoo-Rah!, believable performances. The special effects in the film are terrific and breaks in the action are few and far between. I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish.

I don't see any announcements for a sequel, but the door was certainly left wide open for one considering that the movie focused only on a relatively small portion of a global attack. Oh well, at least I'm inspired to wipe the dust off my old copy of Resistance Fall of Man; that game will keep me busy for a while.

4468816,4,B004ULEEY8,"What if there was a coordinated attack by extraterrestrials on several large cities around the world? Of course, we have seen this story before, and BATTLE: LOS ANGELES tackles the premise again. Los Angeles and the surrounding cities are being destroyed and invaded. Millions are fleeing the city, though it is not clear where they all went and how they got there. A group of marines are sent to Santa Monica to rescue a handful of civilians and then must escape to a safety zone.

It's a simple and basic variation of the same story but yet it was an enjoyable action thriller. It's a study of human nature and of survival. Being from Los Angeles made the movie more interesting..knowing the places mentioned and again wondering how so many people were able to escape on short notice. The streets and freeways are destroyed yet there aren't many bodies. The good citizens got away and now it is time to save the few left behind.

The aliens, their spacecrafts and their drones brings up the question, ""What would they look like and what would happen if they invaded earth?"" Interesting premise. Could this ever happen?",1311552000,,1120,4.7384615384615385

They could have lost the subplot about the Sergeant losing his men in the previous war, which was just a waste of time and a bit silly in the context of this movie.  100,000's of people are dying around them, the sergeant has saved them numerous times, but they are looking at him like he is trying to get them killed almost to the very end.

Certainly B:LA is not the best movie produced, but certainly it is not the Worst either, not even close. Sorry to those reviewers noted above that it did not meet your standards; but what are your standards? If you wanted to see more aliens, there are ""alien"" dominated movies available and there are many video games that would probably suit you better. The acting was not ""bad"" at all;the characters seemingly acted like people rather than actors. That really rubbed you the wrong way apparently. Within a few hours, Earth was attacked by apparent superior technology in limited areas picked for a specific purpose.  The enemy did not have sufficient technology nor apparent personnel to attack the entire Earth at once. How would the reviewers noted above respond to ""aliens"" attacking their houses, with drones/etc and 8+ foot soliders? Like actors or like people under duress in life threatening situations?

I am still constantly amazed by people who choose to pick apart books, movies, etc as if they were completely worthless attempts at entertainment.  Those types of movies and books are out there; apparently those reviewers have never attempted to locate them and obviously haven't been unfortunate enough to accidently view them. I have rated half a dozen movies this year as  1 or 2 star movies. They were far far worse than B:LA, even though only one of them fit the genre: i.e., Battle for Los Angles.  That movie unfortunately lacked what B:LA provided, entertainment.  The Marines in B:LA were not bad either; they acted a lot like.........MARINES.

They put all these cool scenes of an alien invasion all through their trailer to promote the film, but I guess all those aliens that were actually seen in the movie were already seen in the trailer.  The rest of the whole two hour movie was just about men arguing about ""who's in charge here"" and ""what makes you think you're so special? My friend died under your command.""  Oh Geez, blah, blah, blah!  It would have been more realistic if all the soldiers involved were all women with menstrual issues so that the tiresome drama would make more sense about a bunch of women b! tchin' about what they are displeased about of all the questionable commands thrown at them throughout the film. (Forgive me for exaggerating a little bit here. I'm just being a little silly.)

But, this: I'm serious about. There seems to be a new kind of film promotion and end result that continues to prove itself here.  Some film-makers now think: Let's spend a huge chunk of the film budget on a cool movie trailer, and then go cheap on filming the rest of the movie around it.

Boy, this movie was tiresome, dialogue-laden screen fodder!  You just can't count on a cool movie trailer anymore.

From the very beginning you watch those soldiers talking, shouting, running around, and shooting without a target or enemy until 30 minutes later alien robots showed up one after another for a street fight. When you just got excited and thought that the battle finally got started, you are into a rude awakening after the next 100 minutes - the street fight between a dozen LA soliders and invading alien robots is all there is for the Battle: LA - nothing else beyond that, period!

Besides the messy dialogues and characters, camera and editing of this film is both unbearable and embarrassing. Most shots in the film are close ups and cuts from one scene to another or from one face close up to another with each shot/scene lasting less than 1 or 2 seconds. If that doesn't make you dizzy after a whole hour cuts and close ups, the whole film seems to be shot on a shoulder held camera, constantly shaking and moving without ever a still or panoramic shot.

The whole film is a total disaster - no climax, no originality, and no brain - any supposedly serious and solemn moments are so childishly made by cliche or a formula that you can't help laughing...

Talk about politically correct casting and story, one of each and the same old new officer and old Sargent dynamic and not done that well, and the worst is the virgin from the Midwest. We have a blended armed forces, that's realistic but they were just so overt about it, it made it cheesy. Almost a recruitment ad.

Over dramatic for sure. Camera shots hold so we can be sad at the right times, so over done. None of that in Private Ryan so it can be done without telling me when to be sad, shocked etc. Eckhart is fine and likeable in his role, not the real macho idiot, gets things done like real NCO's do. But the back story on him is done once again in a drama queen style, so so overdone. Thought he might be miscast in the previews but did OK. No real problems with the cast at all just executing a lame story. No stupid one liners that I remember. The flying vehicle propulsion was a neat idea that came off realistic and new. Not a lot of explanation on how the alien thing started and that is fine. This is a story about marines going in. After our water? That is ok though. Didn't dwell on things to make it even worse.

The unsteady cam just seemed to be covering for small sets, weak effects, and confusion to mask a weak story. A big negative. Came off as a cost cutting trick. And SO irritating. Put the camera in a box with a small pinhole next time. Might be better. They really need to come up with a new filming style for action movies. Or how about a regular steady shot and a good story.

4468830,3,B004ULEEY8,Another alien invasion'flick for my collection... is a great movie.. look like a documentary... I can't tell you much... you must watch it !!!,1311033600,2,142,4.958333333333333
4468831,4,B004ULEEY8,"It's widely considered that the 10 Freeway is a diabolical freeway, and that's even before the nasty extraterrestrials took it over and laid down overwhelming gunfire on our Marines. BATTLE: LOS ANGELES sure was panned by critics and moviegoers, and you can blame that on the derivative story, the predictable characters, and the cliched dialogue. Except that there are certain shady films for which I'll readily chloroform my inner critic. To me - a sci-fi, apocalyptic, war of the worlds fiend - BATTLE: LOS ANGELES is sheer escapism. I savored the stuff it did right and was magnanimous towards its deficiencies.

Fifteen or so minutes into it, the film plants you in the middle of the global alien invasion - or, rather, the part of it having to do with Los Angeles. There's set-up concerning the media breaking news about clusters of meteors hurtling toward the planet, but we all recognize these for what they are, especially once the military briefer lets out that these meteors are slowing down right before impact. World-weary Marine Staff Sergeant Michael Nantz (Aaron Eckhart) had put in his twenty years and he's ready to call it quits. But there's something so inconveniencing about an extraterrestrial attack. Staff Sergeant Nantz gets tapped for one more mission, never mind that his last one had left him with a shaky reputation. BATTLE: LOS ANGELES charts a day in the life of a platoon of U.S. Marines -  to which Staff Sgt. Nantz is assigned - as they deploy to Santa Monica to evacuate civilians. The caveat is that the platoon has a deadline to do this as the bombs will drop in three hours' time.

In the meantime, Nantz finds himself having to support a newly minted lieutenant who's never seen battle, as well as facing the skepticism of his grunts. Aaron Eckhart is our point of view character and his strong performance gives the movie its much needed grounding. And you can always rely on Michelle Rodriguez - who's solid at playing those tough girl parts - to lend some action hero creds to her Air Force tech specialist.

The film benefits from its gritty documentary-style presentation, and there's an intensity and a visceral vibe to the combat engagements which impressed me, which recall those harrowing opening moments in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. These aliens - bipedal arthropod creatures with chitinous exoskeletons  - wield superior firepower which include laser arrays and aerial attack drones which effortlessly take out our own aerial forces. The aliens' weaponry make our artillery as effective as half-hearted wedgies.

Los Angeles is leveled, and when I say ""Los Angeles,"" I, of course, mean Santa Monica, which is another city altogether. And when I Say ""Santa Monica,"" I mean the cities of Shreveport and Baton Rouge, Louisiana which are masquerading as Los Angeles (or Santa Monica). Whatever. The cityscape is devastated, and one wishes that there were more emotion invested into that. Except that the alien threat isn't articulated all that well. And with the big bad coming off so nebulous, it's left to our Marines to provide dramatic conflict, as if we're not privy enough to speeches about honor and survival's guilt and Ooorah!-all-the-live-long-day.

I won't go into the film's superficial stock characters because there are hardly any stand-outs and most of them die anyway, with me reacting with a shrug to each death. Sue me, the story did not make me care about anyone except for Eckhart's character, and possibly Michelle Rodriguez's and Ramn Rodrguez's characters (Rodrguez plays the raw lieutenant). I'm in it for the special effects - which are top notch - and for the wicked combat scenes. I did like one savage sequence in which the platoon hauled in a wounded alien and tried to find out its weakness. It's an ugly moment because Sgt. Nantz had to basically torture the alien to determine its Achilles' heel. But, in wartime, this is an absolutely critical and practical move. So there's a bit of ugly reality for you. BATTLE: LOS ANGELES isn't as epic as INDEPENDENCE DAY but neither is it as bloody awful as SKYLINE. All in all, 3.5 out of 5 stars.

Shhh. I think my inner critic is waking up.",1311033600,,4156,4.901849217638691

Yes it is nothing new, yes, the CGI is used for all action scenes, and yes they use Marines in the movie. I hope that IF this movie made any money, that it went to feed the costs of our wars because the producers and actors deserve not a dime. The movie was lame and slow. You know how it will end and nothing will surprise you throughout the entire film. IMHO, no originality. There was no connection to the characters or their situations. I ended up forwarding through the movie just to get to the action parts, which were pretty decent, but nothing that will amaze you.

4468836,4,B004ULEEY8,"Overall, I was pretty impressed by this film. There were times that I thought the characters were a little too stereotyped or the dialog a little too cheesy, but all things considered, this was a well done and interesting film.

The setting is earth just as an alien invasion begins; the story focuses on a band of Marines who have to escape and then destroy a bunch of aliens. It's simple and straightforward, and doesn't deviate from that; there are no surprises or jaw dropping moments, but it is exactly what it promises to be. The characters are, in many ways, a whole bunch of stereotypes...the older Marine who is past his prime...the commander who is young and green...the commander whose men died while he made it out alive...etc. But they were handled in such a way that you didn't notice, really, unless you thought about it - in other words, no one stood out as being a stereotyped character. They all just made sense how they were, and made for some interesting team dynamics.

As it was, I thought this movie came together quite well. It reminded me of a sort of modern day take on War of the Worlds, which is pretty cool. 4/5 stars; very well done.",1310860800,2,1163,4.533333333333333

4468839,2,B004ULEEY8,"This movie is a mashup of all of the worst cliches of war movies and alien invasion movies. I tried to sit through it, but just couldn't do it. The aliens have no advanced weaponry or technology, not even so much as advanced materials out of which to craft battle armor. They are easily dispatched with standard infantry rifles - didn't they bother to check out our capabilities before sending their troops in? Why did they land a bunch of individual soldiers to try to kill the humans one at a time instead of standing off in orbit and smashing our cities with megabombs? The paint-by-numbers ""relationships"" between the soldiers are laughable, the dialog beyond corny. We have the classic aliens-slaughtered-everyone-but-our-heroes plotline, complete with our-heroes-discover-how-to-defeat-aliens nonsense.

4468843,4,B004ULEEY8,"I saw this in the theater, and I just rented it to watch again. It's a solid, exciting and well-executed war movie. It's really only science fiction in that the invading opponent is not from Earth. In actuality, it's genetically much closer to The Big Red One than it is to something like District 9.

The entire film sticks to the ground-level perspective of a squad of fighters from various branches of the US Armed Forces in combat with the enemy. We don't get a god's eye view of the action, we only see what the squad sees.

The story has a very engaging arc and development. The action is very well directed and staged. The director and editor don't rely on rapid cuts and confusion as their only tools to create tension. Instead, they give the viewer enough visual information to get a sense of where things are happening in relation to each other, which enables the viewer to see tactics in action an assess their progress toward success or failure. They succeed at this without sacrificing visual dynamism and energy. For me, this approach is much more satisfying.

There are elements that seem cliche - character types and motivations - but the movie is so well put together that these were not problematic.",1310860800,2,1217,4.651162790697675

If you're the kind of person who strives for a little more in your flicks, new ideas, deep thinking, intelligent dialogue, you won't find it here.

You get the feeling that this flick was filmed with a bunch of home cameras by people inept at operating those devices.  Perhaps this is part of a visual effect to make the film feel more real, but how can one get lost in the story when every few seconds they switch cameras, zoom in and out, point the camera into the sun so that the actor is barely visible.

4468851,3,B004ULEEY8,"This movie is beyond clich...I mean way beyond. I'm going to guess the writer and director assumed that the only experience the audience has ever had with the military is watching Full Metal Jacket and Black Hawk Down. It's a mind numbing experience to have to listen to Eckhart's character constantly give pep talks to every single person around him for fear they would just give up. The main focus point of the action is to show you a glimpse of an alien and then show you five minutes of explosions. I get it, I really do, but I was hoping for more with this movie. For what was hyped to be some sort of monumental blockbuster this movie fails to present one original idea. The dialogue feels very forced in most scenes of the movie as it trudges forward to its inevitable conclusion. And that conclusion...well without giving away a major plot detail, but really that's how you kill the invaders, REALLY? This is your typical cookie cutters, for the masses, let me spell everything out for you while I hold your hand type of movie. Don't get me completely wrong, I understand the appeal of this movie. It's loud, big, and sometimes even halfway interesting. The much hated ""shaky camera"" scenes didn't bother me that much.

The blu ray transfer quality of the movie isn't spectacular, but its not terrible either. The extras on the blu ray are one of the only redeeming factors of the movie. I really enjoyed the PS3 Resistance 3 demo and the various ""making of"" shorts included. Unfortunately once again we find ourselves subjected to listening to actors talk about how hard the two-three week boot camp they had to endure for filming preparation.

Overall the plot didn't live up to the hype. The story isn't well written and most of the time I felt like the scenes that attempted sincere dialogue were in slow motion. After watching the early previews for the movie I had hope this movie could stand out among the other science fiction classics.

Two of the ones I saw in this vain were: The Eagle, and ""I am number four"". Neither were great, but I could get subsumed in the reality they created. Battle Los Angeles on the other hand was super cliched and not very believable at any level. We are supposed to empathize with the staff sarge and his personal pain and then watch him as he performance continuous heroic acts that make his soldiers worship him. Following him everywhere he says hoorah. I love a good action war film and I'm hoping cowboys vs aliens lives up to expectations.

4468853,3,B004ULEEY8,"Why do all  technologically advanced and overwhelming alien armies always have a single point of failure that some scrappy team of humans can use to ""take them down.""  All we have to do is push this button, or overload this reactor, or detonate this object, etc ... and the invasion is defeated. Star Wars, Independence Day, you name it, the story is almost always the same.  Can't we be more creative? Anyway, the point I'm getting to is that this movie is fairly predictable and follows a well-known storyline.  The same cookie-cutter characters are here.  The newly graduated commander who think he knows it all, the hardened vet, the plucky woman, the crying children that need saving, the two lifelong buddies (gee, I wonder if something will happen to one of them). The aliens come down in what are first thought be meteors... yeah that's original.

They tried to make this movie into a combat film, with lots of explosions, soldiers running for cover, bullets flying, etc.  I will give the film credit for trying to combine an urban combat film with  the alien invasions genre, but the film does not do great job a either. It's not a great war movie and its not a great alien film.

One of the more annoying things was that they used the handheld camera technique, often used in recent combat films, even before the action starts.  A character is in a florist shop buying flowers or two characters are talking in an office, and the camera is bobbing and swiftly panning around like they were filming some ""run for cover"" action scene.  Very annoying.

One of my tests for the quality of a movie is whether I find myself looking at the clock to see how much longer this will go on. . . with this film I did.  I'm glad I waited for online streaming version because I would have been dissappointed had I wasted time and money in the theatre. It's not a terrible movie, just not a very good one.

When I was a kid and first caught a whiff of Independance Day, I figured that this type of film would come along eventually (and almost certainly be better), but now here we are in 2011 with Battle: Los Angeles.  After all the amazing trailers and TV spots to market the film, what Battle: Los Angeles really boils down to being is nothing more than a military propaganda piece instead of the massive alien invasion flick that it appears to be on the surface level.  I'm not saying that marines thrust into battle are nothing that shouldn't be cheered, I'm just saying that a majority of the film's characters and their dialogue make the film come off as being more of a recruitment video, just with aliens replacing communists/terrorists/what have you.  That being said, even without the propaganda aspect, the film itself is nothing really special.  Aaron Eckhart makes the best use he can with the cliche dialogue and characterization that's been handed to him, while the rest of the cast, which features Michelle Rodriguez, Ne-Yo, and True Blood's Jim Parrack as fellow soldiers, as well as Bridget Moynahan and Michael Pena in throwaway roles, doesn't really amount to much either.  The effects are okay, and the alien invaders are interestingly designed, even though we don't see nearly enough of them.

4468869,5,B004ULEEY8,"From my wife Sarah: I won't repeat the plot as many other reviewers already have. This was an excellent movie and here's why:

- This was one of the most heart pumping, non-stop action flicks I've probably ever seen. Frankly I've been getting bored with the alien invasion movies, but this was pure adrenalin and really well done.

- Not only was it truly exciting, but it had great characters and excellent character development. I was roped in and cared about the characters. This is an essential element of a good film, and this one had it.

- Although this is fiction and the soldiers were fighting aliens, I think this film depicts the incredible bravery, honor and integrity of our armed forces in a deep way. It also showed some of the inner turmoil they might experience. It was fascinating and moving.

- The acting was fantastic. Aaron Eckhart was brilliant, as were all of the other actors.

- The special effects were fantastic and imaginative.

The plot was fairly simple, but I was drawn in from start to finish. There were so many ""wow"" moments when my jaw was just hanging open. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes scifi, and to those who like action movies. This is absolutely not a movie for kids, pre-teens or sensitive teens.",1310169600,3,1269,4.642857142857143

This movie was amazing. The honor showed in this movie was epic. It makes you wonder how we would really handle a situation like this - aliens or not. Any tragedy like this can be viewed in the same way - it doesn't have to be science fiction. People forget about katrina, all the tornadoes this year, and of course, the earthquake in Japan. How would you react in a tragedy when the only thing you could do was try to survive?

No matter if this is fake or not, it's makes you think. Anyone of us could be in a tragedy. It takes brave men and women to face it head on without second thoughts. People put their lives on the line all the time in REAL life....but let it involve aliens and people forget the real message behind this movie.

4468872,4,B004ULEEY8,"Overview

Every time I watch one of these alien invasion movies, I realize just how improbable the possibility of a victory for earth would really be. If there is anything out there with the technology to reach us with an army, they would simply poison all of us from our orbit and save themselves the trouble of engaging in street to street combat.

The base of these movies is usually the same, we start getting beaten to a pulp until some hero figures out their weakness and in a nick of time we win, yeah right.

Content of the Movie

The hero here is Sgt. Michael Nantz (Aaron Eckhart - also of the Dark Knight - two face), he is not in the best of standing with his colleagues, having lost some of his men in a previous tour. He is about to retire when the `meteors' start crashing through the atmosphere and then into the ocean, near different cities across the earth.

While the overall concept is not original, the close up focus on Sgt. Nantz, and his resolve to redeem himself from his present stigma adds much needed depth to the plot. The storyline maintains a good momentum as the marines try to rescue a few civilians.

With this task completed, he now returns to his based, seeing the destruction there, he then goes after one of the central control ships. The action is almost non-stop and the acting is pretty descent. Overall it is a good watch, but not completely original.",1310169600,,1393,4.464566929133858

They also took a bunch of lines from Independence Day at the end of the movie. They also had way too many cliche' lines when combat actually took place. Oh, and Michelle Rodriguez. Jeez lady, stop taking the same type-cast role in every other movie.

As for the thing that I really liked: character development. These kinds of movies rarely ever incorporate the human element in the forces that are sacrificing everything to turn back an alien invasion. The interactions between Marines in the beginning of the movie felt real and genuine. As someone who's been in the military and deployed in-theater overseas, I found myself thinking, ""Yea, they'd say that"" or, ""yea they'd do that."" When one of the Marines got killed, you actually felt something for them. Combine it with watching to movie on Blu-ray and suddenly the experience becomes even more intense.

4468899,5,B004ULEEY8,"Battle: Los Angeles is a modern war movie told from the perspective of a platoon of US Marines thrown into battle against invading extraterrestrials attempting to take Los Angeles and filmed as if a documentary team was embedded with the unit. The result is a movie that almost looks like it was filmed in the heat and chaos of the intense firefights in Fallujah, Iraq rather than the ruined streets of Santa Monica and Los Angeles. The film begins with their initial contact with an unknown enemy possessing overwhelming firepower while trying to rescue civilians trapped in a police station in Santa Monica, trying to survive and escape while completely cut off from all support and finally rallying to try and destroy the aliens' command and control center against overwhelming odds. The freeway scene depicting the Marines trying to save civilians while trying to hold off the advancing aliens is especially nail biting and reminds me a lot of the intensity of the Omaha beach scene in Saving Private Ryan. The disadvantage of filming this way is that documentary style films are not big on character development unless you have a lot of quiet moments to observe each soldier. You therefore only get a superficial sense of the characters of each of the soldiers who make up main characters in this film but in the context of this film, that's enough to tell this narrative. The dialogue isn't memorable, but then documentary films aren't generally known for memorable dialogue from their subjects either. Other than the absence (for the most part) of f-bombs, the dialogue sounds pretty authentic as far as how soldiers would communicate to each other when performing their mission in the heat of battle. What this film excels at is watching how these soldiers start from being a diverse group who had never been in combat to becoming a cohesive unit fiercely loyal to each other and to their staff sergeant Nantz played by Aaron Eckhart by the end of the film. The only real criticism I have is the whole subplot about Nantz and Cpl Lockart's brother, who died during Nantz last tour in Iraq. I think the scriptwriter missed an opportunity to emphasize instead a bond between Iraq war vets Nantz and Kern (played by Jim Parrack who plays Hoyt Fortenberry in HBO's True Blood), just like Tom Hanks and Tom Sizemore's characters in Saving Private Ryan and Mal Reynolds and Zoe in Firefly/Serenity.",1309737600,2,2400,4.87041564792176

4468901,4,B004ULEEY8,"There are so many wonderful surprises in this fairly ordinary action/adventure/military/thriller movie--and to me, the most important is that it was filmed in Shreveport, my hometown, second or third largest site of film-making in this country today. And ""Battle: Los Angeles"" was a rousing movie!

What I especially like in no particular order:

1. The casting is so diverse! Finally, Latinos are getting their due in films and make up a large portion of actors in this one. There is also one Asian in this company. Later a woman, also Latina, joins them and shows her bravery and courage. Bravo for this attention to ethnic and gender detail!

2. Aaron Eckhart (the big name in this film) is terrific in his role of Staff Sargeant, a man who has just turned in his retirement papers when aliens attack and he is called to second a patrol. I liked him as a genial chef in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Reservations/dp/B00005JPSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Reservations</a>&nbsp;with Katherine Zeta Jones. What a huge range of emotions to play and he was equally convincing in each. A tousled haircut can really make a man!

3. Interesting aliens! No little white plastic-looking men as is often the norm. This time they can telepathically transport themselves over distances. The Mother ship in Los Angeles is truly eye-popping in design--kind of a Sanford and Sons grunge.

4. There is one other woman, but she merely serves as a woman who can remain cool under pressure. Bridget Moynahan from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Bloods-The-First-Season/dp/B003UD7JC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Bloods: The First Season</a>, thankfully, is not thrown in as a love interest!

Perhaps some trouble areas of the film:

1. Camera angles are often kept low to prevent the audience from seeing what is beyond the scene. Filming of a setting that is shot in Shreveport, population 200,000+ and not Los Angeles, what? a million?, must be manipulated carefully so the viewer thinks it IS Los Angeles. However, not even low angles can hide a dozen tall buildings in early and late scenes that pass as the skyline of Los Angeles. I am not complaining! Another scene passes as training ground and looks like sand hills or dunes. Actually, those are probably part of construction sites where dump trucks drive in, collect dirt, then take it to its destination. There are a number of those outside the city limits.

2. Shaky filming in places: a clever way of preventing the viewer from seeing too much of what is beyond a scene.

3. Helicopters flying in exactly the same formation, tilt and all, early and late. Not believable!

4. In the final battle scene the use of the laser machine to focus on the mother ship so that a skud (or some rocket) can hit it made me laugh. There was a cord coming from that machine. Just where did Staff Sargeant plug that cord to produce a laser? The scene was among the ruins of sections of exploded elevations of interstate highways. Oh? The battery?

5. All the heroes going right back into battle. Yes, they may be running on adrenaline, but when they come down, how dependable will they be? That was admirable, but not very efficient.

Overall, I enjoyed the film, particularly knowing the revenue it brings my hometown, site of the shoot. Well I remember the day the interstate was closed down so that the battle could be filmed. Ka-boom! Smoke! Pow! A fun day--and I'm sure that few minded that the interstate was closed. All kinds of thoughtful detours had been set up.

The second half of the movie after the protagonist takes the charge (as staff sergeant), is on a whole different level. Its good. Inspirational speech (or I think it is just venting his feelings out), great ending to the movie are big pluses.

I definitely recommend to watch this if you like action/alien/military genres. cheers.",1309564800,3,623,4.456140350877193
4468907,3,B004ULEEY8,"Really REALLY frustrated and annoyed right... I had ordered ""Battle: Los Angeles"" a couple weeks back primarily for the ""Resistance 3 Demo"" that was advertised as included with this single-disc BD edition (but also because we wanted to see the film, and watch our hometown get blown to bits).

Well, my shipment finally arrived today, I opened up ""Battle: Los Angeles"", popped it into my PS3 ready to give the demo a whirl, and... it's not there. Tried it on my second PS3, same thing. To say I'm incredibly disappointed right now (and a bit angry) is a huge understatement.

I don't know what's going on with Amazon's copies, but the demo absolutely is NOT on every single-edition BD. I don't know if a batch of discs was erroneously packaged with the incorrect disc or what... but others have commented on missing demos as well, both here at Amazon and elesewhere.

Guess I'll have to demand a return and hope for the best with a replacement copy... but something tells me I'm gonna get screwed again. After what I just went through this past week (two deaths in the family, hacked accounts, my wife suddenly requiring eye surgery, and more news along these lines), the last thing I need to deal with is ""simple"" stuff like this that consumers should never have to deal with. *SIGH*

4468908,3,B004ULEEY8,"I read the bad reviews but every time I saw the trailers I just had to see this movie. Unfortunately, the bad reviews were right. It had so much potential. Great action, great special effects, a good premise. Where it failed was a bad story and the action was literally non-stop. You never really got to know the characters. You had glimpses into the main character, the Staff Sgt., but that was about it. I have to mention though, why is he still a Staff Sgt? He's been in the military a long time, he should be a higher rank by now. The majority of the movie centers around this Staff Sgt and a group of Marines sent in to rescue civilians while being under attack from aliens. As much action as there was, I actually started to get bored. It was just one action scene after another of shooting & things being blown up. After awhile you kept waiting for something different to happen. Maybe if we knew the characters better it would have added a level of suspense since you would feel more of a connection. This was definitely a disappointment. It could have been a great movie but it turned out to just be a mindless action movie of stuff getting blown up.",1309564800,2,1159,4.37037037037037

The dialog had its corky moments that left you rolling your eyes way to often and wondering when the movie would end.

4468914,3,B004ULEEY8,"""Mo-tard"" is a term used in the Marine Corps when something is so overly motivating that it's outright ridiculous. That's this movie in a nutshell. I can't help critiquing movies like this because I spent much of my career at Camp Pendleton where this movie is set and filmed. I called and texted many friends during and after watching this asking when was the last time you went golfing in uniform with kevlar on and night-vision attached to it? NEVER!! Marines do NOT hang out on base golf courses at night drinking on a truck tailgate!! I have lately fallen in love with ""retreat hell!"" as a jest and say it all the time to annoy people. And the air force chick who was runnin and gunnin like rambo and knew all the Marine Corps weapons systems and how to properly employ them? OH-kay!

Now...the action was great and a lot of it, the story was nowhere near on par with movies like Independence Day or Day After Tomorrow or 2012 etc. The movie is by FAR more about the Staff Sergeant than anything else. I mean, it's more about the SSgt than it is about the world being attacked! thats how the movie focuses things. There was also pretty much NO break from the action. Example: they're running, now they're shooting, now they're yelling and running again, now they're shooting again...I would watch it again because it's funny. The Staff Sergeant has almost a deeper voice than batman in Dark Knight...it's like he eats and drinks testosterone boosters for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Here's a reference: Think C.Eastwood's ""Heartbreak Ridge"" in 2011 but with aliens and you have Battle: LA to a T.",1309478400,2,1603,4.640845070422535

I wouldn't be surprised if this film got some dosh from the armed forces, it'll make you want to join the marines within the first 19 minutes, if you didn't want to already. I have to note that Eckhart is impressive as a soul-crushed soon-to-be-retired-but-ha!-not-yet commander, and I could never tell if the cold glint in his eyes was CGI or actually, well, acting.

The characters lacked some of the inherent ""grunt"" personality that USMC infantrymen have, but that's not too surprising.  The movie has big expectations beyond merely an action movie and it falls a little flat when it attempts to be more, but the attempt at pulling heart strings comes off as honest which makes the movie more endearing.",1309392000,2,415,4.914285714285715
4468920,5,B004ULEEY8,"An on the ground ""grunt"" war that is right in your face and with non stop action! The fighting scenes in the city was very realistic. I remember during Tet the Marines and my unit, 1st Squadron 9th Cav., 1st Air Cav Div. having to go into the former
Imperial Capitol of Vietnam, Hue. The fighting was street to street, house to house with snipers every where. Thank God for grenade launchers because they were pinpoint accurate, and caused some serious ""hurt"" as was shown in the movie. But hand grenades were minimal in the movie, and claymores were non-existent. One of the things we encountered were lots of dead bodies every where and dead animals. You would think there would be a lot of dead bodies in the movie, but I only remember two-and where where all of the pets, dead or alive? And with the F-16 Falcons and F-18 Hornets constantly flying overhead, no bombs, missiles or mini-guns and no areas littered with dead aliens. They really had it spot on about esprit de corps and camaraderie. You will never be closer to anyone than people that have stood next to you in battle and faced death. And yes people die and you feel an anger and just want to lash out and blame someone, which was perfectly portrayed in the movie. But you have to put your anger aside and work together as a team, or maybe no one makes it out alive. Wearing that uniform puts you under a set of rules that will get you killed. The action really picked up when they met the aliens with a crew-served weapon [made me think of the Germans and the 20mm in ""Saving Pvt Ryan.]They finally reached a point where they could not defeat the aliens because of a superior weapon. In a very flamboyant move, the lieutenant, who is wounded stays with the bus, their former transit, and detonates a bag full of C-4 destroying all of the aliens and their weapon, and dying in the process. [I guess they left their spool of wire for remotely detonating the explosives back at the base?] From here on the drama which seems to let down with an air extraction suddenly increases when they spot an area that is dead black and they drop back to ground to run a recon to see if this could be the alien command and control center the USAF specialist with them is hoping to find, and take out because its the aliens that has had air superiority and no military aircraft of the planet could take to the the air to take the battle, to them! Well, they find the prize underground, but are discovered too, and head back up to street level. Once there they find some kind of super structure which they destroy. Just when you think that's it, game over, the ground rumbles and the entire alien command center surfaces to leave. They call in a fire mission for ground to air missiles that will home in on a laser spot which they will ""paint"" on the target, but the aliens use a drone to get in the way and the missile hits it. However on the subsequent shot they take out the drone with an AT-4 shoulder launched missile, and the missile they called in takes down the alien craft. This even causes the aliens on the ground to retreat with the Marines advancing.
Naturally they get back and are commended-and go right back out with the other troops to fight after rearming.
My criticisms are just nit picking. Its a thoroughly enjoyable movie with non stop action, and you wonder how anybody could have lived through it. I rate it 3 bags of microwave popcorn-my highest rating!",1309392000,2,3428,4.434231378763867

To me, the best movie is the one I don't have to examine for a social agenda or a psychological thriller that leaves one searching for the DSM-IV diagnosis.

4468926,2,B004ULEEY8,"After seeing all the good reviews i just wanted to put my two cents in. This movie is more in tune for the war movie fan not the sci fi fan, and i wanted to make sure that those that bought this movie was aware of this. The only good thing about this movie was the acting. I think that the actors went above and beyond there abilities and the failings of this has nothing to do with them. I don't want to sound totally negative about this movie so ill list the pros and cons of this movie and let you the consumer decide if its worth parting with your hard earned money.

Pros
1. The acting was wonderfully done.
2. Was seemingly patriotic.
3. if you are a war movie fan this is for you.
4. if you dislike sci fi story lines / realism towards science this is for you.
5. good special effects.

Cons
1. The Aliens were totally unbelivable. so much effort was put into making them unique that they look like a two year old drew them on a scrap of paper.
2. The aliens tech looks much more inferior than our own tech. most of the ships and weapons looked like they rummaged through our garbage dumps and just sloped them together. They hardley looked opposing let alone make it out of their own solar system.
3. The aliens did a controled crash into our planet instead of just landing (WOW just WOW).
4. The Plot was absolutely the most stupidest thing I ever heard. They came for water too fuel their technology. Water is the most abundent thing in the universe next to hydrogen. it can even be made..... so an alien race moves from solar system too solar system allowing countless thousands of their own race to be slaughtered just to get something they can make themselves (REALLY?)

I am a huge sci fi fan and almost always rate high and give great reviews to the hard work put into something. But I rate this 2 stars only because of the hard work put into this movie by the actors its not their fault the writers are lacking the ability to put together a plausible story and its not the actors fault that the producers cant invision a plausible alien race / tech.",1309305600,3,2065,4.262755102040816
4468927,5,B004ULEEY8,"So....before watching this, ask yourself what it is you are really looking for in a movie. If you are looking for the next incredible script and/or amazing dialogue, you might as well just move on. This is an action film, pure and simple.

The basic premise is that a bunch of clustered meteors appear on our tracking devices not long before impact, and seem to be falling near major coastal population centers around the globe. Before impact, they all slow down, and ""pieces"" of the clusters break away from their main hosts. Film crews on the scene reveal that they are actually aliens, who begin by killing the beachgoers and destroying the ships off the coast. Prior to ""impact"" a general evacuation of the target areas had been ordered by the gov't, but apparently, a lot of people wanted to witness the event, including swimmers and surfers. Anyway....

The central focus of the movie is a squad of marines led by a green lieutenant and a grizzled staff sergeant with a reputation for getting his soldiers killed in combat and/or leaving them behind (played by Eckhart).  The marines set up a forward operating base to halt the alien invasion. Several units, including Eckhart's are sent into the warzone to rescue civilians that haven't made it to the FOB, or are trapped. Of course, nobody is quite prepared for the alien soldiers they encounter, but the unit is gritty, and fights their way to some civilians. Their rescue chopper is blown out of the sky with their four (or five, cant remember) injured squadmates in it. So....they have to hoof it to the FOB. Did i mention that the gov't plans to carpet bomb the whole area, and they only have a limited amount of time to get out of the area?

This is where the movie really starts getting interesting. I won't ruin the rest of it, but there are lots and lots of gunfights and explosions, some of which actually knocked my speakers off the entertainment center! Also, Eckhart in particular really shined in his role, but in truth, you come to love all the soldiers, and find yourself feeling proud of those who survive and those who die as well.",1309305600,6,2106,4.653225806451613

Sorry to break the news to all the ""high brows"" and ""low brows"" out there... this was not about being an action or Sci-Fi Movie... it was a well written screenplay about ONE MAN (with some great supporting charactors and perspectives), and his personal experience/perspective when life ""just happens"" (As the great story of life is often apt to do). Has THAT story been told before? Sure... but this version had great acting, directing and visual effects to boot... just nothing over the top... which is GOOD.  It is AT LEAST as good as any film ever made with similar themes and genres... and that makes it GREAT, by default... if not with the blessing of the ""annointed"" critics out there.  Is it a ""Chick Flick?"" Nope. It's not a ""metro man"" flick either, but saying that... this film is not a ""Movie for guys who love movies"" flick either, per se (Sorry TNT), although it would work there. Intelligent and thoughtful women will love it just as much as any man capable of seeing the story in a movie, and not just the eye candy.

Better yet?... It does not take itself too seriously (like the critics who slammed it), but can justifiably be called a great, entertaining film with a REAL STORY anyway.  I'm prior service, and parts of this film made me very anxious duirng close-in battle scenes on the big screen in the theater, while other parts brought a sincere tear to my eye.  This is a personal story about irony, finding meaning in disaster and sacrifice, personal character in a crisis, and redemption of the tired and battered soul.

4468938,2,B004ULEEY8,"What went wrong with this film?

As a sci-fi fan, I eagerly anticipated the release of this film earlier in the year.

The VERY well done trailer made this film look like it was going to be awesome.

But, to me, it was, sadly, a missed opportunity on the part of the filmmakers.

What stands out to me, as a sci fi fan....

1. Aliens were not interesting looking, well thought out, and were just overall nonsensical in their design
2. Aliens looked awkward when walking around...(like walking tadpoles)...but even this was presented in a sort of ""after the thought"", laughable type of way
3. No sense of awe, wonder, or mystery about the aliens on the part of the script or the actors...., the movie just starts ""showing them""
4. Aliens did nothing much that was ""alien"" in terms of their behavior, customs, or movements when invading...they looked very much like earth soldiers in the way they walked, shot their weapons, etc
5. In fact, the ""Alien"" weapons were VERY MUCH ""Earthlike"".....the aliens, from space, used.....guided missiles launched from some walking machine....why would we suppose/assume that an alien race from space would use very much ""US Army"" style guided missiles as weapons...something extremely earth-like...seemed like a lack of creative juices going on with this one?
SIMILAR- Alien guns, even though shooting lasers, were once again too ""earth-like""...their weapons, from another galaxy across space, still fire with the same rhythm as an earth military gun ""uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh""...no odd, foreign weapons, no weird organisms being spit at people as weapons, etc...guided missiles and what basically would count as a type of automatic weapon
6. The marines not wondering where these things are from, what they want here, how their technology works, none of this matters to the people...NO sense of wonder, awe, or questioning at all
7. The one Marine's worst line in the film.....""I wonder if they're just like us...just grunts, takin' orders...""  most embarrassingly funny line of the movie
8. All we DO hear over and over are speeches about the Marines, Marines never quit, Marines never die, Be my brave little Marine, .....would the Marines really still continue to care about being marines if there was about to be no more EARTH???
9. Wouldn't it have been more interesting to see if there was a faction of marines that just took off and starting using their skills in a sort of every man for himself mode? Vigillantes, etc? Something to signify that the normal structure of ""the Marines"", the ""United States Government"", etc etc was not going to be intact when Aliens invade the earth...Maybe this would have introduced an actual CONCEPT to the film, some sort of SUBTEXT about how society might hold it's traditions together in times when society itself may be about to end...who sticks with the Marines and who takes off on their own, as a survivalist? Would have added SOME KIND of food for thought in this film
10. Aliens were too easy to figure out.  Just blow up their control tower and you got them. Not well thought out...not hard enough for the Marines to figure out...this was just suddenly dropped as a ""fact"" from Michelle Rodriguez character...no set up to reveal the discovery of the control tower, no previous scenes in the film where the Marines are trying to figure out the mystery of where the control tower is, etc...Basically , no SETUP at all, just a sudden left turn in the plot from a line from Michelle....hmmmmm.
11. The only good scene in the film took place in the laundry room of an apartment complex...THAT was cool...THAT was the only scene that mixed the everyday/mundane local L.A. environment with an alien from space...THAT was what we came to see when we bought our tickets, and you, the filmmakers, gave us like 2 minutes of it......and (what seemed like) 100 hours of ""Brave Marines"" music, ""Brave Marines"" speeches, and unrealistic scenarios, shaky camera, and explosions
12. Once again, lack of ""mysteriousness"" of the aliens...the earth characters were so uninteresting that I actually wanted to learn more about the aliens, but the movie didn't seem to care about the things I cared about...the movie ignored them, and that was very frustrating
13. The CGI was cheaply done and seemed rushed, so this fact was just seemingly glossed over by making fake ""heat waves"" to cover the aliens look during man scenes, so we couldn't really see them
14. Bad script
15. Bad acting
16. Annoying music that didn't change no matter what was happening on screen, no change from ""brave music"" to ""suspenseful music"" to any other kind of music...just the same 5 minutes of orchestral theme playing (seemingly) over and over in a 2 hour loop
17. Continuous lack of suspense...just action without suspense
18. WASTE of Michelle Rodriguez and especially EMBARASSINGLY BAD SCRIPT and EMBARASSING treatment of Aaron Eckhardt's acting skills
19. Long, long, LONG speeches from Aaron Eckhardt about how he memorized the name, rank, and serial number of the brother of the soldier that died under his command...WHY IS THIS USED AS CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT??? WHY is ""REALISM"" and ""CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT"" in these types of films decided to be depicted by HAVING PEOPLE IGNORE THE FANTASTIC AND UNBELIEVABLE FACT THAT ALIENS FROM SPACE ARE INVADING THE EARTH AND INSTEAD STILL SQUABBLING over things that happened last year....the one Marine, instead of spending any time pondering anything, just spends the movie mad at the Sgt for the fact his brother died under that Sgt's command. We as the aidience are not guiven a reason to CARE about the brother, because we never even got to KNOW the brother in the film. We came to this film to see Sci-Fi. We didn't get it.

This film was, to me,  the most disappointing film of 2011.

The gung-ho bravado of the soldiers and involved civilians is big, loud, frenetic and full of exciting battle scenes and heroic acts.  It captures the viewer right away and in spite of the expected cliches, it is a rousing spectacle.
The alien invaders are reminiscent of DISTRICT 9 and SKYLINE.  The actors' roles are limited but they perform admirably especially Aaron Eckhart, Ramon Rodriguez, Bridget Moynahan and Michael Pena.  The jittery camera work is effective and the special effects outstanding.

The thing I've learned over time is critics like bad movies, and hate good movie. They make us believe that The King's Speech or The English Patient are good movies. They tried to say that the first Batman movie that came out in 89' was bad. If I 'd listen to what critics thought I would have missed out on some really good movies.

4468945,4,B004ULEEY8,"For years film makers have made movies that talked about an invasion of Earth by aliens. The most famous have included WAR OF THE WORLDS, INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS and THE THING, all made and then later remade. But while each of those films depicted an opposing force taking on our own, more often than not it was a space ship using enormous power or a one on one taking over of a human. A real look at what war with aliens might be like hasn't been seen until the just released BATTLE: LOS ANGELES.

The film opens with Staff Sgt. Michael Nantz (Aaron Eckhart) turning in his notice. He's planning on retiring. This is in part because he's had enough but also because his last assignment went bad resulting in most of his men being killed while he survived, something that rumor mongers blame him for. Once his last group is finished training, he's gone.

But that doesn't happen when he and his men are called in while on maneuvers. They're whisked away via helicopter to a special base and told that what was thought to be a series of asteroids hitting the Earth is now thought to be an alien invasion. The asteroids are slowing as they hit the atmosphere and as they watch news reports they witness the armed invaders, their form of grunts on foot, rise from the seaside and begin firing on civilians.

The battle rages on but the fire power of the aliens is just too massive. With only 3 hours until they drop a ton of bombs to take out Santa Monica, Nantz and his new commander Lt. Martinez (Ramon Rodriguez) are assigned to take their men in to rescue a group stranded in a police station and to send back intel along the way.

The men are dropped down but it isn't long before their opponent's fire on them, leaving them with initial casualties and searching for a safe haven if just for a moment. The Lt. finds himself dazed and confused (a stereotype of most war films where a college educated leader stresses under real fire only to have the 2nd in command get him on track). It's up to the Sgt. to get them moving once more and heading for the station.

Along the way they encounter the remnants of another platoon who have been hit harder than they have. Regrouping and joining forces, they head for the police station in the hope that the survivors are still alive.

Their hopes weren't in vain once they arrive to find a few civilians still alive. The officers there are gone but their mission continues with just a short amount of time left to rescue these people, get back and possibly provide the military with enough information that they can find a way to repel these invaders.

All that in less than half the movie.

Due to the aliens as the invaders, most people will view this as a science fiction film. In reality this is definitely a war picture. The heroics of the men involved, the gung ho attitude of these Marines, the stereotypes seen in characters have been a staple for years. Many of the plotlines can be found in numerous war films. In any event it just doesn't matter. Even if these ideas and characters have been seen before, they still provide an entertaining film.

The film also offers an inspiring look at the military as well. After years of tarnishing those in the military either as post traumatic stress victims, baby killers or goofballs who violate every human right possible, we're presented here with a group of professionals who are trained to defend every person they can, to rescue those in need and to take on any hostile enemy that might attack the U.S., or in this case the Earth.  There are moments when you feel a swelling in your chest as these good men and women do their best against the worst of odds to protect and serve this country. It's rare to see in today's movies and nice for a change.

There are no stand out performances in this film. The entire cast does a great job depicting what the possible end of the world due to invasion might be like. There is fear on their faces when confronting an unknown enemy. There is joy when they can save someone. And there is triumph when they win any small battle that they can as they try and get to a safe location.

The effects are fantastic offering what appears to be the new look of alien spaceships and weaponry. For me these crafts seemed reminiscent of the space ship seen in DISTRICT 9. And the aliens themselves seem like a twisted compilation of the classic Predator and half a dozen robots seen of late. But it's not just these two items that offer the best effects. It's the scenes of devastation, of Los Angeles in flames, a burning relic of what it once was. That is the effect that sticks with you.

While BATTLE: LOS ANGELES isn't quite a feel good movie it does offer hope and inspiration. And the entire vibe that surrounds the Marines in this film, as stated earlier, is one that gives you hope that should something like this ever occur, there will be someone there standing ready to take on all comers and to defend us all.

4468947,5,B004ULEEY8,"I normally do not buy movies right when the come out on DVD but I rented this in netflix and loved it. I love the war movies and many sci-fi movies (ranging from Independence Day to Contact). This movie seems to be more of a ""war"" based film than the focusing on the scifi. Many people compare this to Hurt Locker but I disagree. It reminded me more of the opening scene for Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brother (its that type of action). The only difference is that there are pretty bad ass aliens to fight. I did like the fact that the aliens were not almighty powerful compared to the humans which was a cool concept in my opinion.

I thought the SF were right on par with Transformers or any other modern CGI for that matter. I didn't see any glitches or anything like that.

Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes adrenaline for an entire movie.",1308873600,2,871,4.304878048780488

OK, this is a good movie. It has good flow and decent character development given the restrictions of the theme of the movie. A lot of the characters die early, so they don't need a lot of development (sad to say). The actors act like real Marines. What you hear them say is what Marines say (I was one- active duty 1993-1997, by the way not all Marines drop the f-bomb every other word!).

Some say the movie is full of cliches...I don't see it. I wanted an action film with Marines, not a ""film"". That is what this movie is. Others claim the special effects are bad...I don't get it. You see the movie as the Marines do. Things are happening fast. No, you don't see total close-ups of the aliens for this reason. Others claim the shaking camera is annoying. I loved it.

I thought it was good acting, not over the top to where any actor took over a scene so with that being said, I thought this was a very well balanced movie. Even the subplots i.e. the ssgt and the history/mystery of his last assignment, the brother of one of those killed on his last assignment being under his command and not to mention the civilians and how that all played out.

This is what I and others like about films like this, ""set it and forget it"". In other words just plug the movie in and enjoy, no trying to figure out what is going to happen at the end when the movie first starts just let it take you to the end.

4468950,1,B004ULEEY8,"Positive:
Military recruiting storyline of how much fun it is to kill anything that's different (i.e. the aliens as a metaphor for racial, cultural and religious differences even species differences). Oh right, would have been shared party time if they hadn't struck first.

Negatives:
(1.) 50% of movie consisted of closeups of facial expressions; mostly hero soldiers with a few distraught/vulnerable civilians and children sprinkled in. Cheap substitute for lack of most every other film attribute such as a story, acting, setting, cinematography, script, directing.
(2.) 25% of movie consisted of the cheap standby of wrecking yard vehicles and burning tires and styrofoam representing scattered concrete blocks with really badly overused high school level CGI for aliens, buildings, etc.
(3.) 25% of movie consisted of puny power weaponry to prop up characters slightly less bland than the aliens with lot's of Hoo(r)ah for extra toughness.
(4.) Script and characterizations were developed for a juvenile level male audience comprehension with attention span brains developed from gaming. Oh well, so goes the real American education.
(5.) As for the science (or lack of): Our aliens supposedly came to the only place in the ""Known Universe"" where there is liquid salt water to power their machinery. Well, first off maybe they should have gone to the ""Unknown Universe"" initially - haha! Second, actually water is ubiquitous through out the Universe and is a relatively poor source of energy. Third, I doubt that their level of development would still have them making Erector set style space craft that are physically inefficient if not ineffective. Fourth, since there is no ballpark habitable planet within a thousand light years of here - that would be one long trip even at near speed-of-light which would require so much energy that they would have to bring a Sun along with them to draw from as an energy source.

Battle L.A., money and the increase in entertainment junkfood:
And I thought that the increasing inequality in the accumulation of wealth amongst the business/financial and legal profession representatives relative to the actual producers would eventually bring America down but now I thinking of adding mass market media reps to that exclusive list.",1308873600,2,2277,5.287292817679558

If this film had been released in 1981 with John Carpenter as the director it would now be considered a classic of action suspense cinema.  It's the kind of film that finds its audience on DVD, just as Alien, Predator, Commando and Terminator did back in the day.

Martinez was green on the job fresh out of officer school and in charge of a platoon of Marines tasked with an important assignment behind enemy lines.  However, when the movie nears its end, it almost felt like everyone was in a hurry trying to get somewhere and it was over and credits rolling in a blink of an eye.

4468957,4,B004ULEEY8,"Overall, Battle: LA won't go down as one of the best alien invasion movies, but it will be one of my favorites.  There are fair criticisms of character stereotypes, recycled alien design, unoriginal plot, etc.  Even with all of that, this film wins me over with it's simple and possible truthful account of how a squad of Marines would handle an alien invasion.

The audience expectations for alien invasion movies typically value the film based on the WOW factor.  How unique is the alien design?  How cool and unusual are their weapons and ships?  With all these expectations, I'd imagine people would be rather let down by the idea of simple alien life forms.  The aliens are quite typical for today's standards, but I overlook this because it's the characters journey through the battle that matters most.

Other criticism is the lack of bird's eye view of the invasion as a whole.  The aliens reach major coastal cities around the world and viewers may feel like they are stuck in a box and not seeing the bigger picture.  Let me make this clear...  The movie is called `Battle: LA', and THAT is the plot.

While fans enjoy the action sequences, the reason I enjoy the movie is the characters.  For example, Eckhart does an outstanding job portraying the washed up Staff Sergeant Nantz.  Twenty years of service and a closet full of skeletons.  His story is realistic and may not go well with viewers that have no understanding of the military.  Nantz makes the decision to retire, which was not an easy decision.  For those that know men and women that have spent 20 years in active service understand how hard this can be.  I am paraphrasing, but there is a scene where Nantz has received his signed documents for retirement, he says `This is all I know'.  Basically saying, ""This is all that I am.""  I seem to take in more about his character the further the story goes.  It seems to resonate with me more than others.

My last comment has to do with the plot.  The original mission for these Marines was to locate civilians and get them back to the FOB.  While this is happening, you start to see the second mission unfold.  In war, I tend to find that you need lady luck on your side.  There are unexplainable things that happen in a battle, but you never question it at the time.  The film made me feel like I was right there in the thick of it and realizing the same conclusion as Nantz does.  There are no coincidences in life, just missed opportunities.  When the audience comes up with a million reasons why the small band of Marines couldn't have successfully crossed behind enemy lines and infiltrated the alien's intel station, I say you only need to come up with one reason on how they could.",1308787200,4,2711,4.554865424430642
4468958,1,B004ULEEY8,"Beware Sci-Fi fans, Battle: Los Angeles is not what it seems. The film feels more like a War film than a Sci-Fi film, focusing mostly on the Marines.

The backstory works ok, but feels a bit contrived. If you just take it as a good action flick, you will like it. With the several alien invasion films out there, I still don't feel a great one has been made yet.

4468961,2,B004ULEEY8,"*minor spoilers, if you could call them that. You'll see 100% of this coming as it unfolds in your living room*

First of all, I don't care what critics say prior to watching a movie. I do check them out occasionally after I see one and I can't quite figure out how to articulate all of my thoughts. What I care about is what the users say about movies before I see them. I hope this helps:

The Cons

Long, boring intro to one dimensonal characters who are contrived stereotypes. The kid , possibly too young to serve, certainly too young to die. The grizzled vet , haunted by the demons of his past failures, the young officer who is also a new father...blah, blah, blah. Not only are these people cartoons, you are never given the chance to care about them , even though a fair amount of screen time is dedicated to their introduction.

The cliches continue as the film rolls...it's quiet here, too quiet. Oh no, what's that sudden noise? Oh good , it's just a dog. Oh no, we walked single file down the middle of the street with tall buildings on both sides and now we're getting ambushed! (Who could have guessed that creatures advanced enough to have interstellar flight , with superior weapons and vehicles, would also have mastered basic tactics? )

This whole movie rolls like a video game, complete with levels, a boss or two and a final push toward the alien stronghold (?) ,which was curiously unguarded for the ultimate value of the target. Guess those aliens worked out tactics but not strategy?

Wooden acting. Mostly because the dialogue is weak. I think. It is sometimes hard to tell if these actors are also just not as good as I thought , in the case of Rodriguez and Eckhart .

One of the pros, the look of the thing, is also a con in that you always felt that a little more money in the budget would have yielded better looking aliens and allowed for a few more close ups instead of quick panning past the real stars, the aliens.

Pros -

The combat scenes are COOL and fairly intense. I may watch it a second time for those alone. It has that shakey Saving Private Ryan camera work going on at times, and it sorta works. As mentioned above, occasionally I felt like the camera work was more of a ""we don't have the budget for close, extended scenes showing these aliens, work around it!""

There are a few scenes showing the aliens behaving liked a trained military force. And you will realize at that time that usually the aliens in movies employ a shoot-everything-that-moves , lay waste to all, while moving freely in the open, unconcerned about opposition. These cats take cover, lay suppressing fire , etc. Again , like a video game.

The decision to make the aliens more advanced but not to hopelessly outmatch us, was great and added a lot to the combat sequences.

All in all , it's really a 2 1/2 star movie. I think it's just not quite good enough to enjoy on a visual level solely nor is there enough story to easily propel the the movie along between action sequences. Redbox it for a dollar and you're stoked. Borrow from a neighbor/friend and you're happier. 5 bucks at Blockbuster and/or $15 to buy it and I think you're on here tomorrow, writing your own review warning people.",1308700800,5,3214,4.465870307167235

Yes, it is a great non-stop action firefight, but so much more. It has heart, wit and wisdom. Hey, it even mentions World War II and John Wayne, so it has a little educational history for today's youth who attend public school and/or don't read books (or who don't watch old classic Hollywood movies).

4468964,5,B004ULEEY8,"This review is going to be short and sweet because a very simple point needs to be made.

This is not a ""war movie"", this is Military Science Fiction. It's in the gritty style of Black Hawk Down without it being a real event in history.

As a sub-genre of Science Fiction, MilSciFi has very specific flavors and ideas that tend to come through (Usually very pro-American, semi-realistic or realistic as possible point of view, seemingly simplistic characters that find depth through action rather then history and so on) and if you aren't into that sort of thing, you won't enjoy the movie, plain and simple.

Another point: This isn't Heinlein or Drake or any of the greats of MilSciFi writing. This is a straight forward shooter - Marines Kick Ass. If you're looking for long exposition on the ideas of war or the futility thereof, this is not the movie for you.

If this isn't your sort of movie, i respect that, and lets move on.

If it is, you're going to love it. This is, frankly, the best take on MilSciFi available to watch on DVD or BlueRay.

But when I saw the final product, I couldn't help but find it to being lower than my expectations. ""Battle: Los Angeles"" took itself way too seriously, when it should've been fun, exciting, and entertaining. And I'm proud to call myself an Action movie junkie, but I personally expected more and better from this film.  I guess for this generation if I want to see an alien invasion film where the military goes to war with them (particlarly if they're robots, like the one in this film), I'll just have to settle for Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" film for the time being. Say what you will, but at least ""Transformers"" never took itself too seriously; and  it was better than this.",1308614400,2,775,4.6911764705882355
4468966,4,B004ULEEY8,"Check out the full review at [...]!

At the start of Battle: Los Angeles, we meet Staff Sergeant Michael Nantz. He is getting older, and it is shown that he can't quite keep up with his fellow soldiers any more, so he makes the decision to retire. He figures his best years as a soldier are behind him. He is given one last mission, and he is assigned to a group of Marines led by a young Lieutenant. Of course, the day starts out well enough, and soon goes to hell as aliens invade LA and start exterminating humanity.

Directed by Jonathan Liebesman, Battle: Los Angeles is a thrilling, gritty action movie. It's not meant to be taken too seriously, as it is, at its core, a dumb popcorn flick. It's full of cheesy dialogue and overzealous patriotism, but if you turn your brain off for a little bit you'll have fun watching this.

The whole movie in anchored by the perpetually awesome actor Aaron Eckhart. He is given a good amount of bad dialogue in this movie, but he somehow makes it work. You never cringe when he says a line that would be cringe-worthy coming out of a lesser actor's mouth. He nails the intense stare and general badass vibe of an action hero. I would love to see Eckhart in more roles like this, preferably where he is surrounded by equal actors with a better script.

If you've ever played the Playstation 3 game series Resistance, you'll instantly feel like you are watching a live action version of that franchise. I can see why the movie is being promoted alongside Resistance 3 (you can even catch a glimpse of a Resistance 3 billboard in the background of one scene). It's basically Resistance mixed with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.

Like I said before, most of this movie's problems stem from its script. The characters, apart from Eckhart's Michael Nantz, are not very fleshed out, which makes it kind of hard to care about them later in the movie when they are in danger. The action in this movie is great and fast paced, however, and helps mask the flaws embedded in the script.

Michelle Rodriguez is in this movie, once again typecast as a badass chick who kicks ass. At least she always pulls it off. Ramon Rodriguez, who played Shia's extremely annoying roommate in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, is slightly less annoying here. Ne-Yo is the only other actor I recognized, and I have to say his acting range is severely limited, which is all the more pronounced when he is around a seasoned vet like Eckhart.

Battle: Los Angeles would probably have been a much lesser movie without Aaron Eckhart. His great skill and careful subtlety really help ground the movie, when it would otherwise just spiral into absolute ridiculousness. If you know what you're getting into, and adjust your expectations accordingly, Battle Los Angeles is worth picking up. The Blu Ray has a great picture, some decent extras, and an exclusive demo for Resistance 3. At less than $18 currently on Amazon, it is worth picking up in my opinion, if you are a fan of the genre.

4468968,1,B004ULEEY8,"Proof positive some movies are a business model instead of an artistic creation. Not one single iota of talent or finesse went into the making of this film. This is essentially the poor man's Black Hawk Down meets Independence Day, while borrowing cliche plot points from just about every major war movie ever made. All things that could be overlooked if it weren't for the awful script; not even Ridley Scott could have saved this film.

I could write a lengthy review pointing out how awful this movie is on every level, but it's not even worth me wasting my time. I'll settle for this:

Dialogue is 95% consisting of marines grunting or yelling ""Staff Sergeant!!!!""
Dialogue is cheesier than dangerously cheesy Cheetos. ""I'd go to hell and back for you."" .....really? Lets not even get into the pep-talk scene near the end. Some of the worst writing I've ever seen.
The aliens are laughable, at best. Seeing them evokes no sense of fear or dread, they look like rejects from a Star Wars droid casting call.
I could care less about any of the characters, they're all hollow and rarely speak more than a sentence at a time.
Plot has poor pacing, makes no sense, is uninteresting and totally disjointed. This is more video game than movie, minus, you know, you actually playing it.
Cliche's at every level of the film. I couldn't find one original idea or plot point. It's as if the director said, ""omg hay guyz, lets make a terrible mash up of every successful war movie and add aliens because that would appeal to teenage boys who play Halo!""

Given how interesting this film could have been and how insultingly bad it was, I find it mind boggling that there are actually positive reviews here. The only person I could see liking this movie, in any capacity, is the type of person you ask what they think is the greatest film of all time, and they respond: ""Armageddon!""",1308441600,3,1872,4.615615615615615

4468970,4,B004ULEEY8,"At it's heart, Battle: Los Angeles is yet another retelling of H. G. Wells' seminal story, War of the Worlds. Like that classic invasion story, this one begins with a meteor shower that takes a turn for the worse when it becomes apparent that those meteors are actually extraterrestrial vessels containing a deadly cargo of alien soldiers hellbent on conquering our world for our natural resources, especially our water.

What unfolds is a world war where the unprepared forces of Earth must confront an unexpected threat from beyond. Thrust into this maelstrom is a Marine unit, largely lead by Sgt. Michael Nantz, tasked with rescuing some civilians who are trapped in a police station that is now behind enemy lines. As you can probably figure out on your own, when you send a Marine unit on a collision course with alien invaders, well, your gonna get a lot of fireworks.

So, that's the summation. Does this movie work?

I don't know what movie the critics were watching, but it wasn't the awesomely entertaining Battle: Los Angeles I watched last night!

Now, don't get me wrong - this isn't a perfect movie, nor a completely original one - but nonetheless I found BLA (I'm tired of writing out the name ) to be a throwback to classic sci-fi film making of the 1950's - you know the type: those classic alien invasion tales heavily influenced by the Red Scare; the ""aliens are evil and need to be gun-downed by red blooded Americans"" type of tale that they haven't made in a long while. On this, BLA succeeds wonderfully as we get to watch US Marines, along with the USAF and Army, attempt to battle back and stop the alien invasion over the course of approximately 48 hours. The aliens are clearly evil - we get to watch a bunch of television news clips where they can be seen gunning down civies - so this is definitely not one of your pansy, politically correct Avatar-like flicks where the humans are the bad guys - and I am tremendously grateful for that moral clarity. These aliens are bad and we are good. Now it's time to kill 'em.

But in addition to this being a tribute of 50s-era sci-fi, this movie is also a tribute to classic war flicks. As you watch BLA, you will find yourself thinking less in terms of Independence Day and more along the lines of Battleground, Black Hawk Down, or The Hurt Locker. In other words, this movie is, first and foremost, a military sci fi flick, the likes of which we haven't seen since James Cameron's classic Aliens. This is a movie about war and the men who have to fight it battle by battle, and not about soldiers that have time for existential ponderings or deep discussions about the ""nature of war."" Nor is it about giant robots or befuddled Jedi warriors. Thank the maker!

Helping the movie is the fact that it looks and sounds great. The FX are impressive, so much so that I was surprised this wasn't one of those 80 or 90 minute smash and grabs, but rather a movie that just ran short of two hours. The visuals do an excellent job of bringing the war to life with vim and vigor, in the process creating some very memorable scenes. I particularly enjoyed the realization of the aliens, not that they were particularly original - there is a lot of District 9 to them - but the fact that they were the analogues of the US Marines. That is, unlike other movies that seem to get carried away by flights of fantasy when it comes to imagining an alien invasion, this movie stuck to it's mil sci-fi roots and imagined the aliens to largely function like their earth military counter-parts. So we get to see alien foot-soldiers, alien officers (taller than the rest), alien drones, alien aircraft, even an incredibly cool and realistically clumsy alien crew-served heavy weapon!

Likewise, the sound FX are well done, bringing the battle to vivid life with all the appropriate sounds of war, as well as some alien noises (I particularly enjoyed the 'pop-pop' of the alien reaction thrusters ). If you have a surround sound system, crank of the volume!

Lastly, I found the cinematography to be handled well - this is where I vehemently disagree with the critics who were won't to call it ""nauseating"". While I don't usually care for the shaky camera documentary style, especially when we are merely watching two men having a sedate conversation (as this movie does ), once the action starts, it does an excellent job of bring the battles to frenetic life. Between the audio and visual FX, and the camera work, the battles in BLA will have you on the edge of your seat.

So, what's not to like?

First and foremost, the length of the movie. It runs for 116 minutes, which is too short! I wanted to see so much more! I mean, this is a world-wide invasion! I can imagine all sort of interesting battles, missions, guerrilla actions, and alien autopsies (there is an impromptu one in here, though ). Two hours is just too short! Fortunately, the powers that be have let it be known that this is the first of a series of films. I hope we can look forward to Battle: NY, Battle: Paris, Battle: Tokyo (all mentioned in the film). I also wish them luck with any and all game tie-ins. Maybe we'll even get some books and a TV show?

But there is a more serious problem with the running length being too short. This movie tries to cram much too much into its running time, resulting in a movie that proceeds at a breathless pace. It runs so fast that as soon as the movie begins you feel as if you came in late and need to catch up on what you missed. This is a shame for two reasons:

First, the breathless pace hurts character development. BLA is not Aliens in that there are no memorable characters outside of Sgt. Nantz. This is because the movie spends a bare 10 minutes or so introducing them to us, reducing them to ""the guy getting married"", ""the friend of the guy getting married"", ""the raw recruit"", etc. Even Sgt. Nanzt, well played by Aaron Echhart, lacks serious development, which is a shame because he seems to have an interesting past involving a costly action in Afghanistan where he lost some of his men, an issue that will dog him throughout this film. The mere fact that after watching the whole film I am still hazy about just what exactly happened to Nantz is indicative of the lack of serious character development. The same goes for Corpsman (or, if you're President Obama, 'corpseman') Jibril Adukwu, a soldier of African decent who made for an interesting and likeable character. The movie needed some more time to develop these guys, but rather chose to rush off to war.

Secondly, I lament the films pace because it eliminates the opportunity to crank up the tension of the impending invasion. As with H. G. Wells classic story, as well as the two movie versions of his book, the best part of an alien invasion is knowing that it is coming and being unable to warn the characters in the film. Unfortunately, instead of the drip-drip-drip of slowly building tension and apprehension, BLA pretty much just does the equivalent of ""a weird meteor storm is coming....this means WAR!!!!"" >Sigh< So much wasted tension potential.

Another complaint is that is does borrow somewhat obviously from other films, particularly Aliens and District 9. For example, Michelle Rodriguez pretty much reprises the role of Pvt. Vasquez. What is more, there is a scene where the Marines take a LAV and start running over the aliens, including shooting one in the face during the process...sound familiar? And there is a District 9-esque buried spacecraft as well. Add in a demolished US airbase as in ID4, and you can pretty much conclude that when BLA borrows material, it does so unabashedly. Fortunately, most of this borrowing is in the last half hour, so it doesn't get too annoying. I guess they just started to run out of original material.

Lastly, the ending battle is a bit too contrived and rushed. I would expect an alien command center to be a tough nut to crack, but not here. It is painfully obvious that the film needed a feel good moment to end the story but was running out of time (or money), so they threw this together. The battle does have some good action to it, but it is ultimately yet another take on needing to shoot a photon torpedo into an exhaust shaft that is only three meters wide. Oh well. If Independence Day can be praised for its ""sci-fi tributes"", so can this film.

Now we come to the important question:

Why did the critics so hate this film?

I can only offer two possibilities, with the truth no doubt being somewhere in the middle:

First, this is a very patriotic movie. Here, the military men and women are portrayed as larger than life heroes, risking all to save their country. In fact, they are so heroic that, like Space Marines, they begin inspiring civilians to bravery in the face of the enemy. I have no doubt this ticked off more than a few of the more, er, cosmopolitan critics.

The second reason I think the critics disliked this movie is because of it's authentic mil sci-fi trappings. This is a film that has NOTHING in common with the juvenile sci-fi nonsense we've been force fed for years now. There aren't any teens running around with an ""all spark"" to save the world where the adults have failed (indeed, here we have the opposite where the older Sgt. Nantz keeps the kids in the fight and not vice versa), nor are they any lighthearted comedic moments to remind us that alien invasions can be fun, too. This is a largely grim movie (but could be grimmer - darn you PG-13!) about war. Quite frankly, I think most critics, lulled to sleep by years of fluffy Transformer and Star Wars/Star Trek flicks, just didn't understand what was going on. After all, the last real mil sci-fi we had was Cameron's Aliens...some fifteen years ago! That says a lot right there. I truly believe this film just confused the lot of them with its lack of after school content.

So there you have it, my review of Battle: Los Angeles. I liked this movie...really liked it. I liked it so much, that I encourage you to spend money on it via DVDs, BluRays, and VoD. The cast and crew of this movie deserve to be rewarded for making such an enjoyable film. But more than that, serious sci-fi fans need to step up and declare that if a studio has the courage to return to mature, old school sci-fi, they will be rewarded with cold, hard cash. By no means a perfect film, Battle: Los Angeles is nonetheless one worth supporting not so much for what it is, as for what it isn't.",1308441600,49,10467,4.548061603823686
4468971,1,B004ULEEY8,"After reading enough good reviews and having a liking for any kind of war flick, I decided to buy the film at my local Walmart. Since I watched the film in my living room, I could not walk out. Battle: Los Angeles is not a film as much as a video game, with video sequences that repeat in intent if not literally so, and audio and dialogue that DOES repeat. Often. Couple that with a lame minimalistic storyline and incredibly bad acting, and you have one of the worst films in a long time. If you are a fan of the original SF war film Starship Troopers, as I am, you will be sorely disappointed in this work which borrows extensively from better films such as Independence Day, War of the Worlds, District 9, and even Skyline. Not that it doesn't have some interest for film students. If you are fan of Avid film editing you will enjoy taking the sequences apart to see how modern editing can make something out of nothing.

We then started enjoying the supremely bad acting, moronic dialog, barely tolerable special effects for what we assumed it was meant to be: a FARSE a COMEDY!

The FX aren't bad, the action is non-stop, and other than the typical shaky camera nonsense that some movie directors think adds realism to military films, the only thing besides a steady hand holding the camera that could have improved this film would have been some female nudity.  The PG-13 rating is for violence and language.  A PG-13 rating says, ""Unless you're under 14 years old, you not only are familiar with violence and language, you probably contribute to it.""  As if the under 13 and under crowd are as innocent as lambs.  <ahem>  Anyway, Marines from Camp Pendleton trained the actors for this film, and there are some actual Marines in some of the footage.  There are also US Air Force and US Army personnel, but primarily the focus is upon the Marines.  Interestingly enough, the film was made in Louisiana, and images of Los Angeles were inserted by CGI later.  The movie is burdened with war clichs and choppy transitions that only action junkies can overlook; which is why the film ""Rango"" made this film drop to #2 slot a week after ""Battle: Los Angeles"" debuted when ""Rango"" premiered.  There isn't much that is brand new in this film, and many critics compare this film to previous war movies as if the impropriety of plagiarism was obnoxiously blatant in the making of ""BLA"" and I guess I just didn't care whether or not those accusations are legitimate.  What I care about most is why do the marketing people for this film automatically assume we want it to happen by them saying that Aaron Eckhart has said he is willing to appear in a sequel.  Sci-Fi management needs some new blood at the top I think.  There has to be more than US military fighting against alien invasion.  I could come up with better film making ideas than this stinker.

4468977,5,B004ULEEY8,"There's plenty of bad reviews for this film, from ""professional critics"" and actual people alike. For the former, if you have any experience you already know where to shove those. For the latter, it's more interesting.

If you look at most bad reviews, it's clear that people are panning the movie for being a very archetypal war action movie. Yes, it doesn't have much character development. Yes, it doesn't have a twisty plot or any particular surprises - the storyline is rather predictable. Yes, there's not all that much dialog, and a lot of action.

But, hello, guys? It's a WAR ACTION MOVIE! It's meant to be about shooting and blowing stuff up, spiced up with a bit of soldier camaraderie, self-sacrifice, and ""Now we're so mad we're gonna kick those guys ass! Hoorah!"" attitude - NOT about storyline or emotional development of characters or delivering some deep and thoughtful insight. If you don't like the genre, then why bother viewing it? You're not going to like it, precisely for the things that make it distinct. I hate sitcoms, but I don't go reviewing them telling how they such because of the stupid laughter behind the screen etc. It's just not constructive.

Now if you look at this from the perspective of its genre, then it's practically a classic - all the cliches and stereotypes of the genre are here in droves. If you enjoy that kind of thing, you won't be disappointed at all - it's a solid hour and a half of gritty action. Acting is good, camera work is good, and special effects are not overwhelming, but what's there is well done.

By the way - yes, for those who game, the movie does feel a fair bit like modern casual war games (like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, or perhaps more like Operation Flashpoint: Red River, if I was asked to pinpoint the closest living relative). That's no surprise, because that gaming genre arose from war action movie genre, and shares a lot in common with it. Nothing bad about it.",1308355200,7,1948,4.63768115942029

Skyline was an absolute bore, but this film was just action pack! And I am not a guy who like movies just for action. Don't get me wrong, I love a good movie that makes you think like, The Thin Red Line, and Apocalypse Now where it had limited action sequences. And I am a huge fan of movies such as Dr. Strangelove where most of it is dialogue.

This movie is an alien invasion film done right. For far too long I have seen movies that only show the civilian point of views where you only see the military in action very few times like, Steven Spielberg's War of The Worlds. I have been wanting to see a huge full on battle with tanks, helicopters, fighter jets, and infantry duking it out against invaders. This movie has it and it also shows the situation around the world, as it doesn't seem like the United States is the only one being invaded. The movie gets right to the point and doesn't drag on of the intro like Skyline did. That is where Skyline lost me. The intro didn't feel like an invasion film, and (SPOILER) the time it took for the aliens to arrive took too long! And the military response time was ridiculous! THREE DAYS! In three days we probably would have lost already if the military took that long to respond to an invasion!

So if you want to see a war-movie with non-stop action and tons of soldiers, tanks, helicopters, fighter jets, and ALIENS! This is the movie for you! Yes some of the dialog was typical cliche Marine language. What do you want? Thin Red Line where everyone was a Plato with guns! Don't get me wrong I LOVE Thin Red Line for being so poetic and artful, and just beautiful!

This can be atributed to the fact the marines are mostly green with only one ""old war horse"" to keep them focused. Another issue that my daughter pointed out was the fact that the aliens attacked Earth for the water. The movie claimed that liquid water can only be found on Earth. Liquid water can also be found on Europa, a moon of Jupiter. The fact the movie guys missed this science fact annoyed my daughter since the premise was ""Only Earth has liquid water"" -- not true.

As much as can be done in an action flick the characters are developed and the movie draws you in. THis overcomes some triteness and a somewhat formulaic war movie developement. Despite some gaps, this movie is more believable and more entertaining than Independence Day.",1308268800,7,1296,4.581896551724138
4468981,4,B004ULEEY8,"""Battle: Los Angeles""(2011) is directed by Jonathan Liebesman (The Killing Room). Aaron Eckhart stars as SSgt. Michael Nantz who helps lead a group of marines against an alien attack. This film is reminiscent of ""Black Hawk Down"" but with aliens instead of Somalis for enemies. A sweeping, heroic soundtrack that would have been at home in the film ""The Last of the Mohicans"" is often buried beneath the gun fire and explosions. The special effects are great and the action keeps coming. Some of the editing and jittery camera work initially feels choppy, but once the action kicks in all is well and we just hang on and enjoy the ride which is often compelling.

This blu-ray has many interesting special features about the making of the film.",1308268800,6,744,4.8125
4468982,3,B004ULEEY8,"Okay, first off this movie isn't that bad. The acting is okay and the special effects are pretty good. There really isn't any real plot to the movie except that aliens are invading the planet(think Independence Day). The action of the movie and battle sequences between the marines and the aliens are straight up Blackdown (if you've ever seen that movie). It's not a bad movie to watch once just to say you've seen it, but it definitly is no blockbuster. If you were a fan of Blackhawk Down or Independence Day, then you'll love this movie. I personally think that those type of movies fall in the category of "" Yeah, I've seen it and it was alright"". Bottomline, just another movie looking to cash in on action, aliens, and violence alone.",1308268800,,741,4.578947368421052

Loved another strong heroine in uniform, along with all the heroes.
Yeah, we've seen the premise before, but so what, highly entertaining,

4468984,4,B004ULEEY8,"Having read some of the reviews from top line critics (including the downright ridiculous one from Roger Ebert), I decided to given this film a chance through Wal-Mart's exclusive steel book release. This item includes a Blu-Ray disc of the movie with features and a second disc that is a standard DVD with just the feature (Probably identical to the disc that is availabe in a RedBox).

Jon Liebesman's fourth feature is his best, though that's not exactly putting the movie on a very tall pedestal. I really have wanted to get behind this guy because he really seems committed to creating strong genre films; unfortunately, his previous horror themed efforts (including the studio botch ""Darkness Falls"" and Platinum Dunes' ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre: the Beginning"") just weren't very good. His last feature, a DTV effort called ""the Killing Room"" was good enough that I was willing to trust Liebesman to take me through yet another alien invasion.

Lets get this out of the way early: ""Battle"" Los Angeles"" is NOT a great movie. It's not ""Platoon"" and it's not ""Aliens."" But this movie is an entertaining two hour ride that pulls together several eye catching action scenes around a central character conflict that--while not ground breaking--is enough to buoy a simple, straight forward story.

I found it refreshing to see a Sci-Fi movie that portrays the military as a group of honorable individuals that are still human. These soldiers are not emotionless plot devices or ham-fisted idiots: they act like REAL people. This is in sharp contrast to recent movies like ""Super 8"" or ""X-Men: Fist Class"" where the same tired 'corrupt military' plot thread is dredged from the grave to create a human antagonist for a fantastic story.

The style of the movie is akin to ""Black Hawk Down"" and used a lot of shaky-Cam. Some people really do not like this style of filmmaking, but I thought it was perfectly suited for this story and dutifully brought to life the ""frantic"" nature of the story.

The acting was mostly harmless with the exception of Aaron Eckhart, who did a phenomenal job in the central role. He did a dead on version of an uptight vet I know and the character was easy to identify with.

Not much is ever found out about the alien race beyond what is relevant to the characters we're following and while I would've liked to know more about the alien race (they had a unique look that reminded me of Black Manta), it was the better artistic choice to keep the viewer in the dark. Because we no so little, the aliens become more imposing. It also allows the characters to make suppositions about their situation and develop their personalities beyond broad stereotypes (most of them don't get much development; however, we are thrown into a combat situation fairly quickly and I thought they did an admirable job of giving the more important characters brief moments to thicken). The movie doesn't stonewall itself to force developing characters, which can be considered a plus or a minus depending on what you want in a movie.

In the end, this is just two hours of fun. I remember when I was a kid this was the movie I always wanted to see: Soldiers versus monsterous beings in all out combat. It's not ""Aliens,"" but it does more right than wrong and resists temptation to fall into the one cliche I hoped it would avoid: making the military look like nothing more than a bunch of immoral, heartless robots.

I can now honestly say that I'm looking forward to Liebesman's next effort and have a movie with his name on it that I can recommend to other people.",1308182400,8,3573,4.733118971061093
4468985,5,B004ULEEY8,"People reviewing this movie compare it with Independence Day, Blackhawk Down, etc. They say it's a cliche and nothing is new. Well I got news for you: we've been through more than 10,000 years of human history, nothing is new, everything is a cliche. I saw Independence Day, Blackhawk Down, and other notable war movies, but I enjoyed this movie just as much, here is why.

Being in the Army ROTC, I have a taste of what military brotherhood is like. Although ROTC is nothing, I mean NOTHING, like the real Army, the sense of brotherhood is still there. I also know the very (i mean really very) basics of squad and platoon tactics, and far as I know, the film makers of Battle LA nailed it when it comes to the portrayed realism of these ""Marines""; I had no trouble actually believing they were real marines.

Versus Independence Day, Battle LA felt more real. The sense realism came from the portrayal of the Marines as a team; the emotional journey every combat unit goes through during battles and missions. Yes, the movie is based on an alien invasion, but Battle LA focuses on the dynamic of the Marines and their strong bond of brotherhood; this movie shows the loyalty and sacrifices of a Marine to protect his fellow Marine, which is perfect portrayal of the real world. (I especially liked the portrayal of relationship between a senior NCO and a fresh 2nd lieutenant). My hat goes off to the film makers for the authenticity.

Don't make them look like Army; it just ain't right.  And yes I know my stuff, I was a Staff Sergeant in the USMC myself.

And I finally found a movie where I liked Aaron Eckhart! Michelle Rodriguez happens to be my favorite action lady. What more could I ask?
Well, if the director had not decided to unnecessarily introduce silly emotional moments that stretched far too long with lots of tears and brotherly love it could have deserved a 4 star rating easily.
That and the fact that the aliens were consistently undestructible till the end would have made it perfect. At the beginning of the movie it takes a whole platoon to take out one single alien. In the final battle, a few bullets are enough to kill them. C'mon I know our dear Aaron found a soft spot but how could it be so easy??
May be I am asking for too much but Battle: LA appears to be an aspiring movie. It wants to be something remembered (like District 9). You don't become iconic with this type of approach.
All in all, it could have been great but it isn't. Is it a waste of time? Hell, no. Put aside the grey matter just a little and you will enjoy the movie.",1308182400,,1152,4.240909090909091

Add it all up and darn it all, it makes for a really good war movie. The special effects are very good and the blu-ray copy is almost as intense as Saving Private Ryan in the Sapphire release.
Now that the price on the BD has slid a bit, I can only say that if you like a really well-done war movie that isn't intent on shovelling special effects at you, this is worth adding to your collection.",1308182400,3,799,4.517241379310345

pretty good. The first minutes of the film, shows us the characters and prepares
us for the movie by giving us a feel of the units. Most hand held camera shots
works, but because all of the shots in the beginning are hand held, some of these
shots looses their emotional glue on what we see because of the shaky camera.
 Like most wars, its easy to blow things up from the sky, but when you bring the
battle to the ground level, different tatics are needed.  The aliens are pretty
good, and have pretty good firepower and causes damage. I guess some people

I don't know why in 2011 that a brand new movie would come out and not be packaged with a digital copy.  Then have the AUDACITY to price it at $25!

I buy blu-rays at a rate that I can't possibly maintain but I feel that at $25 I need the BluRay, 3D, DVD and Digital copy and probably in steelbook form or blu ray sleeve (like Tron when it first came out).

4469017,3,B004ULEEY8,"""We are the last offensive force on the west coast. We cannot lose Los Angeles.""  After an assumed meteor shower becomes something much more dangerous, retiring Marine Staff Sargent Michael Nantz is part of a team to find out what is happening.  After discovering Alien spacecraft attacking the city the platoon is thrust into a battle to save the world.  I heard very bad things about this movie going in, and I have to say that most of it was a lie.  Though not as good as ""Independence Day"" this is one of the best invasion movies since that one.  After movies like ""District 9"", ""Monsters"" and the horrible ""Skyline"" this one is far and away the best Alien movie to come out in a long time.  If you like action this a a great choice.  The first 20 minutes is story, followed by an hour and a half battle sequence that really doesn't stop until the credits start to roll.  For a PG13 movie the war is pretty intense and fun to watch.  Overall I would say much, much better then I expected it to be, and action/sci-fi fans won't be dissapointed.  I give it a B+.

Would I watch again? - I might, but it wouldn't be my first choice for an invasion movie.

4469019,3,B004ULEEY8,I was pumped to see this when i first saw the trailer and although it didn't quite deliver on the extraordinarily high standard set for itself in the trailer i still enjoyed every minute of it and was genuinely riveted at times. First rate action and effects coupled with a  breath taking pace makes for great fun. A must for war and action buffs. If i had one complaint it would be a little lack of creativity in terms of the aliens themselves who you rarely get a good look at. Other than that pretty damn fun.,1307491200,,512,4.278350515463917
4469020,3,B004ULEEY8,"The movie was fast passed and full of action. I know a number of people suggested that the movie was too loud -I don't know about that, I mean it is a Sci-Fi War movie. Had it been silent I would have definately hated this film, so the explosions and all that wonderful action was fantastic. Some other viewers didn't like the dialogue, but I will have to agree with the people who responded to that criticism, you gotta know a Marine to understand -THAT IS HOW THEY TALK. I come from a military family, Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner table talk is very stimulating. I love the idea of alien invaders coming to earth to colonize and kill the current inhabitants, I am just twisted that way.  What makes me even more insane is that I like it when the Alien Invader is more advanced than us limited earthlings. And I felt like these aliens -although armed to the teeth and kicking serious arse -their techonology seemed a bit off the mark. There was something that didn't fair well with me. I am thinking back to Independent's Day, where nothing we did could face off with the enemy until someone with some brains stepped forward and then we got them.  I think that is it. I like when Earth is threatened by impossible odds and suddenly thinking outside the box leads us to a triumphant victory.  I loved when the Bombers came in, that kind of stuff is exciting. Of course the bravery and self sacrifice of the soldiers was awsome and the only criticism I have about the troops is how this movie seemed to down play Michelle Rodriguez. Anyone who knows anything about Ms. Rodriguez, knows that she is no joke. She is always tough as nails in her movies, and in this one, I felt like she was forced to hold back. Other than that, the cast was great. Usually I like movies like this, but something about this particualar film did not move me like the others.",1307491200,2,1857,4.439882697947214

There were aspects that I experienced that were toned down some, for obvious reasons, but anyone who was an infantrymen knows what i mean.  The story was surprisingly well done, though some of the dialogue was semi-cheesy.  I really thought though that this was a very well made and executed movie.  The CGI was very well done and not really noticeable.  The acting was also quite good, which was made possible by very good collaboration with the Marine Corps and the military in general.  The way in which Marine close quartrers tactics and operations were porteayed was extremely accurate.  The weapons, for the most part, sounded and behaved as they should and the gear usage and placement was also impressive.

Overall a must see war/sci fi thriller.  I look forward to more movies such as this in the future.  I cant wait for the Blu-Ray to come out in June so I can experience this great flick often.

4469033,5,B004ULEEY8,"First the bad news: BATTLE: LOS ANGELES was hated by 65% of Rotten Tomatoes critics.

Now the good news: I ain't one of them.

BATTLE: LOS ANGELES is about evil aliens attacking LA. This is a great movie. As a former Los Angelina, it was fun seeing the City of Angels destroyed by beings from another world. The action is well-paced and the military portrayals feel authentic. The characters are believable and engaging. Honestly, my husband and I really enjoyed watching this movie. When BATTLE: LOS ANGELES was over, we felt like we had just beaten the Soviet hockey team.

So why the negativity from the critics? My first thought was that they didn't like that this was a war movie, albeit against aliens. In fact, that's what one critic said. She seemed to think the filmmaker was sneaking her some Afghanistan V8 disguised as fruit punch. Hello! It's called BATTLE: LOS ANGELES for a reason! One critic said it lacks soul. Absolutely not! If you don't get even a little choked up, then it's not the movie that's lacking soul. Another critic complains ""Se fosse espremido e engarrafado, resultaria num perfume batizado como Le Phallus."" Uh, I don't know Portuguese, but Madre de Dios that can't be good.

Bottom line, I enjoyed BATTLE: LOS ANGELES much more than several other movies I've reviewed. If you like what amounts to an old-fashioned Western, then by all means, give this one a look.",1305763200,26,1397,4.760330578512397

Talking movies, I'd rate this higher than ""Starship Troopers"", ""War of the Worlds"" (latest version) or ""Independence Day"". ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" are better, in my opinion. If you haven't seen the movie, give it a go. I liked the serious take on events (meaning there are no comic-relief robots in this movie). The abilities of the aliens did seem to vary with the demands of the script, and some elements of the ""mission"" are dubious.

No idea, because you barely get to see one for longer than 10 seconds. Other than one that gets shot, it's just all war and shooting scenes with nothing else. Yelling, giving orders, no character development, although it tries. This movie is such a mess it's like it was spilled all over the screen, (or editing table), and no one could clean it up. Was so rushed they just shoved it out there like a dog given his food. So basically very little thought or effort went in to planning this film.

Aaron Eckhart was correct in his assessment of this as a ""war film"". You kind of forget that they're fighting an unknown alien army in a sense because the drama and story is so intense. The acting in this was excellent and you can really connect with the characters. If you want some silly skin and CGI, rent Skyline for a lighter version.

4469038,5,B004ULEEY8,"This movie tells the story of a small group of Marines, in a bad situation, in small place in time and in a limited scope to the actual ""war"", as they follow orders and hold fast to their honor, courage and commitment. As the father of a young Marine, I couldn't help but be emotionally moved to the point of saying to my wife that I really don't want my son to be in combat, knowing full well that he is trained and ready to the mission.

This movie isn't about the aliens as much as it is about these young Marines. The one waiting for his child to be born. The one who looks like he should still be in high school. The officer who has never commanded in combat. The one who is planning to be married. The one who suffers from PTSD. The veteran who is scarred by his past service. All cliches but certainly reflective of today's military service men and women. Open your eyes and see it for what it is. See the sacrifice and the committment. Committment to duty and to one another.

This is not a sci-fi film. It is a film that tells the story of our men and women who serve today, on US soil and foreign shores. It just happens to be in LA and have aliens. This film should make one feel proud of the men and women who serve and feel compassion for those families and military members who suffer great loss due to war. If at the end of the film you don't sit quietly for a moment or two to reflect on what you have seen then I think perhaps you missed the point.

No need to compare to other films, but if we must... Independence day was fun, Skyline was lame, District 9 was very good and intriguing, Black Hawk Down was very good as well. Battle: LA is one of the better ""war"" films out.",1305072000,197,1692,4.1057401812688825

4469040,3,B004ULEEY8,"Battle Los Angeles is not the best alien invasion or war pictures but it is watchable in a nerve racking way. It makes the hairs on your neck stand at attention and your pulse  to quicken.

Although the film dose uses the overused hurky jerky cinematography, is it able to give the audience a feeling of dread. Dread and foreboding and uncertainty  with smoky battle scenes and wide shots of Los Angeles on fire, that's what gives this movie its favor; a real American City that people have been to walked around in is on fire, overpasses are collapsed and there are bodies in the street.  Cyborg troopers stalk the streets and indiscriminately kill everything they come cross: men, women, children, civilian and military while unman drone aircraft patrol the skies and beat back American military might.

The Invaders don't use much super science, they aren't armed with any kind of particle or beam weapon. They use more advanced kinetic energy machine guns with quad mechs and hover tanks, there isn't a radio signal they can't track, making communications in the combat areas impossible and the cyborgs versatile bodies make them very difficult to kill.

The Invaders are in very similar ways similar to Harry Turtledove's Race in his ""WorldWar"" series of novels, advanced aeronautics, Faster Then Light travel, yet still relying on chemically propelled projectiles for most of their weaponry.

The actually plot of the movie is nothing special, a group of marines lead by a wet behind the ears lieutenant and grizzly veteran(Aaron Eckhart) are order to head to a police station in Santa Monica to evac any civilians that where cut off by advancing aliens before the military plans to level Monica because even though the invaders don't seem to have any air power at the moment in the film their ground forces are pushing the military back.

At the same time they come across an air force techhead (Michelle Rodriguez)who was tasked with finding the Invaders Command and Control before her unit was whipped out. The invaders are able to nuteralize Ameican air support, thus halting the bombing, and forcing Nantz and his squad to find the Invaders CnC cneter. The plot could have been easily used in a Roland Emmerich, film, but thankful Emmerich shameless uses of CGI is better aplied with dirty alien foot soldiers and war matchines scratch and dinged up, also Emmerich's character template of a misunderstood geek is thankfully absent. Instead we focuses on a small unit of foot soldiers who are at and behind the front lines.

The weak points of the film is that there is only one interesting character, Eckhart's  Michael Nantz is a sergeant with a shady past, having several men die under his command, including the brother of one of his squad mates, in a past engagement. There are some other  interesting characters like the Nigerian Corpsman and the Squad Leader Cpl.  Lee Imlay, (then again ""Alien"" had no character development either) but the movie was so fast past with each character only speaking one sentence at any given time.

Speaking of dialog, it is clichie.....and your problem is? What the hell did you except? Folks like Roger Ebert who spent no time in the military or don't know anyone who has service and view movies as an academic art form will of course hate the spoken lines in this film, because it's how soldiers in the battle field really talk, in short clipped sentences. Watch real battle footage on Youtube or Liveleak and you'll see the comparison.

Also the reason for the Invasion is really dubious, our water? Yes water could be used for fuel if you distill it down to harvest it's hydrogen and use that to generate electricity, but the earth isn't the only planet that has water on it. The moon of Eruopa is a giant ice ball and the Invaders could of easily set up refineries in the upper atmosphere of Jupiter and Saturn and began to siphon off hydrogen that way. All of which would be more cost effective then a military invasion of a planet because it has liquid water.",1304899200,5,4016,4.793053545586107

4469042,4,B004ULEEY8,"The best thing I'd have to say about this film is that it gives a pretty accurate depiction of how Marines act with each other.  I was a Marine and there aren't too many other films that even come close.  There are some simple detail errors they made (Marines don't say ""1400 hours"" for the time, they would simply say ""1400"") that they make but it's still quite accurate.

It's also a pretty intense movie once they go out into the city to, hopefully, find stranded civilians.  Even though the shaky camera bit was a little annoying at first, it didn't detract from the overall feeling of fear, especially before the Marines get to the Police Station, their first objective.  It was pretty on the edge of your seat waiting for the Marines to get ambushed by the aliens.  Overall, another worthy part of the film.

I'd have to say that the film makers must have decided that accuracy of how the Marines behave had to be one of their primary goals.  The other people they come across aren't much more than baggage for the plot line.  Aaron Eckhart gave an excellent performance as the Marine Staff Sergeant assigned to a new Platoon just before they move out against the aliens.

For being a ""war"" movie with aliens, it's great for it's combat intensity and all the noise; you get the impression that war is very loud in this movie!  I give it 4 stars for the simple fact that you won't find another Hollywood movie about Marines that depicts them so realistically, although ""Jarhead"" isn't too far off either.

4469048,2,B004ULEEY8,"This sucked. It cured me of the alien invasion craze. I was really into them, or so I thought. Independence Day, 10 stars. Cloverfield, 10. War of the Worlds, 9 stars (the original probably 5). Day the Earth Stood Still (the original) 9. Even the lowly Battlefield Earth and Skyline, 8 stars. . . I have now met an alien invasion movie I didn't like. If this film was intended to be some kind of recruitment-ad for the military the joke is on whoever financed the movie. Another reviewer writes that this movie only serves to make 'Skyline' look like an academy award winner.

There was one point in the movie where I did like it. When the rag-tag team figures out they need to destroy 'area X' and they finally have a mission, I just knew they would succeed. So do the soldiers. They have a mission and they're confident they are going to complete it. Lots of things will be blown up no doubt. This probably reflects badly on me, although perhaps I was just desperate to see anything entertaining at this point. In defense of the movie, it's probably tough being a shinning star covered by a giant NATO helmet. It is Hollywood, perhaps they should have used custom made/identical but scaled helmets rather than real ones.

The soldiers in the movie spend most of their time, not fighting aliens, but trying to protect and cover the escape of 4 or 5 civilians. They would have been better off given a map or pointed in the direction East. Perhaps I'm cruel and heartless but when one of the soldiers gets injured it seemed idiotic the whole team rallies to save them. It's surprising the aliens didn't wipe all of them out while they made the effort. In one scene we learn the aliens don't 'leave anyone behind' either.

I've been in a situation where I thought I might go to war, myself. What they tell you to get you to fight is not what you think it would be. You're going into combat as part of an effort to 'rescue corporal John X' who's been captured by the enemy. I suppose the unconscious message being leadership cares about you. Perhaps we feel guilty when faced with their superior morality, as they send us off to die in whatever numbers necessary.

Battle: Los Angeles could have been interesting. There was an Outer Limits episode where aliens capture Australia (it was really a love story similar to Casablanca). Another episode had the various nations on Earth more frightened of each other, their main concern being collaboration with the visiting aliens. Watching the commercial, I wondered whether the aliens from District 9 had returned, or, since their technology seemed similar to ours, if maybe the aliens intended to lose the war. Thinking we'd defeated them and seen their worst being the only way we'd let them 'stay' on Earth. This was as interesting as a World War I movie. It may have been based on one.

The water angle was almost interesting. There were some interesting parts in the movie. When one of the soldiers sacrifices himself to kill some aliens it reminds us (me at least) of suicide bombers trying to kill Western soldiers. They experiment with and kill one of the captured aliens (while they are in danger of being captured by his alien friends), I suppose if we're feeling guilty we feel better at the end when sarge becomes a hero. At the end, when the tide has somehow turned, and one says, 'lets take back Los Angeles', all I could think was, haha good luck with that my white brothers.

To take the ending more seriously, for a tiny moment - it would be interesting to compare the ending to All Quiet on the Western Front, where one of the characters is killed near the end of the war on a day only noted as 'All Quiet'. This movie has an aggressive ending, as did the invasion movie Skyline.

Us darn audiences are getting too sophisticated. . . they can't have us thinking we're being pacified as they set about on our extermination? And that they have, white Americans will soon be one minority in the country among many. Perhaps such a demographic split is only the beginning of being fair, nothing however, will stop white population decline in North American. No matter what's done or what happens, white population numbers will drop lower and lower for succeeding generations while most other racial groups increase in number. White numbers could eventually stabilize. I'm guessing it's unlikely, and something not desired by everyone. By some, yes, by some, less likely. For such a scenario I would suggest checking out the year 2022 and 'Soylent Green'.",1303257600,8,4510,4.644110275689223
4469049,5,B004ULEEY8,"This movie is possibly the best science fiction alien invasion movie, ever! The acting isn't bad, special effects are great, and it's unique compared to other alien invasion flicks. How so? Well, the aliens actually FIGHT, on the ground even! They aren't just appearing in ships frying everything in sight and they even show personality (they use tactics in battle and even try and save their wounded!). People ripping this movie apart for it being nothing but fighting need to have some sense put in them. This film is a science fiction film! Same thing for those of you who are so obsessed with ""dramatic"" acting. This is a science fiction movie, not The Notebook! It's like if I was going to go see Bambi and tore the movie apart for not having a fight scene. Movies are aimed at certain audiences. Any alien invasion film that goes deep into the characters' past/lives or does what critics want would be a horrible alien invasion film! I don't care about character A having a mid life crises or about character B's daughter with an eating disorder. I go to see a movie called Battle: Los Angeles to see some good ol' fashioned fighting! This movie does not disappoint and rather than it being a movie were the entirety of the human fight is based of the Air Force, this movie goes into what we learned in the early days of aviation development. That is, you cannot win a war by controlling the air alone. You want Earth? You're going to have to control the ground. This movie even requires the aliens to know how to fight because FOR ONCE the aliens don't have force-fields that protect them from anything and everything we fire at them. It's an actual battle for once! This movie was so original in the alien invasion genre that it ticks me off the these ""critics"" rip the film apart because there was no love story. Bottom line, if you like war or alien invasion movies then you'll love this one! If you don't like those kind of movies, you might still like it, but why are you even thinking of watching this then?",1303171200,10,2020,4.521857923497268

Probably not for the light hearted, those who long for romance novels or those like some movies critics trying to find the meaning of life in movies but wow, the action is great.  This movie should do for the US Marine Corp what Top Gun did for Navel Aviation and it is long overdue.

At the end of the movie in the theater I was in the audience clapped they were so proud.  Knowing that there is a tough and rugged combat group like the Marines that are there to defend us all is reassuring.  And this movie gives you a little bit of a glimpse into what it might be like if something like this really happened!

There is an old saying that you can please some of the people all the time or all the people some of the time but you can't please all the people all the time.  It is disappointing & sad that there are those among us who put this movie down.  I strongly suspect they are the ones who have never seen real combat and truly don't understand the sacrifice of putting your life on the line for your country and your fellow Americans of all ages, even the ones that are the jerks!  Bottom line thou is in trying to decide who is right and who is wrong about how good the movie is, it was the number one (#1) movie when it came out and stayed that way for weeks!  Bad movies don't become #1, period!

Every bit of the movie was right on.  For all those who think it wasn't as great as it is, sorry you couldn't find the meaning of life in this movie, that was not what it was meant to be about!  For everyone else, hang on your going to like this ride;-)",1303171200,6,1608,4.050632911392405

It is an almost uninterrupted orgy of noise and screams. After ten minutes I was totally exhausted. The characters are completely one-dimensional. Macho men running and shooting at everything that moves. They communicate by cliche oneliners. The storyline is as flat as the heartbeat of a recently deceased person. After fifteen minutes or so, I was so bored, numbed and fed up by it all that I ""switched off"", crept behind my newspaper and left it to my son and his friends to complete the viewing. From behind the newspaper I patiently endured the endless string of gunshots, explosions and shouted commands. Do not be fooled: there's hardly any science in this fiction, it's just a ""one-in-a-dozen"" war movie. I cherished the silence as almost never before when at last the TV set was switched off.

4469054,4,B004ULEEY8,"The Review:

Battle: Los Angeles looks to be staking its claim as 2011's action movie to beat, largely living up to its super intense preview trailers.  While Battle: Los Angeles is not particularly original or daring, it is an incredibly well made sci-fi action movie in the same vein as Cloverfield and the much maligned Skyline.  But where Cloverfield and Skyline put the audience in the shoes of civilians during an alien invasion, Battle: Los Angeles embeds the audience with a group of marines.

Battle: Los Angeles jumps right into the action - opting to forego a long build up.  It's present day Los Angeles and aliens are literally falling from the sky off the coasts of every continent.  These aliens do not come in peace. They have come to pillage our natural resources and have us severely outgunned.  The movie follows a group of marines on a search and rescue mission as the military plans to level a significant portion of the city to deny the aliens a beachhead for their invasion.

Now it's a testament to how well made Battle: Los Angeles is, that it's actually quite easy to suspend your disbelief.  This easy suspension of disbelief is thanks to Aaron Eckhart, who plays Staff Sergeant Michael Nantz, the de facto leader of sci-fi fantasy's answer to Band of Brothers.  Nantz has put in his twenty years and has seen a lot of tragedy.  Despite having all the trappings of a squared jawed action hero, Eckhart brings a lot of emotion and humanity to the role.  Yes, he kicks ass, but despite his seeming invincibility I was always worried about him and his marines.

Your enjoyment of Battle: Los Angeles will depend on your tolerance for the typical weaknesses in Hollywood disaster movies.  There will be a solid hour of ridiculous explosions.  At points I felt that I was watching someone play Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare.  And you kind of have to leave your critical thinking at the box-office to accept some of the typical action movie ingredients, such as the countdown until something will be blown up to further the plot.  Ask yourself, why do technologically superior aliens feel the need to land and fight our military forces house to house when their technology gives them the ability to drop meteors on us from orbit?  Why does the lynchpin of their diabolical plan have an easily exploitable weakness which the enemy can take dangerous advantage of?

But all this is nitpicking.  Battle: Los Angeles does not aspire to be nor is it the smartest action movie, but it does set out to be an immersive, though somewhat predicable alien invasion movie.  And as much as one can get one's monies' worth for a $13 movie ticket, Battle: Los Angeles is worth the price of admission.  Think of Battle: Los Angeles as a 21st century take on the movie Independence Day.

4469055,1,B004ULEEY8,"Luckily I bought this movie as a bootleg on the street for USD 1.25 - but you know what? I still took it back in disgust. I threw it at the guy and told him to stop selling that title.

I think it's the worst example of corporate film making ever...  Science fiction is supposed to have some kind of like science... ? Avatar, was good because they actually thought about the stuff to not make it ... you know mind blowingly STUPID.

SPOILER -

The alien army has crossed interstellar space to steal the oceans because 'liquid water doesn't exist anywhere else in the known universe' ??? Are you kidding? Was the science team from the 1940's?  of don't they think anyone pays attention if enough stuff is blowing up.

James Cameron hired professors from MIT, Harvard, Berkley and god knows where-( exo - biologists, linguists, future tech guys etc).  And they developed a compelling and novel vision of the future and an alien world that is also plausible. Avatar good/ Battle for LA - BAD.  I noticed in the credits that Levi Johnston was given a credit for 'Research and Book Lernin'. Really too bad because the idea of an advanced alien force trying to conquer earth could be fun to watch if someone had given it any kind of thought.

If you have an interest in film or becoming a film maker watch this movie and learn how bad a movie with no point but making money can be. Someone might have wanted to make a war movie here but the execs said it'd take in more money if it was mixed with Independence Day and Cloverfield.  I read the un-cut version actually also has a lavish wedding thrown in - that's what the early scene in the flower shop is setting up - Anyway it wound up on the cutting room floor after a lot of debate because it made the movie run over optimum length for seat turnover in multiplexes Thurs-Saturdays -  but that scene will be back in the Directors Cut DVD- lots of soul searching in the creative team on this issue since the female 16-35 year old viewer demographic has a very strong affinity to weddings with high end product placements.  Just messin around but this has to be the kind of creative process that turns out this junk.

The story is predictable and doesn't have one original idea or character.  I'll give the actors credit for trying to make this junk work but it was an impossible task.  Special effects?  Good but nothing ground breaking.  Certainly they don't save the movie.  I can't get over the awful writing here - we have the old standard characters with issues that were old and tired in the 1970's - the Staff Sargent who lost his squadron over Macho Grande and has lost his nerve.  They guy who is going to get married and looks moonily at a picture of his wife to be,  The kid who wants to get home and drive his Mustang until the wheels fall off.  Then their is Tex and  Brooklyn and Lagos ( ok the Nigerian soldier was something I'd never seen before, didn't have any real significance.  Assuming they owed an actor with a Nigerian accent a job.)  Oh and the fiesty hispanic helicopter pilot from Avatar is back playing the exact same character- seriously

Is it a patriotic movie??  No, just stupid.  Stupidity is not patriotism although they are more and more confused recently.  I saw one reviewer saying this was a 'kick ass Marine movie!'  - dude Marines aren't one dimensional stereotypes from cheesy 1950's movies.  This is an insult to all Marines.  The idea of trying to jam serious drama and soldier's deaths into this pointless money making vehicle is insulting.  The movie toys with serious themes by accident or left overs from some better script.. ?  They have the US Marines hiding from robotic alien drones.. but it doesn't really mean anything they don't explore that angle at all.  The aliens are semi robotic rip offs of District 9, so the parallels to Afghanistan or Iraq go no where.  The talking head in the film and the ads who goes on about 'An occupying army must exterminate the local population' - WTF?  The US is  an occupying army and we're not exterminating Iraqis and Afghans.  If anything a lot of soldiers are dying because our rules of engagement are designed to error on the side of not killing civies.  Again this whole aspect could have been interesting if written and directed by other people as is it's border line offensive.

I'd heard a lot of talk about this move.. not telling me it was junk... so I watched to the end waiting for some Sixth Sense type surprise at the end...like the aliens were us from the future?  anything ....  nope... I'd suggest maybe at 1 hour they suddenly cut to a scene of a brain damaged hillbilly  huffing gasoline in his shack and as he's coming out of a fugue with slobber and snot running all over his ketchup and puke stained Styx jersey  he says ""aaa gol dang it all it was just a stupid huffin' dream!' ' that be the duuumeest huffin dream I ever done had!  Sheet they brought an army through interstellar space fer some water?  They has got themselves a million bazillion space ships like we ain't never gonna have us in a 1000 years and go go like light speed but ain't got nothin' better than guns and rickety ass drones with fancy lights and smokin- blowin up bullets?'

4469056,1,B004ULEEY8,"""Battle: Los Angeles"" is a big, loud, stupid movie. That much is clear from the very opening. Explosions greet us in the first frame, and we have that instinctual feeling that those explosions aren't going to cease until the final one. After a few opening minutes of people running and screaming, and more explosions, the director (Jonathan Liebesman) seemed to remember that there needs to be a bit of exposition. BORING! Text across the screen then reads: ""Invasion- Minus 24 Hours"". What? You mean yesterday? Why ""minus 24 hours""? Whatever. So then we're introduced to the platoon that we presume we'll soon see fighting aliens. It plays as a checklist of soldier stereotypes, as opposed to real people that we might care about. Aging soldier who just got demoted, check. Young soldier who just got promoted, check. Soldier who lost his brother in combat, check. Soldier with PTSD who has to visit psychiatrist, check. Soldier who's a complete newb and is still a virgin, check. There's a lot of characters, each given a few minutes of screen time. I guess it's supposed to make us care about them, so that when they get shot at, and possibly die, we'll care. But none of them are particularly likable, and there's so many characters I had a hard time keeping track of them.

Meanwhile, the camerawork on display is some of the worst I've ever seen in a major studio release. It's done in the popular ""shaky cam"" documentary style, but for no particular reason. The framing is always a little off, or a lot off, with the cameraman seemingly just placing the camera at random places and starting to film. In other words, with this film, ""documentary style"" is code for ""bad camerawork"". The plot is also often hard to keep track of. I was actually paying attention throughout the whole movie, and still had a hard time keeping track of what their specific mission was at any given time. Basically, it begins with a cluster of meteor showers, harboring violent alien lifeforms, hitting off the coast of about 20 major cities across the globe. Soon after the invasion, Aaron Eckhart's platoon is sent out to go rescue some civilians from a police station. After that, they're basically cut off from the outside world. They can't travel by air, because the aliens have sophisticated drones piloting the sky, and they have to traverse across the city, shooting any aliens that get in their way.

Soon, with the help of an air force intelligence officer (Michelle Rodriguez), they discover that the flying drones that have been giving them problems are controlled by a large, floating control center. If their crew can simply take out the control center, the American military could stand a fighting chance of winning the battle. It never seems very realistic that these soldiers are faring as well as they do. The aliens in this film are vastly technologically superior, and it really doesn't make sense that they wouldn't be able to kill a few marines shooting from behind wrecked cars. At one point, the entire platoon (and a few rescued civilians) get on a large orange bus, and begin to drive through Los Angeles, while dozens of drones are flying overhead, shooting at other random stuff. Are they really too busy to notice the bright orange bus that's cruising by?

The dialogue is astonishingly bad. I would say that it seems like it was written by actual marines, but that would be insulting to the marines. Hoo-rah! ""Do you think they're extra-terrestrial?"" asks one soldier. Let's see: they came from space, and they're ALIVE. Yep, I think that counts as extra-terrestrial. But most of the dialogue is simply orders being barked, and affirmations being barked back. The words are often unintelligible, and seemingly unimportant. It's the intensity that they're yelled with that matters.

There are a few redeeming qualities, believe it or not, in ""Battle: Los Angeles"". First of all, it helps that the film isn't trying to make any sort of political message, besides maybe ""marines are awesome"". I'm so sick of sci-fi films trying to shove political or social awareness down my throat, it was kind of refreshing to see a movie that was just too dumb to care. Also the visual effects were pretty awesome, it's just too bad they didn't have a better team of camera operators to effectively film them. I probably went into this movie with too high of expectations. The trailer was awesome, but then again, so was the trailer for ""Clash of the Titans"". Like with that film, I couldn't help but feel slightly duped, having been lured into a film simply because I thought it looked cool. But unlike ""Clash of the Titans"", this one was actually enjoyable. If you're into seeing the world explode without having to think about anything, this movie is definitely recommended.

4469059,1,B004ULEEY8,"""Battle: LA"" is one of the biggest wastes of celluloid I have witnessed in a long time. Many filmmakers have made the same mistake and have got to learn the lesson of this film: All the special effects in the world will not make a film interesting if you don't care about the characters.

During the film's first 10 or 15 minutes, we are introduced to a variety of Marines stationed at Camp Pendleton. As each appears on screen, a title appears giving us their rank and name. And we watch each for a minute or two as we learn the one thing we will learn about them. One guy is planning a wedding and his fianc&eacute;e is getting her way with every decision. One guy is a virgin. The new Lieutenant is a NEW Lieutenant and feels nervous. Everyone else just sort of blends into the wood work and we quickly forget who they are. As each of these introductions occurs, our attention is also partially diverted by the constant news pieces on the televisions in the background - meteors are predicted to hit Santa Monica in 24 hours. The only character we spend a 'significant' amount of time with is Staff Sergeant Michael Nantz (Aaron Eckhart). Eckhart is the lead and the most recognized actor in the film, so we spend the most time with him. His story is our entry into this film. There is a lot of talk about how the Staff Sergeant lost the men in his platoon in Afghanistan. So when he joins this new platoon under the New Lieutenant, the men are dubious and don't trust him.

As soon as the aliens begin their attack, the platoon receives new orders. They are to make their way to a police substation in Venice and help the civilians who are trapped there make it out the 'Strike Zone'. They have three hours to accomplish this mission before the government begins dropping bombs on Santa Monica in an effort to kill the invading alien forces.

So, for the next hour and some odd minutes, the platoon battles an endless onslaught of aliens. The Marines shoot guns, grenades, rifles, grenade launchers, pistols, fire throwers, whatever they can get their hands on at the aliens as the men try to stay alive, try to stem the onslaught of the invaders and try to get to safety. But the aliens are relentless.

And the battle is relentless. The gunfire, explosions, fighting and violence never seem to end. It just never stops, never pauses, never gives us a moment to learn about the characters in the film.

Every line of dialogue is shouted. How else would we be able to hear them say anything with the cacophony of noise going on?

When they reach the police substation, some civilians join the group. This is supposed to make us feel empathy for the entire group, to make us care about their fate. But it is difficult to do this when you know nothing about the people. Really, all they do is add more noise, crying, shouting, exclaiming. Michael Pena plays a dad trying to keep his son alive. Bridget Moynahan plays a civilian female. Presumably, she is meant to counter the uber-butch female Marine played by Michelle Rodriguez.

""Battle: LA"" would be a much better film if the aliens were even the least bit interesting. I really think there are only three different kinds of aliens in the film. These all make an appearance very early and then simply seem to multiply. In a better film, the Marines would face a specific type of alien, make some headway, than face a bigger alien, or a more threatening alien. This would ramp up the suspense and keep the viewer involved. But that is what would happen in a better film, not in ""Battle: LA"".

Many of the shots and ideas look as though they are lifted directly from the far, far better ""District 9"". In fact, the film is very, very similar, in many ways, to the very bad ""Skyline"" released late last year. The aliens look similar, their mission appears to be similar, their actions are almost exactly the same. Even the geographic location is very close. This very bad film can't even be an original bad film.

Actually, the worst thing about this movie might be a statement in the ads. ""It's Only The Beginning."" Presumably, that statement means if this piece of trash is deemed financially successful, we can expect other ""Battles"". It doesn't seem possible to me, but I recently learned they are already making a sequel to ""Clash of the Titans"". If that film was deemed sequel-worthy, we are definitely going to be subjected to more ""Battles"".

At the end of the screening I attended, people in the audience clapped. I was puzzled but realized they must have been thankful the film was finally over.

I should have given a standing ovation.",1301356800,18,4598,4.5612121212121215

Who would be the initial responders?"" These are questions I have often wondered myself every time I watch the typical alien-invasion movies, whether it be ""Alien"", ""Predator"", or just any other alien movie ever made. Being in the military myself, I tend not to watch goofy alien-invasion movies where they have B actors portray men and women in uniform. I mean, seriously, the United States Marine Corps is the best trained conventional force in the world. They see something as horrific as an alien invasion, something that no one is prepared for, and they go TO the fight. It is what they do, no matter what the opposition is. In this case, the fight was nothing like the Marines have encountered in the past, since these aliens are armed and equipped with farly-superior weaponry and body armor. Marines are taught to improvise, adapt, and overcome any obstacle set before them. For example, there is a part in the movie where the platoon leader (fresh out of ROTC) leads the Marines into an alley with no exit. It's an ambush. There is no exit. What do the Marines do? They make their own exit. I watched this movie the other day, and I realized - if LA (or any city for that matter) were ever attacked by aliens, this is exactly how conventional ground forces would react to the situation. What is really amazing is the amount of cooperation the production company received from the Marine Corps (and you can tell these actors were coached by real-life Marines). The acting may have been second rate, and not on the same scale as other ""masterpiece"" movies made these days. But it's a movie that is as close to reality minus the whole ""alien invasion"" thing.

4469064,3,B004ULEEY8,"For anyone who enjoys a nice popcorn-eating action movie in the theaters, I would recommend this. It was far from War of the Worlds in terms of acting, entertainment, story, etc; but it's definitely worth watching if you're like me and those alien invasion-type movies entertain you. Without spoiling the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it, I must say that it seemed very ""empty"" by the ending, and seemed to have left out a lot of other key subjects in the movie. That's why it's not a 4-star or 5-star movie in my option. I'd rate it 3.5 stars if I could though, as I enjoyed it, but have definitely seen better movies.

But I must say, that this movie deserves a lot better of critic reviews from Rottentomatoes. It really isn't as bad as some critics perceive it to be.",1301097600,,774,4.450704225352113
4469065,4,B004ULEEY8,"With Battle: Los Angeles I expected a lot of CG effects and little plot. It was refreshing to find that the film concentrated more on the characters than glitzy effects.  This is a war movie. When Earth is invaded by aliens there are no questions about have they been watching us or what they want. The marines at the center of this drama are only concerned about their objective: rescuing civilians caught in the middle of the battle.

Battle: Los Angeles has at its core a standard story of redemption. Sgt. Michael Nantz (Aaron Eckhart) led his squad on an apparent suicide mission where he was the only survivor.  He is shunned by fellow Marines as a pariah and, in the opening scene, submits a request for retirement.  When the alien attacks begin, Nantz is assigned to serve under a newly commissioned Second Lieutenant William Martinez (Ramon Rodriguez). The other members of  the platoon resent Nantz and think he would get them all killed.  This is particularly true for Corporal Jason Lockett (Cory Hardrict) whose brother was killed in Nantz's prior mission.

As is standard for this kind of film, we get a brief glimpse into the lives of the characters. We discover that Lt. Martinez's wife is expecting a baby; another soldier is planning his wedding.  There is just enough information to provide a little insight.  The approach of the filmmakers was to take the point of view of a squad of soldiers.  Like them, we are unaware of what kinds of creatures have invaded Earth, what their weapons are and how the battle can be won.  Battle: Los Angeles could have been very mediocre but for the excellent performance of Aaron Eckhart. He perfectly conveys the guilt he carries for being a survivor and the ends he is willing to go through to prove himself to the squad and his lieutenant. Michael Pena plays a civilian who is rescued by the squad along with his young son, nicely played by Bryce Cass.  Brigit Moynahan is good in a small role as a vet who discovers how to kill the aliens.

In all, Battle: Los Angeles will probably remind you of other war films but it has enough suspense and good performances to keep you on the edge of your seat. The CG effects are good and are not used for mindless dazzle.",1300838400,9,2221,4.606598984771574
4469066,4,B004ULEEY8,"First of all, this is not an Original Movie like the name of the production company ""Original Films"" would lead you to believe.  The plot is the same as we have seen, Alien Invasion for our resources.  In a bit of an original twist, they are after our WATER instead of oil or metals.

They come in a typical manner, as meteorites and they invade large coastal towns.  The US Marines are the focus of the military operation in this film as usual.  By the time the World realizes they are being colonized, the only major city left to defend is LA.

AWSOME CGI and AMAZING battle scenes make this film worth seeing...",1300579200,3,614,4.389380530973451
4469067,3,B004ULEEY8,"Alien invasions have been a tried and tested theme in Hollywood ever since its B-movie inception back in the 40s, but with the advancement in technology and film-making techniques, making a movie of this genre believable and credible should not be a difficult task for the new generation of directors. Unfortunately this particular area of disaster movies has been seldom explored ever since the boom in the VFX industry. Battle : LA promises to bring realism to the alien world invasion backdrop and it succeeds to a certain point. Except, mashing up of two different genres--war movie and alien disaster movie--renders it a rather confused pile of yesterday's pasta.

Taking obvious cues from much superior movies like Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan, Jonathan Liebesman tried to do what directors seldom reflect on in disaster movies--the psychology of the combatants and the relationship dynamics within the squad. But the little thought and reflection that went into developing personalities of the soldiers as depicted in the movie is painfully obvious. The director decided to base the entire movie on a particular squad that rose up to impossible odds against a faceless (literally) enemy, an enemy that could easily have been anything--another invading superpower or just some deranged superheroes holed up underground. The enemy was only vaguely introduced, and that is not necessarily a bad thing, but this movie had a way of making that work to its disadvantage.

Performances of various actors seem fit for stock characters that are obligatory fares in a war movie, but a big shout out to Aaron Eckhart, who really brings his superior acting skills to a hodgepodge mess of bad actors. The action sequences are well-executed but could have done with some more realism and better editing. Visual effects and creature design was sub-par, explosions were not that frequent to distract people from the lacklustre storyline and the gunfights lacked a certain intensity for a movie dealing with realism.

All in all, the movie should be recommended to only those people who get a kick out of realism in their sci-fi movies, and who really needed something better to watch after the horrendous pile of rubbish that was the earlier release ""Skyline"".

4469069,1,B004ULEEY8,Nice marketing but a truly awful film that hardly shows any alien action.  Avoid this.  You have been warned.,1300233600,15,109,4.684210526315789
4469070,3,B004ULEEY8,"One thing you can say for Battle: Los Angeles - the film delivers exactly what the trailer promises:  lots of jarring, rousing combat action in a sci-fi alien invasion setting where you always know exactly what's going to happen and all of the characters are the same stock ones you've seen time and again in countless other war films ever since John Wayne hit The Sands of Iwo Jima (1949) and James Cagney learned What Price Glory? (1952).

There's no point going into detail on the plot.  I mean, how many ways are there to say 'marine platoon fights alien invaders in urban setting'?

And while the talented cast - Aaron Eckhart (Rabbit Hole, The Dark Knight), Michelle Rodriguez (Avatar), Michael Pena (Crash, TV's The Shield), Jim Parrack (TV's True Blood) and others - do a fine job with the roles they're given, the script calls up just about every possible cliched war movie character there is: Cliche #1, the grizzled sergeant haunted by memories of men he lost (who also happens to be Cliche #2, the soldier who was just on the verge of getting out of the service when the crap hits the fan and he's pulled back into duty). Cliche #3, the green lieutenant who has to be taken in hand (who also serves as Cliche #4, the soldier whose pregnant wife is about to have their first child). Cliche #5, the virginal baby-faced private who you know from the moment you see him is a dead man walking. Cliche #6, the soldier who's about to get married when the crap hits the fan. Cliche #7, the soldier who carries a grudge against the sergeant for a brother he lost. Cliche #8, the plucky female marine from the air wing who kicks serious butt. Cliche #9, the medic everyone calls 'Doc' who hopes to become a real doctor some day. Cliches #10a & 10b, the civilian boy whose father ends up dying and asking the sergeant to promise to save his son. About the only cliches missing are the prostitute with the heart of gold and the idiotic staff officer who gets people killed from sheer stupidity (though even money will get you that they're probably on the cutting room floor somewhere).

On the plus side, when the action is moving, Battle: Los Angeles is great and you completely forget about the predictability and the cliches (a considerable accomplishment, all things considered). Though highly derivative of both Independence Day and District 9 (and Saving Private Ryan for that matter), Battle: Los Angeles does have a gritty, realistic feel to it and the tension is palpable and constantly being jacked up. The movie does a good job of getting the feel of what it would probably be like for a marine unit with conventional weapons having to fight off attacking aliens with otherworld tech. The moving camera effects do make things confusing and hard to follow at times, but given the often chaotic nature of actual combat, this actually adds to the overall realism. And frankly, this film really needs the chaos and the breakneck pacing because if you ever stop to think about what's happening, you start to ask questions that make everything fall apart.

As it is, there are too many poignant lulls in the action where various characters must reinforce their cliches with emotive speeches or declarations. It's those moments that make you start wanting to pick up the nearest weapon and join the aliens in shooting at them if only to make them stop talking and start moving again.  Even Aaron Eckhart, who otherwise does an excellent job of bringing some life to the cliched character he's been given to play, succumbs to this in an over-the-top emotive recitation of the names and stats of all the men he lost that goes on so long that all of the other characters are left with nothing to do but stand and wait until he's done (for some reason, the aliens never attack while characters are emoting, even though you wish they would).

Only slightly less annoying are the moments when the talking-heads of experts appear on the news to explain why the aliens are doing all of this. The reality is that the audience for this kind of film doesn't need to know and in fact doesn't care why the aliens are invading; they just want to see the good guys kicking alien butt. Especially since the ostensible object of the invasion (our water?) turns out to be something so stupid it feels like it belongs in a satire like Dr. Strangelove rather than what's supposed to be a serious movie. On hearing it, all I could think about was Colonel Jack D. Ripper's famous rant about Commies going after ""our precious bodily fluids"".

It is in fact the talking heads that point out the movie's core fallacy.  They claim that the aliens' objective is one of colonization and that this requires killing off 'the indigenous population' (i.e. humanity). If that were so, then _why_ would they bother with a standard military invasion (air cover, bombardment, establishing beachheads, sending in ground units, etc) when they could accomplish a great deal of the same goal with almost no risk at all?  I mean, they're coming from _outer_space_!  In the words of Robert A. Heinlein who had the idea over fifty years ago, all they'd have to do is 'drop rocks on us'.  A few well-targeted asteroids nudged in our direction and hitting the ocean would've wiped most of coastal California clean before the first alien ship would reach the ground.  Think the recent tsunami in Japan (and the one a few years ago that hit Thailand and Indonesia) and then multiple that a hundred times over.  Think dinosaur extinctions. Of course, that wouldn't make for much of a war movie. Plus the fact that that particular movie's really already kind of been done (Deep Impact - 1998).  Like I said, you really don't want any lulls in the movie where you can start thinking about things like this.

But all that said, if you like adrenaline-pumping scifi combat action films and can handle putting the rest of your brain on auto-pilot for two hours, then I can recommend Battle: Los Angeles as worth seeing. It's a good high-tension ride for the most part, even if the ending is as suspension-of-disbelief hokey as Independence Day and admittedly most other films of this sub-genre tend to be.",1300147200,30,6156,4.690454124189064
4469071,5,B004ULEEY8,"First off, and Ill probably get flamed for it- I enjoyed Independence Day. It was a fun popcorn movie if a bit on the campy side. In my opinion, camp has a place in Hollywood just as much as serious fare and try to tell me watching the aliens getting their asses kicked at the end wasn't a rush.

Now on the flip side, we have Battle: Los Angeles. No silliness, lasers or crusading presidents. Instead we have a platoon of trained marines doing their job. The authenticity of their demeanor and weapons usage (thanks to their actual marine training) shown through every frame. Within the first few minutes you actually believe they are the real deal.

I also appreciated the ""authentic"" look of the aliens. No sleek fighters, laser guns or big headed aliens, these buggers are a nasty melding of organic and mechanics almost like marines themselves (a view shared early on).

Interspersed through the proceedings, it is revealed or at least placed forward what they want and how they intend to get it. Of course they didn't take into consideration the chutzpah of the US Marines- a mistake they pay dearly for.

As a Scifi connoisseur and lover of authenticity in war movies (Platoon, Saving Private Ryan etc) this is by far the most real feeling alien invasion movie in memory. Watch it and by the end, you'll be almost as exhausted as they are.",1300147200,9,1346,4.642857142857143
4469072,4,B004ULEEY8,"I caught ""Battle: Los Angeles"" this past weekend (wife opted out). It turned out to be an agreeable, watchable alien invasion movie. To tell the truth, though, the battle action and war spectacle were pretty generic and didn't have much to do with the fact that the invaders were aliens from another world.

For the most part, with the exception of an occasional glance at an alien soldier or one of their flying drone ships, the invaders could just as well have been the Red Chinese. In short, during the course of the movie, the emphasis was pretty much on how cool and brave the U.S. Marines were. Which was fine. Just don't go looking for a long, detailed look at an imagined alien culture, and you might not be disappointed.

Further, a movie like this definitely goes to show you the value of a good actor. Aaron Eckhart (he was Harvey Dent, a.k.a. Two-Face in ""The Dark Knight"") plays a battle-scarred sergeant who helps a group of Marines undertake a rescue mission. Eckhart's portrayal- earthy, tough, heartfelt- makes you forget you're watching a big special effects movie and gets you to genuinely care about his and his soldiers' fates.",1300147200,5,1148,4.735
4469073,4,B004ULEEY8,"Battle: Los Angeles is a film of epic proportion. It does not settle for anything less. It has an epic John Wayne hero in Aaron Eckhart. His  character concludes that he wants to leave the service, and epically says that all the promotions and the glory was an interest of  the past. The film has an epic young Platoon leader, Lieutenant that Michael Nantz. The film has epic aliens which are so various that we often think they came from a planet which was epically advanced. So advanced that they lack the usual lobes of the brain, and ordinary organs. They have an epic Command and Control which like an elevated island. The film has epic scenes of sacrifice from a to-be father and a civilian. It has epic close-ups filled with as much emotional intensity as a McDonald's meal has calories. Aaron Eckhart looks at Corporal Jason Lockett, and epically remembers his fallen brothers information that you assume he had committed identity theft. It has an epically intriguing and well-developed hypothesis (NOT) about why the aliens are attacking the globe, and firstly Los Angeles. I may be the loner in this, but I believe they were hunting for Walt Disney's Oscars.

Before  Staff Sargent Michael Nantz can retire, he must undergo this last mission which unlike his last, is larger than a middle eastern country-it involves the entire planet. Under young Lieutenant William Martinez, their Platoon is supposed to empty the city before the bomb raid against the belligerent aliens can begin. Unfamiliar with the enemy, obviously, this turns out to be a larger than life mission which the faith of the platoon is dependent on a handful of men.

The first paragraph was fun to write, but it also rings true about the spirit of this movie. This film is meant to be seen on a large screen-theater or huge TV. The film maybe spends about a minute and a half giving us a half hearted hypothesis concerning the point of this invasion-from the view of a CNN correspondent. This film is visual candy. It is explosions of the highest order given to you from Jonathan Liebesman who in private must admire Michael Bay, or know that he is indebted to the master's mindless action. Like Pearl Harbor which took itself too seriously, with its clichd dialogue that was inspirational in the fifties, I believe that Battle: Los Angeles thinks it's a love letter to the men and woman who serve selflessly, and with so much responsibilities back home are still willing to sacrifice their existence for their country and its glory. Like many similar films, this is wishful thinking. The film knows deep down it is their to entertain, and that's all it does, and does it well. Very few films can escape my writer's mind with such a minimal plot, and still make me enjoy them thoroughly. This does because of two elements: the swift, engaging action scenes, and Aaron Eckhart.

The film knows that the key to its success are the actions sequences, and it does not disappoint. The action is swift, fun, engaging, and often believable. No superhuman emerges that can put this aliens in their place-this is not a battle of wits versus brute identifiable power. From Nantz to the civilians, everyone is lucky and fortunate to survive. The film does not hide the fact that the alien forces are superior in their arsenal, and were it not for an eventual revelation from Nantz, they would destroy us and inhabit our planet. To its most minute details, the film is realistic about the faith of our characters. Michael Nantz does not survive because he is superior to the rest of the Platoon, but besides being and courageous side, he was very lucky. So, were the rest of the survivors. However, even the men who are unlucky, pass on because of their bravery. Were it not for courage, Joe Rincon would have darted out of the alien's way, and grown old watching his son become an adult. He chose the less glamorous way, but one which showcased his selflessness in front of everyone.

The other element is the indispensible Aaron Eckhart. On a review of Basic Instinct 2, Roger Ebert said (I'm paraphrasing) that only someone of Sharon Stone's caliber could play this cardboard seductress. In the same vain, I don't believe anyone but Eckhart could stare into the camera and deliver his lines with so much enthusiasm and seriousness. It is not often difficult to be authentic in serious drama, but when dealing with a cheesy alien invasion like this, only an absolutely phenomenal actor can pull of a good and convincing performance. Besides being emotionally suitable for the role, Eckhart disheveled look also fits a man who tired of conflict and war, is sprung into of the most barbarous military encounters. The other performances, including Michele Rodrguezes', are also authentic, but the weight of the film is on the shoulder's of Eckhart.

Though the film at times takes itself too seriously, deep down it knows who its out to service and entertain, and it delivers for the audience. Critics have not been harsh on this film, for there are serious gaps in the plot, to be honest. For example, the alien's reasons for invading earth is not implausible, but it so marginally discussed that one tends to believe that it seems to be taken from the first draft. However, I don't believe that the makers were oblivious to the problems, but they seem to have embraced the shortcomings. Often when filmmakers embrace underdeveloped aspects of the script, and emphasize other secondary elements, it can come off as lazy and boorish. Yet, here, the action is so well done, and the characters are so believably cheesy, that it appears like they hit their goal of entertaining the masses on a Saturday afternoon.",1300060800,5,5676,4.790602655771195
4469074,3,B004ULEEY8,"Battle: LA is about what you would expect from a big action spectacle that wasn't quite good enough (at least to the money hungry studios) to make the summer movie season cut. In some ways it's even better than a handful of the supposed blockbusters of the last couple of years.

From basically the start of the film we are thrown right into the action. Aliens have come to Earth and want our water. Wow, how original. There isn't much time for character development here, but Aaron Eckhart does the best with the limited material. Michelle Rodriguez is underused and given nothing more than a few cheesy lines.

The CGI is far from jaw dropping, but it doesn't look too fake and the less is more approach serves it well. The aliens themselves are a little on the boring side, mainly because their weaponary and fighting styles are almost identical to our own. The shaky cam is once again overused. It would have worked in moderation in order to put the viewer inside the action, but it became increasingly annoying. The dialogue is eye rolling inducing in spots and the emotional parts were on the typical and sometimes corny side, but overall Battle: LA is worth checking out for it's realistic approach.

I saw the terrible Skyline in late 2010, and it is even a more laughably bad Sci-Fi invasion movie when compared to this one. The Syfy channel also released their ultra so bad it's hilarious version, Battle: Los Angelos (can your title be any more similar?) this weekend. At least the latter of the two is intentionally horrid.",1300060800,4,1535,4.677777777777778
4469075,5,B004ULEEY8,"This is a movie that really isn't anything new. In fact, if you seen Black Hawk Down and District 9, it may look familiar. What this film does that makes it so great is that it can combine these elements together so well, that you really can't believe that this hasn't been done before. They made the right choice by including a Marine platoon into the script, rather than some nameless group of soldiers or whoever wears a uniform so that Johnny Civilian can get the picture that they are U.S. troops. It isn't the most perfect depiction of Marines, as I was one and remember the ""F"" bomb being used a whole heck of a lot more frequently, but it is passable. Aaron Eckhart really does a great job in his role as a battle tested Staff Sergeant. I think anyone else playing this character would have a hard time pulling it off exactly how he did. The rest of the cast is not all that bad either, given the scope of the story. And I am not a fan of Michelle Rodriguez, but she was tolerable- for the most part.

You have to remember that this is a movie about an alien invasion, it is not mona lisa smile. You have probably seen these movies before, but not like this. This is urban warfare fighting in the streets of downtown Los Angeles. It's fun and exciting, and better than half of the other ""realistic"" war movies that are already out. I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes sci-fi and military movies. You won't be disappointed. The critics have taken a proverbial dump on this movie, but what do they know anyway. This is exactly the movie I expected it to be when I walked in to the theater, and a little bit more with some character believability and Aaron Eckhart's acting. I will be eagerly awaiting the Blu-ray release so that I can watch this all over again in HD in the comfort of my living room. So suspend your rational thought process for a bit and enjoy Battle: Los Angeles for what it is; a science fiction war movie. Hoo-Rah.",1299974400,336,1954,4.353424657534247
4469076,3,B004ULEEY8,"First off, I want to say that I didn't find this movie to be all that bad, but at the same time it still wasn't very remarkable and certainly has quite a few glaring flaws in it.

[SPOILERS!]

PROBLEMS WITH THE STORY:
So here's the setting: In the movie it is well-known that the whole WORLD is under attack from these aliens and drones, yet our military, in spite of the fact that we are at an obvious technological disadvantage, decide to wait THREE HOURS to launch a bombing run on an area that in three-hours time may no longer be of any tactical importance? I think any general would bomb sooner and look for survivors later--especially when the fate of the whole PLANET is at risk.
At the end of the movie, we win by shooting one wimpy missile at a ""Command Center"" which causes all the flying drones to INSTANTLY fall out of the sky.
If Hollywood knew anything about drones they'd know that they don't just fall out the sky like rocks when the ""command center"" gets taken out.

LONG, LOUD AND TEDIOUS:
Those three words sum up my feelings about this movie rather well.
Now the movie is only about two hours long, but the pacing makes it feel longer than it is. I remember that towards the beginning there was a huge chunk where it was nothing but loud battle-sounds and pure action. When there is finally a break in the action, not only do you recognize this visually, but you can almost hear your ears give a sigh of relief after such an assault--one that starts back up again a little bit later.
As for the shaky-cam, it makes it extremely frustrating trying to SEE what is going on. Most notably towards the action-packed beginning of the movie. Have fun watching a red triangle cross-hair bounce all over the place and getting blurry glimpses of drones that look like scrap-yards and aliens that look like escargot.

SAVING GRACES:
On the positive side, I found the main character to be really interesting and felt that he did an excellent job acting his part. There are also a few gems of dialogue: One happens after a girl gets slimed in the face by a dead alien. Another good one is towards the very end and has to do with breakfast.

OVERALL: Metacritic currently has this movie rated at 36 out of 100. I don't think I'd go that low. Something closer to 50 out of 100 is what I would rate it--assuming you see it in theater and only see it once. When this movie comes out on DVD I certainly have no plans on buying it, but for your typical alien invasion action movie, it's not too bad.",1299974400,6,2501,4.393088552915767
4469077,5,B004ULEEY8,"Roger Ebert wrote an inadvertently hilarious review of this movie in which he explained his is  star rating thus:

""`Battle: Los Angeles' is noisy, violent, ugly and stupid. Its manufacture is a reflection of appalling cynicism on the part of its makers, who don't even try to make it more than senseless chaos. Here's a science-fiction film that's an insult to the words `science' and `fiction,'""

And then finished with these generous words:

""Young men: If you attend this crap with friends who admire it, tactfully inform them they are idiots. Young women: If your date likes this movie, tell him you've been thinking it over, and you think you should consider spending some time apart.""

Well I can't speak for Mr. Ebert's date, but my wife couldn't keep her hands off this Marine after seeing the movie.

What's so amusing is that ""Battle: Los Angeles"" isn't about senseless chaos or science fiction at all.  It's about Marines.

In fact, the movie gives the most accurate portrayal of Marines I've seen in cinema.  It isn't perfect, but the Marines in this movie resemble the Marines I spent three years in Iraq with far more than usual.  It shows how we move, think, talk and gives a sense of why Marines are so phenomenally effective in combat.

In order to concentrate on the Marines, the movie pits them against non-human adversaries and then minimizes the science fiction aspect of the story.  This would seem to be a rather obvious plot device, so I'm at a loss to explain how Mr. Ebert missed it, since he is, by his own implication, a super genius and the better of us all.

I can't really blame men like Mr. Ebert - who spend their whole life getting fat watching make-pretend stories - for not understanding warriors like the US Marines.  But they could at least recognize that some of us in the non-sissified professions aren't simpletons.  I, for example, have a master's degree in physics and a 174 IQ (according to MENSA) and believe I could hold my own against Roger's vastly superior intellect.

The only quibble I had with the movie is the implausibility of aliens who are smart enough for space travel, but dumb enough to invade a country loaded with Marines.  Other than that, I loved it.",1299974400,21,2214,4.694300518134715
4469078,5,B004ULEEY8,"Alot of people didn't like it from some of the cliche' characters and very little story line to the movie but lets be honest, its an alien invasion...how much story  do you really want from it? its fun its intense and its action packed! the special effects are fantastic and aaron eckhart does a great job acting. its not a movie the entire world will love its got its flaws but if you just want to watch a fun movie i recommend it",1299974400,4,431,4.192771084337349
4469079,2,B004ULEEY8,After seeing a few of the trailers for this movie I really was hoping that it was better than it turned out being.  We both found this movie boring and predictable.  I persoanlly thought this was Michelle Rodriguez's worst role that I can remember seeing her in.  I will go on to say that we appeared to be in the minority as quite a few people were clapping at the end of it.,1299888000,5,376,4.123287671232877
4469080,4,B004ULEEY8,"Mouth-watering previews aside, Battle Los Angeles does not fully deliver upon expectations.  And it's mostly because of shaky cam.  If you don't like that, or hated Cloverfield exclusively because of the filming, you will not appreciate this movie.

If you can ignore that jumpy filming, imagine if the aliens from Independence Day had made an atrocious military decision to invade Earth with the lowliest ground troops accompanied by very minimal air or artillery support.  On top of that, the military intelligence brought along for the interstellar colonization is comically inept to the point that basic defensive principles are eschewed for no discernable reason.  Keep in mind this is an alien race that sent an entire mobilized force, disguised as asteroids, across galaxies to destroy the human race and deplete the planet of certain resources.  The positive, however, is in ground-to-ground urban combat.  A grain of salt is necessary for any alien invasion film, but if a fairly realistic portrayal of at least the potential infantry battles between humans and aliens were possible, then this gets closer than any other.

Regardless of the plot, the redeeming quality of this movie is primarily in the casting.  Aaron Eckhart exudes senior military qualities.  Cleft chin, rugged features, a delivery both stoic and gruff.  He's completely believable as a Marine, and his heroic yet decisive actions could fill a Medal of Honor citation.  His inexperienced group of jarheads works well together balance out the cast.  Along the way the script writers decided a strong female lead was necessary, one who could talk the talk and fire a machine gun; it therefore became contractually obligatory for the casting director to contact Michelle Rodriguez.  She performs admirably, just as expected.  Rounding out the cast are Bridget Moynahan and Michael Pena as civilians caught in chaos.

As already mentioned, the huge negative to this movie is the overuse of the dreaded shaky cam.  The filming in far too many instances was completely unwatchable.  This is supposed to convey a feeling of being inside the action, but it distracts just as much as it aids the anxiety or realism.  It is simply too overwrought to work completely.  Most action scenes take place among the ruins and highway structure of LA, so the bleak grays of stone and overpasses blend well with fractured windows and rampant explosions and fires.  The pace is frenetic and exciting.  Danger is palpable.  The tense action truly is the highlight; it's just too bad the cameraman from Cloverfield was working the scene.

Alien invasion films have been done better and worse, and this film breaks little new ground.  In the end this falls somewhere below the greats in this genre, and typical, brainless popcorn flicks like Bayformers.

It gave me a head ache, the zooming and unzooming for no reason the panning of the camera so fast the picture is to blurie to see. Lets not forget the shacking of the camera. I understand the director wanted use to fell close to the action but GD way to much and why did he zoom in on everyones faces. The actions was really good in some parts. But I wish they would of went it to more depth on the aliens and I thought Aaron Eckhart did a good job, he was believable as the battle tough Marine.",1299888000,,564,4.0

8441777,5,B004ULEEY8,"This movie suffered from poor marketing. It was billed as a sci-fi alien invasion movie, for which it was kind of mediocre (because it's not). It's more accurately described as a gritty military movie featuring a war against an invading superior (alien) force.

I love it for what it is, and wish it could get a sequel.",1524182400,,319,4.5964912280701755
