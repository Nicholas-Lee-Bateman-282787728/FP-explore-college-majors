8619179,5,B00FXCGKC2,My son is training to be a strongman and was interested in this movie.  My husband and I weren't sure about it and the accuracy of the story.  This is a GREAT movie and a real motivator for my son.  We seriously underestimated this movie.  I would happily watch it again!,1520208000,,271,4.254901960784314

8619183,5,B00FXCGKC2,I've read about Louis Cyr and since he's a distant relative heard great stories about him. Like carrying a pony on his back and climbing a telephone like pole. Or lifting a table with people all piled up on it above his head. Not sure if true but great stories all the same. It's great to see this movie and the recognition he's getting. Great movie!! Bad review from me.. Aaron Cyr,1436313600,,382,4.319444444444445

8619185,5,B00FXCGKC2,"I've been a Cyr buff for about forty years, since I was about 22. So my interest in Cyr is long-standing not ephemeral. I liked this movie a lot, obviously, but there are things I would have done differently. I would have included Cyr's two years as a cop in Montreal and the exploits he engaged in, his showdown with Cyclops and the False Sandow as well as Beaupre the Giant. I would also have included scenes of the tavern that Cyr and his wife owned and Cyr's amazing little stunt of lifting his wife over the tavern counter with just one hand and very little effort.

All of that said, the movie is well-acted and Antoine Bertrand is extremely convincing as Louis Cyr. He is a similar physical type and looks much as Cyr did. It would have been tragic if instead of Antoine Bertrand the producers had hired some enormous modern day weightlifter to play Cyr. Cyr was not one-dimensional and that's all one would get from a non-actor weightlifter. The movie draws one into the past with a very judicious use of special effects and one comes to care deeply about Louis and his wife Melina. The drama between Louis and his only child, a daughter, is sad of course but seems to have been worked out before Cr died in 1912 at the young age of 49. There are several brief flashes of Cyr's temper but it isn't dwelt upon. The delightful forwardness of Melina toward Louis is quite touching and makes Melina into a very special woman indeed.

There are things to quibble about but that's all it is. Quibbling. If you can rent the movie, rent it. If you're a Cyr buff like me then go ahead and add it to your Cyr collection. You will watch this movie at least several times BUT you have to make sure you get a copy with English subtitles. Otherwise much of the movie will be lost on you, unless you speak French.",1406160000,3,1806,4.372023809523809

Louis Cyr was an accurate depiction of the Franco-American,Irish culture in Textile dominated Lowell Massachusetts in the late 1800's and was well acted. My father, a distant relative of Louis told me of many instances of Louis' weight lifting prowess that my Grandfather actually witnessed as a young loom-fixer in Lowell's Suffolk Textile Mill.  The film is well acted and sets out the life of this amazing strongman.",1399075200,3,472,5.116883116883117
