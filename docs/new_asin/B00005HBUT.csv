8276591,5,B00005HBUT,"There are no English subtitles on the VHS, judging by the legit cover, and that I own the VHS. Other than that, it's a great film, although not my favorite Pokmon movie. This is a must by for Pokmon fans because this, along with the Laserdisc, is one of the only format to have the original theatrical version available. In there, it has hand drawn storm clouds and cel painted castle doors. The Kanzenban feature Origin of Mewtwo, and CGI. That version is used for later releases like DVD and HD. The Kanzenban is like the Star Wars Special Edition, and like that, the Kanzenban is less to be desired. So if you want to see or own the unaltered version as part of Pokmon history, this is for you. Don't buy the the later versions.",1449360000,,731,4.382352941176471
8276592,4,B00005HBUT,"and by that, I mean it is NOT English subtitled...at all. Only the title on the front of the case can be considered the ""English Subtitled."" But it's still a wonderful movie and the hand animation where CGI took the place of in the American version is really beautiful. It's still a great buy, just don't expect to be able to understand anything if you don't happen to speak Japanese.",1389052800,,384,4.5
