7806244,5,6300217523,"I'm old enough to remember when Spike Jones had a summer show on CBS. It was funny then, and in light of what passes for ""comedy"" these days, it's even funnier & wackier today! Born Lindley Jones--& if YOU had a moniker like that, wouldn't YOU have altered it ASAP?!?--Spike provided much musical comedy (OK, 15% musical, 85% comedy) as he got older; I don't think he actually grew up! Anyone who needs a few laughs these days--and who doesn't?!?--should order anything by Mr. Jones.",1301702400,,483,4.694117647058824

7806246,5,6300217523,"This is the best of the Spike Jones tapes, and one of the funniest videos ever compiled, with choice excerpts from Spike Jones's 1950s TV appearances. Jones fans will enjoy the television adaptations of his record  hits: you can now see the woebegone horse Beetlebaum, and a new arrangement  of ""You Always Hurt the One You Love"" offers a biting satire of  the Ink Spots vocal group. Billy Barty does a show-stopping Liberace  routine. There's even a demonstration of drummer Jones's serious  musicianship as he and trumpeter George Rock duet on ""Minka.""  It's hard to pick the best sketch because all of them are winners. Picture  and sound are excellent.",944438400,25,656,4.909090909090909
