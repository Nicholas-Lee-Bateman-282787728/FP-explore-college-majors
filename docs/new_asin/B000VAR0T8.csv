2934808,5,B000VAR0T8,"I've heard about this series in the past but never thought about reading/watching it until I rented it randomly from Netflix.  After watching the series, I was blown away by how good the series was.  I bought the DVDs shortly after finishing the rented versions.  The US production company did an excellent job with the English dubbing of this series (and I greatly thank them for keeping the same English cast for season 2).  I can't think of any negative points about the series itself.

The one problem I did run into with this item was the sub-par construction of DVD case.  The first one I received from Amazon had 1 DVD cracked in half.  After ordering a replacement, the DVDs were all in good condition but some plastic pieces that are supposed to hold the DVDs in place were broken off.  I ended up removing all the DVDs from the case and storing them in my own DVD cases.",1218153600,2,880,4.45625
2934809,5,B000VAR0T8,"Back in the nineties, all fans of the Ah! My Goddess manga had was a short, very condensed five-episode OVA series. It was lovely, of course, and we would watch and love every second of it. And yet, there was a thirst that the short OVA couldn't quench (and neither could the excellent 2000 Ah! My Goddess film, even if it is still the single best piece of Ah! My Goddess media ever released): we knew this series deserved to be made into a TV series. Back then, the odds of this happening seemed slim. Thankfully, we were wrong.

The TV series is everything we'd hoped for and more. This wasn't a rushed 13-episode project that'd only develop things slightly more than the previous OVA. This was (and is) a major, high-quality project. The series neither follows the manga completely faithfully nor veers off in some unknown direction: it takes the basic flow and material provided by the manga and fashions itself as its own creature.

As far as the series goes:

Visual: A fairly high-quality level of animation is maintained. The visual aspects of the film are maintained, so this and the film don't look that terribly different.

Audio: Thankfully, unlike the OVA with its dinky BG music and simplistic J-POP, we get quite a few good tunes with this series. The first season opening is an excellent, Celtic-ish piece of soft rock. The ending is a cute, and, dare I say, slightly country-ish tune. The background music is not spectacular, but it accomplishes its job and, again, it is a far sight better than what was provided in the OVA.

Extras: Sparse extras. Very little. Extras-fanatics will be disappointed; for people like me who merely want the show, though, this won't be a problem.

All in All, a great show at a very affordable price. Highly recommended!

If you've never seen any Ah! My Goddess, though, try to get your hands on the OVA first. If you like the OVA, you'll love the series.

ONE POINT OF CAUTION

The five stars above are for the show itself. I advise against keeping your DVDs in the case. The way it is designed makes it very tough to get the DVDs out. I've never had troubles with any of my other DVDs, but I actually snapped one of the discs in this collection trying to get it out, and had to order a new individual copy of that disc! Get the set for the price, and then find some jewel cases or case-books to keep the discs in.",1212019200,21,2364,4.5046728971962615
2934810,4,B000VAR0T8,"I was a fan of ""Oh My Goddess!"" manga when it was under Dark Horse, I read it for year and years and years, I loved it!

When I saw that they where releasing an anime, ooh I was excited!  But, a little worried, as I wasn't a huge fan of the ""Oh My Goddess"" movie.

When I netflixed this, wow!  I loved it!  Oooh it was great!  It had all the little story bits they left out in the American manga that where in the Japanese manga, PLUS lots of new stuff!  the voice acting is great, just what I would expect the characters to sound like!  Even the english dub is good, and honestly I hate watching anime when its not in its original language, so that coming from me says alot.

I had to buy it right away!  Now I'm eagerly awaiting season 2 to come out, come on whats taking them so long!  haha.

Its fun, light, great fun for all ages.  Well, maybe not really young kids, but teens and up hehe ~.^ due to suggestive content, nothing graphic or anything though!

This show is great and I love it, very true to the original manga, I'm very pleased with this.  Any OMG fan will love it!  And if you like light, funny, story with morals, full of lovable characters, and beautiful animation, give it a shot!  I bet you'll love it too!

Oh and there are no boys getting nose bleeds and falling down or angry women punching them through windows into the next county.  hehe.  ^^ come on, all you anime fans, you know what I'm talking about hehe.  ^^",1201737600,17,1441,4.129963898916968

When I got it the forth disk of the six disk set was split in two. I contacted the seller through Amazon and it was promptly replaced.
The original packaging was a padded envelope that was bubble wrapped and inside another envelope. The problem lies with the manufacturer. Stacking disks on top of one another is always a bad idea. Unfortunately it's also cheaper.

2934820,3,B000VAR0T8,"This is a series that I really thought I'd like.  The first few episodes were pretty strong, especially when centered on the main characters of Keiichi and the goddess Beldandy.  Keiichi's sister Megumi pops into the series, and one can easily start thinking of plot complications that arise.  But the whole series goes over the top when Beldandy's goddess sisters Urd and Skuld show up, as well as the demon Mara.

  Some of the other (earthly) characters would be a bit more fun to watch if they weren't so two-dimensional.  These include Keiichi's friends from the Auto Club as well as the hottest girl and coolest guy in college.  Every time they show up onscreen, you know what they're up to (with the possible exception of the Auto Club guys dressed as cheerleaders).

  Most of the `action' is ho-hum, and most of the jokes and sight gags are pretty lame (though there were two or three that were hilarious).  The middle episodes just kind of plod along.  But as the series begins to wind down, it actually gets better, even though the details are confusing, and there's never a doubt about the how it will all turn out.  I thought episode 24 provided a satisfactory ending, so I never watched the last 2 episodes.

  All in all, I can't say that I recommend this series very highly.  I'm giving it a three star rating based on a strong beginning and ending, and a few worthwhile jokes in between.",1363564800,,1404,4.592741935483871

2934825,5,B000VAR0T8,"This is a very sweet love story. Keiichi the college student is blessed. A goddess named Belldandy has come to Earth to grant his wish. His wish is that she stay by his side forever. This anime follows them though their day to day lives and all the craziness that implies. Belldandy has 2 sisters that are way out there. Her older sister is bent on fast tracking Belldandy's relationship with Keiichi and her little sister wants to break them up. There are also demons and classmates that have it in for them.

This anime is adapted from an older sort OVA. It is more detailed and takes the story further. The animation is great, the soundtrack is fitting, and the story is very good. It's a very good anime that can be lighthearted and emotional at the same time. It's brought me lots of entertainment over the years and I hope you like it too.",1350432000,,845,4.416666666666667
2934826,3,B000VAR0T8,"This one is meant for kids. It's cute at first, but a little too much for someone over the age of 15 I would think. This isn't an artistic Ghibli film, that's for sure. The anime is a little flat, which doesn't stand out, but the storylines are so typical, though a little funny at times. This one, for some reason, was an early anime series I saw, that I wouldn't want to see again. It's ok, but way over the top. Though very successful with many spinoffs that followed the original. There are some types of anime or any storytelling form, that is a question of taste. Either you like it or you do not. This, IMO, is too juvenile for adults. It's not my type, I'll just leave it at that.",1343692800,,688,4.180451127819549
2934827,4,B000VAR0T8,"Overall this is a fun anime, but suffers some problems...

1. There is almost no character development.  At the end of the series Keiichi remains shy and lacks confidence, and Belldandy still does not know how the world works.  Urd and Skuld (especially the latter) get kinda boring and annoying.

2. The plot lacks twist.  There is no meaningful obstacle between Keiichi and Belldandy.",1329696000,,386,4.96875

2934829,5,B000VAR0T8,(Forgive any bad speling) This is by far the best anime I have watched to date and I have see a lot of them.  The female lead Belldandy is sweet funny and kind and the male lead reminds meof my self witch really drew me in and got me to like the searies.  The comedy is well writen in the story and does not over power it.  you can't help but enjoy this searies once you watch it.,1321401600,,380,3.8461538461538463
2934830,5,B000VAR0T8,"Ah! My Goddess is one of those animes you will either love, or completely hate. I own the entire collection, both season 1 and 2. If you can't stand lovey dovey animes, or animes where its just about a developing relationship between the 2 main characters, then I would advise you to stay away. I am a hopeless romantic, so I pretty much fell in love with this series right away. The first season is better than the second for multiple reasons:
First, the first season we are learning all about the characters. The plot is interesting because there isn't a repeative plot like the second season, where it is all about Keiichi telling Belldandy he loves her, which he does in the first season multiple times, but I guess when it gets to the second season, he forgets or something.
Second, the animation is again, done very well. The colors are pretty and there isn't an episode I noticed where the charaters looked kinda rough.
This complete collection include all of the First season, which is episodes 1-26, just in case anyone was wondering.
The voice acting was done well, not the best. Some of the characters I couldn't stand to listen too, but I like Keiichi and Belldandy's voice actors.
I would still advise you to watch the season on Youtube or Hulu before purchasing this product, just because it is such a repeative series, it may bother you and I don't want you to waste any money.
So all in all, this anime receives 5 stars from me because I finally found a romantic anime that I enjoy. Also, the animation is done very well, and most of the voice acting is spot on. I would still advise you to watch it before you buy it, just to make sure it deserves a spot in your anime collection. Just as I said before, the second season is very repeative, so I would recommend season 1 over season 2, but if you like having the entire anime collection, then go for it!",1316995200,16,1870,4.438953488372093
2934831,5,B000VAR0T8,"Here I am a grown up man and this crazy little TV show can reduce me to a blubbering mess. Weird, huh? Well, not really, when it comes to sentiment and tugging at the heart-strings, the Japanese don't hold back!

This show was created at a time when the economy was going bad in Japan and the divorce rate was starting to clime. Relationships between men and women were breaking down. I suppose that either consciously or subconsciously, the makers of this Anim created in Belldandy a symbol of love, hope, honour and faithfulness. She's a goddess, of course!

Okay, at the start we meet Keiichi, a university student for whom just about nothing goes right. The seniors give him a hard time, he's a little on the short side and he is spectacularly unsuccessful with girls. In short, he's a bit of a nerd - but an endearing nerd, nonetheless. Then one night, when it is all getting on top of him, he dials for some take-away food, only to mistakenly rings the ""Goddess Line"", who deliver Belldandy to his room. Belldandy explains to Keiichi that Heaven has seen that the balance in his line has been a little out of kilter and he could do with a wish being granted - only one wish, Belldandy stresses. Keiichi dithers, he suspects the whole thing is a set-up by the seniors to humiliate him, but finally he decides - ""I'd like a girl like you to be by my side forever.""
Wish granted! And Belldandy herself steps in to fulfil his wish.

Of course, the seniors quickly find out that Keiichi has a woman in the dormitory - a men's only dormitory - and Belldandy and Keiichi are kicked out. Then the fun begins.

The story has many amusing moments, particularly when Belldandy's sisters, Urd and Skuld come down to earth to complicate Keiichi's life further. The story also shows the slowly, but surely, developing love between Belldandy and Keiichi, a love that is so touching because it is born out of the utter devotion of Belldandy, in time, Keiichi.

For me the most memorable and moving moment is when Belldandy tells Keiichi that even though she is free to return to heaven, she will stay anyway ""because I love you"".

Romance, endearing and well drawn characters, good heart, kindness, humanity, grace and some good laughs too - that's ""Ah! My Goddess"". Along with Azumanga Daioh, this is my favourite Anim series.",1309392000,7,2317,4.611650485436893

2934835,5,B000VAR0T8,"What can I say about Ah! My Goddess that hasn't already been said? I will say this. It's nice to see a story that has real heart and warmth. It's something that I think is missing from a lot of our own shows. People have criticized Keiichi and Belldandy as being a wimp and a doormat, but I just don't see it that way. Belldandy's status as a First Class Goddess is something that you should keep in mind as you watch this. That's Goddess First Class, Unlimited License. That means she's the example to which all other Goddesses aspire. I don't think that taking care of someone and finding the joy in the simple things of life makes you a doormat. I don't think that looking for the best in people even when they disappoint you makes you weak --I think that kind of character is something that could only exist in a Goddess First Class, Unlimited License.

As for Keiichi, he's more than special too. He's that lovable underdog in all of us. This is a truly good young man in the way that he keeps his positive outlook in spite of all the hardships. He's not good with women --that's something that all of us have struggled with at some point. I think the reason I like his character is that I can identify with his problem. Sometimes all you need in order to make the most out of life is to have that important someone to stand by you and believe in you. You can see it as the series progresses, just what an affect having that kind of someone in your life can make. But even with that, it isn't automatic. You don't just get it once and then everything falls into place. His wish wasn't a selfish wish, it was a genuinely honest one. I think that's what she sees in him from the very beginning. Rather than wishing for wealth, or fame or anything materialistic, he wished for someone to stick by him that would believe in him. Who wouldn't fall in love with someone like that?

The major problems with their relationship comes from the outside. I think that's the funniest thing about the show. The two come to love unexpectedly, but they are going at their own pace --even though it may seem slow to some; for the two of them it's absolutely right. Urd and Skuld are family, and like family they meddle even if it's with the best of intentions. It's zany and it's non violent for the most part and it's romantic. I really could spend two hours watching these with my daughter and not feel like its a chore. Sometimes I even sneak and preview an episode or two ahead after she's gone to sleep.

The sexual tension is real, without going too overboard like a lot of other Anime. It's not too much and I don't think it tries to bash you over the head with it. The violence is minimal, and pertinent to the storyline. Bottom line is that I have no reservations about recommending this kind of Anime to my friends who want something different. I do a lot of watching of shows like this for my daughter because I'm tired of her watching the drivel that counts for shows for girls these days. This one has real heart.",1270425600,,3014,4.330973451327433
2934836,5,B000VAR0T8,"I really enjoy this series! I passed on it at first, as it looked like it was related to ""Ah, My Buddha"", a series my friend owns and which I find completely uninteresting.

2934840,4,B000VAR0T8,"A friend of mine introduced me to anime, and knowing that I hated ultra-violent series that are so popular amongst anime fans, recommended Ah! My Goddess instead. The series starts off incredibly slowly - the very first episode is entirely Keichii-centric. The pace picks up a little when Belldandy shows up. But the series really begins to take off when Belldandy's sisters - Urd and Skuld show up. It's about then that the series settles into a familiar formula - Urd tries to persuade Keichii to put the moves on Belldandy, Skuld tries to stop them, hilarity (and numerous explosions) ensues. It's a simplistic formula, but the characters have so much charm to them that it actually works very well.

I have some minor caveats, which I think are particularly relevant to new viewers. Firstly, the series does take awhile to get up to speed and establish the characters, so be patient because the multi-episode wait is worth it. Secondly, for those used to female protaganists like Buffy Sommers, Belldandy is a major throwback to the 1950's. The character of Belldandy is most successful when she is interacting with other characters - particularly Urd and Skuld. When the focus was on Belldandy herself, the pace slowed down for me somewhat.

Apart from that, this is a reasonably good series.",1220486400,3,1297,4.917808219178082
2934841,4,B000VAR0T8,"This will be a short review since it's 5:30 AM and my memories of the first season aren't very fresh due to me having completed it a few weeks back. I suddenly felt like expressing my opinion about the series before my memories become too fuzzy, so...

The story is simple: A guy (Keiichi) with bad luck has bad things happen to him constantly, a Goddess (Belldandy) takes pity on him, allowing him to have 1 wish and the guy rather bizarrely requests that the Goddess stays with him forever. From that point onwards the other main characters are slowly introduced, including characters such as Skuld; a young Goddess who wants all Belldandy's attention, and lots of comedy follows.

Ah! My Goddess (AMG) is what I've come to call a 'circular series', and by that I mean it's the type that goes around in a seemingly endless circle of comedy episodes that advance the plot very slowly if at all. But, thankfully, that isn't a bad thing in the case of this series - The main characters are all likeable, the relationship between a wimp (Keiichi) and doormatt (Belldandy) is as entertaining as it is cute and the series clearly had a fairly high budget. You'll end up glad that Ah! My Goddess is the type of series that will continue until the money stops coming.

AMG is a show that just about anyone from either gender should enjoy. It isn't a series for the sort of people who can't enjoy anything without blood and guts but I find it hard to imagine anyone else disliking it. If you want an easy to watch or a 'girlfriend friendly series' that's almost guaranteed to make time pass in an enjoyable manner then this most certainly is it.

I've moved onto the 2nd season (although I've put it on hold for the moment) and I still enjoy watching it just as much as I did when I started. I highly recommend continuing the series with that once you get through the first season - It's a direct continuation of what you'll by then know is a high quality series.",1219363200,3,1956,4.470588235294118
