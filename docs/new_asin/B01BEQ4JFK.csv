8749996,3,B01BEQ4JFK,"Iceman Reborn is the story of Gary Staab's commission to create a synthetic duplicate of the Iceman, or Otzi, so that it could be more accessible to more than the tiny number of researchers who have access to this prehistoric man's remains.

That's what this DVD is about. Gary Staab has reproduced many now-extinct animals for museums and other exhibitions. Beginning with a 3-D printed plastic copy of the Iceman's basic form, it's up to Gary to reproduce the colors and textures of Otzi's body for display.

There's really it. There's no information about the man, despite a short segment on his DNA which we wasn't new. I was expecting more. If the artist's craft is what you're wanting to see, this is the DVD for you. I, frankly, was expecting more about Otzi and I can't give this video more than three stars.",1479945600,5,816,4.659722222222222

8749999,5,B01BEQ4JFK,"Otzi was 110lbs, brown eyes and 5'7"". His last meal included wheat and animal flesh. No one will ever see Otzi except his doctors who keep him in a 19 degree germ free freezer away from all, for his protection. Otzi's body is smashed due to the weight of the lake's frozen water on top of him when he was laying down on his face after being murdered by an arrow in his chest. Otzi had 61 tattoos all over his body and he was from the Italy's Sardinia's region. What scientists can find about humans after some five centuries is amazing but this documentary is not only about Otzi. Half of the documentary is about the renowned artist and paleo-sculptor Gary Staa who gets to make a plastic mold of the Otzi for museum reproduction. How he gets to mold and reproduce Otzi from 3D printing, resin, clay and paint is out of this world. One very interesting and well informed documentary. Bravo.",1456012800,9,891,4.439024390243903
