6389082,5,B00JQHOIII,Great movie and very funny,1489449600,,26,4.4
6389083,5,B00JQHOIII,"I have known about this movie for years and now finally have it on DVD.  This low budget movie does more with limited special effects than almost any of the modern multi-million productions.  Unlike much of the mean-spirited comedy of most current-day movie and television productions, this movie takes aim at the truly funny aspects of our lives - our cultural differences, our animals and our machines.  I have and will watch this movie repeatedly.",1488672000,,450,4.973333333333334

6389092,1,B00JQHOIII,The movie is incomplete. There are several parts missing. The scenes where the badger is buried in the ground and when the native burns a circle to prevent getting burned are missing and may be others but I don't remember because I saw the movie more than 5 years ago. I even thought about returning it.,1466640000,,303,4.428571428571429
6389093,4,B00JQHOIII,"I have never found this ""sequel"" as good as the original but it has its merits and a few laugh-out-loud moments, just not as many as the first GMBC.  We do get to learn more about how people survive in that harsh country, in entertaining ways.  I'm happy to own both now, as they're fun to watch over and over, and to share with guests and grandchildren.",1462924800,2,354,4.268656716417911
