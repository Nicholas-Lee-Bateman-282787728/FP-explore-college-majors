1893886,5,B00009WHRN,"My father and I have watched claymation christmas every christmas morning ever since it first came out in '87.  Having to watch it on an old vhs that was all fuzzy, now to find out it's on a dvd I've found the perfect gift to give to my dad this holiday season.  I highly recommend this to everyone of all ages.  I'm 21 myself, and my father in his 50's, we both love this show!  And now I get to see 2 others I've never seen before.",1066348800,59,433,3.942528735632184
1893887,5,B00009WHRN,"Claymation Christmas is worthy to join the pantheon of holiday entertainment classics! From a creative standpoint, it is nearly peerless in its ability to generate WOW! moments, such is the level of creative brilliance behind the presentation of Claymation Christmas' various vignettes. And, if one has an appreciation for the dedication and demands in producing stop action animation, then certainly CC can be appreciated on that level, as well. Will Vinton & Co., the creative masterminds behind Claymation Christmas, have indeed produced and bequeathed to us a Treasure!
Not to be missed, Oh fans of Holiday fare. Now get thee a copy and marvel at the mastery that is Claymation Christmas!",1060300800,16,692,5.243243243243243
1893888,5,B00009WHRN,"Ever since I've been collecting DVD's, I've been doing my best to find old holiday classics that take me back to when I was a kid and waiting all year for them to come on the air.  This is one of them, and I have been looking forward to this for ages.  From the Carol of the Bells to the California Raisins doing Rudolph, it is a very creative look at various christmas songs all done in claymation!  As I don't know what is on the DVD yet, I can't rate it for that, but I will be picknig this up no matter what!",1056844800,36,512,3.9038461538461537

1893894,5,B00009WHRN,"We remembered this video this year for Christmas and how the kids liked it when they were young.  We enjoyed it also to the point where we searched for it and ordered this DVD.  It is uniquely entertaining and is considered classic entertainment for us.  The Claymation process is well done but it is the humor induced into classic Christmas songs that I find hilarious.  Quasimodo and the bell, that's funny stuff.",1516838400,,415,4.722222222222222

1893899,4,B00009WHRN,This is an often overlooked classic it because it was produced for television the picture quality is deeply lacking this is why the four stars in only because of the quality the transfers okay it's just that it never was very good this movie is inventive and takes you on quite a nice little ride each of the segments are funny artistic and really quite beautiful it's worth the money the music is wonderful and it's a good holiday classic unfortunately most people don't know about it spread the word it's worth watching the price was a little high I think only because it's a little on the rear side that's the only reason I bought it is that I don't see it very often in my opinion though it was a little too expensive Amazon got it here pretty close to on time and it was undamaged if you can afford it by it your kids will love it and so far as I'm concerned none of us should ever grow up so much that we can appreciate things like this claymation is a very serious art form it takes a lot of time to produce it and a lot of thought and they definitely hit the march with this it is the epitome of this art I hope you enjoy it and I hope my review was helpful thank you,1515110400,,1175,4.068965517241379

Through the course of things we lost the tape, so this year I am so glad to find it on DVD to give out as gifts!

Fun for all ages, the characters and ""story line"" of the Claymation Christmas which debuted in 1987, will keep you laughing at their antics while the music just might make you want to sing along.  There is also a ""special appearance"" by the California Raisins. If you're too young to remember them...Google them!

1893966,5,B00009WHRN,"Will Vinton's Claymation Christmas is a huge favorite of my family and has been since I was a little kid. We originally taped the special from the tv along with all the late 1980s commercials (classic). Our tradition was to always watch it on Christmas day, rather than watch something everyone else watched like The Grinch Stole Christmas or Its a Wonderful Life. My family is weird and we like our holidays weird too.

Our overall favorite is The Carol of the Bells with Quasimodo. The look on his face when he grunts in disgust at that one bell forces belly laughs out of all of us.

Another personal favorite of mine is the animators (claymators?) take on Joy to the World. Its so beautiful and culturally different that it makes me tear up every time as a powerful piece of music will, but this rendition is particularly beautiful and really makes you feel that the song is about real joy.

I did watch the Halloween and Easter specials and honestly, they really fall short of the Christmas special. Theyre not even close to being as good. I had never even heard of the Halloween or Easter specials until I bought the dvd. I really only bought it for the Christmas special and thats what I always watch. If I could separate the stars for this review, I'd give Christmas a 5 and the other two each a two or three. But really though, the Christmas special alone makes the dvd worth it.

Im personally a big fan of claymation and would put the Claymation Christmas special among my top three claymation films easily. If all of this cant convince you to give it a try, the California Raisins also make a cameo and they killed it with Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.",1468886400,5,1666,4.506622516556291

1893990,3,B00009WHRN,"This is a well-remembered, well-loved production that didn't have the longevity of the special that it was paired with originally, ""A Garfield Christmas."" And to be honest, I kind of can see why--somehow it actually looks and feels more dated than the ""Garfield"" special does, more even than all of those animated Christmas specials from the '60s that still thrive today. For all of its uniqueness, it's not as entertaining as I recall from my youth. And rather famously, a chunk of it is no more than extended commercial for the California Raisins craze that for some stupid reason had gripped the United States in the late '80s.

It certainly will be fun viewing every few years, but it isn't something that is critical viewing each season.",1450483200,,742,4.84251968503937

I tried for years to remember what it was called, and find it on tape, but never could.  As an adult, no one had ever heard of it, and I thought it was gone forever.  Once I figured out the name, I was able to get a little further.  I couldn't believe Amazon had this!  All those warm nostalgia Christmas feelings rushed over me when I watched those claymation dinosaurs hosting this special.  My kid loves Claymation Christmas and it's so awesome being able to share it with my family.  I only bought this for the Christmas special, but the other ones are alright too.

1894038,5,B00009WHRN,"I loved the Christmas special as a kid, and wasn't aware that there were any other specials.  I primarily purchased the set for the Christmas special as I have fond memories of watching it on TV with my Mom every year.  I had forgotten about it for several years, then all of a sudden I remembered and was lucky enough to find it here.  Will Vinton studios produced entertaining shows for both kids and adults that had strong moral themes, but not necessarily religious in any way.  They definitely had a visual style which is relevant throughout their specials, and other full length films such as the Adventures of Mark Twain.  The Christmas special is appropriate for any audience and focuses on Christmas carols, not any other meaning of Christmas, so it ends up being educational as well as fun.",1424217600,,800,4.685714285714286

It is without a doubt the highlight of the DVD, especially the Carol of The Bells segment. A lot of people don't like the Halloween special, but I didn't think it was so bad. I thought the ""treasure hunt in a haunted house"" plot  was pretty enticing. The Easter special was definitely the low point of the series. Wilshire Pig is just not a good fit for a program about a joyful holiday. A scary holiday, yes. But this one, no. If the Easter one would've been structured like Claymation Christmas (with fun skits and no villains), it would've been much much better.",1420070400,,665,4.4958677685950414

The Claymation Christmas was one of my favorites and I'm so glad to have it for my family to enjoy.  It features the classic Christmas carols, each with their own treatment. It's a Christmas ""special"" hosted by a TRex and a Tricerotops as they debate the correct form of a particular carol. ""It's Wasselling (sp?)! I tell you, it's Wasselling!""  I just love it.

1894144,3,B00009WHRN,"This DVD consists of three short films starring the Claymation characters made famous some years back by the Raisin Dancers.  Each segment is rather short  no more than twenty minutes apiece  so some people would have concerns about value for the money, and, obviously, the short pieces highlight Christmas, Halloween, and Easter. These are cute short takes similar to the cartoons shown before the main feature in theaters, and I give credit there because sometimes people want something shorter. The animation is rather good, and the storylines are amusing.

However, the biggest problem I have with this DVD  and it seems to be a very common one with DVDs  is nonexistent captions or trouble making the captions work!  This is my reason for a three-star rating.  I wouldve enjoyed these cartoons a lot more with captions.",1388016000,2,824,5.007352941176471

The old VHS tape was rather worn and finding the DVD version in the store wasent happening.  Found it on Amazon perfectly fine,like most hard to get items.  The quality is about what to be expected for a non-mainstream (anymore) older movie, but better than VHS version by far.  Brings back memories and allows us to share them with our kids now each year.",1386374400,,480,4.471264367816092
1894150,5,B00009WHRN,"$20 is worth it for the Christmas program, as it's a must-watch for me and my family every year. The DVD certainly beats our old VHS copy from 1980-something that was recorded from network TV and had deteriorated to the point of almost being unwatchable.

Speaking of unwatchable, there are two other ""specials"" on this DVD for Easter and Halloween that are frighteningly bad. They are probably the worst pieces of garbage I've ever seen, and it's not even worth watching them to see how bad they are. That being said, the overall package is worth it just for the Christmas program.",1386288000,,582,4.705882352941177

Costs a little much, but I consider it a classic since I saw it when I was young and still enjoy it.

1894158,5,B00009WHRN,Arrived as expected. I personally cannot stand Claymation Christmas. My wife on the other hand has great childhood memories of this crappy show. The VHS tape she had finally gave out and I threw away the VCR. I ordered this DVD for her as a surprise Christmas present and she loves it.

1894161,4,B00009WHRN,"My girlfriend grew up a fan of the Halloween special on this disc, and in fact she watches it every year on Halloween, thanks to an old VHS copy she has. Her birthday is shortly before Halloween, so when I saw that this disc existed, I decided to get it for her. We truly enjoyed watching the Halloween special a few days ago, and look forward to doing the same with the included Christmas and Easter specials when those holidays approach. (I'd suspect these aren't the best specials for the religiously minded... but heck, we're a secular couple, so it's all good for us.)

Video quality isn't the greatest, and while one of the specials has commentary there isn't exactly an overload of features... but if you have any nostalgic attachments to any or all of the specials on this disc, then it is well worth the purchase. My girlfriend is glad that she no longer has to worry about her VHS tape getting worn out or eaten by a hungry VCR.",1383436800,,938,4.453488372093023

The only issue is that this style of clay-mation was part of who we were back then, but now it seems some sort of voodoo magic.

1894256,5,B00009WHRN,"I watched this with my family when it originally came out in 1987, and for several years after that we watched it on VHS tape (fast-forwarding the commercials, of course) until the tape gave up the ghost.  I didn't hold out much hope of seeing it after that, since it never seemed to air again.  As happy as I was to find poor-quality short clips on YouTube a couple of years ago, I couldn't have been happier to have found this on DVD.  It's funny, cute, innocent, and well-animated.  I really enjoy their versions of the carols, and really there's nothing not to like.  My kids giggle hysterically at the camels, raisins, and walruses.

If you're a fan of clay animation or Christmas, this is a great DVD.  If you're a stick-in-the-mud with no holiday spirit, you might not like it.",1323129600,,784,4.5177304964539005

I was seeing prices everywhere for it for over $35 and didn't want to pay that much. This was a great price for a brand new sealed item. It plays perfectly (of course) and brings back great memories from childhood!,1322697600,,334,4.403225806451613
1894258,5,B00009WHRN,This was one of my favorite memories as a child watching Claymation Christmas on TV. They only aired it a few times so I was excited to find it on DVD. I got it in a timely manner and the DVD was in great shape. (I did buy it new) I would recommend the movie for any age group and since its only a little over 20 minutes long its fun to watch with little children who don't have a long attention span.,1322438400,,401,3.8433734939759034

Now, with the grandchildren, we are all still enjoying it (sometimes not just at Christmas).  It is one of our most treasured traditions--we wish everyone could see it and enjoy it as much as we do.

The picture was good and it's held up well over time. It's evry bit as corny and fun as it was two decades ago. Seriously, when your kids ask who the california raisiens are.

1894273,5,B00009WHRN,"Years ago, when Claymation Christmas was shown on TV, I fell in love with it.  I taped it, commercials and all, and showed it to kids in my music classes, pointing out how familiar Christmas songs could be performed in different musical styles and how art could be used to enhance them as well.  I thought this was destined to become one of those timeless Christmas classics that would be shown every year.  Alas, it disappeared from the lineup all too soon, and I was left with my home-taped, less-than-professional videotape.  I searched for years for a video to buy, but then DVDs came along and my search continued - and this year, I finally found it on Amazon.com!
I still love it....Carol of the Bells, with a very expressive ""bell"" orchestra, never fails to make me laugh out loud.  Joy to the World is not only a beautiful, soulful musical  arrangement, but the artistic interpretation is spell-binding.  O Christmas Tree is amazingly intricate.  The ice ballet to Angels We Have Heard on High is another belly-laugh-producer.
I do miss the commercials - they were corny but cute.  The Halloween and Easter sections do nothing for me - but it was well worth the purchase price to finally get my hands on a DVD of my all-time favorite Christmas program!",1292112000,,1260,4.6909090909090905

Even if I had enjoyed all three programs, I don't think the price should be more than $10 for this product.  The quality is terrible because nothing was remastered, and the running time of all shows is only about an hour.  I don't know how they came up with the price on this one.

Regardless, I don't know of any other legal way to acquire this program unless you're able to buy a used copy, and I can't say that I expected really great quality.  So, if you're a fan, try to get it used.  If you can't get it used, $20 won't usually break the bank, but I don't know if I'd buy it at that price again.",1232668800,46,816,4.253246753246753

The later two episodes centers on a greedy, selfish, manipulative, and down-right criminal pig with a New York accent.  In the Easter Celebration, this pig kidnaps the Easter Bunny after he kidnapped the original.  In the Halloween celebration, he tries to gain power by controlling Frankenstein's monster.

1894343,4,B00009WHRN,"I have fond memories of watching Will Vinton's ""Claymation Christmas"" about 20 years ago. Made at a time when claymation was still considered cutting-edge, ""A Claymation Christmas"" is in the format of a variety show, with dialogue between the hosts interspersed with musical numbers. The hosts are the loveable dinosaurs Rex and Herb, and make the perfect odd couple. Rex is serious, mature, and dignified, whereas Herb is playful, childlike, and constantly makes a fool of himself. As such, the banter between the 2 is  quite amusing. Another humorous aspect to Rex and Herb's interactions is their interruptions by groups singing a distorted version of the Wassail song. First, a group of dogs with a portable Waffle stand come, singing ""Here we come a-waffling""; then a group of geese come singing ""Here we come a-waddling""; then a group of pigs come singing ""Here we come a-wallowing"". In each instance, Herb goes over to the group and gorges himself with whatever treats they're offering.

The musical numbers include:

""We Three Kings""- The Wise Men sing the verses, and their camels sing the  chorus, bebop style.
""Carol of the Bells""- Performed by anthropomorphic church bells that hit themselves with hammers to sound their own particular notes. Maestro Quasimodo conducts. All goes well, except for one inept bell who never seems to hit his note correctly or at the right time, until the final note. This one's hilarious!
""O Christmas Tree""- Takes place at a Christmas tree, with various scenes inside the ornaments.
""Angels We Have Heard on High""- Takes place on a frozen lake, with hilarious antics involving penguins and two ice-skating walruses!
""Joy to the World""- A soul/jazz version of the popular Christmas song, with kaleidoscopic images in stain-glassed windows. This one was actually my least favorite.
""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer""- Performed by the California Raisins. You know you're an 80s child if you remember them.
""Here We Come A-Wassailing""- Ensemble Finale, sung when a group of elves arrive finally singing the correct version of the song.

""Claymation Christmas"" will delight people of all ages, at Christmas or any other time of the year. I have not yet watched the Halloween or Easter specials on the DVD, though it's hard to go wrong with Will Vinton.",1197936000,,2290,5.096

Our 2 sons enjoyed this 1987 special as boys and got a kick out of it when I played it for our 2006 Christmas gathering. The Easter and Halloween specials are also included on the DVD. The Easter special is quite humorous as a pig attempts to replace the Easter Bunny. I always appreciate stop motion animation; extremely time consuming to produce but enjoyable to watch. Wallace and Gromit animations are similar family fun entertainment.,1169164800,,643,4.908256880733945

It was a treat to be able to see the Claymation Christmas since it was televised repeatedly each Christmas season in the late 80s-early 90s.  The detail and precision that went in to producing these claymation characters always amazed me.  I could never forget the scenes of animals and creatures singing various Christmas carols with the hilarious added spike of humor and California Raisens singing Rudolph the Rednosed Reindeer in the end.  It quickly became a tradition to watch every year when I was younger.  Now that I have this DVD as an adult, I am able to share this special with my younger nephews who enjoyed the special as much as I did.

The other two claymation animations on this dvd I remember vaguely as well.  A Halloween and Easter special that both feature a misbehaving pig character.  These two animations I could have done without.  I remember them vaguely and they aren't nearly as good or fun to watch as the Claymation Christmas special.

1894380,5,B00009WHRN,"Now that the kids are a little too old for Rudolph, the Claymation Christmas special is the holiday film to watch. Its send-up of pedantic folks like ourselves (who love to lecture on the meaning of Christmas words) is humbling, in a good way. The hilarity as Rex the dinosaur tries his best to get everyone to sing ""The Wassailing Song"" properly becomes the recurring theme in the piece. His co-host, treat-loving dino Herb -- tries his best to keep the mood light and his stomach full. Meanwhile, the mangling of Rex's project continues: geese singing about ""Here we come a-waddlng""; pigs singing of ""wallowing""; batter-baking dogs of ""waffling,"" sending Rex's BP spiking through the ceiling.

The animated skits are perfect. The Motown sounds of ""We Three Kings"" and ""Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer"" (playfully set in a seedy urban neighborhood and played by the Califormia Raisins) bring the tunes up to date. The most incredible piece artistically is ""Joy to the World"" -- with its gospel-inspired sound and kaleidiscopic renderings of angels, mothers, father and children. There are ice-skating walruses, adorable penguins, do-wopping camels and more.

Aside from being a hoot, ""Claymation Christmas"" is an artistic tour-de-force in a medium that normally doesn't get that kind of respect. The only problem is that having been crafted as a half-hour show (with commercials) it is so short. Still, ""Claymation Christmas"" is eminently watchable year after year!",1167436800,,1465,5.229787234042553

1894382,5,B00009WHRN,The movie is a wonderful movie for children and adults alike. I purchased it because our old copy (on VHS from over 10 years ago) was worn out. This new dvd came packaged and unharmed just as described.,1141171200,4,202,4.342105263157895
1894383,5,B00009WHRN,This collection is great.  The Christmas collection is the best - a real television classic.  The Wilshire Pig specials are good too - especially the Halloween special.,1140652800,5,168,5.185185185185185
1894384,4,B00009WHRN,"My family has always loved the Claymation Christmas movie, and it has become somewhat of a tradition to watch our recorded copy of the movie each year.  Unfortunately, the copy is quite old and has deteriorated greatly, so it has become increasingly difficult to watch the movie each year.  Now that we have this classic on DVD, our tradition can live on for many years to come and delight future generations!",1140652800,4,409,4.746478873239437
1894389,4,B00009WHRN,"I was hoping, when I purchased this video, to get three wonderful projects like the Claymation Christmas Special.  The Halloween Special and the Easter Special are nothing like the Christmas Special.  They are both stories with a plot that probably appeal to a much younger audience than does the Christmas Special.  I am glad I bought it - the Christmas Special is worth it all by itself.  Perhaps my grandchildren will enjoy the other two selections.",1140480000,4,452,4.907894736842105
1894390,5,B00009WHRN,"Now that Wallace and Gromit and the Aardman Studios creations are well promoted all over the world, the medias tend to forget that Will Winton invented Claymation. This master of animation created dozens of wonderful short films, in which animated clay was used to give life to amazing characters. This compilation of three short is great entertainment for the whole family. The funniest of all is the Halloween special, but the Christmas special does have his moments of brillance too. You won't regret buying this !",1140220800,,517,5.023255813953488

1894392,5,B00009WHRN,"One of the oldest forms of animation, and one of the hardest to get right, is claymation - the art of using clay models and stop-action photography. Without a doubt, the past Master of claymation is Ray Harryhausen. Will Vinton is a worthy contender.

This DVD contains three holiday specials. In the Easter special, Wilshire Pig attempts to become the new Easter Bunny.  It's got a good script, good music, and is shot and edited well.

In the Halloween special, Wilshire Pig and his less-than-enthusiastic sidekick Sheldon Snail locate Dr Frankenswine's secret diary and go off in search of his monster.

The best of the three, however, is Claymation Christmas. In this special a T-Rex named Rex and a Triceratops named Herb explore various Christmas songs and a undertake a hilarious search for the meaning of ""Wassail"". Fans of the California Raisins will be pleased to see them here doing ""Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer"" in their own wonderful style. This song alone is worth the price of the DVD.

I can't say enough about this DVD. It's appropriate for all age groups, yet doesn't bore or insult the intelligence of adult viewers. I sincerely hope we haven't seen the last of Will Vinton.",1138579200,,1196,4.87192118226601

1894395,5,B00009WHRN,"I knew it wasn't a dream! There really was a Claymation Christmas! I do believe this is one of the funniest christmas specials of the 1980's! I always remembered this one, but I'm sure this hasn't aired since I was a little kid. In the spirit of Christmas I am trying to dig up all the goods that I can, because there is nothing better during the holidays than parking the kids in front of the TV to watch countless hours of Christmas specials! This one here is a MUST! Its got the CALIFORNIA RAISINS in it. Nuff said. Although I do also remember a scene with a pig popping an 8-track into his car stereo.

The Christmas video has great songs, is humorous, and ideal for kids of all ages.  The Halloween and Easter video aren't funny, aren't well made, and are so bad it was actually embarassing to watch them.

5 stars for Christmas, 1 star for Halloween, 2 stars for Easter -- that averages out to a slightly less than 3.",1132790400,7,424,4.702702702702703

Now I have introduced it to my 3 year old and it's as if the California Raisins were new and popular again. The halloween special and the christmas special are both good. The easter special, I had never seen before I purchased the DVD. That was ok. But the Christmas special, which I consider the best of the 3, is worth the purchase alone.

1894401,3,B00009WHRN,"I purchased the Will Vinton's Claymation Christmas DVD for my wife, and while she was happy to be able to see the show again, the DVD was disappointing.
I can understand the video and audio being a bit weak since older, ""made-for-TV"" show, and there was no remastering involved, but they didn't even bother to make the audio the same level between the three shows (it includes a Halloween and Easter show). I think it was in the Easter show, the audio fades in and out between loud and barely audible.",1070928000,10,501,4.516483516483516

I was more than excited to see that I can toss that old fuzzy, 16-year-old VHS recording & buy the DVD! The California Raisins are so much fun, but the Carol of the Bells is still my favorite clip. Joy is a very classic clip!
However, the Comedy of Horrors is not particularly a classic Halloween special (it goes too fast & doesn't add up much). The Easter special is nice.
The DVD functions can be a little confusing trying to get to the Comentary, but it is pretty simple otherwise.",1069113600,8,593,4.6571428571428575

The best bits in the Christmas movie are the Carol of the Bells and Angels We Have Heard On High scenes because they are hilarious, but they are all really beautifully done.  I am not religious so there is no meaning in the song to me, but the Joy to the World scene is visually beautiful and another one of my favorites.",1518566400,,623,4.040650406504065
