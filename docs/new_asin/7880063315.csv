Having read the book numerous times (both in English and in Chinese), this is a well done version.

I would recommend this to anyone interested in classical Chinese literature....",1391558400,3,273,5.044444444444444
7900331,5,7880063315,"This product is a Chinese produced televised serial of one of the most justly famous novels of Chinese and world literature. Of the several filmed versions (refer to Wikipedia), this is so far generally considered the best. There is a problem trying to play this on most DVD players bought in the U.S. because this DVD set is coded for the Asian region, and it probably won't play. It's worth purchasing an inexpensive region-free DVD player to see this adaptation of the 18th century incredible novel. The seller (Bible In My Language) was prompt and responsive resolving the difficulty.",1379030400,2,588,4.94949494949495
7900332,2,7880063315,"I've watched many Asian historical TV drama series. And like the Korean dramas by far the best. For stories based on history with plenty of action, suspense and excitement, nothing compares with the best of the Koreans. Like:  Jumong, Emperor of the Sea, Iljimae, Yi San, Hong Gil Dong, Mighty Chilwu, Damo, and others.

Whereas, the Chinese historical TV drama series seem to tend to getting bogged down in a pace better-suited to the history channel. Like A Romance of the Three Kingdoms. And this one: A Dream of Red Mansions. Admittedly, I am not qualified to comment on its entirety. But that's only because I found it too boring to watch anymore after a little over an hour into it. Maybe later I'll get back to it and finish it off. For now I'll have to say adios to it. I gave it two stars, instead of just one, because the production values seemed to be there. Not much else. Even the main female character, supposedly portraying a lady of great beauty, wasn't.",1255824000,,970,4.568965517241379
