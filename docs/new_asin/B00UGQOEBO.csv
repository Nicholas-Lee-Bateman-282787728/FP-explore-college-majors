If you have gone after the History Channel dvds, or National Geographic dvds on Rome and you still want a bit more then you may enjoy this, but only purchase the box set, probably used will be the way to go.  Kinda cheesy, using mostly old,grainy stock footage, only one musical theme, but charming surprisingly by its kitchiness.  The special  effects are not much to look at but, again, charming like an old movie from the 30s and 40s.  A few nice interviews from experts, little bits of actors [in color!], but the series is well written and Peter Coyote is likable as the narrator.  Each disc offers mini extras that again are somehow quite charming. I suppose the Romans and their 1000 year empire, no cell phones or computers, still grabs us!",1469750400,,772,4.639705882352941
