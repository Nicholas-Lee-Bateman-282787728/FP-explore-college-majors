This is a seriously bad ducumentary into wordsound that I used to respect before watching this rubbish. It really would have been nice to see something even slightly proffesional. Don't waste your money on there DVD, buy some DUB CD's instead.",1119657600,,399,4.391891891891892
8214259,5,B0002WBI7U,"This was verry interesting. verry intertaining. an intemate look at wordsound crooklyn dub style.  on the disc their is a 74 min dubumentary featuring director and label head skiz fernando, scarab, professor shehab(baboon, barakka label), bill laswell, robbie shakespear, sly dumbar, 2 sec of syles scott, sensational, wu tang clan, method man, quaballah steppers, scotty hard, prince paul and others.  The film goes through the 10 years of how the label started and skiz, and all the counter parts of the crooklyn sceen, touring, shows, and overseas sceens.  My favorite part is when they explained bills transformation from green point studios to new jerseys orange music.  Sly and robbie were their recording i think version born their newest album with laswell.  Laswells regular enginer and musical counterpart was also their robert musso showing you the ins and outs of their set up and tools.  They constantelly come back to bill for interview and insight.  The dubumentary showcasses lots of dub electro stuff but also has a lot of rap and hip hop oriented stuff with wu tang, prince paul, sensational and others.  Also featured is an uncut interv iew from bill about his start in music and like 21:00 min, videos by spectre, metabolics and prince paul which are verry hip hop oriented.  This is a rare look into the never sceen look at a world of wordsound and its counter parts.  For anyone interested in a great look into underground music that explors the smooky underbelly of electric music, dub and production this is for you.  This is saposed to be limited to 1,000 coppies so get it will you can before its gone up in smoke",1107734400,3,1639,4.859712230215828
