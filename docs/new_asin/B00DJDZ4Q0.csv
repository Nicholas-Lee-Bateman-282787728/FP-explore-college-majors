5819420,5,B00DJDZ4Q0,"While this series may have started as a tribute to Mystery Science Theater 3000, the guys and gals at ICWXP very quickly developed their own style. At the start of Season 2, they switched from riffing feature films, and started to riff shorts. This allowed them to expand their story-line far beyond what was ever attempted on MST3K. These ""host segments"" have become more elaborate, and more than just a framing element to pad out the show. The writing is very crisp, and always hilarious!

The movie riffing is the best you'll find outside the current projects that the former MST3K cast members are producing. The writing is always on target, with plenty of pop-culture references. And don't worry if you're not up on current pop-culture. These guys love the classic nerd-culture, too!

The episodes are roughly an hour long, roughly split in half between the movie riffing and the host segments (story-line). But the DVDs are also loaded with plenty of extras, including behind-the-scenes footage, commentary during the host segments, bonus shorts, interviews, and music videos. You can easily kill a whole evening with this DVD!

If you're a fan of MST3K, don't hesitate to get it. It's gonna feel familiar and new, all at the same time. Even if you've never seen the inspiration for this show, if you're a fan of irreverent comedy, you're gonna love it!",1372464000,2,1359,4.9
5819421,5,B00DJDZ4Q0,"Although similar to it's predecessor, the timeless Mystery Science Theater 3000, it has carved a niche of it's own.
Featuring Rick Wolf, a member of CORPS (Command of Reanimate Processing and Suppression), surviving in an abandoned movie theater with only sarcastic robots as he friends.  The theater runs bad films and is surrounded by a horde of the undead... Or is it?
This disc starts season 2 where the game has changed.  Rikk, with amnesia, has to digest the past few years of pop culture canibalism and the threat of his release.
This episode is the first of a shorter format, higher definition filming, and with plot elements.
Why should you buy?  Well, if you like shots across the bow to pop culture icons by funny robots and still feel the need for riffs (commentary mocking films and short subjects) by sillohueted beings, you won't be disappointed.",1372464000,3,861,4.843537414965986
8593790,5,B00DJDZ4Q0,"Fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000 will adore this new take on bad movie riffing.  Why do you need an extensive review to decide if you'll like it?? Are you a MST3K fan? Then why haven't you purchased this yet?!

All kidding aside, the team behind ICWXP are original, smart, and downright hilarious. Plenty of extra goodies on the DVD make for extra laughs. Support an independent production and get yourself a copy today!",1381104000,,424,4.716216216216216

These Guys are so Funny and amazingly talented.. They really put there heart and soul into the making each episode and it really shows.. The ICWXP has what has been missing from TV and Movies for a long time.. People who love and care about what they do.. and they actually care about what their fans think and want to see as well..  As I mentioned before I haven't seen this much devotion and hard work poured into  a show and story and characters since The original Muppet Show.  I am a HUGE, HUGE MST3K fan, I even have replica of the bots thas how huge.. and I have to honestly say that ICWXP is Funnier.. Everyone that I have shown this show to has laughed their butts off..  Also a Huge Zombie/horror fan and have put on professional Haunted houses for a few years in the past and I have to say that the special effects are amazing..

8593792,5,B00DJDZ4Q0,"Seriously, Mike Nelson of Mystery Science Theater 3,000 loves these creators, and helps sell their wonderful riff DVDs.  This scrappy, hard-working group of central mid-westerners does a fine, fitting tribute to MST3K, yet takes their robots and human in all new directions.  As good as the riffing of the short subject is, the host segments in the movie theater (still surrounded by zombies?) are what really stand out for me.

My favorite line: ""Ow... Catheter still in.""

And do check out the DVD extras, especially ""Rick vs, Bride of the Gorilla,"" so you can experience a bit of what you missed, and why you won't want to miss buying all their DVDs before they're gone.

The Incognito Cinema Warriors will give you good value for your money, and the more of their disks you have, the more synergy bonuses you'll get.  :-)

The other disks can be bought directly from ICWXP.  I don't think Amazon wants me to post a link, but it will be worth your while to check out the ICWXP site.  There are several free videos, including an hour-long review of the ""Resident Evil"" movies.",1372723200,,1078,4.691489361702128
8593793,5,B00DJDZ4Q0,"Hello, Darlings! Your humble foodie is here to review the new Incognito Cinema Warriors XP out on Route 5!

After hearing about this Asian burger joint / traditional Mori-Lithuanian fusion barbeque from a few of my fellow gastronomes, I hoped in the car and made my way there posthaste!  Their menu is robust, offering 93 unique dishes; from pan grilled lemon mahi-mahi sausage rolls, to more adventurous fare like the premotor cortex of a rhesus monkey served on a bed of wild circuit boards - in a dish Chef Jon S'lon (?) calls ""The remains of my primate butler.""

While a gourmand's delight, this venue also provides entertainment during your meal.  While the short subject film presented was frequently interrupted by three individuals seated nearer to the front than myself, their commentary was poignant and did address many of the shortcomings of the material.

After gorging myself on lemon-pepper capers smothered in some manner of viscous brown sauce - which I was assured by Chief Executive Sous Chef Topsy Bot 5000 (these young metal people and their ""rap"" names) was only 75% of a lethal dose - I was introduced to proprietor Rikk ""Rick"" Wolf.  Rikk seemed confused as to why I was eating out of what turned out to be a dumpster behind what I now understand to be an abandoned movie theater.  I explained that I had been sent by the Kansas City Comet to cover the opening of the new restaurant and that the honest people of Kansas City deserved an honest restaurant review.  Rikk explained that society had collapsed due to an outbreak of some pandemic, and wanted to know about the throbbing wound on my arm and how long it had been since I was bitten.  In my fevered state I couldn't remembered but was sure to ask if he'd mind sharing their delicious recipe for braised human flesh piloff.

Rikk nervously shut the door, and I found myself alone in the alley.

I've stood here for what seemed like days... the throbbing in my arm slowly turning into a dull ache, the dull ache eventually becoming complete numbness.  The wound isn't even bleeding any more...  but my head is pounding...  feeling confused... hungry...

Maybe I'll lie down now... see what dreams carry me to tomorrow, maybe I'll meet a lot of tasty people there.",1372636800,8,2244,4.717948717948718
8593794,5,B00DJDZ4Q0,"These DVDs are right up there with the Mystery Science Theater 3000 DVDs.  Funny, smart, clever.....basically, if you like movie riffing, you will love these.",1372550400,2,158,5.32
8593795,5,B00DJDZ4Q0,"ICWXP, much like MST3K, is best enjoyed with plenty of friends around (but not required!). The jokes are well written and tend to stay above toilet humor, on top of a faster pace of riffing. The movies these guys review are absolutely insane, this one in particular still baffles me. While season 2 episodes are shorts rather than movies, the host segments are much longer and keep a good balance of plot progression and jokes. Definitely worth picking up, or at the very least watching if you are any type of movie-riffing fan.",1372464000,2,528,4.688172043010753
8593796,5,B00DJDZ4Q0,"Whilst yearning for some MST3K, I came across these guys. Of course I saw the similarities, but by not being bound to the rules of a network, they have brought something totally new and refreshing to the table. I really dig the hipper, more adult-oriented humor. There's also a well thought out si-fi/horror plot that ties the episodes together and leaves you yearning for more. Definitely give this show a try. You'll be glad you did.",1372464000,2,435,4.7368421052631575
8593797,5,B00DJDZ4Q0,"Zombies, Robots, and bar of soap with man legs is all you need to know... A devout fan of MST3K, I was thrilled to find ICWXP.  Watch it.",1372464000,2,137,3.892857142857143
8593798,5,B00DJDZ4Q0,"For the uninitiated, ICWXP is a long-running project and is easily the most serious effort to replicate and improve upon the old MST3K formula that fans know and love.  This series features not only well-written spearing of americana via the lens of aging film, but also offers up the ""host segments"" that so many fan-efforts of the form omit.  The production values of these non-riff segments are unmatched.

As opposed to MST3K which focused the lion's share of screen time to the film and used the host segments as a mere framing device and opportunity for more elaborate film-related sight-gags, in this season ICWXP uses the host segments to provide consistent continuing story arcs about the world in which the series takes place.  New truths are revealed and new villains and allies alike come to light as our heroes continue their projection-lighted vigil against the undead hordes outside the walls of Cine-A-Sorrow Theater.  While the first season riffed feature-length films, Season 2 focuses on the quirky education shorts of the past.  This gives the cast a great target for rapid-fire jokes and extra screen-time to create more in-depth host-story elements.

This particular episode, ""Victory Gardens"" is one of their best successes to date.  The combination of retro family dynamics and war-time propaganda make a fitting banquet of stinging barbs and laughter.  This comedic victory, coupled with the game-changing elements that alter the course of the ICWXP mythos make this a must own DVD.

This disc contains the complete 47 minute episode along with several special features including commentary, behind-the-scenes footage of set and prop remodeling, zombie-walk event footage, a music video, and preview of the the next episode.

Pick up this disc today and laugh yourself into the ground-floor of next-level independent comedy.",1372464000,3,1849,5.276450511945392
8593799,5,B00DJDZ4Q0,"As a massive MST3K fan since they were on Public Television & avid Rifftrax viewer - these guys are Fantastic!  Every episode is well thought out with brilliant cut scenes and joke writing, nothing but professionalism with the Incognito crew.  You will be hooked & wanting more & more!",1372464000,4,285,4.795918367346939
