8145741,5,B000IJ7A38,"This effective documentary on the Pacific war begins with Japanese preparations before the bombing of Pearl Harbor and ends with the U.S. dropping the atomic bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Aside from the interesting footage on the Japanese home front before Pearl Harbor, there are also many questions raised as to why the U.S. was not aware that Pearl Harbor might be bombed. Evidence is given that enemy planes were sighted earlier and messages were decoded, both in time to give plenty of warning. Aside from these questions, and many scenes of battles, there is also footage on life in Hawaii before the war broke out. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, Rovi
