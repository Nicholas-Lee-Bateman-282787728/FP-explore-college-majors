1378242,5,B00004YS83,"Return of the Warriors is by far the most action packed Pride I have seen. I just purchased it, and I think to myself: 'why didn't I buy this DVD first?' out of the 9 matches on this DVD/Video; at least 7 is awesome.
*Match 1*
Vitor Belfort vs. Daijiro Matsui
-This match was the icebreaker for this great event. alot of ground fighting, but, with the man in the guard punishing the man on the bottom. not the most exciting match, but, it got the event going....
*Match 2* <--Awesome Fight/Best fight of the event
Guy Mezger vs. Vanderlei Silva
-From the beginning bell to the end, this match is non-stop. not a single take down was attempted. this match was a straight ahead brawl. one of the best knockouts in a very long time....
*Match 3*
Ricco Rodriguez vs. Giant Ochiai
-This match is both stand-up and take down. a couple of slick defense moves on the mat made this match last longer than anticipated....
*Match 4*
Gilbert Yvel vs. Gary Goodridge
-Oh My Goodridge!! Do not blink during this match....
*Match 5*
Mark Kerr vs. Borisov Igor
-This is a match between a veteran of Pride and a new-comer. American Wrestling vs. Russian Sambo. a fighter in alot of pain is left on the mat after the match....
*Match 6*
Enson Inoue vs. Igor Vovchanchyn
-One man at the opening bell threw many wild rights and lefts. a lot of action for the first couple of minutes. but, when it goes to the ground, a lot of punishment is dealt out. even with his opponent in the guard, he takes alot of punishment....a little too much....
*Match 7*
Ken Shamrock vs. Kazuyuki Fujita <--Awesome fight
-One man is coming back for his 2nd match in his long lay-off, the other man is coming off of one of the biggest upsets in NHB history. alot of action in this match as well. 2 very tired fighters with an ending that lets you realize that stamina is definately a key in fighting....
*Match 8*
Ryan Gracie vs. Tokimitsu Ishizawa
-very explosive debut for one of these fighters. after getting put in a semi-submission move in the beginning, the fighter is able to work his way out and dominate from there....
*Match 9/Main Event*
Kazushi Sakuraba vs. Renzo Gracie
-Unlike the Royler/Sakuraba fight, Renzo is definately game. the first round is excellent. many counters and not too many attempts at ...-scoot kicks. again, Renzo is game. but, with time almost running out, another shocking ending was amongst the NHB-world....
this is definately a must buy if you are a collector of Pride. I was once a fan of the UFC, but, Pride is where all the top fighters in the world compete. do not accept any pretenders, this is the best mixed martial arts competition EVER.",1012694400,14,2642,4.552521008403361
1378243,5,B00004YS83,"Every fight on this card is a must see.  Interesting Ken Shamrock match against a tough opponent.  Surprises in almost every fight.  Please, if there is a better DVD out there, let me know.",995846400,,189,4.5
1378244,4,B00004YS83,"Pride Fighting Championship is the Super Bowl of the Mixed Martial Arts. This event is from the Seibu Dome outside of Tokyo, Japan. Nine fights are shown and one omitted from the DVD. The first fight is between Vitor Belfort and Daijiro Matsui. Belfort the UFC 12 Heavyweight Tournament Champion shocked the world by defeating Gilbert Yvel at Pride 9 also at Pride 9 Matsui suffered a five minute beating at the hands of Igor Vovchanchyn. This fight is a long, but interesting fight.
The second fight is between Lion's Den fighter Guy Mezger and ""The Axe Murderer"" Vanderlei Silva. Mezger is a former King of Pancrase and the UFC 13 Middleweight Tournament Champion with a win over Tito Ortiz. Silva an International Vale Tudo and UFC veteran with knockout victories over Mike Van Arsedale and Todd Medina. This fight is a short, but exciting fight.
The third fight is between Ricco Rodriguez and ""Giant"" Ochiai. Rodriguez at the time was the King of the Cage Heavyweight Champion also was the 1998 Abu Dhubi Submission Wrestling Tournament champion in the 99kg and above weight class and stunned the Pride organzation by beating Gary Goodridge at Pride 9. Ochiai had only one fight before this fight. This fight may surprise you, but the ending won't.
The fourth fight is between ""The Hurricane"" Gilbert Yvel and ""Big Daddy"" Gary Goodridge. Yvel a former RINGS Openweight Champion and a Cage Fight Tournament winner. Goodridge is the UFC 8 finalist and the International Vale Tudo Championship 1 Tournament winner also holds knockout victories over Oleg Taktarov and Paul Herrera. The is another short and exciting fight with an ending that will leave you speechless.
The fifth fight is between ""The Titan"" Mark Kerr and Borisov Igor. Kerr the UFC 14 & 15 Heavyweight Tournament Champion, The World Vale Tudo Championship 3 Tournament winner and 1999 and 2000 Abu Dhubi Submisson Wrestling tournament winner in the openweight part of the event. Igor is a Sambo Champion out of Russia, but this is second Mixed Martial Arts fight. The fight is good, but the ending will not surprise you.
The sixth fight is between Enson Inoue and ""The Lethal Weapon of the North"" Igor Vovchanchyn. Inoue is a UFC 13 veteran and Japan Vale Tudo veteran and holds a victory over UFC Heavyweight Champion Randy Couture. Vovchanchyn is a IFC Tournament winner, The World Vale Tudo Championship 5 tournament winner and the Pride Grand Prix 2000 tournament finalist. This is a great fight and brutal.
The seventh fight is between Ken Shamrock and Kazuyuki Fujita. Fujita shocked the whole Mixed Martial Arts world with his victory over Mark Kerr. Shamrock is the first King of Pancrase and a UFC Superfight champion. This fight is alright, but the ending is really confusing.
The Masaki Satake vs. Kazunari Mukarami is not on the DVD.
The eighth fight is between Ryan Gracie and Tokimitsu Ishizawa. Ishizawa is pro wrestler Kendo Ka Shin from the New Japan Pro Wrestling Organzation. This fight is very short, but exciting.
The ninth and final fight is between Kazushi Sakuraba and Renzo Gracie. Sakuraba holds victories over two of Renzo family members Royler & Royce. Renzo is the World Combat Championship Tournament winner and holds a knockout victory over Oleg Taktarov. This fight is great and the ending may make you cringe.
Overall a great DVD, but I wish they would show the entrances of all the fighters.",995500800,11,3392,4.911149825783972
1378245,5,B00004YS83,"What can I say?I think I'm the only english guy to review this and it's amazing. I've got loads of NHB DVDs and this tops them all. The fight card is the best ever and the action is non stop. If you're after submissions or knock-outs this has it all. Igor is my favourite fighter and his match is worth the purchase alone. Saku vs Renzo is also a must see. Forget UFC (hard to believe I know), forget WWF (please,we want realism,not fancy dress parties!) If you have any interest in martial arts or NHB fighting this is a MUST BUY! PS.If you want to know how to execute a perfect roundhouse kick,just study Gilbert Yvel,Gary Goodridge didn't know what hit him!",992822400,,660,4.373983739837398
1378246,5,B00004YS83,"I am a long time UFC fan and had heard about PRIDE for a while...this is the first pride tournament that I'd seen and I'm pleased to say that I loved it.  The venue and production are huge...and the fighters are all top shelf....VITOR BELFORT, GUY MEZGER, VANDERLEI SILVA, MARK KERR, RICO RODRIGUEZ, SAKURABA, RYAN & RENZO GRACIE and IGOR VOVCHANCHIN show their wares in this tourny.  Heaps of variety in the style and results of the fights too. The commentary is really informative...and quite funny too. They get into an argument about whether Igor V can be arm barred or not....I'm pretty sure the two guys had a punch up afterward. I haven't seen fights this good since a night out on the town in Hastings New Zealand.  If you like MMA because of submission hold etc this is for you.......",989625600,4,793,4.570422535211268
1378247,5,B00004YS83,"This is yet another PRIDE event, which just continue to get better.  The action is great...from the 1 kick knock-out to the ""elbow popping"" ending.  This DVD shows why the PRIDE event is rated above UFC, King of the Cage, and Battlecade - no comparison.",988070400,2,253,4.6
1378248,5,B00004YS83,"Pride is simply put the greatest mixed martial arts tournament in the universe! Witness ""BIG DADDY"" Gary Goodridge get knocked out in only 27 seconds by Gilbert Yvel, Vanderlei silva rings Guy Mezger's bell, and if you don't beleive the hype about Kazushi Sakuraba ask Renzo Gracie how his arm is! Forget UFC this is where the big boys play wether you like grappling or standup this is the dvd for you it has it all, superbly produced and packaged you simply must have a copy if you like mixed martial arts, jiu jitsu, pro wrestling, vale tudo and muay tai are all seen this production has more variety and quality than any other DVD.....

1378250,5,B00004YS83,"For those of you who've never heard of Pride Fighting Championship, it's basically the Superbowl of MMA (mixed martial arts).  All the best fighters in the world go over there to fight because 1) the competition is the best in the world, 2) they treat and pay a lot more than any other events like UFC. They fight in a ring instead of a cage and the fans in Japan are really knowledgable about the techniques and skills of all the fighters.  For you UFC fans who wonder where all of the fighters like Gary Goodridge, Mark Coleman, Mark Kerr, Ken Shamrock, Vitor Belfort, etc. all went...  Well, they left to sign to fight at Pride cause it's just better.  See for yourselves!  This Pride 9 was awesome.  Can't wait till Pride FC Grand Prix 2000 comes out on video.  Get off the weak UFC and start watching Pride.  It's like College Basketball vs. NBA.  The caliber of competition and talent just doesn't compare.",972172800,15,912,4.512195121951219

The interfaces are fantastic and it is full of special features. The event itself is an absolute MUST OWN for any MMA fan. This clearly is one of the very brightest moments in the history of Pride as far as I am concerned. All of the fights are interesting (I never even had to hold down the FF button on my remote, which is an all to common thing with Pride DVDs). BUY THIS!",1141084800,,515,4.26530612244898
7927716,4,B00004YS83,"These guys who are ranting on about how Pride is superior to UFC have NO idea what they're talking about. I bought this DVD because of the rave reviews and discovered a few things:

1. The Pride rules calling for 10 minute rounds tend to slow the action down significantly vs. UFC 5 minute rounds. It's as if the fighters in Pride know they have plenty of time and often nothing much happens for minutes at a time. In contrast, UFC fights are often non-stop action crammed into 3 or 5 five-minute rounds. UFC is much superior in this regard.

2. Pride referees often let the fighter stall in locked up positions for minutes at a time without breaking them apart to re-start the action. In UFC, this kind of non-action is not tolerated and the ref will break the stalling much quicker and get the fight back to action again. Again, UFC is superior.

All in all it's a pretty good DVD but after all the superlative ranting about how this is ""the best""- please, give me a break!",1132358400,2,975,4.405555555555556
7927717,5,B00004YS83,"PRIDE 10 is one of the greatest events ever released, put on by PRIDE Fighting Championships, the greatest MMA company in the world.

This event has it all: brutal knockouts, incredible submissions, and the greatest fighters in the world.  Above all, it showcases MMA legend Kazushi Sakuraba in his prime and in all his glory.  Sakuraba is regarded not only as the greatest fighter in history, but also the most colorful and entertaining.  It is not hard to see why in this event.

This is a must-own event for any hardcore fight fan.",1131580800,2,534,4.698924731182796
7927718,5,B00004YS83,"I have been an MMA fan for a long time; UFC, KOTC, etc. I have occasionally watched Pride. After I saw this event I have become a true fan of pride fighting.  With so many big names on this card it was hard not to love every minute of the action.  Vitor Belfort shows why he is still the ""Phenom"" by dominating his opponent the entire fight.  Yvel wins with one of the most punishing kicks I have ever seen.  Watch as Mark Kerr's opponent has to be carried out on a stretcher. And don't miss Sakuraba defeat yet another Gracie with the sickest Kamura I have ever seen.  This event put PRIDE FC on the map!!!",1111017600,2,607,4.153846153846154
7927719,5,B00004YS83,"If you haven't bought a Pride FC DVD yet,  Than this is the one to start with.  virtually all the big names are on it and the Sakuraba Vs Renzo fight alone is worth the cost of the DVD.  Compared to UA, KOTC,UFC and others, Pride FC rules restrict the use of certain techniques so the fights aren't ""Anything Goes"" style, but instead promote active competition and balances striking and grappling techniques.  The result is a much more interesting fight rather than the boring one guy on top penning the bottom man down by holding the chainlink fence type that were common in UFC fights.",1068595200,2,587,4.561904761904762
7927720,5,B00004YS83,"At the end of this PRIDE the commentators wonder how they should rate this event. The were of the opinion that so far this was the best pride event ever. I understand very well why they come to this conclusion. I myself have seen many MMA events but i never before have seen so many great fights in just one single event/tournament. Exciting fights do not necessarly need two superb fighters. I have seen a lot of thrilling fights with fighters who later, as the competition in MMA evolves, are facing other warriors and then it appears that these fighters aren't that great as i expected. However, at this moment participating in PRIDE are the best fighters in the world. Whithout a doubt. So on this DVD you shall see very exciting fights and these fighters are really the elite of martial artists in the world. What makes this DVD so good is the diversity of the fights in this PRIDE. You will see devastating KO's as well as very thechnical groundwork. The best is saved for last. It is the fight between RENZO GRACIE and 'the graciehunter' SAKURABA. Expect the unexpected. Don't blink, especially not when watching the fight between Gilbert 'Hurricane' Yvel and Gary Goodridge. If you're a fan of MMA, believe me, you should buy this DVD.

7927722,4,B00004YS83,"Pride really hit it's peak with ""Return of the Warriors"". An excellent event with great matchups, Pride 10 really takes the cake.
Fights that really stand out were the Vanderlei Silva/Guy Mezger fight, Gary Goodridge/Yvel encounter, Kazuyuki Fujita/ Ken Shamrock, Ryan Gracie/Tokimitsu Ishizawa, and the exceptional main event between Renzo Gracie and Kazushi Sakuraba.
The main event was another Sakuraba vs. a Gracie matchup. Royce and Royler had proven not to have the tools to beat Sakuraba. Royler really had no business in a NHB fight, while Royce let his fight against Sak carry out for over an hour. Renzo is another fighter all together. His style incorporates more striking and is very initiative. In two exciting rounds we saw two great fighters really giving the audience a treat. The end of the fight saw perhaps one of the most sensational results in MMA history.
Great card!",1013212800,,889,5.054421768707483
