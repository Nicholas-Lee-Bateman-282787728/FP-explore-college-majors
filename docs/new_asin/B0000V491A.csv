8003432,4,B0000V491A,This is a good buy.  Well worth the money.  Although it's a little hard to follow the storyline if you haven't seen the tv series.  The OVA's take place in different times from the tv series.  But I would recommend this anime.,1168300800,,226,4.309523809523809
8003433,5,B0000V491A,"I thought KOR was an entertaining series. Its been years since I have watched this title. The animation wasn't too bad. Watching Godzilla films helped enhance my viewing pleasure. Its a series worth checking. Kasuga is 15 who meets two women Hikaru and Madoka, Hikaru clams she's his girlfriend but Madoka seems to be his true love.",1129680000,,332,4.842105263157895
8003434,5,B0000V491A,"10 years ago I watched this OVA series on rented VHS tapes (back then, only this set was available in commercial release, the TV series was not released commercially in the US until the late 90's). I believe I could have turned my back on anime at any time... up until I watched these OVAs.

Yes, both the OVAs and the TV series revolves around the high school love triangle between Kyosuke, Madoka, and Hikaru. But for those of us past high school age, there is an element of sweet nostalgia in Orange Road. The memories of loves won, lost, and merely dreamed about come flooding back. ""Dance in the memories"" is more than just a song title from the series.

Yes, Kyosuke is a wimp, but with a heart of gold. Bear in mind the problem he faces is that he is not sure how Madoka feels about him. In traditional Japanese culture, if the girl refuses the boy's invitation to ""go steady"", he has no second chance. That's it. End of story. So Kyosuke is tormented... he sees signs that Madoka *might* care for him, then he sees signs that she doesn't. So until he is sure, he waits and dates Madoka's best friend Hikaru.

These episodes flesh out some issues. The OVA ""I Was a Cat, I Was a Fish"" is the one out of these 8 that I really don't care for. ""White Lovers"" is, at it's heart, a story of the true depth of Kyosuke's love for Madoka and what he is willing to risk to prove it.... and incidentally one of the all time favorites of a number of long time KOR fans. While the previous reviewer liked the movie ""I Want to Return to That Day"", many oldtime KOR fans detested it.

Can you do without this set? Sure. But if you enjoy romantic comedy, or if you are a KOR fan, you MUST get this set.",1122336000,5,1693,4.216049382716049
8003435,4,B0000V491A,"I'm going to approach this differently than most of my reviews, because there's a lot to like about this box set.  Saying that, I have to admit that there was not much of a compelling reason story wise to create it.  The set consists of three DVDs; the first two each contain four OAV (direct to video) episodes, of Kimagure Orange Road made after the TV series.  The third DVD is a series-ending movie.  While my overall rating for the set is four stars, the movie rates five stars, therefore, episodes are only fair to good.
What's good about the episodes is the music and animation.  Japanese OAV releases generally have a higher standard than the TV series episodes.  The quality of the animation lives up to that, and they feature many good songs.  Unfortunately, beyond that these are simply fan episodes.  Someone determined there was still a market for KOR stuff, and cranked out a very derivative set of episodes.  The OAV episodes place the KOR principal characters in mostly rehashed situations, created before in the TV series.  They exceeded some of the limits of the Manga, as I would call it, going ""too real"" without just cause.  What I mean is things like adding gunplay to a series that was essentially tame.
The gem of the box set is the movie.  It exceeds the limited reality of the TV series as well, but ""in a good way"".  Since it was to be the ending of the KOR series, it ended the key storyline abruptly.  The entire KOR series was about the romantic triangle between Kyosuke, and two girls he was involved with, Madoka and Hikaru. The triangle, kept alive, because Kyosuke, was one of ""those"" anime characters, which cannot make a decision.  The series became stale, because most people knew that Madoka was his true love, even though he went with Hikaru, as boyfriend and girlfriend.  The movie has a very changed, more adult Kyosuke, making the decision, right or wrong, and then sticking with it.  Rarely have more genuine emotions been on display in an anime of this type.
Reasons to buy the box set:
1. Excellent music, a cut above your usual anime music songs.
2. Fine animation quality, OAV releases are high quality in Japan.
3. Great series ending movie, if it has to end this was the way to do it.
Reasons not to buy the box set:
1. Derivative episodes, if you've seen the TV series there's not much new here.
2. Some OAV episodes overstep the ""reality"" limits the series was based on.
3. The movie (and OVA episodes) is going to be released separately.",1075420800,25,2489,4.582392776523702
