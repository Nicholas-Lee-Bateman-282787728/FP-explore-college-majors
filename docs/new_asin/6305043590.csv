What an inspiration!  Invite a loved friend over (because Tasha's DVD is too good not to share), brew a pot of tea, and sit down to 48 minutes of magic!  :)",1391990400,2,330,4.7368421052631575

952485,3,6305043590,"I enjoyed this DVD but found it too short. I would have loved to have seen more of Tasha's house and also her animals, in particular, her goats. It focused more on her books and painting.",1387411200,3,187,4.222222222222222

952489,5,6305043590,"I just watched this again the other day and I must say it is beautifully done. The narration which is interspersed with Tasha's own words is excellent. Her gardens are beautiful and her life fascinating. The stories about her late father were particularly amusing. It is a must for anyone who is interested in Tasha, gardening, old homes and their furnishings and beautiful illustrations. I highly recommend it.",1272758400,2,411,5.0588235294117645
952490,5,6305043590,"I am so glad that I obtained this wonderful representation of Tasha Tudor's life at home.  From beginning to end, it was nothing short of pure bliss.  It felt like she was having me over for a visit on a beautiful afternoon.  The wonderful gardens we walked through ""she and I"",  as well as her little house tour with the Corgis tagging along behind.  Throughout she interwove  bits of her family history, talking of her mother and her eccentric father.  Both of whom she loved so very much.  Her love of marionettes and her skillful finger dance, using the strings to make them ""come alive"".  Throughout this DVD, she shares bits of herself, quoting poetry, and giving us an inside look into her life. She's quite endearing, and all the while showing a mischievous side on occasion. (I don't want to reveal too much so you'll have to buy the DVD and see !!)  I really enjoyed this visit, and recommend it for anyone who enjoys Tasha and her published works.  It truly is a joy to behold again and again.",1264809600,5,1004,4.49171270718232
952491,5,6305043590,Tasha Tudor who is very well known for her simple lifestyle gives us a wonderful view into her life and simplicity in this wonderful DVD. Anyone who has a kind of kindred spirit for her values and life will greatly enjoy this wonderful DVD.,1264204800,2,240,4.4772727272727275

952543,5,6305043590,"This video is a must see for families.  Not everyone is a gardener but the graceful living and talent of Tasha Tudor should never be forgotten.  Her lifestyle and talent has almost been lost in modern times.  Go back in time to visit the grace and awe of nature and natural living.  Relish her gift of art, gardens, and nature.",1255651200,2,327,4.4
952544,5,6305043590,"If you knew this wonderful lady, purchase this.
If you knew of her work, purchase this.
If you have ever been inspired, purchase this.

We should all be so lucky and fortunate to be able to do what we love, stay true to ourselves and live out our come-to-life fantastical lives.

Tasha is a no-nonsense, delightful, whimsical inspiration to all, and she will very much be missed. If that sentence makes no sense... purchase this, to understand that it very much makes sense, when it comes to Tasha. :)",1231027200,2,501,4.617977528089888
952545,5,6305043590,"I watched this enchanting video about 15 yrs ago on PBS and was enthralled.  I think watching it would be a great tradition (like reading  ""The Night Before Christmas"").  Tasha Tudor reflects a joy of life that is so uplifting. I have been trying to find this for my own artistic grandchildren to inspire them.",1210550400,4,310,4.6
952546,5,6305043590,"The first video tape I received from Amazon was defective and would not work in my VCR.  Amazon has exceptional customer service and immediately followed through with sending me a new copy, simultaneously when I sent the defective one back.  I am completely satisfied with the quality of the replacement video.  If you like Tasha Tudor this is a 48 minute look into her life when she was around 80 years old.  Very quaint and biographical and a very nicely done video.  Would recommend AMAZON and this video.",1191024000,4,508,4.7272727272727275
952547,5,6305043590,I really liked this video. Tasha is amazing in her strength and the way she lives. It is very comforting to watch how she takes care of herself and her love of animals. In all that she does in daily life she always finds time for her art. This  video is a rare treat in this world of today.,1178409600,2,290,3.9152542372881354
952548,5,6305043590,"Tasha Tudor claims that her ""whole life has been a vacation"". Watching this video is like taking a trip with her to a different place and time and coming back with a renewed spirit. While I also enjoy ""Take Peace"" - especially during the Christmas holiday season -  ""Take Joy"" is a wonder for it's aesthetic qualities and insight into the private life of a noted illlustrator as well as a valuable reference tool for the gardener. It mirrors the same tone set in the three ""coffee table"" books about Tasha Tudor done by Tovah Martin, Richard W. Brown, and Tasha Tudor. This short video is artistically crafted,  giving the viewer a glimpse into her private life: her kitchen, her gardens, her dollhouse and marionettes, her books and illustrations, her family history through photographs and some vintage film clips, her sense of humor, her steadfastness and her self-sufficiency.
While I have enjoyed my own copy, I have also given this video as gifts to appreciative friends.  Take Joy is, indeed, a joy.",1028592000,34,1006,4.837209302325581
952549,5,6305043590,"Over the Christmas Holiday's, I saw 'Take Joy-Magical World of Tasha Tudor' & 'Take Peace-Corgi Cottage Christmas' for the first time on cable TV. I can't begin to describe how I felt after viewing these two  films. Miss Tasha Tudor enchanted me. Her life seemed simple, graceful and  magical. I never knew about her until I saw the films. Corgi Cottage is  vision of delight, peace and harmony. It's a place I could only hope to  have someday. Thank you Ms. Tudor for enchanting us with your world of  dreams and fantasies.",947548800,58,524,4.6521739130434785
952550,5,6305043590,"Charismatic,perhaps eccentric,Tasha exhibits an extraordinary insight and interpretation of life around her that is shared with us through her wonderful illustrations and stories, written and verbal. We should all  cherish life as simply and profoundly as she does at Corgi Cottage. Really  makes you reflect on life's priorities.",946425600,11,330,5.854166666666667
952551,5,6305043590,"How inspiring to observe Tasha Tudor's present life.  Yes, she has been successful, has 'had it all' -- marriage, children, meaningful work -- and of course a special gift.  What comes through so wondrously in this video  is that she is a work in progress at 82, involved, loving, reflective and  creative.  I loved this video!",946252800,22,327,4.767857142857143
952552,5,6305043590,"I recently saw this documentary as part of the Christmas Morning programming on public television. What began as a diversion quickly became  a fascinating insight into the artist Tasha Tudor, her philosophy, her way  of life, and her crafts.
The first book I read by Tudor was a copy of  ""Pumpkin Moonshine"", which is almost impossible to find as a used  book at a price mere mortals can afford. There are clips of the paintings  from the book (and many others), which I had not seen in decades.
Tudor  describes her outlook on life, art, and raising children. Many of her real  life experiences find their way into her stories, in one fashion or  another. She also recounts the almost-fantasy world of her own happy  childhood.
Some may feel that her pastimes and lifestyle border on the  rediculous if not the edge of senility. But after watching this insigtful  program, I think you will agree she is far sharper and wiser than most of  us ""normal"" people.",946166400,42,959,4.676646706586826

7881131,5,6305043590,"It is the second time I have ordered it, this time one for a friend and one to pass along to someone.
The only thing that is negative is the US Exchange which means that it actually ends up costing
far more than the ordering price. Total cost with exchange etc. was 53.70 for 1 copy of Take Joy!
My own copy gets lots of viewing especially with the homeschooling crowd who tend to have a love for the good earth as did Tasha Tudor.",1470182400,2,431,4.08235294117647
