8265046,4,B0015K1JP4,It is a great DVD for the little ones and I like the simple story lines for young children along with possitive none violent actions,1393718400,,132,4.32
8265047,3,B0015K1JP4,"I have four kids, and when my older kids were little, they had ""Digging for Treasure"", which unfortunately goes out of it's way to promote the idea that the earth is millions of years old, etc., but I expected as much from any secular program, and liked the other elements of the movie enough to overlook that. Kids see the machines learning to be dependable and not to steal, among other things.
My youngest managed to crack the CD getting it out of the case, which made her very sad, so we re-ordered it and were happy to see it came as a double feature with ""The Big Game."" I was disappointed with the new movie, though, because Wendy always steps in to save a totally helpless Bob- this is like so much mainstream media today making men look inept and in need of a take-charge woman to help them out. It would have been fine in one episode, but it was way overdone.
I also checked out some other Bob the Builder movies at the library and found that the characters often lie to help one another out or to avoid making anyone anxious, and there are never any lasting or serious consequences for mistakes. Everything always works out perfectly. When Rolley accidently backs over a neighbor's flowers, the neighbor says not to worry because he presses flowers as a hobby, so really Rolley just helped him out- how convenient! When Spud breaks all the eggs he is taking from Farmer Pickles to the school, he finds out the lunch lady planned to make omelets, so he says, ""That's OK, then!""
These are fine for young preschoolers, but I found myself explaining a lot to my 6-yr-old that the behavior she sees in the film would not be acceptable in real life.",1388188800,,1654,4.462046204620462
