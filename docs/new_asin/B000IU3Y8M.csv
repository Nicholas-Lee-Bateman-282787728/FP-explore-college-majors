8147434,2,B000IU3Y8M,"If you are a beginner this is not for you .Eric shows what he can do ,and no doubt he does it well but for some one who is just learning Eric gets a D as instructor",1394236800,,164,3.4594594594594597
8147435,4,B000IU3Y8M,This is a superb video from one of rock and rolls all time best drummers. My only complaint is the volume of the program is so low that you have to turn it all the way up to hear it.,1364256000,,182,3.575
8147436,5,B000IU3Y8M,Outstanding,1359244800,,11,11.0
8147437,5,B000IU3Y8M,"I had been looking for this DVD for awhile. It is older, and we used to have it when my husband played drums, but one of my sons is a drummer and wanted this DVD. Eric Singer is a fantastic drummer, and we really like this product.",1356825600,,231,3.9361702127659575
8147438,1,B000IU3Y8M,"I'll cut to the chase; this DVD is complete crap.  Why:

1. He's chewing gum the entire video.
2. The video appears to be a copy of a copy of a copy.  Very poor visuals and not very good sound.
3. He talks about what he does but never about how he does it.
4. Apparently he learned the word ""obviously"" the day he filmed this, because he uses it over and over and over.
5. Production quality is non-existent.
6. Of absolutely no use to a novice, and virtually useless for anyone else.

If you can pick this up for free, with free shipping, it isn't worth the 4 minutes of your life it will take to place the order.  If you find it on the sidewalk, don't risk injuring your back to bend over and pick it up.

Since I can't give this negative stars, I guess I have to give it one.  If there is any redeeming quality to this DVD, it's that you can use the plastic case in the event you have another DVD case that gets damaged.  Just place the Eric Singer DVD in the nearest appropriate receptical.",1294272000,2,994,4.087628865979381
8147439,5,B000IU3Y8M,"Eric Singer gives a lot of tips about what to do and not to while playing at home or stage, also gives you ideas for auditions. I can say is not a beguinners DVD to follow, but doesn't hurt to watch and learn.",1267401600,,209,3.883720930232558
8147440,5,B000IU3Y8M,This instruction video was very impressive.  Eric gave expert advice for novice as well as more experienced drummers.,1243728000,2,117,5.5
8147441,4,B000IU3Y8M,"This DVD is really good.  It's everything a drum DVD should be. The only disapointment is that the sound is sub-standard.  It should be in 5.1 surround but it's not. You have to turn the volume way up when you're watching it. Other than that it's very good. The example of how he plays ""Parasite"" is exceptionaly good.",1172966400,3,318,4.4655172413793105
