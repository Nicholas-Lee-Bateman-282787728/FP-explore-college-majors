1642360,5,B00005PJ8O,Who doesn't think this isn't  a great movie ? George C. Scott at his very best !!,1522886400,,81,3.764705882352941
1642361,5,B00005PJ8O,"George C. Scott plays the character of General Patton with great dexterity and calculated manner. Scott is the reason to watch Patton as the entire viewing experience gets devoted to watching Scott play Patton. It's a character study like no other. You are fascinated at the man that was Patton. Direct in his demeanor, while also intense in his manners, or lack thereof, you are hypnotized by his figure.

Scott plays Patton with a sense of patriotism that defines who Patton is, while also portraying a wild erratic nature to his depiction. Patton is the best war film for it's use of strategy and planning ahead for victory. Patton was likely insane, but also a genius tactician. His guile led to many notable victories in combat that changed the tides of battle during his war. Scott gives the performance of a lifetime displaying Patton's growing madness along side his brazen persona that alludes to the impending violence Patton would order.

Patton is beautifully shot, wildly scored, and brilliantly acted. You get it all with Patton. George C. Scott barks out orders, negotiates over the telephone, scans over his men like a meticulously, cruel, sentry. His gaze meant you were about to be scolded or ordered and his men would listen. In short, Patton is a character study into the mind of genius and madness during his war service. It is worth watching for the opening monologue from Scott's Patton alone.",1522454400,,1416,4.895833333333333

The movie has as much substance as peanut butter on white bread. A better read is ""Killing Patton"" by Bill O'Reilly & Martin Dugard. You will learn 10 times more than the movie ever begins to tell.

1642380,5,B00005PJ8O,"Not much of a classic movie fan, but thanks to the American Movie Classics channel I was hooked in watching old-fashioned Technicolor, clean screenwriting and phenomenal acting. Though 'clean' might be an understatement in regards to the subject matter.

Patton. A movie based on the real-life WWII US General who advanced in the war in Europe at the head of two Armies in Northern Africa, Sicily, France, Belgium and Germany. His epic adventure was rife with action and controversy. Armed Forces as a rule are not democracies and must be run as dictatorships. Tough but fair, Patton turned the men in his command who had a year previously had been hardcore isolationists into the greatest fighting force in the world. He had his missteps however, an incredibly pragmatic Army command that catered to political matters. Bickering among men with less proficiency, arrogant generals, and of course that infamous slapping incident.

Yet through it all Pattton, played brilliantly by George C. Scott, is a real American hero. A worthy story to be made on film and on Blu-Ray. Truly proud to have this on Blu-Ray.",1517529600,,1108,5.016304347826087

1642389,4,B00005PJ8O,"Quick Story recap:  WW2 and the focus is Patton and his battles both in war and personality battles.

Acting was well done as much as Patton does terrible things at times, George C Scott was playing Patton, did a great job making him relatable at all times.  I also enjoyed Karl Malden as Bradley as the smart capable and humble general as well.

It's a good war movie if you enjoy this genre.  Movies like this always make me want to research the topic and people.  It was the performance of George C Scott that drew me into the film.  He was bluster and ego and a few very brief moments of humility, which all worked to perfection.  It seemed like the movie tried a little too hard to forgive and glorify his slap of the shell shocked soldier as in the final minutes of the movie,  Bradley, speaking for the writer's perspective,  gives Patton a proverbial blow job and says the soldier he slapped probably did more than any other to win the war.  I think that line should have been struck all together as it shows the writer's hand too much especially since the whole movie already portrays Patton in a mostly positive light - sort of mad genius jerk but we love him anyway,  making Bradley's last few lines just too much gush on already gushed up cake.  I also wish the ending would have included his death in the car accident, I think the way the movie has him almost killed by the cart would have been a good foreshadow and true way to end the story.  Otherwise I enjoyed it and liked the performances I witnessed.",1514246400,,1520,4.362989323843417

1642402,5,B00005PJ8O,"RELEASED IN 1970 and directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, ""Patton"" stars George C. Scott as the charismatic general during his WWII campaigns in North Africa and Sicily, as well as France & Germany following the Normandy invasion. After the invasion of Sicily, Patton was reprimanded for slapping a cowardly soldier suffering battle fatigue (in real life it was two soldiers on separate occasions in the course of eight days in August, 1943). The fiery general was removed from command for eleven months while his junior in age and rank, Omar Bradley (Karl Malden), was selected to command the First United States Army for the invasion of Normandy.

Meanwhile, Patton was assigned to London as a decoy to deceive the Germans in a sham operation called Fortitude. The ruse was successful because the German High Command respected Patton more than any other Allied commander and deemed him crucial to any plan to invade mainland Europe. Immediately following the successful invasion, he was put in command of the Third Army in the final Allied thrust against Germany where the headstrong general, once again, proved his mettle as his forces favored speed and aggressive offensive action.

Patton was an interesting character who maintained a flashy larger-than-life image in order to encourage his troops; and he didn't hesitate to get his hands dirty with them. While other officers tried to blend-in with the troops on the battlefield, Patton brazenly displayed his rank insignia. He was a romantic who valued bravery and tenacity above all. All this is effectively conveyed in this ambitious war flick. Its interesting to observe the North African and European theaters of the war from the standpoint of the Allied generals, mostly Patton and Bradley, rather than the typical perspective of the infantry.

THE FILM WAS WRITTEN by Francis Ford Coppola with additional material from Edmund H. North (based on the factual accounts of Ladislas Farago & Omar N. Bradley). It runs 172 minutes and was shot in Spain, Algeria, Morocco, Crete and England, with the opening speech filmed at Bob Hope Patriotic Hall in Los Angeles.

1642410,5,B00005PJ8O,"1970 had not only this huge WW II movie, it had another one, Tora! Tora! Tora! that same year. I love them both! This is what I do when watching WW II movies. I put in ""Tora!"" first, then put in ""Patton"", then I put in another one from '77 after that, ""MacArthur"" (Gregory Peck). It is like watching a trilogy and it is pretty much in that order. You should try that sometime, when you want a WW II marathon, of course.
George C. Scott portrays legendary General Patton, a U.S. Army General that was a very proud and patriotic American War Hero.
He was certainly instrumental in helping destroy the Nazi's regime anywhere he went and commanded thousands of American G.I.'s in the field of Battle. There are few commanding officers that I hold high esteem for, and he is one of them.

The 2012 Blu-ray Edition is really good and I mean really good. Great sound and picture quality over previous editions.
I took a few photos of my Steelbook 2014 Edition. It is really nice with great photos and overall look. The discs inside are 2012 edition.
There are some great Special Features on the DVD, however, I really wish the companies would get away from putting these special features on a standard DVD.

1642412,5,B00005PJ8O,"The film is 5 stars. I hate leaving a 1 star review but due the time elapsed it's my only recourse to complain against the 3rd party seller ""Media Discounts"". I purchased this product in 2015. The product pictured and listed as having been sold to me is the remastered 2012 edition which features a vast improvement in clarity and detail vs the 2008 edition's older transfer. (Please search for details on major blu ray review sites)

This is a movie I only watch every few years and on finally getting it out to play it I realized that the seller falsely listed their older product under the newer serial. Granted, I could have caught this when I originally ordered it, but it slipped past me and now I'm stuck with a product I did not order and can't return or otherwise file a complaint due to time.

I'm sorry to have to take this route. The film is excellent and the latest blu ray release is supposed to be spectacular transfer. I'll be re-ordering this directly from amazon in the near future. I've learned my lesson with unscrupulous 3rd party sellers trying to dump old, outdated stock.

EDIT: I've modified my review to 5 stars because it's not fair to the film.  I'm simply upset that 3rd party sellers can get away with mismatching items and the only recourse is to be hyper vigilant.  I feel taken advantage of for trusting the system.  Anyhow, buy the film.

From the initial speech to the ""I had a dream last Night"" recounting of the Napoleon campaign, this film holds your attention. Patton is larger than life, and George C. Scott is larger than life in this larger than life movie.

We follow Patton through his WWII carrier. The focus is on Patton more than the war. We can feel with him as he remembers his past lives and we feel as though we were there with him. This is emphasized by revisiting Zama where Roman Scipio Africanus defeated Hannibal. If you ever get a chance you need to look it up.

These are four great movies that I've enjoyed many years and I wanted the BluRay editions to see the best images I could on my new 4K television.  I've watched 3 out of the 4 so far.

I have several major complaints.

First, the BluRay disks are setup so I have to watch trailers for other movies that I don't want or even like.  I did not buy the BluRays to watch crummy trailers for bad movies!  This happens every time you watch the movies for as long as the BluRay remains in your collection.

Second, the menus are locked so you can't select what you want.

Third, the BluRays are setup such that there is no way to resume watching where you had to stop or power down the player for any reason what so ever.

Fourth, having to fight with the BluRays to avoid the trailers or to resume watching where I left off impairs the enjoyment of great movies.

I really wish that producers would think about their customers than their advertising office.  Because of having to watch the crummy trailers and not being able to resume the movie where I stopped, I would not buy this set again nor would I have bought it in the first place if I knew these problems existed.

Update:  I finally watched the fourth movie, Sand Pebbles.  That disk didn't have the problems that the other three have.

1642442,5,B00005PJ8O,"Most of the reviews here seem to be centered around the story of the movie itself and the history of ""the man"".  But for those of us of a certain age, we are already quite familiar with the story and the history.  My review centers around the Blu-Ray quality - which is by far the best ""old movie made new"" through Blu-Ray transfer technology that I've ever seen.  Not an expert in that area, but the movie playback quality is fantastic. The sharpness and clarity are without equal.  I've seen the original DVD a hundred times, and this one is like watching it again for the first time.  There is even a perceptible ""depth of field"" in the playback that makes it seem as though you are there in the room.  Sound track has been preserved - a great buy.  Looks awesome on my 4K.  Finally, make sure it's the 2012 version.  The earlier 2008(?) version does not compare.",1497484800,,866,4.39622641509434

CLOSEUPS OF PATTON: The viewer is able to see the hair stubbles on the actor's face. There is a raised pimple on his right cheek with two short hairs surrounding it.
.
IVORY HANDLES OF PATTON'S GUN: The white is scratched and scuffed with dirt.
.
JEEP: The olive paint is worn and sun bleached. There are scratches and burn spots. Little dents are scattered on the vehicle's body.
.
On the other end, THE LONGEST DAY is disappointing. In general, there is little difference between the Blu-ray and the DVD versions. Both look the same.

It really is more about Patton, his nuances, things he said, but almost these tidbits are just excerpts from history, they are joined in any linear fashion to tell the story of the war.

America is portrayed as getting her butt kicked in just about every battle scene involving Patton.  I tend to think Patton was a great man, but the movie portrays him as ineffective, unprepared and bombastic.",1466985600,,600,4.427272727272728

1642621,5,B00005PJ8O,"A winner without a doubt.  Patton was as tough as hell and this picture portrayed him with sympathy and understanding.  We owe him a great deal for how well he served our country. How well I remember the Second World War (I was a child [now 81], but my memory is intact and those days of the war [at home] are unforgettable.  I had close family members who served our country and came back shell-shocked, bewildered, wounded, and forever damaged because of their war experiences; one of them permanently contracted malaria because he was separated from his unit and spent over two weeks of terror in dense jungle eluding the enemy, without food or water; he was was miraculously rescued, but forever changed from the man I first knew him to be.  Another family member was a radio operator right in the thick of fierce and unrelenting jungle fighting for over three years, facing fearful odds against survival every minute he served.  He survived as well.  We are still, and were back then, proud of our military.  As a former U.S. Navy WAVE I was proud to serve my country.  We were a more united country back then, but despite all our current problems and hurdles we have to conquer and overcome, I still believe we are a united nation because we respect the ideals and principles upon which this nation was formed.  We had military leaders like Patton and countless other brave military forces back then, as well as in other wars and conflicts, and we owe them all tremendous thanks for preserving our country despite the odds.  To all who served and have given their lives for our country, I say God Bless all of you for your service and sacrifices.  ""Patton"" is a classic film every American should see. The film actors are above reproach and their performances are touching and thrilling.  Thanks, too, to the people who made this picture.  They honored our military forces and forever preserved our country's history in an honorable and fitting manner.",1465344000,,1958,4.706744868035191
1642622,5,B00005PJ8O,"Rewatched on D-Day.  I still say George C. Scott did the most amazing job of making us all think he actually
was Patton.  That scene staring into the mirror and saying ""all my life..."", made me feel one with the man.  I read Killing Patton by Bill O'Reilly which really adds to the entire history and myth of Patton.  Years ago I read a few Patton biography's and now I'm back at it.

Scott in many movies, and this may be my favorite, although I thought he was really great in ""Doctor Strangelove"".

Karl Malden, another personal favorite actor, also appears as Omar Bradley.  Karl Malden's real family name is Sekulovich.  If one watches Karl Malden in movies, one will hear him refer to others using that name.  He does so in this movie during the story of the fighting on Sicily.

Francis Ford Coppola, an iconic director, wrote the screenplay for this movie and also earned an Academy Award, two years before directing ""The Godfather"".

Knowing something of the larger-than-life personality of Patton, it impressed me how well this movie, and George C Scott, presented a part of his life. They  - personalities- don't come around very often like this, and historical movies like this, typically don't portray them all that well. This didn't miss.

1642790,5,B00005PJ8O,"As long as I can remember, I have been told stories about ""old Blood & Guts"" from male family members who ""rolled with Patton"" during his campaigns in Africa and Europe.  My Uncles described him as a cross between Julius Caesar (which he would have loved) and Captain America.  This movie does little to debunk such myths.
First, let me say I really loved this movie, and George C. Scott does a great job portraying the flamboyant show boating egomaniac that was George Smith Patton, Jr.
I've heard that this movie actually made Patton into a folk hero, and it's affectionate depiction of the General makes me believe it.  Even the infamous ""slapping incident"" is done with respect toward the General.
Patton was in fact a brilliant field commander, and was one of the few Generals the Nazis knew by name.  They were afraid of him, rightfully so, because when it came to pursuit and destruction of his enemies, he was relentless and tenacious.  He got the job done and was an invaluable asset in helping bring World War II in the European theater to a close.
In spite of all of his military gifts, he was a loudmouth boor and a snob who spent a great deal of time extracting his custom made boot from his mouth.  In short, he was his own worst enemy.
The film doesn't go into great detail about his faults, but with a 3 hour running time, details can be highlighted, but not fully examined.  Besides, this movie is meant to praise Patton, not bury him!
It's a fabulous movie, action packed, the cinematography is fabulous and the cast is excellent.  I especially loved Patton's dog, Willie.

1642796,5,B00005PJ8O,"I watched this movie back in 2009 and I find it to be a great war movie just like other WW2 movies I've watched (Pearl Harbor, Enemy at the Gates, Saving Private Ryan). There's no doubt that General George Patton played a significant role in helping the Allies contain Hitler's expansionist plans for the world by driving the Nazis out of North Africa, but this movie also shows how much the Nazis feared General Patton, since they compared a potential US invasion of Italy to the Athenians' invasion of Italy in ancient times, as well as the dangers braved by US and British troops in North Africa, including sandstorms, scorpions and poisonous reptiles, et cetera.

If anyone loves WW2, ""Patton"" is a true war classic for people fascinated with military campaigns in North Africa in WW2, since Patton surely ranks among the most famous Allied generals of WW2 (alongside MacArthur, Montgomery, Marshall, Eisenhower).",1451001600,,917,4.993464052287582

1642869,5,B00005PJ8O,"Even knowing a great deal about the protagonist and the events of his life, I found this movie acceptably accurate with excellent performances, impressive scenery, and lots of action and drama. As egomaniacal as George Smith Patton, Jr. was, George C. Scott gives a most convincing performance in all of his character and contradictions. Quite believable. Just as wealth differentiates a person who is crazy from one who is viewed as merely eccentric, so Patton's wealth and privileged upbringing created a legacy as an egomaniac rather than a megalomaniac, which was only enhanced by the success of the armies he commanded.

In any career other than the military, and any time other than the Mexican War and the two World Wars, Patton might have been an obscure individual. Just as the American Civil War gave rise to an undistinguished shoe salesman in Missouri and brought him to the command of the Union armies and eventually the Presidency, so Patton's martial abilities propelled him to a position where his skills were desperately required. Even if somewhat idealized, this epic film gives a highly entertaining depiction of the man and the events. The story of Patton has morphed from being a real life story through the assessment of history, the accounts of legend, and is now shrouded in mythology. Whether one considers Patton a hero or a failed human being, one cannot discount his good fortune, his personal courage, or his genius for war.",1448236800,,1453,5.0041322314049586

1642871,5,B00005PJ8O,"The U.S. Army's Infantry Magazine said of this movie, ""it is about as accurate as a Hollywood movie can be."" The filmmakers had to greatly tone down Patton's language; George Patton invented most of the obscenities you and I enjoy today, and in 1970 a movie that accurately reflected Patton's manner of speaking would have never made it past the censors. They also changed a few things about his tenure in the European Theater of Operations and left some out, but in all the movie was a good presentation of this very flawed genius.

This isn't a review of the cinematic masterpiece engraved on these two discs. It's Patton. It's been out forever. You've probably seen it. If you like war films you'll love Patton; if you hate war films you'll despise Patton. Rather, this is a review of the way it's been engraved.

Unlike most movies, Patton wasn't shot on 35mm film, but on 65mm which, for projection, is printed either to 70mm film at its film-gate size or to 35mm through a reducing lens on the printer. This gives you a bigger negative that doesn't need as much enlarging to get you to the same place. The result is a sharper, more detailed picture. The Patton Blu-ray transfer was made from these massive negatives, and it shows: no artifacts, no fuzziness, just a big, bright, beautiful view on your wide-screen TV. The sound is also excellent; if you have big speakers or a surround-sound system with a lot of satellites this is a film that will do your stereo justice.

I was too young to have seen the original 70mm cinema release of Patton. This Blu-ray is as close as you'll get.",1447891200,,1592,4.598591549295775

1642906,4,B00005PJ8O,"I only give this movie four stars because it contains some minor inaccuracies.  On the positive side, George C. Scott's portrayal of the controversial general is nothing less than magnificent.  True, Patton had a much higher voice than Scott, but Scott probably would have ruined his performance had he tried to fake it.  The movie does not focus on his whole life, but only his career during World War II.  It begins with his taking over command of the II Corps in North Africa, and ends with his relief from command of the Third Army after the war.  In between, he commanded the Seventh Army in Sicily.  During this campaign, he had a fit of temper in which he slapped a soldier, and as a result very nearly ended his career.

As far as historical accuracy goes, it does better than most Hollywood movies.  Most of the events depicted in the movie actually happened, but not in the order as shown.  For instance, Patton really did order his chaplain to compose a prayer for good weather, but it didn't happen during the Battle of the Bulge (in real life it happened at Lorraine about a month earlier, and the problem was continuous heavy rain, not snow).  The movie only depicts one incident of Patton slapping a soldier; in real life there were two, and they happened exactly one week apart.  The language gets pretty raw at times, and therein lies another inaccuracy (the real Patton's language was MUCH worse).

My biggest quarrel with the movie is the way it depicts Patton's relationship with Gen. Omar Bradley.  The movie gives the impression that the two men were the best of friends, when in fact they never particularly liked each other.  Patton's best friend was probably Eisenhower, and he never even appears in the movie.  The movie also gives the impression that Patton was relieved of command of the Third Army because of his hatred for the Russians.  That was part of it, but Patton's anti-Semitism and his indiscretions regarding the ""denazification"" program were also factors.  To put it simply, Patton didn't know when to keep his mouth shut, and Eisenhower got tired of covering for him.

That aside, the movie is well-worth seeing.  I can't comment on the quality of these particular videos, but I do recommend that you get a wide-screen version if you can.  The ""cropped"" versions don't capture the full cinematic effect.",1445904000,,2344,4.7549504950495045

I highly recommend everyone read this book and you will learn unbelievable things about what goes on behind the scenes in war and politics!

1643016,5,B00005PJ8O,"There was never a part more brilliantly played by an actor than George C Scott in Patton.  He owned this role in every way possible.  Coming out at the height of the counter culture movement of America in the late 1960's, it really says something that the film Patton received universal praise by everyone.  The historical accuracy and location footage was excellent.  The uplifting theme music was simple and wonderful all at the same time.  Patton was not loved by his men but he did believe in his soldiers abilities and what they could do.  The film today remains one of the best movies about WW2 out there.  It is very patriotic and believable at the same time. Karl Malden also did a fantastic job of playing general Omar Bradley.

There did seem to be a real lack of Sherman Tanks available for the filming of the movie.  It is kind of ironic they had a lot of vintage Tiger Tanks available for making the movie but very few Sherman tanks when the US pumped out 10 times the numbers during the war years.  That small tidbit aside the film is excellent and easily deserves 5 stars.  Not every element is going to match what happened in real life down to the last  detail but the acting and screenwriting are excellent.",1440547200,,1224,4.48868778280543

1643133,2,B00005PJ8O,"A very high quality rendering of a repellent idea. The idea, Patton's idea, is that the glory of war is the ultimate male pursuit. A familiar idea, found in most cultures and part of our biological makeup. The movie shows us all of Patton's eccentricities and extreme views, but works hard to enlist our sympathies for him. I didn't buy it. Men like Patton are a curse. Patton's invocation of Caesar is particularly revealing. Rome was a democracy until Caesar. He became Rome's first dictator, and his wars of conquest had the same impact on the average citizen that glory-seeking empire-building lunatics have always had. The spirit of George Patton is alive and well in modern America. It survives in the minds of people like Dick Cheney and John McCain and Lindsay Graham. If there's a fight, these men want to be in it. And if there's not a fight, they want to start one. For these fellows, that's what men do. Fight. There is a film that addresses this idea point-blank. It's The Duelists. Pass on Patton, and see it.",1436140800,,1023,4.657458563535911

But all in all, it was an outstanding movie with Karl Malden as General Bradley, etc. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves this country and wishes that we could have another General such as Old Blood and Guts! Those days of tanks and aircraft waging warfare are now gone forever, and someone like Patton would be very frustrated with the decisions being made to defend this country today!",1435968000,,659,4.7894736842105265

The opening scene was unlike any I had seen before (or have seen since).  Scott's nuanced delivery seemed perfect and stands up to the test of time. How many opening scenes can you remember 45 years later?  The haunting trumpet that echoes throughout the movie score is just amazing and sets the tone for Patton's belief that he had lived previous lives as earlier warriors.  The movie was shot on location and the cinematography is fantastic.  You can argue about the accuracy and interpretation of some of the history presented, but you can't argue about the acting, cinematography, or music.

1643247,5,B00005PJ8O,"The story of Patton, I have no idea how romanticized this is of him, is an amazing story.  Patton from everything I have heard was a hard driving man who got in his own way a lot.  I think one thing I love about  the movie is it compliments Battle of the Bulge really well... The two kind of show what it took for the allies to advance through German occupied Europe.  I think what I loved most about the movie this time around is it tied something together for me in a video game I played... by this I mean what Patton's role was during the Normandy invasion and why things unfolded that way.

 I think George C. Scott gives a command performance and although I would not ever want to be Patton ... I think people can learn from him some of qualities ... what lead to his triumphs ... why did he get in his own way?  Is there anyway he could have been himself without the two aspects.  My major question and I might have to research it .. is why didn't Patton command troops in the Pacific Theater?

Patton is a titan of history to me like Alexander the Great, Hannibal of Cathage fame and Genghis Khan men at the head of armies who together helped to re-shape the world for ill in some ways and good for other.  One thing I love about this movie is it did not attempt to paint Patton as perfect, which makes it all the more engaging.  I don't expect everyone to find this to be 5 stars and this movie is not about fight scenes... it shows more of his work behind the front lines.",1434499200,,1481,4.125435540069686

Everything from the acting to the costuming in the movie is great and they even get in most of Patton's personality traits from a belief in reincarnation, to his sometimes harsh, but brilliant style of command. They take the time to work in many of his trademark lines too. If you like World War II movies, or simply want to see a good movie about one of the most influential commanders in history, this is a good choice.

1643359,5,B00005PJ8O,"GEORGE PATTON and GEORGE WASHINGTON ... are the two in American history that as military commanders and soldiers, separate themselves from all the rest !!!

As you will see in this film, though Eisenhower was the Supreme Allied commander in Europe during World War II and eventually became President of the United States, he was more of a ""political military man"" than was Patton!  Patton was the real thing ... a ""real"" troop commander !!!

AND IN LIGHT OF TODAY'S CURRENT EVENTS in 2014-2015 ... ALSO OF SPECIAL NOTE toward the last of this film ... are Patton's comments about Russia and his insights toward it.  And his comment about peace: the time to prepare for the next war, which surely will come !!!

So, you won't forget this one soon, and it is worth several viewings ... in addition to another Amazon Instant Video on Patton: ""The Last Days Of Patton"" ... also starring George C. Scott.
==========================

AND RELEVANT to this last one -- ""The Last Days Of Patton"" ... also search under ""Books"" on Amazon and note the two most recent publications pertaining to the essential last days of Patton ... released two days apart on September 23 and 25, 2014 by respectively Bill O'Reilly, and Mrs. Patton !!!

The first, O'Reilly's, is entitled:  ""Killing Patton: The Strange Death of World War II's Most Audacious General.""  And the second, Mrs. Patton's, is entitled:  ""Killing Patton: The ""Not So"" Strange Death of World War II's Most Audacious General: Authored by Patton's Wife and Soldiers.""
==========================

But back to the first movie, the subject of this review:

""Patton"" -- this ""STILL SO MODERN"" Francis Ford Coppola & George C. Scott 1970 film -- in 1971 at the Academy Awards won 7 Oscars. Additionally elsewhere, there were another 18 wins & 7 nominations.

According to IMDB, the Academy Award winners included:
-- Best Picture
-- Best Actor in a Leading Role -- George C. Scott
-- Best Director
-- Best Writing, Story and Screenplay (Based on Factual Material or Material Not Previously Published or Produced) -- Francis Ford Coppola & Edmund H. North
-- Best Art Direction-Set Decoration
-- Best Sound
-- Best Film Editing

It was also nominated for Best Cinematography.

What more needs to be said?  Except otherwise maybe study up on George Washington and his comment about the battlefield ""thrill of the sound of whizzing bullets"" ... and of special interest, the number of times he resigned his commission as an officer ... and quit the military!

I hope all of this helps shed light on this film, for your interest in it, and knowledge to be gained from it.

Scott is magnificent as Patton and the movie isn't afraid of putting the darker side of his personality front and center.  I still enjoy the battle scenes, even if a touch dated in the post-Saving Private Ryan world, because you can see the effort put in to the production.  If you have good speakers the battle scenes are that much more compelling.  There's just something abut real explosions that CGI just hasn't caught up to IMO.  The portrayal of Bradley still bothers me, he's about the perfect General but this isn't surprising as General Bradley was an adviser to the film.

1643463,5,B00005PJ8O,"I wrote an Extensive review several weeks ago, more like more like an op ed piece. Maybe to long so it didn't make it in. .I was in the hospital when I read it very ill and I read it in 2-3 days when i ever i had the strength & chance. I could not put the book down and I am a World War 2 History Buff, I learned something new on every page it was very enlightening & totally fascinating. If you are a student of History which Patton was you must read this book and you can comprehend what is going on in the world today a lot better. I came away with the opinion that he definitely was murdered because he knew way too much and Eisenhower in Truman had it out for him.
All you need to do is look at what they did to Churchill and England ( Our Allie )  Churchill returned from Yalta only to find out he had been replaced after that man almost single handedly saved that country. Truman sold him out to the Russians who Patton new were the real enemy at the Gate and wanted to fight them and he was right. Truman was either incredibly naive or clueless.  Sound familIar
? Stalin was one of the most sadistic man in History and we welcomed him like a Comrade in arms. He slaughtered millions of innocent people after the war. Patton was very well aware what was going on and saved countless lives by allowing them to escape against the protests of everyone especially the russians which ultimately cost him his command. .. when they took away his beloved 5th Army and relieved him of his command he Knew he was done . When he decided to maybe pursue Politics his fate was sealed. As our nation's number one Field Commander He should have been given a command in the Pacific but was  denied. It was given to the General who high tailed it out of Bastogne  who Patton and Only Patton could & would save the besieged little  town & turned the tide of the war once & for all. funny how he & Rommel Just great leaders of men basically  suffered the same fate after risking all for their countries.

1643534,5,B00005PJ8O,"One of my all-time favorite war classics.  In my opinion, it was actor George C. Scott's finest role.  His portrayal of the legendary American WWII general almost convinced America that he was General George S. Patton, Jr. reincarnated.  Although, for today's younger generation, accustomed to the special effects largely produced by CGI technology, the movie will be somewhat dated, and for modern military history aficionados, there may be a few - some quite noticeable - equipment-weapons errors.  For example, some of the tanks used to portray both German and American tanks during the El Guettar battle scene (Tunisia Campaign 1943) were mid to late 1950's American models.  They were not modified enough to resemble the type of WWII tanks in use during the time period setting - circa 1943-45. Historical inaccuracies aside for tank props, this movie is an epic that  captures the essence of the time period and some of the most significant and defining moments of General's Patton WWII career with a script well performed and supported by noted actors of the time.  The movie also features well orchestrated re-enacted battle scenes, which should be especially appreciated by younger audiences, taking into account that both stunts and explosions are real and lack the ""faked"" CGI special effects which are largely used with many of today's modern war films.  It should be no wonder that it garnered 7 academy awards, including Best Picture.",1427673600,,1448,5.1581196581196584

1643551,5,B00005PJ8O,"Not really much to add about this picture...

It's one of the legends of American cinema, and George C. Scott's brilliant performance as one of the nation's most flamboyant and colorful generals and characters earned him a well-deserved Oscar, as did Karl Malden's work as General Omar Bradley, Patton's subordinate and later superior officer.

It's a war movie with only four battle scenes, interestingly enough, and tightly focuses on the last year and a half of Patton's life. It captures the general's character pretty perfectly, except that the real Patton had a high-pitched, squeaky voice. Now everyone thinks he sounds like George C. Scott. But aside from that, all of Patton's strengths and weaknesses as a human being are depicted very clearly and accurately. The iconic opening segment, for example, is a compilation of a standard speech that Patton gave many times to his troops, on many occasions. His belief in reincarnation, his devout religious faith and paradoxical foul mouth, hatred of the Russians, are all well-depicted, as is the famous slapping incident. (There were actually two, but the movie makes it one for dramatic purposes)

Less well-depicted are his anti-Semitism, his extra-marital affair with his niece, and his paranoia, which was the real cause of his bad relationship with Montgomery, and ended his friendships with Bradley and Eisenhower.

The depiction of the British in general and Monty in particular are inaccurate and have drawn a great deal of anger in Britain -- the famous scene where Montgomery rolls into Messina like a strutting peacock only to find Patton awaiting him is absolute fiction. The ""race to Messina"" only existed in Patton's mind by that point, as Monty was pulling back his troops to prepare for the invasion of the southern tip of Italy. Patton was racing Brig. John Currie's 4th Armoured Brigade and several Commando battalions, acting pretty much on their own.

In truth, US Gen. Lucian Truscott's 3rd Infantry entered Messina, and while Truscott (not Patton) was negotiating the take-over of the city from Italian officials, Currie's scout cars came up, and Currie himself realized he'd been beaten. He simply said to Truscott, ""Jolly good race."" Truscott was equally casual. No bands, no parades, no face-off between army generals.

More importantly was the fact that neither Patton nor Montgomery nor the Allied navies and air forces were able to prevent the Germans from achieving a massive evacuation of their forces from Sicily, with all their equipment, in ""Operation Lehrgang,"" which enabled the Germans to salvage valuable troops from the island for the next round of campaigning in Italy -- also not mentioned in the movie.

In fact, Montgomery held Patton in high regard, which was not reciprocated. Monty would not allow the British 8th Army newspaper ""Crusader"" to print stories about Patton's slapping incidents. Patton's problems with his men, Monty said, were a ""family matter."" The movie depicts Montgomery as highly jealous of Patton, which is inaccurate.

However, I don't want to re-visit or add to the endless ""Who's cooler?"" debate over World War II generals, which I think is over-done. I have often said that the real question is not ""which general is overrated"" but ""which general is underrated."" We should know more about Richard O'Connor, Konstantin Rokossovsky, Brehon Somervell, Sandy Patch, Keith Park, Lucian Truscott, Kenneth Strong, Lesley McNair, Guy Simonds, Richard McCreery, Bert Hoffmeister, Claude Auchinleck, Bill Slim, Pete Quesada, Lawton Collins, Miles Dempsey, John Harding, Andrew Cunningham, James Somerville, Donald Bennett, Leslie Morshead, and Lord Gort than we do now. They get short shrift from the armchair historians and general public, sadly. I'll leave the Monty-Patton debate at that, and that's all I have to say about that.

However, four decades later, Patton the movie still stands as a masterwork depiction of Patton the man.",1427414400,,3952,5.250396196513471

1643779,4,B00005PJ8O,"I was a fan for George C Scott back in the day, and this film was certainly one of his best.  It was hard for me to completely enjoy the film, however, because I am sensitive (perhaps overly sensitive) to stylistic issues that date a film.  Historically based films of this era tended to shallowly define their characters.  In this film, to its credit, some effort was made to depict Patton, although a great general, as also a man of great flaws.  On the other hand, Montgomery was depicted as a pompous ass without relief.  Nevertheless, I would recommend this film to anyone interested in dramas about WW II/",1425168000,,611,4.568807339449541

There was some choppy progress in telling the story though and often times was necessary to go back and forth to follow the progression.  It might feel like the author is leaving out parts of the story he's telling if you don't remember he's making a point as to the possibility that the general was the target for assassination.  This pattern increases towards the end of the book.  In places the detail is in depth while in other places it seems to jump over important events with little detail.  I did, however enjoy the read.  I've always been fascinated by the man.  General Patton was a true American hero albeit a bit of an egotist.",1424649600,,811,4.615384615384615

1643889,5,B00005PJ8O,"1970's TORA! TORA! TORA! should have done much better at the box-office on its release. If remembered at all it is noted for its realistic special visual effects of the Pearl Harbor attack. Long forgotten are the performances of the principal actors and the well-constructed screenplay and editing. This is truly a shame because it is one of the most historically accurate film depictions of any World War II event. Accuracy can always be debated considering film length, budget and scripting. On a relative basis to the hundreds of war films produced this is one of the more accurate. The film is really an in-depth analysis of events leading up to and culminating in the unprovoked actual Japanese attack. These events are shown from both sides with Richard Fleischer directing the American sequences and Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasaku directing the Japanese. What is amazing is just how well these events create true suspense and tension throughout. This is achieved through skillful editing from James E. Newcom, Pembroke J. Herring and Inoue Chikaya from the well-written and researched screenplay by Larry Forrester, Hideo Oguni and Ryuzo Kikushima. The Special Effects are undeniably the best ever produced for a War film made during the 20th century. They combine both close-ups and panoramic views, which give the real scope of the devastation. On the acting front James Whitmore as Admiral Halsey impressed me the most. He seemed like the one high ranking American officer with a good head on his shoulders, decisive and no procrastinator. Also good were Neville Brand as Lt. Kaminsky (up to his neck in bureaucratic procrastination) and George Macready as Cordell Hull. Macready showed restrained outrage and disgust at the document handed him by Japanese Ambassador Nomura (Shogo Shimada). I thought that all the actors portraying Japanese Naval officers were excellent. Once again composer Jerry Goldsmith demonstrates his brilliance as a composer as he calls upon both American and Oriental motifs to tell this drama from both perspectives. Goldsmith brilliantly captures the underlying mood of the Japanese Naval leaders on one side and the perplexed and frustrated United States Naval and Army Intelligence officers on the other. This film brilliantly depicts the greatest act of modern era cowardice perpetuated from one nation upon another in peacetime. For a country that prided itself on the concept of `honor' this film demonstrates just how dishonorable and cowardly a nation can become under the imperial ambitions of its leaders. As the film reiterates at its conclusion, one man from that country realized that they had awakened a sleeping dragon. This is truly great filmmaking. It also starred Martin Balsam, Jason Robards, Joseph Cotton, Tatsuya Mihashi, Soh Yamamura, E.G. Marshall, Takahiro Tamura, Eijiro Tono, Leon Ames, Richard Anderson, Edward Andrews and G.D. Spradlin.

Darryl F. Zanuck's THE LONGEST DAY may well be the definitive film of D-Day June 6, 1944. THE LONGEST DAY is probably one of the most ambitious WWII films ever produced. It's all encompassing scope of the invasion and the combatants and both the individual and collective personal stories of some of the combatants is extraordinary and contributes to the overall depiction and sense of calamity and coordination of the Allies on D-Day June 6, 1944. THE LONGEST DAY is based on the book The Longest Day by Cornelius Ryan and in the book the focus is on the people, the combatants as well as civilians. The integration of both the military aspects and the people that were part of and affected is what producer Darryl F. Zanuck was striving for and he achieved this brilliantly bringing the humanity to the forefront. The cast is a strong one and they all seem to give performances of a high order and they all seem rather inspired by the scope of this film. The cast includes John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, Richard Beymer, Stuart Whitman, Sean Connery, Richard Todd, Robert Wagner, Tom Tryon, Eddie Albert, Kenneth More, Gert Frbe, George Segal, Robert Ryan, Wolfgang Preiss, Peter Lawford, Sal Mineo, Curd Jrgens, Edmond O'Brien, Rod Steiger, Irina Demick, Alexander Knox, Jeffrey Hunter, Donald Houston, Steve Forrest, Fabian, Paul Anka, Ray Danton, Red Buttons, Hans Christian Blech, Mel Ferrer, Leo Genn, Fernand Ledoux, Christian Marquand, Norman Rossington, Tommy Sands and Peter van Eyck and many more. There were several directors. Ken Annakin shot most of the British and French exterior episodes, Bernhard Wicki directed the German episodes and Andrew Marton the American exterior shooting. Jean Bourgoin and Walter Wottitz won Academy Awards for Best Cinematography. Robert MacDonald and Jacques Maumont won Academy Awards for Best Special Effects. The popular theme song was composed by Paul Anka the score was composed by Maurice Jarre.

George C. Scott is PATTON. What more can be said? A lot more I suppose. I saw PATTON when it was first released. I was a senior in high school. PATTON seemed liked the culmination of so many epic WWII films. PATTON seemed like the last of that breed. The film is first rate in every department. PATTON is good filmmaking and story telling at its best. But what really drives this film is George C. Scott's inspired and driven performance. There is a certain magic element behind this film. It is absolutely absorbing and has stood the test of time. PATTON is a one of a kind film and I wonder if we will ever see the likes of it again. PATTON went on to win 7 Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor (George C. Scott), Writing (Story and Screenplay--based on factual material or material not previously published or produced), Sound, Art Direction, Film Editing and Directing (Franklin J. Schaffner).

THE SAND PEBBLES is a very effective historically based narrative focusing on China during the 1926 revolution as seen through and affecting the U.S.S. San Pablo assigned to patrol the Yangtze River. This richly textured Robert Wise film is full of many interesting performances especially from Richard Crenna, Mako, Richard Attenborough and Simon Oakland, and especially Steve McQueen. Richard Crenna's character as the Captain of the San Pablo is truly enigmatic and somehow parallels that of Steve McQueen's seaman Jake Holman who is not restrained from doing the right thing when diplomacy dictates otherwise. Steve McQueen is ordered to the San Pablo for his transgressions and comes to terms with his own cynicism and outward lack of humanity, which has been beaten into his misunderstood past. His relationship with the Mako, whom he trains to maintain the ship's engine makes McQueen see the humanity in himself and those of a different race and culture and realizes the basic good in himself. Mako's tragic death seen is very moving and unforgettable if you have ever seen this film and McQueen's agony touches you like no other film I have ever seen. This film contains one of Jerry Goldsmith's best scores full of brooding bravado and sentiment. This is also one of the best films Robert Wise directed and he truly directed some great ones. THE SAND PEBBLES is a very soul searching and unforgettable film. The camaraderie that Steve McQueen as Jake Holman builds with Mako as Po-han is heart breaking and is a high point of the impressive film.",1424563200,,7346,5.099667774086379

1643916,4,B00005PJ8O,"Patton is one of the best biographical movies that has been around for some time and reviewed by more competent movie critics than I. The less than perfect rating is for the transmission quality. It was good for the first two hours or so when the movie suddenly froze and didn't restart. Waited five minutes or so then backtracked to see if that would help. It did but only in part; the picture came back but the sound didn't. Playing around with the progress indicator eventually got me to a point where I regained both sound and picture and from that point on everything went fine until the end of the movie.

I'm not qualified to say whether this problem was due to my ISP, Time-Warner, or to the server streaming the video. Your experience may be different. If you are a fan of our military history then this, the story of one of our greatest generals at the top of his career, will certainly will be worth your time.

1643957,5,B00005PJ8O,"George C. Scott is PATTON. What more can be said? A lot more I suppose. I saw PATTON when it was first released. I was a senior in high school. PATTON seemed liked the culmination of so many epic WWII films. PATTON seemed like the last of that breed. The film is first rate in every department. PATTON is good filmmaking and story telling at its best. But what really drives this film is George C. Scott's inspired and driven performance. There is a certain magic element behind this film. It is absolutely absorbing and has stood the test of time. PATTON is a one of a kind film and I wonder if we will ever see the likes of it again.

PATTON went on to win 7 Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor (George C. Scott), Writing (Story and Screenplay--based on factual material or material not previously published or produced), Sound, Art Direction, Film Editing and Directing (Franklin J. Schaffner).",1424131200,,905,4.58641975308642

The purpose of the military is to kill people and break things. Any other mission is an insult to them and us. When you F with the US you should pay the ultimate price. Why did the Japs surrender? If you don't know, look it up. If you disagree with my review you will not like this movie and perhaps you should move to Europe.

1643981,5,B00005PJ8O,"One of the finest WWII movies ever made.

The movie has a lot to offer. George C. Scott's performance gives it that special edge as he portrays a war loving US general who is a fine combat commander, but is just not mindful of what his ego mania and control freak nature do to his image and his usefulness.

The movie portrays his personality in a pretty fair way, making him a borderline nut that believes he is the reincarnation of many past warriors but also a fine combat commander (at least when on the attack) that makes him useful as long as he is kept on a short leash. Unfortunately for the real Patton, the leash was never short enough and his own personality defects made him a liability.

The movie has a lot of good combat scenes, but really it is about the man and not the war.",1422230400,,791,4.26

Therefore, this film provides a good overview of Patton in the WW-II period and genre, but somehow I doubt he'd be saying the same things now and still keeping his stars.  Scott's performance was very good.

USA love Winnners. not losers, like Patton said in his initial speech in this valuable movie, and so, USA must be the Guardian of freedom in all the world. If others nations also join to USA, Welcome!

1644302,5,B00005PJ8O,"Patton was the Best Picture of 1970 and deservedly so. Great to see it now on Blu-Ray with commentary and bonus features.

Patton was born and grew up in Pasadena California in comfortable circumstances. He attended West Point graduating 46th in his class of 103 in 1909. Patton was an Olympian who competed in the pentathlon in the 1912 games in Stockholm. He fought and was wounded in World War I when he headed up America's first tank corps.

In World War II, he headed up the helped the US Army in North Africa to recover from the disaster at the Kasserine pass. He had overall command of all American ground forces in the invasion of Sicily. He was successfully used as a decoy heading up the imaginary FUSAG army before D-Day&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Double-Cross-The-True-Story-of-the-D-Day-Spies/dp/0307888770/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Double Cross: The True Story of the D-Day Spies</a>. As commander of the US 3rd Army after
D-Day he led an army that advanced farther and faster than any army in military history, crossing 24 major rivers and capturing 81,500 square miles of territory, including more than 12,000 cities and towns. In what was, perhaps, his finest hour, he relieved the German siege of Bastogne in the Battle of the Bulge on December 26, 1944.

There is the historic Patton and then there is Patton the movie. Francis Ford Coppola won an academy award for writing the screenplay of Patton. Well-read viewers will recognize that Coppola did an excellent job he did in terms of researching and quoting -- but shouldn't George S. Patton have gotten a posthumous screen credit or award too? Patton is one of the best war film's of all time--in spite of its over-reliance upon the memoirs of Omar Bradley who detested Patton.

Wow, so he had been a warrior throughout time - I believe it!

George C. Scott did the General proud with his intensity and command of nuanced words.

Except for the lack of real Nazi tanks in any of the tank battles, this was as true-to-life as you are going to find on the scale that was attempted. All other war films are much more personal in nature because of the stories involved and the historical characters. With Patton, the WWII is the scope and the main character is of a stature that allows the director and production a license that is rarely found in films, say of the score and nature of the Ten Commandments.

In any way, this is a must see film for all film and history buffs. It is all the more relevant with the current conspiracy theory regarding the untimely demise of the real Patton immediately following the end of the war in Europe.",1413244800,,878,4.368098159509202

1644535,5,B00005PJ8O,"This is an excellent film and as such, deserves the 5-star rating.  It's enjoyable and is a marvelous WW2 production.
Having said that, I have to diverge from the other reviewers.  All of them commented on the movie, good or bad, but ignore the subject.  This film was a great vignette about 'a Patton', not THE Patton in reality.
I am uniquely qualified to comment, as I am right now looking at a German clock with a rotating pendulum, 'liberated' by the general's adjutant and given, via Patton, to my father, who was attached on the medical staff.
The real Patton was miscast  with George C. Scott.  Patton was not a bombastic impressive speaker or physical presence.  That was the point; coping with his less than impressive voice and his southern accent, he had to overcompensate.  Thus he got into trouble by being 'inpolitic' with the Brits and his American counterparts.  He was truly the 'Ty Cobb' of the general staff.  Patton was totally out of place in almost all situations and his success just showed how remarkable and indefatigible his spirit was.  All he knew and cared for was the sabre, the real cavalry(mounted) and the newer cavalry(armored).  That was all he cared for, all he was good at, and all that we needed at the time.  So, in the end, the film's 'Patton' is not an accurate bio but a great film standing on its own.",1413158400,,1345,4.605042016806722

1644568,5,B00005PJ8O,"The list of popular, American Generals is not very long, because they are not well known by civillians. That Hollywood should single one of them out for a major film (in 1970, no less), is interesting by itself. And I must confess; this is an all-time favorite of mine since it first came-out when i was 14 yrs old. (1971), forty-three years ago. I should have gone into the service. At the time, Viet Nam was in full-tilt, and our pop-culture was poised for full free-fall. His story here is told in WWII 'chapters' and in the late-1960's style of Hollywood's episodic, biopic, hammer-the-gas and slam-on-the-brake narrative style. In some ways, the real George S. Patton is more interesting than actor Goerge C. Scott's growling, impulsive portrayal would have you believe.
  ~HowEVER~...Scott's creation is a perfectly valid dramatic performance in its' own right, and he does manage to convince us that this highly-educated (West Point, VMI graduate), this wealthy warrior is worthy of our respect and even our sympathy. He is the human incarnation of a fiercely loyal bull-terrier. Any child would love him. So should you, if you have a patriot's American
blood and a will to defend liberty. The Hollywood actor was far too humble to let-on that he identified with the General he portrayed. But you just know he had fun making this film. General Patton was a student of ancient history, a 'Poet Warrior'. If you are fascinated by American history and WWII in particular, you might wish that Spielberg and Hanks had been around when they
decided to film this one. (It was before their time...) One more thing- children can watch this one (if it doesn't bore them, they can
learn about this incredible fellow AND about their grandfather's America. -or at least, Hollywood's version in 1970. If you are like myself, you'll want the collector's copy of this with its' added features; (interview w/ Francis F.Coppola) who wrote the screenplay.
His interview by itself is an American cinema history class worth the price of a copy. While watching George Scott the actor, please
remember that History owes George Patton the general (among others) for our freedom today. Enjoy the story WELL-told.",1412467200,,2194,4.959239130434782
1644569,3,B00005PJ8O,"I had watched this movie years ago and now through older eyes. If you view the movie with an interest in studying leadership styles there are lessons to be learned. There are times in history where ""The end justifies the means,"" but those times are rare. I think a quote from the movie: ""Our blood his guts,"" pretty much sums up Patton's leadership style as portrayed in this movie. Not to discount the efforts and amazing feats of the 3rd Army, I believe it is important to keep in mind the distinct roles and balance between our military commanders and our civilian leaders. Historically both Patton and Mac Arthur forgot that important balance.",1412467200,,647,4.734513274336283

Based on interviews and actual history there is passion here that we need to see more of coming out of the far too politically correct and liberal Hollywood. This is a great nation filled with great people who unselfishly served this country from the unknown average dog soldiers to the famous and fiery generals. We need to be reminded this.

1644607,5,B00005PJ8O,"This is one awesome war picture! It deserved to win it's Oscar for ""Best Picture"" and George C. Scott deserved his Oscar for ""Best Actor"" as well. With a screenplay penned by Francis Ford Coppola and with inspired directing by Franklyn J. Schaffner this movie delivers on all fronts.

The original bluray release was a clean enough looking transfer, but all of the grain reduction overly applied to it had the side effect of erasing a lot of the fine detail from the film's on screen images. On the other hand, this newly remastered version is virtually flawless! Without over-doing it this time around, very little grain is left visible on the screen while the sharpness retained is truly excellent. The images are sharp as a tack and all of the fine details have been retained wonderfully. The color and contrast are equally good.

This is how the original version SHOULD have looked!

If you wish to have a copy of ""Patton"" among your library of bluray films, don't hesitate to purchase a copy of this version. It has never looked better on home video.",1411776000,,1055,4.691891891891892

1644609,1,B00005PJ8O,"Having read several books on Patton, his biography, and much history of World War II, I found this film to be very disappointing.

The film portrays a fine gentleman/General who had a great love of his country as a despotic idiot whose views of war are quite contrary to his actual personality and concerns regarding the why of war, why human beings, not just Americans, go to war.

This film gets a zero rating from me.

What a shame that younger generations get ssuch a biased portrayal of a great American who had an understanding of exactly who the enemy was in the nineteen forties, and the definition of the enemy, in his opinion, was not confined to Nazi Germany..

It gets an A+ for ""historical revisionism"".

Patton with all of his quirks and eccentricities, he was an amazing man. George C. Scott brings him to life vividly. The film only covers the years 1942-45 in the life of Patton, but it shows the depth of the man. The film is about 90% accurate; showing Patton not just as an eccentric general, but as a human being.
  It is one of the greatest WWII films of all time. It shows the Battle of Kasserine Pass, The Invasion of Italy, and The Battle of the Bulge accurately. The film also shows the politics behind the war, this is especially seen in Patton's speech which keeps getting him in trouble. The acting is wonderful - especially between Scott and Malden.

He knew who he was up against, for he had read the books written by the commanding officers of the Nazi opposing forces.

An over indulgent man, believing only his ideas were correct, it is interesting to see how he could manipulate the Army in some ways. PTSD Was not know, not did he recognize what was then called battle fatigue. Rather, if you could not ""hack"" it, you were branded a coward by him. Not willing to budge much except when given orders, would he follow a plan he might not believe in. I suggest watching this movie along with Ike, where Patton is almost sent home & reprimanded by Ike. A good movie, produced well, giving a look into one of our brilliant, yet pompous leaders of WW2.

1644809,5,B00005PJ8O,"I saw ""Patton"" when it was first released.  Loved it then, loved it now.  I've probably watched it a dozen times over the years.  The movie is an excellent portrayal and entertaining film about the character and exploits of a revered friend and a feared enemy, depending on which side of the conflict you were on.  To say that Patton, the man, struck fear in his enemies might be a gross understatement.  The German high command would redirect their forces to confront him and hopefully slow him down.  One has to wonder if the German officers ever thought they could actually stop him as stopping him was next to impossible.  His forces moved quickly, not allowing the enemy to set up proper lines of defense.  In the few instances where they did have defense lines set up in time he just went through them using brute force.
  His reputation was such that he was even able to disrupted the entire German military machine with a ""phantom army"" prior to the invasion on June 6, 1944.  This was an army that did not exist but the German military thought it did and that it was led by Patton.  They spent an inordinate amount of time and effort trying to figure where and when he would invade.  Fortunately for the Allies, the ruse worked and they were able to convince the Germans that the invasion would be somewhere other than the Normandy beaches of France.
  Patton understood war and conflict as few do today.  He was a student of wars from the past and knew that if you do not study history, you are due to repeat the mistakes that had been made by others.  This made him a true warrior to be feared by our enemies. When he showed up, all the BS stopped and the job got done.  He had little to no tolerance for anything that did not lead directly to the objectives of winning battles and thus the war.  He may not have been well liked by some of his so-called friends, but at least they knew where he stood.  He had his faults but with his record of winning battles and taking enemy ground, these were largely overlooked.  Unless, of course, they made it into the newspapers of the time.
  The first two minutes of this movie are two that once you see them, you will most likely never forget them.  They set the tone for what is to come and give you a brief but deep look into the character of the man .
  After watching this movie, one has to ask themselves if anyone else could have played the part of Patton better than George C. Scott.  He is simply awesome in bringing the crustiness and violent nature of Patton to the screen.  This movie got tons of accolades when it was released and all were well deserved.
  Watch the movie and you will wish we had more men like him to protect and serve us in this day of wimps, wusses and political correctness.  This is a great movie about a great man who spoke his mind about whatever was asked of him.

My father was a veteran of WWII and the Korean war, so I understand the politics, ceremonies, regulations, and military ways. I was an ""army brat"", and I enjoyed it very much. Patton made many mistakes on a personal level, but he loved his troops. Those who served under him either liked or hated him, but they all respected him. This book gives me more incidental commentary on his personal, political, and military style. He was a majestic manipulator and bad boy all in one persona. This book is a good read and the situations regarding Patton are well written and understandable.

1644846,5,B00005PJ8O,"This movie shows why politics should stay out of making military decisions. If the politicians had not gotten involved the war would have been over earlier and with fewer casualties. There was too much emphasis on doing the politically correct thing as opposed to doing the correct military action. Patton was one of our greatest generals but was not used properly during World War II. The movie was extremely well done. George C Scott was an excellent choice to play Patton. This movie should be a must see for anyone studying World War II or military history. The political decisions influencing military action are so like what's happening today with disastrous results.

It also showed how the media slanted Patton's words to create inflamatory headlines that didn't help the war effort and were almost slanderous to Patton. Sounds a lot like today too.  Media slant of events can do terrible things.  Almost like the Hearst papers writers got us into the Spanish American War.",1407196800,,981,4.969512195121951

Patton tells the story of General George S. Patton's unique grasp of war.  It's no wonder George C. Scott excelled in this role.  For one thing, he could easily hear his name and identify himself with his character.  For another, he could put on an over-the-top show of arrogance and STILL fall short a tad.  Patton was a general unlike his peers.  Patton was a soldier first and general second.  Scott could portray that.

George C. Scott's opening monologue is a piece of work others only hope to be able to pull off.  Scott SELLS himself as Patton in those fleeting minutes.  Scott, under the direction of Franklin J. Schaffner, makes you believe he, General George S. Patton, is standing in front of YOU!  It is YOU he is talking to, nobody else but you.

1645038,3,B00005PJ8O,"I've seen this movie several times in my life and have reacted differently depending on whatever phase of my life I was in.  As a pre-pubescent and adolescent boy, I fixated on the patriotic and heroic themes of the film--it was made in the late 60s, and boys of my generation were taught to see war as a great adventure. In early adulthood I began to see the maniacal, self-aggrandizing arrogance which consumed George C. Scott's Patton.  It's been about 15 years since I last watched the movie, and I now see western warfare for what it is, a wholesale mix of the business and bureaucracy of impersonal, mechanized and automated death which degrades us and steals precious time and resources from the human race.  This is epitomized by the portrayals of the blind, politically motivated battlefield decisions made by German and Allied general staffs.  The simple socio-economics of WW II were that nations would either destroy or be destroyed, with the loser being removed from existence.  The racial superiority and genocide which Germany practiced made it more abhorrent, but economic scarcity was the driver behind both World Wars.  As many others have stated, I too feel that many years from now future generations and historians will regard both wars as one in the same, with a 20 years interlude.

This docu-drama picks up in 1942 Africa, on the eve of Patton's rise to prominence.  Beyond Patton's anecdotal musings of reincarnation and side comments to his peers referring to their days in academia, the film completely fails to explore Patton's origins and the influences on his life such as West Point and athletic competition culminating in his participation in an Olympiad.  Character development in this film is nearly null save for Patton himself, and only then showing that he moderates his actions not for any real good, only to keep himself in command a little longer.  It does reflect that the whole charade falls apart after the war in Europe ends, with Patton finally being relieved of duty permanently.

I cannot help but think there was much more to the man who was Patton, but this film only accounts for the events of WW II and his actions within it.  He too was shaped by WW I and is in fact regarded as one of the founders of mechanized, armored warfare, which has now largely become obsolete as a battlefield function.",1405728000,,2347,4.8254364089775565

I remember when I went through basic training many years ago while the Vietnam War was still on. On the first day,they sat us down in one of the base theaters and showed the intro speech given. I guess it was their form of propaganda to get our combat juices flowing. Not sure that really worked. But, it did show the character and battle rhythm that Patton wanted to instill in the troops under his command. In this regard, it was spot on as was the depiction of Patton by George C.

1645059,5,B00005PJ8O,"""Patton"" is one of my favorite WWII movies and a possible stopping point if it comes up in my ""Recommendations"" when surfing. This has a little bit of everything going for it, including great acting (Carl Malden and George C. Scott), historically accurate feel, a good bit of drama, and even some humor.

This is also one of the movies I watched with my two teenagers to expose them to the movies that influenced my childhood.

Highly Recommended!

I have not researched the actual history of General Patton so I cannot comment on the authenticity of this movie or how close it with the real man, but I can say that this movie can inspire one to do more research and reading to understand the man, the men, and the overall events that was WWII.  If anything, these men should not be forgotten, nor the events (good or bad).  Getting back to the movie, George C. Scott does a fantastic job in his acting role as Gen. Patton.  In my opinion, it is one of his best roles ever... defining his career as an actor and winning Best Actor Award from the Motion Picture Academy.  The quality of the overall story and acting is excellent.  This movie, made back in 1970, used a lot of the old school techniques like making the Germans actually speak German.  The only thing I would say was really off or can be considered a CON of the movie was the use of certain army hardware that might not have been known to many regular movie goers.  The tanks in the movie were M47 and M48 Pattons... kind of ironic.  There were very little actual authentic hardware used, except the short clips of actual film news footage integrated into the movie.  But, it still looked good in my opinion, not authentic... but good for this movie.  Near the end of the movie, Gen. Patton almost gets hit by a animal drawn cart... which seems to hint at the actual way he died.  He ended up in real life dying from complications after being in a traffic accident (hit by a truck while in riding as a passenger in a car).  Lastly, I cannot end this review without mentioning the fantastic musical score (composed and conducted by Gerry Goldsmith)... which is just not seen in movies any more.",1405209600,,1807,4.406626506024097

Imagine playing the role of one of America's greatest, yet utterly baffling heroes, who believed he had been in Napoleon's Army retreating from Russia, with the Carthaginians in North Africa, who said he could ""smell"" a battlefield and accurately identified one from early history, and yet was a wealthy, polo playing rich guy between World Wars (who, by the way, won most of his battles). Crazy? Maybe...but so crazy he pulled off the greatest rescue of WW II (relieving the 101st Airborne at Bastogne). You gotta love this guy -- if Patraeus had been so bold would he have been relieved or adored?  In any event, Scott is perfect as Patton and the story should be retold because that same American exceptionalism that made Patton a hero is waiting to be portrayed again by a new generation of heroes, ready to act if called to do so by their country.

I can't say I liked everything Patton did, but he was living in a world wide inferno of a hell on earth so I think he did better than most would have in his position. Francis Ford Coppola wrote the screenplay for Patton and I was deeply impressed by the style. It captured the general's character extremely well. The acting of George C. Scott was above reproach.

He was hard on his men and sometimes saw victory as something more valuable then his men's lives and this movie shows that side of him as well.
Some memorable quotes:
Patton: ""Nobody ever won a war by giving his life for his country. We win wars by making the enemy give his life for his.""
His Soldiers: (On Patton as he passes by them in a motorcade) ""There goes old blood and guts. Our blood and his guts.""
Cold, brutal, plain talk.

This review is for the 40th anniversery edition.  I'm sure there are other blu-ray versions out for this movie that have been remastered, so this review would also apply to them.

The picture quality is fantastic, and in fact looks better than some of the movies that have come out in the last couple of years.  Now in saying that this doesn't mean the picture is as good as the better quality new releases, but better than many.  For instance I commonly see fuzz on items in the background of various new movies.  This remaster is better than that.

1645338,5,B00005PJ8O,This video is a VERY GOOD one it's well deserved.  Patton was an extremely good General.  He put the Germans into a bad situation and then kept them there.  Without him the war would have lasted a lot longer.,1397433600,,208,4.282051282051282
1645339,5,B00005PJ8O,"In considering Scott's performance in this brilliant film I was put in mind of Cassius's words regarding Caesar, whom he describes as bestriding `this world like a colossus'.  That might be seen as something of an exaggeration but for the fact that he features in virtually every scene.  Similarly, though principally by his admirers, the same might be said about the eponymous general whom Scott embodies as though born to play this one role alone.  In a remarkably nuanced performance, given the characteristics of the man he plays, Scott allows the more sensitive side of Patton's character to appear from time to time and even, though for the briefest of moments, elements of self-doubt and self-recrimination as, for example, he is informed of the plight of American troops landing amphibiously during the battle for Messina or kissing the forehead of an American captain following a ten hour vicious encounter with a German armoured column during the Battle of the Bulge.

However, central to all that happens for the last two thirds of the film is the infamous `slapping' incident following which, on Eisenhower's order, Patton has to apologize to the assembled `offendees' including the doctors and nurses, in addition to the slapped soldier, but still manages to accuse the latter of cowardice in so doing!  He certainly had a way with words but not one best geared to achieve his ultimate purpose, which was to occupy a pivotal role in the upcoming thrust into Nazi Germany.  In fact he is relieved of his command of the 7th Army (Western Task Force, Operation Husky) and has to make do with being merely a decoy back in England to fool the Nazi high command into thinking he was preparing to lead the assault on mainland Europe via the Pas de Calais.

Eventually, after more or less being on his `best behaviour', Patton is given command of 3rd Army, who play a supportive role in Northern France following Operation Overlord, while Omar Bradley (played by Karl Malden) is given command of 12th Army Group.  One can only wonder, in terms of shortening the war, what might have transpired had Patton kept his mouth shut, his hands to himself and their roles been reversed.

The film doesn't seek to mitigate any of Patton's `transgressions' and Scott's towering performance shows Patton in all his belligerent glory.  He receives excellent support from Malden in the other major role and, to a somewhat lesser extent, Michael Bates, as Monty.  But what the film does do is to convey, unambiguously, Patton's sense of personal destiny as if he'd been born for this moment in history: a trait he almost certainly shared with Churchill.

The combat scenes are handled magnificently and the viewer gets a real feel for the sweep and scope of battle with men and machines being manipulated by both sides like pieces on a chessboard.  Added to this is the gloriously (now) iconic score by Jerry Goldsmith.  All in all an epic war film that, by the end, leaves one with the feeling; `they don't make `em like this anymore'!",1397088000,,3026,4.861867704280155
1645340,5,B00005PJ8O,"This movie is a tour-de-force for George C. Scott. As Patton he gets to really chew the scenery as he's in just about every scene. It's a bit of a pro-Patton film, showing him as a real American hero. There are some of his screw-ups, like the soldier slapping incident. The film only shows one incident but in actuality there were two. It shows his rivalry with Montgomery and some of his over-the-top reactions and it's all told in a very entertaining way. All in all, this is a terrific movie about one of our most celebrated Generals. The acting is very fine indeed and there are no tedious moments at all.

Scott's gritty portrayal of a man who, more than anything, wanted to go to war that was fascinating.  Most characters in a role like this usually payed at least lip service to the idea that war was the wrong thing to do, but we really don't have a choice so we need to do the best we can.  Not Patton.  He felt he was a reincarnated soldier from most of the wars over the last several thousand years and he didn't pretend he thought otherwise.  He had a barroom vocabulary, an unwelcome big mouth to the political crowd, and a demanding nature--but, when you needed someone to arrive in the nick of time to stop the Nazi's final push and save your troops from total annihilation, he was your man.  I think the reason it won all those awards was this unique portrayal of the true feelings of a modern warrior.

1645375,4,B00005PJ8O,"In this case, the added features tell a story almost as interesting as the main character of the film biopic. The problem faced by the people backing the movie Patton, was how to retain the legitimate, military hero that was General Patton while appealing to a Viet Nam era anti-war America.

Many of the people most closely tied to the book and film script had firsthand knowledge of the contributions General Patton made to the swift collapse of German defenders in the months between the Normandy Invasion and the Battle of the Bulge. The historic success of Patton's leadership sped the end of the Nazi fantasy that their Ardennes counter offensive would result in a German victory. These were truths worthy of a dramatic movie to honor a man of honor.

However the market in which this movie would compete was one that had tired of conventional WWII movies and leery of patriotic clichs and puffed up be-medaled egotists.

The resulting movie was one promoted Gen George Patton as a man with two sides. One, a  writer of poetry, believer in reincarnation,  utilizing acting and bluffing to beat the system ... Two, a super patriot, fearless in his defiance of all of America's enemies, including temporary allies (the Soviets) and  willing to drive his men at any expense to achieve victory.

Most people comment on the opening speech as one of the most iconic scenes in Hollywood history. This is a market decision and therefore not to be refuted. Even Actor George Scott, felt that this opening would set too high of a standard from his total role to succeed. For myself one of the most important quotes, and most of the Patton's dialogue has historic roots, to General Bradly is more telling of the real General's attitude about war.

Bradley confronts Patton over his egotistical need to beat General Montgomery in the invasion of Sicily. Patton's reply is to ask Bradly to consider how many additional Americana might have died if they had not been pushed to achieve faster results. Part of Patton's warrior genius was in understanding that war can be wasteful of human unless fought in the manner most likely to force the enemy to surrender at a minimal cost to your own.

Of the side to Patton not important to this movie, I mention the importance of his letters to his wife. In many of these we become aware of the real human. The letters make plan his prejudices, many unsupportable, and his humanity. A more nuanced and less bombastic movie would still prove that this was an American worthy of our respect.

Also left out of the movie are one minor action by Patton to recover Allied prisoners including one of his in laws which failed in tragic proportions (this action is discussed in the movie extra features). Patton's involvement in the Huertgen Forest Campaign, where he was not in overall command, but neither his role nor the ultimate success of the action reflected the movie's sense of an unstoppable Patton. There are also more than a few opinions of Patton's role in and failure to appreciate the problem of the Siegfried Line. My point is that Hollywood had its story to sell and history its own debates.

The movie Patton succeeds in staring its two sides of the historic General Patton. The included features add a lot to your appreciation of the living person. Overall Patton is a worthy night of entertainment. It set a much higher standard for war time biopics and is a great addition to the library of those seeking a chest thumping, America the Mighty experience.",1389484800,,3499,4.757425742574258

1645425,5,B00005PJ8O,"This magnificent movie is one of my favourites. It is difficult not to fall in love with General Patton. But be careful. It just may be George C. Scott's performance which enamoured you.

The account of Patton's record during World War 11 is taken from memoirs of himself, Gen. Omar Bradley and German records. This is the one general the Germans stood in awe of: the one general they feared. When the Germans were burning records and making a retreat during the end of the war, one of them, burning his picture, called Patton the pure warrior, whom the absence of war would kill. Within the next year, Patton was dead, dying from an accident after having come through the war unscathed.

Patton was a lot of things. One thing he was not was political. He didn't know how to keep his mouth shut. He said and did disturbing things, getting in hot water continually with Ike (Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower). He couldn't get away with anything, since he made such good copy, the reporters were always after him.

He slapped a soldier and declared him a coward who was shell-shocked (or whatever the modern term is) and whose nerves were totally gone. For that, Ike made him apologize to the soldier, units of soldiers, and the hospital staff. But did he do it on their level? He did not. He stood on a balcony above them, looking down on them. Had he been on the same level, it might have been more effective.

He stormed across Europe to Berlin, marching his soldiers 24 hours to relieve the Battle of the Bulge soldiers, then on to Berlin. But still, he couldn't stay his mouth or stay out of trouble. In an interview with reporters, he was asked about leaving Nazis in key positions. He said that they knew how to keep the water works and electricity working. In response to one question, he said that Nazis had joined the party in the same way that American Republicans or Democrats had done. It was in response to a trick question, and he fell for it.

He also wanted to kick the Russians in the behind and send them back where they belonged. He told Ike he had the troops and begged to be able to do it. Given the cold war that developed for years and years, Patton was right.

But he was politically incorrect. He suffered for it. The Americans got rid of him. In a well-balanced scene, it showed Field Marshall Montgomery of Britain being received by the King of England to be honoured with the country's highest award. The scene switches to that of Patton leaving his post and shaking the hands of every one of his staff.

It is heart-rending, but let's keep in mind that Patton's boss (Ike) was looking, even then, towards the presidency. He couldn't afford to have such a politically incorrect general who made such good copy for reporters. So Ike got rid of him.

However, it is also possible that, as the Germans predicted, this greatest of warriors had outlived his time and that the absence of war killed him.

Patton was a deeply religious man. My favourite scene is when he was on his way to relieve the Battle of the Bulge warriors. It had snowed deeply for days and air cover was needed. Patton sends for the chaplain. He tells him he wants ""a weather prayer."" He assures the chaplain that he, Patton, is on such good terms with the Almighty, that if the prayer is offered, the next day will be clear for air cover. Then he says: ""I expect that prayer within the hour.""

The next day was clear. And that was Patton.",1377648000,,3427,4.4688

He plays the famous World War II general, whose nickname was ""Old Blood and Guts,"" as a man without fear or even a shadow of doubt, but with an unmistakable human gleam in his eye. Patton was a flamboyant figure, but Scott's portrayal makes you feel as though you don't care what the real man was like - you could follow this guy anywhere. It's no love letter, however. Patton's flaws are clearly visible: his impatience, his penchant for drama, his tendency toward arrogance, and his deluded sense that he had been reincarnated many times. Winner of seven Oscars, including Best Picture, with Francis Ford Coppola's terrific script and Franklin Shaffner's brilliant direction, this is one of the landmarks in movie biographies. The battle sequences are enormous, using real planes, tanks and heavy guns - and this is decades before computer animation could supply such scope artificially. Shot in Spain and Morocco with a cast of thousands, Patton presents an immense tableau of men in war. This is literal; as in Lawrence of Arabia, women are almost completely absent from the story. The few female characters are marginal and only two of them even speak. Jerry Goldsmith contributed the glorious music fanfare, one of the greatest works for the movies, a rich thematic orchestration that reaches a thrilling crescendo in scenes leading up to the infamous Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 and provides a satisfying coda at the fadeout. Patton is worth seeing on the biggest screen available - it is overwhelming in that format.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime-2014-edition/dp/B00HU8VK4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)</a>",1377475200,,1991,5.509803921568627

I've read a few books about WWII, including the one by Omar Bradley, which is one of two books the movie is based on.  Unlike many ""based on a true story"" movies, this one seems to stick quite faithfully to the facts.  Patton was such a colorful character in real life, that filmmakers  didn't have to invent lots of incidents to create drama and conflict - Patton's WW II career was filled with more than enough conflict and drama to fill a feature-length movie.",1377129600,,594,4.718446601941747

I firmly believe that he was a godsend in a time when the whole world was at stake. At times, Id like to think of him a success in the many Pyrrhic victories where defeat was not an option. Of it, there are many samples in the movie. A history learned scholar the general had a touch of the most needed hubris, but he humbly prayed to God who doubtless was on his side. George C. Scott was born to play his role in the movie. I first saw it during its premier in 1970, and enjoy watching it with relish every-now-and-then, and now than Im older, I seem to appreciate it better and learn new lessons from such a great American leader.

Despite often being tough and unpopular, over time Patton did garner the respect of many an aid, ally, and even enemy. His heroic 3rd army became famous for their exploits all across Europe. By the end of the war, Patton came out a very complex hero from a former age. The reason this film is good not only rest on it being a war movie but also based on character development. George C.

Recommend ""Making of Patton"" 50-minute tv special for more details about the making of the film and Franklin Schaffner, director, for whom it's nominally a tribute.

Errors in the closed captioning:
(a) Gen. *Bedell* Smith in its first two uses, with Patton on phone to Gen. Smith, is shown as ""Bill"" on the closed captioning.  Later uses are shown correctly.  Scott pronounces the name correctly, but quickly.
(b) first two references to the Normandy town *Caen* are pronounced correctly by George Scott but shown on the CC as ""Cannes"" -- which, IIRC, is on the Cote d'Azur and a good ways SE of Normandy;  third reference by Karl Malden is shown as ""Cannes"" also, but Malden mispronounces it that way.",1369958400,,982,4.741176470588235

1645485,4,B00005PJ8O,"I already own the 40th-Anniversary Blu-Ray Book version of this film. That packaging used the 2008 digital remastering of the film, a remastering that seemed OK...until compared to this 2012 BD version, which I went ahead and purchased after reading glowing reviews of this latest remastering at amazon and elsewhere.

As others have noted, this 2012 version is far superior to the 2008 version. There's just so much more detail, contrast and depth to this version that it's hard to believe I could have felt satisfied with the 2008 issue. Visually, this is a stunner, and well worth the $10-20 price point it is often sold at by amazon. The packaging also includes the DVD version.

The soundtrack, however, leaves much to be desired. There's lots of distortion in the sound, and not just in the battle scenes where explosions and the noises of tanks and trucks seem boosted above the normal playback level. The distortion also afflicts the dialogue in many places. Sadly, this is another case of a studio spending money to greatly improve picture quality while doing nothing to improve the sound. One would think that in this age of digital editing and restoration that an effort would be made to get the soundtrack into a condition that matches the visual element. I guess not.

I have one more complaint, and that's with the subtitles that appear whenever the Germans are speaking: they're positioned over the film image and are very difficult to read at times as they're set in white at a very small point size, often against a very light background. I assume the subtitles are in the film negative and have always appeared this way. But with modern digital technology, those subtitles could be removed from the picture and placed below the screen in the black area that sits at the bottom of any HDTV when playing back a widescreen movie. Again, there would be some expense involved, but as there are relatively few subtitles in the movie, it couldn't be that big of an expense.

The visual element of this film deserves a 5-star rating, but the problems noted above knock this version's overall rating down to 4 stars.",1362528000,,2125,4.797814207650274

1645489,1,B00005PJ8O,"I'm sure that this review will be lost at the bottom of some 3 or 4 hundred reviews but I had to speak the truth about this 7 Oscar winning Patton film. I served the bulk of my Army time with the 1st Armour Division at Fort Hood Texas and after my military discharge I did a little research about the tank division. Whenever I would see old film footage of World War 2 and the U.S. tank divisions, images of General George S. Patton as commander are proudly shown. As the tanks knock down the walls of various Nazi concentration camps, Patton and his tank division are first to get there. The film shows some foot soldiers and some other military officers as they tour the camps but they never show Patton's tank drivers, the soldiers who executed all of Patton's heroic deeds. Being a black soldier myself, I always look for the black soldiers in all military war films of World War 2 to gain a better understanding of their roles during the war. I look for them in Army, Marines, Air Force and Navy films of W.W. 2. On most of the war footage I have seen, the black troops are edited out of the film footage. They are edited out of the authentic Patton war footage and they are completely edited out of the Patton movie with George C. Scott. General Patton's complete division was comprised of black troops. Patton himself was very proud of his troops and they were the pride of the entire armour division. The only black soldier in the whole Patton movie was Patton's personal jeep driver which was probably intended to be an insult to the real heroes who served. I am not a historian or a civil rights authority but I know the truth from a fable and the film Patton is a fable. George C. Scott, Karl Malden and all of the actors did a first rate job of acting here but all and only to propagate a 7 Oscar lie. 1 star.",1361836800,,1821,4.296511627906977

1645494,5,B00005PJ8O,This movie is a great movie on General Patton during World War 2. I think the movie is great because of Francis Ford Coppola's screenplay and GeorgeScott's acting. Great Movie!,1360022400,,176,4.9
1645495,4,B00005PJ8O,"In all fairness, I have not purchased this DVD 4-pack.  These are four excellent movies all in their own right.  I just question the wisdom of including ""The Sand Pebbles"" in a package of World War ll movies.
I think that anyone of a number of movies should have been substituted.  Movies such as ""A Bridge Too Far"", ""Midway"" (the original 3-hour version and not the edited 132 minute version), "" The Bridge at
Remagen,""  ""MacArthur"" or ""Saving Private Ryan.""  There are probably many more that could have been included.  I think, however, that the four movies are excellent.",1360022400,,575,4.757575757575758

1645500,4,B00005PJ8O,An excellent performance by George C. Scott (who has an uncanny resemblence to the real Patton) and a film that hits all the right marks in all departments.  Also a terrific job of transferring the film to Blue-Ray disc.,1359331200,,220,4.641025641025641

1645502,5,B00005PJ8O,"I am not a big war movie buff, but I have often wanted to watch Patton, an award-winning 1970 film starring George Patton, the major general in the battle against the Germans.  The DVD is great with a large choice of languages and special features.  I did not understand why, when I clicked on the ""audio history of Patton"" that the DVD returned me to the film.  Very odd.  Despite that anomaly, the film is quite well done.

It's a long movie, almost three hours.  But you're not aware of the time as you really become part of the action.

The battle scenes, the tanks and the unfortunate end of some of the soldiers was hard to watch.  The realism of the film was further augmented by the excellent acting:  Patton as the gruff, can't-keep-his-mouth-shut SOB, who has very sharp opinions of the Nazi's, the soldier who he gives the Purple Heart, and the berating he gives to another for being a coward, including pulling out his Colt pistols to put the kid out of his misery!

You are on the battlefield as Patton recalls his earlier lives fighting with the Romans as they took Carthage, reminiscing as he gives Rommel a run for his money, and the humorous exchange with his British rival, Montgomery, as they take Sicily and eventually the overthrow of the Third Reich.
Recommended, especially for WWII buffs.  The realism and accuracy is great to behold!

1645504,4,B00005PJ8O,Great movie all around.  Patton was a hard driving son of a b1tch .. but he was right.  His belief was to quickly end the battle by overwhelming his enemy.  This is portrayed in the movie as he drives his men hard.,1357603200,,214,4.0476190476190474

1645507,5,B00005PJ8O,"I am starting to acquire a collection of war movie, especially WWII movies. I find the older ones, from the 60's and 70's to have better story lines. Obviously there are fewer films being produced from that era as time goes on. But the generations that come after that event need to remember it. This film does a great job of helping us see what went on as well as a good idea of what George Patton was like. George C Scott was fantastic",1357344000,,437,4.214285714285714
1645508,4,B00005PJ8O,"Four stars for the movie... it's a classic with a bravura performance by George C. Scott in a role he was born to play!

Four stars for the newer 4k film restoration... far and away superior to the first Blu-ray release (avoid at all costs!!) with most of the glorious grain and detail, that 1080p can deliver, intact!  Not a waxy face to be seen.

And, unfortunately, two and a half stars for the audio restoration.  Many times the audio is clipped and distorted, especially when someone speaks loudly or there are big explosions. Some of it may have to do with the original master, some of it may have to do with not watching the levels carefully during the digital remastering process.  It's hard to say, but Lawrence of Arabia's new restoration, with audio tracks predating Patton by almost a decade, sounds many times superior.

Since this will probably be the best release until 4k UHD media is made available, I say pick it up and support the older classics in HD!!  The studios need to know that catalog titles are still viable for release and in the finest condition possible.",1357171200,,1085,4.619791666666667

1645514,3,B00005PJ8O,"This Blu-Ray of Patton faithfully restores a lot of the color and saturation of the original film. Having the film natively in 1080p definitely helps retain detail that is lost having the DVD version stretched out on a 1080p panel. That being said, this really doesn't look better than the DVD version being viewed on an SD television. There's less noise than the AMC broadcasts and to a lesser extent the DVD, but really, if you exclude the opening sequence, there really isn't a lot that pops out in great detail. Is it good? Yes, but if you have an SD TV with the DVD version, don't expect anything better.",1356480000,,609,4.545454545454546

And accurate replicas for German Tiger tanks were kinda hard to find, even in the early 70's.

Still, I think it's well done. And for me, I grew up thinking this movie was a primer on what being a real man was all about. Say what you think, do what you say, and to hell with what anyone else thinks about it. Now I know, we all have to live in our PC world and be in touch with everyone's feelings now.

George C. Scott does an outstanding job in the role. The musical score is by turns rousing and haunting. Karl Malden does a great, understated job as the modest Omar Bradley, which is an added bonus, as is the actor who plays the German officer who seems to be channeling Patton's soul all the way from Berlin. You don't have to be a warmonger to love this movie. I'm a liberal Democrat who opposed the war in Iraq from Day One, and I really enjoyed it.",1355097600,,673,4.349206349206349

It was a moving experience enhanced by witnessing Chinese tourists paying their respects to our American hero. The Chinese were transfixed by this movie when it was premiered throughout China. They have come at a rate of about 300,000 per year ever since to visit his grave. Amazing respect! The movie stitches together several well-known example vignettes from Patton's awesome combat record and uses the drama to describe the coalition politics and monumental struggle that was WWII.

For a war film to garner the oscar for best movie during the height of the Vietnam War was quite remarkable and the film deserved a remarkable Blu-ray disc.  This second remastered version scores on that count and is certainly worthy of purchase regardless of any other versions you have.  It's that good.  As soon as the opening scene begins it's cuts to the close ups of Patton's uniform just prior to his opening speech you know this is the highest level of detail and color accuracy you have ever witnessed for this film.  The dynamic range of the picture and the beautiful color will continue to surprise you.  I doubt if the film ever looked this good in the theaters.  The soundstage is broader and more detailed than ever and voices are crystal in their clarity.  The second disc of special features is icing on the cake.

Of the 4 movies in the package, I would say PEBBLES is still the weakest transfer, although it is still of a higher quality than many blu-rays I've seen.  I suppose that just points to the superior quality of the other 3 in the set.  Both PATTON and THE LONGEST DAY are stunning.  Extras are strongest with PEBBLES.  It's possible that PATTON and LONGEST are single disks in multiple-disk collections.

The original movie showed how he died, this movie cut short of showing that event. His belief of having been reborn several times over as a military man gives my own opinion on that subject of having been reborn. In the original movie they show his wife toward the end of the movie supporting him, in this they also have cut it out of the movie. Could you imagine had he lived and been transferred to the Pacific war zone how much conflict there would have been between him and MacArthur? Who knows, if he had been transferred, between the two of them they could have ended the War without the need of the BOMBS.

1645545,5,B00005PJ8O,"""Patton"" is a perfect example of how great moviemaking and great story telling don't necessarily have to be rooted in fact. This is one of the greatest American movies ever made, withe several brilliant performances from Scott and others, great writing, breathtaking cinematograph, and a score that at times sends chills down your spine. This is truly great filmmaking. Unfortunately, it's also very poor history. The writers relied heavily on Ladislas Farago's biography and Omar Bradley's autobiography, and as a consequence, Bradley comes off almost angelic in comparison to Patton, who is portrayed as a foul-mouthed, near insane fanatic, and he was none of these things.

George Patton was a child of the 19th Century, born to great wealth, who put all that aside in order to devote his life to being a soldier, and he do so magnificently. He actually used a chunk of his personal fortune to buy spare parts for the new US Army Armored divisions between the wars, when there wasn't enough government funding to keep them going. Those who served under him were almost unanimous in their their admiration, and those who fought against him believed he was the greatest general the Allies had. Bradley, by comparison, was often characterized as overly cautious, relieving commanders who showed initiative, and refusing the the British offer of specialized tanks (""funnies"") in the Normandy invasion. His public image was largely the product of the writing of Ernie Pyle, who took it upon himself to lionize Bradley.  Unfortunately none of this comes across in the film.

And yet... I still think this is a five star film. It's so well made, so excellent in every way, that I think the question of historical accuracy can be disregarded when judging it. See it, and enjoy it, but don't come away thinking it's a true portrayal of the characters portrayed.",1346889600,,1855,4.996763754045308

Given the anti-war sentiment at the time, I was surprised to find a theater full of these types who loved Patton.  This is one of the few ""war"" movies which does not glorify it.  Most films fade in time as they have little relevance to generations which follow.  This film is perfect as the first time I saw it a lifetime ago.  George C.

At the time, it seemed well done and a reasonably accurate depiction of General Patton's activities during WWII. Unfortunately, the memories were better than the viewing of the DVD, perhaps due to having read considerably more history of those activities.

In any case, the DVD didn't come up to par and was a somewhat gratuitous representation of Patton's role in the war. While it wasn't a total wash-out, it failed to accurately and fully depict what occurred, avoided all the politics between Ike and Patton and glossed over military operations that were depicted.

1645550,5,B00005PJ8O,"Let's face it, Hollywood hates Patton because he was one of the first to suggest that Stalin was a worse than Stalin.  If it were not for all the Nazi films of their attrocities, we  have seen them all.  Howver, had we seen films of the Japanesse atrocities in China, or Mao , or the death by starvation of many millions more of Ukranians, ethnic Germans living in Russia, or Jews ( Trotsky being the most famous Soviet Jew, who was killed shortly after Stalin had to behave himself getting rid of his political enemies and taking over Eastern Europe.  Patton was the American's greatest General during WWII, although MacArthur could be argued to be the best. His problem with today's worshipers of FDR and Truman, was that he was a potential political rival.  Bill Maudlin, the favorite cartoonist of Stars and Stripes hated Paton because he was a General whose philosphy clashed with the civilians whom he had to make into soldiers. The famous slap of the shell shocked soldier was not as bad as the countless mistakes caused by inferior generals who caused their lives to be lost.  Patton's slap was not fatal, he was not a social worker who knew or cared much for battle fatique.  A lot of soldiers caused self inflicted wounds. If Patton allowed such actions, indeed, if any General allowed such actions, Hitler would never been defeated.  That Patton or MacArthur were not perfect men, is not debatable. Howver, General Bradley, the ""soldiers's soldier lived to write his own history. He never slapped a soldier, but he probably cost more lives to be lost than Patton or MacArthur.  And as for Patton's negative remarks about Stalin, as we look back in hindsight, was Eisenhower, Bradley or FDR correct in thier misjudgement about Communism and Stalin.
Hollywood seems to forget that Hitler was in power for 13 years, and was more or less elected into office.  Stalin was a Dictator for half a century, and became our enemy. Thanks to Hollywood, Hitler has become the villan of the century, while Stalin somehow comes in second as the Devil of the 20th Century. yes, the Nazi death camps were horrible, but were they any worse than those of the communists? We just do not have films, nor were the Western Allies allowed to see the communists attocities.  This is not deny the ridiculous arguments made by Iran, that the Holocaust did not exist. But it is a shamefull error to ignore the fact that Stalin started the war against the West, and stole our secrets fo half a century. Meanwhile, Germany has become one of our best allies.",1341014400,,2538,4.706546275395034

1645553,4,B00005PJ8O,"Director Franklin Schaffner's 1970 film, Patton, is a film that falls just shy of overall greatness, unlike his previous film, Planet Of The Apes, even though both had excellent scripts, were unconventionally shot, had great acting performances, and were films that fundamentally altered their subgenres, biopics and science fiction. It is a film that, while it's clearly not a great film, does not offer up an obvious reason. It starts off brilliantly, with Patton's famous address to the film audience, and then, well, becomes, in many ways, a routine biopic- at least when it's not about Patton directly, for George C. Scott owns the screen like few actors ever before him had. No, it's when we see other characters, or the big battle scenes, that the film becomes pedestrian. And that 20% or so of pedestrian film lowers the rest of the film's inarguable greatness to merely near-great status.

  Patton is not a great film, but in its flaws it delineates much of what a great film can be, and just how little of that needs to stem from the idea of a visionary or an auteur. As such, and along with Casablanca, it stands as one of the great arguments against the notion that films of quality must be wrought from the power and inspiration of a singular source. Franklin Schaffner, in fact, is proof that great art can come from people who are not gifted with innate greatness, just as the real General George S. Patton proved the opposite can also be true, and the two ideas not mutually opposing. As for the film, watch it for Scott's performance, watch it for a sense of American history (pro and con), and watch it because it's great entertainment, if not great art. Not all art need core into one's soul, sometimes pricking the flesh is enough. As such, Patton's a great prick.",1340236800,,1785,4.696485623003195
1645554,5,B00005PJ8O,"George Patton was the scion of a wealthy family in California. He was an athlete and sailed his own boat to Hawaii in the 1930s to assume a command. He was a member of the US Olympic team in 1912, competing in the modern pentathlon.  He served in World War I and his interest in armour began here with command of the US Tank Corps.  The movie takes up his career when he was assigned to replace General Freydendall after the battle of Kasserine Pass in which green American troops were routed by the Germans under General Rommel. The movie is pretty accurate although Patton had a high pitched voice, unlike the growling baritone George C Scott adopted in the role. Having read a biography of General Marshall, I don't believe that Patton was as much at risk of being sent home as is depicted in the movie. Marshall and Eisenhower well well aware of Patton's strength as a troop commander. He, himself, recognized that he was no politician and was marginally suited for high command in which politics are as important as military genius.

The movie has established the reputation of Patton with the public, which has a probably hazy impression of Wold War II by now. It is well done and the Blue Ray version is a visual treat. Scott won an Academy Award for the role, which was well deserved. Karl Malden does well playing General Bradley and, as Bradley was technical advisor for the film, it is no surprise that he comes out of it as the wise adult to Patton's brash immaturity at times. Some of the scenes that appear exaggerated, such as the ""weather prayer"" and Patton's belief in reincarnation, are accurate and add to the man's reputation as an eccentric.

1645590,4,B00005PJ8O,"The role of George S. Patton in Patton, like the roles of Lt. Col. Frank Slade in Scent of a Woman and Willie Stark in All the King's Men, is the kind of role to leave aspiring over-actors chomping at the bit.  And George C. Scott chews up every scene in which he appears.  But such is as it should be.  Patton was an outsized figure in American history.

Patton follows the career of American general and tank commander Patton from taking a command during the North African campaign of WWII through the conclusion of the war in Europe.  This gives the movie an appropriate dramatic arc as it follows the Patton's career from an untested general to being sidelined for intemperate remarks (the Germans, unable to comprehend a free press and civilian control of the military, are suitably confused) to his triumphant return to the war on the mainland to a bittersweet d&eacute;nouement.  In between, Patton's brutally honest and unfiltered mouth and intermittent tank battles keep the level of entertainment high.

Patton is completely Patton-centric (the first hint was the title).  When Patton is off-screen, characters have little to talk about but Patton.  A German intelligence officer serves as a sort of Greek chorus, telling the audience what to think in impotent attempts to inform his superiors.  I could have figured it out for myself.  The input of other commentators, historical figures such as American general Bradley and English general Montgomery, is better taken, as the viewer is forced to filter it through the speaker's own biases.

Patton is certainly sympathetic to the general, but it also presents him as a tragic figure.  He can never live up to his own expectations.  He is openly rueful he is not living in a different time (as if the era of WWII wasn't warlike enough for anyone).  His mouth continues to get him in trouble despite his best efforts, a particularly harsh way to fail for someone with his personality.  And in the end he is left a warrior without a war to fight.

Little, outside of Patton speaking fluent French, is seen of Patton's intellectual side.

The DVD extras include theatrical trailers for Patton, Tora! Tora! Tora!, and The Longest Day; cast credits; and, in lieu of a traditional audio commentary, an audio essay on the historical (I suppose to say ""real"" would have made them feel silly) Patton overlaid on the movie.

-George S. Patton

If one did not know that this quote was said by General George S. Patton on June 5, 1944, it could be taken that it was the from a cold-blooded, patriot with no respect for humanity-or at least the Germans. Fortunately, Patton was that, but he also had much more humanity and intellect in him than the Axis powers.

Patton begins the chronicle of the General's exploits after the Battle of the Kasserine Pass. As Patton arrives at headquarters, he assigns Omar Bradley as his deputy, and warns him that there are going to be serious changes around the base. He reduces the breakfast time from two hours to fifteen minutes, and instructs all soldiers to wear helmets. He concludes that the reason they have lost the Battle of Kasserine is due to the lack of discipline, and installing it can give the soldiers the gravity of their situation.

From the very onset it becomes clear that Patton respects his solider, but only the soldiers that fight fearlessly and selflessly for their country. He has no respect, and in some occasions condemns, the ""cowards."" To Patton anyone complaining of ""nerves"" on the battlefield or with self-inflicted wounds is a coward. These individuals do not deserve to be treated to the Army's medical service, as that should be reserved for the most fearless of soldiers who have given their life for their country with no hesitation. Patton is disgusted at these soldiers who complain about the cruelties of war, and treats them with reproach.

As odd as it may sound that a General cannot comprehend his soldiers fears and worries, it must be stated that Patton is not in war due to obligation or simply to serve his country. As General Bradley points out, and Patton assents, he ""loves"" war, and WWII is the best incident where his ambition can be tested. Unlike many other Generals his outlook towards war is not an event that must be dominated so the peaceful times can roll, but simply an exciting time in history that he must not miss. WWII for Patton is what Woodstock must have been for hippies, a joyous occasion where talent, ambition, and motivation comes together and euphoria occurs. Simply look at the scene where Patton is guiding the tanks through the muddy banks. That scene exemplifies his love of the battlefield, the joy of commanding, and the passion of leading men in battle. World War II may be a curse and abominable incident for many, yet Patton's views this as a chance that occurs every thousand years. He treats war as if it is a football game, and he may not get another chance to prove himself. His view may be attacked because of his somewhat ludicrous outlook on war, but it must understood that not all men join the army out of a sense of honor or obligation-some actually find the experience quite electrifying.

Patton's spirituality is one of the oddest parts of his attributes. When he is complimented that he would have made a great general for Napoleon had he lived in the nineteenth century, he argues that he WAS living at that time. Many of his guests are confused at this response, but guffaw anyway. Patton's belief in reincarnation is a big motif of the film, as well as his mention of important historic facts and events-such as the Battle of Zama. Patton is a history aficionado like no one else, and continually refers to previous battles in regard to the regions his troops will overtake. He recounts how these lands were once taken by the Athenians and other respectful ancient powers. Patton seems to envision that all previous rulers conquered and devoured on the battlefield, and now he will continue in their footstep -but this time in the name of the United States of America. As the Germans point out, Patton is a man of the past stuck in the twentieth Century evidenced by his famous quote: ""God, I hate this century. God, I hate the twentieth Century."" The opposition correctly predicts that Patton will invade Sicily because historians have shown that Sicily is the heart of Italy and Patton's ideology is interwoven with history.

Patton's outspokenness usually got him in deep trouble, and often limits his position in the army. His dislike for the Russians and dislike of General Bernard Law Montgomery more than often earns him the scorn of the major politicians from back home. It is at times baffling to consider his courage in comparing the Democrats and Republicans to the Nazi's. Patton may have been controversial, at times exaggerating, but he was not necessarily incorrect in his assessments. Though never appearing in the film, Ike's relationship with Patton is an intriguing one. Even after all the controversies that Patton creates for himself, Ike still supports him; though there eventually came a breaking for Ike when the General's unsavory comments left no leeway of support from Ike or any other public figure. It is of note that Patton who once was superior to Omar Bradley and Dwight Eisenhower, eventually became subordinate to both. Though Ike's swift rise to power was due to conditions unrelated to Patton, it can be stated that Patton's outspoken nature may have had some effect-though this wild speculation-in Omar Bradley outranking him. It cannot be overstated that however respected Bradley and Ike where in the eyes of the German's, it was only General Patton that they feared, and for good reason when we consider the losses that he handed the Germans.

Not enough praise can be bestowed upon Screenwriter Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North's screenplay that is as wise and ageless as any other screenplay ever committed to film. Even though they won the Academy Award for best Adapted Screenplay, this screenplay is still understated in its clarity and rich dialogue. We can clearly discern that were wise enough to commit a certain portrait of Patton to film. Patton is so delicately written that besides being a grand portrayal of American's most successful and outspoken military man, it comes to life as an inspirational representation of accomplishing one's dreams. Patton loves the battlefield because he deems that fighting is the sole reason to live, and his dislike of cowards must be understood from this angle. He does not treat war as unfortunate due to the fact that he has trained all his life for war, for fighting, and conquering. This film with its grand screenplay, cinematography, and direction still is most renowned and praised due to George C. Scott's portrayal of the general. Anyone who has seen  Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb will be taken aback at Scott's controlled yet astonishing portrayal. Often stated as one of the best male performances captured on film, Scott not only gets the Patton's demeanor right, but he completes the harder task of translating the stressful situations that Patton experiences in an illuminating way. Patton does not attempt to show the situations of war, for that has been done countless time, but rather suffices in honoring the men, every one of them, through one figure.",1311033600,,7225,4.830371567043619
1645599,1,B00005PJ8O,"Very first thing!  There is only one version of Patton on Blu-Ray you should get if you want a proper transfer.  Follow this link if you're not already on the correct product:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Patton-Blu-ray/dp/B009A87ZKG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Patton [Blu-ray</a>]

If you're not sure you're linked on the correct one, it's the one with a full upper torso shot of Mr. Scott with the American flag hanging behind him.  That's the remastered version.  All versions with half his face off to the right with a gray/white background are the older, waxy transfer.

Second thing.  To those who waited with me for the remaster, all I can say is WOW!  It looks beautiful.  Detail is strong and the image is once again alive.  You can find comparison screen shots of the two version over at blu-ray.com.  Their review of the remaster also explains their error in giving such high marks to the first blu-ray pressing of the film.

Only read on if you're either bored or don't fully know what the deal is with the two different versions.

Now that Amazon has combined all Patton reviews to be displayed on all versions of the film, I will sum up my original review of the 40th Anniversary Digi-Book Blu-Ray Edition to encompass a more, `in general' tone.  To those wondering why so many people found my review helpful, it was because I researched and found important information about that particular release and felt a duty to inform all future Patton Blu-Ray purchasers that the 40th Anniversary, Digi-Book edition was in fact the same, horrible, DNR mess that had been available on Blu-Ray for a few years prior, just in new packaging.  But the biggest reason for my review was that I knew (thanks to Bill Hunt at The Digital Bits) there was a properly re-mastered version being worked on and I felt a need to inform people so that if they wanted a good transfer, they would need to wait a bit.  Now that my review is visible on all versions, I can see how it would frustrate people to read everything I had written, from the original review to all the updates on the progress of the re-master.  So I shall summarize and make it more appropriately broad in an attempt to be more helpful to everyone.

Now, about the film.  Patton is a classic among classics.  This is perhaps one of George C. Scotts best performances of his career.  And although the film has many inaccurate accounts for the sake of artistic liberties (what true story film doesn't?), all the way to the end with the `all time' ox cart dodge, the performances and cinematography are what make this movie a timeless classic.  Yes, it is slow.  At least for today's ADD, plot line spoon fed, 3D with no actual depth loving audiences.  But to those who prefer story to gimmicks, I would call it ""paced"", and not slow.  This is a dialog heavy film.  Do not go into it thinking otherwise.  And it is long.  But not dull.  George C Scott even won an Oscar for his performance and famously rejected it stating that he did not feel he was in competition with other actors and had this to say about the Academy Awards, ""The whole thing is a goddamn meat parade. I don't want any part of it.""...  This film is almost like a very well directed, greatly acted, stage production.  Accept the set pieces are amazing, real, and captured on a now rarely used 70mm film stock.  So if you are interested in a summed up version of who General Patton was and his incredibly important role in winning WWII, than this would be the film to watch.  So good in fact, that they've never attempted an actual remake of it...yet (studios, please don't).

On to the Blu-Ray issues mentioned above.  If 50% of this movies awesomeness is the beautiful cinematography, than no one should be subject to a sub-par version of this film on the PQ front.  What I want to do here is give everyone yet another heads up.  At this time, the version linked above is the only version of Patton you should purchase on Blu-Ray.  All others, the original release a few years back, the 40th Anniversary Digi-Book edition, and even the copy in the 4-Pack War Movie collection, should be avoided at all costs as they are all the same, awful, waxy looking transfer that was done when few people fully realized what Blu-Ray should be used for in the HD market.

In Blu-Ray's infancy, studios often tried to get rid of all film elements that made a movie look less ""HD"" by today's standards of things being shot digitally.  I believe they felt that if there was any grain or softness to a film, it would make people think it was not an HD master and possibly make people not want to jump to Blu-Ray.  The fact is, anything shot on film will have grain.  It's one of the many elements that give film a life and character of it's own.  And even though Patton was filmed on 70mm film, meaning a much finer grain structure than typical film stock, the studio decided to wipe all grain off of the image for the first pressing anyway (known as DNR, or Digital Noise Reduction).  DNR is why we get a `waxy' appearance on faces and other objects on screen on some Blu-Ray discs.  Much like a moving wax museum.  Much of the detail is lost due to this process as well.  I'm not sure why, but some people still like this.  But to film purists who want a movie to look as it looked while in the theaters, this is unacceptable.  Unless it's Pixar, people shouldn't look waxy.  This is exactly what happened with the original pressing(s) of Patton on Blu-Ray.

Thankfully, not only have studios realized that Blu-Ray and an HD displays true role should be to accurately represent the original work as best as possible, but the complaints were heard about Patton as well and a re-master has been in the works for a few years now.  It was released on November 6th of 2012.  If you are looking for a version of Patton that is true to it's original intent and look, than that version is the only one you should get.

Yes, this may have gotten long.  But trust me, not nearly as long as the original post, which I will be archiving in the comments section.

And once again, if you're purchasing Patton on Blu-Ray, be sure it's this version and this version only:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Patton-Blu-ray/dp/B009A87ZKG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Patton [Blu-ray</a>]

1645600,5,B00005PJ8O,"A daring film enterprise at the height of the anti-war and anti-military sentiment in this country, the film seemed to satisfy those who supported the military and those opposed to it. George C. Scott embodied Patton fascinating both audiences who seemed transfixed with a fine script and superior performances of all players. Patton's genius was praised and his neuroses were exploited by those who felt he personified military immorality.

Several viewpoints of Patton' personality and leadership are explored. His staff seem sychophantically loyal, and his soldiers appear to love him or hate Old Blood and Guts (Our blood, his guts)! Eisenhower's chief of staff Bedell Smith couldn't stand Patton, and Patton had a running competition and animosity for Bernard Law Montgomery. Karl Mauldin, plays Omar Bradley who first serves as his assistant division commander and then his superior. Bradley is portrayed as the benevolent and unassuming general who challenges the morality and military wisdom of Patton's decisions.

The Germans seem to be unanimous in their esteem for Patton's audacity and military prowess. When Patton is relieved of his command for slapping a soldier, he is assigned to Sardinia, then Malta, then Cairo, and finally to England opposite the Pas-de-Calais where the allies set up a fictitious army around him. The Germans cannot believe that the best allied commander would actually be relieved for slapping a soldier, and they actually moved troops around the Mediterranean in anticipation of Patton attacking in Sardinia, through Greece, and at the Pas-de-Calais.

Standing at 6'1,"" George C. Scott seemed better at Patton than Patton did who matched him in height but had a high-pitched voice. Scott played up Patton's lack of verbal impulse control, his iron discipline (he was famous for fines), a lack  of patience with subordinate officers, and for slapping a soldier. (Actually, he slapped two). The viewer gets the impression that Patton is a neurotic military genius who is willing to sacrifice his troops to satisfy his vainglory and destiny. His performance is so effective that people will proably remember Scott as Patton rather than Patton as Patton.

Detractors of this movie say that Patton was far more caring of his men than the script allowed. He was liberal with passes, ensured that mail arrived regularly, and that showers and hot food were provided more often than in any other command. He only relieved one general for cause as opposed to Bradley who relieved several. He was always found in front of his men rallying them from the side of the road or walking among them offering us an impression of a man whose bark was worse than his bite. There is no doubt that he instilled pride in his troops and made them believe they were invincible against any enemy.

In spite of the movie's detractors, everything about this production is phenomenal and George C. Scott in a defiant Patton personna, refused the Oscar for best actor that Ryan O'Neil panted for in ""Love Story."" (Well, love is never having to say you're sorry). It has withstood the test of time as being an all-time military classic.

The speech he gives at the beginning of the film is a compilation of many of the salty and foul-mouthed expressions he made over his career. This part is not to be missed, along with the rest of the movie.

When watching the film, don't get too caught up in the fact that, from a historic stand point, it is not accurate.  The tanks and other equipment are more modern versions than what was actually used during World War II (to save costs, the producers employed the use of the Spanish Army for many of the battle scenes).

After the war, General Patton was tasked with control of the larger portion of American occupied Germany, and his job was to dole out justice to the newly defeated enemy.
For all his prejudices, Patton represented to a high degree the honor of the army and the basic generosity of the American people.
He made this very plain in a reply to a question put to him by the army's Theater Judge Advocate: ""In all these talks (to the troops) I emphasized the necessity for the proper treatment of prisoners of war, both as to their lives and property. My usual statement was: ""Kill all the Germans you can but do not put them up against a wall and kill them. Do your killing while the are still fighting. After a man has surrendered, he should be treated exactly in accordance with the Rules of Land Warfare, and just as you would hope to be treated if you were foolish enough to surrender.

As a fresh college grad, I could only appreciate that it was an epic

I just finished watching the blue-ray version of the film after 40 years.
It is also one of the best produced blue-ray disc I've seen.

I found this film one of the greatest war epic, with excellent writing
(by Coppola), acting (by G.C. Scott, K. Malden & other numerous
cast members) and direction (by F.J. Schaffner).

The film provides the viewer a detailed portrait of a warrior who
was either born too late, or born too early.

Often times Patton had been described as a flawed military personnel.
Based on Coppola's brilliant script and Schaffner's expert direction,
the man became a flesh and blood true American whose contributions
to Allies winning the WWII at the European front had been unjustly
overshadowed by then U.S. politics and unjustified media coverage at the

The original film presentation in the theater, on VHS, DVD, and my old CRT TV was muted, grainy, and diffuse.  It is the image quality I distinctly picture in my mind for the movie.  The Blu-ray transfer though was anything BUT muted, grainy, and diffuse.  Regardless how the images have been scrubbed, the movie looks as if it was shot yesterday.  The images are sharp, clear, and bright.  At times the colors on the closeups are a bit too saturated, but not so much to be distracting unless you are a film purist.  When I popped the BD in the player to show my non-purist friends the Blu-ray version, without exceptions their only word was ""wow,"" quickly followed by ""how'd they do that?""

1645621,5,B00005PJ8O,"Other reviewers have described, better than I can, why this is a great film. So I won't try.

I do want to comment on one aspect of it. Though obviously a fairly big-budget film, it's equally obvious that no budget would have been able to do full justice to the scope of the events the movie depicts. You can't have tens of thousands of extras, and thousands of vintage WWII aircraft and vehicles. But the makers of this movie did an excellent job in using the resources they did have to suggest far bigger numbers. You repeatedly see Patton in his jeep or car, leading columns of trucks or tanks, with foot soldiers slogging along beside. And it gives an adequate illusion of much greater numbers.

One way in which they fell a bit short in this area, though, was in the use of aircraft. If you watch this movie, you might get the idea that the entire Luftwaffe consisted of just two twin-engine planes, which followed Patton from North Africa to Sicily to the European continent. I kept thinking ""Can't anybody shoot down those two blasted planes before they do more damage? And how is that they're always harassing Patton, no matter where he is?""",1287187200,,1149,4.572815533980583

1645623,5,B00005PJ8O,"There are times when an actor gets to a play a role he was born to play. Such is the case with George C. Scott, who plays the iconic general. The film chronicles Patton's war years, as he was a man solely built for war, and does it rather well. Scott captures Patton perfectly. I remember watching this on television with my family and my aunt and uncle's family. Afterward my uncle commented that Scott so captured Patton that at one point he was going to go through the screen and say ""Goddammit, Cobleigh, go and put on a decent uniform, you slacker. And don't let me catch you like that again!"" Patton has only two major flaws: One, General Omar Bradley (Karl Malden in a great performance) is seen as Patton's friend. In reality he hated George. Patton was a far better general and informed Bradley that he thought Hitler would attack through the Ardennes, as her had in 1940. Bradley pooh-poohed it, and we all know what happened. Then it was left up to Patton to pull Bradley's cookies out of the fire. The other miscue in the film concerns the equipment. Patton is using M-24 Chaffee light tanks (introduced in 1944, but not really widely used in battle until the Korean War) and the Germans are using M47 and 48 tanks (nicknamed ""Pattons"", ironically). If a movie such as Kelly's Heroes, made the same year, can feature Shermans, why couldn't this high-budget, ""important"" picture? The Sherman was the prominent American tank of the war. As for the German tanks, I can understand not featuring Tigers (there is only one surviving Tiger), but they could have used Stugs, or Mark IVs. In fact, most of the Afrika Corps' armor consisted of Mark IVs. Other than that, it's a great movie. Michael Bates is wonderful as General Montgomery, and is the spitting image of him, even down to the voice. Monty and Patton, being both egomaniacs, were naturally in competition, but both agreed on one thing: they didn't like Ike. After one order Patton received from Ike, his disgust was written on his face, to which Montgomery replied. ""George, if you get an order you don't like, why don't you simply do what I do? Ignore it."" But by no means ignore this movie.",1285545600,,2159,4.6103896103896105

1645631,5,B00005PJ8O,"Few Hollywood biographies capture the ambiguities of the person it portrays, but ""Planet of the Apes"" director Franklin J. Schaffner's biography of General George S. Patton proved the exception to the rule. ""Patton"" received seven Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director, Best Writing, Best Editing, Best Sound and Best Art & Set Direction, and garnered nominations for Best Cinematography, Best Special Effects, and Best Original Music. Repeated screenings of this extraordinary World War II epic combat film, especially George C. Scott's bravura performance, make it difficult to believe that producer Frank McCarthy toiled for 19 years to persuade the Pentagon as well as General Patton's family, both adamantly opposed to it, to help him produce this multi-faceted film.

Scenarist Francis Ford Coppola, long before he made his own masterpiece ""Apocalypse Now,"" penned one of the earliest versions of the ""Patton"" script and realized the deadly pitfalls that lay in the subject matter for any filmmaker. ""Wait a minute, this guy was obviously nuts. If they want to make a film glorifying him as a great American hero, it will be laughed at. And if I write a film that condemns him, it won't be made at all."" Coppola encapsulated the contradictions that confronted McCarthy for nearly twenty years. According to Coppola, only George C. Scott's intervention brought Coppola's long since rejected elements back into the film, particularly the stunning opening with Scott poised in from a gigantic American flag delivering his stirring speech to the troops.

Initially, the Patton family opposed ""Patton,"" and McCarthy recalled the rage of Colonel George S. Patton III who threatened shoot anybody who made a movie about his father. Indeed, Twentieth Century Fox shelved ""Patton"" in 1951 and Warner Brothers following in their footsteps in 1953 not only because the family did not trust the filmmakers, but also because the Pentagon felt any film about Patton would portray the Army in an offensive manner, particularly because the general emerged as such a controversial figure. The family interpreted any movie as an invasion of privacy, lobbied the Pentagon to deny cooperation to filmmakers, and even launched a law suit.

Eventually, the Defense Department cooperated, but it provided none of the equipment that appeared in the film. The Spanish Army furnished the tanks, equipment, and troops for the battle sequences. Patton's daughter Ruth Ellen Totten dropped the law suit after she saw Schaffner's film. Reportedly, Totten told her attorneys, ""Call off the dogs."" She gushed about it. ""I think that it is the best movie I have ever seen since Gone with the Wind."" Totten added brother George was thrilled by Scott's portrayal.

The positive reception of ""Patton"" seems almost inevitable in light of the authenticity of Schaffner's film. McCarthy scored a coup when he convinced General of the Army Omar N. Bradley to serve as 'senior military adviser. Bradley scrutinized the script and later took McCarthy and Schaffner on a tour of the battlefields in Belgium, France, and Tunisia, so Schaffner was confident that ""we didn't do anything which was outrageous or silly."" However, McCarthy had to purchase Bradley's memoirs to obtain his services. Inevitably, ""Patton"" compared its insane, quixotic hero with Bradley's more down-to-earth, humanitarian general. Four-star General Paul Harkins, who had been Patton's chief of staff, joined Bradley as another military adviser. These two figures placated the earliest anxieties that the Patton family had about the production.

Clocking in at walloping 169 minutes, ""Patton"" depicted the celebrated general as an amalgamation of contradictions. He was religious but profane. He was violent but sentimental. George C. Scott perused Patton books and watched news reel films. Indeed, Scott transformed his appearance to resemble the general. Totten called Scott's portrayal ""tour de force."" Winning the acceptance of the Patton family and the military proved one part. Twentieth Century Fox had to win over moviegoers during the era of the Vietnam War with most people agreed that the nation has lost the war. Co-scenarist Edmund North summarized what attracted audiences divided over Vietnam to ""Patton"": ""I believe it was because each person brought to it his own underlying feelings about the Vietnam war.""

Those who were appalled by Vietnam interpreted ""Patton"" a fascinating anti-hero. Those--like Richard Nixon--who regarded Vietnam as a noble enterprise could find comfort and support in Patton's self-righteous and dedicated savagery."" President Nixon watched ""Patton"" twice and admired the general's arch-authoritarian attitude. Later, Nixon denied in an interview with David Frost in 1977 that the film ""Patton"" had inspired him to launch his Cambodian invasion Cambodia five days after watching Patton the second time. The film has many memorable moments, especially Patton's orders to a chaplain to intervene with God with a prayer for good weather and the scene in the desert when Patton leaps out of a window to fire on a German aircraft. Karl Mauldin is fabulous as General Bradley and there are tanks galore. Every World War II fan should put ""Patton"" on their required viewing list of movies.",1268784000,,5281,5.364294330518697

But it took forever and was incredibly hard to load, even though my TV and Blu-Ray player are good and fairly new and I have no trouble playing other Blu-Ray DVDs. Once loaded, there was no way to bypass previews and interviews and go straight to the movie (though I was able to ""scene-skip"" through them). And every time I stopped the action for a minute or two (to answer the phone, say), when I returned, the movie was back at the beginning and I had to start all over, this time scene-skipping, fast-forwarding and fast-reversing back and forth to find my place. I finally resorted to just hitting PAUSE and trying to get back before it cut off. It was as if I was watching a pirated Korean version, though the box looks legit and I got this from Amazon.

My father loved this movie (he was a Lt. in Patton's 3rd Army during WWII).  He took me to see it when it first came out in 1970, during the height/depth of the Vietnam war so I guess it will always bring back memories.

1645640,5,B00005PJ8O,"This is the role that George C. Scott was born to fill. He portrays Patton as a very complex general, born perhaps out of time. Some of the most haunting scenes are when Patton reflects on his role in the battles against our enemies during the Second World War. How his destiny and a sense of deja vu overcomes him as he hears muted battle trumpets coming from afar. He feels that he was here before, long before.  A telling, sober tale of a great American hero, born of a time and for a  great role in our nation's history.",1261353600,,524,4.23
1645641,3,B00005PJ8O,"Some films, no matter how great they `were', just don't hold up over time.  I'm sure that, at the time of its release, `Patton' was a stellar film.  In fact, I know it was.  The film won seven Academy Awards (although, I know of a recent Oscar winning film that wasn't stellar upon its release, so I guess the Oscar's are not the perfect judge of quality) and has been hailed as one of the best biographical war movies of all time.

I don't know, to me, it just felt `cheap'.

Despite a blisteringly good performance by George C. Scott (I really love this guy as an actor, for he can really do just about anything), the film falters for me in scope and construction.  While the development of Patton himself is quite good, I found that everything going on around him felt cluttered, sloppy, confusing, rushed and, well, cheap.

And I totally understand the detractors that call this movie boring, for at nearly three hours it does ride at a slow pace for the most part.

While I am not a huge fan of war films to begin with, I am a very big fan of the biopic and an even bigger fan of the slow, brooding character study.  Sadly, even my patience was tested in parts.  Some films really stretched themselves and delivered something that was `ahead of its time'.  `Patton' is the type of film that feels outdated by the time the decade was over.  It feels like a poorly made `Television Movie' to me, and that is never good.

When you consider the types of war films that came out in the late 70's you have to wonder why this particular film wasn't...better.

Still, George C. Scott is a marvel here, and his performance does elevate the film in many areas.  As much as I wanted to end my viewing early on many occasions, it was Scott who kept me glued to the television.  `Patton' is far from a great film (as one friend once said to me, great movies are the ones that `hold up' over time) but it sports an astonishing performance and does carry with it some intriguing history.  It is a film that is worth watching at least once.  I understand good and well that entertainment and the enjoyment it brings is purely subjective, and our own personal situations, emotional crutches and whatnot all play a big part in what we find enjoyable, moving and shapes what we consider masterpieces.  So, I totally understand why so many adore this film.

I hope that you can understand why I didn't.",1260835200,,2387,4.418764302059497
1645642,5,B00005PJ8O,"There are a plethora of reviews of the movie, but my review is mostly a comparison of the BD vs DVD version. I won't discuss its merits as movie.

I saw Patton as a child in a theatrical release. But since, I've seen it also on VHS tape, 2 DVD versions and finally BD, as different releases were made.

This movie is stellar in BD. It is closer to what I recall as a child in terms of detail available on a large CinemaScope style screen.  The sound does not have 5.1 imaging, but its clear and crisp, with dynamic range to make the explosions boom into your living room, while still hearing the dialog among the characters.  You'll hear more instruments in the musical soundtrack that are muffled by the lower resolution DVD and VHS sound tracks.

The quality of the transfer is so good, it compares favorably against the just released Star Trek 2009. Patton looks like it was filmed just yesterday.

Having seen several versions it was amazing to see details I've never seen before.

In the opening address of the troops against the American flag, you can see Patton sweat big beads under his neck as his speech progresses.  The weave pattern on unit insignias are detailed on uniforms, the amputated limbs among dead soldiers in the opening post battle scene after Kasserine are more ghastly, appreciate the texture of desert sand and its transitions to land as it becomes mixed with gravel, appreciate different types of plants and cacti on the grounds, see a supposed ""dead"" body flinch as scorpions crawl on his skin, or read the details on prop newspapers read by Montgomery about Patton in Palermo.

In the scene were Patton meets his his new aide after Jensen is killed, you can make out the building's all wood interiors, including lacquer on doors, 1940 era electric light switches with external wiring snaking on the walls, see the notes on the sheet music during the wine-dine session as Patton plans the attack on Sicily, appreciate different clothing materials on all the characters such as woven cotton belts, leather in holsters, cotton ammo cases and bandoleers, to the rust on the toilet seat bowls in the lavatory as Monty plans his Sicily attack.

Its more anachronistic to see 1960s era tanks substitute for 1940 era models, if you know the WWII period technology well.  The jeeps used are the larger 1950s version versus the smaller, and lithe 1940s jeep.  The vehicle paint strokes and uneven metal forging are so real I felt I was at the Aberdeen tank museum in Maryland, than seeing a movie.  In the scene where a US column is blocked by a cart pulled by stubborn mules, you can easily make out paint over rust in the vehicle Patton is on just before shooting the mules.

1645645,5,B00005PJ8O,"this movie presents somewhat of a paradox. All of us are asked to align with our true passion, our true love. Patton knows that his destiny is something to do with being a warrior, today and yesterday. Its not a loving selection, throwing young kids out in front of tanks, or picking one up shaking from fear, and throwing him from the hospital, but the world was being challenged by the fanatical Hitler, and ignoring his actions was not an option. The same goes from the peaceful Hindu's years ago: they had to eventually defend themselves from the fanatical Muslims that tried to exterminate them.

Patton exemplifys a man totally adhered to his passion; a rogue, a maverick, only someone like himself can get the job done that no one else dare tackle. Patton demonstrates his passion, his destiny and never lets fear challenge it.

1645652,5,B00005PJ8O,"What a truly excellent film! I remember seeing 'Patton' some years ago for the very first time and being instantly struck by how great it was. The movie inspired me to read as much material on General George S. Patton as I could. Patton the man and the film our two of my favorite things.

George C. Scott really had the role of a lifetime here. He does not fumble the opportunity. He nails the part to perfection. One of the only differences between the two men was that Patton had a higher pitched voice. As his biographer Carlo D'Este once said, ""Patton would have loved to have a voice like George C. Scott's."" Scott's Patton is funny, mean, tough, fair, and moving. His portrayal of Patton's rage at the battle fatigued soldier is excellently played as is his stunned reaction at being put in the doghouse. His admission for his love of war over a smoking battlefield is a classic. Scott is great and he carries the picture. Karl Malden is a good foil for Patton as the legendary Omar Bradley. His Bradley seemed to me to be a little nicer than the actual Bradley was but it works for the movie. Oddly, Eisenhower is not depicted in the movie but his presence is felt throughout.

You are riveted by this film from the beginning to the end. The entrance of Scott at the opening of the movie is one of the great introductions to a movie character in all of cinema.

The DVD contains good picture and sound plus some interesting documentaries especially the 'History vs. Hollywood' that explains some of the creative licenses that were taken in the film.

1645656,3,B00005PJ8O,"Patton, 1970 film

The film begins with a huge 48 star flag and the general saluting. He wears many rings and medals, and two ivory-handled revolvers. He gives a speech on the need for winning. ""America will never lose a war."" [Was this from an actual speech?] They show North Africa, the Kasserine Pass in 1943 Tunisia. People scrounge for goods among the battlefield. Major General Bradley looks over the area to check the reports. He needs a tough tank commander to do better. Patton arrives to inspect the soldiers. The American forces had inferior equipment (no mention of less experience). Patton plans on more discipline for the soldiers.

An air attack provides drama. Where is the air cover? A message tells of a planned attack by Rommel. [The British broke the German code and could plan ahead.] The Americans dig in to await the attack. [No air cover? The battle scene is staged to minimize the number of actors.] The Americans and British win. Where will they attack next? Patton has a plan to take Palermo in a flanking attack. He offers his respects to the Cardinal (he knows politics). Patton wants another attack behind enemy lines so he can capture Messina first. Later he visits an Army hospital and slaps a patient who appears to be unwounded. [In fact that soldier was suffering from malaria.] The Allies parade through Messina. Ike orders Patton to apologize for slapping a soldier; he does so.

In Corsica Patton pays tribute to the Free French forces under Generals De Gaulle and Le Clerc. Ike has to fight the enemy and keep the allies together. Patton will take part in a deception designed to draw German forces to the Pas de Calais. Did he insult our Russian allies? [Are there forces out to get Patton?] Patton is given command of the 3rd Army for a flanking attack. Bradley explains the strategy to Patton, the target is the rockets launched against London. Patton notices the use of carts by the Germans, their end is near. [A shortage of oil and gasoline.] The Battle of the Bulge halts their advance. Patton's forces race to Bastogne to attack the enemy. Will prayer help? Clear weather brings air cover. Patton is cool at a victory celebration. What will he say? Does he guard his tongue? Is he out of his mind? [Did somebody think he outlived his usefulness?] ""All glory is fleeting.""

After four decades I note how this film is padded to fill out its three hours. This is one film that isn't as impressive as when first seen. Did this film try to improve Patton's image? George C. Scott refused to accept his award for this film. Scott later starred in a sequel that provided another view of Patton but it wasn't as successful. People like a movie with a happy ending that makes them feel good. Your opinion may vary. This film glides over Patton's reactionary politics and presents him as a colorful character.

Over the years, better DVD transfers of this film keep coming out and now we have a great Blu-Ray version. It just gets better and better!

How much of this story is fact and how much is fiction, I don't know. Knowing Hollywood and knowing when this was made - during the heyday of the anti-war (Vietnam) movement - I have my suspicions but  WWII buffs I've talked to pretty much  back up this film.  Whatever political bias a filmmaker might have, Patton made for a good movie subject anyway and the story is interesting all the way, thanks to the acting of George C. Scott, who was astounding as Patton. He gives us one of the more memorable performances ever by an actor.

Not only is Scott's acting superb, the widescreen photography is also good. Thank goodness DVDs came out so films like this could be seen in the aspect ratio in which they were filmed.  As for special-effects, the explosions and machine-gun fire was realistic, especially for a film that is now approaching 40 years old.

1645668,5,B00005PJ8O,"should consider viewing this classic movie.  The subject of the movie, George Patton, is a hero to many, but is also unpopular with some, as he was unapologetically pro-American rather than internationalist, and he took political incorrectness to the level of an art form.  Patton remains a controversial figure.

George C Scott, in a brilliant performance, brings Patton to life in this inspiring film.  The script, written by Francis Ford Coppola, features the famous beginning scene of Patton giving a speech to his men.  Also highlighted are Patton's penchant for flamboyant uniforms, his strongly religious side, his avid reading of military history, his acts of brazen boldness in the face of adversity (such as standing in the open and shooting at a plane straffing his postion with a handgun), and his ongoing run-ins with the officers above him whom he views as mere politicians.

The action sequences are perhaps a bit dated and unconvincing in terms of realism, which is unfortunate as a sense of verisimilitude would have allowed a more vivid contrast between Patton's enthusiasm for battle with the real life horrors of combat.

This film is inspirational, especially now.  WWII was a very difficult time for America, and Patton took the challenges on with enthusiasm and verve, his ivory handled revolvers blazing all the way.",1236384000,,1340,5.142857142857143

1645674,5,B00005PJ8O,"In 1970, two films juxtaposed each other. ""Patton"" was an unlikely winner of eight Oscars. The pacifist Scott for all practical purposes took his Buck Turgidson character and refined him into the real-life Patton. In interviews, Scott said he found his research of Patton revealed an unbalanced man, but on screen Scott nailed him as the vainglorious, brilliant, driven warmonger he was. Steiger was offered the role first but turned it down because it glorified war. Vietnam was absolutely at its apex. It was very surprising that Hollywood would make such a film at that time. But director Frankin Schaffner had served under Patton, and after making ""The Planet of the Apes"" had the clout to call his shots. The film did not get America behind the war, but it did cause Nixon to start bombing Cambodia because the Patton story convinced him to get tough. The screenwriter, oddly enough, was Francis Ford Coppola, who may have done himself a turn. Coppola was no war lover, and wrote ""Patton"" as a man obsessed with war (""God help me, I love it so""), deluded by visions of Napoleonic grandeur mixed with Episcopalian Christianity and karmic reincarnation. The intent may have been to show a psychotic military man, to de-mask his heroism, and this may have been what prompted Scott to play it. From page to screen there are virtually no changes, but if Coppola was trying to put down the military by showing Patton's human warts, the result was a brilliant work that now is one of, if not the most, conservative pictures ever made. Watching ""Patton"" stirs wonderful pride in two countries (Great Britain is prominent in the film) that were tough enough to stand up to the Nazis when the rest of the world cowered in victimhood. Karl Malden's Omar Bradley is Patton's perfect foil, as is the Bernard Law Montgomery character. The film saved Coppola, who was about to be fired as ""The Godfather"" director. When he won the Oscar for ""Patton"", it gave him too much clout to get the axe.",1233878400,,1983,4.767441860465116

1645684,4,B00005PJ8O,"First let me say that I loved the acting and George C. Scott provided one of the greatest acting performances in a film.  However, this movie is flawed, fatally flawed, when it comes to the real Patton.  Yes, much is true, but much is from the perspective of a man, that we now know since his death and the availability of his writings, hated Patton.  That person was the technical consultant on this movie and his name is General Omar Bradley.  Without wishing to get into arguments on whom was right or wrong in a given situation since they were both typical generals and therefore prim a donas, the one-sided perspective in this movie always leaves a bad taste in my mouth. For example, Bradley hated Montgomery as much as Patton and would speak it but we never see this in the movie since Bradley evidently thought it would make him look bad.  If Patton disagreed with Bradley while under his command, he would suck it up while Bradley was known to complain to Eisenhower and Alexander about Patton.  Bradley was simply wrong about Patton's actions in Sicily.  Given the constraints Monty put him under, Patton did a remarkable job of trying to kill Germans as much as possible and limit their escape from the island.  And as we know, most of the German army escaped intact from Sicily.  At the Bulge, both Eisenhower and Bradley were caught with their pants down and instead of harping on that, Patton was ready to go with a plan that helped turn the battle into a huge Allied victory.  Patton was a meticulous planner who never sacrificed the lives of his troops for personal glory despite what the movie tries to indicate (once again Bradley's opinion).  Patton understood that the quicker the war ended, the less men would die.",1225756800,,1735,4.637254901960785

1645692,1,B00005PJ8O,"I have to agree with the very few that have called Fox on its despicable job with the picture quality on Patton.

I give the film four stars  (in case you were thinking i'm just being mean and unhelpful) and the Blu-ray one. In case you didn't red those others (and there should be MANY more critical reviews of this movie's quality), here it is in a nutshell.

You've been duped.

Oh no it isn't great picture quality. The remaster is AWFUL.

Have you heard of DNR, or Digital Noise Reduction? Film has grain. 70mm film has less noticeable grain due to its large negative size. The thing is, picture detail cannot be separated from the grain and the chemical reaction when the film is exposed.

Because people want to see things looking 'clear' and 'high-def' like HD video and digitally originated cg/3d movies, the studios are 'scrubbing' the pictures electronically to get rid of the grain. They also use a technique called 'edge enhancement' to artificially sharpen the picture by increasing areas of high contrast like edges. So what you get is a halo effect around the edges, and/or LOSS of fine details because when you erase the grain, you erase the high-frequency detail. Detail on chemical film is inseparable. Look at Karl Malden - where are the pores of his skin? HD, and certainly the original 70mm film, is capable of showing this. Now go and look at Patton again. Just atrocious. You've been robbed and don't even know it. Compare it to another 'war' movie, Blackhawk down. THAT's detail and picture quality. Yes Patton is older, but it was shot on 70mm and there should be plenty of detail so you can actually compare the two differently aged films.

Look at Jennifer Connelly's face in Hulk where you can see pores and fine hair, peachfuzz and so on. Then look at something like the Dark City BD, where it's been erased (even though she's younger there!). In Sweeney Todd, the worst thing is they only applied the DNR around the nose and cheeks/under the eyes. See how 'blurred' it looks! They didn't even put grain back over the top to match the rest of the picture - and the most ridiculous thing of all is that in Sweeney Todd Depp and Carter are SUPPOSED to look drawn and tired and lined! It's just ludicrous! And they DON'T do it to other characters! Look at Depp's face in the Pirates movies. THAT'S what you should be seeing, colour grading and tone aside.

I won't even start on how many filmmakers use coarser grain to make the tone/film literally more 'gritty'. On purpose.

DNR is the devil, to be melodramatic about it. I'm not buying Patton on BD until they 'fess up and 'unfix' the thing. HD and Blu-ray are supposed to let you see a film as ACCURATELY to the original as possible. Not this rubbish.",1222819200,,2732,4.581967213114754

1645696,2,B00005PJ8O,"First let me start off by saying that I think Patton is one of the greatest movies ever.  This is a review of the blue-ray disc and it's over use of DNR (Digital Noise Reduction).  The source elements for this movie where shot on 65mm film, so the image should exhibit a very fine grained texture to it.  The DNR has made the movie look exceedingly clean to the extent of looking like digital video rather than film.  This has caused a softness and lack of detail in the movie.

Want an example?  Go to time code 11:59, it shows a wide shot of a battlefield with a dog in the center left.  The dog leaps forward, but he halts and jerks back in midair for no reason.  The reason for this is the dog is teathered by a leash.  It's been virtually erased from the film by ""cleaning it up with DNR"".  In a still frame you can barely discern a thin line attached to the dog.  Yes you should see the dog leash, watch your old dvd copy.  The blue ray might look good on a small screen but as you go up in screen size more of these problems stand out.  This disc doesn't represent the movie's photography and doesn't live up to blue-ray's potential.  Film is a medium that the movie artist paints his creation on.  With DNR they can change the medium and thus change the movie.

I hope that maybe they will see thier mistake and pull this blue-ray and give us one from the source.",1221609600,,1371,4.175572519083969
1645697,5,B00005PJ8O,"This is one of the very, very few great Hollywood movies about historical events and personalities in which hardly any liberties or revisionist history attempts have been made and yet the unadulterated ""true"" story is still so dramatic and exciting.  This movie is fully deserving of all 8 of the Oscars that it won and is not only among the top 5 war movies that I've ever seen but is also among the top 5 biopics that I've ever seen.

Patton is shown, warts and all, with little attempt made at trying to sugar coat his colourful personality although this movie gives us a chance to see the other side of the story that we get of the man from the sensationalist press of the time.  Having served in the military myself, I actually fully appreciated what he did to the cowardly soldier and I know I wouldn't have apologised if it was me but Patton saw the bigger picture and knew that he was needed to continue achieving greater things and so did what he had to which really impressed me.  Although the film is almost 3 hours in length, I didn't feel it as that movie is just that good.

As for the DVD, the picture and sound quality is just excellent.  The THX Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround option makes the sound quality very good and I couldn't easily find any imperfections with the picture quality making me thoroughly satisfied with this dvd version.  Although there are no special features worth mentioning, the picture and sound quality more than make up for this.  I can only imagine how much better the Blu-ray version of this film will be given that it is already so good on this standard version.  I also appreciated the Anamorphic widescreen effect which ensured that only about a fifth of my widescreen was blacked out unlike the pure letterbox format which means I'd have to squint as only half my screen is utilised.  I understand that different people have different opinions about the various formats but for me anamorphic works well enough.

This is a great movie and the dvd is equally as good; great film, great picture and sound quality albeit no special features save an audio essay on Patton's life still make this a great value purchase.

Recommended.

Updated 6 June 2011:

As Amazon will not let me review this separately, I'll have to append this here:  the blu-ray version of this great film is certainly worth the double-dip.  As good as the picture quality was on the dvd I reviewed above, 1080p actually improves upon it on this version.  The sound quality in DTS HD 5.1 surround is excellent too and is also an improvement over the dvd.  The special features aren't much to shout about and is not an improvement over that of the dvd but the combined improvement of both the picture and sound qualities makes this a worthy upgrade.

I recall one political commentator who solemnly pronounced that George Patton admired Frederick the Great and quoted him often. Then the political commentator quoted Frederick the Great as saying ""Audacity, more audacity, always audacity.""
Indeed, in this very movie there is a scene where George C. Scott says some such thing to an American general whom Patton is trying to motivate to advance across Sicily in the face of an expected Nazi counterattack.
If you go back to the Ladislas Farago book from which the ""Patton"" screenplay was written, the same byplay is there.
The only trouble is, it couldn't have happened that way.
Frederick the Great didn't say it.
And Patton didn't particularly revere the Prussian.
A quick check of Bartlett's ""Familiar Quotations"" places the quote (originally, ""Il nous faut de 'laudace, encore de l'audace, toujours de l'audace"") in the mouth of George Jacques Danton, who on 2 Sept. 1792 was the minister of defense, addressing the French legislative assembly. The situation was that the Austrians were at the gate, threatening to overturn the French Revolution.
Frederick the Great had been dead six years.
Patton was raised as a bilingual American living part of the time in France and was an acknowledged expert on European military history. It is ludicrous to imagine that he would have made such an error.
A quick review of the book, ""The Patton Papers,"" will reveal that Frederick is mentioned exactly three times -- twice in a list of eighteenth century military leaders, and once in a paragraph that says Frederick's reputation relies mostly upon his invention of the ""oblique manuever,"" which Patton said was due to be invented anyway.
We mention this not because we don't like the movie (we really like it) but because one must be careful to check one's facts before one makes broad sweeping statements.

Also because we believe that those who cannot remember their history are doomed to misquote it.",1197590400,,2122,5.028409090909091
1645712,5,B00005PJ8O,"War certainly does not take a holiday vacation. It is well to remember that one of the key battles of World War 2 (The Bulge) came during pre Christmas, 1944. It could easily have been George Patton's finest hour. This strange, enigmatic leader set two goals for himself-total victory and total self aggrandizement. Brilliantly portrayed by George C. Scott (who refused the Oscar), Patton seemed from the outset to do things his way, as he had in overcoming dyslexia. He came from a moneyed California family and was most certainly not accustomed to being told what to do. His learning in tank warfare helped revolutionize the corps itself. When war came, Patton was certainly ready for it. But is warfare really ever ready for the George Pattons of the world? Indeed, the Nazis respected him more than many Americans. This reviewer certainly cannot see Patton succeeding under President Truman, nor any other Europeaan chieftain except Eisenhower. In any event, ""Patton"" is certainly filmaking at its best, even if the subject matter may not be.",1196380800,,1046,5.017241379310345

George C. Scott & Karl Malden

Patton was a unique individual--he was not controlled by politically correct thought or language. He was a brilliant general feared by the Nazis. After WW II, he wanted to go to war with Russia while America's armies were still in Europe after WWII. He called them mongrels and predicted that they would be the next threat. No one listened to him. He got into trouble for speaking his mind, and after he died, the Cold War set in leading to Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, etc.  Watch this movie and learn that not all things can be solved with politically correct thought, speech and loving thy neighbor when your neighbor does not deserve to be loved. This movie won eight Academy Awards. I also recommend the sequel, The Last Days of Patton with George C. Scott. Read my review of that movie. George C. Scott did a masterful job of bringing this bigger than life individual to the screen.",1190505600,,919,4.597560975609756

This is no glossed over version on his life but all the warts and faults of the man are shown and you still walk away eternally grateful that our nation had such a great General when we needed him the most. This movie in no way glorifies war it is almost anti-war movie showing the confusion and horror of war. How any list of the greatest films in film history can exclude this masterpiece from it's list is beyond me. I consider it one of the 25 greatest films ever, maybe Top Ten material.

Scott exceeds all expectations in this role. You get the feeling while watching him that the actor indeed thought he was his character during his time on the set. His Patton is the epitome of passion, desire, will, and honor. Of course, true to life, he was a complicated figure and the film displays this aspect of the man as well. He was vainglorious and rash--attributes often expected, and forgivable in a general. Scott's impressive but so is the script. One of the nice things about this DVD is that Francis Ford Coppola gives a short intro in which he shares that he was the screenplay writer and also fleshes out a few circumstances around the making of The Godfather. His perspective adds to one's appreciation of the film. Patton also has some great action scenes such as the initial battle in the desert against, who he thought was, Rommel.

1645729,5,B00005PJ8O,"Patton is an Academy Award-winning WWII epic that not only holds up exceptionally well after 35 years but also remains the gold standard for  Hollywood biopics. The reason: George C. Scott. The supporting performances are outstanding, as is the Franklin Shaffner direction, the North Africa and Europe locations, the lavish production, the Jerry Goldsmith music and especially the crackling script by Edmund North and Francis Coppola (pre-Godfather). Scott's performance is simply larger than life. The film has been criticized for glorifying Patton -- and glorifying war -- and that's a fair assessment. But I view it more as a biography than a war film. Scott's Patton is not sympathetic -- he's vain, self-absorbed, overbearing, profane, brilliant and part madman.  His perfomance is riveting. Plus, this DVD has some special features that give you a better sense of the real Patton and help gain insight into the film that previously wasn't available of VHS or earlier DVD versions.",1168560000,,986,5.273885350318471
1645730,5,B00005PJ8O,"The war epic was revived with Franklin Schaffner's admirable 'Patton.' Schaffner's control of his film is impressive, and the various campaign sequences are strikingly photographed through an audaciously wide lens...

George C. Scott was commonly referred to as a 'character actor' in view of his remarkably extensive range... Oddly for a character actor, Scott was almost always the same person on screen vigorous to the point of pugnacity, acting with his chin the way other actors do with their eyes-yet revealing, in his own eyes, unsuspected depths of humor and intelligence...

Now few actors have ever been so convincing in such a powerful and colorful character... Only Peter 0'Toole's eccentric T.E. Lawrence comes immediately to mind... Both, he and Scott, create their characters out of complementary contradictions... Lawrence detests the savagery of war but embraces it... Patton cannot separate the conduct of war from his own personal glorification, and both actors are given large canvases upon which to work...

Screenwriters Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North and director Franklin J. Schaffner introduce a 16th-century warrior lost in contemporary times... He is a brilliant and military historian, with a hazardous speech...

Magnificently uniformed, and wearing his ivory-handled pistol, George S. Patton steps up, against a backdrop of the Stars and Stripes, before an unseen gathering of soldiers defining himself in unambiguous terms as a man who revels in war... The scene is cut to a close shot of two scorpions crawling across the body of a dead soldier at the Kasserine Pass, Tunisia... The camera then pulls back to reveal a harsh look at American casualties with dozens of Arabs busily stripping more bodies...

The American Army has just suffered its first defeat at the hands of the Germans... Patton's first job is to restore the morale and discipline of the dispirited troops of his new command... His experience with tanks led General Dwight Eisenhower to place him in charge of one of the three task forces invading North Africa in 1943...

According to his theory of war, Patton would drive all the way to Palermo on the northern coast of Sicily, slicing the island in half... But his finest moment comes during the massive German counteroffensive in the Ardennes... By the time the Germans feared him above all other Allied generals...

Schaffner turns to the Germans for comments on Patton's abilities... They expect him to lead a major invasion... When he was sent to Corsica, the Germans were convinced he would lead an invasion of southern France... When he was sent to Cairo, they feared for an invasion through the Balkans...

Patton is seen reprimanded by Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower for indiscreet political statements... As an able tactician who promotes himself to three-star general before it's officially approved by the U.S. Senate, Patton proves himself as the most effective American field commander of the European war... Behind his audacity lay an imaginative planning and a shrewd judgment... Patton knows that loyalty to a leader would inspire his men to take on objectives against all odds... His strict discipline, toughness, and disregard of classic military rules, contributed to his advance across France and Germany...

The modest and conscientious Omar Bradley, commander of the U.S. 12th Army Group, who had served under Patton in Africa and Sicily as a deputy commander, found Patton to be a superb combat general, but hotheaded, profane, and unpredictable... Bradley ends now as Patton's superior... It was soon apparent that the two make a superb team... Patton's dash and drive in the field is a perfect complement to Bradley's careful planning...

With the help of Bradley, Patton prepares to re-engage German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel... After he defeats Rommel's 10th Panzer Division at El Guettar thanks to his analysis of Rommel's published strategies, he shouts one of the greatest lines in war films: ""Rommel, you magnificent bastard, I read your book!"" At the same time, his rivalry with his Field Marshal Montgomery (hero of El Alamein) becomes more intense... Patton was motivated by a pride to reach his target before his British colleague, sometimes not for the purpose of the Allies...

Karl Malden has the film's only other significant leading role, as the most capable, yet unpretentious general... Malden could be deduced from the number of major directors with whom he has worked... These include Cukor, Hathaway, Kazan, King, Preminger, Milestone, Vidor, Hitchcock, Brooks, Mulligan, Daves, Brando, Frankenheimer, Ford, Quine and Schaffner... In his best and most personal work he has succeeded in exploring depths of moral ambiguity rare in commercial cinema...

Schaffner illuminates various sides of Patton's remarkable personality, presenting a dashing extrovert and attractive general, with a compassionate side...

Touring an evacuation hospital in Sicily, Patton slaps an enlisted soldier twice calling him a 'yellow,' and threatens to shoot him, before two men forcibly remove him from the tent... The incident occurs because Patton's views of bravery and cowardice are so severely limited... The fighting general who has the imagination to write poetry and to believe that he has been reincarnated, in ancient Greece, at Carthage, and Moscow, cannot conceive of a psychological wound that he cannot see... The incident occurred after he prays at the bedside of one man severely injured... Patton whispers some words in his ear which the audience doesn't hear, then lays a medal on his pillow and gives him a gentle touch on his head... The portrait is so compelling that it's easy to overlook Patton's own final words in the film, ""All glory is fleeting.""

Franklin J. Schaffner's motion picture reveals an effective portrait of three men: Patton, Bradley, and the unseen Dwight Eisenhower... The film is a fine epic about 'a pure warrior, and a magnificent anachronism,' who loved war...

The Academy Awards saluted 'Patton' capturing eight Oscars, including best picture, best director, best actor (Scott declined his well deserved Oscar), best screenplay, best editing, and best production design...",1168473600,,6203,5.302443991853361

1645732,3,B00005PJ8O,"I have always loved the movie ""Patton"".  It is a true classic and a treasure in cinema.  I give 3 stars to this special edition because of the following reasons. I cannot understand why 20th Century Fox chose to add the Documentary ""Ghost Corp"" which seems to want to imply that Patton abandoned the XX Corp and particularly the 94th Infantry deliberately with no reason.  Horrible incidences happen in war, this one happened because Patton was on his way north to fight a little annoyance called THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE!, also he was going to rescue the 101st Airborne surrounded by German Forces at Bastogne from being ANNIHILATED!. In the documentary ""The making of Patton"" there is a clip from Oliver Stone stating that the movie ""Patton"" was responsible for Nixon invading and bombing Cambodia, which, according to Oliver Stone, forced the Khmer Rouge to kill millions of Cambodians.  He states that only two movies he knows of ever influenced history; ""Patton"" and of course his movie ""JFK"".  Naturally his (Oliver Stone)'s movie was in a good way.  ""Patton"" just caused destruction and death.  My view of this is that 20th Century Fox wanted to be politically correct and shield itself from anyone anywhere at anytime thinking that they would glorify war.  I have never ever heard of a single person thinking seriously that the movie ""Patton"" glorified war. Whoever thought that at Fox is an idiot and obviously does not think much of the audiences' intelligence that watched ""Patton"".  Oliver Stone is simply pitiful. He wishes that he could make a movie that would live in people's hearts like ""Patton"" does.  He will never touch that greatness, his films will never obtain that level of affection in people's hearts. People don't love ""Patton"" because it is a war picture.  We love it because it is great, it resonates in our hearts and it gave us an image of a complex man and the great men around him who sacrificed, bled, and accomplished heroic deeds.  It is positive and gives us hope, unlike the depressing, hopeless, and disposable garbage that Oliver Stone puts out.",1167955200,,2084,4.83943661971831

I didn't know where Bastogne was or what it was, but later on after he passed away in 1999 I began to have a greater appreciation for what the men of 'The Greatest Generation' did, and I learned about Bastogne.

I look up to any man who can look the enemy in the eye and not flinch.  This is a great movie.  Although by modern standards (Saving Private Ryan, and Band of Brothers) the action and special effects are somewhat dated, but the story is timeless.  It also has some great extras.

1645735,5,B00005PJ8O,"Unfurling from the famous scene showing Gen. George Smith Patton (1885-1945) delivering his rah-rah-troops sermon before the gigantic awe-inspiring American flag, this 1970 film is a wonderful character depiction of a complicated hero. Always true to his ideals, which include his self-confessed inability to keep his ""big mouth shut,"" he incurred the wrath of his good buddy ""Ike"" and Omar Bradley, brilliantly played by Karl Malden (b. 1912).

Patton was also feared but ultimately revered by his soldiers, as well as arch-enemy Erwin Rommel, ""The Desert Fox."" Rommel, in fact, studied Patton's character and was fascinated that Patton wrote poetry and believed in reincarnation.

Unforgettable scenes include Patton ordering the driver of his Jeep to a graveyard in Tunisia. ""There's no graveyard there, sir,"" said his driver. ""There is,"" said Patton. ""I fought there.""

He believed that, in a former life, he was the great Carthaginian general Hannibal, and was saddened by Hannibal's brilliance and loss. As a child, Patton was well versed with bios of military heroes as far back as in the immortal Iliad.

Another memorable scene has the raspy-voiced Patton ordering the Chaplain to pray for good weather. Although a general can motivate his troops only so far, the weather must cooperate - it didn't, Patton confided to the Chaplain, and Napolean lost at Waterloo. Not surprisingly, Patton believed he was one of Napoleon's soldiers. Patton's order of prayer had the lucky coincidence of stopping a snowstorm in its tracks so Patton's Third Army could advance in victory.

In the midst of deadly battle where Patton views himself as utterly invincible, he remarks, ""God, I love it here!"" Every nuance of the noble, arrogant, elitist, insubordinately lovable general is brilliantly portrayed by George C. Scott (1927-1999). At age 43, Scott famously declined his Oscar award for best actor stating the Oscars were nothing but a ""meat market."" Patton, on the other hand, adored the accoutrements of power: his numerous medals and celebratory garments including polished helmet, ivory pistol and riding jodhpurs!

One of the greatest films ever made, with wonderfully little blood and gore, what would the real George Smith Patton think of the ridiculous war raging overseas today in Iraq? Or perhaps he is over there in another carnation. Whose?",1165536000,,2351,5.2727272727272725

1645737,5,B00005PJ8O,"George C. Scott is magnificent as George S. Patton!

Although the movie has some inaccuracies- some of them showing Patton in a less than favourable light- Scott manages somehow to successfully raise the character above them and make us care for, admire and respect the old general, who was in fact a far superior soldier and a far superior man than those who tried- and those who still try- to belittle or criticize him.

George S. Patton said ""It is the unconquerable soul of man, not the nature of the weapon he uses, that insures victory"", and thanks in great part to Scott's portrayal, we see and feel Patton's soul, the soul of a true warrior, which was much needed them, and, I fear, we still do today. Although it is very likely that he would be treated as unfairly today as he was back then, if not more so.

This is a movie worth wachting for many reasons. It may not be precisely a History lesson, but it is certainly is good lesson on what it takes to be a soldier and what it takes to be a man.",1163116800,,1007,4.2894736842105265

In fact, I think it is pretty hard to imagine Patton without Scott's bearing, as he quickly became synonymous with the role, even though he turned down the Oscar at the 1970 Academy Awards.

The film doesn't so much chart Patton's life as it does make him a captivating symbol of American hubris.  Old Blood and Guts is considered by many to be America's greatest war hero, and Schaffner puts Patton on a grand stage.  We see Patton at his most combative, his powerful oratory skills which in many ways voiced American foreign policy, even as political leaders soft pedaled it.  While the movie is definitely not a political tract, it has these undercurrents and is well worth watching again, especially in a time when we see so much bluster and harsh rhetoric coming out of the White House.

This edition shows a bit more of the bottom of the frame, but a bit less of the left side.  This edition's sound is markedly better than the THX edition.  However the THX edition has a MUCH sharper video transfer...the best examples are the details visible in the closeups of Patton's right arm saluting the camera and the medals on his uniform, all at the beginning of the movie.  You can count the hairs on his hand and see many more medal details in the THX edition.  So Fox has yet to put together the definitive video transfer, which will hopefully be corrected when they finally release this in (whichever) high definition format.",1151798400,,984,4.614942528735632
1645744,5,B00005PJ8O,"Join George C. Scott, Karl Malden and a host of others in a high-powered assault of German forces across several countries...  The masterminds behind this script (Francis Ford Coppola) and subsequent movie got it right.  Garnering a host of awards including seven Oscars, including one for best actor (Scott) and best picture, this movie is a detailed depiction of the success and ego of one of the finest generals ever produced by the US Military Academy.

As far as this new Special Edition is concerned, the video transfer wasn't the absolute best, but it certainly wasn't bad.  The audio is pretty awesome in surround sound.  Curiously, the "".1"" (subwoofer) is absent, but really not necessary in my opinion.  At high volume during the war scenes, there is plenty of clarity and the booms are loud but not overbearing.  At the current price of $12.67, I think it's a steal.  George C. Scott does total justice to Patton the man, hands-down the most successful general in WW2.

Sometimes I put the movie in just to watch the intro and then fast-forward to the part where Patton first encounters the ""Desert Fox"" Erwin Rommel...As Patton's forces are kicking the s*&t out of the Nazis, Patton yells ""I read your book!!!"" referring to Rommel's book on tank tactics that the movie shows Patton reading the evening before the engagement (after some investigating, it turns out that no such book was written by Rommel...)

I would only add that this film (and the portrayals within) could only occur because of the correct recipe for success.

The locations and supporting roles were tempered just right to showcase the center. The action was also used as a backdrop and not a centerpiece.

And Jerry Goldsmith's score could not have been better. John Williams is a master himself but Jerry to me has always done best capturing the ""soul"" of a centrally themed character like Gen. Patton or Daniel ""Rudy"" Rudiger. I can hear the haunting echoes across the Roman battlefields of North Africa and the jaunty sound of convoys moving accross Italy even as I type this.

How rare to find a biopic that knowing it cannot remain perfectly true to events and circumstances without becoming a documentary; still managers to capture the essence and soul of the subject. Kudos to all for such a masterpiece of writing, acting, direction and production!

I am so pleased that Patton continues to be improved and re-released as process improvements become available and new commentaries are recorded.

I am not personally but I can attest to the excellence of this film probably because I viewed ""Patton"" more as a character study than as a war film per se.  For sure director Franklin J.Schaffner stages the war footage magnificently.  Where this film succeeds is twofold.  Firstly in the terrific script by a young Francis Ford Coppola and a later assist by Edmund North.  By focusing on George S. Patton and explaining the contradictions that were the man Coppola and North have crafted a portrait of a warrior whose actions would deceive you into thinking he was a warmonger.  Secondly you have an absolutely spellbinding performance by George C. Scott.  Scott has you mesmerized throughout and your eyes never leave him despite the bombast that surrounds him.  For sure Scott demonstrates the maverick side of the man but he is equally effective in the quieter pensive side of Patton.  Do yourself a favor and listen to the commentary track by Coppola.

its a fantastic  testament to a man, who might have been considered a raving  lunatic by people today..  The film shows in great detail about the man and not just about the second world war.  patton shows us the human side of the ""only general that the axis powere truly feared""  this movie grabs your attention from the start (with that excellent speach in front of that HUGE american flag)  and it never lets go..you get drawn into it..you get to see how one of the worlds greatest generals was

..granted its hollywood, but it was adapted from great works, by pattons second general and friend  omar bradly that book being ""a soldiers story"" a great read..and ""patton ordeal and triumph""  another great read  which you can get here on amazon i bet:)

this film goes into how he thinks and what he truly feels..remember, he believed in reincarmation.. and  he believed in taking military action..by reading the books of his enemy to see how they thought and used that knowledge gained against them..remember..know your enemy..( he read rommel's books on the tank in attack during the africa campaign..and then later was reading the history of the norman conquest, as well as the works of ceaser, and many more..he was a 16th  century warrior trapped in contempory times..being the 1940,s)

  when patton talked, he gave it to his people nice and dirty..that way they would remember it..he carried  ivory pistols, wrote poetry, was deeply religious (loved the scene where he demanded a weather prayer...thats classic) and lets not forget driving general eisenhower crazy i bet  with his antics  including the soldier slapping incident,  which i have to say  was not the smartest thing to do  but i understand why he did it..that soldier was just ""shell shocked"" thats all...where other soldiers were dying and god knows worse  patton was just trying to  give him wake up call to do his duty. but the press did not see it that way..

George c scott. is a great actor,  you can tell he was born to play general patton! this is without a doubt the greatest role of his  career  i can see why this film won 7 academy awards and the best picture...it deserves it!

this film is lavishly, produced with filming done in various european nations, as well as europe. this film is a feast for they eyes..its well acted, well produced..and most importantly well written..which sometimes hollywood these days seems to forget...  the dvd is fantastic  packaging and all,  you get a excellent digital copy, booklet, and tons of extras  such as the making of,  documentaries, and much more..and lets not forget the trailer...

well done!  thank you 20th century fox for this masterpiece",1148515200,,2896,4.738955823293173

Patton's grasp of the Russians' imperial intentions was legendary, and one wishes that he had been President instead of Roosevelt. The newspapers could not see this, and merely attacked Patton for ""Insulting our Russian allies."" Had Patton ruled, perhaps Poland and the other eastern European nations would not have been betrayed to the Soviet Union.

1645754,5,B00005PJ8O,"Arguably one of the finest war movies ever produced by Hollywood.  George C. Scott was Patton--he wasn't just portraying the man.  Whether you liked the guy or not, he put in a fine performance in this movie.  Producers said they knew of no one else who could ""be"" Patton like Scott was.  They got that right.  His uncanny resemblance to Patton was no accident.  Scott worked long and hard to be as close to the real thing as he could. What wasn't there naturally, imaginative makeup provided. The primary departure from the real Patton was Scott's gruff voice, quite different from Patton's real voice. Patton had a rather high, some call it a squeaky voice.  This surprises most people when they hear the real guy in a film clip after seeing the movie.  Patton's real voice was almost comical and he always included humor in his public speeches which made him sound genuinely ""comedic"" at times.  In interviews, Scott acknowledged he was not fond of Patton as a person or as a general, nor war in general, and he abhorred any glorification of war.  Remember this film was made near the end of the most unpopular encounter in Vietnam when war protestors were influencing national policy, if not actually making it.  Many in Hollywood were quite publicly outspoken about their opposition to the war.  After reluctantly, at first anyway, accepting the role, Scott put his all into a realistic and accurate recreation of the General as a person and a senior leader during WWII.  He was a perfectionist of sorts.  That won him an Academy Award which he refused to accept.  I have not heard or read if portraying Patton improved Scott's opinion of the man and the general or not.  That is probably documented somewhere, but I haven't found it yet.  Whether he noticed the similarity with his rebellious nature, by almost turning down the role and subsequently refusing the Oscar, to that often exhibited by Patton is up for conjecture.  He reportedly read any and all books he could put his hands written by or about Patton and he watched thousands of feet of film clips about the real Patton over and over to perfect his portrayal.  He succeeded masterfully.

Patton was a genuine hero to many,  and friend and foe alike, in all fairness, have often acknowledged that.  Many senior German leaders who survived the war and the post-war trials acknowledged Patton as the most feared and competent general in the allied forces.  That may or may not be a compliment depending on one's perspective. Patton was unfortunately, at least where his career was concerned, outspoken, opinionated, and a generally unpleasant person at times.  Some of his troops idolized him, others despised him.  There were only a few in between or without any opinion one way or the other.  Bradley supposedly once called Patton a real pain in the neck to his face.  Bradley was noted for his lack of the use of profanity, so it is usually accepted that he used the term ""neck"" instead of the usual location of such ""pains"".  Patton was often a real embarrassment and burden to Eisenhower in spite of their very close personal friendship in the pre-war Army.  Eisenhower recognized that Patton was virtually indispensable in helping win the war. That is a whole other complicated and controversial story in itself.  Other times Patton was the consummate gentleman and he could be the refined host, companion, and scholarly conversationalist his upper class upbringing  implied he should be.  It is generally thought his inherited wealth was a reason for his rebellious nature since he didn't have to worry about making a living.  I have never found a source that says Patton ever held his wealth over those less fortunate than he, but he did enjoy the better things in life.  He spent literally thousands on uniforms and other accouterments important to his self-image.  He truly thought he had a destiny to fulfill, and often stated to those close to him that he loved it so, referring to war in general.  He was convinced he had something great to accomplish on the battlefield.  He put his all towards that quest.  He was very well read although he didn't learn to read until he was almost in his teens.  There is conjecture, not without some evidence, that he was dyslexic.  His grandson stated we will probably never really know for sure.  Beyond the novelty of discussing his learning challenges, he overcame whatever and became a prolific reader especially of history, most often military history, covering most recorded historical events over the centuries of any import.  He was a believer in reincarnation and it is still debated whether this came from all his reading and familiarity with past heroic figures or he genuinely believed that he had lived other lives at other times.  He was a self-made poet and was an able athlete especially in individual pursuits like fencing, horseback events, pistol shooting and other disciplines.  His grandson said once that he was less proficient in team related sports.  He participated in the 1912 Olympics and finished a respectable fifth in his event.  His military leadership style was much like that.  He was independent, he bucked authority, though he would not tolerate that from his subordinates, and he did it his way often to his detriment with his bosses.  Many detractors feel his style was to the detriment of his troops lives also.  The movie accurately portrays the varied emotions and attitudes the real Patton exhibited.  The often tender emotions he showed with the wounded and the opposite often tyrannical outbursts such as the slapping incidents.  Incidentally, there were actually two slapping incidents within a few days of each other while the movie combines the two into just one event.

The movie, like all products out of Hollywood, took many liberties with the facts.  It combined certain points and places in time, often out of context with the real events and timelines. It skipped over other events, while ignoring many completely in the interest of time and continuity, and some facts and events were manufactured by Hollywood.  The funeral for his aide killed in battle didn't happen at all like the movie depicted, though he did actually cut a lock of the Captain's hair and sent it to his mother with a poignant letter.  All told, however, the movie was relatively historically accurate and gave a fair picture of the real Patton.  Anyone who's read some or all of the many books written by and about Patton, can discern for themselves what is real, what is distorted and what is outright in error.  Those who haven't read or studied Patton won't care anyway and are in it solely for the entertainment.  It serves no purpose here to recite all of that which is right or wrong ad nauseam.  Many fine and some lesser reviewers here have already done that better than I could anyway.

I am an amateur historian of sorts with a fascination with the wars of the 20th Century.  I have read a lot and forgotten even more than I would like to admit about WWII and Patton in particular.  I'm an old man now.  Boohoo for me, LOL. I have a collection of war movies and documentaries on DVD and old VHS tapes numbering well over 600. Whoopee for me you say.  I am NOT an expert by any stretch of the imagination.  I am, however, satisfied that the movie was as true to Patton and the facts as is necessary to get an overview of the man, his mission and his destiny--the stated purpose of the film originally.  In addition, it is fine entertainment for those who couldn't care less about historical facts.  In this day and age of revisionist historians, it can be very confusing to try to figure out what to believe and what to ignore.  I think those with a novice interest in war history, and the figures who participated in it and made that history, will find this film to be rewarding, and it will possibly kindle the need to seek out more about what supposedly ""really"" happened.  There are probably only a few of us old folks left who haven't seen this film by now and either liked it or didn't.  Younger people who want to learn about their predecessors and what happened to create the world we live in today would be well served to see this film.  It is hard to imagine that there are many who wouldn't enjoy this movie if only as entertainment, but then there are an infinite number of opinions on what is worth watching and what isn't.  Point is, I recommend this film highly.  I think it is a classic for the ages especially where war films are concerned. The film is must have in any serious war movie collection.

1645755,5,B00005PJ8O,"People might criticize George C. Scott for his total immersion into, and his passionate portrayal of the character of George Patton--sometimes at the expense of the other actors appearing in the same scenes. However, this great movie is about the man, General Patton; it is not about an event during World War II, like Pearl Harbor, D-Day, or the saving of Private Ryan. It would be only natural for Scott to dominate the film.

Even so, there is something about this movie that does work on a grand scale. The battle sequences, although at times historically inaccurate, are absorbing and gripping nonetheless. Patton's strategies are beyond reproach. His unflinching courage, as dive bombers take aim at him, as gunners shoot at him, as a plane falls in flames just over his head, are cinematic testimony to this perfect general.

Fortunately, the filmmakers also show us the man warts-and-all. He was a media manipulator. He also manipulated his own superiors when he sought fame and glory. He was totally self-absorbed and defiantly impatient.

There are better World War II movies out there, undoubtedly. But any collection of WWII films that omits this movie is woefully incomplete. This is a great movie that deserves to be purchased.",1145836800,,1241,5.04390243902439

Scott was larger than life when he lived among us and so was George S. Patton. The casting for this movie could not have been better. It tells the story of this ""magnficent bastard"" (as he refers to Gen. Rommel) as well as it ever could be told.

In watching the movie, Scott truly becomes Patton. You can feel the metamophosis.

There is nothing pretty about war, however this movie can make it uplifting while peering into the bowels of the beast. Those who fight the war are mere mortals, even though they may not believe that at the time.

For wars to be won...the generals sometimes have to be a bit mad. Count Patton among those, but do not dismiss his brilliance which Scott captures.

You can do as I have done and just wait for cable to run this picture which it does a lot. Or you can remove the wait and buy the DVD. To have George C. Scott on the end of my leash is both comforting and empowering.

1645758,5,B00005PJ8O,"Patton was the best war movie of the 70's.  This film deals with Patton's career during WWII.  It begins with his Africa campaign and takes it through Italy and ends in Germany at the conclusion of the WWII.

This film shows both Patton's brilliance as a general and his flaws of as a man.  Patton's was a man of passion and was more interested in what was most effective than what was politically correct (as in office politics not social politics).  His career is shown against his good friend Omar Bradley's career.  Bradley followed the rules and advanced quickly and surpassed the maverick Patton.

George C Scott was a leading actor on stage but until Patton he was only a featured performer in movies.  This raw performance made Scott the first choice for these types of roles in the future (but he was better at comedy!)

Karl Malden was already a star and Oscar winner but his performance of the by the books general lead him to a successful TV sereies.

This is a well made film and for many involved was their finest hour.  One thing most people who are into film music unanimously agree is that Jerry Goldsmith's score was one of the greatest film scores ever.

This is a well balanced film and well made.

1645760,4,B00005PJ8O,"The version of the movie on VHS and on DVD differs from the theatre release in an important respect: the one complete battle scene shown (in north Africa).  The version of the battle in the original movie was designed to show Patton's skill as a field commander, and it illustrated perfectly the tactic which Patton called, ""Hold him by the nose and kick him in the butt.""  This tactic was actually invented by Themistocles in the battle of Salamis in the second Greek war against the Persians.  It involves faking a frontal assault, then faking a rapid retreat to lure to enemy into a careless attack, then launching a surprise attack on the enemy from the side.  Each step of this tactic was illustrated in the movie: Patton's tanks attacked, then stopped and rapidly pulled back.  Seeing that, the Germans rushed forward full speed, not seeing Bradley laying behind a bank on the side.  Bradley then attacked.  Patton's tanks stopped and rushed forward again in attack.  The Germans were being hit from two sides, an untenable position.  They were severely damaged and those that remained retreated.

Obviously, some later film editor was afraid the public would regard it as cowardice for the American tanks to stop and pull back as though running away.  This editor completely butchered the battle scene until all you have is a mishmash of explosions, cannons firing, etc.

It is too bad that filmmakers and editors think the American public is so stupid that they won't be able to follow the logic of this classic battle tactic.  As far as I know, at the time the film was released, no one mistook the import of this scene.",1127692800,,1629,4.754448398576512

1645762,4,B00005PJ8O,"PATTON is really two films. An epic war masterpiece by director Franlin J. Schaffner and an intense character study of one of America's best and most mysteriuos generlas. Upon it's time of release in 1970 PATTON was the most intense war film to date and im my opinion the best. It's huge and for the most part historically accurate. Winner of 8 Academy Awards icluding Best Picture, Best Director, Best original screenplay, and Best Actor (Scott)PATTON still resonates 35 years later.

Pressed against the odds and facing the Nazi ank general Rommel Patton was the right man for the job. Just the right amount of insanity and genius he helped win the war. He was a very competitive man competing for different assignments and making himself very unlikeable. He believed in reincarnation and destiny. This is not a war film from the point of the soldier like so many made today. It's from the high chain of command. Patton speks waht is on his mind not caring what others think that eventually led to his downfall. The film opens with Patton speaking about war and what he feels that war is. It resonates to the times now in which Patton may have been more socially acceptable now. He says that war is not about dying for your country is about making the other bastard die for his. This happens to be one of the most effective openings in film history, painting the character right before our eyes as almost to say here he is feel free to judge because he won't care. This allows the viewer to think that they know him but Patton crushes through the movie layng out as many surprises as possible.

Directed under the keen eye of Franklin Schaffner Patton is one of the few war films to show scope. To show the vastness and the lonliness of war instead of the claustrophobic feeling that most films portray now. Wide shots of the African dsesrt and viwing battles not from first person, gives the audience a feeling of a foreign land. Scotts perfromance was well deserving of an Oscar.

Despite all the wonderful things about PATTON it still cannot rival a film like APOCALYPSE NOW, THE DEER HUNTER, PLATOON,or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN that raise more important questions of morality and believing what you want to belive despite not having a choice gives other war films morw meaning to the average person. However, PATTON will remain one of the most stunning character pieces ever assembled.",1123977600,,2386,4.70334928229665
1645763,5,B00005PJ8O,"'Patton' is more than a thrill ride, more than a spectacle, more than just your garden variety WWII epic. In addition to the virtuoso acting of George C. Scott -- which somehow never seems to fall into melodrama despite his bombast -- the film explores perhaps better than any other the attraction and the repulsion we feel towards the bloodthirsty glory hound warrior that Patton epitomized. At first blush, we see Patton before the flag in a powerful speech where he is larger than life -- an American counterpoint to Hitler and the awful pomp of the Nazis that seduced millions into evil. Patton surely has the capacity for evil -- note his preoccupation with Napoleon and his putting victory and glory over the blood of his men, and his absolute love of war and destruction. But throughout the film he inspires, cajoles and whips his men into an efficient fighting machine. We are both attracted by this and repelled at the same time. Patton becomes a valuable weapon, but must be muzzled at the end because he does not know how to stop and has no patience for civility. A man like Patton, if he had become president instead of Eisenhower, could have destroyed worlds if it meant his name writ large in the history books. And yet, men like Patton protected and served the country well, and indeed were essential to winning the war.

Like Churchill, Patton was cast off after the war. The people here and in Britain seemed to understand that a far different kind of leadership is needed in peacetime than in war.

***

As for the movie, the war scenes themselves are merely scene-setters rather than scene-stealers the way it would be if it were done today. This isn't the Bridge on the River Kwai or Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor. There are relatively few on-the-battlefield action scenes of consequence, and the soldiers themselves come off not as human beings so much as props for the generals, pieces on a chessboard. But that's all to the well and good. Patton didn't see his men as individuals so much as a means to an end. Because we don't get to know them too closely, it helps us understand, a bit, how Patton was able to spend their lives so easily as he focused on his goals of victory and glory.",1122422400,,2207,4.596446700507614
1645764,3,B00005PJ8O,"""Patton"" although fun to watch because of his portrayal by George C. Scott just does not have the look or feel on World War 2.  First I will mention something about Scott's portrayal of Patton; he is too fat and his voice too deep for the real Patton.  If someone ever has the opportunity to listen to a recording of George S. Patton's voice you'll be struck about how effeminate it sounds.  Of course Scott's waste line also does no justice to the tall and trim Patton but that can be overlooked.  What is hard to overlook is that the film looks too much like the Spanish army on maneuvers than a World War II battle.

Then there are the numerous historical inaccuracies in the film.  The most notable one is where Patton greets Montgomery in Messina.  Didn't happen!  Well I could go on.  For accuracy I would place ""Tora, Tora , Tora"" above Patton.  For fun I'd chose ""Patton.""  But do not use this film as a source for a Master's Thesis.",1122163200,,941,4.381502890173411

1645768,5,B00005PJ8O,"It leaves a lump in the throat even to comment on the brilliance of this movie which will stand the test of time and be still considered 100 years from now as possibly the greatest war movie ever put on film. A big statement maybe but when one considers the brilliance of the casting in this epic everything else becomes self evident. It brought together as possibly none before or since, a great script and an even greater actor who gave the performance of his career and in the process virtually guaranteed the immortality of this film and what it stands for. It told the story of perhaps Americas greatest General who did exactly what he was expected of him namely to fight and die for his country. Patton accomplished this in spades although he never died on the battlefield he well could have numerous times such was his ability to lead from the front and never expect any soldier to do what he would not. I doubt there is another General in Americas history about whom this could be said which is testimony enough to Pattons undoubted legacy. That his country never saw fit to include its greatest General among the 5 Star immortals  was probably due to the fact that he embarrassed both Ike and Roosevelt on several occasions with poor judgement on matters of diplomacy only and certainly not connected to anything he did on the battlefield. That these men could not see beyond their own egos and recognise Patton for what he was and reward him accordingly speaks more for their own deficiencies as it does for Pattons and deprives Americans of according Patton the highest honour which he so rightly deserved. George C Scott played Patton down to his bootstraps and gave as good a performance in portraying patton as Patton himself gave on the battlefield. Quite an achievment by any yardstick. One could even forgive Scott for not accepting the Oscar such was the brilliance of his portrayal. This performance by Scott ranks high among the handful of similar type performances in movie history. One thinks of Hackmans Popeye Doyle, Douglas's Spartacus to name two. Even in this illustrious company Scotts performance must rate at the top such was the sheer believabilty of his effort. Karl Maldens portrayal of Bradley is par excellance and not far below that of Scott. But then when did Malden ever give us a below par performance. Its not in the nature of the man. Had Malden played alongside an actor of lesser talent I believe he would have stolen the credits and rightly so, how often, sadly have we seen similar pairings but that is life and Malden is considered no less of an actor as a result.

They should have went through the years of his life step by step.  How did this thing ever win eight academy awards and win best picture for 1970.  One thing that was really dumb was that they showed the germans talking about Patton and that's all the germans do.  there was barely any war action it was a total waste of film.  I bought it because of what it said on the front cover- eight academy awards and best picture 1970.  What a joke.  One special feature that was put on here was an audio essay.  That was pretty interesting.  This movie also comes in 5.1 sourround sound and that's a good deal for a movie from 1970.

1645770,5,B00005PJ8O,"""Patton"" is an epic saga of one of the greatest generals of all time, a total American, and an imperfect but nonetheless great man.  George C. Scott as General George S. Patton is one of the greatest and best casting decisions of all time.  Scott becomes the general, and the role will forever define Scott, just as Scott's portrayal of General Patton will forever define the General in the minds of most Americans.

This is a wonderful movie about a flawed but great man.  Like many or most American generals, Patton waited the better part of his career for a terrible war to occur, which would call forth all of the years of training and preparation, but mostly waiting, that go into the career of a professional soldier who happens to serve a basically peace-loving country.  Patton believed that he was born to lead great armies in a desperate battle, and this he did.  The film's depiction of Patton when he took over the Vth Corps in North Africa shortly after it took a shellacking from Rommel at Kassarine Pass was absolutely masterful.  Patton took a despirited, green American army there, and shortly, in his words, turned them into ""razors ... fanatics!""  The American Expeditionary Force in North Africa never lost another battle after the brush at Kassarine, and Patton was established in the American mind as a great war general.

The infamous ""slapping incident"" was portrayed painfully but, in the end, according to most historians, accurately.  Patton here is shown to have exercised misjudgment, but even here the discerning viewer will see that this was a misguided attempt by the general to inspirit a flagging soldier.  Scott handled this particular scene perfectly, as indeed he did the entire three hour film.

Perhaps my favorite part of the film is when Patton leads the Third Army's relief of the 101st Airborne at Bastogne.  The British and other allied forces were paralyzed--Patton, having anticipated the possibility of a surprise German winter attack, wheeled several divisions 90 degrees, disengaged from the front, and attacked the advancing Germans in force, which broke the back of the German spearhead and won the Battle of the Bulge for the Americans.  The scene in this film where Scott/Patton ""orders"" an Army Chaplain to ""pray to the Almighty for good weather...I want a good weather prayer..."" is one wonderful scene, juxtaposed against horrendous scenes of combat as the Americans, tired but battle-hardened, advanced.

Patton's difficulties with the press are well done in this film, and one wonders, with today's media the way it is, whether a great general like Patton could survive in our politicized times.  Lord help us when the day comes, as it will, when America needs another Patton.

Scott's portrayal of Patton is one of the greatest character roles ever, and this is a great war film and character study of a great American general.

The musical score by Jerry Goldsmith is a classic, and is one of those scores that greatly adds to the viewing experience of the film.  The DVD is an excellent reproduction of the film, and the sound is recreated/remastered into pretty good Dolby 5.1, which sounded great on my home theater system, if not quite as awesome as some modern films.  This is a great film and the DVD is a great value.",1114560000,,3284,4.893501805054152
1645771,5,B00005PJ8O,"Gen. George S. Patton was an @$$hole. He was also one of the finest combat commanders the US ever produced. He could be extremely loyal, mourn the wounds of his men and at the same time shamelessly spend the lives of those men in pursuit of his own glory. He had a myriad of faults and quirks but he also had some really fine, almost anachronistic qualities. In short, he was a very complex individual. This film depiction does a magnificent job of bringing all of that out.

George C. Scott earned his oscar in this role. He captured the complexity of the man who was George Patton and does so with style and vigor. The warts are there but so is the genius, the charismatic leadership and the thirst for glory.

Carl Malden does no less a job in his portrayal of Omar Bradley, a vastly different type of character than Patton. The two film personalities complement each other as well as the historical ones ever did.

This movie was rightly hailed as a masterpiece. It did not just portray Patton's real achievments. Those were spectacular enough for a movie without all the character study. This film provides more, however. It gives the character study. It gives a glimpse of understanding of the complexities that made up the historical figure. Even more remarkable, it does so in an entertaining manner.",1114041600,,1308,4.653679653679654
1645772,5,B00005PJ8O,"Nominated for ten Academy Awards, and winner of seven including Best Picture, Patton is one of the most inspirational and interesting biographies ever produced on the big screen. Cast in the title role, George C. Scott won the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role, but refused to accept the award because he didn't consider himself in competition with other actors. With brilliant direction, cinematography, visual effects, and an original musical score (by Jerry Goldsmith) - themselves all nominated for Academy Awards - Patton stacks up as one of the best films of all time from any genre...

Patton follows the life of George S. Patton (George C. Scott), famous Allied tank commander from World War II. Beginning with his exploits in North Africa, Patton follows the career of this bombastic general through the D-Day invasion (in which he would act as a decoy), the Battle of the Bulge, and the liberation of Germany. Throughout the process, viewers are privy to the ongoing behind-the-scenes actions of a man famous for his temper and infamous among his peers for his insubordination.

Along the way, Patton must learn to deal with his contemporaries, men such as General Dwight D. Eisenhower, General Omar Bradley (Karl Malden), and Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery (Michael Bates). Despite his display of military genius in the field of battle (garnering the fear of his German enemies), Patton is relieved from his post as Occupation Commander of Germany because of the many faults he exhibits. A military historian who believed he was destined for greatness throughout the ages, Patton loved war. In fact, once the war ended, he died within a few months when he was killed in a car accident...

George C. Scott turns in a memorable performance as the large-than-life Patton. With an overpowering personality and a domineering will, George Patton led his men to victory in one of the most pivotal wars for freedom the world has ever witnessed. Politically-incorrect by every standard of today's measure, the real Patton wouldn't last a minute in today's military. Ironic, because that same military would acknowledge him as one of the greatest generals of its hallowed past! Nevertheless, Patton's legacy endures through our memories and through this film, and the lessons of his life continue to inspire people to this day (people who hopefully use a bit more tact and subtlety in asserting their desires)...

Overall, Patton is a blockbuster film even by today's standards. Despite vast improvements in the realm of filmmaking, Patton (released in 1970) remains unrivaled in its portrayal of one of America's greatest heroes. The battle scenes are especially realistic, and decades before Saving Private Ryan, they vividly illustrated the serious horrors of war. One of the greatest films of the 20th Century, written about one of the greatest figures of the 20th Century, Patton is a definite must-see film for any serious aficionado of movies...

Other than that, yes, the movie is quite well done.

1645774,5,B00005PJ8O,"Starring George C. Scott (Gen. George S. Patton) and Karl Malden (Gen. Omar Bradley), this impeccable war movie describes the impact that General George Patton had on the U.S. Army after 1943.  Following the disaster at Kasserine Pass, in which American armor and strategly was thoroughly outclassed by the Germans, the Americans realized that a new commander was needed to command their armored units.  Patton was chosen, and his impact was felt immediately by the Germans, and he didn't let up until he was relieved by General Eisenhower.

From 1943 until the surrender of Germany in May, 1945, Patton and his vaunted 3rd Army group harassed the Germans from Sicily to France.  He is responsible for driving his group one hundred miles in two days to rescue the trapped 101st airborne troops who were surrounded at Bastogne, and he led his troops on a brilliant drive through France and into Germany itself.

This film does an excellent job of portraying the flamboyant Patton.  His numerous run-ins with his rival British General Montgomery are well-portrayed, and his battles with the press and his American superiors are explained in great detail, as well.  Perhaps the defining scene of the movie is when Patton is visiting a field hospital and he encounters an American private who is suffering from battle fatigue.  Patton slaps the soldier across the face and has him removed from the hospital and sent directly back to the front.  Word of this action eventually got back to Eisenhower, and Patton was made to apologize to the soldier and his entire Army.  This event followed Patton for the rest of his career.

George C. Scott and Karl Malden give excellent performances in their roles as Patton and Bradley.  Scott's portrayal won him an academy award for best actor, while Malden's portrayal of Bradley, the ""soldier's soldier"", is the perfect antithesis to Scott's fiery portrayal as Patton.  The evolution of the friendship and mutual respect that developed between Patton and Bradley is handled extremely well, also.

This is one of the greatest war movies I've seen.  Scott's acting is impeccable, and the historical accuracy, right down to Patton's ivory-handled pistols and his intense hatred for not only the Germans, but the Russians as well, is told with a remarkable flair that will keep the viewer glued to their screen.  I give this movie my highest recommendation.  Watch and see how one man personally changed the course of the war against the Germans.",1107475200,,2479,5.007317073170731

1645778,5,B00005PJ8O,"One of the great movies of the 1970's was ""Patton"" with an outstanding preformance by George C. Scott.  It was a bit controversial at the time because it was shown to a general public that was seriously divided over the on-going Viet Nam War.  For many, the movie represented a glorification of war while, for others, it represented the power of the individual.  It was a favorite of then-President Nixon (which was another mark against it for some).  What it was for most of us was an excellent historical biography that displayed the best that Hollywood had to offer.

There was a lot of technical achievement in the film and it won Oscars for Art/Set Direction, Sound, and Editing while losing out to ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" in the category of Special Visual Effects.  However, the most noteworthy aspect of the film was George C. Scott's title role performance.  He vividly portrays a determined, emotional, passionate man whose quick tongue and temper got him as much time in the dog house as in the spot light.  The movie portrays the dilemna of a brilliant general leading a citizen army.  No problem with the troops but they all had families and congressmen who seemed to have better ideas on how to do things.  Patton, the ultimate warrior, died shortly after WWII.  His portrayal in this movie makes one wonder if that wasn't for the best; who could imagine a peacetime Patton after what he had experienced?

""Patton"" won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Direction (a relatively obscure Franklin Schaffner), Best Writing (Francis Ford Coppola) and, as no surprize, Best Actor.  George C. Scott actually declined the award although without all the hoopola of Marlon Brando.  Karl Malden gives an excellent preformance in his supporting role as General Omar Bradley.

I hadn't seen this movie in many years until just recently.  Frankly, something about it seemed to have lost a bit of its' luster.  However, I watched it so many times back then that I could practically say the lines along with Scott.  More likely it was because the political and military climate had changed quite a bit in the intervening years.  Oddly, maybe this was a movie that was released at just the right time.",1098403200,,2189,4.8203753351206435

Patton, the movie, does not chronicle General George S. Patton Jr.'s entire life, only the last three years, starting from when he landed in Casablanca, Morocco in November of 1942 until relieved of his command of the 3rd Army in October of 1945.  The movie mainly highlights his exploits in the above mentioned countries in WWII.  In North Africa, he and the British General Bernard Montgomery were on the trail of tanks sped along by the German General Erwin Rommel and his Afrika Korps.  Later in Sicily, he and Montgomery raced each other to take Messina fighting the Germans along the way.  During that time, the infamous slapping incident of a soldier occurred which would haunt his career to the end.  Once in continental europe, Patton's 3rd Army would lead a blistering pace to liberate the beseiged city of Bastogne, Belgium, on the border of Luxembourg, and the entrapped U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division on Christmas day.  The movie captures Patton's personality in the military arena, that part of his life that was his heart and soul.  In the movie, he describes himself as a ""combat soldier"", and it is all too clear that he is deeply hurt when benched by his commanding officers to not fight at places like Normandy.  Indeed, it seems he was more hurt and angered by orders not to fight than by orders to answer to his subordinate, General Bradley (Karl Malden), who was promoted to Patton's position.  The story for this movie is based on two books, one written by General Bradley himself; the title for this review is a comment Bradley once made about Patton.  In the movie, the relations between Bradley and Patton (George C. Scott) were always good; General Bradley, in the film, saves Patton's life by pushing him out of the way of a runaway ox cart that finally crashed into a parked jeep, a foreshadowing of how Patton was to die a few months later.  Patton died on December 21, 1945 after having been in a coma for 12 days following an automobile accident in Germany when a U.S. army truck crashed into his car.  This dvd has within it a chronology of Patton's entire life, mentioning his exploits in the first world war and his competing in the 1912 Olympics in the modern pentathlon.  He was buried in Hamm in Luxembourg, fitting, in that the people of Luxembourg still regard Patton and his 3rd Army as their liberator.  I love this movie.  I could watch this movie over and over until the real doomsday!  It is biased toward the Four star General Patton somewhat, however, historians seem to agree that he was America's greatest military commander.  There is no adult material in this movie, the ""F"" word is not said, however, all of the ""B"" word expletives are.  In fact, the first one is said after the 11th or 12th word to come out of Patton's renowned trash mouth at the beginning of the movie, so be forewarned!  Trash mouth aside, I give this movie 5 stars; I give the real Patton 5 stars-FIVE STARS!!!

What I loved most about Patton which this movie brings out was his knowledge of history.  He not only studied the past, as Confucius urges (my favorite quote-see my review of Swords, Ships, and Sugar), he lived it and relived it since he firmly believed in reincarnation.  One of my favorite scenes is the one where he makes his driver turn in the wrong direction and leads himself and Bradley to the ruins of Carthage in North Africa.  He has a flashback of what actually transpired, explaining everything that happened there on that battlefield 2000 years ago.  Spooky stuff, and probably explains Bradley's quote, my title for this review.  Was Patton a child of God?  I think so.  If God can give visions and dreams of the future, can he give visions of the past???  Interesting.  (I personally don't believe in reincarnation, it's not in my bible, yet I don't think it's a critical issue).  My favorite reply of Patton's in this movie was his answer to a priest who asked if Patton read the bible he kept by his bed.  He replies, ""Ev'ry God d--ned day!!!""  Me, too!!! ME TOO!!!

The reporters and journalists who swarmed around Patton, particularly after the slapping incident, reminded me so much of the scribes, pharisees, spies, who hounded Jesus, ready to twist and turn around every word that was said to nail him on.  I loved the bible verses that were read while he was walking out to meet the newsies which are from Psalm 63, probably from the English Standard Version.  The last verse, my favorite, reads: But the king shall rejoice in God; all who swear by him shall exult, for the mouths of liars will be stopped.",1098403200,,4597,4.6670807453416145

1645781,5,B00005PJ8O,"I can't remember exactly what prompted me to buy this DVD, but it its first five minutes left quite an impression.  For those who have seen it, that is, of course, ""The Speech"".  For medical reasons beyond my control, I was not able to stay in the Army (15 Oct 1997 -- 15 Jan 1998, MOS 11M [would-be]), but those first few minutes made me want to jump back in and kill every damned terrorist on this planet, because everything he said about the ""Hun"" could be said about fighting the ""Arab"" and the ""Persian"" equally.

The last line of the speech proper, the visualization of his troops' firesides 30 years from now, is quite possibly the most important line of the film.  It gives a view, albeit only  microscopic, of his command of history, and how he lived, ate, slept, and breathed the history of his profession, and was able to understand the propensity of the occasion as it was happening.

The only other two parts that compete with it also lift, for a few short moments, the veil of the past.

The first is the scene at what I would guess Patton and Bradley were at Zama (among the runins after Patton orders the driver off the beaten path), where the Roman Scipio Africanus beat the more famous Hannibal, in what was probably the most important battle for the Romans, republic or empire, where, even though I don't believe in reincarnation, his clearer-than-crystal view of the past makes it hard not to.

The second is the end scene as he walks out in the meadow with ""Willie"".  The monologue is so picturesque that, were I to fall asleep during that scene, and I woke up later, I would probably be looking for my sword and fumbling around in my chair looking for the reins of a chariot.

Among the most well-done scenes were those done with Capt. Steiger, the Nazi officer assigned to research Patton.  He, better than anyone except for Scott, conveyed the Patton ""mystique"" in this film.  His best scenes were warning Col-General Jodl that Patton would attack Sicily (because the Athenians did in the Peloponnesian War, and the final scene in the command post, where Patton's picture is burned, and he is bid a fond farewell as the ""Pure Warrior"".  If this latter scene actually happened somewhere in the doldrums of the Nazi regime, it is pure prophecy, because the absence of war ultimately did kill him inside, to the point that it was almost a good thing that he died when he did, so that his legend was cemented.

While this film was worth the six stars we have bestowed on General Washington, it is not beyond reproach.

Part of the problem is Bradley's influence.  I respect Bradley, and I loved his comment about Monty's proposed ""dagger thrust"" (Bradley likened it more to a ""butter knife thrust""), but I don't think that Bradley's and Patton's friendship was always as amicable as is put forth in the show.  Patton's and Ike's relationship was also a bit better than portrayed.  There's also the glaring omission of any discussion about FDR before his death. More than any adverse relationship between Patton and Bradley, I think these scenes were just a matter of Bradley not fully understanding what Patton was about.  As is said in the movie, Bradley does his job because he is trained to do it; Patton does his because he loves it (l'audace, l'audace, toujours l'audace!).  That one was probably correct, and a good explanation.

The only thing that angered me about the movie was that, at times, Patton is portrayed as a micromanager or a figurehead.  The most glaring display of this, is his return out of the doghouse, before he gets 3rd Army, and he is shown just riding around in a jeep, with a big grin on his face; he was much more than that.

Any who have had the honor of knowing a former 3rd Army soldier, or even one from  II Corps or 7th Army, know that other soldiers will give their unit, whereas soldiers in those Armies or that Corps, when Patton commanded, will almost invariably say ""I was with Patton.""  Not only that, on the way to a church service project one time, I was reading a summary of 20 decisive battles, and that morphed into a conversation where one of my friends said the same exact words...about his uncle.  Patton's influence is one that will be felt long after we have gone the way of the dodo bird, and no general that just sits in a jeep can have that kind of effect.

The only glaring inaccuracy in the film is at the speech.  No, the editing of the language was done for the general public; he generally would only cuss profusely in front of his troops.  He was only a Lieutenant General (3 stars) at the time of ""The Speech.""

Other than these slight criticisms, it is a perfect movie.  The music, especially the theme music, is also perfect.  Again, six stars.",1094342400,,4728,4.552009456264775

The film faithfully and candidly presents the life of America's most cunning WWII general as described by his fellow officer General Bradley in his memoirs and Patton's own autobiography.  The film shows how he was a commander whom even great German generals such as Erwin Rommel feared and respected.  It shows him as a controversial figure who, although an ardent Christian, believed in reincarnation.  Bellicose and foul mouthed, Patton was his own worst enemy in the Pentagon and on the political scene: foiling many opportunities for him to be assigned a command on the front.  The film also shows how he became a controversial leader with his own troops for reprimanding a shell-shocked soldier as a coward.  The film follows his exploits in Operation Torch in North Africa, the invasion of Sicily and Italy, and some of his activities in Northern Europe.  The film also shows how Patton had a pretty low opinion of Montgomery as a man and as a military commander: they were both bitter rivals throughout the war.

This is not really a war film but strictly a dramatic biography on one whose business happened to be war.  The few combat action scenes in the film are decent and well balanced in contrast to the main character; the cinematography is also quite good.  Under good direction by Schaffner, George C. Scott delivers a winning performance to a role he was literally born to play.  A great film deserving an honored place in any war film buff's collection.",1092700800,,1842,4.925566343042071
1645785,4,B00005PJ8O,"Patton, released in 1970, is said to be one of the greatest war films of all times even some 34 years later.  George C. Scott is so convincing as Patton that you forget he is acting.  At nearly 3 hours, it won seven Academy Awards.  Patton, a crazy yet brave General of World War II is a man who's entire being evolves around war and his ego.  Director Franklin J. Schaffner ensures that the audience sees General Patton not only as the fiery tyrant who believes he is the reincarnation of Alexander The Great, but also how soft-skinned he is.  In the end, the audience has a genuine love-hate relationship with this General who while is respected above all others by the Germans would waste a soldier's life to feed his own ego.  This film, full of death, destruction, and action is just what any man could have ordered in a film.  While others are notable in the film including, Karl Malden as Gen. Omar N. Bradley, Scott completely overshadows everyone else.

The previous edition was awash in heavy use of digital noise reduction which often make fine detail look smeared on the screen particularly on a larger plasma or LCD. The remaster (which features George C. Scott against the background of an American flag full face vs. the previous Blu master which had a white background with only half of Scott's face visible--the digibook edition is also the older master as is the edition in this packagePatton / Longest Day / Sand Pebbles / Tora Tora [Blu-ray])looks marvelous--the film grain looks natural and grain is consistent from scene to scene. Fine detail is much improved especially skin textures although keep in mind this will never look quite as sharp or as detailed as a current film, it looks darn good for its age. Fox did a exceptional job on remastering this and made sure to only use minimal edge enchacement and digital noise reduction tastefully.

War is hell. More importantly, war is hell for those whose very lives are defined by it. The late George C. Scott brings Patton to life in a way that few actors could have. A West Point graduate who believed he was the reincarnation of Alexander The Great, Patton focuses on the character of the man and his obsessive rivalry with ""Monty"" his British counterpart. Patton comes across as a gunslinger in modern warfare believing that the code of conduct for a soldier in battle should be respected regardless of which side you're on and, of course, his side should always be the winning side.

Francis Ford Coppola co-wrote the perceptive screenplay (and shared an Oscar for it although he never worked with is co-writer the late Edmund H. North. The two wrote separate drafts one of which incorporated information from the memoir of General Omar Bradley)and the talented late director Franklin J. Schaffner (""Planet of the Apes"", ""The Warlord"")fashioned his directorial masterpiece from the material he had at hand. Brilliantly filmed with sharp, powerful support performances (particularly from the talented Karl Malden), ""Patton"" remains one of the best films about an individual involved in a massive war and what drove him to try and be the best.

The special features are largely confined to the second disc a standard DVD (although we do get an entertaining commentary track from Coppola who notes throughout material that he wrote vs. North and how they compliment each other in the final version). We also get an interesting and lively introduction by Coppola on the first disc as well.

The second disc includes an excellent documentary ""The Making of 'Patton'"" from 1997. We also get ""Patton's Ghost Corps"" which covers Patton's campagins. The Ken Burns 2000 documentary ""History Through The Lens: Patton-The Rebel Revisited"" is an exceptional overview of the man and the mythology that surrounded him both when he was alive and after death. We also get a gallery (accompanied by Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar nominated score)and we also get an essay on the historical Patton.",1091232000,,3030,5.0159045725646125
1645787,5,B00005PJ8O,"In 1970, two films juxtaposed each other. ""Patton"" was an unlikely winner of eight Oscars. The pacifist Scott for all practical purposes took his Buck Turgidson character and refined him into the real-life Patton. In interviews, Scott said he found his research of Patton revealed an unbalanced man, but on screen Scott nailed him as the vainglorious, brilliant, driven warmonger he was. Steiger was offered the role first but turned it down because it glorified war. Vietnam was absolutely at its apex. It was very surprising that Hollywood would make such a film at that time. But director Frankin Schaffner had served under Patton, and after making ""The Planet of the Apes"" had the clout to call his shots. The film did not get America behind the war, but it did cause Nixon to start bombing Cambodia because the Patton story convinced him to get tough. The screenwriter, oddly enough, was Francis Ford Coppola, who may have done himself a turn. Coppola was no war lover, and wrote ""Patton"" as a man obsessed with war (""God help me, I love it so""), deluded by visions of Napoleonic grandeur mixed with Episcopalian Christianity and karmic reincarnation. The intent may have been to show a psychotic military man, to de-mask his heroism, and this may have been what prompted Scott to play it. From page to screen there are virtually no changes, but if Coppola was trying to put down the military by showing Patton's human warts, the result was a brilliant work that now is one of, if not the most, conservative pictures ever made. Watching ""Patton"" stirs wonderful pride in two countries (Great Britain is prominent in the film) that were tough enough to stand up to the Nazis when the rest of the world cowered in victimhood. Karl Malden's Omar Bradley is Patton's perfect foil, as is the Bernard Law Montgomery character. The film saved Coppola, who was about to be fired as ""The Godfather"" director. When he won the Oscar for ""Patton"", it gave him too much clout to get the axe.

The Islamic terrorist plaguing the world today all say they want to die.  Patton would say that he is glad to oblige them.

What can we add underlying the superb performing of George C. Scott? . More than an actor, Scott was a model. You feel Patton and forget half an hour after to Scott, because he melts with the character and disappears before us, in a mesmerizing way that you could compare without any effort to Marlon Brando.
Franklin Schaffner was a talented director. Imagine the caleidoscopic twist that means going from The planet of the apes to Patton and ending with Nicholas and Alexandra.

The camera' s handling , the brilliant sequences of the desert{s battle, the insights of the General are described and supported by a genial script.

There's a worthy point which deserves to mention: the reflections of Patton when he's in the battlefield remembering that somehow he was there, reminding the echoes of the Greeks who fought centuries ago. It's a powerful metaphor but told with such kind of force that you remind to Alejandro Magno and Achilles with making use of the emotive memories.

Patton is an emblematic personality the hero' s essence encarnated in the middle of the XX Century.

From the moment Patton opens, you know this will be like no other war movie. Standing before the biggest American flag Ive ever seen, General George S. Patton Jr. wears a highly buffed, black helmet and a uniform suggesting the 18th or 19th century, weighed down with medals domestic and foreign, bearing not one but two ivory-handled revolvers, and holding a riding crop. As a bugler plays To the Colors,"" the camera focuses on each feature in turn. And then Scott lets loose with the pictures famous monologue (an edited version of a speech he actually gave to American troops in England on the eve of D-Day).
Now I want you to remember that no bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country.
Atten  tion!
Consider the time. In 1969, when Patton was made, America was mired in an unpopular war in Vietnam, the draft was just about to be ended, and America was preparing to pull her fighting men out of the first military defeat in her history. Many who supported the war effort, felt the military had been sabotaged by the media. And here was this spirit from the past, saying that Americans love to fight, and will not tolerate a loser!
Early in Patton, we hear the sound of distant trumpets, as in 1943, the general surveys the ancient battlefield where Carthage (modern name, Tunis, in Tunisia) was burnt to the ground by the Romans in 146 B.C.
Patton is standing near the Kasserine Pass in Tunisia, where over 1,000 American G.I.s were butchered in their first encounter with the German Wehrmacht, in the form of Field Marshal Erwin Rommels Afrika Korps. I was there, he tells his assistant. In 146 B.C.
Is he mad or is he teasing? The answer is, a little of both.
He quotes from a lush, romantic poem of the eternal warrior  he is the poet. An American poet-general? Clearly, we are dealing with a man singular in the annals of 20th century American warfare. I hate the 20th century, the old cavalry horse officer remarks.
He refers to himself as a prima donna, but as director Franklin Schaffner, scenarists Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North, and star George C. Scott portray him, megalomaniac is more like it. Before going in to battle, as he stands before his mirror, his Negro soldier-valet carefully placing his begoggled helmet on his head, he more closely resembles a Roman general (or Il Duce) than a modern officer. And in a notorious, true incident, upon encountering a shell-shocked soldier, he slaps the man silly, threatens to shoot him, and is almost cashiered by Ike. But he was our greatest 20th century field commander.
(The valet is played by a trim, youthful-looking, fifty-year-old Jimmy Edwards. Unfortunately, Edwards (Home of the Brave, Bright Victory, The Member of the Wedding, The Manchurian Candidate, etc.), whose career was limited by racism, died of a massive heart attack before the films release. He went through hell, paving the way so that the likes of Sidney Poitier and Denzel Washington could become screen icons, while he was forgotten.)
In Pattons brutality, in his talk of never giving up an inch of land (Hitler said the very same thing.), in his contempt for civilian authority, in his joy at killing, he comes across as a fascist or Nazi, which is how he was often depicted at the time. Amazingly, the movie is able to glorify this man, while maintaining a posture of cold sentimentality towards him. Schaffner loves Patton, but without illusions. Patton wasn't larger than life  no one is - he WAS life, or at least the martial, intellectual, and aesthetic lives, in all their fullness.
George Patton Jr. had a sense of destiny; his purpose in life was to achieve greatness leading desperate men in combat. And as he observes, only once in a thousand years, do the heavens so align themselves that a soldier has such an opportunity to change history.
Fortunately, in the movie as in life, Patton had humble, ordinary Joe - at least as Bradley tells it - Gen. Omar Bradley (the last five-star, General of the Army, in the history of the U.S. Army) as a counterweight. Bradley is played by Karl Malden with a restraint and self-effacing humor that perfectly contrast Patton/Scotts bravado.
Jerry Goldsmiths score has just the right blend of the elegiac (distant trumpets) and the pompous yet playful (fanfare of horns and flutes), corresponding to the tempers of Pattons personality.
While almost three hours long, Patton does not flag, and could easily have been longer.
The DVD has a lovely documentary on the making of Patton, as well as Jerry Goldsmiths rousing score.
Just as Patton could not savor his success, so too George C. Scott, the rare actor who could carry a film on his shoulders, was unable to build on his success as Patton. But for one moment, he tasted of that perfection that comes when the stars align, and a great role is delivered into the hands of just the right actor at just the right moment in his career. It was George C. Scotts destiny to play Patton.

1645795,5,B00005PJ8O,"It's hard to decide whether Patton was more feared by the enemy or by the very men who served under him.  His attitude was gruff, his outlook bloody, and his thirst for conflict insatiable.  But with this film, viewers get to see exactly why this opinionated, sometimes unethical General was possibly the greatest leader on the battlefield in the European Theatre of World War II - and George C. Scott portrays Patton in a most memorable manner.
Without a doubt, Patton's exploits on the battlefield won great victories for the Allies.  This is, of course, not to take away from powerful leaders on both sides, such as Patton's comrade-yet-rival Field Marshal Sir Bernard Law Montgomery, but Patton will always be remembered by the United States Army not only for his glories, but also for the controversy he managed to stir up.  This film showcases both sides of the man.  His respect for the uniform and his undeniable loyalty to the United States of America made him the hero, but his quest to ""beat Montgomery to Messina"" and the incident in which he slapped an enlisted man and called him a coward do much to antagonize him in the eyes of many.  That's one of the greatest things about this film:  the filmmakers have made it so that it does not concentrate wholly on Patton's good side nor his bad side, but instead, create an atmosphere in which the viewer's opinion of the man constantly changes.
Packed with intense battle scenes, dialogue that is often nearly as intense, and some somber moments, ""Patton"" is a film that will have your attention for the entirety of its nearly three-hour running length.  If you're the special-effects lover, then this film is probably not for you, but understand that it was made before the advent of computer-aided and, in my opinion, useless and corny graphic effects.  This is just pure cinematic mastery, depicting a great leader and a passionate, even if flawed, fighting man.",1063411200,,1925,4.8090909090909095
1645796,5,B00005PJ8O,"Patton is a film that was made in 1970.  It's a film that tells the story of one of America's most remembered and most telling characters in history.  George C. Scott gives the performance of the century playing George S. Patton, looking and sounding and acting just like the real Patton, as recorded by Gen. Omar Bradley in which the film is based on.
Patton is a very different war movie.  It was quite revolutionary in its time.  Unlike a lot of war movies that survive off special effects, gore and heroism, Patton shines with its drama and realism as you follow the war-time biography of Patton.  You learn a great deal about the politics, the system of the upper brass in our armed forces, and the frustration to coordinate and perform critical opperations.  You also learn a great deal about the man, Patton, himself.
There is so much character developing, so much hard work put into the character of Patton, it clearly pays off in a huge way.  This film will intrigue you as well as enlighten you.  Patton's character is entertaining, he's real, he's distant yet close when it comes to relating, and he can be serious as well as funny.  All of this makes Patton a master piece.
There is one little problem I had with the film.  And that is I wasn't really pleased with Patton's heroic march through the winter of '44 to save the sieged soldiers.  It wasn't very clear and it had little to no action in it, just telling you that they won it.  This wasn't satisfactory, and yet it was Patton's highlight of his military career.  A major let down, but it wasn't major enough to ruin the film.  Thankfully.  If it wasn't for the structure of the film, which already lacked action and engagements of battles, this might've ruined it if you are somebody who is interested in detailed history of the occurrences in WWII like me.
Overall Patton is a very powerful, dramatic film that circles around a man and his obsession with being a combat general in the heat of a war.  It's a film that you will probably see more than once because it is a very special film.
You cannot get enough Patton, his character will live on because it comes across so powerfully in this film.  It is a character and a story you are unlikely to forget.

1645797,4,B00005PJ8O,"Don't be mistaken: this classic war movie is not so much about war as it is about a man: General George S. Patton, arguably America's greatest Second World War combat general.  Based on two books about Patton (""Patton: Ordeal and Triumph"" by Ladislas Farago and ""A Soldier's Story"" by General Omar Bradley), the movie explores the war within his soul, and the temperament that was his undoing and yet brought him unprecedented success. Limited to his military career between early 1943 and late 1945, it's more of a character study than a biography.  But with a running time close to three hours, it's a character study with tremendous depth.
Several aspects of his character are highlighted.
1. Patton was fiercely competitive.  His race to beat British Field Marshall Montgomery to Messina and then to Berlin becomes a prime motivator for success, even if he needs to sacrifice men to achieve his personal ambitions.
2. Patton loved war and thrived on the heat of battle.  While his compatriot General Omar Bradley did his job because he was trained to do it, Patton did it because he loved it. ""I love it, God help me, I do love it more than my life."" Patton had no political ambitions, and his only fear was that the war would have no role for him: ""All I want to do is command an army in combat."" As his German opposites observed, ""The absence of war will kill him.""
3. Patton was a passionate military historian.  His love for military battles of the past constantly becomes evident: ""Patton is a 16th century man, a romantic warrior lost in contemporary times.""
4. Patton was intensely religious.  He believed in both God and reincarnation, and was convinced that the lines of history were in place for him to achieve great things, and that God would enable him to fulfil his destiny - ""The last great opportunity of a lifetime and I'm left out of it? God will not allow it to happen.""  Yet his fierce religious fervour towards God was juxtaposed by his profanity towards men.  He frequently blasphemed, one incident in particular bringing out these conflicting qualities, when in reply to a question about the regularity of his Bible reading, Patton remarks ""Every God-damned day.""  It's been said that the raw language typical of Patton is even toned down in the movie (he supposedly once said ""You can't train a platoon without using profanity"").  Yet his inclination toward profanity is not excused, but is presented as part of a larger problem he had in controlling his tongue.
5. Patton was inspirational.  He knew it was natural for soldiers to fear battle, and combated this with a fierce military discipline that made the soldiers fear him instead.  ""They'll lose their fear of the Germans ... I hope to God they never lose their fear of me.""  ""I won't have cowards in my army.""  The inspiring and bloodthirsty monologue that opens the movie with Patton dwarfed by the American flag is unforgettable: ""No bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country.""
6. Patton himself lacked the discipline he expected of his soldiers.  His moments of lax self-control led him to say and do things that got him into serious trouble with both his superiors and allies.
These last aspects are especially important.  The movie almost has the aura of a convincing documentary, because it paints Patton with his virtues and vices. This is one of the movie's strengths: it portrays Patton as he was, with both strengths and weaknesses, without openly glorifying or condemning them.  Director Franklin J. Schaffner stated in 1970 ""We are not defending General Patton, and we are not attacking General Patton.  We are really telling the true story of one of the most fabulous and interesting characters that I have ever observed in action.""  More than anything else, it's a serious study of his complex character.  This war within the man overshadows the war outside the man.  Patton was his own worst enemy, his big mouth frequently getting him into trouble, and resulting in him being relieved from his command on more than one occasion. Great as he was, he was not without weaknesses, but his failings are shown without excusing them.  In fact, Patton's weaknesses were the reason Eisenhower opted to advance General Omar Bradley ahead of Patton, although Patton was always his first choice when a brash military leader on the field was needed for a particularly bold mission. Despite his weaknesses, Patton was truly inspirational to those who served beneath him and the importance of his contribution to the Allied success is undeniable.
At times the story goes beyond the man, with a broader focus on the war effort.  First Patton and Montgomery vie for success against Rommel in Sicily, and then again in Europe.  But the war scenes are always on a large scale, with wide angle shots of explosions, tanks and masses of infantry, rather than individual experiences of horror.  In the end, it is not the world war that is center stage, but the complex character of the man Patton, and the war between his passions.  George C. Scott's performance as Patton is brilliant and one of the memorable performances in cinema.  It's not surprising that the movie went on to win seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture.  It has that epic ""Lawrence of Arabia"" feel, and it serves of a lasting testament to the confusing personality of a strange yet important military leader: Patton himself. -GODLY GADFLY",1060041600,,5469,4.820320855614973
1645798,5,B00005PJ8O,"~Patton~ played at our local movie theatre for more than six months. It was an immensely popular film upon its release, (1970) and continues to be one of the best biographical films of all time. There wasn't much to do in our small town on the weekends, so we just went to the movies. I must have seen this film over ten times during its long run, and I never grew tired of it. Years later, watching it again on video, reminded me how adept Franklin Schaffner was at making the Epic, which seemed to be the fashionable genre during the 60's and 70's. The list of his achievements includes, ""The Boy's from Brazil"", ""Papillon"" and ""Nicholas and Alexandra"". All great pictures, all great stories, which have that particular Schaffner style: epic-like, professional, and memorable with a lot of class.
It is common knowledge that George C. Scott won the Oscar that year for best actor and declined the accolade for political and artistic reasons. This proved to be a significant turning point in his career; in fact his career seemed to go down hill after that, and he never fully recovered. This was unfortunate because Scott's performance in Patton is a work of pure genius, and he deserved to go on to do more high profile parts. For a lot of us, when we think of the historical character, General George Patton, we think of the actor, George C. Scott. The film and Scott's performance have become our historical reference point for the time and the man. When I think of the Seventh and Third armies during WW2, I visualize the actor in the Schaffner film standing in his jeep barking orders and inspiring his men to carry on against impossible odds. And that's the beauty of this film; it is accurate both historically and biographically. Of course, artistic license is taken occasionally, but for the most part, according to most WW2 historians, the film is true to the mark.
This is not so much a war film but a story about a leader whom despite insurmountable obstacles, inspired men to great heights, achieving the near unattainable. Patton was an educated man from a distinguished military family, who viewed the world from an historical perspective - `old blood and guts' believed he was part of world history, an immortal soul that fought against the Romans, and later, was part of Napoleon's army that forged into Moscow in the early 19th century. Patton was a believer in reincarnation- the theory that knowledge can be `remembered', because the soul or mind has passed through a previous series of bodied and disembodied states. Whether this notion is true or not, Patton believed he had the accumulative knowledge from past lives and used this knowledge during his command in WW2. At the end of the film, one of the German characters comments that Patton was an anachronism, the romantic warrior of times passed, whom without a war to fight, would perish. This was certainly true. George Patton knew his purpose and destiny, and that was to lead men into battle.

1645799,5,B00005PJ8O,"The complexity of General George S. Patton, Jr. is mind-boggling.  A relentless student of war.  A fierce competitor, strategist, and antagonist.  Arrogant, ruthless, and egomaniacal.  A deep, unwavering love and commitment for the men under his command.  Brash and abrasive, he was politically incorrect before anyone knew what political correctness was.
Director Franklin J. Schaffner depicts all of this complexity (and more) in his epic masterpiece, PATTON.  And George C. Scott delivers the title role brilliantly, a role that defined this distinguished actor's career.
PATTON is not propaganda:  it is a compelling look at a larger-than-life American hero, warts and all.  Brilliant as Patton was, he tended to be his own worst enemy, from slapping a soldier he accused of cowardice to jeopardizing his battalion through barren Sicily because he wanted to arrive in Messina ahead of Field Marshal Montgomery's forces.  Patton knew the enemy well, knew how to defeat it--he simply could not deal with the bureacracy of the Allied command, to his detriment.  Demoted, muzzled, he was kicked to the sidelines of World War II until General Eisenhower called him back into battle during the late stages of the conflict.  Upon returning, Patton (""Old Blood 'n Guts"") performed masterfully, enhancing his icon status.
As the war concludes, the viewer is drawn into Patton's passion to continue marching east, into Russia.  What would have happened had the British and Americans followed Patton's advice and defeated a rundown and tired Russian army?  A Cold War averted, or a cataclysmic nuclear nightmare?  The viewer can only wonder.
Karl Malden as humble and modest General Omar N. Bradley--the antithesis of Patton--is equally brilliant; Jerry Goldsmith's musical score is haunting yet superb.  PATTON is the epitome of exceptional filmmaking, an exceptional movie about an exceptional man.

1645802,5,B00005PJ8O,"George C. Scott's finest performance as the larger-than-life General Patton. Apart from Patton's military career, this film tries to uncover who the man really was. The genius of modern warfare? A romantic warrior from another time? Or perhaps a crackpot? Perhaps Patton was all of these and more.
Even in the massive scope of WWII this film keeps Patton firmly at the center. Regardless of his historical contributions to the war effort, we see him as the stuff of legend -- the kind of epic hero about whom poets like Homer used to sing.
As we follow his breathtaking career from the North Africa campaign to the end of the war, we see how Patton's ongoing collisions with the Nazis rivaled those against his own soldiers and superiors. Here was a man who only found purpose in warfare and who almost failed to appreciate it's painful, human element.
In the end, Patton triumphs, only to acknowledge that he is just playing a part in a historical drama.",1054944000,,955,4.724550898203593

Considering when this film was made (1970), it could have easily been a heavy handed indictment of things that harmed flowers and other living things. Instead we get a brilliant and innovative character study of a complicated warrior who believed in re-incarnation and the ultimate power of war and violence. Patton was a man who read his bible religiously (no pun intended) yet gloried in using the enemy's living guts to grease the wheels of his tanks. This is definitely a 'warts and all"" bio-pic. The Director, Franklin Schaffner, had a knack for making serious, no-frills movies (Pappillon, Boys from Brazil) with no superfluous romance or comic relief, and he was well chosen to take on this subject. This is a lean, mean film with no filler. Take a deep breath and prepare yourself for the opening scene. Make sure your standing at attention.",1053388800,,926,4.9423076923076925

Scott's performance as George Patton, who gave us all a taste of what it's like to lust for war. The DVD features a fine digital transfer of the film (the dialogue is overshadowed by sound effects at times, and this is the only reason I don't give it a full five stars), complete with  an intermission brake, as well as theatrical trailers for this film, the epic D-Day film ""The Longest Day,"" and the ill-conceived ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" The DVD also features a commentary track by a Patton historian! I recommend this DVD to all those who love war films.

But I didn't realize that until the ""intermission"" came across the screen.
Second, it has so many great lines that Patton used in his life, that you could be a veritable source of military aphorisms just by watching this movie (did I just write ""plethora?"").
I watched this immediately after finishing the even longer Band of Brothers series.  It was interesting to see two views from the same side, especially of the Battle of the Bulge.  It also goes to show how much technology has come.  Many of the scenes in Patton are pretty cheesy.  The battle scenes are distant as to show the entire battle, but have no focus.  The Battle of Kasserine Pass in the movie is one such example where it looks like little toy electric tanks moving and every few seconds a soldier self-combusts.  Additionally, the snow scenes in Patton during the Battle of the Bulge are extremely bad and a bit too fake.
  But dang, its all about the acting, isn't it?  That is exactly what makes this movie.  That is why I give it a better rating, and am not even basing it off of visual effects, though they can be a bit distracting at times.",1050451200,,1134,4.487804878048781

1645808,5,B00005PJ8O,"General George S. Patton Jr. (1885-1945) was one of America's most outstanding generals and strategists during World War II, but his tendency to speak very candidly and crassly often got him into trouble with the public and higher ranking officers.  Labeled by newspapers as ""Blood & Guts"", Patton demanded discipline from every soldier under his command.  He loved to study about ancient battles and saw himself as one of many reincarnations of various warriors who had fought battles throughout 2000 years.  He loved war and knew nothing else.  Beginning in 1942, General Patton commanded forces in North Africa fighting against the occupying German forces under the command of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel.  Following victory in North Africa, he commanded the Seventh Army during the joint invasion of Sicily.  British forces that also invaded Sicily were under the command of the revered Field Marshal Sir Bernard Law Montgomery.  Following the allied invasion of France in 1944, General Patton was given command of the Third Army and swept across France at record pace.  His juggernaut was also successful in relieving the beleaguered American troops trapped in the city of Bastogne, France.  He was also one of the first American commanders to discover the horrors of Nazi concentration camps.  Considered by many to be a prima donna, he had no tolerance for any soldier suffering from ""shell shock"" or ""battle fatigue""; instead he labeled such as a coward.  He wrote a book entitled ""War As I Knew It"" that was first published in 1947, two years after his death from a car accident.
Based upon the two books ""Patton: Ordeal and Triumph"" by Ladislas Farago and ""A Soldier's Story"" by General Oman N. Bradley, director Franklin J. Schaffner created the film ""Patton"" in 1970 starring George C. Scott as the outspoken General Patton, which earned him the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role.  (Scott refused to accept the Oscar on the grounds that he did not consider himself to be in competition with other actors.)  The film begins with Patton standing before a giant American flag and giving a speech to troops that have been placed under his command.  Following the speech, the film documents Patton's life between 1942 (when he begins fighting Germans in North Africa) and 1945 (shortly after the defeat of Germany).
Aspects of the film that well depict General Patton were the competition that he felt with Field Marshall Montgomery (Michael Bates) and personality conflicts with General Bradley (Karl Malden). Of course, since the actual General Bradley consulted directly on the film, the portrayal of Patton could be regarded as being slightly biased.  Also depicted were Patton's slapping of a frightened soldier (Tim Considine) whom he also accused of being a coward, as well as candid comments made in Knutsford, England, that made Patton a public relations liability for the Allied Command.  Sadly, not shown in the film was the liberation of the concentration camp at Buchenwald by the Third Army.  There, General Patton was the first American commander to order nearby German civilians to tour a liberated concentrated camp: a precedent adopted by other American field commanders.
Franklin J. Schaffner received the Oscar for Best Director for ""Patton"" and the film also won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Editing, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Sound and Best Writing.  It also received nominations for Best Cinematography, Best Music and Best Visual Effects.  At 170 minutes, the film does not seem too long.  Instead, the various battles were done very well and George C. Scott's excellent portrayal of General Patton is completely engaging.  Overall, I rank ""Patton"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend the film to everyone.  General Patton was instrumental in the Allies' decisive victory over Nazi Germany in 1945.",1048464000,,3868,5.125796178343949

George C. Scott's portrayal of Patton is excellent, so much so that I sometimes forget that it's an actor playing Patton rather than the man himself.
The only minor complaint that I have about this movie is that it's not totally historicially accurate(e.g. the slapping incident- there were two slapping incidents and the movie condenced both of them into one incident).

Scott giving his classic speech to the troops with the background of that huge flag behind him. And the movie just gets better from there. Near-perfect performances from Scott and Karl Malden with an equally strong supporting cast. Some of the historical details have been glossed over, but that's ok; it actually strengths the film overall. And who can forget the wonderful theme music?!

1645812,5,B00005PJ8O,"First of all, the movie Patton is one of my all time favorites. To say I have viewed this film dozens of times is an understatement. The new two-disc DVD version is simply spectacular. The brilliant color and clarity compared with the VHS tape is like night and day. So what is left to say about this classic winner of eight Academy Awards?Over the years, I have discovered that this movie, as great as it is, is only an introduction to the complexity of Gen George S. Patton Jr. The producers in conjunction with George C. Scott's memorable performance convey only a sample of the many sides of Patton. The film touches on Patton's multi-faceted personality with a fair degree of artistic license. Patton was well versed in history but was he, as the German officer assigned to study him concluded, an ""anachronism?"" Patton believed in reincarnation and also that his destiny was ""to lead a lot of men in a desperate battle."" But was he an eccentric? For the novice viewer who, like myself thirty years ago, is enjoying this movie for the first time, it should provide a thirst to learn more about this flamboyant military figure. The older biographies of Martin Blumenson and Ladislas Farago, the latter providing meat for the film, are good starting points. The later work by Carlo D'Este _A Genius for War_ supersedes the rest. The producers of the DVD anticipated this hunger and included an audio essay by Charles M Province (president of the George S Patton Historical Society and author of _The Unknown Patton_). Province's monologue, though factual, sounds adlibbed and unrehersed. It is obvious a prepared script would have benefited this essay. For the Patton afficionado the producer's license with chronology and settings in the film will be evident. For example, the scene where Patton untangles a gridlocked convoy occured in the town square of the city of Avranches, not in an open field as depicted in the film. It must be remembered that General of the Army Omar N. Bradley acted as chief advisor during the filming. Those well versed in this period will recognise there was no love lost between these two men and the Bradley bias must be taken into consideration. A second DVD disc goes behind the scenes of the making of Patton along with a sound track of the film's hauntingly beautiful musical score. Regardless, there is probably no better film biography of an American military figure to grace the big screen than Patton. Every scene is a gem. Even 1960s era American tanks serving both German and American forces (the former with incorrect paint scheme to boot) can be overlooked. Scott is magnificent (even though the real Patton had a much higher squeeky voice) as is Karl Malden as Omar Bradley. If you even remotely enjoyed this film on VHS, run, do not walk, to buy the DVD!  A warning to the new generation of movie lovers, do not prejudge Patton on the film's portrayal. Read D'Este and the film will make a lovely backdrop.",1042848000,,2956,4.784735812133072
1645813,5,B00005PJ8O,"PATTON opens with George C Scott's famed six minute monologue as  General George S Patton addressing troops. This segment alone is enough to convince viewers that Scott deserved his Oscar- even if he himself didn't want it. He gives a superlative performance as the hard-assed and fearless General who is the only US General truly feared by the Nazis: Ironic considering Patton  had his nose shot off by the Germans. The man thinks nothing of shooting fatigued pack horses and dumping them into a river because they no longer serve their purpose to him. But although he is referred to by his men as ""old blood-and-guts"" (""Our blood, his guts"") Patton still manages to hide an almost fatherly love towards them (the scene where Patton tends a wounded soldier in hospital and then reverts to his hard-nose self and begins beating up on the poor guy for being a coward. And later in fearless mode to one of his superiors ""I shaved very close this morning, in preparation of getting smacked by you"".
The battle sequences are well staged. In fact not a single frame of PATTON's 2 1/2 hours that doesn't detract the viewer's interest. If high school history had been this interesting, maybe I would have passed.
My only complaints with the movie: What's with the stupid intermission two-thirds of the way through the film? And second, it seems Jerry Goldsmith later recycled a portion of his score for the POLICE ACADEMY movies.

It seemed a breed of films was dying, but fortunately, ""Patton,"" a poignant biography of the decorated General George S. Patton, gave the genre something to hang its hat on--and set the standard for epic war films, for those to come, and somehow for those in the past.
Contrary to the popular summary, this is not a glorification of General Patton, or of war itself; ""Patton"" is the insight of a man absorbed in a world of guts-n-glory, a world of conflict between himself, his duty, and the threat of being overun by ego and arrogance. George C. Scott's portrayal of the general will take the viewer's breath away with his brilliant and detailed performance; the brilliance and accuracy of the directing and screenwriting go without saying when one sees the power of the film for the first time. There is no better way to end a genre than to summarize it all with one film; ""Patton.""",1028246400,,1078,4.73936170212766
1645816,5,B00005PJ8O,"This cinematic character study benefitted from the perfect casting of George C. Scott in the title role.  There has seldom been a more remarkable marriage of an actor with a role.  For most people, George C. Scott is George S. Patton, and George S. Patton is George C. Scott.  The result is a great film.  AFI ranks it at number 89 on their list of the top 100 American films, but that is a gross injustice.  The film deserves to be in the top 50, at least.
Viewing this again, I noticed an interesting fact: Dwight D. Eisenhower is never on the screen, despite the fact that in real life Ike and Patton were good friends, met frequently and occasionally stayed up all night talking things out.  In the movie, Ike's thoughts are communicated by letter, or through Gen. Omar Bradley (Karl Malden) or Ike's chief of staff, Gen. Bedell Smith.  This was a clever tactic, however.  Since Ike and Douglas MacArthur were arguably the only two American generals who emerged from the war more famous than Patton, having Ike onscreen might have been distracting.  There is one star in this show, and it is Patton.
This movie tells the story of how Patton, an authentic military genius--perhaps the only one to emerge from U.S. military during the war--was not utilized as well as he should have been, because he was a miserable politician.  It makes you wonder, as did a previous reviewer, whether a man like Patton, a ""pure warrior"" as the Germans so correctly labeled him, could even be promoted very high in today's bureaucratic, politically correct army.  As Patton himself wrote, ""Men, even so called great men, are wonderfully weak and timid.  They are too damned polite.  War is very simple, direct, and ruthless.  It takes a simple, direct, and ruthless man to wage war.""  If timid, weak, and polite men were a problem in WWII, and this film shows that they were, think how bad the problem is today.  Thank God we're the only superpower left, and that we're so much stronger than all the other nations that we'll never again need a man of Patton's calibur.
On the technical side, this disc looks great.  The movie was one of only two movies shot in Dimension 150, a camera that actually captured 150 degrees, an enormously wide angle, and even the edges are perfectly focused.  The letterbox, widescreen format is the only acceptable version, and the larger the screen the better.  The sound is a bit spotty, with dialogue difficult to hear without being blown out of the room by sound effects accompanying tanks and planes.  Best to watch with the remote in hand.  I noticed that the 5.1 soundtrack worked alot better on my system than the dolby surroundsound.
There is a second disk with the excellent Jerry Goldsmith sound track and a ""making of"" documentary.  The documentary is very weak.  We hear audio clips from George C. Scott and director Franklin J. Schaffner, but they are not interviewed onscreen.  If it was going to be a tribute to Schaffner, as it purported to be, he should have had plenty of screen time, and they should have mentioned (and shown clips of) his other works, such as Planet of the Apes.  Worst of all, we are treated to Oliver Stone's lunatic ravings about how ""Patton"" indirectly caused the Cambodian genocide.  Good grief! If you have only 45 minutes of material, make a 45 minute documentary.  It wouldn't surprise me if this is why future editions of this DVD have dropped the second disc altogether.  There really wasn't enough material to justify it.",1026086400,,3487,4.700164744645799
1645817,5,B00005PJ8O,"Movies of course are meant to entertain, not instruct, but this movie does actually come close to pulling off an accurate historical portrait of a man that some considered a detestable prima donna, and others a brilliant tactician and hero. It is easy to form impressions of Patton while watching this movie: A narcisstic Patton fixated on his image in the mirror while getting ready for his first battle with German forces; a sarcastic playful Patton who replies ""Every Goddamn day"" to the question of his daily Bible reading habits; A self-absorbed Patton who must have his beach landing in Sicily refilmed many times; an insecure Patton who must beat Montgomery to Messina to prove his manhood; Patton as a brilliant military historian and tactician; Patton's belief in reincarnation and in personal destiny; Patton's antagonisim with authority while expecting his troops to accept his unconditionally; a Patton unable to control his emotions in the slapping of the soldier; Patton's pride of his troops on the March to Bastogne; Patton's belief in the intervention of God in human affairs (the asking of a ""weather prayer"" to clear the skies in order to make an assault upon the German forces at Bastogne); Patton as a 16th century warrior caught up in modern times.
 The cinematography and the acting in this movie are brilliant and it will no doubt endure as one of the best war movies of all time. One can probably say without doubt that Patton would find it difficult to function in the military of the 21st century, with its accountability to the press and its extreme emphasis on minimization of casualities. With a few exceptions, war is no longer glorified and troops are no longer viewed impersonally but as individuals. But courage is still viewed as a virtue, and this movie shows that Patton and those who served under him, had this in abundance.",1022457600,,1862,4.911111111111111
1645818,5,B00005PJ8O,"'Patton: Lust for Glory' is a wonderful movie - a real warts and all job. It shows him as a Prima Donna: vain, arrogant, bullying; but also brilliant, brave, cultured. A very strange, complex man. Full credit should go to the men responsible for making the film such an artistic success: The director Franklin J Schaffner, the scriptwriter Francis Ford Coppala, and, of course, George C. Scott who starred as Patton. George C Scott was awarded a well-deserved Oscar for his performance. He turned it down, saying that life wasn't a race. What a superb gesture?
If only all bio-pics were this good. I only wish it had been more influential. We rarely get bio-pics as good as this any more. Gibson's lamentable take on the William Wallace story is a good example. Even Jordan's 'Michael Collins' was a missed opportunity.

The movie protrayed Patton as a war monger which is a misinterpretation of his real nature. He was a General a true warrior and new his military history from the dawn of time. In the beginning of the movie he takes over III Corps which was in diseray from the humiliateing loss at Kasserine Pass. He HAD to be tough to get those men back in fighting condition. Near the end of the film when his 3rd Army is racing accross Europe you can see that although his men feared him and some thought him crazy they wanted no one else leading him. Patton once said that at the end of every war we have been involved with, we have always left something undone. He was right and we fought a ""cold war"" with Russia for 50 years. If you read the book that the movie was ""based on"" you'd find that the amphifious assault that he ordered in Sicily was a brillant tactical menuver that caught the Germans off guard and probably saved thousands of Americans lives.

1645821,4,B00005PJ8O,"Seems like George Patton was portrayed, in the movie, as a charismatic, strong willed and an effective leader with a mouth to boot..!! I believe the light shed on him showed that he cared for the men who gave 110% for him and his country yet loathed and despised a man for his apparent weakness to fake injury or show any sign of what he called 'cowardness'.
Unfortunately, men like these are bound to have faults. His were apparent. All to eager to mouth-off to everyone and anyone more often than not got him into trouble. As he said, he's not there to make friends...he's there to fight..!!
It was a good movie showing him as a person and how he 'ticked' and it also showed his understanding of war and how it worked. His apparent ""previous life"" captured a sense of destiny which is something I haven't seen in a movie before. He forever seemed determined to right the wrongs of the world and was completely convinced that he was the man to do it. His almost obsessive nature on the history of previous wars played a major part, for
his role, in the film.
On the German side there showed some lieutenants of the Fuehrer ( pardon all the spelling ) continuously going over past wars attempting to second guess Patton and kill both the British and Americans. I am intrigued as to whether this is a known fact of for purely 'motion picture' reasons ?
I will admit I didn't think the movie was all that good but I guess it wasn't a movie about war, rather a movie about the character of George Patton and his own battle within a war and how he himself overcame it with the help of his own troops.

1645822,5,B00005PJ8O,"PATTON is the combination of authentic biography and excellent war film-making. It engages in breath-taking character development of a prominent figure in American military history, and does so without romanticizing the character. Twenty-first century movie-goers will notice that some scenes betray the age of the picture, but its message is very much for our time.
Despite being filmed during the Vietnam War, PATTON does not feature the anti-war rhetoric that has handicapped almost every Hollywood war movie since. This movie concentrates on casting General George S. Patton as he really was -- an inspiring leader and a colorful character. Yet in doing so, it does not shy away from pointing out how the spicy language and gruff persona that so successfully spurred soldiers into battle often held him back in a world uncomfortable in grappling with larger-than-life individuals.
Here the myth is debunked that modern warfare tactics prevent the emergence of great men. PATTON provides a refreshing break from current revisionist trends among history academics that de-emphasize the role of individuals and dismiss the importance of military history in the affairs of humanity. While Patton certainly existed and was responsible for landmark Allied victories against the Nazis, Patton is the solid kind of figure a history professor in the average American university would try to hide from impressionable undergraduate students.
PATTON presents an interesting question to those of us in the modern world: we need men of war to win battles, but can we be tolerant of the military culture in times of peace? Patton's life suggested that the answer to this question was advancing towards the negative even in the 1940's. How farther popular culture in the West has gone in reinforcing this contempt for those that fight to defend our freedom! If a commanding officer in today's American military shared Patton's fire and unabashed cultural conservatism, would he have even made it to the rank of general?
In short, PATTON is an inspiring film about individualism in an age of increasing collectivism. In the famous Stars and Stripes scene, Patton says that ""Americans will not tolerate a loser."" Unfortuanately, Americans that adopt the political correctness of the 21st century are also becoming increasingly intolerant of the individual. But then again, Patton also made it clear that he was only talking about ""real Americans.""",1019260800,,2433,5.322077922077922

There is some German and French in the movie, but there are subtitles or someone translating for you.  There is not enough to detract from the movie, but there is enough to keep the movie authentic.
This was not a war movie meant to build up the general as larger than life.  Here, you see not only the fire of Patton, but the pathos of a man trying to succeed in a world that he wasn't born for.  In the movie, they point out that he seemed to be ready for the sixteenth century.  He also mentions that he was at many of the historical battles.  With his extensive reading, I do not doubt it.  Although he tries to play politics, he really isn't ready for it.  His forte is battle and seeing him held from it hurts the viewer as well as Patton.
I did like the ending of him walking his dog, but I was expecting the rest of the movie.  I do not know why it was omitted.

The true strength of the film, however, is the character of Patton.  A hard-nosed, determined man, Patton now serves as an inspiration to myself and many others who have seen this great movie.

Scott's deep voice better fits the profane and volcanic nature of the General, who was ""blessed"" with a high and squeaky voice!  A classic war film that provides great entertainment with each viewing.  That said, I must take exception with a reviewer who lauded the film's accuracy.  It is anything but historically accurate.  The overall timeline is correct, but anyone who has read a book on Patton (especially the ""Patton Papers"") will spot the dramatic license taken by the Hollywood producers.  Just to name a few: Patton knew that he would command Third Army before he left the Mediteranean for England.  In the film, he wasn't told until after D-Day!  Another: the entire exchange between Patton and Montgomery in Messina was fabricated; as was the competition between the two for Messina.

The name inspires respect, awe, reverence, and for some, FEAR.  The liberals of this world fear men like Patton because he was the epitome of masculinity, the apotheosis of brutality, the apostle of death, and the prophet of American victory in World War II. Liberals, as any one with common sense understands, are opposed to war, guns, death, no matter the circumstances. These pacificial neo-Chamberlain (...) lunatics would have us turn the other cheek at Bin-Laden's parade or horrors that were visited upon the good people of New York on Sept. 11.  Under their delusional reasoning that all war is quintessentially evil, it follows that our response to Japan's sneak attack on Pearl Harbor would have provoked similar outrage in these picket-carrying, flag-burning, country hating, bed-wetting, effiminate liberals.
 These zealots should watch Patton so that for once in their miserable lives they will encounter an authority figure who is the antethesis to the bedwetting liberal professors they are exposed to in the surrealistic world of academia. Not to say that liberal professors are all bad, its just that one can imagine the outcome of the Battle of the Bulge had it been fought by men who think like they do, that flag-burning, and singing 'koom ba ya' are appropriate alternatives to defending Nazi advances into Western Europe.

1645834,5,B00005PJ8O,"General George Patton was one of the greatest Americans.  Period.  That's why only a movie as good as this one could portray his greatness.
Patton is a three hour epic about the eccentric military genius, played by the great George C. Scott.  This is a typical ""man movie,"" filled with exciting action shots and plenty of bravado.  George C. Scott's Patton is charismatic, a bit crazy, and incredibly inspiring.  The film is very informative, and it solifdifies General Patton's reputuation as the only military commander feared and respected by the Nazis.
i didn't know much about Patton before watching this, but I feel like I have a pretty good understanding of him now.  The producers of the film set out to make this a biopic about General Patton and his colorful personality.  What resulted from their efforts, however, was a movie that glorified war more than any movie could.  Don't expect it to be like Saving Private Ryan, it's more of a romanticized look at one individual and a bygone era.
The DVD contains plenty of special features, including previews of other Fox war movies and a ""making of"" video.  I particularly enjoyed watching that, because of Oliver Stone's funny argument that ""Patton"" was the direct cause for the invasion of Cambodia.
If you're looking for history films, look no further than Patton.  It's quite a long film, but it takes that long to give justice to a man like General Patton.",1005177600,,1419,4.8264462809917354

1645845,4,B00005PJ8O,"This 1970 film directed by Franklin J. Schaffner and starring George C. Scott won eight Academy Awards.  It is the story of the famous General George Patton, one of the most successful and feared generals in WW2.  He believed in the glory of war and often quoted the classics, believing that he was reincarnated from some of history's most famous military leaders.  He cursed a lot and was, at the same time, deeply religious and there is no doubt that he cared about the men under his command. Relentless in battle, he believed in discipline and hated cowardice.  The press made a big thing about how he slapped a soldier who was crying, forcing Patton to make a public apology for that incident.
This was George C. Scott's greatest role and it is interesting to note that he refused his Academy Award for best actor because he did not feel himself to be in competition with other actors.  He was larger than life in every single scene of the 171 minute epic and came across as intended - stubborn and unlikable and a bit of a nut job.  I never could either admire or feel any empathy for him as a person although I was glad that he won the battles. However, in spite of the battle scenes as well as his frequent confrontations with authorities, I found myself bored.  Maybe this was because I knew that he would win the battles and therefore found little dramatic tension.  The video was much too long and I actually fell asleep several times.  I wanted to like the film better, but unfortunately couldn't.
I can't help thinking about the times in which this film hit the theaters. The Vietnam War was raging and there was a huge anti-war backlash.  Patton had to be considered the epitome of what was then called a ""hawk"" who raged about the glory of war in spite of the agony of the men who had fallen in battle.  This film was not just about WW2; it was about all war.  And it dared to glorify war itself without sugar coating it as fighting for what is right and mom's apple pie.  The appeal of the film was that it made people look at their own perceptions of war, a debate that was already on everyone's agenda.  Perhaps that it what made it so popular at the time.  It must have also played better on a big screen than my tiny TV. The film is important only for fans of war films, as it is a classic in that genre.  For all others, I can only give it a lukewarm recommendation.",1000598400,,2386,4.3521444695259595

Conversion of  the 1970 audio into the Dobly Digital 5.1 is not an easy trick.  The surround effects are simply spectacular!!  Matched with the clean film transfer of this feature, my VHS copy will just never do for the future. The audio dimensions and crisp video are better than I have ever seen this film.  Technically, this 'thirtysomething' year old feature most definitely has new life.
  The story of war and General George S. Patton is as fresh and relevant as the day this feature was released.  While the cinematography is certainly grand, there are some anachronisms that I find are easily forgiven given the epic proportions of this movie.

1645847,3,B00005PJ8O,"Hello, Patton is an excellent film covering several years in the life of one of the U.S. Armys most competent war fighting officers. I would like nothing less than to be able to give this film five stars, but there were two key faults with this product that prevent me from doing so. The first is a historical/technical detail that I simply couldn't over look, namely, the tanks and armored vehicles used in this movie are of a type that never were actually used during the second world war. This should not cause a problem for anyone watching the film for its acting and character qualities, but it really stood out blatantly to me and made it difficult for me to be drawn into the film as a World War II picture. This issue stood out even more to me because both the U.S. and German armies were using U.S. manufactured tanks and vehicles in this film (U.S. made M-47s and M-60s respectively I believe). Being a student of military hardware since childhood, seeing these tanks where history would have placed Shermans and Panzers or Tigers was very distracting. One point in the film that really pointed this issue out was when a U.S. halftrack drove past the burning wreckage of a German halftrack and the only difference between the two vehicles was the color of the paint! The second issue I had with this movie pertains to the DVD. During playback, the movie stuttered often and eventually would not play at all. I returned my disc and requested an exchange assuming I had gotten a bad disc. However, upon receipt of my replacement disc I noticed many of the same problems. Specifically, chapter selection from the main menu did not work on either of the discs. I have had no such problems with other DVD discs. All in all, though putting up with the poor playback and nonfunctional features of the DVD was annoying, and seeing armies composed of the wrong equipment was distracting, I still thoroughly enjoyed the film and am glad I own a copy of it to watch when ever I choose. (At this point, I need to put a plug in for my favorite WWII flick, Kellys Heroes, not a historically accurate work, but a hell of a lot of fun to watch!)",998611200,,2139,4.515463917525773

Patton and I have read many books about his life.  This movie is a great portrayal of his life.  However, it is important to know that the consultant for this movie was Gen Omar Bradley who had no love for Patton.
The opening speech of the film is, in my opinion, the greatest few minutes in movie history.  It's funny to note that as colorful as the language is in the opening speech, the director had to tone it down from Patton's original speech.  From this opening scene until the wonderful closing scene at the windmills this movie is perfect in every way.  The battle scenes are very good even if you consider that they were done in the 1970's, years prior to the computer generated special effects of today.

The same could be said for George C. Scott, who had the performance of a lifetime playing this role.  Karl Malden is perfect as General Bradley, the quiet, deliberate foil to the tempestuous and brash Patton.  The chemistry between these two actors truly makes the movie, which richly deserved to win an Academy Award for Best Picture.
The technical accuracy is good -- although some equipment isn't vintage (i.e., the tanks), some is (i.e., the very impressive German He-111 bombers).  The combat scenes are believable and well integrated into the plot.  No pointless special effects or violence in this movie.  The cinematography is beautifully executed, and everything is tied together with the haunting musical score.

1645866,5,B00005PJ8O,"""Patton"" offers one of the great marriages of actor and role with George C. Scott's riveting portrayal of the notorious American tank commander.  As a film biography ""Patton"" forgoes the rise of the celebrated general and merely hints at his ironic death because of injuries suffered in a traffic accident, focuses entirely on his military career commanding troops in North Africa, Sicily and France during World War II.  The strength of the script by Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North, as well as of Scott's performance, is that the paradoxes of Patton are completely embraced.  Not even Patton's loyal cadre of staff officers can keep him from shooting off his mouth every time there are reporters around, but then neither German Field Marshall Rommel or English Field Marshall Montgomery can beat him on the battlefield.  Karl Malden's performance as General Omar Bradley is just as solid as Scott's, presenting a man whose personality is the complete antithesis of Patton.  Viewers find themselves identifying with the German captain who is the intelligence expert on Patton and arguably the only person in the film who really understands or respects the American general.  But the more I watch ""Patton,"" the more I am very impressed with the battle sequences of director Franklin J. Schaffner (""Planet of the Apes,"" ""Pappillon""), which were staged live and full-scale without special effects of miniatures.  Schaffner provides not just the large spectacle of a desert tank battle, but smaller and equally memorable moments, such as a soldier falling dead in the snow.  ""Patton"" deserved its Oscars.
In terms of extra features on this DVD, the second disc features the 1997 50-minute retrospective documentary, ""The Making of Patton: A Tribute to Franklin J. Schaffner.""  Recent interviews with the cinematographer, composer, etc., are blended with audio interviews of Schaffner and Scott from 1970, newsreel footage of Patton, along with clips and publicity stills from the film make a fitting tribute to the late director.  The audio commentary on the first disc is really more of a lecture on Patton by Charles M. Province, the author of the book ""The Unknown Patton"" and founder/president of the General George S. Patton, Jr. Historical Society.  Province more than adequately fills in what the movie leaves out about Patton's life.  On the second disc Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar nominated musical score is presented in stereo, including alternate takes and a series of radio spots.  You certainly have to appreciate what Fox has put together here: This is a ""Special Edition"" DVD priced as a regular DVD, a real treat for those of us who remember being mesmerized by George C. Scott giving that profanity laced opening speech standing in front of that giant American flag.",991094400,,2785,5.148558758314856

Patton always has to be criticized for something (Slapping a soldier, criticizing the Russians, e.t.c). Patton believes in reincarnation; thinking that he was a soldier in past lives. In one scene, where Patton and Omar Bradley (Karl Malden) are at an ancient Greek battlefield, when Patton describes the battle he says, ""I was there"".

1645868,5,B00005PJ8O,"1970 hit movie and Best Picture academy award winner about General George S. Patton Jr. in World War II.  George C. Scott, bearing an uncanny resemblance to the famous general, portrays Patton from his entry into the war with II Armor Corps in North Africa to victory in Europe with the 3d Army.  Patton's triumphs and controversial incidents are covered in this feature and provide entertaining insight on this man whose name is almost synonymous with World War II.  While Patton rests in the elite ranks of other famous leaders, his flamboyant personality sets him apart from most and it is Scott's impressive capture of this that makes the movie shine.
The movie is generally accurate.  Patton is credited with taking command of the II Armor Corps at a critical time just after a brutal defeat to the German Army in North Africa, and leading it to victory shortly afterward.  Patton advances to command of the VII Army and is successful in Sicily.  During the Sicily operation, Patton slaps a soldier in a field hospital for perceived malingering, resulting in his relief from command.  Eventually he's reinstated to command of the 3d Army in France and leads the breakout from Normandy when Allied forces were bogged down in the infamous hedgerows.  The most famous event occurs when he anticipates the German's Ardennes Counter-offensive, more famously known as the ""Battle of the Bulge,"" and miraculously turns the 3d Army north in little time to defeat the Germans.
There's artistic overplay of some historical details for dramatic effect such as being portrayed as almost running operations by himself when in fact he had talented staff and commanders who advised him well and carried out his orders.  A very interesting scene for speculation is after his fuel supplies have been redirected in 1944 to the invasion of the Netherlands [portrayed in the 1976 feature ""A Bridge Too Far""] he is standing on the scorched earth of a recent tank battle and remarks to his aide that he could be in Berlin in ten days.
Overall an epic picture and one of a kind.  Other projects have attempted to follow this formula, but none came close to what was achieved in this movie.  Picture quality and sound are excellent and it's well worth adding to your personal DVD collection.",987552000,,2272,4.875324675324675

The audio emphasizes Patton's childhood, youth, and army career prior to the invasion of North Africa.
Finally, the DVD package includes a detailed chronology of Patton's career, with dates and locations.
Produced in 1970, this well-edited and spectacularly filmed biography is highly recommended for anyone interested in American history and World War II films.",984787200,,949,5.07051282051282

1645872,5,B00005PJ8O,"Patton is a sprawling three hour epic detailing the rise and fall of one the most famous military leaders in history, General George S. Patton.  Franklin J. Schaffner takes through the battlefields and war rooms of World War II in the African and European theaters with an eye for detail.  The opening scene where Patton addresses his troops in front of an enormous American flag sets the tone for the film and is chilling.  The war scenes are intense and we get a sense of Patton must have been like.  George C. Scott is absolutely amazing as Patton.  He delivers the finest performance of his distinguished career.  He portrays Patton as a crazed genius, but he doesn't go over the top with it.  He plays it with a controlled madness and avoids making Patton into some sort of characture.  Mr. Scott won the 1970 Best Actor award for which he famously refused to accept.  Mr. Schaffner won Best Director and the film was awarded the Best Picture statuette.",980899200,,958,4.654761904761905

Like a handful of other films have, ""Patton"" captures the chaos, the heroism and the personalities of WWII.  George C. Scott's performance as Patton is a masterpiece; it ranks among the great performances by a leading man in the history of Hollywood.  The fact that he accomplished this while staying true to an historical figure is all the more remarkable.
Overall, this movie does a wonderful job of telling the story of a great American.  Normally, I would give it five stars.  However, there are some nagging historical innacurcies.  Also, the film is colored somewhat by the fact that General Omar Bradely served as a consultant on the film, in spite of the fact that he pretty much hated Patton and was jealous of his abilities.

1645888,5,B00005PJ8O,"Timeless in its depiction of War, and mimicked time and time again in its portrayal of a Hero, Patton stands as one of the finest movies ever to grace the screen, and sadly, one that will never get the ""re-release"" life breathed into it that far less remarkable footage has be allowed.
It cannot be said enough, the performance of George C. Scott in this film is the single greatest reason for its greatness.  To add the stunning locations through Europe, and the grand scale of the battle footage, the wonderful supporting cast...Including Karl Malden as Gen. Omar Bradley, a performance inspired after meeting the Technical consultant of the Film, Gen. Bradley himself...the score, the story together create a story worth seeing, owning, and retelling over and over again.
The building up and tearing down of a military genius as he faces his destiny the only way he knows how, and the stark realization that the Politically Correct morality that has shackled out nation today can find its roots in even the most harsh of times.  Patton sought only to wage war on his enemies the best way he knew how, and had he been given that ability, one can only wonder at the differences we would see in the world today.
Never a feel good movie, and not just for ""guys who like movies"" This is a movie for everyone, for the message is universal.  What that message is, only the viewer can know.",973296000,,1385,4.644897959183673

Patton, commander of the US 3rd Army was instrumental in the collapse of Germany's Western front, and few would argue the 3rd Army was most effective combat force in the ETO.  The German General Staff feared and respected Patton, while they laughed at Montgomery, his British contemporary and competitor.  Patton was no ordinary 20th century warrior, he frequently drew from ancient history for inspiration for his battle plans.  Patton took the whole Blitzkrieg(lightning war) concept from Guderian, and took it to the next level.  Patton ranks as one of the most colorful and complex personalities of the Second World War.

1645890,5,B00005PJ8O,"""Patton"" is one of the best and most honored war films of all  time. (8 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, 1970.) I first saw this  magnificent movie in the summer of 1970, and have since then viewed it  countless numbers of time on videocassette. It remains to this day one of  my one of my all-time favorite films of any genre! It faithfully tells the  story of General George S. Patton, one of the most colorful and  controversial military leaders in American history. Patton is imbued with  superb acting, an excellent screenplay, reasonably good historical  accuracy, and some of the most authentic and stirring battle scenes I've  ever seen in a movie.

Based upon General of the Army Omar N. Bradley's  memoirs ""A Soldier's Story,"" and the book ""Patton: Ordeal  and Triumph"" by Ladislas Farago, this film chronicles Patton's  military career from early 1943, when he assumed command of the U.S. Army  II Corps, to his relief from command of the Third Army in late 1945. Many  of the most important events in Patton's checkered career are covered in  some detail: his resurrection of II Corps after its disastrous defeat by  the Germans at Kasserine Pass in the North African desert; II Corps'  subsequent victory, under his leadership, over units of Rommel's Afrika  Corps at El Qatar; Patton's command of the U.S. Seventh Army during the  Sicily campaign, and his slapping of an army private suffering from battle  fatigue; his relief from command, and his attempts to extricate himself  from possibly being sent home in disgrace; and, his leadership of the Third  Army, where he led the Allied drive across France and into Germany in one  of the most successful campaigns in U.S. military history.

Patton's  penchant for ""putting his foot in his mouth"" proved his ultimate  undoing. As World War II ended, and the victorious allies began to reward  their successful generals with promotions and honors, Patton was relieved -  yet again - from a military command for his ill advised remarks, and for  his failure to adhere to U.S. government de-Nazification policies.

The  acting in Patton is superb throughout. George C. Scott certainly deserved  the Best Actor Academy Award he won (but refused) for his portrayal of  Patton. He dominates nearly every scene with his brilliant portrayal of  ""Old Blood and Guts."" Scott's ""Patton"" is a man of  masks. For example, in the opening scenes, we see Patton the stone-faced,  profane, passionate warrior, a man bent on intimidating nearly everyone  around him to his implacable will for victory. During his exile from  command, Patton dons the mask of contrite penitent; and during his drive  through France, Patton becomes a buddy to the common soldiers who made up  Third Army.

Karl Malden portrays General Omar Bradley, and gives  probably his best performance of any film in which I've seen him. He imbues  Bradley's character with the great intellectual ability, down-to-earth  ""common soldier"" demeanor, and no-nonsense approach in dealing  with Patton (both as subordinate and superior) for which Bradley is noted  by historians. Other performances of note include: Michael Bates as the  vain, priggish Montgomery; Paul Stevens as Patton's sycophantic aide  Charles Codman; and Edward Binns as the gruff, testy General Walter Bedell  Smith.

 Because of the gorgeous photography throughout the film, I highly  recommend viewing Patton in widescreen format. The difference between  widescreen and TV formatting, either on DVD or VHS, is astounding.

Patton  is a movie which will hold the viewer spellbound start to finish, mainly  due to the dramatic intensity of Scott's and Malden's performances, and the  realistic battle scenes. This outstanding film is one to be savored by  anyone who loves a sumptuously produced and well acted war movie.",968803200,,3812,5.123980424143556
1645891,5,B00005PJ8O,"Before this movie, very few people knew who Patton was. When it came out,  I didn't know anything about this forocious madman. If you haven't seen it  at least ten times, then you are missing something. Scott dominates the  whole movie, of course, as Patton. A fierce fighting Amercian General in  World War II. So much so, in fact, that after the U.S. entered the war, the  Germans divided the Allied Forces into two groups. ""Patton"" and  ""Other"". An aide of Patton's wrote a biography of his commander  and recommeded this movie as a distinct example of how Patton actually was!  A little understanding might enhance your enjoyment of the film after you  buy it from Amazon.com. ""Georgie"", as his close friends called  him, was a bit of a child prodigy. In fact, you can leave out the  ""prodigy"" in some cases and leave it at ""child"". He was  no doubt the most brillant general in World War II. In fact, he was slated  in this position when war broke out. Chief-of -Staff, General Marshall,  liked him generally. Ike was his buddy until things got out of hand. Watch  a man whole simply has everything it takes to end a war but he has one  simple flaw. The ability to be diplomatic and political. You will see how  one man can outguess, out-think, out-do, any other general. But his energy  has to be, sometimes ruthlessly, harnessed in order for him not to destroy  the political structure of his own country's offensive. We all ultimately  believe in Patton's view. Just get the job over with whether it be washing  dishes, mowing the lawn, or conducting the war. FDR and Ike were masters of  the other side of the coin. Shake hands with people you dispise. Befriend  those whom you have absolutely nothing in common with except mutual gain.  Cooperate with a country whose sole purpose is to dominate the world, and  proved that fact through the invasion of Norway before our entry. It's hard  to identify with a man who worships war. But I think that if we do so, we  might more actually perceive the smiling wolves who provided an arena of  pretense for the entire world. Side with Georgie and then vote in November.  Georgie couldn't abide the ""greasy spoon"" mentality of his  political comrades.  Perhaps you won't either after viewing this film  through a pair of glasses with clean lens.

1645892,5,B00005PJ8O,"This is a superb film in every way. George C. Scott did more than act. He was Patton! Right down to the look, mannerisms and speech. This movie was drawn from the book by Ladislas Farago and is pretty accurate given the  timeframe of the movie. Patton was one of the most brilliant, eccentric,  and egotistical generals ever. He was a pure warrior and didn't seem to fit  in with the politcal aspects and complexities of the Allied alliance. A  devout historian, he was noted for using the same strategies used by past  military greats. The soldier slapping incident was a real tragedy in the  sense that how many more lives could've been saved had the Allies not  sidelined their best general and allowed him to run rampant to bring the  war to a quick end. Karl Malden does an excellent job as Omar Bradley and  is a fine compliment to Scott's Patton.

1645893,5,B00005PJ8O,"""Patton"" is the story of General George Patton, a complex man who was religious and profane at the same time.  This film isn't a biography of Patton, but it does show him during WWII.  Franklin Schaffner  portrays Patton in a more objective manner than usual with this type of  film.  This is one of the few films where you will like and dislike the  main character at the same time.
On to the DVD.  The picture quality is  excellent, but there is some age evident in the print used.  This is an  early 16:9 enhanced disc by Fox, though the packaging does not indicate so.  There is a tad too much edge enhancement and it annoyed me, but it isn't  terribly intrusive.
The sound is a remixed DD 5.1 track.  The surrounds  get quite a bit of use, but don't expect ""Saving Private Ryan""  type sound here.  The soundtrack sounds a bit dated, and the ADR sounds  obvious when it appears.
On Disc One, an audio essay by a Patton  historian is included and runs about 81 minutes.  It is not screen  specific, nor is it a commentary, so kudos to Fox for not saying that it  is.  Trailers for ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" ""Patton,"" and  ""The Longest Day"" are included also.  A French mono track and  Spanish subtitles are included.
Disc Two contains a documentary on the  filming of ""Patton"" which runs about 50 minutes.  It was included  on a previous LaserDisc release of the film, but given that it is on a  separate disc, they could have lengthened it.  An option to play the  isolated score from ""Patton"" is included, which will run over the  documentary if selected.  Only about 30 minutes of the film were scored, so  including the isolated score on Disc One would have left a lot of silence  during passages.
Fox has a winner on their hands with ""Patton,""  with its good video/audio quality and fairly good extras.  Dissmissed!",964137600,,1817,4.496913580246914
1645894,5,B00005PJ8O,"There is plenty here about the quality of the movie, arguably the best of all WWII movies ever made. What compelled me to write a review is how Fox treated this Library of Congress designated """"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" film (and hence its being archived by them also.)

I don't know what Fox did to keep this film in such pristine condition but other studios should take note. This movie looks as good as the day it opened at the movie theaters in 1970. There are no scratches, fading, or any other way to distinguish this movie from one shot in 2008, the year of its Blu-Ray release. The Blu-Ray treatment is jaw dropping. During Patton's famous opening speech you can see sweat beads on George C. Scott't neck. WOW

On top of the absolutely stunning video quality, Fox released a documentary on Patton (the man) that is worth the price by itself. It gives probably the closest look at Patton ever put on film with home movies, photos and input from family and an aide to General Bradley. Its outstanding. There is also an intro by the writer, Frances Ford Coppolla that is interesting.

If you liked Patton before, you will love this release by Fox, it is by far the best treatment of this historically significant film. If there was an academy award for Blu-Ray presentation, Fox would deserve one.",963619200,,1332,4.708154506437769
1645895,5,B00005PJ8O,"When this movie was released, it was almost immediately recognized as one of the finest, most accurate and most sensational biographies ever filmed. The unique integration in ""Patton"" of such fine acting, such a wonderful  script, and the filming itself combined to make this a gorgeous film to  watch, be entertained with, and also learn from in terms of its historical  value as an absolutely superb depiction of a most controversial man and his  times. All that said, this is a movie best enjoyed with the kind of visual  clarity, terrific cinematography, and matchlessTechnicolor it offers by  way of DVD technology.

George C. Scott gives the performance of a  lifetime as the ego-drive, brilliant, and iconoclastic Patton, marvel of  the U.S Army, a man the Germans are convinced is far and away the single  best General the Allies have, and they watch him convinced he is the only  logical centerpiece for American plans for the impending invasion of  Europe.  Of course, they didn't understand the politics of the day, or the  degree to which Patton was his own worst enemy. Yet the progress of the  story on the screen convinces the viewer of the accuracy of the German  command's judgments of him; he is at once bold, brilliant, and innovative,  willing to improvise as he goes along to seize the opportunity of a given  moment, attempting to grab hold of the ever-present chaos of the situation  to transform it into an asset he can employ to gain advantage and win the  engagement.

Such men as Patton (and MacArthur and others) are uniquely  suited for war; they do not ordinarily fare well or survive with much  public acclaim during less extreme and bloodcurdling times. The fact that  Eisenhower, for example, succeeded so well as President is probably due  more to the fact that he was less a battlefield commander and leader of  ""desperate men in combat"" like Patton than he was a superb organizer and a  natural politician. The movie ""Patton"" is an investment in both  great entertainment and a colorful, dramatic, and educational video you can  share with your sons and daughters to help them understand better the  chaos, contradictions, and cruelties of war.

1645905,5,B00005PJ8O,"World War II produced a long array of military stars, i.e. MacArthur, Eisenhower, Bradley, Clark, Nimitz, Montgomery, Rommel, etc. But for sheer animal magnetism and bravado, none could overshadow Gen. George  Patton.
What endeared Gen. Patton to his troops was his willingless to  expose himself to the line of enemy fire, unlike other ""office  generals"". That he pushed his troops almost beyond the limit of human  endurance is without question. But that could be excused by his belief that  aggressiveness in the battlefield saves more human lives in the long run  and hastens the end of the war.
George Scott's portrayal of Gen. Patton  was of monumental proportion, it was an actor in his element. From the  general's gentle side and diplomatic tact when he was in his best behavior  to his thunderous, manic explosion when he was at the height of his fury,  Scott got it all! No one could have done a better job portraying the  unpredictable, egoistical, brilliant general.
The realistic recreation of  battle scenes and the accurate depiction of war characters, like Gen. Omar  Bradley and others, make this film a must for historians and history buffs  alike, and put this film in the list of best war movies ever made.

1645908,5,B00005PJ8O,"""Patton"" is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I once watched it three times in the same day, I love it so much.  What makes this movie more than just another war movie is George C. Scott.  His Patton is  so engrossing that you cannot take your eyes off him.  The performance  shows ego unleashed and unchecked by any bonds of modesty or conscience.  While I certainly wouldn't like the man that is portrayed, you get an  understanding of him that is more complete than any charachter in any other  movie.  This is the fully realized man, both monster and hero at the same  time.  Only Scott could have given this performance, and without him the  movie would have been decent at best.  With Scott, this should easily make  everyone's top 100 list--despite the fact that ranking movies is idiocy  itself.  As I implied, it is the single most dynamic and engaging  performance I have ever seen, or will ever see.",938131200,,916,4.515337423312883

1645910,5,B00005PJ8O,"This film was outstanding. I've seen it 5 times and I still can't get enough of it. George C. Scott gives not only the best proformance of his life he gives the absolute best proformance you will ever see. To quote my  personal favorite line form the movie  ""when you look down in a  puddle of goo that a moment ago was your friends face you'll know what to  do.""
This movie is a definite must see. Even if you don't like war  movies watch it just to see Scott's spectacular porformance as General  George S. Patton. Yes his porformance is that good!",915926400,,550,4.29126213592233
