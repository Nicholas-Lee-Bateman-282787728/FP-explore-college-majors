6208230,5,B00HUAGZKW,"When I retired and suddenly found myself taking a few falls, it dawned on me that if I wanted to live a while longer and avoid breaking bones, I'd better start strengthening my core and long muscles in order to increase my balance and control.  I have long appreciated Ms. Cappy's ""Yoga for the Rest of Us"" but I knew my knees and ankles lacked the strength to protect me from injury. This tape is the ticket.  I've been doing this Yoga workout for only a short time, but can already tell the difference.

With two students who reinforce the poses you are involved in the routines and relaxing.  This particular disc dwells on breathing and balance - two procedures I find especially important in my senior years (especially proper breathing).  I have really gotten much help in yoga - didn't realize how helpful it would be.  Ms. Cappy demystifies and she is an excellent teacher - patient and abundantly clear while explaining/illustrating each pose.  No rush, just a great relaxing experience which I look forward to repeating daily.  HIghly recommended to anyone (particularly) seniors who need help in these two areas.

It would have been nice if there was a separate section on the dvd where the name of each pose was given along with a demonstration of each so those of us new to Yoga could practice them prior to beginning the actual workout.  Also, there were several times during the sun poses section when you couldn't see the other 2 teachers at all because the camera was zoomed in only on Peggy making it impossible to continue following the routine of the other teachers during that time.

6208506,5,B00HUAGZKW,"I saw Peggy on the local public television station and really like it and what the people that were with her said. I was looking for a low impact yoga video to help me. I got this from Amazon and really do like it. Peggy illustrates how to do the stretches with someone standing, someone using a chair for support, and someone sitting in a chair. It is definitely for everyone looking for a good workout.",1436486400,,404,4.328947368421052
6208507,5,B00HUAGZKW,With Peggy Cappy's dvds you can do as much of the yoga as your body allows. Each time you will find yourself just doing a little more  and before you know it you'll find yourself completing all of the segments. I find that Peggy's yoga tapes are the best to work with for me. She explains the movements and gives you alternatives. From there you work at your own speed and ability. I highly reccomend this dvd.,1436400000,3,410,4.324675324675325

It is divided up into sections and you don't need to do all the sections everyday.
There are a couple of parts that are confusing, but keep at it, and eventually it will make sense!
What I REALLY like, is that you don't have to get out an exercise mat and can do the exercises, either in a chair or standing up!
I saw Peggy Cappy on a PBS special. If this is being shown in your area, take a look at the show. She really knows what she is doing.

I have been doing various 2 sections of this DVD, maybe 3 or 4 times a week. Sometimes I wondered why.
When I vacuumed, my shoulder would hurt. Today, I vacuumed and no pain!
It had to be this DVD!

Her videos also show students doing the exercises on the floor for those without issues. This one really gets the kinks out in a gentle manner. Be sure to watch and listen to the entire DVD to get the most benefit...don't skip the relaxation pose at the end!

To use this on a routine basis, the cover says that it is 76 minutes long- I think to run through the poses would be about a half hour or so.",1419465600,164,494,4.26595744680851

6208693,5,B00HUAGZKW,"I have never been very flexible and my balance needed some help as I got older.  This yoga program is just what I needed.  I have many yoga dvd's I watched, couldn't do and just threw in the back of a drawer.  Not so with this one - it is a keeper for me.  It takes about one hour and 15 minutes to go through the entire program but, once you are familiar with the various sections, that is what I think is best to do.  It starts with breathing, stretching, then balance and strength and ends with relaxation.  All these sections are important so I do them all each time.
Peggy gives very explicit instructions along the way so it is very easy to follow.  She also goes at a pace that is slow enough to do the poses properly.  This would definitely be best for beginners or older people as young and flexible people will find it slow and too easy I am sure.  For me, it is still a challenge but I can see improvement after only about a month of doing it once a week.  I do tai chi, stretching and meditation daily so that is why I only do it once a week.  For those who have no other practices they do, I would think that two or three times a week would be better.

6208749,5,B00HUAGZKW,"I've had what I think is Peggy's original, Yoga for the rest of us, for quite some time, and really like it. I thought maybe this one would have a bit of someth diff, which it does. She goes a bit slower in this one, which I like, esp on those sun salutations. In the first one I have, I never did quite get it, as she went so fast. She seems very patient, has a soothing encouraging voice.  Not so much explaining before each one in this, which is nice. That got to be old, esp when using for years on end. I'd be standing there waiting, like please, let's get on with it ! This one has just a touch of really soft, calming music, which I like. The other has none, that's ok too.  This one seems to go longer on some, and all together, I got really tired and had to stop til the next day after 35 min. On the other one, I could make it thru the 45 min, or whatever.  There are a couple places in this where it doesn't show what the man on the chair is doing til the last, then it's too late.
I Miss the old gang in the first one !  I was hoping at least some would be the same. 'Course, it's been awhile. The man in this one looks uncomf rather than relaxed. This one only has Peggy and 2 other people, the first has 6 maybe ?  I don't like Peggy's hair in this one, I like it a bit longer, curlier  and a bit lighter color. Of course, that's me ! But if we have to see her, it does affect us, esp if we  use it for years and years, which I would hope is taken into consideration. The overall quality, is excellent !  I'd love to have one where you show how to get up from the floor easily please. Thank you.",1408147200,,1609,3.8545454545454545

I love her gentle, respectful approach and the philosophy she articulates throughout her programs. She has a voice and a presence that are calming. I had previously seen this particular yoga program on public television. As a person who is aging, I am concerned about sustaining as much balance and strength as possible for as long as possible.
