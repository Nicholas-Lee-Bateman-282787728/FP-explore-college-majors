8164623,5,B000LW7PDM,"I found this at a local drug store for only $6 and bought it just ""in case"" it had some redeeming value.  My four year old has been obsessed with space for 2 years.  He loves the shuttle.  He has no attention span for regular animated movies but loves this one.  It is heavily detailed and narrated by a child.  It is easy to understand.  All of the adults love it too and learned plenty!  It makes me sorry that the shuttle program is ending.  Finding things about space has been difficult and this was definitely a ""find.""",1293840000,,524,4.275510204081633
8164624,5,B000LW7PDM,This movie is the best for kids. It's educational and fun. It caters to a child's mind in a way they can understand and learn and have fun while doing it. A product like that rates an A+ in my book. My son is three and would watch this as many times a day as I would let him!,1228089600,3,275,3.6779661016949152
8164625,5,B000LW7PDM,"This video has sparked a revolution in our home! My four year old daughter is now deeply interested in space and NASA, and has a deep understanding that shocks adults. We have a couple of other space videos, but this one is the best by far! We have gone on to books, toys, and field trips to air and space museums, not to mention the costumes and hours of pretty accurate fantasy play. This video was the catalyst. My husband and I love it too and learned a lot from it. I recommend it highly.",1218499200,5,493,4.2
