534707,1,6303002889,This event is defiatly not worth the price of $60. Although it is better in spanish the matches are lame. This is the only choice of Fall Brawl  because you don't have to listen to the annoying comentators throughout the  entine event.,965606400,,235,4.571428571428571

534741,5,6303002889,This was a great Pay per view The 6 man tag match was a good match the best match was the natrul born thrillerz VS the filthy animals the only problem was paul orndorgh getting hurt it should have lasted longer. The three way dance was a great match vamperio did a number on sting. The world title match was also a good match booker T was the person that i saw to make kevin nash bleed.

534742,5,6303002889,"I have seen alot of wcw ppv's,but this one had to be one of the best. The Kevin Nash vs. Booker T match was ok,but the scaffold match was the best. The fall that Madusa took was awesome. If you have not seen this ppv you have to buy it. It is worth that kind of money.",1023235200,,268,3.719298245614035
534743,5,6303002889,"Man there are just some things in wrestling that you've just GOTTA have.  This is one of them, no it isn't Rude and Flair, no its not the Stinger or the Stiener, or even the Steamboat, give up??? It's the Shockmaster, the worst idea in the history of WCW.  This tape must be owned as long standing proof of the travisty WCW's creative writers put forth.  Durning the main event the ""SHOCKMASTER"" who by the way is Tugboat/Typhoon form the WWF bursts threw the a paper projection board (high cost props-WCW only goes for the best you know) and promptly falls down or trips and his mask(a classic star wars storm-trooper helmet covered in glitter) falls off and he scurries to get it before it rolls off the ramp.  He puts it back on and even Jesse the body can't help but make a comment about the fumble.  And then he gets up and points at the ring and a prerecorded message yells something that starts in-""YOUUUUUUU!!!"" and ends with ""SHOCKMASTER!!!!""  I never got past this part I just couldn't stop laughing.  Buy this for this alone.",1009584000,,1036,4.508021390374331
534744,3,6303002889,"That title says it all. if you're an old school WCW fan and want to see the last Vader/Sting match on PPV, this is it so far as I know, and it's a great match.  Also, if you want to see exactly where WCW truly died, this is the spot.  Foley leaves.  Steamboat is forced into retirement with an injure and Steve Austin loses to Jim Duggan in 7 seconds.  Anyone who didn't see a self-destructing promotion after that is blinder than Stevie Wonder.",1000598400,,445,4.261904761904762
534745,4,6303002889,The Good matches were TV Title between Badd and Regal and Bagwell and Patriot and Bvagwell Vs Pretty Wonderful for the Tag Straps. The Triangle bout was so bad Sting couldn't save it. The most brutal match of the night went to the Career match between Sullivan and Cactus Jack.,998352000,,277,4.56
534746,4,6303002889,"Most of the matches were good. Steamboat and Regal put on a  classic for the TV Belt. The Wargames match was brutal,Dustin Rhodes by the end of it was a Bloody mess. The Nasty Boys made their Return to WCW and won the tag belts.by the Way,the Wargames match was way better than the 98 one.",998352000,,289,4.160714285714286
534747,3,6303002889,"I'm not a big wcw fan but I did like this event. The Goldberg and Steiner match was the best match on this tape. The Pittsburgh Plunge Match wasn't good at all!  The falls were so fake with mudusa landing on some kind of cushon, I know it is all fake but that is the worst fall I have seen. Other then this one match this is event is worth watching.",987033600,,349,3.915492957746479
534748,1,6303002889,"Steamboat vs Regal is excellent and proves that few are on Steamer's level when it comes to psychology.
The rest is boring tripe.  This is my cure for insomnia tape.  You see, the results of this show were leaked by TV tapings that took place months prior, so no one put forth an effort.  We have HORRID never-wases like Charlie Norris, Big Sky (although he rocked in X-Men, but it was mostly the costume), Ice Train, and Yoshi Kwan.  We have the Nasty Boys put on just about the most boring display of ""wrestling"" I have ever seen.  They spend 27 of the 30 minutes of the match resting.  I kid you not.  Rude vs Flair looks god on paper, but the match was ALL ARMBAR, BABY!  War Games was quite horrible and only existed to get infamous flop The Shockmaster over.  It would have been the worst War Games if not for the Warrior and Hogan messing up the 1998 edition.  Turner was kind enough not to release that event on commercial video in North America.  If only Fall Brawl 93 would have suffered the same fate.
Strong recommendation to avoid unless you have trouble sleeping and don't have access to strong enough drugs.",980640000,2,1122,4.424390243902439
534749,4,6303002889,PROBLLY ONE OF THE WCWS BEST OF THE YEAR THE BEST MATCH WAS BOOKER T. VS KEVIN NASH,978480000,3,83,3.6666666666666665
7834420,5,6303002889,I have this movie you guy want me to put it on amazon this was a good ppv of wcw fall brawl 2000  Steiner vs goldberg and more  just let me know by posting at amazon,1418515200,,165,3.5555555555555554
7834421,3,6303002889,"Poor Booker T. He's given the sweet seat and acquits himself well as champion and the booking destroys his run in a very short period of time. By the time he loses the belt to Steiner in November, fans didn't care about him anymore because he wasn't treated like the top guy should be.

Here, Booker T reclaims his title from Kevin Nash in a short, mediocre Cage match. There isn't a whole lot to say about an 8 minute match where the cage is barely factored in. There were a ton of matches on this show and most of them were listless or so irrelevant that they make no impact at all; even the usual crowd favorites like Sting and Kronik couldn't get things going.

There are some bright spots: Mike Awesome and Jeff Jarrett has an entertaining bunkhouse brawl, Three Count and the Misfits in Action had a strong six man tag, and Scott Steiner took on Goldberg is a brutal, physical match of the night. It's one of the best of both men's careers.

The worst part of the night was watching Paul Orndorff get injured and the watching the match go on before someone had the decency to stop the bout. It's uncomfortable to watch even knowing Paul's injury wasn't life threatening.
Even though there aren't a ton of memorable matches, I still enjoyed this event more than, say, Slamboree or Uncensored. Plus, Steiner/Goldberg is truly excellent.",1407024000,,1340,4.551867219917012
7834422,4,6303002889,"1.) WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match: Kwee Wee w/Paisley vs Elix Skipper w/Major Gunns

A decent Cruiserweight match to open the show with Elix Skipper, representing Team Canada putting his title on the line against Kwee Wee. 1 or 2 botched moves here and there. Natural Born Thrillers' Mike Sanders interferes near the end of the match and attacks Kwee Wee with a kendo stick. Elix takes advantage and hits the Overdrive on Kwee Wee to retain the title. Not the best of matches to open a PPV

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) 3 Count (Shannon Moore, Evan Karagias, and Shane Helms) vs The Misfits In Action (Cpl. Cajun, Lt. Loco, and Sgt. AWOL)

A match featuring 2 of WCW's goofiest Tag Teams. A solid and fun Tag Team match with a lot of high flying action from both teams, especially 3 Count. Many people may have hated 3 Count, but they were very talented and exciting to watch in the ring. Cpl Cajun gets the pinfall win for his team with a Whiplash 2000 on Shane Helms

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) First Blood Chain Match: The Harris Brothers vs Kronik

This was a Tornado Tag Team match, to try and make the match more interesting to watch but it didn't work. Nothing exciting really going on in this match. The referee gets knocked down towards the end. Ron Harris bleeds first but the referee never saw it when he came to. Brian Adams gets nailed with a baseball bat that looks like its wrapped in barbed wire before getting pummeled with a chain. The referee sees Brian bleeding and rings the bell. Harris Brothers win this lackluster match

4.) WCW US Championship Match: Lance Storm (c) w/Major Gunns vs General Rection  (Outside Enforcer: Hacksaw Jim Duggan)

Before the match, Storm cuts a great heel promo about how great Canada is. Great promo but unfortunately, Storm never had the charisma to truly get his promos where they could've been. Another seemingly lackluster match. The only noteworthy thing about this match was Duggan's heel turn and joining Team Canada, which probably could've been seen a mile away, considering how notorious WCW was for turning superstars heel. Duggan knocks out General Rection with the 2x4 while the referee's back is turned and Storm applies the Maple Leaf on a ko'd Rection for the win. MIA comes out to try and save General Rection at the end but  they all get beat down by Hacksaw.

5.) Elimination Tag Team Match: Natural Born Thrillers (Mark Jindrak, Sean O'Haire, Chuck Palumbo, Shawn Stasiak, Reno, Johnny the Bull Stamboli, and Mike Sanders) vs Filthy Animals (Disco Inferno, Rey Mysterio, Juventud Guerrera, and Konnan w/Tygress),Vito, and Paul Orndorff

What possessed WCW to bring Paul Orndorff on-screen for a match? This PPV was in September 2000 and Orndorff hadn't been relevant since the 80s. The match itself was an interesting and fun one to watch, but making Orndorff a part of this match brought it down a bit. Referee Charles Robinson stops the match after Orndorff injures his neck with his own piledriver on Jindrak. See? Putting him in the match was a bad idea. So basically the match goes to a no contest because of Orndorff's injury. Lame way for the match to end

A backstage pre-match interview with Billy Kidman and Madusa. Kidman promises to throw Shane Douglas off the scaffold. Madusa goes crazy and threatens to do the same to Torrie

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) Tag Team Scaffold Match: Torrie Wilson and Shane Douglas vs Madusa and Billy Kidman

Douglas cuts a promo before Kidman and Madusa come out but I was too busy looking at Torrie to pay attention to what he was saying. This match goes nowhere. Ends with Torrie getting a low blow in on Kidman and Douglas tossing Kidman off the top of the scaffold. Torrie and Douglas climb down the ladder to win the match

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

Sting is backstage cutting a pre-match promo on Dark Carnival when he's attacked from behind by Jeff Jarrett for no apparent reason. Then we're shown a weird recorded segment of Mike Tenay visiting David Flair's house who asks him about the wedding where he was left at the altar by Stacy Keibler and having Stacy admit to him that he wasn't the father of her baby. David is depressed and losing his mind as his place is covered in trash, newspapers, and pizza. He's paranoid and runs outside and attacks the mailman, thinking he's the father of Stacy's baby. In case you don't know, the original route for this storyline was for Ric Flair to be revealed as the father. At one point, Vince Russo even considered making himself the father. Thank goodness this storyline never went anywhere

7.) Vampiro vs Great Muta vs Sting

The ICP clowns take over the commentary desk and commentate with Mark Madden for duration of the match. This was a rather short match that saw Muta and Vampiro work over Sting for most of this short bout. In the end, Sting hits Muta with his bat and hits the Scorpion Death Drop on him for the win. Muta gets attacked by Dark Carnival after the match and Sting makes the save

Mike Awesome gets off of his 70s bus and tries to pick up on Pamela Paulshock and introduces Gary Coleman as his special guest

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

8.) Bunkhouse Brawl: Jeff Jarrett vs Mike Awesome

Not too bad of a hardcore type match that gets close to 10 minutes. Near the end, after one too many insults, the Buffalo Bills hit the ring and attack Jarrett. Follow this up with an interference and attack from Gary Coleman and an another interference from Sting who interferes and hits the Scorpion Death Drop on Jarrett. After all this Awesome picks up the scraps and pins Jarrett for the win. The match started off good but got pretty ridiculous at the end with all the interferences

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

9.) No Disqualifications: Goldberg vs Scott Steiner

The build-up for this match was great. After Goldberg Jackhammered Steiner's freak, Midajah through a table, Scott got revenge by attacking Goldberg's girlfriend and placing her in the Steiner Recliner. Steiner had to wrestle with a mask due to Goldberg supposedly injuring his face with a lead pipe, leading up to the PPV. Great, solid, and exciting No DQ match to view. With Goldberg and Steiner being brutal wrestlers, this one was bound to be...well....brutal! Goldberg flat out dominates Steiner for the first few minutes of the match but Steiner fights back with a steel chair, busting Goldberg open. Midajah comes to the ring with a lead pipe. Russo interferes and attacks Goldberg with a pipe of his own. Midajah and Russo both attack Goldberg with pipes but Goldberg kicks out of Steiner's pin following the attacks. In the end, the numbers game is too much for Goldberg to keep up with. Steiner nails Goldberg with a pipe and locks on the Steiner Recliner. Goldberg is out and Steiner wins the match. I could've done without Russo interfering but yet it still worked.

10.) WCW World Championship Steel Cage Match: Booker T vs Kevin Nash (c)

During the time when Nash had some control over booking, he booked himself as WCW World Champion (go figure). The match lasts under 10 minutes and seems more fitted to be a main event for Nitro. Back and forth action with the winner meeting Sting the next night on Nitro. Booker ends up busting Nash open near the end of the match. Booker wins the match with a Book End on Nash to win the title in a decent main event match.

Overall: Not a bad Fall Brawl. Most matches delivered although there were a few matches that could've used some improvement in booking and performance. Nonetheless it doesn't take away that overall it was nicely put together PPV. Too bad more WCW PPVs couldn't be that way in its final days",1398124800,,8917,5.596582466567607
7834423,3,6303002889,"The Crusierweight title between Elix Skipper & Kwee Wee was not great but pretty good and the same goes the 6 man tag team match between The Misfits In Action(Cpl. Cajun,Lt. Loco & Sgt. AWOL) & 3 Count(Shannon Moore,Evan Karagias & Shane Helms). The First Blood/Chain match between The Harris Brothers(Don & Ron) & Kronik(Brian Adams & Bryan Clark) was a pretty good/solid brawl. The US Title match between Lance Storm & General Rection was so-so at best. The 14 person tag team elimination match was slow & long ""at best"" and the same goes for the mixed Scaffold team match between the team of Shane Douglas & Torrie Wilson against the team of Billy Kidman & Madusa. The Sting-Vampiro-Great Muta 3 way dance was pretty much a 2-on-1 hanicap match. The Mike Awesome-Jeff Jarrett Bunkhouse Brawl was almost as good as a match in ECW back in the 1990's and could have done better without so many people interfering. The Scott Steinter-Goldberg No-DQ match was an average WCW brawl at best. The Steel cage match for the world title between Booker T & Kevin Nash while not a bad bout,it could have done better. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10.",1279670400,,1137,4.578431372549019
