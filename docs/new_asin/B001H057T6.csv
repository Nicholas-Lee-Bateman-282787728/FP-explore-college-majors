The region 4 classification did not mean any thing to me a time of purchase.  the seller could have clarified the region 4 issue before purchase.  However, I found a machine on which,it would play an have enjoyed it thoroughly.  .",1372118400,2,405,4.25

8307580,5,B001H057T6,I am a die-hard Gerard Butler fan. I bought this item only to watch Gerry when he was young. This was brilliant. What a fantastic actor cum singer GB is!!! WOW!,1303603200,4,160,4.193548387096774
8307581,5,B001H057T6,"I bought this DVD because it had Gerard Butler in it. I ended up liking the whole ensemble of actors. The storyline was simple but it was a sit-com so it wasn't supposed to be anything heavy. The characters were likable, I watched because I wanted to see what happened next.
  I loved seeing Gerard in an early performance for him, even though he played the cad, but anyone who loves him knows this is a good role for him to play. You will not be disappointed if you buy this.",1296864000,5,476,4.21978021978022

8307583,4,B001H057T6,It was really a good movie.  (I guess it was a TV series)  It's well worth the price for any Gerard Butler fans even though he was a really rotten character.,1255305600,4,157,4.032258064516129
