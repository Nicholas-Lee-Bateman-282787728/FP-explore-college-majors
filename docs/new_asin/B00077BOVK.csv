They show freestyle swimming on the backstroke DVD. The bulk of the instruction is on different drills to do, almost all focusing on hip rotation, with a minuscule amount about kicking. Neither one says anything about arm movement, and you can't get a good idea of what the arm movement is supposed to be from the video. The DVD quality is bad -- it looks like it was converted from an old video tape. I didn't buy this video, just borrowed it from the library, and even for that I could not recommend wasting your time on it.",1280016000,,658,4.401639344262295
8189939,2,B00077BOVK,"I feeled being cheated when I bought this dvd and another dvd from the

same coache: basic freestyle swimming technique for these reasons:

 1. More than half of the 2 dvds are exactly the same things, just a duplicate scenes.

 2. No underwater camera, can not see the body movements clear.

 3. A lot of talks that are not useful for learning.

 4. The prices are too high compared with other sellers.

 5. More like this dvd aim at teenagers, not for adults.",1162166400,5,461,4.433734939759036
