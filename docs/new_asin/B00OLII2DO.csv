These two men bridge the chasm between a world of war, suspicion, intrigue, terror and brutality to one with hope, compassion, truth, and lasting friendship.

6755899,5,B00OLII2DO,Yousef is an amazing character.  I was enchanted by him.  What makes movies / books good ones is if the author / movie maker / actors are fully assimilated in the scene.  The green prince is fully assimilated in his reality.  He is not faking anything.  He is a true person.  He is so sensere.  The bonus side is you get to see how things are going on internally in the hamas / israel.  The story line when told by Yousef is like an enchanting story teller.  He is a magician when he talks.,1416614400,9,490,4.127659574468085
6755900,4,B00OLII2DO,"""The Green Prince"" (2014 release; 95 min.) is a documentary about the improbable, ""too good to be true"", story of Mosab Yousef, the so-called Son of Hamas, who for over a decade worked as a spy for the Israeli security service Shin Bet, and Gonen Ben Yitzhak, his ""handler"" within Shin Bet. As the documentary opens, we are reminded of the historical context in the mid-90s within which all of this is taking place, and we then dive straight into the meat and bones of the documentary, namely the interviews with both of the protagonists. To tell you more of what happens might spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this documentary is further proof once again (as if more was needed) that non-fiction trumps fiction more often than not. I mean, you couldn't make this stuff up! Second, the key moment for me was to understand why Mosab, the oldest son of the leader of Hamas in the West Bank, decides to turn against his father and his people, and you may be surprised how it all comes about, Third, the risks taken by Mosab for over a decade are beyond description (just one example: so few people within Shin Bet know about Mosab's true role, that he is considered a top terrorist by most of Israel's government, and indeed most of the world), it will leave you speechless. This documentary is written and directed by Nadav Schirman, who just last year brought us another worthwhile documentary (""In the Dark Room""), and is based on Mosab's memoir of the same name, published a few years ago. I am surprised/baffled that I had not heard of this remarkable story before, but it only makes watching this documentary even more riveting than it already is.

I saw ""The Green Prince"" this past weekend at the Paragon Pavilion in Naples, FL. The early afternoon screening I saw this at was surprisingly well attended, given the time of day (I frankly expected little or no-one else), and I think that is great news. If you like documentaries, in particular about historical events, you cannot go wrong with this. If you get a chance to see this, be it in the theater or on DVD/Blu-ray, do not miss this! ""The Green Prince"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1414972800,31,2222,4.637055837563452

6755916,4,B00OLII2DO,"Documentary was very well done.

I found this movie by chance: was at friend's house, looking for another movie and this came up. We read what it was about and decided to watch it.

I noticed that some of the 1 and 2 star reviews contrast the movie against the book. They loved the book so much that they decided to watch the movie and it disappointed them. I am taking the opposite approach: I liked the movie so much that I have placed the book in my ""must read"" list. Not sure when I'll get around to reading it, but will probably wait until the movie is not fresh in my mind anymore.

The movie is a very well put-together documentary that focuses on the 1st-person accounts of Mosab, the son of one of Hamas's leaders during the Yasser Arafat era, and Gonen, a Shin Bet operative (handler) in charge of working with and directing Mosab. Together, they explain the difficult, unbelievable position in which Mosab placed himself - One where he'd be betraying his father and friends who saw and loved him as family, in hopes that it would lead to the end of the bloody war between Israel and the Palestinian people.

Without spoiling it, it ends with how Mosab left the area, moved to the US, and how Mosab and Gonen once again worked together, eventually becoming as close as family.

Espionage, betrayal, greater good, stepping up to help 'the enemy'... If you're into these types of movies, you will like it (but don't expect high-speed chases or Rambo-style action). I can't wait to read the book b/c I'm sure it will have those James Bond moments that action junkies crave (stay tuned for that review, I guess).",1465084800,,1618,4.527397260273973

6755929,5,B00OLII2DO,"Films like The Green Prince, a stunning documentary about the role of espionage in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, come once every generation.

A collaboration between Israeli filmmaker Nadav Schirman and Palestinian rebel-turned-Israeli-intelligence-asset-turned-memoirist and activist Mosab Hassan Yousef, The Green Prince tells the compelling story of Yousef's abortive attempt to become a Palestinian armed radical during the second Palestinian intifada.

Yousef was expected to contribute to the Palestinian cause - he was, after all, the eldest son of the notorious Sheikh Hassan Yousef, a founding leader of Hamas, a Palestinian Islamic organization with an active military wing.

When his father is arrested by Israeli soldiers for the umpteenth time, the young Yousef and two of his friends decide to buy guns and attack Israeli Defense Force soldiers. His first attempt at being a killer lands Yousef in jail.

The Green Prince doesn't shy away from showing the harsh treatment Palestinians received in prison - or the deadly manner by which they resolved internal conflicts. Disgusted by Hamas' commitment to torture and murder, Yousef agrees to spy on his father.

Yousef continues to supply Israel's domestic security service, Shin Bet, with intelligence for well over a decade.

Constructed of archival films, news reports, first-hand accounts, and dramatic recreations, The Green Prince features extended interviews with Yousef and his Israeli handler, former Shin Bet officer Gonen Ben Itzhak.

It is as exciting as any fictional spy thriller and as eye-opening as any political tractatus.",1450742400,,1607,5.670833333333333
6755930,5,B00OLII2DO,"The Green Prince  Musicbox  2014  DVD  PG-13

This is a docudrama presented as all fact, but the character of Mossab Hasan Yousef for obvious security reasons had to be acted by a professional actor.  It's the story of a Shin Bet operative, son of an Israeli Army General, and the son of Shaykh Hasan Yousef, a Muslim Brotherhood activist and one of the founding fathers of Hamas in the West Bank.  At age 17 Mossab is arrested.  In prison he is approached by Shin Bet about collaborating with them.  His initial thought is to agree and then work against them as soon as he is released.  But after some prison time and witnessing brutality and corruption within Hamas, and considering that his collaboration might save his fathers life, he agrees in a second meeting, to collaborate.  Years later he told his story in an autobiography and this film is based on that book.

Granted both main characters, Gonen the Israeli and Mossab the Paestinian, inevitably present things in a light favorable to themselves, this gives outsiders a glimpse into what its like to work for Shin Bet, as well as what its like to be a Palestinian on the West Bank under Hamas.  Most of all its a story about two people, mortal enemies, becoming lifelong friends.  Its a story about culture shock, about living a lie for 10 years, about honor in a dishonorable world, and about transformations.  Its a great movie.  Some of the bonus features on the DVD are also worth watching: there are some short additional interview clips, as they spent 9 days interviewing both Mossab and Gonen to produce the film.  There's a vast amount of videotaped footage that simply doesn't appear in the feature film unfortunately.  One could probably make several more feature-length products out of it.  Sadly since these events transpired, peace between Israel and Palestinians seems more elusive than ever at present...but sooner or later, all things change.

6755946,4,B00OLII2DO,"Mosab Hassan Yousef is a son of one of the founding fathers of the Palestinian group Hamas. He grew up in the shadow of Israel's occupation and the shadow of his fathers fight and rhetoric. He was the heir apparent and decided to take up the armed struggle. This got him arrested and in the grips of the Israelis.

He was then interrogated by the Shin Bet (Israeli Security Service) and they tried to turn him, he was still sent to prison. He then ended up working for the Shin Bet and this is his story. Now this is a basic documentary with interviews to camera from Mosab and Gonen Ben Yitzhak (his handler) for the most part. There is also use of archive footage to flesh out the tale and a bit of re-enactment too.

This is actually a very moving and extraordinary film in places with unexpected turns and reveals for both Israel and Palestine. This has the potential to be very divisive as it is a subject that burns close to a lot of people's hearts. That said it is better to discuss than to not and if this film encourages debate then I think that can only be a good thing - as indeed this documentary is too - recommended to those with an interest in modern and World history.",1440633600,,1185,4.285714285714286

6755948,4,B00OLII2DO,"The Green Prince seems a micro-documentary of the main subject of Israels occupation of Palestine, paring it away into the story of a Shin Bet operative and the Palestinian who hes the handler for. The interviews take place in stripped down rooms,suitable for interrogation of the strange relationship that grew up between Mosab Hassan Yousef,son of firebrand Hamas leader Sheikh Hassan Yousef, who agrees to spy on his father for the Israeli secret service, and Gonen Ben Yitzhak, his Shin Bet handler. We cut away from one interviewee to the other, in a tense , dramatic recounting of this two-hander. This is intercut with archive footage,reconstructions,interviews direct to camera. The story of espionage and counter-espionage took place between 1997-2007. After being imprisoned for gun-running and witnessing Hamas murders in a Israeli prison and his own rape, he agrees to spy for Israel on his own father, in order to prevent his own fathers death(preferring his imprisonment) and the further death of more Palestinians. He became the most high-profile spy,playing off both sides against each other. Mosab deeply loves his father,but disapproves what he does,is pitched between two father figures. He comes to respect Ben Yitzhak, who develops a tender regard for the safety of his spiritual offspring,both before and after he is fired(for treating Yousef as a comrade and friend).Then Yousef abandons his former cause and emigrates to the US.

This gripping documentary by  Naz Schirman seems to reduce the true complexity of the subject matter, and needs to be balanced by viewing The Gatekeepers, which shows the criticism for Israels actions by major Shin Bet operatives, who hate what the politicians have made of Israel and the Palestinian question since the 67 war. The film itself doesnt take sides, but places itself into the tradition of natural humanity of the future generations to be born into the chaos. The absolution of these two men is only achieved through each other. This unbelievable story is bracingly true.",1438992000,,2038,5.229357798165138

One man, is an Arab, formerly Islamic and son of one of the main leaders of the terrorist organization, HAMAS and the other man, his Israeli ""handler"" in SHIN BET, which is similar to the American CIA, who came forward and ""went public"" to support Mosab's story that he was NOT a threat to the United States. Mosab, after spending over a decade working for Israeli intelligence and finally having to tell his father what he had secretly been doing, has no choice but to leave his country in order to keep from being assassinated by other Islamic terrorist organizations. He chooses to live in the United States, convert to Christianity and write a book, hoping that by ""going public"", he will secure his safety and be able to live in America, where he has asked for political asylum. He is denied asylum and faces deportation, which will almost certainly be a death sentence for him! Upon hearing about all of this, his former handler in SHIN BET also comes forward, risking his own life and reputation, to let others know that Mosab is indeed, telling the truth and is NOT a threat to the USA and should be granted asylum.
This is so much more than just a story about Arab-Israeli ""politics"" and more the story of two men who over the course of a decade, built an incredibly unique ""friendship"", while trying to help each other find better ways of dealing with their two cultures and differences, than killing innocent people.",1434240000,,1534,4.727611940298507

It seems improbable that this young man who had not completed school, had turned his life into a mission looking at both sides now. In the 1990s,  Mosab Hassan Yousef, the son of senior Hamas leader Sheikh Hassan Yousef, was picked up by the Israeli Intelligence Unit know as Shin Bet. They had been following him, and now they found guns in his car. Mosab was furious with Shin Bet for arresting his father, keeping him in jail for years,releasing him, and then picking him up again 6 hours later. While in prison, Mosab was asked to work for ShinBet. At first he refused, then he thought this would get him released. His handler, Gonen Ben Yotzha, was an exceptionally good and intelligent man. He knew how to snare Mosab, and he did, but it took years for Mosab to trust him.

Gonen ran him as a spy in Hamas for 10 years, and Mosab kept his father safe by having him put in prison. Mosab was able to provide enough intelligence that was used wisely to prevent many suicide attacks and loss of life. After 10 years, Mosab became tired of living the life of a spy, not being able to develop relationships with anyone, no family, hiding and lying. His handler met him outside of the usual methods and sent him off for R and R activities in Israel. This was not looked kindly upon by Gonen's upper echelon, and he was fired from his job and that of Shin Bet.

Several other handlers tried to take over, but Mosab did not trust any of them, and he asked to be let go. Finally, he was released, and sent to the United States. He did well, joined a religious church, but he told them his secret and was banned. The US refused to allow him to stay, and it took some interference to change their minds. Mosab wrote a book about his life as a spy, and it put him and his family in great danger.

This documentary was made, and it is superb. Told in alternating snaps, Mosab tells his story and Gonen Ben Yitzha tells his side. It is dramatic and telling. A relationship that started as a handler and a spy developed into a trust and caring for the other man. Tremendous documentary.

Today, Mosab has had to move several times because of threats. Where is he today, walking among us.

6755976,5,B00OLII2DO,"This is an extraordinary documentary about an extraordinary person.  Unlike many, Mosab was able to look reality squarely in the face when it was shown to him, when he saw the real cruelty and barbarism of the Hamas people he had been taught to respect and fight for, and then to go to work, not firstly on behalf of Israel, but on behalf of his own sense of humanity and compassion and self-respect as a human being. He had tremendous cultural pressures working against him, telling him that to stand up for the truth was not an act of honor, but an act of disgrace.  He was able to see through that.  At the same time as he fought against Hamas, however, he did not stop loving his family and taking the best care of them that he could, and he even continued to deeply love his father, a major Hamas leader, and do everything he could do to try and protect him.  Maintaining his love for his father and the rest of his family, while at the same time, working against the very wrong things his father was doing created a tremendously painful conflict for him; it was a really tough emotional balancing act all of the time for him.  Mosab is a true hero, a real warrior, as far as I am concerned.

  Mosab, I take my hat off to you!  You are a person of great honor and courage, and a wonderful example for other people to learn from.",1426896000,,1334,4.261904761904762

6755993,5,B00OLII2DO,"The autobiographical book, Son of Hamas, was fascinating. The documentary DVD is just as interesting, and includes a lot of details that happened after the book ends. The book begins in the 1980s as Mosab is growing up in West Bank as the son of a well-respected leader who co-founded Hamas as an organization working for Palestinian independence which morphs over the years into the terrorist organization we see today. Mosab was imprisoned by Israel as a 17 year old, where the Israeli Shin Bet tried to recruit him as a spy. During his imprisonment, he becomes disillusioned with Islam and Hamas as he watches Muslim prisoners torturing each other, and decides that the only way to protect the lives of people is to accept the offer and give information to the Shin Bet to prevent the needless killing of both Palestinians and Israelis. So begins 10 years of danger and spying. The book, written by Mosab, reads like a political thriller. While the book and movie both address his life, the DVD centers around interviews with both him and his former Shin Bet handler, so the story is told from a very different angle, and includes how he finally was able to escape the life of danger, lies and secrets (don't skip the extra materials- they were great, too). The book and DVD gave me some fascinating insights into the conflicts between Israel and the Palestinians. I strongly recommend both.",1422921600,3,1394,4.788381742738589
6755994,5,B00OLII2DO,"True wonderful story of honesty, friendship, decency, and loyalty that transcends religious and cultural barriers.  Mosab saved Israeli and muslim lives by realizing that the muslim terrorists including his father were murdering innocent Israelis such that he heroically discarded his family, religion, and nearly his life to ""do the right thing.""

Similarly, his Israeli secret service friend discarded his job and risked incarceration to be loyal to the ethics of Judaism to do the right thing, even though other Israeli secret service agents failed to act Jewish by failing to help Mosab.

Mosab's conversion to Christianity also shocked him as false/superficial as he was initially welcomed as a convert but when the hard times came, he found that his ""loving"" friends failed to stand by him.

In the end, the documentary came down to two people who were true heroes, sacrificing so very much to do the right thing.

Despite the horrors of the Holocaust, surviving Jews should have learned from righteous gentile priests and nuns, unlike the evil Pope Pious, that heroes stand up to fight for that which is right with silence being compliance.

Similarly, Israeli Jews well know the truth of the FORCED exodus of 1 million Jews from Arab lands with confiscation of their homes/farms/property to Israel ""in exchange"" for 400,000 Palestinians who VOLUNTARILY left Israel in 1948 in hopes of returning to kill survivors.

Israelis and all who study recognize that the Palestinians should have simply been embraced by the Arab Empire as the 400,000 who chose to leave could have been given the homes of Jews forced to leave.  However, the muslim Arabs preferred to harm their fellow muslims by not giving them the empty homes and instead having them live in refugee camps, breeding until now millions of Palestinians are taught to hate Israel instead of hating their fellow muslim persecutors.

Israeli secret service Jews know of the unethical evil events of the Holocaust against the defenseless weak as well as the unethical evil persecution of the defenseless Palestinian emigrants and their descendants by the Arab Muslim Empire, but the Israeli Jews failed to support Mosab, save for the one Jewish handler who embraced his religion to do the right thing just as the many priests and nuns in the Holocaust risked so much to help defenseless Jews.

We can all learn and try to live to be like Mosab and the one most decent Israeli Jew who helped him.  It's not about religion.  It's about doing the right thing.  Being ""religious"" can be bad, good, or immaterial.

Truly inspiring film.

I'm buying this one!",1422748800,7,2613,5.016203703703703

In a similar manner, Mosab Hassan Yousef and Gonen Ben Yitzhak evolve in parallel as political rivals who escape agnosognosia to glimmmers of personal insight through a tense 10 year Hamas spy and Shin Bet (Israeli Intelligence) handler relationship.

Mosab details his history in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Son-of-Hamas-A-Gripping-Account-of-Terror-Betrayal-Political-Intrigue-and-Unthinkable-Choices/dp/1414333080/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Son of Hamas: A Gripping Account of Terror, Betrayal, Political Intrigue, and Unthinkable Choices</a>. Mosab's father is the founder of Hamas on the West Bank. Gonen is Shin Bet Israeli intelligence service, son of military officer tasked with preventing terrorist acts on the West Bank.

Gonen recruits Mosab to spy for the Shin Bet for 10 years during which time Mosab is publicly exposed as a terrorist in order to protect his undercover activity. Contemporary television coverage of the principals in the Palestinian Israeli conflict illustrates the chronology of spy techniques, information shared, decisions made, possibly lives saved, the mental and emotional exhaustion of constant lying, the necessary vigilance, the inability to trust anyone. Mosab requires jaw surgery, comes to the US, converts to Christianity, is subject to accusations of terrorism by Homeland Security, undergoes deportation hearings. Gonen, Mosab's Shin Bet handler unilaterally chooses to travel to the US, expose his own identity thus ending his career, to testify in open court on Mosab's behalf to prevent his deportation and risk for assassination.

The isolation, fear in the eyes of others as Mosab reveals to them his identity, the deep loneliness of constant lying, mistrust used for survival, uncertainty about the future shape moral growth.

The last few decades we traveled extensively among Muslim peoples (Uzbekistan Tajikistan Kazakstan Turkmenistan Kyrgystan Borneo Malaysia, Urfa Turkey near Syria, Komodo Java Sulawesi Morocco camping in the Sahara, northern China) as well as Buddhist Christian and animist cultures. I perceive a common humanity in everyone I meet, concern for family, love of culture, desire for education healthcare peace clean water food shelter community transmission of culture for grandchildren. These are universal shared human qualities. This gripping documentary tries to illustrate what is puzzling about humankind, why people of good will are unable to live in shared harmony. The extras include an interview with the film maker, Israeli TV interview with Mosab, out takes of interviews, storyboards, and trailer.

What continues to perplex me about lack of commitment to tolerance compassion and sheltering of another generation is humanity's willingness to devote precious limited irretrievable life moments to gossip exclusion vengeance hatred rather than cooperation, finding common ground, contributing to the social contract (Civility and Psychology Robert Coles Daedalus).

If you do view Green Prince, I am most interested in any insights, since I continue to ponder the divide humans create artificially which results in so much avoidable human suffering.
