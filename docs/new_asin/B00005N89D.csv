7946396,5,B00005N89D,I ordered this tape for my dad.  We both love this music era.  I would recommend this tape to anyone.,1391817600,,101,4.0
7946397,4,B00005N89D,"The highlight of this video is The Diamonds singing Little Darlin' and then joined by Maurice Williams. Williams and The Zodiaks then continue with Stay. The Chiffons sing One Fine Day, a nice song, but I would have rather heard He's So Fine. Both would have been best. The Coasters sing Poison Ivy, but hearing Yakety Yak would have been nice, also. Love Potion # 9 and Devil or Angel by The Clovers were nice additions and the final song Til Then provided a wonderful ending. A worth while video even if you get it for just The Diamonds and Maurice Williams & The Zodiaks. Maybe I'm too picky, but you take what you get when you buy a music video.",1039305600,3,649,4.371900826446281
