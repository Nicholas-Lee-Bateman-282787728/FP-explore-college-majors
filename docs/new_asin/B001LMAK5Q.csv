3688120,5,B001LMAK5Q,I don't understand why Jessica has such a bad rep as a Singer and actor.  Keep up the good work Jessica!!,1235001600,,105,4.0
3688121,4,B001LMAK5Q,"Take this movie for what it is....a enjoyable way to kill a few hours if you expected something oscar worthy you shouldn't have picked it up in the first place. While its not near the best of anything it was still made to entertain and that it does if you just watch it for what it is and don't expect a masterpiece. I was entertained and I think Simpson's acting has improved in this movie she was bubbly, cute and ignorant just as the character was. Everybody likes something different and I think this movie is actually enjoyable if your not heading into it already condemning it. I personally love Simpson I think she is an incredible woman with a good head on her shoulders.",1234656000,9,679,4.44
3688122,1,B001LMAK5Q,"The average viewer already knows coming in that Jessica Simpson cannot act, so it is hardly worth enumerating her many shortcomings. Given that basic premise, it is nevertheless surprising that her acting skills are inadequate even to credibly portray a self-absorbed, unserious, unintelligent Hollywood celebrity with a disturbing collection of relatives and hangers-on managing her career.

Again, though, no serious person would watch this movie with the expectation that Simpson's acting skills might carry it. One might, however, expect that actors with the credentials - and comic chops - of Viveca A. Fox, Steve Guttenberg and Saturday Night Live alum Cheri Oteri might be able to carry Simpson. Sadly, they cannot, and rather than elevating the material, they are diminished by it, and that is just too bad for them - and us.

It is puzzling, though, that, having taken the trouble to  enlist the aid of these professionals in front of the camera, the producers did not invest more in a quality script and higher production values. The editing is uneven, the pacing rarely matches the intended mood, and the factual and continuity errors are too numerous to recount (and too blatant to overlook.) The film lurches from clumsily executed cliche to awkwardly forced punchline, and never develops a single character beyond two dimensions.

""There's no crying in the Army!"" shouts First Sergeant Morely (Fox,) greeting a new recruit. Really? Because I thought that was baseball.

""Say it, don't spray it!"" responds Valentine (Simpson) to a drill sergeant. If this had been written and produced by your fifth-grader, you might fake laughter, but only to encourage your kids to keep trying. Unfortunately, this movie was made by adults, and the last thing we should do is encourage them to make another movie.

There is no story line worth noting, and even the lame attempt to create a romantic connection between Simpson and Drill Sergeant Evans (Ryan Sypek,) is, at best, baffling. The two characters share hardly any scenes, and none in which Simpson's Megan Valentine displays any redeeming, much less attractive qualities. As for Sypek's character, he is hardly more than a backdrop.

It's really too bad that a couple of good actors attached their names to this disaster. Just the other day, I re-watched ""Police Academy"" (also starring Guttenberg) on television. At the time that movie came out, I thought it was just a series of cheap laughs held together only by the strong comic performances of the cast. By comparison to ""Private Valentine,"" however, it was King Lear.",1234569600,3,2581,5.116389548693586
3688123,4,B001LMAK5Q,"I have not even heard this was in the making or being released to DVD. I decided to take a chance because I was mildly entertained by Blonde Ambition. Turns out to be an entertaining movie. I agree with the other review that she has good comedic timing.

I wasn't too entertained by Vivica A. Fox's role, I think they could have chosen supporting actress that fit the role better. And the woman from SNL they used, I wasn't thrilled with her age, she just didn't fit. The movie isn't perfect, but worth watching.",1234137600,,512,4.446808510638298
3688124,4,B001LMAK5Q,"Jessica Simpson seems to get lambasted in the press almost daily, so I didn't have the highest expectations for this when I saw it.  I was pleasantly surprised.

The movie was a feel-good popcorn movie with some really nice moments.  I especially enjoyed Viveca A. Fox as Jessica's drill sargeant and Ryan Sypek as Jessica's love interest, and there were some great comic performances by  Cheri Oteri from SNL, Michael Hitchcock from the Christopher Guest films.  and Olesya Rulin from the ""High School Musical""  franchise.  Jessica Simpson at times is a little flat (no pun intended) but for most of the film her likeability and charm shine through, and she can be quite funny in her signature ditsy-blonde way.

On the down side, it's obvious that the filmmakers were purposefully trying to rip off the comedy classic ""Private Benjamin"" (including the name of the movie) starring Goldie Hawn.  But when it isn't try to copy ""Private Benjamin,"" it is a pleasant, and at times, very funny, little film.",1234051200,,1002,4.916666666666667
3688125,2,B001LMAK5Q,"Jessica Simpson stars in a girl power film that went on to become a box office success in Russia and is planned for DVD release in the US on February 3rd.  How does the Pop/Country singer do in her latest film?

""Private Valentine: Blonde & Dangerous"" is about a film star named Missy Valentine (Simpson).

Missy lives a life where she's tended to by her staff and is pretty much taken care of by her professional staff.  May it be agent Sidney (Guttenberg) or her manager Nigel (Michael Hitchcock) who scouted her back when she was 13 and then there is a family member who helps manage her finances.

Life is not always fun for Missy.  She's always featured on the gossip magazines and followed by paparazzi and life is a bit lonely for Missy.  She doesn't have any close ties with her sister ever since she became an actress.  If anything, she just has the people who work close to her , her dog and her boyfriend.

But Missy is your stereotype ditzy blonde and during the night of her film premiere, things go haywire and she loses everything.  Her relative/manager steals all her money, she finds out her staff doesn't really like her, her boyfriend is having an affair and she crashes her SUV.  Things are not going well for Missy and thus, she needs to find a new direction in her life.

So, she ends up joining the military.  Not knowing what she's getting into...

But because Missy is not to happy with her life at bootcamp, she does what she can to get thrown out.  She's wakes up late, she doesn't show up in time for morning call, she's defiant but each time she fails in training, she lets down the whole unit and automatically gets them all punished by forcing the whole unit to run many miles or having to do all this work because all Missy is thinking about is herself.  And it's starting to affect her unit's morale.

Sgt. Morley (Vivica A. Fox) tries to have her off the boot camp because she's become such a distraction.  But the Captain feels that it could hurt the Army's image if an actress is kicked out of bootcamp, so he refuses to kick Missy out.  Thus Missy will have to finish off bootcamp and everyone must put up with her.

But perhaps Missy may learn a lesson in the Army.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Private Valentine: Blonde and Dangerous"" is featured in 2:40:1 anamorphic widescreen.  The video quality is fine at the most part but some areas tend to showcase quite a bit of grain.

As for audio, audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 and as much as the music became clear, I don't recall any use of sound utilized specially on all channels.  If anything, this film is dialogue-driven.  But you can hear the audio clearly through your front channels.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

The DVD features two major features.

The special features two deleted scenes and the other is ""The Making of Private Valentine: Blonde & Dangerous"", a nine minute featurette.

If anything, the making of featurette is quite interesting to watch.  You get to learn about the challenges that the ladies faced by filming in the South, especially the insect bites courtesy of mosquitoes and chiggers.  So, each talent is interviewed in regards to working in high humidity and being in the swamp where insects, alligators and moccasins and other things could be.  But for a lot of these ladies, the experience to play such a role and get dirty, was an exciting experience for them.  Interesting is that interviews were made with all major talent and the main actress, Jessica Simpson is not featured in the featurette.

""Private Valentine: Blonde & Dangerous"" is at most part a girl-power, girl bonding film.  It's entertaining but at the same time, there are just so many segments that I was quite disappointed in.

For one, for a military film, to see Jessica Simpson's long hair looking like it's getting in the way was surprising.  Her hair was not in a bun and not even cut short for the role.  But I'll let that sly, there are just a few things that made no sense in the film.

If the men and women in her training unit had to run three miles multiple times a day because of a person's inability to follow the rules, I can not see how this unit would tolerate for that long.  Even if she was a popular actress, I can not see a unit constantly being punished so many times because of her and to be so lax with an ""aww shucks"" attitude.  I'm surprised the guys never had anything to say. I was actually waiting for a character (one of her friends) to stand up to her and really be furious and slap her (granted one character threatens her).  If anything, these women kept to themselves and really had no bite towards how Missy was handling things.

I'm sure one can find comparisons to the 1980 Goldie Hawn film ""Private Benjamin"" which also features a ditsy blonde trying to find a new direction in her life by enlisting in the US Army but as that film had substance, entertaining as ""Private Valentine: Blonde & Dangerous"" was in certain parts, it lacked substance.

I guess with some aspects of the film, I was entertained and if you are in the mood for a popcorn flick on DVD that will make you laugh, something not too serious and a bit campy, then definitely give ""Private Valentine: Blonde & Dangerous"" a try.",1232755200,2,5212,4.503727369542066
3688126,5,B001LMAK5Q,"Jessica Simpson was hilarious in this movie. Vivica A. Fox had a great supporting role in it. Cheri Oteri fro SNL was insanely funny and this is coming from someone who found her to be sometimes annoying on SNL.

3688153,3,B001LMAK5Q,"After ""Blonde Ambition"", my expectations for this movie were very low. As I started watching it it seemed better than I expected. It was pretty funny at times and Jessica Simpson worked surprisingly well in the lead role. She's helped by some good supporting actors, especially Vivica A Fox and Cheri Oteri. The plot is extremely predictable and taken directly from films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Private-Benjamin/dp/6304696558/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Private Benjamin</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Feds/dp/B003IQ5YZE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Feds</a>. About halfway into the movie, the film started taking itself a bit too seriously and became less funny. Still it's a decent way to spend 90 minutes. Weak 3 star rating. Would have been a solid 3 stars if the second half had been as good as the first half.",1286323200,5,926,6.725

3688155,5,B001LMAK5Q,"I will start off by saying that I have been a fan of Jessica Simpson since 1999. That being said, I was more impressed with this movie than Blonde Ambition. This movie was never made to be a blockbuster hit, but it succeeds at being entertaining for the duration. Jessica is funny in this movie and has perfect co-stars, including Ryan Sypek. After the movie, I was upset only because I know there is no chance of a sequel, even though I'd LOVE one. I think the connection between Jessica and Ryan is movie worthy--and personally a take-off or sequel with the two of them would be fun. I really suggest everyone give this movie a shot--just don't expect Oscar material--expect to be entertained as you eat some popcorn:)",1275264000,3,720,4.589147286821706
3688156,5,B001LMAK5Q,"I was waiting for this movie to come out since before her last one was released and could not believe how long it was taking and how they skipped the theater release. I mean Jessica got a lot of harsh criticism for this role but I think she nailed it. I was expecting it to be awful since it went straight to DVD, but I was pleasantly surprised.

This movie was actually really funny and she did great in this role! I wish people wouldn't be so hard on her and hope her career in either movie or music does not end anytime soon.

Seriously worth watching!",1275091200,,555,4.177570093457944
3688157,5,B001LMAK5Q,I didn't watch this movie with any preconceived notions about how good or bad critics said it was. I certainly didn't watch it to judge the acting talents of Ms. Simpson. I enjoyed Employee of the Month and Dukes of Hazzard.,1256428800,,224,4.487804878048781
3688158,4,B001LMAK5Q,"Good film...realistic. Some might be off base, but not entirely unbelievable. Jessica Simpson does a wonderful job with this plot.",1254787200,2,130,5.55
3688159,3,B001LMAK5Q,"I'm betting your liking this film may hinge partly on where you stand on the whole Jessica Simpson thing. Do you love her, loathe her, don't give a dang about her? Me, I don't think much of her singing and I'm leaning towards tepid when it comes to her acting skills. But I think it's beyond debate that she's a straight-up stunner, and my feeling is that she's kind of gotten a bum rap from the press and paparazzi. Acting career-wise, I'm not sure that Jessica Simpson will ever star in a critically acclaimed picture, her best movie so far being&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Employee-of-the-Month-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000LC3ICE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Employee of the Month (Widescreen Edition)</a>. But that doesn't mean that her cinematic stuff isn't worth checking out. So, yes, I saw PRIVATE VALENTINE: BLONDE & DANGEROUS, and I survived it. Fact is, I even liked it.

Jessica Simpson, minutes into the movie, eventually got on my good side, and she eventually wore down my skepticism. She plays down-and-out actress Megan Valentine whose latest flick has her co-starring with a talking dog. Megan Valentine is sunny and oozes that Hollywood sense of entitlement and, well, let's just call her naive. Her entourage doesn't really like her, her cousin emptied her bank account, and her boyfriend has a boyfriend. So a fit of boozy despondency later, and Megan, looking to make a drastic change, ends up enlisting in the U.S. Army.

You can suss out the developing shenanigans in boot camp. It's pretty much what happens when a Hollywood diva clashes with the military's proud, rigid traditions and long history of structured abuse. The material won't knock your socks off, the jokes are stale, and you might sprain your eyeballs rolling them so much. But what I wasn't expecting was just how appealing Jessica Simpson could be in this role. Underneath the predictable spoiled airhead princess act, there's a core of vulnerability, and it's this element which made me sort of buy into Valentine's journey from superficial and pampered to Army strong and squared away (but still an airhead). Simpson doesn't get points for being a nuanced comedienne here. She gets by on sheer likability and, okay, on her bodacious curves (what can I say, I'm a guy).

We're not treading on comedic gold here. PRIVATE VALENTINE doesn't come close to being as good as PRIVATE BENJAMIN or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stripes-Unrated-Extended-Cut/dp/B0008JIJ2O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stripes (Unrated Extended Cut)</a>. You look at a scene like the one with the girls romancing their chocolate bars or Simpson's character demanding for her stunt double when ordered to do exercise drills, and you get an idea of the sort of yucks typified here. Again, Simpson muddles thru on the strength of her appeal.

But her surprisingly decent supporting cast has her back. Vivica A. Fox marches in as the tough drill sergeant with the embarrassing past, and Cheri Oteri steals scenes as the gung-ho re-enlistee. But it's her fellow Army recruits - nicely acted by Aimee Garcia, Jill Marie Jones, and Olesya Rulin - who help to shape Valentine's growth. And it's always nice whenever there's a Steve Guttenberg sighting, if only to let us know that the guy's still alive.

It's hard to overlook the commonality between Megan Valentine and Jessica Simpson herself. Both persons tend to be not taken seriously; their work is considered fluff. In the end, Valentine actually comes off better, because she's in a movie and that allows her closure and a definitive happy ever after. In the end, Private Valentine has done her soul searching and taken steps to take control of her life and her career. In real life, things aren't so clear cut, clarity comes and goes. I guess I'm saying, Jessica Simpson deserves a break or two. Although, part of the equation is that she also needs to make her own breaks. I'm thinking, she ought to try to expand the types of acting parts she gets. ""Ditzy"" can't be her only preferred niche, can it?

The DVD bonus features suck. There are two very brief deleted scenes that are absolute time wasters: Vivica A. Fox's 1st Sergeant Morely cursing (but bleeped) at paparazzi & the fat paparazzi kid talking smack in his office. The 9-minute Making Of featurette has a fun factor in that the cast talks about how gross it was with the icky swamp and the fear of chiggers and how even scarfing down chocolate bars can get old really quick (re: spit buckets). And that's it for bonus features.

PRIVATE VALENTINE: BLONDE & DANGEROUS (a.k.a. MAJOR MOVIE STAR) is fluff but, unlike Simpson's earlier effort -the soul-killing BLONDE AMBITION - this one is watchable fluff, and I'm recommending it. Plus, who knew having past experience as a pole dancing stripper qualifies as a skill asset in the U.S. Army?",1253404800,9,4904,5.153266331658291

3688165,4,B001LMAK5Q,"I have to give the kid credit. Though she is portrayed by the media as a typical dumb blonde (partially her own fault), I saw a mature young woman with more than a bit of brains break through in her performance. This is certainly no movie for everyone, but though totally predictable and clichd, I liked it.

This doesn't even come close to Private Benjamin, which is what I thought it was ripping off, but in the end, there is little to compare them (though a lot of other people seem to be doing just that).

Being a 24 year Air Force veteran, I can't imagine the basic training scenes are the least bit realistic except on a very shallow level. But so what? It was a story about a spoiled actress finding herself and the military was just the setting. Yeah, a well worn story line, but how many movies out there are really all that original?

MS Simpson gets more than the average share of malignment from the press, though I really think she's brought a lot of it on herself. The kid can really act, but with all the concentration on her love life, tight jeans, and that Chicken of the Sea thing, she has her work cut out for her if she can ever be taken seriously. She's even having trouble with her country music career. Being under a microscope doesn't make performing any easier. I guess since she's Jessica Simpson, she's not allowed to have an off night with her singing, or in this case, what many would call an ""off movie.""

If she ever gets her stuff together, I'm sure she could prove herself with more serious roles.

Private Valentine is surely fluff, but I certainly don't feel ripped off for my rental fee. Recommended.",1236124800,4,1637,4.425249169435216
