3890299,5,B002AMVEF6,"I was fairly sceptical if I would like it, thinking it would end up being a kiddy show like High School Musical.  I really didn't get involved with the series until I saw episode 9 (Wheels).  The songs were well sung and re-written for tv.  Most of all the acting was SUBERB.  I won't give away any spoilers to those who havn't seen it, but I think this is well on it's way to an emmy award.",1258588800,3,391,4.038961038961039
3890300,5,B002AMVEF6,I remember seeing reviews for GLEE months before it actually came on.  I was not interested because FOX's lineup isn't always the greatest.  I decided to watch an episode after So You Think You Can Dance because nothing else was on.  The rest is history.  I fell in love with the show.  The characters are amazing and so talented.  Every Wednesday night I have to watch GLEE.  The World Series disrupted about two weeks of GLEE and I was so upset.  I am so glad I don't have to worry about any other interuptions.  I plan on buying the first season as soon as it's available.  GO GLEE!!!!!!,1258243200,2,590,4.37962962962963
3890301,5,B002AMVEF6,"I heard some hype about this show...I missed the early showing of the pilot in the summer, However I noticed the free download of the pilot episode on itunes and thought I would give it try ( hey, it was free ) The fall season is a very busy month for me , so it was in my library for a few weeks before I had some time to view it. All I could say was WOW !! I was totally addicted. This has got to be the best feel good show of the year.! How could you not love it ? The characters ( love sue...she cracks me up ...how can someone so comically evil can have soooo much humanity..( which you see in  the ""Wheels "" episode and she pulls it off) the plots, the music the excitement of getting to sectionals. This is my Wednesday night show...my feel good show, It makes my week go by faster and puts a smile on my face :-)I've already purchased the cd and have already pre-ordered the DVD. What more can I say...watch it, you will be addicted too!",1258243200,5,945,4.0
3890302,5,B002AMVEF6,"An utter joy, it is the best TV series in years. Winning all the awards too. Only crit, is there any reason why there wasn't an audio commentary on this set? hearing some of the young actors narrate an episode would be fantastic. It was rushed onto DVd so soon after screening on TV I am guessing this must be the reason.
Looks and sounds terrific. God bless Jane Lynch, is there a funnier villain anywhere??Scene between her and Dianne Agron in the penultimate ep is a total joy to behold.",1257379200,5,490,4.395604395604396
3890303,5,B002AMVEF6,"Utterly brilliant, insightful, poignant and astounding! Although it hasn't been the full season yet, the first 13 episodes and the outpouring of support on I-Tunes with the show's songs have proven that ""Glee"" is a force to be reckoned with. Created by Ryan Murphy (Nip/Tuck), the show follows the William McKinney HS club led by Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison)who finds something special and wonderful in each of the Glee members. Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) is head of the school's cheerleading team and part co-sponsor who hilariously never ceases to scheme to take out the Glee club. Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), the ""doe-eyed neat freak"", is the school's counselor who finds herself becoming closer to the club than expected. Jessalyn Gilsig (who portrays Will's wife, Terri), is supportive of her husband's decision to take over Glee but becomes selfish in her hopes to start a family. Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) displays her abilities as a diva and proves that she is confident in her talents and goals. Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) reluctantly joins the club and ends up having to make a decision between Glee and football. Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) is proud of having an independent spirit and her vocals are out of this world. Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) struggles to admit his sexual orientation but his passion for the music is inspiring after he joins the football team and teaches them a thing or two about dancing. Noah Puckerman (Mark Salling) is Finn's best friend who at first, dislikes the club for it's flamboyancy, but has a change of heart for a very different reason. Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) is the all-American cheerleader who is head of the celibacy club and joins Glee to assist Sue in taking the club down. Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) is another fellow Glee-ster who wears Gothic clothes regularly and has a speech impediment who becomes a worthy adversary for Rachel. Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) is a handicapped student who reaches out to the club in proving that his disability hasn't limited him in being an outstanding guitar player and singer. There were so many moments that were so touching, funny and all-around joyous that it's hard to completely mention. From laugh-out-loud musical numbers of Salt-N-Pepa's ""Push It"" to the momentous hit of Journey's ""Don't Stop Believin'"", the tie-in soundtrack is a MUST for any die-hard fan of the show! The ultimate breakout smash of the '09-'10 TV season, ""Glee"" is THE show you don't want to miss.",1257206400,64,2489,5.0144927536231885
3890304,3,B002AMVEF6,"It is a live-action cartoon.  (Exhibit A: the cheerleading teacher appears on TV, telling the audience that ""caning works"".  Exhibit B: the chorus teacher has his pay lowered, for asking to teach glee club. How ""arch"" can you get?  Exhibit C: they have a kid in a wheelchair, used for the most obviously-tacky choreography that you could do with him. The joke rivals Mel Brook's ""We Love Bialy"" number, in ""The Producers,"" for audacity.  Exhibit D: in the pilot, the new chorus teacher blackmails a kid with pot-related threats, to get him into glee club.  That's practically a boycott-the-show sort of subplot, and they still did it. Wild.)

If you can get into the foolishness, there's a lot of fun here. The numbers are good - great if you like that sorta thing - and the comic timing is sometimes brilliant, especially when Jane Lynch flies onto the scene.  (They've got a great combination of actress / writers, in that character. Ms. Lynch is a writer's dream.)",1257120000,5,967,4.754491017964072
3890305,5,B002AMVEF6,"I am a mom, wife, and I work full-time, so it is not very often that I find a TV show that I plan my schedule around. I DVR every episode and still plan to buy the soundtracks and full season sets.  The chemistry within the cast is incredible, and I recommend the show to everyone I see. I have never seen so much talent.

I even catch my husband (who usually will only watch shows with vampires or superheroes)sneaking in for a glimpse.  He gets such a kick out of the story-line!

3890306,5,B002AMVEF6,"I agree with Michelle...this would make a great Christmas gift.  I don't understand it being released just after Christmas.  They should move up that release date just a bit.  At least the first soundtrack for the show will be released November 3rd.  That is on my Christmas Wish List.  Glee is one of my favorite new shows.

3890314,5,B002AMVEF6,"I'm a total Gleek, so the original season is pretty amazing to me!  So many people think Glee is total garbage with a bunch of Justin Beiber wannabes singing their emotions... LIES! It's outstanding! Inspiring! Uplifting! Real! My favorite thing (besides the fantastic soundtrack) is that they talk about real issues (teen pregnancy, bullying, race, homosexuality, suicide, texting and driving...), stand up against bullying, and promote individuality.",1353974400,,452,5.746268656716418
3890315,4,B002AMVEF6,"When I (Anna Cavallo) first heard of Glee, about a group of outsider high school students who find something to care about as they take part in glee club. I thought for sure it was going to be a ""high school musical"" type sap-fest, and that I'd hate it. Still, we happened to catched the second episode on television and after that we were hooked. I caught up, and kept watching and now I can't wait until the second part of the first season this spring.  In spite, my early reservations and expectations, I found the show taking me back to my own high school days when I played minor roles in a few community musical theater shows and loved it even though I instinctively knew it wouldn't win me any popularity contests among my fellow classmates.

There's an infectious joy to the musical numbers, and the story has the poignancy mixed with darkly hilarious viciousness and acts of deception between rivals that my wife and I had come to love in Desperate Housewives, just never quite as dark. It's funny and touching, and always entertaining. Jane Lynch is perfect as Sue Sylvester, the ambitious and arrogant ""cheerio"" coach you can't help but love to hate. Lea Michele brings a brilliant mixture of insecurity and overconfidence to the role of the lead glee club singer. All of the actors are extremely talented.

At bottom, it's intelligently written high school soap opera, played by extremely talented actors and performers. There's nothing profound here, but it doesn't try to be. Still, there's an intriguing social edge to this show, as the students deal with issues such as homophobia and racism, handicaps, gender roles, teenage promiscuity and pregnancy, drugs, bullying, infidelity, intolerance, and gossip, but the writers avoid the usual cliches and platitudes that often tend to surround these issues. The show manages to raise awareness and provoke thought without raising the red flag of ""political correctness."" It's a lot of fun to watch, and demonstrates that every once in a while primetime television can still manage to surprise and delight. THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE TV SHOW TO WATCH NOW!!! I WOULD LOVE TO BUY THERE CDS TO GO ALONG WITH THIS DVD.",1351468800,,2175,4.841397849462366
3890316,4,B002AMVEF6,"If you want to get into Glee, you must start from the top. And the first season is definitely the best - the story line is entertaining as well as the music. If you like musicals, high school drama, Queen and/or Journey - you'll love it.",1310860800,,237,4.173913043478261
3890317,5,B002AMVEF6,Glee is one of the most entertaining shows I have ever watched. It focuses on real life situations without the overload of drama that most shows have. It also has just the right amount of humor and suspense. Not to mention the incredible music numbers. The choices of songs is absolutely amazing. I have loved every song that has been on the show. This show never disappoints.  BubblesReviews.com Rating: 5 out of 5,1299456000,,415,4.684931506849315

Now this is for only the first half of the season. Fox decided to release this as a stand alone vol. to please fans in between the first and second half of the 1st season with the intention of release vol. 2 and a completed season.

This dvd, has some special features. Some music videos, some audition videos, a little short of the Principal appearing in a video about the school welcoming new freshman. No commentary which stinks, I would think they would include it in the pilot.

Either way its a great dvd for a show, do whatever you want, buy this and then vol. 2 or just buy the completed 1st season. Either way release your inner Gleek",1289001600,,836,4.415584415584416

I didn't become a true fanatic until after the Madonna episode, which remains my favorite, followed closely by the Kiss/Lady Gaga episode.

3890339,1,B002AMVEF6,"I had never heard of ""Glee"" until I learned that one of my favorite celebrities was going to guest star. I had no idea what to expect. A friend told me it was a ripoff of the popular ""High School Musical"" movies where people start singing and dancing for no other reason than that it's SUPPOSED to be a musical.

The episode begins and I like it because the writing is spunky, it's quick-paced, and the woman who plays the gym teacher is terrific.

The scene switches to a bunch of guys in a gym, I think. They're all talking. Normal. Normal. Then all of a sudden, one of the guys, I think a teacher, starts singing ""Ice Ice Baby."" What's worse, he's taking himself far too seriously and it's quite obvious that he actually believes he looks cool!

Well, I don't think I have ever laughed so hard in my life. I had to ask my friend, who was watching with me, ""Is this for real? Is this a spoof on bad musicals? Tell me the people who make this show INTENDED to make it stupid!""

""Nope,"" he said. ""People take it very seriously. It's very popular.""

""You mean this is ON PURPOSE??"" I asked. ""This isn't some kind of 'wink-wink' inside joke?""

""It's the latest rage,"" he said. I sat there stunned through the rest of the show. At least the video of the gym teacher and Olivia Newton-John spoofing ""Physical"" had a premise. And it was SUPPOSED to be a spoof; not to be taken seriously as legitimate entertainment.

This show is legitimate only insofar as it's legitimately a freak hit -- like Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber. Flash in the pan, destined to go the way of the pet rock!",1277251200,3,1578,4.346938775510204

But it is not very long before they are all engaged.  If the plot doesn't first get them, the outstanding musical performances do. Eventually they are all interested in the story and the characters.  The show is very funny, clever, interesting and pushes the boundaries.  Each episode has a positive message (or messages) that underlies the plot.  All of the characters are interesting and believable. Some are classics. Jane Lynch (Sue Sylvester) is a treasure. Even though their are plenty of homophobes in my classes, they seem to develop compassion for Curt (the ""gay kid"") after watching the episode when Curt tries to shield his father from pain caused by anonymous homophobic coward. Some of the writing is outstanding.  The common theme that underlies all of the episodes is acceptance, overcoming obstacles and working hard to accomplish something worthwhile.  The result is immense pride.  Since I've shown these episodes to multiple classes, I've seen each of them myself countless times.  Nevertheless, I can't stop watching and enjoying this show.  I love it!  Since it's chocked full of music, watch it with a great sound system.

Jane Lynch is hysterical and Jayma Mays is quite a comedian. Story line is good.  Everyone is talented and does a fantastic job.  All in all it rates 5 stars.",1275264000,,502,4.15625

3890352,1,B002AMVEF6,"While i understand that many people could not wait to have some Glee episodes sitting on their shelf at home, those who are looking to buy this DVD set now should be aware that FOX recently announced the release date of the complete first season of ALL 22 episodes. Of course, this set only has the first 13. The September 14th release will be a 7-disc box set retailing for [...] MSRP for the DVD and [...] for the Blu-ray, That's about [...] more than most 22-episode releases of FOX shows which typically have a list price of [...] for the DVD. Apparently FOX is claiming the extra [...] is due to music licensing fees, which I guess is understandable with a music based show like Glee.

Unlike this release, which has little to no bonus features, the complete season set will have extended episodes, sing-along karaoke, a behind-the-scenes look at 'The Power of Madonna' episode, 'Glee' makeovers, never-before-seen 'Sue's Corner' segments, a dance tutorial and more. I haven't heard anything about episode commentaries, but hopefully there will be some of those as well.

As of right now, there are NO PLANS by FOX to release a 2nd volume with the 9 spring episodes as a companion to this volume 1 release. You will have to buy the Sept 14th complete 1st season set if you have already bought release and would like to own the other 9 episodes. In addition, there was talk earlier in the year about an alleged rebate included in the complete 1st season release so that fans who had already bought the volume 1 release could get some money back because they double dipped. Later on, FOX denied any such rebate, but now it looks likes there MOST LIKELY will be a [...] rebate. All the info about this rebate, or ""Gleebate"" as FOX has dubbed it, will supposably be available after June 1st via a special website FOX has set up.  Several websites already have pictures of the box set up and if you google the words 'gleebate dvd' you should be able to see what the 1st season cover art will look like.

 So, if you are looking to buy yourself some Glee, hold out until September 14th if you can. If you don't mind spending the money to buy both releases, not to mention having duplicates of the first 13 episodes, then go ahead and buy this Road to Sectionals DVD as Glee truly is a great series!",1274832000,4,2297,4.512019230769231
3890353,5,B002AMVEF6,I had missed several of the episodes of Glee and wanted the opportunity to both watch the missed episodes and to enjoy the entire season again.,1274140800,,143,4.538461538461538

3890355,5,B002AMVEF6,"After hearing all the buzz about Glee, I watched the Madonna episode, and loved it. Decided to get the DVD to get more familiar with the show/characters and could not stop watching - saw it all in one weekend. What I love about owning the dvd is that I can watch it over and over again...and still enjoy it. Recommend highly.",1274054400,,325,4.344262295081967
3890356,5,B002AMVEF6,"I watched a fair share of the first season of GLEE on tv. When I was talking to a friend a couple of weeks ago, we reminiced about the shows we used to love in grade school and high school and how we'd always be on the phone critiquing them and probably spending more time talking about them than we did watching them. This all lead to the subject of GLEE which she had not seen but heard great comments about from her kids. In anticipation of her visiting me over the past week, I bought this set.
Instead of doing my usual multi-tasking while we watched this over a seven day period, I came to realize that this show was way better when I gave it my full and undivided attention. While I'd have to admit that some characters are a tad over-the-top (HELLO, SUE SYLVESTER!), there is so much about GLEE that speaks to a broadly based audience that it is hard for me to not like it. It is reminiscent of a John Hughes movie in that the misfits join together to take on the socially elite/snotty kids at their school. The characters are fairly well-developed (though the current season seems to be going full throttle and doing more in that direction than Season 1). The program takes on popular teen topics such as unplanned pregancy, bullying, and acceptance of diversity. The adults are portrayed as having their own unique sets of problems which is realistic.  The use of music which reflects some really artful staging, is often used as a subtext for what is happening to the characters as the plotlines are moved forward. The more I watched this show, the more I found it compulsively addictive. I love the ongoing rivalry between everyman teacher Will Schuster (Matthew Morrison) and Sue Sylvester(Jane Lynch). I am absolutely in awe of the entire cast who are absolutely amazing and incredibly talented on so many levels.
This dvd set may not be your thing if you catched all the episodes from Season 1 on tv, but if you like the show and haven't caught all the episodes it is definitely a worthwhile purchase. If you love the show and have seen all of the first season, it is great to have because you can enjoy it all over again.
As a footnote to this review, my friend has fallen for this show and is now a weekly viewer. We both think it defies comparison to anything we've seen on the boob tube and reminds us of West Side Story without the tragedy.",1274054400,,2360,4.450346420323326

Best part for me (go ahead, give me grief):  I have twin daughters (almost 15) and my ladies have two gay dads.  I've retired from my clinical psych practice, and their other ""dad"" (Papa) has not yet retired.  Just love Lea Michele's role with ""and I'll have them get the ACLU...."" bit.  Great roles by all.

From the episode one introduction (with the amazing Journey cover) to the competition at sectionals (with the amazing Streisand, Rolling Stones and Kelly Clarkson covers), this show almost perfectly captures the appeal of corny stage productions without cheapening the development of its ensemble cast.  It's really quite amazing how this show manages to blend the two things together, and to do some with real warmth and heart.

So, no matter where this show goes from here, this DVD captures a show that consistently delivers a high level of quality in every episode.  Let's hope the rest of the season and subsequent seasons keeps it up!",1272672000,,918,4.821656050955414

It's true that fox originally opted for thirteen episodes, but since the show's ratings went thru the roof, the decided to add nine more episodes to the mix.

The music is fantastic, and the show features a wide variety from broadway hits to rap. It is a musical, so not for everyone. The characters on the show are unique and everyone has their own quirks; these are characters that you love or love to hate, there are very few, if any, in betweens, and there are one or two that you love one moment and hate the next. The script is full of teenage agnst and deals with everyday problems that both teenagers and adults are faced with today like pregnancy, coming out of the closet, peer pressure, prejudice, trying to find your niche, etc with subtle, sometimes sarcastic, often witty humor.

3890409,5,B002AMVEF6,"""Glee"" is an amazing show.  It can have you laughing, crying, or doing both at the same time.  It can be heartwarming at one moment and hilarious at the next.  It's a perfect blend of drama and comedy.  The characters are lovable (or hate-able in Terri's case!), and the storylines are interesting, and keep evolving instead of staying in the same place for months.  It Quickly became my 2nd favorite show (Only behind Lost!).  The performances are great, especially from Lea Michele; her performance of ""Don't Rain On My Parade"" was flawless, and I am actually listening to it on my i-pod right now while I'm writing this review!  The cast is very talented.  Matthew Morrison, Lea Michele, and Jane Lynch got well-deserved golden globe nominations, while the show took one home for best comedy/musical!  The show has recently been picked up for a second season before the last nine episodes of the first have even aired!  ""Glee"" is just that great.",1264896000,,949,4.802469135802469

Contrary to the stereotypes perpetuated on ""Glee,"" the MAJORITY of gay males do NOT want to be girls, do not dress like girls, do not wear make-up, do not sashay around; likewise, the MAJORITY of gay male teachers do NOT go around trying to get into their male students' pants. In the real world, the MAJORITY of gay males are as ""normal"" as ""Finn"" and ""Mr. Schue.""  Lines like those recited by Kurt's father: ""I knew you were gay because on your third birthday all you wanted was a pair of sensible heels,"" are totally off-base.

At least I did.  Haven't gotten to the bonus features yet, but the quality is good, it's a pretty sweet bargain for a 4 disc set (though I'm not sure why 4 discs were necessary), and I can't wait to watch it over and over.

First of all, every so called feature is less than a minute long and they start off with some incredibly bizarre informative video by Principal Figgins. They are followed by redundant heavily edited interviews that are very short. There are no commentaries, meet the cast, understanding costuming, anything that would NORMALLY be found on a DVD release.

3890430,2,B002AMVEF6,"The show started out excellently. In fact, my suspicions were roused, unused to the suggestion of the ""Quality/TV"" combination.  The characters were fresh, original, but creative in overall employment of also what we're familiar with - light cliches, a few strategic stereotypes, current culture references, and many effective, unexpected plot-twists to keep things exciting.  Any number of things could happen at any moment, and all number things happened after all.  I felt over-stimulation breathing down my neck, but it wasn't TOO close for comfort.  This was a great show.

Unfortunately, this show went from ""great"" to ""good"" to ""bad"" to ""why"".  I wonder if the team behind this terminally ill mutation shook a pact with the devil, in exchange for the rocket to stardom?  And indeed the rocket flew, but to the top of the podium which is not a strong pillar, but breakable stemware.  The characters are inconsistent and have becoming perverted to the point of garnering disgusted embarrassment.  I feel sorry for the actors: de-famed, who have to represent these confusing character-husks who seem only to poorly imitate what they were once supposed to be like.  The story is tired and dry.  It's exhausted its last resources, no seeds planted to neither sow nor reap - I see no future for this show and for pity's sake, I hope its dead body won't suffer too much longer.  For now, it hangs our in the open, on a cross, humiliated whilst it falls apart, however still hoisted as though some kind of saint!

Yes, for some reason, it is still being celebrated as though it didn't just rapidly decompose before our eyes.  Have a little dignity - I mean no disrespect and I know it's sad and I know it's hard to let it go: believe me that this is how I feel.  What I think we deserve most is an explanation, because the mystery that surrounds this crime is like an iron curtain (seriously, WHAT happened?)!  But the past is the past, so let's move on or, for the sake of the show, stop the charades, and stop the groundless exaltation.  We can reflect back to Glee, the image of what it has BECOME, and when they see, they may do something about it.

Cons - only standard definition;
extras are lifted from Fox website (except for the one mentioned above) so LAME EFFORT;
no optional commentary tracks.
If you're a fan, you probably won't care about the cons so much. If you're better at delayed gratification than me, wait for a Blu-ray of the entire first season (including the upcoming episodes that will air beginning in April 2010) and pray for better extras!",1262908800,2,600,5.13265306122449
3890432,2,B002AMVEF6,"**New episodes of ""Glee"" start April 13th on Fox!  You can purchase Volume 1: Road to Sectionals on Amazon.com if you're truly fiending for the show, but since these were the first episodes BEFORE the network ordered 9 more after the show's success, I would highly suggest to catch the re-runs and save your money for the true first season when it comes out in April.**

My review of the show is below:

Cute characters, if not along the some of the same tired lines of those we've seen before, fantastic musical talent and numbers and high school drama make up the wonder that is ""Glee"".

At first, the network was unsure if they should greenlight the series, fearful that it wouldn't click with the demographic they were aiming for.  But once ""Don't Stop Believin'"" was released, everyone who hadn't seen the show and was amazed by the vocal talent just had to check it out--including me.

""Glee"" is a feel-good show that focuses on triumph over adversity through the power of music and determination.  Matthew Morrison stars as Will Schuester, a Spanish teacher and the Glee club coach.  Morrison is a delightful actor.  When he smiles, you smile along with him.  When he fights for the kids on issues like disability or pregnancy, you feel like he genuinely cares for them-he pulls you into his acting performance and that in itself makes the show a delight.

That along with the talented cast of kids and Jane Lynch as the stop-at-nothing, evil cheerleading coach, Sue Sylvester, will have you tuning in every Wednesday to see what happens next.  Each kid represents the typical stereotype in a world of diversity that we've all seen before, but even though that is a tired angle to try to present as ""new"", each actor bring new life to the characters, making it enjoyable to watch.

Below is a list of the more prominent Glee club members:

Lea Michele is Rachel Berry, a Jewish girl with ""two gay dads"" who has a fierce determination to be a star.  Michele comes to the show fresh off of her run in the Broadway play, ""Spring Awakening"".  It is usually her pipes you hear above everyone else's.

Cory Monteith is Finn, the boy that Rachel pines for and the quarterback for the high school football team.  Finn is led to believe by Quinn, (Dianna Agron), that he has knocked her up and she tries to make him take full responsibility for the baby when in reality, the baby's father is really Noah, (Mark Salling).

Chris Colfer is the adorable out-and-proud Kurt Hummel, who tows the line between being proud of who he is and pleasing his father, (Mike O'Malley).  Thankfully, his father, a mechanic, is portrayed as an understanding father, not a homophobic one, as characters in this macho kind of role are typically molded.

Kevin McHale is the wheelchair-bound Artie.  Artie has a crush on fellow Glee club member Tina, (Jenna Ushkowitz), who he feels a connection with due to her having a struggle with stuttering.

Amber Riley is delightful as Mercedes, the ""chocolate thunder"" of the group.  Her vocals in such songs as ""Hate on Me"" are just as goose-bump giving as Rachel's.

Jayma Mays co-stars as Emma Pillsbury, the school guidance counselor with a huge crush on Will, (and a secret vocal talent that will blow you out of your chair!).  But when Will's wife, Terri, (Jessalyn Gilsig), makes it painfully obvious that no one is going to steal her man, Emma agrees to marry the football coach, Ken, (Patrick Gallagher), whom she finds repulsive but who loves her enough to make her settle for him.

Will's wife Terri is also harboring an awful secret-that she is not truly pregnant with Will's baby but is instead faking it and tries to convince Quinn to give her the baby that she doesn't even want to have anyway.

So as you can see, the drama in this show is a bit over the top.  But the musical numbers are worth sticking around for, if not just for the talent but for the looks on their faces that prove the actors are truly enjoying with they're doing.

""Glee"" may not make you jump for joy but it will definitely have you singing along.",1262822400,5,4057,4.6335664335664335

3890434,5,B002AMVEF6,"This is such a fantastic show! Generally, I don't have time to watch TV since my schedule is jam-packed, but I almost always make time for Glee. I just got the DVD in the mail today. It is amazing.",1262736000,,197,4.076923076923077

3890436,4,B002AMVEF6,"Although I fell in love with this smart, funny show upon its sneak-peek pilot airing last spring, I don't think anyone should have to pay thirty dollars for half a season! No matter how they package it, it's just too much.

That said, if you haven't seen this show and are considering giving it a try, I highly advise you! Essentially, the weekly plots circle around a group of less-than-popular social misfits, all of whom have joined their high school Glee club for a variety of reasons. Their advisor, Spanish teacher Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) is sincere about his enthusiasm in bringing the long-dead club back to life, although his drive for success is also motivated by outside factors. Meanwhile, the sarcastic cheerleading coach, played by Jane Lynch, continues to scheme against Will and butt heads with him every step of the way.

While this might not sound like the premise for a fresh new series, don't be misled! Each week, we learn more about the personal lives of various characters, and what motivates them. There's also bizarre and hilarious events at the school, amidst renditions of numerous popular songs each week -- everything from Broadway to Beyonce. Viewers can never predict what they'll hear next, or just how the Glee kids will present it.

Each week, it's a pleasure waiting for this bright show - both in terms of smart dialogue and the singing. It's even visually stimulating, with a wide array of bright costumes and backgrounds that are bound to make you smile, no matter if your own high school experience was worse than that of the kids at McKinley High.

While nearly every episode is great in its own way, particularly noteworthy episodes include ""Wheels,"" where Will asks the kids to help support the wheelchair-using Artie by spending a few days (as well as doing a number) in wheelchairs themselves. There's also the fall finale, ""Sectionals,"" where the Glee kids finally make it to the first big competition, amidst - naturally - many obstacles and roadblocks.",1262649600,,2009,4.9174041297935105
3890437,4,B002AMVEF6,"I would never have watched GLEE unless several of my friends had insisted that I watched it.  After I watched an episode, I was hooked.  This show is fun and fresh with great songs and singers.  The plot, although at times unbelievable, always keeps you wondering whether your guesses are right.  It can, at times, be a bit strong on the message of being yourself, but I didn't mind because it is a very important message.

The only thing I have an issue with is that Fox has decided that nine more episodes will be included as Season 1, and I'm not looking forward to pay out another twenty-five dollars or so in order to buy the second volume of the first season.

I'd recommend that all music lovers give GLEE a shot.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1262563200,,759,4.41726618705036

My library has this set available to loan to our patrons, and I will get my Glee fix for free!  Why should I spend my hard-earned money twice?  Sorry, FOX, this is shady, to say the least.  I trusted that the rumored voucher would materialize, showing your good faith toward the Glee fans.",1262563200,22,719,4.409090909090909
3890439,5,B002AMVEF6,"I am a new fan of Glee, having caught my first episode on December 23rd.  I've seen 4 episodes through DVR, and I caught the last 5 episodes on Hulu, but that means I am missing 4 episodes!!  I haven't seen 1, 2, 3, or 8.

Yes I could sit there and have my DVR record the episodes and hope that eventually the powers that be will cycle through the show again (in fact, I am fairly confident Episode 8 will air this week), but that completely misses the point about how utterly FANTASTIC this show is and how I will absolutely DIE if I don't see episodes 1, 2, and 3 as soon as it is humanly possible.

So.  While on the one hand I am peeved that I will end up purchasing these DVDs twice (since I will get the complete season as soon as it is available), on the other hand I am insanely grateful that the DVDs are available for purchase now so that I don't have to WAIT an undetermined amount of time to see the early episodes.

Okay.  About Glee.  I just wasn't interested since I figured it was a show targeted for teens and would therefore be completely boring to me.  But I know people who love it, and I always like to check out popular culture stuff, (albeit grudgingly), so I recorded an episode and it just blew me away.

The show is a bit of a spoof and situations/characters tend to be a bit stereotypical and extreme (Sue, the maniacal cheerleading coach is HILARIOUS), and there are a few dramatic situations that were right out of Desperate Housewives (a faked pregnancy for starters), but this show reveals the vulnerable, human side of its characters in such a beautifully honest way that I just fell in love with it.  For example, Quinn, the gorgeous and vicious cheerleader, has an incredible, poignant story line involving teen pregnancy and given how much I loathed her initially, I just can't believe how much I've grown to care about her and what happens to her.

I will say that the show is pretty edgy in terms of subject matter, and some of the dancing (I'm thinking of the bootyliscious dance) is suggestive, but I allow my 11 and 12 1/2 year old children watch it with me because I think the positive values Glee promotes outweighs some of the other more confusing (to my kids anyway) choices that the characters have made, and it has launched many great conversations about honesty and deceit and problem solving and winning and losing and acceptance, etc...

Plus the music is great!  We all enjoy the performances so much. And many of the songs are very cleverly integrated into the story line.

Definitely my new fave.  Highly recommended.",1262476800,4,2569,4.457264957264957

We gave up Cable to get away from mindless TV so now we rent or buy our favorites (Seinfeld, House, Heroes, & 24). Usually I wait till I can get it for less in a few years, but with the great music and quirky characters (love Sue & Emma), I had to have the first season.  I remember ""Cop Rock"" and enjoyed several of the tunes they had, but the show just did not match the Genre at the time.  I'm hopeful ""glee"" will last many seasons and perhaps ""Cop Rock"" or other musical TV show will flourish.  :-)  I look forward to many more seasons and hope the cast members turn out to be good people.  I'm tired of nasty stars.  I'm hopeful.",1262476800,,878,4.240963855421687
3890441,5,B002AMVEF6,"It helps if you really like music and show tunes, among other selections, but even if you don't, you will most likely enjoy Glee.  It's quirky and daring enough that the regular networks might not go for it, but if the folks at FOX have any sense, they will keep it around.  You can't help liking Will, who teaches Spanish, coaches the Glee club, goes at it tooth and nail with Coach Sue (played by the incomparable Jane Lynch), and deals with a difficult wife (well played by Jessalyn Gilsig), who fakes a pregnancy for a while.

The choreography is effective, as are the story arcs involving teen pregnancy, jocks, a gay student, a young man in a wheelchair, an Asian girl who is faking a stutter, and cheerleaders.  I'm also glad that the writers actually put some substance into the stories instead of relying solely on snappy dialogue.",1262476800,,840,4.617449664429531
3890442,1,B002AMVEF6,"I love ""Glee."" Seriously. I have loved ""Glee"" since the first episode aired back in the Spring of 2009 and I dreaded waiting until the Fall for new episodes. I buy all of the songs from the show off iTunes and I watch every episode live. I really do recommend ""Glee"" to everyone because it is such a unique, enjoyable, enthusiastic, and downright fun show! The singing's always great, the dancing is a thrill, the comedy is a riot, and the drama is powerful. I have no issues with this show outside of the fact that it doesn't always let the minor characters have their chance with the microphone that often (specifically Tina and Puck). I'm itching with excitement over the back nine episodes and am eagerly waiting for them to start airing in April.

HOWEVER, with all of that said, I urge everyone NOT to waste their money on this boxset. It seriously is a scam. Originally, an interview with a producer on the show said that this first volume - containing the 13 episodes of ""Glee"" that have been produced and aired this past Fall - would come with a voucher for when the Complete First Season (all 22 episodes) is released in 2010 so that you wouldn't have to pay the full price to get the last nine episodes.

In a memo to the website [...], FOX confirmed that there is not and never was a voucher with this boxset - meaning that the people who pay the price to get the first 13 episodes now will have to pay that price again PLUS another $15 (at the least) to get the complete season when it is released later this year. They're ripping off the fans - as if they aren't making enough money off of this blockbuster with their chart-topping, record-breaking soundtracks and songs on iTunes and getting enough recognition with the four Golden Globe nominations the show has rightfully received.

FOX is running a scam here, folks. A horrible, horrible scam. And I strongly advise that every ""Glee"" fan show a little patience and wait for the Complete First Season, with all 22 episodes on it, to get released this year. I can't imagine FOX will make us wait until September for its release so I would expect it at the end of July at the earliest. And even if a Complete First Season ISN'T released - if a second volume with the final 9 episodes of season one IS released - do you really want to take that chance? Knowing FOX, it probably won't be released and then you'll be out $25 or more because you'll have to pay for the same 13 episodes twice!

Keep watching the show. Keep recommending the show. Keep downloading the songs off iTunes. But DO NOT buy this boxset and waste your money! Wait until we know what will happen once the season ends - until we know if we'll be getting Volume Two or if we'll get the Complete First Season.",1262390400,180,2741,4.432539682539683

Interestingly, FOX waited til a day or two after this release to refute that report, allowing many people to purchase it first. Lots of extras included, but leave it to Fox to let another greasy rumor slide by for their own benefit. Still love the show and happy to own it, though!

P.S. I had to return my first copy because my tv/dvd player wouldn't play any of the extras...my computer even refused to acknowledge a disc in the drive, and both devices are less than 2 years old. I just got home with my second copy and it's the same. I will be returning it for a full refund tomorrow.

The motion of many people dancing on screen in a group causes all of the dancers to look like plastic puppets. You can't see any detail. The lighting effects during some musical numbers also cause horrible video distortion.

A friend of mine also purchased this release at a different store and was just as disappointed as I was there was no such voucher/coupon. When I called FOX's Customer Service Line I was told they were unaware of any vouchers. I was asked to send an e-mail to fox connect for them to research and I would hear some type of response within 48 hours. I included several websites and articles regarding the release in my e-mail and I still have not received any response from FOX Connect. I would imagine there are more customers like me out there.

3890447,5,B002AMVEF6,"GLEE is more than just a musical comedy about raging, bully teachers or scheming, non-pregnant wives -- it is a show that shows the NEED and WANT of being accepted in society (or in this case: HIGH SCHOOL). Glee Club, aka Show Choir, is not a POPULAR extracurricular activity. That being said, people lash out toward those who are involved, and so forth.

Will Shuester, the new director of Glee Club, creates a sanctuary for those talented students whom he thinks has a chance of taking Nationals. Here's the problem:

(Lea Michele) Rachel Berry is a overzealous star.
(Chris Colfer) Kurt Hummel is a closeted queer.
(Cory Monteith) Finn Hudson is an attractive stud.
(Amber Riley) Mercedes Jones is a dramatic diva.
(Kevin McHale) Artie Abrams is a cripple.
(Jenna Ushkowitz) Tina Chang is a s-s-stutter-girl.

Six kids?! At first, I was surprised at the fact they did not have a lot of students, but by Episode Two [Showmance], I was blown away. Great performances by the evil, vindictive Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) and Rachel Berry (Lea Michele). The cast is excellent, and not too silly. Also: Terri Shuester (Jessalyn Gilsig) is phenomenal, as always.

The DVD is kind of a joke to me, but hey, it's a great show. Some reviews mentioned a few more episodes until the end of Season One. Oh well, I just bought it today, ONE DAY SHIPPING. I highly recommend you get slushed by this amazing show.

There are a few special features, but very limited compared to shows such as BSG which have released full featured volume sets (and I thought those were as bad as it gets as far as studio money-grubbing!).  The lack of commentary tracks and Blu-Ray availability suggests that the rumors of a full-season DVD set are probably true, and you'll end up buying these 13 episodes twice.

This set was originally planned earlier this fall when Glee was only going to have 13 episodes for the first season, but then after having such good ratings, FOX added NINE more episodes to the first season. This is a redundant release because FOX has said they will also release an actual COMPLETE first season after the show finishes airing the last 9 episodes starting in April. It will come with a coupon to save on the complete season, but unless that is $30 of more, you'll end up paying more for both releases than if you just wait and buy the complete season. Don't get me wrong, I love the show, but this is just a get money fast scheme and I will not support volume releases. Don't waste your money on this, wait for the full season. Let's make the studios realize they can't screw us over with these types of releases just so they can make more money.",1261872000,862,1001,4.387096774193548

I am SO glad that I did.

What memories it brings back...choir practice...recitals...band. It's a lovely blend of drama and humor, and the music is fantastic. I haven't missed an episode, and I can't wait for the pre-order to arrive so I can watch all of these great shows again from the beginning.",1261440000,,543,4.42
3890456,4,B002AMVEF6,"From a TV Studies standpoint, GLEE is one of the most interesting series to come along in a while. From a marketing standpoint, it is unprecedented to see a series have a midseason DVD box set released. Shows like BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, THE SOPRANOS, and SEX AND THE CITY have had the first half of seasons released, but in those cases the shows had extremely long hiatuses. GLEE is having a few months' hiatus, but it isn't as long as with those other shows. It isn't the first show to have a great deal of music in it; that distinction goes to the superb ELI STONE, a show that was thoroughly enchanting but that sadly did not get enough viewers to keep it on the air. But no show in memory has had so much music so completely up and front. The show is also unique in that the pilot debuted several months before the start of its first season. The ratings for the pilot were extremely weak, but word of mouth and strong reviews built up sufficient interest in the show for ratings to improve dramatically when the show returned in the fall.

The cast of the show is uneven, especially in the area of musical talent, but luckily some key characters were extremely well cast and pick up the slack for the other characters. Veteran character actress and comic Jane Lynch has been in countless shows and graced an exception number of movies, but has never really gotten a role that garnered her the kind of acclaim that she has deserved. For instance, this past year she stood out on the great Starz comedy PARTY DOWN, but it was like so many of her other roles, something to get her noticed, but not something to set her apart. But as cheerleader coach Sue Sylvester, Lynch has finally gotten a role that will get her both acclaim and awards. I'm betting that she is going to take home either an Emmy or Golden Globe as Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy. The two other key cast members were unknowns in TV and film. Matthew Morrison is exceptionally as Spanish teacher and Glee Club leader Will Schuester. On a show that puts a premium on singing and dancing, he is exceptionally fine at both. He fully deserves the Golden Globe Award he was just given. He has a fine light singing voice and an engaging personality that is just right for the show. But the star of the show is the astonishingly talented Lea Michele, who while having had some stage success, is more or less new to TV. She not only has a marvelous singing voice, she has a world of personality and one of the most engaging smiles on TV. Luckily she has competition for the best singer on the show, Amber Riley, who plays Mercedes on the show. There are other excellent actors on the show. There are unfortunately some weak links. The weakest link is Cory Monteith as Finn, who is a likable enough character, but hardly believable as a high school student (he'll be 28 before the season ends) and completely lacks the vocal chops of the other key figures. This comes out even more on the official cast recording than it does on the show itself. As I said, he is likable, but his voice simply isn't on the same level of the other top performers.

The weak link in the series overall is the writing. It is OK, and there are some fine individual moments, but the overall story is very strong and isn't very compelling. If you took away the music it would, in fact, be a remarkably bland series. Luckily, there is the music. All of the songs are pretty standard and invariably Top Forty or familiar show tunes, but the arrangements are first rate and the performances compelling.

I have a minor fantasy. It isn't very likely to take place, but I can hope. With the demise of DOLLLHOUSE Joss Wehdon is no directly linked to any full time project. He is possibly the only producer/writer working today who might have the ability to make this both a musically entertaining show with a great story to boot. And while he usually only wants to work on his own projects on a permanent basis, he might be tempted to take on GLEE. Whedon is actually going to direct one of the episodes for the second half of the season. He has been very upfront about musicals being his favorite genre. This might be the only project not of his own creation that he might be willing to undertake on a permanent basis. OK, it is just a fantasy. The people in charge may know that the writing isn't top shelf, but with the ratings strong they might not want to mess with the formula. But I would love to see GLEE become a show that not only had likable characters and some great musical numbers, but a show with a really strong storyline as well. Frankly, right now I find the story to be completely and totally forgettable and not up to the level of the music. Maybe the producers will love Whedon and Whedon the show enough for something special to happen. Just remember, no episode of GLEE has been even remotely as entertaining as ""Once More With Feeling,"" the great musical episode of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.

Even if my fantasy does not occur, this will at least continue to be superb light entertainment. I wouldn't put it on my list of the ten best shows on TV, but it is definitely on the list of shows that I will definitely watch each week.

I will add that I have absolutely no intention of buying this set. It is not being advertised on Blu-ray and I would definitely want this on Blu-ray, if nothing else then for the improvement in sound quality over the DVD.",1261094400,4,5411,4.434170854271357

Every show introduces new issues that the Glee kids deal with in their own musical fashion. Its not a musical but the songs are so beautifully performed and give each episode a tone and energy that is unbeatable.

3890462,4,B002AMVEF6,"When I first heard of Glee, about a group of outsider high school students who find something to care about as they take part in glee club, I thought for sure it was going to be a ""high school musical"" type sap-fest, and that I'd hate it.  Still, we happened to catch the second episode on television and after that we were hooked.  We caught up, and kept watching and now we can't wait until the second part of the first season this spring.  My early teenaged kids purchased and listen to the music on their ipods, and love to sing along.  In spite of my early reservations and expectations, I found the show taking me back to my own high school days when I played minor roles in a few community musical theater shows and loved it even though I instinctively knew it wouldn't win me any popularity contests among my fellow students.

There's an infectious joy to the musical numbers, and the story has the poignancy mixed with darkly hilarious viciousness and acts of deception between rivals that my wife and I had come to love in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Desperate-Housewives/dp/B0021L8FDK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Desperate Housewives</a>, just never quite as dark.  It's funny and touching, and always entertaining. Jane Lynch is perfect as Sue Sylvester, the ambitious and arrogant ""cheerio"" coach you can't help but love to hate.  Lea Michele brings a brilliant mixture of insecurity and overconfidence to the role of the lead glee club singer.  All of the actors are extremely talented.

At bottom, it's intelligently written high school soap opera, played by extremely talented actors and performers.  There's nothing profound here, but it doesn't try to be.  Still, there's an intriguing social edge to this show, as the students deal with issues such as homophobia and racism, handicaps, gender roles, teenage promiscuity and pregnancy, drugs, bullying, infidelity, intolerance, and gossip, but the writers avoid the usual cliches and platitudes that often tend to surround these issues.  The show manages to raise awareness and provoke thought without raising the red flag of ""political correctness.""

The New York Times just reported this in depth.  Regular people also love it and I am one of them.  This is set in a high school but there is something for everyone.  The main character is a high school Spanish teacher and his extracurricular running of the Glee Club.  Will's students make up the modern day incarnation of a Glee Club which is nothing like what most of thought of as our high school glee club.  Their choral singing involves full stage numbers of major hits.  They dance and sing to it and are absolutely wonderful.  Even if you hate all other aspects of the show, you will love the musical numbers.  The Glee music CD has become a major hit in and of itself.  There are some timely topics going on in the show as well.  Will's wife fakes a pregnancy whereas one of his students is pregnant.  She was a member of a high school abstinence club so there is a lot of food for thought as you ponder the effectiveness of the club. (These kids are so in the dark on sex education that they think you can get pregnant by ejaculation into the waters of a hot tub!) My favorite character is the coach for the Cheerleaders, Sue.  She is the villain who constantly is trying to derail the Glee Club.  She is absolutely hilarious.

Everything about this show is utter perfection! This is the second show I can say that I watch RELIGIOUSLY right behind ""Ugly Betty"". The cast is just so talented beyond words, especially Rachel (Lea Michele) she has one of the best voices I have ever heard come out of a human body and I am always looking forward to what song she is going to sing each week. Another character that really has my heart is Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch). I have loved Jane ever since I saw her ""40yr old Virgin"" and I was delighted to see her in this because I now how funny she can be. And OH MY GOD is she funny in this show!!! I can almost say that I live to hear what she has to say every week. She has the funniest lines every single episode she is in and in some cases she can actually make the episode for me. The rest of the cast is outstanding as well. Everyone has great vocals, some a lot better than others obviously, but as a whole they are a real delight to witness.

The show is funny and heartfelt, and the music is often better than the original versions of the songs.
