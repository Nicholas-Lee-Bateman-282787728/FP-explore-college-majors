854362,5,630437044X,"Blood Hook is more than just a classic thriller - it is a lesson on dealing with the demons we each face in our lives.  Peter ""I have to fight for that name"" Van Clease returns to his childhood sanctuary to face the nightmare of his past - the big treble hook that took out his grandfather.  Rather than continuing his 17 year run from the challenge, Peter took his best shot at doing what was right in the climatic final scene.  I won't spoil it for others, but trust me when I say you will leave this movie with the will power to face the Leroy Luedke in your life.  Entertaining, fun and inspiring.  Blood Hook.  It is a cult classic.",1181260800,2,637,4.180327868852459
854363,5,630437044X,ok well i don't own this yet but i am looking forward to seeing it.. I live in Hayward Wisconsin where this movie was filmed and have got to say u mention the words blood hook around here every one just laughs cuz they all know that it is a cheezy b film (however worth the watch) i live 2 miles from where they shot scenes from this movie and have to fill everyone in on what really happened. During one day of filming they were shooting a boat scene and no one knew the area wasn't cleared and a kid got sucked into a motor and died it was really gorey and yeah but whoever was swimming in that area was crazy cuz it's nasty water! anyways take this from someone who lives where they filmed this ... watch it if not for the horror but for the laughs it will surely give u! musky madness? haha (however this town anually celebrates a musky fishing tournament and ends with a festival called Musky fest every june) enjoyyyyy,1175904000,,924,4.196629213483146
854364,5,630437044X,"No need for a fillet knife, this movie will split you wide open from laughter!  The artful blend of cinematography and zany Wisconsin musky culture is a perfect compliment to a well-placed cast in this hour and a half of twisted plot in the wilderness!  This movie will let you know what it feels like to come head to head with another treble hook swinging maniac on the lake!

854569,1,630437044X,I really wanted to like this movie but I just didn't. I'm not sure if they were serious but the action was contrived and the acting was head shaking bad. I felt like I was being laughed at during the entire movie -- and insulted because of it. Not recommended.,1395705600,,260,4.22

BLOOD HOOK is REALLY BAD. And no, I didn't find it ""so bad it's good.""

* NO HUMOR. I'm guessing the ""humor"" is supposed to derive from the poor acting. Bad dull-acting by most of the cast. Bad over-acting by the villains. The usual crazy eyes and hammy grimaces in lieu of talent. It's as if the filmmaker and cast knew they had no talent, so they thought, ""Let's just go with being REALLY bad. Yeah, that's always funny!""

No, it's not.

Contrary to some reviewers' claims, this film has NO ""Wisconsin humor."" I say this because the ""humor"" is identical to all bad films that are supposed to be funny, but aren't. No ""unique"" humor. No cheese jokes, if that's what you're looking for.

Some lame attempts at funny dialog. The killer catches a girl, and she tries to talk him out of killing her. ""Oh, you still want to kill me""? she says. ""Okay, I can live with that.""

* LITTLE GORE. The ""special effects"" are extremely poor. A large fish hook is tossed at someone, and he screams, pretending to have been hooked. Sometimes we see lots of blood. More often we don't see anything. I'm guessing the bad special effects are also supposed to be hilarious. They're not.

Most of the killings and attacks are OFF-SCREEN, so we don't even see the bad effects. For instance, you see a man's shocked face. He grabs his face. He falls into the water. That's it.

Or you see a boat coming at a girl in the lake. She screams. Another shot of the boat coming closer. And that's the end of the scene.

I was BORED. I kept looking at the timer. I was shocked and disheartened when I saw that I was only 34 minutes into the film. It felt like at least an hour. The film just dragged, and dragged, with lots of chatter by bad non-actors.

I could have given this film 2 stars, if I wasn't so bored.

I'm a big fan of 1980s slasher films, and quite tolerant of the subgenre. Troma films aren't so bad when they don't try to be too funny.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mother-s-Day/dp/B008DL4LN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mother's Day</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Splatter-University/dp/B00HJD3PTO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Splatter University</a>&nbsp;were bad films, but because the emphasis was on shocks and gore, and the humor only a small part, I enjoyed those films.

But Troma films fail when they go all out for comedy. Troma humor is like spice. A little humor enlivens the horror. But too much humor takes all the fright out.",1390348800,,2918,5.333333333333333
854571,5,630437044X,"This is a GREAT B movie. The production was great, considering the budget, and the whole movie is a certified cult classic.
For the money, some of the best set decorating in the biz..!",1374364800,,184,4.4411764705882355
854572,1,630437044X,Bought this movie as a gag gift for a musky fisherman who lives near the lake where this was filmed.  Thought he would enjoy the FIB jokes.,1366329600,,139,4.148148148148148
854573,5,630437044X,"Blood Hook is one of those movies where the plot is intentioally written for it to be a ""bad"" film - so much that it becomes a great Troma classic. It takes a great movie to become a classic. This is a GREAT B MOVIE! The fact that it's bad enough to never be released into mainstream theaters and only to Troma video is significant to its attractiveness. This movie could be coined as a cult classic that should be watched at parties or with friends. The acting is B-grade, as well as the plot and overall storyline. But what makes it great is that there are many comic-horror moments where the viewer will find themselves laughing or smiling in amusement at the movie's over-the-top attitude. So, for a fun but mediocre scared time, buy BLOOD HOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1289779200,,798,4.8321167883211675
854574,1,630437044X,"Everyone that rated this movie a 5 owes me a few pennies and a small fraction of my life back.
I like a good B-Rate movie now and then, but this title offered only faintest bit of humor to keep me watching.  The acting was beyond bad, even for a B-rate title.  Just a bad, bad movie.",1254528000,,283,3.9473684210526314
854575,5,630437044X,"This movie saved my life.  Prior to watching I was just a weak person barely able to face the challenges in my meager life.  Heck- just walking upstairs from my mom's basement made me shake with fear (partially because of the pit bull).  But now I'm a changed man.  Bloodhook = steroids for me.

Now I get up each day ready to tackle the Leroy Luedke's in my life.  Last week it was walking through some of those crazy skateboarding kids and yesterday it was a TV dinner.  Who knows what it will be today.  But one thing is for sure..........with the thoughts of the venerable Peter VanClease in my mind I'm sure to overcome the challenge.

Some people have Tony Robbins or Zig Ziglar.  For me it's Bloodhook.  If you're looking for a confidence boost or a road map to tackling life's challenges this movie is for you.

Thank you Peter VanClease!",1181260800,5,846,4.457516339869281

This movie is a cheesy horror flick made in 1986, BEFORE Mystery Science Theater, directed by future MST3K director James (Jim) Mallon. I checked IMDB just to make sure it was the same person!

7869120,2,630437044X,Blood Hook is 1 of those perfect movies to watch if you don't have anything else better to do & are looking to pass the time away or want to watch something cheezy. Somebody's going around killing people by catching them like fish with a giant fishing lure. That's something I've never heard of before & I knew I just had to see it. If you ever get the chance to check out Blood Hook I'd say go for it. Not only is it a slasher type movie but it's got some comedy thrown in as well.if nothing else at least watch it once,1432080000,,520,4.009615384615385
