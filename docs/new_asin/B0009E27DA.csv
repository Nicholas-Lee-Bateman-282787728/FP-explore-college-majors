2280619,4,B0009E27DA,"This series has to rank with the very top comedy series of all of TV's history.  The only reason I am not giving a 5 star for this DVD is that it does not include the retrospective.  Those of us who are all out fans want to have this in our collection.  I hope that they get the feedback and have the wisdom to put this in the final season's DVD. It is definitely my favorite comedy series ever.  The cast selection was brilliant.  The writers were the best and did a brilliant job of displaying the quirks of a dysfunction loving family.  I do not agree that it copied Mad About You.  Some experiences in family life, USA style, are almost across the board.  This cast's interpretations of that are unique and display the scope of their acting abilities.  Mad About You was an excellent show but does not come close to the cast of lovable characters in this show.  Many of my friends, with children and parents, relate to these hysterical stories.",1125964800,9,948,4.396551724137931

2280621,5,B0009E27DA,"""Everyboyd Loves Raymond"" may have ended...but that doesn't mean it's history! This show is one of the last quality family comedy's out there...and will be remembered forever!

The finale was an amazing end to this great series...they kept it simple...no one died, no one got divorced, no one left...the show started out as a great show about a family, and ended as a great show about a family!

Although I believe they could have added bonus features to this disc, it is still a must buy for everybody!",1120089600,7,503,4.704545454545454
2280622,3,B0009E27DA,"o.k...the 'attached ' pilot episode is useless if you have the first season set of dvd's, but if you don't, you get one of the funniest moments from the show's entire run(the scene where marie realizes that the 'fruit of the month' club sends fruit every month)...simply priceless...now, the finale...well, it was a good 'episode', with not much more going for it, except for the fact that, after all the annoying arguing that all the characters have been going through the last few seasons(with the obvious assumption that ray and debra would divorce), it was nice to see an ending that showed them what really matters most in their lives...that having been said, please, can at least one person tell me why everybody thinks this show is so great...yes, it's good, and funny, and patricia heaton deserves alot of the credit, but...hasn't anybody realized that this is a COMPLETE rip-off of the brilliant ""MAD ABOUT YOU""...he's a 'basic' new yorker, she's an 'upper' new englander...he's creative, she's more business oriented...her parents are a bit snooty, his parents are more-than-a-bit-annoying...it's the same show, only MAD ABOUT YOU did it first and did it better...if you even compare many of the scripts, the stories are identical, and some of the lines are even the same...they didn't even bother to change some of the lines(there's gotta be a lawsuit in here somewhere)...with that having been said, despite the obvious 'borrowing' from the funniest show ever on television, ""everybody loves raymond"" also had it's moments, and for that, i give them their due...",1119657600,7,1574,5.081081081081081
2280623,5,B0009E27DA,"This show is one of the funniest shows I have ever seen (next to Friends and Will and Grace). It is about Ray, a newspaper columnist, living with his family, and his intrusive parents live across the street.  Deborah is Ray's wife. She constantly needs to balance her own three kids and a husband. It is much harder for her when Marie keeps sub-consciously insulting Deborah's cleaning, cooking, and parenting. If you watch the show, you know what to expect when she reacts to things.  Marie is Ray and Robert's overbearing mother. Whenever she gets in people's way, her excuse is ""I do it for love"".  Frank is the most blunt, couch-potatolike,  and one of the most funniest characters I have ever watched. He keeps calling Marie a nag and the most contact he has with her is when Marie is told by Frank ""Make me: eggs, a sandwich, bacon, steak, and other foods. Marie doesn't mind at all. Frank and Marie are what you call a ""dysfunctional loving family"". The one left out is Robert. He's Ray's brother. He works as a police officer in the NYPD. Everytime he comes home with good news, Ray trumps that and gets all of the attention. These two are usually seen competeing for their parents attention. Whenever Deborah wants Ray and/or Robert that their parents (Frank and Marie) are doing something wrong, the two sons always come up with a reason to not tell them that they are doing something wrong.(For example: Marie comes over to Ray's house everyday, Marie continues to control the family without knowing it.",1119139200,3,1514,4.680451127819549
2280624,4,B0009E27DA,"I'm disappointed, like others who have already posted their review, that the Series Finale DVD failed to include the retrospective that aired on CBS before the final episode. I already have the Season One DVD, why do I need the pilot episode again?

Aside from that mistake, the final episode of ""Raymond"" was touching, if not a little subdued. I liked how all the main characters(even the seldom seen kids) gathered around the kitchen table at the end for one long shot that gradually faded into darkness. Patricia Heaton, the sexiest 47-year old woman I've ever seen on TV, is the centerpiece of the finale. When she is staring at Ray, we all feel for her as it dawns on her that she would be lost without him in her life. Unfortunately for us, the viewing audience...well, now, we are lost without him.

Goodbye, ""Raymond"". We'll miss you.",1117843200,12,842,4.6824324324324325
2280625,3,B0009E27DA,"When I heard that the final episode of EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND was being released so soon after it originally aired, I kept my fingers crossed that the Producers and those who are responsible for putting out these DVDs learned a lesson from the release of the FRIENDS finale, and would be sure to include the one-hour retrospect which aired immediately before the final show aired.

Unfortunately, this didn't happen.  Once again, viewers are given the pilot episode and final episode together on one disc - no retrospect.  Why is this?  Most dedicated viewers who collect these DVDs already have the first season, which includes the pilot - why include this with the final episode?  It makes no sense.  And the special that Raymond produced had everything to do with the production and making of the final episode - wouldn't it have made sense to include this one-hour special, which included behind the scene footage showing how this final show finally got made??

I don't know about anyone else, but when I watch the final episode of one of my favorite shows, I like to go back afterwards and relive some of my favorite moments.  These one-hour retrospects allow viewers to do this.  You can revisit some of your favorite, classic moments, and recall why it is that this was one of your favorite TV shows.

I'm still hoping that when Season 10 of FRIENDS is released, it's ""extras"" include the one-hour retrospect which aired immediately before the final show, and now I hope that the same thing happens with the release of Season 9 of EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND.  After all, these specials sum up why these shows are one of our favorites, and wrap up all of out favorite moments in one neat little package - don't they deserve to be watched over & over again, along with the final episode?

I give the DVD 2 stars for the missing retrospect and inclusion of the pilot epsiode, while the episode itself gets 4 stars - which averages out to a 3.",1117152000,103,1944,4.668621700879766
2280626,5,B0009E27DA,"Patricia Heaton was the heart and soul of this episode, the series finale.  I got so choked up when she was talking to the nurse and she turned and cried out to her brother-in-law.  And minutes later, she just sits on the bed and stares at Ray eating ice cream.  You know exactly what is going through her character's mind, and she plays it subtly instead of broadly, and it is brilliant!

Always loved this show's actors, but Heaton just got better and better each season.  I hope she chooses this episode to submit for Emmy consideration.  She would be a lock for the win!

By the way, the nurse in the episode is holding a pencil.  No one uses a pencil when writing in the medical record.  Pen only.  Don't know why that jumped out at me, but it did.",1116547200,59,753,4.276595744680851

2280758,5,B0009E27DA,"This is without a doubt one of the funniest shows on TV. Each character is so distinct and will probably remind you of somebody in your own family. Unlike most sitcoms, which seem to take really unrealistic characters and throw them into unrealistic situations, Raymond works taking a normal situation and exaggerating it to show the humor. I pull these DVDs out whenever I need a laugh. They're well worth the cost.",1257206400,,416,4.791666666666667

2280762,3,B0009E27DA,"After 9 years of Barone mayhem the writers obviously decided on a nice safe and cosy ending to the show. It could be a trap to try and fill the last 40 minutes or so with the best of the best, so they chose a serene almost lame conclusion to the series.

2280765,5,B0009E27DA,"I always felt that some of the best episodes in this series were the ones that were funny, but also had a twinge of emotion mixed in. It would be a stretch to say that Ray and Debra exhibited a lot of sensitive and dramatic moments together. Then again, it would also be incorrect to say that these things were nonexistent in the show--in fact, there was arguably a fairly generous spoonful of them placed over the show's 9-year run. In any case, the final episode showcases some interactions between the two that were never shown quite as sweetly at any other time in the show, and the creators made a smart move by bowing out with this special tone while still maintaining the classic humor we've come to love.

The final season of ""Raymond,"" as a whole, was surprisingly hilarious and memorable for a series that has been on the air for nine years. They really did an impeccable job at keeping it real with genuine and funny episodes. In the finale, Ray's visit to the hospital for some minor surgery suddenly turns into a dramatic near-death experience. The scare lasts only about 30 seconds, but it is enough to upset the family. The episode goes down the emotional road with the noticeably more affectionate behavior Debra exhibits toward Ray the night after his surgery, along with the rare affection that Ray returns to her and, representing an even larger rarity, the fear in Frank's eyes when he realized he almost lost his younger son. Sounds very emotional, but they balance it out with the hilarity by showing Ray and Marie's reactions when they find out that Ray almost died.

The success of this final episode is very controversial among fans; some absolutely loved it, while others felt it was not as good as it could have been and were disappointed. I am one of those people who feel that they could not have possibly done a better job with the finale episode of a 9-season series. I'm not going to lie and say that there are some people or ideas I would have liked to see (having Amy announce a pregnancy would have been great, but maybe they are saving that kind of extra-special material for a potential reunion speial). I imagine the writers put a great deal of thought and planning into this very highly-anticipated episode. It is VERY difficult to come up with a final hurrah that will please the vast majority, and with a show like this you had to expect that they would go in this direction that they did for the last episode. Even though we all know these characters must obviously love each other, it was important for the finale to have a touching and more heartfelt plot, and with the laugh-out-loud moments they weaved in here, I think it came out perfectly. As Ray Romano and Phil Rosenthal always said, ""When we do the sensitive stuff, it's short, it's sweet, and it's earned."" Every last second of sweetness in this episode was well-deserved, perfectly scripted, and brilliantly acted.

The way I see it, there was a real possibility that the writers could have tried way too hard and ended up with something too over-the-top for the finale. However, typical of the show's classy and low-key ways, they kept it simple, maintaining their usual formula and not acting like they had to make it something it wasn't. They obviously realized that no matter what they did, some people would like it and others would not, so it was best to develop the finale almost as a normal old episode, with a few special surprises and sensitive moments to acknowledge that closure in the show itself. I am just really impressed that they did it this way.

All in all, it was a terrific episode and a very classy way to conclude the successful series. Fans who are partial to those tender moments are treated to just that when Ray and Debra openly express their underlying love for each other at the end of the episode, but it is fleshed out with the funny stuff that, miraculously, has not grown a bit stale even after 9 years. Everybody Loves Raymond was such a great show because it didn't throw any major curveballs or screwy developments just to get ratings, as many shows today tend to do. They kept the plot simple and consistent all 9 seasons--general marriage and family life--and just kept up the amazing writing to keep it fresh and enjoyable all the way through.

So there you have it: This show ended on top of its game, just as funny as ever, bowing out with grace and humility, before the public had a chance to grow tired of them. That's the perfect way to do it--with more left to be desired (and hopefully, with some luck, we will get at least one reunion special in the future). The finale tied up those couple of loose knots with the emotionally sweet Ray/Debra scenes that redefined what the show was really about. Sure, they got at each other's throats constantly throughout the series, but there was always that unspoken yet completely evident acceptance and love for each other tucked beneath. This finale episode got it down just right--it was sweet and incredibly touching, and yet it was all balanced out so evenly that nobody can ever accuse it of being too cheesy or over-the-top.

The writing for the finale was terrific and the cast was excellent as always--especially Patricia Heaton. She truly get better with each passing season--more so than any of the other cast members, in my opinion--and she has fantastic on-screen chemistry with Romano. It's amazing to me how this woman managed to play off such a wide range of emotions--anger, frustration, crying, hollaring, everything. She is indeed, as another reviewer has said here, ""the heart and soul of this episode,"" and her performance adds even more likability to the well fleshed out character she has developed over the past 9 years.

This is, beyond a reasonable doubt, one of the very few long-lasting sitcoms out there that could have easily stood to continue with a 10th season, and it is sad that they did not, but on the other hand, the fact that they bowed out with such humility just makes me feel even more respect for all those who devoted their years and efforts to such a contemporary masterpiece. I will miss this show tremendously but will always love watching the reruns on TV and DVD (which is already planning the release of Season 6 and is shaping up to possibly have the whole series out within the next year) and remembering how well it did for itself for nine VERY successful years. Of course, all fans will want to have at least one reunion special to look forward to in the future (personally, as I said before, I would love to see Robert and Amy return with a child), and with a show this great and actors with this rare type of likability, I have no doubt it will happen.",1137888000,33,6698,4.614093959731544
2280766,5,B0009E27DA,"I caught this on TV on the day it showed. It was excellent! It's a shame the series came to an end. but this was worth the time!

Ray has something very weird about him: he has an infection. He goes to the doctors to get it taken care of... But then the Doctor tells Debra that Ray is dead and upsets the family. But it turns out he was unconscious for a few seconds. Then, Ray has Ice cream to cool what happened earlier. Then, Marie, Frank and Rob get upset.

Also, I like how the ""where's lunch"" thing says ""No charge, thank you!""",1127520000,7,533,4.066666666666666
2280767,4,B0009E27DA,"On May 16, 2005, the cast of Everbody Loves Raymond, said good-bye to thier fans, for at least for new episodes, but the show still airs on repeats, even through the episode was taped far in advance. And this is how they said good-bye to thier fans, but at least to me, that this doesn't seem like a real series finale to me, a series final is when the cast says good-bye to each other, and there is all this drama, but I guess a series finale doesn't have to be like this, since you don't see the characters saying good-bye to each other.

In the finale, Raymond ""Ray"" Barone (Ray Romano) has to have his adenoids out, and he thinks that they will cut him open, to get his adenoids out, but his wife Debra Barone (Patricia Heaton) tells him that they will go in through his mouth, but Ray doesn't want the doctors going through his mouth. And then who comes to protect him is his Mom Marie Barone (Doris Roberts), and she brings him soup, but that doesn't stop his father Frank Barone (Peter Boyle) and his brother Robert Barone (Brad Garrett) follows to the house. The next scene, the family is at the hopsital, in the waiting room, and then Marie goes to the bathroom, when the nurse (Henriette Mantel) comes out, and brings the news that Ray is having trouble waking up from, the stuff that knocked him out, and it looks like he had died. And with barely any time to grief, then the doctor (Charles Chun) comes out, and says that Ray is fine, they brought him out of stuff that knocked him off. Then Amy tells Robert and Frank, that nobody tells Raymond, and then Frank says ""or his mother"". So in the next season, Ray is home, and is in bed with Marie, and he is eating ice cream, and they are talking, and she doesn't make him thinjk there is something going on. But Franks is bed, thinking, and Marie is trying to get some sleep, but he turns down the pie that is left in the refistator, and he starts rubbuing Marie on the back, that gets her thinking that something is going on, Frank tries to deny it, but she gets it out of him.

In the pilot, Ray is on a vaction, and is due to return home but he is late. And so he returns home, just in time for her birthday, and while Ray was away, his parents and his brother have been coming over un-annouced, and she is tired of it. But of course, they still do that when he returns, so Ray offers for her to go out for a night, and he stays home to babysit, the kids Ally Barone (Madylin Sweeten), Geoffrey Barone (Sawyer Sweeten) and Michael Barone (Sullivan Sweeten). And while she is out, Leo (Stephen Lee) comes over, and asks Ray to go out and have pizza with him, Ray doesn't want to at first, but then his mom comes over, and Leo asks her to stay and watch the kids, and manges to get Ray to agree, but he does, and decides to be gone for 1 hour, and returns to his father and brother, at his home as well, and he gets them to leave, but Debra still finds out that they were over, and asks Ray to tell his parents and brother not to come over on her birthday.",1126569600,7,3018,4.174957118353345
