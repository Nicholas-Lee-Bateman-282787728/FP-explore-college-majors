6019600,1,B001JDY20G,"This movie was upsetting for a lot of reasons. It's more of an indoctrination than a kid's movie. It has an agenda. It wasn't entertaining to my family...it was more creepy than fun. The acting, the props, etc., weren't good at all, either. Each to their own but I wouldn't have watched this if I'd known what it was first.",1417737600,,323,4.4
6019601,3,B001JDY20G,"Three Stars with consideration that this is geared to ages, perhaps 3 1/2 - 8. Still, that's quite an expanse of age but I think it would hold the attention of that age group. It was sweet, easy to follow and I thought lovely. I'm not into the secularism of Christmas but our children ARE exposed to Santa Claus by the commercialism of this Holy event. We can take advantage of that and gently lead them into the truthful nature of why we celebrate Christmas. This was not a highly funded project but I thought it had more merit than the one star rating when I discovered it.",1415923200,4,575,4.333333333333333
6019602,1,B001JDY20G,I bought this DVD looking for the classic 'Toy Boy' from the Wichita area television show from the mid 1980s. This is NOT it. This is a very poorly acted video and the Toy Boy voice and and character are NOT the original. It is a creepy Toy Boy puppet. Don't waste your money! I will be throwing this video in the pile for good will if I am not able to return it.,1276646400,5,363,3.918918918918919

8617739,5,B001JDY20G,Very nostalgic Christmas program. Henry Harvey was a great 'Santa' and better person!!!  Loved it!!!,1453507200,,100,5.666666666666667
8617740,4,B001JDY20G,It's really more corny than cute; but I enjoyed it none*the*less. I would recomend this for 5 to 8 year olds. It's totally G rated and not too long.  Merry Christmas !!!,1451433600,,169,4.28125
8617741,5,B001JDY20G,"This TV series, once titled Santas Workshop, was filmed and aired in my hometown when I was a child.  It aired almost nightly throughout the month of December until Christmas Eve arrived.  I sat glued to the TV each night when this magical series aired, as close to the TV as my mother would allow, filled with such joy and excitement.  Henry Harvey (if I'm not mistaken) is the name of the man who portrays Santa and he has the best HO-HO-HO I've ever heard!!  Henry was a local TV news personality, so he does quite a good acting job here.  He also portrayed a character named Freddy Fudd on another local TV series.  Santa (Henry) exudes such a kindness and love for children in the inflection of his voice and his singing is quite beautiful and sincere.  I've seen an episode of Santas Workshop where he sings a Christmas carol - Silent Night I think.  Absolutely beautiful!!!!!!
Adults who, like myself, watched Santa's Workshop as a child and for sentimental reasons, contacted the local TV stations and requested that any archived video be made available as DVD's quite a few years ago, so there are just a few more episodes available on DVD.  This episode of Santas Workshop shown here, portrayed Santa interacting with a puppet named Toy Boy.  Some episodes portray Santa interacting with a puppet named KAKE Man (a play on words as KAKE was the name of the TV station putting it on).  KAKE Man is a baker wearing a chef hat who baked cakes for Santa (made of Styrofoam) and together the two counted down the days until Christmas, filling children to the brim with anticipation!  Santa wore bells on his wrists and would splay his arms in an arc and circular motion above his head to simulate the world; the bells jubilantly ringing, as he excitedly proclaimed, Only 12 (or whichever number of days) days KAKE Man until Santa and his reindeer, with Rudolph leading the way with his big red nose lit, will go ZZOOOMMMMIIIINNNGGG around the big wide world, to deliver toys to all the good boys and girls!!!  Then he would rest his arms upon his pillow stuffed plump belly, heaving up and down as he bellowed Ah-HOo-HOo-HOo-HOo-HOo-HOo repeatedly, with such conviction, animation, and JOY!  KAKE Man would then clap his hands together, bending his head forward and circling his head in a motion to simulate zooming around the world in unison with Santa.  So cute and AWESOME!!!  Almost more than a kid could possibly contain!
Further info on the version shown here of Santa's Workshop (may have other names too by now) might be obtained by contacting:  KAKE TV: 1500 N. West Street, Wichita, KS 67203-1323, (316) 943-4221.  Some versions may have been sponsored by another TV station as well, but KAKE TV could direct you appropriately.  I hope you contact them and request more info, more episodes to be available, etc. to promote an awareness and love for this sweet, sweet TV series that first aired in the late 50's or early 60's.
Many more episodes and clips can also be viewed on youtube.  I adore Henry Harvey and his portrayal of Santa.  His goodness and kindness as a human being are evident.  I think that Henry Harvey's son may have carried on his Dad's tradition by recreating more recent episodes where he represents Santa.  Now, all that I have expressed in this review is just to the best of my recollection and knowledge anyhow.  Mrs. Claus in this video is also exceptionally sweet and pleasant, but I don't know as much about her.  I'M A BELIEVER FOREVER!",1450137600,,3479,4.6732348111658455
8617742,5,B001JDY20G,"This show is geared to preschoolers. My kindergartener loved it, but my 3rd grader got bored due to the slow pace. I rated it 5 stars based on my youngest son's fascination and the fact that it is a rare preschool-aged show that I can actually stand to watch, LOL. Plus it has good lessons and the Christmas story. We did not find Toy Boy to be creepy, just a goofy, hyper puppet. Actually the puppet is the one thing my 3rd grader thought was funny. Santa talks to a snow mailman (ok he was a bit annoying), a live deer, a puppet, and Mrs. Santa. My son loved watching Santa at the North pole. Near the end of the show Santa reads the Christmas story from the Bible with charming illustrations - thus the title ""and the True Meaning of Christmas"" and the picture of Bethlehem on the cover of the movie. (One reviewer must've missed those clues.) Even the non-religious can learn the story of the first Christmas, as this is not a preachy movie. (Santa even says the children should ask their parents to read them the story of Christmas the way their parents want them to know it.) Don't expect a family movie the whole family will enjoy since its target audience is quite young, but if you have a preschooler or kindergartener they will love this cute little show.",1449705600,,1265,4.410256410256411
