8376587,4,B002P3LQ26,"While on the least likely/most ostensible fishing trip ever, three men -- a naf, a tough guy, and the troubled co-worker who pines for the latter's wife -- exchange insights into marriage, love, and loss. Well acted (by Casella especially) and ultimately quite touching, it was exactly the sort of talky, arty chick-flick I enjoy . . . only with plenty of f-bombs and no actual chicks. :-) If that description didn't put you off -- and it wasn't intended to -- then this film is well worth an hour of your time (and a steal at the few dollars it cost me to click).",1437091200,,564,4.380952380952381
8376588,4,B002P3LQ26,"I am enamored by the diversity of Anthony Rapp.  I have yet to see a ceiling on his talent.  This movie puts a new twist on 'company morale'.  It is a simple story with a lot to say.  Three men duke it out over love and policy.  It's amazing these men can get anything done at work with the intense personal intolerance they hold for each other.  I recommend this movie to those whose frustration with corporate BS surfaces daily, the boss who looks down on people (my place of business is filled with them) and the employees too scared and paranoid to even breathe.  Good show!",1313107200,,578,4.345794392523365
