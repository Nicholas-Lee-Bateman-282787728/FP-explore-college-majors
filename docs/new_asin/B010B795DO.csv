8721726,1,B010B795DO,"I was a big fan of ""I Am Comic,"" which did a great job of highlighting the life of a comic while still being entertaining.  I figured this film would be as good as the original, albeit with more current comics, but I was wrong.  While the central theme of the first movie was Ritch Shydner's return to stand-up, the central theme of this one is a ""hell gig"" Wayne Federman and Jordan Brady are going to play in suburban Washington.  The first film had great anecdotes interspersed with comedy material or simply the funny things comics had to say about their business, but this film lacks all of those.",1505692800,,602,4.454545454545454
8721727,3,B010B795DO,I'm always interested to hear about the life of comics.  It's interesting that none of them were comedic in their responses while interviewed in the film.  Are we only funny when on stage?,1463184000,,188,4.666666666666667
