8092635,1,B000BTJDI0,"The blurb on the back of the box may say ""commemorating 25 years"" but Death Of A Beatle does nothing of the sort. It was originally made in 2000, apparently as part of a cable series called Mugshots. The main ""attraction"" of this disc is audio excerpts of a prison interview with Lennon's killer and insights from Jack Jones, a journalist who befriended him. What we learn is that the killer was, and continues to be, a deeply disturbed creature who wanted to hurt as many people as possible and decided that killing someone as beloved as John Lennon would be the easiest way to hurt millions by proxy.

Death of a Beatle is not a film about John Lennon for people who are interested in music. It's a film about a killer for people who are interested in crime. There's nothing wrong with this, in and of itself. The problem is that it's pitched at entirely the wrong audience for entirely the wrong reason. Sirhan Sirhan is a perfectly legitimate subject for a documentary, but you wouldn't then try to dress it us as a commemoration of Robert Kennedy.

The killer's life story is shown in contrast to Lennon's, and alongside interviews with officers who attended the scene, we have recollections of Lennon and the news of his death from people like Pete Best, Neil Innes and radio announcer Andy Peebles. It's difficult to say whether these three were part of the original Mugshots program, or whether their parts were added later to make this DVD look more like a tribute than a true crime doco. In any case, they could be forgiven for not knowing what kind of film they were participating in, because there seems to be nothing connecting their stories to those of the emergency workers on duty that night or the people who knew the killer.

On its own merits, Death of a Beatle would rate 3 stars, but it loses one for the cynical misdirection and another for the gratuitous trickle of blood down the cover.",1240617600,,1910,4.578947368421052
8092636,4,B000BTJDI0,"As a huge Beatles fan, it was hard to watch this documentary and interview stuff. At the same time, I enjoy knowing how regretful he is and how depressing his life is now-deservedly so. There a 2 DVD's with some interesting interviews from various people involved at the time, etc.
As someone who will never forget that day, it is never the less a fascinating reminder of what happened and why.",1182211200,,394,4.563380281690141
