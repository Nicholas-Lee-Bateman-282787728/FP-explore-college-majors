5612556,5,B00BEZEGD2,"This pack comes with 2 DVDs.  I think our favorite is the ""Neck & Shoulders"" one because that's where the two of us have most of our issues, as opposed to middle or lower back.  Some positions are very advanced, but if it wasn't challenging, it wouldn't be worth it.  We get a nice sweat by the end, too.",1387065600,,304,4.11864406779661
5612557,4,B00BEZEGD2,"First, anyone purchasing this DVD should be aware that it is a compilation of two of instructor Desiree Rambaugh's previous releases,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-to-the-Rescue-Back-Pain/dp/B004A7UXGK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga to the Rescue: Back Pain</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-to-the-Rescue-Neck-Shoulders/dp/B004A7QS14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga to the Rescue: Neck & Shoulders</a>.  Although Rambaugh teaches both of these routines accompanied by a background exerciser who shows modifications, and many of the poses ARE appropriate for beginners, there really isn't enough instruction provided overall for those who are brand-new to yoga.  In addition, the ""Yoga to the Rescue"" series is better thought of general maintenance to help keep muscles strong and healthy; I would NOT recommend these practices for those with serious pain and/or more severe limitations.

I have broken down each of the two practices below.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-to-the-Rescue-Back-Pain/dp/B004A7UXGK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga to the Rescue: Back Pain</a>
This was the earlier release, and as such it is a bit less polished.  Rambaugh mostly leads the workout using voiceover instruction, although she breaks in live at times to provide more specific tips. The first six chapters (about 8 minutes) focus mainly on the fundamentals of good standing posture.  Rambaugh then moves through a series of basic standing postures to warm up the back, including chair pose, cat/cow, downward dog, sphinx/cobra, and locust.  The lower back in particular is targeted through several lunge variations as well as a seated twist. Because weak abdominal muscles can contribute to lower back problems, challenging abdominal core exercises are performed in a reclined position--e.g., crunches, leg lifts, and pendulum.  Some additional backbending postures follow, upping the intensity level with bow, camel, and bridge. The practice then begins to wind down through a series of stretches, including lying hamstring stretch, outer hip stretch, and windshield wipers.  Rambaugh offers some final postural tips in the reclined position and practice concludes with a savasana (relaxation) that is just under four minutes long, bringing in the total time at approximately 65.5. minutes.

One important change which Rumbaugh made for this routine is that there are two separate 30-minute practice segments: the ""Tutorial"" offers more comprehensive instruction plus a detailed review of modifications for most of the postures, whereas the ""Flow Sequence"" is a faster-moving, more dynamic session based on the postures introduced during the tutorial. For both segments, Rumbaugh has an assistant, Andrew Riven, who displays the modified versions of the poses. Rumbaugh instructs the Tutorial segment via voiceover, although a few of the segments are preceded by brief live introductions. The chapters of the Tutorial are as follows:
*Wall Shoulder Stretch & Chair Pose
*Neck Strengthening
*Push-Ups
*Sphinx & Cobra
*Bow Pose
*Down Dog
*Locust Pose
*Side-to-Side Leg Lifts
*Crunches
*Lunge with Twist
*Side Plank
*Shoulder Stand
*Bridge, Plow & Shoulder Stand
*Relaxation

I took a live workshop with Desire Rumbaugh back in the fall of 2008, and she was just wonderful, absolutely radiant and incredibly helpful.  Admittedly, the full benefits of personality do not completely come across in the DVD format.  Still, I would recommend this DVD set for experienced yoga beginners and beyond who are looking to maintain health in their back, neck, and shoulders.",1379894400,16,3891,6.431034482758621
5612558,5,B00BEZEGD2,An extremely helpful DVD filled with simple instructions about how yoga can help alleviate back and neck pain.  Desiree is a master teacher who has extensive knowledge about yoga and about the human body.  The DVD is a top notch tool for those with back and neck issues.,1373328000,,270,4.604166666666667
5612559,5,B00BEZEGD2,"""Yoga to the Rescue"" Series is a very inspiring program. While there are countless beautiful DVDs available targeted to people with no athletic background or yoga experience, Desire Rumbaugh provides rare insight to those who have taken a yoga class or participated in other physical activities. As a Yoga Instructor and Yoga Therapist I always recommend her DVDs. My clients are not looking for a flowing workout, but for sincere ideas on how to improve their quality of life, making it more pain free. Both my beginner and advanced students found these DVDs helpful. It encourages them to stay active and work on their ""prescribed"" exercises. In addition to directional instructions, Desire uses cues that empower you mentally.
As with everything if you have health issues, you should consult with your doctor. In addition you might benefit from attending yoga classes or private sessions to build body awareness, a DVD can simply not replace the personal feedback an instructor can provide you with. I hope we will see more of Desire's videos in the future.",1373328000,3,1060,5.062857142857143
5612560,4,B00BEZEGD2,The instructions are a little choppy.  I would be afraid if someone who truly has neck problems attempted to do some of these moves.  I would go to a chiropractor before attempting them.,1372377600,6,186,4.606060606060606
5612561,1,B00BEZEGD2,"I had ordered this DVD with high hopes that it would be just what I was looking for for neck, shoulder, & back pain relief. It said it was easy & effective.....maybe so if your advanced in yoga......maybe or to prevent future pain.

If your having pain issues with your neck or back or not flexible it is not going to be easy to do any one of these exercises. I really don't think many people with neck or back pain would be able to do the exercises.

Was very very disappointed as I could not do any of these exercises at all.  If I could return it I would, was a total waste of time & money for me.",1369699200,8,600,3.9833333333333334
