4897927,5,B005W2BWLC,Absolutely love this series I highly recommend it to any one who likes anime!!!! This series is full of action and comedy!!,1330646400,,123,4.636363636363637
4897928,5,B005W2BWLC,"One of the best things about this series is it's mix of action and adventure you get with any good dramatic storyline, with some well placed humour mixed in. Part 3 looks further into the back stories of Lucy, Erza and Loke. A plethora of new charachters is introduced plus some new romance?!? (I won't give too much away). There is a bit of filler with this series, but usually only 1 episode in duration and sometimes you need the filler to break up the story arcs which span several episodes in this series.

 I'm well and truly addicted, plus one of the great bonuses with these DVD/Bluray combo packs is to date (Parts 1, 2 and 3) they have been compatible with my Australian Bluray Player. They are Region 1,2 and 4 on DVD and Region A + B on Bluray, and I must say the Bluray is stunning. I'm seriously excited about Part 4 and hopefully my review has been helpful for my fellow Australian, English, European and New Zealand Fans.",1329177600,8,937,4.410404624277457
4897929,5,B005W2BWLC,"Fairy Tail is in plain words Amazing! I love this show and highly recommend it to all who love anime or are looking to get into anime. This show is filled with characters that blend funny moments and action packed fights really well. This is all wrapped up in a beautiful story that is well put together and really makes the viewer feel for these characters. In all this show is great and you should buy it, well worth the money.",1329004800,,429,4.308641975308642
4897930,3,B005W2BWLC,"Lets face it if your looking at reviews for set 3 you probably like the show, and you know what so do i, but I'd like it a lot more without lucy. Why is she Evan part of this series. Oh I already know its shone and they some light fan service and some incredibly weak shallow romantic interest. Problem is, its shonen and that genre just dose not know how to have any type of closure, romantic interest or other wise. But then agien its shonen and there for is more focused on combat, which it dose pretty well, for something we've all seen before. Just some new charecters new super powers and alot of fighting. But why the hell do we have to see some useless sex appeal charecter so much in this set. If you like her power to you, I can't stand cleche useless sex appeal characters taking so much screen time. Seriesly this show is not all that great. The animation, while very vibrant in color, is not very good. Just compare it to newer bleach episodes, similar genre. Evan newer naruto episodes. This is just a very predictable shonen experience that we have all seen before. That being said I do enjoy it, unlike said shonen this series flows much better than others not as much wasted time and minimal filler. My only wish is that this series doesn't waste to many years of my life and can actually bring closure. I don't need to watch nor want to watch 500+ episodes of any series, that senslessly loses direction and desides to just push on for profits sake. And one last comment, why is there so much hate among us otaku/anime loving folk. There isn't enough of us as it is so just because someone has a differ of opinion dosent mean you should light them up. Lets just understand that anime is its own genre. God bless everyone!",1328572800,,1739,4.3538461538461535
4897931,5,B005W2BWLC,"An excellent series. Well written characters, thought out story, even the 'filler-arcs' (story arcs added to let the manga artist get the next story arc set up) are very well done.

Only complaint is the $50 msrp (I got it on sale) for 12 episodes. Not the worst pricing ever but still unnecessarily high.",1327968000,,305,4.648148148148148
4897932,2,B005W2BWLC,"This series about a guild of magicians, set in a magical, whimsical world of evil-doers and magic powers is watchable, but nothing to really write home about. What does it do well? It is your classic ""shonen"" type anime series with some cute girls, boisterous male leads, and battle featuring some pretty cool powers. You have the classic elemental powers in the mix with Natsu (fire) Grey (Ice) and Lucy to add the expected cuteness and fan-service. However well intentions were with this series it falls way short of being great. The sound track is generic (in comparison to a show like Darker than Black who got the legendary Yoko Kanno (cowboy bebop) to do theirs) and predictable fight scenes. Ill say this... imagine ""Bleach"" but with castles, armor and Magicians instead of Hollows, the Soul Society and soul reapers. This pretty much sums it up. Tite Kubo did this concept YEARS before Mashima did in Fairy Tail (and it wasn't all that original when Kubo did it either). It sadly cannot compare to to other recent hits like Death Note, Darker than Black, Baccano! or even the similar-plotted Bleach. Bleach basically does what Fairy Tail does but better. To sum up...good, watchable, but definitely nothing new, exciting or notable here. Plot is linear and predictable, the fights are well written but not spectacular and the art is *meh*. Mediocre overall. On a side note I met Hiro Mashima at NYCC 2011 and he was a really kind personable man.",1326672000,5,1453,4.816
4897933,5,B005W2BWLC,"Fairy Tail, by far, is one of the best new animes to come out in years. Fairy Tail started in Japan about 2 years ago. Since then, it has become one of the most popular animes in Japan and America. The Story is gripping, the animation is very high quality, And this one is almost perfect for the whole family (I say almost because in Japanese, there are a lot of sex related jokes. I know that is not everyone's cup of tea so fair warning). Based on the cover, this boxset will end the conflict with Phantom, that was started in the last boxset, and will begin telling Erza's past and her connection to the battles ahead. If you are going to buy this series though, I would highly recommend that you buy the first 2 boxsets. This can be a very hard series just to jump into. But I can guarantee you, If this is a random buy, you won't be disappointed. I have already ordered mine. I hope this helps your decision.",1325376000,9,913,4.222857142857142

4897942,5,B005W2BWLC,"These collection sets are definitely the best way to buy these episodes.  Being a huge fan of the series, I finally decided that I needed to put my money where my mouth is and support the people dubbing these series for us.  Fairy tail is an awesome series with great character development.  I love the characters. They are so quirky and fun that I have relived their adventures with them many times.",1493164800,2,400,4.527777777777778
4897943,5,B005W2BWLC,Another great collection to own for Fairy Tail fans!,1492473600,,52,4.888888888888889
4897944,5,B005W2BWLC,"Discs worked cleanly.
Fairy Tail is a fun, dungeon-inflated little story. Although it is aimed at kids 7-10, I'd recommend a 12+ audience. Like most anime, it has an Eastern mystic world view and goes a bit heavy on the fan service for young kids. I do try to be sure my kids understand what might be unacceptable before exposing them to questionable habits (like drinking), and know others may not agree with my concerns.
Be warned: There are at least 18 seasons of this one. We're on Season 3.",1489795200,,495,4.511111111111111
4897945,5,B005W2BWLC,"If you're looking at collection three, you probably are already familiar with Fairy Tail. Most of collection three follows the Oracion seis arc, which is a pretty fantastic story arc in my opinion. Filled with the usual hijinks and battles, collection three is great. It also offers some helpful backstory that collection two kind-of just ended with. Great format, nice that it comes with both blu-ray and dvd copies since my computer can only play dvds. Definitely recommend.",1487808000,,476,5.115384615384615

Weird that they don't have a bluray/dvd combo for a show as popular as One Piece or maybe thats the business plan - impatient fans will get the dvd collections, patient ons the blu rays and addicted both haha.

This DVD set consists of episodes 49 - 72. Which was originally released as Fairy Tail Part 5 & 6 separately. The next set Fairy Tail Collection 4 is officially coming out in June!

There are 8 discs included. Just so you know this is a DVD & Bluray combo pack meaning the Bluray is a copy of the DVD. So in reality it's 4 discs with four copies on Blu-ray.

The Blu-ray is amazing for the Fairy Tail series it just adds something that the DVDs don't have. The animation looks clearer and sharper. Not to mention the audio is better as well.

If you don't have the Part DVD sets yet or if you're like me and choose to wait patiently as you can for the Collection sets then this is worth picking up. It's much cheaper than buying both Part DVDs because you get 24 episodes instead 12. Plus this set consists of two story arcs of the series. At least for the first arc you don't have to buy 2 DVD sets to get the entire arc. And this one covers the main part of the second arc and leaves off with a good finish.

The english dubbing is amazing for this set. Dare I say its one of the best arcs both story/plot wise and just the voice acting as well. The Oracin Seis arc is the most memorable for a lot of fans. If you're looking for action, intense moments, jaw dropping revelations, tear jerking scenes, fun, comedy, and heart then this is the arc for you. It also introduces some great characters. The other arc the Daphne arc is not bad at all it's not the best filler arc but it still adds a lot of character development, fun, and some great battles.

~

The two Story Arcs included are:

Oracin Seis arc
When Oracin Seis, one of the top three Dark Guilds in Fiore makes a move at seizing an ancient and deadly Magic called Nirvana, an alliance of the Fairy Tail, Lamia Scale, Blue Pegasus and Cait Shelter guilds sets out to destroy it for good.

Daphne arc
A mysterious woman named Daphne traps Natsu, Wendy, Happy, and Carla. Even more mysteriously, Gray seems to have betrayed his guild to fulfill her evil plans.

I just wanted to add to anyone complaining about how long it has been since they released a Collection set. There is a good reason for that. If they released the collection in the same year that the part dvd sets came out then it would be poor judgment for marketing. Everyone would buy collection 3 and they'd ignore the part DVDs. They also have to see if the show is even selling well enough for it to be worth releasing a collection. Releasing it two years later is pain but at least they did it!

Thank you to everyone who bought the 5 & 6 part dvds you made it possible for this collection to even be released.",1420502400,38,3997,4.323962516733601
4898150,5,B005W2BWLC,all very good purchases,1419292800,,23,5.0

4898162,1,B005W2BWLC,"I am not really rating the anime itself here, but more the collection.  The anime is excellent but Funimation has done a poor job in packaging this series for the masses.  This set should have been issued somewhere in January to April of 2014 rather than waiting until January of 2015.  The first two collections were issued in 2013 which were for sets 1-4 and this collection represents sets 5 and 6.  By the end of this year they will have released 14 sets, so why did they take so long to release this collection?  I wanted to wait for the collections but Funimation took so long to release this one that I got tired of waiting and watched these episodes on Crunchyroll, so why would I buy these now?  Of course I eventually will, but not for 50 bucks, instead I will wait until there is a huge anime sale and pick the set up for 30 or less.  If you are trying to build an anime collection than go ahead and grab it, these collections are worth waiting for rather than picking up the sets as each collection is 2 sets for the price of one, but if you have a crunchyroll account than watch it there and wait for the price to drop.  I don't know if Funimation reads reviews on these sites or not, but if they do here is a bit of advice, pick up the pace guys because you are dropping the ball.",1415750400,7,1294,4.168674698795181
4898163,5,B005W2BWLC,"Fairy Tail is one of the best animes in recent memory, and it is by far a must watch.  This series has a little bit of everything from likable characters, good action, magic, and of course good humor.  These collections are a much better value than the pervious volumes, which only had half as many episodes.

Contains episodes 49-72.

If you are a Fairy Tail fan, (which I assume you are if reading this) and have Collections 1 and 2 already, then this is a NO BRAINER. Now to sit back and wait for Collection 4. See you in 2 years.",1414454400,18,331,3.8823529411764706

4898167,5,B005W2BWLC,"Part 3 starts with a blast as Elfman recovers from an 'eternal memory' spell that Sol of the Earth has casted on him. Quickly shifting from a disabled mental state to an overpowering monster, Elfman has no problem destroying Sol in seconds. More fights rage on other parts of the Phantom Lord giant though. On the roof, Gray takes on Juvia Locksar- the 2nd most powerful S class mage in Phantom Lord. Ice takes on water in a duel that will FOREVER haunt Gray in later episodes (lol you'll understand after you watch it.)
Meanwhile, in the center of the giant, Natsu takes on the Top Phantom Lord wizard: Aria. Unfortunately for Natsu, fire is at a MAJOR disadvantage whe fighting wind wizard. Unable to even land a SINGLE hit on Aria, Natsu is almost killed by the same spell that paralyzed Master Makarov. In a stroke of good fortune, Natsu is saved in the nick of time by Erza, who has recovered from her earlier Jupiter blast hit only enough to finish Aria off, then collapsed.

Now with only two opponents remaining, Fairy Tail mobolizes its remaining unbroken wizards: Natsu bursts up to the top floor to take on Gajeel Redfox- his Iron Dragon Slayer counterpart. Natsu arrives just in time to save Lucy, who has been recaptured by Gajeel, and was about to be killed. A gigantic brawl ensumes the top levels of the Phantom Lord guild hall.

Meanwhile, in the center of the giant, Erza, Gray, and Elfman take on the Phantom Lord guild master: Jose
Her two peers knocked out of the fight before it even starts, Erza must call upon every last drop of her magic energy to even stay alive against a foe as powerful as Makarov. Unfortunately, commitment and energy only lasts so long, and she is almost killed by a life-sucking spell, just before a warm light, and a rather small, and iconic Fairy Tail member shows up to save her.

Watch the conclusion of the Dragon Slayer duel in episode 27- The Two Dragons (my favorite season 1 episode), destruction of BOTH side's guild halls, and a Guild Master vs Guild Master battle that shakes the oceans tides in the conclusion of the Phantom Lord arc in Fairy Tail Part 3!!

Action does not stop there though. Loki's past is revealed in a three episode long arc that will change later episodes henceforth, and change the way Lucy fights her battles too.

Lastly, another 8-episode long arc. Erza's past is enlightened to the audiance, when she is kidnapped at the famed Arkane resort, just east of Magnolia. With the strongest team bested by their enemies in their first encounter, they must pull themselves together in order to save their friend from a new blue-haired enemy that will haunt them the rest of their lives.",1406160000,,2665,4.6257928118393234
