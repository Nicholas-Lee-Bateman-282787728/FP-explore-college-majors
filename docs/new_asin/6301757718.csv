7815044,5,6301757718,"Nathaniel Moreau holds the entire story together with his brilliant performance. I first saw this on TV in 1993; I'm very glad I taped it. I still have and watch it today. Nathaniel's obviously one of those kids with acting in his blood. And this is no solo effort. Merideth, David and Victoria hold the movie together with him; they bring their characters to life magically just like he does. Watch this film and I promise you'll want to watch it over and over again. Nathaniel and the gang are here to entertain you!",1370736000,2,518,4.5212765957446805

In general, most people probably hasn't heard of the movie.  When I first saw this movie on television ten years ago, I couldn't stop watching until the movie was off.  In consequence, I bought the movie.  Now, I have to say that this is one of the best made-for-tv thrillers I have ever seen.  I would recommend this movie to anyone whose searching for a thrilling epic.
The movie starts out nice with Tommy(Billy), Florence, and Charles as one big happy family.  Then, Tommy starts snooping around and questions whether or not Florence and Charles are his real parents.  Continuously, Tommy has dreams of a playground (known as the kissing place). He pictures himself going down a slide.  The more dreams he has, the more the truth reveals.
At last, when Tommy figures out once and for all that they are not his real parents, he takes a stand for running away and finding the kissing place.  That did not stop Florence from trying to stop Tommy.
In the end, everyone mangles together to set the truth across.  If anyone out there gets the chance to watch this movie, I hope whoever finds it exciting as much as I did!",977875200,25,1244,4.691244239631336
