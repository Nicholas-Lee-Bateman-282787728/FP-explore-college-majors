8646817,5,B00IZGPED4,"Hard to believe that anyone could have sympathy for two people who are having an extramarital affair......and like them....encourage them....and want to see more, but that's exactly what ""Same Time, Next Year"" does.

Written from the stage play, this film pairs two of the best actors of all time - Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn.  Alda turns George into a lovable, likable guy, and Ellen Burstyn is alternately ditzy and wise in turn.  The viewer can't help but root for the couple as time and the various effects of society change, enrich or torment their lives.

This is a wonderful movie that's still relevant after forty years, because Doris and Harry are so like all of us......and how life changes all of us by turn. ""Same Time, Next Year"" is a classic.",1477526400,,757,4.712121212121212
