475196,3,6302508908,"This was orginally meant to be Marvels Doctor Strange, but do to the limited budget, became Mordrid. It is still an enjoyable film for those of us that are fans of this type of genre.",1130284800,5,183,4.257142857142857
475197,4,6302508908,"I find it to be utterly disappointing that this movie never received as much recognition as I feel it deserved. If any movie from Full Moon Studios was ever able to propel it to the level of a major motion picture studio, this was it.

To begin, the main antagonist and protagonist are two of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. Jeffery Combs is brilliant, as has been recognized for years by many movie critics and sci-fi/horror fans. He uses every ounce of his star power in his role as the enigmatic Doctor Mordrid. He makes the character believable.

His opposite, Kabal, is played by the delightful Brian Thompson, who seems to be destined to forever play bit parts in sci-fi movies and TV shows. Fans will recognize him from The X-Files, and also from a cult classic (but unfortunately short-lived) series from 1992 called Kindred: The Embraced. (If you have the opportunity, watch it...you won't be disappointed.) In Doctor Mordrid, he plays a twisted counterpoint to Combs, but seems almost a sympathetic villain. His motivations appear to be confused, and one almost seems to feel sorry for him at points.

Doctor Mordrid has very credible special effects, a well-developed story line, believable and likable characters...what more could one ask for?

On the whole, I found this movie to be wildly entertaining, and isn't that the point? It has a great premise (based on Dr. Strange) but rather than folding the project when they lost the rights to use the Dr Strange name, they instead forged on and completed what I feel was a watershed film in the sci-fi genre. Compared to many of the multi-million dollar turds regularly forced down our throats by Hollywood (e.g. Battlefield Earth) this low-budget masterpiece uses on time-tested story-telling elements and wonderful character archetypes, portrayed with excellent acting, to show us once again how truly entertaining a science fiction movie can be.",1118102400,26,1918,5.022012578616352

475312,5,6302508908,"OK, I must admit that it's not a 5 star movie, but I give it that to counter some of the unjust 2 stars and such, as well as rating it for what it COULD have, SHOULD have been.  I mean, they had the actors, the FX, and the property ( such as these things were in the late '80s for low-budget flicks).  If Dr. Strange was truly one of the Bands' fav comic characters, then one would think they would have insured that their option for a movie about him wouldn't run out.  But, perhaps they just wanted to make sure that it would be ""just right"".  Well......

I see that the 14 year olds have gotten hold of this film and have written their reviews from a limited perspective.  They don't understand that, back in the day, movies about comic book characters just were approached seriously at all.  I don't excuse this;  I recall seeing that lame rendition of ""the Lone Ranger"" made back in the '70s and wondering why some director with creative backbone just didn't play it outside the box (probably because of some ignorant producer who was worried about taking anything that remotely smelled of risk with his investment).  But, that's the way it was, and if one compares this movie with some of the other low-budget superhero films of the time, it at least holds its own and, in many cases, exceeds them in atmosphere and approach.

Jeffrey Combs is Jeffrey Combs, and if he seems just a bit over-the-top hammy, that is why his fans love him.  After becoming a fan of his from ""Re-Animator"", I can watch him in just about anything (as long as it fits him, and this movie certainly does).  Though ever-so-slightly campy, ""Doctor Mordrid"" never descends into parody, but just hovers in that strata where it revels in its own B-movie-ness.  The stop-motion by David Allen in the climax is some of the best I've ever seen.  This film flowed nicely and I was enjoying it when, suddenly, it was over.

""Huh??"" I thought to myself, ""that's it??""  Yes, that is the problem with this movie.  Just as you're getting into the characters and the plot set up, waiting hopefully for the engaging story that appears to be budding, the climax arrives (and it's a good one) and it's over.  It's much too short and I simply don't understand why.  Full Moon had already lost the option for ""Dr. Strange"", so that time pressure no longer applied.  I believe the Bands own Full Moon and this movie was low budget, so I doubt some boss was rushing them.  I just don't understand it.  It was a fun little flick.....what there was of it.  Well, it will never be accused of having filler material to draw it out.",1460332800,,2587,4.46908315565032

475344,2,6302508908,"There is some redeeming social value in this film. The apartment in which Doctor Mordrid lives is a really good set - perfect for a sorcerer's pad. Edgar Allen, the raven, is a nice touch but I kept waiting for him to have some meaningful role in the goings on. He didn't. The chemistry between Mordrid and Sam is interesting enough and her trust in him is believable. The obstacles the police set up so that the world cannot be saved from the demon is predictable. Jeffrey Combs definitely needs acting lessons (he runs the emotional gamut from A to B) and the plot tries to take advantage of the viewer's knowledge of this genre by explaining the obvious and not explaining anything else. The Monitor (two eyes in space) is as lame as the name (who comes up with stuff and thinks it's a great idea? What were they smoking?) While this is supposed to be a derivative of Dr. Strange, I can say that the animated feature of Doctor Strange has a much more coherent story than this film. However, I liked the idea of Mordrid and Sam a ts a team and would like to see this done by someone who knows what they're doing. As for the remastered in blu-ray - seriously?

475346,5,6302508908,"has finished watching ""Doctor Mordrid - Master of the Unknown"" released by Full Moon Features.
""Uh-Oh."" was my first thought when a five-minute pitch to subscribe to Full Moon Features web-streaming service proceed the movie.  Don't get me wrong, I love schlocky movies, but I hate fast-talking sales pitches.  I had to fight my gut reaction to hit the eject button.  [Selma, Chris, Jeff, and Zack know I have absolutely no problem leaving fast taking salesmen in the dust - just call it an instinctive reaction.]
I'm glad I did.
""Doctor Mordid"" is in fact ""Doctor Strange"" in disguise and follows that time honored Hollywood tradition of if you can't get the film rights to make the movie based on the character you want to, make a movie instead of a similar character with a different name, somewhat the same abilities, and of course, a much different costume.
Yet despite being a rather obvious ""Doctor Strange"" clone; ""Doctor Mordrid"" is rather an absorbing schlock-fest movie, with lead actor Jeffrey Combs in the title role, doing a rather updated version of Adam West's serio-campy take on Bruce Wayne/Batman - hey, it works for this movie.
Doctor Mordrid is Earth's guardian who protects humanity from the forces of eternal darkness.  Unfortunately for the good doctor, his life-long enemy - Kabal - has escaped from the inter-dimensional fortress that Mordrid had imprisoned him in and is now out to destroy humanity and the planet as well for good measure.
Kabal has help from two evil and disposable humans who call him up and provide the necessary gateway for him to arrive in New York City at an abandoned church that has been turned into a satanic nightmare.
There are rather interesting tones of homoerotic campiness when Kabal's male minion - after Kabal has killed the female minion in a blood draining sexual ritual - tells Kabal that he doesn't have to cast a spell on him, he'll do anything Kabal wants him to.
Meanwhile, Mordrid travels to the inter-dimensional fortress and discovers Kabal has escaped. Mordrid has a human ally in the form of a rather lovely  NYPD consultant who specializes in cult activity and crimes.  She inadvertently gets Mordrid arrested and then helps him escape.
The final battle between Mordrid and Kabal takes place in the natural history museum and has shades of Ray Harryhausen thrown in when two prehistoric skeletons  are brought to life by Kabal and Mordrid.
Sadly, there was never a sequel to this movie.  I think it deserved one.  It's schlock theater at it's best.
Strongly Recommended!

475352,4,6302508908,"BOTTOM LINE: As unrefined as it was, I was still glad to get a chance to discover DR. MORDRID. Jeffrey Combs' fine performance and some fun magic stuff kept me entertained. The film is an interesting ""what if?"" look at what a Dr. Strange movie could have looked like on the big screen back in the day. It's an entertaining movie (despite the crass language and short runtime) even without the brand recognition. Too bad there were no further adventures for the Master of The Unknown. 4 STARS

THE STORY: A centuries-old battle between two otherworldly sorcerers is set for a final showdown here on our mortal plane. In the no spells-barred confrontation between Good and Evil... who will win?

BACKGROUND: This is a very thinly-veiled re-write of Marvel Comics' Dr. Strange. Back in the 90's, before Marvel was the powerhouse it is today, they were licensing out any characters they could in order to generate money. It may sound hard to believe, but Marvel was close to bankruptcy at that time. Full Moon & Charles Band purchased the rights to Marvel's Sorcerer Supreme and were all set to bring him to the big screen. Band & company wanted to make it as big and splashy as their limited funds would allow, but in the end Full Moon lost the rights to Strange shortly before they were able to begin filming. Not wanting to waste the considerable time & money invested in the movie's preparation, Band simply re-tooled the script (with a few needed changes to keep Marvel's lawyers off his back), and thus Dr. Strange morphed into DR. MORDRID: MASTER OF THE UNKNOWN.

THOUGHTS (contains spoilers): A young, refined-looking Jeffrey Combs gives another excellent performance, as the titular physician. (Not sure just exactly what field he holds a doctorate in, though.) Combs plays the part very straight and restrained, thus his Mordrid is a thoroughly believable character, despite all of the hocus-pocus. Regrettably however, pug-faced lunkhead Brian Thompson churns out yet another in his long career of scenery-chewing offerings as Kabal (the evil Yin to Mordrid's morally-just Yang); sneering at everyone and bellowing like a buffalo. The production design is pretty impressive for a Full Moon picture. Mordrid's ""sanctum sanctorum"" apartment looks especially cool; lots of busy detail & eye candy to take in. The stop-motion effects from vet animator David Allen are sweet. The museum backdrop at the film's climax allows him & his team to bring skeletons of a T-Rex and a Mastodon(?) to life in bony battle, (representing the magics of Kabal and Mordrid, respectively). The optical effects used for Mordrid's & Kabal's magical powers were nicely realized. The floating castle, apparently some sort of otherworldly magical prison for evildoers, was a cool concept. I also liked Mordrid's friend Gunner, the beefy, brutish castle guardian.

All told, I really only have two gripes with DR. MORDRID. First is how criminally short the film is; barely clocking in at 74 minutes even WITH the credits! The truncated running time hurts the development of the characters, and the big battle between Kabal & Mordrid feels rushed and ends much too soon, which I found very disappointing. I thought their confrontation was a sort of test with the two foes ""feeling each other out"" for strengths and weaknesses, in order to properly prepare for what I expected would be a much more fully-involved final showdown later. But nope... that's all folks. My other complaint is in regards to the poor decision on the part of the filmmakers to needlessly throw in several instances of rude, abrasive language. These just feel wildly inappropriate, added solely for the shock factor and to justify an R-rating, thus in keeping with the majority of Full Moon's other horror product. (There's also a totally unnecessary female full-frontal nude scene which should have been dropped.) If the swearing & nudity had been eliminated, DR. MORDRID would have been a fine family-friendly fantasy film. As it is, even mature comicbook fans may flinch at the crass F-bombs liberally sprinkled throughout the film's second half. Younger kids should definitely be kept away.

THE BLU-RAY: This Blu-ray release for DR. MORDRID looks good, though none of Full Moon/Empire Pictures' stuff was ever particularly clean or professional-looking even when first released. The transfer is fair but not as stunning as many, much older films that have been adapted for high-def. Video is clean, with no artifacting or pixelation that I could detect. Audio portion is strong, with a well-balanced soundmix. There are several bonus feature supplements that up the value of this release for fans and collectors.",1423267200,17,4668,5.072916666666667

475365,4,6302508908,"Marvel might be riding high now as a member of the Disney family, but twenty years ago it was literally taking any deal it could get from Tinseltown to make some money off the different properties they owned. Low-budget versions of Captain America, Fantastic Four, and The Punisher are perfect examples of where the comic book publishing giant was heading at the time. Even George Lucass bigger attempt at bringing Howard the Duck to life was a miserable failure.

With all the hype surrounding the upcoming release of Scott Derricksons Doctor Strange, it only made sense that Full Moon Features would take advantage of all the chatter and excitement by releasing its own version of the tale on Blu-ray. For those who might not know, Marvel gave rights to Full Moon Features in the early 1990s to adapt the mystical magicians adventures into a live-action movie. When time ran out and the property went back to Marvel, Charles Band decided to move forward with his rendering altered enough to keep from crossing any lines of copyright infringement.

Doctor Mordrid (Jeffrey Combs) is a powerful sorcerer who has sworn to keep Earth safe from the powers of darkness throughout the universe. His arch-enemy Kabal (Brian Thompson) arrives with plans to destroy the world. The two clash in an epic battle of good and evil that includes destructive mystical abilities and re-animated prehistoric creatures.

You can tell as soon as the opening credits roll on Doctor Mordrid: Master of the Unknown Directors / Producers Charles Band and his father Albert were quite passionate about bringing one of their favorite superheroes to life, even if he was under a new name with a re-tooled storyline and origin. Obviously, the movie was made on a budget that limited some of what could be done. It still looks great and the entire cast is fully invested in their individual roles.

The Blu-ray upgrade for Doctor Mordrid: Master of the Unknown provides a clean picture to enjoy all the practical effects and stop-motion work the Full Moon crew put into the production. Its a true pleasure to see actual physical sets and props onscreen versus CGI landscapes and the likes. The 5.1 surround sound transports Richard Bands musical score and all the blasts of magic to every corner of your home theater.

Special features for Doctor Mordrid: Master of the Unknown include audio commentary with Jeffrey Combs and Charles Band. An original Videozone featurette is found as well. William Shatner talks with Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, and Stuart Gordon for a rare round-table discussion. It also contains uncut behind-the-scenes footage from the Full Moon Vault.

Doctor Mordrid: Master of the Unknown is unrated but should hold an R for all intents and purposes. Theres only one scene of nudity, which was really unnecessary and couldve been cut or edited to open the picture up to even younger viewers. There was some violence and language as well, but nothing that wouldve caused it to be rated anything more than PG-13.

1992s Doctor Mordrid: Master of the Unknown still stands up well today even though elements of it might seem aged. Its a reminder of where comic book properties stood in the grand scheme of Hollywood at that time. Fans of Full Moon, Marvel, and comic books will deem it necessary to grab a copy of this to complete their collections of rare home entertainment.",1419638400,28,3373,4.938271604938271

And, like Campbell, he will always be known for certain characters he brought to life.  One of these for Combs is Doctor Mordrid, a sorcerer from another dimension who has vowed to protect Earth.  And regardless of whether you are a fan of magic or not, youll love seeing Combs don his blue wizards robes for battle.

I read somewhere Charles Band had the option back in 1992 to make a Doctor Strange movie, based on the Marvel comic character, but the option expired before production could begin.  As a result, Band rewrote the script, made many changes, and wound up making this film instead.  Im glad he did, too, because I think I enjoy this one much more than I would a Doctor Strange adaptation.

DOCTOR MORDRID is shot well and looks much like many of the Full Moon films from back in that day.  The sets and the production design are obviously lower budget, but they still look great.  I particularly like the floating castle where Kabal was imprisoned.  This looks wicked onscreen, and the set pieces that accompany it are nice as well.

The acting is pretty good, although Combs certainly steals the show.  I do have to give credit to Yvette Nipar, however, for she plays a great love interest for Combs character.  And, screen vet Brian Thompson gives his usual over-the-top performance as the psychotic Kabal.

The special effects in DOCTOR MORDRID are very good for this time period, with several magic-casting scenes that are impressive displays of technical wizardry.  Keep in mind, this film came out prior to CG, so the filmmakers had to use practical effects and camera tricks to achieve their goals.  As such, this is a great-looking piece of filmmaking.

My sole complaint about DOCTOR MORDRID is the ending.  I won't give away specifics, however I will say it is kinda abrupt.  Everything is wrapped up, however I would have liked to have seen a longer resolution.

But don't let that dissuade you from seeing this film.  DOCTOR MORDRID is a lot of fun, and fans of Full Moon will definitely want to snatch this up.  Ive never seen the DVD or VHS versions, however I can tell you the HD quality on the Blu-ray is superb.  The Blu-ray is also loaded with special features, like:

-Brand new audio commentary with star Jeffrey Combs and producer/director Charles Band
-Original VideoZone making-of featurette
-Rare William Shatner interview with Jeffrey Combs and Barbara Crampton
-Uncut behind-the-scenes footage from the Full Moon Vault

It was supposed to be Doctor Strange but for some reason that never worked out so it became Doctor Mordrid instead but that didn't really hurt the film very much. Sure, it's not a blockbuster but a cool way to waste 2 hours with some mindless fun. At this price you just can't go wrong.",1350950400,4,450,4.5
475391,3,6302508908,"DOCTOR MORDRID follows a powerful wizard who must face off against his arch nemesis, the evil Kabal, whose heart is set on the destruction of Earth! After losing the rights on a licensed film adaptation of Marvel Comic's Doctor Strange, Full Moon creator Charles Band made a few quick rewrites to bring this superhero picture to life. Although many of the special effects would be considered quite cheesy and hackneyed by today's standards, given the time and budget in which they were made, DOCTOR MORDRID proves to be a wildly ambitious attempt at creating an epic fantasy adventure filled with magic and monsters. Jeffrey Combs plays the title role of Anton Mordrid, but he sucks the fun out of the character with a spiritless performance. The X-Files' Brian Thompson, on the other hand, takes his character's hammy overacting to an outrageous level of supervillainy that is perfectly fitting for the production. The final confrontation between the two sorcerers features lightning bolts, lasers, and even a pair of re-animated dinosaur fossils that are brought to life using more of David Allen's incredible stop-motion effects. DOCTOR MORDRID may be Full Moon's most technically-accomplished film, and it is a surprising little gem that superhero fans are sure to enjoy!

475392,4,6302508908,"Come on, surely this deserves a DVD, whether on it's on own, or with a few of Jeffrey Combs' greatest hits [hint-hint]...? Why don't the production companies look to see what films people actually *want* to buy, instead of what they think people want to buy? If it's a 'cult' film, they can put a few together; most people tend to like the same type of films, the same actors; it's not brain surgery. We'd probably have a lot fewer bargain bins at Walmart if they did this!  I'd really like to get rid of my VHS copy of Doctor Mordrid, and move a little further into this modern world!

The story is fairly bland but holds up pretty well in spite of itself. The real treasure of this flick is Jeffrey Comb's performance. Combs has played some far out characters in his career and Mordrid, as funny as it may sound, is actually one of the more normal roles, he's delightful as the ""good guy"" magician and can also deliver the goods as an immortal. Even though the effects were slightly in the cheesy category you believe them and simply have a good time.
