8393231,5,B003AWEZ38,"This movie held me transfixed.  It followed several young people as they made their way through a business plan competition sponsored by The Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship.  Seeing the innovative ideas they'd come up with for their businesses and how professionally they were able to present them was an absolute inspiration.  The movie was well put-together and very compelling.

It was an eye-opening example of what kids from some pretty desperate backgrounds can accomplish if they're given the tools for their own success.  Please see this movie!",1278720000,6,558,5.367816091954023
