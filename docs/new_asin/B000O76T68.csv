8183507,3,B000O76T68,Very disappointed; Jerry Seinfeld who is my favorite comedian appeared last and very very briefly - like 2 minutes; felt very ripped off!,1419638400,,137,5.0
8183508,2,B000O76T68,"This is a nostalgic dvd that brings back memories of the comedy club boom of the 80's and early 90's. Unfortunately, the material isn't classic enough and is probably still fresh in the minds of die-hard stand-up comedy fans. Perhaps a newcomer to standup would be more impressed by it. Also, comedy was a bit too safe and dull during that time period, so the dvd might generate a few chuckles rather than heavy laughter. Seinfeld fans will feel deceived since he merely hosted the dvd, yet appears on the cover. Thankfully my copy came from a $2 bin. It was worth the price just to see Dave Attell with hair.",1336089600,2,609,4.495495495495495
8183509,5,B000O76T68,This was an old one for me.  I loved the comedy and of course Adam Sandler. Thanks.,1236384000,,83,3.8823529411764706

8183511,1,B000O76T68,"This is a ZERO star product. Going right to the trash, sorry. Seinfeld is on for a couple jokes and that's it, even though he's on the cover. Very misleading!",1199491200,5,158,4.3
8183512,1,B000O76T68,"I wouldn't buy this if you have access to Comedy Central and a VCR.  It's outmoded retread late 80's fare that wasn't even that funny back then anyway.  I deserve to lose my ten bucks cause I fell for the bait of Seinfeld, Attell, and Sandler.  Seinfeld's on for about 2 minutes, Attell does material you've heard from him before if you're remotely a fan of his, and Sandler, well, I guess he's ok.  A curious aside--why is every comic(like 10) Jewish?  I just finished watching it and its going into the trash just so I don't stumble upon it in my dvd collection years from now.",1193356800,6,579,4.373831775700935
