8418882,5,B0049A4ZG2,"Let's face it. The 20th century belonged to the US. And this colllection of GM sponsored shorts proves it. You'll want to junp in a time machine and set it for the 1950s when you see these. Imagine a mile long parade to celebrate to 50 millionth GM ar, in Flint Michigan no lees. Flint is the same town that would be featured in Michael Moore's Roger and Me showing the urban blight created by a dying AMerican Auto market. But not so in the fabulous 50s! Everything is bright and bouncy, fine and rosey! See happy workers go to GM plants and collect big paycheck all to feed the American dream. GM was on top of the world and it looked like there was no end in sight. Fear of shifting markets or foreign competition was not even thought of! Oh to go back to those simple times. These shorts are like a time capsule. Ther are even a couple of cute cartoons made by Chevy, one with Nicky Nome and one with a liveing drop of gasoline. All in all a baby boomers delight.",1288915200,8,967,4.204301075268817
