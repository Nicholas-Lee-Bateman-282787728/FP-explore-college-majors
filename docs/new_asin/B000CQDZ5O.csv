8100363,1,B000CQDZ5O,"Do NOT purchase this movie unless you happen to own a foreign DVD player!

Things were a lot simpler when we had VHS movies.  You popped the cassette into the player, and pushed play.  That was it!

Not so with DVDs!  For some strange reason, the manufacturers decided to make the lives of their customers as difficult as possible by putting ""Regions"" onto their DVDs.  Now, if you happen to purchase a movie off Amazon, you have to worry about it's REGION, which part of the world it was originally intended for!  In this case, I think it may be England.

I have repeatedly requested that Amazon put warnings in LARGE BOLD RED LETTERS warning people not to just ""One-Click"" on a movie you might be interested in (they made it far too easy to buy something without checking it out first) but so far, the warning is simply hidden in the fine print.  If I were running Amazon, I would not only put a large red warning sign on these foreign DVDs, but put them into a separate, foreign section entirely, like in the movie stores...that way, you KNOW for certain what you're considering buying before you actually ""click.""

This is one of the FEW gripes I have with my favorite store, Amazon.",1427760000,2,1187,4.5046728971962615
8100364,2,B000CQDZ5O,was searching for this title for years but got a completely different movie instead. Chose a different retailer or enjoy your random selection.,1374796800,2,143,5.260869565217392
8100365,5,B000CQDZ5O,"I didn't get this from Amazon, but from another source, oh well. I didn't read the story, but I love the movie, ever since I was a kid. But I had a rather used up copy of it on VHS for a while. When Anchor Bay brought it to DVD, I knew I had to have it, at any price. Let me just say, AB, you did a very nice job recolorizing it, the sound and music is still beautiful, but much clearer in this format, I would like very much to see it released again with more special features, but for now, the trailer is plenty. The other two reviewers on here have the right idea comparing this to Neverending Story-it certainly has that mood and feel. After several years of waiting for it to be affordable, my wish has finally been granted, it will be a frequent watch once again. Special mention of the cast must be made: Christian Bale does a very nice job, 20 some years before DK) Timothy Bottoms is very compassionate as the King, and Christopher Lee, as always, does one heck of a job as the arch villian-remember HammerFilms Dracula? Note: this review is primarily for those who've already seen it, so if you haven't or read the story, I do apolygize. Feedback welcome.",1284508800,4,1165,4.276018099547511
8100366,3,B000CQDZ5O,This title has the same barcode as the dvd My Date With Drew.  Double check with the seller before ordering.  Any seller that uploads by upc code will have the wrong dvd.,1243468800,4,170,4.28125
8100367,5,B000CQDZ5O,"This is an incredibly good film made without complex digital visual effects. Compare it to be an ""neverending story"". Look and you will not regret it.",1204070400,3,150,4.8076923076923075
