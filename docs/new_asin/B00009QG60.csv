7992691,1,B00009QG60,"This is the last time I will be seduced by the name of Andrzej Wajda. Lots of things don't make sense in this film, such as the constant images of horses running, and then Daniel Olbrychski runs with them. Why is the actor Olbrychski so upset by the death of the great actor Cybulski? The viewer can guess, but nothing is made clear. The director is fond of scenes where everything whirls around the screen in front of the person being shown, but he repeats this so many times that it is totally boring. I know a certain amount about Polish society, but I suspect that there are many references to Polish pop culture here that I don't get. Moviemakers may love Wajda, but I am through with him.",1387324800,,694,4.387596899224806
7992692,4,B00009QG60,"This is an extremely interesting film whose overall impact may be lost on those who are not familiar with the cult status of Polish actor Zbigniew Cybulski and the effect his death had on both his colleagues and the Polish public. Perhaps this can best be compared with the effect James Dean's death had, although Cybulski had a much larger filmography and was a much more established actor than Dean. The film has both real and surreal elements; as several of the individuals involved in the film point out in the accompanying interviews, Cybulski is the main character in the film, although he never appears. He is like a shadow hanging over the entire proceeding. Many of the cast and crew had worked with Cybulski and much of the dialogue and scenario is improvised, givng it a seemingly unstructured feel. There are some wonderful set pieces, especially an interview that, while it takes place on the set of an historical epic, is about some modern ideas for a film to honor the recently deeased actor. The contrast between the dialogue and the background action is wonderful. Some of the aspects of the film do not work - the music, reminiscnet of the music of many European films of the late 60s and early 70s, often seems very out of place. In the final analysis, this film is a must for Wajda fans; those who are not familiar with his work will still find this an interesting example of some of the more experimental films that were coming out of Eastern Europe, especially Polad and Czechoslovakia, at the end of the 1960s.",1355184000,2,1533,4.660516605166052
