4155389,5,B003MAY3JY,I love Amy Dixon! She has so much light! I own all of her dvds and when i am in LA I try and take her class. This dvd is no excepetion. It was fun and kicked my butt ( in a good way!!!) She is always very innovative and creative and challenges me in ways I need to be challenged. I notice a difference in my body and fitness already. Thank you Amy. Keep them coming!,1276819200,,366,3.7662337662337664
4155390,5,B003MAY3JY,This is a great Amy Dixon workout. I love using the step in workouts and she uses it effectively in this workout. The cardio segments are short but get your heart rate up so that the weight segements are more effective. I love Amy Dixon's personality. Even when I don't want to workout she always motivates me.,1327881600,,310,4.456140350877193
4155391,2,B003MAY3JY,"I love Amy Dixon's DVD's and her training style. However, this DVD fell flat for me. First of all, I didn't know I'd need a step bench (I just do the moves without it though), and I didn't feel the exercises were very inspired or fun. I didn't feel as sore afterward as I do with her other DVD's and for some reason I felt maybe the production of this one was rushed or not planned out as well as her others. I still use it, peppering it in with her other DVD's- mostly when I'm tired and don't want as strenuous of a workout- but it's not my favorite or one I'd reach for otherwise.",1318204800,5,583,4.0344827586206895
4155392,5,B003MAY3JY,"I really enjoyed this DVD when I used it today. It's definitly a workout that works best with a step bench. I knew it needed one when I out the DVD but I was too lazy to buy it and thought I'd try it without the bench. It works but it's a liitle awkward w/o it. I didn't do the sections that seemed to require more use of the step. I worked up a sweat nonetheless. But I do plan on getting a step!
Amy is a great instructor. Not annoying or overly peppy. I also like the fact that she does the workout as well and doesn't spend half the time demonstrating the workout with the two assistants.
UPDATE: 09/13/2011  Ok so I got a step and good grief this is a tough workout! I used only one rise on each side and man I couldn't even finish the disc. But it's all good, it's a challenge and my aim is to complete this workout!
UPDATE: 10/11/2011  Well I have done this workout about eight times and I still really enjoy it! I haven't graduated to using a riser but I'll get there. I'm still a little nervous after using risers the time and being so out of breath! Anyway I really enjoy this and the cooldown is great, love the music lol",1314230400,,1132,4.049107142857143
4155393,4,B003MAY3JY,"I ordered this because one reviewer claimed it was by far Amy Dixon's hardest workout.  This may have been true at the time ""Super Fit Bod!"" was published (2009), but as of now, I'd say it's nowhere near the level of difficulty of ""Breathless Body"" at level 3.  Still, it's pretty good--moderately strenuous for an intermediate/advanced exerciser.  I don't use heavy hand weights since I don't want to bulk up my arms, but using them might make it more challenging if you don't mind that.  Next time I will try strapping on a 20 lb waist weight for the no-impact sections to see if I can sustain a higher heart rate throughout.  Be aware that you need a step--preferably a long, rectangular one, for this workout.  Final judgement:  Not super-intense as I'd hoped, but I'm glad to have this in my collection!",1313107200,3,808,4.647887323943662
4155394,5,B003MAY3JY,"I would rate this intensity level at advanced. Depending upon how much energy you put into it. I love this workout. I sweat buckets. I also love using a step with weights. It is so much fun, time flys. Love the music beat and I love how Amy cues. I use this workout regularly.",1312329600,,276,4.12962962962963
4155395,5,B003MAY3JY,I have had the privilege to take her class personally this past weekend and strongly recommend her!!  Look forward to receiving this video.,1312243200,,139,5.043478260869565
4155396,5,B003MAY3JY,I received this DVD for my birthday.  I have never done step before. I am truly enjoying it.  I like Amy Dixon and her team. I definitely sweat during this workout and I feel very energized afterwards.  I have been doing it without a step and now I am puchasing one to intensify the routine. Amy is easy to follow and pleasant to listen to.,1303344000,,340,4.2
4155397,5,B003MAY3JY,"This DVD is KILLER!  I needed a new and more challenging DVD as the more fit you get, the harder it is to keep things new and challenging.  I purchased a step deck but had no DVD's to use it in a full routine.  This one delivers.  In fact, I still struggle to keep up, and I am fit.  Even the warm-up leaves you breathless.  Great workout, challenging in the cardio but the moves are not difficult really.  I like this, but a beginner may not, but she moves right into the moves with no learning curve at all.  I like it because I hate a DVD that has a learning curve and then there's no option to delete once you master it and you're stuck with a slow moving workout.  This DVD does not do this.  You will eventually master the moves and then keeping up with her will be challenging.  I loved it!",1302307200,,797,4.077419354838709
4155398,4,B003MAY3JY,Very good all around workout!  A little lengthy for me when you do the whole thing but a very good workout nonetheless!,1301616000,,119,4.409090909090909
4155399,5,B003MAY3JY,"This was one of the best DVD's I have purchased, Amy is fun, upbeat, not overly but very fun, fast moving, I was sore for days but not enough not to go back
and do it again.  Wonderful...",1300060800,,187,3.9210526315789473
4155400,5,B003MAY3JY,"I normally take classes at the gym and rarely do workout dvds anymore but I read the review in fitness magazine about this one and had to try it.  I got an excellent workout.  I loved that she is a 'real' person.  No fake tan, fake abs sprayed on...she's real.  I liked the high impact jumps and intervals.  All around, great workout!",1299888000,,334,4.32258064516129
4155401,5,B003MAY3JY,"THis video should really be a bigger hit.  It is really a fantastic video.  I bought this because it made it into Fitness magazines top videos of 2010.  That was the first time I had heard of Amy Dixon but she will definitely be on my radar after this. This is an interval style workout that is aimed at intermediate to advanced exercisers and there are some really challenging moves!  This workout only requires hand weights and a step.  There are some plyometric exercises and a decent amount of moves that are high impact.  If you have bad knees, you may want to be careful.

The workout starts with a basic warmup and then moves into the interval section.  They alternate weight work with cardio step work.  The step work is easy to follow (no learning curve and I am hopelessly uncoordinated when I work out at 5 am).  Each interval builds on itself, she starts basic and then adds to the moves.  The routine is fast paced and doesn't drag (actually this one flies by) and there are interesting moves that I haven't seen before.

Amy gives excellent cueing and has a very engaging and likable personality (she comes across as very sweet).  Her cueing is excellent.  The only flaw I found with this video was with the camera work (and this was only a minor issue).  There were a couple of spots where the camera angle was not optimal for seeing how the move was performed.

I would definitely recommend this video to anyone who wants a well made challenging workout.",1299110400,14,1470,4.532319391634981
4155402,1,B003MAY3JY,"I love Amy Dixon DVDs, but this one was very disappointing.  There was NO warning anywhere on the DVD that a step bench was required. I like working out at home but I do not want to purchase a step bench to have to do so.  I would recommend each and every one of Amy's DVDs... EXCEPT THIS ONE.",1294358400,10,293,3.9491525423728815
4155403,3,B003MAY3JY,Amy Dixon is one of the best DVD  instructors--unfortunately I didn't know this routine had so much jumping in it--the modifications always seem too low key for me but I can't do high impact--otherwise its a great workout.,1286928000,12,222,4.842105263157895
4155404,5,B003MAY3JY,This item came on time and in great working condition!  Will order from seller again. :),1286150400,,88,4.5
4155405,2,B003MAY3JY,Not very challenging.  Maybe for a true intermediate.,1281398400,,53,5.625
4155406,5,B003MAY3JY,I've tried several videos in the past and I'm sorry to say some even stay in the wrapping but I've tried Amy's before and had great success. She can really get you motivated and keeps you excited about your workout. I've found that her newer techniques have really made a difference in how my body looks. This is my #1 video!,1277683200,,325,4.344262295081967
4155407,5,B003MAY3JY,"Amy Dixon  is an inspiration for what she does.

She is an excellent teacher and amazing person.

She can bring your fitness to a whole new level.",1277683200,,146,4.333333333333333
4155408,5,B003MAY3JY,"It is not often that you purchase a dvd for personal use and you find yourself wanting nothing more than to turn it back on the very next day. Usually when i purchase home fitness DVD's i lose interest after a short time. But with Super fit Bod, you will NEVER be bored, quite the opposite, actually!

This dvd consistently delivers a fantastic work out and the modifications [that are so clearly demonstrated] will give you that extra goal and level to move on, and up to.

Amy manages to bring you a work out that is challenging, effective, motivational and FUN.

The best part, it works. My fitness levels have improved drastically, and I have Amy to thank.

Amy really is the the best -- i HIGHLY recommend this DVD!",1277164800,3,720,4.473282442748092
4155409,5,B003MAY3JY,"This is the greatest workout dvd yet.  Amy Dixon knows how to motivate you and make a workout fun.  She is super enthusiastic and is a great teacher.  Before you know it, you are smiling and strengthening every part of your (soon to be) superfit bod.  I don't use the step all the time (old knee injury) and get a fantastic workout with or without it.  I have really seen big changes working out to Amy Dixon's dvd's.  Do not wait another minute to get this one..",1277164800,2,463,4.264367816091954
4155410,5,B003MAY3JY,"There is nothing quite like the motivation that Amy Dixon displays in her DVD's. Her positive attitude and ongoing smile not only create you to feel guilty if you stop working out, but make it feel as though she is actually in the room with you. Her workout routines are not only fun, but really cause you to work up a good sweat and remind yourself of every muscle in your body. I would HIGHLY recommend any of Amy's DVD's. Well done, Mrs. Dixon! Continue to keep us motivated and off the couch! :)",1277164800,2,499,4.319148936170213
4155411,5,B003MAY3JY,"I've written in the past about some of the other Amy Dixon workout DVD's because, quite frankly, she's my absolute favorite instructor (I wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewer that said ""move over Jillian Michaels!""  Jillian Michaels doesn't hold a candle to Amy.)  Amy gets my booty into shape like no one else in the world.  But I have to say, this one is by far the most difficult she's ever created, and I LOVE IT!

Super Fit Bod is a total body shredder.  I've felt the typical Amy Dixon's next-morning-burn after her past DVD workouts, but boy oh boy, this one takes the cake.  Basically it's a bunch of cardio intervals mixed with strength training that keeps you moving the entire time.  You use hand weights and a step (although if you don't have a step, you're okay.  One of the girls in the background did a modification without one.)  I thought I was melting with all the sweat I lost.  But sweat = pounds!  And if I did this DVD only once a week, I'd probably drop a few more!

This one is a great addition to my Amy Dixon rotation for those days where I feel like I really need to kick my butt.  Congrats yet again, Amy!  Keep 'em coming!",1277078400,23,1159,4.355140186915888
4155412,5,B003MAY3JY,"I needed a good workout for travelling, and this one rocks. It's still great when I don't use /have the bench.",1277078400,3,110,4.285714285714286
4155413,5,B003MAY3JY,"This workout will get you super fit in no time, and it's fun!  I heart Amy.",1277078400,,75,3.6875
4155414,5,B003MAY3JY,"This is the most amazing fitness routine, especially if you are ready for a change and to take it up a notch!  Amy Dixon's workouts have transformed my body since I had my first baby over a year ago.  I started out doing her ab routines on my TV from ""on demand"" cable, and got hooked to her style and talent for pushing me to go further than I ever thought I could. For the first time I am seeing real change in my body and feel stronger than I ever have in my life, which for any of you new moms you know the need to keep up with our little ones.  The ""super fit bod"" workout definitely kicked my workouts into high gear and made it fun again.  I suggest investing a new ""step"" or find one on craigs list because it makes a huge impact on changing your body and is worth the investment to go along with this DVD...you''ll see the difference in your weight loss and increased strength, especially if your bored with just working out on your floor.  Amy is like having your own personal trainer in your living room, you'll surpass your own goals for yourself with this DVD!!",1277078400,2,1074,4.194174757281553
4155415,5,B003MAY3JY,"I was only running before I started with the Super Fit Bod workout and it has completely changed my body.  It really helped sculpt my arms, butt & legs.  I'm hooked!",1277078400,,165,4.290322580645161
4155416,5,B003MAY3JY,"I've bought many fitness DVD's over the years and have gotten bored very easily with each one.  I usually see the same exercises over and over again.  With Amy Dixon's Super Fit BOD DVD, I've found an amazing workout that keeps inspiring me to do it day after day.  Amy is so full of personality and absolutely amazing in this DVD. She is so inspiring and easy to follow. This DVD offers a challenging workout that really gets me  moving and sweating.  I look forward to my workouts with Amy. Anyone who's looking for a great, innovative and exciting workout should buy this DVD. Thanks Amy!",1276992000,,591,4.537735849056604
4155417,5,B003MAY3JY,"Amy Dixon's instruction is the like having your own personal trainer without the price tag.  She is hands down the most inspiring and motivating instructor I have encountered.  The Superfit Bod workout is amazingly efficient and her moves are creative and fresh.  There is never a boring moment.  This workout is challenging, yet it doesn't leave you overwhelmed.  The greatest thing is that she is there with you throughout.  Which means the only motivation you need is to press the play button and begin.  The results are clear... total body transformation. Thank you Amy Dixon!",1276819200,2,580,5.042105263157895
4155418,5,B003MAY3JY,"Amy Dixon is THE best at what she does; order this DVD and find out why. Her class (which she teaches at Equinox-Santa Monica, where the room is always packed, and for good reason) is dynamic, inspiring, no frills, heart-pounding cardio/strength action and it WILL change your body. Plus, she's a great personality -- more of a true coach than an instructor -- and she will push you harder than you think you can go, and amazingly, you will actually enjoy yourself. Plus, is there anything more inspiring in a workout DVD called ""Superfit Bod"" than to have an instructor who embodies what that means in every way? Healthy, dynamic, powerful, strong and beautiful. If you do this DVD, you will love the results!",1276819200,4,710,4.733870967741935
4155419,5,B003MAY3JY,"Amy Dixon is by far one of the most dynamic fitness instructor I have ever encountered. Her enthusiasm , knowledge and motivational skills are unparalleled. This DVD is a must have. You will get in shape and motivated without realizing how much effort you have expended. Your body is guaranteed to change. If you can't make it to the gym this will do the trick. I have gained  so much strength and muscle following Amy's direction. As Amy says... trust me.  You will be glad that you did.",1276819200,2,488,4.534090909090909
8400358,4,B003MAY3JY,I am a fan of Amy Dixon and have several of her DVDs. Super Fit Body is challenging especially if you are an intermediate or advanced.,1488672000,,134,4.1923076923076925
8400359,5,B003MAY3JY,Great workout!,1487548800,,14,6.5
8400360,5,B003MAY3JY,"I love working out, I love workout DVDs (I have at least a couple hundred) and I especially love athletic step routines.  I am not into ""dance-y"" step routines which confuse me, spend too much time off the step, waste my time, and don't typically give the hardcore workouts I love.  When I'm done working out I want to FEEL it.  This routine, though mostly step, uses hand weights and manages to work the whole body.  It also has a cool down and has a 10 minute bonus core routine.  For me, this is a great workout (I push myself, set my step height appropriately, and don't half-@ss it), and when I'm done, I'm thoroughly worked out.  Even though it's hard, and it's long, I don't find myself bored or thinking it is dragging on forever and checking my clock all the time.  I really like the instructor, she is completely non-annoying, and gives just the right amount of encouragement.  I have to save it for days off, because I don't have that much time on work days.  As of this writing, you can preview it on YouTube, which is what I did first.  I prefer to own the DVD rather than stream it at a lower quality or risk it being no longer available, so I bought it.",1475971200,,1168,4.292237442922374
8400361,3,B003MAY3JY,When I first used this DVD 2 years ago I rated at 5 stars but after doing it again this morning in its entirety(except for the Abs)I took it down a few stars. It was a fun workout but didn't feel challenged enough-felt there weren't enough reps for the weight training segments and it was tricky to switch from one excercise to another quickly because for the first move I may need a heavy weight and then missed a few reps while I switched to lighter weight for next excercise. Plus Amy looked out of shape in this workout which was a little less motivating. I guess over the years since doing this I have acquired a lot more DVDs that challenge me much more. I am 50 and find it harder to stay in shape the last year and need to do workouts that really shock my body in order to feel productive. I will save this for a day I have less energy.,1393200000,,844,4.121212121212121
8400362,5,B003MAY3JY,"I've done Amy Dixon's Breathless Body 2 and Give Me 10!, and this is another workout of hers that I'll be adding to my rotation. Some of her quirks from earlier workouts (""I trust..."", ""a-MAZ-ing"") have been toned down in this video, so she's actually very fun and motivating to listen to. As is, this workout is probably at a medium-to-high-intermediate level, but the moves can be easily modified up or down. The toning and cardio sections progress up from very basic movements to more intense versions of each exercise. So, to modify up, which I had to do for some segments, just don't follow her through the progressions and jump straight to the highest intensity level. (This requires that you've previewed the moves to know in advance what the hardest level is though.) Also, you can use heavier weights and lunge deeper in the toning sections; in the cardio sections, add jumps for an increased plyometric element, ankle weights, and go faster than Amy does.

I was a little disappointed that the abs bonus wasn't that difficult. I felt like she only did half the number of reps that would have been necessary for a full core workout. However, by this point, I was so tired from the main workout that I didn't care too much. I'm so used to Cathe's killer floor toning that I've just come to expect it from all videos!",1381968000,2,1324,4.634042553191489
8400363,5,B003MAY3JY,"Have done this workout twice and love it.  Amy is so positive and her exercise moves are not complicated at all.  I started this DVD the other day, not feeling up to exercising and after 10 minutes of watching Amy I was beginning to sweat and enjoying this workout.  Amy is becoming my favorite fitness instructor.  Give this DVD a try, you will be sweating at the end and feeling good about working out.",1366329600,,404,4.418918918918919
8400364,4,B003MAY3JY,I really enjoy Amy for several reasons including real body types in her videos and clearly communicated moves.

I will still keep it and use it does not putthe fear in me like her other video.lol!,1354147200,,325,4.620689655172414
8400365,5,B003MAY3JY,This dvd will make you work but don't give up because it will produce positive results! You will need a step bench and weights to get the most out of the work out.,1346630400,,163,3.9696969696969697
8400366,5,B003MAY3JY,"I have Breathless Body and Breathless Body 2, both of which, I love. I decided to try this after reading the reviews on Amazon and I am SO glad I did! You need a step bench (more effective) and dumbbells. I use this with a 6"" platform step up bench and 6 and 10 lb weights. I burned almost 500 (470 exactly) calories in 56 minutes, which is the entire length of the workout, including the cool down. The workout ends around 50 minutes (that is with the warm up) and 6 minutes to cool down! It is EXCELLENT!",1341792000,,506,4.121212121212121
8400367,5,B003MAY3JY,I really enjoyed this workout! You will need a step and hand held weights for the video though. Amy Dixon is a amazing instructor. I will be buying more of her DVDS. Her Breathless one is another great video too!,1338336000,,212,4.325
