But if u have never done yoga before this is not for u.
Intermediate is ok though.",1394755200,2,175,4.176470588235294
8371935,5,B002KFSTUQ,"I practiced power yoga regularly before pregnancy so I was bummed when I found out I could not continue past the first trimester.  I tried a bunch of different prenatal videos and hated them all.  They were way to easy and a waste of time for someone who had prior intermediate/advanced yoga experience.  This video was perfect!  You can tailor your workout to how you feel with the 3 different workouts, i.e. as I get bigger and get more winded, I can only finish the 30 minute workout some days and other days when I have more energy I can make it through the 45 minute workout.  And there are three actors-one for each trimester showing various modifications and levels of difficulty.

BUT, I agree with the other customers, this video is NOT for beginners or those new to yoga. But for a yoga lover like myself, it was a great purchase that I will continue to use even after pregnancy.",1325376000,2,889,4.490683229813665
