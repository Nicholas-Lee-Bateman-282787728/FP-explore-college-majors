4534922,5,B0053O8A50,"This was a fascinating episode.  There are tremendous tears in the fabric of time.  Events surrounding this are piling up where years collide into one another and so do the objects in those years.  People are also in great danger from this since one moment a train can be there and the next minute it can be gone. Ditto a tunnel under the water on a roadway which springs a leak because of the two times colliding.

And what is the source of all of this?  A terrific episode involving a husband and wife closeted in their house where she has been ill with early onset Alzheimer's since 2009. She was a theoretical physicist who was working with time when felled by the disease.  Her bright but not quite as brilliant husband has tried to keep the disease from advancing by playing with her research about time.

The special effects on this one are really something to see yet they do not overwhelm the human drama of this episode.  I'd say this is the best episode of the season so far.  And not only is Peter back, but he is on this case!",1321488000,5,1039,4.341968911917099

Very good high end TV and the DVDs are excellent, not sure but HD cameras are used.  Anna Torv, fantastic, great cast and crew, I believe from the mind of JJ Abrams, try it you might like it.",1321401600,,412,5.983050847457627
4534924,5,B0053O8A50,"This episode contains two main story arcs.  The first is the return of Peter, the son of the two Walters in the alternate universes.  Olivia and Walter have been getting intimations of him but they are still reluctant to fully accept someone they cannot remember.  The second arc, which picks up the threads of the danger this world faces, is the return of the shape shifters.  This one is seemingly an Oriental woman.  But that is merely her outward facade, which she can change in an instant to look like someone else.  She says she is ill, dying, and goes after a scientist and his family to force them to find a cure for her.",1320883200,,629,4.426086956521739
4534925,5,B0053O8A50,"At first I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me and so I replayed the scene until I was able to stop on the frame that showed Peter. And, then, of course, his father says that he is seeing ""this man"" in the mirror and again in the TV. Very interesting. And, our bald headed friends are involved again in cleaning up this mess that has gone amiss. This was very good.",1319241600,,371,4.095890410958904
4534926,5,B0053O8A50,"Since the Observers made Peter disappear, all the characters have turned into grim and humorless caricatures of their once vibrant characters, indicating that Peter had a huge effect on all of them by being in their lives.  I'm excited to see how they introduce him back, particularly to his badly addled father Walter who doesn't seem able to cope with even the smallest problems in this new universe.  And poor Olivia... she's wrapped tighter than a new mummy.",1318723200,11,462,4.910256410256411

4535083,4,B0053O8A50,"Love this show, but Season 4 has music overriding the dialog which is deafening.  Its a terrible pitch that actually hurt my ears.  It was very very distracting.  Season 4 sort of loses its way a bit, but its still really good.  I'd give it a five if it weren't for the loud music that interferes.",1509235200,,297,4.25

This show is a keeper for the very good acting and plotline if nothing else. The main actress Anna Torv could be better and she does improve a lot Season 3 onwards but if you're watching this, you are probably going to pay more attention to John Noble and Joshua Jackson (both different types of actors but both very good with nuance).

Seriously, watch this if you can. We don't get these kinds of shows as much as we should anymore.",1506470400,,584,4.261261261261262

This show has a group of actors who have to play various versions of themselves and they do it flawlessly. I know it's a tough thing to do because I've seen lesser actors try and fail. The science is integrated into the stories and the characters are some of the strongest I've ever seen on television and I've been watching since Outer Limits days!.

The actors certainly did the best they could with poor writing and spotty directing.

4536128,5,B0053O8A50,Have been enjoying re-watching the Fringe series. The acting and writing are great. JJ Abrams did a great job of creating a series that has both human interest and can grab you as a science fiction fan. Excellent series. I recommend it highly.,1469923200,,243,4.674418604651163
4536129,4,B0053O8A50,Not as good as the first two seasons but I still love the characters.,1469491200,,69,4.0
4536130,3,B0053O8A50,"Love this show, but the story took a dramatic detour in Season 4.  I get that they're trying to spice things up, but there are several points at which I felt like they ran out of time and just forced the story to progress instead of letting it happen more naturally (this gets even worse in Season 5).  It's not a bad season.  I watched the entire thing and mostly enjoyed it; however, it just didn't feel up to the quality of the previous three seasons.

<SPOILER ALERT>
For those interested, that dramatic turn I mention above is that Peter gets erased from the timeline, has to sort of fight/haunt his way back, and then deal with a completely altered set of character backgrounds.

And I just hate the typical Hollywood insistence on ruining any romantic relationships as soon as possible.  Yeah, they eventually get back together, but the relationship is not the main point of the show.  Just focus on the story.  Unless, of course, you don't feel you have a solid story and need to distract the viewers from that fact.

Lastly, I loved where Olivia's character was going.  But in seasons 4 and 5 they completely ""reset"" her into a person a lot less interesting.",1469491200,2,1167,4.5673076923076925

4537358,4,B0053O8A50,"The story lines are fantastic and the characters well carved out. However, as in the first three seasons, Anna Torv's portrayal of Olivia is hard to watch. I groan inwardly every time she enters a scene! Her low monotone voice fluctuates only in volume rather than pitch and intonation.  She delivers her lines in unnatural phrases and pauses. Her facial expressions and body language are so annoyingly fake and often don't match the emotions she is supposed to express in a given situation. I'm sorry to be so critical; I normally don't take the time to write stuff like this. The producers would do well to get her some acting lessons or, if she's already taking them, fire the coach!  All the other supporting actors bring such life and interest to the story that my husband and I continue to watch despite the shortcomings of the lead actor. The writers of this series are brilliant and most imaginative. The violence level and sexual content are at PG-13 level, which is a welcome relief to this conservative TV watcher.",1456617600,,1025,4.752808988764045

4537724,2,B0053O8A50,I loved the first season but it just got weirder and more confusing. I like the early episodes that were more stand alone but this season as well as most the later seasons depend heavily on the alternative universe story line and its a big confusing long plot line that you have to watch in order to understand. Definitely can't just watch one random episode and enjoy,1454284800,,368,4.507462686567164

4537778,5,B0053O8A50,Fringe is a science fiction lovers dream kind fo a xfiles meets quatum leap mix-- unique plots mixing comedy and horror and colorful characters with a history theaded into the story-- you need to start at the first season and follow through to get the whole experience but even alone an each episode is quality --each episode leaves you wanting more,1454198400,,349,4.737704918032787

4537857,5,B0053O8A50,season 4 of fringe brings all that has kept me watching the series from the start. The cast and the continuing plotline makes me more convinced that this series shows what a brilliant man A.A. Abrams is. Anna Torv is just the right  person to portray the woman she plays. Richard Long is great as the  scientist with a troubled past. The rest of the cast hold end uo real well. The sections as indicated with symbols add to the magic of this Sci-Fi series.

Excellent actors, phenomenal story lines, each episode is unique and stands on it's own.  I'm not typically pulled to this genre,  I'm so sad that I didn't catch it when it was on air.

My only complaint is that the plot can be pretty complex, switching back and forth between universes for example, so sometimes I lose track of what's going on.

4537943,5,B0053O8A50,"I loved this season. What killed it was when Fox put the show on Friday's. No matter how hard they marketed otherwise, Friday is the DEATH SLOT. As for this particular season, I thought it was great. I loved the reset to both universes. It allowed the writers to add a few cool new characters and storylines while fixing some old ones, like alt-Boyles being dead. I was kinda hoping that there would actually be a 3rd universe involved, when I first watched this years ago, but that's ok. I'm curious what the true 5th season would have been like if they weren't given 75% of a season to finish their story. This season is probably my 2nd favorite, behind the first.",1453507200,,666,4.467213114754099

4539088,4,B0053O8A50,"The Fringe team has saved two parallel universes from destruction but have paid a heavy price they are no longer even aware of. Peter Bishop, who as a young boy was saved from death, irrevocably altering the timeline, has been removed from existence. His Fringe team-mates have no memory of his existence and his removal has led to numerous changes, such as the continued existence of a very old enemy. But - somehow - Peter returns to find a world which he is no longer part of. Can he find a way ""home""?

Fringe's penultimate season starts off in a difficult place. The timeline of both universes has been reset and although things are broadly similar, a whole host of details have changed. These include Olivia and her sister being raised by Nina Sharp and Walter, never having been brought out of his shell by Peter, still being a crazy recluse. It is fascinating to map these changes, and the way the writers cleverly use them to resurrect previously-slain foes and revisit past plot points, but it does cause some problems with the viewer not being sure how much to invest in this new universe. Is Fringe going to hit the reset button at some point and revert things back to the way they used to be?

If you can get over that issue, there is much to enjoy with this season. The notion that parallel universes can exist but time can also be rewritten within those universes is one that hard SF has played around with a few times, but this is the first time that an SF TV series has treated the concept with some seriousness and not gotten bogged down in technobabble. The timeline reset also allows the writers to drop a few storylines they developed earlier on which clearly they didn't know how to follow up on (particularly Fauxlivia's pregnancy). However, a late-season development allows them to revisit some of these plot threads and give them a more elegant form of closure.

Once the season sorts itself out, there is much fun to be had from having our characters (in both universes) pitted against a returning old enemy (who later turns out to be a front for another returning antagonist) who is a step ahead of them at every turn. The season does a good job of balancing out its share of characters, with Peter dominating mid-season but Seth Gabel's Lincoln Lee rising to the fore later on. Lincoln has always been an interesting character, but his early placement this season as Peter's effective replacement feels a little off. That said, the writers use the oddness of his position to inform the storyline and eventually his character achieves a destiny that is fitting.

A key subplot through the season revolves around the ongoing mystery of the Observers. Some fans thought we wouldn't get much, or any, explanation for these mysterious beings and their objectives, so it's a huge shock when we do get a detailed explanation for their origins and their ultimate goals. These ramp up in the nineteenth episode, Letters of Transit, which fast-forwards to the year 2036 and a nightmarish, dystopian possible future that awaits our heroes. Given that Fringe was going to be cancelled after the fourth season (the ratings were utterly diabolical) and was saved almost solely by the goodwill of fans at the network, this was an incredibly bold decision that could have left the series on a massive downer. As it stands, Fringe was reprieved at the last minute and given a final season to wrap up its storylines.

Unfortunately, Season 4 does run out of steam a little before its end. There's some wheel-spinning episodes and even Fringe's generously elastic notions of plausibility take a serious beating with some plot developments. The actual season finale is also extremely weak, with some bitty plotting and Blair Brown being given some hideous exposition to relate to the other characters (the writers seemingly later apologised by giving her an incredibly poignant and well-played storyline in the final season).

The fourth season of Fringe (****) is probably the show's weakest, although it's still eminently watchable, highly entertaining and, as usual, excellently played by a tight, capable cast.",1440288000,,4122,4.848011363636363

4539503,5,B0053O8A50,"Unlike any other show on a major broadcast network that I can remember, Fringe was consistently willing to take big risks - in this case practically wiping out its entire previous continuity.  The only comparable thing that I can think of off the top of my head would be Alias (another JJ Abrams-created show) but that show descended into such an incomprehensible mess of interconnected and double-crossing alliances that it became unwatchable.

Unlike Alias, Fringe seemingly grew once freed from the need to slavishly devote itself to established mythology and plot arcs.  The characters had opportunities to justify their existence all over again within a different context, and upon second watching, I sort of forgot that I was annoyed with Joshua Jackson and actually grew to like his character.

What stitches the whole thing together however is still Walter, played brilliantly by John Noble.  At times tortured, and at other times childish or impish, Walter's growth and his need to reconnect with the son that he lost are heart-warming.  Forgetting the fact for a moment that this is a high-concept science fiction show, this just becomes good television with astonishing production values.  The special effects are first rate, the characters are almost something that you can relate to.  Anna Torv does the best she can with the material that she is given, but she doesn't have the opportunity to shine that she was given in the previous season (what with her slightly naughty incarnation of Nimoy's William Bell)",1438041600,,1523,5.112903225806452

4539622,5,B0053O8A50,"Writing is largely a process of developing story arcs, and a series that lasts five seasons will need a variety of them, both short and long.  There is of course the arc of the immediate story, contained within an episode.  But there are also individual character arcs, arcs developing the relationships between characters over time, the underlying theme of each season, and, spectacularly in the case of 'Fringe', the arc that unifies the entire run of the show.  Viewing a show like this on Amazon gives you a great opportunity to condense the experience - there are no commercials, for one thing, and unlike viewing the episodes on TV you don't have repeats and episodes run out of sequence.  You can steep yourself in the series and completely understand what's going on.  There isn't a better program to do this with than 'Fringe'.  It is dense with character interactions and interlacing plots, each episode's ending makes you want to rush right into the next one, and it has an amazing over-arching story arc that begins in the very first frames of the first episode and doesn't play out until the last few seconds of the finale.  I enjoyed sporadically watching the episodes on network TV a few years ago when it was running, but getting the chance to watch the episodes back-to-back over a couple of months was a marvelous experience!  I can't recommend it highly enough.  J.J. Abrams and the writers of this show deserve great praise and credit for creating a universe (several of them, actually) that works on so many levels.  Watch it.  You'll see.",1437177600,,1560,4.7835820895522385

4539951,5,B0053O8A50,"This series was one of the best and certainly piqued the interest of those folks (like me) who were (and are) X-Files fans. The writing, acting and complete production of this wonderful story of 3 people who are inexorably linked to the past, future and another dimension, made this series intriguing and memorable.

Season 4 has a number of twists to it, most especially the attempt by Peter to return to physical world, one which seems to have forgotten who he is, or more accurately, never knew him. Or... did they? His saving of both worlds and his strange disappearance at the end of Season 3 was a twist which seemed predictable to a degree. However, having to reboot with him lost and not in anyone's mind is a very strange way of handling the series. The Observer, September, was supposed to completely erase Peter from history now that he saved both dimensions. He balked and Walter saw Peter's face in the TV, as he saw him in the lab. So, where is Peter?

As with everything in this series, the science within the series is accurate and real to our non-fictionalized world to a very distinct point. Then, JJ Abrams takes off into the unknown and shows us a world or two on the fringe of our world. The ""monster of the week"" is quite entertaining and Abrams has twisted these stories within the lives of the characters so each episode needs to be viewed in series in order to understand the entire ""mytharc"".

Enjoy season 4 and a short season 5 which concludes the story.",1434672000,2,1482,4.543071161048689

4540464,5,B0053O8A50,"The beauty of this series and this season is that it addresses both the relationship of people to technology and the relations of people with each other.

There is a tendency in life to compartmentalize matters of technology from societal issues. The irony is that any useful technology is only so because it couples to some human endeavor or problem. This show lands squarely at that intersection.

The most powerful technologies shown often are only usable or are only at their most powerful in the context of certain very human circumstances. I find that not only refreshing in an SF series, but actually not dissimilar from technical situations I have observed professionally.",1431129600,,680,5.0625

The event culminating at the end of season three with Peter turns the Fringe universe on it's ear. Just when you think the writers have hit the limit, they find a way to supercharge the show all over again. Prepare for the jolt. All I can say is, by the time you finish episode nine, you will be saying, ""Say what?!""

P.S. -  An all time classic science fiction line takes a very ominous tone with a very chilling effect in this episode too.",1424649600,,582,4.281818181818182

4541557,5,B0053O8A50,"The first few episodes were utterly confusing until we realised that the events at the end of Season Three had logically (insofar causality weirdness can ever be logical) knocked-on into Season Four. There is still a fair bit of jumping about between universes but the entente-cordiale brings a new, cosier dimension to the relationship. Of course there has to be a baddie and the reincarnation of an adversary from an earlier season (Season Two I think) fills the void left by Walternate & the shape-shifters while the previously mostly-benign Observers take on a far more sinister edge.

The masterful writing and plot & character development continue to be the real stars with the mad-science gluing the narrative together. It is not possible to describe any of the plot without spoilers but suffice to say that a certain amount of concentration is required and even the few stand-alone episodes reveal a new intriguing twist so an unencumbered memory is essential. There is one episode towards the end of this season that seems to be totally unrelated to anything else but, surprise, surprise it does eventually make sense and sets the scene for Season Five (again, like Season Four, rumoured to be the last).

The cast continue to be superb but, again, John Noble shines brighter than the rest - he should definitely be in the running for an award of some sort. Fringe persists as one of the most original and downright strange series ever to grace our screens. Excellent, mind-bending stuff.",1421452800,,1497,4.960159362549801

4541588,4,B0053O8A50,"This series had the chance to be in my top three all time Sci-Fi series.  I absolutely loved it for the first three seasons.  I finally broke down and bought all five seasons and I have to admit that I am slightly disappointed.  I get the impression that the writers could never decide which story line to follow.  They would start in a direction and before it could be fully developed they would drop it.  That is really a shame because I feel that any of them could well have made this into the best Sci-Fi series of all time.  I liked each and every direction the series went and felt a little let down every time it was dropped.  Over all, I still liked this series a lot better than almost all others.  There are just too many things that I want to know how they would have been developed.  My favorite character?  Walter.  I want a character like this in some other series.

When you watch the series again for the second time without any interruptions you tend to appreciate the show even better. This season 4 does get complicated as Peter's actions of using the Wave Form Device to create a bridge between the two universes, characters move back and forth between universes but the storytelling continues and amazes me every-time I watch it.

Overall Season 4 also does not disappoint you deserving worthy five stars! review - Now onto final season 5 :)",1413676800,,657,4.814159292035399

The last time I saw anything similar (and completely different) was the original Dark Shadows. This is Science Fiction that forces you to think in order to keep everything straight. The characters are also well developed and defy stereotyping.  All in all, the best television show I have watched since... since...

4543008,5,B0053O8A50,"This season is the best since the first.  It is almost perfect.  The only bad thing is a few weak episodes, but 2 of them are the last ones.  Here's a review of the episodes, with synopsizes from the pamphlet included with the set.  I will try to keep them as spoiler-free as possible and just keep any spoilers restricted to the analysis.

66.  Neither Here Nor There:  In a world where no one remembers Peter Bishop a killer strikes, leaving a trail of translucent corpses.  The best start to a season since the pilot.  A

67.  One Night In October:  In the parallel universe, victims freeze to death from the inside out.  In our universe, Walter suffers hallucinations.  A

68.  Alone In the World:  Walter bonds with a boy tied to two freakish deaths - a boy who reminds him of his long-dead son, Peter.  A+

69.  Subject 9:  Walter and Olivia's encounter with a Cortexiphan subject leads them to someone they don't remember...but who remembers them.  A+

70.  Novation:  When the translucent shapeshifters return, Peter astonishes the Fringe team by deciphering the technology that drives them.  A

71.  And Those We've Left Behind:  Did Peter's reappearance disrupt the space-time continuum?  Boston-area ""time bubbles"" scramble events from 2011 with events from 2007.  A

72.  Wallflower:  In 1989, Massive Dynamic turned a desperately ill baby into a human chameleon who can survive only by stealing pigment from the flesh of others.  The monster of the week is interesting, but apart from that this is nothing special.  C

73.  Back To Where You've Never Been:  Now a stranger in our universe, Peter asks Olivia and Lincoln to help him return to his original home, the parallel universe.  A+

74.  Enemy Of My Enemy:  Peter recognizes the man who controls the shapeshifters.  Walternate convinces both teams to cooperate to stop him.  C+

75.  Forced Perspective:  Walter and Peter work together in the lab, Olivia IDs September, and a teenage girl draws pictures of deaths before they occur.  A+

76.  Making Angels:  A grumpy Walter works with two Astrids, two Olivias, and a self-appointed mercy killer who dispatches his victims with a bizarre weapon.  A really good spotlight for both Astrids.  Plus, it has Blu Mankuma (the voice of Tigatron from Beast Wars Transformers, Lord Mantle from War Planets/Shadow Raiders and Gigabyte from ReBoot) as Astrid's dad.  This is the best live-action production I've seen him in so far.  A+

77.  Welcome To Westfield:  At a diner near the scene of a plane crash, Walter orders a piece of rhubarb pie and is served the business end of a chef's knife.  I remember looking forward to this episode because I read a review of it in Entertainment Weekly.  It sounded interesting to me, and they gave it an A-.  We were wrong.  It was very interesting, and deserved an A+.

78.  A Better Human Being:  While the team investigates a murder visualized by a mental patient, Olivia begins to remember being the other Olivia - the one who loves Peter.  A

79.  The End Of All Things:  Hoping to activate Olivia's paranormal powers, a villain forces her to watch as he tortures Nina.  A-

80.  A Short Story About Love:  As Olivia, Peter and Walter come to terms with September's startling revelations, the team investigates a case involving desiccated corpses.  A+

81.  Nothing As It Seems:  The spiny monster on Flight 718 is back...or is it?  A 2009 case from Peter's timeline is eerily similar to a new case with connections to the villain.  A very interesting episode, with some extremely scary moments.  A+

82.  Everything In Its Right Place:  While tracking a shapeshifter in the parallel universe, Lincoln bonds with the self-confident man he could have been: his double, Captain Lincoln Lee.  Like Making Angels, this is an excellent spotlight for both versions of a character; in this case Lincoln.  A+

83.  The Consultant:  When a plane crash in the parallel universe kills three people in ours, Walter crosses the bridge and uncovers a shocking conspiracy.  A

84.  Letters Of Transit:  In the year 2036, Observers subjugate humans, Walter is encased in amber, and a nightclub owner named Rick sticks his neck out.  If you are reading this review before you've seen this season, or even the last disc it's not too late to give you some friendly advice: save this episode for last.  Trust me; it's a better ending to the season than the actual season finale, and it leads right into the next season.  A+

85.  Worlds Apart:  To stop the collapse of both universes, Walter & Walternate must make a fateful decision.  A+

86-87.  Brave New World:  The team confronts its real foe, who is using an unexpected energy source to create a new world.  A disappointing finale.  There are some pretty cool moments, but the heroes are holding idiot balls for most of the story and the revelation of who the real villain is one of the dumbest, most nonsensical twists I have ever seen.  C-

Like I said, this season is almost perfect.  But first things first SPOILERS!  The resetting of the timeline didn't bother me for the most part.  Alternate Broyles coming back from the dead is fine with me.  My mother complained about how the Fauxlivia replacement arc could have happened in the first place without Peter but since I absolutely hated the arc I don't care.  If the writers want to forget about it, that's wonderful.  David Robert Jones coming back, however, was a little annoying; but I can just pretend that it's an alternate version of him.  But my biggest complaint was in the finale, when William Bell was revealed to be the villain.  I'm sorry but, reset timeline or not, that makes no sense.  It seemed very disrespectful to do that to such a good character, especially since his initial exit was handled so well.  But like with Jones, I can pretend that in this reset timeline the alternate version of William Bell went into hiding, and came out when his doppelganger died.  But overall this was a very good season, the best apart from the first.  Half of the episodes were A+, only 5 were below A and Letters Of Transit left me really looking forward to the last season.  I've already seen the first 3 episodes of it, and it could be even better than the first.",1404259200,,6219,4.716963448922212

4543037,5,B0053O8A50,"I've watched this series twice now and am amazed at how it holds my interest and attention.  The characters especially Walter seemed strange at first, but soon became very lovable.  Walter is pretty typical of the high IQ Scientists that I've known -lol! who always seem to have ""food"" on the fringe of their mind.
My only criticism is that in the course of the ""cutting and pasting"" of the various intertwining pieces of the episodes, they leave the viewer feeling a bit crazyrealizing that a character who was definitely killed in a previous season, is suddenly alive and well in the current season.  This technique of mixing and matching different aspects of the story is a bit overdone in this series and I have found it to be confusing at times.  However, I think that this is also why I have so easily forgotten the storyline and can find it fresh and interesting when viewing the series again (it is hard to remember what to expect).",1403568000,,940,4.610778443113772

4543274,4,B0053O8A50,"After watching 3 seasons I was amazed that I had missed this show when it was on.  Doing some research I see why.  It had a small following when new and the writers killed the emotional vesting for the followers in season 4.  So many shows over history have shot themselves in the foot by messing up the sub-plot involving the unrealized love relationship between two characters.  Fringe did a great job of building Olivia and Peter's relationship to be an essential point to the whole season 3 finale by making it such that Peter can only access the machine if done with Olivia.  But then to have him simply disappear at a critical point, when the people from the parallel universe meet and never even resolve the fact that without him the foundation for working out a truce is eliminated and a reason for them building a bridge with it.  Worse is then returning to essentially season 1 having lost the relationship between Peter and Olivia only to go back into the single episode mode with the underlying story becoming meaningless and the desire for their relationship to be fulfilled again not addressed?  I guess the writers were dipping into Walters LSD.  That stripped my emotional vesting in the show as the story around the relationship simply has evaporated.  Peter should have been kept as he was the perfect ambassador between the two universes as he was from one but with emotional ties to the other and naturally served as the glue to hold together a reason to work together.  Instead we get to watch Olivia treat him like dirt and Walter act like a jackass towards a version of his lost son?  Terrible writing decisions.  Even so by the end of the season they had restored much of the emotional portion of the storyline although down a plot path that may have corrected many of these situations, never resolves the anomalies mentioned above and still leaves the first portion of the season largely a waste.  Introducing the bridge and allied sides was a positive that I hope is rectified in season 5.  It was a good portion of the storyline leveraging the possibilities with the other world counterparts.  Just as we are brought to a point of pulling for them alongside our own as we see the real enemies are not each other, they again eliminate what had been a large portion of the series by acting on a guess that closing the bridge would avert the plans to destroy the universes.  Hopefully the 5th season will reconcile it, but with it being the last season and a shortened one at that I suspect there was a reason it was the last and the bad choices in writing will simply diminish some of the enjoyment I got from a show with a lot of positives and even more promise.  I will only know when I've viewed season 5, but every time the show has brought an emotional smile it has quickly been followed by heightened frustration with the writing.  But it is just a show, and science fiction at that, so I don't know that any plot could satisfy all, although I do believe with different choices this show could have been more successful and on the air longer.",1397260800,,3073,4.5462794918330305
4543275,3,B0053O8A50,"If you watched season 3 (the best of the 5 seasons) you know that the show had a major event take place at the end of it which sets the table for season 4.  The storyline that Peter had never existed and that drags on for several episodes. The characters that remain are all reset to where they were in the 1st season, with Walter in particular being an absolute kook. As a fan I found the erasing of the previous 64 episodes to be rather offensive. Eventually these storylines are ""fixed,"" if not returned to normal. From what I've gleaned online this story arc pretty much destroyed the rating of the show and led to it's ultimate demise.
Eventually the show finds it's balance in the middle of the season and the run down the stretch gets really good again. The 2nd half of the season is definitely up to the lofty standards Fringe had set in it's 1st three seasons.

The actors really bring in a depth to their characters that is simply amazing plus the story continues to bring a freshness that leaves me compelled to continue watching. The 4th season of Fringe brings some new twists that move the story along rather well.

4543307,5,B0053O8A50,"Fringe is one of the best and most imaginative stories ever done for television. The acting is superb; especially John Noble's Oscar worthy performance as Walter Bishop and the alternate Walter Bishop. (Yes, I know TV gives out Emmy's) While the background story is kind of science fiction, it is primarily a story about people relationships (Walter & his son Peter, Peter & Olivia, Walter & Astrid) and how they grow and change over time, and how we, as humans, deal with regrets, guilt, love, forgiveness, and redemption. It's a story about ""hope,"" the resilience of love, and the importance of family. Yes, there is a lot of mystery surrounding the superficial action - who is causing all the ""fringe"" events, who is ""the Observer"" and what is his role in all this, and what happens when science steps over the line. But, by the time you finish watching the whole series, all the questions are answered. Fringe is really an outstanding show.",1396224000,,944,4.7975460122699385

All I can say is that they took this show, twisted it (with the AU (Alternate Universe) stuff, and weirded it out with this 'future' story arc. It's like every time the writers didn't like where their storline was taking them, they just flipped the past or jumped into the future to course correct it. It just jumps around too much and I'm finding it hard to finish out to the end. I will, but I don't like it nearly as much as when it started out.",1394668800,,525,4.207920792079208

4543429,5,B0053O8A50,"We Fringe fans are a bit nuts -- sort of like everyone's favorite Mad Scientist, Walter Bishop, and we're unapologetic about how much we love the show and its characters.  However, Season 4 initially took some getting used to, particularly in the wake of Season 3's outstanding run and its climactic ending, where (possible Spoilers!) Peter saves both universes, only to be -- ERASED?

When Season 4 first aired, fan feelings were decidedly mixed, particularly at the beginning when we introduced to the same characters (except Peter) but all living different lives because, in this new timeline, Peter died as a child in BOTH universes, not just ours.  This is soon revealed to be the handiwork of the Observers, those mysterious bald-headed guys in the black bowler hats (and always carrying a satchel -- what's up with that?) who apparently decided on their own that, to reset history to its ""proper version""...well you get the idea.

WARNING:  *** SPOILERS AHEAD! ***

And we didn't like it, because our beloved friends from Seasons 1 - 3 were so -- different!  Walter is a sad recluse, hanging onto his sanity by a thread (and sometimes losing his grip altogether); Olivia is back to the guarded, closed-up person she was through much of Season 1; Nina Sharp is now Olivia's ""foster Mom""; and our universe's Lincoln Lee (ably played by Seth Gabel) becomes Olivia's new partner and potential love interest!  And William Bell (Leonard Nimoy) is officially dead.  What's not to hate?

Turns out our patience was rewarded beyond our wildest dreams.  By the end of Season 4 we had been treated to a variety of excellent stories, and gotten to know our friends all over again, AND saved both universes one more time, although Walter had to kill Olivia to do it. (Sorry, you'll have to purchase the season to get the answers to that one.)  We were also treated to the return of David Robert Jones (from Season 1) as the main villain, and he delivered far beyond anyone's expectations.  And yes, those rumors of William Bell's untimely death?  Sorry, you'll have to find that one out for yourselves as well.

Whichever medium you choose to purchase (DVD/Blu-Ray/Online) you'll still want to see every episode, because even the ""weaker"" ones were critical to the characters becoming a family again -- and let's be honest:  the real secret of Fringe's ongoing success has been the family unit centered around Olivia, Peter and Walter, plus Astrid (and all the names Walter still calls her) and Agent Broyles.  But in this season, as opposed to how things went in Season 3, the alt-universe characters play key roles as well, even ""Walternate"" (the Walter Bishop from the other universe) and ""Fauxlivia"" (also played by Anna Torv) who gets to show us she's not all that different from our Olivia after all.  In fact, the best episodes are the ones where both Fringe teams are involved -- still leery of each other at first, but fighting together against the threats posed by Jones. And we can't fail to mention how much Lincoln Lee's expanded roles (in both universes) was a key element to this season's success.

(It's hard to pick favorites from this season, but the two episodes (#17 and #18) that I keep watching over and over again feature BOTH Lincoln Lee's in pivotal roles, as the full extent of David Robert Jones' plan is finally revealed and Walter visits the other universe for the first time (in this new timeline) since his initial incursion back in 1985, when his crossing over and back set all these events in motion. Also, episode #17's opening scene includes one of the most memorable ""bad employee getting fired by his angry boss"" scenes you'll ever see on television, and in #18 we get to see how Alt-Broyles makes another sacrifice, equally tragic but unexpected, to save his world.)

And yes, this season's Episode #19 (""Letters of Transit"") was in fact the ""pilot"" for the fifth and final season of the series, but that's another review for another time(line).

4543507,5,B0053O8A50,"My wife's reaction to Twizzlers on Valentine's Day may be an indication of just how much we like this show.

Though Fringe often suffers from some over-the-top unlikely ""sci-fi"" sequences, it almost doesn't matter. Like ABC's ""Lost"" series, Fringe has managed to hold our attention with some great characters that just make the storylines work. The series-long plot has held together so far. John Noble's role as Walter Bishop is nothing short of amazing without his quirky, almost child-like mad scientist persona, I'm not sure the show would quite hold together. The rest of the cast portray their more even-keeled roles exactly as they should, providing a anchor for Walter. The synergy is great. The more laid-back Astrid (at least, in this universe), played by Jasika Nicole, is a brilliantly understated addition. Episode 11 of this season, ""Making Angels"" was awesome.

We're on the last season, and are hoping, fingers crossed, that JJ Abrams doesn't leave us shaking out heads like he did with that unforgettably hokey ""Lost"" finale.",1392681600,,1042,5.159763313609467

The character development is exceptional and craftily woven into unfolding episodes.  Excellently casted, and surprise cameo performances. Lots of surprising twists and a fine balance of humor, empathy, drama and mystery.  The acting is superb. This is a show that you do need to start with Season One.

4543552,4,B0053O8A50,the bad thing about this season is you need to watch it in order or some of the episodes will not make sense. Starts where season 3 left off and ends pretty decent.,1390867200,,164,4.0

4543554,4,B0053O8A50,"If you liked the first three seasons, I think that you will enjoy season 4 just as much.  The writers aren't offering anything dramatically different from previous seasons, most shows center around a ""monster of the week"" with some minor advancement of the overall plot arc.

If you haven't seen the first three seasons, you should start with season 1.  Each episode starts with some flash backs to fill you in on what you missed but I think they would be pretty confusing without context from preceeding episodes.

I did ding the rating one star.  Some of the plot twists seem a little bit artificial (plot twist for the sake of being shocking as opposed to something that really makes sense).  It's like the writers wanted to squeeze one more season out of the show so they just threw a curveball out of nowhere.",1390867200,,814,4.618055555555555

What was most amazing to me about this series was the scriptwriting.  From the pilot to the final show the entire storyline hung together.  Until I saw the interview with Anna Torv and John Noble I had no idea the writers were making it up as they went along.  Unlike other series, like X-Files, where you never really understood the underlying point of the entire story, this show was clear, well-written and cohesive.",1390867200,,535,4.363636363636363
4543556,4,B0053O8A50,"The whole Fringe series is very well done. These are some very talented actors/actresses. The only reason for not giving it the full 5 stars is that (for those who don't miss a single episode) it's very tricky keeping track of who's in which reality and what's going on with each character. This isn't a series where one can jump in in the middle and make sense out of what's going on. Too, something subtle can happen to a character in one episode and it won't have an impact until many episodes later. In other words, to get the full enjoyment of this series you MUST watch from the beginning and don't take too long of a break between episodes.",1390867200,,647,4.4

I never tuned in when it was on the air and now I feel incredibly guilty.  This show is AMAZING.  One of the most creative endeavor's I've ever been fortunate enough to watch.

Story was brilliant, acting was superior, it had mystery, suspense, and a thrilling surprise in every episode.
The best thing about Amazon Prime, besides the shipping is the TV series, using Roku, without commercials.  I enjoy that feature as much as the content.  You can do the math, in a normal TV hour, you watch on Amazon Prime in 40 minutes  Awsome

I will not give the story line away or pick a personal favorite. I am trying to get more viewers to try this show. It was never a ratings bonanza for the network  but they stayed by it for 5 seasons. If you are into quirky sci fi with a little horror thrown in I suggest you pick up fringe and get started with one of the most engrossing series I have ever seen.",1389744000,,589,3.9915254237288136

How many shows can kill the two main characters, bring them back and not have a convoluted plots involved that stretches the imagination.

My wife quit watching after the switching back and forth to the opposite universes, I guess she got confused. But the playing of one's self as two different personalities was really good by all actors especially the parts of Walter and Olivia.

Abrams and that ""Bad Robot"" crew. Anna Torv, Joshua Jackson, and Jasika Nicole are great; but the actor that makes the series a cut above most of the rest is John Noble. I didn't realize it until I looked it up, but Noble has been in a bunch of stuff I have watched and appreciated for decades, including a couple of ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies. But he reaches...reached his peak with Fringe. Great stories, great actors and one great series. Thanks for making it availabe and so convenient to watch Amazon.",1386374400,,661,4.296

This viewer would have liked to see this series move on....without any of the characters stressing because they don't know where they are...again!  But, the great acting does keep one coming back for more....it's just becoming less involving and more tiring to watch as a creative plot endeavor.....for me anyhow.

Amazon Prime's faultless interface for watching this in HD makes this commercial free streaming internet HD TV experience...wait for it....the Prime choice for my viewing pleasures.  Good stuff, Amazon!",1384387200,,627,5.303030303030303

4543738,5,B0053O8A50,"I know it's a very subjective thing, but Season 4 of Fringe was, by far, my favorite. Not to give away any spoilers, but the whole resetting-the-timeline idea was brilliant and allowed the writers (and actors) to explore the already well-established characters in stunningly new ways. The cast, by this point, was so totally in rapport with one another that it was obvious they were relishing every new twist and turn and finding new ways to illuminate facets of their roles that weren't even possible in previous seasons.
Seriously, how can you NOT love a show that's constantly, and very creatively, reinventing itself? So many episodes are simply breathtaking (and, of course, the traditional 19th episode mindbender, Letters of Transit, was a jaw-dropper), furthering both the self-contained, case-based procedural aspect as well as the big story arc. And, yes, Making Angels made me cry...",1384128000,,894,5.215277777777778

4543751,5,B0053O8A50,Very creative and original sci-fi series. With multi demensions and time travel mixed with strange technology the storyline is complex as it moves from episode to episode continuing a certain consistancy that is both interesting and enthralling. Due to the dual dimensions the actors are challenged to portray multiple roles that show good to great variety in their abilities and talent. Worth the watch from season to season.,1383782400,,426,5.279411764705882
4543752,4,B0053O8A50,The series starts to break apart here & the story arc goes from weird to unbelievable. Wracking my brain against every episode is not my form of entertainment.,1383696000,,159,4.714285714285714

4543792,5,B0053O8A50,"so happy to catch this on sale so i could get it in blu-ray, so sad that the series ended with season five...

i own seasons 1-3 on blu-ray also and love all the extra features, the clarity, and the durability, because i watch them frequently - sometimes for the episode content, sometimes for the guest stars, always for abrams' vision.

this season features fewer extras than the others and all are at the end of disc four. i'm guessing that this is what enabled them to get the entire season on four discs as it normally takes five - and that, of course, means lower cost of production while you're trying to film the *last* season in a that 'brave new world' of oppression and hardship. in any case, i believe this is my favorite season of the series and i'm so happy with the basic package that they don't need extras to sell me!

collecting season five soon!",1382313600,,864,4.3875

Unusual circumstance started me, but after one season I was hooked and the show reached its heights in seasons 2-4. There is much more intelligent, adult stuff going on beyond the obvious weirdness: humor in abundance, great attention to detail, excellent photography, editing, and music that is very intelligently chosen or written. The acting is first rate. There are a few major themes in the show and I will not ruin it for you by listing them. Discover them for yourself.",1382140800,,542,4.776595744680851

I like how they didn't get lazy with the writing. The characters did what they would do. Don't want to say too much for fear of dropping spoilers. Let's just say that Fringe doesn't just delve into the mystery of fringe science.

4543923,5,B0053O8A50,Love watching . . . I'm so happy I found Amazon Prime!  This is/was a great show.  I missed it the first time around and how with Amazon Prime I get to watch the whole thing.,1376352000,,174,3.8055555555555554

I have to admit I missed it when it was been aired, but that's where Amazon Prime comes in, that's all I've been watching on it for a while. I'm almost finished with the fourth season and with the fifth season not been ""free with prime"" I don't know if I'll be able to finish it.",1376352000,,346,4.088235294117647

4543931,4,B0053O8A50,"I am not as ""in love"" with the way the series is winding up.  I much prefer the more paranormal adventures in the first season, and much less enthralled with the alternate universe story line - Walternate, and Fauxlivia, etc.  Having said that, Anna Torv is just incredible. I enjoy watching her delineate the differences between Fauxlivia's more open and relaxed style and Olivia's more uptight, controlled personna.  I think that she is a wonderful actress, and hope to see her again soon in something new.  I didn't particularly like episode 19 (I think it was) in which the Fringe team went into the future encased in Amber.  I know that this is leading us into season five  - but I am not a fan of that story line.",1376092800,,719,4.534883720930233

4543935,5,B0053O8A50,such a well done series ! JJ Abrams is a great story teller. Cast is great. 2 universe episodes are a tour de-force of great acting. each actor playing the 2 sides of the same person. awesome fun.,1376006400,,196,4.184210526315789
4543936,5,B0053O8A50,"Was so tired of cop shows and CSI per city that Fringe was a breathe of fresh air.it was an awesome show. I never watched it when it originally aired but was addicted to it from the very first episode on Amazon. I was so upset when I found out it was ending that I watched Season 5 as slowly as possible to Make it last. Not one boring story and superb acting across the  board. They made me laugh, get angry, n sympathize with each one. I put it up there with LOST for story line creativity. There is nothing on TV these days that compares to it.",1376006400,,547,4.018348623853211

They are the reason  I was drawn into the tangled web we've come to know as  ""Fringe "". They finally start to reveal their reasons for this massive mess they've created! But, this being television, the truth is slowly revealed. My only problem is that by seasons end we are just as in the dark as the cast themselves! It is (was ? ) still a very interesting program. I'm being vague to avoid spoiling anything. I will say this season is stronger than the previous one. Things are moving quickly, answers are there, pay close attention ,and you might solve the mystery before the finale!",1375747200,,676,4.2734375

4543951,5,B0053O8A50,I have always thought of Fringe as a show for the thinker.  The fourth season is one of the best. Peter is lost...or is he...Walter is having visions.... Add this one to your collection,1375660800,,185,4.4411764705882355

4543953,5,B0053O8A50,I don't know how I missed this series but now that I've seen almost all of the first four seasons I'm sorry it's gone off. I'm trying to stretch the last two S4 episodes and S5 to make them last. It's a quirky show and if you were a fan of Eureka and Warehouse14 then this is another show for you.,1375574400,,297,3.8852459016393444
4543954,5,B0053O8A50,"Fringe is a great story now into its fourth season.  The Fringe team, FBI agents; a brilliant (wacky) medical doctor; his brilliant son (sort of); etc. is a great cast of characters that will keep you coming back for more.",1375401600,,222,4.55

4543958,3,B0053O8A50,"I am almost through the 4th
It took me several episodes to really get into it, but the first couple seasons are really good. The main characters are all great actors and you really get a lot of character development. The relationship between father and son (Walter and Peter) is especially good. The romance is rather dramatic at times but the problems they have aren't drawn out too terribly much. I don't like the fourth season as much as the others, the feel is really different and I don't really like how they re-wrote time. The other seasons have more of the good episodes. I would recommend watching the first 3 seasons. I still watch the 4th season but not as frequently as I did the others.",1375142400,,699,4.511811023622047

It is the only show that has truly amazed me by its resourcefulness, character studies, and scenery.  These have to be the luckiest actors ever because they get to play so many versions of themselves and do it so well that I recognize each version, and they even get to be killed but have another version of themselves so they aren't out of the series and a job.

Okay now ****spoiler alerts!!!****

I feel Fringe made several erros in this season. I think Fringe wanted to focus SO MUCH on Peter and Olivia, and their romantic relationship; that they couldn't see beyond it. They couldn't develop the story line, or create a ""wow"" factor in a postive, progressive way. Instead they changed the story and really scrapped all of the story development for all of the characters throughout the four seasons...except for Olivia and Peter. There are those of us who like Walter, and enjoyed his character progression! I was pretty dissapointed with this season.",1374192000,,699,5.12280701754386

4544029,5,B0053O8A50,One of the top ten science fiction television series. There are very few science fiction television series that are any good due to T.V. producers dumbing down the scripts to appeal to a wider advertising audience. This series is not one of them.

But the concept of ""traces of life"" in us linger on with us even though we don't remember them or have ""experience them"", yet somehow we perceive them in some way. The concept that we are a life force that inhibits a body is new or at least a good concept it gives. Also, that there are separate universes and we are intermixed with in some way is good. A version of us in another universe similar to ours is also good. It does make me think and wonder what is not known and what could be or should be known. Lots of mystery. I am really enjoying this.",1372204800,,583,4.0344827586206895

After 4 seasons, the writers have done a good job of keeping the story moving but occasionally seem to have a show very very similar to a previous one.  Some changes make it unique but occasionally makes me think i'm re-watching a show until I realize there are some differences.

Time line of the story is good and stays amazinly consistant  considering how many years this show is running.

I guess this show was dropped by the network after season 5.  Figures.  They do not realize that good shows sometimes are impossible for a viewer to find or watch.  Especially if there is life outside of tv.",1371945600,,742,4.397058823529412

I watched it a couple of times a few years ago and just couldn't get into it, mainly I guess because I'd never seen the first few episodes of the series. Then I started watching it on Amazon and was hooked right after the first episode. In a way I'm glad I didn't watch it on TV because I'm not sure I could have stood waiting a week to see the next episode. LOL This is one of JJ Abrams best yet and I'm sad that it is now over.

Did anyone else think it hilarious that humans were supposed to evolve into a monochrome society where everybody dresses exactly the same like men in black with hats? Did you ever see a female Observer?

4544186,5,B0053O8A50,"Along with Firefly, Stargate SG-1, Torchwood and Farscape, Fringe is a sci-fi classic. It is grounded in science with plenty of strange phenomena. It has that great combination of action and comedy, but what makes Fringe better than the rest is the chemistry of the actors/characters and the quality of the scripts. The only negative is that they never should have cancelled it.",1369267200,,378,5.015873015873016
4544187,4,B0053O8A50,It is great to see an Australian actor in the lead here. I enjoyed the quirky nature of the plots and the eccentric characters. The show has good effects too.,1369180800,,158,4.3

4544200,5,B0053O8A50,This show never disappoints.  John Noble (Walter) is fabulous!  The ensemble works well together and the writers have continually come up with interesting storylines.  I highly recommend it.  But watch it from the beginning.  Everything builds as you go through the seasons.,1368921600,,274,5.428571428571429
4544201,5,B0053O8A50,"I don't know why but the Fringe seasons just seem to get better and better until the 4th season arrives with a twist. I've now watched this season twice, and now that I own all of the seasons I get to watch them over and over anytime. But I digress, the fact is my favorite part of season 4 is that it begins where season 3 ends, Peter (Joshua Jackson) is erased from time, and in season 4 it is basically a story about how in the midst of a world screwed up, Peter and Oliva (Anna Torv) find their way back to each other. This season is also one of my favorites because Walter (John Nobel) even though he has completely forgotten the past, somehow is able to move past his psychosis and think of Peter as his son again. The 4th season also, just like all the Fringe seasons, leads us into the next season, which we all know is the end of the mania of Walter Bishops world.",1368921600,,873,4.111111111111111

I love the fact that we see each of the character's personalities deepen, and are given more insight into even Agent Farnsworth this season. It is a little frustrating to wait to see if/when memories of Peter come back. But overall - still good fun.",1368921600,,321,4.4576271186440675
4544204,5,B0053O8A50,"Wife likes the show because it is entertaining to her.  I find the sci-fi thriller predictable, problem presented, Olivia takes the challenge, Peter helps both she and Walter until he has his epiphany, the solution comes to him, and wa-la case solved.",1368921600,,251,4.976190476190476

4544207,5,B0053O8A50,"I loved this series. The concept of a parallel universe where there are exact duplicates of everyone is not a unique concept in literature, but the series' writers brought this brilliant series to life on the screen and made it believable.

Plot line is interesting, but there are plot points that require quite a bit of suspension of disbelief. That's okay; I love sci-fi and fantasy and this series is completely interest-grabbing. The actors do very well.",1368748800,,306,4.482142857142857

4544218,5,B0053O8A50,"This season 4 earns a good 4+, mainly due to remaining true to the original theme, and posessing above average continuity with Season 3. I also love that episodes are not exactly sequals, but come together within 2-3 shows creating heightened interest and provoking thought. Bravo!",1368748800,,281,5.130434782608695

4544236,4,B0053O8A50,It's a pretty good show and you grow to love the characters.  By the end of the first season I was glad I wasn't watching on network tv because I would have hated waiting months to see how that episode turned out.  The whole series starts out like an updated X-files and even the title sequence reminds me of that.  But the series soon leaves the footsteps of it's predessor.  By the time the show seems to go way out there you're already hooked on the characters but that said season 5 is nothing like season 1 but it really is engaging.,1368489600,,538,4.245098039215686

The writers here at Fringe, for the 4th season, have once again brought me into an interesting twist of events that allow me to grow in interest as the season evolves.  And, if you subscribe to the whole season at once, as I did, you can watch 2-3 episodes at a time, easily captivating oneself at the same level and intensity as a top billing movie....Enjoy the ride.....",1368057600,,521,4.473684210526316

When I was young I used to wish to be rich ,have big muscles and other stuff . Now I just wish I wasn't so dumb . It must be nice to be smart . Then I could really enjoy this show . As is though I am able to follow what is going on 80% of the time . Then my wife explains the other 20% . With her help Fringe has become one of my favorite programs . If I have a day where things are going bad I just imagine that can travel to an alternative universe where the problems haven't happened ! I calm down and life is good . Treat yourself to Fringe !",1367280000,,668,3.5821917808219177

This show still has original Science Fiction ideas, a deeply engrossing plot, twists at every turn, and a character base that is officially epic! I cannot wait for the fifth season, I only wish it were not the last, me, my wife, my 9 year old son and my 6 year old daughter will truly miss this amazing show.",1367280000,,448,4.068181818181818

4544359,5,B0053O8A50,This is an excellent show that mixes sci-fi with human interest.  I especially like that there is a resolution at the end of each show although the main story continues from show to show.  It is far better than Lost.,1366761600,,216,4.375
4544370,4,B0053O8A50,"Fringe along with Grimm are two television series I can watch with my three girls and not worry about obscene language or overtly over the top sexual situations.  I have no problem with the minor violence and very few shows are available that are both appropriate for young kids AND interesting enough to hold attention of both the parents and the kids.

Season Four was heavily weighted toward the Universe duality so probably most interesting for close followers of the show as opposed to seasons 1 and 2 where each episode was a bit more self contained.",1366761600,,556,4.721649484536083

If you're taken aback by the changes, stick with it and let it sink in for a few episodes. Trust me, it's worth it. I can see why this show fell out of favor with the mainstream audience. It's a little too weird and a little too unapologetic about it. But those things are exactly why it's worth your time. Definitely check it out!",1366329600,,439,4.301204819277109

It really has it all - an alternate universe with dopplegangers, time travel, advanced humans from the future, shape-shifters, telekinesis, you name it. The brilliant and nutty Dr. Bishop is always intriguing and good for a laugh.

And all this wrapped around a love story with Peter Bishop and the beautiful Agent Dunham (Anna Torv). Nothing in time or space can keep this pair apart.

This is JJ Abrams at his best.

4544464,4,B0053O8A50,The first three seasons were something marvelous. While entering the fourth season the show takes a wild turn and almost forces you to learn a new storyline in an attempt to make a big change.,1365465600,,192,4.514285714285714
4544465,5,B0053O8A50,"If you made it this far, then you know what's going on. A lot of even stranger action this season. Amazon streaming quality is good, but occasionally there have been issues with getting the stream going in general. I have multiple connections (50/5 and 14/14) from two difference ISPs and can switch via software, so when it doesn't work I can jump to the other link -- usually it doesn't help, just come back in 15 mins and it will be fine.",1365465600,,441,4.390243902439025

4544468,4,B0053O8A50,Who thinks up this stuff? I find this season to be interesting enough to be entertaining but not heady enough to require much brain power.,1365465600,,138,4.56
4544469,5,B0053O8A50,"I was glad to find this on Amazon because I lost track of the series on TV. Make sure you watch them in order or lost you will be. The characters continue to grow and the twists and turns require a GPS, lol",1365465600,,206,3.813953488372093
4544470,5,B0053O8A50,Awesome show!! Amazing imagination from all the writers!! Can't stop watching!! Like the fact that Amazon makes it easy for those that has a prime membership to watch for free!! Woohoo to that!!,1365465600,,194,4.909090909090909
4544471,5,B0053O8A50,"Jumps around a bit but compared to most SF series Fringe really made you use your mind and sense of imagination a bit. Changing timelines, characters and universes keep your interest.",1365465600,,183,4.935483870967742
4544472,5,B0053O8A50,This series is awesome & always evolving! Joshua Jackson is delightful! I am addicted & can't wait to see what happens in Season 5!,1365292800,,131,4.5
4544473,5,B0053O8A50,"Great scifi show if you are into science, mysteries, and a fan of JJ Abrams. You may still see typical propaganda from time to time but it isn't too unbearable. This is  surprisingly one of the best scifi shows I have seen. It is witty, entertaining, full of obscure references to things like Back to the Future in the alternate universe starring Eric Stoltz instead of Michael J Fox. This show is a great ""whodunnit"" + sci fi entertainment.",1365292800,,441,4.582278481012659
4544474,5,B0053O8A50,"I've watched all five seasons of Fringe. If you like sci-fi, you're missing one of the best series if you miss Fringe. Great cast!",1365292800,,130,4.458333333333333

4544476,5,B0053O8A50,One of the best series on television. Week In and week out getting to follow the antics of the Fringe Division Team never grows old. Can't wait for another season of the best science fiction drama on television.,1365206400,,211,4.578947368421052
4544477,5,B0053O8A50,"The fourth season finds our team in a strange limbo, a land where they know they only have one more season to air and need to start wrapping it. The stand out episode is ""Letters of Transit"", the key episode to what season five holds.

I find it unimaginable that John Noble never won an Emmy for playing Walter Bishop, and this episode is one of the reasons why. He takes Walter from a simpleton missing part of his brain (after being trapped in amber for 20 years) to being a ruthless resistance fighter in the space of 45 minutes. Love ""These are not the droids you are looking for"".

This episode alone is worth the price of the set. Buy it, you won't be disappointed.",1365206400,,672,4.325396825396825

4544491,5,B0053O8A50,Exciting and complex with compelling characters. I think this is a good series to watch in batches rather than the stingy 1 episode/week regular TV provides..,1365033600,,158,5.115384615384615
4544492,5,B0053O8A50,I loved this serier.  Missed the very last show so this is a real treat will get to watch it after all.  Thanks.,1365033600,,112,3.8260869565217392
4544493,4,B0053O8A50,Fringe is Fringe...  if you have seen the first three seaons you HAVE to buy the fourth season and you are going to buy the fifth one!  right?,1365033600,,142,4.035714285714286
4544494,5,B0053O8A50,"I Love Fringe! Hate to see it end. We have completed the 5th Seasons .  If you like Si-Fi I would highly recommend Fringe. Oh by the way, Walter is something else.

4544495,5,B0053O8A50,I love Fringe. It seems to take a new twist or turn every episode. For any SciFi buffs....this is a must see series!,1365033600,,116,4.086956521739131
4544496,5,B0053O8A50,Love this show...it is so much fun and takes your mind off everything.  Fully recommend this show to all ages.,1365033600,,110,4.5
4544497,5,B0053O8A50,"Good show! Definitely worth watching so far, even though I wish they would have thrown in a Farscape crossover episode.",1365033600,,119,5.0
4544498,5,B0053O8A50,The fourth season continues providing fantastic entertainment due to unexpected plot turns and increased interactions with characters from the alternate universe.,1365033600,,162,6.761904761904762
4544499,5,B0053O8A50,Those of you into SiFi will find this series a truly wonderful work.  Prime allows you to follow the thread of the series from Episode 1 to the completion and they are writtent o mesh.  Wow!,1365033600,,190,4.25
4544510,4,B0053O8A50,"i guess this show had to be following an underlying plan from the beginning or ran out of weird cool stories. this season relied on the conviction of a parallel universe and a future version of mankind hell bent on looking back to our time. not saying that it is improbable, but i really like the first 3 seasons vehemently.",1365033600,,324,4.416666666666667

4544515,5,B0053O8A50,We love it. Especially when the screen writer include some 'real' facts into the story and explode it with creative plots. Can wait to finish the shows.,1364860800,,152,4.666666666666667

4544519,4,B0053O8A50,A lot of WTF moments. All I can say is the writers of this show have very active imagnations the plot twist are never anything that I expected.,1364688000,,143,4.142857142857143
4544530,5,B0053O8A50,Fringe is a great show. Sad that its over but maybe something good will replace it. Hopefully another J. J. Abrams production. I watch anything he's involved with.,1364688000,,163,4.857142857142857

4544532,5,B0053O8A50,"This is one of those series you have to start watching from the beginning.  Some shows you can catch one here & there, but with a show like this you'll be lost.  Starting from the 1st episode and watching them all in order, this is a terrific series and we went through them quickly and can't wait for season 5 to come out on DVD.",1364688000,,330,4.061538461538461
4544533,4,B0053O8A50,Thanks I. still on season 2 but my son is on season 4 waiting to buy season5 on may. but this series is one of my favorite,1364688000,,122,3.5555555555555554

4544535,5,B0053O8A50,"Wrapping up some issues created earlier, creating new ones to be sorted out and all of them simply beyond the pale. Fringe is nearly as convoluted as a strand of DNA and always leaves me wanting more.
Oh, and Walter! You did not do that!
Seriously, I did not see that coming.",1364601600,,275,4.3076923076923075
4544536,5,B0053O8A50,Fringe is by far the best series I ever whatched next to Lost! All seasons are great I'm sad season 5 was the last season.,1364601600,,122,3.92

4544538,5,B0053O8A50,"I love this show. This season leads into the forth in an unexpected twist. It's still all about Peter, whether he's around or not. Olivia is still running into ridiculous situations all by herself instead of ordering a squad of FBI to handle it...",1364515200,,247,4.636363636363637
4544539,5,B0053O8A50,I gave this a five star rating because the show did a great job keeping me guessing what was going on and what was going to happen next. I really loved that they didn't have to explain everything right away because you got the sense that they would address sensitive issues later on. I thought the best stuff is when they would show the characters' respective alter ego side by side in conversation (specifically John Noble's character) and how they really felt like two nearly completely different personalities. Joshua Jackson was great in this show (everyone was but he was surprising) and after watching this I couldn't help but noticed he bears a resemblance to Isaac Clarke (Dead Space). If they were to do a live action movie of Dead Space I think he should be at the top for Isaac Clarke.,1364515200,,796,4.612676056338028
4544550,5,B0053O8A50,I love this series!  Such great twists and turns in the fourth season.  I'm just about done with season 5 and it's gripping.  Wish there were more shows like this.,1364515200,,163,4.366666666666666
4544551,5,B0053O8A50,"Fringe is addicting to be sure. If you liked ""Heros"" you'll love Fringe. 5 seasons in total and 4 of them are free if you have Amazon Prime.",1364515200,,140,4.035714285714286
4544552,2,B0053O8A50,"This is one of the few shows we watch regularly via Prime Instant Video. Prime clearly has capacity issues, anytime we watch during prime time the show has frequent buffering and picture quality downgrades. At off peak time it works fine.",1364515200,,238,4.829268292682927

4544557,2,B0053O8A50,"The first season of Fringe was great but then it got really weird and confusing the 3rd. 4th has gotten boring like Lost!

4544559,4,B0053O8A50,"As a fan of Sci-fi, there's nothing about Fringe to NOT love. Unfortunately the series went a little off the rails & ended in the fifth season, seasons 1-4 however were great.",1364515200,,175,4.5

4544565,5,B0053O8A50,"While some of the episodes in season four seemed like the writers were reaching and going for more fiction than science-based fiction than in the previous seasons, this series still remains intriguing and compelling.  That's thanks in no little part to the acting and chemistry between the actors.",1364515200,,297,5.1875
4544566,4,B0053O8A50,Excellent season but still not as good as the first season. I loved the 2036 episode at end of season and was happy they continued with that story in season 5. Although I miss the original episodes that had a a new fringe case each time.,1364515200,,237,4.173913043478261
4544567,5,B0053O8A50,This is definitely one of the best storylines I've seen on TV in years.  The characters are well written and the mythology surrounding the show has me captivated.  Too bad I hooked into the series after it was yanked.,1364256000,,217,4.538461538461538

4544584,4,B0053O8A50,"From the first episode onward this series got me hooked. It has elements of the X-Files, Stargate, and Warehouse 13 all rolled into one. The characters are intriguing, and the plot lines can be fun. The only real negative is over time the story lines became quite predictable. For me this is a general failure of most programs. Once one got over repetition Fringe was still fun to watch. Would like to see a full length film come out to see what they could do with it.",1364169600,,468,4.390804597701149

4544605,5,B0053O8A50,"Fringe had it all, a deeply emotional study on multiple levels, a more cohesive storyline,  or ""mythology"" than the x-files, and writing which gave the actors challenges galore,  which they took and made us love them, and laugh and cry. John Nobel was sparkling and often so funny, Anna T. was quintessential, brave and tough but so very vulnerable in the prime universe, yet so very much more confident and happy in her alternate world,  Joshua was the glue that bound the characters  and storylines together with a calm, gentle, kind, tender,  yet  fierce performance. I could go on. There was nothing wrong with Fringe and the idiot suits underestimated just how invested the Fringe audience was in the show, there were more seasons that, in some alternate universe, are still going, just as Firefly, one season, rediculous.
Once in a while the dumbing down of American television pauses and shows like Fringe challenge its audience on innumerable levels. I deeply miss this show and wish more could be done with it still.",1364083200,,1025,4.895953757225434

The perfect mixture of X-Files and LOST, I confess I am only on season 4 (I got a late start watching it.) but enjoying it immensely.  Even as the drama and riddles continue to unfold and entice, the show is also tying in earlier episodes, completing satisfying season-long story arcs, and making the characters increasingly complex, charming, and unusual.  I like the depth and ambiguity of good vs evil.  I like the fact that I never know what will happen next.  I like knowing I can trust the writers.  I think they have a plan and are sticking to it.  I hate to say it, but where LOST failed, Fringe succeeds.",1364083200,,781,4.22972972972973

After the first season you get hooked. By the final, fifth season you'll start all over again because it is that good! And beware!! I guarantee you will not be able to watch only one episode at-a time! You'll find yourself watching four or five. Too bad they cancelled the show after season five.",1363824000,,439,4.641025641025641

4544650,5,B0053O8A50,A very addicting series. Kind of like a modern version of The X-Files but much better in my opinion. It will be hard to find something as good to watch now.,1363737600,,156,4.064516129032258
4544651,4,B0053O8A50,"Fringe began life looking for an identity that by seasons two and three it had found and established. By season four its time line jumping antics had created yet another reality for the characters to inhabit. Whilst John Noble's Walter Bishop continued to be the most watchable genre character in years, other characters suffered and indeed diminished within this season.

In particular, the character of Olivia became a shadow of her former self (which sadly continued into the awful season season five)

Although the producers had a massive paradigm shift in the aforementioned 5th season, its prequel - ""Letters of Transit"" in this season - was for me one of the most enjoyable. Its a pity that something that should/could have been a 4 or 6 episode arc was dragged out across 13 episodes - however, thats for another product's review. The ""futureverse"" episode in season 4 is highly entertaining.

I believe that Fringe should have ended with this or maybe even the previous season and been remembered as a brilliant and well thought out series. As it was there are episodes to enjoy but they are too few and far between to gain 5 stars.",1363737600,,1141,4.811224489795919

Anna Torv as Olivia Dunham was a real fine, she fits the role perfectly, I can't think of an actress who could do a better job at making you understand her feelings without uttering a single word. The way she was able to create two personalities (you have to watch the show to understand what I'm referring to) without losing the essence of who she really is was a pleasure to watch. I've always been a big fan of J.J. Abrams TV creations and this is one of my favorites.

4544738,4,B0053O8A50,"As with everything JJ Abrams-related, the Fringe starts out strong, gets you hooked, makes you think it's going to great places, and then just gets all jumbled up with aliens and other-world nonsense.

4544750,3,B0053O8A50,"Like JJ Abrams other creation, Lost, Fringe has in its fourth season become too wrapped up in its own mythology and is more confusing than it is entertaining.  Major plot lines have been abandoned with very scant reasoning and its hard to tell just which version of any character is the one on screen.  Were it not for John Noble's strong performance as Walter Bishop I probably would have given up on the show.  However, I'm in too deep to stop now and am eagerly awaiting season 5 on DVD.",1362614400,,490,4.4222222222222225

4544759,4,B0053O8A50,"It follows the lead of other series where after a while, everything is related to the same evil person, purpose, or conspiracy. The developing relationship be tween Peter and Olivia adds something positive, but Olivia becoming some kind of super hero seems like a cheap stunt in an otherwise thoughtful story.",1362441600,,309,5.078431372549019
4544770,5,B0053O8A50,This was the best sci-fi series on tv since the X-Files. The only draw back is you must watch from the beginning or you will be totally confused. Sad that its has ended but it would have gotten stale like the X-Files did.,1362441600,,221,4.162790697674419

4544841,4,B0053O8A50,"I was eventually won over. Walter was easy to like, the character was brilliant, wacky and funny, and so endearing. His was a deep and complex battle that John Noble portrayed beautifully.  Peter exudes the boy next door vibe, which I found unsuited in many ways to the supposed bad-boy con man genius the role seemed originally intended to be. He did eventually create a strong enough personality to win me over; through his love of Walter and Olivia, he came to life. Astrid of the many names, was charming from the get-go, and I only wished they gave her more of the interesting computer brain that her alternate universe persona had.  Olivia was the most difficult for me, perhaps because I had just watched the X-files, and I couldn't help craving a similar response to her that I had for Scully, which is totally unfair.  At first I felt Anna Torv wasn't strong enough to carry the role, but I was happily proved wrong as the series progressed.  LIncoln, Rita, Charlie, Phillip, all excellent, and woah what a happy surprise William Bell was.  I loved the Observers, they were both creepy and fascinating.  Fringe is engaging sci-fi, and I'm glad I stuck with it through the thick and thin, It's worth it.",1361923200,,1211,4.661971830985915

I don't want to give anything away, but season 4 starts off in a way that I found frustrating but then it got really good again. I highly recommend watching them all!! I was sad it ended.  I wish it would have been more than 5 season, there are so many shows not as interesting or good that have lasted 8 or more seasons, it is shame that fringe wasn't one of them.",1361836800,,502,4.01

Season 4 has taken the overarching narrative and ran with it, to a successful degree. The Observer plotline is interesting, and terrifying to boot.

4544960,5,B0053O8A50,The creators of Fringe have got to be some of the sharpest storytellers out there.

The plot of season 4 is a little tough to get into after 3 seasons of falling in love with the show and I found myself getting annoyed at Rebootlandia, but it worked and it was a great season.

Amazon Prime has been an excellent viewing medium for the most part. I have encountered a few problems, but they were mainly problems with my apartment complex's Internet access point, not a problem on Amazon's end.

In short, I highly recommend Fringe, but I suggest starting at the beginning. The whole experience now in the Fourth season is much richer because I understand how things ""should"" be, not how they ""are"" after season 3's big finale.",1360713600,,600,4.769230769230769

Since that morning late last December we have gone thought the entire first four seasons and are quickly catching up to production.  Like I said excellent series, and although each episode stands on its own (not a ""to be continued"" type) each builds on a previous one.  If you enjoy SiFi and twists and turns in your movies / TV viewing, this series is for you.  Word of warning, to truly follow along, I suggest you start from the pilot and move forward.",1360540800,,557,4.54

I think the character Walter probably wrote this entire series while he was tripping out on LSD.  If you love Sci-fi you will absolutely love Fringe.  You might even like if your not a Sci-fi fanatic.  Either way it only takes an hour to find out.,1360454400,,402,4.685714285714286

4545058,4,B0053O8A50,Loved the season right up until the last few episodes. At this point the series started rushing to get through to is ultimate end game. Quality was excellent and very pleased otherwise,1360454400,,184,4.78125

4545073,5,B0053O8A50,Overall this is an excellent series.  This season was one of my favorites because the writers/producers took risks unlike you see in most shows.

I've had to toss it and use my skills to build something in its place to hold the cd's securely and them not get all scratched up.

4545130,3,B0053O8A50,"The fourth season, which the producers feared might be the last because of high costs and soft ratings, had the tough job on having to ""END"" the show if necessary, while leaving the door open for more if there was an 11th hour renewal. It did so admirably.  The season deals with the emotional heart of the show, the relationships among the characters, while not stinting on the SF action.  If you skip over the second-to-last episode (which was a preview for what became the fifth and final season) you can see how both the season and the series could have reached a satisfying resolution,albeit with a few loose plot threads left unresolved.  Sadly the video quality on the all the ""Fringe"" DVDs is not as good as other series I've seen.  (The ""CSI"" DVD boxes look almost as good as the HD broadcasts if you have a decent up-converting DVD player.)  These discs sometimes go blocky and pixelated, looking almost like video streamed over a low bandwidth network connection.  I ended up replacing all four seasons with the Blu Ray releases (which also include a few extra features not found on the DVDs.) This is the first time I have ever rebought a TV series on BD, but I think ""Fringe"" is worth it.  (I also bought each season when I could get the best deals, either here at Amazon or at TheWBStore.com, which currently has S1, S2 and S4 for $21.49 each with free shipping.  S3 was sold out, last I looked.)  But if DVD is your only option and you can get them on sale, the story and the acting more than make up for the image quality issues.  I'm going to give my DVD sets to a friend I'm trying to get hooked on the show.",1359158400,,1626,4.39

4545132,5,B0053O8A50,"I started watching the series midway through the third Season mainly because I don't want regular network television. Cable networks are my referred viewing option. However one day I heard a friend talking about it and then I noticed the previews. I managed to catch an episode. I was hooked immediately. The entire premise of the show is amazing! I am absolutely in love with it. As other reviewers have noted, this is a Show that requires thought and concentration but is very entertaining to the sci-fi mindset. It definitely fills a vast void of good sci-fi Entertainment. I was very disappointed when I realized that season five is the last season of this amazing series. I am planning to purchase all five seasons to keep in my library. I don't purchase DVD collections so this one, in my mind, is definitely more than worth it",1359158400,,833,4.712328767123288

Seasons 2 through 4 just got progressively better with a ""WTF"" sprinkled here and there. If you like your shows dumb where you don't have to think outside the box or follow a thread, move on. But for those that were jonesing for something like Lost, I highly recommend Fringe from the very beginning.",1359072000,,409,4.616438356164384

4545136,3,B0053O8A50,"This is a review of the whole season, not so much this episode. I give the first season four stars, the next two five stars. Season 4 loses its edge. (Spoiler alert - but I'll try to keep my comments relatively general) The emotions grow a bit sappy, furthered along by sugary string music, longing looks, and cliche lines. Peter runs around trying to get home, sounding like Dorothy from the ""Wizard of Oz"". There are also overtones of ""It's a Wonderful Life."" Both of these films are great classics, but when a once suspenseful, cutting edge show like ""Fringe"" starts to practically quote them aloud, I groan - also aloud.

It's not that the plot twists aren't interesting, it's just starting to feel like a soap opera.

The ""science"" behind ""fringe events"" and especially the solutions to their many challenges is starting to become offhanded and taken for granted. JJ Abrams has also gotten carried away with the idea that you can always reset stories using time travel and parallel universes (which he also did with Star Trek), and the actors (other than Joshua Jackson, who is always himself, with a singular past, albeit stretched between universes) all have to reinvent their characters for a third (and fourth) time, stretching their creative juices to the limit without much avail. A promising glimpse about thirty years into the future does make me hopeful for season 5 - which is already almost completed, I just haven't gotten there yet.

Abrams once promised that the show would ""jump the shark"" many times, but in the sense of taking risks. The show threatened all season long to jump the shark in the sense of derailing from being watchable, owing to NOT taking as many risks and not executing as well on the risks it did take. My third star comes mostly from being a little sentimental myself - for the first three seasons of truly original programming.",1358899200,,1870,4.765432098765432

4545151,5,B0053O8A50,"Another fantastic, satisfying, mind-bending season for this great series.  You can keep your Mad Men, your Breaking Bad, and your Game of Porns... oops, I mean Thrones.  It is a travesty that these actors and writers have been ignored during the award seasons... John Noble at the very least deserves acting awards for every one of the five seasons of this show, along with Anna Torv.

The sound and picture quality of these Blu-rays is incredible; series TV in HD has come a long way in the past few years, bringing a quality rivaling that of feature films.  The only other thing I could ask for would be higher-resolution audio (uncompressed or DTS-MA) to make the experience more complete.

It's sad that Fringe went on for only 13 more episodes in its fifth and final season, but I suppose it is better to go out with great quality than to sputter out into insignificance.  This - along with BBC's Sherlock - has been my favorite drama series of this millennium;  it is my fervent hope that these actors can go on to projects that continue to enthrall us viewers.  The Fringe creators themselves done just that, by launching the re-boot of the Star Trek franchise.",1358467200,,1168,4.663414634146341

This Season has somehow combined pieces of the previous parts and presents some logical line of developments reduced commercially to a semi-sci-fiction produce targeting audience short of elementary physics knowledge and rich on emotions.

A lovely New York City landscape, vibrant presenting of developments twisting, thoroughly measured and appreciably limited discussions of divine and not so bad performing, including highly-erotic Colonel Broyle (sorry, I am worse in recognizing the faces and memorizing surnames even more than in general English)-nearly-turned-traitor-of-the-Other-Universe, surely warrant further funding for this begun-as-a-scientific-genre crim investigation tale driven further and further from the Earth and realities.

The writing is sharp, the plotting is brisk, the story lines draw you in, the acting is excellent, and the overarching themes are thought-provoking.  John Noble is simply amazing as Walter Bishop, and both Anna Torv and Peter Bishop have clearly grown into their respective roles as Olivia Dunham and Peter Bishop.  If you like sci-fi, or just human dram, this is definitely the show for you.",1357603200,,492,4.833333333333333

4545270,3,B0053O8A50,"Apparently the series producers decided to rearrange things because fourth season Fringe is not set in either of the universes we've tried to understand over the last few years. Walter Bishop keeps seeing someone, finally he & Olivia manage to pull this ""person"" into their universe- it's Peter, pulled from wherever the Observers dumped him. He's able to use his past experiences in Fringe cases to help this world out. It seems the Observers have a dispute going on between themselves over tampering with the timeline and one, ""September"", has been siding with the Bishops since the night he saved Walter and young Peter from drowning.
I had trouble caring about this season and the bizarre ""Letters of Transit"", near seasons end is even set in 2036, apparently the inspiration for the even more depressing fifth and final season. Leonard Nimoy is back, this time as an evil William Bell (probably to try to boost ratings.

I recommend this dvd set to any Sci-Fi fan.,1354752000,,362,4.682539682539683

4545276,5,B0053O8A50,"Fringe is one of the greatest Sci-Fi properties I have ever seen, and this is coming from a life long sci-fi fan. It touches on the greatest sci-fi tropes and puts its own unique spin on them, if not outright improving on them. The show created its own, unique mythology throughout its first three seasons, and many people were dismayed by the beginning of season 4, which in many regards reset continuity. Rest assured though, this was just the shows famed ""slow burn"". Half way through, you find, not only are the events of the past still in motion, the dangers are greater than ever.

This would usually be the segment of the review where I would outline the plot of this season, but it is so sophisticated, so involved, that even the most general outline will ruin the surprise. What I can say is that season 4 doesn't skimp on genre defining episodes. ""One night in October"" and ""Welcome to Westfield"" are just a couple of my personal stand outs.

The Blu-Ray version boasts the series usual spectacular visuals and dynamic sounds. The entire cast, once again, go above and beyond with their performances, but John Noble continues to give Emmy award caliber performances. I know this review doesn't offer much in the way of ""content"", but knowing how much I enjoyed the twists and turns offered by this amazing season, I simply couldn't live with myself if I deprived potential viewers the same experience,just to pad my review. I will close by saying Fringe Season 4 continues the impossibly high standard of quality the show has set, and it is must see TV. A modern classic and a must buy.",1354406400,3,1596,4.656028368794326

After that comes the joke (usually from Walter involving food).  Actors grow on you.  My favorite is probably Walter as he reminds me of my old college professor in Physics Lab class -- gets excited about everyday things because of the science behind them.  It's a series you have to watch on dvd or online (prime instant video exclusive!) or DVR to enjoy as the commercials would kill the storyline progress.

There were some hang-ups in this season, but they fade into the fantastic shroud wrapped around the Fringe storyline.

 Enjoyed the first three seasons for the most part, but in this season, even though there were a couple of good episodes (the two Farnsworths episode was probably the best of this season), I think taking the ""it is a different universe now"" road was Lazy.
 I blame myself for thinking that Fringe would do better, even after having watched another series and a movie that told me what to expect. I just failed to listen.

I think that when the show starting weaving between the two universes, it got pretty complex.

4545373,5,B0053O8A50,"*Warning: contains a spoiler* First and foremost, I must admit I am a HUGE fan of the series.  However, as with most shows that have to do with time, they eventually do things that destroy their own premises.  Barring a complete misunderstanding on my part (which is one of the possible universes I suppose) the events they say still happened in this episode could not have.  For example, the Cortexiphan trials were started because Walter was attempting to find a way to cross universes to take Peter back. This would not have happened (just like it didn't happen in the alternate universe) had Peter died in the water after returning with Walter.  Following this line of thinking, the Cortexiphan group would not have traveled to the alternate universe (because they didn't exist) to retrieve Peter (who was dead) and the Olivia's would have never swapped places.

Possible explanations would be that somehow Walternate was still able to orchestrate the Olivia switch in a similar fashion as he crossed over to retrieve Peter in the original timeline, but they don't bother to explain that here.  Perhaps they explain in a future episode I have not watched which would of course nullify my entire thought.  The future will tell, and if that is the case I wish I could go back in time and stop myself from writing this...wait...

There are others of course...like why would Walter send the machine back in time (and of course Peter was the one it was intended for, but he's dead now so there would be no reason to make it and send it back in time) in order to make the ""hole"" to both worlds at Liberty Island.  Such is the nature of the paradox.  Especially true when a future event is required for past/present events to occur.  I recommend avoiding these types of ""I am my own grandpa"" events to all ""future"" timeline movies or shows.

It keeps you constantly on your toes, taking turns and twists where you least expect them. Although some people say the turn in season 4 - *Spoiler alert* - having the alternate world without Peter, then the incorporation of the observers taking over, and jumping to the future were far fetched, I think over time in the episodes (as more was explained) they showed themselves to be BRILLANT.

I love the show, I love the characters, and I love the first two seasons on Blu-Ray. The third season was a little bit lacking. The fourth season is an utter disappointment.

No behind-the-scenes featurettes from the production, only some people talking about the world mythos. No deleted scenes or expanded scenes, just a short gag reel. And no audio commentaries?! Come on! Fringe fans are among the most dedicated and most loyal to be found, and it's disappointing that WB couldn't be bothered to let the cast and crew record some tracks for them.

4545380,5,B0053O8A50,"hich means you already know what I think of this simply amazing, too good for TV scripted show that NOBODY is watching, hence I get, I think 11 more episodes until my heart is once again broken as I salute the end of another absolutely outstanding television show. I am with both reviewers of TV Guide and USAToday who have tirelessly and shamelessly promoted this show (who both often will try to push a Friday night show opposite it, ie: ""you can watch so and so for some slightly decent entertainment, or you can crawl out of your it's the end of the week and I'm tired and don't want my brain to work too hard malaise and watch Fringe for truly intelligent, well-acted, excellent entertainment"" (sic). I do have to say that putting Grimm up against Fringe is simply Hollywood being rude again as if there is a real choice. I mean, Fringe has been on a lot longer, but has continued to get better and better for the three of us watching it. Grimm is pretty much on a par with Fringe, in creativity and intelligence and lovely quirky characters (seriously, Walter or Monroe? As if we have a choice!), but I think I'm just being bitter again.

Admittedly, Fringe had a bit of a stuttering beginning, but I don't believe I've ever seen a sci fi show that didn't (I'll reference Eureka here, which in my opinion had about the worst first year of any sci fi show I've seen - fast forward to its final show that I used up a box of Kleenex as my heart broke watching what became, to me, as close to the perfection of Firefly we have gotten on the entertainment medium called scripted television). Fringe, for those of you who abandoned it for whatever reasons, thus making me soon face another evening wrapped in my favorite blankie, box of Kleenex on hand as I once again, pay homage to the finale of sci fi perfection, will forever be burned into my memory with its wonderful cast of characters - Olivia, Peter, Astrid, and the ultimate arguably best character since Capt. Malcolm Reynolds of Firefly, Walter, presumably *SPOILER ALERT* defeat the Observers as they seek to strip earth of whatever they need and move on to do the same to another hapless planet. And honestly? How did they find the perfect actress to play Etta - who is the spitting image of Olivia with Peter's eyes?

While I am grateful that we get with Fringe what we have not gotten from countless other wonderful show (she says, bitterly, still wondering just what The Event was even after two or three years).

So I should be grateful to Fox who has been far more generous overall than other networks *cough* NBC *cough* for giving us closure (ie:Prison Break). But really, I couldn't say it better than either the TV Guide guy OR the USAToday guy who have shamelessly and bravely stood up for this truly brilliant show (although without ant compensation) - THIS is not Fox's fault. It is our's.

After all Fox is a business and has continued to allow the same 3.5 million viewers (paltry in network world) the privilege of this intelligent, exceptional scripted show far longer than the numbers game should have allowed. We all make choices with what little time we have these days - especially in the only demographic that counts which boggles my mind - those 18 - 49ers who are simply too busy raising families, working to pay the bills or attending whatever event or child-centered Friday night delight to watch an original brand new Steven Spielberg offering let alone a simple TV show. No matter that those of us OVER the age of 49 have made our money and probably have more discretionary income to spend on most advertisers wares - but I'm on my weighted soap box again. I think even Fox was hoping that the final season of Fringe would garner more than the usual 3.5 million voters as I read the comments when they announced them. I think even Fox would have liked another year of this wonderfully odd cast and the many stories left to tell about them.

But alas, for whatever reasons, we, the People, have spoken and Fringe will soon be no more. Some day, people who could have made a difference now WILL find and watch Fringe and wish they'd watched it when it mattered. So do I. So do I!",1349913600,,4168,4.51523178807947

4545389,5,B0053O8A50,"The Show

Season 4 is about Love. The start of every diabolical scheme by a mad scientist is started because of love, or love lost. The show creators managed to wrangle in the over the top plots and scenarios and focus in on how love really overpowers the decisions we make, good or bad.

The Video Quality

Blu ray quality video is top shelf. The show is crisp and stunning for the most part. The show involves a ton of creatures, video screens, on screen graphics from phones, lasers, and other assorted light sources and they come across great. The only bad elements are flashback scenes from previous seasons that feature softer images. Some skyline establishing shots are soft, but they take up 2-3 seconds of screen time.

The Audio

DTS Master Audio gives your stereo system a workout. The bass was much deeper and richer, the highs are much more crisp. It actually makes other shows sound bad. Seasons 1-3 don't include DTS Master audio, and now I wish they did. Dialog is fast and crisp, and subtitles are very accurate. They even include titles for the many songs the shows play, which helps in purchasing songs from iTunes or Amazon.

The Extras

No commentary, which is a bummer.

The Roundtable is compelling. I have watched it about twice so far, very engaging.

A few more features about Peter Bishop's ""disappearance"" and other show related highlights.

The comic created for the show, written by Joshua Jackson himself! is explored.

A neat blooper real.

4545429,5,B0053O8A50,"Fringe is an amazing series. The acting is phenomenal, the dialog is realistic and never hokey, and the characters are multifaceted and engrossing. The stories are character driven and even with tech there is a strong element of suspense, horror, and romance. All ingredients which combine to form something quite wonderful.

Although many of the episodes in season one felt a little bit formulaic, what I liked was that the 'pattern' they fall into plays a larger role in the overall story. Also, without spoiling anything, the finale has one of the biggest hooks I've ever seen in television history. I literally fell out of my chair.

Seasons two, three, and four get progressively better. The stories take an even harder sci-fi turn, multiple dimensions open up, there are twists and turns, new plot threads spiraling out of control through space and time, and new revelations to behold. Additionally, there are revelations on top of revelations, as this is becoming a hallmark signature of the series.

I have loved Fringe from day one. It is simply the best science fiction show on American television today--and that's not an exaggeration.",1349136000,,1146,5.052910052910053

Like The Twilight Zone, you think about each episode after you've seen it, and it sticks with you for quite awhile.  Fringe has been the underdog on tv ever since its move to Friday nights during season three.  We're lucky that we get a final season to properly wrap the story up.  Too bad that there couldn't be more than five.  I loved how season four dealt with the ""what if"" questions if Peter never existed, and the huge impact he has on the show.  If you are a Fringe fanatic, season four is a must have.  Be sure to watch the fifth and final season to see how it all unfolds.",1348876800,,750,4.2695035460992905

4545436,3,B0053O8A50,"After the first 3 seasons the series takes a sharp turn... for the worse.  After the cliffhanger at the end of season 3 where Peter vanishes, we find out in Season 4 Episode 1 that he never existed and none of the characters remember him.  This of course completely derails the entire premise of the previous 3 seasons.  If Peter never existed, no cross over occurred, no war between the worlds, etc.  The budding romance between Peter and Olivia suddenly just vanishes leaving everyone wondering what was the point of a 3 season build up.

Overall Fringe is a great series for the first 3 seasons.  It's at Season 4 the ratings started dropping, leading to it's cancellation after a (shortened) Season 5. It's almost like a brand new set of writers came on board that never saw any previous episodes.

Letters of Transit begins and ends in 2036 which is where Season 5 will be based (with some flashbacks to current time.)

4545482,5,B0053O8A50,"Fringe is easily the best sci-fi on the boob tube these days but this fourth season was truly something special. Questions that have been percolating in our brains for the last three seasons were finally answered in this cliff hanger of a season. One simply can't absorb all the minute twists and turns in the highly convoluted plots that make up this show when watching it during the regular season. Its way too intelligent of a program to view with commercial interruptions and everyday, mundane distractions such as the phone ringing, etc. The episodes need to be watched back-to-back without any interruptions. I recommend watching it with the shades and blinds drawn tightly shut and with a good friend that you can discuss things with...
Therein lies the pleasure of the show because one person could never really figure everything out in this treasure of a show. The web boards are full of people connecting and debating the higher aspects of Fringe. It became a point of pride for Fox NOT to cancel this prized science fiction program even when its viewership took a drastic dip during the third and fourth seasons. This was because the show became almost impossible to watch if you didn't catch all of the previous episodes and it did indeed become a show that virtually no new viewer could enjoy because of its inherent incomprehensiblity to anyone unfamiliar with its nuances. The first two seasons had a lot of stand alone episodes that anybody could walk in on at any point but by season three, you had to have some familiarity with the Fringe world or you would be left dumbfounded. This alienated alot of viewers and hence, the numbers went into a tailspin. Ironically, the show wasn't getting worse but BETTER as the episodes hung together with an overall plot but this practically halved its audience, as not all people could manage to watch every episode every week. People couldn't keep up with Fringe. It was a cruel Catch-22 that as the show improved, its Nielsons went subterranean.
This dedication to an overall plot culminated in a season four which is really the best science fiction produced on TV since the sci-fi channel's Battlestar Galactica (only Fringe messes with your head). EVERY episode in Season Four is a mind blowing gem that feels more like a really long movie than a one hour program. Season Four actually saved the show which has been renewed for a thirteen episode, season five run which starts in a couple of weeks. Alas, it will be the last...
If you are just surfing along and have never seen Fringe or are somebody who saw an episode here or there, do yourself a favor and start with season one and work your way up to this one. It's intelligent, thought provoking TV that needs to be watched without interruption to be truly understood and appreciated. Any true sci-fi lover will go nuts for it...

Didn't watch seasons 1-3 again first, just plunged right in to season four.
'Previously on Fringe' bits at the start of the episodes always managed to clue me in to what had come before clearly enough that I wasn't confused.

This is such an intriguing show, well worth watching, and watching again.

I'm delighted to know there will be a (shorter) season five to wrap up this fascinating story.

Editing to add:

I realize that other people aren't thrilled with the way things changed beyond the end of the third season, and yes, I see their point(s). On the other hand, I'm mostly just thrilled that extra seasons exist, of whatever length, even if I do sort of prefer the part of the show I think of as ""White Tulip World."" The show seems to have lost a bit of the whimsy and whacked out humor that characterized so much of the earliest seasons, but the story is a serious one now, and there are only so many hours in a season, so I guess I can understand when certain elements take precedence over others.",1347580800,2,1280,4.5
4545486,5,B0053O8A50,"Well let's see... I agree with the earlier review saying that the 4th season is a change from the past 3 seasons. It was a little hard getting used to things not being the same as they were. BUT in the end, the love story that is Fringe, was redeemed. This show is about love more than anything else. It's not about the cases - they are secondary to the thread that ties Walter,Peter,Olivia and Astrid together as well as the characters from the other universe not to mention Broyles!
Some of these episodes are so good that each one goes by in a flash. Granted some of this season's episodes were slightly less interesting than in other seasons but overall I had NO trouble staying interested.
The chemistry of this show between the characters reminds me alot of the original Star Trek series between Kirk, Spock and Mccoy - it is that good!
Looking forward to the final season in 2 weeks. I'l be interested to see where they go with the story. I'm wondering if we'll see the characters in the other universe again....will Olivia regain her powers to fight the Observers? Will they continue the story from Letters of Transit?  I doubt we've seen the last of Bell either. I have no doubt that there will be a climactic ending calling all characters to overcome the observers and set things right once again. If they do it right the bond between all of the characters will matter the most.

The emotional impact of the characters actions and stories; the subtler nuances and connections of the scripts/stories; the crescendo that is the whole becoming greater than the sum of its parts: this is great television, great story telling, great human drama that is unmatched on television. John Noble and Anna Torv are amazing in their abilities to convey so much with so few words. This has become my favorite show, edging out Justified and Burn Notice.

4545508,4,B0053O8A50,"All shows evolve and sometimes they evolve in ways that are popular with the fans challenging their preconceptions as to what the series is about and sometimes not. In the case of ""Fringe: The Complete Fourth Season"" producers and showrunners J.H. Wyman and Jeff Pinker decided to do something bold and radical--eliminate one of the characters for part of the fourth season.

SPOILERS:

Peter (Joshua Jackson)ceased to exist, or rather, died as a child once he had established the link between the two universes and provided stability. As a result the relationships and the events of the past three years are altered for Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), Walter Bishop (John Noble--who still hasn't been nominated for an Emmy--REALY Emmy committee? Have you actually WATCHED his performances?)and Astrid (Jasika Nicole). The Fringe team now includes Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel) on our side as the team struggles with visions and voices of Peter; it seems that he hasn't entirely been erased by September. Suddenly, Peter returns appearing out of nowhere as a man with no past, no present and no future who knows everybody but nobody knows him.

We also have an episode that flashes forward to the future where Baldos (or the Observers as they are really known)control our world after destroying THEIR future world. This flash forward also gives us the opportunity to see how the 13 episode fifth season may play out.

END OF SPOILERS:

The changes during the fourth season essentially allowed the producers to reboot the show recreating the series again and altering the dynamic of the series. Whether or not you enjoy the changes will depend on how invested you were in the previous three seasons but if you trust the producers/writers and give them a chance, you just might find a fourth season that is challenging and rewarding.

As with the previous seasons of ""Fringe"" the transfer is exceptionally good for the Blu-ray (I haven't seen the DVD so can't comment on it). Detail is remarkably sharp and we get improved depth as well as better definition particularly during dark sequences.

The lossless audio is presented in 5.1 and sounds marvelous.

I am a bit disappointed in the special features. ""Fringe"" has always had interesting commentary tracks unfortunately either due to budget constraints for this set or an oversight on the part of Warner Home Video, this set has no commentary tracks. Since these are often among the best of the special features (at least for me--giving new insight and making an episode ""fresh"" again), I'm a bit disappointed that the producers of this set didn't consider providing this option.

On the other hand we get a number of good featurettes on the series. ""The Culture of Fringe"" is a roundtable discussion featuring the producers of the show discussing the science of the show. We also get ""Have You Seen Walter Lately?"" which gathers some of the cast and crews' favorite moments from the show (it's essentially a clip featurette) as well as ""A World Without Peter"" which discusses the void left by Peter and how it impacted all the characters.

""The Observers"" gives us some insight into the Baldos that occupy the world of Fringe. Star Joshua Jackson and the producers introduce ""Beyond the Comic Book"" discussing the creation of the ""Beyond The Fringe: Peter and The Machine"". We also get an digital excerpt from this title.

Finally we get the season gag reel as well as the option stream the series via Ultraviolet for laptops, etc. The deadline to use this option is September 2014.

I enjoyed the fourth season of ""Fringe"" and the risks that the producers took in eliminating a major character for the first third of the season. This altered the dynamics (not in a ""massive"" sense) of the show (for example Walter can't stand Nina in the new timeline and he rarely leaves his lab; Olivia was raised by Nina)but also allowed the possibility of exploring older characters in new ways.

If you haven't seen the fourth season yet give it a chance--it is DIFFERENT than what came before but, then again, each season has had its differences and that's what has kept the show (to me at least)vital and interesting.

4545520,5,B0053O8A50,"The fourth Season of Fringe really went in its own direction, and the makers, once again, dared to push the show into new territory. The idea of a wipe and fresh new start seemed daunting to me at first, but as the Season progressed you really felt that this story they were telling was a fit part of the whole mythology of the show and not simply a gag to bring in new viewers. In the beginning the season seemed slow, with Peter showing up in Episode 4, and the writers not really revealing what exactly happened and where we were until Episode 14. But they managed to pull many interesting stand-alone episodes out of the bag, that, once you finish the season, don't seem to be so stand-alone after all. After completing the season you can really appreciate the beginning more and clearly see the bigger picture into which those early episodes fall into.

By the end of the Season, as it's always with Fringe, the mythology ramps up, the stories have a bigger drive and are clearly heading somewhere. I loved Episode 419 - ""Letters of Transit"" this year which featured a glimpse into a not so bright future, and an episode that also sets up perfectly the fifth and final Season of the show. Many familiar faces return throughout Season Four, which I will not spoil at this moment.

And with the set up of the 2-hour fourth Season Finale it will be almost impossible to wait for the 13-Episode shortened fifth and final Season of this immensely bright and clever sci-fi drama.

4545521,5,B0053O8A50,"So you're here reading some reviews on the latest season of Fringe. Maybe you watched it in the past or maybe a friend told you about it once. Either way you have made and excellent choice. Now I have watched everything Fringe since Fox brought it on in the fall of 2008. I rememeber a lot of people saying it was the next X-Files and such, but there is a lot more here than some of the other sci-fi you have watched. Unlike Star Trek, X-Files, or even Firefly this doesnt have a lot to do with space and more to do with theoretical science or as they refer to it as ""Fringe"" science. Better characters and brilliant writing and just a couple of things that make Fringe so good. Anyway you want to know if this is worth it so here I go.

Now season three introduce a structure of episodes that would alternated between our universe and the other universe. With that they were able to tell the story of both sides. This was an idea I was not too fond of to begin with but I figured out what they were trying to do. They wanted to show you how different things were, based on events and people's decisions in that timeline. This continues in season four and it picks up right from the season three finale. Now some people cannot grasp that storytelling style and I get that but people raved about LOST and it did a very similar thing!(and unlike LOST there is no map required here, contrary to some peoples beliefs)

Now the characters and writing have always been Fringe's strong point. Now my rule is if you don't like sci-fi stop watching it and giving it shoty reviews! Criticts keep trying to grasp things and either get frustrated and stop watching or are just not trying. The actors do a superb job, the best I think being John Noble. He ends up playing multiple versions of the same character and does it flawlessly.

Ok so when it comes down to it I love Fringe and I will be sad to see it go. I am also sad on the low scores (there being only 3 below 4 star at the time which tells you something) just because it was getting too old for them or that they didn't understand what was happening. With that being said a lot of the 4s and 5s have hit it on the head, This is a great show. Fox has never had a lot of long running sci-fi series because they don't want to pay for all the effects IE Firefly and Tera Nova. They put something great out and throw it away when it doesnt make them enough money. And yes to those who say it would have been canceled had if not been for us fans! We helped keep this show alive and we want more stuff like this, We don't need another cop drama or another murder mystery. We want things that play with our minds and makes us think. We don't want some repetative cops and robbers tv show that you can rot and drool in front of the tv until they figure everything out for you. As I said stop watching sci-fi if you are always confused, it is obviously not for you. This series is creative in more ways than most could imagine and that is the glory of it! So thank you to JJ Abrams and all the cast and crew for an amazing series and I can't wait for the fifth and final season!",1345680000,15,3118,4.150413223140496
4545522,2,B0053O8A50,"Entering this season, you need to know only one thing: this is not going to resolve seasons 1-3, this is now an entirely different show and though it references seasons 1-3, you need only have seen the recaps in order to be up to speed.

I did not like season 4.

I'll admit, it got exciting in the middle, but in terms of this season on its own, there were a number of pacing issues, inconsistencies, and unexplained/plot-hole-like elements that dragged it down. Fringe has always been guilty of introducing a number of exciting things midway only to change their mind on a lot of it and introduce something else towards the end, that suffers from not having a sufficient amount of set up.

Every season of the show is guilty of this, and with the exception of season 2, has never truly paid off.

Now, in terms of season 4 and its place in the series as a whole; I hate it. I feel insulted, as an audience member, cheated, to now know that everything I had followed in the first three seasons; the characters, the plots, everything I had invested in, has been abandoned. There are those that will argue that season 4 could not have existed without seasons 1-3, and I understand this, however, season 4 is its own entity and the universe, the story, the characters of the first three seasons are gone - inaccessible, and the further season 4 goes the more it solidifies this fact, ending the debate once and for all with 'A Short Story About Love'.

Here is my warning: for those who have watched seasons 1-3 for the story and characters and wish to see that resolved before anything else, my advice is to treat the season 3 finale as the end of that series, and consider season 4 its spin off. For those who just want entertainment, by all means proceed.

I unfortunately will not be tuning into its fifth and final season, for one simple reason: the show I began watching and became invested in ended in 2011. This latest incarnation represents nothing else but a ""what if?"".",1344902400,15,1978,4.495821727019498

I found it to be a really fun look into one of the possible futures for our Fringe Team.
This is not a ""standard"" episode and if those tend to be your favorites, then this is most likely not going to be an episode you'll love, but it does offer some interesting things to think about and might create some great story lines for Season 5.

4545541,3,B0053O8A50,"I wish I had the heart to watch episodes from Season Four again and give a point-by-point analysis of why I am giving this season only three stars (which I can't since this set is not yet available), but I don't think I would have the heart to do it anyway.
I have adored this show through the first three seasons, (see my review for Season Three) and as someone has already written, even in its diminished form it is still better than the vast majority of shows on TV today.  Even so, this is merely damning the show with faint praise.
The only way I can try to describe what happened in Season Four is to compare it to that infamous season of ""Dallas.""  Patrick Duffy departed, apparently thinking that broader fame awaited him once he left the schlocky show in which he'd been mired for so long.  His character was killed.  Then reality hit--obviously he'd made a big mistake.  No new acting opportunities appeared.  So they wrote him back in by making the entire previous season a dream.
If I were to guess at why Fringe's numbers turned south in Season Four, I would point first to the move to Friday night--Death Valley--but perhaps even more importantly, I would recall the writing staff's gutsy decision to make Peter literally cease to exist at the end of Season Three.  What had happened by then?  We fully understood that Walter had literally riven the universe to save the son (Peter) he'd already lost, then created a corps of supposed super-children, Olivia being one, whose task it would be to save their own universe once it began to collapse. Peter and Olivia had both been put through hell.  Their relationship, one of the primary raison d'etres for the entire show, had been threatened by almost every conceivable force, and a few inconceivable ones.  Somehow they had survived it all.  We even see a future in which they are married and discussing whether it would be wise to raise children in the world they have inherited.  And then Peter simply winks out of being.  The Observers tell us that no one remembers him.
When Season Four begins, all of the emotional capital that had been invested in the Peter - Olivia and Peter - Walter relationships has been dissipated.  Then Olivia and Walter are haunted by visions of a man they don't recognize (since he technically never existed).  When he inexplicably appears, they avoid him like the plague.  Olivia admits to Peter that she has seen him in her dreams, yet remains remarkably disinterested in him.  Walter simply refuses to speak to him or help him in any way.  Peter even encourages another agent  to romantically pursue Olivia since ""his"" Olivia must be in another universe.  These tensions eventually resolve, though in a not entirely graceful or satisfying way. I would surmise that by that time a good chunk of Fringe's already small audience had departed in frustration.  In addition, viewers of Season Four really needed a good grounding in the show to make sense of/fully appreciate the contrasts in worlds created by Peter's ""erasure.""  This made it even less likely that Fringe would find new fans.
I hung in there, and am glad I did, but there is no denying that the quality and consistency of the show suffered markedly in Season Four.
I have no way of knowing how far down Season Four's narrative line the writers had already planned at the end of Season Three.  But given the erratic writing in Season Four and the underwhelming way in which Peter's reappearance and Olivia's adjustment to it are explained, it doesn't seem like they had thought it all out very well.
There were, of course, some truly wonderful episodes, including an examination of Astrid's double, and a one-off that projects well into the show's future.  The acting from the entire cast remains top-notch.
I am thrilled that Fringe will be back for a mini-Season Five, and will be tuned in to every episode.  But I hope the writers will be able to deliver a pre-Season Four level of quality.  The actors and the fans deserve it.",1338508800,59,3989,4.695402298850575
4545542,5,B0053O8A50,"This show, and I mean the show not the episode, has been some pretty entertaining sci-fi for the last 4 years. It has not ""dumbed it down"" for the viewers. It expects the veiwers to keep up and I love that about it. (the episode rocks but this is a review for the series)

I recommend this show to all of my friends that like good sci-fi and story-telling. I also say that it, like Alias and Lost, must be watched from the beginning to get everything out of the show.

The best part about getting a final season is that the writers will get a chance to end it without a cliffhanger, and after several other numerous shows that I could name have been cancelled after only a season or part of a season I feel the joy in getting 100 episodes in the can with all of the multiple story arcs getting resolved. Season 5, even though it is only 13 episodes long, will be that chance.

If you liked Alias and Lost (with the exception of that ending) watch this show and decide for yourself.

Anna/Olivia has been a pleasure to watch as she plays 3-4 versions of the same charactor over the last 4 seasons.
John/Walter has been my favorite mad scientist
Josh/Peter has made a sweeping charactor change since the pilot

All of the other wonderful cast mambers have helped make this what has been a very rare occasion over the last several years - great sci-fi television.

4545555,5,B0053O8A50,"""Fringe"" is everything you wanted the X files to be, but wasn't. The series began as an ""X Files"" clone in the first season, but gradually evolved from merely an episodic series to an underlying exploration of an alternate universe in which the characters are present yet slightly altered.

The acting is great, and it's especially interesting to see the actors do their own parts and their alternate universe doubles. Anna Torv as FBI agent Olivia Dunham is particularly good at showing two distinct personalities, one of whom is sexy and hot and the other who is shy and a little douty. John Noble's Walter Bishop is also an interesting double character - in one universe he is a mentally ill scientist with parts of his brain missing who has been institutionalized for years, and in the other universe he is the hardened head of the government.

With the emphasis on sci fi, they nonetheless get to explore themes such as love, family, and friendship, and it is the interweaving of these themes within the sci fi genre which makes this show so unique.

This series is especially good about advancing the core plot while having self-contained episodes each week. Sometimes they really stretch the limit and have the episodes reflect the issues going on in the core plot, although this is not as common as I would like, but they achieve this very difficult feat far more often than anything else on TV. Episode 15 (""A Short Story About Love"") and episode 17 (""Everything in its Right Place"") are excellent examples.

FWIW - Producer J.J. Abrams was the writer on both of these episodes. Abrams is the creative source for this series, and Abrams has given us ""Alias"" (2001-2006), ""Lost"" (2004-2010), and ""Person of Interest"" (2011). On the big screen he was the writer of ""Armageddon"" (1998), writer/director of ""Mission Impossible 3"" (2006), and producer/director of ""Star Trek"" (2009). Not a bad track record!

The show generally does well in the ratings even though it has been in the deadly Friday night slot for 3 of its 5 years. It has a few primetime Emmy nominations and won several Saturn awards including Best Actress for Anna Torv (2009,2010), Best Supporting Actor for John Noble (2010), and Best Guest Star for Leonard Nimoy (2009). That's right - ""Spock"" is a recurring character in the series, although he only shows up in 11 episodes between 2009 and 2012. Nimoy plays a scientist who founded a top secret highly scientific company with John Noble, and it's their work that ultimately leads to the exploration of the alternate universe.

Bottom line - this is among the best sci fi ever on TV. I rank it on a par with ""Babylon 5"" (1994-8) and ""Life on Mars"" (2006-7).

FWIW - I recommend viewing the whole series, but if you're pressed for time or $ you can probably skip Season 1.",1337212800,3,2797,4.742798353909465
4545556,4,B0053O8A50,"Its already been announced that Season 5 will be Fringe's final season. Its a shame, this show is one of the best ever. It has everything: humor, hard science, fantasy, lots of stuff being blown up, guns, evil geniuses, car chases and hot steamy sex (mostly implied), oh and a naked man (Walter). Of course, Fox kept changing its show times and never repeats any of their shows so it never really stood a chance.
Off my soapbox now, this episode is an excellent cliffhanger, what's next for our intrepid team? I was kinda upset that the CGI for this episode were so noticeable, usually they are so well integrated its hard to spot, but this time it was like the producers didn't care if you knew it was all against a greenscreen. Thankfully, the acting was as great as ever and the script kept me guessing all through the show. I always enjoy the character interaction, this team work together so well that the viewer feels the connection to the story. You want these people to survive and do well.
If you're new to Fringe, start at the begining and work up to now. I you are already a fan, be ready to have a few questions answered and many more asked as we prepare for next year's final season.",1337212800,2,1196,4.416289592760181

I purchased the first three seasons on Blu-ray and I am enjoying them as I walk on the treadmill, talk about making an easy workout, I often want to walk longer to see another episode!

Character development is fantastic, you feel like a part of the family or team.  The stories are amazing and thought provoking, all the while building up to a deeper underlying plot which is so much fun to anticipate!

4545563,5,B0053O8A50,"Fringe appeared on the scene 4 years ago, and I happened to watch the first episode (that is a rarity).  My thoughts then?  It is about fringe science (in other words, strange anomalies and sci-fi plot lines). While I liked the actors, I just could not see watching a series of shows that had something bizarre happening each week, to be solved by our intrepid team (yawn).  I didn't see another.

However, I happened over to my mother's house and she was watching an early show in season 2... there was Spock (er, excuse me, I should say, Leonard Nemoy) and parallel universes and some of the best plots and acting I had seen on TV in a long time. Fringe became the ONE show I watch each week.  I only allow myself one TV show per week, and if there is nothing good, that becomes zero shows. So, I am one of those people that advertisers don't have much influence over... except now that I am watching Fringe. Season Four continues outstanding acting, plots, fun, and intriguing developments.  True, i am still not a huge fan of the weekly anomalies, but at this point, they all fit into the overall plot lines.

Besides, Leonard Nemoy is back!  Thanks for coming back... Leonard Nemoy is a great actor... strange he has not done more (non-Spock) acting in the last many years... but Fringe is 10 times better with Leonard Nemoy than without him!  And that is saying a lot because Fringe has one of the best casts in television.

Update: How about the Amazon Instant Video rendition of this?  Yes, Fringe, Season 4 is good on AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO.  I am not a video-phile, so I can't even compare the HD and SD version of this for you.  I watch in Standard Definition on a 720p television, so it seems fine to me. One thing that does bug me about the entire AMAZON experience, however, is NO CLOSED CAPTIONING. As far as I know, there is no way to get English subtitles with Amazon.  At least with Netflix you can use a Wii or game machine or supported Blu-ray device and get closed captioning on most programs. That is really a big failing, in my opinion.

How about this episode of Fringe? True, Leonard Nemoy is not in this episode, I was reviewing the season (probably in the wrong place, I see now. Worlds Apart (this episode) sets the stage for the final few episodes (if I am correct at this stage in the season) and it highlights our nemesis (Jones) and his plans. The previous episode (Fringe in the future, 2036?) gives us our first glimpse of where were are headed toward this final season and final shows.

I grew attached to the original Fringe team, especially Anna Torv as Olivia.  When they introduced the new characters in episode 19 of season four, my first reaction was confusion and a little frustration trying to figure out where they fit into the big picture.  Once they revealed who Henrietta was, I felt some relief.  It's refreshing to see a few new characters on the show.  I could easily become a Henrietta fan as much as Olivia if the story line doesn't stray too much from the original plot.  I agree with a previous poster that the Observers shouldn't be cast as the villains. Keep the plot interesting with less gestapo story lines and more personal interaction between Olivia, Peter and Henrietta and I'll continue to watch.",1335052800,3,915,4.716981132075472

The observers were always an interesting feature-but they were not the main antagonist as set up throughout the past seasons. Mr Jones had usurped that role, but suddenly a story line developed has been sidelined for some ridiculous story about the bullying, omniscient, corrupt Observers who've taken over the world. Why do they even bother with a plot at all when there seems to be no respect whatsoever for the concept of story anymore? How sad. I actually bought every season and now I feel like a very promising serial with great characters who had good chemistry has been watered down into a scifi channel piece of drivel...And I own it. Wow.

This type of jumping around only works if you hook the audience in some way to make them care about what happens to the people and that's hard to do if the people keep changing character i.e. one minute good the next minute bad and so forth.  Though this was an exciting episode it really starts nowhere and goes nowhere.  The only cohesion was Broyles.  Walter is now a new more sinister man with the piece of his brain replaced.  William Bell is back, at least in amber and there is no Olivia, unless she is dead like Spetember the rogue observer always says has to happen.  Also just on a personal note I liked the Observers at lot better when they were just observing and not affecting man's past or future.  This set up more of a moral dilemma for both them and the human characters in the story.  Too bad they started messing with a good thing.

What sets it apart from other science fiction is everything happens for a reason, and the writers are quite adept at filling in the missing pieces. (You just have to be patient enough to wait for the answers, sometimes coming a season or two later.) My recommendation to anyone is to begin with season one.

It's not merely a question of the acting, which is terrific, especially the strong, sultry under currents present in Anna Torv as FBI agent Olivia Dunham who is not merely investigating the fringe events, but is herself a part of the mysteries at the base of the story. John Noble offers comic relief as the auteur of it all, and his acting here is quite a contrast from the last time you saw him as the insane Denethor in ""Lord of the Rings"", who dines on fruits while he demands his last remaining son go to his sure death.

I won't spoil your appreciation of this episode by giving away any of the plot points, but I want you to notice that the theme in the series is mirrored in the theme for this episode, and the two come together beautifully as the episode moves to its conclusion.

But it is a CRAZY show.  I think I like it because the characters are great, and the actor who plays the father (Walter and Walternate) is HYSTERICAL!!  I'm sorry, but I think he's great.  He manages to recite the most nonsensical dialogue that is pure, utter cheese in a way that works.  Well, I suppose that's the crux: if you feel it works, you probably feel that it works well.  Otherwise, you probably feel everyone else has lost their mind.

When Peter disappeared, his absence left the other characters flat and they seemed to have to work harder to keep the show moving.  In this episode, Peter is finally playing an integral role again and the characters are coming back together.

We look forward to many more seasons of Fringe; it is great entertainment.",1327104000,,440,4.75

I tried to find it on HULU but apparently you have to have a cable provider to view it their and on FOX'S website...weird...so I Was very happy to find the episode on AMAZON and was able to purchase it, great quality and I can watch it on my phone, laptop or tv through my media hub.  Awesome. Thanks Amazon :)",1327017600,,586,4.214285714285714

4545736,5,B0053O8A50,"I first got hooked on Damages, then Breaking Bad, and was very upset about the amount of time to wait for the upcoming seasons of these to be released.

I reluctantly began watching this with my wife, and now I am hooked!  It is a very good show, and one big positive thing is the fact that there is very little bad language and ""adult"" situations.  This lack of questionable material has no ill effects on the story, and allows me to watch this with my young teenage sons.",1326844800,72,473,4.292134831460674
4545737,5,B0053O8A50,"The second half of the Fringe fourth season is off to a mindblowing start. Peter is so desperate to get back to his timeline he is even willing to talk to Walternate on the other side. Olivia and Lincoln agree to help Peter for their own reasons, and once Peter and Lincoln cross over things are not what either Fringe team expects. Peter meets his parents, Lincoln meets his doppleganger, and the real menace behind the new shapeshifters is revealed. While waiting for Peter and Lincoln to return, Olivia gets a shocking cryptic message from an unexpected source.",1326585600,6,564,4.76530612244898

4545739,4,B0053O8A50,"With the final episode from last year stuck in my head, I was so pleased to receive this seasons DVD. The amount of questionable experiments that Dr. Bishop has been responsible for, never ceases to amaze me.  Dealing with the ramifications from those experiments keeps the FBI on their toes.

4545740,3,B0053O8A50,"Season 4 had a promising start: 3 episodes without the obnoxious, nauseating, moronic Peter Bishop. Things worked much better without him. Season 3 had become too gooey with Olivia's (this Olivia's) sudden and totally unrealistic crush on him. Writers of TV series probably have never heard of the expression ""shift in tone."" But now it seems that the idiot is back. Mr. Abrahams, kill him for good; otherwise, you may have to discontinue the series later. Virtually nobody can stand that jerk.",1325289600,2,494,5.036585365853658

4545743,5,B0053O8A50,"Fringe Season Four kicks off with a great episode. After his FBI partner Robert Danzig (Joe Flanagan/Stargate Atlantis) is killed, FBI agent Lincoln Lee is all over the Fringe division demanding information on their cases and the return of his partner's body for a proper burial. Instead of immediate answers, Lincoln finds himself helping with a case that involves translucent shapeshifters. Meanwhile the Observer is told to erase Peter Bishop from time as he is bleeding through the current timeline. The Observer buys all the parts and builds the machine he needs, but he cannot bring himself to eradicate Peter. At the same time, Walter starts to see images of Peter in his TV sending Walter into hysterics. In a nice touch at the end of the episode, Olivia returns agent Danzig's body to Lincoln for burial.",1323302400,7,813,4.9416058394160585
4545774,5,B0053O8A50,"In a very clever episode, the alternate universe Fringe team asks to have a famous criminal profiler brought over to their side to help catch a serial killer. The profiler has no idea that it is his doppleganger in the alternate universe. Once he finds out, the profiler is determined to help the serial killer understand what changed his life and kept him from going down the same dark path. This is a great episode on how even the simplest kindness or gesture can help a person turn their life around vs. continuing on the dark side to a life of crime.",1323302400,,554,4.4411764705882355

Later the Fringe team finds two decomposing corpses. In the lab and in the morgue, the corpses explode with deadly spores. Aaron is brought to the lab and Water treats him like a missing son, working through the loneliness they both feel.

Walter is convinced it is one of his former test subjects - a young boy named Cameron doing astral projecting. When Olivia and Walter track Cameron down, they find a man with horrible side effects from Walter's testing who is angry at Walter for what has happened. By the end of the episode Cameron agrees to help Olivia and Walter disperse the energy field that keeps appearing - until Olivia tells him to stop.

Scientist Malcolm Truss (Arye Gross- Castle/Medical Examiner) jumps at the chance to complete his research that was shut down at MD. At the same time, Peter helps the Fringe team track down the shapeshifters, even though they are more advanced than the ones from his timeline. In the B story, Walter meets with Peter but cannot accept that the adult Peter may be his son. It is a heartbreaking scene for both Peter and Walter, as Walter refuses to accept Peter in his life.",1323302400,,587,4.88
4545778,5,B0053O8A50,"This episode tore my heart in two. Stephen Root and Romy Rosemont (who are actually married in real life) give stellar performances as a man desperate to help his wife beat the onset of dementia and Alzheimers. Like most of us who have a parent suffering the same disease, we would give anything to help them retain their memories, youth and vigor. For Stephen Root, he believes the only thing he can give his wife is time to complete a formula to keep them living in the year before the onset of her illness. The price of this gift comes at a high cost, causing carnage and inexplicable time anomolies and loops in the immediate area surrounding the couples home. Once the final answer to the formula is found, a heartbreaking decision must be made. This is an excellent entry into the Fringe episode library.",1323302400,4,810,4.593103448275862

Then imagine from the time you are born you are used as a lab rat by the Government, and given no chance of a normal life. This heartbreaking episode was about the need for human connection - a chance to interconnect with humankind and the painful loneliness that results when this does not occur. The ending is incredibly bittersweet.",1323302400,3,443,4.620253164556962

Now that I have it on Amazon, I'm all caught up to season 4.  It's a great show, I love the characters.  Walter and Astro are great together it's a sweet and caring dynamic.  I love Olive and hated the Fo Olive taking anything from such a kind strong lead...as if Olive hasn't suffered and lost enough.  I'm hoping that with this new twist we've seen the last of fo Olive.",1322956800,,489,4.21505376344086
4545782,5,B0053O8A50,I've followed Fringe since its first episode and absolutely love it. It's funny at times but more than anything it keeps my interest always. Can't say enough about how much I admire Anna Torv. With her duel role of playing two different Olivia's she makes them both fun to watch. Walter is odd to say the least but he's funny also. All of the cast has been very good and my wife and I look forward to each new episode.,1322438400,18,418,4.2375
4545783,4,B0053O8A50,"This one deals with the nature of ethical dilemmas. Specifically, Walter's kidnapping of his alternate son in an attempt to cure him (which in this incarnation failed and Peter drowned) and an ex-Massive Dynamic researcher who doesn't see his work will first and foremost be used as a covert military weapon. Very well written episode. It was a bit heart-wrenching to hear Walter's recollection of his son's demise and the emotions seeing him as a grown man evoked. Ditto for the scientist when he realizes his wife is dead and all hope of reconciliation of their marriage is gone. Even the little tidbits were thought provoking: Olivia and her sister were raised by Nina Sharp in lieu of state foster care; and apparently she is slipping into the temporal fold again, like when she flipped between universes a season or two back. I did think the twist was fairly televised before it happened but as they quickly established the speed and ferocity of the shapeshifter it ultimately worked. Only oddity I really noticed was that when you know you have two targets send two teams, one to each location. They just seemed to pick one and gamble on it being the right choice. Maybe  it'll be address in a subsequent episode. Even so, THIS is what excellent scifi should be: exploring humanity and philosophy through technology and interactions. The espionage and action didn't hurt either.",1322265600,,1384,4.889361702127659
