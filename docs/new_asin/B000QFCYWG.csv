This movie was a huge disapointment!  Wang Tao plays a detective and does practically no martial arts in this film. Shoji Kurata shows up at the very end to fight a death match with Elsa Yeung in a dojo and that is the only real high point in this film.

A much better film featuring these 2 stars was Ninja Thunderbolt (with Richard Harrison).",1362268800,,360,4.424242424242424
