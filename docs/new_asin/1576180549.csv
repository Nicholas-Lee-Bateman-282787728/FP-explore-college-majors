196057,5,1576180549,"This is an exceptional video that explains the formation of the modern state of Israel.  It is a story that all should know because of the nature of the Israeli-Arab struggles.
The 6 hours of video are edited by a legenday Israeli figure, Abba Eban, who was the first Israeli abmassador to the UN and a member of the National Academy of Sciences.  Thus Mr. Eban was a personal witness to most of the events described in the documentary.  It begins with the rise of anti-semitism and Hitler and never looks back.  The video also does a good job of building tension, and the writers have made hsitory very exciting.  There is live footage, for example, of the declaration if Israel as a nation, the UN vote, and the retaking of Jerusalem in 1967.  Truly inspiring to see.
The video series is very inormative and is historically accurate.  Many atrocities against Israel are documented, but the writers were fair in that the mention the mistakes of Israel too.
This documentary ranks right up there with Ken Burns ""Civil War Series"" as one of the best of all time.  Relive the miracle from a firsthand witness!",1089504000,66,1107,4.641025641025641
196058,5,1576180549,"I love this video set. It is worth every penney it costs. It brings you to tears to watch one of the great prophetic fulfillments of the Bible. A nation reborn after centuries of exile. Mark Twain referred to Israel as a desolate wasteland,but look today and see that the desert blossoms like a rose,as said by the Jewish prophet Isaiah. Hebrew is the only ancient language ever revived. Watch and see first hand the miracle of the nation of Israel. Against absolutely impossible odds it won every war fought,though being out numbered. As a Christian it's fantastic to watch a 20th century miracle. This is a 5 star video series. You won't be disappointed. Also,I recommend Heritage: Civilization and the Jew. You will love both of them.",1045440000,82,737,4.765625
196059,4,1576180549,"I ordered this video with a lot of interest and found it thoroughly enjoyable.  Abba Eban is a very well spoken individual and I found his descriptions very interesting.  It certainly captures the historical perspective very well.  I did feel, however, that having read a great deal on the conflict that the video was very lacking in many details.  I would loved to have seen more on the Entebbe rescue in 1976 as well as more on the Ethiopian Jews that were rescued.  The archival footage was captivating - but it left me thirsting for much more.  Its definately very difficult to capture so much history in so short a time but I for one, would loved to have seen more world reaction to the events in the Middle East, for instance to have focused a little more on the impotent United Nations and the way they are used as a Arab PR company.  However overall I definately reccomend it as a good basis to understand what is happening there but I definately encourage all who view this to do a lot more reading to have a better grasp of the situation in Israel.",1023926400,50,1058,4.422680412371134

7798931,5,1576180549,"A good overview of the history of Israel since its founding in 1948 following the Holocaust.  It is narrated by the former ambassador and foreign minister of Israel, so it is quite a product of history.  Naturally it is told mainly from the Israeli point of view, and that eloquently, but it also includes the opposite views through interviews with several Arabs.  The only pity is that it ends in the early 1990s; this is the older version.  There is a new version that has some extras that brings it more up to date.  Nevertheless, I recommend this film highly--it's a great investment!",1355788800,,588,4.669902912621359
7798932,5,1576180549,"Wondering why Israel is frequently in the news? What are the 1967 boarders? This documentary will fill in the gaps in anyone's understanding.  Israel was destroyed by Rome in the first century and renamed Palistina, Latin for the Philistines who inhabited modern day Gaza. See how this struggling nation was able to turn the desert into green, lush forests and farms. Those living in the area that stayed prospered with the Israelites.  Those who left, expecting the surrounding countries to push Israel into the Mediterranean Sea, have not prospered.  To understand why, watch this DVD.",1308268800,,587,5.157894736842105
7798933,5,1576180549,The information contained in this was awesome. I have read other articles but not with the testimonials that this included. We are using this as additional information in our home schooling curriculum.,1275609600,2,201,5.3125
7798934,4,1576180549,"This is an excellent six-hour documentary series, beginning with the Holocaust and the loss of 6 million Jewish civilians during World War II---two thirds of the Jewish population of Europe.

As one other reviewer noted, that is a disadvantage for the uninformed, for much background concerning World War I, and the subsequent peace accords is of great interest and importance in this story. Palestine, after all, was not the only Mandate established by the League of Nations. There were also mandates in Iraq, Syria and so on. Nor were the Jewish people the only ones who did not ultimately receive all they were promised by the League of Nations: World leaders also reneged upon the League's promises to the Armenians and the Kurds.

Moreover, there is a  great deal missing from this series about the suffering of the one million Jewish people indigenous to the Middle East, that is, those were were expelled with virtually nothing from their homes in Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Morocco, Iran, Libya, Algeria and elsewhere in the Muslim World, beginning in about 1920---before the Jewish people assumed any realistic hope whatsoever of establishing a Jewish state.

Furthermore, virtually nothing is reported here about the perpetual Islamic jihad that began against the indigenous Jewish people of Palestine. For a video compilation of that information, one can turn to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Farewell-Israel-Bush-Iran-and-The-Revolt-of-Islam/dp/B000VXUU6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Farewell Israel: Bush, Iran, and The Revolt of Islam</a>&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Islam-What-the-West-Needs-to-Know/dp/B000PE0GQO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Islam: What the West Needs to Know</a>.

Having said that, however, the films narrated by Abba Eban are quite detailed and very informative on the periods covered, from World War II through 1990.

There are clips of Jewish people from the world over---and it should be noted that half the population of Israel hails from the Middle East and North Africa. If you have the misconception that Israel is a nation of European Jews, this film will certainly help to straighten you out on that score.

However, you should also make an effort to obtain the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Silent-Exodus/dp/B000M3LSBU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Silent Exodus</a>&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Forgotten-Refugees/dp/B000FP2PDU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Forgotten Refugees</a>. (The latter is now available for free viewing on Google.)

Despite its shortcomings, this documentary series is excellent.",1233705600,6,2758,6.620498614958449
7798935,5,1576180549,"This is a very engrossing story of the birth of Israel, the subsequent ingathering of the exiles, and the development of the young country.",1167782400,4,139,4.833333333333333
7798936,3,1576180549,"Abba Eban clearly loves his own role in history, and focuses heavily on events that he was a part of -- there's more about Israel's struggles at the U.N. in the late 1940's than, say, the '48 war.  But Eban glosses over events in a rather underhanded way.  For example, in describing the ""Altalena"" boat affair, he simply states that the specific events were deeply traumatic for Israeli society in the years to come... but I think we could stand to hear that the Haganah/Palmach actually shot at and killed Jewish Irgun fighters who were bobbing helplessly in the water, and this happened long after the Altalena had waved the white flag of surrender.  In this and other ways, Eban displays a shocking bias toward the left.  It simply is not honest about the events that modern-day Jews ought to know about.  Because of his tendency to overload the brief chapters with diplomatic initiatives, rather than focus on other aspects of Israeli history or the conflicts as they occured on the ground, this series ends up being rather lightweight.  And it lacks the emotional 'umph' that it ought to have.  Cold, dry, not-so-factual.",1167696000,9,1127,4.808290155440415
7798937,5,1576180549,"This six-part series does a great job of telling the story of the rebirth of the State of Israel.  There are interviews with and footage of so many historical and political figures, such as Golda Meir, David Ben Gurion, Yitzchak Rabin, Moshe Dayan, Anwar Sadat, King Hussein, Harry Truman, Abba Eban (the narrator), and Jimmy Carter.  There are also interviews with Arabs living in Israel, among them Hanan Ashwari, whom I admire on one hand for her feminist work (esp. since it's not often you see such a prominent feminist in the Arab world) but also feel misgivings about because she's said a lot of anti-Israel things, as though Israel is almost 100% wrong and her own people are almost 100% right, with no gray area or just owning up to some of the basic historical facts presented in this series, instead of painting Israel as an evil monster that can do no right.  It really disturbed me to see a poster of Arafat, the father of modern-day terrorism, on the wall behind her.  The historical facts as presented here show the nation's miraculous rebirth, the struggle it had on its way to being reborn, all of the wars Israel has had waged against it over the years just to defend its existence (the first of which was waged against it when it had barely declared its independence), the anti-Israel bias demonstrated by the UN while at the same time turning a blind eye to terrorism and wars waged against it at every turn, the years when it has experienced peace and calm instead of constant terrorist attacks or preparations for war, what a good job it did of taking in so many immigrants (from Ethiopia, the former Soviet Union, Europe, Northern Africa, Yemen, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and those who voluntarily came from Western nations as opposed to immigrating because they had no other choice), what really caused the refugee crisis among the Arabs who fled Israel in the wake of the War of Independence, political developments, and, yes, the fact that it has made some mistakes over the years.  But even though the government has made some mistakes, as all governments have, it doesn't change the fact that in 70 years, it went from a sparsely-populated near-wasteland to a thriving modern nation with a huge population, many new citizens taken in and made a part of society, and saw the rebirth of Hebrew, the only language to date which has come back from the dead.  I don't see how it could be called one-sided, since the historical facts and evidence support these things so strongly, contrary to the lies spun by the anti-Israel lobby.  Sometimes there is only one right side.  They even, as aforementioned, had a number of interviews with people who have a different perspective on things.

However, I do agree that for the uninitiated, it might seem a bit overwhelming, since it does kind of start in media res.  Someone not incredibly familiar with Israeli history might indeed want a lot more background information to put it all in perspective and understand the meaning of these names, organizations, and Hebrew and Arabic terms.  It might have been better had it begun in the wake of WWI instead of on the eve of WWII, since the events that happened in the interwar years were so instrumental in shaping the course of Israeli history and its struggle for rebirth.  It isn't fair to assume that just because you're already intimately familiar with this material, all other viewers are too.  One also wishes there were a fourth disc in the series, to cover everything that has happened since 1997, the final year covered.  Still, all in all, there's a lot of great material here and it should leave the viewer wanting more, inspired to read more and to find more documentaries like this one.",1145491200,23,3717,4.733746130030959
7798938,2,1576180549,"I rented this DVD because of the glowing reviews here and because I wanted a better understanding of the origin of the modern problems in the Middle East. Overall, I was disappointed by this offering because it didn't give sufficient background and seemed to speak primarily to those who already had a knowledge of the subject. (It also seems to me to be *a bit* biased in Israel's favor vis-a-vis the Palestinians, but that flaw could be accepted and filtered appropriately.)

For instance, the documentary jumps right into the last Zionist Congress in 1939 (or whenever it was), but they never define what the Zionist movement is or where it came from. I know some of this from my reading, but it would be nice to have a summary here -- especially as it relates to the main players in the rest of the documentary. I wish the documentary would have at least started with WWI and the British occupation of Palestine after the fall of the Ottoman Empire, rather than picking up at WWII and mentioning some of the WWI details later. Doing so would have answered questions like, ""Why are the British so important here?""

Another example is keeping track of the people, places, and organizations, which are often named in Hebrew or Arabic and are unfamiliar to the uninitiated. It made the sequence of events hard to follow because we had a hard time keeping track of who was doing what and where. Using more text on the screen, more maps, more recaps, and perhaps more English translations would have improved things greatly, methinks.

The film certainly has value, not least because it is told by a participant and first-hand observer, but it is not for those without much familiarity with the people, places, and issues at hand.",1139443200,21,1728,4.73421926910299
7798939,5,1576180549,"This is a Classy essential documentary.  Not a question of if you should buy it; but rather it is a question of why you have not already!  It is worth every penny!!! It explains and puts into context the Struggle of the Jewish people against German attempts to annihilate them, their stunning post-war ascension into Statehood in spite of the British (!!!) and the resulting International Geopolitical ramifications of this.
All of this amazing history is made clear and comprehensible in a DVD that includes rarely seen, priceless interviews with Zionist supporters such as President Truman, Clark Clifford and other clips such as that of Warren Austin and to many others to list that your children will not see in our ever increasingly anti-Semitic colleges and universities.
The segment which shows the crucial reading in the UN of the United States' recognition of the Jewish Provisional Government will bring tears and chills to anyone who has even the vaguest understanding of the Ezekiel Chapter 37 Dry Bones prophecy!
It is a mesmerizing story that every Jew and Christian in America should see. A story that spans the ages...of the struggles of a people to survive against supernatural odds and rise again to power and prominence in one of the few stories on earth that can literally claim to be a struggle of Biblical proportions.",1106697600,26,1340,4.977678571428571
