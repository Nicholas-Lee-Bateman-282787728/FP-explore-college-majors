8026445,3,B0002D68TW,"In this Volume 4 of the 5 volume video series, ""Advanced Self-Defense Shooting,""  Ken Hackathorn and Bill Wilson act out the use of a vehicle as a weapon against a carjacker.  Unfortunately, they only consider a scenario in which the carjacker is directly in front of the vehicle.  I don't have any statistics.  But, almost every carjacking that I have heard about involved the carjacker approaching the victim from behind or from the side as the victim is about to get into the vehicle or has just got out of the vehicle.  Other carjackings that I have heard about involve the carjacker making forced entry either at the driver side door or at one of the passenger doors to the vehicle.  Bill Wilson addresses the possibility of being carjacked at the driver side door by pointing his finger and saying that he would just engage  the carjacker.  This statement deserves more elaboration if the carjacker already has a handgun pointed at the victim at the driver side door.

Bill Wilson, Ken Hackathorn and Lenny Magill, practice shooting at a moving target  while each of them moves towards cover.  This exercise looks as though it's designed to deal with a drive by shooter.  They discuss and demonstrates skills and techniques necessary to shoot at a moving target while being on the move themselves: maintaining sight alignment and sight picture while moving the gun and tracking the target.

Close range point shooting, shooting without the use of the sights, is also covered here.  This is a contraversal subject with experts who are for it and against it.  Ken Hackathorn advocates and demonstrates its use here for quick reaction to short range targets.  See Gabriel Suarez's book, ""Tactical Pistol Marksmanship, "" for  strong reasons against point shooting.

This video  plays for 60 minutes.  After the 60 minute program has ended, there are the usual  video promotions for other  DVD videos produced by Lenny Magill, Bill Wilson and Ken Hackathorn.
