8013236,5,B0001JXP0M,"For any fan of Roger Raglin, this is one of the DVD's to own. He offers very knowledgable information regarding bucks changing their habits when hunters enter the woods. It is very informative and a great watch. Some may say Roger is a bit over-the-top with his excitement and sillyness, but I really enjoy watching his videos. The excitement is the same feeling a lot of us hunters get, thus for the reason we hunt. It's a great informative video; not simply a trophy kill video. Would recommend.",1416960000,,497,4.659090909090909
