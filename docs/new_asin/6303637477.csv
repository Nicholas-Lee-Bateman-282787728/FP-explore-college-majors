The Two Faces Of Dr. Jekyll (1960) is a classic Hammer movie based on the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde story, although Hammer puts their own spin on it.  The cinematography is the film's greatest asset, in my opinion.  Good sets, good lighting, and colorful costumes make this movie enjoyable.  This movie has gotten mixed reviews, but I like it.  It has the classic Hammer feel to it that the movies of Hammer's golden age had, with some classic Hammer camp sprinkled in.

Favorite scene:  The snake lady.  A very well done scene.

I recommend this movie.",1353456000,,661,4.6695652173913045
7852127,4,6303637477,"I found this on DVD as part of a four film DVD set called Icons Of Horror Hammer Films. The set includes this film `Scream Of Fear', `The Gorgon` and `The Curse Of The Mummy's Tomb'.

This film ranked third on in the lot, but there is plenty of fun to be had with the set. This film is one I saw on TV as a kid and I always liked it, even though this film deals with a more psychological fiend rather than physically ugly and menacing monster. I was impressed by the film's production, pacing and atmosphere. The DVD transfer in really nice and it includes the trailers for all four films.",1248220800,,589,4.166666666666667
7852128,1,6303637477,"This has to be one of the worst remakes in history! The entire plot of Robert Louis Stevenson's book was chopped to pieces to bring forth this trash. I am a long time fan of the book and most film remakes of this classic but I hated this one. I felt ripped off and what's so bad is that I didn't buy it! I saw it on On Demand for free and I still feel gyped!

The plot was so twisted that the film could have been an entirely different story. Maybe it would have been much better if this pathetic facade wasn't claiming to be a remake of Dr. Jekyll and had just come off as an entire new film. I would have forgiven that.

I didn't like anything about this film accept Christopher Lee's performance. I found him wooden but still more talented than the rest of the cast. The design of the film was laughable. It takes place in London yet the leading lady who played Jekyll's wife looked straight out of ""Hee Haw"" or ""Bonanza""! It's like the production designer didn't understand the setting! This film was just ridiculous and I say avoid it at all costs!

The biggest ripoff to me was that when Lee changed into Hyde, he didn't change into a monster or creature, he changed into a man minus his beard and thick eyebrows!  The best part of the Jekyll and Hyde story is the doctor's change from looking human to looking scary and grotesque, not changing into a man who looked like he merely shaved! Talk about a gyp and the worst part of it was that this Hyde wasn't scary nor violent! He walked around talking the entire film and didn't get violent until the end and only killed one person!  One? Hyde was a menacing serial killer with a monstrous appetite for murder!  Didn't the people who made this movie even read the book?  It's like they'd never heard of the story before. Hyde was laughable and not at all scary!  All he did was go out to balls and court women!  Pathetic, pitiful and sad!!!

I've never seen a plot butchered like this one was! It made Mary Reilly (what we all thought was the worst Jekyll and Hyde remake of all), look like a gem compared to this garbage! I don't recommend this to anyone unless you are confined to some bed or chair, can't get up and HAVE to watch it. Unless you're being forced don't bother and surely don't waste one penny buying it!

I can't stress how pitiful this was. If I never see it again it will be too soon! I just wish I could have given zero stars and anyone who says this is a good remake did not read the book! If RLS were alive he'd definitely sue the makers of this mess! The nerve of the creators of this production butchering a classic!",1222905600,,2596,4.245436105476673
7852129,5,6303637477,"Elegant and cultivated british director Terence Fisher,specialist since 1958 in personal adaptations of horror myths( or as he prefered "" adult fairy-tales "")  got another great achievement with this visually imaginative adaptation of Stevenson's famous novel reinventing again through tradition without turning aside the philosophical intention of the story,conducting the film beyond the duality between Good and Evil incarnated in the double personality of Dr. Jekyll to build a sharp study about hipocresy and the double morality and false prejudices hidden behind social conventions and correct manners. The only fault of the film, as occurs in the other adaptations of this novel, is to leave the role of the two personalities of the main character to an only actor, dismounting so the ending surprise. In the other side , the film is plenty of subtle visual invention and keeps the narrative sobriety, absence of effectism and depth in the drawing of the psychology of the characters habitual in Fisher films since his jump into "" fantastique"". Testimony of his visual creativity is the two metamorphosis of Dr. Jekyll: the first, out of shot ( we see only his shadow );the second transformation is shown through the changing of his handwriting to another while he's writing in his private diary about the effects of the drugs he's experimenting. Another achievement is the ironic characterizetion of Hyde as a handsome, seductive and cynical dandy;ironic twist in relation to the previous adaptations supported by the paradoxal situation of Hyde, despaired in seducing his own wife,a foolish woman who despises the two  faces of Jekyll and cheats him having an "" affaire "" with one of his colleagues: a weak, vicious and oportunist man, convincingly incarnated by Christopher Lee.",1120694400,3,1788,5.270175438596492
7852130,3,6303637477,"I had waited for a long time to finally see this films and I would say some of my expectaions were met and some were not. The film begins with Dr. Jekyll speaking of his theory that each person has an inner self that could be set free. He then proceeds to inject himself with a concoction that transforms him into the suave, but evil Hyde. Hyde then goes off trying everything Jekyll would not and he tries to come between the affair his wife is having with his best friend. Eventually Hyde gets more daring and Jekyll and Hyde have the unavoidable battle for the same body.  I give credit to Hammer foa different approach, but it never really covers any different ground that is explored in any other Jekyll-Hyde movie. There are  no new revelations or solutions just a different kind of Hyde with the same results. He may be more dangerous than the typical beastly Hyde because he is much more cunning, but we never really get any sense of that by the film's end. Usually Jekyll is a brilliant scientist who goes  step too far with his curiosity, but this Jekyll seems like a dull and lonely man who is just unhappy with his life and he would never have the stregnth of character to win out over a dark half. The film does hit more than it misses, but I think it could have been a bit stronger in the story department.  Paul Masse is hot and cold, he handles the Hyde part fairly well, but Jekyll seems fairly unbelievable and the transforamtions are just fair. Christopher Lee contributes one of the best roles he ever had for Hammer, it is a shame he didn't get more of the sharp dialogue he recieved here, he handles it beautifully. Dawn Addams is fairly good as Jekyll's wife, I always thought Hammer's leading ladies in the late 50's and very early 60's were worlds above most of the actresses they used later on.  The source print used here looks washed out, it is faded in the bright parts and too dark in other places. This is a shame because I am sure this film once had the same vibrant color of other Hammer made at the same time. Still this film is worth seeing.",975974400,,2076,4.354005167958657
