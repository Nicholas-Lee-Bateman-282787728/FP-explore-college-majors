1005598,5,6305269017,"I think this is one of Barney's best works. Highly recommended for ages 2+ because some topics require conceptual understanding. Many things are portrayed here : colours, alphabets, shapes & all in a very catchy, unforgettable manner. My 2 yr old is extremely good with his colours & shapes due to this (now he is 3) & also loves reading books. There is emphasis on reading & a children's story (Little Red Riding Hood) is re-enacted flawlessly. The kids are mostly natural & don't over-act much. I find myself watching & enjoying with my son too. The DVD has other menu options such a book read aloud by Barney which captivates my son. I don't think I've seen him blink as few times as when watching this DVD! Excellent & definitely worth many watches!!",1050537600,12,754,4.634328358208955
1005599,5,6305269017,"As the mother of a very active 20 month old boy I highly recommend this video.  While teaching the values of reading, counting and learning in general, this program provides a colorful and fun background for the subject of going to school.  My son will watch nearly the entire 50 minutes and always begs to watch the ""I love you"" song over and over. If you're looking for which Barney movie to buy, your child should love this one!",1012521600,5,431,4.443037974683544

1005601,5,6305269017,"This is the first Barney DVD I bought for my 18 month old daughter.  She absolutely loves it.  She watches it only about 10 times a day!  Now even I know all the words.  The songs are catchy and educational, with dancey rhythms.  She has put aside Sesame Street and Blues Clues for this one.  This DVD keeps her busy for extended periods of time.  When I invite my friends over who have little ones too, they have their own party with this DVD.  I absolutely recommend it for keeping the very active 18 month old busy and educated.",986169600,10,531,4.292929292929293

I was particularly pleased with the  bright vibrant colours and the clarity.  The educational subjects (ie 123  & ABC) were varied and well thought out.
Great value for money with  the added material, interactive games, previews on other Barney shows.

This is a really great Barney episode. Its a high quality production and my two-year-old loves it.

1005842,5,6305269017,"This really is a wonderful DVD that hits all the basics of preschool education such as discriminating between colors and shapes, learning to count, recognizing letters, etc. My one criticism is that it presents a world so idealized that few children will be able to relate to it. No one except Baby Bop for a few seconds has a problem, no one stops smiling. It's relentlessly cheerful to the point that you wonder if the producers have ever read any child psychology that discusses that huge and immense fears and aggressive urges that children have to learn to master. Fairy tales like Grimms have captivated children for centuries--why do the producers of this Barney video think that they must extract all negativity to only present the sunny side of life. I'm not saying I want a gloomy Barney but this video is so over the top happy that it is essentially a fantasy world not having much connection to any school its child viewers will ever encounter. Nevertheless, I give it 5 stars because despite this flaw, it has a lot going for it, and when viewed in the context of other DVDs like Mr. Rogers (who definitely deals with anger, fear, etc.) it all balances out. Nevertheless, if you're going to go with Barney, I would recommend the Rhyme Time DVD, which, by the way, also includes a section of numbers and the alphabet.",1206662400,,1329,4.659574468085107
