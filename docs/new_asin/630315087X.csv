587706,5,630315087X,"""Up the Down Staircase"" is a wonderful film. It portrays Coolidge High School in New York City, and an idealistic teacher who discovers the harsh realities found in the urban schools in America. Even though it was made in 1967, it still holds true 35 years later. It is a story of courage and triumph. The star is Sandy Dennis, a superb actress whose performance is flawless as the teacher. It also features Eileen Heckart, Ruth White, Jean Stapleton, and Sorrell Booke. This film is a classic masterpeice, and is highly recommended.",1010793600,47,533,4.804347826086956
587707,5,630315087X,"Bel Kaufman's novel is one of those books that falls into the beloved category for most people who have read it.  This 1967 film does a marvelous job of bringing the antinovel to life.  An ""antinovel"" is simply an avant-garde novel that offers a radical departure from the convention of the traditional novels, which Kaufman does by offering up letters, memos, directives from the principal, student comments, notes between teachers, school forms, and even papers from wastebaskets to create a vivid picture of first-year teaching Silvia Barrett struggling to deal with the joys of teaching at an inner-city school.  Most of the credit for this film goes to Sandy Dennis for her indelible performance as Miss Barrett and screenwriter Tad Mosel for making the raw elements of Kaufman's novel work.
The supporting cast is a perfect mix of recognizable character actors for the teachers and complete unknowns for the students.  Sorrell Booke is the principal, Roy Poole the hardnosed assistant principal, Jean Stapleton the harried secretary, Eileen Heckart and Ruth White the good teachers, and Paul Barringer the moody bad boy of the English Department.  One of the most horrifying scenes I have ever seen in a film is when Barringer's character calmly corrects the love note written to him by a young female student.  He corrects her punctuation and spelling while she has to endure his callous insensitivity, and when Alice jumps from the window of his classroom we are horrified but not surprised.  But this is just one of many memorable scenes in this film.
""Up the Down Staircase"" is one of those films that inspires people to be teachers, or, better yet, to stay in teaching.  It does not sugarcoat how things are in an inner-city school.  If anything, it pours on the worst aspects of the entire experience.  For Sylvia the problem is that she can barely notice the successes.  Her class is engaged in a spirited discussion of how the opening of Dicken's ""A Tale of Two Cities"" relates to their own lives, but how can she enjoy their enthusiasm when the assistant principal is complaining about the noise level in her class.  Sylvia has decided to flee to the suburbs and a nice, safe, private school when her decision to have her class act out a trial based on ""Silas Marner"" bears a most surprising and touching result.  It is amazing how emotional you can get over a student's simple revelations: ""Miss Barrett....I'm 'Me.'""  Throughout the film director Robert Mulligan captures the chaos of an overcrowded high school, but at the key moment he frames Sylvia in a long shot as the pivotal moment in her life as a teacher when she learns with unforgettable power how much difference one teacher can have in the life of one student.
When I met Sandy Dennis I told her about how my father actually stayed up to watch ""The Out of Towners,"" which was unusual because my father never stays up late to watch any movie.  She said her father liked that one too.  But it is really as Sylvia Barrett in ""Up the Down Staircase,"" and not her Oscar winning performance as Honey in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" that is how I think most people remember this talented actress.  This film is not simply an American version of ""To Sir, With Love,"" it is just simply the most inspirational movie about teaching I have ever seen.  And it is better than ""Boston Public,"" too.  Final plea: If you can find the book, read it too.",1006041600,15,3420,4.756345177664975
587708,5,630315087X,"I watched this film for the very first time today and it is incredible.  Sandy Dennis was brilliant as a young, idealistic school teacher who is slowly worn down, and ultimately rejuvenated, by her experiences working at  an inner-city school.  The film has disturbing scenes, happy scenes, sad  scenes, and even some funny scenes.  Most of all this film is real...it  touches your heart and, to anyone who has ever been a teacher or attended a  public school, the experiences Sandy Dennis's character has with the school  nurse and secretary are hilariously realistic.

She arrives at Calvin Coolidge High School and finds, on the first day of the new school year, that her classroom has no chalk, no desk blotter, a broken window toward the back of the room (with pieces of glass on the floor), and a student desk that is broken. There are also crowded hallways, a bell that rings at the wrong time, and a group of students who are unruly.

587903,4,630315087X,"I wished that they added more to this DVD than just the film and the trailer. Bel Kaufman, the author, was actually in the movie but only briefly. There are plenty of familiar faces that are sadly no longer with us in this film like Eileen Heckart, Sandy Dennis, Ruth White, Sorrell Brooke, Florence Stanley, and Jean Stapleton. Frances Sternhagen plays the librarian who thankfully is still alive. The film is set in New York City.

The film is done on location and in New York City studios. Sandy Dennis plays Sylvia Barrett, an idealistic new teacher, who was just hired to work there. She deals with the reality of urban schools. Even though this film is about 50 years old, it is still relevant about the problems plaguing urban schools. The high school here is grim and depressing more like the unemployment office. Who would want to learn there?

The teachers don't have to stay but they do out of loyalty. When Sylvia Barrett considers leaving for a private school, you can tell that she has had enough. Sandy Dennis was the perfect actress to play the role. Ruth White was great in her role too. Jean Stapleton plays the school secretary. Florence Stanley plays the devoted guidance counselor.

This film is based on the experiences of the author, Bel Kaufman, who has a cameo here. The cast is excellent even the actors and actresses who play the students in the film. There is a realism feel about like in the city during hard times. There are some students who sleep because they have to work nights. There is a student who does a heartbreaking act in the film.

If you're interested in teaching or just want to see a good film, you should check this film out. I would have liked more offered on the DVD perhaps a tribute to Sandy Dennis, the Oscar winning actress, who could move you to tears or make you laugh.",1410048000,,1824,4.551829268292683

587966,1,630315087X,"I could only sit through about 20 minutes of this tripe! I thought this would be a fun movie; and having gone to high-school in NYC myself, albeit in the 70's, I figured I'd enjoy the nostalgia aspect.  This movie was just so stupid and boring, I couldn't stand it. You don't care about/have any interest in any of the characters.

The one positive thing I can say: It does paint an accurate portrait of two aspects of the NYC school system, by illustrating what a babylon of confusion it is; how the staff are more interested in (and forced to) follow petty rules in regard to everything they ever do; and how the atmosphere in the schools is totally not conducive to learning (and it's much worse, today!)- but such things do not make for entertainment,  alone.",1407888000,2,763,4.5144927536231885

587968,1,630315087X,"Up the Down Stair Case - this is a movie I've heard about for awhile, and I started watching it with great expectations, without previewing it for my kids.  We were all disappointed and somewhat disturbed.  We kept saying, ""That's not ok for a teacher to do that!"" or ""There must be more to this scene than we realize, because at first glance, it looks like the teacher was ineffective at best and a liar/betrayer/enabler at worst"".  Overall, every one of us found this movie very depressing and not well produced.  New teacher, difficult class, she tried to help, but the movie shows instances where she gives promises to students (probably unwise promises), they take her on the promises, and then she completely dumps them, instances where she encourages student-teacher romance on a very vulnerable student with a teacher that is known to be unethical and self-absorbed, instances where she got herself into life threatening situations and then just kinda got out with no real reason or plot, and the most difficult, instances where she tried to help someone and then never made any contact again - the girl who went to the hospital for attempting suicide but survived - she never visited or made any contact with her, the story was just left hanging; the girl who was abused - when she realized the nurse wasn't going to do anything, and she didn't attempt to do anything herself except help the girl cover the evidence.  I realize that real life is not all fun and games, there are a lot of stinky parts to it, but if this is supposed to be a story about a stellar teacher, it didn't live up to its billing.",1402185600,3,1613,4.625874125874126
587969,5,630315087X,Always has been my favorite teaching movie.  It is as realistic as a movie can be on this subject. Thumbs up!,1387670400,,109,4.190476190476191

587971,5,630315087X,"I'm often critical of the `good teacher saves unruly students' movies, because they are all so similar and formulaic and rarely ever feel fresh or original.  When I got `Up the Down Staircase' in the mail, I was a tad hesitant.  Yes, I wanted to see the film.  I had just seen `To Sir, With Love', and while it was a tad lazy in the film's conclusion and import of message, it was charming and rather delightful, and this film being released in the same year held the same promise.

I didn't want to be disappointed.

The great thing about `Up the Down Staircase' is that it certainly follows a mold and yet it breaks that mold in order to find depth in all the nooks and crannies.  In fact, as much as I enjoyed `To Sir, With Love', this film is leagues better.  It actually finds ways to make it all make sense and keep a sharp fluidity and natural edit.

Sandy Dennis stars as Sylvia Barrett, a young teacher thrust into a bad school where the students are defiant and the teachers are apathetic and she dares to try and make a difference.  The thing is, she really cares and because of that she really does make a difference.  Her students respond to her, they get her teaching style and they feel respected and wanted.  She is shaken to the core by the many diverse personalities and she doubts herself many times because of this.  What is so commendable about the film is that it never questions itself.  It has no qualms with actually `going there', presenting themes that could be considered taboo, especially for the time.  Because of this, the film carries with it a weight and urgency that isn't always associated with films in this genre (at least not in a natural sense).

Look for Patrick Bedford in a scene stealing supporting role as a disillusioned teacher.",1380844800,,1774,4.482866043613707

587975,4,630315087X,"I thank God for this great story of a beginning high school teacher with a B.A. and an M.A.  I think it was fiction.  Sandy Dennis did a great job and showed how even an ordinary person might be a responsible, effective and strong influence on a tough assignment.

I thought the writing might show a somewhat common, sort-of rebellious view of America society and culture with predictable jibes and innuendo.  However, I think it was nevertheless valuable and the development grew climatically.  It was exciting.

The testimony concerning a dear, dear girl who jumped from a window after expressing her distressing love for her teacher and being rebuffed had a definite effect on me that I think was very good and it did show a greater intensity of good writing than I had seen earlier in the movie.

Sandy Dennis was portrayed as a heroine, and I think she was.  The young male student who she south to reach indicated that she seemed to show an undo and perhaps provocative interest in him.  He certainly misbehaved (in a measure), but I think her portrayed character did show a lapse in her heroic wisdom.

588027,5,630315087X,"I recently stumbled across Sandy Dennis in an episode of The Fugitive in Season one. Sandy was just so stunningly attractive in her prime. She was literally captivating. Based on that episode of The Fugitive I looked up some Sandy Dennis movies. I found ""Up The Down Staircase"" and ""The Fox"". I just watched ""Up The Down Staircase"" last night. The movie was a delight. The movie was so seamless and well acted to where I felt like I was watching a tv show. To know that this show was only a movie was the real disappointment of it all. I wanted more. In 1967 when ""Staircase"" came out I was only four years old. So I obviously saw this movie, or parts of it, later as an older child. Whatever the case the seeds of Sandy Dennis's BEAUTY was planted in my mind long ago. And Ms. Dennis, who never married, was a lot more than just physical beauty, she could act as well. I am looking forward to seeing ""The Fox"" as well. In this latter movie Dennis lives with another woman in a cabin. One of them dies at the end when a tree falls on her. The plot is slyly of a man coming between two women who were probably in love. The fox was sort of symptomatic of something being wrong in this relationship, or that it couldn't or probably wouldn't work out. The cancer in this relationship started as a fox who was killing chickens. The cancer later became a man. Call it what you want to but the movie was about a man coming between two women sort of ending a lesbian love affair. Sadly though it doesn't seem that there are a lot of Sandy Dennis movies with the actress in a leading role. In the case of simple romance movies I'd have to say those aren't that entertaining to me. Anyway, check this movie out because Sandy Dennis is a delight.",1325030400,3,1735,4.260606060606061

I watched this movie and was reminded as to why I liked it in the first place. This movie should serve as an inspiration to anyone who wants to become a teacher. I know times have changed from since the movie was made in 1967, but the message is still the same: If you are able to get through to at least one student, you are on the right track. We do not give teachers enough credit today, and teachers are not paid nearly enough. Teaching is a profession one has to have a passion for, as did Sylvia Barrett in the movie. Sandy Dennis gave an awesome inspiring performance in the movie. We also get to see Jean Stapleton, Florence Stanley and Sorrell Booke all before they became regulars on tv sitcoms.

And there were, indeed, staircases so labeled in order to prevent traffic jams during passing.  There were teachers who were pompous and insensitive and others who were vivacious and caring.  Some became burnt out from never feeling fulfilled.  A few, however, remained inspired.  All this comes to light in this movie, including an administration, which seems more concerned with following meaningless rules than it does with meaningful education.  Sandy Denis looks to me too young to be a teacher, but then again there were many who would ask me for a hall pass during my first couple of years as a teacher.  I was 22 in 1966.

Like the recent Entre Le Murs (The Class), Up the Down Staircase eschews the traditional mold of the new-teacher-inspires-students story in favor of a series of more relaxed and unplotted vignettes about a school year; while this method may have merit, in the case of Up the Down Staircase it leads to an unfocused and rambling movie that doesn't have story as much as storylines and doesn't conclude as much as end.

Into the chaos of Calvin Coolidge High School walks Sylvia Barrett, a young, inexperienced teacher intent on making a difference through the nave methods she developed from her insular, college-trained perspective. You can figure out how her methods are initially greeted and how indifferent her fellow teachers have become to such optimism. However, she perseveres with a blend of patience and subtle defiance, and there is a wonderfully liberated scene where her students become enraptured by the opening paragraphs of Dickens'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Tale-of-Two-Cities/dp/0141439602/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Tale of Two Cities</a>. As Miss Barrett gets to know her students and fellow teachers, so do we, and her personal journey leads to revelations that lend emotional resonance to the viewer thanks to Tad Mosel's incisive, unsentimental screenplay (based on Bel Kaufman's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1965-best-seller/dp/0060973617/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1965 best-seller</a>). Interestingly, we never see her life outside of school, which makes the drama within the school environs all the more compelling.

Known for her idiosyncratic style and perpetually nervous manner, Dennis uses her unique style to strong effect resulting in a remarkably empathetic performance. Familiar faces dot the supporting cast - Eileen Heckart as a cheery teacher masking an inappropriate crush on a student, Jean Stapleton as a harried administrator, Roy Poole as the tough-minded principal, Sorrell Booke as the poker-faced superintendent, Ruth White as a veteran teacher who teaches Sylvia how to survive the urban jungle, and Florence Stanley as an unctuous, absurdly organized counselor. Looking like a cross between Sal Mineo and John Stamos, Jeff Howard, who later played bit parts in Hal Hartley's films, cannily handles the role of a delinquent with potential, though Patrick Bedford somewhat overdoes his role as a lecherous teacher who dismisses a shy schoolgirl's romantic advances. My only reservation is that the film runs a bit long at 124 minutes. The DVD's only significant extra is the original theatrical trailer.",1201305600,5,4407,7.522243713733076

Sandy Dennis, the queen of quirkiness, was unforgettable in this, her very best role (we miss you Sandy)!!

And while we're at it, how about releasing some of her other ""lost"" films on DVD, such as Robert Altman's ""That Cold Day In The Park""-- and let's not forget one of the all-time guilty pleasures (based on the D.H. Lawrence novella), ""The Fox.""

588076,5,630315087X,"It's hard to believe this role wasn't written for Sandy Dennis.  Of course, the film is derived from the classic book about an idealistic young teacher on her first job, confronted with street-wise students in her first year.
This movie was the first I'd ever seen with Sandy Dennis.  I was in 7th grade when it was released, and all the friends I had saw it with me.  We all agreed that it was more 'realistic' than ""To Sir With Love"" which we also went to see.  I was captivated by Ms. Dennis's quirky looks and personality.  Of course, this was long before VCR's, so all one could do was watch for new releases, which I did.  Unfortunately, Ms. Dennis didn't release anything else that came to our small town before I left high school.  I didn't forget her, though.
When I recently purchased this movie, and a reprint of the book, it had been over 20 years since I'd watched it.  Of course, styles and mannerisms have changed enormously since this movie was released.  However, the basic personalities of the actors' parts haven't changed.  There certainly is a universality in all the main parts.  The guidance counselor, for instance--didn't so many of us know one like this, who seemed to lose the true purpose of the job in a wave of psychological jabber?  Jean Stapleton was superb in her part as the school secretary, wrapped up in endless silly forms and paperwork, yet with a respect for the 'artistic' English teacher/writer that motivated her to falsify his time.  Of course, the unusual personal acting quality that was Sandy Dennis plays off of all these others, in that familiar-yet-distant manner that she mastered.
Thirty-five years on, I find I still prefer this movie to ""Sir"", because it is less saccharin.  Not saccharin at all, as a matter of fact.  I wish it were on DVD, but am happy to be able to get it on VHS rather than not at all.  The video transfer is satisfactory, not great.  For wide-screen fans, this isn't.
Could this movie be remade today?  Doubtful, even if a decent cast could be found.  Teenagers have become more sophisticated and if anything, more cynical.  As have so many teachers.  Enjoy this movie for what it was, and still is.",1029628800,20,2175,4.6266318537859
588077,5,630315087X,"Sandy Dennis in her role as high school teacher Sylvia Barrett is truly magnificent!!! She outshines every other actor or actress in the movie. She does not overact - instead, she strikes one by her flawless presentation of an initially overtaxed teacher who develops towards an inspiring person, not only for her pupils, but also for those who watch the film with the intention to become a teacher her- or himself, as I do. What I appreciate especially about Up the down staircase is that with a minimum of special effects or dramatic events, a realistic portrayal of school life is achieved - from the teacher's as well as from the pupil's point of view. Dennis herself ranks among the most underrated Hollywood actresses, but like Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, the film Up the down staircase stands as one of her masterpieces and prove that back in 1992, when she died of ovarian cancer, America lost one of its most gifted and unique actresses.",1013990400,23,950,4.763636363636364

7840057,4,630315087X,"Based on the popular book of the same name by Bel Kaufman, this movie is a mostly faithful adaptation.  It stars Sandy Dennis as Sylvia Bennett, an idealist first year teacher at a public high school in New York via 1960s.  As one may expect, the students are rowdy, loud, involved in gangs, etc.  If that wasn't enough, Miss Bennett must also navigate the mine field that is the administration and its specialized language or pedagese such as ""may that be a challenge unto you,"" ""please keep all circulars on file, in their order,"" and of course going ""up the down staircase.""  As a science teacher who had his first year experience in a public high school, this movie (and book) tells it exactly as it is, revealing the thoughts of students and teachers alike.  This movie will seem dated but the message it provides is timeless.  If you have read the book, then you should see this movie.  It changes the order of events from the book but not terribly.  For anybody wondering what it's like to be a first-year teacher, watch this movie.",1504483200,,1039,4.578378378378378
