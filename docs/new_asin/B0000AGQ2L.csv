I loved the script and I thought Kristen Bell played her part wonderfully. No matter how small the movie,it doesn't have to be expensive to make, when the script is good and the players.

1906164,3,B0000AGQ2L,"This is yet another movie following the same old tired recipe: Make your character obnoxious so he can change in Act 3.  It never seems to dawn on these filmmakers that people who watch family movies try to avoid repulsive people.

What saves this movie from one-star status is Tim Matheson and a rather restrained Sean Young.  You can't completely dislike Tim no matter how dismal the character he plays, and Sean Young is always a treat to watch.

On the other hand again, it doesn't bother the moviemakers that having the only beautiful young woman in this small town in love with a hateful old man might be just a little incredible.",1202774400,,636,4.601769911504425
1906165,4,B0000AGQ2L,"This is a TV movie and it has the usual TV type dramatic elements such as alcoholism, divorce, dysfunction, etc.  But I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was also genuine and sweet.  It's a simple story of a 17 year old girl (Kristen Bell) spending the summer with her father (Tim Matheson) whom she hasn't seen in ten years.  He lives by a lake in a small town in Arizona which gives the movie a very nice look and mood.  I wish it were shot in wide screen to take better advantage of the scenery but alas, this is TV fare.

Matheson and Bell are very good together and the supporting characters are low-key and likable.  I enjoyed my time at 'Moonlight Bay' and I think you will too.",1155427200,12,692,4.244274809160306
1906166,4,B0000AGQ2L,"In all honesty I purchased this dvd because it was cheap and had the sexy Kristen Bell (Veronica Mars) in it.  I wasn't expecting much from it, but it turned out to be a heart-warming film.  The performances were excellent and it had a nice look to it.  There are no extras and it only comes in full-screen (it was a made-for-tv movie) but it was entertaining enough to watch.  I'm glad I bought it.",1106870400,18,399,4.28

1906171,1,B0000AGQ2L,"Everything about this movie was good to a point, and it could have been an excellent movie...except for two things. For most people in today's world, these two things are commonplace and not a problem. But for those who hold to a higher standard of entertainment viewing, you need to know that there is quite a bit of foul language in the movie not only from the father but also from the daughter...and there is a morning after scene between the father and his girlfriend. Had I known these things, I would not have purchased this movie. Larry Levinson's films are almost always completely free of these things. You're slipping, Larry.",1398124800,,635,4.72972972972973
1906172,4,B0000AGQ2L,I liked how the relationship between the dad and daughter . That they got past their difficulties and finally got along and cared for one another. I wish Ed Asner had a bigger part .. He's a good actor..,1382918400,,203,4.230769230769231
1906173,5,B0000AGQ2L,"This is a cute movie and I like Tim Matheson, he plays a really good part, the movie is so true to life and the things that are really going on in the real world, has allot of good parts and has a good story to it, cute movie!!",1374883200,2,227,3.6530612244897958
1906174,4,B0000AGQ2L,"I lived where this was filmed for 32 years then moved away so the amazingly beautiful scenery is the most amazing part for me BUT it was also surprising to me how much of the people's stories could have been written about different people I knew who lived there. An entertaining, well acted, look into people's lives.",1369440000,,317,4.578947368421052
1906175,5,B0000AGQ2L,"The King and Queen of Moonlight Bay is about a 17 year old girl named Alison Dodge(Kristen Bell) who comes to Arizona to visit her father, Al Dodge (Tim Matheson) for the summer before she starts college. When Alison was six years old her father left her and mother. At first Alison and Al does not get along  because Al does a lot a drinking.  Al spends his time as a handyman and shutting out people around him.  Al also has a romance going on with a woman named Sandy (Sean Young) who works at the hardware store in town.  Alison meets a guy named Tim (Bug Hall). Two times during the movie Al tries to kick Alison out.  Watch this movie to find out what happens to Al and Alison. Also find out if Alison goes home or leaves after Al and Alison fight.  It is a great movie.",1361059200,,776,4.14
1906176,4,B0000AGQ2L,"While I really like Tim Matheson, the movie was ok, but I can't have it where my grandchildren might watch it even though they are in their early teens.. Explicit education should come from their parents. But, my friends will borrow it. As for the pkg..it shipped as new and was in fine shape and on time.",1354320000,,305,4.368421052631579
1906177,4,B0000AGQ2L,This movie is great and funny as a father finds out he has a teenage daughter. Tim is the greatest playing the father. Sean Young does a good job as the father's lady friend. The questions asked and discussions taking place made me laugh so hard. Movie well done. Ed Asner was so real in this movie as teen learned a lot from him.,1349481600,4,330,4.171875

place where my brother used to live - Lake Havasu  as it used to be before
it became a bigger town.  It was like going back in time.  If I never get to
see that beautiful desert, mountains and the lake I can always see it here.",1336435200,,300,3.8852459016393444

1906180,5,B0000AGQ2L,"The KING and QUEEN of Moonlight Bay is a film released in 2002.  I LOVED it!  Tears were coursing down my cheeks at the end.  It has a great cast.  Kristen Bell played a 17-year old who decides to spend her last summer before university with her dad, played by Tim Matheson, whom she has not seen since he walked out on her & her mom when she was just six.  Sean Young played Tim's love interest & Ed Asner played a sweet curmudgeonly retired English teacher who becomes a sort of mentor to Kristen.
 The entire movie takes place in a small town on the shore of Lake Havasu in Arizona, where Tim lives in a trailer outside of town right on the lake.  This is a quiet film about human emotions & relationships.  Tim is taciturn & keeps his emotions & ideas to himself.  He has found work as a handyman in a place where he can wall himself off from responsible human relationships.  Will he finally open up enough to begin a life with his on-again, off-again girlfriend?  Will he let his daughter back into his life & love her as the dad she needs to have.  Will Kristen finally build a relationship with her dad?  How does Ed fit into their lives & how does she handle awakening sexual desires with her first real boyfriend?  Ed adds color to the whole film, which is very short at just 88 minutes in length. The actors all give superb performances.  No one is over the top.  Everyone is believable.  This movie is simply a wonderful slice of life & tugs at the heart.",1308182400,7,1467,4.276363636363636

1906185,5,B0000AGQ2L,"The daughter(Kristen Bell) is heading for college in the fall, she wants to spend her last free summer with the father she hardly remembers. She is saddened to find out dad has many faults. Can she overcome her feelings and accept him just as he is?
Dad (Tim Matheson) desperately wants to see his daughter after all these years, but at the same time he doesn't want her there. He lives in a beat-up old moble home on the beach and drinks to excess. He doesn't want his only child to see what he's become.
His girl friend is very much in love with him and becomes close to his daughter. Can they build a relationship in one short summer?
This movie is for all Tim Matheson fans. A must own for anyone who likes family reunion movies!",1253059200,7,733,4.318840579710145
1906186,3,B0000AGQ2L,"first, the cast here is great- the performances create memorable characters.  The movie seems a little short in run-time.  I was wishing the script to be a little longer, so that there would be more scenes for the actors.

the film gives a realistic look at how alcohol can destroy a family, (divorce, abuse, emotional scars).  Kristen Bell & Tim Matheson especially deliver good performances, as daughter & father.  Many people who come from broken homes can surely relate to these characters and circumstances.

This is also interesting for those children/adolescents whose parents are going through, or have already had, a divorce.  That theme is addressed as well.",1208649600,,668,5.12962962962963

7997221,4,B0000AGQ2L,"This is about as hard-hitting as Hallmark ever gets. The King and Queen of Moonlight Bay, based on Michael de Guzman's novel, is a sometimes gentle but sometimes fierce coming-of-age story. It's about 17-year-old Alison (Kristen Bell) who, on her last summer holiday before going to college, takes the long bus ride from San Diego to Arizona for a chance to get to know her estranged father. For much of the film, Alison and you and I would come to think, ""Why bother?"" For Alison's father, Mr. Al Dodge (Tim Matheson), is a loutish man, an angry drunkard, a ""handyman and trailer trash"" as one colorful local was won't to address him. (And yet he's got a piano stashed in his tumbledown shack by the lake, so we suspect he's salvageable.) For much of the film, Alison, brimming with abandonment issues, keeps reaching out, only to have Al Dodge bat away her overtures. This movie was first broadcast on July, 2003 and Kristen Bell was only 22 back then and could easily pass for a teen (as further evidenced by her landing Veronica Mars a year later). Her acting is superb. She always had this knack for injecting equal doses of moxie and sensitivity into her character. The rest of the cast keep pace with solid performances, and, so, the raw emotions gut punch you harder and those reconciliatory moments feel more earned. I haven't seen Sean Young is anything in years, but she's very becoming as Al's long-suffering girlfriend. Conversely, Ed Asner's character seems too contrived and convenient, but maybe it's because he kept pushing Tolstoy's War & Peace on Bell, and I had to read that long-ass book in school and I am still resentful about that. At some juncture, a nervy exec must've done work in the hallowed Hallmark boardroom, because this movie was allowed to explore, with surprisng frankness, several mature themes. So it's best to alert the family sorts as some material may be too grown up for the ankle biters. But, hey, for Frozen fans, Bell has a scene in which she sweetly sings ""On Moonlight Bay."" The King and Queen of Moonlight Bay has some choppy moments, but it's very much worth checking out if you're down for redemptive father-daughter stories.",1437264000,,2175,4.756613756613756
