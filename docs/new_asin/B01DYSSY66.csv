8757328,4,B01DYSSY66,"P.W.G. Champion Roderick Strong defended his championship against Chris Hero with Strong heavily focusing on Hero's back with different submissions & impactful offense along with his trademark backbreakers with Hero also focusing on Strong's neck taking him to his own ""city"" with the amount of of times he performed a specific maneuver on him.  Zack Sabre Jr. faced off against Akira Tozawa that definitely had the biggest crowd reactions before they even touched each other leading to a comedic response to it before officially starting the match with both men being very evenly matched from chain wrestling with various stalemates to using the same moves & counters against each other both in the ring & on the floor in a very hard fought match.  Jack Evans wrestled against Drew Galloway with the announcers putting it perfectly that Evans ""talked himself into a beating"" getting tossed & turned inside out by Drew only for Evans to eventually execute a strategy to neutralize Drew's size & strength.  Other matches include Chris Dickinson making his debut against Brian Cage making an impact in the opening seconds as both men played a game of one upping each other with their power & agility; Drew Gulak vs. Timothy Thatcher in a heavily submission based european styles match; Sami Callihan against Trevor Lee in a physical match; and Mike Bailey faced Adam Cole with Bailey utilizing his speed & educated feet Cole being able to stay a step ahead focusing on neutralizing his opponent's speed advantage.

Good show from top to bottom from P.W.G.",1473897600,,1553,5.007751937984496
