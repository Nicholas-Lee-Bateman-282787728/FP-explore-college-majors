here, 3 friends who are so close, they are more like brothers living and growing up in the barrio of Los Angeles.

Danny is the tough, machismo, grew up on his own cause his mom left them and his dad never cared much about him. Alonso is the playboy, ""certified pimp"" like he says, and Raymo (Clifton Collins Jr.) is trying to be the man of him family. Without his dad, he needs money to pay the rent and help him mom out, so he starts to sell drugs with Gramps, who has taken over as the drug man in the area.

then there is Joe, who has just gotten out from serving time for selling drugs. he's out, and trying to keep clean and in many ways, is like a father figure to Danny and Raymo.

Road Dogz follows Danny, Raymo and Alonso, three ""brothers"" who hustle by playing basketball for money.

Alonso meets a girl, Chesby, and falls in love with her, gets her pregnant and then has to marry her.

Danny, who has abandend by his mom, is now in the trouble because his girlfriend Lucy is leaving to New York for school.

He wants to make something of his life, so he finds a job to try and get his dad off his back, but nothing seems to be working out the way he intended it to.

then Raymo, who got into the drug thing to make money to help his mom out gets popped by two guys for all his money and drugs.

Raymo, who is a real man and can't take it that if he is going to get popped, he dosen't want it to be in front of his mom, so he goes on not worrying.

Gramps, who the whole time is starting to fued with Joe, wants to get at Raymo for being jacked off his money and more importantly damaging his rep on the streets that he is soft, so he catches up with Raymo and threatens to kill him, but Raymo won't budge and the deal ends there.

they hoop it up and win, and things all of a sudden are making sense, and then BAM, showdown between Raymo, Big Joe and Gramps.

Raymo is cut off by Gramps who pulls out a gun at him, and then walks around the corner and tells Gramps to squash everything.

one thing leads to another, and......

can't give it away, you have to watch the movie.

it's really a good movie, corny at times, but funny, good, and sad cause in the end, it's all about life, growing up and moving on. things change, and really, that is the story of Road Dogz, and inbetween change, their is still that unity of friends being so close, they are like brothers.

great movie, i recomend.",1139616000,2,2460,4.051652892561983
7956745,4,B00005Y6X7,"THREE LATINO FRIENDS FACE DIFFERENT OBSTACLES IN LOS ANGELES. GOOD ACTING AND A VERY VERY CONVINCING STORY PUTS THIS A CUT ABOVE MANY OF THE OTHER GANGSTA MOVIES THAT'RE CURRENTLY DOWN AT THE VIDEO STORE RIGHT NOW. THIS MIGHT EVEN BE ABLE TO COMPARE TO ''BOYZ N THE HOOD'', WHICH I CAN'T SAY FOR MANY OF THE OTHER HOOD MOVIES THAT'RE OUT TODAY. THIS IS DEFINITELY WORTH RENTING OR BETTER YET, WORTH OWNING. I ADVISE ALL HOOD MOVIE FANATICS TO GET THIS MOVIE THE NEXT TIME THEY GO TO A VIDEO STORE. YOU'LL BE VERY VERY SUPRISED LIKE I WAS.",1088380800,,538,4.39
