6927836,5,B00RDCKLHA,"Rewrite is an intelligent comedy about a failing Hollywood screenwriter who takes a job as a professor to have any income whatsoever. Shallow, witty, and depressed, he learns to break out through his interactions with students. The story is charming and witty enough to provide laugh out loud lines. Particularly amusing is the ex-Marine professor with a wife and four daughters who dote on his health and diet.

Yes, Hugh Grant virtually always plays the same urbane, self-deprecating character, but he's REALLY good at it. :-)

Well written, well acted, and it contains just enough surprises to keep even the most cynical of viewers watching & enjoying.  Highly recommended.",1505520000,,375,4.828125

6927842,3,B00RDCKLHA,"It's Hugh Grant, eh, so you know it's going to be pretty much a light rom-com...and it is. Enjoyable on the whole because the cast is first-rate down to the smallest role. For what it is, it's fine.

DVD comes with just a Making Of, and we learn it's pretty much the director drawing on his college past.",1501632000,,304,4.241379310344827
6927843,2,B00RDCKLHA,"In this light comedy Hugh Grant plays a one-hit-wonder screen writer now unable to get a job.  Desperate he takes a position as writer in residence at SUNY Binghamton in upstate New York, He promptly sleeps with an undergrad, chooses a class based on how the girls look and tried to coast doing as little as possible.  Basically living the dream.

Will he find love and fulfillment in this obscure school?
Will his students learn to find their true voices?
Will he learn more from them than he taught?
Will he cash in on his talented student's success?
Will his early recklessness come back to haunt him?

Assuming you have ever seen a move, read a book or watched a play before I think you know the answers to all of these.

This is the sort of unambitious comedy that never even really tries to make you laugh, just smile a bit.  It coasts on the charm of Hugh Grant, Marisa Tomei and the supporting cast (and they are all quite charming).  They all play broad caricatures - the humorless feminist, the nerd, the tough dean with a heart of gold etc.  They do it well but there's nothing terribly original here.

The deleted scenes had a funny bit where the students read from their scripts, it's a shame it was cut since it's a rare character-building moment, does a lot to establish the students and is a plot point later.

I'm a Binghamton grad and that was pretty much why I saw this.  It brought a smile to my face when I saw the campus, the Red Robin Diner and the former site of Fat Cat Books (now deserted... sniff...).  And then a frown when I saw many scenes obviously not filmed in Binghamton including a final shot of the campus (well a campus somewhere) that was obviously not Binghamton (based on the credits it looks like it was a school in Staten Island).  Which kind of begs the questions of why set the film in Binghamton if you're only going to do a few establishing shots?  Well probably because the writer/director is a Binghamton grad, but that also begs the question of why he thought the idea of anyone voluntarily going to our school makes for a good punchline.

So it's OK, but not really something to seek out.",1501372800,,2138,4.432225063938619

He learns from his mistakes and actually starts to overcome himself to see some more important things in life than himself. I love a story that is funny and can teach a lesson or has merit. Fun to see Alison Janney as well, loved her for years in West Wing. This is a very different role from CJ but good and plays nicely as a foe to Grant's character.

6927870,3,B00RDCKLHA,"This little bit of fluff provides some predictable entertainment.  Grant plays Keith Michaels, a one-hit screenwriting wonder who has fallen on hard times.  His agent offers him a visiting gig in the English department at the university formally known as Harpur College (then SUNY-Binghamton, now Binghamton U.)  While the English department receives a standard sendup, there is a short supply of actual realism.  Visiting creative writing instructors are not hired via Hollywood Agents.  They are not given cars and housing as part of their assignment and they do not teach one course a semester.  These days their department chairs are unlikely to be former Marines.

Poor Binghamton is described as if it is the end of the earthmeteorologically, geographically and culturallybut that is just an obvious tipoff that the protagonist will find his true home there, turn his life around, discover that he is, at heart, a teacher, and so on.  Grant has a strong supporting cast to help him achieve this.  J.K. Simmons plays his chair, Chris Elliott his colleague, Allison Janney the imperious, lonely, pretentious and distinguished senior colleague who bedevils him whenever he strays and Marisa Tomei his love interesta returning student who works at the bookstore, waits tables at a local restaurant and has been working on a screenplay depicting her own life.  When Grant enters her life she will have to re-write that screenplay, just as he re-writes his life.  One other bit of hyper-unreality: one of Grants students pens a screenplay that is taken on by Grants agent and then promptly sold to a Hollywood production company for beaucoup bucks.  He is then congratulated by the girl of his classroom dreams.

Bottom line: a nice bit of diversion for a slow evening.  There are two or three memorable lines.  It is also satisfying to see English departments depicted as fairy tale places, since they are (in their own way, though not quite this way).  Representing them as such returns us to the now seldom-visited land of gentle (not savage) satire and provides the perfect locus for comic entertainment.",1477526400,,2108,5.084302325581396

6927873,1,B00RDCKLHA,"This movie is confused,  It is not terribly romantic nor funny.

Is it romantic? The heroine played beautifully by Marisa Tomei should be completely grossed out instead of supporting this morose writer played by Hugh Grant. He is an 50-something alcoholic has not just a fling with not-yet-21 year old college student but a 'relationship'. Far, far away in a distant galaxy from romantic or even likable.  Nevertheless, the heroine tilts her head and works to envision him as heroic.

Is it comedic? In between horribly inappropriate, it works at being light-hearted. Odd neighbors, oddly intense movie producers, stereotypical odd professors and odder multi-ethic students.

So without so much of a genre, this movie became a very bizarre coming of age movie. Others have retold the plot, but basically the hero must ""rewrite"" his ridiculous and foolhardy screwups into a new happy life. Unfortunately, his journey took too long to start and ended all too abruptly.",1475107200,,966,5.166666666666667

It is hardly a groundbreaking movie, and there are occasional minor missteps, but this is a sweet and beautiful movie.  Hugh Grant and Marisa Tomai are perfectly cast, and the supporting actors are also well chosen (I can't believe how good Christ Eliot is, and J. K. Simmons is his usual reliable self).  This is a movie that slipped through the cracks, but it is well worth seeing (or owning).  You won't regret it.",1449446400,,576,4.457142857142857
6927940,3,B00RDCKLHA,"This is a satisfying comedy featuring Hugh and Marisa Tome. It is about a Hollywood screen who wrote a successful movie, but who is down on his luck. His agent gets him a teaching job at a college in Binghamton, New York. He likes his student, whom is he trying to teach to write screen plays,though does not see himself as a teacher. He has his ups and downs with his students, makes the mistake of getting involved with one young enough to be his daughter. one of his students is older than the rest, with two daughters, with whom he has a touch and go relationship.with. One of his male students write something he likes and sends to his agent, which she gets produced. When he gets involved with a young girl, he is supposed to go before a board for bad conduct. he talks to the up tight head of the board, who gives him her book to review, after which he decides to stay with the college. his students are glad he is back to help them finish their screen play. This movie ends on a happy note. this is a light comedy which made me feel sad in some cases and smile in other cases. it also mad me think about how to write a story.

Don't get me wrong - I think he has always been an exceptional actor but I think this one is his best - period.

The story is that of a screenwriter who has basically been run out of Hollywood who ends up teaching at a university in Binghamton, NY and finds that his students are both inspiring and quite possibly better people than he is.  Hugh Grant has his charms and manages to convey enough guilt and smugness at the same time to make the character work.  The surrounding characters are basically variations on usual rom com tropes, but JK Simmons, generally a standout in anything he's involved in, is the real joy of the film.  He provides the lightness needed to keep the film and one's emotions afloat when it all starts getting a bit sad and depressing.  Predictable, somewhat enjoyable.

It had some elements of the typical mindless chick flick to it, but also some pretty good insights into human behaviour and Grants dry wit was just about right - not too much that it was annoying.

Hugh Grant plays a has been screenwriter who ends up teaching at a college when he can no longer produce saleable scripts. He only teaches one class, which seems odd to me, and fills it up with mostly nubile young women, which seems true to character to me. His character starts out believing you can't teach writing but as he actually starts teaching it to his students he starts to believe maybe it can be taught.",1437350400,,745,4.398550724637682

6928017,1,B00RDCKLHA,"My husband got this for me because I had three film successes early on (I'm now 66), had almost thirty stageplays produced, and sold dozens of short stories, an autobiography, and two novels.  Then L.A. (I was born here and stayed here) wore me out and I taught acting and scriptwriting for over twenty years.  In my miserable old age I decided to write a fresh new screenplay, but the message of this movie took all the motivation out of me and made me regret, well, just about everything I've ever done.  (""Just give up what you love, you stupid old fool."")

Whoever wrote the script for The Rewrite should be shot.  First rule of scriptwriting:  Never write about a writer.  And it's true.  Writers who write about writers either don't know how to write, have failed miserably because they don't know how to write, think writing is just so cool they ""need"" to write about it, or have a grudge against a publisher or producer.  The plot rambles along randomly, washing a great cast up on the shore where they die a third of the way through this abomination.

Hugh Grant usually doesn't let me down, but he didn't have anything to work with, which makes me wonder why he agreed to play this lame role.  Allison Janney should just have known better.  The others, most of whom hit their peaks earlier on, probably just didn't have anything else to do.  So if you respect the cast members, save yourself the pain of watching them deliver dead lines and act like simps.

Just avoid the movie.  I'll bet everyone who reads this review a hundred bucks that big time nepotism was involved in the sale of this miserable script, because no honest script reader (something else I did for several years) wouldn't put it anywhere but the slush pile, where it belongs.",1436918400,3,1756,4.565495207667731

He also becomes Romantically involved with a single mum,  played by Marisa Tomei and the on screen romance
begins.  This is a typical Hugh Grant Romantic Comedy a part he plays so well and often.
It's an enjoyable movie and it doesn't stray from what you would expect from a Hugh Grant RomCom Movie.

6928031,4,B00RDCKLHA,"Hugh Grant plays a screenwriter who won an Oscar fifteen years ago, but now is unemployed and broke. His agent arranges for him to take a job teaching screenwriting in a university in upstate New York. It's the last thing he wants to do, but he has no choice. There, he gets off to a bad start, sleeping with one of his students and insulting a tenured formidable member of his department, played by the amazing Allison Janney, by telling her he hates Jane Austen, her area of expertise (a fact made all the more funny due to Grant's prior role in the Austen classic ""Sense and Sensibility""). He then meets a single mom played by Marissa Tomei who both challenges him and brings out the best in him. While it definitely has some morally questionable moments, this is a laugh-out-loud funny movie, filled with great supporting characters, and is ultimately a story of redemption. Those who have ever dreamed of becoming a screenwriter will find it especially enjoyable.

It is unrated, but would probably be PG-13 for one swear and sexual suggestions.",1436054400,,1050,4.737704918032787

While, in truth, most of the movie probably was ""shot"" on sets in Toronto or some such place, the obvious location shots on campus and through the city streets were gratifying.

6928096,4,B00RDCKLHA,"Marc Lawrence (Miss Congeniality, Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous, Two Weeks Notice, Music and Lyrics, etc) both wrote and directed this light hearted comedy and while its focus is on comedy, the film has a lot to say about midlife crises, career choices, student life, and learning to be optimistic.

An Oscar-winning writer, Keith Michaels (Hugh Grant) is on hard times - poor followup films, no interest from the industry, bad debts, a divorce, and writer's block - and his agent finds him a screenwriting teaching job in Binghamton, NY at SUNY. Arriving in the town he is put off by the incessant rain, drinks in a local bar and picks up a student (Bella Heathcote) who wants to be in his screenwriting class and his bed, and makes a fool of himself at the faculty welcoming reception when he angers the Jane Austen expert Mary Weldon (Allison Janney), embarrasses his boss Dr Lerner (JK Simmons), and has a wretched start with his first class (instead of reading the 30 screenplays from which he is to select his class he instead goes online and selects the most attractive girls). He encounters Holly (Marisa Tomei), a single mom taking classes there and that develops slowly into a meaningful, life changing relationship. Despite the efforts of friends he has made, his affair with a student nearly dismisses him from his job, but he stays because of his unexpected growing interest in his students and in teaching - and Holly, of course.

Had I really succeeded at anything else, I might never have found the determination to succeed in the one arena I believed I truly belonged.""

In the latter movie cited, the faded pop star is able to forge a path to greater creativity thanks to Drew Barrymore. In the latter, the writer finds a move across country to be trying at first but ultimately beneficial to finding a new talent and, perhaps, even reigniting his creative spark in writing.  Marisa Tomei proves to be a helpful friend but there is no romance that comes to actual fruition on screen, an interesting and meaningful contrast to many of the formulaic films produced by Hollywood. Music & Lyrics did well playing to a mass market and the Rewrite projects a somewhat more the sensibility of an independent film.

6928167,3,B00RDCKLHA,"It is certainly not academy award material but for .99 cents rental they were offering at the moment and with a cast that includes Hugh Grant (not really one my favorites, but I can deal with him) and Marisa Tomei ( academy award winner for ""my Cousin Vinny) now there is an actress that since winning the academy award, hasn't had that many memorable big productions unfortunately for her to sink her teeth into and is a bad thing for a good actress ( I feel) as she is. This was a cute film about an out of work actor (Hugh Grant) that has not been able to make or get a chance to produce another film after his first major very successful one, he had made many years before for which most people remember him for. So against his own better judgment, when his agent offers him a job as a university professor in some small town and he initially right away said no, but as he is doing that the electricity in his apartment was cut off (apparently for not paying the bill), he promptly changed his mind and accepted the position.
Having no experience as a professor he goes on to give a shot and with it his reputation follows ending up sleeping with a beautiful student but very intellectual at time makes you wonder, whom was using whom although this was against the rules, which he claimed he was not aware of.
Marisa Tomei, happens to live in this town as a single mother with two young daughters and holding on to two jobs while at the same time trying to better herself by enrolling in college to pursue her dream of someday becoming a writer, where she meets him by taking his class after first seeing him in a restaurant she works at while Hugh is attempting to have dinner with this student which did not go so well.
Mr. Grant had various funny lines within his script and delivers them greatly as well as Marisa and they act well together. It was a good story and worth enough for you to waste an hour and half of your time if you find yourself needing to do something. The film had a very good supporting cast that would appear from time to time with J.K Simmons (best supporting actor winner for Whiplash, this past year) and Allison Janney (from TV show MOM) and daytime Emmy award Emmy award winner as well as Broadway actress. She worked together with Simmons in the good production of the film of Juno as married parents so it was fun to see them working together again not as a married couple in this film, but more as a principal of the school with very strict rules expectancy from her teacher's staff.
Anyway, I recommend this picture and there is no nudity at all, just a few F words here and there from the delightful Mr. Grant. Enjoy. won't spend money buying it though, just renting.",1430265600,2,2707,4.362376237623763

I enjoyed the scene where Hugh after a few drinks speaks honestly at a wine and cheese event to the miserable feminist  professor who decides to try to crush him for his lack of political correctness. Hugh's character says ""female empowerment.... A movie with kick ass female characters?  I would rather see one where she gets her ass kicked"".  Freedom of academic expression does not cover this academic expression, of course. His career prospects at SUNY Binghamton are not the same after this.  Later he throws some gas on the flames with some mistakes he makes. It was pretty humorous.

Marisa Tomei was great as usual. She plays a bright hard working mom who is back at school. She persuades Hughs character that these skills can be taught.  Initially he is convinced that students either have talent or dont.  He sees improvement in the students and begins to think he can teach.

Hopefully, romantic comedy is funny but it often isn't. This story is also inspiring. It's about a washed up screenwriter who is forced to teach at a college. And at every point it just hits it's marks. The main character is both sympathetic and very believable. The teachers and students are unbelievably well drawn. There's the college president, sidekick English teacher, and uptight department chair. The students are just as well drawn. Whoever wrote the screenplay definitely did it from personal knowledge. It felt very authentic. The humor is dry, which I really like.

 At one point, the main character has the opportunity to get back in the game. He turns it down, for the one and only reason you would do such a thing. It's just a very authentic film. And also very funny.

Marissa herself, was quite engaging, the sort of character that you want in your own life. A hardworking single mom, loves her kids, carefree and easygoing, sort of the optimist. The whole idea behind the film for me was that sometimes your life starts leading you in a direction that you may not be accepting of but fighting that change sometimes just leads to heartbreak and disappointments. Instead swim with the tide and make waves as you go along, wherever that may lead to and you'll find that there's not just one direction to go in, there are many avenues to explore in life.

The sound was all over the place, including one scene that sounded like the actors were in an echo chamber. In another scene that ends with Hugh Grant wandering into an empty lecture hall that quickly starts to fill up with students, I fully expected the Allison Janey character to turn up as the lecturer and surprise Hugh Grant's character with some interesting insights into Jane Austen or something, but after a few seconds of watching the hall start to fill up the scene cut so abruptly that we thought the DVD had skipped or something! And, as other reviewers have  mentioned, the sound track music is so blah as to be almost cheesy. I loved the ensemble cast, except for the actors playing the students. It was like watching student actors, although perhaps that is just the fault of having one of every extreme student stereotype in the class. I normally can't stand Chris Elliot's characters, but he was so ""normal"" in this movie that I found it quite touching.",1428624000,,1219,4.75
6928209,3,B00RDCKLHA,"Living in Binghamton, I found it refreshing to see a kindly treatment of our city, even though much of the film was shot on Long Island. The story has been done better--think Elliott Gould in Getting Straight, for example--and Hugh Grant, as usual, plays Hugh Grant. Fortunately Marc Lawrence knows how to write a Hugh Grant character. If you live in Binghamton, see it; if you don't, don't bother.",1428537600,2,398,4.782608695652174
6928210,2,B00RDCKLHA,"Hugh Grant periodically threatens to quit acting. I hope he doesn't, but unless he can demonstrate a little more range than he has shown over the past decade or so, I wouldn't consider it a tragedy. He's still playing the immature, foot-constantly-in-mouth guy who responds to every challenge with banter and attempted charm. His success depends largely upon the quality of the dialogue he gets to utter, and in ""The Rewrite"", he is simply not that funny. It's an interesting idea for a film but they haven't been nearly as inventive as they could have been. None of the characters seem fresh at all---not Grant, and certainly not Alison Janney, who once again (as in LIBERAL ARTS and BAD WORDS) plays the humorless authority figure with a viperish tongue. J.K. Simmons' one bit is that whenever he talks about his beloved wife and daughter, he weeps. Chris Elliott is his usual nerd. Marisa Tomei is so lovely you give her more room, and she is charming, but it's an implausible role no one could pull off. If you've just come off a marathon binge of THE NEWSROOM, whose dialogue is rapid-fire and genuinely clever, the pleasantries and social badinage that purport to be wit in this film seem even more limp. You can't accept Hugh Grant's character as anything but clueless after he has to be told that his sleeping with a student is verboten. How could anyone in his fifties be so out of it? You end up not caring much if he manages to sell another script or keeps his job at the college. Nor do you care that much about his evolution into a dedicated teacher, because none of his students seem much interested in writing---except for one of the two male students, whose script gets accepted as a go project (Grant shepherds this) with the quickness with which one might order and receive a double latte at Starbucks. Oh, sure.

Hugh Grant might make a great bad guy, a really bad guy. Not someone who evolves from flawed to lovable, but a true rotter. He would not have been right for the Terrence Fletcher role that won Simmons a Best Supporting Oscar in WHIPLASH, but a role of that intensity might bring out depths in him we haven't seen. He's over fifty, and sooner or later the boyish crinkly-eyed smiley roles are going to look kind of silly. I hope he does branch out and become more of a character actor---the way that Pierce Brosnan has been doing in such films as THE TAILOR OF PANAMA, THE GHOST WRITER, and THE MATADOR. He was unafraid to be dislikable in those films, but suddenly he was a great actor. Imagine Hugh Grant as, say, a ruthless businessman---a British Gordon Gekko. Or a ruthless politician, like Kevin Spacey in HOUSE OF CARDS. Kevin Spacey's stock has shot straight up since he took on that role. Hugh Grant really needs to move outside his comfort zone. I hope he tries...",1428537600,7,2805,4.598802395209581

scenes and dialogues so watch out for that if you intend to watch it
with a smart youngster who can benefit from seeing certain struggle
and reality of the creative writer's career.
You would need to watch the movie first to red flag all the scenes
that are inappropriate and fast forward as appropriate.

Hugh Grant and Marisa Tomei are engaging enough as a washed-up screenwriter-turned-professor and his student, but ""The Rewrite's"" laughs are small and far between. I mean, why cast Chris Elliott as the buddy, if you're not going to let him go ""Something About Mary"" crazy?  I think, though, that the biggest flaw in this is the lack of a good soundtrack. There are long stretches when there's no music at all, and the lines fall flat without the musical punctuation. When there is music, it's boring and sounds as if the budget allowed for just a pianist and incidental music from the ""Music and Lyrics"" interludes.

6928226,5,B00RDCKLHA,"Hugh Grant, known for his many romantic comedies does some of his best work here.  He and Marisa Tomei along with J.K. Simmons score magnificently in this sophisticated comedy about a washed up Oscar winning screen writer forced to take a job teaching a writing class at an up state NY university.  Mr. Grant's Hollywood mind set gets him into fast trouble with the parochial thinking university staff.  In addition his students have other ideas about the illusion of Hollywood and how to approach writing in general.  If one could ever have a ""slacker instructor"", initially, Mr. Grant fits the description perfectly with hilarious results.

The screen play is very well written with the accompanying dialogue delivered superbly by the leading protagonists.  Please, note the viewer should be reasonably well educated since the humor does not revolve around juvenile body function jokes.  Many references are made to past giants of civilization's literary history.  The below the radar sexuality is welcome when compared to many of the ""jump into bed"" romantic comedies one sees today.  Mind you it is present, however the movie allows the viewer to imagine it's intensity rather than over the top bedroom scenes.  The same approach was done in 1930's and 40's romantic comedies.  The ""imagination"" of the viewer is the director's best friend.  Relationships between the players are slowly developed throughout the movie with surprising results.  This subtle development allows the viewer to become invested in the various actors and their particular circumstances.

It also seems unlikely that an ex-Marine would be an English professor (as is the case for one of the lead character's colleagues).  Yes, Marine's are certainly intelligent enough to do so, but it's an unlikely path for a military person.  With that said, this is a good movie.  Hugh Grant is quite credible as a washed up screen writer, particularly because he seems to have aged a bit and could be viewed as a washed up actor in real life, as in art imitating life.  So that aspect of the film seems all too real, which helps to off set some of the other unlikely elements.  Marissa Tomei is excellent.

I liked the beginning with the Google highlights of Binghamton, and the scenes where he drives in and shows some of the sights.  He captured the decay in those scenes, too.  When I was a kid, both IBM and GE (where my Dad worked) were major employers. Neither is there anymore so like a lot of small cities, Binghamton has rather fallen on hard times.
However, I was unhappy with some of the scenes.  Number 5 restaurant is actually in an old firehouse not a white building, though it is one of the premier restaurants in Binghamton.  The semester obviously starts in the fall, as you can see some of the fall foliage in the beginning.  But next is a green rainy season that is maybe supposed to be spring (could be May), and at the end it is suddenly summer, without the 5 months of alternating heavy snow, blizzards and muddy season that passes for winter and early spring in Binghamton.  In addition to being one of the 10 rainiest cities in the US, it is also one of the snowiest, and they skipped that completely. There never was a scene with bare trees!  besides, a semester would not begin in the fall and end in the spring!
But the worst offense was that the carousel in the movie was not any one of the 6 in the greater Binghamton area.  Because of the bad weather, 5 of the carousels are in buildings, and the 6th has a chain link fence around it.  I guess they don't photograph well from a distance, but I still think it is sad.  I expected that there would be a romantic carousel riding scene, but they skipped that, too.
The plot was mundane but I watched the movie for the scenes of my hometown.  From that viewpoint, I did enjoy the movie.  There were some really nice Binghamton scenes that I enjoyed.

Hugh Grant is known for his boyish good looks, casual charm, and dry sense of humor. Writer-director Marc Lawrence is known for casting him.

Thus far Grant has starred in four of Lawrences lightweight PG-13 comedies, and while Music and Lyrics remains the best of the bunchpartly because of the chemistry that Grant had with co-star Drew BarrymoreThe Rewrite is better than Two Weeks Notice and Did You Hear About the Morgans?

There are some genuinely funny moments in this comedy about an Oscar-winning writer who cant find work and quickly manages to upset the apple cart after arriving at SUNY-Binghamton to teach a screenwriting course as a visiting writer-in-residence.

Keith Michaels , a one-hit wonder known only for penning Paradise Misplaced, violates teaching ethics by bedding the apple polisher that flirts with him his very first night in upstate New York. He drinks too much at the classic wine-and-cheese faculty reception and insults their Jane Austen scholar (Allison Janney). He becomes the talk of the campus after selecting his students on the basis of their attractiveness rather than the strength of their screenplays. And he all but forces an easygoing department chair (J.K. Simmons) to reprimand him after he meets with his students for a total of five minutes and tells them to come back after a month, when theyve written a complete screenplay.

Michaels isn't quite at rock bottom, but he still needs to travel a pretty long character arc to reach a point of redemption. And thats what screenplays are all about.

The catalyst in his transformation is a plucky single mom (Marisa Tomei) who sees right through him but is determined to get his feedback on her manuscript in order to learn how to write a successful screenplay. Like non-traditional students in real life, she wants what knowledge the teacher has to give her, and if it takes giving him classroom prompts to get him talking, so be it.

Tomeis character rings true, but the others fall a little short. The faculty aren't nearly as overbearing and arrogant and quirky as they can be on many college campuses, and the students themselves aren't as distinctive as they could be. As a result, the classroom sequences fall short in the energy and joke departments, and that means it may not hold the interest of children in their early teens or younger. But other than Michaels waking in bed next to a student and their implied lovemaking, his drinking too much, and a students reference to weed, theres really nothing on-camera that kids cant see. The question is, would they want to watch? The Rewrite should provide a night of diversion for families with older children that love romantic comedies, but you have to love the genreor Hugh Grantto enjoy this one.

I won't go so far as to quip that the film needed another rewrite, but the classroom dynamic seemed off just enough to make you suspect that writer-director Lawrence could have made a good film very good with just a few more tweaks.

Language:  Cleaner than most PG-13 movies
Sex:  Only implied
Violence:  N/A
Adult situations:  drinking, mention of weed

6928268,3,B00RDCKLHA,"As a writer, I really wanted to love this movie. I saw the trailer and thought it looked fantastic. I will, however, say that my initial reaction to the trailer was that it looked like a formulaic ""rewrite"" of Music & Lyrics, just set in a literary genre instead of music.  But that didn't deter me. I loved Music & Lyrics and thought it was a great idea to do something like that in a topic that was close to home for me.

Unfortunately, I nearly fell asleep watching this movie -- twice. It has some good elements, but there was nothing really exciting or different. The premise was good, it just didn't have that ""thing"" about it that makes you fall in love.

Hugh Grant is basically the same stereotype underachiever here as he was in both Music & Lyrics and About A Boy. I didn't check to see if this film had the same writer and/or director as those two previous movies, but I'd be surprised if they didn't. I really like Hugh Grant, but he needs to be more lifelike at this stage of his career. He's become a little vanilla. I say this as a fan, so not intended to criticize. Mickey Blue Eyes was fantastic, as was Four Weddings and a Funeral. He's got what it takes. It's just that he seems to only know one tune anymore.

Marissa Tomei (sp) is always good, but she too lacked any real ""life"" in this film. There was just sort of this sustained calm that was neither fish nor fowl. I don't know that it was her acting (anymore than it might have been Hugh's), but it was disappointing.

Overall, I think there was a lot that could have been done with the characters and the plot to make it fire. It just didn't. I only give it 3 stars because I like Hugh and Marissa.",1425945600,4,1675,4.238244514106583

6928275,3,B00RDCKLHA,"Were it not for the utilization of Hugh Grant's considerable talents, this movie would be a flop. The script is lame, the dialog predictable, the characterizations paper-thin and riddled with clich, and the ""laughs"" suitable only for the most easily satisfied three-year-old. Seven minutes into the movie I accurately predicted every single plot development that subsequently followed, because this is very much a movie-by-the-numbers.

Despite all that, it's worth watching because Grant really is a superb actor. He's stuck in these rom-com roles despite being able to tackle far more diverse roles, but he always delivers a highly professional performance that saves the movie over and over again. Unlike Johnny Depp, who's become a self-caricature and nowadays seems to send in his performances over Skype, Grant is a consummate professional who never over-plays his hand. Yes, you've seen several of the tropes before: the self-deprecating humor delivered with eyes averted, the facial expression that conveys a thousand words in less than the beat of a heart, and the voice modulation that enables him to salvage even the most tired line of dialog. But it never feels stale or contrived, because Grant takes the trouble to fit his repertoire precisely to the needs of the moment.

One day, perhaps, Grant will be offered different roles in which he'll be able to expand well beyond the likeable English rogue stereotype. Until then, he'll continue to save truly dire movies through the force of his professionalism alone.",1425686400,2,1527,5.254098360655738

However, it's more about conversation than gimmicks to get attention.  At the same time, there are other subplots that could stand on their own.

Regarding women's roles: LOVED Allison Janney's self-righteousness, even though you also want to root for Hugh.  The love interest is Marisa Tomei.  She plays an intelligent woman who doesn't need sarcasm to prove her point.  Her expressions sometimes make you think her character deserves better than Hugh Grant's character.  It was a great contrast to the younger, immature college student who comes off as opportunistic, rather than the vulnerable/impressionable student she may play as her trump card to gain more leverage.",1424217600,27,848,5.094202898550725
6928316,4,B00RDCKLHA,"A LIGHT BUT ENJOYABLE COMEDY WITH A LITTLE MEANING BY THE END

It's true that for a comedy with writing central to it's theme, this story doesn't make a point of trying to go too deep with it's plot, nor with it's characters.  It's a very simple and lighthearted look at finding one's self again mid stream when life forces us to reinvent ourselves.  Calling it midlife crisis is a little clich and inaccurate because the protagonist is actually having a career crisis that just happens to be in his forties. Though there are various romances, I would also not call it a romantic comedy.  Keep in mind the main character will start out a little less than sympathetic and will need to find his way.  Despite the lighter character development in terms of background, they do have very interesting personalities and add a great deal of charm to the show.  I would even say families get a pretty good rap in this one as we get glimpses of real satisfaction.

THE PLOT (no spoilers):  Keith Michaels is a famous screen writer who has suffered career lag since his one great success.  This also seems to have placed pressure on his family as he is now estranged from even his son, who he loves.  In an act of desperation, he accepts a job teaching screenwriting at a university in the north east, a far cry from Los Angeles.  He has lost his swagger and seems to suffer from a terminal condition of putting his foot in his mouth and other parts in the wrong places. Though his class is star struck by his fame, he takes an attitude of just getting by as he does not intend to teach long.  He finds himself in conflict between the young student he has a sort of relationship with and a single mother Holly (Marisa Tomei) who convinces him to allow her attendance in his class.  Holly is similar to Keith in that mid life finds her needing to reinvent or find herself.  Unlike Keith, she still believes in pursuing her dreams while he has become jaded.  Further, Keith finds himself in a bit of a war with the influential female professor teaching Jane Austen literature.

OTHER THOUGHTS:  Some have been disappointed in this role for Hugh Grant but I thought his performance was very appropriate.  His swagger is a little faded, he is a little bedraggled, and completely believable for a star that has lost it's shine.  That is the point at the center of the problem.  He has that witty banter, as always, and the tte--tte with the female professor was pretty funny.  Some will find it unflatteringly misogynistic, but again, that is the point as he must transform.  The surrounding characters are barely fleshed out in some cases.  However, they each have such interesting quirks that I really enjoyed every one of them.  As the movie plods on, we begin to see in other relationships around him (as does he) what can bring real satisfaction.  I particularly enjoyed the former Marine Dr. Learner who is a real softy when it comes to his entire family of girls.  Clever little one liners and pithy comments made this movie ultimately worth it to me.  I also think that Marisa Tomei is perhaps her very best in simple roles as a hometown kind of gal.  She is very natural and likeable I thought.  I suggest a rental first as people will likely be very divided on this one.",1424217600,22,3264,4.5316239316239315
6928317,4,B00RDCKLHA,Really enjoyed this movie. You cannot go wrong with Marisa T.  Irony here is that Hugh Grant was in a Jane Austen movie.,1424217600,,120,4.217391304347826

It's more mature, as befitting Hugh Grant's age.  And, the main point of the movie is not romance, but really Hugh's character finding his purpose.  He is excellent as his usual charming, scoundrel-ly self, while a tad more serious than in most of his movies.  Marisa Tomei is also excellent, as is the rest of the cast, including J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney.  Definitely recommended.",1424131200,16,523,4.7555555555555555
6928320,4,B00RDCKLHA,"There are so many great lines, scenes, and relationships in this comedy with a bit of romance added for good measure, but more so an emotional maturity happening in front of you. Written and directed by Marc Lawrence the same director who also co-wrote ""Music and Lyrics"" in 1997 with Hugh Grant and together again the two have many more warm and successful moments that crackle with Grant's dry-witted sarcasm. I always enjoy movies such as this one, which is not so sure of itself at the outset then wonderful while finding its way. It is in this circumstance that Keith Michaels (Hugh Grant) runs parallel to the storyline. In ""Music and Lyrics"", Grant portrays a washed-up singer while here in ""The Rewrite"", he is a washed-up, Hollywood screenplay writer who has won an Oscar and now is unable to develop the sequel to his extremely famous and beloved film, ""Paradise Misplaced"". Perhaps an intriguing title?

Keith is about penniless and has to grab onto the first cash cow that comes along taking his agent, Ellen's (Caroline Aaron) advice to teach a college level course in screenwriting. He finds himself far superior and snobby for the subordinate position of a teacher stating, ""I don't believe anything worth knowing could be taught"". He takes off from across the country to Binghampton, NY. Surprisingly, this small town is also the home of many eccentricities. Keith is actually late showing up the morning of his first day which provokes the ire of Mary Weldon (Allison Janney). She is the English literature professor while being the head of the ethics committee and is personally obsessed with all things Jane Austen (do not say one single word about female empowerment with her in earshot). The Dean, Dr. Lerner (J.K. Simmons), hands him a box full of seventy, 30-page screenplays, and from these, he must choose only a certain number to make up his class. Keith finds a unique way to choose this class. He then approaches them on the first day telling them to write a screenplay and they will meet again. Now, Keith Michaels feels far too bored with it all.

At this point, he makes a crucial mistake while only focusing on himself. With the way he picked out his class, one may see it coming. There is also an older, single mother with children, positive and most inquiring student, Holly Carpenter (Marisa Tomei) who questions that mishap and begins to advise him on the direction he has taken, as she is a psychology major and taking his class, also. She adds a fresh perspective on the people in the class and also the mistake he did make while she remains somewhat judgmental but extremely helpful for her 'fish-out-of-water' teacher.  Now Keith must face resignation, losing his job or go in front of the ethics committee headed up by everyone's nemesis, Mary Weldon. Dr. Lerner adds to this just what may happen to Keith now... What could that mistake have been?

While Hugh Grant's character is in a closed-door conference on ethics with Allison Janney's character, several very comical situations arise depending on how you see it. For example; when 'Weldon' is almost done with her reprimand, she leans over her desk towards Keith and says, ""I bet you think I am an *Elinor"". For me, who loves Jane Austen so much myself, this statement had me laughing watching Janney's face trying to remain still. It really looked as if she wanted to laugh so badly.  Hugh Grant starred as 'Edward Ferrars' to Emma Thompson's 'Elinor Dashwood' in the movie ""Sense and Sensibility"", directed by Ang Lee from the novel by Jane Austen. The very funny 'hats off' to Austen while Keith appears to not know anything about this movie which Mary Weldon is even speaking of. If one did not know that he starred in this movie opposite 'Elinor', this point would surely be nondescript, meaningless and kept in her own personal Jane Austen World. At a point early in the film, Keith is looking online at his Oscar-winning screenplay acceptance speech. What is actually shown is a much younger Hugh Grant receiving the 'Golden Globe' for his film ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"". ""The Rewrite"" contains several moments concerning Keith taking a stance on the subject of teaching his students while being so arrogant by nature. Also, I completely adored this amazing supporting cast; J.K. Simmons, Allison Janney, Bella Heathcote, the quite funny, next-door neighbor - Chris Elliott and their influences on Keith's decisions.

""Paradise Misplaced""... Is the title of his first film just a coincidence or perhaps a mirror image of how Keith Michaels once appreciated his big shot life?",1424131200,50,4583,4.869230769230769
