8232640,3,B000YG6AFE,"Cigarette Burns was a very interesting film. A film collector wants a rare film of which there may not even be a copy. The initial showing of the film caused the audience to go into a homicidal rage. During the movie we get the idea that the movie is about and angel being killed and tortured and it was produced by Lou Cipher himself. The man hired to locate the film has his own baggage and needs the money. As he gets closer to the film he gets more involved in the evil that lays within. The movie was great up to the ending when we see glimpses of the evil film and its effect. At this point it becomes clear John Carpenter really didn't know how to end the movie and just winged it.

Dreams in a Witch House needed to be longer. We never got to know much about the characters. The plot involved a witch who lives in another dimension and has the ability to enter a specific room in a particular house due to the configuration of the slanted ceiling. She has a rat familiar with a human face and she can assume the shape of beautiful nude woman. A student who rents the room becomes tormented in his dreams which blend with reality.  While the movie is based on a Lovecraft book, the story has become second rate amidst all the horror that is out there.",1288915200,,1258,4.215767634854772
8232641,5,B000YG6AFE,"""Cigarette Burns"" and
""Dreams In The Witch House""
is a truly great double feature
of mind-numbing horror.

Warning: extremely nasty and creepy.
Do not watch if you are pregnant
or have a weak heart.

These are not sadism or mysteries
masquerading as horror,
but authentic horror, that is,
not only scary, but regarding
things that are out of this world
coming into this world in a most
unfriendly way.
No happy endings here,
other than total gratification
for the horror movie fan.

As of this review,
I have only seen three of the
Masters Of Horror film series,
these two and ""the Fair-Haired Child""
(also excellent).
If these films are representative,
then I am greatly looking forward
to seeing the rest of them. I think.

[I'll try ""Jenifer"" (Dario Argento!) next]

They are not only original and well-plotted,
they are brilliantly implemented as well.
Masters of horror indeed.
This series was a great idea.
The element of competition may have
brought out the best in the participants.

Note Bene: The musical score for both films
are excellent, particularly John Carpenter's
""Cigarette Burns"".

""Dreams In The Witch House"" is an excellent
adaptation of H.P Lovecraft's universe(s)
by Stuart Gordon (see ""Dagon"" for another;
you will not be disappointed).

Note bene II: This product description
describes a single disc with both films.
A 2-disc set is also available.",1218672000,3,1373,5.04424778761062
