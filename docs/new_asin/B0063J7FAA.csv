4941091,4,B0063J7FAA,"I bought set this to replace my VHS copy of ""Texasville"". I love this movie. It is a sequel to Bogdanovich's ""Last Picture Show"", and is perfect comic complement to the tragedy of the first movie. Whereas, the town was ready to roll-up and blow away at the end of ""Picture Show"", some 20 years later, the oil boom of the 70's has turned Anarene into a prosperous community once again, getting ready to celebrate their centenary. This movie is about surviving success as much as the first was about surviving failure. There are wonderful performances by Bridges, Cybill Sheppard, Cloris Leachman, Randy Quaid, Eileen Brennan and Timothy Bottoms reprising their original roles. Also notable is a standout appearance by Annie Potts as Duane's feisty wife Karla, mother to his unruly brood, and new best friend to Casey, Sheppard's character returned from self-imposed exile in Europe. The film turns around Duane's mid-life crisis and how he grudgingly manages to make sense of being a businessman, father, and civic leader. Trouble and temptation come at him from every corner. Sometimes just surviving is good enough.",1484611200,,1116,5.070652173913044

4941098,4,B0063J7FAA,"i found the movies to be quite pleasant. ""Stay Hungry"" and ""Wild Bill"" were the main reasons for this purchase both are difficult to find, but of course i found im very fond of a few others that were included in the collection.",1433980800,6,227,4.3023255813953485
4941099,4,B0063J7FAA,"Have not watched all movies yet, but so far so good. I really got this collection for Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, which is one of my favorites and it was an economically favorable alternative.",1412380800,3,191,4.818181818181818
4941100,3,B0063J7FAA,"Jeff Bridges is one of those actors who rises above the movies he stars in.  There are a few stinkers in this collection, Rancho Deluxe is a stupid attempt at film making that features Sam Watterson as a Native American cattle rustler teamed with Bridges.  It is as bad as it sounds.  Stay Hungry was one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's first movies and also starred Sally Field.  They aren't bad but the movie founders when one of the characters wearing the worst toupee ever flips out.  The cast of Body Builders enter the streets to save the city of Montgomery, Alabama by posing and flexing.  After watching this movie I knew the answer to the question, ""Why have I never heard of this movie?""  The reason I bought this thing was for Thunderbolt and Lightfoot and it was as good as I remember. Blown Away was an exciting film even though the plot is a little daft.  The Fabulous Baker Boys was good but the music isn't really the kind of stuff I don't like.  Wild Bill was a crazy treatment of the life of Wild Bill that didn't seem to have much to do with what actually happened.  Texasville was based on a book by Larry McMurtry that I really enjoyed but didn't translate well onto film.  To me it was the worst of Jeff's performances and I really disliked it.  The book was much better.  I think anyone who likes Jeff Bridges will probably enjoy this Movie Collection despite the clinkers.",1333929600,14,1391,4.472222222222222

8492079,5,B0063J7FAA,"Texasville is a classic Jeff Bridges film. I love how laid back he portraits the character. Totally different personality is the young wild thief in Thunderbolt and Lightfoot. Teaming up with Clint Eastwood and a great cast you cant help have a big hit movie. Then theirs Jeff the cop in Blown  Away. All different sides of Jeff and his ability to act so many diverse characters makes him one of the great actors in my book. But wait you still have 4 more films to go. Rancho deluxe, stay hungry and Wild Bill I'm looking forward to watching. That leaves us the fabulous baker boys. Michelle Pfeiffer. I said enough right there. Enjoy.",1522713600,,635,4.5701754385964914

8492081,5,B0063J7FAA,"I'm giving this collection five stars, mainly for two reasons. Jeff Bridges has always been one of my favorite actors, ever since I first saw him in The Last Picture Show. What was an unlikeable character in the book, Jeff made Duane likable in the film version. He has an easygoing charm, and it has made him a star over the years. My favorite film is The Last Picture Show and I bought this collection mainly for Texasville, a sequel to the earlier film and it was fascinating to see the actors aged twenty years. Whereas the first film was mostly Timothy Bottoms' film, the sequel was Jeff's story. I tried to find the stand alone DVD of Texasville, but the collection was less expensive. I also loved The Fabulous Baker Boys and Stay Hungry so buying the collection was more than worthwhile.",1518825600,,795,4.566433566433567
