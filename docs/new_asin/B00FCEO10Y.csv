5975277,5,B00FCEO10Y,"The Drive Thru History videos are excellent!  My kids (age 7 and 5), my husband and I have learned a lot by watching this video series.  The host, Dave Stotts, does an excellent job of making history come alive with his unique storytelling technique and taking viewers where the historical events occurred.  He also has a silly sense of humor that kids (and parents!) will enjoy.",1426636800,2,379,4.712121212121212

5975283,5,B00FCEO10Y,"These are a fun, and truthful way to learn about history.  Dave Stotts is interesting and funny as he relates important historical information--much that is not commonly taught--in an engaging way that my whole family loves.  He has just enough silly humor (sometimes gross) that my boys absolutely love it, but it doesn't turn the rest of us off.  I highly recommend this series for anyone who loves, or wants to love, history.",1388707200,11,428,4.835616438356165

8614442,4,B00FCEO10Y,We are enjoying this in our homeschool as a fun beginning framework for our study of American History. It is fun to watch and very fast paced. The kids usually have one or two things in each episode that they want to know more about and so they start researching on their own. I always love when that happens. :),1456358400,2,312,4.216666666666667
