8036091,4,B00049QLP0,"If you liked GT - the ""Lost Episodes"" are essential since they are the original first 16 episodes that subsequently were cut from the series and don't appear in the box set collection. GT is no Z or Super, but I found it enjoyable - a bit goofy at time like the original Dragonball, and the fighting scenes are certainly lacking, but I still like it, so sue me!",1525910400,,361,4.246376811594203
