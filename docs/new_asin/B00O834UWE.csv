8682437,5,B00O834UWE,"'One-man shows' are pretty unrelenting on the actors who perform in them. This is especially the case here, with the most minimalist staging imaginable (a costume, a couple of props...). But Vera Filatova performs brilliantly, gripping the audience's attention from her first appearance on stage right through to the very end. The minimalist staging works extremely well in this respect: the audience is left to focus on a performance that in vocal intonation, facial expression, and body movement forms a perfect unity with Dostoevsky's unsettling story. The denouement (though perhaps expected for those even vaguely familiar with Dostoevsky) captures brilliantly, thanks to the direction and staging, but primarily thanks to Filatova's great performance, the truly uncanny nature of Dostoevsky's work. Very, very highly recommended viewing.",1430352000,,843,5.752
