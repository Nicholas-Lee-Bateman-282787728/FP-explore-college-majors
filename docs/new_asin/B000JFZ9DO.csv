I would've liked even more info from the guy's perspective, and any pointers on lifting the female with greater ease (though he does offer suggestions, I was aware of many them already! Perhaps they're not as secret as they seem?). The video has the most basic lifts, pirouettes, and promenades (think shoulder sit, basic finger pirouettes, etc). I'm glad I bought this.",1343606400,,476,4.888888888888889
8150285,1,B000JFZ9DO,"I Received one DVD, which didn't work - well that can happen.
I called Amazon and requested a new one.
They sent it to a wrong address and it was DELIVERED accordingly to Amazon.
Well not to me, and not to my address ...

Well amazon wasn't afraid - to charge me for the 2nd CD i never even received.
So now I have 1 CD which deosn;t work, 2nd which is somewhere in Ft Lauderdale ... and I have been charged for 2 CDs

WAY TO GO AMAZON :(",1263168000,,438,3.8555555555555556
8150286,5,B000JFZ9DO,"Dmitri Roudnev is a wonderful ballet teacher and dancer(formerly of the Bolshoi) and a great credit to the ballet community, much to the benefit of the Chicago area. This video gives you much of the basic ideas on partnering for reference as an adjunct to partnering classes. Tips are given for both the male and female dancer. Mr. Roudnev is very active in his videos and does plenty of explaining, so you are not just watching people dance as in some other instructional videos. The image and sound are very good also. All his videos and cds are highly recommended.",1161216000,5,567,4.68
