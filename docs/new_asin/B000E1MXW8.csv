2480050,1,B000E1MXW8,"This ""Best Of"" (yeah right) Night Court DVD is subpar in all respects. For one, I want the full seasons rather than a compilation like this, and secondly, the selection of the episodes on this DVD downright sucks (they only have the first two episodes the ""Her Honor"" four-parter). Here's what the suits say are the ""best"" that Night Court had to offer:

1.) ""All You Need is Love"" (which we already have UNCUT on the Season 1 DVD)
2.) ""Her Honor, pt 1""
3.) ""Her Honor, pt 2""
4.) ""Death of a Bailiff""
5.) ""Who Was that Mashed Man""
6.) ""Fire""

Also, it must be made known that the episodes on this compilation DVD are the cut-all-to-hell episodes shown in syndication. Spread the word so we don't get shafted like this again.",1136419200,17,724,4.43609022556391

Everyone knows that the better, more memorable episodes occured after the first season. Why couldn't Warner Bros just come out with Season 2, and consider what they should do from those sales? I'm sure all Night Court fans are as disgusted as I am to see such horrible treatment being done to such a classic. Anyone who feels the same should give a 1 star for this dvd with a review explaination that we want a SEASON 2 DVD set!!!!!

2480077,5,B000E1MXW8,"These are funny episodes, but not the funniest.  I definitely would've chosen different ones for a best of compilation of Night Court, like the competing judge episode, the time crunch episodes, the game show episode, etc.  But this is good, since season 1 didn't get enough sales to warrant a season 2.  But if this sells well enough eventually, maybe there'll be a season 2.  One episode is on the first season dvd and they unnecessarily put two parts of a three part episode arc on there.  Anyway, still a good collection of episodes",1215820800,3,536,4.659574468085107
2480078,1,B000E1MXW8,"I have the first season of the Night Court collection.  The reason I have it is because there are a lot of episodes I may have missed when it first aired and so on.  Season two is when I started paying attention, even more so when Christine came into the picture (not sure which season that was.)  Hell, she still looks good last I saw her in ""There's Something About Mary,""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/There-s-Something-More-About-Mary-Widescreen-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00008DDGU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">There's Something More About Mary (Widescreen Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;but never mind.

WOWWWWWWW!  What first season of any collection has ever been as good as the later episodes?  Of course poor sales will become the weakest part of a lot of collections when the shows first started.  Check this, the people that collect any TV show DVD will want the first seasons of a collection, regardless of its strength because they are fans.  Happy to know it exists, they await the season they look forward to and come back to get the first season for their collection (some people don't purchase in order, they purchase their favorites first.)  I can't think of an example right now, maybe someone reading this review can help with that if they agree, but if Warner continues to focus on sales of the first seasons of different shows, we may continue to see these ""incomplete collections"" dubbed TV Favorites that people will not buy because they feel cheated waiting for the real deal, like Me!  I know what's happening and I'm not going for it because WB's just taking the easy way out.  By that, I mean not even getting the fan's POV and not taking the time and effort to reach it's public to get the sales they need to sell season one.  Sometimes a commercial isn't enough, maybe not package them as a season-by-season basis.  A box-set of all the seasons would be cool because at least it could be on a limited edition type deal with extras included (I think they did that with ""Friends""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friends-The-Complete-Series-Collection/dp/B000H6SXMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friends - The Complete Series Collection</a>&nbsp;and several others.)  Amazonworld, keep writing your reviews and make it known that it is important to finish something that you start, especially the classics that we've waited to own for decades!

2480079,3,B000E1MXW8,"I have been a huge fan of the Night Court series since the beginning. The quirky characters, the outrageous situations and bizarre courtroom antics made this show tops in my book. Unfortunately, this DVD barely scraped the surface. The Her Honor episodes were in 4 parts not 2, and I personally could have found better episodes for this DVD. It's fine for the casual fan but a die hard fan like myself would like more. What's it going to take for Warner Bros. to put out more Night Court?",1202428800,,488,4.49438202247191
2480080,1,B000E1MXW8,"Personally I think that Season 1 would have sold a lot better if TV Land or other channel had been showing re-runs. There's a whole generation that has missed out on this great show. When you look at which shows are released they're usually those that are still being re-run. Chico and the Man is another wonderful series that they're mistreating by putting out a pitiful collection instead of the series.

That being said, no WAY am I buying this poor substitute. We want SEASON 2!",1182297600,,482,4.604651162790698
2480081,2,B000E1MXW8,"There are two parts to my review - an informative portion, and then a rant. First, the informative portion:
There are only six episodes on this DVD:

All You Need is Love - Season 1 (January 4, 1984)
Her Honor, Part 1 - Season 4 (aired April 29, 1987)
Her Honor, Part 2 - Season 4 (aired May 6, 1987)
Death of a Bailiff - Season 5 (aired October 15, 1987)
Who Was that Mashed Man? - Season 5 (aired November 19, 1987)
Fire - Season 6 (aired November 2, 1988)

""All You Need is Love"" was the series premiere and is redundant if you already own season one, the only season of Night court on DVD.

""Her Honor"" was actually a 4-part episode that spanned the fourth and fifth seasons. In these episodes, Harry is not reappointed to his judgeship and Christine is given the opportunity to be appointed instead. This is an odd choice since you only get the the first two episodes of the 4-parter, but not the resolution of the entire situation.

""Death of a Bailiff"" has Bull being struck by lightning and surviving. When he recovers he says that God has told him to give away everything he owns. Bull sets up shop in the courthouse and proceeds to follow his divine directive.

""Who Was that Mashed Man?"" has Dan's evil boss tasking Dan to look after his attractive niece. The other subplot has Harry having to rule against an actor who used to portray a superhero who wants to be able to dress up as his character in public. As a result, the actor becomes suicidally despondent and Harry must try to talk the old actor into wanting to keep on living.

""Fire"" has everyone retreating to the morgue for shelter from a fire in the courthouse. Meanwhile, Dan is awaiting the election returns to find out if he has been successful in his bid for State Assemblyman.

If you're young enough to have never seen Night Court before, it might be worth the low price of admission to purchase this, but if you are at all familiar with the series I think this compilation is a waste of time. It is too small a dose of the show and the episodes are not the very best of the series.

Now for the ranting portion of my review. Warner Brothers has shown tremendous insight into what audiences want with their DVD's and boxed sets of classic movies over the last five years. That's why I can't figure out why they don't have the same insight when it comes to one of the most original and timelessly funny shows ever aired. Unfortunately, it took time for Night Court to reach its ""classic phase"", which really didn't start until the beginning of season three in 1985 when Markie Post began playing public defender Christine Sullivan, and ended in 1989 when creator Reinhold Weege left the series. Those four seasons were just about perfect, but that is not to say that the other five were turkeys by any stretch, and I think the show remained very funny up to the end in spite of a few misfires. However, season one was the weakest of all the seasons with the weakest cast - Mac wasn't even the court clerk back then - as the series struggled to find its way. So, naturally, sales of season one are going to be weak too. The attitude WB has taken with Night Court would be the same as if they had started their release of classic movies to DVD with the obscure ""Ice Follies of 1939"", and when sales were weak assumed that it would be a waste of time to restore and release ""Casablanca"" or ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"". I know this is an exaggeration, but the logic is the same in both cases.

WB should release the subsequent seasons of Night Court. I guarantee that fans like myself that had a standing date with my TV to watch the show every week will yield a return on the studio's investment.",1181952000,7,3678,4.373352855051245
2480082,3,B000E1MXW8,"Night Court was one the most memorable shows on NBC in the 80's. In my opinion, this is an okay sampling of two or three seasons of the show. This is not a perfect compliation because there seems to be a ""Her Honor part 3 that's not here. Her Honor pt 3 was when judge Harry T. Stone had working on a prank involving the Statue of Liberty in his apartment. With the time span of the series there is no way to put all of the best episodes on a single DVD. It will be very nice when WB releases all of the other seasons.",1175731200,,518,3.8962264150943398
2480083,2,B000E1MXW8,"I love the Night Court series and enjoyed the episodes on the DVD however, there was a three part episode of night court and only two parts were on the DVD.

2480101,5,B000E1MXW8,"Can somebody please explain to me why a major coporation like Warner Brothers does not use on-demand technology? Instead of printing 10,000 copies upfront, Warner Brothers could allow people to order the DVD over the internet and manufacture them later. That way, everybody who loves Night Court could get what they want, and the incompentent managemet at Warner Brothers can pretend they really care about consumers and shareholders.",1168041600,5,434,5.397058823529412

The comedy was the best.  The slap-stick comedy was unique.  My hope is that we will be able to purchase every season of this great series.  I own the first season, but the other seasons down the line are just as great, if not better.  Quality sit-com and has got to be the funniest ever!!!!",1163289600,8,464,4.264367816091954

If we buy this DVD, they will think that it is a great sell and then make more ""Best of Night Court"" DVDs.  If we boycott this DVD, they will think that we don't like Night Court.  What gives???",1157846400,,320,4.19672131147541
2480108,4,B000E1MXW8,"First things first, I am a fan of ""Night Court"", but I'll be the first one to admit that this show really didn't come alive until season four when everyone got into place.  Even creator Reinhold Weege admitted that.  There are moments that I do love within those first three seasons, and it's a shame that the late Selma Diamond was only able to shine her comic brilliance for only two seasons.

Let's be honest here though, the reason season one's numbers weren't too high is because it wasn't yet what it came to be (I hope that makes sense).  In case you were wondering, I did purchase a copy of the compilation.  I can't think of a better way to rate something unless I see it.  Also, why the hell would anyone want to boycott this DVD?  1) To boycott it would surely spell the end of a season two release, 2) It's still ""Night Court"", regardless of the season, you'll still get laughs from it and enjoy it.

OK, OK, so the company picked out what THEY thought were the best shows.  Well guess what, I thought they were pretty damn good.  It included the pilot, which ya gotta have, uncut mind you. These episodes were not the syndicated versions.

It may not the best compliation, & it may not be the favorite compilation.  Right now though, it's the best way to enjoy a show when it finally hit its mark & started its way to become a classic show.  That's my take on it, and I'm sticking to it.",1155772800,4,1400,4.297709923664122
2480109,4,B000E1MXW8,"You'd think that the fact that Night Court was on for nine seasons would be reason enough to release all subsequent seasons.  It's no big secret that the first season was not a huge success, why should the DVD?  I bought it anyway because I like Night Court that much.

Then they put out this compilation DVD which also included the pilot episode, and  (if that wasn't insult enough) the first half of ""Her Honor"", a very good episode; but omitted the last half.  It was a four-part cliffhanger.  The person - or persons - in charge of putting this DVD together must suffer from memory loss and/or attention deficit disorder.

Anyway, excluding the pilot, they had good episodes on the DVD (5 stars), but they should have been more thoughtful about what to put on it (3 stars).  This is the reason for my 4-star rating.

I only hope Warner Bros. will wise up.",1154736000,4,859,4.490322580645161

2480113,4,B000E1MXW8,"How can one write an objective review about a product without even seeing or purchasing it?  That's what most of the reviewers here at Amazon for Warner's Television Favorites DVD of ""Night Court"" have attempted to do . . . they are simply expressing their displeasure for Warner's release of this sampler DVD (which most admit they wouldn't buy) over full season sets, rather than actually reviewing the DVD.  Incidentally, none of the other ""Television Favorites"" sampler DVDs released by Warner have received these overwhelmingly negative ratings at Amazon.  In the case of two of them, ""F-Troop"" and ""Cheyenne,"" sales of the samplers have resulted in planned season 1 releases by Warner Home Video for June 2006.

Let's take a look at this DVD and review it on its own merits.  The video presentation on the DVD is pretty much what you would expect for a series recorded on videotape from the 1980s . . . reasonably sharp, but certainly not up to the high definition standards of modern sitcoms.  Overall, the audio/video presentation is fairly solid throughout and fans of the show will not be disappointed in that aspect.  There are six episodes in this collection, not five as a few reviewers have indicated.  Some other reviews have also suggested that these are cut, syndicated episodes.  Again, that's not the case; episodes average around 23 and a half to about 24 minutes . . . the correct running times for a half-hour television series that began broadcasts in the mid-1980s.

Is this a perfect DVD?  No, it's not and, like many, I would prefer seeing full season releases for television series that are released on DVD.  The DVD is a ""bare bones"" affair; there are no extras included, unlike the season 1 release which included a documentary about the show and series creator Reinhold Weege's commentary on the pilot episode.  This DVD drops the Weege commentary on the pilot, the only episode that's repeated from the season 1 release; the other episodes are from seasons 4, 5, and 6.  On the plus side, English, French and Spanish subtitles are offered.  On balance, it's a fun little collection that offers a few evenings of enjoyable comedy and, if full season sets are not released by Warner Home Video in the future, those who have this DVD will be able to enjoy some episodes beyond the first season.  Finally, if you want another independent review of this DVD by someone who has actually seen it, visit Sitcomsonline.com where the reviewer gave this DVD a four star (out of five) rating; I concur.",1142294400,14,2521,4.814385150812065

Over a year later and still nothing!! This favorites compilation is what I consider a slap in the face of every Night Court fan!! WBTV needs to get a clue and figure out what fans want.

But in this world of facelifts, water-balloon boobs, and hair removal electrolysis, nobody has to wrack their brain to try to figure out why Reality TV trash like the The Simple Life and Boy Meets Boy get released in full before sitcom classics like Night Court do. It's all about image and phoniness. Instead of caring about quality shows like Night Court, the masses have somehow found solace in disgustingly trendy and shallow sitcoms like Friends, and continue to drool over the bottom-feeder fodder that is reality TV.

So, next time you're watching Nip/Tuck fawning over the guy who just got his cleft palette fixed, ask yourselves this: Could plastic surgery ever give a man the natural hotness quotient that Dan Fielding possessed? Obviously not. I rest my case.

Give us more Night Court seasons!",1138752000,12,970,4.9447852760736195
2480213,1,B000E1MXW8,"Warner Bros. You are a joke if you think that you can offer us this lame (TV Favorites Compiation) and expect us long suffering Night Court Fans from around the world to jump for JOY.

You have know idea how long we have been waiting for Night Court to come out on DVD and to have Season One released was magic.

But to offer us this Compilation instead of Season Two is an Insult to all the Night Court fans worldwide, did the Warner Bros. Executive that picked these so called favorites actually see all 193 Episodes, because in my opinion these aren't the best ones I would have picked.

Season One was a little slow but with the entry of Christine to the show it gave show more life and Dan's character became more enjoyable with every episode.

So like a good Red Wine this Show only gets better with time.

So I urge all Night Court Fans all over the world to give this Compilation a miss and I Pray that Warner Bros. have a Heart and give us all the other Seasons in Uncut Format.",1138406400,19,987,4.2287234042553195
2480214,1,B000E1MXW8,"There's a rumour that Warner will supposedly release the full uncut Season 2 if this poor excuse for a sitcom DVD sells well. To that, I say ""bullsh*t"". If Warner was planning on releasing Season 2, they would have done it already instead of putting out this compilation to test the waters. Warner's second-guessing is quite confusing to say the least; the Season 1 DVD sales prove we're rabid for more full Night Court seasons. And as for the content of this DVD, I must say the selection was careless and sloppy to say the least. What's the reason behind including the pilot when we already have it on the Season 1 DVD? Why are parts 3 and 4 of 'Her Honor' omitted? Who the hell was in charge of compiling this DVD? Heck, even the DVD cover art bad; it's just another generic cast publicity shot we've seen a million times.",1138320000,13,825,4.434210526315789

2480217,4,B000E1MXW8,"While the studio hasn't officially announced season two yet, they are prepping it for later in 2006. The reasons behind this set are first - to get people who might not buy a season set. Second - they wanted to get a few Markie Post episodes out there. Since she only has one episode in season two, and doesn't become a regular until season three... Warner decided to push a few of her episodes on this compilation. A decent set, even if it does repeat the pilot episode from the Season One box.",1137888000,8,495,4.333333333333333

2480221,1,B000E1MXW8,First let me say I am a huge Night Court fan. However I agree with everyone on here it is pathetic to cash in like this. Warner Brothers must have brains the size of peanuts to think people are gonna buy this. I mean I waited months for season two and am not pleased to find out this is what they are offering instead. Maybe they should look at all the reviews on here and other sites to realize the fans ain't buying so I will not buy this Warner can stick this DVD were the sun don't shine for all I care.,1137715200,6,507,3.9320388349514563

2480233,1,B000E1MXW8,"I can't add much to what has already been written. Night Court is probably my favorite comedy series. The first season was probably the weakest, but still fun. I would buy every season if they were released. This five show disk certainly doesn't have the five best shows and I won't dignify Warner's lack of foresight by buying it. I certainly hope the company will release the remaining series. Certainly the cost is minimal.",1137369600,8,426,4.77027027027027
2480234,2,B000E1MXW8,"I must admit that the ones listed are not the ones I would pick as favorites.  That is why it has only 2 stars.  The episode with Dan saving Christine's life and asking for a payback price would have made my favorites list.  I still feel that this show is one of the funniest shows ever on television.

I can see from most of the reviews that people would prefer season sets.  I too would like season sets as I really like the show.  However I will take what I can get.  From what I have seen on web sites, the company was disappointed with sales of season 1.  If this compilation doesn't sell well then there may never be any more seasons.  So don't boycott this DVD use sales of it to tell the company that we like Night Court and want the rest of the season sets.",1137024000,3,766,4.087248322147651

2480238,1,B000E1MXW8,Warner has already released the 1st season back in Feb. 05 now there's a best of disc. Why not just continue with the seasons? I can see the studio releasing a best of compilation before the season sets are released but not after. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SEASON TWO.,1136678400,12,262,4.36734693877551
2480239,1,B000E1MXW8,"This disc represents a scary and disturbing possibility:  That Warner Bros. is brushing off releasing the rest of the seasons of ""Night Court"" in favor of offering this poorly selected group of episodes as a kind of ""peace offering.""  I've even heard that these are not even the original NBC broadcast versions, but rather the edited syndication versions.  I've never known Warner to release anything other than uncut episodes of a TV show before.  But, I know there is always that possibility, since other publishers have certainly done it already.  The REALLY scary part of it is just this:  If this disc performs poorly, it very well could be the final nail in the coffin of the hope of any more uncut season sets to be released.  BUT, how can Warner Bros. realistically expect true fans of the show to buy such an inferior product as this?  It's no secret that we are all craving the full season sets in uncut format.  If Warner feels that the first season set did not sell enough copies, then here's a good idea:  Get more copies of the set available at retailers!  When the season one set first became available, I noticed that a lot of the stores around here did not even have it!  Those that did soon sold out, but almost all of them never restocked it!  It seems to me that since the first shipment sold well and quickly, more shipments should have followed.  But the slots that had been occupied by ""Night Court"" were then filled by something else, and it never seemed to show up again.  It's almost like it got lost in the shuffle of a continually changing store lineup of available titles.  I sincerely believe that it would have done much better if given the chance.

Even though buying this disc might send a message to Warner that ""Night Court"" is not dead, I can't bring myself to support this lackluster offering.  We all have to take a stand and send a message to Warner that this disc belongs in the garbage by NOT buying it.  Let's all appeal to them via e-mail or snail mail to resume complete season sets of the original NBC versions.  There is no doubt in my mind that season two would be gobbled up immediately.  All they would have to do is put it out there, and give it better exposure than season one.  We would DEFINITELY take care of the rest.",1136592000,26,2272,4.463592233009709
