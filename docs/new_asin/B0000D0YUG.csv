8000160,5,B0000D0YUG,"Architectures Volume 1, the DVD of modern art, a departure from Classical Art, Renaissance Art, and Neo-Classical Art. This is a new period in art with men who are turning to new forms and designs in architecture. In art, it is difficult to start or create news techniques and styles. Art forms are embedded in cultures with symbols, and many people will continue to be loyal to the historical art forms while others will risk their reputations trying new forms of art.

There was a period when sculpture and architecture were in the same department, however,there was a separation of the two schools of art.

The DVD highlights six artists that departed from the old techniques and started new architectural forms. Bauhous started an Academy of Art in Germany creating structures to house art and technical students. The teachers were housed in separate quarters. Many of the teachers are famous in their own rights. The Bauhaus structures were geometric in design and they were filled with light.

The Vienna Saving Bank by Otis Wagner was a departure from the old school of design, he tried new techniques using cement with marble and granite overlays to save time and expense.

La Centre Georges Pompidou, an extreme structural building in Paris, but now it has more vistors than any other structure in Paris.

This video is excellent because of the narrative, history and photography.

Comes in three different languages (French - spoken, and German and English - voice-overs and subtitles).  Some of the verbage is a bit over the top and grandiose, but the coverage of the different architectural examples is always excellent.  Where they can, they include interviews with the architect; always show work drawings and detailed graphical diagrams; always show detailed examples of current life within the results, along with honest discussion of some of the practical problems encountered during design, construction, and maintenance.

The only thing you could wish for is coverage of more examples.  Even with five different volumes (be aware there are actually six) with coverage of six designs per volume, a hard core architecture junkie would have several hundred (thousand) more examples for the list.  In addition, they were smart enough to let each design speak for itself.  For example with Walter Gropius, you can see why Bauhaus does/does not work for you, without the usual lecture on why you should/should not worship at that particular altar.

All of that is the good news.  Bad news is availability in the U.S.  Where available, the series is incredibly expensive.  But, it turns out that it can be had from the French government.  --ht tp://w ww.boutiquesdemusees.fr has it and ships to the U.S.  My total price for all six (vol 6 seems to have never been broadcast and is usually not in the boxed set) with shipping came to $150 U.S.  That will vary depending on currency rates.  Shipping time from Frogistan to Colorado was about a week at their cheap rate.",1242172800,9,1748,5.017361111111111
8000162,5,B0000D0YUG,"An excellent assortment of buildings is highlighted on this disk, and though the architecture is beautiful what truly makes these disks worthwhile is how the filmakers place the architecture in its society and elaborate on the building's role in it.  Architecture's social, political, and aesthetic aspects are all touched upon in these vignettes, providing one with a unique view of the structures.  These videos are better than some books, even, not only in their depth but also because through film one gets a unique view of the building and how it ""lives"" in its environment.  Very informative, always beautifully shot, the ""Architectures"" series is a thought-provoking addition to any architectural library.",1140480000,31,712,5.396396396396397
