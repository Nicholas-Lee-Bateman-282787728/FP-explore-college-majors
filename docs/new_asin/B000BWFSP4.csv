2443529,4,B000BWFSP4,"Sometimes just a movie star , sometimes a great actor . Where it ends the inner world, where it starts the outer world? This documentary doesn't give you an answer, because both worlds are absolutely mixed in only one. Shahrukh lives for his people and by his people . Very intense ( the actor ), very emotional ( the movie star ) . An unlimited marketeer .. with a glimpse of social commitment. Always Rahul or sometimes Mohan ? In the end is just only Shahrukh Khan.",1193184000,6,468,4.390804597701149
2443530,5,B000BWFSP4,"`The Inner/Outer World of Shah Rukh Khan' is an absolutely magnificent 2 disc DVD set taking the viewer up close and personal with the worlds greatest movie star.

Disc 1 ~ The Inner World: Travel with Shah Rukh in and around the streets of New Deli visiting his home, meeting his wife Gauri and children, the Catholic school he attended and his parents gravesite. This disc provides an insightful and intimate glimpse into the everyday world of Bollywoods' biggest star.

Disc 2 ~ The Outer World: A documentary chronicling Shah Rukh's '04 tour to the U.K. and America. Again as in the first disc Shah Rukh is surprisingly open about his life, fears and aspirations. Hang out backstage with the performers and see what goes into putting on a successful road production.

The most incredible thing about these DVD's is the fact that they're in English! I'm not sure but I'd guess these two documentaries were produced for the American and British audience, so no subtitles to deal with. This set comes in a sturdy foldout cardboard case with a booklet included. A MUST OWN for every Shah Rukh Khan fan!!

P.S.: These two documentaries were also released in a single DVD edition containing the same programs in their entirety, all on one disc and instead of a cardboard foldout case it comes in the regular plastic snap case. There's no booklet in this one. If you have a preference check seller information before ordering.",1166832000,19,1423,4.795918367346939

2443535,5,B000BWFSP4,"I am so glad I bought this 2 DVD set. I feel like I learned so much about his life behind the scenes. To watch him go about his daily life, see him rehearse on movie set and spend time with his children and family. It is a treasure for any Shah Rukh Khan fan. And on the 2nd DVD to watch him on tour backstage and in his car in different parts of the USA. It's just a must have. I really enjoy watching it. Shah Rukh is truly an amazing man.",1381708800,,441,3.752688172043011

2443540,3,B000BWFSP4,"Made in 2005, the discs are an attempt to humanize megastar Shahrukh. They could have been an attempt at self promotion because Red Chilli produced the movie but Shahrukh claims that it had bought the rights after this documentary was made ( Well, whatever)
These discs reveal Shahrukh's innermost ( almost) feelings and relationships with his family, friends, fans and God. It comes as two DVDS, the disc one is the inner world and the disc 2 the outer world. The disc one shows us Shahrukh as the father, brother and a friend, although these relationships are only explored very minimally. We still get to see a peek of his sister, his house, his kids, his wife and his office. I thought the highlights was the birthday party on the sets of ' Main Hoon Na ', his visit to the graves of his parents, his return to his school and meeting with old teachers.
The second disc is the Outer World which captures the Temptations Tour of the UK and USA. Some highlights include snippets from the concerts themselves. He is joined by a number of famous faces such as Saif Ali Khan, Arjun Rampal, Rani Mukherjee,and the then not-so-famous Priyanka Chopra. The moment of interest for me was the random meeting with Aamir Khan at one of the concerts, still sporting the long locks and moustache he had grown for Mangal Panday. I thought that the discs were okay and a bird's eye view of Khan. I preferred watching the recent Living with a Superstar on the Discovery Channel.

2443541,4,B000BWFSP4,"Despite the over-the-top packaging, this DVD set is a great, inside look at Shah Rukh Khan's life as well as a look inside the workings of Indian cinema.",1243555200,,153,4.5
2443542,5,B000BWFSP4,"Is it possible to know a star from his films?  Interviews?  Promotional appearances?  Photos?  Award shows?  Little by little we can make a hobby of trying to piece him together.  Back pain for a man who makes a living throwing his body into exhuberant dances, leaps, bends... love of family privacy for a man who shares himself with so many others so much of the time. This is an actor who continues to reach for new venues, new styles, new promotional opportunities, and even new talents as he reaches into team ownership and singing!  This video takes us closer to some of the many layers of Shahrukh Khan's personality - and it is an enjoyable foray.  On an interview a few years ago, tired from a long shoot and perturbed by the interviewer, he asked what the interviewer wanted him to say - reminding us that he can say one thing in one interview and contradict himself in the next...In this video he, himself, says that more and more he has a public persona and a private one, and he needs to keep reminding himself which he is supposed to show, when. Although I devoured this video like a paparrazzi devours a photo op, I still only have a hint of what, in the final analysis, SRK wanted to show...on a few particular days, a couple of years ago... Who is the real man?  Who knows.  Maybe he doesn't even know.  Cheers!",1208649600,10,1327,4.4421487603305785

8093496,5,B000BWFSP4,"Shah Ruhk Khan is my number one favorite Bollywood actors.  He is talented, versatile, entertain-able, shy and sexy to boot.  The characters he portrays are fantastic because you can relate to them and to the situations that are plotted in these movies; and most times you also can a dose of wittiness.  I would recommend them as family entertainment.  I can honestly say that 90% of films where Shah Ruhk Khan is acting can be seen by the whole family including children of all ages.",1397692800,3,484,4.658823529411765

8093498,5,B000BWFSP4,"This is a bird's eye view of the man with a billion fans. Its personal since the camera keeps you face to face with him for a week.
Whether he's acting, interacting, starring, or sharing personal feelings, he shows sincerity when he communicates. I wanted to see how different he was in different environments and for all he thinks he's got split personalities, he's got a very strong core of  passionate feelings about discovering who people are and how he responds to them. He is an explorer in more than just his own world. He does care one on one and one on 20 thousand. I enjoyed a whirlwind tour of his live performances in the U.S. I think his fans are also very special. Every age known to man comes to experience Shah Rukh LIVE.  It helps to be insanely handsome and still humble enough to confess his mood swings and his lonely relationship with cigarettes. Who would know if he didn't feel like confiding what makes him human ?  Especially enjoy the opening scene on the main menu of the dvd: in a white suit with a pony tail and a red ball. He's like watching a waterfall: it's never over and its never the same. Power awakens power, That's what he is.",1390780800,2,1164,4.404651162790698
8093499,5,B000BWFSP4,"This documentary was so deep and really let you see the heart & soul, drive and determination that led to him being the
fantastic husband, father, brother, friend and superstar he is today. I absolutely love the way he treats his fans, MOST of our American actors should treat their fans as well as he does. I absolutely love him, and I am a fan for life. The only thing I did not like was, it was just not long enough. However; both discs were awesome.  I definitely would recommend this to any Shah Rukh Khan
fans.",1387843200,,516,4.319587628865979
