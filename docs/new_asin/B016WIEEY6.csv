7480373,5,B016WIEEY6,"Incredible video, perfect for an at home workout.  The teacher was engaging and helpful. Truthfully forgot that I was doing it in my apartment and not in a full studio. I haven't done yoga in a while, so I was feeling a little nervous before starting it, the video was clear and instilled a ton of confidence in me!

7480378,4,B016WIEEY6,"After watching some clips, I was excited about the opportunity to try this DVD, given to me by a friend.  The scenery (mostly outdoor) looked pretty, Amy Schneider's voiceover instruction seemed solid, and the practice seemed paced to my preference.  I also liked that part of the ""detox"" aspect was a focus on poses that specifically target the thyroid--I've been diagnosed with hypothyroidism, so this intrigued me.

In her brief Introduction, Schneider explains that the routines on the DVD are designed to open and clear the chakras, the energy centers of the body.  The Main Menu of the DVD includes the following options:  Play All - Introduction - Session 1 -  Session 2 - Session 3 - Savasana - Bonus: Detox Pilates - Credits - Audio Setup.  I have provided a brief breakdown for each routine below, including the times.

SESSION 1 (21:38)
Schneider begins seated for this first segment.  She moves through a series of stretches, including chin tuck, next stretch, and lateral stretch.  She also includes Kundalini-inspired movements such as arm circles, forward/back flexion, twist side-to-side with breath, and stomach rotations.  Coming to all fours, she performs cat/cow and barrel rolls.  Two more dynamic sequences follow, a squat/forward bend and then standing arm swings.  Schneider concludes with three rounds of sun salutations.

SESSION 2 (21:32)
Schneider starts this practice in child's pose.  Coming to sitting on the heels, she performs breathwork and a stretch with the arms held wide.  She moves through cat/cow and down dog, then comes to standing for several series of sun salutations.  Schneider adds on to these vinyasas, including additional poses such as repeating cobra, standing twist, and standing side bend.  Other standing postures include eagle, chair, warrior 1, and 1/2 dog.  From child's pose, she finishes this segment with two backbends, cobra and camel's pose.

SESSION 3 (25:01)
Schneider calls this sequence the ""most flowing section.""  She again starts in child's pose but quickly moves through two sun salutations.  She begins her standing work with balance, starting with twisting tree pose.  She then goes through a standing series that includes warrior 1, warrior 2, reverse warrior, and side angle; she also adds Kapalbhati pranayama (breathing).  On the floor, she moves through locust, bow, and a reclined twist.

SAVASANA (5:50)
This segment features a simple guided relaxation.

BONUS: DETOX PILATES (10:50)
I'm not sure what was ""detox"" about this practice, but it was a nice little Pilates routine.  Schneider starts seated for front leg lifts, moving the heel in, pointing and flexing.  Coming to her side, Schneider performs side leg lifts, knee ins, front kicks, and clams, then repeats on the second side.  Next, she moves onto all fours for a brief series of knee-ins, straight leg lifts, and bent leg lifts.  After repeating on the second side, she finishes with child's pose, a reclined twist, Figure 4 stretch, and final relaxation.

Schneider teaches all of the segments via voiceover; she does not mirror-cue for the viewer.  (I never understand why not, especially with voiceover.)  I really liked the Pilates segment, which gave just a taste of targeting the lower body.  I also loved the first yoga section, which left me feeling very relaxed.  The second and third yoga segments felt a bit more ""meh"" to me--these seemed less about detox and more about just getting a standard flow yoga practice.  I may use these segments when I want something a bit more active, but I am mainly glad to have this DVD for Session 1 and the Pilates bonus.",1473465600,5,3609,5.098976109215017
7480379,5,B016WIEEY6,My favorite DVD. Just enough of a workout.,1466294400,,42,4.375
7480380,5,B016WIEEY6,"Great, relaxing DVD! Really enjoy it for recovery days and general relaxation and health",1463097600,,88,5.357142857142857
7480381,5,B016WIEEY6,"I LOVE this DVD.  I have purchased many yoga DVDs over the years, and this along with Flow Yoga: Energize & Renew with Amy Schneider are by far my favorites.  Amy Schneider is very uplifting, inspiring and motivating.  I have purchased Amy Schneider's DVDs multiple times for family and friends.  It is great for beginner and experienced yoga enthusiasts.",1462492800,4,355,4.966101694915254
7480382,5,B016WIEEY6,"This is wonderful for stretching out my lower back. It is a progressive/challenging workout, but not impossible to do, even for a beginner.",1461369600,2,139,5.086956521739131
7480383,2,B016WIEEY6,"I purchased this DVD due to all of the positive reviews it received.  I LOVE Detox Yoga and was looking to expand my library- however after doing all three practices, I was not feeling it.  This DVD is not for me and I don't agree with most of the reviews I read.  I thought many of the moves were hugely repetitive, and not of a type that put together I would call a yoga sequence, nor a 20 minute practice.  The three parts streamlined into one would have been ok, incorporating the actual detox parts of it.  Some of the moves were detox oriented, but most did not seem to be.  Ive done detox practices before, and compared to others this DVD seemed sorely lacking.  I did not find her voice soothing, nor was the techno music.  The production quality was very well done as was the scenery, etc., however I was not impressed with the choreography.  Her instruction was not as on point as Ive found with other teachers, I didn't feel the DVD flowed very well, and at times I was confused as to where I was supposed to be and I am not a beginning yoga student.  I would have liked to have more background as to why the moves she was teaching as detox were in fact detox and the benefits of the moves as such - any such instruction of that nature was few and far in between.  I also think there should have been more instruction with some of the twisting moves, so those persons that are new to the practice understand the mechanics and do not hurt themselves.
Ive purchased DVDs from many different instructors, granted everyone has a different style, but to me the instructor just seemed like she was too new to the game and could use with more in-house training before putting out a DVD for the masses.  At the end, instead of feeling wrung out and refreshed from a good detox yoga practice, my first thought was. . . that was it?????  Thats my opinion.  Ill be sending this to Goodwill.",1461196800,9,1890,4.332386363636363
7480384,5,B016WIEEY6,Great yoga dvd!  Very easy to follow...great instruction.,1461110400,,57,6.125

7480386,5,B016WIEEY6,"I have only gone through the first flow, and the 10 minute Pilates strengthener. I didn't want to do it at first because I didn't think it would be ""work"" per se. Let me tell you, my spine ADORED that 20 minutes!!! Amy seems to be pretty legit, and I like her chill nature. There are a lot of rounding and curving of the spine and neck, and she explains how that helps the thyroid and she goes through some chakra information. At one point you stand up and swing your arms back and forth, hitting your sides and stimulating your kidneys. At the very end, you do 1-3 gentle sun salutes, which of course made me want to do more, so I tried the Pilates 10 minutes. I may return to review further as I go along.",1458172800,19,707,4.130434782608695
7480387,5,B016WIEEY6,"Nice Yoga DVD, 3 different levels, Goddess pose is really difficult, instructor has good calming voice.",1457913600,,103,5.5

7480389,3,B016WIEEY6,I was thrilled to get in to yoga...  This is more for someone that is familiar with poses and proper formation.  I have a pulled muscle as a result of trying to keep up and winging it.  The tempo was way too fast for a novice.,1455408000,2,226,3.869565217391304
7480390,5,B016WIEEY6,Great DVD. I am able to do the beginner exercises with little difficulty. I feel better after my sessions with Amy. Very nice DVD for someone looking to get relief from stress and PMS.,1454976000,2,184,4.4411764705882355
7480391,5,B016WIEEY6,"I only did the first session just now - and I already know this is the best yoga tape for me! I have lymphedema in my left leg from a previous cancer operation, and this means that my lymphatic flow is compromised.
This yoga routine has all the right moves to open up my thoraic area to encourage the lymph to flow. And not just that, I love the rhythm, the simplicity, and the nice smooth moves. Feels really good on my back as well.
Thanks, Amy, your video has me all excited and I am hooked already ;)",1454457600,12,504,4.101010101010101
7480392,5,B016WIEEY6,"I love it. 3 - 20 min yoga sessions which to me get increasingly more challenging from session 1-3. Knowing this I can choose the session I'm most ready for. I have cancer and am going through chemotherapy so I truly appreciate the detox aspect of these programs. The maker assumes some prior knowledge of yoga but i don't think a novice would be intimidated either. Amy explains the benefits of each move/position in a way that makes sense to me without being preachy or overly spiritual. I feel that these sessions include some of my favorite aspects of hatha yoga, kundalini yoga and maybe even qi gong. There is also a quick detox pilates bonus session. I love it. Sometimes it's all I'm able to do during my illness and it feels great and I feel as if I've accomplished something positive that day.",1453248000,20,803,4.544827586206897

7480394,5,B016WIEEY6,"I've been taking Amy's classes at Cleveland Yoga for 7 years and I can tell you with 100% certainty that she's the real deal when it comes to yoga.  She practices yoga daily and teaches almost daily.  Her dedication to yoga shows up in every area of her life and she's an inspiration.  Her joy, her peace, and her humility are just a few of the things that keep me coming back to her classes again and again.  Now I can practice with her in my own home!

8737406,5,B016WIEEY6,"I don't think I've written a review on Amazon before but felt I needed to write one for this DVD. I have taken vinyasa yoga classes here in Boston from some of the best yoga instructors out there many of whom learned to teach yoga from Baron Baptiste. This DVD is a GREAT starting place for those new to yoga, people who need to stretch from working at a desk all day, and for people who somedays only have 20 minutes to exercise after work. The format is three 20 minute segments that increase in intensity. Sometimes I combine Levels 1 & 2. The third 20-minute segment is very challenging. Amy's cueing is exceptional- unless you are new to yoga, you don't necessarily have to watch the DVD. She is a true yoga instructor who clearly understands that it's not about doing fancy poses from the cover of Yoga Journal. Very well-paced. I highly recommend this DVD.",1491436800,3,863,4.503184713375796
