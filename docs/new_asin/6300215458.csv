He denied his Jewish roots and friends/family and acted in a treacherous manner in order to save his lucrative German film career. This is probably his last worthwhile film. Wonderfully directed, beautiful print (this edition is extremely clear and new looking).",1008720000,5,439,5.285714285714286

In fact, probably 75% of my movie collection is in black and white. If you get a chance, sit down some evening and watch this film. I think you'll like it as well. If you can't find this particular film, perhaps you can find an old Charlie Chaplin, Harold Loyd silent movie. My personal favorite silent film star is the old stone faced Buster Keaton. Many of these old films are becoming almost impossible for find. It's a shame. But if you get the chance to watch this fantastic old silent film I think you'll become a fan of these all but forgotten silent time as well!",1432252800,,744,4.20979020979021

7806524,3,6300215458,"A really interesting film made before the sound era. The cigarettes (which represent power), the emphasis on facial cues, and the role reversals of the characters are the best aspects of this film. If you happen to get the Criterion disc be sure to check out the Von Sternberg Till '29 visual essay (i.e. documentary). Its really worth the extra time. Great film for study!",1420934400,2,373,4.753846153846154
7806525,5,6300215458,"The Last Command is an exceptionally good film that tells a powerful tale--based on a true story--with few intertitles; the acting is so well done and convincing! Emil Jannings turned in an Oscar winning performance as Grand Duke Sergius Alexander who wants to defend Imperial Russia from the Communist revolutionaries in 1917; Evelyn Brent and William Powell also do a magnificent job of portraying their characters. The plot progresses at a very good pace; indeed I was spellbound and unable to quit watching from the very beginning to the very ending of the film. The musical score enhances the film and both the choreography and the cinematography reflect great forethought.

When the action begins in 1928, we quickly meet Lev Andreyev (William Powell), a movie director in Hollywood who left Russia to avoid death at the hands of the Imperialists; Lev is casting numerous extras for a battle scene recreating a scene from the 1917 Russian fight against Communist revolutionaries. Looking at photo after photo, Lev simply can't find the right person to cast as the Russian General--until, that is, he sees the photo of the actual but now former General (the Grand Duke Sergius Alexander, played by Emil Jannings) whom he fought against in Russia! Lev immediately instructs his assistant to hire the former Russian General for work as an extra playing a Russian General in a battle scene quite similar to the actual battles the General commanded all those years prior; the former General must wear the exact same uniform that he wore all those years prior, too.

True, Lev gets the former General all right--the former General who is now stooped over and still tormented by the ""shock"" he received in 1917 when Russia fell to the revolutionaries and his cousin the Czar and he were no longer powerful--and sentenced to death! Lev badly wants the pleasure of turning the tables on the former General which is why Lev has him wear the same uniform he used to wear in battle. The former General's entire experience as a movie extra is designed by Lev to humiliate the former General for wanting Lev imprisoned and even killed back in 1917.

The rest of the film is mostly a flashback told with outstanding pantomime and a minimal use of intertitles. The focus of the rest of the picture is primarily how and why Lev and his girlfriend Natalie Dabrova, the most dangerous revolutionary in Russia, crossed paths with the General; what happened after Lev was imprisoned and the General was left to his own devices with Natalie. The flashback eventually ends and we also discover what happens to all involved at the movie studio in 1928.

This movie is available on individual DVD but unfortunately Amazon doesn't offer it for sale that way. You can look for it as part of the three DVD set entitled ""Three Silent Classics by Josef Von Sternberg (Underworld / Last Command / Docks of New York) (The Criterion Collection)"" or you can look for this on VHS tape.

The Last Command is an excellent film that will appeal to devotees of silent film and silent dramas based on real life. Fans of the actors in this film will also appreciate this classic drama.",1346544000,4,3150,4.825925925925926
7806526,5,6300215458,"I do still use my vcr because some movies are not available on DVD, or cost can be staggering. Everything was as expected. Quality good. I wanted to see William Powell in an early role. Wish more were available.",1314057600,,211,4.435897435897436
7806527,5,6300215458,"As stated in the title of my review, The Criterion Collection actually has this title as a single DVD release.

I know because I was able to borrow one from my local library but for some reason the single isn't advertised for sale here on amazon.com which is too bad because:

1)  This is a truly great movie;

2)  It was the performance that netted Emil Jannings the first Academy Award for Best Actor ever given;

3)  It shows Jannings at his greatest.  Though Jannings fans may recognize the sad story of a character who must bear life's insults from his previous performance in The Last Laugh (directed by F. W. Murneau) where Jannings used many of the same methods to convey utter depair.

Being an American production the cinematic quality is noticeably better (or maybe just more familiar) than that of silent movie viewers used to silent European fare from the same time period.

Other nitpicking would include some plot holes like Jannings' characters' interaction with The Director.  As can be seen in this movie, and without spoiling the plot, the Jannings character isn't exactly charitable to the director and yet years later though originally expressing antipathy toward him the director suddenly (and perhaps even implausibly) changes his attitude towards him.  I think addition of dialogue earlier in the movie with Jannings saying something like ""you don't realize I'm right now but someday you will"" would have cured all this.

What's more, for an actor so adept at characterization, Jannings was sometimes hamstrung by the all too noticeable difference in acting skills in terms of those around him.  I call this The Godfather effect where seasoned viewers could litterally watch Marlon Brando act circles around his co stars just as Jannings often did here.

It's sad that in the end something as trivial as a pronounced German accent kept Jannings in Nazi Germany following this film.  I think one of the great what ifs of film history is:  What would have happened if Jannings had followed the likes of Conrad Veidt, F. W. Murneau and Fritz Lang westward during the dark days of World War II.

Though we may never know the answer to that question, we still happily have Jannings works such as this one to cherish and enjoy.",1309219200,,2245,4.847769028871391
7806528,5,6300215458,"""The Last Command"" was nominated for Best Picture at the inaugural Academy Awards in 1928; ""Wings"" won best picture (Clara Bow, and a cameo by the very young Gary Cooper), but it is my opinion that TLC was the better of the two films.  The other reviewers have given you the gist of the film; I wanted to comment on the superb score by Gaylord Carter, master of the Wurlitzer Unit Orchestra.  Contrary to popular belief, silent movies were accompanied by a live orchestra (which was prohibitively expensive) or a ""theater organ,"" which was very cost effective and allowed the hoi polloi access to movies.  One would only encounter such a film accompanied by a piano if one was unfortunate enough to view the film at the local Bijou in Bugtussle.  In any event, Gaylord Carter was one of the last masters of the silent film ""soundtrack.""  I saw him play the original score for Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" on the organ at the Hammond Castle in Gloucester, MA during a screening of the film.  This series of movies are worth purchasing, not only for the films themselves, but also for Mr. Carter's scoring and performance.  The organ used for these films was a Wurlitzer...I want to say San Silmar, but I am not sure.  William Powell (The Thin Man) is also in this film.",1294963200,4,1265,4.616071428571429
7806529,5,6300215458,"This film is one of the many reasons why modern film students and drama students ought to watch silent films.  I am neither of these, but can appreciate the pathos and irony contained in this story, which is put across perhaps better silently, than if words were to interrupt.  Everyone who loves classic films should not miss the silent genre.",1265932800,2,344,4.716666666666667
7806530,5,6300215458,"So what else is there to say?  The great Emil Jannings, starring with Evelyn Brent and being directed by von Sternberg.  The concept is nothing if not unique--the supreme commander of the Russian army meets the Bolshies and is reduced to being a Hollywood actor, working for one of the Bolshies he had arrested who has, by now, become a Hollywood diva/director.  The execution is magnificent.  The performances are stellar, the lighting utter magic.  In silent film the images tell the story and what a story they tell here.  Perfectly.",1240617600,2,536,4.9
7806531,5,6300215458,"Although the quality of this VHS tape is absolutely excellent, it is such a good silent film that it deserves to be issued on DVD and be more readily available.  It was nominated for ""Best Picture"" in 1928 and it's not hard to see why.  Not only does it feature a dramatic performance by Emil Jannings, with superb direction by Josef von Sternberg, but the story is very interesting as well.  The main theme is the Russian Revolution of 1917, but the focus is on the general, cousin of the Russian tsar and the most powerful man in Russia.  Right from the start, however, we are shown a very human side of the general; 10 years later as a sad old man with a shocking past and for whom you can't help feeling sorry.  Then the main part of the film, as a flashback, shows his experiences during the final days of tsarist Russia.  There are some surprises and even a love story, some suspense when returning to the present day, 1928, and a very dramatic climax.  Everything moves along and unfolds at a good pace, and there are not many intertitles to read or complications that are hard to follow, making this film a good choice for anyone new or a bit wary of silent films.",1087516800,20,1172,4.373271889400922
