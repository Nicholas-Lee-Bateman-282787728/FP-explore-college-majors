3789245,3,B001TEKK0G,"The video is alright. The quality is good, and it has some decent tips and recipes. If you're already a breadmaker it's stuff you already know. It could stand to go into some more detail on a few things, and gets a few details wrong that aren't critical. 3 stars. If you've never made bread before it's probably worth your time, although there are better videos out there.

What really gets me is this weird family. I did some research and there's definitely weird stuff going on with these girls, and possibly their neighbors. Seems to me like there's some sort of weird Christian cult or polygamy happening. Possibly some crimes committed--who knows. For sure some weird stuff going on with the mother. She rules over her daughters with an iron fist. Seems like the father is in hiding too, doesn't like to come out. They say he ran off a long time ago but that could be a cover-up for their illicit lifestyle. After I do some more detective work, including possibly hiring a private eye, I'll update this review. I have a whole heck of a lot of disposable income and I need to find out this family's secrets at any monetary cost.

I can't let this family harm my Christian faith.",1330646400,6,1182,4.518691588785047
3789246,4,B001TEKK0G,Right now you can get the WHOLE series (all 11 DVDs) for only 9.99 each....I am surprised that Amazon is more expensive since usually I look to amazon to beat most prices....,1329177600,5,174,4.46875
3789247,5,B001TEKK0G,"I love these DVD's series!  I am a lawyer by trade and have always found the kitchen to be of special therapy for me as a stress free life ingredient!  Trust me I am not a cook, more like a hazardous beast in the kitchen!  So when I say that I learned to make the most yummy fresh baked herb bread EVER i mean it!!! If I can do it anyone could.  These ladies are thorough in explaining how to make a crusty warm bread from scratch.  Worth every penny.  Once you bake your first loaf you will find it hard to buy a loaf of bread from the supermarket.  The big plus:  you bring some to work and tell everyone you made it from scratch!  You just became the office superhero!!!!",1325462400,4,674,4.045454545454546
3789248,5,B001TEKK0G,"I watched this video with my 6 year old daughter who wanted to bake bread. But I learned a lot myself from it. I am not a novice baker and have been baking bread for years yet the process always had been somewhat overwhelming to begin, especially with kids. The West ladies made it so simple that now I bake almost everyday and not using my bread machine. After watching this, my girl made a bread from scratch almost all by herself, which made herself very confident.
If you want to introduce baking to your kids, this video will work well with your purpose. Strongly recommend.",1324512000,,579,4.471698113207547
3789249,3,B001TEKK0G,I enjoyed watching the DVD and saved the recipe PDF files on the computer to try another day only to find out those recipe files didn't follow what they actually showed on the DVD.  It was a disaster and all the ingredients and time wasted.  I wish they reviewed the file before selling the DVD.,1315699200,4,295,4.345454545454546
3789250,5,B001TEKK0G,"I have made bread only once before and it didn't turn out, plus it was quite a process. These women have really made it a simple and fun process. I am very excited to make bread now and not to worried about a long and sticky process.

Plus, it was fun to see them with all their kitchen utensils, old fashion and simple, just the way I like it:)",1295395200,,345,4.0
3789251,5,B001TEKK0G,"My little girl got this series for Christmas last year, and the older two kids enjoy it right along with her. (Of course my son is a boy and notices every instance when CeCe just grabs things out of other people's hands throughout the series, which she does a LOT... unintentionally, I'm sure!)

Their bread making methods are what you might call slightly non-conventional. I'm not a novice at breadmaking, and so I was quite surprised to see them making bread the way they did. Everything is done in the same bowl: measuring, mixing, kneading, and first rising (they dump the dough on the counter after that--I no longer even do that). I don't know anybody who makes bread like this, but I love it because there is so much less to clean up, and it's faster, and it turns out great. Also, I was taught that you have to roll out your loaf dough with a rolling pin, then roll the dough into a spiral and press the sides and bottom seams, and then put them in the loaf pans. Nope, they just separate the dough ""b'guess and b'gosh"" by eyeballing it, then place the dough in the loaf pans, and sorta press the dough in to a bread shape along the sides. Then stick it with a fork.

I'm here to tell ya that I will make a lot more bread from scratch now because of the ease of cleaning and the speed at which I can get bread made. The flour can be added by feel, and hard white whole wheat flour makes much better loaves then the hard red whole wheat flour... there's a lot to learn here.

If you are looking for the ""whys"" of breadmaking, you won't find it here. You won't find out about different kinds of yeasts or how they work, or what the salt does; and you won't find out that if you want to double a bread dough recipe, you do not double the yeast (so don't do that!). What this will do is get you in the kitchen whipping up bread recipes whether it's yeast bread, cornbread, pizza dough, cinnamon rolls (I actually prefer a ""sweet dough"" with eggs, milk, and butter in it for the rolls; the West Ladies just use the bread recipe).

Throughout the series, you will hear the words, ""Wonderful"" and ""Beautiful"" and ""Blessin"" a whole lot. Lots and lots. Doesn't bother us; might be very off-putting to some. I'd frankly like to meet these ladies and listen to them say those words in person ;)

**Note: In the ""Recipe"" section of the DVD (in the Bonus Features), the recipe for bread calls for 2 teaspoons of salt. That is a typo, do not do that!  It's only 1 teaspoon--else your bread won't rise properly and will taste very salty. In the video they use 1 teaspoon. Also, when they say ""wheat flour"" they mean ""whole wheat flour"". All the flour they use is wheat, whether refined or not. When they say ""white flour"" they mean, ""unbleached refined wheat flour that has had the wheat bran and wheat germ removed""--such as bread flour or all-purpose flour (they use bread flour, presumably).

And as an aside, if you want a quickie way to make a terrific herb bread, soak 2T. of Italian herbs in the water for 15 minutes before adding it. Eat the bread plain or make garlic toast with it.

Check out their other videos!

P.S. Don't pitch your bread machine. It's great when it's too hot to use the oven. Same as the crock pot.",1280188800,37,3222,4.338870431893688
3789252,5,B001TEKK0G,"This is an excellent video - high quality & well produced. It gives GREAT info especially for visual learners like myself who sometimes have trouble reading something in a book then making it work in a real-life situation. This gave great info for those who are starting to make their own bread for the first time. Invaluable resource for a beginning to intermediate bread makers! If you are a very experienced bread maker, you might not get a LOT of valuable information from this DVD, but you will still be inspired by these ladies & it will give you more gusto to make your bread even better!",1267574400,5,595,4.570093457943925
3789253,5,B001TEKK0G,"I got the complete collection for a gift and what a delight these dvds are! I have made homemeade bread before but I learned quite a few new tricks from this dvd.  If you are a visual person and like to actually ""see"" something done instead of just read about it in a cookbook then this is the dvd for you!",1262131200,5,306,4.016393442622951

8341087,5,B001TEKK0G,I bought this for my 87 year old dad and he LOVES it. I bought him the cooking one... I am sure that he will like that one just as much. He mentioned that he thought it was amusing how they worked in the kitchen barefoot,1503187200,,220,3.8043478260869565

8341092,3,B001TEKK0G,"It is a good instructional dvd for bread making. I was disappointed though when I received it in the mail and it had no plastic wrapping on the dvd case, possibly a ""used"" dvd? Who knows.",1387497600,,187,4.222222222222222
8341093,4,B001TEKK0G,"I bought three of the series. They have loads of info I have not come across before, but the people are a bit redundant with dialogue.",1355961600,,134,4.1923076923076925
8341094,5,B001TEKK0G,"For me, this DVD wasn't as detailed as their Art of Canning DVD but it's still 5 star worthy because it's the best that I have found.  The West ladies teach you all the techniques on making homemade bread, hamburger rolls, cinnamon rolls, pizza dough, a breakfast dish and cornbread.

Side note:
I did have a problem with trying to view this DVD on my computer but it works fine in the regular DVD player.",1334707200,2,405,4.386666666666667
