2416031,5,B000BG0DM8,"This is a very relaxing video with soft religious songs, music, and Bible scripture read or sung to a background of beautiful nature scenes. It is one of the few programs you would probably watch more than once. I have watched it many times over many years, especially when stressed.",1243555200,8,283,4.68
2416032,5,B000BG0DM8,"If you love God, scripture, nature, and good Christian music, you will absolutely love this video.

Definitely one of the most encouraging videos I have ever seen and very good  to help you focus on the Lord Jesus.",1191888000,,214,4.605263157894737
2416033,5,B000BG0DM8,"I stumbled on this DVD looking for a pre-order item.  This is an excellent dvd for a person who is at the stage in their life to make time for God, rather than taking time for God.  Moody Bible Institute sponsored the narrative popular scripture readings and Questar provided awesome photographic natural scenes to accompany the Bible readings.  In the In his Presence sector: The kayaker journeying through a turburlent whitewater gorge is truly awesome with appropriate scriptures and music.  In the Be thou my Vision sector:  The free falling wind glider is an awesome photographic scene for all to see.  So if you are going through a diffcult time in your life right now this is a rewarding dvd to get you through this phase of your life. For ""this to will pass"".",1166572800,14,767,4.686567164179104

2416038,5,B000BG0DM8,"In times of great trouble, I have found this to calm my nerves and comfort me through hardship after hardship! The two videos on here do that very much! Looking for the reassurance you need, when you are alone, worried, or depressed so much that you can't even find the drive to pick up a phone and talk with anyone? This will help! We need the Lord and to believe, to remember this too shall pass, what ever your personal ""this too"" maybe right now! I got through the junk in my life, lived through the horrors of the times, and one thing that really reminded me I wasn't alone and that prayer does work, and my faith wasn't a waste of time, what this dvd, and what good is on it! I hope you will get it today for this is one dvd that is work ever penny! And it's weight in gold! I'm glad I bought this and I bet I am not alone in that! Blessings to you! Thanks for readin'!",1346198400,4,875,4.0344827586206895

8086375,4,B000BG0DM8,"I want to first say the perfect worship DVD is a set by Freddy Hayler, ""Songs of Angels"" which keeps repeating over and over all night if you like and what you see is very different than this DVD and so many like it. I know because I have many of them. Now for this DVD. It is like all the rest in one way and we will look at this first. You are going to see more running water than you will see in a life time, the same is true with snow, butterflies, eagles, which I love but you can see to much of anything other than your grandchildern. To keep going - hummingbirds, rain (more water), more snow with ice. I happen to love fall and spring, but you are not going to see this, just snow, water, btterflies, birds etc. The one difference with this DVD is the narration of Scripture and some old songs done by the best of singers. That makes it a four star not a three star. The best way to use this DVD is to close your eyes and listen to the Scripture and the songs. It will not repeat unless you do the repeating unlike ""Songs of Angels"". This one is worth watching, but you might do as I have done with so many of these DVDs, give them away as a gift. Hope this helps.",1418083200,,1172,3.9703389830508473
