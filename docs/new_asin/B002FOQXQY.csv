8369349,5,B002FOQXQY,"This is the second of the series for Kaze No Stigma.(aka meaning Stigma of the Wind with the term Stigma meaning like a sign or omen or Stigmata, in this case refering tot he Blue Eyes one of the main characters gets when he uses his full power becasue of the pact he made witht he God of the Wind)

I truly like this series....there is alot of seaming filler episodes in this second set of 12, this is to add a little more to the relationships of the characters like for example how the leader of the Fire Clan wants the two main characetrs to get together.  The girl is again older then her freinds...which is implied, becasue she seams to have missed alot of school due to her situation of being a Fire Magic user.  I say IMplied becasue the audience finds out she goes to extra school to make up alot of things...whihc is normaly reserved for students who got held back in school.

In this series we learn more about why Kazuya made his pact with the wind god, but in truth if you watched the first and thought about it you realized Kazuya already had wind magic powers.  As his bio;ogical father was a Wind user.(yep cant forget his mother re-married and married the man who was part of the fire clan who had a daughter already.)  And thus even though the two are brother ans suster they are not actualy related.

Anywise the only drawback to this part of this series is that there is no more.  They didn't make anymore Anime for this series...you have to read the Manag(comic) instead.  It ends not too bad...but i was left feeling like there was too much more introduced that needed another series.

Like for example we learn why he made the pact...we get flash backs of why...but we never really learn how or what happened...ie. we don't get to see him meet the god of the wind.  Though it seams the new characters in this episode know about what happened more then the audience does...or ever will.

Like i said this one has alot of episodes that seam like filler episodes...but these are important to let the viewers understand more about the characters.

All in all...if you liked the first 12 episodes...you will like these next 12.",1296086400,,2144,4.438775510204081
8369350,5,B002FOQXQY,"This is the second installment of Kaze No Stigma.  It continues the story and ends with episode 24.  As with many anime shows this story could easily continue but stops at a decent place.  I enjoyed the characters and the uses of the elements that they employ (fire, wind, etc.)  As a whole this series is worth viewing and reviewing.  The lead female character is annoying but is a perfect foil for the lead male character.  I highly recommend getting both this and volume one for anyone who is interested in anime.",1275955200,3,516,4.554347826086956
