They found it very useful in gaining a new perspective.  Just a note though,it would have been much easier as a download from somewhere. Finding a DVD player that worked was a challenge.  Noone even had one on a computer, so being able to buy it as a download would have been preferable.  I understand that that makes printed material difficult but that could be a PDF, associated with the MP4 and MP3 files",1487289600,3,606,4.336283185840708

I love how he stresses that people with all ability levels, even those who have no feeling in different parts of their bodies, can have that mind-body connection.  I hope, with practice, those in my class with limited feelings in their body can have this experience.  Intend to purchase his newest dvd.",1346112000,12,371,4.75
