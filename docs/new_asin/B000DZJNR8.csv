A great gift for young kids.  Something to watch on a rainy day when everyone wants to be entertained.",1233446400,,277,4.25
8103014,5,B000DZJNR8,"I'm a mom of 3 and this is a great DVD to have.  I don't have the time I want to sit and teach my kids what is and isn't important.  Im too busy working to keep clothes on their back.  This DVD has been a lifesaver.  Usually I roll my eyes at all the sappy kids stuff out there like Barney but this one is really great.  I can sit and watch it with them for hours.  Very family oriented, great morals and values being taught.  And the kids love it!",1184284800,,448,3.8043478260869565

This is truly a MUST HAVE for a family with young children.",1140480000,3,254,4.7272727272727275
