8250652,5,B0013FIAB2,Great DVD just what I was after. Quality of the DVD was perfect and would recommend to others if they are interested in this subject.,1359072000,,133,4.36
8250653,4,B0013FIAB2,"Engineering an Empire is a snappy and slick series from the History Channel that discusses a multitude of past cultural contributions to the world from a variety of civilizations.  In volume 1, The Aztecs episode in particular, it held my 7th grade students' interests (as well as adults' interests)as we experience the violence, beauty, awe, and mystery of a civilization's amazing creations for survival from a time long past.  Peter Weller's acting chops fill in quite nicely as a dynamic host with an impressive historical educational resume to boot.  It's a quick 45 minutes that manages to keep the pace high and trick the students into learning something along the way.",1351209600,,676,5.072072072072072
8250654,5,B0013FIAB2,"Are you interested in ancient Greece and the Aztec's?
No?
Then why are you reading this?
If you answered yes, then get ready for an awesome documentary.

Ok, the good.
Great acting, great score, great pacing etc...
There was a ton of history thrown in here.
The parts on ancient Greece were incredible.
There was a ton of information in there I did not know about or had forgotten.
But as good as the parts on ancient Greece were the Aztec parts were the icing on the cake.
I've always found the Aztec culture fascinating.
Scary but fascinating and the documentary does an excellent job of providing answers as to how their civilization got started and how it ended.
Their bloody rituals were also explained in detail without being overly dramatic or graphic.

The bad?
Nothing.
Everything about this documentary was done right and done extremely well.

For people who are into history this comes...
Highly recommended.",1282608000,2,919,4.840764331210191
