7333888,5,B011KG2IAM,Always enjoyed Sean Connery as James Bond!,1454198400,,42,5.142857142857143
7333889,5,B011KG2IAM,"I have seen many of the more recent 10 or 12 Bond films many times in my lifetime, but I haven't seen some of the earlier Sean Connery ones nearly as much. So I decided to make it a point to go back and review all of the Bond movies in chronological order.

After just now watching all 3, I can honestly say that these really captured the classic Bond feel. Despite the absence of ""Q"" in the first movie, these will easily be remembered as the foundation of an incredible franchise. I feel that the acting, story, and occasional classic Bond wit and humor really shine through while viewing these films.

It's easy to see why they were able to make so many Bond films since these movies really helped to set the groundwork for what is yet to come. The picture quality is absolutely fantastic and the fact that it includes digital copies make this a purchase definitely worth the money!

Pour yourself a martini and kick back and enjoy the movies that helped start the craze and love for MI6's beloved 00 Agent!",1453507200,2,1010,4.419354838709677
7333890,5,B011KG2IAM,This was a gift for my father-in-law. He loves Sean Connery's James Bond movies but always complains that they're never shown on cable. He was SUPER excited to receive this 3-movie collection and has watched them several times since we gave it to him. I'm happy that he is happy!,1452816000,2,279,4.6
7333891,5,B011KG2IAM,"Until Daniel Craig came along, this was the penultimate Bond.
Now loyal Connery fans please hear me out.  I too think Nobody Does it Better (ha-- see the pun?) than Connery did in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE which is out bonded by GOLDFINGER a year later.  If Connery had stopped right there with three films we'd have a clear winner.
Dr. No is not a bad film by any means, but it's the slowest and most dated as Bond was just figuring out his ways.

THIS is the set to get if you're getting only one.  Sean Connery sets the standard as James Bond and GOLDFINGER is the best Bond film in the entire series.",1450137600,5,600,4.191304347826087
7333892,5,B011KG2IAM,"First three Bond's.  Fantastic going back and seeing how different it was in the 60's.
The world was a far different place, and Bond was a different kind of guy even then.",1448064000,2,171,4.34375
7333893,5,B011KG2IAM,A little dispotined about the special features but the film picture is nice and the films hold up well,1446422400,,102,4.421052631578948
7333894,1,B011KG2IAM,"The movies are my favorites ! But ,This is fraud. It says digital download. Well, the movies are not even in the foxredeem.com website.! I just bought this wonderful movies just for the digital download! Fraud! Now I have to wait for somedy to answer my email to solve this little problem ! Sucks ! I never will buy a fox movie .",1445558400,5,329,4.238095238095238
7333895,5,B011KG2IAM,"Excellent movies.
Enjoyed them very much.
I much prefer over the newer James Bond movies.",1444953600,3,89,5.0
7333896,5,B011KG2IAM,"My top 5 choices for James Bond films are: From Russia With Love, Skyfall, Gold Finger, Casino Royal and Dr No. On blue ray this is the best quality you can get. You also get a digital copy of each on in High Definition (cost 13 to 14 dollars each). Plus some nice extras. All for $15. Even if your not a big James Bond fan and just want a little James Bond then this is the item to get.

My next choices would be the Daniel Craig Collection (2 other favorites) and the Sean Connery Collection Vol 2 (great deal and all pretty good films). Each Roger Moore Collection has a couple of OK films with some films of lower quality. Pierce Brosnan has Golden Eye with a few others that are pretty good and 1 of lower quality. George Lazenby has on 1 film which is a good one with Diana Rigg. But what is the point of a collection for him with no digital copy? Timothy Dalton has Living Daylights which is pretty good and a lesser film but no digital copy on his collection either.",1443830400,,974,4.1534391534391535
7333897,5,B011KG2IAM,"Wow! If you don't already have your favorite Bond movie on blu-ray, this is the collection to buy. Three blu-ray movies on three discs for $14.98 --- you can't do better than that! These are the restored prints of these movies, and by restored I mean ""restored"". Incredible clarity, color, and sharpness! I doubt if the movies looked this good when they were initially released. I know these movies have been available on blu-ray before, but never at this low price. And there are extras galore --- commentary track, interviews, and other special features.

Although all three of the movies in this first collection (""Dr. No"", ""From Russia With Love"", and ""Goldfinger"") were originally filmed at the aspect ratio of 1.37:1, they were meant to be shown in the United States at 1.85:1 using a gate on the projector that cuts off a bit of the top and bottom of the picture to change the aspect ratio. That's the way they appear on your TV screen. (This is done by design to save money. Another popular movie that used this technique was the 1983 film ""A Christmas Story"".) This means there are no black bars on the top, bottom, or sides of the image. Each movie fills your TV screen.

The only slight, very slight, objection I have is to the menu on each disc. In an effort to be cute, I suppose, you don't click on ""Play"" to start the movie, you click on ""Initiate Mission""; instead of ""Subtitles"" you click on ""Language Decryption"": etc. This makes it more fun, I guess, but because of this I found the ""Special Features"" to be a bit tricky to navigate. This concern is probably mine alone, and as I said it's a very slight objection.

I have seen each of these movies many times, and I vividly remember seeing ""Dr. No"" in a theater when it was originally released (I was very young). But watching these blu-ray editions was a revelation. It was as though I had never seen these movies before. The quality of the picture is absolutely astonishing!

Very highly recommended!",1442448000,60,1972,4.59375
