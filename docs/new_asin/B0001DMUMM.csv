8010945,5,B0001DMUMM,"1) This DVD has a variety of workouts- 10 min yoga, pilates, abs, buns and thighs, and upper body.  PLUS a 30 minute cardio workout. Combine them however you'd like- the dvd has a weekly reccommended list or you can pick combos like stress relief or stretching.
2) THE MENUS WORK!  There's nothing that brings a good dvd down like technical difficulties, but this has all the options at your fingertips including with/without music and instruction options.
It's a keeper!",1210636800,3,471,4.875
8010946,5,B0001DMUMM,"As with most exercise videos, I find myself enjoying them for the first few weeks and then retreating back to my old habits.  With Gym In a Box, I don't feel that way.  There are so many different routines to do and it comes with a bonus cardio video and meal plan.  All you need are 3-5 pound weights and a towel to wipe off the sweat!",1111622400,2,336,3.985074626865672
