3883402,5,B002A5J2GQ,"Charming Jane Powell comedy, with a nostalgic view of the 1940s.  Powell, as in all her early movies, is the perfect ingnue and heroine.",1386374400,,136,4.666666666666667
3883403,5,B002A5J2GQ,"The plot of this 1953 Warner Brothers movie is a slight variation on that of Hit The Deck or On The Town. The three sailors in question are Gordon Macrae, Gene Nelson and comedian Jack Leonard and the girl, Jane Powell. Powell plays song-and-dance hopeful Penny Weston who is being `managed' for a Broadway show by producer Joe Woods (Sam Levene). The three sailors get an unexpected month's shore-leave while their ship gets a refit. Instead of spending all their back pay on booze and dames, Choirboy Jones (Gordon Macrae) persuades the crew to invest their money. Their investment however turns out to be a Broadway flop, only turned around from disaster by producer George Abbott, stage book writer Moss Hart and lyricist Ira Gershwin, all making cameo appearances as themselves. Paul Burke and Burt Lancaster also make one-shot cameo appearances.

I didn't time it but my impression in watching this again was that there was more song and dance and less dialogue than in most musicals I have seen recently. The tunes were supplied by Sammy Fain and Sammy Cahn, who also doubled as producer. The choreography was by LeRoy Prinz and Gene Nelson. I have always rated Gene Nelson's singing and dancing as good as that of Gene Kelly, though he is less well-known. The music in the film was played by Ray Heindorf and the Orchestra. The only song to survive independently of the film was `Face to face', sung in the movie by Jane Powell, but Gordon Macrae's recording became a minor hit for him. Powell and Macrae together sang `There must be a reason', `My heart is a singing heart', and a Strauss waltz that was reworked to appear as `When it's love'. Jack Leonard's role was rather like that of Stubby Kaye in Guys and Dolls as a quite adept singing and dancing comedian. Overall, the film gave us 90 minutes of almost non-stop singing and dancing.",1345939200,6,1850,4.727554179566564
3883404,5,B002A5J2GQ,"Thank God this was released on DVD! Jane is great;. Her solos and duets with Gordon MacRae are great. The choreography is fantastic, you don't get to see Gene Nelson in too many films, but his dancing in the car garage/""rehearsal studio"" with Jane and Gordon is unbelievable!  Wait till you hear Jane sing 'Ya better Kiss Kiss Kiss Kiss Me or I'll Scream'.  Its histerical. The CD of the score was released as well, but it was a studio track recording, due to contractual problems with the stars.  To get the real beauty of the score, you MUST have this DVD. The whole cast is brilliant and the humor is non-stop. If you love musicals, you must have it. If you love Jane Powell or Gordon MacRae then it is required viewing.",1339459200,5,723,4.421052631578948
3883405,5,B002A5J2GQ,My parents like to watch older movies. Thet really enjoyed this one and have added to their favorites. They have watched it multiple times.,1323302400,,139,4.833333333333333
3883406,4,B002A5J2GQ,"A Navy ship comes to New York, and while most of the men are excited to get ashore and spend their money taking girls out, one man plans to invest his money in the stock market. His idea sounds sensible, and soon he has charge of $50,000 worth of sailor pay, all waiting to be invested and duplicated.

Once ashore, three of the sailors go to an investment broker, who is desperately trying to get away from the pressures of a musical producer who wants him to invest in his show. After being kicked out of the office, the producer yells in the lobby that the broker is under investigation, causing the sailors to second guess their plans. They soon find themselves investing in the show instead, because all of them are under the spell of the leading lady (Jane Powell).

Powell and Gene Nelson are the reasons to watch this movie. Powell is strikingly beautiful and it's a wonder that audiences ever tired of her. Her voice is clear and lovely to hear in song after song. Nelson's dancing is superb and earns him third billing. The story is simple, but it gives plenty of excuses for songs and comedy, and both trump the weak story.",1315872000,2,1134,4.473429951690822

3883408,4,B002A5J2GQ,"Though credibility is stretched if you think about the plot too long and hard (or not even that long), this is a fun musical romp with powerhouse singing talents Jane Powell and Gordon MacRae, along with the incredible hoofing of Gene Nelson. Another ""sailor on shore leave"" storyline has MacRae entrusted with investing the accrued backpay of his fellow sailors on a submarine, which amounts to $50,000.00. As he and his friends, Nelson and comic Jack E. Leonard, carry the duffel bag full of money to the bank they encounter Jane Powell and her slick-talking manager getting tossed out after attempting to get the bank to invest in their show. Smitten by Powell, MacRae is soon convinced to invest their cash in the show (it doesn't hurt that the manager tells him it is a show about the Navy, which it isn't). The cast is currently rehearsing in a parking garage, for lack of funds to hire a hall. Chaos ensues as the manager tries to keep the sailors from discovering the truth about the show before it actually opens. The garage owner wants their show out of his place, the lead actor is a temperamental ham, the costume company wants payment with a check that doesn't bounce, etc. Initially the show is a flop, but with the help of George Abbott, Ira Gershwin and Moss Hart (and the U.S. Marine Corp.) there is hope for success. Through it all Powell and MacRae have an on-again-off-again relationship going, and when they get together for a song they truly make beautiful music together.

On the imdb site there seemed to be disagreement as to the source of the story--whether it was based on a George S. Kaufman play or was a remake of the Jimmy Stewart/Eleanor Powell 1944 production ""Born to Dance"". Though the two movies do share the idea of sailors on leave and a young entertainer trying to be in a show, the similarities end there. In the screen credits for this movie it states that it is based on a story by George S. Kaufman. I think that is pretty clear.

Presented in full screen 1.33:1, with absolutely no extras (not even scene selection), this DVD-R from the WB Archive Collection is for play in ""play only"" devices. If your player is a player recorder this most likely won't work. Good visual clarity and sound, I don't believe there was anything done to ""remaster"" the print, as there is an occasional imperfection, but it doesn't appear to have been  a bad print to begin with.

I enjoy this movie because I really like the two main leads and I've always wanted to see more of Gene Nelson. It is not the best any of the leads have done, so it wouldn't be one of my top picks, but if you are hungry for more from some of your favorites, as I was, this will be a pleasant watching experience and I can recommend it as such.

3883409,4,B002A5J2GQ,"Purists may not consider ""Three Sailors and a Girl"" on the A-list of screen musicals, but it is certainly one of my Desert Island DVDs.

I loved it when I saw it as a child in the mid-50s and it seems as good as it did then - and never fails to cheer me up.  What are its charms? Well, the book is yet another take on ""On The Town"", and you need to severly suspend belief to follow the corny plot of the eponymous marines who invest their colleagues (and their own) money in a Broadway show!  What it does have, however, are engaging performances from the entire cast, tuneful numbers by Sammy Fain and Sammy Cahn, some charming song-and-dance routines - including the energetic 'Lately' number lead by the brilliant and under-rated hoofer Gene Nelson, tapping sure-footedly along precarious girders in an underground car park. Why? - well it's their rehearsal space, of course!

Gordon McCrae is is strong, smiling voice, and there is good support from Sam Levene and Jack Leonard.  Above all, Jane Powell's blue eyes and true voice fill the screen and proclaim her to be one of the brightest Hollywood stars of her generation everytime she appears in a succession of full-skirted New Look costumes and cheeky hats.  The film also confirms what we knew from ""Royal Wedding"" onwards, that she's quite happy to swap her operetta soprano for a Vaudeville belter whenever the situation demands.

Definitely one for curling up and singing-along to if you are nursing a cold or have drawn the curtains against a cold, rainy night. Enjoy!",1256428800,22,1532,4.715355805243446

8358948,5,B002A5J2GQ,Jane Powell is absoltuely stunning in this film. She's no longer the cute young girl you remember her being in her earlier films. She has definitely matured and her body looks so sexy in all of the outfits she wears. My favorite outfit in the film is the song and dance routine she does with Jack E. Leonard. She comes out in a white fur coat and sexily pulls it off. She is wear a black sequined outfit with a white sash across her body. Her legs are perfect wearing black stcokings and high heels. Jane looks perfect here and what a pair of sexy legs she has. The song are good and the rest of the cast os good as well. I highly recommend this film for Jane Powell fans.,1480291200,,672,4.137404580152672

8358951,4,B002A5J2GQ,"How many film musicals are based around three sailors on shore-leave and their song & dance exploits in New York City?  ""On the Town"" and ""Hit the Deck"" both immediately spring to mind.  Squeezed in-between is the adorable THREE SAILORS AND A GIRL, from 1953.

In a rare loan-out to Warners, MGMs blonde songbird Jane Powell plays Penny Weston, the leading lady of a struggling Broadway production, being produced by the unscrupulous Joe Woods (Sam Levene).  Rehearsals are being held in an underground car mechanics shop and the star is a tone-deaf, halfwit opera singer (George Givot).  In the right place and at the right time are three sailors (Gordon MacRae, Gene Nelson and Jack E. Leonard), with a sackful of back-pay, looking for a good investment.  A Broadway musical, perhaps?

The plot is predictable but the performances are priceless.  Warners knew how to throw together a fun musical (take for instance any of the Doris Day films from the same period), and THREE SAILORS is no exception.  Gordon MacRae, at the absolute peak of his good looks and strident voice, and Jane Powell, glowing and so pretty in her Moss Mabry costumes, pair beautifully here.  Its a shame that they spent the best parts of their careers at different studios  they work very well together.  Gene Nelsons dancing is sublime and he has a wonderful routine with Ms Powell too.  Veda Ann Borg has a funny part playing the assistant to Levene.",1459123200,2,1428,4.827160493827161
