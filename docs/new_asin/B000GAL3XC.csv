2603737,4,B000GAL3XC,"The Film has beautiful cinematography. I purchased hoping for a movie with a look at Asian theatrical forms, in an actual performing arts presentation. This didn't exactly fit the bill I was looking for- but I am still happy with my purchase. It's a great flick, has all the elements of traditional Asian theatrical forms, but does not stick to the strict traditional styles.",1290729600,3,375,4.875
2603738,4,B000GAL3XC,"Kabuki has always been the secret heart of Japanese film. When the first motion picture cameras arrived in Japan, they immediately started filming Kabuki performances for posterity, and have never really stopped since.  Kabuki's visual and storytelling style flavors all most all Japanese films, from big productions like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cutie-Honey/dp/B000N6UEQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cutie Honey</a>&nbsp;to kabuki-trained actress Inou Rie and her particular movements as Sadako in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ring/dp/B000088NQR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ring</a>.

It is rare, however, for modern Kabuki plays to be adapted directly into film. Nakashima Kazuki's ""Ashurajo no Hitomi (1987)"" (""The Eye of Castle Ashura"") was a big enough hit that in 2005 director Takita Yojiro (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Onmyoji/dp/B00009RXI7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Onmyoji</a>) used it as the basis for his martial-arts fantasy film of the same name.  As the lead he even cast Ichikawa Somegoro, who had made the role famous in the Kabuki theater.  It was a bold and ambitious experiment.

The story is huge in scope. In a magical time of old Japan, a time when demons walk the earth, Wakuraba Izumo (Ichikawa) is a powerful Demon Warden, who is charged with seeking out and killing demons where he can find them.  His faith in himself is shaken one day when he accidentally kills a young girl. Abandoning his host, he loses himself as an actor in the kabuki theater, a place where you past makes no difference.  Into this world comes Bizan (Higuchi Kanako from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ronin-Gai/dp/B00097DXTO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ronin Gai</a>), a queen of demons who wants to awaken the reincarnated Ashura and bring Hell to Earth.  Bizan is aided by Jaku, a demon warder gone rogue, and thousands of green-blooded demons. Izumo finds a companion and love interest in the beautiful thief Tsubaki (Miyazawa Rie from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Twilight-Samurai/dp/B00065GX0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Twilight Samurai</a>), who might just be the person Bizan is searching for.

""Ashura"" is a fantastic film, but not 100% successful. Japan has never really got a handle on the martial arts fantasy film, although there have been improvements over the years.  There are some great strides here in special effects, and getting Ichikawa for the role was a true coup. Only someone with kabuki experience could have pulled off the role, especially the scenes of Izumo as a kabuki actor.  The story is epic, with flaming skies and demon armies and a scale that has never been attempted in Japanese film before.  It is an awesome spectacle.

That is its problem at the same time, however. One of the thrills of kabuki is the special effects, those moments of stage-craft that blow you mind when they are performed live in front of you.  Something that produces wonderment in real life, like the burning city of Tokyo and a floating castle, just doesn't have the same impact when summoned up by computer skills.

As an adapted kabuki play, the action and story are pure melodrama, which is something I love.  Anyone expecting a ""straight"" film needs to do some research on kabuki before they check this out, to give them a better idea of what to expect.  Animeigo has helped you out by producing a beautiful DVD to go along with the ground-breaking film, including and extra disk with features on the original play and its adaptation.  As always, Animeigo continues to create the best subtitles in the business that include pop-up cultural notes along with the regular dialog, creating a whole package that can be used to study this bit of Japanese culture while watching a great flick.",1231718400,30,3938,5.842931937172775
2603739,5,B000GAL3XC,"I love this film, and i love Kabuki theatre as well. Its an old japanese tell about love and the end of the world. The cool thing is this story was originally made as a play and the main character in this movie is a traditional Kabuki theatre actor. He even plays the same character in the theatre. This guy brings a warm element of Kabuki in this movie and i cannot stress it enough.

You will love this movie. The graphics aren't too cheesy and the beauty of some of backdrops will stick in your mind. Even the music adds to the film and gives it a soul.

You will not be disappointed. It may be graphic for the young ones as it has sex and violence. id give it more than 5 stars as if i could but i cant!

you won't be disappointed a must have for Japanese culture, play\theatre,  and mythology enthusiasts .",1206489600,20,811,4.146496815286624

2603815,4,B000GAL3XC,"Ashura-jo no Hitomi is one of those wildly creative films that is definitely not for everyone.  The opening scenes featuring intentionally cheesy special effects put a lot of people off; however those who stay the course will be rewarded with beautiful and historically accurate depictions of Kabuki theater in old Edo (present day Tokyo).  The film is a star-vehicle for Kabuki idol Somegor Ichikawa from start to finish, but I also savored the nuanced performances of Atsuro Watabe as the deliciously evil Jaku-dono and Rie Miyazawa as the ill-starred Tsubaki just as much.  Know this going in: nothing is what it seems to be and it may take more than one viewing to make sense of the various twists and turns in the story.",1457136000,,725,4.830645161290323

Rating = ***
Director:  Youjirou Takita
Producer:  Shuji Miyajima
Streaming
2005

Film = barely three (3) stars; production value = four (4.0) stars.  Director Youjirou Takita unleashes a dynamic period fantasy that seems to be targeting just about all ages.  This is a spectacular Shochiku Company production loaded with foreground/background CGI effects and samurai-style sword swinging.  It is also spectacularly plain silly (and boringly repetitious) rarely rising above the level of a cartoon populated (for the most part) by actresses/actors  (vice digital composites thereof).  The Director seems to have given his cast free rein resulting in uniformally  melodramatic and hammy performances.  Cinematography (semi-wide screen, color) is excellent and editing is crisp.  But scene lighting can be a bit on the dark side (perhaps to disguise digital shortfalls?).  Sound field is good.  Subtitles are okay and use multiple colors for translational clarity (there is also a bit of expository information [in white] at the top of the screen regarding demonology during the Edo period of history).  Fun to watch for almost 30 minutes.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1453075200,,1316,5.467661691542289
2603821,4,B000GAL3XC,True love is hell. Seems the Japanese get it. Nothing can awaken a soul better than its willingness to die for love.......just like Italian opera. Turandot comes to mind. A very pleasurable bit of story telling with great depth.,1451692800,,228,4.871794871794871
2603822,4,B000GAL3XC,"The story is ok; I'm not so crazy about the costumes, yeah, all love has a bit of hate added for spice.
I don't particularly like the costumes - I think they're too costume-ish and anime influenced.
You would think that oni, kami, etc. would have better designers on staff.
BUT Somegoro-san is soo hot !
He's great live on the Kabuki stage too. If for no other reason, watch it for him.",1447286400,,386,4.301369863013699

2603837,4,B000GAL3XC,"A demon hunter fights demons in Edo era Japan and unintentionally unleashes an goddess who wants to destroy Japan. (Why does everyone want to destroy Japan?) Not a bad movie. Not really a horror movie (although there is blood and demons). Not exactly an action movie (although there are swordfights). And not exactly a love story. There are some cheezy moments where the story goes from fanciful to ridiculous, but it's actually pretty fun to watch, moves with a great tempo and holds your attention.

2603939,2,B000GAL3XC,They should have hired actors to do the English translations some parts sounded like someone just read from a manuscript with no feeling at all,1391299200,,143,4.76
2603940,4,B000GAL3XC,"This movie was very enjoyable; however, it seemed really long. The story drug out on and on towards the end.",1390953600,2,108,4.45
2603941,5,B000GAL3XC,"While not a direct adaption, like Ran is of King Lear, Ashura does have many elements of Shakespearean tragedy. Its combination of comedy and tragedy, fate and choice, as well as the play within a play elements all seem to be nods to The Bard. For those belittling its ""cheesiness,"" perhaps a better understanding of kabuki theater, which is a key element and played upon throughout, would be in order. Enjoyed it very much. Definitely recommended.",1390348800,,448,4.907894736842105
2603942,1,B000GAL3XC,"Seriously, it starts out a bit fractured but starts to get much more watchable.  However, the action is rather uninspired, the story is pretty simplistic and the effects don't come anywhere near creating the illusion of a magical world, they rather do more to remind you this is all fake.  The backdrops are somewhat cheesy looking (except when they are in buildings) and the dialogue is pretty dead-ended.  You have to be pretty dedicated to this sort of stylized Japanese magic/kabuki drama...  might be good for some fans of anime but not for Kurosawa or martial-art-hungry fans.

All that being said, the story does start to move along rather than just burping in random directions, but it is just not that interesting, mysterious or even entertaining.  Maybe I would change my review if I watched more than 40 minutes, but I could not drag myself into doing it.

Big fan of Seven Samurai, Sanjuro, Yojimbo, etc...  and on the Anime side, classics like Akira and Ninja Scroll.  Just could not get into this.",1390176000,,1011,4.797687861271676

2603945,5,B000GAL3XC,"The one thing about Asian films that differ from American is the need to explain plot. Westerners tend to look at it as awkward, preferring to just skip over what cannot be explained visually. That's just my explanation of why some complain about the pace.
Putting that aside, I really liked Ashura. It combined the classic elements of supernatural beings meddling in human affairs, a major theme from that side of the globe. I'm no native or expert, but I do know a well told story that makes use of available technology to present a thoughtful experience. This is it. Yes, it does have adult themes that don't conform with Victorian standards, but that is part of the presentation.
The music is modern with a traditional theme and works with the story well. The colors and overall feel is outstanding. Acting is great. Some folks didn't like it that much, but I did, take it for what it's worth.",1389657600,,897,4.647798742138365

2603968,5,B000GAL3XC,"To those brought up with childish Hollywood films designed to brainwash kindergarteners, it's hard to understand the logic of this one - there is none in there. Logic is a western concept. Love and hatred are connected through an inseparable thread. Possess her love, dead or live. Those who read the The Chrysanthemum and the Sword by a sociologist, who never set a foot on the islands, may think they understand the Japanese culture and they're totally misguided. To the Japanese, death is an art, ""destruction brings resurrection"". Demonic world or human world and reality or play, it's all the same.",1389052800,,603,4.98019801980198

The combat sequences are brilliantly choreographed,  although the CGI enhancements perhaps a bit overdone at times.  Overall a great movie!",1388448000,,336,5.423076923076923
2603972,4,B000GAL3XC,"I really wasn't expecting much from this movie, especially after the first few opening scenes, but it was actually pretty good.  There's some quirkiness to get used to, especially if you're not used to kabuki and those types of epics, but once you get it, the movie doesn't disappoint.  You will be disappointed if you're looking for a straight up action/martial arts/samurai flick.  Think more along the lines of epic opera, going in, and you'll be straight.",1388016000,,459,4.935064935064935
2603973,5,B000GAL3XC,"I've never seen Kabuki, loved this just the same, I was glued to the screen throughout.  In fact, I watched the entire movie without realizing it was subtitled, so absorbed was I.  Love is tinged with obsession, all-consuming, it just might destroy you.  It made little sense logically, spoke on a deeper, more primal level perhaps.  Stunning imagery, great special effects (though the fight scenes were just ok).  For me the personality of Izumo, the male lead, and the fantastic beauty and imagery made the film.

Demons are apparently the Japanese equivalent of zombies.  This film well walks that delicate line between passion, tragedy, fantasy and being tongue in cheek (reminded me of a favorite TV show,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crow-Stairway-To-Heaven-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000OCY7OO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crow: Stairway To Heaven - The Complete Series</a>, starring Mark Dacascos, part Japanese with a decided Kabuki sensibility).

2603974,3,B000GAL3XC,"Not weird because I am not used to Asian cinema, watched it my entire lifetime.  Weird because nothing is really explained and it falls outside of lines of a satisfying conclusion.  Logic need not apply to this movie.  Visually it was satisfying, but cheesy in some area.  SPOILER ALERT:  For the demon to be reborn, she has to first be killed as a child, then reborn and fall in love. OKKK!  Then after being transformed she some how hates the guy who she loved just a minute ago and tries to murder him in various ways (can we say multiple personality disorder?) with ending lines like ""Your blood taste so delicious!""  UMmmmm Yeah!  In between she murders her loyal, demon servant Bizan through some intricated plot because ""death brings resurrection"" or something weird line like that.  I never understood why that was necessary.  Was it to illustrate she's pure evil?  Was she going to kill all the demons as the demon queen?  What was her real purpose?  But we never found out because her quasi-love/hate lover battled her in an epic sword fight in her demon castle...then they both died in a parallel engulfing of orgasmic love and hate.  Supposedly, there was a lot of symbolism in the movie.  I just didn't get it or understood any potential depth originally intended.",1387497600,7,1277,4.714932126696833
