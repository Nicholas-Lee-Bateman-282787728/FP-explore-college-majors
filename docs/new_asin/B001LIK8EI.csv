3683704,5,B001LIK8EI,"...and what fun they are!  Am really glad there's a third installment in the Donald Strachey series that has made it to movies.  And just like the other two movies, this one is just as entertaining and well acted, produced and filmed.  Chad Allen does another wonderful job as the private I Donald Strachey, along with his lover, played by Sebastian Spence.  This time, we also get Margot Kidder added in, who does a really good job, as well as the rest of the cast.  Plus I love that they are produced and directed really well- a lot of times 'gay' movies appear low budget and cheap, but these always look really well made and professional, just like a big budget Hollywood film.
  I know that there are quite a few books in this series, and I really hope that they ALL get made into movies, starring Chad of course.  The more movies I see him in, the more I recognize what a really good actor he is.  Plus, hopefully these movies can find thier way out to a more mainstream audience.  They're well written and shot, and hopefully they can educate people who harbor certain stereotypes of gay people that we're just like everyone else, and that gay cinema is expanding and covering all the same subject matters as mainstream cinema.  Keep em coming!!!",1235779200,15,1253,4.524444444444445
3683705,5,B001LIK8EI,"A very enjoyable movie, one I would definitely watch again.  The cast is terrific, and I was thrilled with all of the performances, especially Margot Kidder.
All the movies in this series are well done, but this one is my favorite.  Great directing, acting, dialogue, story, etc., it's just a winner!",1235520000,12,300,4.862745098039215
3683706,5,B001LIK8EI,"I was so pleased to hear that Chad Allen is returning as gay detective Donald Strachey in a third film. I've seen both ""Third Man Out"" & ""Shock to the System"" and was knocked out by Allen's terrific performances. As Strachey, he's torn down stereotypes of the limp-wristed homosexual, proving you can be gay, proud & tough at the same time.
Even more pleasing is his monogamous devotion to his partner, Tim Callahan, shattering the other myth that gay men don't know how to commit.
Kudos to Here! TV for bringing this fine series to the public. I've heard from another reviewer that two more films are being planned. Keep 'em coming!",1230076800,27,633,4.660714285714286
3683707,5,B001LIK8EI,I enjoyed this gay detective story and would recommend this DVD to anyone who likes a good mystery.  It's refreshing to see gay people treated as a normal couple.,1380499200,,162,4.586206896551724
3683708,5,B001LIK8EI,Another fantastic one from the series and it truly leaves you wanting more and more. Chad Allen is really at his best in this role and lets hope they make the last two books.,1379980800,,174,4.147058823529412
3683709,5,B001LIK8EI,"What you think is happening is not really so.  This movie has so many twists and turns, it stays exciting from beginning to end.  Highly recommended.",1367280000,,149,4.6923076923076925

3683711,5,B001LIK8EI,"I have enjoyed all The Donald Strachey Mystery, but this one by far is the best one. Great story line, and amazing acting. The Case was amazaing, and as always Chad Allen was ""spot on"".",1306281600,,185,4.314285714285714
3683712,5,B001LIK8EI,"Having never seen any of the Donald Strachey Mystery movies, I decided to order this and see what it was like. The preview available on the Amazon page looked interesting. I loved this film. I found it entertaining, suspenseful, and funny in some spots. It wasn't cheesy like some of the gay themed movies that I have purchased in the past. I loved it so much I plan on getting the rest of the Donald Strachey movies.",1288224000,,417,4.428571428571429
3683713,5,B001LIK8EI,"These are not low budget bad actor maudlin movies, they are mainstream murder mysteries with good dialogue, good acting and bang up plots that do not leave you wincing at being preached at but plots that interest, engage and leave you wishing for another in the series!  Maybe similar to a ""Jesse Stone"" mystery series? (but NOT with a one note main character like the Jesse Stone series has) Anyway, as a mystery fan, I hope for more (and hope they will be region 1 so I can buy them too!)",1279411200,,490,4.384615384615385
3683714,5,B001LIK8EI,"Owning the first two Donald Strachey movies, I was anxious to get my hands on the third in the series. I'm NOT disappointed. Chad Allen's mannerisms remind me a little of Columbo. I was totally caught up in the ""who-done-it"". I wish and hope there are several more coming as these three movies I can watch multiple times and enjoy them.",1276300800,,336,4.524590163934426
3683715,4,B001LIK8EI,"The Donald Strachey Mysteries
~Third Man Out
~Shock to the System
~On the Other Hand Death
A Gay Detective? Yes I was a bit apprehensive; however I soon discovered a cleaver story with likable characters, Martinis and an almost Columbo style detective show with a gay edge and Full Frontal Nudity (what more do you need). These Movies were Fun, Intriguing, Heartwarming, Suspenseful and Humorous, with a Showering of Eye Candy and Fabulous Guest Stars. We Want More Strachey Mysteries...it's a fun Friday Night After Work Movie.",1256515200,,528,5.080459770114943
3683716,5,B001LIK8EI,"Excellent movie - thought-provoking, superbly-acted... and yes, incredibly sexy.  The whole Donald Strachey series is superb!  TREMENDOUS kudos to Chad Allen, who is truly an inspiration, in life and on-screen.  Also, of course, many thanks to the screenwriter, the director, AND the actors for putting together a believable portrayal of a healthy, long-term, monogamous gay relationship between two characters who are far from perfect, but who are all the more endearing for being vulnerable and human and susceptible to the same insecurities and jealousies that we all face.  Waiting eagerly for the next installment in the series....",1255392000,2,636,5.525773195876289
3683717,5,B001LIK8EI,Of the three Chad Allen (Donald Strachey Movies) I own this one is by far my favorite.  It continues to show a good loving relationship between Donald and Timothy but also hooks you into the mystery of what is happening to everyone else.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone one who loves Chad Allen.,1253145600,,302,4.472727272727273
3683718,5,B001LIK8EI,The best of those released so far in the US. Can't wait for Ice Blues to be released on DVD here in the US.,1252800000,,107,3.5
3683719,5,B001LIK8EI,"I cant explain how happy I am to have discover these movies....good plot, good director, great actors and lots of fun....what else do you need?!?!?",1248998400,,147,4.92
3683720,5,B001LIK8EI,All the novels & movies in this series have been entertaining and of very good quality.  I can hardly wait for the next one.,1245196800,,124,4.166666666666667
3683721,1,B001LIK8EI,"What a disappointment, on so many levels. The writing was stitled and bland, the actors seemed leaden. Missing was the personal interaction between Don and Timmy that was so much fun in the first two. The jealousy plot (what there was of it) which cried out for witty word play, was a dead horse.  Even the music was dull. Production values on the DVD were mediocre, and at times, especially bad.  Chad Allen and Sebastian Spence deserved better writing than this. Skip this one and watch the first two, ""Shock to the System"" and ""Third Man Out.""",1239840000,5,546,4.618556701030927
3683722,5,B001LIK8EI,"The third movie in the Don Strachey Mystery series is ""On the Other Hand, Death"". Chad Allen plays the gay detective Strachey. Like the first two, this is a good mystery story, well acted, and well produced. I'm looking at the suggested ""tags"" for my review and see that except for ""Chad Allen"" and ""Margot Kidder"" they all include ""gay"". I guess that still matters, but it's not the point or the focus of the movie or the series. The mystery would be just as interesting if Strachey were straight, and maybe that's the point. Being gay (or not) is not what life's about and it's not what the movie is about either. Want to watch a good mystery? Watch this one; then get the first two and watch them. Fourth movie coming soon!",1239494400,2,726,4.425373134328358
3683723,5,B001LIK8EI,"I started getting the Donald Strachey mysteries with Chad Allen about a year ago.  I find them interesting and well done.  I think this one has the widest appeal.  And the plot twists are more believable if no less shocking.  Chad Allen is not a standard detective - he actually gets beaten up, he's gay, and he's also not always right at the drop of a hat.  The surprise here is the re-emergence of Margot Kidder (Lois Lane to Christopher Reeve's Superman) in a far more mature and gritty portrayal of an older Lesbian.  She makes the character have both strength and weaknesses.  It is a subtle portrayal.  If it carries with it some of the turmoil Ms. Kidder has gone through herself, that's all to the better.
I look forward to more in this series.",1239235200,2,752,4.477941176470588
3683724,4,B001LIK8EI,"Chad Allen is back as gay private investigator Donald Strachey in the third made-for-cable film based on Richard Stevenson's mystery series. This time a lesbian couple is being harassed and their home vandalized. Are they victims of homophobia or something else? Margot Kidder plays strong-willed Dorothy, a high-school guidance counselor who refuses to be intimidated. Her partner, Edith (wonderfully played by Gabrielle Rose) has a secret in her past that might or might not be contributing to the happenings. Sebastian Spence is back as Tim, Strachey's husband and a guy Tim once dated is visiting the area and stirring things up everywhere he goes. These films are light and formulaic with enough intrigue and suspense to keep the viewer guessing. They effectively capture the feel of the tough detective novels they are based on. The production values are good and the acting is excellent.",1238371200,7,894,5.215277777777778
3683725,5,B001LIK8EI,"This is the best of the (so far) three Donald Strachey Mystery movies. The second installation was almost as good though. This one has Margot Kidder as a school counselor that is harrassed by her community. There's a lot of mystery and intrigue in this movie, but I won't ruin it for you. Know this though, if you are a fan of either the Donald Strachey movies, Margot Kidder, or Chad Allen this movie is for you!",1236643200,2,413,4.376623376623376

8318164,5,B001LIK8EI,Great series.,1414540800,,13,6.0
8318165,4,B001LIK8EI,"Chad Allen, need I say more? He has this character down to a science. He excels with this part, the stories and a lot of fun as are the supporting characters, well, I may get grief for this but the Sebastian Spence character I tend to find annoying. I will toss another criticism out there...Margot Kidder? Really? She has always been a rotten actress and she still is. She just tries too hard and it doesn't work, not as Lois Lane(She was horrifyingly bad) not in this. Even in spite of those shortcomings, I did love this movie. I did see the resolution coming a mile away but it was very fun. Chad Allen.....so good. I just saw him in a movie called ""Hollywood, Je T'aime"" he is just so charismatic.",1413244800,,702,4.366412213740458

8318167,5,B001LIK8EI,this was a great movie if they would have never said gay so much in the movie it would have been even better you no he's gay why do you have to keep telling yourself lol,1389052800,,169,3.7222222222222223
8318168,5,B001LIK8EI,"Correction - ""On the Other Hand, Death"" is actually the FOURTH and last movie made in the series.  The confusion is caused because the third, ""Ice Blues"" had a delayed DVD release.  Another thing that really surprises me is that the Chinese actor who plays Strachey's side kick in all four films, is never mentioned in cast lists, nor in Amazon reviews - nor on the DVD covers, for that matter - and he was a really fun addition to the series, real charming guy - who has a picture of Key Luke on his desk, who was Charlie Chan's side-kick in the early Hollywood Charlie Chan films (never noted in any of the ""Backlot"" comments on the DVDS).  The whole Donald Strachey series is the greatest - the people (actors--many well-known) add real color to the films. . . Margot Kidder, Morgan Fairchild . . .
