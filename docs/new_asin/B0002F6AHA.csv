2088316,5,B0002F6AHA,have this on dvd. everyone give him  a shot. watched him over and over again. as a late teen got into him. he's timeless with his blend of comedy and his brand of humor. just one thing though. he really did appreciate women in real life. so don't go treating them like he did. cuz for one it's just not for a man to be that way. and it's only funny in the movies cuz they're not real. no woman should ever be treated that way. Benny made very good points in his humor. some just might not of caught it. I'm sad he passed away years ago. but his legacy of comedy will live on forever.,1109203200,,583,3.982905982905983
2088317,3,B0002F6AHA,"It should probably get five stars for allowing us to view the original programs, but this collection is a bit disappointing in that there are flaws (that white box in the upper left corner, some specks looking like water droplets, etc.).  Hardcore fans will want this to add to their set, and I look forward to the remainder of the collections.  You will see some B&W versions of skits later broadcast in color (but I did not time them to see if the color ones are edited).  Benny Hill was a comic genius and he is listed as the only writer which is a tribute to his vast range.  If you are not a hardcore fan, you will probably be satisfied with the 'Golden' series, which contain just the skits.  If you are a fan of Benny Hill, then this set has the shows as they were presented in England.  I am basing the three star rating on value to the ordinary Benny Hill fan.  As a comic, Benny Hill is clearly five stars.",1107820800,6,916,4.2298850574712645
2088318,5,B0002F6AHA,"But he transcends the Euro-feel. He is truly the master of laughter. And I mean gut-wrenching laughter. I first saw Benny (Alfie) Hill in the early eighties syndicated in the U.S.

I often wondered why he wasn't as popular as Monty Python in the states. It's because the shows were edited to 1/2 hours...stripping nearly 1/2 the content.

As I watch the shows now, as they were meant, a clear narrative comes through. Take the amazing ""European Song Contest"" where he plays about 10 characters. Or the hilarious ""Wrestler"" sequence.

Yes, there are some anomolies as previously stated but they are of very short duration...certainly bearable.",1105488000,3,642,5.037735849056604
2088319,5,B0002F6AHA,"The cost of this set is some of the best money I've spent recently.  It's wonderful to see these shows in their original format, with lots of material that was never spliced into the US half-hour shows.  For example, the first episode has a brilliant sendup of the Eurovision song contest which I don't recall having seen before - they probably left it off the US shows thinking that we wouldn't get the joke.

Also, most of the songs and recitations from the hilarious ""Words and Music"" LP are featured in these shows, including Benny's only hit single, ""Ernie,"" which debuted on one of the black and white episodes.

Fans of the great BBC radio game show ""Just a Minute"" will be interested that chairman Nicholas Parsons appears as Benny's straight man in the early shows- the role later taken over by Henry McGee.

I'm putting in my order now for volume two.",1102291200,7,861,4.601307189542483
2088320,5,B0002F6AHA,I'm so pleased to see this set come out. I was so tired of all the lame best of discs that came out. I did notice a few transfer flaws as mentioned by others. The yellow band and some audio drops and wobbles. Also did anyone notice a little white box in the upper corners on a few episodes? I'm still happy with the set and cant wait for the rest!!,1102204800,4,348,3.915492957746479
2088321,5,B0002F6AHA,"The A&E Collection Of 'Benny Hill Complete And Unadulterated - The Naughty Early Years, Set One (1969 - 1971) is an absolute treasure to fans of this beloved, chubby, moon-faced comedian!

 These are the very first episodes American TV audiences viewed of Benny Hill, when he was at the peak of his comic genius.  Benny Hill is young, surprisingly slender in these shows and full of vitality, and energy missing from his twilight shows some twenty years later.

 Here we can see the entire 'Benny Hill Show' special as it appeared on Thames Television in Great Britain, completely unedited.  The shows boast first-rate musical numbers usually performed by Benny's in-house quartet of female singers, the Ladybirds, and Hill's brilliant comedy.  American viewers will recognize some of the sketches, but be astonished as to how much material was edited out for American syndication, primarily for time considerations.

 I always loved the delightful, and hilarious sketch, 'The European Song Of The Year Contest', which is in the very first special of the 11 included on this three-disc set. Here the sketch has several more contestants added, and a finale that was always deleted from the USA version.  Even the order of the scenes in the sketches was juggled by the American editor!  There are really only a few moments where a skit or gag was dropped because of raciness or poor taste.

  There are also three black & white specials included on this set that were never broadcast in any form to American television, as USA audiences are generally loathe to watch anything not in color!

  What is also remarkable about these broadcasts is that the beautiful women on the show clearly take a backseat to comedy and music!  There are still no ""Hill's Angels"" as of yet, just lovely ladies appearing in the hilarious comedy skits.

  This is the very best of Benny Hill, and the sharp clear copies of his shows, are truly 'old gold' to fans of the great comedian!",1096416000,46,1962,4.867069486404834
2088322,5,B0002F6AHA,"Wow!

This is a great package that shows the Benny Hill Shows in their original format with the neat bonus of 3 b/w episodes that contains some of his best work. It's a real treat to see these 11 shows as well as sketches never seen on American TV. The picture quality is beautiful as one would expect from DVDs and worth it.

Concerning the yellow band across the screen mentioned in the review below by Halo Jones- it's not a flaw at all in the DVD process since that was also present in his show when it aired on television. I always thought it was to try to make the effect of Henry McGee's face of him ""glowing"". I might be wrong, but with Benny Hill being a master in visual gigs I just always thought that was why that ""weird visual hit"" occurred. :) In that time, he was experimenting with visual gigs and in today's standard it might be weird, but in that time it was a big thing.

I really hope more sets are released from ""The Benny Hill Show""! :)",1093478400,10,958,4.167567567567567
2088323,4,B0002F6AHA,"The show does look better than it should (after all these years) but, after watching just the first episode, there are clearly some flaws.  Sound goes in and out on a couple of sketches and there are some weird visual hits such as, in one instance, a yellow band across the screen.  This shouldn't put fans off - or even casual buyers - but be warned it's not as perfect as some would say.  The content is, of course though, pure classic Hill, so ultimately you do get what you pay for!",1093392000,10,486,4.260869565217392
2088324,5,B0002F6AHA,"As a longtime fan of The Benny Hill Show and author of a book about Benny called ""Benny Hill, This Life of Laughter"" currently in production. I can happily say the A&E new DVD release of Benny Hill Naughty Years set one..is fantastic. The transfers are clean and fantastic. It the way Benny should be seen. Naturally the way Ron Gold and DL Tafner brought Benny to America was indeed the right way by giving us the half hour edited down versions for speed and removing the regional jokes and musical numbers...but NOW after 20 years since Benny burst on the American tv scene, this is what hardcore Hill fans have been waiting for. The complete unedited hour long shows. They attention to detail is terrific. Let's hope that A&E means it when they say ""Set one"" and look for many more sets to follow.  I know the fans will not be disapointed in this at all, not like the lukewarm Golden great series. These deliver, nicely package. I have been watching mine since yesterday!

Definatley worth the full price!

Finally we get the full versions that were condensed and slightly sanitized for American audiences. The picture quality has been fully restored to a pristine state by A&E. I don't know why Benny Hill's brand of comedy was deemed sexist, by some sections of British and international interest groups. Frankly, his comedy was harmless and not malicious in any way! Especially when compared with today's sophomoric junk! People should lighten-up, and learn to laugh for a change! This is pure magic, brings back so many great memories, well worth it.

If you're a fan of British comedy, particulary the outrageous this set will make a great addition.  You'll find his bawdy antics will make you laugh time after time again. From dressing in drag to the rude Chinaman, Benny Hill does it well.

True, there are some truly hilarious sketches but I far prefer the Hill's Angels years, perhaps because I remember those the first time around.
The format of these early shows invariably included a long forgotten variety act of no humorous content so you'll be fast forwarding a lot.
My advice is, buy the sets in reverse order starting with the mid-eighties stuff then stop when you've had enough.

2088439,4,B0002F6AHA,"Most Americans were introduced to Benny Hill in the very late '70s/ early '80's as a syndicated program sold to independent stations called ""The Benny Hill Show"". This show was a compilation of sorts- bits and pieces of Benny's Thames TV specials (which averaged about once a month in England) were assembled as episodes for American TV. The skits that involved regional UK humor, very thick British accents, and the 'celebrity' musical acts were generally left out- only skits 'acceptable' for American audiences were included (oddly enough, the bawdy humor and even nudity were deemed 'acceptable'!).
  Now, A&E have released Benny's Thames specials complete and uncut. Some may find these a bit unsettling, as some skits can scarcely be understood (due to thick accents and material referencing UK personas little-known to Americans) and the 'celebrity' musical/dancing guests leave much to be desired. Still, these are the specials that the American Benny Hill Show was culled from, and should be of great interest to any Benny Hill fan.
  Season one is NOT the Benny Hill you may remember. This set comprises the specials from 1969-1971, so this was pretty early on. While their are hints of the bawdy humor that would become Benny's trademark, the humor in this set is quite tame really. That shouldn't keep any Benny fans from viewing this set though, as Benny's wit is razor sharp here. Clever comedy songs (as always), Benny's double entendres (when they were still original!), and funny slapstick skits are all here for your enjoyment. This is where Benny really started to become the comedian that is a worldwide legend. While later seasons would become more risque (much to the delight of Benny fans everywhere), season one offers a glimpse of a comedian who sparkles with originality and enthusiasm. That alone is worth checking out season one for.
  A&E has done a great job with these DVD sets. The picture looks as good as it did when these specials were originally broadcast, and releasing these sets UNCUT is especially appreciated by all hardcore Benny fans. My one complaint with these sets (and it is a MAJOR one) is that there are NO SUBTITLES! Much of the show involves thick English accents. While I am very practiced in deciphering these, I'm sure many Americans are going to have great difficulty understanding what is being said (especially important since a lot of Benny's humor is very nuanced, like the extensive use of double entendres). Please A&E, subtitle all future sets! Still, if you can understand the dialogue (it comes with practice), this is a good set to begin your Benny Hill experience.
  By the way, if you are one of those humorless people who think Benny is just an unfunny 'dirty old man': GET A LIFE. I'm sure you make everyone around you miserable with your pathetic lack of humor (and why are you here reading this, anyway?). LONG LIVE BENNY HILL!!!!!
Season one is RECOMMENDED FOR ALL BENNY FANS!",1147132800,28,2948,4.929435483870968

Unknown to me, the original Benny Hill Show was a 1 hour format. What we got in the US were cut down  hour programs. This set contains the full, original programs and they are outstanding.

I remember Benny Hill as a comedian. He is. I remembered his show as a comedy show. It was but it was also a variety show and contains some dated, but good examples of 70s style and song.

Hill's genius is in playing with language. His puns, double entendres and rhymes are masterful. What is even more remarkable is that he manages to do so much with other languages as well. Some is real, some is nonsense but just enough comes through to make it hilarious in English as well.

Besides his gift for language, Hill and his crew were masters of sight gags. Much of their comedy is physical. This too works and is timeless.

2088443,4,B0002F6AHA,"Great shows.  Watch Python when you're twenty.  Watch Mr Bean when you're thirty.  Watch Benny Hill when you're forty.

But here the DVD transfer has the occasional strange little box of digital breakup on it.  This wouldn't bother so much except the same skits can be seen on BBC America without the digital breakup - so this is just sloppiness on the DVD transfer - nothing to do with quality of source material.  Also, shouldn't these shows be in a 1.66:1 aspect ratio of British television?  A@E persists in putting everything into American fullscreen mode.  It didn't bother me too much with The Prisoner and The Avengers, but many jokes in Benny Hill begin with seeing a billboard or movie credit read one way, only to have it read something else when the camera pulls back.  Such jokes are ruined if the show isn't in its original aspect ratio.  Would it kill A@E to give us the choice?

Still, at least these shows represent something like completeness.  I'm not convinced, however, since there is one episode where Benny mentions a skit in last week's show, a skit that doesn't seem to be on the DVDs.

Still, I'll buy them all, given the chance.",1123200000,9,1155,4.630541871921182

8027416,5,B0002F6AHA,"What a droll and tongue-in-cheek comedian he was.  Nothing in America compares.  The quality of the DVD was great.  We take things like this on camping trips with us where the TV reception is poor.  It is a great backup, funny and fun, especially when family join us who have never seen/heard of Benny.",1484438400,,302,4.537037037037037

8027420,2,B0002F6AHA,"This package is Benny Hill. However it is either the way they cut a particular program for this presentation or the show is not quite as amusing as I remember.

What I was expecting was more like what is that in the road? A head and what is this thing called? Love.

Im not sure it would be worth your time to watch this presentation if you have positive memories of Benny Hill.",1468108800,,378,4.164383561643835
