1340393,5,B00004DS8Y,"Although it was alot different to the series, I still enjoyed the movie. Some bits were sad but some were pretty funny too. You can make your own mind about it but in my mind, it's a movie that some people can relate to. The situations that the characters get themselves into are so real that you can relate to what their going to. I'm glad that I bought the video and I'm glad that I own it on video. Schools out is number one in my book. A must for a teen who is going through those changes that the characters went through.",972864000,,526,4.0673076923076925
1340394,5,B00004DS8Y,"I have to admit that I know what other people think of this ending to the journey through life with these kids.  When sitting back to ponder my own  quest for knowledge in life, I am reminded many times that life does, in  fact, turn out this way.  How many of us have made all the right choices?  Not a one that I can think of.  This was a fitting end in my mind to a  classic and entertaining series.  Pat Mastrioni aka Joey Jeremiah proves to  us that he is a talented and wonderful actor by showing us how great he  pulls off the part of the snake.  I still love him and always will.",967766400,,587,3.9741379310344827
1340395,2,B00004DS8Y,"....I must say that I was greatly disappointed and let down by the way the writers/producers chose to end such a fine series.  Most of the characters are accounted for here, and if you miss one of you favorites, chances are  you can catch a glimpse of him/her making a token appearance, dancing in  the backround during the final few scenes.  The main problem is that these  characters, characters that we've come to know and love so well over the  years, have been made very dark in this sorry video.  Deceit, vengence,  petty jealousy, and overall stupidity are the main virtues within the  characters of the Degrassi 'kids', now.  Without giving away plot  specifics, here are a couple of examples to better illustrate my point:  Joey, after having come so far in the way of 'growing up', does a complete  180 in this movie, and sinks to even greater depths of deceit by cheating  on the ever trusting and unsuspecting Caitlin.  He is made out to be an  incredibly insensitive, lying weasel in this video.  Meanwhile, Derek  'Wheels' Wheeler also suffers a major downturn -- again, after rebounding  from so many other setbacks during the regular series -- that makes the  viewer cry out to the writers ""WHY CAN'T YOU GIVE THIS POOR KID A  BREAK?  HASN'T HE BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH? "".  It looks very bad for  poor Wheels. We are left with the knowledge that our friend will not have  an easy time of it, and that's very unfair.  It was unfair of the writer(s)  to paint a none too rosey future for several of the Degrassi kids.  Yes,  life is often-times unfair, but it was just a movie.  A movie which should  have bid a very fond farewell to these good kids.  Call it fantasy (wait a  minute -- it IS fantasy, isn't it?  I mean, they could have ended any way  they wanted to) but I would have appreciated a good'ol- fashion happy  ending for one and ALL.  They deserved it, after  having been so kind in  helping us better educate our children.  I do appreciate Playing With  Time's effort, but I am forced to, at least in my own mind, re-write their  Degrassi Movie.  Mine has a much happier ending.

1340396,5,B00004DS8Y,"The makers of the Degrassi series must be incredibly proud of themselves. I saw every single episode back home in Puerto Rico and I can say it had a huge influence in my life. The show dealt with themes which mirrored things  going on around me; it was a wonderful way to see that everything I was  going through was indeed, normal and it also presented me with different  ways to deal with each  situation. The final episode was true to its  spirit. I was rather sad at all the different twists and turns which befell  the characters but was pleasantly surprised with just how appropriate each  ending was. Wheel's,ending in particular, struck a chord (I won't spoil it  for those who haven't seen it). In short, it was great finally seeing the  last episode and getting reacquainted with Lucy, Snake, Wheels and of  course, Caitlin and Joey!",957312000,,843,4.635135135135135
1340397,5,B00004DS8Y,"I think if you liked Degrassi, you would love this movie.  I remember waiting for it to air back in 1990, even though I was really sad at the series' demise. I think Degrassi was a revolutionary program for tv,  because it showed that Canada could produce at least one good program.  tis  video is a must for any collector or fan of the show.",956534400,,342,4.2153846153846155
1340398,5,B00004DS8Y,"A truly superb video, I grew up with Degrassi from the shows the Kids of Degrassi, Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High. The Show tackled contemporary issues and ""Schools Out"" is the same, it tackles  some true to life subject manner. It does it in a way in which to inform,  educate and entertain. I am just sorry that it has taken me so long to  actually watch.",955929600,,365,4.338235294117647
1340399,5,B00004DS8Y,"as a MAJOR degrassi fan, i found this movie so wonderful! many degrassi fans should find this movie not only entertaining but amusing! the ending is surprising, yet powerful! a degrassi continuation not to miss!",955411200,,211,5.057142857142857
1340400,4,B00004DS8Y,"When I was 14, my favorite show was Degrassi High.  Being from the States, I was under the will of my local PBS station as to when it was on.  Ten years later, I have a few episodes on tape and enjoy them as much now as I  did then.  This movie is made different from the series itself,  but it a  fun  to visit the characters one last time.  I had a lot of fun watching  it, but I was very disapointed in the ending.  That's all I'll say.",951868800,11,439,3.7777777777777777

7920282,3,B00004DS8Y,"I didn't know about this movie until just a couple years ago. I heard so many bad/tragic details about it that I didn't want to see it but finally I was overcome with curiosity so I watched it on YouTube and I agree, it is very stupid and the characters act out of character but I guess that sells. So tragic about Wheels, he had been such a nice guy but he never held himself accountable for his bad decisions and always used his parents' death as an excuse to behave badly...however, pleading guilty is a good sign that he is facing up. Wow Canada must be pretty liberal. Where do they get all the beer? I think Lucy should have used better judgment and known better not to get in the car with a driver who constantly had a beer in his hand--Joey and Snake, too! Lucy is old enough, she should have offered to drive for Wheels. But, of course, it is a movie and if she had, it wouldn't be a movie. The people in the movie and living very frivilously and carelessly. Didn't anyone learn anything about the Great Depression which followed the wild roaring 20's? Oh well, that is what makes it a movie, like I said.",1295654400,,1114,4.259433962264151
7920283,5,B00004DS8Y,I bought this movie because I am a fan of Degrassi:TNG and became a big fan of this series and highly reccomend this for anyone 15+.,1195516800,,132,4.115384615384615
7920284,5,B00004DS8Y,"I am waiting for this to come out on DVD so I can buy it. I am waiting for the shipping to begin for my item to arrive.

I do however remember watching it on TV and really enjoying what our characters were up to. Its realistic and shows how a character has developed over the years and what happens to them all.

Let's just say some of the characters do have happy endings whilst others don't. I'm not gonna write anymore, you'll have to see it for yourself.

I suggest wait for the dvd release which will be out soon or you can go to [...] to find the dvd release and order it there.",1152316800,,584,4.017241379310345
7920285,4,B00004DS8Y,"I used to watch this on PBS when I was 14 and I actually only watched it because it aired right after my favorite program at the time and out of nowhere it had me hooked and began to be my new favorite program.

When the series was cancelled in '91 I was really sad because I got so caught up in these characters lives and I didn't want to see them go. And it got cancelled right when it started to get really interesting too. The character Duane had Aids, Wheels was getting back on track, Lucy found a boyfriend, LD had cancer (whatever did happend to her????)Caitlin and Joey were getting back together....I was heated.

I'd never heard of ""School's out"" until like the year 2000...8 years after! It's never been aired here in the USA and no one has ever talked about it. (Degrassi is a guilty pleasure by alot of people)

Thank god for the internet because I found Degrassi fans like myself and heard about it. So now I can see what happened after I was left hanging when it was cancelled. It's really a tough movie to get your hands on but I finally got it.

The stories didn't end up where I thought it would.

Alot of other main characters were missing:

Arthur, Melanie, Maya(the girl in the wheelchair)

Michelle, and a few other characters that I was used to seeing.

The story seemed to mostly surround Caitlin and Joey,with a few other tiny subplots ie, Simon and Alexa getting engaged,and the small speaking parts by cast regulars(mostly getting high or drunk believe it or not)

I was really shocked to hear them cursing using the ""F"" word...especially Caitlin.

We all had our favorite characters but I guess Caitlin and Joey were the reason this series was hot towards the end so the writers wrote a story around them.

Anyways I wanted more from this movie,and yet again just when it starts to get more interesting...it ends...again.

So thank god now for Nogin having Degrassi the next generation where we can still see our old degrassi characters and see how everything really turned out.

I can imagine seeing this movie back in '92 and thinking that's it forever for the Degrassi series. Well if you've been watching The Next generation and then watched ""School's out"" afterwards you won't go away with any sad feelings because as I said before you know what happens to your favorite main characters:

Joey: owner of Jeremiah Motors

Caitlin: Popular TV personality (who'd have thought)

Snake: A Teacher at Degrassi and now married to Spike (who'd have thought)

Spike:Owner of her own salon

Liz (Spike's cynical punk rocker friend)is now a Doctor

Lucy:is now an award making Filmaker (in real life as well)

My overall taking on this rare movie is that it will still not bring any closure to fans because it went where nobody thought it would in a sad ending...but it was still a realistic ending.",1151366400,,2822,4.594810379241517
7920286,5,B00004DS8Y,"I used to watch Degrassi when I was in like the 6th grade on PBS. I absolutely loved it~ then I forgot about it for many many years until now when I happened to catch it by mistake while flipping channels.

  I got hooked once again and was so glad to see that they made this final movie length finale.~ I was shocked to see them cursing and being bad like normal teenagers!! It was such a breath of fresh air. The story line was so well written and real. My faves were always Caitlyn and Joey~ and I was am so happy the movie mostly revolved around them. It would have been nice to see what happened to Melanie, Kathleen, Maya, Arthur, Dwayne (the kid that got AIDS). But I guess they weren't available to be a part of this super last episode.

  This movie is definitely a keeper! I am so glad I ordered it~ I hope to show this to my children one day.~",1134518400,3,854,4.083832335329341
7920287,5,B00004DS8Y,"Wow what a great ending for Degrassi, heart break, tragedy, and of course drama. Even if you ain't a fan of Degrassi, I reccomend people to watch.",1073174400,3,146,4.444444444444445
7920288,3,B00004DS8Y,"As all youngsters, growing up in the 80's was pretty hard, with all the happy pants and slap wrist bands that were abundant with that era, there was also rat's tails and mullets that we had to endure too. Amongst all this was a tv show that never disappointed. At 5.30 We were fixed to the tele and became best friends with the kids of degrassi. We watched until the end and the movie eclipsed all the heartbreak and joy that we all lived through with the series. If you were someone like me, who loved the series, you would enjoy the movie. If you weren't, you would probably say something like, ""It could have been better if..."" Anyway, it's good for a laugh to see how bad fashion in the 80's was, and to see if Snake finally used some phisohex on that acute acne.",1031443200,,767,4.260273972602739
7920289,5,B00004DS8Y,"I must agree with a previous poster; this is one of the best (if not THE best) series finales I've have ever seen in my life. I remember watching Degrassi when I was sixteen on PBS, and it had a stranglehold on my viewing habits. Only recently have knowledge of a final episode ""film"" has come to my light. With this movie, it breaks the shackles loose and pulls out all the stops with it's PG-13 style content. Excellent finality for Degrassi: The Saga. Stacie Mistysyn ROCKS!! CAITLIN FOREVER!!",1027036800,,496,4.584269662921348
