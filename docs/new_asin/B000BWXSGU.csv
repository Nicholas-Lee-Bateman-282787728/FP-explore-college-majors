8093610,5,B000BWXSGU,"You can't go wrong with any of the 50 packs! You may get a couple of duds, but who cares! Show me a better deal! Some reviews mentioned picture or sound quality being an issue. Hey! This is before they had dolby, hi-fi and all that! I assume most of the negative reviews come from younger folks who were raised on HD TV! I haven't had any problem listening or watching any of these movies! Sure there are a few places where there might have been a film splice, or the sound may be less than 2015 standards, but it's nothing that's really going to bother anyone except for the spoiled younger generation! I own close to 20 of these 50 packs and I'm glad I bought every single one of them!",1424390400,,687,4.212121212121212

8093612,5,B000BWXSGU,"This is a great deal and I passed the info on to my friends.  Some very good war movies, some are not so good but
overall this is worth the price I paid, thank you seller.",1399420800,,171,3.75
8093613,3,B000BWXSGU,"""50 War Classics"" offers an interesting mixture of official documentaries, newsreel footage, and a few period theatrical releases on the Second World War, on five two-sided DVDs.

The documentaries look like the official efforts they are, with footage of mixed quality and indifferent audio.  On the other hand, those knowledgeable of the war are likely to find moments of real interest in the collection.  There is a nice summary of the U.S. bombing campaign in Europe, including the Ploesti Raid.  ""Desert Victory"" features British and German footage of the campaing in North Africa from Al Alemayn, with speeches by British Generals Montgomery and Alexander.  ""Marines at Tarawa"" captures the bloody amphibious assault on a Japanese-held island in the Pacific.  ""Battle of San Pietro"" shows the tough terrain and tougher fighting of the Italian campaign.  The included theatrical movies were unfamiliar to this reviewer, but may be of interest to a real fan of the genre.

The collection is cautiously recommended to those with an interest in the war and a willingness to persevere through the film imperfections.",1200268800,,1116,5.265536723163842
