8011584,5,B0001F2U5C,"I never write reviews.  In coming across this link I thought my insight might be valuable.  TaiKai 2003, I was there, and I have this DVD.  This is not an A-B-C instructional.  This is footage from a three day seminar.

What you learn in the Bujinkan depends upon your teacher, how you learn and retain it depends entirely upon you.  I was a mid level green belt at this Tai Kai initially overwhelmed by the thought of training with a room full of Black belts and others of greater experience.  My class experience had been shinken gata from the beginning, my instructor taught me real world fighting even before the official allowance post 911 from Hatsumi.  So I found that even though I may not have had all of the experience I might have wished for at the Tai Kai, that in training with individuals of various ranges of skill, I was very easily able to survive and actually thrive.

I did see black belts who seemed to lack the level of experience that I had.  I also saw green belts who were incredibly accomplished and almost eerily smooth and proficient.  It all has to do with what your teacher brings to the table, and then what you are able to absorb that is of value.

The format of the Tai Kai was demonstration and perhaps talk by Hatsumi, then a flurry of activity as onlookers attempted to replicate it.  Hatsumi would watch and comment and caution, and then swiftly move into the next technique.  The DVD cuts out all of the floor activity but does show how selected teachers and black belts interpret Hatsumis technique as they display it on stage.

When I looked around I could see that many to most people were not replicating what Hatsumi was doing on stage, even some of the demonstrating Black instructors missed the mark.  But the value of the event is in getting the ""feeling"" of where you need to be and what you need to do in such a situation.  Not stomp, kick, thrust, punch, repeat - THAT in my humble opinion will get you killed.

The training in the bujinkan can be old school full on, or some degree of it.  Agreed, unless there in intent behind attacks and defense the sense of danger and urgency is not there, and unless power is there then you won't know what to do when really struck.  All of that is within the teaching of the Bujinkan, it depends on your instructors method.  I'd caution that while hoping for a teacher to show you the way of power, pray that you haven't walked into the dojo of a sadist.

You must also realzie that TIME and AGE will take SPEED and POWER from us all.  Why spend a life learning a system that specializes or keys on power technique when you won't have the power needed at the time in life when you need it most?  Predators always prefer the aged and weak, perceived or real.  I specifically chose the Bujinkan to advance in once I discovered the age and ability of the elder Hatsumi and his instructor Takamatsu.

The two main concepts 'I found' that Hatsumi teaches here and shows repeatedly in every technique are ""gain a sense of the combat so that you move naturally, even unhurredly into the position best for you and least beneficially to your enemy while allowing your enemy to believe that he or she is in best position and has you dominated, struck or hurt - when you are not.""  AND Remove balance from your opponent and NEVER give it back.  He does this over and over.

Its for you to debate, discuss, or discover, but without balance you cannot have power.  So if you rain in power and our angles and energy and methods remove your foundation...  where are you then?

I have found that once balance is removed from an opponent, you can bring a 300 pound martial artist down with all the power inherent in an 11 year old girl.  Bujinkan training keeps you alive while you manuever to do this, and shows you how to direct that fall to make it breath taking, or the final crash and burn.",1183939200,4,3866,4.415254237288136
8011585,5,B0001F2U5C,"Soke Dr. Masaaki Hatsumi is absolutely wonderful. The 3 disc DVD jumps right in and starts combat. I say combat instead of teaching because in one part of the video Dr. Hatsumi states, ""This is a place of war, not a school."" Being that I love Ninjutsu, I really gained a lot from this Tai Kai. Soke Hatsumi's way of saying be creative with techniques and ""be free"" really helps. I always feel if I change the technique I will be doing something wrong but Soke teaches that is exactly what to do. Warring and Wisdom - I would absolutely recommend this DVD.",1146960000,6,555,4.398058252427185
8011586,5,B0001F2U5C,"This dvd was very helpful to my training. For those who are familiar with Soke Hatsumi's work,they can now see it in action, and try to understand the feeling he conveys with his artform. It is a must have for students of ninjutsu.",1141689600,4,231,4.395348837209302
8011587,2,B0001F2U5C,"This is nothing but a 3 DVD disks recording of a Documentary and training seminary on Ninjutsu. Each disk last about 1 half hour. Those giving 5 stars are probably participants themselves helping in promoting this DVD. Buy ONLY if you want to see GrandMaster Masaaki Hatsumi.

 I fast forward in between viewing 'cos it can be quite boring. So don't waste your money. I bought this DVD is b'cos of the many reviews that I read. So,don't trust reviews, including mine. It's your choice and your taste. Credits must given to the clear picture. Warning, there's no Chapters selection in all 3 DVDs.",1141257600,9,595,4.711538461538462
8011588,5,B0001F2U5C,"Like most of what Hatsumi teaches, this dvd represents a combination of traditional and modern martial applications. I would say that this taikai is actually more geared to the traditional side, not that there isn't a cross-over application to modern situations.

I would heartily agree with everything the other reviewers have said about the training session. Unlike Hatsumi's Quest series, this taikai has poorer sound quality and lighting. Even so, the translation is actually the best possible (Ben Jones is amazing) and helps make up for what is otherwise lacking in on the produciton end. The camera work is well done.

As for the claim that this is the best dvd, not hardly. Nearly all of the other Quest-produced taikais are much much better.
I would also say that if you are intersted in ninjutsu or bujinkan or Hatsumi, then you should do yourself a favor and check out Systema, a Russian system that is gaining more critical attention in recent years that also follows the same themes of the Bujinkan approach (lack of formality and emphasis on natural responeses and multiple attacks).

When you watch this dvd, you may come away with a poor impression of Bujinkan. I would not want this to be the case, but it must be viewed in teh present context of worldwide Bujinkan training quality. It is true that members of the bujinkan in general do not know how to deleiver power, and thus do not know how to receive power. This is not true of everyone in the style. Who would tell Nagato or Hatsumi that they can't deal with a real situation? Of course they can. But in general, it is easy to see that the lagre, typically Japanese, stances are not practical for jissen gata, real life fighting. I am all for cooperative training, a hallmark Bujinkan practice, but falling onto one another or sloppily punching and hanging you kicks out doesn't help much if that is all you do. Of course not all of them do this, but the bujinkan members that I have trained with were both 4th degrees, one of whom couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag and is now a godan. Again, not all bujinakn is this way. Stephen Hayes, one of Hatsumi's top students, has noted this and adjusted his teaching to be more practical. One can only wish that Hatsumi's students, especially the American ones, would do likewise. Do you ever see Hatsumi or Nagato use such positions? Not often. But when you watch this dvd, and many of the other taikai, don't discount Hatsumi of the account of lackluster practitioners.

This is not to say that Bujinkan isn't a great organization or that they are weak. I have great respect for them. I only mean to point this out for viewers. So if you have a bujinkan friend, give them a makiwara in a small room. More power with smaller, balanced stances.

Please check out the Quest dvds and videos of Hatsumi. They are fantastic! But also check out Vladimir Vasiliev for a pleasant surprise and target focus training (TFT) for some serious learning.",1104192000,16,2964,4.659655831739962
8011589,5,B0001F2U5C,"This DVD is a great value & I am glad I made the purchase.
You don't find too many training videos at this quality and at such a resonable price. The video has no fluff. It is all quality training footage. Which to me is important when choosing training aids.
It is always great to see Hatsumi Sensei in action. His movement & martial skill is impressive as always. Everything he does appears effortless & his years of training shine through on this DVD.
The 2003 U.S. Tai Kai was particularly special because it was the last Tai Kai being done outside of Japan. So for me, it is like having a little piece of martial arts history.
I have to say, Great job! to those who put this DVD together to chronicle the event. For those of us that weren't able to be there in person we now have the next best thing.
Thanks again!",1079136000,14,819,4.256410256410256
8011590,5,B0001F2U5C,"This terrific three-DVD set chronicles the last training event taught by ninja Grandmaster Hatsumi Masaaki outside Japan. For twenty-one years, Hatsumi-sensei has traveled around the world to teach the nine Japanese martial arts traditions he inherited from his teacher, Takamatsu Toshitsugu. In August, 2003, Hatsumi-sensei came to the U.S. for three days and amazed the participants with his knowledge and skill. Like it says in the product description, Hatsumi-sensei doesn't just show techniques; he gets to the essence and principles of the movement, offering unlimited freedom in dealing with any situation. His understanding of martial arts really comes through on this DVD, providing endless hours of viewing.
One attacker not enough? How about watching Hatsumi-sensei toss around multiple attackers half his age as if they weren't even there? Still not enough for you? Okay, lets add a variety of weapons such as shuriken (throwing stars), daisho (long and short swords), kyoketsu shoge (sickle and chain), and yari (spear), and watch as he effortlessly controls his opponents.
Most importantly, Hatsumi-sensei doesn't teach in a stiff and stern manner. His approachable and charismatic demeanor really comes through, and makes it not only fun to watch but much easier to understand what it is that he's teaching. I highly recommend this DVD set. Anyone interested in martial arts can benefit from the information, and those seeking the true essence of the warrior way will not find a better source!",1076025600,13,1508,5.3940677966101696
