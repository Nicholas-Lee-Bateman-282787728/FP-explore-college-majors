2769637,1,B000NJL520,PRETTY SORRY ! Not a dvd for documentary viewers. It was a sound and graphic display with meaningless new age dribble laced throughout.,1191888000,,135,4.913043478260869
2769638,5,B000NJL520,"First, I appreciate every customer that takes a moment to write a review: good, bad, or, in particular: ugly! Second, the key to growth is to get a reaction to a creative act. For example, I don't like classical music; I love country! I don't like modern art; I love landscapes! I don't like mysteries; I love Westerns! Indeed, I am your stereotypical cosmic 'redshift' cowboy! But most of all, I seek to activate your own insights in order to pull your head out of your past. That is, in fact, my job as a bona fide, certified, trickster coyote -- the class of shaman that will use every means at-hand, both ancient and modern, to get you to think for yourself. Specifically, I want you to define the meaning of life in your terms and what you can do to improve it lifetime after lifetime! In that sense, and for that reason, I aim to agitate and stimulate you in every way imaginable -- but mostly unimaginable -- in my attempt to educate you to become self-empowered. Whatever it takes to turn-on your third eye to our glorious co-creative future together I will do. My goal is selfish, I want you to survive the post-new world disorder once our sun explodes in a series of solar flares so that I am not alone sitting at my campfire under the new born stars of Orions' Belt in 2012.",1191110400,8,1285,4.4033613445378155
2769639,1,B000NJL520,"you've got to be kidding me. total new age, painful to watch garbage (trust me I'm not being too harsh)

the substance of this DVD is about on par with the visuals (possibly done by a four year old on an amiga), with script basically piecing together popular occult, religious, and shamanic quotes from (some) otherwise reputable sources to make an utterly confusing and incomprehensible waste of time.

I beg of you, go read ayahuasca by metzner, DMT: the spirit molecule, then joseph campbell, dawkins, real mayan calendrics/anthropology, brian greene, dennis mckenna (and terrence for fun), etc, and let pseudo-science trash like this fade away",1188604800,3,647,5.152380952380953
2769640,2,B000NJL520,"I own and have watched ""What the Bleep"" and ""The Secret"", and this DVD does not compare favorably. It depends too much on the graphics and music, which are admittedly great but which often overshadow the narration. The material is sometimes difficult to follow and is made more difficult by the lack of quality narration. The DVD doesn't get to the meat this buyer was expecting (2012 and the relation of the sun, the earth and mankind) until close to the end. And there is at least one serious digression (a comparison of the Egyptian god Horus to Jesus Christ) that while interesting, seemed to me to take more than its share of the DVD's short length. Harper's concepts are relevant, and it is urgent that they be communicated to mankind, but the packaging detracts from the credibility.",1184803200,5,790,4.731884057971015
2769641,1,B000NJL520,"The narration would have made a great magazine article.  There was a pretty good amount of information in the script.  As a DVD, though, it was a sorry production.  Somebody with a desktop video production rig decided to try out every special effect in the software...three or four time over.  The video is very distracting, hard to watch, and only rarely relevant to what is being said.  The music track is unrelenting and also distracting, sometimes to the point that you miss what is being said.  (I must admit that the first music track, which sounds a bit like ""Riverdance""-type Irish folk music, is a musical genre that I absolutely abhor...so my opinion here is slanted by that.)  Every time the narrator pauses to take a breath, the music volume swells in a most inappropriate way.  The DVD is certainly not worth the price because the information is not appropriately presented for video.",1184198400,19,897,4.816993464052287
2769642,1,B000NJL520,"So in 2012, can we all expect a mass variety of Heaven Gate Suicides?

People Get real, look up Issacc Newtons Studies- I would trust him more than the mayans

And besides if all these Occult Leaders possessed the so called truth, why did they all end in DOOM and literally destroyed? Why didn't their inner knowledge SAVE them?

Far as the snake goes in the Garden of Eden , well when you have given childbirth, you know the serpent was lying to Eve. Only one God folks, and with out him we are nothing!",1184025600,3,504,4.28421052631579
2769643,2,B000NJL520,"Once again a lot of hype for a very poorly mixed and edited film.  I don't know what it is about these films that always falls short with the music/voice mixing.  The music is way too loud and the voices are too faint.  Not to mention, the music sucks.  If there is any 'hidden' knowledge being presented, you'll have to wear headphones or constantly adjust the volume for the crappy music interludes.  Why can't they pan the music to one side, the voice to the other, and hire an experienced mixing engineer for appropriate levels?  My suggestion to this production company: Stick to the information and tone it down a bit on the unnecessary bells and whistles.  Frankly, most of us just want to hear the info, and not be subjected to a bunch new age music and cheap transition effects.",1182124800,5,787,4.539007092198582
2769644,5,B000NJL520,"After I read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tranceformers-Shamans-of-the-21st-Century/dp/0977790401/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tranceformers: Shamans of the 21st Century</a>, I knew that I would buy anything that this scholar produces on this topic whatsoever. He speaks like he writes and that is spell-binding. It is beyond a doubt the most authoritative, colorful, and enjoyable way to learn the ancient wisdom teachings of third eye open trance. It is packed with facts that simply dumbfounded me how can I have been so blind for so long to this truth? Why didn't I realize sooner based upon what I learned in college that our history is not our destiny! This DVD is a perfect matched-set to the book and a delight to see both before and/or after one read's the book itself. There is nothing on the DVD market that compares to this dynamnic presentation and I place it on my bookshelf right alongside that of The Power of Myth series by Joseph Campbell with Bill Moyers. This is a must have blockbuster audiovisual masterpiece certain to be a highly-controversial cult-classic such as the musings of Terence McKenna. Indeed, do yourself a favor: buy the book and the DVD and get the full-impact of how split-brain we are and why we need to integrate our body-mind-spirit now before we die and suffer the ""second death"" upon which our intellect and affect ""emotions"" go on to live separate existences until as it is stated in the Gospel of Thomas, we learn how to ""make the two one again."" This is the missing-link of symbolic and literary truth that has been long-lost by our high-tech, low-touch civilization. I also recommend his CD-ROM Vantage Quest VI if you seek how to enter into trance as needed for creative problem solving and healing insights. It is a mind-tool unlike any in my collection of such items thus far, and as a scientist myself, you can take that endorsement to the bank!",1178236800,7,1941,5.126182965299685
2769645,5,B000NJL520,"But this isn't one of them. Harper enlightens and unravels the 2012 enigma like no other. Great narration and direction, great script, wonderful music, a joy to behold in these times of wonder.",1175731200,3,193,4.878787878787879
8178407,5,B000NJL520,"Ancient knowledge will save us all.  Knowing what is contained within is like being taught how to swim before the Flood.  If you wish to Know, and not to live your life asleep to the Truth, you must take the initiative to Learn.  This is a wonderful first step in the right direction.",1374883200,,284,4.320754716981132
8178408,5,B000NJL520,When you are ready for the next level of enlightenment I always recommend this dvd. I won't detail out all the specifics as that has been done in other reviews but I will say this is a great presentation that you should own. Peace be with you.,1374883200,,243,4.191489361702128
8178409,2,B000NJL520,"""WE are the words of the sun gods made flesh.""  We are all becoming a Christ.  Reminds me of something spoken by a serpent I read about in Genesis.  Personally, I don't believe we are all gods.

I also don't believe we have all been reincarnated, as is stated in this movie.

I realize there are some out there who agree with the viewpoint of this video, which is their perrogative, but I am not one of them.

This presentation was boring, interspersed with interesting tidbits.  The music was a distraction, mainly, and the one speaking voice in the movie was enough to put someone to sleep.

Don't be fooled by an interesting title.  It's not worth it, even if you agree with the points stated in the video as truth.",1331078400,,718,4.419847328244275
8178410,1,B000NJL520,I started the movie and could not get past the cheesy presentation or the music. Fast forwarded 7 min and the cheesy presentation was still going with the cheesy music and some cheesy person trying to speak over it. No way I could get through any more of it and turned it off. I generally wait until the end of a movie to give it a fair assessment. In this case I did not need to wait till the end; two minutes was as long as I could stand. Save your money!!!!  TOTALLY TRASH,1327190400,,475,4.053191489361702
8178411,5,B000NJL520,"For seekers of knowledge, this DVD brings together a wide variety of subjects both spiritual and scientific into an artistically and emotionally appealing presentation. The depth and breadth of subject matter as well as the quality of the style of presentation, should place this DVD on PBS and Discover Channel and on academic bookshelves.

8178412,5,B000NJL520,"After watching the movie KNOWING and this DVD repeatedly now, it dawned upon me suddenly one day what a genius-level script as well as the music and graphics synchronized my mind's eye with my chakras. I mean this is a masterpiece and it is such a subtle DNA-activating and tranceforming technique, an incredibly unique novel way to invoke genetic change within the cells of the pineal-pituitary network. No wonder viewers feel that it is not what they expected: a documentary? This is a scientific and spiritual prophecy made manifest audio-visually and offers a way to avoid the ""doom and gloom"" outcome via GNOSIS: KNOWING THE TRUTH!

We are indeed so programmed by the left-brain fear-based ""if it bleeds it leads"" media that we can not possibly evaluate such a whole brain experience initially. It grows on you over time and repeated observation how phenomenal this DVD is to us. It'd be like asking a child to critque Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity!

No doubt about it, this DVD does not give us a super-charged adrenaline rush but rather calms us as it enlightens us. It lifts its messages and meanings softly above our lower reptile brainstem and onto our prefrontal lobes where feelings are integrated. How utterly telling that it takes a woman to sense the power and potential of this presentation to transform us in profound new ways. This Science of Soul is a lyrical, musical, and graphicsl delight to the sixth sense and I recommend it to all my family, friends, and colleagues of metaphysic circles that are preparing themselves to survive the ongoing galactic-ray bursts and magnetic-reversals of our solar system as predicted by Egyptian, Mayan astronomer priest-shamans and ... NASA! Learn how Coronoal Mass Ejections impact us at the level of our soul.

Indeed, you MUST read the newly released book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tranceformers-Shamans-of-the-21st-Century-Second-Edition-Revised-and-Updated-for-2012/dp/1934588407/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tranceformers: Shamans of the 21st Century - Second Edition Revised and Updated for 2012</a>&nbsp;text before you order this DVD -- or maybe buy both. The text is outstanding and reintroduced me to the shapeshifting power of our self-talk to impact DNA: the Word of God made flesh. It also educated me to the ""archetypes of the apocalypse"" and our potential to transform them now fast into ""archetypes of abundance"" if we circumvent WWIII in era-2012 before the chaos we will face in Solar Cycle 24.",1237248000,,2528,5.4438775510204085
8178413,5,B000NJL520,"This film shows us the true history of the serpent, the Shaman, and Jesus Christ. All three of these knew how to use our electromagnetic, solar, body, mind and spirit ability. And that is why they could do amazing things like heal sick people and communicate with spirits. I give this film 5 stars.",1236124800,2,298,4.537037037037037
8178414,4,B000NJL520,"I suggest taking the time to see through what some have called a poorly produced movie and watch for the content.  Although the graphics were not traditional, I really liked the opening song and sequence.  Many have commented on the value of the information, so that being said, I really liked the production.  I feel so relaxed 15 minutes into the movie; it was so calming.  I really recommend giving this one a chance.  Good information, good music and worth your time.",1204243200,4,471,4.695121951219512
8178415,3,B000NJL520,"In 1990, John Jay Harper had an experience that he describes as being ""suddenly and completely raptured in the Sun of God...my third eye had opened spontaneously...thoughts were thinking me."" Here he discusses the science behind superconsciousness with Reality Films trademark music and colorful graphic images.",1201219200,2,311,5.782608695652174
8178416,1,B000NJL520,Don't buy this DVD. It's cheap produced and has no value at all. The company even refuses to take back the product.,1198195200,3,115,4.2727272727272725
