8657191,5,B00KB3PYV6,"The Australian version of Shame, unlike the sexy American remake is a gem. I used to have my film students watch this when we discussed American film archetypes. Sound contradictory? Not really. Shame is your basic John Wayne movie that substitutes a woman for the male character. A lawyer is traveling through the Australian outback when her horse (motorcycle in this case) goes lame and she is temporarily stranded in a company town run by intractably bad men who abuse women. She becomes the savior of one girl in particular and a lot of crotch kicking ensues. I don't mean to make this film sound funny, it is quite disturbing, but the plot of  hero, intractably bad people who can't be reasoned with and saving innocence, is a narrative that has been used relentlessly in the American film and political mythology. Are all ""bad guys"" as intractably evil as our films portray them? Perhaps it is time we start asking that question.",1493683200,,935,4.771604938271605
