3826076,5,B001WB6N1Q,Can't tell you how many times my 9 year old has watched this one! He loves it! Probably his favorite and it makes him laugh every time.,1267833600,8,135,4.037037037037037
3826077,3,B001WB6N1Q,"My 6 year old has become fascinated by everything Mario due to playing Super Mario Bros on the Wii.  Overall she and her 4 year old sister like these videos and request them quite often.  The videos are kind of old school compared to today's kid's fare.  The characters don't set the best examples and the story lines are pretty much mush.  However, they are entertaining if you order them knowing what to expect - typical 90's action cartoons.",1267747200,,444,4.582278481012659
3826078,4,B001WB6N1Q,"My kids like it. If they love Mario, they'll like this DVD. As an adult, I find the singing and voice of Yoshi to be horribly annoying. But my kids, especially my 2 yr old, like it. So, it was worth buying.",1265932800,2,206,3.9285714285714284

3826081,5,B001WB6N1Q,Super Mario World is probably the best in the Mario Bros cartoons series. Unfortunately here in the states the only boxed set release of this great series available at this time is the 2007 release which is in French-not very useful.  Hopefully this dvd comes with extras but as it hasn't been released yet I can only speculate.  One of my favorite episodes- Fire Sale is on this release so I'm giving it 5 stars because I've been waiting for years to own a copy of this great episode.,1250208000,3,485,4.438202247191011

3826105,5,B001WB6N1Q,"I'm an 12 year old kid watching this and I have 2 things to say. 1: This is a great movie. Of the Super Mario World Movies, I love King Scoopa Koopa the best. It makes me laugh over and over.(King Scoopa Koopa is not on this CD. It is on Koopa's Stone Age Quests). I first rented this from Redbox(and they don't have Mario movies there anymore). It was great!!!  2: stop pronouncing the cave kid's name wrong. I have watched it enough to know that it is Ooktar and not Oogtar. Why does everyone think it is Oogtar? In The Night Before Cave Christmas, Koopa says: Remember: Ooktar spelled backwards is Ratkoo. SO that is proof it is Ooktar and not Oogtar. Overall, great movie!",1375315200,,676,4.322834645669292

3826127,5,B001WB6N1Q,"The main drag people claim is that the shows tend to not make much since, which they really dont. In my opinion most of the popular cartoons never make much since, ""spongebob, TMNT, Rockos modern Life"" However, whether the story line makes much since or not is irrelevant. My kids got this yesterday for xmas, and they have already watched the dvd three times. The color scheme added with their favorite characters make this a hit dvd. The soundtrack includes all the noises from the super mario world game and in each episode they play a 1-2 minute song that gets my kids to dance.
Needless to say this was worth the money I spent on it.",1324857600,,638,4.461538461538462
3826128,4,B001WB6N1Q,"I got a few of the Mario DVDs for my son (5 years old) for Christmas, but he got this one early because he was sick a few weeks ago.

It went over big. He dances to the opening music whenever it comes on. It is adorable to watch how excited he gets, which is fortunate because after the second time, this video grated on me. And I am a huge Mario fan myself!

So on the plus side, my son loves this DVD and it will help when we take a long plane ride to have something that he can watch.

On the down side, the graphics aren't great (this does not seem to bother my son), some of the music gets irritating, and ditto the reviewer who complained about how annoying Oogtar is! :-)

Overall I have to give it four stars for how much my son loves it.",1292630400,,746,3.9205298013245033
3826129,2,B001WB6N1Q,"I like to describe the cartoons Super Mario 3 and Super Mario World as a set of scales, completely mirrored, in which one scale is always rock bottom. Super Mario World does some things right that Super Mario 3 did wrong - Koopa properly evil, no real world crossovers. This time there's no crossing over to the real world, thank god, something that really made Super Mario 3 suck. But everything Super Mario 3 did right, Super Mario World does wrong. Nonsensical premise... And yet some of the worst things Super Mario 3 did remain; the annoying Koopalings, the audio-torture music etc. In some ways, Super Mario World manages to be even worse thanks to those stupid cave people, especially the insufferable Oogtar.

The main Achilles heel of this cartoon series is the stupidity of the premise. It's Dinosaur World, which works fine in the game, but for some reason somebody had the bright idea that dinosaurs equals cave people. Instead of Dinosaur World, it becomes the Stone Age. This makes the whole premise just putrid. Those cave people are horrible and completely drag everything down. Peach feels responsible for them, which probably means I should file my letter of complaint to her.

The very best thing about Super Mario World is, you guessed it, King Koopa. He's much better here than in the Super Mario 3 cartoon. Here, he gets to be his evil self again without being overdependent on his kids. In fact, there are many times, here, when they are submissive to him. And he has a lot of nefarious schemes like getting everyone hooked on spruced-up snacks and even pay-per-view television (admittedly not on this set, sadly). He's definitely the shining star. When he appears, that is.

A mixed blessing comes in the form of Yoshi, a little kid trapped in a dinosaur's body. You would think he could easily be irritating, but he's actually loveable and you root for him.

The worst thing about the ensemble is that the main cast really are kept in the background. They hardly ever save the day - that virtue is mostly handed to Yoshi. When Koopa's rock tv has everyone zombified, it's Yoshi that stands up and saves the day. God forbid, sometimes it's the horrible, horrible cave boy Oogtar who's the hero. The princess spends more time parenting those two than doing anything in character with her role - apart from managing to be a damsel in distress for once. Not once did Koopa kidnap her in Super Mario Bros 3 (and here I thought that's what he enjoys best), so that's good. But Mario saving her? Nope, that would rob ""Yoshi the Superstar"" of his title, now wouldn't it?

Super Mario World is not totally horrible. King Koopa is the saving grace of the show, and properly so, unlike in Super Mario Bros 3. His evil schemes and overwhelming personality keep this ship from sinking. Harvey Atkin has to be commended for believing in the character enough to stick with it till the bitter end, and of course to Koopa's animators. Some of the episodes are worth a peek, some are not, all thanks to him. You could do worse than take a chance with this one, but probably only the smallest kiddies can watch this and not feel judgemental. The episode ensemble isn't the best this short series has to offer (""Fire Sale"" is just putrid), the best being ""Mama Luigi"" and ""The Night Before Cave Christmas"" (because of Koopa).",1285459200,4,3330,4.685470085470086

Fire Sale; Kootie Pie steal Mama Fireplant, the source of the Cave People's fire, and our heroes have to save her from being extinguished forever.

Mama Luigi: Luigi tells Yoshi a bedtime story about how Luigi found a Yoshi and became a mother. It's kind of gay, but it's also really good episode.

Born to Ride: After being scolded by Mario and Luigi, Yoshi joins an evil Gang called the DinoRiders.

The Yoshi Shuffle: When Luigi gets turned into an egg and Yoshi mistakes him for football, Yoshi leads Mario on the madcap chase through dinosaur world.

A Little Learning: Princess Toadstool starts a school with Yoshi, Oogtar, Hip, and Hop as their classmates.

The Night Before Cave Christmas: Mario brings Xmas to the Cave People in August!

This is one of the most awesome DVDs I've ever owned. I would highly recommend this to any super Mario fan, young or old!",1430956800,,949,4.680722891566265
