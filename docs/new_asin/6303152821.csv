575516,4,6303152821,"This DVD release has three classic Peanuts cartoon specials on it.  All three were Valentine's Day related episodes.  The episodes are ""Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown"" (1975), ""You're in Love, Charlie Brown"" (1967), and ""It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown"" (1977).  While the episodes vary in overall quality, it is always nice to have a collection of the Peanuts shorts.
First on the disc is ""Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown"", and this may be the one that most people are familiar with.  It is almost Valentine's Day and everyone is looking forward to the day.  Charlie Brown brings a briefcase with him to school because he believes this is the day that he will get mounds of valentine's cards.  Linus buys a big box of chocolates for his teacher and hopes to give it to her.  Sally is waiting for a valentine from Linus.  Lucy wants one from Schroeder (who would presumably want one from Beethoven).  The theme of Peanuts, unfortunately is unrequited love, so nobody gets what they want.  Charlie Brown is so desperate for a valentine that he is willing to take a used card with the original name scratched out because Patty felt bad when nobody gave poor Charlie Brown a valentine.  This is the best episode of the disc.
The second episode is ""You're in Love, Charlie Brown"". This episode takes Charlie Brown on the last two days of the school year and he is trying to work up his nerve to talk to the Little Red Haired Girl.  He talks to Linus and complains but he never can quite work up his nerve.  Once again, we have the sadness of Charlie Brown not achieving his dreams, but the episode ends on a high note.  When Charlie Brown finally decides that he is going to talk to the Little Red Haired Girl, he misses the opportunity in the press of students as school ends.  But he finds a note in his hand when the students all pass that says ""I Like You, signed, The Little Red Haired Girl"".  This one has its moments (Charlie Brown eating a peanut butter sandwich in disappointment is one), but overall it isn't quite as good as the first.
The last episode is ""It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown"".  This is the strangest episode of the three.  The episode opens with a Homecoming Parade.  Charlie Brown and Linus are on one of the floats and Charlie Brown asks what exactly they are doing as an escort.  Linus tells him that their role is to escort the homecoming court at the dance and that Charlie Brown's date is the Queen.  Charlie Brown looks over and realizes that the Homecoming Queen is the Little Red Haired Girl.  Linus tells him that her name is Heather.  Before the dance, though, is the Homecoming Football game.  This takes up a rather large portion of the episode, and Charlie Brown is the kicker.  Naturally Lucy repeatedly pulls the ball away before he can kick it (the old Peanuts gag).  Every time Charlie Brown gets close to kicking it, the ball is pulled away and he lands flat on his back.  Amazingly enough, every time this happens the entire team gets mad at Charlie Brown for missing the ball while ignoring the fact that Lucy clearly pulled the ball away in an important game!  We come to the dance where Charlie Brown gets to lay the ceremonial first kiss on the cheek of the Queen and Charlie Brown's dreams come true.  It is a nice sweet ending (especially the conversation with Linus at the very end) to a weird episode.
This DVD is a nice chance to own three Valentine's specials on one disc.  While I found these enjoyable, there is nothing like the magic of the first Christmas special here.  Decent episodes, but nothing spectacular.  Still, they are Peanuts and that is always a good thing.",1079308800,12,3632,4.54
575517,4,6303152821,"This one's a no-brainer: it's a Peanuts holiday special so of course it's good. This one even has some good dramatic tension near the end between Schroeder and the girls who always pick on Charlie Brown that brings out all the pathos of Peanuts, and the way Charlie Brown cuts through the conflict you can't help but feel sorry for him. I'm docking this DVD release one star because it probably should've included the more recent Peanuts Valentine special that I believe originally aired in 2002, but now it may never be seen on any official release.
UPDATE: The second Valentine special does have it's own DVD now: ""A Charlie Brown Valentine.""",1059609600,2,644,4.758928571428571
575518,4,6303152821,"This is fun. The best Peanuts cartoon by far is Charlie Brown's Christmas, but this is probably a close second. All the gang are here, Snoopy, Franklin, Pig-Pen, Schroeder, Lucy, Linus, Sally, and of course good ol' Charlie Brown.
The story will be familiar to many youngsters. St. Valentine's Day has come round again and there is nothing in the post box for poor old Charlie Brown. No matter how many times he jumps up to that box, reaches inside, checks and re-checks, there is nothing in there for him. But the story does have a happy ending, and there is fun a-plenty along the way. Part of the charm of these stories is the way they're animated simply and with a laid back, complementary musical score. The children who provide the voices are all well cast and the action never flags.
The DVD presentation is minimal. The film is not remastered, and needs some dirt and scratches cleaned as well as the (mono) soundtrack. There are NO special features, but the Studio has given us two supporting cartoons, neither of which are quite as good as Be My Valentine. Neither the voices nor animation quite hit the mark, but they're reasonably pleasant and justify the cost of a DVD more than if just one thirty minute animation had been included",1053302400,8,1245,4.638009049773756
575519,4,6303152821,"In terms of length, this is the best ""Peanuts"" DVD available -- three of the classic half-hour TV specials on one disc. Most of the others give you two. (""Pied Piper"" gives you ONE, plus a 20-minute special about Charles Schulz.) In terms of content, these aren't the best of the Peanuts shorts, but they aren't terrible either.
Our Feature Presentation, ""Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown,"" is easily the best of the three, with some of the gags taken directly from the comic strips. As Charles Schulz once said about his creation, all of the loves are unrequited -- Charlie Brown wants a Valentine, ANY Valentine, Sally wants one from Linus, Linus wants to show his love for his teacher -- all meet with the sort of misfortune that Schulz was famous for, tugging at your heartstrings and reminding you of the times in your life you've felt the same way. The climactic scene at the mailbox may be one of the best moments in any ""Peanuts"" cartoon.
The other two shorts aren't nearly as good. ""You're In Love, Charlie Brown,"" about ol' Chuck trying to work up the nerve to talk to the infamous Little Red-Haired Girl before school ends for the summer, is sweet, but not particularly memorable. ""It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown,"" feels a little funky at times. The kids seem to be drawn slightly older than they should be, and perhaps that's intentional, since the fervor surrounding an elementary school football game that is the focus of this short seems completely off-the-wall.
Still, the first cartoon makes this disc worthwhile. Besides, if you're like me, you've got every ""Peanuts"" DVD they've put out so far, and you're not about to start skipping them now.",1045008000,6,1665,4.764705882352941
575520,5,6303152821,"For sheer value, this is the best Peanuts holiday special released.  3 Animated specials on a single DVD, all sharing a common theme of love, although not all set during Valentine's Day.  A much better bargain than the usual two special per DVD that has been the standard.
Each holiday special has that Peanuts flair, with Charlie Brown being the Charlie Browniest of them all.  His simple, misplaced optimism is constantly crushed by the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.  Of course, the course of true love never did run smooth, especially if you are Charlie Brown.  It is nice to watch all three specials in order, to see the round-headed kid finally win one for a change, but only after heaps of suffering.
Snoopy gets some great moments in all three specials, with a classic ""Paw-ppet show"" and his bizarre helicopter ears, which looks much stranger animated than on the strip.  He has a bit of WWI fighter pilot going on as well, which is a constant favorite.
A great collection all around.  I would love to see future Peanuts specials continue in the 3 specials per DVD mode.",1044921600,5,1089,4.7
575521,5,6303152821,"Peanuts once again hits DVD with this collection of three animated specials focusing on love.
The disc starts off with ""Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown,"" which first aired in 1975.  Valentine's Day is coming, and the gang's getting excited.  Charlie Brown is hoping for lots of Valentines this year.  Linus has a crush on his teacher and buys her a box of chocolate which Sally thinks is for her.  And in the middle of all this, Snoopy puts on a special Pawpet Theater show involving love.  Frankly, I found this story to be a little depressing, even for Peanuts and was surprised that The Little Red Haired Girl didn't even get mentioned.
Next comes 1967's ""You're in Love, Charlie Brown.""  It's two days before school lets out for the summer, and Charlie Brown is trying to work up the nerve to talk to The Little Red Haired Girl.  This is affecting every aspect of his life, leading to some embarrassing moments and potentially the worst last school day ever.  This short was filled with the humor and warmth I usually associate with Peanuts.
The final selection is ""It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown,"" from 1977.  Charlie Brown is shocked to learn that part of his duties during Homecoming is to dance with the Homecoming Queen after kissing her.  And the queen is none other then The Little Red Haired Girl, whose name we learn is Heather.  But first, he must do his job as punter in the homecoming football game.  This would be easy, except guess who's holding the football!  This sweet story brought a smile to my face with the ending.
As with other Peanuts DVD's the three programs are the heart and sole of the disc.  There is a computer game for another movie, and that's all.  Still, the programs are ultimately what I bought it for.  The picture is clear and sharp.  The sound seems to have a bit of a problem, but only on the first show and only when Linus and Sally are speaking.  Other wise, the sound is fine in all three.
This disc will appeal to Peanuts fans of all ages.  While the first program may not have as happy an ending as usual, the other two make up for it big time.  I'd never seen these programs before buying the disc, but I intend to watch them for years to come.",1043107200,43,2197,4.458646616541353
575522,5,6303152821,"I remember how excited I was when this special 1st debuted in 1975.  Charlie Brown has high hopes of getting lots of valentine this Valentine's Day including one from the beloved little red haired girl (he brings a suitcase to school).  Linus has spent his allowance on a big heart-shaped box of candy for Miss Orthmar and Voilet inquires about heart-shaped shaving lotion for her teacher (who's a man).  Lucy asks Schroeder: ""Do you realize you could lose me some day?"".  Sally thinks the box of candy her sweet babboo bought is for her.  Snoopy does his hand-puppets show (or should we say ""paw-puppets""?).  Funny and sad, this special got a lot of valentines sent Charles Schulz's way when it was 1st aired, all for Charlie Brown!",971827200,11,733,4.732283464566929
575523,5,6303152821,"""Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown"" is a worthy addition to the Peanuts pantheon of prime-time holiday specials. Guess how many valentines Charlie Brown Receives? (The painful in-class distribution of cards rings  true to my own childhood experience. In my kids' classes, they now require  them to bring valentines cards for everyone, probably to avoid the  tragi-comic scene that Charles endures so charmingly.) Even funnier is  Linus's pining for his teacher, and Sally's mis-reading of the gift-buying  by her ""sweet babboo.""  As with all of the best Peanuts videos,  this one works on (at least) two levels: Plenty of kid-friendly humor and  hijinx, as well as wry dialogue for the more sophisticated viewers. Buy it  with confidence.",954720000,17,735,5.267241379310345

577004,5,6303152821,"It's a wonder the WB never thought to put this AND the Easter Beagle on Blu-ray, since they're big holiday hits like ""the big 3"" themselves. This was the very first Remastered Edition Peanuts DVD in 2008, just a few months after the WB bought probably all the Peanuts specials and TV shows from Paramount, somehow sparing the original 4 movies (it wouldn't be until 2015 when the last 2 would finally be on DVD, by Paramount)! And it's the only one of its kind to have 3 specials instead of the usual 2; the feature program being Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown from 1975, which turned the 'big 4-0' this year, with a bonus 15-minute documentary about how the special, and the Peanuts gang in general, came to be. The other 2 specials are then-unrestored prints of 1967's You're In Love, Charlie Brown, which was the first special to use trombone-talk for the unseen grownups, and the first time the Little Red-haired Girl is heard of in the specials, and 1977's It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown, which was the very first time the Little Red-haired Girl is physically seen in the whole Peanuts universe (known as Heather here, and also seen in the New Year's special in 1986), and the first Peanuts special to be made after Vince Guaraldi passed on, that's why so many musicians had a hand in making the music for the specials, shows & movies from this one, all the way to Blue Sky's new Peanuts movie in 2015. If you're after all the Peanuts holiday specials ever made, this one and its 2002 sequel, A Charlie Brown Valentine, should definitely fit in with them! There's a whole dozen Peanuts holiday specials in all, if you count You're Not Elected, Charlie Brown for Election Day. If you're after every last Peanuts special ever made, fat chance of there ever being 1980's/1990's/2000's collections; even Popeye didn't have any more authorized shorts collections after his 3rd volume set in 2008. Just be thankful for what you already have, since the WB ain't making any more Blu-ray releases for the Peanuts gang anytime soon, nor any more decade sets on DVD. ""Good grief!""

And when the decade collections came out I was happy to see some of the shows that were not easy to find, and a few that were not on any of my existing discs. When I discovered that the Valentine's show didn't make the '70s volume one, I was disappointed. I love all the Peanuts holiday shows, and this one is somewhat poignant in that poor Charlie Brown is once again let down. This time, though his disappointment is worse. At least he got rocks during Halloween, a sharp reproach from Peppermint Patty on Thanksgiving--at least someone paid him attention-- and an actual Merry Christmas greeting after everyone decided that his tree was OK. This time he's left devastated.

The extras are pretty good. You're in Love, Charlie Brown is one of my favorite oldies. It's Your First Kiss, not so much. The set includes a featurette called Unlucky in Love, which is somewhat of a documentary.

578958,4,6303152821,"It is in this dvd where we can see that Charlie Brown does not have it as bad as we may think. To be sure, Charlie Brown often goes through a lot of grief and sadness, but somehow he comes out of it by a means outside the box so to speak.

The 1st episode is probably the most popular one. Charlie Brown is waiting sadly for a Valentine's Day card, and Lucy taunts him by saying he will need good luck. Linus has a crush on his teacher, and he seems to step outside his normal character: ""The amount of money spent on a Valentine should reflect your affection for the person."" This does NOT sound like the intelligent Linus who points out the true meanings of Thanksgiving and Christmas. Lucy sees a '3d' puppet show hosted by Snoopy, and one is at least entitled to wonder if the writer is saying that true love means working through harsh troubles. At the St. Valentine's Day Party, we can see that things are less than happy. Simply put, the happiness of this day revolves around thinking that the person you like likes you back, and this is almost never the case in this cartoon. (Sally / Linus, Lucy / Schroeder, Charlie / Peppermint Patty) It is an interesting side note that Snoopy cuts hearts out very well, but he uses them to strike Woodstock. (Not so nice!) While Charlie (having received no Valentines) leaves the party destroyed and dejected, he does have a final triumph. Yes, it is a day later, but several girls (including Lucy) walk by to deliver a Valentine's Day Card personally.  It is used to be sure, but it does show that they grew to care. While some may feel Schroeder has valid points in his rebuke of the girls, Charlie comes through magnanimously and accepts the card. (Think about it. This shows that the girls grew to some extent, and that Charlie has not only gotten a card, but he gave the gift of forgiveness.)

The 2nd episode revolves around Charlie's crush on Heather. School is nearing the end, and Charlie is trying to overcome his shyness and speak to her. He makes a fool of himself, but many people in love do so.  A real standout in this  episode is when Charlie lets his teacher have it when she asks why he was late: ""I was late....BECAUSE I MISSED THAT STUPID BUS! THAT'S WHY""! But again, just when Charlie thinks all is lost, he finds out it isn't. There is hope.

The 3rd episode is about Charlie planning to escort and dance with Heather after a football game. This episode suffers most from the fact that everyone blames Charlie for missing the football, but no one seems to mention that Lucy pulls it away every time he tries to kick it. At the very least, Charlie could have explained why he keeps missing the football. But even though all looks lost, we see that Charlie Brown comes through yet again. Charlie Brown does triumph; it's just that he doesn't do so the way we may expect.",1232496000,,2836,4.423371647509579

579110,5,6303152821,"This Peanuts DVD includes three love-related specials.  The title feature, ""Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown"" is the first of the three cartoons on the disc.  This special aired on television in 1975 and was nominated for an Emmy.  Mostly based around Schultz's original strips, the main story follows Charlie Brown as he survives Valentine's Day.  The cartoon begins with Snoopy dancing around as cupid and trying to hit Charlie Brown and missing every single time.  Charlie Brown faithfully checks his mailbox hoping to get a Valentine and brings a briefcase to school to carry home all the cards he plans to receive.  Meanwhile, Linus has a crush on his teacher and buys her an expensive box of chocolates as a gift that Sally believes is for her.

The second special on the disc is ""You're in Love, Charlie Brown"".  The school year is quickly approaching the end of the year and Charlie Brown finds himself head over heals in love with the cute little red-haired girl in his class.  He fights to overcome his shyness to speak with the girl before the school year ends because after that, he won't be able to see her until the fall.

The third and final special on the DVD is ""It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown"". This time it's October and the school is gearing up for the big homecoming game and dance.  During the homecoming parade, Charlie Brown is informed by Linus that he's going to be the queen's escort at the dance and he will have to kiss her on the cheek.  The Queen is none other than the little red-haired girl and Charlie Brown finds himself more nervous than he's ever been before.  Of course, before the homecoming dance there's the big homecoming football game.

In addition to a few trailers, BE MY VALENTINE, CHARLIE BROWN also includes a featurette documentary, ""Unlucky in Love: An Unrequited Love Story.""  I really enjoyed this documentary.  It includes interviews with Jean Schulz, Charles' widow; his son Craig; Stephan Pastis the creator of ""Pearls Before Swine"", and several others.  They talk about the reoccurring theme of unrequited love that appears in ""Peanuts"", who the real little red-haired girl was, and why ""Peanuts"" remains relevant.

579114,4,6303152821,"So, I don't know what you grew up with...  If you lived childhood through the 80s, then you probably remember the Muppets very vividly.  The Peanuts did not have a big presence except for maybe the Saturday cartoon which wasn't too popular.  But, I do remember those specials for Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.  Also, my parents gave me those read-along books on those small vinyl records.  So, this story resonates strongly in my childhood.  Now, if you still remember these books then you probably will find that ""You're in Love Charlie Brown"" to be the classic of the three shorts.  The other valentine-themed stories are rehashed which I don't remember at all.  These probably came out much later which you can tell in the drawings.  I personally found that ""You're in Love Charlie Brown"" to have the best drawings that are true to Charles Schultz.  The other shorts fall kinda flat and so do the storylines.  But, it's better to get more shorts than just only 1 classic in my opinion.

You probably can find these holiday-themed DVDs at your Target and Best Buys during the holidays.  For the cost of about $10, you get a decent valued DVD which I don't regret buying.  Just don't confuse this with the other similar title called ""Charlie Brown Valentine"".  The covers look almost identical but read the back to find out what shorts are on it.

579119,4,6303152821,"This love-themed Peanuts DVD features three TV specials about kisses, romance, broken hearts etc. The episodes are as follows...

Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown.

No one seems to have a good time or find love in this Peanuts TV special. Charlie gets no Valentine cards, Linus misses out on his opportunity to give chocolates to his favorite teacher and Shroeder vows to never marry Lucy, much to her anger.

It's kinda downbeat for a Valentine's TV special. So much so that kids from all over America sent Charlie Brown a Valentine's card out of sympathy. Which is quite sweet when you think about it. As long as they were all girls.

Still, it's another funny and timeless TV special that you should definitely make the effort of watching if it comes on this Feb 14th. Though it might depress you if you yourself do not receive any Valentine's card.

You're in Love, Charlie Brown

Charlie is in love with 'the little red-headed girl', the very one he fancied in 'Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown'. But he's not got the courage to talk to her and frequently makes a laughing stock of himself with every attempt. Plus, everybody is making fun of him and Snoopy is not lending a sympathetic ear, as usual.

The emotional turmoil Charlie suffers is alarmingly true. Everybody remembers their first crush and how awkward it made them feel. It's little touches of reality like this in the far-fetched but wonderful world of Peanuts that make it so timeless. Though it was made in 1967 there is nothing in this TV special that dates it in any way.

It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown

The last TV special featured on this DVD is a bit boring. Since I am not American, I have no idea what a homecoming queen is and I am not familiar with their football rules. This Peanuts TV special is mainly about both so I was a little bit lost for most of it.

The story has Charlie Brown struggle (and unfairly lose) a football match and then finally get to meet his wannabe girlfriend (the little red-headed girl who finally see and is called Heather) at the Homecoming Ball (whatever that is). The build of dread as he approaches her is quite amusing and when he finally kisses her the reaction is brilliant. Too bad the rest of it is below par. Though the scenes with Woodstock pretending to be a TV cameraman and flying around on Snoopy (who's ear act as chopper blades) are typically surreal and undoubtedly the best moments.

All are presented in 1.33:1 full frame as originally drawn with Dolby Mono sound. There are no extras.",1108339200,5,2516,4.59375
