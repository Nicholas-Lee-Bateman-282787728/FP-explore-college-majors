5037314,4,B006YTGLEU,"Though it be a logistical nightmare, this film has enough push thematically to warrant its watching.  Three seeming strangers converge on a cabin in the woods, all finding that they seem to end up exactly where they started despite their best efforts.  As they slowly warm up to each other, they come to realize that they are not only from different places and times but that they are also all connected and that their actions in the present are creating alternate futures - they become resolved to change events for the better.  The storyline is incredibly dense and can be very hard to follow but I like that the writing takes risks.  (This theme has been done before but writers, in general, seem hesitant to play with time.)  As a viewer, you either have to pay very close attention or watch it twice.  And some parts of the plot are just wrong from an historical context.  The acting is relatively good quality with the prominent exception of Scott Eastwood who is unconvincing and extremely aloof given the situation.  His character is also the most disposable - I'm guessing his prominence on the cover is a marketing scheme.  The direction is good though a better director would have demanded more of Eastwood's character or, on the other hand, trimmed his screen time and focused more on the other three actors.  Despite this, the film still merits attention.  To be stuck in the same place with the same people forever is at least one person's definition of hell.  Mine, too, for that matter...",1492473600,,1504,4.7203065134099615

5037319,5,B006YTGLEU,"A reluctantly given five stars.  Glad I rented.  Glad I didn't buy.  Great script, bad acting until the last third of the film when real human emotions were being portrayed rather than the emotions they displayed during the beginning when they were characters in a first-time-in-my-life scenarios and that was too much of an acting challenge for these actors to pony up the angst.  But later the characters had clarity and with that the characters were called upon, directed, to have typical responses to understandable predicaments.  Since I know the ending, I don't think I'll ever see this one again.  The ending either cuts it for the viewer, or it doesn't; for me it did -- just barely.  Have to give it five stars just because the concept is nicely brought into focus, but at a too leisurely pace.  I think anyone who can grind through the first half will be glad they didn't fast forward through it, and they'll like the ending well enough.",1488672000,,947,4.696969696969697

5037347,4,B006YTGLEU,"Some films, especially independant ones, seem to have good ideas, but they move so slowly, that one may be tempted to turn it off before it's over. If you did that while watching this film, you missed out on one hell of an ending, that just brought everything together in a way that made the slow start a simple afterthought. One chilly morning, Samantha (Kathrine Waterston) wakes up in her disabled car, on a deserted dirt road. As she goes to find help, she discovers a small cabin, and meets Tom (Scott Eastwood) a man who also became stranded in the woods. Eventually the pair is joined by a third person, who is lost in the woods, and after figuring out how they were going to survive, they decide to go for help, only to learn that every direction leads them right back to the cabin. The conversations about their situation and the search for supplies take up much of the film and are quite boring, but in the end you'll see that they were a necessary set-up to an unbelievably good ending. Scott Eastwood stars and makes a strong case for the theory that performance skills may in fact be hereditary. In this low budget thriller, he is paired with two very experienced indie actresses, who show that they are more than capable of starring in bigger and better things, in particular, Kathrine Waterston, who played the calm and reserved Samantha. Enter Nowhere is honestly hard to sit through, as for a long time it seems to be going nowhere. If you're a patient person, who loves a good story, the ending of this film, makes it all worth while, but if you're not the most patient person, you probably won't make it through this one.",1462752000,,1640,4.525252525252525

5037375,4,B006YTGLEU,"I really liked this movie. I watched it because so many people had given it good reviews and it was listed as a ""thriller/mystery"". I thought the plot was very creative and original. It was not at all what I expected, as I tried to guess about three quarters into the story, but my guess was not even close to what the ""real"" story was, so it was a cool concept and resolution. I'd definitely recommend this one.",1433721600,,412,4.294871794871795
5037376,5,B006YTGLEU,"For those who ever saw the play/TV version of the 1944 Jean-Paul Sartre existentialist French play NO EXIT, ENTER NOWHERE seems like it could be the positive flip side to the former. After a brief introduction involving a petty robbery and possible murder at a grocery store by two young thieves, the screen turns instantly to black, and we are suddenly transported to an unknown wilderness.  We then see a pregnant young lady (Katherine Waterston) wandering aimlessly through a woods who stumbles upon a solitary cabin only to find that someone has been there. Shortly, a young man (Scott Eastwood) appears and it is he who was there earlier. Neither knows how they got to where they are. KW's car ran out of gas and her husband left her to get help. SE's car ran off the road and crashed. Their major effort is to stay warm and find a way out of their current surroundings.  Not too long afterwards, another young lady (Sara Paxton) is found half-dead on the ground in front of the cabin by KW.  Meanwhile, SE is away trying to siphon gasoline from his vehicle to put into that of KW's. The two young ladies (SP is one from the introductory holdup) don't exactly get along at first. When SE returns (having spilled the gasoline accidentally in a fall), the situation does not improve. Without giving anything away (no ""Spoilers"" here), the three become perplexed as to where they are and how they got there from where they came; there are strange maps on the inner walls of the cabin; no telephone; only  a ""ham"" radio; no bathroom facilities; and confusion over what year it is. A series of coincidences begin to emerge and the three begin to come to a variety of unusual and baffling conclusions.  Their condition worsens and becomes even more complex with the appearance of a fourth individual (Shaun Sipos). Realization upon realization is revealed and a final test to make the most of this new information is placed upon the shoulders of all.  Confusion and disbelief have to be overcome as the pace of everything rapidly reaches new heights leading to our story's resolution and finale.  This film is a genuine ""brain teaser"".  It most certainly is NOT a horror movie.  Nor is it a thriller except for the roller coaster ride it offers to the viewer.  All is satisfactorily explained within the contextual theme of this movie; and there are no loopholes left unanswered. The entire cast performed admirably under the directorial baton of Jack Heller and with a minimalistic budget. This is the kind of film that is worth watching more than once!",1433116800,2,2553,4.72972972972973
5037377,4,B006YTGLEU,"Well worth the watch, kept me very entertained and that's not easy to do. Not a horror, more like modern Alfred Hitchcock. Great story, likable actors, not to disrespect Eastwood because he seemed like a cool guy, but the way they had him do his lines was a bit too syfy movie style. It had humor,suspense and a good uneasiness. Predictable yet brought you cool little surprises left and right. I'm pretty picky folks, I felt emerged in it, just get past some of the cheesy lines and how they are delivered. You'll enjoy it.",1431388800,,524,4.526315789473684

I am a sucker for good Time travel movies, yet it isn't a true time travel movie per se. It reminded me of Cabin in the Woods, meets The Others with Back to the Future tossed in for fun.

5037383,4,B006YTGLEU,"This film's biggest problem may be that it sounds like a horror film or even a SLASHERbut actually it turns out to be neither one, but rather a mystery-suspense with a bit of a sci-fi twist.  To say too much about the plot is to spoil the plot.  Suffice it to say at the opening, we see a couple robbing a gas station-food mart complex and the girl shoots the cashier in the face.  Next scene: a woman (no, NOT the same woman) stumbling about in confusion in snowy woods somewhere.  She finds a ramshackle cabin and enters.  As shes looking around, a man enters..no, NOT the male counterpart to the Bonnie and Clyde pair.later, finally, the shooter-girl shows upand then another guy.then the plot is in full swing, as you try to figure out why all of them are there (wherever that is), whether there is some connection between them, and how it will end up.  Id say this movie was fair.  It did hold my attention until the end, and it was neither overly-violent nor particularly sexual in content (despite the R rating which I assume is due to the implied killing(s).  The plot unfolds at a leisurely pace; about halfway through you start to see the connections just as the characters do; they gradually increase until the end (which, again, can't be described without spoiling the plot)",1417219200,4,1286,4.560869565217391

5037390,4,B006YTGLEU,"This movie has a definite Twilight Zone feel to it. Despite it showing up on the 'if you liked' banner for horror movies on this website, Enter Nowhere is not really a horror movie. It does proceed from a 'cabin in the woods' setting, and it does have some tense moments, but in its heart of hearts, Enter Nowhere is a sci fi movie. It is a particular genre of sci fi movie in fact, but to tell you which one would be to spoil it. Although I don't think you'll have much trouble figuring it out. The clothes will tip you off as to what separates the characters, so when the reveal comes I'm pretty sure you will have already guessed how these characters must be connected. In any case, the plot revolves around three strangers who meet in a cabin in the woods: good girl Samantha (Katherine Waterston), bad girl Jody (Sara Paxton) and edgy guy Tom (Scott Eastwood). All of them are stranded there due to car crashes and none of them can figure out how to leave. Then the fourth person shows up...  There is a definite 'forgiveness' theme pervading, which is an element I always like to see. Check this out if you like mind-trippy low budget flicks.",1402012800,,1148,4.389671361502347
5037391,2,B006YTGLEU,"This movie was well done for what it was, it just wasn't all that much. I guessed the connection between the three main characters pretty quickly, and then all of a sudden after the movie is half over a fourth character is introduced, which bisects the movie, though admittedly the plot was stuck.

The three main characters are well acted, but ultimately leave you a little disengaged. One is incredibly obnoxious. As a Catholic, I was repelled by the gratuitous slamming of the Catholic church in order to explain the presence of another character. When you find out what the relationships are, you would expect each of them to have a little more compassion and care for each other, but they don't. They stay as indifferent as when they entered the cabin.

An interesting movie, but I'm not sure I actually recommend it. The character I remember best is a store clerk who is in the movie for about 45 seconds.",1400284800,,911,4.6521739130434785
5037392,4,B006YTGLEU,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

May contain some spoilers :)

I'm not much for perfect analytical reviews, and truth be told I still don't understand every single anomaly of this movie. It was good, kept you wondering throughout (in fact I had to rewind a few cool parts just to hear the dialog again, or see certain parts again to reiterate some stuff in my head).

Three strangers all in their mid to late 20's appear to be lost or stranded and happen mysteriously onto a cabin seemingly in the middle of nowhere. From the get go, things don't make a lot of sense - but that being said, something about the film makes you not want to change the channel and see just exactly what is happening next.

First off - Samantha (Katherine Waterston) will just have you crushing on her as the film goes on. I don't know what it is - maybe it is her soft, laid back, emotionally friendly demeanor - not to mention her conservative but very cute looks, hair, and face. She is a new wife who claims to be pregnant and her husband went off to look for help after their car ran out of gas. She wanders into the cabin after it is apparent her husband never comes back. Later in the film (spoilers), we find out she is from 1962 and was headed to New Hampshire to visit her parents-in-law.

Sarah Paxton annoys me at first but her character grows on you throughout the film, and she comes around to be concerned and passionate. Sarah was a junkie who her and her boyfriend robbed stores and have even killed people. Sarah then wanders onto the cabin after her boyfriend drops her off in the middle of nowhere. We later find out Sarah was from 1985, and she thought she was heading thru the Wisconsin-area while en route to another state.

Scott Eastwood is the late 20's guy who keeps everything together with the teamwork and eventually figures out what is going on and how they all can change their own futures. His acting is very good, solid. We later find out Scott is from the current times (2011), but he is steadfast that he thought he was in South Dakota.

3 different people, all from seemingly different time eras, all believing they are in a specific area different from the other. Later it becomes apparent they were all (in some science fiction or ""time travel"" realm) brought together to find out they are three generations of family who meet tragic or early endings, and it becomes up to them to become the product of the future, or try to create new endings for themselves. Much of it has to do with HANS (we find out he is Samantha's father, who she presumed died in a bombing strike), the German patriarch of all three of them - who depending on whether he dies or survives the German bombing strike (we then assume this Cabin is somewhere in either in Germany or Poland in the late 30s or early 40's), can change all of their courses of history.

At the very end, its kinda confusing - it seems to take place in the mid to late 80s. We don't really know what happens to Scott (or if he is eventually born in the mid 80's. Assuming both Samantha and Sarah survive, perhaps Scott is indeed born but may turn out slightly different), and it seems Sarah in this dimension has her life turned around (she originally was supposed to die by execution for all of the murders), and both her and Samantha (her mother, who originally was supposed to die giving birth to Sarah in late 1962) assumably survive and do not die young like their original fate was.

The movie concludes with ""some other girl"" robbing the gas station with Sara's boyfriend, so we assume she then will be part of the paradox and transported to the 'cabin scenario"" to perhaps put her thru that hell to eventually turn her life around. This mysterious gas station (based on what the clerk says at the beginning, and also the very last lines of the film) is a big key to the movie - almost like a 'portal' to some other dimension and this is how these three main people came to all be together - from different eras and areas of the country - for one main purpose.

One thing that is never explained (unless I missed it) is how Samantha and Scott are brought into the 'paradox.' We only see the parable of the movie from how Sara Paxton is brought into the paradox. Maybe it just doesn't matter.

The movie can be a bit confusing, but is enjoyable, and will probably make more sense than this review (again though, the movie is rooted in science fiction or fictitious drama). Give it a try. Samantha's character is so beautiful, too.",1398643200,2,4510,4.421686746987952

The plot of the movie is 4 people randomly meeting at a desolate cabin in the woods. If this sounds like you've seen this many times before, you are wrong! This film has twists and turns throughout, and will keep you guessing until the end. Just when you think you have figured it out, there's another twist.

The acting was pretty good by a group I had never heard of although they all had famous parents or parent.  This was not a horror film or really not even suspenseful.  It dealt with the issue of changing the past and making things right and it was done in a thoughtful way that did not leave huge gaps in logic..at least not huge gaps in logic for me.

Anyway, this movie has a GREAT story which makes the whole thing just work. Proving once again that good writing trumps everything else.

I try to be patient with movies but must admit this one became too boring to finish watching.

They soon discovered their shocking and unbelievable connection between each other, and they move to work together to ""set things right,"" so to speak.

Personally, from a look at the cover of this DVD, I sure was put off by the design and the title as it wasn't very attractive (to me, anyway), and the description reminds me of some horror movie where some creepy guy would kill these strangers in the end (same 'ol, same 'ol, you know).

It is incorrectly catagorized as horror and therefore sets up people to be disapppointed.

The acting is not always the best and I was able to figure out the twist before it was revealed. However, the concept is good and the story unfolds at a great pace. There are no special effects or big scares (not even small scares). If you are afan of gore, are looking for something that will have you covering your eyes and jumping out of your seat, this is nota movie you will enjoy.  It's not that type of movie.

5037415,5,B006YTGLEU,"This review will be short and sweet: I found Enter Nowhere on the shelf of a local DVD rental store. It was a movie I'd never heard of, so I was immediately intrigued.

I always carry my iPhone with me to this rental store so that I can scan the bar code to check Amazon reviews. Three stars is my threshold. Four stars is the sweet spot. Anything above four stars is an automatic rental.

Enter Nowhere was highly rated. So I took a chance.

My wife and I are very glad I did. Enter Nowhere is a compelling movie that kept us watching to the end. The premise was unique. The acting was top-notch (especially for an Indie film from a first-time director). The characters were intriguing.

Our taste in movies runs to Indie films, quirky movies that are creative and different, often with actors we hadn't seen before. But we're not into quirky for the sake of quirky. David Lynch stretches the limits of what we tolerate. His movies are often just too weird. Predictable is bad. Too weird is bad. Creative, interesting, and different are good.

That's Enter Nowhere. It's creative, interesting, and different.

If your tastes are similar to ours, you could do a lot worse than Enter Nowhere.

If you have a chance to rent it, do so. Once you do, you'll likely want to buy it.

That's what we did. And that's what I'm doing right now -- buying Enter Nowhere.",1346630400,,1357,4.465587044534413
5037416,4,B006YTGLEU,"In 2011, the daughter of Sam Waterston and the son of Clint Eastwood got together with a ""distant relative"" of Bill Paxton and made a movie about unexpected family ties.  Neither here nor there in the overall scheme of ENTER NOWHERE; I just thought it was interesting.

Katherine Waterston plays Samantha, a married woman on her way with her husband to her in-laws' house in New Hampshire to tell them of her recently discovered pregnancy.  Along the way, their car runs out of gas and after the husband doesn't come back for a full day, Sam sets off into the woods in search of help.  She finds a small one-room cabin being occupied by Tom (Scott Eastwood), who claims to have run his car into a ditch three days earlier.  He's been staying in the cabin, waiting for an owner or someone to come along and give him a hand.

The next day, Tom decides to try to siphon the gas from his Jeep and transfer it to Samantha's car and get them both out of here.  While he's away doing that, Sam discovers a woman passed out on the porch of the cabin.  Jody (Sara Paxton) says she and her boyfriend got into a fight and he kicked her out of the car.  She's been walking through the woods trying to find help.

The three spend another below 0 night in the cabin and the next day Tom sets out to walk as far as he can in hopes of eventually finding civilization.  What he finds is that, walking too far in a straight line just brings him right back to the cabin.  Not only that, but while he was gone Samantha and Jody got into a bit of an argument over their location.  Sam thinks they're somewhere in New Hampshire while Jody insists they're in Wisconsin.  Tom, however, says they're in South Dakota.

This is all just to set the stage for the weirdness and the greatness of ENTER NOWHERE.  Despite a clumsy title, some leading dialogue and some lackluster acting, this was a very good movie.  I mean, I don't want to make it out to be LAWRENCE OF ARABIA or anything, it's not going to be hailed as a classic, and probably won't even be seen by many people, but for what it was, I liked it a lot.

Then again, I'm a sucker for those one-location movies that center around only a few characters.  I loved the premise of the first SAW until they started cutting away from the bathroom.  And the Tommy Lee Jones/Samuel L. Jackson movie THE SUNSET LIMITED was excellent, and not just because of the caliber of actors in it.  I just love those simple straight-to-the-point stories.  I love the mystery of things like this, three random people wind up at a particular place at a particular time and the viewer is left wondering how and why.  It's the writer and director's jobs to make sure we not only come to understand the how and why, but also to make it not suck.  And ENTER NOWHERE definitely does NOT suck.

I was also very pleased to see it didn't fall back on the tired clich I was afraid it was headed for, but instead took a braver, less expected road in its climax and resolution.

First time director Jack Heller is a little too heavy with the foreshadowing and I don't think he got the strongest performance he could have from Eastwood, while letting Paxton overplay her hand at times, but despite its flaws, I loved ENTER NOWERE and think it's easily a movie any fan of speculative fiction can enjoy.  I'm confused as to why it's labeled a horror movie (the DVD box calls it an ""official selection"" at Screamfest 2011), but it was that label that led me to see it in the first place, so I'll overlook that and just be thankful I got to see and enjoy it.",1346544000,,3553,4.335854765506808

Could the store clerk be ""Him"" or the other ""Him""? His steely calm demeanor and statements such as to his first ""customer"", ""I'll open it but I don't think you'll like what's inside. Interesting life you've chosen for yourself. All the things you could have done in life."" then to his second ""customer"" ""Damn shame you're living your life like this. All the things you could have done. ... I'll open it, but I don't think you have the stomach for what's inside."" Both monologues occur with a gun in his face robbery, yet he shows no reaction. His admonitions of responsibility, good judgment and decisions with consequences are suggestive of a ""not your run-of-the-mill"" human.

Negatives:
There were a few cheap effects (understandable given the low budget) such as the plane and bombs. A touch of discontinuity in camera angles and between scenes and locations that affected the flow of the story. A different title might have helped. A deeper discussion of time-space alteration or lives fated by a superior someone would have been interesting.
Positives:
Anyway, I thought it to be an original, creatively written script. The casting and music were spot on. The dialogue and actors' portrayals were naturalistic, intelligent and intense. The Pac-Man analogy was great. Above all was the manner in which the story was presented so that the audience was a participant in the discovery process at the same time as the characters. And, to anyone who figured out what was going on before the characters did, deserves a pat on the back. If you liked the problem solving in this movie I suggest looking at similar paradox, ""The Caller"".

I don't want to say too much about it as not to spoil anything. You won't be sorry you rented or bought this film. It's not a horror film nor is it scary or gory,what it is, is a fascinating psychological mystery. If you think you have it figured out You don't.

I loved the ending and I usually hate most endings.
Just think Twilight Zone meets The Outer Limits but much much better..

5037435,4,B006YTGLEU,"I, too, watch movies all the time and have purchased a few hundred DVDs, mostly suspense. I can't say that the genre of this movie is ""suspense"" or ""horror"" because I did not see any horror and the suspense stopped when the plot started to unravel and the movie continued to move forward. In fact when the truth about the characters was revealed it was emotional for me. I felt sensitive to their situation, rather than fear for their lives.  Though I was a bit disappointed that the movie was not more suspenseful, it was enjoyable and made me think about the possibility of time travel and/or parallel lives. I was thrilled with the last scene of the dairy mart robbery and the mystery of the safe. The movie kept my interest through out, though I did fast forward during the slow moving scenes. I certainly recommend it for movie buffs, but it is not one I will purchase for my collection as there is not need to go over it again.",1337990400,,933,4.424418604651163
5037436,4,B006YTGLEU,"Promoted as a ""horror"" movie, ENTER NOWHERE is more akin to an episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE or OUTER LIMITS.
The low-budget film focuses on three strangers brought together in an isolated cabin with no apparent reason.  As the story progresses, bizarre time and place inconsistencies emerge, setting the stage for the arrival of a fourth character who brings clearance to the mystery.
Director Jack Heller does well with the miniscule budget but doesn't elicit strong performances from his youthful cast.  Katherine Waterston (Sam's daughter) is the most effective as the demure Samantha, followed by Sara Paxton's coquettish floozy.  Scott Eastwood flounders in his role as the heroic Tom, while Shaun Sipsos doesn't have a lot to work with.
I applaud the movie's originality and its connection of a tricky plot.

5037440,5,B006YTGLEU,"Yes, it really is difficult to tell someone about the film without giving too much away. Everything slowly unwinds throughout the movie and it's beautiful. Great acting and no sexual content (just 2 quick, smooshed-face-against-smooshed-face kisses).

This is not a 'scary' movie at all, really. There are a few ""whose footsteps are those?"" moments, but no pop-out murderers or anything. Wonderful cerebral film, much like ""Wrecked"" where you figure out the man's story as the movie progresses. (But far better than ""Wrecked"", in my opinion-- and with dialouge...)

I guess this could be labeled a ""suspense"" because you're thinking, ""Oo, it's all coming together!"" often.

Good music and cinematography! The only negatives that stuck out were language (there's at least 10 F-words, a few GD's, among others); and, when a few punches were thrown, there were fake punch sound-effects, which are often used in big-shot movies, so no big deal.

5037449,5,B006YTGLEU,"I suspect many people will approach this movie (as I did), as newly minted Sara Paxton fans after being charmed by her in Ti West's nostalgic spook-fest The Innkeepers.  If this is the case, then by all means give this one a look.  This is another solid genre outing for the talented actress, especially if the gory Shark Night isn't your thing, or Last House on the Left is too intense.

The plot resembles nothing less than a classic Twilight Zone setup with many satisfying twists and reveals along the way.  I suspect the movie had a similar budget to your average Twilight Zone episode as well.  Most of the action is limited to one or two locations with the exception of a really cool opening scene set to a catchy rock song.  Don't let the Z-grade budget constraints stop you from enjoying the elaborate plot.  Sometimes the script can be a mouthful, but the young cast are game for it and really sell some of the more exposition laden moments.

My one complaint would be the lack of special features on the disc.  The sole extra being a short behind the scenes look that is mostly the first time director doing a little bit of shameless self promotion.  Never the less, his set looks fun and the little bit we do see of the actors together makes me think getting everyone together for an audio commentary would have made for a real worthwhile listen.

All in all this film comes highly recommended as an outstanding low budget genre thriller.",1335225600,4,1450,4.538461538461538

5037467,4,B006YTGLEU,"I rented this movie tonight online. I wasn't sure what to expect but the trailer interested me enough. The storyline reminded me a lot of the old Twilight Zone type story lines. There's no horror, or really suspense for that matter, as the trailers lead you to believe. However, the story line kept me interested through the entire movie. I didn't grow bored & grew anxious to find out what was really happening. 99% of the movie takes place in a cabin in the middle of the woods. 3 people wander upon it at separate times after incidences with cars breaking down. Together they try to find a way out but things aren't as they appear & they slowly start to put clues together as they try to get out.

The acting was another matter. Scott Eastwood was the worst, unfortunately. Given it was a low budget movie & the decent story line, it wasn't enough to ruin it for me. The one moment of special effects definitely reminded you of the budget. Overall, I liked it. It would have been better with better actors & maybe a slightly better budget to give the script the support it really needed. If you can look past that, it's a good movie.

There is very little food and the only the barest of supplies to last through the very cold nights. The acting, especially the two women, was really spot-on and well done. Each characterization came across quite well. It was interesting to watch how everything unfolded as they realized they were each an integral part of one another's way out of there.

The story moved right along, and I was not bored at all.
 It was a very clever script, co-written by Shawn Christensen. Actually, for a movie whos entire cast is only 4 actors, it has to be a DAMN good script to overcome their inexperience.

Christensen put together one of my favorite movies, ""Before I Disappear."" Christensen wrote, starred, directed, and his band did some of the music in that film.

Katherine Waterston and Sarah Paxton both need a LOT of work.

Waterston has quite an impressive resume of what must have been small roles in some notable films, but again these young women.........

I'm not sure about the German guy. It was hard to tell how well he delivered his lines. He didn't speak English, but I think he just might have been the best of the four.

I saw Scott Eastwood when he starred in ""The Longest Ride"" in 2015. Ohhh, it was not good.

I was desperate and rented it on Pay Per View, not expecting very much. There was just a limited synopsis, and it was a bit shocking to see Clint's clone show up!

For those of us who remember the TV show, ""Rawhide"" from the sixties, Scott looks exactly like a young Clint!

In the trivia here, on Scott's birth certificate, it says, ""Father declined"" I've read Clint was a real lothario.

There are a few stars that cannot act, who have been lucky enough to have long careers, and their acting has never improved. Rock Hudson comes to mind. It's kind of remarkable, with ALL the movies Hudson was in, that it didn't improve just by accident!  Keanu Reeves should thank God every day, twice a day!  Clint Eastwood is not as bad, but another one. HE had been a stuntman, and did all his own stunts in the ""Dirty Harry"" films that were UNBELIEVABLE.

As he got older, he learned how to rely on his famous scowl, and  gruff voice that covered a lot.
He and Ben Affleck were smart to learn to direct. They could call the shots and surround themselves with great actors so their modest abilities were not as noticeable. And of course, Clint is one of our best directors.
