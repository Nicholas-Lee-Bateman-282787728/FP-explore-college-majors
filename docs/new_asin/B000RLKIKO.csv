8325671,5,B000RLKIKO,What a great DVD. My kids were running around the house creating little props and putting on shows for their friends after the first viewing. I've personally found it invaluable when we have a party and put all the kids in the basement to play. It keeps them busy and entertained. The real bonus is eventually they start performing tricks for the parents and everyone has a great time.,1218585600,,385,4.594202898550725
