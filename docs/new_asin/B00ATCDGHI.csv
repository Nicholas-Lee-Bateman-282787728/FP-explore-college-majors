5509252,3,B00ATCDGHI,Movie deleted small but noticeable parts which were in the US movie. Why? Additional DVD of making of cut off suddenly at the end. No English subs for Yash Chopra interview.

5509253,5,B00ATCDGHI,"This was a fantastic movie, absolutely outstanding in score, script, acting and setting. I am a huge SRK fan and I'm hardly disappointed in whatever he does. I was extremely impressed by Anushka Sharma and quite pleased with Katrina Kaif's skills in this movie. I watched this in a movie theater and had the opportunity to enjoy the surround sound fully. The love story as always Bollywood scores high in my books. NOBODY DOES ROMANCE & LOVE LIKE BOLLYWOOD! Highly recommend this heart-warming story of the different seasons of love.",1357344000,,533,4.933333333333334
5509254,5,B00ATCDGHI,"A beautiful last love story created by the great Yash Chopra. The story portrays the wonderfulness of being in love along with the difficulties that are caused by it. In the first half of the story, Samar (Shahrukh Khan), is shown as a happy-go-lucky kind of guy, who has a lot of energy, and says what he thinks. Then he meets Meera (the Yash Chopra heroine), a daddy's girl who is about to marry a man she doesn't truely love. Meera is a woman who is refined and has a lot of self-control and makes baragins with God in order to get what she wants, along with this she also has walls built around her (why?... you'll have to watch). We only see these walls come down and the true Meera emerge when she is with Samar. But she has made a promise to God to marry the man her father wants her too, and when an accident happens to Samar, she believes it is her fault for going against her promise to God. Therefore, she promises that if he lives she will never meet him again. Samar lives and she tells him that she will no longer see him and will marry her fiance. In that instant we see Samar change to a cold man as his love walks out the door, he then tells God that he will put himself in danger every day in order to prove to Meera her baragin won't suffice to keep him alive. It is truely painful to see Samar walk out of the church with a stone cold look on his face, knowing that his love broke his heart and he will spend his life without her.

In the second half, ten years later, we see Samar has become a bomb defuser for the Indian Army. This is where Akira enters. A spirited girl, and very modern in her thinking of how relationships should work. She is a tom-boy who loves to have fun and is very intrigued by Samar, who she is following for a documentary that could make her career. She is interested in this hardened man who puts his life in danger. While with him she falls in love with him, I think it's because he is a broken man and she wants to put him together again, which is nothing she has felt with a man before, and she seems determined to make him forget about Meera.

And then comes the dilemma, Samar meets with another accident and loses his memory. The only thing he remembers is being with Meera, and does not recognize Akira, and continues to ask for Meera. I admire Akira for taking it upon herself to unite the two even though she loves him. She finds Meera and brings her to the hospital to see Samar, which the doctors believe will help him remember the past ten years. My favorite scene is when Samar and Meera meet after such a long time, it is so beautiful and sweet how they hug each other and you can see Meera allow herself a bit of happieness of being with him again. Samar is told that he is suffering from amnesia and what he remembers is from ten years ago. Because of this he believes that he and Meera have been together the entire time, and Meera plays along. The doctor tells her it will help him adjust and maybe remember but I think she truely does it because her love for him never ended, and this is a chance to be with him. Even though we can she her restrain herself when it comes to truely letting herself be with him there are moments in their time together that we see her allow herself the luxury of being with him. Eventually, Samar gets his memory back, in an unlikely event that I could have done without but it's a movie and reality should be left at the door anyways. He confronts Meera for making a mockery of his love for her by leading him on, and he leaves her crying in the same church where her baragins were made, and where the war began between Samar and God. I won't tell the ending but if you know Yash Chopra you can assume how the movie ends.

I think it is interesting that God is believed to be the obstacle in the way of Samar and Meera being together, but in reality Meera is the obstacle to their happily ever after. Her utter belif that she keeps her promises to God is both admirable and stupid as we become frustrated with her inability to realize God never intended for them to be apart. The story of Samar and Meera becomes a testament to Akira that true love exists, and modern views on relationships may be incorrect.

Now onto performances. Of course Shahrukh did wonderful as the happy guy bouncing from job to job, but he also did a wonderful job as the hardened man wary of letting people in. He is an actor who can really portray love, and does so in little nuances, such as a hand on a cheek, or a kiss on the forhead, he has it down. His chemistry with Katrina Kaif is very nice, and helps make the story believable. For this being Katrina Kaif's first serious romantic film I think she did great. She did a believable job portraying a self-restrained, and strong woman, who allows a man to come a sweep her off her feet. Some critics panned her performance for being to cold and ridged in spots, but I think this is how Yashji wanted it to be. She is loose and goofy only with Samar and restrained the other times, when she is reunited with Samar, I think she is supposed to show some coldness so that she can protect herself. The character Meera belongs to Kaif and she did a wonderful job portraying her. Anuskha Sharma does a great job playing Akira. Sharma very easily embodies this tom-boy hyper girl. But the moments in the movie where she is serious she also does very well, and she is able to cry on screen which is always a plus in portraying emotions! Other critics said that her character was too much and over the top, but if Sharma is representing modernism, which is overwhelming and all encompassing, then that is what the character needs to be as well, which is what she did. Some said her character has no dimension to her, but in the serious scenes we can see that is not true. Overall, all three did a wonderful job portraying their characters.

In the end, this is a beautiful love story that sweeps you off your feet. And it's extra special because it is the last great work we will see of Yash Chopra. Enjoy the movie because it is spectacular.",1357171200,38,6065,4.247619047619048

5509258,5,B00ATCDGHI,"I loved this movie. Have seen it three times so far. The story is great. As a Christian myself, I found the battle SRK has with God over the love of his life to be so true to life and the way she bargains with the Lord to supposedly get her prayers fulfilled is SO very much what many Christians think they have to do in order for Father God to hear and answer them. People get angry with God when things happen in their lives they don't like, so the spiritual part of the story was great as it showed the incredible misunderstanding of how the Lord works these two people were laboring under, which is much like how many people feel. The way he won her over was beautiful and touching. The first onscreen kiss from SRK was tender and sweet but very very sexy. The dance scene in the street was fantastic from SRK and Katrina. Anushka was sensational and nearly stole the show. Her interaction with SRK was great. So charming and lively and his reaction to her made it clear he would have gone for her if he had not given his heart to Katrina Kaif's character. The short film clip they showed of the piece Anushka's character had done for the Discovery Channel was surprisingly moving. There is something about Shah Rukh Khan when he speaks seriously from his heart, even the dialogue of a movie part, which moves the heart. He has the ability to generate such depth of character and display such sincerity that one simply believes every word which falls from his perfect lips. What a treasure the man is to the entire film industry, especially to India.",1504396800,3,1554,4.418118466898955

5509265,4,B00ATCDGHI,"Everyone who had anything to do with this production, did a wonderful job. The scenery in the first part of the movie was gorgeous. Wherever it is, I want to go there. There was one scene where Katrina Kaif's acting wasn't that great, but she was pretty good in the rest of the movie and she danced and sang well, if that was her voice. I liked her character's faith in Jesus. Her character's relationship with Jesus was more give and take than what I'm used to seeing. I enjoyed watching SRK while he portrayed this honorable character. His character's personality was similar to the altar ego in Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi. The best acting I've seen him do was in RNBDJ. I think it was the first Indian movie I saw him in that got my attention. Though there was a lot of scenes with their religion in that one, it was still an enjoyable movie. In Jab Tak Hai Jaan, the story was also good and it was fun to watch. I recognized many of the dances in this one that were in RNBDJ, but it was still entertaining the second time around. I love all the music in Jab Tak Hai Jaan. The later song and dance scenes that the reporter was doing, ran on longer than I liked, but she also sang and danced well and the music was good for dancing. (She was also the main actress in RNBDJ.)  I could have seen more of the street dancing, in JTHJ, because it was cool and was refreshing that strangers would have this camaraderie and skillfully danced with strangers. The dances were interesting and music was a good blend. It was disappointing that the reporter was an atheist in the story, but she was very likable, cute and very charming. I liked her energy, courage and boldness. She was also funny and joyful. I liked her better, and thought she and SRK's character made a perfect pair. The first time I saw this movie was on Netflix and liked it so well, that I bought it. It's also tempting to buy the soundtrack.",1495670400,2,1898,4.301675977653631

5509273,4,B00ATCDGHI,"Though I watch a lot of international films, I don't really watch much in the drama or romance genres. Jab Tak Hai Jaan ( or Until my Last Breath, I believe roughly translated) was an exception. It has a slow but steady pace, well done and enjoyable musical numbers and excellent cinematography.
For those who are new to Bollywood films, the film's production quality is exceptional and on par with other big Hollywood productions.
As for the story and characters, it reveals itself more casually than I'm used to, but it doesn't drag out unnecessarily for the most part. I feel there could have been more depth to the main characters, mostly Akira, and I would have liked there to be more focus on the supporting characters given the film's length (about 3 hours), hence the 4 instead of 5 stars.
As for myself, I find this film to be excellent for relaxing to or have playing in the background while I am working and would recommend it for a casual evening.",1485388800,,959,4.5813953488372094

I absolutely agree with the reviewers Avid Reader and G.

Shah Rukh Khan is always amazing and takes you from the screen into the story. He manages to be charming and sexy even when he is angry and angst-ridden. I truly am a fan of SRK! However, the movie didn't really deliver because the plot was so implausible. Like the other reviews, I had trouble believing anyone of any faith would believe their ""deal"" with God would keep them from love. That anyone would believe God accepts negotiations. Additionally, the lead female, although gorgeous, is so one dimensional. Sometimes when the script is bad, or the plot so predictable, a superior actor can elevate the movie so it becomes good. Not in this case. Katrina Kaif was flat and insipid. The female showstopper was Anushka Sharma. She was so good, there didn't seem any reason for SRK's character not to prefer her. The chemistry between SRK and Anushka was so good, she should have gotten the man. Another implausible twist that SRK should prefer Katrina, Why?",1476230400,,1036,4.7555555555555555

5509321,4,B00ATCDGHI,"One star minus for slow story after intermission.

Loved this movie, albeit its bollywoodish over-the-top twists (2 accidents & Co.) But one either loves this style or not.

Acting:
My first movie starring Katrina Kaif. I see what a lot of people wrote here. Me and my hubby also found her both dull looking. However, the longer the movie played the more we thought, this was just the way Yash wanted it. He was a great filmmaker and I trust his judgement upon casting Katrina Kaif. Still personally I have to credit her one scene, where Saman had his first m-bike accident and the realisation in her face of the impact about what she just promised to God was absolutely superb. You could feel she knew she made a mistake but felt 100% obliged to obey. She was stuck and decided to live with it. She's not the most expressive actress but I found her acting very subtle, if not extremely subtle. Almost to the point where things easily pass by unnoticed. You have to really LOOK when she's on. Anoushka, but also Rani would have been my personal choice. It remains a secret, what made Yash Chopra cast Katrina over anybody else. Maybe there were internal industry politics at play - who knows.

Shahrukh Khan, well, I have to agree with this one reviewer that wrote it suited him very much so, to play a mature role. I like Shahrukh Khans' acting style. In this role, I thought he was very intense and in my eyes he has topped any performance he's done so far in his career. I would even say, he even gets better the older he gets. His first on-screen kiss ... the background music accompanying the subway kiss made the whole scene extremely intense (especially for all girls glued to the screen to see how SRK kisses *LOL*). Yes, it was a subtle kiss but it seriously thrilled me  hell of a lot more than what you are nowadays used to see in film. It was VERY sexy. No need for more. And given the fact Shah Rukh Khan is almost 50, well, he's attractive, sensual and he delivers. Period.

Anoushka seriously stole Katrina the show. She was already a refreshing sight next to SRK in RNBDJ. But this one - she's on her way to become a big one in Bollywood I'd say. She plays Akira with such an ease, she spans from happy go lucky to sad just like that. Fabulous. I almost wished, Saman would fall for her in the end.

General:
See top. I thought it was at times a bit over the top, not realistic. But fact remains, that this is what Bollywood is. There is enough 08/15 in all Hollywood movies it's quite a relief to watch Bollywood movies (albeit not all) because they still allow wishful thinking that each of us has to some extend. It sure makes ME happy.
Story (maybe SPOILER ALERT):
The moment that got me sitting on the edge of my sofa that almost ripped me apart was towards the end, where Saman works on his last bomb before finally asking Meera THE question. I seriously was expecting the bomb to blow up. I think the last movie that got me on the edge of my seat was Alien, when I was 15.
I liked that Saman could appreciate Akiras' love to the extend that he promised to love her in his next life (again a typical Bollywood thought that I like). He probably must have thought also about getting together with her albeit the age difference but just couldn't forget Meera. This was nice.

LOVED the tunnel dance music. But still not at ease with Challa challa, even if its in my ears every since (I even hum it) ... The music in general though is very nice.

5509328,3,B00ATCDGHI,"Jab Tak Hai Jaan was a love story that never really blossomed. SRK was unable to save this film  because his main love interest was so stiff; her acting so unconvincing, that the love story died before it was full born. A better pairing would have been with Anuska Sharma, a young woman, who understood that the bomb specialist was older, but she was still willing to love and be loved by SRK'S character.  SRK'S character needed redemption and rebirth; Kaif's cardboard character with all her past inhibitions could not  offer that.

Anyway besides that the story is stupid, there is no chemistry between any of the leads. I love Shahrukh but he is getting too old to romance girls in their twenties. The acting is bad too and the movie feels like forever. A really really horrible movie. Just don't watch it.

You will love it.....",1391904000,,318,4.781818181818182
5509346,5,B00ATCDGHI,"This is one of those movies that after viewing you have to just sit and let your mind and heart digest everything you've just seen. This movie has some of the most visually stunning scenes, like the scene where Samar is walking Meera home after they made a promise at a church to never cross the line. Heer is playing (which is a gorgeous folk song sung in a calm, dreamy manner) and it's night with a light snow falling and Samar slowly turns away and the pure snow lands in the waves of Samar's lush black hair and he has a mixture of longing, sadness, and anger in his gaze. It moved me to tears. I love Shah Rukh's character Samar. He was working several jobs and didn't have that much going for him but had a beautiful outlook and a lot of energy and optimism. I don't care for Katrina's character Meera. I feel a coldness from her the whole film and she doesn't love Samar with the intensity that he loves her. She is rich and acts it, has a negative perspective and thinks she can make even God give her everything she wants. Her reasoning for shattering Samar's heart and staying out of his life does not make sense to anyone but her. Anuska's Akira, although much younger and a little too hyper, was a much better match for Samar and by that time in his life, brought back some of the positivity and energy he used to have, pre-Meera. The dance scene with Samar and Meera at the tunnel was amazing, forceful, and athletic. The physical intensity was captivating. Shah Rukh always says in interviews that he's not a good dancer but he must just mean learning the steps comes easier to other actors than him, because once he starts dancing onscreen you forget there are other actors. The scene at the London underground ""tube"" where Samar asks Meera ""If I kiss you, will you slap me?"" makes your heart feel like it's slipping. And they actually kiss on the mouth, which I've never seen Shah Rukh do, and that strange noise-music in the background that makes you nervous. It was very unexpected and sexier than any kissing scene I've ever seen, while still being tasteful and classier than Hollywood. There was definitely more chemistry and sexual tension between Samar and Meera than Samar and Akira but that's not necessarily what makes a good, working relationship. Even being a romantic, in real life I don't see Samar and Meera's relationship working. How often does happy, outgoing, hardworking, financially struggling immigrant meet rich, stubborn, snotty girl, they have nothing in common and they live happily ever after. Despite not liking Meera's personality, I love the movie. It felt like a very grown up role for Shah Rukh, if you've seen most of his movies you know what I mean. He gave a believable, real, yet enchanting dual performance. After the break up with Meera, even his posture seemed different. He was rigid and high strung, and walked and moved with muscles tight in a mechanical manner. His idealism had drained away and he was a man with an emotional wound so deep it was taking over his whole body. I imagine this would be a hard quality to portray realistically in a movie. While being overall a serious, emotional, moving story, it has funny and very charming moments in it. Like the scene when Samar is helping Meera hand out food at a soup kitchen and he's saying to each person ""Bon-apptight"" and keeping his room mate awake practicing the English pronunciation of salmon in the bathtub. There's a scene where Samar is sleeping with his mouth open, Meera gently closes it and he wakes up with this genuinely blissful smile. I can't say enough how impressed I am with Shah Rukh's performance in this. In life he seems like a very energetic, dramatic person and this shows in all his films, but then this film and My Name is Khan are such quiet, subtle performances that it looks almost effortless. This was Yash Chopra's last love letter to our world and he made it such a lovelier place to be.",1389225600,,3934,4.581560283687943
5509347,5,B00ATCDGHI,"It was great to see ShahRukh take on the persona of two distinctly different characters in this movie.  This first was a carefree, loving individual and the second a much more serious and tightly wound individual.  The dance number between Shahrukh and Katrina in the first part of the movie was fantastic!  I've never seen Shahrukh perform a dance number quite as athletic as this before and this was my first time ever seeing Katrina dance.  Of course it was also the first time I'd ever seen Shahrukh Khan actually kiss a woman in any of his movies, which was a bit of a surprise (part of his charm is being able to make love to a woman without actually kissing her)

The soldier in the second part of the film reminded me of the Jeremy Renner character in the Hurt Locker (i.e. a fearless bomb defuser).  I liked the dynamic between the soldier (Samar Anand)and the Anushka Sharma (Akira) character.  I was kind of rooting for her to ""get the guy"" but you knew that wasn't going to happen in a Yash Chopra love story.

Yash Chopra love stories always have beautiful scenery in them and this was no exception.  One of my favorite parts of the film was the tribute to Yash chopra in the closing sequences of the movie.  I'm glad this was a 3-DVD Set so that I could see the making of the dance and song sequences and the tribute to Yash at the premiere of the film.",1387756800,2,1367,4.367588932806324

We don't come across people like Samar Anand (Shah Rukh) or Meera (Katrina) anymore.

5509359,3,B00ATCDGHI,"It's very difficult to find a movie that SRK can't save and Chopra can't direct. This movie, as much as I wanted to love it, did not deliver. I personally blame the plot, Katrina Kaif's acting is no where near the par of SRK. There was a definitely a female-actress presence in this movie-but it was Anushka Sharma not Kaif. Her and Shahrukh could have made this movie better- despite the flimsy plot. The plot did not jive. SRK is supposed to be, easy going free-spirited guy that breaks Kaif from her ritzy, rigid life reveals to her the person she really is. They fall in love and then things take turn and then 'Intermisssion'. Just did not see Kaif as having ritzy, rigid life, and did not see any contrast between her before she met SRK and after so I did not get the 'swooping in and saving girl from her life' effect. It was difficult to displace myself and believe what the movie was selling as it was all centered around Kaif making promises to God in exchange for something she wants- she can't break the promise or something really bad happens. If God worked on us making and breaking promises- this world would have ended a long time ago. It was a very silly point to hang a two hour movie on. Usually these movies have multiple sub-conflicts to add depth to the story and characters.

The second half of the movie was the best part with SRK/Anushka.

The music was- again- okay. I really think they just brought in Katrina for the dancing- which is her only dominating skill-set in the movie.
It's worth a peek- just to see it. Rent it from your local Indian Video store- good luck finding one ;)

Overall- the casting, plot line and yes even the directing didn't sync together well to create the magic Chopra usually makes- Charm, Love, Music, Laughs.

This movie totally swept me off my feet. I am a man, and have seen a few love stories in my life, like Somewhere in Time, Doctor Zhivago, Love Story, etc. This movie tops them all.

The emotion of true love of a man and women has never been depicted on the silver screen like this one. I am a macho type man, and througout the movie I had wet eyes.

It reminded me a lot of my love story, and life today with my wife.  A real treasure. I am not Indian,so this is one of the first 3rd Hindi Movie I have seen and believe me this deserved an accademy award in all respects, storyline, acting, and music. I will never forget this film.

Of course Shah Rukh Khan will endure traffic accidents and memory lapses resulting from them . These accidents happen only to the hero and lengthen the spool of the story , the likes you have seen repeatedly in the Indian movies. But have faith as the hero always gets better to live happily with the heroine at the end.

5509376,4,B00ATCDGHI,"Veteran director Yash Chopra's last film ""Jab Tak Hai Jaan"" is a passionate romance with a wildly melodramatic storyline involving a love triangle, amnesia and a fearless bomb-squad leader with a past. Shahrukh Khan plays Major Samar Anand of the Indian army, who saves an aspiring video journalist Akira (Anushka Sharma) when she nearly drown in the lake.

Then the movie flashbacks to London ten years ago when a young and poor street singer/waiter Samar meets a rich and religious girl Meera Thapar (Katrina Kaif) in a church. They fall in love with each other, though their romance is interrupted in an unusual fashion.

Packed with star power, ""Jab Tak Hai Jaan"" is seldom boring with a story that is unapologetically melodramatic, and lovely musical sequences (with the score of A.R. Rahman). The beautiful location of Ladakh, the mountainous region where part of Shahrukh Khan's 1998 film ""Dil Se.."" was shot, is another plus.

While some might refuse to take the film's soap opera-ish story at its face value, as in Douglas Sirk movies, and find some meaning somewhere deep inside, others simply enjoy the romantic story with so many twist and turns.

I am purchasing the DVD to put in with my personal Shahrukh Khan DVD library, and can watch it whenever I want to. With SRK what's not to love. He is the best actor there is. Katrina and Anushka are also great along side of Shahrukh. The only fault I have, is in my opinon the kissing scenes were completely unnecessary. They looked very awkward and not natural, so I think it would have worked out better without these scenes. I know there wasn't much to them, but still would have liked it better without them.
The story line and movie was really great. LOVE LOVE LOVE anything with SRK. He's the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1366848000,,686,4.4523809523809526

5509395,5,B00ATCDGHI,"I really loved this film. It had all the components to be a big success. But something smelled like repetition and new at the same time.
-Time component: Again, 'Veer' had to wait, to see her love again, and as a top of it, he looses his memory.
-Another girl: He had to deal with this other girl. At least this time she was funny (because she wasn't a lawyer, right? lol)
-Another country: Well, she was in London, he was in India, but they were apart and it was unfair again, at least he wasn't in jail right?
-Army career: Veer was an army member, but this time, he was in the bomb squad, not a pilot, what a twist.
What do u think? since Veer-Zaara to Jab Tak Hai Jaan, what have they innovated?
And do you know what is the weirdest? I really loooove this film?

Their scenes together were quite lovely and there were moments of absolute acting brilliance with Shahrukh had Anushka.  For fans of Yashji and SRK, I would highly recommend this film to add to your collection.  SRK's scenes with Katrina were quite romantic and his first onscreen kiss.  I think it was a good idea that the kiss was cut just a bit from the original release, because the heat of it was probably a bit too much and a little embarrassing for Katrina.  I loved the tribute to Yashji and the behind the scenes and film extras are a lovely bonus.",1361577600,2,625,4.544642857142857

5509405,4,B00ATCDGHI,"With films such as Waqt, Ittefaq, Daag, Deewar, Kabhie Kabhie, Trishul, Chandni and Darr- movies which have redefined the face of Indian Cinema,  a Yash Chopra film  is a major event and can't be missed, especially if the director makes an announcement that this is going to be his final movie. Its also becomes a tragedy  because sadly enough, he passes away before the before the release of the film. Those are enough reasons to see the film. JTHJ is some of the old stuff in a new bottle- it is long 180 minutes but has many moments to keep you engaged throughout the film. As I said, this is old stuff but star power, cinematography and direction keep you hooked. I felt this was the tale of Meerabai adapted to modern sensibilities- the Meerabai (Katrina Kaif) is caught between her faith in Christ and love for a musician ( SRK). This story has its minor flaws and unfortunately hamper the film in places but has many strengths too.
Akira ( Anushka Sharma, a possibility that she will be a superstar soon) is doing an investigative piece on Explosive disposal experts when she stumbles on Samar ( SRK) and starts making a documentary on him. Through his diary and flashbacks we learn about his past and his carefree says on the streets of London, his meeting with Meera ( Katrina Kaif) and his lost love. However Samr is a bitter, loner today and while working on the documentary  Akira starts gravitating towards him and eventually even Samar starts reciprocating.  But fate has other plans.....
JTHJ is a decent, one time entertainer and is a tribute to a legend even though it is not one of his best works. The film is great but one is bound to be disappointed not because this is a mediocre film but just because expectations are manifold from a Yash Raj film- a strong reason for people to be disappointed.
I felt that although the movie was just ordinary but watchable- I was  extremely troubled by the quality of the movie soundtrack- when Yash Raj, AR Rahman and Gulzar announced their collaboration on their soundtrack- I had heavenly aspirations but the end result was poor. One of the weakest soundtracks of a Yash Chopra film.  My personal favorite was Heer Heer, the poem JTHJ and the best song - the title track at the end of the film set to the legend director directing his cast during the making of the film.
Anil Mehta captures the beauty and barrenness of Ladakh with his cinematography.
The leads are all amazing SRK, as usual great ( Can you give us more films like Darr, Chak de India and Om Shanti Om), he balances the youth and the middle aged progression of his act very well.  Anushka Sharma and Katrina Kaif are both great as well. The cameo piece of Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Singh is well integrated. The end of the film is weak and I felt something was missing in the last few scenes. One could only hope that JTHJ could have been the finest movie of Yash Chopra's career but this is because we have so many expectations out of his films. Watch this film as a tribute to one of the greatest film directors of all time....four stars. 1/29/2012",1360368000,,3075,4.527927927927928
5509406,5,B00ATCDGHI,"I bought Jab Tak Hai Jaan without ever reading a review or watching a preview, and I'm so glad I did! It's the last movie Shah Rukh Khan and director Yash Chopra made together before Chopra passed away, and he left a treasure before departing from this life!

This story is compelling, the music is VERY modern and fun, and the combination of characters, scenery and songs make for a very entertaining movie. There's also a shocking - but very happy - surprise in this movie for fans of Khan!

The only caution I would add is that this movie is rather more risque than most Bollywood films, so parents should be cautioned to check the rating.",1360281600,,642,4.478632478632479
5509407,5,B00ATCDGHI,Loved this movie it takes me back to old time romance.  All the actors did a great job and the music/dance is wonderful.

It was a relief to see some of the perfectionism that I'm used to seeing in a Shahrukh movie..great clothes, production values, scenery which have been missing in his last films.",1359504000,,440,4.802631578947368
5509412,3,B00ATCDGHI,"I love SRK and generally speaking love Yash Chopra's romantic comedies. This one just didn't quite deliver which saddened me really because I really wanted to love it. First off, I had trouble believing anyone of any faith was that superstitious that they would let some ""deal"" made with god keep them from someone they loved so deeply. That's a small god that can be bargained with so easily, makes you wonder why anyone would serve such a god. So that's my first gripe. Second, I just never connected with Katrina Kaif. She's pretty enough but her character, or maybe her acting, was flat and left me disbelieving this ""amazing"" connection that sent a man off to try and die to prove her and her ""god"" wrong. Thirdly, hard to say this because I adore SRK, and he did a great job but Anushka Sharma stole the show! I was rooting for her! I wanted HER to get the man. Akira was so vibrant and effervescent while Meera was so colorless, flat, and silly with her superstitious deals with god, seemed an obvious choice to me! Who wants a colorless mouse when you can have a beautiful butterfly? I was also able to look at my husband and predict several plot twists but that isn't uncommon so I won't harp on that one too much. It's an okay movie, I still enjoyed SRK, always do, I'm a huge fan, and especially Anushka, it was nice to see them on screen together again. It just left me feeling almost as flat as Meera came across on screen.",1359158400,19,1436,4.402255639097745

I had bought two copies of this movie one for me and one for my sister in law and she too enjoyed the movie.  Of course there is my teenage daughter who also enjoyed it very much.  I have to say that SRK looks very handsome with the beard and mustache it so makes him look like a totally different person, too bad he doesn't have this look in more of his movies.  Yash Chopra has done a fantastic job with his last movie and it funny how everything came together for him the music and lyrics from AR Rahman and Gulzar to the previews of this movie which was more in gear to a farewell to his directorial but god had other plans",1358467200,,871,4.034883720930233
