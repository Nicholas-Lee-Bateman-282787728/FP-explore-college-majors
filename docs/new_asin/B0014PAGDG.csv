8256147,5,B0014PAGDG,"Hello Madonna Lovers,

Just a little info that I pray is still correct, but you can quote me anyway.  Madonna has finished her contractual obligation with Warner Brothers and as concientious artists do she has moved on.  Madonna is now associated with Live Nation (distributed by Live Nation). I believe she was the first HUGE artist to sign with Live Nation. I don't know if she has become totally free (from a Record Company), but it is Madonna we are discussing and I just bet she owns more of Madonna than before.  I know this Celebration CD/DVD release was all done under the WB banner, however, I believe we are celebrating the dawning of a brand new era.  Let us take this journey with Madonna, glancing back at the first 26 as we prepare to take this ride into the future with her.  I'm sure she has many a surprise ahead!  I am TOO HAPPY!!!!!!  If all my info is wrong, jacked up, etc., feel free to hurt my feelings and let me know how dumb you think I am, but Research first if you have the time.",1253836800,7,1007,4.319148936170213

8256149,1,B0014PAGDG,"another waste of space on your dvd shelf!...whenever a dvd of MADONNA (whom i think is a complete genious)comes out with a crappy shot of her on the cover (and not endorsed by her or her publishing company)...and NO description of what's inside...is just another rip off person trying to benefit from her name. your money is better spent on her charity or any other charity for that matter...and any description saying it is worth buying it is only from the person (s) who actually marketed the dvd in the first place. people...don't be fooled by words like ""limited edition"" or ""collector's box"" unless endorsed by Live Nation or Warner Brothers or Sire.",1229990400,68,655,4.8053097345132745
8256150,3,B0014PAGDG,"In order for me to want to buy it, or choose not to, I want to know what's on it. Why doesn't Amazon always list what's on a DVD or CD? Please, if you've seen a DVD, or listened to a DVD, please include full content. All we have so far is  ""Yes, buy it"", ""No, don't buy it!"". How is that helpful? The only reason I rated it, is because I had to. I don't know how good it is/isn't, or what's on the 2 DVD set.",1227916800,33,408,3.6363636363636362
8256151,5,B0014PAGDG,Everyone should get a copy of this DVD to understand the reason why Madonna is who she is. She works hard and is not afraid to go after what she wants. That is also another reason why she is still on top of her game and still is and always will be the Queen of Pop!,1222905600,5,265,3.75
8256152,1,B0014PAGDG,Just say no!  That's all I'm saying.  Another rip off of two useless DVD's.  JUST SAY NO!,1219795200,16,89,4.117647058823529
