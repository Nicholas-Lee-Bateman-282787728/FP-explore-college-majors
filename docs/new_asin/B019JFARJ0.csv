8745394,5,B019JFARJ0,"Overall I thought it was excellent, intriguing and definitely worth looking into.
Two remote viewers are given a ""blind"" target and asked to draw on a whiteboard their impression of what they're viewing. They both come up with two similar (but separate) interpretations of what they're seeing, which on the surface, is absolutely fascinating. The data presented here helps fill in the blanks of what researchers have been trying to figure out for decades- who was involved and how was the JFK assassination plot carried out? As good as this DVD is, I can't help but think it could have taken even further. For example, in addition to the blind targets, why not just give them a target that is not blind, and ask them to interpret what they're seeing? This could have been a 12 part series. There could have been one on: Jack Ruby, H.L. Hunt, Oswald, the autopsy, CIA involvement, what happened to the shooters after the assassination?, who are the real identities of the planners- did they have official government titles?, was Texas oil involved? etc.

If the planners ""firewalled"" the plot, can we look into who these planners were and what happened to them? So many questions to be asked. Let's hope more sessions are conducted on this very important topic. Oh yea, I thought Part 1 and Part 2 should been part of the same package, instead of having to order them separately. Despite all those possible improvements with the set, the information presented is so interesting, I think it deserves 5 stars",1485561600,3,1505,4.8108108108108105
