6992311,4,B00STZ65VQ,"Martial arts, guns, and violence, all come together to create, an awesome action packed, and ass kicking good time. A perfect blend of drama, with a no holds bar fight fest, and eye opening adrenaline. Perfection in storytelling, and an ultimate imagery of violence that comes off as real, and also tension filled.

This is a great modern action film.

Your main character is a hit man named Gon. His last job, did not go so well and he ended up shooting and murdering a child. Now he is haunted by his action, but the bosses want him to finish the job, he flubbed up. A micro-chip containing a file could not be found and so now he must finish the job that he is haunted by. 3 people possibly have the file. Gon must locate all three. One is the mother of the child he accidentally killed.

6992312,3,B00STZ65VQ,"Tough guys and kids. What is it that makes them so fascinating? In Leon: The Professional an assassin reluctantly adopted a girl whose family was murdered and taught her the trade. In the 2010 South Korean film The Man from Nowhere, Lee Jeong-beom gave us the story of a pawnshop owner whose violent past enabled him to take on a drug- and organ-trafficking operation in order to save a child he befriended.

But in No Tears for the Dead (2014), writer-director Lee focuses on a hit man who connects with a child thats inexplicably sitting alone at a table in a nightclub. The assassin makes origami and funny faces and is obviously taken with her. But when the bullets start to fly, in the mass confusion he accidentally kills her. Later, when the big boss tells him to kill the mother, too, to clean up his mess, he starts out with every intention of doing so. But the closer he gets to her, the more reluctant he becomes. Before long, hes defending her against hordes of assassins who are trying to not just finish the job for him, but to get an important piece of information that shes holdingwith more than $100 million embezzlement money at stake.

Thats the premise in a nutshell, though its sometimes difficult to keep the thugs and the people they work for straight. Logic can be a bit strained, too, at times, as when an army of SWAT police surrounds the bad guys at a corporate building in Seoul, but thats pretty much the last we see of them other than a single guy reporting that he found nothingall because the filmmaker wanted to isolate the protagonist and his former mercenary pals for one last drag-out, kick-ass fight to the death. How fun would it be if the cops just showed up and took over? Then again, how crazy is it that they surround the building but then just disappear?

Thats one of several complaints I have about a film that still had me in its grip. Thats what a rain of bullets and buckets of blood will do. Realistic, ultraviolent action sequences are the chief strength of No Tears for the Dead. I haven't seen a car so shot full of holes since Bonnie and Clyde. Unfortunately, the narrative also had a few holes. A backstory involving the hit man Gon (Jang Dong-gun) seems token at best and doesnt tonally connect with the rest of the film. And how exactly the woman (Kim Min-hee) is involved with the bad guys can be a bit of a head-scratcher. The same holds true for the brotherhood of assassins theme that suddenly comes into play in the third act when the main villain Chaoz (Brian Tee) tees off against the hero.

In a 30-minute interview dubbed a commentary, the director admits theres very little action for a good hour after the initial effects sequences, but adds that he was trying to give the hero and his intended target the chance to get to know each other. Im not sure its worth the trade-off, but thankfully the action picks up enough to where we don't have much time to dwell on such vagaries. Lee said he wanted to forego the noir style thats typical of such films and instead go for open spaces, open air, and daylightall of which pose challenges for realistic action. But as I said, the action is the films main strength. Aside from some spurting blood thats done for stylistics, its some of the most realistic stunt work and effects that Ive seenincluding a memorable car crunch and a take-out scene where a man is shot at multiple times point-blank and is blown backwards. That the director didn't resort to slo-mo or editing tricks and opted to do his action work in the bright light of day ought to make action fans giddyeven if the plot and character relationships aren't as developed as Lee thinks they are.

No Tears for the Dead has a runtime of 116 minutes and is not ratedthough it would easily merit an R here in America its so ultraviolent. The dubbed version is kind of clunky, but if you watch it in Korean with English subtitles youll find it worthwhile.",1425340800,2,3924,4.513361462728551
6992313,5,B00STZ65VQ,"When a movie can boast its action scenes rival THE RAID 2, you should stop what you're doing and watch it immediately.  THE RAID and THE RAID 2 are two epic films with some amazing fight choreography, so any movie that can come close to what they offer is a must-see.  NO TEARS FOR THE DEAD is the latest release from director Jeong-Beom Lee, and while it does not offer as much fighting as THE RAID franchise, the film offers the same quality of action and much more.  This movie in itself is epic, primarily because it is an emotional drama that is laced with intense action and brutal realism.

I am really impressed with how much emotion is in this film.  The cast does an amazing job of conveying the guilt and agony they are experiencing to the audience, which makes this movie very immersive.  I was spellbound just as much by the emotional suffering as the intense action sequences.

NO TEARS FOR THE DEAD is shot very well and looks great from a visual perspective.  The cinematography is very well done, especially when it comes to the fight scenes.  Too many times, cinematographers try to do too much, which makes the fighting choppy and hard to follow; not so, here.  These are fluid and well-framed, making the action very enjoyable to watch.

As mentioned above, the cast is phenomenal, with Dong-gun Jang portraying Gon and Min-hee Kim as Mogyeong.  Both give stellar performances, and both deserve the equivalent of Oscars, in my opinion.  I hope to see both onscreen in future titles.
** I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

The fighting in NO TEARS FOR THE DEAD is intense and lethal.  Granted, theres not as many fight scenes as a RAID film, however there are plenty enough here to satisfy action fanatics of all ranks.  And the action we get is well-done and entertaining.  From fist-fights to gun battles, the blood splatters and the blows land as the cast wages war on each other.

NO TEARS FOR THE DEAD is an excellent film, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good time.  The English dub-over is solid in case you don't feel like reading subtitles, and the HD of the Blu-ray is superb.  Give this a look the next time you're in the mood for a drama with some kick.  I doubt you will regret it.",1424304000,16,2260,4.490196078431373

We are shown the torment of both the victims mother and the killer as he tries to deal with the gult that consumes him throughout the film and also his traumatic past.

6992333,2,B00STZ65VQ,"From the team that brought you the brilliant ""The Man from Nowhere,"" a melodramatic let down. Clearly attempting to follow up on that film's success, it presents a similar core plot: isolated hit-man with grief in his past ends up caring for a woman - in the older movie, an adorable little girl, in this one...and that's where the difference is infinite...

The new woman to be protected is an M&A shark, introduced when suggesting to purchase a pharmaceutical company while divesting from another. When a colleague remarks that the to be divested company is popular for the drugs it brought to market, and that this would mean firing their employees, she coldly points out that they are here for profits, not compassion; and this happens within days of her daughter's death. That you should care about her is implied by the most trite of cliches: she's *a mother (whose child died...)*, and her own mother suffers from dementia. Well, I'm suddenly seeing cut-throat types in finance in an entirely different light as they also fulfill a biological role in this world. Additionally, she's involved in trying to screw over triads in the U.S. and Asia, or at least her husband was (I found the plot rather unclear in this regard) - and when a cop, in a police station, dares to point this out to her, she slaps him with impunity. I could not help but see more honor on the side of organized crime than with her and those around her. For those knowing ""The Man from..."", it utterly lacked the motivation provided by the cruel crimes happening in the background there, and the genuine innocence, astonishingly good acting, and rapport established with the hero through many conversations of the little girl to be saved in the older movie. When the hero cries at the end of that movie, I have tears in my eyes; here, I found myself hoping to finally - finally! - see The Mother being shot.

The film's production values, acting, score, and such, are all fine; and the action sequences not bad. So if you can deal with the grating melodrama and unlikable damsel-in-distress, the film is worth a shot.",1517875200,,2095,4.705722070844686

Too many WTFs for how a character got somewhere suddenly, and the smart woman was way too benumbed by the violence to accept her insanity as pitiful -- she should have tried a lot harder and thought a lot more about survival, but noooooooooooo we the audience had to groan TOO MANY TIMES.  Dark Asian morality tale.  Not for me. Never at any time was I sure about what was going down, and that includes the last minute of the film.

6992349,3,B00STZ65VQ,"This movie is perhaps one of the more ambitious movies from South Korea that I've seen in awhile. The film has concerted efforts to make an international appeal with voice actors that speak almost half the movie in English, Korean, and even at parts Spanish. Not only that, but the shootout sequences are breath taking. However, for a movie to be complete in my view, it needs a passable plot that allows viewers to be invested in the characters. This movie is lacking in that department. The plot that is used in this film is generic, tired, and well-worn by the final act. It becomes obvious that the film has no idea how to convey an idea and allow the viewer to come to the desired conclusion, so instead scenes are forced down the throat of the viewer in attempts to ensure that you as a viewer 'know how to feel about this situation.' The first half of the film by far makes this agonizing to bear, and wishing for the characters to stop talking and start shooting. And once it does, you'll find that this is a passable film, though made average and tedious by a plot that puts you to sleep between the bullets.",1475712000,,1117,4.427184466019417

Theres more to the plot obviously but I don't wanna spoil any of it. The lead actor Jang Dong-gun does an excellent job as Gon the hitman, the rest of the cast is equally very good also. The action scenes are brutal & very bloody, its sometimes just unrelenting & Hollywood should take notice, this is how action movies are done. Its one of the few films where I can honestly say I loved everything about it from start to finish. Music is also well done.

6992368,4,B00STZ65VQ,"For starters, let me start this review by saying overall, it is a good movie. There are some pretty cool sequences in the film. The story is good. The acting is good. But when the cover states ""Action Scenes Rival Raid 2"", I would have to say this is a bit of false advertising. Any action movie fan knows the Raid and the Raid 2 are two of the best action movies in terms of the actual action. There are fight scenes and fight moves not seen in any other movies. That being said, while I watched No Tears for the Dead, I kept waiting to see a scene that compared to the Raid movies. By the end credits, I do not remember seeing any similarities.

Here is the plot and it may contain a few SPOILERS but I will try to be a little more vague. The star of the movie is a hitman who botched a job. He accidentally ended up killing someone he didn't intend to. This hits him very hard and he has a hard time recovering from this. To make things worse, his boss orders him to clean up his mess and this takes him to Seoul. He was born there but was raised in the United States. He was sent there to take care of his loose ends, but he ends up making a personal decision that now sets the wheels in motion for others to go to Seoul to now take care of THIS loose end. What happens next is a series of gunfights and a few unexpected plot twists.

The gunfights in this movie were done well. There were a few fist/knife fights that were also done well. But this film was a more Shoot'em Up type film than a film similar to the Raid or the Raid 2.  This movie had more emotion to it that the Raid. You could see remorse in the face of the star and anguish in the face of the female lead.

A few of the things that could have been better. People were almost indestructible in this film. If someone gets shot, it should take them a little time to recover and not just jump into the next scene. A few scenes, you think someone should have died yet they are able to recover.

Overall, I liked this movie. It had a dark overtone that a lot of Korean action movies have and the acting/action was good. I would have seen the movie based on seeing a preview of it, but was lured in by the ""Action Scenes Rival the Raid 2"" tagline on the box that is a bit misleading. Don't mention the Raid/Raid 2 if you are nothing like it.",1430956800,8,2306,4.037199124726477

When he botches what was supposed to be his last job by killing an innocent kid, he is sent to Korea to fix what he screwed up by killing the kid's mother. It sounds a bit like a fish out of water story, but the movie only proves that the crime world is the crime world no matter what country you are from. Some of the criminals were speaking up to three different languages, but in the crime game there are only two languages in you really need to know money and guns. I gave it a score of 3 stars.

6992372,4,B00STZ65VQ,"This is a fast paced action film from Korean director Lee Jeong- beom, who brought us the AMAZING film ""The Man from Nowhere"" (  Ajeossi ""Mister"").  This film of a hitman with honor is reminiscent of an 80's John Woo film.  Jang Dong-gun (of ""Taegukgi"" & ""The Warrior's Way"" fame) plays the hitman who grows a conscience.  Great action & solid acting, but for crying out loud watch in Korean (with subtitles) otherwise you won't get the ""solid acting"".  It's a very good movie, and I would definitely recommend ""No Tears for the Dead"" to action fans.",1427932800,4,550,4.628865979381444

8699241,5,B00STZ65VQ,"NO TEARS FOR THE DEAD - Jeong-beom Lee - South Korea - 2014 - Crime | Drama
Stray dog / lone wolf / hooker with a heart of gold / killer with a conscience / idealist in a corrupt profession / man with no name / blind swordsman / rebel without a cause / schizophrenic matriarch. Entire movies have been built around this single narrative motif. Directors have ranged in character and artistic integrity from Mario Bava to Akira Kurosawa. Even those ensconced in the pantheon of la nouvelle vague have spun this bottle to good effect. Jeong-beom Lee knows how to run the game like nobody's business. His 2010 THE MAN FROM NOWHERE struck chords all over the place; one of them was mine. He is a thorough professional who is conversant in the brutal as well as the tender. For humans the two matters are not so much opposites as routinely sides of the same bent coin. Neither exist in nature, only appetite and reflex. We oh-so-messy people persons have cornered the market on both and business has never been better. Abeoji gamdog* Lee has a cinematic language that reminds me of Kar-Wai Wong; not so much the febrile palette as the unwavering competence. You can sense his shot composition in the soles of your feet. He directs emotions full frontal, does it well, and if he is understood, gets away with it. NO TEARS has come in for its share of misunderstanding. I don't buy it. If you want Danny Trejo simplicity, go see it; this is a mustang of an alternate hue. If you confuse distress with schmaltz, check out something easier to chew. NO TEAR's principal is as baroquely conflicted as those found in Miike or Kitano oeuvres. It suits me right down to the ground. Said principal's backstory also incorporates a slice that would make Tiger Woods code out. Now I'm ready to finish Joon-Hwan Jang's 2013 HWAYI : A MONSTER BOY. The South Korean vibe is talking to me. It's been a while. (yes, OCD peeps, I used the correct form. buh.)

8699242,4,B00STZ65VQ,"It's a good action movie. However compare to the man from nowhere, the story is not that good. Some scenes are a bit boring like memory at the end.",1531699200,,147,4.103448275862069
8699243,4,B00STZ65VQ,"the biggest suspension of disbelief in these types of movies, and my bone to pick in so many of it's genre:  when they are busy shooting up half of Korea in endless locales and with all sorts of loud automatic weapons, inside buildings, outside, on the streets, on roofs, etc and so on;  WHERE ARE THE POLICE?  so Korea, or any other locale in these movies, is the total wild west where excessive and constant gunfire, explosions and damage can be done with no interference whatsoever from the police??

to me, it distracts from the movie, and any of it's ilk.  Too bad, because other than that, and a few other impossibilities, this could have been a 5 star movie, as the acting and direction are that good.",1529366400,,708,4.5
8699244,5,B00STZ65VQ,"This is what a Korean/International TARANTINO movie would look like!!! and I mean that in the best way.  From the opening scene, you are on an action roller-coaster and through the climax, with the snow falling, contrasting with all the realistic amount of gore throughout, and grounded in the reality of human emotions/reactions, all the way to the surprising epilogue, this movie does NOT disappoint.
Unless you are fluent in English, Korean, and Spanish, you will need the subtitles, but it's the 21st century, and this movie is worth the tiny effort to follow along.  Although, some of the surprises had me holding my breath, and then rewinding to figure out WHAT JUST HAPPENED???!!!
This must be an awesome cinematic experience in a theater with a good sound system.  I'm definitely going to have to keep an eye out.....hope it's an experience available in the States somewhere......",1528588800,,888,5.0272108843537415

Storyline gets a bit cheesy at parts, but this is by the same guy who did Man From Nowhere, and I think it's actually a hair stronger in the action department (and a hair weaker in the plot department). Best action director working right now imo, must watch for fans of the old ultra-violence.",1528329600,,317,4.578947368421052

I wasn't expecting it to me so thrilling!  I thought the ending was a perfect finish.  Bravo to direction and acting.  I recommend that you turn on the language setting for the whole movie as it goes back and forth from English to Korean throughout, and it's not hard to relate to.
