8604018,2,B0018Q7JZ4,"As a long time Michael Jackson fan, I thought this video would be very inspiring.  I thought it would show how many fans Michael had all over the world, and how they would support him even in his darkest hours.  I thought it would touch on the facts of the 2005 trial, including information not covered by the media, especially from real Jackson insiders.  I don't know, I just expected this documentary to be...good.  Instead the filmmaker decided to follow around the lives of a select few enthusiastic fans, most of whom are unattractive.  A particular example is of one woman with bad skin and a very noticeable beard who speaks on having no friends and MJ filling that gap.  And the camera can't get enough of her, including multiple closeups.  Another young man lives on the street, bouncing between motel stays and another homeless man's RV.  His only aspiration in life was to shake Michael Jackson's hand, and after that...he doesn't know.  It leaves one wondering if these are what MJ's fans look like, then who would want to be one?  And it implies that MJ only attracts the rejects of society, and most normal people would not support him.

In short, it is a very poor representation of the love and admiration held for the pop superstar all over the world.  Fans from everywhere supported Michael during his 2005 molestation trial, where he was found innocent on all charges.  If the filmmaker wanted to accurately portray this, they could have.  Instead, they chose to pick the lemons in the crowd and make the entire film about them.  It was not flattering at all.  The two stars I give this film are as generous as I can give, and only because I cannot bring myself to rate an MJ related documentary one star.

Skip it if you are a true fan.  There might be a few bright spots in this film that I missed, but overall, I was left after watching this film vowing to never watch it again.",1298160000,2,1901,4.541176470588235
