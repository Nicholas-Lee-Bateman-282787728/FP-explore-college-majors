8057460,2,B00096S32M,"Not nearly as good as I had hoped it would be. ULTIMATE HERO contains three movies. HERCULES UNCHAINED is a very nice full-frame print of a pretty common Steve Reeves title. GIANT OF MARATHON is another Reeves film, but it's letterboxed. This print is not as impressive as the one on the Muscle Madness set. The set's biggest disappointment is SAMSON AND THE SEVEN MIRACLES OF THE WORLD with Gordon Scott. This was recommended as the only letterboxed version of this film available, but look close - it's really a full screen image squished down to letterbox proportions with all of the characters appearing rather fat thoughout the movie. Ugh! Not worth a dime.",1423785600,,662,4.815789473684211
8057461,1,B00096S32M,"I'm sorry, but these films look awful.  I have widescreen, very nice copies of both Hercules Unchained, and The Giant of Marathon.  So, I was hoping the ""widescreen"" presentation of Samson and the Seven Miracles of the World, would at least be a decent copy. It is not. It is washed out to the point of being unwatchable, to me, in anyway.  I'm sorry I bought this product. And, so you know, there are widescreen, very decent prints, of Hercules Unchained and The Giant of Marathon available to purchase.",1423353600,,504,4.640449438202247
8057462,4,B00096S32M,"Just a note SAMSON AND THE SEVEN MIRACLES OF THE WORLD is not Widescreen, its the same print Alpha
put out Full Screen and all they have done is chop of the top and bottom ,to give you
a Widescreen version which is cutting of even more of the picture than the Full Screen.

So be warned, I fell for it thinking it was a proper 2.35.1 Widescreen print.
 Oh well back to the drawing board.

Maybe someday we shall see a proper Widescreen print. I live in hope.",1289779200,9,458,4.123595505617978
8057463,5,B00096S32M,"I'm a fan of sword and sandal films. They amuse me to no end thanks to the seriousness that afford very silly plots (a guy in a loin cloth rambling about fighting rubber monsters? oh please). One of the things I've found is that the films tend to play better if you can see them as close to their original form as possible. As such I am constantly trying to find letterboxed and more complete versions of films that have been chopped up by uncaring TV stations and film distributors.  In the quest to find better versions of the films I like I'm constantly re-buying the films again and again (thankfully the sword and sandal films tend to be really cheap).

I have the three films in this set at least one other time in my collection. And I'm happy to say that the versions on this disc are among the best.

Hercules Unchained is a beautiful copy. It looks like it was made from a restored version of some sort. Yes its pan and scan but it looks so good you won't mind, especially since the compositions seem fine.

Giant of Marathon is good, but slightly worn version of the film.

The real find here is the version of Samson and the Seven Miracles of the World. Its a more or less complete version (its about 2 minutes short of IMDB's run time), with good color and a good image. Best of all its letterboxed. This is Only the second time I've run across the film letterboxed but its light years ahead of the truly terrible version that Retromedia put out to initial high hopes (it was to be the film letterboxed at last-and it was- sort of-mostly it was a scratch worn print missing 20 minutes of running time). This is the real deal the version of the film that you'll want to pick up.

Actually this is the version of all the films you'll want to pick up since its three very good films for a very cheap price.",1260748800,14,1815,4.292397660818714
