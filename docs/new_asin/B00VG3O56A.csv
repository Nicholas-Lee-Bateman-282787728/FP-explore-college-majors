8709970,3,B00VG3O56A,"THIS MOVIE HAD A LOT OF HIGH EXPECTATIONS GOING INTO IT. FILMED IN GERMANY JUDGING BY THE ACCENTS (EVEN THOSE WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO BE ""AMERICAN""MILITARY), A SMALL VILLAGE IN BAVARIA IS INVADED BY BIG EYED, BIG HEADED ALIENS! SET AROUND THE LATE 1940'S ( 2 YEARS OR SO AFTER WORLD WAR II) THE POOR VILLAGERS/SCIENTISTS/MILITARY ATTEMPT TO CONTAIN THESE ZOMBIE-ALIENS. THE MOVIE IS DIRECTED VERY SLOWLY, AND DOESN'T START JUMPING UNTIL 50 MINUTES INTO THE FILM! GOOD POINTS: ALIENS ARE RETRO ""X-FILES"" TYPE OF MONSTERS, SOME SCENES ARE FOGGY AND SPOOKY. OVERALL, NICE TO WATCH LATE AT NIGHT WHEN YOU'RE GROGGY. I LOVE RETRO-STYLE CINEMA. BUT WITH GERMAN DIALOGUE (ENGLISH IN CLOSED CAPTION) AND DULL PERFORMANCES, IT WAS ROUGH GOING FOR A TIME. STILL, I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT! FILM IS FROM OLIVE FILMS, WHICH MEANS GOOD PICTURE/SOUND. A BETTER PICTURE FOR RETRO CREATURE FEATURES LOVERS IS THE IRISH-PRODUCED ""GRABBERS"". FAST PACED, VERY FUNNY, AND LOTS OF SLIMY CREATURES!
