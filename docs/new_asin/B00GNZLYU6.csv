6094370,5,B00GNZLYU6,"I dare say we've got our first cult classic teen flick since I can't even remember when! In the same vein as ""Fast Times"" and ""Valley Girl"", it's that movie parents will despise but their kids will love. Don't be misled by the pretty poster, this audacious indie doesn't hold back and contains a ton of f-bomb ladled dialogue and unpunished drug use. I highly recommend ""Getting That Girl"" to any high school comedy aficionado, or really anyone who wants a realistic yet comedic peak into what Hollywood teens are really up to these days.",1390867200,4,538,4.673684210526316
6094371,5,B00GNZLYU6,"Great Movie!  Brings you back to those good ole high school days of teen drama,  loving someone and getting through your senior year.  Brought back some memories that was great to remember and some not so great, but the movie in all was a love story that had a perfect ending!  I highly recommend it!",1390780800,3,300,4.4
6094372,5,B00GNZLYU6,"Great young actors, strong story tension and one of the best movie sound tracks.  I have never seen a movie quite like this before.  You'll either love it or hate it but in either case it makes an impression.  With F-bomb laden dialogue and songs like ""Blow Off My Dick,"" I daresay this movie is not for everyone.  I personally am about 20 years too old for this film, however, ""Getting That Girl"" is an entertaining and reflective watch for any teenager.",1390003200,2,455,4.512195121951219
6094373,1,B00GNZLYU6,Should have known from the beginning song this movie was going to be low class.  One of the worst movies I have ever made the mistake of renting.  Skipped through most till and watched the last 2 min. Horrible.,1389916800,2,210,4.358974358974359
6094374,5,B00GNZLYU6,"Solid directing & acting bring to life this story about the various trials & tribulations of the ""new girl"" at a Southern California high school.  An winning combination of hilarious scenes as well as dramatic moments, with excellent performances throughout, give the film a truthful sensibility and makes for a very entertaining viewing experience!",1389571200,2,349,5.462962962962963
6094375,3,B00GNZLYU6,"Other Amazoners have opined that this movie is basically formulaic.

I agree with that.  But, still...

A decent effort that has a message, and as the price is right,

I'd invite you to check it out...oh, and this movie is 'voiced' in the language

of today, so be forewarned...

Three stars!",1417910400,,292,4.627450980392157
6094376,1,B00GNZLYU6,"Absolutely ridiculous! I have never felt the need to turn off a movie before watching this horrible movie. The fact that someone views teenagers like this makes me really worried about the younger generation. The language is horrifying! The ""f"" word is used more than you would hear at a construction sight!! They even swear in front of their parents and other adults like it's no big deal, and the parents don't even react! It was not a well written script at all! I don't know where the writers went to school but I don't remember high school being anything like this.",1411776000,,570,4.598039215686274
6094377,5,B00GNZLYU6,"I love this movie. Classic Chick Flick material, but kinda a twist on the characters' personalities. I honestly don't think the girl is very good at acting, but mostly everybody else is. And the guys in this movie! Wow.",1407628800,,219,4.641025641025641

6094379,5,B00GNZLYU6,"This movie was simply genius! It was a bit like those 80's John Hughes movies but with a lot more edge and comedy. I watched it three times back to back the first night, so it definitely has a train wreck quality to it.",1398470400,,219,4.0
6094380,2,B00GNZLYU6,"The lead guy and girl were cute.  But the language!  and then the amount of pot smoking.  Sheesh.  I teach elementary school and I have no children so I'm not up on what's going on with highschoolers but if this is it, it is truly scary.  This is what they consider normal?  My parents were all the way up in my business, as well as my brother's.  As a result, we got no where near this sort of stuff. Anyway, as I watched the movie, I couldn't focus because I was too distracted by the alarming thought that people who are teenagers today are going to be running things in a few years.  If this is how they're starting off, I might have to start getting ready like one of those doomsday preppers.  The acting was so-so and I think the movie was trying to make a point about maturing.  It didn't come across clearly.",1395705600,2,816,4.2064516129032254
6094381,5,B00GNZLYU6,"This movie has a lot of universal qualities and is a great low-budget cinematic portrayal of modern day Los Angeles teen life. However, I dare say I don't think Getting That Girl is for everyone. I've read some very mixed reviews, so I know there's a good chunk of people who watch this and instantly start seething fire. This movie is very rebellious to put it mildly, so it's no big surprise that it angers these older/bitter people who are actually spending their time watching this thing.

If you're a parent of a teen or pre-teen and want to buy something for your kid that they will actually respect you for, this movie makes for a great stocking stuffer or birthday gift. On this level I highly, highly recommend it!",1393718400,,723,4.561538461538461
6094382,1,B00GNZLYU6,"*SPOILERS. So many SPOILERS*

I'm not even sure where to start. This movie...oh man, this movie. I thought it was going to be a cute and somewhat clever indie teen dramedy. It was not. It wasn't any of those things and a pox on the house of the movie gods who allowed this movie to released out into the wild.

Andy and Ferret are the two school super stoners. They are in the last two months of their senior year of high school in Southern California. They are casually drinking some beer and smoking a joint before going to their first class, discussing ridiculousness, unaware that their world is about to be turned upside down by a new addition to the school; Mandy. Mandy's hot and smart. Andy's smitten. I mean, yeah, he's a stoner but as Ferret points out those smart girls love to try and change Andy. Oh, Andy's got a chance.

Let's stop here for a minute and discuss the music. I thought the music was going to be great. The song used in the trailer is good. The movie itself? No. NO no no. It starts off with a really heinous song about sniffing blow off some dude's junk. Argh. It doesn't get any better from there. I had to tune out the music because it was just making me punchy.

So there's a party where Mandy meets everyone after she's befriended by the school's mean girls. Andy's kind of digging her but he ends up sleepiing with some freshman at the party. Meanwhile, Mandy's being hit on by the school's dumb jock. Really dumb. I couldn't figure out if he had a mental disability and the movie was making fun of it or he was just supposed to be an extreme stereotype. Either way it was so exaggerated and wrong.

Oh, a lot of coke gets done in this movie too. A lot. Actually, it seems like all these kids do is get high, drink, and sleep with each other. How are any of them graduating? Ugh.

A love letter gets written after the party. By who? By Andy to Mandy and I just realized that their names rhyme. Oh, for heaven's sake...

By this time things are just getting super random and I have no idea what this movie is trying to be or what it's trying to say. It's rambling like the drunk, high kids that are its focal point. Anyway, somehow Mandy realizes that Andy wrote her the love letter and they end up going to the beach together after school. They're giggling, being pseudo deep about the beach and whatnot and then Mandy says something along the lines of Andy not being anything like the rumors she's heard. Now, keep in mind, Andy is EXACTLY like the rumors. What rumors? He'll stick his junk in anything but only freshmen are naive enough to let him go there. But Andy is being so sweet at the beach. The rumors can't be true!! Despite this Mandy is sucked in and ends up sucking something of Andy's. No condom. Mandy's not quite as smart as we thought. Well, actually, I never thought she was smart but whatever.

This is where I sort of started to tune out. The drama reached critical propotions and I wanted to smack everyone but Ferret in the face. Ferret was actually the only character that made any kind of sense.

At the end of this movie I was wondering if it seemed stupid because I was an East Coast kid and just didn't understand what it was like to go to school in Southern California. Even when I was 16 I would have told all of those idiots to get a grip. But no, this movie seemed stupid because it was a low-budget hot mess. So many minutes of my life that I can never get back.",1393286400,15,3429,4.279320987654321
6094383,5,B00GNZLYU6,It was very good. I love drama romance movies so it was perfect for me. I give it 5 stars.,1391817600,2,90,3.55

Likewise, the entire male senior class has also taken notice of Mandy, and she's soon being chased by both an apathetic yet charismatic stoner, and a star football player.",1391558400,,382,5.063492063492063

8625200,5,B00GNZLYU6,"The product was shipped so fast and great quality. If you've never seen this movie and are debating the purchase, I 100% recommend. Not only is the product great, the movie is a once in a life time experience. The plot jumps around so nothing is cohesive and yet you find yourself laughing the whole time. The writing, actors, scenery, everything is half done but so incredibly entertaining. I originally bought this as a white elephant gift but quickly realized what a great conversation piece this movie is and showed it to all my friends.",1488067200,,541,4.705263157894737
