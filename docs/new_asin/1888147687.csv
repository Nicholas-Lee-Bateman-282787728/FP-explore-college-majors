8379331,3,1888147687,"The first thing I noticed about this video was that you didn't had it on a DVD format.

The second was that it was played on GRASS.

The third, the video is too expensive for what it has to offer.

First of all I thought the video was going to show Bocce being played on grass and flannel surfaces simultaneously.

We live in a retirement community and all Bocce games or tournaments are done or played on FLANNEL SURFACES.

WE HAVE NO LAWN BOCCE, therefore most of your lessons or tips in the video does not apply to us.

I was hoping the video would have demonstrated the proper grip and ball release and or delivery, which of course changes from that of lawn bocce when played in flannel surfaces.

I will only recommend this video to someone who wants to learn how to play LAWN BOCCE.

The history on how Bocce first started was interesting and the

the Bocce rules were easy to understand and easy to follow.
