7847996,4,630344766X,"My daughter got this video last year for Christmas. We are watching it today for the first time in several months, and I am complelled to write a review I should have written last January.  The video is great- my 6 year old loves it- that was the problem. From the beginning, the tape itself had a few places where the picture would jump, but I couldn't pry it from her to return it for replacement. I fiqured we could live with the bad tape quality since it was only a few tiny places, but it has gotten much worse over time.
Just beware that while the content is good, you may be better off with another video- or maybe mine is just a bum tape.",1073174400,5,646,4.126984126984127
7847997,5,630344766X,"This video showcases the 1994 National Championships event finals.  You get to see Dominique Dawes, the 94 National Champ, doing full routines on all 4 events, along with Shannon Miller.  Amanda Borden is shown on bars and floor, Jennie Thompson is shown on beam and floor, and Amy Chow is shown on vault (the top 3 scoring athletes on each event are shown).  There is also a short men's segment featuring fragments of routines done by 94 National Champ Scott Keswick, Steve McCain, John Roethlisberger, and Mihai Bagiu.  There is also a short segment on the jr. women that features 94 Jr. Champ Dominique Moceanu and Doni Thompson.  Athletes are interviewed about their training hours, an explanation of Kerri Strug's absence is mentioned, and a report is done on Christy Henrich. The amount of gymnastics shown is good, considering the tape is 55 minutes.  This is a great tape for those like me who did not get to see this competition!",1026604800,22,938,4.795031055900621
