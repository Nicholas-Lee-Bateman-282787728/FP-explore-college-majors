8379999,5,B002TAP3ZG,"Par for the course that legendary names pop up in the GRANDES PELEAS series, and it's the same-ol', same-ol' with the 36th volume. Huge knockout victories brought on by relentless pressure fighters, there's more of that on this DVD. The theme is a short night's work as none of these bouts go the full rounds. We're treated to ten blistering matches featuring dedicated bringers of pain such as Julio Cesar Chavez, Tommy ""the Hitman"" Hearns, Felix Trinidad, Manny ""Pacman"" Pacquiao, and many more.

Julio Cesar Chavez was a vicious, vicious body puncher and one of the most fearsome fighters in the history of boxing and maybe the most well regarded boxer in Mexico's history. On March 18.1991, he made an easy night of his beatdown of John Duplessis, who was never in the fight and chose to get on his bicycle for the duration. Dude got stretched anyway.

Juan Manuel Lopez is still fairly early in his career, but the potential seems limitless for this hard-hitting boricua. In 2008 Juanma graduated to contender status by mauling ferocious Mexican Daniel Ponce de Leon in one shocking round. On this DVD we see Lopez's demolition of Sergio ""Rocky"" Medina. Sheesh, I tuned in to this one back on December 6, 2008 and blinked and missed the whole damn fight. Three knockdowns and it was done and over in one minute, 36 seconds. The boxing world now awaits Lopez's highly anticipated war with fellow blue chipper Yuriorkis Gamboa.

Beloved of the boricuas, Felix Trinidad's gangly frame and boyish facade belied a wicked left hooker, an implacable pressure fighter. In a window of 13 months, from February 1999 to March 2000, Tito took out three American Olympic gold medalists (Pernell Whitaker, Oscar de la Hoya, David Reid). On the other hand, Trinidad's fight with Mahenge Zulu on April 3, 1998 isn't close to being as impressive, simply because Zulu's pedigree wasn't all that, even though Zulu was game and very unorthodox. But, no, it wasn't too long before he kissed the canvas.

The current dark cloud hovering over boxing has to do with the most mouthwatering fight in years not being made between Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather Jr. I frankly blame both parties and their boneheaded posturings, but the most horrible thing to come out of all this may be the casting of aspersions regarding Pacquiao's character, and yes I'm talking performance enhancing drugs. I absolutely don't believe that Pacquiao takes PEDs, but this is one of those effed up things where rumors can taint an illustrious career. Pacquiao's third date with Erik Morales took place on November 18, 2006 and marks El Terrible's 3rd round submission to the Pacman. On that night, Manny was again just too much of a two-fisted storm and you can tell with the third knockdown, by Morales's tiny shake of the head at his corner, that he didn't want any more fists to the face. The trilogy goes to Pacquiao.

The aftermath of the Omar Chavez/Marco Nazareth welterweight fight reminds us just how very brutal and costly this sport can be. These two took each other on with gusto on July 18, 2009, willingly trading and head hunting and sometimes swinging wild. Omar Chavez, my preferred son of Julio Cesar Chavez (over the overprotected JCC, Jr.), was the marquee fighter, but Nazareth gallantly took up the challenge and he never gave up, even when he was rocked with vicious head shots. Nazareth suffered a TKO loss and fainted in the ring. Four days later he died of brain hemorrhaging, of too many punches to the head. Note for the vultures, Nazareth's fainting and being carried out in a stretcher aren't included on the DVD.

The next three bouts feature Tommy Hearns, giving us a chance to revisit the daunting skill sets which made him such a dangerous combatant. Tall for his weight class, blessed with an incredible reach, an awesome right hand, and underrated boxing acumen, he was a terror in the welter and middleweight divisions, but not so much when he moved even higher in weight. He was already past his prime when he took on that poor bastard Andrew Maynard on November 6, 1993, but the Hitman was able to carry his power at this cruiserweight level and he shook up Mr. Maynard several times to the tune of a one round stoppage.

Next up is the Hitman's absolutely classic showdown with Marvelous Marvin Hagler on April 15, 1985 for the undisputed middleweight championship. These are three of the most spirited rounds ever fought in the squared circle, and both fighters got hurt in this one. When it was all over, Hearns had flashed his cocky grin and danced his wobbly dance. And a cut and bloodied Marvelous, with his granite beard and rough and relentless tactics, had thoroughly effed him up.

Tommy Hearn's welterweight outing with Pipino Cuevas is the earliest of his fights featured here, and you can see how he later evolved into a more heavily muscled version. Back in August 2, 1980, he still flaunted a very cut but lankier build. But the right hand's never changed; it always had dynamite. If you thought the Motor City Cobra (Hearns' other nickname) did a funny two-step when Hagler touched him, check out Cuevas's even more pronounced leg twist.

My opinion, up there with the Hagler/Hearns conflagration is Big George Foreman's ""You fall, I fall"" seesaw brawl with Ron Lyle on January 24, 1976. 27-year-old George took Lyle on after taking a year off after getting rope-a-doped by Ali in Zaire and losing his aura of invincibility. Lyle came to fight, and Foreman's rust rapidly showed. This is an amazing fight, with more twists than a slinky. Foreman and Lyle hit the floor more times than a one-legged drunk during a quake. Just when you thought one guy was well and truly out of it, boom! the tables got turned. Another cool thing is that Howard Cosell provides the fight commentary, and he perhaps sums up this sucker best: ""What an incredible fight! Utterly without boxing skill, just punching away, each fighter in turn leaving himself open."" It ends with a 5th round knockout. What is uncool is the annoying audio feedback heard in the last few rounds. Some kind of buzzing noise.

Black trunks, no socks, malevolent stare. Mike Tyson's staredown is so wicked intimidating it makes opponents whiz in their cup protectors. In retrospect, what chance did Michael Spinks really have back on June 27, 1988? Spinks, normally a pretty good fighter, was undefeated going into this one. But on this night he was well out of his comfort zone and was devastated and humiliated in one brutal round. But Spinks shouldn't feel bad. Tyson in his heyday did that to everyone.

Note that the Chavez/Nazareth and Hearns/Cuevas fights feature Spanish fight commentary. The other bouts are excitedly play-by-played in English.",1262995200,,6728,4.8417391304347825
