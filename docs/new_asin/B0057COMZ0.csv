8460503,5,B0057COMZ0,"I am a big fan of Julia Bradbury and watch her show whenever I am in the UK.  A few years ago my husband and I walked the Coast to Coast Path and I have been hoping to buy Julia Bradbury's series on that walk.  When I was given this DVD as a gift I had no idea what to expect and was thrilled to watch every episode.  Julia Bradbury takes you on a series of fell walks in the Lake District, following in the footsteps of Alfred Wainwright.  The scenery is stunning, the aerial photography made me want to book a ticket on the next flight, and her narration captures the love that Wainwright felt for the Lake District.  The DVD showcases a series of hikes; it does not showcase the lovely towns and villages of the area.  If you are a fan of Wainwright and love to hike then you would no doubt enjoy this DVD; if you want a travelogue of the Lake District then it would no doubt disappoint.",1326758400,7,890,4.115606936416185
8460504,2,B0057COMZ0,"This was disappointing. The English Lake District is an incredibly lovely area, which is why it has been a major tourist attraction for over 250 years. My wife and I know the area well; she is native to the place. We were looking forward to seeing familiar sights and sites once again. Unfortunately and incredibly, the photography was not good. In any case, the photographers spent most of their film on the (not very) attractive presenter and the little that was left on the landscape. The presenter also issued a continuous stream of narration; usually inane and sometimes silly. This rather boring narration overrode the lovely sounds of the area, water, wind and birds, even she was talking about these sounds. As I said, disappointing.",1322697600,10,741,4.936
