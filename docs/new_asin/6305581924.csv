But I give it 5 stars solely because the cast includes Judy Carne who I just think is the most adorable little gal whom I cannot see enough of. Hopefully her part in this movie will make up for the very disappointing role she had in QB V11 where her one appearance lasted all of about 45 seconds.",1117756800,,348,4.057971014492754
