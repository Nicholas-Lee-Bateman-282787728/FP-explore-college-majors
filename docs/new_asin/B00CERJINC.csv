5720665,1,B00CERJINC,"No story, no plot, the dialogue is weak, the special effects are bad. The best thing that I can say about this movie is that it is relatively short.",1374796800,3,148,4.137931034482759
5720666,1,B00CERJINC,"While the concept is very interesting, the movie itself leaves much to be desired. First off this is another one of those handheld camera movies that seem to be all too popular among horror films. I wouldn't really call this a horror or a thriller movie though as all the typical elements of that genre are lacking; nothing really jumps out to scare you and the monsters tend to be ill suited for any suspenseful chase. Most of the movie is spent wondering why all the main protagonist stand around as if waiting for the monsters to kill them instead of running or at least creating some sort of distance. Oddly enough the few times the group actually takes flight they are successful in momentarily escaping. Secondly there are a half dozen cheesy scenes where the monster comes right up to the camera guy, stands right in front of him,starts to swing, and magically misses every time. After a while you start to realize that the director does this for no other reason than to say, ""Here's a close up of these monsters we worked so hard to create."" Finally, the plot itself is entirely lacking (as if this needs mentioning). The entire time you kind of just sit there in the dark waiting for the few hasty dialogues that either open up more questions than you started with or reveal information the characters should only know if they read the summary of the movie. Lastly, if you are waiting to see the insane doctor put together one of his contraptions prepare to be disappointed. The only work you get to see by this doctor is him remove half of one persons brain and replace it with half of another persons. If I could go back an hour and a half I would rather just watch the trailer a few times and save an hour. You will get to see all the neat monsters in some of their prime moments without all the bad movie elements to ruin it.",1374796800,6,1838,4.424778761061947
5720667,5,B00CERJINC,"I'm not particular fond of 'found footage horror', the dubious sub-genre that the Blair Witch had popularized has given us an extremely small handful of good movies, but an avalanche of truly terrible ones. Thankfully this low-budget WW2/mad scientist romp is firmly in the former. And while there are many flaws to be said about this film, I did find myself enjoying it, bizarre steampunk Hellraiser-esque monstrosities and all. Don't come into the film expecting deep characters that you'll care about as this is pretty superficial stuff, however taken for what it is (a low-budget horror more concerned about visual treats) it is very accomplished despite the lack of budget",1516147200,,677,5.163636363636364

Ripping of these three movies became common practice in the 80s, especially in Italy via Bruno Mattei and Claudio Fragasso. However, the art direction and creature design in this one definitely take the cake. The whole concept is extremely creative, retro and, most of all,  hits just the right spot in being grotesque and aberrant. And there is also a significant amount of innards spilled, for all the gore-hounds out there.

A squad of Russian soldiers is sent to investigate a strange location and make a terrifying discovery.  They bring with them a combat filmographer who uses two classic film cameras to follow them.  Of course nothing is what it seems and the discoveries and twists are part of the fun.

The film is low budget but the creative team really took the time to invest in character designs.  It reminded me of a cross between Silent Hill and Star Wars in terms of design.  Sadly that low budget crops up in some rather fake looking monster appendages (razor sharp claws that look plastic) but I would love to see what this team could do with a big budget.

Frankenstein's Army is a pretty cool horror flick.  Nice production design, nice interior sets, terrific monster designs, a fantastic mad doctor fleshed out by Czech actor Karel Roden... But in the end I feel there are a couple of flaws that left me wondering about what this horror movie could have been with very few changes (an instant cult classic).

First of all, a first-person found footage concept is ok as it can make everything looks more realistic BUT,  I don't really think it works for a movie set during the days of WWII. Even if it's horror themed movie. Sooner or later either you may start wondering about some technical aspects (was it possible to shoot 84 minutes of film the way they do back in those days??) or you just don't put too much credibility on the whole thing. They are in 1945, it's not like having a handheld camera in the 90s. There is just something  wrong about it.
So, I ended up having a bad contradiction feeling about the allegedly realism of the film.

The other thing, in my opinion, is that these hideous creatures are not as menacing and terrible as the film tries to make us believe.
Many a time they jump right onto the camera with no fatal consequences and it just seems like they are either sloppy, very slow-paced, not very dangerous or outright blind.
Of course they eventually manage to either kill or aprehend almost the entire Soviet platoon but...Some just look like very outlandish punk-horror experiments.
I would only  have added some more supernatural soldiers with the same zombie-like faces used in the movie but with less elaborated and practical costumes and some kind of cannons or firearms included.",1463702400,2,1882,4.689024390243903
5720711,2,B00CERJINC,"Sometimes a movie drops in your lap that you really look forward to seeing.  If this happens to you with this flick, as they say in the South, ""Bless your heart"".  I wasn't so lucky.  This movie just hurt to me.

The end of WWII and the Nazi's are desperate.  The Americans are on one side, the Russians on the other.  Both are knocking at Hitler's proverbial door.  The Nazi scientists decide to create the ultimate soldiers out of bits and pieces of their dead soldiers using the journals of one Viktor von Frankenstein.

Why can't we get along? Dr. Frankenstein is planning part of a lobe from a Nazi's brain and match it to a lobe from a Communist's brain but he's short on Communist samples until during the last days of the war he lures a Communist patrol on a rescue mission. What Frankenstein doesn't know concerns the KGB. Word has reached Moscow about his experiments with the unloving for an army and they want him dead or alive. So they send a film crew with a Soviet patrol into the area. They have promised the director a deal on his family if he fulfills the top secret mission. There are no spoilers in this film. No suspense. It's a monster film inside a war film that's a black comedy, and rather ironic. Once the Russian patrol enters the village the film reminds me of Night of the Living Dead.

5720728,4,B00CERJINC,"Nazi Germany, 1945: As The Red Army advances towards Berlin, a Russian reconnaissance team cuts a swathe of destruction through the German countryside. Composed of battle-hardened veterans, the reconnaissance teams exploits are documented by Soviet propaganda cameraman, Dmitri. When they receive a distress call from a Russian infantry unit, the team head towards a wrecked village where they find a desert of corpses. Investigating further, they suddenly find themselves under relentless attack by a decidedly bizarre enemy.

""Frankensteins Army"" is a gloriously inventive and decidedly gory take on the found footage horror film which features excellent performances from a largely unknown cast and some supremely innovative production design.

Director Richard Raaphorst does an excellent job of capturing the weary cynicism of his battle-hardened protagonists as they advance through the apocalyptic countryside of a nation thats tearing itself apart in the death-throes of war. Its a testament to Raaphorsts talent as a director that I could quite easily have foregone the horrific elements of the story and simply watched an entire war film based solely around the members of his Soviet platoon; luckily, Raaphorst is just as even-handed a director when the films horrific content comes to the fore and does an excellent job of taking what could have been an extremely tired set of survival horror clichs, revitalizing them, and incorporating them into a compulsively watchable horrific action-thriller.

Bart Beekmans camerawork veers between a believably cinema-verite style during the films 'documentary' sequences and the style of first-person shooter games such as ""Return To Castle Wolfenstein"" during the films plentiful battle sequences. But for me, the real stand-out of the film are Jindrich Kocs brilliant production design and Raaphorsts creature designs which take the best visual elements from the work of Terry Gilliam and the industrial music and steampunk subcultures (as well as movies like ""Labyrinth"" and Marilyn Mansons ""Beautiful People"" video-clip) and weaves them into a nightmarish tapestry of scientific monstrosities.

""Frankensteins Army"" is something of a low-budget triumph. Its well-made, relentless and possessed of an extremely dark and cynical sense of humour. It has cult-hit-in-the-making written all over it.",1432598400,,2352,5.711428571428572
5720729,3,B00CERJINC,"First in Frankenstein's Army , the story is a simple and allows only for testosterone grandeur, devoid of emotion or care for personality. The characters on both sides of this brutal opera are despicable in nature. You want to see the Russians die because essentially they are portrayed as war-mongering, heartless thugs- with no visible humanity. So that puts the uncomfortable light of heroics on seeing the Nazi monsters slaughter these a-holes. Yet Nazis are inherently disgusting reflections of man, so I never allowed myself to entertain that concept of pleasure in watching the creatures kill the soldiers. However something about the way the story was directed lead me to believe the writers and director wanted me to see the Nazis as some antihero, because the Russian soldiers where put in an obviously bad light in the film.  That was conflicting for me. Plus the actors kept slipping in and out of their characters accents. Half the time the hinted toward American or British accents before returning to Russian or German twangs.

There is the opposite side to the film though- The gore and action was killer. The intense, constant atmosphere held my attention the entire film. The monsters where some of the most creative designs I have seen in cinema in a long while, and the special effects pretty much rocked it from start to finish. In the end pretty much every one dies so that was pleasurable to watch-because they all really needed to so I could walk away from the film without feeling dirty for watching something that seemed to glorify the whole Nazi science-occult theme, under the guise of sci-fi-fantasy. I have to note that this is my issue I deal with when watching pretty much any of the Nazi themed sci-fi-horror stuff that has been coming out. I am always focusing on the storys intent, fearing that the film will over romanticize Nazi fetishism.

This leads them to a small mining village that appears abandoned but why not investigate. This is where the film really starts to pick up.
No CGI just really well done makeup which im very impressed with versus ruining it with cgi, these guys cared about how the creatures looked and it shows.

This is definitely for adults (kids can watch too) but what I mean  to say is this. Remember when you watched the original Frankenstein movies as a kid and how it held your attention through your kid's imagination? Well this will do the same now that you are an adult. The old Frankenstein movies are still great to watch for nostalgia, but they don't hold us captivated as they used to. This will make you have that feeling again. The sets are great and the monsters are cool and although some of the dialog is funny, it is just what the doctor ordered. (maybe not Dr. Frankenstein). This is a scientist that has discovered Dr. Frankenstein's recipe for reviving dead organs (people etc.) towards the end of World War II. A Russian squad stumbles into the village where the scientist is doing his experiments. Some of the things they say have a hint of truth, for example, when one of the soldiers yells at the scientist and calls him crazy, he laughs and says ""Crazy?, I am not crazy, Nazis crazy, Communists crazy, Capitalists crazy"" I laughed at this in the middle of horrific brain surgery and found some truth in it.

Special features: making of documentary. See seller Mrkish2013. Cast members: Joshua Sasse, Luke Newberry, Robert Gwilym, Hon Ping Tang, Alexander Mercury, Andrei Zayats, Mark Stevenson, Karel Rosen as Viktor Frankenstein. Again this has pov/found footage feel. At the moment the soldiers are just milling around. The music is interesting. Liked the look of the trailer. Contains strong language, gore, violence. Trying to understand what these guys are saying, some have strong accents. Bleak surroundings as it is in war. They've met a German farmer. Some Polish folk about. Cruel scene with a rabbit.

5720764,3,B00CERJINC,"I have to say I was a bit surprised how good this film actually was. Now I'm not saying it's great by any means, but I guess my expectations were pretty low to begin with. From the title and the plot alone, you can't take a movie like this too serious. If you do, you're going to hate it. There's some movies you just have to sit back and kinda throw your brain out the window and just enjoy something for what it is. And I guess that's one of big reasons why I liked this one. But to be fair, this film did have some pretty cool elements to it. First off, the best part of the entire film are the monsters of Frankenstein's ""Army"". Sure some of them look a bit cheesy and over the top, but the creative design and nature or most of them were really cool. There were some really creative minds behind the making of these things. It's some of the most original and interesting looking creatures that I've seen in a horror film in quite some time. And with that being said, from what I've read (I've not seen any bonus features that may explain it), most if not all of the effects were done with real props and no CGI, which is pretty awesome and commendable. I knew they had to very little CGI used just because of how the effects looked in the film. Using real effects bring a sense of realism to horror films. Even though the subject matter or effect itself may be over the top, cheesy, or look fake, it still looks ""real"" when real props are used. Besides the 'army', there are some decent gore effects in this one. Again, its not very realistic looking, with a lot of it done kinda ""tongue in cheek"", but I feel it wasn't meant to be taken too serious to begin with. Which again, is a plus for any film like this when the creators/writers/ know not to try to turn a film into something it isn't.
  Now as far as how the film is made, it is a found footage film. But like I said, you have to kinda throw logic out the window. This film takes place in WW2 and sure, there were cameras used in the field like that. And the filmmakers attempted to give it a grainy looking filter to make it a bit authentic, but let's be honest, its just silly to believe that the camerawork, sound, etc was that good back in the 1940s. And that the camera guy is ALWAYS filming, no matter what. Or that the monster can NEVER seen to actually hurt him or kill him even though he's got a camera right in their faces. At first, I thought that this style of film wasn't necessary or that it wouldn't work too well. But as the action sequences happened and the monsters were revealed, I saw that it did work. Those sequences are the best in the film. It has a certain video game style feel to it. First person perspective in very close or maze-like locations, turning corners and seeing these monsters right in your face, it really did feel very up close and personal. I thought it was quite effective.
  So why have I waited until now to even mention the plot? Because I think its the least important. It's really an afterthought for me, and that's not really a bad thing for a film like this. A crazy doctor is creating a monster army from dead Nazi soldiers. Yeah, there's a little more subplot added in, but really, who cares. If you're watching this film wanting ""The Shining"" then you're should re-evaluate how you watch movies. The acting isn't that bad, but the characters are very forgettable, which again, I have no problem with.
  In closing, the monsters are the first and foremost reason to see this one. The special effects have that 80s cheesy feel to them. The film isn't too long, the pacing is ok, and the action/camerawork during the chase scenes are done really well.  So if you're a horror fan looking for something just to be entertained for an hour or so, this one is worth a watch.",1397779200,,3783,4.282517482517482

There they meet up with FRANKENSTEIN'S ARMY, a ragtag band of roving, death-dealing electricity and gasoline powered monstrosities.  The violence is graphic, the effects are well done, the production design was great, Karl Roden is superb as the insane flesh cobbler and if you're like me and like to watch Nazi cyborgs dealt with violently, buy the ticket and take this ride.

This movie came with a very interesting premise, an idea that could have been fantastic; unfortunately it also brought characters (the heroes/victims) who we were glad to see die, as they were as detestable & unlikable a bunch since the group in PREDATOR'S, along with monsters that were so slow, plodding, mindless, & wracket raising in their approach whenever they popped up (yet somehow they always managed to kill at least one (trained?) heavily armed soldier before being easily shot, burned, blown up, etc) as to preclude any suspense or horror value (that's unless you're frightened by things that lumber around waving their arms like Robby The Robot from the old Forbidden Planet). It isn't scary at all or even gut-wrenching (is that even a good thing, or just shorthand for 'no story, no plot, no acting - you'll just throw up & swear you had a good time?) as the sleeve notes describe it. The so-called 'shocks' are lame & can be spotted coming a mile away (like when one guy's helmet gets jammed way down onto his head & by trying to pull it off, his comrades tear off the top of his skull & rip his brain out - woops!). More than anything, it was like watching somone's vacation home video of a trip to a sideshow funhouse or the 'haunted' mansion on the boardwalk someplace - noisy, corny but maybe kind of a little cool looking in a technical way, & just not very effective at all.",1395792000,,1611,4.6328671328671325

5720775,2,B00CERJINC,"I like the concept, and I hate to slam something that's as original as this film, but in the end the execution is lacking.  The director's reach exceeded his grasp here and it's not particularly pleasant doing an inventory of all the mistakes that make what should have been an wonderful exercise in horror cinema into a big yawn.  It doesn't help that the whole film resembles a video game in it's style, so I was thinking that it resembled a video game preview video and it just might be exactly that--not a movie intended to stand on its own but an attempt to build interest in a video game.  I'm sorry, but that would just make me angry--not happy.  I don't want a movie that should have come with a warning sticker: ""This film contains what is really an advertisement for a future video game.""  That's not OK.  So, assuming that it ISN'T a video game teaser, then it's not a horror/comedy either.  It could have been, since the whole thing sounds like a joke and zombie comedies can be great (such as ""Army of Darkness"" or ""Shaun of the Dead"") but this ain't funny.  I think the Dutch are too somber to make a funny zombie movie.  So, THEY SHOULDN'T TRY.  What this film needs is fewer lame ""jokes"" (I THINK they are jokes...maybe) and more serious, grim, nasty, evil stuff to disturb the viewer.  You see, I don't dislike nasty movies as long as they are honest and clear about what they are trying to do.  This one isn't.

5720776,3,B00CERJINC,"This is the kind of film that half stars should be around to honor.  True, this is a low budget film, and they do try to do a lot for cheap and don't always get the biggest bang.  But that is the mystique of B Films: the mesh of different ideas, even genres, in the attempt to make something new and amazing.  While this isn't the most earth shaking of films, it does deserve a watch to anyone who enjoys a good thrill ride.

Parts of this film strain the illusion of the film; being so bad at points it cant be preplanned.  The accents, most of all, make it nearly impossible to make out every word; however, the ones that count seem to make through pretty clear.  Acting, especially from the ensemble in B horror, is often noted for being for very strong.  However, sympathy does extend past the protagonist, even though this is not Honor For God and Kremlin unit, more suited to Apocalypse Now.

Film and media homages are really at the back bone of the film; although some, again, strain the illusion.  The shooting of a WWII era film in color moves is a little disconcerting at first.  The mix of camera lens cuts gives a fresh editing approach, though, as does the fades and cut outs.  Building upon the found footage genre (Blair Witch, Rec., Diary of the Dead), it also picks up on the kitsch of Nazi Zombies (Dead Snow, The Outpost) which already incorporates aspects of diesel punk (Sucker Punch, Hell Boy), in combination of highly stylized monsters (Pans labyrinth, Silent Hill), and even the classic B monster movie (The Thing From Another World, Robot Monster).  The manner in which the first person film is presented, moments feel like their from a regular film, other times in the found footage, and even yet as though it is part of a first person video game.

As stated earlier, more than one character is sympathetic to the viewer.  The narrative unfolds, as well, into a decent one; mixed with suitable twists and turns that get enough ""make sense, but I didn't see it coming"". The shifts in narrative 3/4 of the way in adds whole new dimensions to the story without falling to far outside of believability.  As well, the undercurrent of filmic commentary can't be ignored; whether it's the monsterfication of vilified figures, or the American attribution of sadistic acts to foreign cultures which may in fact have roots in American and British literature in films (SPOILER: listen for one reference made to blade handed beasts.  Freddy Krueger?  Edward Scissor Hands?  Wolverine?)

In all, this is a stand out three and halfer, but not enough weight to round up.  Still, for eighty minutes, this is nothing if not a good time killer and a definite nominee for ""cult-classic"".",1392940800,2,2696,4.647679324894515
5720777,4,B00CERJINC,"Just to give you an Idea of my taste in movies goes from b-horror (Trolls 2) all the way to artistic (The Fall). As for us all it really depends the mood we're in.

So this movie takes place during WWII and is filmed as found footage. Now I hate found footage films, but this one does it nicely where it doesn't bother me as much. Thank good they had 1080p cameras back then to film the war. The quality of the blue-ray is great as well as the sound. Movie special features are Making Of, Creature Spots, and Trailer. So the creature spots are just the points played back where they are in the movie.

What makes this movie worth buying? Alright this is the first movie in a long while that brings back horror monsters as they should always be seen.with make-up, latex, and good old fashion creativity. I'm against bad CGI and this movie has none because there is no CGI. The creatures are great when they make an appearance and well presented.

The film drags until you get inside Franks place then the approach is almost original ( the first one  shaky and screaming all over ) Texas Chainsaw style.  It is okay and Ill watch again now and then, but Im sad because this could have been so much more even on a low budget.  GOOD imaginations were used in the creature designs  wish wed had more time with them and more interaction so we could really see them all at full range.  On the upside  a good little morbid and macabre film that gnaws at your nerves as it goes along.  So strongly suggest you do at least rent it and check it out but I'd wait for the price to drop off before making it a purchase.",1391385600,,810,4.0125
5720779,4,B00CERJINC,"AhhNazis and zombies.  They seem to go together like beer and pretzels and its been a theme of numerous horror films over the years.  But I dare say none of them can approach Frankensteins Army for sheer twisted monster creations.

A Russian reconnaissance unit is behind German lines in the waning days of World War II.  Among the Russian soldiers is Dmitri, an aspiring filmmaker who is recording the vents with his handheld camera.  They pick up a distress call from another Russian unit and move onward to locate and aid them.  They come upon a small hamlet filled with terrified residents.

As the soldiers search a seemingly abandoned factory, they encounter a strange creature who is part man and part metal with odd weapons grafted on to its body.  The creature kills the units leader before it is gunned down by the other soldiers.  As they delve deeper and deeper into the factory they are attacked by ever more bizarre monstrosities that they learn have been created by a crazed scientist, Viktor Frankenstein.  Their search to rescue their comrades now becomes a fight for their own lives!

I generally detest found-footage films and there is no reason at all for Director Richard Raaphorst to take this avenue as it adds nothing to the story.  That said at least he makes it less obtrusive than other found-footage films and their less of the jittery camera work than were used to seeing.

The cast is ok and story pedestrian but the true stars of the film are those warped creatures created by the special and visual FX teams, and Raaphorst himself who designed the creatureshuman bodies who have sickles, drills, spikes, and even airplane propellers attached to their bodies where their arms, hands, or heads should be.  One shambles about on four stilted legs like a deranged spider.  For those who have played the BioShock videogames the monsters are somewhat similar to those steam-punk themed horrors.

Frankensteins Army is exceedingly gory as the factory has an assembly line of bodies in various states of missing limbs and heads, just ready to be manufactured for the madmans use.  This is a good ol fashioned gore fest!",1391299200,2,2143,4.843406593406593

5720798,3,B00CERJINC,"In spite of its intriguing title, Dutch director Richard Raaphorsts thriller Frankenstein's Army has nothing to do with Mary Shelleys classic novel. Combining several genre conventions into one film (just like Iron Sky and Dead Snow), Frankensteins Army is about a band of Russian soldiers during WWII, who stumbles upon a secret facility operated by a deranged scientist (delightfully over-the-top Karel Roden) conducting strange experiments.

The best part of the film is the design of the weird creatures (zombots) the doctor has created. Designed by the director himself, these creatures (made up of body parts and weapons) have a very unique look, for which alone the film is worth seeing.

Unfortunately, the rest of the film is rather disappointing. Frankensteins Army belongs to the overcrowded found-footage genre, which means drawn-out dialogue that is not particularly interesting, and shaky camera that inevitably lessens the impact of these visually attractive war creatures/machines. The story that does not know where it wants to go does not help.

Often very gory to the point of being humorous, Richard Raaphorst Frankenstein's Army will be remembered among avid moviegoers as a cult classic.",1386979200,,1209,5.454545454545454

5720800,2,B00CERJINC,"The mad doctor during WWII creating mutants half human half machine could have been an interesting premise but it is a hot mess.  The camera is jerky and swirls around like most fake documentaries and I find this annoying.  In this particular case it was difficult to take in the monsterous creations since the camera never allowed the viewer to focus on it.  Was the creature that badly put together?  From what I did see some of the creatures had a more interesting design than others. The creations were more rudimentary than steampunk inspired.
The accents of the soldiers make it difficult to understand some of the dialogue.  Some of the dying solders mumble dialogue which is also difficult to understand.  I almost wanted to see if subtitles were available but figured since they were dying it probably didn't add much to the movie.
The acting was ok but the pacing was pretty slow.  It seemed the soldiers wandered around for a while before anything moderately exciting happened.  The ""betrayal"" wasn't exactly a shocker and the ending was pretty predictable and laughable.  I could have done without the social commentary about how communism, capitalism, socialism and ect.. are bad.  I don't necessarily watch horror movies for a ""message"".
What gore effects were in the movie was mostly blood splatter by gunshots.  The doctor cuts a brain in half and it looks rather fake.

5720803,4,B00CERJINC,"Very fun film.  I was caught off guard by some of the practical effects and creature designs, just because it's been so long since I've seen them in a newer film!

The only real issue I had with this movie is the characters; none of them are particularly likable or memorable even though they're very well acted.  Except for good ol Dr. Frankenstein of course, who is gloriously over-the-top and an evil madman, like he should be.  His creations of course steal the show; they're not particularly scary, but they are menacing and have very sharp things attached to them and they're quite imaginative too, sometimes in ridiculous ways.

The most underrated aspect of this movie is how it establishes a dreary atmosphere from the start and really uses the environs as a character in itself.  This makes the fact the filmmakers chose practical effects over CGI and really got creative with the creature designs even better.  I really can't recommend watching this movie enough.

Also, for more Frankenstein ""building creatures to take over the world"" goodness, I recommend reading Dean Koontz's Frankenstein.",1384560000,3,1105,5.0

5720805,5,B00CERJINC,"Sometimes a movie makes good on every promise made in its trailer.  Its not often, once in a blue moon, but when it happens, its a grand thing.  One such promise was in the trailer for Richard Raaphorsts FRANKENSTEINS ARMY, the trailer for which looked like deleted scenes from Marilyn Mansons The Beautiful People video.  I knew when I saw the DVD I had to get it.  That was $15 well spent.

The story centers on a squad of Russian soldiers near the end of WWII as they're ordered to help fellow squad at an abandoned building not far from their location.  But when they get there, they find no squad, no people, just a pile of burned nuns.  When they get inside the building, they find they should have stayed outside.

First its a sexless creature lying naked on the floor, wires and tubes coming from its head.  Once the generator is brought to life, the creature awakes and immediately disembowels the CO, leaving dissension in the ranks when the next highest ranking officer is challenged by a lower rank because he hasn't been with the squad long enough to lead them.

If theyd been paying better attention to their surroundings, they may have realized arguing amongst themselves wasn't the best use of their time.

They set off looking for someone, anyone, who can answer their questions.  They find only one old man who claims he just takes care of the animals, they want the Doctor.  He can lead them to him.  On the way, through a labyrinth of tunnels under the building, the old man vanishes, but what they find in his place is an army of monsters, dead soldiers reanimated and made into ungodly creatures with knives for hands.  One has an airplane propeller where his head should be.  Anothers legs have been replaced with huge iron insect-like legs, with a drill extending from the front of his face.

A bloodbath ensues, picking off soldier after soldier until finally one of them comes face to face with the Doctor.

FRANKENSTEINS ARMY is a work of design brilliance, a mess of godawful creatures with deadly and terrifying physical attributes all in the service of one master.  Karel Roden (HELLBOY, THE ABANDONED) does an excellent job as the Doctor, as he does in everything Ive ever seen him in.  This guy needs to be a bigger hit in Hollywood; I would flock to his next movie a lot faster than I would anything from Cruise or Smith.  In fact, he was one of the main selling points for me in buying this movie as opposed to waiting to see if it showed up on Netflix.

The story is told through the POV of one of the soldiers who has been sent on the mission with the intention of recording everything that happens in the field, documenting the mission for Mother Russia.  But it rarely ever feels like a found footage movie.  The point of view is handled well and the camera doesnt miss a single detail.

This movie was insane and Im so glad I own it and can watch it again and again, which I definitely plan to do.

The script provides enough character beats for everyone to get a bit of their personality through, helping us identify with them as they're picked off by the zombots.  And the zombots themselves are all unique enough in their design we can tell them apart, and ghastly enough the real gorehounds will not be left wanting.

The effects in this movie are top notch superb and definitely a sight to behold.  The story could have sucked and the effects alone could have won over any horror fan.  Honestly, I cant say enough good about FRANKENSTEINS ARMY other than it eventually ended, which I wasn't ready for.  I wanted at least another hour of gore and monsters.  It was finally so good to see a movie that didn't skimp on the visuals, that went for honest physical effects in place of terrible CGI, and that offered a story with the potential for so many more terrible creatures.  It was a buffet of beasts and I wanted to pile every one of them onto my plate then go back for more.

I've watched hundreds of horror films. Believe me, i have seen so many; Indie, 80's, The French films (which have a knack for disturbing me so after ""Inside"" i said no more, LOL) and 'some' Hollywood flicks. I have an affinity for the 70's where heavy atmosphere and suspense was a staple of that era in horror movies, e.g; ""Magic"", ""Death dream"" and ""Black Christmas"".  You see, Im not the teenager i once was, growing up in the 80's, so i cant handle aimless, plotless brutality and graphic violence any more, although the 80's stuff had suspense and plot as well as gore. Yes I might be a bit weak nowadays as far as what i can stomach and enjoy, thats why i wouldn't watch the Human Centipede or even a film like Martyrs, even if the latter is said to be very good. Im not judging these films I just get PTS very easily, BUT, this was not the case for this flick, the savage happenings here, served a purpose, which is to draw you into this insane world..
Frankensteins Army was one of those brilliant nightmares that kept my heart beating hard beneath my ribcage as if i had just smoked a joint of ""too-powerful weed"" all to myself in one sitting.
The monsters were nightmares. Creeping, clanking, crushing metal nightmares.. Jesus.  The camera view of the film was key, it definitely puts you into that chaos, too damned real. The violence was there, but aside from mine-carts and rooms of thousands of body parts, it wasn't so graphic that it became overwhelming. It was those horrific images of Frankenstein's monsters, experiments and utterly bizarre and intimidating creations that stay with you, long after the film ends.
Well acted, well filmed, brilliant creatures and effects, and a claustrophobic, maze-crazed thrill ride that had me laying on my couch talking to myself for 10 minutes saying ""WTF..???""
Who really cares if it was unrealistic that they had a ""hi-def"" camera in the 1940's.. Is that really a major issue for people in some cases?  After 15 minutes i couldn't have cared what kind of camera the Russian soldier held..
Frankensteins Army was a snowball turning into a huge ice boulder, that never stopped. What a superb effort this was. Once again I am deeply traumatized. Damn it. I gotta watch Abbot and Costello or something just to relax.

5720830,5,B00CERJINC,"I would like to start this review by saying ""NO CGI AND ITS ABOUT TIME!!!"". Well, I can finally write a positive review of a film that isn't 20 years old. I have been following the directors work since I seen his teaser trailers for ""Worst Case Scenario"". I also don't understand how there can be negative reviews of this film, people are insane sometimes. We live in a world that is up to its eye balls in LAZY CGI EFFECTS AND NO HEART. This film delivers the goods. Check out the Pros and Cons.

Pros
+No CGI
+Great Storyline
+The Found Footage wasn't shot terrible like Blair Witch Project, it works for his film!
+Very Gory
+Amazing Monsters!
+Great acting from the Mad Doctor
+One of the best horror films I have ever seen. Period.

Cons
-Dont really have any, and thats no BS.

In a nutshell, Frankenstein's Army is a fun film. Its a throwback to old School horror when they put HEART into their work. Its a film I will watch again and again years from now. I look forward to Richard Raaphorst (Director) future projects. Nice Job sir, and Thank you.",1379116800,15,1056,4.4051282051282055
5720831,5,B00CERJINC,This movie lived up to be exactly as i hoped. The story line was great and wasn't what i anticipated but kept my interest.,1379030400,,122,4.125
5720832,5,B00CERJINC,"I've been a horror movie fanatic since the age of ten, so that's 45 years that I've watched anything horror related and I have to say Frankenstein's Army was great fun to watch. I thought the actors did a fine job, the sets were authentic looking and all the monsters were really interesting to look at. There are so many poorly made horror films that I really appreciate it when money is spent to be so creative and different. To any and all naysayers of this film I wonder just what they think a horror film should be? This was the real deal, fun, scary and well made.",1379030400,,570,4.287037037037037
5720833,4,B00CERJINC,"The premise: Near the end of World War II, a group of Russian soldiers encounter a secret Nazi lab where a mad scientist is using Dr. Victor Frankenstein's journal to create monstrous human-mechanical abominations to fight for Germany. This idea has TONS of potential for horror awesomeness and thankfully the filmmakers make the most of it!

It's shot as a ""found footage"" film, though it's not nearly as distracting as most of its brethren. It works well with the story too, even more so after a nifty little twist. The WWII vibe is right-on and the actors all do a great job considering the material.

The showstopper here (and the main reason to watch) is the plethora of horrific yet inventive monsters. They look like something pulled straight out of Wolfenstein, Silent Hill or Bioshock, with their twisted designs and wild make-up. Everyone knows I'm a huge advocate of practical effects over CGI and this film is a prime example of how to do it properly. Each creature is more terrifying than the last and they just keep on coming...just when you think they can't get any crazier, a new nightmare emerges to scare the crap out of you thanks to solid pacing and editing. The gore is also impressive and like the monsters, gets increasingly more lurid as the film wears on.

There's not much else to say. If you're a fan of the genre or a gorehound, do not miss this blood-soaked horror extravaganza!",1379030400,,1407,4.711382113821138

5720835,1,B00CERJINC,"WATCH OUT, BOREDOM MIGHT KILL YOU BEFORE FRANKENSTEIN'S ARMY DOES. It's not Universal or Hammer nonetheless it's better than most Frankenstein inspired stories. The hand held documentary camera style filmmaking was annoying and detracted from the story. I had certain expectations of violence and gore which are mild in this film. This should have been a gore fest. I like the story over all. Some of the creatures are interesting but most remind me of Power Rangers Monsters. I enjoyed some of the sequences running in corridors with those dreadful things lurking about. It reminds me of chasing people through a haunted attraction. I would watch a prequel or sequel to this film if there is no hand held footage. Never use red paint for fake blood. I think the actor's did good  jobs, considering they must have been laughing at how stupid the Monsters looked.",1378857600,2,862,4.904109589041096
5720836,5,B00CERJINC,"Some days I hate critics, especially horror critics. It's a horror movie and it's not real to begin with. With that said Frankenstein's Army is  awesome and I hope for a sequel. My only complaint is with so many movies it that so many writers do not write with the intention that the movie might be a success. I really kind of wanted to see the Russians come in with a solid attack and to have the Frankenstein monster show up and smash the hell out of everything. Other than that this movie is worth checking out!",1378771200,2,514,4.298969072164948
5720837,1,B00CERJINC,"Everyone here is saying the exact same thing ""GOOD OLD FASHIONED SPECIAL FX LIKE THEY USED TO MAKE! SWOON!"" Now, I'm a big fan of the 'real deal' effects like what was chef'd up by the legendary Tom Savini, etc. but this movie is far, FAR from that. This is equitable to an exceptionally bad episode of Power Rangers... but without any of the silly novelty. Frankenstein's Army you'd hope would at least be as bad as its name to laugh it, unfortunately this movie takes itself very seriously-- when what it should have is a disclaimer on the box warning the viewer they may form grooves in the back of their eyelids from how much eye-rolling they are about to do for the next torturous 90 minutes. The violence is tame as hell, the monsters flop around on screen almost 90% of the time which takes away any semblance of tension, and worst of all (I know everyone complains about this) it's a GODDAMN found footage film... AGAIN. So how did these Russian soldiers have HD cameras in 1940s? If you thought any of the recent offerings (Chernobyl Diaries) were absolutely horrid, well you ain't seen nothin' yet.

Please for the love of horror do not support this steaming pile. I try to be very liberal in encouraging anything related to the genre, something I love above most things, but this is just disgraceful. God bless the internet for letting us watch these things before we buy them nowadays. This isn't even worth the electricity to run a television on to watch, let alone buy the damn thing itself.",1378598400,8,1505,4.574074074074074

5720839,5,B00CERJINC,Loved this flick. Yet again another found footage movie but it takes place during WW2 with a bunch of Russians trying to find and take out some germans then some crazy stuff starts to happen. The creature effects in this I think are great and just so inventive and over the top. One parts Nazi zombie movies with crazy silent hill lookin monsters. Just preordered this Blu-ray and im sure its gonna look great and with a price of around $13 this is a steal and every horror movie fan should have this in their collection.,1377475200,,521,4.4375
5720840,4,B00CERJINC,I love monster movies so went into this feeling excited. It was a lot of fun . Not really scary but had moments that jolted and the monster creations were just fantastic. The director captured the insanity of this well insane situation and did a great job. Well done.,1377388800,7,267,4.469387755102041
5720841,2,B00CERJINC,"This movie could have been a masterpiece.  Although the premise isn't exactly original, the way the director executed the film is.  If I was rating the film on special effects alone, it would easily get 4-stars.  I love that there is no CGI.  I absolutely loath CGI and I would rather see well designed costumes and make-up like this rather than CGI (i.e, Silent Hill: Revelations where the CGI ruined the entire movie.)

The problem here is the plot.  I am fine with the ""found film"" angle but I think it detracts from the movie's potential.  Either way, this is a personal preferences and it isn't really where the movie stumbles.  The main problem is that the soldiers are extremely unlikable and the monsters have no personality, humanity or story behind them.  They are just there to look ugly.  How could this have been different?  Take the French film 'Martyrs'.  The movie is so effective on a psychological level because you really feel for the characters and are horrified by what is happening to them.  A few simple plot reworks would've salvaged this film:

1.) Instead of making the 'creatures' horrible monsters, why not make them prisoners of war or another group of soldiers being experimented on.  The Dr. is somehow keeping these poor people alive while mutilating them in horrible ways. They are not evil monsters but suffering terribly.  This would add some humanity to their background and make you feel that uneasiness in the pit of your stomach missing from this film.

2.) Make the soldiers likable. Have a bad apple or two if needed but for the most part make them people you root for.  In line with my above suggestion, why not develop the bonds between the soldiers in the film's first and second act, only to have one of them taken by Dr.  In the film's 3rd Act they could run into their friend again, this time horribly mutilated and deformed.  That would be a horrible and emotional confrontation.

Overall, this film isn't bad, but it lacks humanity and it's hard to really rate a movie above 2-stars when it leaves no emotional impact whatsoever.  It is worth a rent, and right now the Blu-Ray is on sale for $10 and it is worth the $10, but I guess I'm disappointed that if fell so short of what I saw its' true potential to be.",1377302400,6,2261,4.6
5720842,4,B00CERJINC,"There's not much to the story--WW2 Soviet soldiers find church where Nazi mad scientist has been creating his own army with machine parts and bodies from the cemetery--but it's fun to watch as the soldiers fight their way through the church in search of the mad scientist.  Film relies on the found-footage technique, which works well overall because it enables the viewer to see from the soldiers' point of view.  The creature effects are so good, however, that at times, I wished the movie used a more traditional approach with an objective point of view, so I could have gotten a better look at the creatures.  On the other hand, it's probably better that the movie left me wanting more rather than showing the creatures so much that I started to notice flaws in the effects.  Overall, a very entertaining horror movie that should appeal to any horror fan who likes creature features and mad scientists.",1376438400,6,906,4.788461538461538
5720843,5,B00CERJINC,"R.E.C. 2 meets Silent Hill and gets steampunk splashed all over it and topped off with a hint of The Blair Witch Project here in Frankenstein's Army.

I went in expected cheap thrills, plotless-ness, gunfights and essentially monster-movie type massacres and gore.

I was pleasantly surprised. I was on the edge of my seat, it has a decent plot, guns and explosions weren't overused, and it has all the elements, everything you'd expect, of a good movie.

The costuming and cinematography (for a found-footage film) is better than all B movies I've seen. However, it was gorier than I expected.

Overall, definitely watch it if you enjoyed R.E.C. 2 and other found footage films. Also, gore outweighs scary and suspense in this. So if you get scared easily, that's okay, just make sure you can stomach simulated dismemberment.",1376092800,,826,4.963768115942029

5720845,4,B00CERJINC,"3.5 stars really.

Pros: The movie has the feel of playing an ID game like Quake mixed with Castle Frankenstein.  The first person shooter is there, but in the form of a camera instead of a gun.  The special Effects are great too as they're not CGI.  Production value is high as there's a lot of detail to look at in the settings.

Cons: Shaky camera work.

As for the lack of plot complaints, what did these reviewers expect?  The plot is there, it's just not significant and doesn't need to be for a B movie.  There's enough plot and dialogue to move the story, such as it is, along.  It's about the makeup effects, gore, and set details.  If you want great dialogue, watch Pulp Fiction.  You're looking in the wrong place for any Academy Awards.",1375747200,2,748,4.386861313868613
5720846,2,B00CERJINC,"I really wanted to like this movie!  The trailer portrayed a great Nazi + Frankenstein's monsters throw down;  what a wonderful (if not particularly original) idea!  But, man!, what a mess this movie is.  The action takes forever to get going, the characters are totally unlovable and just do a lot of shouting at each other, the story is very confusing, and the rational for the ""found footage"" gag (as a ""documentary tool"") becomes ever more ridiculous as the intreprid filmer continues to roll even during all the chases and fighting.  Viktor F. seemed like he could be an interesting character but he doesn't hit the screen until the last 15 or 20 minutes of the film.  The monsters are generally pretty good (if occassionly silly) -- hey, any steampunk undead looks great in a traditional German stahlhelm and swastica armband.  So much missed potential.

5720847,5,B00CERJINC,"Frankenstein's Army is simply crazy. I adore the creative creature designs in a genre overrun by CGI.

I can see how certain movie snobs would scorn it as being too off the wall, but I also believe that that is part of its charm.

These guys really put their heart and soul into the production, and IT SHOWS! You can't find that kind of determination and love in films very often anymore, and it's a shame.

5720851,4,B00CERJINC,"The movie is slim on plot, so if you're looking for a movie with the plot depth of ""The Silence of The Lambs"" you'll be sorely disappointed.

The screenwriters are pretty lazy, never having done any research into WW2 (Russian soldiers were Atheists and NEVER would say 'Jesus Christ' in response to anything; most soldier actions & dialogue are cliche).

The movie suffers from failing to achieve one of the cardinal rules of horror films:  Frankenstein's Army is never, ever scary.  But it is interesting.

The movie itself is brought to you by Richard Raaphorst, a filmmaker who gained a lot of notice on YouTube with his two trailers for the now-defunct zombie movie ""Worst Case Scenario,"" and much like those trailers (CHECK THEM OUT!!!), the monsters are the stars of this flick.  Once the creatures appear - and there are tons of old-school non-CGI creatures in Frankenstein's Army - this is as close to a live-action version of the Quake 2 video game as I've ever seen.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and did so by never taking it too seriously.  I watched it 4 times over the weekend during the 48 hour rental through Vudu and highly recommend it.  It's a fun party flick!",1375056000,4,1175,4.692682926829268
5720852,3,B00CERJINC,"I have been waiting for this film a number of years.  It is the director's first directorial debut, and the director was involved with the semi-well known Worst Case Scenario trailers, a similar project that was ultimately dropped though the similarities in design are clear between these two films.  Overall the film is interesting and enjoyable.  I never thought the acting was dreadful in any particular way but wasn't excellent either.  An exception was Roden (Frankenstein) who was very enjoyable to watch and played the mad scientist proud of his work well.  The monster designs were generally unique thought a few seemed repetitive.  The primary problem with the film was a meandering buildup to the later stages featuring Roden, which is a common complaint about the film.  Another primary flaw was the handheld cam style.  The purpose of the handheld cam was explained in the film, and had some interesting moments but also failed to allow us to see the monsters fully and resulted in the obnoxious running seen in other handheld cam films.  An interview with the director covered his choice to use this filming method indicating that it contributed to the plot but also resulted in some problems when trying to film the monsters, an opinion I agree with.  The effects are all practical and enjoyable to watch, including the bizarre creatures seen throughout the film.  Individuals complaining of poor effects confuse me as the effects are detailed and well designed showing no major flaws.  Perhaps people are too used to CGI.  Anyway, enjoyable film worth a watch.",1374969600,4,1575,5.0115384615384615
5720853,2,B00CERJINC,"In Frankenstein's Army, a group of Russian soldiers think they're going to rescue some comrades, only to find out their mission is much more sinister, and they're all disposable. The beginning of the movie is a bit slow, but I suppose it builds a little characterization. These are not nice guys - they basically rape and pillage their way through German villages to reach their goal. As they approach their destination, they encounter odd things - dead bodies with mechanical parts attached, a pile o' dead nuns, etc. Finally we're in the heart of the action, and the Russians run into what are supposed to be horrific creations - men combined with various bits of machinery, some of which will make you burst out laughing rather than gasping in horror, like the one with the airplane-propeller head. There are a couple of Star Wars-type creatures and one that reminds me quite a bit of the Landstriders in The Dark Crystal. Anyhow, eventually we get to the mad scientist, and he was pretty well acted, a real mean dude. The film is told through a handheld camera, and fortunately for us, the good doctor wants his story told, so he makes sure the camera is rolling while he swaps out brains and explains his diabolical plans. One disappointment is that the worst bully in the Russian group is jabbed with a needle, but then nothing gets done to him--I was sort of hoping he'd get his comeuppance. Anyhow, the pacing is pretty frantic toward the end as the monsters groan and flail about ineffectually and the Russians carpet bomb the installation. I give it points for fun, if silly, monsters, and for the mad doctor's performance, and points off for lack of plot and character development. Worth a watch once the rental price comes down.",1374883200,3,1740,4.7269736842105265

First off, there are so many Hollywood disappointments, this gets 3 stars for having an original concept and doing an OK job on execution. As a complainer mentioned, there is a handheld camera perspective for a lot of the movie which is irritating but not fatal to the movie.  The monsters are interesting.  This is a fun diversion and in no way the unsalvageable dog that some have said.  I have watched some first run big budget supernatural movie dogs in the theater recently and I can say that this is a pretty decent value for your viewing dollar.
