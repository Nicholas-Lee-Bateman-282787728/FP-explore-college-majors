A Simple Promise really surprised me. I'd heard it was kind of a chick flick but I wanted to see it anyway because my friend is in it. I don't often get to say that about a movie. Based on this one, I hope to be able to say it more often.",1376697600,,471,3.7676767676767677

If you want to see what a high school film class project looks like - this is the movie for you.

Members of the film crew weren't actually knocking over the scenery or stumbling into the shots during filming, but it would not have made the movie any worse if they had.",1337817600,,362,4.373134328358209

--Marcus Savage, played by Wallace Demarria is a struggling, brilliant artist (painter) whose work portrays his belief that nothing happens by accident. He meets Madison Lane, played by Layla Kayleigh who is a beautiful and talented but yet undiscovered songstress. Desperately seeking success, they both must face hard truths and contend with sacrifice on their individual paths to fame. Through their journey one of them makes an extremely difficult decision based on pure love that transforms their lives in ways neither imagined.--

The story of this movie was very good and with better actors it could have been great; that is the only reason I gave it three stars.

I felt embarrassed for Wallace Demarria who played the lead male role of Marcus; he was one of the very few decent actors in this movie and I honestly don't know how he got through some of those scenes.  The actor who played his best friend was pretty good also.  I've seen many low budget films that were very well acted, so that cannot be used as an excuse for this movie.

I also have to comment on the accent/speech of the lead female role, Madison, played by Layla Kayleigh.  She was supposed to be from London, and the actress actually was born in London, with a father of African and European descent and a mother of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean descent.  So considering that, it doesn't make sense that she seemed to struggle throughout the movie with her speech in general; it sounded almost as if she had a speech impediment.  She had many different accents in different parts of the film ranging from British to what sounded to me like a New York(Queens) accent.  I've never seen her in a film before so maybe that is the way she normally speaks, I don't know, but it was very distracting in the movie.  She also needs lessons in lip-syncing.  While performing she buried her face in the microphone so you couldn't see her mouth; it looked really strange (singer Angel DeLuna did the songs).

By far the worst acting job was done by Madison's mother who was played by Laura Squier.  I actually cringed during her scenes; luckily there were only a few.  My husband left the room sometime in the first 15 minutes; that's all he could take.  I on the other hand will sit through ANY movie, no matter how bad it is.

Again, the story itself is really good, and very touching.  If you are tolerant of bad acting I would recommend this movie for the story alone.",1237248000,,2575,4.597374179431072
