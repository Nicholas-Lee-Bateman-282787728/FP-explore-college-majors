215686,5,6300182738,"I loved this film from beginning to end for so many reasons.  One is the superb performances by Sissy Spacek and Jack Lemmon.  2. The story is so emotion provoking, maddening, saddening, and true. 3. Gravas' direction is  great and he perfectly captures the atmosphere of Chile after the fascist  Pinochet coup (backed by the USA). 4. The theme music by Vangelis is great  atmospheric haunting very appropriate background.  5. Anyone who doesn't  know much about the effects of US foreign policy must see this film to  learn the truth.",956534400,3,535,4.866666666666666
215687,4,6300182738,"Costa-Gravas first American film carries his stamp, bit it is a little more manipulative than he's used to. The film works better because of the powerful performances by Jack Lemmon and Sissy Spacek. A great  oscar-winning screenplay (co-scripted by Costa-Gravas) and a powerful true  story lift the emotional impact. Jack Lemmon really shines as the searching  father, he plays an a-typical role for him, a man who's quietly struggling  with his inner feelings, and Sissy Spacek is great as always as the wife of  Charles. Great Movie. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!",952905600,5,580,4.877551020408164

The performances of Jack Lemmon and Sissy Spacek were amazing and the interaction of the two was so very interesting.

215733,5,6300182738,"This was a great film and I was kind of shocked when I watched last night. First I had a  doubt since <Z> the movie Costa Gavras made back in his country was kind of boring perhaps because that was when I was very young when I watched. But this one was not. It was gripping and sad, perhaps scary to death as well. It's not because this is a horror movie. It's a political thriller I might say.
Sissy Spacek' husbans and her herself were living in Chile and one day Sissy's husband just dissapeared all of a sudden. His father comes from America to find him as well. Team up with his daughter in law, they try to find him desperately only to figure out that he is nowhere.

Throughout the film, Vangelis' great music effects the mood so much. There are actually two different kinds of music he made. 1. Very soft and tender keyboard sound that sustains and touches the charactors' emotions 2. Showing the charactor's tensed and nervous mind by using futuristic sound also using keyboard sound just like one of the BLADE RUNNER music that he also worked for.
It is a great shame that the dvd movie was mono that I can only hear mono.

Jack Lemmon was always a great actor. He is one of the few actor who really acts with his heart. Mostely he worked as a comedian but a few works he've done were all so succesful such as <Days of Wine and Roses><Glengarry Glenross ><The China Syndrome> he was oscar worth actor in them all.
In this movie, he was acting this heart chilling performance as well. Whenever he delivers each lines, he just chew and chew before he actually says it.

It is always delightful to see Sissy Spacek again. I only remember her from <Carrie> although I have liked all of her movies. She is just getting better nad better each time I see her new movies. I mean not new new but whenever I open new dvds that I own already.

This movie is so great because of the music, performance, directing, script and phase. All together memorable.
If only I can watch this movie again with stereo sound, I can pay anything.",1460246400,2,2029,4.357142857142857

215765,5,6300182738,"This Academy Award winner is a political thriller based on the true story of Charles Horman (John Shea) who was in Chile in 1973 with his wife (Sissy Spacek) when the CIA helped General Augusto Pinochet overthrew the democratically elected government of Socialist President Salvador Allende. The story of the young couple caught up in the bloody military coup and the search by Charlie's father Ed Horman (played by Jack Lemmon) for his missing son, staged by Oscar winning director and co-writer Costa-Gavras, are intense, emotional, authentic, and unforgettable. This is one of the great American political thrillers and directed by a master of the genre. The fact that it was produced by Universal Pictures, a major studio, is a reminder of braver times in Hollywood when such important stories could be told.",1434412800,3,812,5.112781954887218

215768,5,6300182738,"You do not need to support Allende's ideas or so called leftist governments in order to like this movie. It happened, it was brutal, and this movie shows this is dramatic ways that are enjoyable yet crude enough to represent the reality of such regimes.

If not for the history, get it for the story.

SPOILER follows.

I was particularly impressed with how well Jack Lemmon portrays a father who is initially oblivious to the involvement of his own country, only to find himself in a dissonant state of mind when he finds out the deep extent of that involvement, and, particularly, how he wouldn't be helped at all when he needed it the most, after the mess was already done and obvious.

You think of Charles Horman as the naive, but the story shows how governments can work in detriment of the citizen, even past the degree where it does not need to (or at least shouldn't be allowed to at all), no matter how bigger interests (lawful or unlawful) are involved, as the events at the very end of the movie show (when he just wants his son his body, that is).

Finally, we see a father, living comfortably with his beliefs, his political prejudices (as in judgments and ideas formed by adopted ideology), leave the simple and childish beliefs behind to understandin the hard waythe pragmatism of the interests involved in big events such as those surrounding the Operation Condor. In short, that the world does not work in easy to digest dichotomies of black and white, good and evil, which is something so many people seem to miss when talking about politics and world diplomacy, despite it being a fairly obvious conclusion.",1431734400,,1627,4.674825174825175

Jack Lemmon has to deal with the maddening runaround of the American and native government's bureaucracies.  At first, he doesn't even like his daughter-in-law, Sissy Spacek.  Lemmon's transformation in this film is what great cinema is about.",1430611200,2,442,5.455882352941177
215800,5,6300182738,"Classic political thriller, all based on real events: yet another democratically elected government and sovereign nation overthrown by the CIA. The murder (oh, excuse me, ""suicide"") of Salvador Allende was aided/funded and abetted by the CIA thugs because, as the personification of evil (at least one of them still manipulating from the shadows), Henry Kissinger, explained, ""we can't just sit back because the Chilean people voted the wrong way"".

Some years back, the then-head of the NED (National Endowment for Democracy) bragged, ""We're doing overtly in these countries what the CIA did covertly twenty-five years ago"". Of course, when showering of millions of our tax dollars on extremist, violent groups in a targeted, democratic nation, planting fake stories of oppression in opposition media, etc. against the government (eg. in Venezuela, Bolivia, et al) doesn't do the trick, the CIA thugs still take over. It's an infuriating broken record, and this movie tells the story of one of the early ones. What the CIA and State Dept. did to Chile was what got me involved in Latin American history and politics. I already knew the sordid story of Washington's turning a democratic, socialist state into a bloody hellhole, ruled with an iron fist by the fascist military dictator, Augusto Pinochet, and this movie did a good job of telling the story. If anything, it's pretty mild in comparison to the real events.

It is suspenseful & since it is based on a true story, students are captivated.  The main character, Ed Horman (Jack Lemmon), is the father of Charles Horman, a journalist who, according to the Chilean government, asks too many questions and probes a little too aggressively into ""matters that don't concern him.""  It is an intense film, so if showing it in a classroom, I recommend high level high-school juniors or seniors.  It would also be appropriate for a high level history class.  South America still tends to take a back seat to European or Asian history.  This is a shame, since we share a hemisphere with these countries.

There is nothing to criticise about this movie as it surely [one of]the finest of its genre. Its a travesty, and a reflection on the US political scene when it came out, that it only received 1 oscar. Everything about the film is deserving of an oscar. Soundtrack/editing/screenplay/casting/ EVERYTHING!!!Some of the scenes are so powerful that unless you were there[or had been there], you can only begin to imagine what it was actually like! The detail astounds me everytime I see it, and Costa-Gavras really surpassed himself with his attention to detail to all the little things, like the signs in the hospital where Jack Lemmon goes looking for Charlie's body, the bus destination signs etc.etc.etc. I also liked the depiction of certain staff of some of the embassies as being a bunch of arrogant, overpaid, pencil-pushing 'diplomats'......Certain phrases have stuck in my mind since the first time I saw it..E.G. 'They shoot you just for being left-handed...'I'm left-handed, by the way and remember it being remarked  upon on  all over Latin America , as it probably is still to this day. I also recommend Thomas Hauser's book, either in its original title 'The Execution of Charles Horman' or later simply 'Missing' with its brilliant cover, not an easy find but well worth the search.

I had never heard of Charles Horman prior to seeing the movie and I am glad I had not.  It was watching the story unfold and reach its ultimate conclusion that provided the impact at the end, beyond the end really, when a delayed reaction left me sitting there thinking OMG.

215999,4,6300182738,"""Missing"" is the first American film by esteemed Director Costa Gavras, who makes the most of his talented Cast and an excellent screenplay. It seems that Charles Horman (John Shea), a Liberal Journalist covering a Coup de Etat in an unnamed South American country, has been kidnapped and his naive wife Beth (Sissy Spacek) is getting nowhere with the American Embassy. She enlists the help of her Father-In-Law Ed (Jack Lemmon), a Bible-thumping East Coast Conservative, who seems to think that his son's political views are to blame for his disappearance. As Ed and Beth make their way around the war-torn City, Ed becomes increasingly aware that the Americans are lying and that his Son was a good guy after all. As the film unfolds, we also meet some of the Horman's friends, notably Melanie Mayron as a photographer and Joe Regelbutto as a fellow Writer, who meets a similar fate as Charles Horman. Both Lemmon and Spacek have great parts, but it's Lemmon who is the most affecting. As he evolves from a tough, proud Patriot into a broken man mourning the Son he never knew, Lemmon's seamless performance is one of the best of his career. Spacek underacts beatifully - her muted expressions convey more emotion than if she went over the top with screaming hysterics. Logistically, however, there are some issues. The film opens with a title card stating that this is a true story, but ends with a US State Department message denying all the events in the film. The story is supposed to take place in Chile, but it was filmed rather obviously in Mexico City. The Airport scenes take place openly in the Mexico City Airport, there are several ""plugs"" for Braniff Airlines, and the Cast of extras are clearly Mexican and not Chilean - even a casual observer can tell the difference. But these flaws only slightly detract from a powerful, controversial film.",1337990400,,1859,4.8125

216001,5,6300182738,"One of the great films of the 1980s and one of the greatest political thrillers of all time, shot through with a palpable sense of menace and at times almost unbearable tension. Costa-Gavras takes the true story of the disappearance and murder of an American journalist, Charlie Horman, and uses it to illustrate the wider story of the United States backed overthrow of the democratically elected government of Chile in 1973, and the mass murder the coup perpetrators initiated in an effort to secure their position.

At the heart of the film is one of Jack Lemmon's finest performances - which in a career that included The Apartment, The China Syndrome and Some Like it Hot, is saying something. Sissy Spacek and John Shea are dependably fine in support, underscoring the still relevant point that ideological dogmatism and mule-headed ignorance of the world invariably leads to the killing and maiming of ordinary, loving people.",1324512000,,932,5.0519480519480515

Yes, Charlie was dumb, but that's part of being young.  One shouldn't have to die for being young and dumb - especially when the American government was involved.

216079,2,6300182738,"This film may have been originally intended as ""left-wing propaganda,"" as some reviewers contend...or not. It may just be Costa-Gavras's simplistic worldview that is not necessarilly left or right wing but definitely victim-centric.

It's essentially another example of being dumb enough to get into something WAY over your head and not surviving to tell about it.

Charles/Charlie Hormann (Charles to his dad, Charlie to his wife) lives, writes and snoops around in a South American country (Chile, maybe! wink wink) that is imploding with civil war--a military regime has just overthrown the kind, compassionate Marxists who were most recently in power. Charlie, when not working on his illustrated fable starring a duck (yes, he's sensitive and artistic), takes a little road trip and runs into a guy who may as well be wearing a t-shirt that says, I AM A CIA ASSASSIN. (""Here's my card, in case you want someone whacked."") Charlie pesters this person with questions of a political nature, clumsily trying to get information about the coup but instead marking himself as a troublemaker.

Because the CIA usually knows what it's doing, Charlie then disappears. COULD IT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH HIS STUPIDITY? As it happens, yes.

His dad flies down, and this is really the best aspect of the film: Jack Lemmon is great. Mr. Hormann at first gives the American government--represented by embassy personnel--the benefit of the doubt when they, Sergeant Schulz-like, claim to know NOTHING. But it eventually becomes obvious that they're just trying to be nice and cooperative until Mr. Hormann goes back home--which only makes Hormann more determined. (His daughter-in-law/Charlie's wife, Sissy Spacek, treats the authorities with cynicism and hostility,and Hormann eventually begins to see that she has her reasons.) Eventually Mr. Hormann has to admit to himself that his country's representatives may be up to no good, and that Charlie was indeed the victim of foul play.

Your heart really goes out to Lemmon when he tells the ambassador, ""I just want my boy back.""

But sympathy for Charlie? I didn't have much. This is the equivalent of a person who wants to go swimming in shark-infested waters, even though everyone around him warns him not to, and he just INSISTS, and then of course gets eaten...okay, is the shark the bad guy here?

Thousands of young people disappeared in Chile when the movie takes place, and yes, American hands were bloodied in that upheaval. At the same time, there were sound reasons to try to contain Marxism in this hemisphere.  The ends don't justify the means, but this is the way Chileans played the game on their own turf, so I don't know how much input or control our guys actually had.

Charlie learned the hard way that you don't poke a stick into a hornets' nest. And the ""I'm an American"" entitlement argument? If you're an American, you should know better than to assume safety while traipsing around 3rd World countries on the verge of collapse.",1249948800,8,2993,5.006036217303823
216080,5,6300182738,"El 11 de Septiembre, 1973 es un da que vive en la infamidad. Aquella fecha fue cuando el democrticamente elegido gobierno de Salvador Allende fue derrotado por las fuerzas armadas del caudillo Augusto Pinochet y su gobierno militar. Miles y miles de personas fueron torturadas y matadas durante el reino de terror de Pinochet en los primeros das y meses de su gobierno. En todo, se dice que 25% de todos los habitantes chilenos fueron desaparecidos por Pinochet y sus generales. Es decir, fueron fusilados en el estadio nacional en Santiago, drogados y tirados de un avin en el ocano pacfico u otro destino desagradable simplemente porque ellos apoyaron la poltica de la administracin previa o no estaban de acuerdo con las polticas y la filosofa de Pinochet.

Filmado en ingls, la pelcula presenta los incidentes horribles del golpe y de la brutalidad del gobierno de Pinochet a la audiencia europea, norteamericana, australiana, y a otras partes del mundo anglohablante. El director, tambin tuvo que huir de su propia patria a causa de las fuerzas opresivas de la derecha en poder en Grecia. El director seleccion el ingls porque es la lengua de Hollywood y as pudo contar su historia a un mximo de pblico. Probablamente por la primera vez, esas audiencias vieron vividamente como fue el sangriento del golpe militar. Tambin se usa el ingls porque el director nos demuestra que el gobierno estadounidense se meti en el golpe y apoy al rgimen brutal y corrupto de Pinochet.

La pelicula comienza con el periodista Charlie tomando notas en Via del Mar, un balneario por el ocano. Vemos la fecha 15 de Septiembre en su librito. Charlie Horman est escribiendo en su cuaderno y su compaera de viaje Terry, le dijo que tal vez no debera tomar tantas notas. Curiosamente, se encuentran a otro estadounidense en Via que se llama Ray Tower. Tower ofrece llevarlos a casa pero Charlie no acepta la oferta porque no confia en l y no quiere darle su direccin. Porqu no confia en otro paisano en este momento de crisis?

En Santiago, Beth Horgan tiene sus propios problemas. Nos muestran las calles de Santiago tambin. Hay muchos muertos por las calles de Santiago de Chile. El gobierno ha impuesto un toque de queda de 8:30 de la noche. Toda la gente tiene que desocupar las calles o sufrir la alternativa de muerte. Soldados patrullan las calles. Una chica es detenida con fuerza por dos soldados. Por qu? Nadie pregunta a nadie eso. Nadie se atreve mirar. Beth no pudo tomar su colectivo porque todos estaban llenos y decide caminar. Es una mala decisin. Si se quedara en las calles despus de la queda, le mataran a ella. Pero encuentra un lugar de bastante amparo por la noche.

 Extraamente, funcionarios estadounidenses estn en los hoteles de Santiago y Via. As comienza la pelcula Missing, un film que nos explica el envolviemiento de EEUU en el golpe violento del gobierno de Salvador Allende.

Charlie y su esposa Beth son una pareja inocente. Son estadounidenses que viven en Chile y son polticos nefitos. Charlie es un escritor de libros para nios y periodista. Beth es la esposa y probablamente traduce y escribe tambin pero no nos explican mucho de su dedicacin. Cuando se reunen de nuevo, planean salir del pas en dos or tres das.

Sin embargo, dos das despus, Charlie es secuestrado por los militares. Los soldados vienen a su casa en un camin militar para capturarlo. Beth, una mujer poderosa e independiente pero tambin frgil tambin le avisa al padre, Ed Horman. Ed es un mercante muy conservador y viene a Chile queriendo saber que ha pasado a su hijo. Beth por otro lado es muy agresiva y extrovertida. Tienen un choque de estilos, culturas y una brecha de las generaciones. A pesar de estos obstculos personales, juntos tratan averigar la verdad de Charlie. Van a la embajada de EEUU para obtener ayuda en su bsqueda. Al principio, Ed se siente que est recibiendo buen consejo y no entiende porque Beth est tan sospechosa de los funcionarios de la embajada estadounidense. Beth le explica que haba hablado y hablado con ellos y no pas nada.

Ellos, con la ""ayuda"" de los funcionarios tratan investigar exactamente que pas. Hablan con mucha gente del pueblo y Ed habla con una periodista que reporta para un peridico de Nueva York. Luego, aprendemos ms de Charlie. El da despus del golpe, Charlie conoce a un operativo clandestino que se llama Babcock, en el hotel en Via que le dice que es oficial de la armada naval estadounidense y su misin en Chile est completa. Babcock estaba de buen humor como si tuviera mucho xito. El prximo lugar para l es Bolivia. ""Bolivia?"" exclama Charlie en confidencia a su amigo. Porqu un funcionario naval ira a Bolivia? No hay agua en Bolivia. No hay nada excepto el Che Guevara y su sublevacin. Le dice a Charlie ""Si no fuera por Castro, esto no sera necesario"".
Ahora hemos aprendido porque Charlie estaba sospechoso de Tower anteriormente en la pelicula (pero cronologiamente despus). En otra retrospectiva, vemos un film de la casa antes del golpe. Charlie, Frank (amigo suyo) y otros amigos se burlan del gobierno comunista de Allende. Ese hecho prueba que Charlie no es extremo y no tiene alianza poltica con las izquierdistas ni se adhere a ninguna filosofa poltica.

Ed y Beth siguieron la bsqueda y descubrieron en un hospital el cuerpo muerto de uno de los amigos de Charlie, se llama Frank Pertuccio. Despus de ms investigaciones, alguin le cuenta a Ed la verdad. Un ex-polici le ha dicho que su hijo ha sido ejecutado en el estadio nacional. Despus de mucho tiempo, Ed, un hombre que cree en la ciencia cristiana, se vuelve intolerante de los funcionarios tambin. Se da cuenta de que tienen algo para cubrir. Por fin el cuerpo de Charlie aparece en el estadio. Ed acusa a los funcionarios estadounidenses de complicidad en el asesinato de su hijo. Al fin de la pelcula, el mensaje ms fuerte se escucha: Tower le cuenta a Ed que si no personalmente envolviera en estas cosas,  no le habra importado a l. Tower continua ""Protegemos un nivel de la viva para nuestra patria. A veces, tenemos que defenderlo"".

Ed y Beth salen y Ed prometa demandar el gobierno y a los funcionarios de los Estados Unidos. El cuerpo, ahora evidencia, est decompuesto porque es detenido en Chile por siete meses antes de volver a EEUU.

La historia de este incidente y el apoyo de EEUU del dictador brutal se cuenta en trminos poderosos. La pelcula no comenta mucho, en cambio nos muestra los horrores de cerca. Por ejemplo, hay una escena cuando dos chicos tratan de pintar en la pared pblica las palabras ""Militares Asesinatos"". Pero no pueden terminar su mensaje porque fueron asesinados por los soldados. Durante el filme se ven tantos cuerpos y sangre en las calles de Santiago que siempre estarn en la memoria.

Tambin verte luz en las atrocidades y los asesinatos que occurrieron en 1973. Pero lo ms importante es que el filme expone la vinculacin de los Estados Unidos. EEUU era (es) tan anti-comunista que apoyaba el gobierno tan corrupto y represivo como el de Pinochet. La pelcula demuestra que EEUU se meti en las cosas sucias de la derecha en sudamrica para nada ms que proteger sus intereses mercantiles.",1249430400,,7149,4.7696038803556995
216081,4,6300182738,"The 1982 political film, Missing, by Costa-Gavras (his first American production), is a good film, but not a great one. This is mostly because it lacks any real poetry, the way Ingmar Bergman's anti-war film, Shame, has.

Nonetheless, Missing is a very good film (it won the 1982 Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival)- a prose work, if not poetic; and the screenplay by Costa-Gavras and Donald Stewart (which won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay) wears its prosaicness in almost every scene that shows its protagonists relentlessly pushing for the truth. It also showcases probably the best acting performance of the late Jack Lemmon's long career, and it makes one wish he had done more dramatic roles, for as great a comedic actor as he was (The Odd Couple, The Fortune Cookie, etc.), Woody Allen was correct when he claimed that drama was 'sitting at the grownups' table.' It also features some good, if not daring, cinematography by Ricardo Aronovich (the shot of a government helicopter outside of the Horman's hotel room is the best in the film), and a surprisingly understated musical score by Vangelis.

The film is about the 1973 kidnap, torture, and execution of Harvard graduate Charles Horman (John Shea), a nave political dreamer from Middle America, who, with wife and friends, thought he could make a difference by publishing a Left Wing newspaper in Chile, during the Marxist regime of the newly elected Salvador Allende. Then, when the CIA-backed coup of Augusto Pinochet occurred, he and his cronies were personae non grata. The film shows a bit of Horman's life with his wife, Beth (Sissy Spacek), and friends, before he goes missing. After that, we get the appearance of Charles' father, a conservative Christian Scientist businessman named Ed (Lemmon). Very much then happens in the film, save that Ed and Beth both get the runaround from scummy American political waterboys, and Ed grows more and more cynical, after, early on, believing that the American government could do no wrong and that neither Charles nor Beth could do no right.

Perhaps the best aspect of the film is that it does not dwell on gore and violence, instead letting the aftermath paint pictures of what occurred within the viewer's mind, for the imagination is almost always more powerful, disturbing, and graphic than special effects, something this modestly budgeted film conspicuously lacks. The worst moment is likely when a couple of the American flacks at the U.S. Consulate are caught in a lie by Ed, who knows his son has been killed, and they tell him his son is likely still 'in hiding.' The duo so brazenly mock Ed, by telling him that his son should have expected to get burned, just as if he had gone snooping around into the New York Mafia's business. Now, no doubt this claim is a true one, and Charles' nave-te certainly aided his demise, but no government officials would be that brazen and stupid to taunt an American citizen grieving his child's death, much less one like Horman, who obviously had some connections in the government. While this is in keeping with the film's whole portrayal of arrogant Yankee cowboys, it does not square with the obsessive nature of the CIA in covering up their crimes around the world. Yes, it manifests the arc and direction of the film, but it does so at the cost of any realism.

Still, Missing is a film worth seeing, both for its technical quality and its historical mise-en-scene. Just don't expect a film that will last for years in your memory; but do expect to not have that sinking feeling of another unrecoverable two hours of your life. And, given all the crap that Hollywood produces for the Lowest Common Denominator masses today, that's more than just faint praise.",1248825600,,3744,4.863636363636363

The first disc includes a theatrical trailer.

The second disc starts off with two video interviews with Costa-Gavras - one done just after Missing's U.S. premiere and one done for the 2006 French DVD. In the first interview, he addresses the controversy surrounding the film - the U.S. administration did not like the parallels to the situation in El Salvador at the time. The second interview features the director talking about the origins of the project.

Charles' wife, Joyce Horman (played by Sissy Spacek in the film) is interviewed and talks about the accuracy of Missing. She feels that it was lenient on the portrayal of the U.S. government. Joyce talks about how and why she and Charles were in Chile. She also offers her impressions of what it was like there at the time.

""Producing Missing"" features producers Edward and Mildred Lewis and Sean Daniel, and writer Thomas Hauser, author of the film's source book, discussing the making of the film. The Lewis' talk about how Hauser's book motivated them to get the film made. Hauser talks about what drew him to the Charles' story. This is an excellent look at how the film came together by the people who worked on it.

""1982 Cannes Film Festival"" features Costa-Gavras, Jack Lemmon, Ed and Joyce Horman with family friend Terry Simon are interviewed at the festival. Lemmon talks about what drew him to the film while the Hormans talk about their experiences and what they think of the film.

""Pursuing the Truth"" is an interview with Peter Kornbluh, director of the National Security Archive's Chile Documentation Project. He talks about declassified documents pertaining to the U.S.' involvement in the execution of Charles. Kornbluh provides fascinating background to the political background of the film. He also examines how the film is very critical of U.S. involvement in Chile and they helped bring about a coup d'etat.

Finally, there is ""In Honor of Missing,"" an excerpt from a 2002 event by the Charles Horman Truth Project to support efforts to bring General Augusto Pinochet and others to justice for human rights violations. Actor Gabriel Byrne hosts the ceremony and talks about how the film changed him. Costa-Gavras and some of the stars from the film also speak.",1226361600,3,3082,6.2718676122931445

Lemmon plays Ed Horman whose son Charlie, was a somewhat radical writer living in Chile with his wife, Joyse, at the time of the 1973 coup when President Allende was butchered and his struggling government overthrown.

216143,5,6300182738,"The first 2 reviews are excellent; so with regards to content and details I have nothing to add. So I thought I'd take a different approach. With regards to the performances in this film, they are simply stunning - this made for a powerful piece of cinema...

In this day of CGI-made films, focus groups choosing endings, studios picking people for roles based on revenue, movies with parts II, III, IV, etc, this is a throwback to real cinema. Similarly, No Country for Old Men qualifies as a modern day masterpiece - when the acting is brilliant, and there's a good story we have a recipe for a fantastic film.

Sadly this film is not just fiction: it is about a topic which is all too real. A sad comment on repressive regimes and the complexities and dangers of supporting regimes for political reasons. More than that, the personal story illustrates it more powerfully perhaps that a documentary ever could. And I am a huge fan of documentaries.

This review is not a detailed one, it is mostly my personal experience and thoughts on how this film affected me - it has no info with respect to the Criterion release - it is an appeal in support of one of my favorite films of all time.

My only quibble would be that Criterion has already announced pre-releases for their first Bluray discs in November - my impatient nature wants a Bluray release (especially because I like this film so much) but then again a fine piece of cinema like this would not NEED the added visual appeal to enhance the power of the film. I just want it anyway...because I want the experience of this film to be at it's possible best.",1219449600,5,1614,4.517123287671233
216144,5,6300182738,"Charles Horman, the young man whose ""disappearance"" following the murderous right-wing coup in Chile is the subject of this powerful film, was a classmate and friend of mine at Harvard College. After graduation, I didn't keep in touch with Charlie. In fact, the first I heard of his fate at the hands of the butcher Pinochet was when this movie was released. Needless to say, it was the most traumatic experience I've ever had at the cinema.

Ironically, one of the other young men at Harvard in the early 1960s was the son of Milton Friedman, the University of Chicago economist whose economic dogma of absolutist capitalist had almost as much to do with the death of Charles Horman and of the thousands of others who ""disappeared"" into CIA files and unmarked mass graves in Chile, Argentina, and Brazil. I can't remember for sure whether Charlie, David Friedman, and I ever argued about politics/economics as a threesome, but if we did, it would have cast Charlie as the moderate. Moderation and human decency were the qualities most remembered about Charles Horman among his friends and acquaintances at Harvard. Rather few of us foresaw that Friedman's 'neo-liberal' economics, now known as neo-conservatism, would become the intellectual justification of decades of terror-based tyranny in Latin America just as much as for the rise of Reaganomics and the attempt by GW Bush to build a new global free-market Iraq not wanted by Iraqis. This story is well told in the recent book ""The Shock Doctrine: the Rise of Disaster Capitalism"" by Naomi Klein.

216145,3,6300182738,"I know that my opinion is in the minority here, but `Missing' was not the film I was hoping to see.  It draws similarities to last years `A Mighty Heart' but it has almost the complete opposite set of detractions.  I was really put off by `A Mighty Hearts' chaotic pacing (which I tend to believe was a result of trying to convey the chaos of the situation) and found that I couldn't really invest myself in the film as deeply as I wanted to.  With `Missing' I felt the opposite was happening.  The film suffers from almost no chaos.  It just kind of remains stagnant and causes my interest to wane considerably.

The story behind `Missing' is one of intrigue.  It follows Beth and Ed Horman as they pressure the government to find their missing husband/son.  Charlie Horman, a journalist, was in South America (where he lived with this wife) when he went missing, and the local authorities do not seem to want to lend a helping hand as Beth and Ed struggle to find him.

What I will say about the film is that script was constructed very well.  The political corruption that stilted the discovery of Charles whereabouts is brilliantly handled and given ample attention.  The relationship between Beth and Ed is also given just treatment, for they are seen as real people and not characters on a screen.  This being a true story, it is important that there be an honesty to the situations and activities, and you can feel that in `Missing'.  I won't say that the pacing hinders the film entirely, for there are moments within the film where the pulled back delivery works well, but the entire film should not feel that way.  A little more attention to that detail could have lifted this film from a merely passable drama to a tightly woven drama.

Another quarrel that I have is with Jack Lemmon.  I personally adore this actor and feel that almost everything he has touched has been fantastic.  This was not one of those moments for me.  I didn't feel as though his confliction was believable.  He felt almost uncomfortable, and that discomfort didn't read well on the screen.  When I first saw this film I thought that maybe I just didn't like Lemmon as a dramatic actor, but that's not the case, for his performances in films like `The China Syndrome' and `Short Cuts' were impeccable to say the least.  Here though I just saw him acting as apposed to living.

Like `A Mighty Heart' though, `Missing' rises on the wings if it's female lead.  Sissy Spacek is effortlessly captivating as Beth.  Her performance captures everything that Lemmon could not, delivering a real living breathing wife trying desperately to find answers.  Spacek is a phenomenal actress, and this is one of her finest performances.

In the end I have to say that `Missing' did not deliver all that it should have.  I know that I am not in the majority when I say that, for most of the reviews for this film are on the four and five star range.  Maybe they are seeing something that I am not; well, obviously they are.  To say that I just don't appreciate a slow moving drama would be missing the point (some of my favorite films are slower paced and brooding like `In the Bedroom' or the recently reviewed `The Door in the Floor') because to slow a film down to create a mood is one thing, but there comes a point where your pace can effect your audiences interest, and if that is not taken into account then one can become bored and eventually sever all emotional connection to a film.  You have to learn when to speed things up and when to pull things back.  There's compromise and give and take in everything; especially filmmaking.",1218585600,3,3611,4.551937984496124
216146,5,6300182738,"Costa-Gavras shot his controversial 'State of Siege' in Chile not long before the violent US-backed Allende coup. Maybe it's that familiarity with the locale that makes Costa-Gavras' 'Missing' seem so authentic.

More than just a startling vision of day-to-day life in the aftermath of a violent coup, there's much more of a feeling for the place and what ordinary people lost in the coup. There's a real sense of chaos in its imagery - dead bodies littering the streets as people try to go about their daily business or floating by in rivers, soldiers chasing and shooting at a white horse through deserted streets or diners on a rooftop garden leaving their meals to watch a helicopter gunship shoot at unseen curfew violators. The sheer casual and irrational nature of violence (""You Americans always assume there has to be a reason"") gives the film a palpable sense of terror and dread: this is a place where even an earthquake can't get people out onto the dangerous streets after curfew.

The fact that this time round Costa-Gavras had a Hollywood budget to play with helps immensely, but he also has a script based around people who aren't defined strictly by their politics - indeed, the movie is basically a search for `a political neophyte' by a gruff and unlikeable conservative (Jack Lemmon, on excellent form) and the missing man's wife (Sissy Spacek), a search that takes in embassies crowded with asylum seekers, morgues with hundreds of bodies piled almost haphazardly and the national football stadium that has been turned into a vast prison/torture chamber/place of execution. It's an outraged film but it's also one aware of its own impotence - this is a journey from hope to bitter and exhausted acceptance that there is nothing that an individual can do in the face of politically expedient mass murder.

It's easily Costa-Gavras' real enduring masterpiece, having lost none of its power more than a quarter of a century on, and its sobering to think that there was a time when movies like this weren't just mainstream releases, they were also big box-office.

After  only being available on one of Universal's shoddiest DVDs - it doesn't even have a menu page! - the  film  is finally  getting the Criterion treatment it  deserves with  a  two-disc set  including:

- Video interviews with Costa-Gavras  and Joyce Horman (wife of Charles Horman).
- Producing  Missing, an  interview documentary featuring producers Edward and Mildred Lewis,  studio exec Sean Daniel, and Thomas Hauser, author of Missing, the film's source book.
- Interviews from the 1982 Cannes Film Festival with Costa-Gavras, Jack Lemmon, Ed Horman (father of Charles), and Joyce Horman. Unfortunately,  as  these  were  made  for  a live  French  TV  broadcast these are simultaneously translated into French.
- New video essay with Peter Kornbluh, author of The Pinochet File, examining declassified documents concerning the 1973 military coup in Chile and the case of Charles Horman.
- Video highlights from the 2002 Charles Horman Truth Project event honoring the twentieth anniversary of Missing, with actors Sissy Spacek, John Shea, and Melanie Mayron
- Theatrical trailer
- A booklet featuring a new essay by critic Michael Wood, an interview with Costa-Gavras, the U.S. State Department's official response to Missing, and an open letter from Horman family friend Terry Simon.

216149,4,6300182738,"During the Cold War (1945-1990) it was the policy of successive US governments to maintain authoritarian right-wing governments in power all around the world if there was a possibility that they might be replaced by one from the left, democratic or otherwise. As the US ambassador in this film reminds us `we act in the interests of the United States', not in the interests of the country which happens to be suffering under a dictatorship. We can accept this on an intellectual level - how else can the US government establishment act - but in this movie Costa-Gavras uses his very considerable skills as a film-maker to rouse even diehard conservatives to anger over the methods used to ensure Pax Americana.

He does this by dramatizing the real-life story of one of their number, Ed Holman (Jack Lemmon), a businessman from New York and a Christian Scientist with faith in Truth, into the aftermath of a military coup in an unnamed South American country with the capital of Santiago. His son Charles (John Shea), a vaguely left-wing journalist and writer, living in the city with his wife Beth (Sissy Spacek), has disappeared after being arrested a few days after the coup and carted off to a makeshift concentration camp in the National Stadium. Initially, Ed believes the people at the American consulate and embassy really are there to help him, but it soon turns out they have an agenda of their own. Ed and his son's wife start out on bad terms but Ed comes to appreciate her bravery in the face of a very unstable situation. He also comes to realize the moral worth of his son, who he had previously regarded as a bit of a playboy, much as he had loved him.

What ""Missing"" cannot say, though it says a lot, is that the country it portrays is Chile in the first days of the unelected reign of Pinochet. What it does say, much of which has been corroborated by recently unclassified documents, is that the United States, led by the statesmanship of Henry Kissinger, supported Pinochet's coup and toppling of a democratically elected regime because they were not friendly enough to ""American interests."" The bottom line, as the movie makes inarguably clear, is that Pinochet was propped up into power largely thanks to the United States; the blood of thousands of Chileans is thus partially on our hands. This is the larger political point of the film. Until our government owns up to this, one of the most abominable and least-discussed crimes of the Nixon administration, the film ""Missing,"" despite being a fictional take on true events, will be an enormously important document. This is art so close to politics that there's almost no art there. But it still must be seen; the message is too important. All Americans need to confront this episode in our past and come to terms with the fact that our government is a democracy only up to a point. Beyond that point, there are decisions made that we have no control over, no knowledge of, but nonetheless result in horrific events.

Costa-Gavras sketches a Santiago beyond all nightmares, so hellish that it simply had to be true. With almost constant gunfire and monstrosities going on in plain view, we watch Chileans suffer enormously under the strain and stress. The film is an exercise in impotence, de-humanization. Ed Holman (Jack Lemmon), in one of his most courageous performances, has the humility to offer an utterly normal American man's reaction to all this. First he trusts his government, and then, as he realizes that they are at fault for his son's death, he simply implodes. He makes threats but we are instantly told they will achieve nothing. He is even reprimanded by the American officials responsible; his son should have not been a ""snoop"": ""you play with fire, you get burned."" He crumples, worn down by a world more brutal than imaginable. It is the price we pay, the film seems to say, for living in a safe, wealthy country like America: this blood on our hands that we don't ever think about. And then, if we are forced to confront it, our own ignorance leaves us too weak to deal with it.

Ed Holman's character's impotence is matched by that of his son's, in his arrest and death. This is one of the bleakest films I have ever seen on the subject of individuality in the face of the state. Chile is meant to stand both for the 3rd world and America- both at once, complicit in this mini-Holocaust. His son is a decent guy, totally harmless, attempting to ""be connected to the whole enchilada,"" as his wife puts it, but certainly no revolutionary. But what does this life, this human being who has lived with integrity, matter when bulldozed by the sweep of a machine-like government? Indeed, the US officials who pretend to help Ed Holman are truly cogs; emotionless, deadpan, their portrayal is surely propagandistic- the politicos of our worst fears. But the film's resonance is more the possibility that this was true; it seems likely, given what is now known of Nixon's administration. What other sort of people could have knowingly perpetrated such monstrosities besides Eichmanns, empty of soul or conscience, pure puppets?

As I said, there is ultimately little art in this film. It is certainly not about the triumph of the human spirit, as the battle is already lost before Ed Holman gets to Chile. No, it is more about the total negation of the human spirit, and body, for that matter, in the face of the indomitable state. Problematic as it may be, this art document leaves a strictly political aftertaste, because it so convincingly asks the question: why, as a country, have we not come to terms with the fact that our government is responsible for events like this, time and time again?",1208736000,7,5691,4.750252780586451

Though, this film adaptation does not mention Chile directly, you don't have to read between the lines too closely to know what country it is alluding to.  Director Costa-Gavras powerfully directed this piece, and his cast works brilliantly together.  Jack Lemmon is stoic and very believable as Ed, Sissy Spacek is chilling as Charles Horman's wife, and John Shea does a great job in portraying the missing journalist.

I couldn't help feeling a sense of profound rage as I watched the horrible political corruption that existed in 1970s Chile, and how seemingly apathetic the United States government appeared, especially when they were called upon to search for and follow up on the case of Charles Horman.

216178,4,6300182738,"I have not read the source book for this 1982 Costa-Gavras political film, but it would appear that not too many liberties were taken with the actual events on which MISSING is based.  At least, one can guess as much since the film is as full of random twists and turns as real life is.  A more calculated filmmaker would probably have ""distilled"" the facts of the story down more, you know, to get the ""essential truth of the events,"" or, more honestly, to make for a more steamlined, evenly paced (and hence, more marketable) movie.  That is, of course, not the way Costa-Gavras works, and his adherence to the facts (at least as he understands them) is an admirable trait.  For once, you are not tempted to snicker when you learn that a film was ""inspired by actual events.""

It's probably not too surprising, then, that the narrative was not altered to make for a ""bigger"" ending.  A father's search for his missing son in bloody, post-Allende Chile, does not end with the discovery of a corpse, or with a dramatic confession on the part of the wrongdoers or their allies.  Word is gradually leaked to the grieving all-American dad, joined in the search by his courageous, vaguely countercultural daughter-in-law, that his son was killed only a few days after the junta came to power.  And when that truth comes out, it is not denied by the American authorities who had ostensibly been assisting the duo in their search.

Somehow the body is located and, months later, returned to the family in the US.  By that time, the body is too decomposed for an autopsy to yield any authoritative results and the newly ""politicized"" dad is thwarted in his attempts to sue US authorities for the wrongful death of his son.  (It would appear that the vengeance that remained to him is the publication and eventual filmization of his book--which, one hopes, may have provided him some way of honoring his son in death and some satisfaction that guilty parties had been, at least, publicly named).

So MISSING would appear to be an honest and heartfelt movie.  It is not, however, without its flaws.  The film makes much of the inherent conflict between the button-downed, Christian Scientist dad and his irreverent, hippie-ish daughter-in-law.  Whatever the real-life relationship may have been, the film parlays it into a more traditional ""teaming of opposites"" cinematic trope.  Troupers Jack Lemmon and Sissy Spacek give the script their all, and oft times the honesty is there.  Other times, their steady bickering comes across as the standard screenwriters take on ""intergenerational warfare.""

A few other crucial moments ring false too.  An exchange between Lemmon and US officials wherein the latter virtually admit their involvement, seem to justify their support of the coup as a means of preserving the US's ""damn fine way of life"" is both cliched and dramatically off beat.  I'm not sure if any such passage appeared in the book, but whatever the case, the movie version of that encounter needed a much lighter hand.

One opportunity that seems to have been wasted in the film is the significance of Jack Lemmon's character's devout faith in Christian Science.  When asked by one of the American officials about his beliefs, Lemmon replies that it's about ""faith...in the truth.""  That may not be such a horrible summation of one of Christian Science's basic tenets, but here it is used, for dramatic effect, as a signal that the protagonist will prove to be relentless in his search for the truth about his son's disappearance.

His devotion to the faith also provides the filmmaker with a shorthand explanation for the father's seemingly entrenched conservatism.  I would not dispute that many Christian Scientists lean a bit right of center, politically.  Even when that's the case, however, CS is fundmentally different from the hardline social conservatism found in Christian fundamentalism, say.  According to the Church's teaching, political conflict--like all human discord and disease--is essentially a misperception of humankind's true nature as a spiritual, non-material being.  War, strife, and bloody revolution ultimately have no spiritual reality: they are, essentially, all part of the ""Adam dream,"" and ultimately illusory.

Had the father's inner spiritual conflict been played out more in this movie, it could have made for some riveting moments, I'm sure.  In order for him to become ""radicalized"" or ""politicized"" at all, he would have to come to question basic tenets of his deeply held faith.  It is almost certainly something of an oversimplification to suggest that a devout ""Scientist"" would have to deny the truth his ""mortal senses"" are screaming at him, but he would certainly have to see his son's disappearance, ultimately, as one more apparent human evil in need of spiritual healing.

That he cannot, that he must engage in earthly conflict with malevolent political forces suggests a profound spiritual crisis that could have been fascinating to see at least suggested...if not fully played out.  Lemmon's character seems, of necessity perhaps, to be abandoning his church's fundamental teaching that ""divine love has always met and will always meet every human need"" to draw the conclusion sometimes a man has to take a stand and fight a very real--very earthbound--battle against human evil.

Not easy to portray on screen, but even hinted at, that spiritual crisis would have added yet another dimension to an already worthy film.",1169251200,,5470,5.047830923248053

In addition, the Chilean Supreme Court has named former US Consul Fred Purdy (Phil Putnam in the movie), who lives as a private citizen in Chile, as a suspect.

216180,5,6300182738,"Accomplished Greek-French filmmaker Costa-Gavras has a compelling way of bringing the emotional resonance out of stories with overtly political themes. He hits the nail on the head with this searing indictment of American involvement in the 1973 military coup that ejected Allende from power in Chile. Facts are not discretely presented, even the country in which the story takes place is not disclosed (except for specific references to the cities of Santiago and Vina Del Mar). Yet, Costa-Gavras creates an atmosphere of palpable tension that doesn't let up in this 1982 film, and the unraveling mystery at the heart of the movie echoes the unsettling political situation surrounding the characters.

Adapted by Costa-Gavras and Donald Stewart from Thomas Hauser's non-fiction book documenting the true case, the plot focuses on American expatriate Charles Horman whose sudden disappearance in the days after the Pinochet coup brings together two familial adversaries, his wife Beth and his father Ed, who has flown in from New York. Charles and Beth had been leading a vagabond existence with his work in children's animation and their relatively passive support of Allende's reform measures. Charles' back story is revealed in carefully constructed flashback episodes that show him to be curious about the presence of U.S. military personnel in the area. Once he disappears, Ed and Beth seek help from the U.S. Consulate but face a seemingly insurmountable wall of bureaucracy. Frustrated, Ed, a highly conservative Christian Scientist, lashes out at Beth for what he considers her undesirable influence over his son. However, as they absorb the scope of the violence and the culpability of the U.S. government, they bond intractably toward their objective of finding Charles.

For once, Jack Lemmon, unafraid to convey his character's prejudices, is able to use his neurotically coiled energy in a suitable dramatic role as Ed. The result is a startlingly raw performance that ranks among his best. Sissy Spacek is terrific as Beth, though her character does not experience as big an arc of self-revelation. In the elliptical flashback role of Charles, John Shea provides solid support, as do Janice Rule as a political activist and a number of familiar TV faces - Melanie Mayron as friend Terry and David Clennon as U.S. consul Phil Putnam, both from ""thirtysomething"", and Joe Regalbuto, Frank from ""Murphy Brown"", playing another Frank, a possible victim of the coup.

It comes near the end in a confrontation between Charles Horman (Jack Lemmon) and staff members of the American ambassador in post-coup Chile, 1973. To this point the staff has sounded polished and professional in their concern for Horman's missing son, an apparent casualty of the coup. But in this scene the devious reality of American policy begins to emerge from behind the velvet glove, and Horman's passage from credulous liberal to disillusioned skeptic is complete. In a nutshell, the scene symbolizes one of the great divides in American political life, between the polished propaganda face our government presents to the people and the grim realities that face covers over, especially in dealing with Third World countries like Chile. Horman represents the frustration many feel in trying to deal with a cosmetic facade supported by both major political parties, when beneath it crouches the murderous policies of imperial rule. The real question the film poses is what Horman will do upon returning home.

The film itself remains a gripping eyeopener from first to last. Costa-Gravas is especially good at recreating the abject terror of fascist rule: where long hair is forbidden and women are forced back into skirts, where people are present one minute and gone the next, where a democratically elected government is present one minute and gone the next, and where a Henry Kissinger can do the behind-the-scenes dirty work and be honored for it (not in the movie, but true nevertheless). The acting is first-rate, and a tour-de-force for Lemmon in particular. Ditto, the often overlooked Charles Cioffi who puts the real chill in the confrontation scene. Two complaints: the arch symbolsm of the riderless white horse  conflicts with Costa-Gravas's documentary approach, and why, oh why, did they have to make Horman's son so cuddly. The audience gets the point without spooning on the sugar. Anyhow, this remains a fine piece of revelatory film-making and retains as much relevancy for today's audience as it did twenty years ago.",1134432000,4,2098,5.185840707964601

As a result of the declassification of secret documents authorised by President Clinton this role is now documented comprehensively. Men such as J.D.

With the disintegration of the Communist USSR, it is disquieting to see the present administration in the US taking up the same alliances against a new threat, Islam. Co-incidentally, these alliances offered side benefits: massive profits by US corporations because of unstable economies in South American countries, huge personal fortunes raised by participation in the munitions and drugs trades, a rise in prestige and power of the military establishment, and the bolstering of political popularity by regimes who carried out little positive legislation for their nation. These operations (of course I am not referring to specific instances, but generalising) were taken for security reasons. Hindsight has proven them to be wrong. But those who will not learn from their mistakes are sentenced to repeat them.

However it is not necessary to enter into the details of this background to understand or appreciate this film. To follow the plot, you need to know only that the socialist government of Allende was seen as a new hope for Chile, and attracted idealists from other countries wanting to participate in its social program; that these social changes were undermined by a worldwide inflation in the early 1970s which gave an opportunity for  the right wing military opponents of Allende to take control of the country (they had suffered a massive electoral defeat); that the US government was committed to overthrow the socialist regime in Chile and poured  11 million US dollars into the effort, as well as misrepresenting the situation to their electorate and the rest of the world; and that the dictatorship of General Pinochet resulted in 3,000 murders of alleged socialists and the imprisonment and torture of 28,000 more, with US government connivance.

This is what is going on in the background of the film. If it was what the film was about, however, it would be a horrifying diatribe we would be reluctant to listen to or watch.

The film instead is constructed around the amazing acting talents of Jack Lemmon, and he makes the film an overwhelming experience by giving one of his greatest performances. Based on a book called The Execution of Charles Horman, Costa-Gavros' script focuses on the search of Charles Horman's father, Ed (Lemmon) and Charles' wife Beth (Spacek) for the missing writer. The night time sets, with curfew in force, searchlights and helicoptors prowling, and frequent bursts of staccato machine gun fire, create a nightmare, desperate world familiar to all those who have seen Blade Runner.

Throughout the film we are presented with the moral choice various characters make: how far will you go in support of what you believe in? If you believe socialism is ruining the country would you torture and murder socialists? If you think a new order will bring benefit to millions, would you risk your life and spend 17 hours a day bringing out a left wing newspaper? If you think it better that millions suffer to safeguard your own way of life, would you turn a blind eye to terrorism? If you love your son, would you attack your consulate officials for non co-operation in searching for him, and sue your government for complicity in  crimes against humanity after his death?(and if you think communism is a totalitarian regime that curbs democratic rights, would you engage in totalitarian means to combat it?)

Because these questions are raised in this political context, it is important to distinguish fact from fiction. The facts presented are accurate, but they serve a dramatic, not documentary, end. The film is both a story of a search for a missing person, with artfully rising suspense and a powerful climax, and a study in relationships, chiefly between father and son, and father and daughter-in-law. Ed Horman only discovers his son after he goes missing, that is his tragedy. He has spent his life not seeing a lot of what he should have seen. His story thus echoes the political point that Costa-Gavras wants to make. It is our political right to be aware of the world we live in; failing that, we inherit a world we don't like at all. Further, there is a hint in the blossoming relationship between Beth and Ed that ideologies are for people, that people are not for ideologies. That no matter what you believe, you should commit to it, and that commitment should never, never, affect your ability to relate to other people in a positive, enhancing way.

Those interested in the topic of this film might also like The Official Story (Luis Puenzo, 1985), concerning General Videla's reign of terror in Argentina. Videla came to power three years after General Pinochet, in 1976, with massive  support from President Reagan and his administration, who supplied funds, arms and training for his forces. Over 30,000 people perished, murdered, tortured, exiled or 'disappeared' during Videla's dictatorship. Again the motive was anti-communism: arms from the US, training from ex members of the Nazi party and funds from a mafia organised drug cartel (which was able to set up a profitable business in the country with, ultimately, disastrous results for young people in America). The Official Story stars the great Norma Aleandro, and is concerned with the profitable trade in babies carried out by Videla's regime, whereby political prisoners who were pregnant were delivered of their babies before being executed, and the babies then sold to wealthy childless couples in the administration. Over 500 babies are thought to have been sold in this ghastly trade. The human drama of a marriage that disintegrates under the suspicion that a member of it has been involved in the baby trade is the subject of the film while the political situation forms the background. Again, the moral choices of individuals is focused on: if your wife was desperate for a child, would you supply one if it meant murdering its real mother? Is this a violation of the trust you share with your wife? The film features a stunning performance from Aleandro (an exile).",1131235200,8,6812,5.046222222222222

216221,5,6300182738,"Costa-Gavras shot his controversial 'State of Siege' in Chile not long before the violent US-backed Allende coup. Maybe it's that familiarity with the locale that makes Costa-Gavras' 'Missing' seem so authentic.

More than just a startling vision of day-to-day life in the aftermath of a violent coup, there's much more of a feeling for the place and what ordinary people lost in the coup. There's a real sense of chaos in its imagery - dead bodies littering the streets as people try to go about their daily business or floating by in rivers, soldiers chasing and shooting at a white horse through deserted streets or diners on a rooftop garden leaving their means to watch a helicopter gunship shoot at unseen curfew violators. The sheer casual and irrational nature of violence (""You Americans always assume there has to be a reason"") gives the film a palpable sense of terror and dread: this is a place where even an earthquake can't get people out onto the dangerous streets after curfew.

The fact that this time round Costa-Gavras had a Hollywood budget to play with helps immensely, but he also has a script based around people who aren't defined strictly by their politics - indeed, the movie is basically a search for `a political neophyte' by a gruff and unlikeable conservative (Jack Lemmon, on excellent form) and the missing man's wife (Sissy Spacek), a search that takes in embassies crowded with asylum seekers, morgues with hundreds of bodies piled almost haphazardly and the national football stadium that has been turned into a vast prison/torture chamber/place of execution. It's an outraged film but it's also one aware of its own impotence - this is a journey from hope to bitter and exhausted acceptance that there is nothing that an individual can do in the face of politically expedient mass murder.

It's easily Costa-Gavras' real enduring masterpiece, having lost none of its power more than a quarter of a century on, and its sobering to think that there was a time when movies like this weren't just mainstream releases, they were also big box-office. It's just a shame that Universal's DVD is such a shoddy disc - it doesn't even have a menu page! This is a film that really does deserve the Criterion treatment (which it  will finally be  getting  later  in 2008), or a special edition at the very least (there's  already  one  available  in France). But buy it anyway for the film itself.",1119052800,3,2420,4.849514563106796
216222,4,6300182738,"The US is a country that has a proud record of democracy and personal freedom. Americans cherish that at home. They also work hard and are very successful economically.

This all tends to make them look inward and rejoice in their own sucessful society. In the process they rarely take time and trouble to check what the organs (many times secret - like the CIA) of their state does outside their borders (in their name). Sometimes what those organs do in other countries are in contradiction to the freedoms and human rights that Americans so cherish at home - and evangelise as universal truths.

Sometimes these two realities overlay in a situation.

Like in the situation wherein this movie takes place

Missing plays out against the background of the ""other"" 9/11 - when the US helped to organise a bloody coup against the democratically elected government of Chili on 9 Sept 1973 and helped to replace the socialist govt of Salvador Allende with the dictatorial military regime of genl Augusto Pinochet.

This movie is about a patriotic, hard working US man looking for his son who went missing in the violence surrounding that coup in Chili.

He is in the process confronted with a state organ transgressing in another country all that is for him holy in democratic freedom at home. It is argued at one point by US State dept officials in the movie that it must be done to enable him to enjoy those freedoms ""at home"".

But the price for him was his son's life. Is it worth it? What is the worth of freedom at home when it is bought with fascism and death in another country? Can it not be achieved without this?

Missing stops short of asking these questions because the story runs with the actions of the father (Jack Lemmon) and he does not (did not? - the story is based on fact) ask those questions. He does not try to resolve those contradictions that to this day bedevils the moral base of US foreign policy.

In that it is a good movie, however. It stays true to it's journalistic style that merely lays bare the facts and the situation and does not overtly moralise about it.

And in the end, it is the the Americans watching it that must answer those questions.",1117929600,2,2178,4.561538461538461
216282,5,6300182738,"I was an exchange student in Chile the summer of 1969.  There was already plenty of campaign grafitti all over the walls of Santiago.  It was easy to tell that the political emotions were high and the eventual winner would probably have no more than a 36% share of the vote.  I kept in touch with the politics (although I forgot to sell my few shares of Anaconda before the election).  I thought that a democratically elected Marxist president had great potential for international political understanding.  However, things took a major turn in 1973.

Costa Gavras was just the director to bring this tale of political terror to the big screen.  ""Missing"" gives us a pretty real sense of what it may have been like in those days of retribution (for lack of a better word).  We see the story through the eyes of a father in search of his missing son.  The father, played excellently by Jack Lemmon, comes across as either apolitical or conservative.  His daughter-in-law, still living in the country she and her husband moved to in the enthusiasm many had for the Allende government, reveals the somewhat naive liberalism of she and her husband.  An odd couple (excuse the Lemmon pun), they set out to find their son/husband with the less than competent (or is it less than cooperative) help of the US enbassy officials.  The various individuals and attitudes they encounter gives us an idea of the coordinated chaos that the powers that be oversaw.  Along their journey, Lemmon gets plenty of insights to the precarious security that exists in the wake of a coup d'etat.

The power of ""Missing"" is in Costa Gavras's ability to give the viewer a sense of the fear, desperation, exasperation and anger that Lemmon's character goes through.  We don't get any advance insight to what happens next and we are waiting for SOMETHING to happen just as the father is.  There are some points in which things may seem to slow down but it is purposeful; a reminder that waiting at a time like this is very nerve-wracking.

I went back to Chile in 1985 to visit the family I stayed with.  Pinochet was still in power but things had relaxed greatly by then.  I expected to hear endless stories about the terror of the early days of Pinochet.  Instead I heard endless stories of the economic chaos of the Allende years.

Although americans may think that the movie is propagandistic, with my hand on my heart, I tell you: this movie is a timid and sensitive portrait of the fear half of the chileans felt those days. The other half, were happy and enjoying the change. And that division in our country, is also very hard to understand and to swallow, after so many years. The tensions betweeen Jack Lemmon and Sissy Spacek are very similar to the ones seen in the novel of Isabel Allende (The House of the Spirits), between the patriarch who supports the coup and his own daughter who is married to an insurgent.

216285,4,6300182738,"Following my first viewing of this movie, I was angry.  At the filmmaker.  There are two sides to every story, but obviously such common sense is lost on director Costa-Gavras, whose radical and anti-American agenda is the motor that drives the story for MISSING--a film that remains as controversial as its award-winning release more than two decades ago.

Don't get me wrong.  Was there despicable behavior on the part of the U.S. government during the CIA-backed coup in Chile back in 1973?  You bet.  Was American involvement in the overthrow of a democratically elected government a serious mistake?  In hindsight, yes.  Yet Costa-Gravas' portrayal of bloodthirsty soldiers gunning people down in the streets--with the duplicitous approval of evil American officials--creates more questions than answers.  And the film suggests the Americans gave tacit approval for the execution of fellow citizens by the new regime, an outstanding assertion that was implied, but never proven--particularly by Costa-Gravas.  Further eroding the credibility of the film was the alleged ""idealistic"" presence of Americans living in Chile prior to Allende's ouster.  So these people were there to bask in and appreciate and study a South American socialist paradise?  Nothing more?  Hmmm?

But enough whining.  Once I got over the political agenda of this film I concentrated on the story--of a man and his daughter-in-law going on an agonizing journey to find both a son and a husband.  When young Charlie Horman (John Shea) suddenly disappears shortly following the military coup, his father, Ed (Jack Lemmon), travels to Chile to personally look for his son.  Ed is a consummate American patriot; he believes in the inherent goodness of his government, and he also disapproves of the lifestyle and politics of his son and daughter-in-law, Beth (Sissy Spacek).  It becomes apparent that Ed and Charlie were fairly estranged, yet the father learns more and more about his son--and his daughter-in-law--in his hopeless quest.  I despise government bureaucracy, and Ed has to confront it in spades:  never-ending red tape, misinformation, lack of cooperation, even callousness, from his own embassy and consulates.  On top of what appears to be a cover-up, Ed and Beth must deal with the constant stress of uniformed thugs in the streets, of going through hospitals, and then morgues, as the somber realization slowly comes to clarity:  that Charlie will not be found.

Jack Lemmon is brilliant in this film.  He vividly creates the anguish of a father looking for his son; several of his scenes, particularly in the latter stages of the movie, are heartbreaking.  Spacek is equally good as a loving wife--as a daughter-in-law who gains more and more respect from Ed.  MISSING is compelling and spellbinding drama, and despite my discomfort with its politics I recommend it.

216286,5,6300182738,"Missing is more timely than ever.  As of this writing (December 2004) the notorious Chilean dictator Pinochet is now on trial for crimes against humanity in his native country where, if justice prevails, he will be dealt with harshly.  In this film, set in an unnamed country but obviously Chile (the cities of Vina del Mar and Santiago are referred to explicitly), Charlie Horman and his wife Beth have come to live, circa the mid to late 70s, and it is there that Charlie goes missing.

The extreme violence of the regime is depicted well here--people are executed both on- and off-screen--but even more piercing is the intentional, cold callousness of the obviously complicitous Americans with titles--either military or political--who think nothing of mentioning a freight charge to an American who has just recently found out about the death of his son and wants the body sent back to the US.

In probably his best dramatic performance on film, Jack Lemmon portrays Ed Horman, Charlie's father, who, with Beth, initiates a search for his missing son.  At first dismissive of Beth's clearly liberal politics, he quickly comes to understand the reason for her cynicism.  In the face of harsh indifference, brutal lies, and extreme violence, his humanity emerges and we see a man at the end of his tether expressing what is deepest and truest in his heart.

Sissy Spacek as Beth is also very fine, as is the supporting cast--John Shea as Charlie, Charles Cioffi as the snide Major Towers, Joe Regalbuto as a friend of Charlie's who refuses to accept just how bad things are, and David Clennon as a particularly obnoxious American diplomat.  But this is a tour-de-force for Jack Lemmon and he is absolutely riveting.

In this film, Costa-Gavras has gravitated from the somewhat one-dimensional--though groundbreaking--focus in Z on political corruption to political violence that directly impacts the lives of two individuals who respond humanly to it.  This gives the film a profound emotional depth that we did not see in Z, and makes it supremely compelling.  Though Z is a great film, this, I feel, is far superior; I count it as Costa-Gavras' best, in fact.

Based on true events, Missing is a powerful film that will stand the test of time for decades to come.  One of the best films of the 80s--highly recommended.",1103068800,12,2322,4.923076923076923
216287,5,6300182738,"The film itself stands up remarkably well, with compelling and powerful performances of Jack Lemmon and Sissy Spacek.  Lemmon plays the father, and Spacek the wife, of an American citizen who goes missing during the early days of the military coup in Chile.  I think it's one of Lemmon's greatest roles, and the way that his relationship with Spacek evolves is both credible and moving. Director Costa-Gavras makes a political statement that's as powerful as the one he made in his classic film ""Z"" (another great movie, which received better treatment in its DVD release than ""Missing"").

The video transfer is adequate, if not state-of-the-art.  The image lacks clarity, and the colors seem muted, but this fits the tone of the film.  The audio track is mediocre, and I found I had to frequently adjust the volume in order for it to be audible.

The real disappointment with this DVD is the total lack of even the most rudimentary DVD features.  There is no menu.  You insert the DVD, and the film begins.  While there are chapters, there is no chapter listing anywhere, so you must move through them with the DVD's controls, not knowing where you will end up until you get there.

I only paid $8 for the DVD at a local bookstore, so I am not really complaining, but be warned that this DVD gives new meaning to the term ""bare bones"".

If you're a fan of the movie, you will probably get this while it's available, since it is unlikely that it will re-appear in a special edition.

216288,5,6300182738,"Based on Thomas Hauser's book, ""The Execution of Charles Horman: An American Sacrifice"", Costa Govras' MISSING caused a sensation when it was first released.  Winner of the Palm D'Or, and nominated for a slew of Oscars, the film details the true events of Charles Horman, a 31 year old filmmaker and writer who, along with his wife, were living in Chile when the Allende government was overthrown in a bloody coup d'etat on (ironically) Sept. 11, 1973.  Horman disappeared soon after, leaving his wife Joyce (named Beth in the movie) and father in a desperate search to find him amidst the tumultuous political terror of the Pinochet regime.  Led in circles by incompetent US embassy and government officials, it becomes clear that the United States may very well have conspired in Horman's disappearance...

With the recent events of Pinochet's hopeful trial for crimes against humanity, and the obvious occupation of Iraq under the Bush administration, MISSING remains a political powerhouse.  But the film also works on a very human level -- how a father comes to learn more about his son than he ever imagined, and the terrible knowledge that our country participated in the overthrow of one of the oldest Democratically-elected governments in favor of a tyrant who killed thousands of human beings.

Jack Lemmon and Sissy Spacek are at the top of their form, and Vangelis provides a simple, haunting score.

I do hope that the DVD will include this original ending because it really ""puts a period on the end of the sentence"" and invites the viewer to open their eyes just a little bit wider to the world in which we live.  MISSING will give viewers a sense of what it's like to live in a country that doesn't have the same freedoms we do here in the US but does not shirk its responsibility to identify why we do business in these countries.

  This is one of the saddest movies I've ever seen.  Its a story about disillusionment with ones government seen through the eyes of a father, Ed Hormann (Jack Lemmon) searching for his son, Charles Hormann, in the aftermath of the CIA sponsored overthrow of the Allende Government in Chile, 1972.

  Helping him bridge the gap between his utopian view of the United States as promoter and savior of democracy and his son's leftward leaning, Vietnam War era generation view of the world is his daughter in law, Beth Hormann, (Sissy Spacek).

  Throughout the ordeal of their search Jack Lemmons character has his eyes pried open to what is happening and he gains respect and admiration for the strength of his son and, especially, his daughter in law, where before existed only contempt at their choice of a ""bohemian"" lifestyle.

  This is based on a true story and the story is continuing to unfold.  With immunity being stripped from General Pinochet, many of the documents and witnesses surrounding the events leading up to the roundup and execution of these ""leftists"" are being brought to light and used against the former dictator in both criminal and civil suits; one of which is based on the events of this movie.

  I highly recommend this movie as a human drama and as a historical reference.  I can't imagine someone watching this movie and not doing a google search for the true story of these events.

216311,5,6300182738,"Constantin Costa-Gavros is one of my favorite directors and film makers. In 1982 he crossed into the main stream with the Hollywood backed ""Missing."" This is a film about the military coup, led by General Agusto Pinochet, and the violent overthrow of Chile's democratically elected President Salvador Allende's Popular Unity Government in 1973. The U.S. government, and the CIA, assisted the Chilean military in the coup. This is a terrible tale of the torture and murder of innocents, and the personal, true story of one of them, U.S. citizen Charles Horman. Horman was a gentle, kind young man with a love of writing and the arts.
Charles and his wife Beth, movingly portrayed by Sissy Spacek, were living in Chile, as were many foreigners at that time, to learn about the new socialist coalition government that had come together under Allende. There was much excitement and idealism in the air. Horman, after witnessing US government military and CIA officials in Valparaiso, Chile, was driven back to Santiago by an American stranger, during the first hours of the coup. He disappeared shortly after his return home. Not one member of his family, or his friends saw him alive again.
Charles Horman's father, brilliantly played by Jack Lemmon, traveled to Santiago immediately, and he and Beth began a long, terrifying and unrewarding search for the disappeared young man. Mr. Horman was very conservative politically, and disapproved of Charles' and Beth's move to Chile. He was a patriotic American who believed that the US government would certainly help him find his son. He slowly began to acknowledge the truth, with Beth leading the way, about the US Embassy's cover-ups and lies. The American foreign service personnel, and US Ambassador, obviously knew the whereabouts and fate of his son, and her husband, and that of many of their disappeared friends.
This is a political drama of the first order. The poignancy and sadness of the lives lost, and the terrible military dictatorship that replaced a democracy, in a country known for its stable, democratic government, is portrayed realistically, in a docu-drama style. The acting is superb. The screen play certainly deserved the Oscar it received.
Whatever your politics, the events portrayed in this film did occur. There is much food for thought in this powerful film.

The military's absolute control over the fate of many innocent civilians, produced a terrifying feeling. The atmosphere of the coup was handled with great care by the director.
Jack Lemmon's performance as Horman's conservative father was truly convincing and Sissy Spacek was equally brilliant. The changes that occurred in the relationship between the two characters as the plot developed, added great depth to the issues the movie was considering.
""Missing"" is one of the most important moves made of this genre and is a must see for anyone wishing to understand the politics of this region.",1026604800,2,1002,5.191358024691358
216314,3,6300182738,"This movie, although with a left-wing leaning, is a good account of Chilean recent history.
  However I didn't like how it showed that high class chilean were with the militars and the poor were not.
  Pinochet got 44 percent of the votes in his referendum after 17 years in power. The party of his supporters is today the biggest party in Chile, taking it away from the Christian Democrats. And if all those supporters were rich, it would make Chile one of the richest countries in the world.
  Second, I don't like how the movie shows the U-S practically did everything in the coup. That is just none-sense. The reason why Allende was overthrown is because Chileans wanted him out. That doesn't mean they agree with Pinochet politics. But Pinochet's sins should not make us forget about Allende's ones.
The U-S has not been able to remove Castro from power, although Cuba is much smaller country, with a far less prepared Military Force than Chile. So just thinking that the US moves a finger and Allende goes down is stupid.
  Finally, I just loved when the father of Horman asks a Chilean man who was released from detention why are those people killed or arrested without any judicial records. The underline suggests that in America things like that don't happen. Yeah right, tell that to the Kennedy Brothers, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, and a long list of people. Americans are so Naive sometimes.
  Anyway, overall a Good movie. An a decent account especially considering the lefty tendencies of Costas-Gavras.",1026000000,9,1521,4.815384615384615
216315,4,6300182738,"Wasn't Kissinger and Nixon in power in the USA in September of 1973? This is a true story? Well that means that Kissinger really is a war criminal! Well let me see, the coup in Chile occured in September,1973. This movie says the americans were behind the coup. Charles Horman was murdered by those responsible for the coup. So that means the american government murdered one of its own citizens because he was a leftist. By the way Jack Lemmon plays the father of Charles Horman in this movie and Sissy Spacek plays the wife of the murdered american Golly,what a depressing movie!",1011657600,,581,4.650485436893204
216316,4,6300182738,"Greek director Costa-Gavras has made a specialty of selecting film projects with controversial political themes.  Yves Montand starred in the highly acclaimed Gavras film ""Z"" about the takeover of Greece by a group of colonels in the nation where democracy began.  Jack Lemmon and Sissy Spacek star in the 1982 film ""Missing,"" which won the Gold Palm Award at the Cannes Film Festival and secured an Oscar for Costa-Gavras and Donald E. Stewart for Best Adapted Screenplay.
""Missing"" has renewed significance now, twenty years after it was released,with increasing concern about General Auguste Pinochet, the Chilean strongman who came to power in a bloody coup in which the nation's elected president, Salvador Allende, was killed.  Recent efforts have been ongoing to try Pinochet as a war criminal, initially in Britain, and now in Chile.  Just last year the widow of the young American slain in the film filed a civil suit against Pinochet, while during the period of the movie's initial release the U.S. Ambassador to Chile at the time of the coup filed a suit in connection with the film.  Certain investigative efforts have linked the Central Intelligence Agency and International Telephone and Telegraph to the coup.  Meanwhile the Belgian government, which has investigated activities surrounding the coup, is seeking to talk to former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
Jack Lemmon plays the role of a New York City man who is conservative politically and a teetotaling practitioner of Christian Science.  His liberal, free-spirited son, who is seeking a career as a writer, has stopped in Chile while on tour of South America with his equally free-spirited wife, Sissy Spacek.  The timing could hardly have been worse from a danger standpoint in that the coup is taking place which brings Pinochet and his military regime to power.  When the young man disappears after his residence in Santiago has been ransacked, Jack Lemmon flies there to launch a search for his missing son.  Spacek, with whom he clashes, holds deep suspicions about the American foreign service personnel who purport to be assisting her.  At first Lemmon reprimands her for her rudeness to the Americans, but eventually sees things her way.  After his son's body has been discovered, Lemmon's last act before leaving Santiago with Spacek is to threaten a lawsuit against the American Ambassador to Chile and his subordinates.
The ""odd couple"" aspect of Lemmon and Spacek as individuals who become kindred spirits due to the shared goal of learning what happened to a son and husband in the face of differing political and social viewpoints give the movie a compelling dramatic dimension.  The conflict between them and the American foreign service personnel is also handled with just the right dramatic touch, with the bitterness and distrust sometimes internalized rather than exploding on screen.  This gives the movie periodic subtlety to go along with the explosive moments when Lemmon and Spacek lose all patience with those who ostensibly claim to be helping them.",1010448000,3,3059,5.165991902834008
216317,5,6300182738,"Based on the true story of Charles Horman,a young American journalist who mysteriously vanished during Chile's 1973 coup and was later found dead, MISSING is an extremely well-constructed political drama--the first American film from Greek director Costa-Gavras (Z, STATE OF SIEGE).
John Shea portrays Charles Horman, who, while covering Chile with a friend (Melanie Mayron), disappears from view, causing his wife (Sissy Spacek) to ask for help from Shea's staunch ""my country right or wrong"" father Ed (Jack Lemmon).  Lemmon openly disapproves of Shea's and Spacek's political views and staunchly supports the preservation of the American way of life.  Unfortunately, his rose-colored view of his country slowly but surely come apart as he and Spacek, who are initially at considerable odds, unravel bit by bit important details.  As one Chilean informant tells them, Shea disappeared because ""he knew too much.""  He knew that thousands of innocent people were being murdered by the new Chilean government, a staunch right-wing one that ousted a far more Marxist regime led by Salvador Allende.
Eventually, MISSING comes to a point of increased sadness and anger, as Lemmon comes to realize that not only was Shea killed (in the national soccer stadium), but that his own government probably had a hand in doing it.  The unfolding tragedy brings Lemmon and Spacek together in the end.
A very poignant and highly dramatic story, with a fine score by Vangelis, MISSING also boasts typically top-of-the-line performances by Lemmon and Spacek, who have never been anything less than watchable.  The script by Costa-Gavras and Donald Stewart (the latter of whom would do the adaptations of three Tom Clancy novels in the 1990s), won a richly-deserved Oscar for adapted screenplay (from Thomas Hauser's similarly-titled novel).
As to the previous reviewer's attack on the film as left-wing propaganda, I honorably but strongly disagree with that notion.
The facts have shown that the U.S. government supported the coup against Allende only because he believed in communism, but the regime that came to power then systematically trampled over the basic human rights of its people.  And here, it very well may have contributed to the death of a young American--and the U.S. government turned its back on that man!  No government anywhere in the world, anti-communist or otherwise, is worth American support if it ignores human rights.  THAT is the political arguement clearly at the heart of this excellent 1982 drama.",1006214400,147,2512,5.275689223057644
216318,1,6300182738,"The film's director's Father was a Greek communist who was booted out of Greece with his red brothers when the Greeks settled that issue once and for all. This movie is blatantly sympathetic to the communist movement that was so ruthlessly put down by Pinochet in Chile. So to appeal to an American audience, the director tries his best to make the us feel sorry for this nave American Harvard grad because he was arrested and executed by Pinochet's government for overtly aiding the Chilean communists through his little red attic newspaper. And what's worse, the film makes the ridiculous assertation that the US government gave the green light for our little red friend's exectution.
The problem is, the kid's death was nobody's fault but his own. He was a typical spoiled, rich, 60s-70s, lefty radical from the U.S. who became enamored with the romantic ideals of communism and gave his life, quite literally, trying to support it. He thought he could spit in the face of the man with the gun while chanting ""Nana Nana Na Na, you can't touch me."" Well that may work here in the U.S., but when you do that in a rightwing military dictatorship where they don't have Habeas Corpus, a Bill of Rights, etc., you are asking to get killed, and that's exactly what he got. And who do they maker's of this movie blame, the kid? No! The U.S. government! Unwittingly, the director refuted his own nonsensical theme when he put the only intelligent line in the whole movie in the mouth of the ""evil"" state department official when he explained that someone who went to New York to challenge the Mafia would be stupid to expect the government to prevent him from getting killed. Exactly.
And incidentally, when in power, the communists that the makers of this film sympathize with, who were backed by the Soviet Empire, are every bit as brutal and thuggish as the right wing dictatorships we backed. Any left wing sympathizer would do well to realize, that by backing the rightwing dictatorships, we kept the Soviets out of Central and South America, and if you don't think the countries are better off for it, take a look at the newly released records of the Stasie, and the Gulag.",1005523200,21,2173,4.706036745406824

It is a striking look at just what the American government may have been up to to try and protect its own interests.
