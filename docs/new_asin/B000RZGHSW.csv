2876890,4,B000RZGHSW,prior to this purchase i was simply looking for the title Bringing Out The Dead. then i came across this triple feature package. all movies are pretty slim as far as extra features are concerned. however these are 3 strong movies. usually with these triple feature things there is one good movie and two bad ones. so i recomend this purchase only if you don't have any of the titles. nicholas cage in three movies by three of hollywoods best directors. well maybe one of the best directors and 2 that use to be in that consideration. Bringing out the dead is in my opinion the most underated Martin Scorsese picture ill give it 4/5. the other two are good movies but just not as good they get 3/5 starts respectively.,1244937600,,717,4.480916030534351
8203209,4,B000RZGHSW,"A 3 disc set. One of Nicolas Cage's best movies is included here. Face/Off is the best of the three. This thriller is among the best of all time acclaimed by critics too. Snake Eyes is another thriller. Here, Cage plays the good guy. One of the things I like about Nicolas cage is that he can dominate both opposite roles: the good guy or the bad guy (like in Face/Off). Not many actors can master both roles. Finally, is Bringing out the Dead. Another thriller where he plays a paramedic. A good movie too. This triple feature is full with action and twisted turns. I highly recommend. All 3 movies are in widescreen format 2.35:1. Snake Eyes has NO subtitles or captions and can be watched in English or French. Face/Off has English and Spanish subtitles and the audio options are English or French. Bringing out the Dead is only in English with optional English subtitles.",1488758400,2,875,4.579617834394904

8203215,4,B000RZGHSW,"If you love Nic Cage movies, this is totally for you. ""Face/Off"" is a brilliantly stupid, but highly entertaining movie. ""Snake Eyes"" is not great, but Cage's chewing of the scenery makes it worth watching. ""Bringing Out the Dead"" shows that Cage is a great actor, even though he does bad movies every once in a while.",1384128000,,318,4.5964912280701755

8203218,5,B000RZGHSW,"This was the perfect buy for me becuase I had already seen both ""Face Off"" and ""Snake Eyes"", and I was willing to take a chance for yet another Nicolas Cage film that was nicely included in the price.

But maybe I'm more of an action film kinda guy after all, because even though I somehow managed to get all the way through ""Cast Away"" (the film with Tom Hanks stuck on some island somewhere) I couldn't make it all the way through the third film in this Triple pack, ""Bringing Out the Dead"". Perhaps too many video games in my youth have shrunken my attention span...

With that in mind, I'd still give this Triple Feature pack 5 out of 5 stars becuase I was able to get 2 great action films starring Nicolas Cage for under $6!",1251590400,2,729,4.237410071942446
