6246263,5,B00I0N6TNG,Nice DVD of what appears to be a performance by JT and his band on German TV in 1986.  The camera work is done by a pro so it is nicely done.  The sound is on a level of a typical tV performance.  Overall I enjoyed it.,1404172800,3,218,3.595744680851064

8638074,1,B00I0N6TNG,"Very deceptive packaging, showing early 1970s JT, when the DVD was actually middle-aged balding JT. The back cover showed him even older, so whomever designed it was totally messed up. My daughter likes it, so it wasn't a total loss. Recorded in 1986.",1427068800,,251,4.8604651162790695

8638079,5,B00I0N6TNG,"I have all 9 of JT's concert videos, only 5 or 6 are still available, and this one is good as it shows one version of his band that didn't get as much credit as it deserved. This is a TV special from Germany in the mid '80s. I already had the CD version of this, and had seen the concert tour live that year. Nice DVD. The picture quality is good, not great-consider it's TV. But it's fine. I watch a lot of Blu-Ray, and I was happy w/the quality of this video. The sound is good, not great, as well. Consider 1980's technology vs. New DVDs today. But for true JT lovers and musicians who truly appreciate him, this is a good addition to your collection. I've seen JT 26 times all over the country in the past 35 yrs. Have met him and some of his band members. I now go occasionally to his shows for the album cuts, while still enjoying the hits. Since I have every album he's recorded, I'm pretty much the source for my friends and music buddies who want to know about certain JT songs, and albums/CDs. So, considering all of the above, I enjoyed this DVD, and will watch it from time to time. The backround singers on this show are Arnold McCuller-of course, and the lesser known-in JT's bands-Rosemary Butler. The combo of these two is lovely, and JT usually has 3 or 4 backround singers. Arnold and Rosemary hold their own in comparison to any of JT's backup configurations. This DVD, for reference, came out around the time of the ""That's Why I'm Here"" album; which had the hit: ""Everyday"", a Buddy Holly cover. JT is not only a great songwriter, he is a great song interpreter. You can hear this quality of his talent in this DVD. I only wish the US would make TV shows like this w/people like JT. That's no reflection on this DVD-it's terrific. JT fans, enjoy!",1406419200,11,1767,4.3093093093093096
