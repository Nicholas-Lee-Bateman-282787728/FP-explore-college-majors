8167529,5,B000MAO2OI,"I think Ive seen that this has been somewhat updated in the last several years without guitarist Pearce, which is probably a bit of a mistake. Obviously he brings a certain level of precision in his playing style - that's well-documented. But what makes this DVD stand out for me, is the approach that Pearce takes to what he and his instrument's place are within the context of worship. His somewhat brief, but perfectly articulated comments about ""texturing"", ""layering"", ""ambience"" - and most importantly, his insistence that less is sometimes MORE in the context of guitar driven worship music - make this DVD a must for every narcissistic/preening/grandstanding guitar player you may have in your music team at church. Pearce says things here, in his own quiet and reflective way, that you might not want or even know to say to your guitar player yourself.
One side note is that Glenn's playing is so technically clean, fast (at times) and proficient/efficient that the parts that he plays would be somewhat far beyond the reach perhaps of an average weekend guitarist on your Praise and Worship team. I thought Paul Baloche does a nice job here of sort of slowing it down, and explaining what Pearce just demonstrated.",1355616000,3,1224,4.917874396135265
