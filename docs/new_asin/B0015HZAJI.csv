8258488,4,B0015HZAJI,"Ain't Misbehavin' is an engaging romp through wartime Britain. Robson Green and Jerome Flynn are brilliant in their understated approach to comedy, and co-writers Bob Larbey and Norman Stone coax the story along with a light touch. Stone also directed, and lots of period detail lends authenticity. My favorite recurring chuckle is when Dolly Nightingale writes her address on Eddie's forehead, and that is how he appears in future scenes, with poor Eddie unaware that the address is still clearly visible. Look for familiar faces Jerome Flynn (A Summer Story), Julia Sawalha (Lark Rise to Candleford), and Jim Carter (Downton Abbey), among others. This series is quirky and definitely worth watching.",1358035200,,701,5.324324324324325
8258489,5,B0015HZAJI,The set up on the two disks is a bit confusing so we missed the second part on the first disk and didn't realize something was missing until we started watching the second disk.  Why they had to use two disks for this movie is beyond me but we enjoyed the movie anyway.  Wonderful music in it too.,1351641600,3,297,4.103448275862069
8258490,5,B0015HZAJI,"Anyone who loves Robson Green will thoroughly enjoy this production. He's young,incorrigible, and very Robson. The music is terrific and the whole cast is right on the money. Lots of unique characters, entertaining story and great chemestry with Jerome. This is a movie that deserves watching and rewatching - so I had to own it.",1290643200,6,329,5.0
8258491,4,B0015HZAJI,"As a fan of Robson Green, I had to add this DVD to my collection.  It is a light fun filled movie showing the great chemistry between Jerome and Robson.  The Brits seem to know how to tell a story much better than Hollywood. Comedy with lots of fun characters and you can see the cast is having fun making this film.",1259712000,9,316,4.080645161290323
