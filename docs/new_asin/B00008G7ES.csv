1843733,5,B00008G7ES,"If you've watched Berserk thus far, picking up this last installment is worth it. It tells of the character's last stand and how it will ultimately end. --->
The thing that confuses most people is the order of the episodes. The -first- episode is actually the last one. The ones following are all flashbacks. So after you watch the last ep on this disk, expect the first episode to follow. I dunno why the creator has the episodes follow this pattern, but it does make you wonder.
In the first ep, you see this scary monster named Griffith who Guts has to defeat. But in the second, you see Griffith again, but not as a monster, but as a skilled swordsman, leader of the Band of Hawks. You're wondering...what?? It's a journey through the DVD's to find out how and why he became this, seeing as though he's nice and caring.
I've never read the manga, but it's suppose to give you more insight after these episodes, but even without, the storyline is great and shouldn't be missed!",1053734400,2,980,4.51123595505618
1843734,5,B00008G7ES,"Ever since I first laid eyes on this series, I have been addicted. The animation is good, the story line is driven, and you are easily immersed into the personnalities of the main characters. There are awesome action scenes... and the plot is built up and excecuted nicely. The other great thing about this series (for the most part) is the dialogue. Many anime series... even most of the good ones jst have too many useless comments and senseless conversations between characters. This series has a little of that... but for the most part the dialogue is cut and clear. If you like anime and medeival sword play - this is the series for you.",1053388800,2,642,4.591304347826087
1843735,4,B00008G7ES,"Berserk was a good series the whole way through.  It was not perfect but it is definately worth owning.  I would highly recommend this for any mature audiences.
As the series enters into the end of its last story arc, Griffith's fate draws near.  He must make the ultimate sacrifice in order for one last chance to achieve his dreams.  Guts, Caska, and the rest of the band of the hawk then must fight for there very right to exist.
The only complaint I have is this series has absolutely no ending at all.  The skull night was supposed to save Guts and CaskA from Griffith, yet the skull night's character was cut out of the series.  So, rather then force an ending, they simply leave Guts and Caska being torn apart and raped by demons at Griffith's command.  It was a poor choice of an ending.",1053216000,6,796,4.374149659863946
1843736,1,B00008G7ES,"Ok, suprisingly many people liked these episodes, I surely did not.
Now first it should be noted, that there is extremely much fully unnesescary blood and gore, and killing seems to happen for no particular reason. Even though there are a few good things happening now, its not enough.
The animation: Many still shots are used during fighting, and though the animation flows nicely, the actual drawings aren't the best ever, I'd give it a 4/5.
Now, if I were rating the entire anime, I would give it about 3 stars (mostly because the beginning is horribly bad), if i were rating the middle of it, i'd give it 4, however now I'm rating the last part of it. The reason I'm giving it 1 star, is because of the ending, pure and simple. Now I have nothing against unresolved endings, that leave you hanging a bit, without all the answers... however this story dosn't even do that, it just ends, without actually ending the story. You would get the same feeling as if it would have ended at any other episode, the ""uh, did I really get all the episodes?"" kind of feeling. I cannot say how dissapointed I am...
It seems they made the mistake of thinking that they could animate the entire 24 chapters of it, into 25 episodes... however they only got up to around 13, and since the manga is still going, you get the idea of how unfinished the ending is...",1050796800,4,1347,4.4574898785425106
1843737,5,B00008G7ES,"Some people say that this is for babies, kids, and everyone....that is NOT the case. This is definetly not something for children to be watching. With that said....
Berserk is a fantastic MANGA (noticed I did not say anime) that has been going on since 1989. The anime that you can purchase, is actually volumes 3-13 in the Manga. The anime is great and does a good job following the manga for the most part. The only thing that is a let down is that they never finished animating this manga. Currently the manga is up to volume 24 with 25 to be relaesed this fall hopefully.
If you liked the other discs, then you will want to pick this up. Just be warned that the series ends on a huge cliff hanger that is not resolved unless you start reading the manga (which btw just got licensed by dark horse comics and we should see the first installments this fall).
Now for those that have no idea what this story is about...The series follows Guts(Gatts whatever) who was born to a corpse and was found by a band of mercenaries that raised him. The anime starts in the present, but after the first episode moves into the past and you get to see what turned Guts into the crazy monster slaying maniac he is today. Its a fanatstic story, but just be forwarned, you'll be looking for manga scans very soon =)",1049932800,4,1300,4.3539094650205765
1843738,5,B00008G7ES,"In short this is one of the best DVD's that will come out (I downloaded fan-subbed versions of them off Kazaa).  The story progression finally gets a little quicker here which adds to the tension as the story progresses.  The gore in this one reminds me of the first DVD where there was a lot, but not too much.  I don't want to get into the actual plot but I will outline it quickly.
*Partial Spoiler Ahead*
After the ball where Griffith *dies* the castle explodes into fire where the queen and a few other of the aristocrats are killed.  Basically from there Griffith is thrown into a dungeon because of something he does and Guts comes back to find Caska in charge of the hawks and they try to bust him out.  Eventually it all ties back to the first episodes.
Overall the animation and sound are as great as they always are.",1049846400,,827,4.3441558441558445
1843739,5,B00008G7ES,"If you like blood, this is for you.  There's this splashing array of blood as the Behlit is summoned, and GOD HAND comes out and demons are everywhere, and the 4 Gods, demons, angels....whatever they happen to be, and everyone is getting killed, and there's these skulls.  Oh yeah, and there's this snow episode, and it has the absolute best sword battle ever(before Gatts leaves), and it only last a few seconds, but it is awsome.  Anyway this DVD is for babies, kids, and adults, a real must see for every one.",1049155200,,512,4.543478260869565
1843769,5,B00008G7ES,"The ending in Berserk has been the subject of much controversy for those who have seen it. Most people seem to dislike it, and there hasn't been a better example of a love it or hate it situation than this. The problem most people seem to have though, is that the ending doesn't leave a satisfying conclusion to the story, and while this aspect is somewhat true, people tend to overlook the excellence of this final volume because of this.

 After more than 20 episodes of beautiful character development, after seeing characters leave their dreams behind, find new ones, after seeing them evolve, the final episodes manage to present these characters at their peak. We get to see Guts in all his fury, Caska at her weakest, and Griffith in all his glory. Judeau in particular shines more in the last episodes than anywhere in the whole series. We see everyone struggle not just for their very lifes, but for the lifes of others, for the lifes of loved ones. And they try to survive against impossible odds.

 People get carried away with minor things, like ""Guts without his sword is nothing"" or ""Everyone dies a miserable death"", but they don't see the real importance of these episodes. Didn't Guts survive? Even without his sword? Didn't he fight? Didn't everyone fight? They did, and they did so with courage and passion, even though there was no hope at all.

 Compared to the average anime, which feature mostly teens and, for the most part, contain nothing but lots of girls on tiny dresses, Berserk stands out as one of the most strong and passionate series of them all. Be very warned though, this is for mature audiences only, not just because of the content, but because to truly appreciate it's greatness, you have to think things through.

 I guess some people get frustrated, and thus angry, because of the lack of a real conclusion in the series, but for the characters themselves, the end of such a long journey couldn't have been told in a better way.",1090886400,3,1969,4.670520231213873
1843770,3,B00008G7ES,"Berserk has bin favortie anime ever since I laid my eyes on it.
But comming to these last episodes I knew I was going to have a great time with these episodes....I was wrong.  Not Only are you left with a huge cliffhanger but It's so darn sad.
All the characters you've grown to love,Juedoe,Pipin,Corkus(yeah),and the hawks are killed one by one by Grotesque and some what messed up demons.  Just lookin' at em' they look messed up.
Sadly we also see why Guts needs his sword.  With out it he's no more then dead just like the rest of the Hawks.  This set Episodes may be the most Important of them all.
We also see our once loved Griffith turned into a Demon King by the Name of Femto.  Also the Hawks find out about Griffiths Dark Truth before he is morphed into the demon lord.  And the hawks find out that there the sacrifice.
This is also the Darkest chapter in the Berserk series.  It's probably the most violent of out of them all.  Not to mention we finally see how Guts ended losing his arm and eye.  Not a pretty site eather.
WARNING THOUGH!  IF YOU ARE EXPECTING A HAPPY LOVEY DUVIE ENDING DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DVD because this probably has one of the worst endings I've ever seen in the series.  Over all I still think Berserk is a great series.  God's hand is a must own for Die Hard Berserk fans.
Acctually it's not really and ending.  It's more a of a ""to be continued"" kinda thing.  I thought This Dvd was over all good but not the best, especially how it leaves lots of things out.
Now that I have finished this Magneficent series awhile ago I've started to read the Manga which far more superb then the anime.  Check it out.
Well That's all I have to say...and remember...This is not really an ending if you think about...And also when the credits are over you see one final last moment with Guts as he's walking away and as you can see this is after all the hell that he went through in ep 25 but the frustrating thing is ""how the hell did he get out alive""?...Well You're just going to have to find out for your self by reading the manga.
Later....",1088985600,,2068,4.253196930946292
1843771,4,B00008G7ES,"There have been plenty of mixed reviews here on the final episodes of the animated Berserk. The ending is definitely one that makes it hard to really recommend to anyone who isn't a well developed anime fan or a serious fan of the Berserk series.
Warning: Possible spoilers ahead.
The final episodes of the series really is the bloodiest of the whole series. It brings Berserk to a very primal, instinctual sort of mood. It is in these final episodes that you really see Guts/Gatsu become more of a person than an uninspired warrior. His realization and confession of love for Caska brings in him his first real vulnerability that anyone can understand.
In the last few minutes, we finally few a deep, heartfelt connection to Guts/Gatsu as despite desperate sacrifice, he cannot save the woman he loves. We learn that he cuts off his own arm in an attempt to rescue Caska but without major success. You see his insurmountable torment as he is held back, unable to prevent her rape.
It's an ending that isn't for anyone looking for a happily-ever-after. It's not one for someone who was looking for a true consummation of their love. But it is powerful, primal, and is one of the best paths of character development I've seen to date, in any movie or anime.",1086912000,,1256,4.662162162162162
1843772,5,B00008G7ES,"Even though I can understand why some people were put off by the open-ended conclusion of this series, I think the creators did an excellent job in bringing the story full circle. I am aware that the manga is more extensive and has more characters, but the story told in the anime has logic in itself and can be enjoyed nonetheless. In this set of episodes we finally find the answers to several questions that we have posed ourselves through the previous installments: What is the Egg of the King and what is its role? How does the first episode in the series tie up with the rest of the story? What is the involvement of the demons we find in some of the episodes and what is their relationship with the rest of the characters?
Guts, Caska and several other members of the Band of Hawks set out to rescue Griffith, who has been held in the castle as a prisoner and tortured extensively for several years. Guts is feeling extremely guilty thinking that Griffith was captured and broken because he could not go on after Guts deserted him. The events that unfold from this point on generate confusion and unrest in the members of the Hawks, with Guts and Caska finding solace on each other and deepening their relationship. Still, Caska is torn between following Guts or staying and trying to help Griffith.
From this point forward, the events unfold at great speed, with the demons finally entering the story full force, and the Band of the Hawks facing their destiny. Now I think the next step for me is to wait for the complete manga to be released in the US so I can follow the continuation of this story. I am fully satisfied with this series and it would be great if a second season were produced at some point. One final word of advice, when the last episode finishes and the titles come up, keep watching! There is an extra scene after the titles that is worth seeing.",1085961600,,1875,4.469387755102041
1843773,5,B00008G7ES,"Well, there are enough reviews of this DVD as of now but I just wanted to say that this is the most shocking/unexpected/weird ending to any anime or movie I've ever seen.  Unfortunately I ruined the experience by going to websites after watching the 5th DVD, ""Requited Desires"" to get information on what was coming next because when I saw it volume 6 hadn't been released yet.  But anyways, I went to Skullknight.net (my favorite Berserk web site and perhaps the only one that is still running) and found out that volume 6 would be the last release.  I was very disappointed and wondered what was going to happen to end the series in a mere 4 episodes.
  I don't want to ruin the ending for those of you who've haven't seen the conclusion to this magnificent series but I will say, like many other reviewers, that I loved this series but the ending most likely will disappoint you.  Therefore, I would recommend that you watch the first episode over again after seeing the last, or if you can't get enough of the series go to (I may not have the website right but you'll find it.) TheHawks.org and you can download scanlations of the volumes up to 26 or so.  Also, you should buy the manga in english from Dark Horse if you don't like to download (or you could just email me at JRSSpyBoy@aol.com with the subject ""Berserk"" and i'll send you five or six pages of what happens right after the end of the anime.)  Lastly, you should go to skullknight.net and read the translations there because they are much more accurate than the Hawks translations.

1843774,2,B00008G7ES,"After going through all the previous eps. of beserk. i am very disapointed with the ending. it was nothing short of a hentaiesque finale. (""holy overfiend batman"") poor casca. anyway the series was a letdown, i was expecting a lot more especially since the dreamcast game (which they should have based the plot on, instead of some prequel) was so f*cking cool. one thing i hate about epidsodic anime i.e. evangelion,noir,gasaraki. is that it drags on and on. until the near ending when things suddenly start to pick up. it may be fun for most otakus, but to me it's a disturbing trend.",1077235200,2,585,4.689320388349515
1843775,4,B00008G7ES,"Well, I have finished the ""Berserk"" series, and it was quite a journey.  I'm a little saddened that this series really has no concrete conclusion and leaves the viewers hanging, possibly because this is only the beginning of the story.  If I had known that from the beginning, it would've made the last two episodes a little better for me.  Still, I'm overall pretty pleased with this dark and violent epic and hope that the series will continue on.  ""Berserk 6: God's Hand"" is the conclusion to this first series, but not to the story.
Guts and The Band of the Hawk stage a rescue to recover a very beaten and tattered Griffith from the kingdom's dungeon.  He has lost his sanity and his mind as he has completely given himself into the darkness.  It is here after they rescue him that the true horrific fate of Griffith comes to light as The Great Eclipse is present.  All hope and all that once was seems to end in the last two episodes.  This saga in whole reveals the story of how Guts came to be, but has only touched the surface of his ultimate quest and purpose.
I really enjoyed watching the series and am glad that I invested my time into it.  However, I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't a tad disappointed with the conclusion.  The ending felt more like a teaser to me than anything else.  I know now that I will definitely invest my time should a second series (and there better be with the way things ended) be released.  It's still an amazing anime epic that ventures into bloodshed and darkness.
This anime series is in no way intended for younger viewers, especially these last four episodes.  They contain strong and brutal violence, extreme blood and gore, nudity, a brief scene of rape, nudity, language, and dark and disturbing themes and imagery.  Extras included are trailers, outtakes, a TV spot and more.
In no way am I disappointed with ""Berserk"" as a whole, but it is sad to see that there is no concrete ending for this first series.  ""Berserk 6: God's Hand"" tends to leave more questions than answers, but it is still necessary to the series.  These 25 episodes have been quite the journey.  Just be willing to accept that you're not going to get an open-and-shut ending--and whatever you do, do not expect a happy ending.  Then again, maybe this was suspected all along.  Still a very exciting and intense saga that was time well spent.",1074211200,6,2367,4.514084507042254
1843776,4,B00008G7ES,"I love this anime, I'm not saying it's the best but it is definitely good. I'm hoping there's a second season because this one just leaves you off. This season showed how Guts met Caska and Griffith, how Guts lost he's arm and how Griffith became the way he is. This isn't the end of the line for Berserk, We haven't seen Guts fight anyone with he's huge sword and hand cannon yet, except for the 1st episode.
All in all, this would make a great collection. It's story is skill full, the animation is exceptional and the voice acting is normal. I gave this anime 4 stars because of how it always leaves you off, especially the sad and grotesque ending were Caska gets raped and Guts looses he's arm and eye. He's suppose to either go berserk and save Caska and escape or the Black Knight comes and saves them, either way, it doesn't show you what happens and that will piss alot of people off.
Order it all today and Enjoy",1070409600,,922,4.304597701149425
1843777,5,B00008G7ES,this dvd ends what was to be the end of season one of an anime series.  but too bad it was not run again on Tv. because of the violence and adult content. It was played late at night and didn't attract enough watches at that late night time. The story line is great in the early episodes but the ending explains alot but also leaves it open as if the was other seasons planned.  None the less if you like anime you will love this series. I believe it is one of the all time greats.,1066521600,,481,3.948453608247423
1843800,5,B00008G7ES,"Highly anticipated, highly gory, and completely unexpected ending to quite possibly one of the best animes of all time.  The first time I watched the ending, I went into a week of doubting, confusion, and depression.  Luckily, I had (and still have) a very close friend that made me rewatch the first episode, which brings the series full circle.
I've watched the series now 5 times, and I have just now learned that there is additional material after the closing credits from the final episode.  If you have enjoyed the series thus far, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND READING THE MANGA.  The manga is still being written, has more characters, and has a deeper, even more intense story line.",1066003200,2,679,4.777777777777778
1843801,5,B00008G7ES,People say this series ends on a clifhanger wich it does but if you look  on the cover of dvd 6 god hands u will notice that guts is holding casca. He went berserk. wich means that he broke free from the demonds with her and escaped from hell. SO if u are wondering what hapens to casca she is saved. this series is truely one of the greates animes out there.( In the manga skeleton knight saves them but we don't know if he does in the anime but all we know is casca and guts are still alive.),1060473600,,494,3.94
1843802,5,B00008G7ES,"One of the most amazing things about this series in general is that nothing is black and white; Berserk is an addicting look into the beautiful, brutal grey. The primary story arc follows the life and adventures of Guts, in an extended flashback that begins with Episode 2 and eventually comes full circle, leading the viewer back to the events in Episode 1. (The first couple episodes may be a bit confusing, but by the end of the series, everything makes sense.) Though Guts is the ""hero"" of the story, his actions aren't always good - the assassination that leads to the death of the victim's young son as well, comes to mind - but this is the strength of the series: it doesn't shy away from the darker nature of humanity. As for the last DVD in the series, it could more accurately be called the conclusion of the first part of a much larger story; make no mistake, Guts' story is only just beginning at the end of God's Hands. Many reviewers have written that they felt ""cheated"" and ""disappointed"" by the final two episodes of this series. My question to them is why? No, the last two episodes don't tie up every little loose end, but they're not supposed to. They're only supposed to end this part of the story, which they did admirably. Granted, part of me really would've liked to see Guts and Caska get their ""happily ever after"" ending, but could any one really see that happening and still be true to the overall story of Berserk? Their love (though the word ""love"" is never used by them, it's in every action and look they share) is made even more poignant because they faught so long and hard to realize it, yet it lasted so briefly. The only real complaint I have is, what became of Caska and how did Guts escape the ""Hell"" he was trapped in? In this sense, the final episode feels a little rushed, but it doesn't distract too much from the overall brilliance of this series. I won't go so far as to say it's the best series there is, but it is *one* of the better ones ever made and close to top in its genre.",1058400000,6,2026,4.362433862433862
1843803,5,B00008G7ES,"Before i bought this dvd i read most of the reviews, and frankly i was a little afraid of the levels of violence that this dvd might have. Well i believe now that this was  the best dvd in the series , and that berserk trully dethrowns record of lodoss war as the best fantasy series in anime. Lets now move on to the violence ,sure it had a lot more gore than the rest of the show ,but the most frightening aspect was Griffiths fall. We all remember Griffith as the man who led the Hawks from victory to victory , as a superb swordsman and a man who had captivated all of midland with his charisma. But now all that is gone , all that is left is a broken body , whose future only holds living alone with Casca as an invalid. Is it any wonder then that he chose to become a demon instead and rule over Midland exacting a terrible revenge on those who caused him so much suffering;
This is not the Griffith we once knew , and now he has no problem whatsoever to kill even his friends and comrades so that he can be healed. We watch as his comrades are sacrificed one by one , by demons (which incidentally aren't as horrifying as i thought before i saw them).Sure they fight valiantly , but even Guts has no hope against them now.
This dvd also has some extra features which should not be missed by any Berserk fan. I enjoyed painting Berserk very much and the full forces video clip was trully excellent.
The show promises a hell(really) of a follow up and i hope to see it.",1056585600,,1474,4.13588850174216
1843804,3,B00008G7ES,"Having never read the originating manga for this series, I can only rate this DVD against previous ones.  This series, up to this point, was outstanding.  The interplay of characters and the discussions about dreams and their influence on lives is amazing.  Beyond the mere swordplay and violence, this series carried with it the soul of a profound and wonderful story.  However, this all changed in this volume.
I gave this DVD 3 stars because the first 2 episodes continue the engaging story of Guts and the Hawks, but the last 2 episodes all but destroy the series in my opinion.  The hints of magic and the supernatural have been very slim in the earlier volumes, and they help to pull the viewer in.  They all but promise a very interesting turn of events in the near future.  Unfortunately, this turn is pulled off in a very poor fashion that doesn't live up to the rest of the series.
These last 2 episodes butcher a wonderful story, and the last left me with a feeling of betrayal.  It is almost as if the creators couldn't think of a way to neatly end the series.  Without giving anything away, I will say that this ranks up there with the last episode of the Evangelion series as one of my worst all time let downs.  I wasn't expecting some cataclysmic battle to end all battles, just something that lived up to the rest of the series.  In this case, a cliff-hanger would have been infinitely more preferable.
As far as the DVD itself, there is no shortage of extras.  The normal outtakes are accompanied by an interesting painting video as well as several other short bits, and as always, there are previews for other series.  In my opinion, any fan of this series should see this DVD, if only to understand how good the rest of the series is.  This series could have been one of the greatest of all time, and though it is wonderful, its ending all but destroyed its beauty.",1056499200,2,1885,4.489736070381231
1843805,5,B00008G7ES,"The last dvd is much more gory than the previous episodes, and does sort of stray from the normal style.  This is such a great show, and it does get really wierd the last few episodes.  If you have already bought the other dvds it is worth buying, and it's just as great as the other dvds.  The ending of the show is left unended, however most people don't realize the entire show is based on a parallel manga in japan, and the manga is still going strong, as a matter of fact it's at least twice as far past where the show ended.  So it's definitely worth buying, and keeps (to the most part) a great storyline, though it does have graphic scenes and nudity.",1055980800,,659,4.2063492063492065
1843806,5,B00008G7ES,"It is difficult to write at all about this last set of episodes without giving away too much.  Hopefully the reader will forgive me if I veer too close.  Certainly, the series has been building to an apocalyptic ending, but the signs and indicators were in early episodes, and Director Takahashi has hidden them beneath layers of political infighting and battlefield mayhem.  Now, with the great eclipse in the offing, the real story returns with a vengeance.
The previous DVD closed with Griffith under the hand of a torturer and Guts and Caska plotting to free him so that the Hawks can return to their former glory.  They succeed, but it is a bitter victory.  They are too late.  The Griffith they bring back is a mad mind in a ruined body, bereft even of the ability to speak.  From there on, things fall apart.
But not in a blaze of glorious battle, as one might expect.  As the sun disappears in eclipse, a red dawn arises, greeting the coming of Griffith's true destiny with the sacrifice of everything he cared about.  A bleak and unresolved destiny created at the hands of the minions of hell.
The viewer should be warned that the end of the TV series does not represent the actual end of the 'Berserk' story line.  Takahashi determined to stop with the events of the eclipse out of a sense of timing.  Miura's manga series is still ongoing.  Given the surprise success of the series, there is hope for a follow up that will bring the story into its post-apocalyptic phase.
In a sense, 'Berserk' is every bit as much of an experiment as 'Lain' is.  The kind of content brought to the TV series is normally reserved for the OVA market, and the use of quality production values is outstanding.  One can look at this as simply a series that glorifies violence, or one that probes the inner psychology of the need for love and power.

1843807,3,B00008G7ES,This anime series had the potential of being one of the greatest but it ends just so badly. It doesnt seem they'll be making a follow up. When watching a series you shouldnt get the feeling that hmmmm was that it? Am i missing like 5 episodes!!! Up to the end i enjoyed the entire series good charachter development and plot. Except the series doesnt follow the same plot as the Mangna i mean where the hell is the skull knight? He never even shows up hes suppose to save Rickert and give Gatts the dragon slayer but it seems they seemed content with ending the series with Gatts having a clay in his eye and Caska getting rapped by demons i mean.... what the hell.,1055721600,3,665,4.285714285714286

The Manga is much more involved, and in the DVD they left out several characters. Another huge problem with the DVD is the way it ends. For the mangas, the entire DVD series is more like an introduction.",1055635200,,334,4.475409836065574

The story is amazing, and can capture anyone. I didn't understand the first one, until i saw this one(25),where everything crumbles. it twists everything around, turns anyone whos truly into the series world upside down. While its pretty much just a killing off of most of the chars, it is almost heartbreaking to see someone who you've fought battles with, or seen risk his life on the field for a friend(the immortal), or noticed the love that lasted through the series(kaska, guts[think he liked guts a little too much..] even that princess chick) crumble all in one epi. In the middle of the last video,i was left with my mouth hangin open just muttering words i cant say..I hope that the series produces more to better go into depth of the last.(the first one even left you hanging, and along with that the last previews don't match the first one). Anyways, if you want to see some wild [stuff] from a great anime,you should check this one out. But, i warn you to be ready for anything cause this one has it all. If you aren't ready, this very well could scare the hell out of you(i watched it around 5 am, in a cold damp house, with a weird sound coming from upstairs). In otherwords, like most Berserk titles, this isn't for the faint of heart

1843830,5,B00008G7ES,"Going by other posts, many people (including the amazon reviewer) were disappointed in the ending for the series.  I found it's over the top attitude beautifully disturbing.  After watching it i couldn't get some moments out of my mind.  I could think of no more powerful way for a demon king to be born or act.  He didn't start shouting ""I am Reborn!"" or ""My enemies will rue the day they...blah blah"".  He didn't say a word.  I found his silence far more chilling.  All compassion was melted away, and to those that compare what happened near the very end to Legend of the Overfiend or scenes in Wicked City. I couldn't say they were more wrong.  There was not lust or desire in his eyes at the end.  He only did what he did to hurt Guts.  That's who he was watching.
The only place that disappoint should be pointed at is the fact that the series ends here.  It doesn't seem likely to ever build off of these events.  That's the only thing that makes the horror of this betrayal and the potential lines of power from it, less than perfect.",1055376000,,1042,4.341968911917099
1843831,3,B00008G7ES,"5 stars? for this? this series, was butchered! incredibly important elements were changed from the manga, having a great effect on the story, yet no one complains.  The original story was brilliant, this animated series based on it is not.  Not only did they have the nerve to change things around, they only told half the story!
This series is great at times, but the story has several things that make no sense, such as the absence of Puck, the fairy that should have kept Gatsu company, was in the video game, manga, yet was cut from the series.  I've seen some people recommend the manga after the ending, but if you start from where this left off, you're bound to be confused by missing elements.
No one wanted to give this series five stars more than me, but I can't hide the disappoint, especially hearing that the animation studio that made this has no intentions of making a continuation to it, since they believe it's popularity has died down.  I'm not even going to mention the god awful way this series ends in it's animated form, everyone else has done that I've seen.  Bottom line is, I wouldn't like anime if the stories were always butchered from their original form, or if it left the viewers constantly on cliff hanger, except with this one, it's a permanent one.",1055030400,5,1281,4.576419213973799
1843832,5,B00008G7ES,"Berserk is likely one of the greatest animes ever created and has gained the deserved respect of many viewers across nations. The DVD series has gained the show a great amount of attention in America and has become a favorite among animes. The past DVDs in the series were fantastic and had tons of drama, adventure, fight sequences and messages about life. This DVD SUPPOSEDLY draws the series to its end.
This DVD presents the ending of the beloved anime series Berserk, yet the story comes short. It is extremely confusing and it can disturb you mentally. The ending is pointlessly violent, beyond belief violent and gory, making the other episodes seem PG rated. The other episodes did have violence yet it was simply sword throwing and slashing, but this episode has gore beyond belief with agonizing screams while people are being eaten alive...not for the young or sensitive.
I recommend this DVD to anyone who wishes to see the conclusion of the series, which is still confusing, yet a necessary to anyone who is a fan of Berserk. If I would have rated this DVD on story, it would probably have received 1/2 star, just because I was being kind for it being the conclusion to the series. The other episodes of the series are just so incredibly amazing, they make up for the poor story and nauseating violence on this DVD.",1054944000,,1328,4.703862660944206
1843833,5,B00008G7ES,"Berserk is truly amazing. There is a ton of emotion in the entire series, the animation and artwork are very fitting for the time period. The characters are extremely well developed (more so in the manga) and also, when you watch the show, just remember that it follows the story of Gatsu, not the rest of the Hawks. The ending is spectacular and is the ultimate cliffhanger that leaves you emotionally drained and weak. The creator Kentaro Miura had the whole thing planned out. It's not ""unfinished"" as some people say. There's this thing called storyboarding, where the whole series get's laid out before it begins production. :P Sometimes you also have to understand stories and how they work to truly experience a show or something like this - theme is a big part of a story. In berserk, the theme deals with fate, and how no one can escape their own fate, but they can try - gatsu
This is the best anime i have ever seen. The manga is even better, but the anime will definately get you started. The experience is better if u see the anime first. GO BUY THIS!!! NOW!!!",1054684800,,1073,4.507692307692308
1843834,5,B00008G7ES,"I'd assume that if you're thinking of picking up the final DVD of this series, you've already watched what's come before and can't wait for the conclusion.  So, I probably won't say much to change your mind at this point.  That said, if you want to find out that ultimate conclusion, you will have to also be willing to delve into the Berserk manga.  (Available here on Amazon....)
Now, about this DVD itself...it's tremendous.  Save for the ending which may disappoint some, this is an awe-inspiring cap to the anime.  Take everything great about this series: the characters, plot, darkness, action, everything and rest assured that this final set of episodes does all of those same things to perfection.  The entire DVD is probably the most stunning, visually memorable portrait of hell that I've ever witnessed, and provided you're mature enough to handle it, I'd heartily recommend checking it out.
Unfortunately, they decided to end this series pretty much in the midst of the action, and that can really put a bad taste in your mouth if you're expecting things to wrap up nicely.  Think of this as another chapter in Guts' saga rather than the end and you may enjoy it more.  You can put together a lot of the missing pieces by watching the first episode over again and making the connections, but that really isn't fair to yourself or this fantastic series.  Do yourself a favor and find a way to pick up the manga.  I love this entire series, and having just watched this final DVD, I absolutely will be purchasing the manga to find out the conclusion.
Despite the lack of a solid conclusion, I am awe-inspired by this DVD and happy to have purchased it.",1054252800,,1662,4.680412371134021
1843835,5,B00008G7ES,"While the Berserk series has been violent it has also been wuite calm in a number of episodes, until now.  Throughout the series we witnessed Guts first encounter the band of the Hawk, and then from there help them lead them while under the leadership of Griffin to many victorys.  In the time he also earned a reputation as the 100 man slayer and also gain to some degree some inner peace.  Until now.  This set of episodes is by far the most violent and disturbing chapter in the series.
It starts off with Guts, Caska, and other members of the band of the Hawk attempting to rescue Griffin who a year earlier raped the Princess after his crushing defeate to guts.  Griffin in that year was tortured worse than any man.  Guts and the group finally find him but not in the state that they remember.  As they try to escape the King sends his army to stop them.  From there Guts goes Berserk (no pun intended) as he easliy cuts through the armies like they are nothing.  However after they escape Griffin begins to realize his destiny and runs away from the band of the Hawk.  THey of course follow unaware of the horror that would soon ensue.  The pendant that Griffin had carried with him finally takes shape during the solar eclipse and his destiny is finally set as the leader of the armies of Hell.  In order for Griffin to become the leader however one last sacrafice needed to be made, the Band of the Hawk must die.
At this point the series goes into it;s most horrific state as many of the characters we grew to love throughout the series die very violently and the episodes ends with band dead, Guts pinned by a demon with more wounds than he has ever ensued and Caska being raped by Griffin.
Where the series leads from here I am not sure.  I got into the series through the DVD and in all honesty I have not read the Mangas.  However this DVD and it's episodes fall directly into the WTF catagory and also most disturbing episodes of the series.  Where this leads who knows but it is a must see if you have seen the entire series.",1054252800,,2041,4.33421052631579
1843836,2,B00008G7ES,"If you've enjoyed the series so far, and have grown rather fond of Gatsu and the band of Hawks, TURN AWAY NOW.  Pretend this last edition does not exist, the ending will make you regret you ever started watching this series.
Throughout the whole series you get used to having the main character Gatsu be downright invincible, but apparently he's nothing without his sword, because the moment he loses ahold of it, all he holds dear is defiled and taken away from him.  Heck I like violence as much as the next guy, but when you see characters you've grown fond of  being slaughtered in the WORST POSSIBLE WAY by demons, begging for help while being devoured alive....well...I for one was seriously disturbed. Adding insult to injury, Gatsu lives on, but you never see him avenge the deaths of all his friends, you just see him days later, all healed up, as he's leaving Godo's home, armed with the DragonSlayer (if he had that in that previous battle, this would have been a different review), ""don't get killed"" he's told by Godo...and that's it, you're left to continue the series by ordering the books.  I know I felt like throwing myself or someone out the window due to sheer frustruation. Still might.
This is just the middle of the actual series, and there's no sign of the rest being animated, so unless you want to start buying the books on it, or looking for it online thanks to the fans who scan the pages, turn away now.  You've been warned.",1054252800,11,1453,4.573076923076923

Unfortunately, it ends on a bit of a cliffhanger which is extremely maddening and upsetting (hence the rating).

There is a huge gap between the last two chronological episodes and no conclusion. I heard that the manga goes farther, but I never could get into reading manga. I really do like Berserk and recommend it to anime fans, but there is no ending and the price that I'm seeing for it is insane. Don't pay more than $20 for it.

7982820,5,B00008G7ES,"Berserk is, and forever will be, one of the darkest anime ever created. Blood is so common it may as well be considered a main character. The themes of the anime, killing, destruction, hatred, vengeance, torture, are no where else except maximum security prisons. And it's volume six that solidifies these themes so vividly.

In volume six, Guts and the remaining members of the Band of the Hawk make their way to the castle to rescue Griffith. But, upon finding him, or what's left of him, the once hopeful band is now distraught and leaderless, and talking about disbanding to seek their own separate ways of living. What they do not realize, however, is just how affected, and infected, Griffith has become. His own hunger for vengeance and hatred has twisted his mind to match his gnarled body, and he wants only to be let out of this world, one way or another. He finds his solution in the mysterious charm he wore for the entire series and calls upon four demonic creatures, all god-like in power, and their minions to solve his current problem.

What he asks of them is dreadful, and the final conclusion is as painful to watch as anything I've ever seen in any anime, or any other form of entertainment, to date. Murder and rape fill the final episode to bursting. For a long time, Guts was the anti-hero of the story, that savage killer we couldn't help but cheer for simply because he was the main character and the man we were forced to follow. By the end of this series, the old Guts looks like an angel compared to what Griffith becomes. In the last moments of the series, we see what is left of Guts (which can be seen in the beginning episode of the series) as he sets out to get revenge for all the companions and friends he lost.

This volume finally ties the itself to the first episode. In many ways, the entire series, from episode two to twenty-five, was simply a prequel to episode one. We are brought along with Guts in his early journey so that we know and understand what drives him, and how he attains the many scars he carries, both physically and mentally. We learn about the bleeding brand on his neck, and the significance of the charm both Griffith and the snake demon carry. Though difficult to watch at times, this is an excellent wrap up to the first season of one the best fantasy anime ever created.",1136937600,,2335,4.489411764705882
7982821,5,B00008G7ES,"I write this message to all of you who are curious about ""Berserk,"" the animated show, but are put off by the negative comments some Amazon reviewers have directed at the way the show ""ends."" This message is spoiler-free.

These reviewers rightfully criticize the ""ending,"" but for the wrong reason. They feel great disappointment because they have not yet figured out that episode 25 is not the conclusion to the story of ""Berserk."" Episode 25 is merely where the producers of the anime left off. Many of the rest of us, who know that episode 25 is not the ending, feel great disappointment, not because the ""ending"" is sloppy (actually, episode 25 is gripping and pleasingly depressing), but because the show is left unfinished. It is not by accident that these first 25 episodes are collectively called ""season 1.""

These 25 episodes that comprise season 1 are a unique, thoroughly mesmerizing pleasure, the specific flavor of which you will not find anywhere else (except in the on-going ""Berserk"" manga ;) ). In fact, you should be aware that after viewing all 25 episodes, you will feel mad with desperation due to the want to see what comes next. The show leaves off with a season ending cliff-hanger that is so compelling that it will rock and abuse your curiosity. But do not take this as a negative, for it is proof of how completely season 1 entertains.

Unfortunately, season 2 was not picked up by Japanese television--and apparently will never be. But to criticize any television show for leaving us at a cliff-hanger when the show was not given an opportunity to continue is wrong-headed in its unfairness. (And the mere fact that a show does not get picked up for subsequent seasons is not a reason in itself that proves that a show is unentertaining--it merely proves that the station that held the rights did not think the show was profitable.  Many instances have shown that critical acclaim and the ingenuity of a show is not necessarily related to a show's profitability.)

""Berserk"" is a Japanese television cartoon and so, like most Japanese tv cartoons, the animation is poor, the color palette is limited, the musical selection is limited, and some of the voice acting may be unpleasing. And yet, though I am not an anime fan--I find most anime embarrassingly bad--I love everything about this show. I love the limited animation. I love the colors. I love the music. I love the sometimes-embarrassing, mostly-brilliant, always-silly dialogue. I love the voice acting--even the ones I don't like, hehe. The story and its characters are so compelling that negatives in presentation become likeable attributes.

Purchasing the 6-disk box set has been one of the most satisfying DVD purchases I have ever made. The anime, ""Berserk,"" is a show unlike any other, so I hope you will not miss it. Thank you for reading this message.  :D",1128988800,3,2853,4.8580246913580245
