8573389,2,B00BSTVK9W,"Wow. The worst, most stupid martial arts ever seen on screen. Didn't watch beyond the first several minutes. Too incompetent; useless inclusion of gore. At least the Seagal one and two star flicks have way better MMA.",1515974400,,217,4.891891891891892
8573390,1,B00BSTVK9W,"Holy crud. The Amazon reviews are off. I think people voted on Amazon prime, not the actual movie. If you look at the foontnote for IMDB, it has a 3-4 star rating. Point?

This movie is bad. The acting is worse than Brad Pitt and Matt LeBlanc. The flow is something castrated from the 1970s. Don't even bother. I can normally finish even a bad movie but I stopped after 30 minutes because I was hoping it would pick up. It didn't. It's like hitting a brick wall, and then having the wall insult your ancestors b/c its a new low.",1514851200,,528,4.227722772277228
8573391,3,B00BSTVK9W,"not horrible, not great.  weak script;  madsen's character is consistent throughout, but everyone else seems to flop around in their motivations and choices without any clear reason.  the lead character, who is supposed to be very intelligent and a reader of people, does many stupid things throughout the movie, with no obvious justification",1514764800,,342,5.415094339622642
8573392,3,B00BSTVK9W,"Nothing special in this one. If Madsen was not in it, it would be a total flop.

Average ... everything.",1508630400,,104,4.2
