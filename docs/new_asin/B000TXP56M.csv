I checked that one or two of the movies played when I received the package, but I did not inspect all of the DVDs.

2910927,4,B000TXP56M,"My piekna zona recently asked me to buy her a copy of Guess Who's Coming to Dinner so I conveniently bought this Stanley Kramer Collection (at a nice price) so I could also have a copy of The Member of the Wedding, which is still not sold individually.

The Member of the Wedding (1952) was directed by Fred Zinnemann and stars Broadway legend, Julie Harris, in her film debut. Carson McCullers' The Member of the Wedding was first published in 1946. A successful theatrical adaptation opened on Broadway in 1950 starring Harris, Ethel Waters, and Brandon deWilde who then reprised their roles in this film.

Frankie Adams (Harris) is a lonely twelve-year-old in a Southern town. She has no friends and spends all of her time with the family's Black housemaid, Berenice (Waters), and her young cousin, John Henry (deWilde), who lives next door. Frankie deeply yearns to make a connection, to find the ""we of me,"" and decides she will leave town with her newlywed brother and his wife. Her plans go terribly awry and Frankie must adapt.

This is a deeply moving story of loneliness and connection. Many aspects of McCullers' own life are captured in the story. Julie Harris, who was twenty-five-years-old at the time of the filming, gives a remarkable, although overstated, performance that earned a Best Actress Oscar nomination. Waters is superb. Zinneman's direction is solid and the Alex North score is quite good.

The Member of the Wedding is a wonderful adaptation of the novel and I'm thrilled to finally have a copy on DVD. I was very much looking forward to the commentary by McCullers' biographer, Virginia Spencer Carr (The Lonely Hunter), but was disappointed. Carr offers only scant insight into McCullers, the novel, and the film. A few of her comments are even erroneous (e.g., the wedding was to take place at Winter Hill - the wedding takes place at Winter Hill in the novel but in the film the ceremony takes place at Frankie's house). However, we must keep in mind the late Professor Carr recorded her commentary while in her late-seventies.

Trivia alert: Hugh Beaumont, who portrays the wedding minister in an uncredited role, would later star in the successful television series, Leave it to Beaver (1957-1963).",1379289600,5,2233,4.912466843501326

Excellent transfer quality including rare interviews, additional film footage and commentary with each film.  'A Member of the Wedding' is one of my all time favorite films, and the clarity of the Black and White film transfer to DVD is exceptional for its' clarity and sound quality.  The same quality and additional commentaries and rare film footage can be expected for all of the other films on DVD in this Collection.

Highly recommended for those interested in great movies from Hollywood transferred to DVD with exceptional commentary and additional film footage probably never seen before.",1375228800,2,676,5.289719626168225
2910930,5,B000TXP56M,"Stanley Kramer was a genius in the film industry where he was both producer and director. In this collection, his widow Karen Kramer did a fantastic job in choosing five distinct films such as the following:

""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?"" is a film classic which earned a third Academy Award for Best Actress to the amazing Katharine Hepburn and a final performance by the dazzling unforgettable Spencer Tracy. He died two weeks after the film's premiere. The film had an all-star cast such as Sidney Poitier as Dr. John Ward Prentice; Isabell Sanford as Tillie; Cecil Kellaway as Monsignor: and Beah Richards as Mrs. Prentice. Katharine Hepburn's actual maternal niece, Katharine Houghton, plays her daughter, Joanna, in the film.

The film takes place in the course of the day when Joanna and Dr. Prentice return from Hawaii to San Francisco, California to announce their wedding plans to Hepburn and Tracy. Everybody including the liberal mother and father are stunned of course. The film was so controversial about interracial marriage that it caused threats against everybody involved. Some might say the film is dated by today's standards but not necessarily so. Unbeknownst to the audience, Spencer Tracy who was married in real life to another woman had a long-term intimate relationship with Katharine Hepburn. Watching Tracy and Hepburn together is amazing. If Tracy could have divorced his wife despite his Irish Catholic religion, perhaps Hepburn and Tracy would have married. Regardless they show a romance onscreen to be genuine and real. They also know of Tracy's ailing health at the time of the film.

The disc features introductions by Karen Kramer; Tom Brokaw; and Quincy Jones. There is a second bonus disc which includes ""A Love Story of Today"" about the making of the film; ""A Special Kind of Love"" about Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn; ""Stanley Kramer: A Man's Search for the Truth"" which is about film director and producer's film history; the 2007 Producers Guild ""Stanley Kramer"" Award Presentation to former Vice President Al Gore; and Stanley Kramer receiving the prestigious Irving Thalberg Award at the Academy Awards.

The second film was ""Ship of Fools"" with an all-star cast including Lee Marvin, Vivien Leigh, BarBara Luna, Elizabeth Ashley, George Segal, Oscar Werner, Jose Ferrer, Michael Dunn, Simone Signoret, Michael Corwin, and Werner Kemperer to name a few. The film is about transatlantic cruise from Veracruz, Mexico to Germany and takes place in 1933 when the Nazis rise to power. The film is a classic and earned eight Academy Award nominations. The DVD features Karen Kramer's introduction; ""The Voyage on A Soundstage"" about the making of the film; and ""On Board of Ship of Fools"" with Elizabeth Ashley and George Segal as well.

The third film in this collection is Carson McCuller's novel turned play to film entitled ""A Member of the Wedding"" which stars Julie Harris as Frances ""Frankie"" Adams whom she played onstage on Broadway for 501 performances with Ethel Waters and Brandon De Wilde. The film is about tomboyish Frankie Adams who wants to run away with her older married brother Jarvis and his bride Janice. The DVD also includes a documentary by author and biographer Virginia Spencer Carr about Carson McCullers; The Journey from Stage to Film with Kevin Spacey, Virginia Carr, and Karen Kramer; and ""The World of Carson McCullers"" the author of the story; and a brief note from Julie Harris.

The fourth film is a classic entitled ""The Wild One"" influenced by the actual events in Hollister, California in 1947. The film starred Marlon Brando in an unforgettable performance. The disc also features a Karen Kramer introduction. There is a segment about ""Hollister, California: Bikers, Booze, and the Big Picture."" There are unforgettable scenes of Brando in the role especially on the bike. Lee Marvin has a supporting role. There is a brief segment entitled ""Brando: An Icon is Born"" which includes Taylor Hackord, Dennis Hopper, and Karen Kramer, and Elizabeth Ashley.

The final film is entitled ""The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T,"" based on a Dr. Seuss story. The film is as distanct and unique like all the others. For a children's film, it seems a little dark at times. Tommy Rettig plays Bart Collins who hates his piano teacher, Dr. Tutwiler (played by the fabulous Hans Conried) in the role. Bart dreams about Dr. T imprisoning him and other children in a diabolical plan to have 5,000 fingers play an enormous piano. The art direction and scenery is surreal and unbelievable and advance at the time. Mary Healy plays Mrs. Collins, Bart's widowed mom, who is a victim of Dr. T's crime. He enlists the help of the plumber (played by Peter Lind Hayes). Healy and Hayes were a real life couple and performed onstage together in Los Angeles. The DVD includes a Karen Kramer introduction. ""Dr. T on Screen"" includes interviews with Cathy Lind Hayes, Peter and Mary's daughter; Karen Kramer; George Chakiris, and others about the film. Then there is a segment entitled ""A Little Nightmare Music"" which included Michael Feinstein interview.

The DVDs are all high quality and worth watching for any movie fan. The special features are worth noting Stanley Kramer's film legacy and his contributions to discovering new talents and nurturing them to perform onscreen. The films' history and background are just as fascinating as the stories told onscreen.",1369612800,4,5416,5.050335570469799

2910942,2,B000TXP56M,"This is a sad, sad collection of mostly movies that never should have been made.  The movies are full of politically correct platitudes, silliness, and cornball antics.  The characters are all over done to the point of being totally unbelievable.  There are some excellent actors in the movies, but the movies themselves are so bad there is little those actors could do to salvage the movie.

This collection is little more than series of tedious and repetitious pontifications of Mr. Kramer's extremely liberal political views to the point that the movies become predictable, boring, at times offensive, at times silly, and generally unentertaining.

Most interesting for me was ""The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T,"" the only live action movie of a Dr. Seuss story that he allowed in his lifetime. Even though he wrote the story and all the song lyrics, he disowned the film after it was poorly received by critics and audiences.

It is a fantastic collection and I have seen all of the movies before, but of course I had to view ""Member"" first and then ""Ship of Fools.""  The actors that stand out in this collection are Tracy and Hepburn plus Poitier  in ""Guess,"" Marlon Brando in ""Wild,"" Vivien Leigh in ""Ship"" with equally fine performances by Lee Marvin and Michael Dunne, and of course Julie Harris and Ethyl Waters in ""Member.""  The most stellar performance of the whole pack is the young Brandon de Wilde in ""Member.""  If it were re-windable, I could re-wind and watch this young man over and over and over.  Too bad we lost this actor, although his skill seemed to disappate with maturity.  The odd movie in this pack is the ""1000 Fingers.""  It is a heroic undertaking, the making of this movie, but instead of being the surrealistic masterpiece it could have been, the sets and props seem amateurish.  I must review this one several more times to fully appreciate it--the acting by Tommy Rettig is quite good--and I may finally decide that I love it BECAUSE of its faults, instead of in spite of them. (I have given more detailed reviews of the individual movies, previously)  Stanley Kramer was a genius as displayed here on celuloid.",1245888000,46,1405,4.561752988047809
2910950,5,B000TXP56M,"With most boxed DVD sets, the discs are linked by something in common, usually an actor, director or genre.  The producer is rarely the common link, which makes sense:  there are not many producers who are really recognizable as far as film-making abilities go (to me, one of the few is Val Lewton, whose horror films all have a distinct feel).  This is the main problem with The Stanley Kramer Film Collection:  while the five movies within all have their merits, they are all so different that it is hard to find true commonality among them.

The first of the five (in rough chronological order, which is how I viewed them) is The Member of the Wedding, an adaptation of a Carson McCullers story centered on a 12 year old girl whose feelings of exclusion drive her to obsess about her brother's upcoming wedding and thoughts about running away.  For all its virtues, this is also a flawed movie (and probably the weakest in the set):  it is an adaptation of a play (itself adapted from a book), and has a distinctly stagy feel with lots of dialogue and little action.  Also, Julie Harris--in her mid-twenties when the movie was made--is not very plausible as a 12 year old, either in appearance or speech.

The Wild One is perhaps the most well-known movie in the set, a tale of a gang of bikers who run riot in a small California town.  Although it is rather dated by today's standards, this was quite the hit when it came out and was one of the films that made Marlon Brando a star.  Though

My favorite in the set is the bizarre fantasy The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T, written by Dr. Seuss and with a distinctly Seussian look.  The story--a child's dream--involves an evil piano teacher's attempt to get 500 child pianists (with 5000 fingers) to play his music, but that only vaguely describes this truly off-beat film.  It was the first Seuss work to be put to film and remains the best live-action adaptation of his work.

Ship of Fools is a soap opera on a cruise ship heading from Mexico to Germany in 1933.  The all-star cast includes Vivien Leigh (in her last role), Lee Marvin, George Segal and Simone Signoret, among others.  Along with the intertwining plots is the looming threat of Nazism and the denial that Hitler and his cause would actually put their talk into action.

If The Wild One isn't the most familiar of the five titles, then Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is.  This film features Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy (in their last pairing) as parents surprised when their daughter comes home with her new fiance, Sidney Potier.  In today's world, where interracial romance is far more common, this film may appear rather quaint, but in its era, it was a more daring film.  Unfortunately, it is also almost all talk and no action, with plenty of speech making, making this a movie that is more well-meaning than truly good.

The only real connection between these five movies is Kramer, who produced all five movies and directed the last two.  Kramer was involved with many films beyond these, including Westerns like High Noon and comedies like It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World.  There is a bit of unifying theme with Kramer's belief in liberal social values, but even that is often elusive.  So as a boxed set, this collection is only moderately successful, a case where the whole is less than the sum of its parts.  Nonetheless, with some decent-to-great films and lots of extras, this set earns a low five-stars.",1224374400,4,3435,4.608552631578948
8211259,5,B000TXP56M,"No one would ever accuse film director Stanley Kramer of being stuck in one stylistic groove or obsessed with getting out one particular message.  Here in one package are five different -- and delightfully different -- top-drawer movies:

Guess Who's Coming to Dinner - Tracy and Hepburn's last movie.  He's a ""liberal"" newspaper publisher; she's his wife.  Together they confront th fact that their daughter is about to marry a black man.

Ship of Fools - An amazing kind of epic with an all-star multinational cast, based on the book by Katharine Anne Porter .

The Member of the Wedding - Carson McCuller's sensitive novella becomes a sensitive movie.  Great performances.

The Wild One - Brando's breakthrough movie.  Leather jackets and amoral motorcycle ""angels"" were never sexier!

The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T - An absolutely amazing kids' fantasia, based on a story by Dr. Seuss.  A small boy (Tommy Rettig) is held captive by a maniacal piano teacher (Hans Conried) until his two favorite adults can help him out.  If Technicolor hadn't already existed, they'd have had to invent it for this wonderful, surrealistic comedy/musical about the perils of kid-dom.",1510358400,,1167,5.052356020942408

8211266,2,B000TXP56M,"Picked up for 5000 fingers.  Just watched it and know why it got poor reviews when released.
 Beginning of movie kid breaks the 4th wall a few times then goes into a dream for the entire movie.  We know it's a dream so there is no tension or care to what happens. When he wakes up it will be gone.  Musical numbers fill half or more of the screen time and are forgettable.  You probably won't be singing them at work the next day. Only decent thing is some of the sets and backgrounds are interesting. I collect movie so to me it's worth owning but, I would not recommend it to most people.",1466294400,,590,4.140350877192983
