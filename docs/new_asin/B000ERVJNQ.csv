2533388,3,B000ERVJNQ,Product was as described but some of the shows skip while playing which is frustrating for a 2 year old.,1301616000,,104,4.25
2533389,5,B000ERVJNQ,My son has been asking for this video and this is the only place I could find it. It loves it and watches it all the time.,1296777600,,122,3.5555555555555554
2533390,5,B000ERVJNQ,My 6 year old loves every episode on this video.  It is one of his favorites.  It even has an episode from Little Bill on how to tie your shoes.  It is wonderful.  I would recommend buying this video for you child.,1257984000,,214,4.023809523809524
2533391,5,B000ERVJNQ,We have had these for a while now. I think my kids have watched all four of the DVD's about 10 times each. The shows are fantastic and the variety of shows on each DVD makes it very enjoyable and not repetitive. This is a very good value.,1228089600,,238,3.9791666666666665
2533392,4,B000ERVJNQ,"I like having the selection of different kids shows here.  A little variety for those who cannot bear yet another episode of a toddler favorite.  At least you'll be hearing a few different theme songs!

The reason we bought this one is because it seems to be the only way to obtain the Pirate Treasure episode of the Backyardigans - Super Episode for the little Backyard Aliens.

It introduced my kids to Sportacus, and weird as Lazy Town is, I like him as a hero (he eats right, goes to sleep early, plays fair and is a super hero, what more can we ask?)

I like the fact that it allows for a 'play all' option... what I do not like is the Blues Clues episode.  It's the 100th episode party, so there is no coherent lesson in it.  My kids don't seem to mind, but I don't like it.  Why show a bunch of clips to children with short attention spans? ISn't one of the ideas to help them lengthen their attention span and learn a bit of critical thinking??  But like I say, the kids have not complained.

Good way to learn about new higher quality shows - like Ruby and Max and Little Bill...",1193702400,,1088,4.21256038647343
2533393,4,B000ERVJNQ,"This DVD is great for kids who love Nick Jr. Episodes are very good. My boys love it, and I love the fact that it's over an hour and a half long. Great for plane rides.",1169078400,,168,3.6944444444444446
2533394,5,B000ERVJNQ,A very well put together episodes of the most popular children shows.  I wish PBS would do this as well seeing as how Nick Jr. and PBS have the most popular children's shows on TV today.  Was very glad Sponge Bob was not included as it teaches children very nasty habits.,1166572800,,271,4.294117647058823
2533395,4,B000ERVJNQ,"""Nick Jr. Favorites 4"" is the fourth in this continuing series and features six Nick Jr. programs. It's another great selection overall, dampened only by the usual lack of special features.

Seen on this DVD:

""The Backyardigans""
Pirate Treasure

A great selection from this wonderful, colorful, musical Nelvana serie that will soon be featuring more new episodes on Nick Jr. In this absolutely classic episode, the Backyardigans pretend to be pirates, and as everyone knows, pirates say ""arr."" Like most of the episodes of the show --- this one features four of the characters, and this is one where they're split up into two groups. Captains Uniqua and Austin hunt for treasure, followed closely by Captains Pablo and Tyrone. Both pirate teams have half a map --- but with only half each, how will either find the treasure?

""Blue's Clues""
100th Episode Celebration

A great choice. This celebration episode consists in large part of clips from past episodes, but it's well put together. It also features a special visit from Steve. He's wearing a top-hat in this episode --- nobody knew it at the time, but as recently announced in the behind-the-scenes special, one of the main reasons for him leaving the show was that he was losing his hair. This special was a perfect way to have him back on for a bit, and the hat, of course, appeared perfectly normal!

""LazyTown""
Prince Stingy

This was one of the few episodes of the program I hadn't seen, so I was pleased that it was on this DVD. When Stingy fantasizes about being a prince, Robbie Rotten concocts a scheme to make his dream come true. But Robbie's rotten plan comes with some strings attached --- such as making up rules to get rid of that ""blue elf"" --- *FOREVER!!!*

""Little Bill""
Racing Time / All Tied Up

If there's any one reason to get this DVD, this is it. ""Little Bill"" no longer airs on Nick Jr. and with CBS no longer airing Nick Jr. programming starting September 2006, ""Little Bill"" may very well be off the airwaves. So it's wonderful to see this on the DVD. In the first story, Little Bill learns how to get to school on time. And in the second, he gets help tying his shoes.

Also included on this DVD are ""Dora the Explorer"" and ""Max and Ruby."" I don't think much of either show, but I know they're pretty popular. The ""Dora"" episode is ""Rapido, Tico!"" and ""Max & Ruby"" features three stories --- ""Max Cleans Up / Max's Cuckoo Clock / Ruby's Jewelry Box.""",1155513600,,2436,4.605080831408776
