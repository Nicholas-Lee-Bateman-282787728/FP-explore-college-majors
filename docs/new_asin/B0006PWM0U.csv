It made me sea-sick.",1174953600,5,585,6.036144578313253
8513842,5,B0006PWM0U,"I happened to run across this DVD while browsing on the web. I found it to be a convenient way to escape the stress of my everyday life, especially in the winter. Has none of that crappy New Age music, just the real sounds of the ocean. A great way to lie on the couch read a book or just zone out and stare at the beach scenes on the TV. Looks good on a TV. I feel like I'm on some expensive European vacation.  This is the company's best DVD, unless you prefer a tropical setting.  Then go for Tropical Timeout.",1132617600,,513,4.019607843137255
