2482066,5,B000E1P3BQ,"Bravos are due once again to Opus Arte for another one of their fine Blu-ray opera DVDs.  This production is traditional in style (no Euro trash) and entirely enchanting.  The smallish stage at Glyndebourne is inventively used and the costumes are a delight.  The Prima Donna encompasses a famously difficult role easily, though she -like anyone who essays this role - inevitably faces comparison to Cecilia Bartoli's Cenerentola.  In the Buffo role of Don Magnifico, Luciano Di Pasquale nearly steals the show by milking every moment for maximum comic effect - imagine Jackie Gleason at the opera.  For this reviewer, however, the real thrill came unexpectedly in the form of tenor Maxim Mironov, whose voice is perfectly placed throughout its range, clear as a bell, and sweetly vibrant with a little bit of fast vibrato.  His role here is rather large and fiercely difficult, with extensive coloratura and repeated high notes, all delivered flawlessly.  Tenors have always been a hobby of mine, and I have heard almost every one who has made a record in the past hundred years.  I believe that Mironov could mount a challenge to Juan Diego Florez, the reigning Rossini tenor of our time.  Unfortunately, his acting needs a little work, as he generally looked as if he had wandered onto the stage by accident.  But, no matter - this is a great voice.

Finally, the stage direction includes one delightful innovation:  Whenever one of Rossini's intricate and slightly weird ensembles occurs (these are one of the chief glories of his comedies), the lights dim and the actors begin to move in stylized and complex patterns, mirroring the music.  This is a marvelous touch that serves to highlight the ensembles, rather as if they were happening in an alternate universe.

The DVD itself looks splendid - crisp, bright, and colorful, but the sound (I heard it in Stereo, not 5.1 surround) seemed a little shrill and lacking in bass.  Conductor Jurowski, who is amassing a formidable resume and fine reviews, brought the full measure of clarity and high spirits so necessary to this score, although I wish he had allowed the orchestra to stop for applause after the arias. In any event, the Glyndebourne audience loved it, and so will you.",1242000000,12,2237,4.928
2482067,5,B000E1P3BQ,"Great production. Great signing and great images. The production is centered in the human aspects of this known story, no magic at all, just diverse characters that Rossini knew how to portray with words and music. Bluray technology really puts you in the front raw of the theater.
I strongly recommend this Bluray disk to Rossini lovers and to be shown to youngsters that can understand the human aspects of the Cinderella story passed the magic of Disney.",1227139200,5,457,4.871794871794871
2482068,4,B000E1P3BQ,"What a fine disc. I am reluctant to give a 5 for video as it will be even better in the years to come but bearing in mind the challenges of filming under opera house conditions, this is about as close as current technology can get. The performance is excellent but there are others on SD DVD that run it close. This is a delight to the eye, the ear and the inner sentiment. If you have a blu ray player treat yourself to an evening of pure enjoyment. If you don't then there is no better excuse to go out and get both a player and this disc!",1226102400,4,541,3.9724770642201834
2482069,5,B000E1P3BQ,"For several years I have owned the DVD release of this performance.  Just before the Blu-Ray copy arrived, I watched the whole DVD copy all the way through and was impressed by the high musicality and good staging.  The Prince stood out as a Rossinian singer of high excellence, who would be a credit to any stage.
After the Blu-Ray arrived I compared the two masterings with an eye to detail.
Visually, the Blu-Ray stands hand over fist above the DVD.  Even with upscaling the DVD is fuzzy, and Jurowski comes across as a stern, aloof figure at the podium.  With the extra clarity of the Blu-Ray picture, the maestro's tiny facial expressions demonstrate that he conducts by his charm as much as by his hand gestures.  He possesses an inner understanding of the humanity of this piece of music, and exudes it during the overture.  That revelation alone is worth the price of the Blu-Ray disc.
Sonically, the Blu-Ray is a careful remix and clean-up of the original tapes.  On the DVD, two chairs can be heard to squeak on the floor a split second before Jurowski lowers his baton.  Those distractions are gone on the Blu-Ray track.  There is also better attention to volume level: the DTS track on the DVD becomes very harsh in the upper levels during the ensemble work, but everything balances nicely on the Blu-Ray.
I enjoyed the DVD very much but that was no reason to turn into a pumpkin: get the Blu-Ray.",1225497600,17,1409,4.604
2482070,5,B000E1P3BQ,"There can't be much dispute about the quality of this work. The staging, the singing, the technical brilliance of the hidef experience both visually and aurally are impeccable. A group of us gathered to experience La Cenerentola in my home. We laughed, we applauded, we smiled to each other sharing the delight.

As the review above noted, no magic is involved in this rendering of the Cinderella story. Everything is worked out through the wisdom of Alidoro, the Prince's old sage counselor (sung brilliantly and with all due gravitas by Nathan Berg). This makes it a comedy well within the human domain. The moral lessons are clear: vanity is illusive and will not serve us well, all of us must treat each other with kindness, virtue is rewarded, and forgiveness and love heal all.

The characters are beautifully played and sung. Angelina (la cenerentola herself--Cinderella-sung by Ruxandra Donose)appropriately plays a somewhat withdrawn role at first but grows in vocal power and confidence throughout the opera . She emerges at the end as a shimmering beauty of brilliant voice. The ""evil"" stepsisters, Clorinda and Tisbe (Raquela Sheeran and Lucia Cirillo) are presented as very distinguishable comedic personalities whose voices often combine in bell-like harmonies. Don Magnifico, the wicked stepfather, is played to great comedic effect (Luciano Di Pasquale)as a buffoon who is cruel, fearful, and self-delusive at the same time. His is a gem of a performance. (It is with this that we see one of the drawbacks of such high visual resolution: one can easily see where the scalp cover is joined to his temples. But then again, the characters and sets seem almost three-dimensional, so it is a definite plus). The Prince, Don Ramiro, (Maxim Mironov) is carefully constructed as a major character who must be less prominent than Cinderella herself, so he is a Rossini tenor, somewhere between tenor and counter-tenor. He is young, handsome, recognizes virtue and responds to it honorably, and sings well. Yet it is the other characters who dominate, including Dandini,(Simone Alberghini) the valet the Prince has commissioned to play him while the Prince stays in the background to observe the reactions of the stepdaughters and anyone else hoping to be his bride.

Certainly this production shows off the glories of high definition BluRay, but it is the quality of the performances that should really sell this version to the public. For opera lovers, this Opus Arte presentation of the Glyndebourne production (almost always high quality from Glyndebourne and Opus Arte)is truly a must. It is not possible not to revel in this 3-hour delight. Do yourself a favor and get it; you'll love it.",1223251200,20,2700,5.117913832199546
2482071,5,B000E1P3BQ,What a treasure. The technical quality of this Blu-ray is magnificent. I am a tech. perfection freak... this one has it.  Video and audio revealed no flaws to me. The performances were excellent all around. Lead singers were knock-outs. The theater felt intimate. Fantastic lighting.  I could not believe how super fine the sound was and the video is stunning. But... the direction of the thing was what worked me over. I connected immediately. There were no fairies... no magic of any kind... except the magic of an all around perfect show. This version of the story ultimately yanks away the worship of royalty and gives us a good and decent woman and man. The hero is Cinderella. I think that a Blu-ray disc like this would be an eye opener of an equipment sales tool. This is the reason I have Blu-ray. More please....,1220227200,11,822,4.662068965517242
2482072,3,B000E1P3BQ,"I think that the appointment of Vladimir Jurowski as principal conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra is great news. As that orchestra is also the house orchestra in this recording of from Glyndebourne, I sat down to watch this opera with great expectations. The overture was well played with Mr. Jurowski's interpretation and modulation of volume and pacing creating something quite different from what I had been accustomed to after many years of watching the DVD of the Houston Grand Opera production. I had carefully read the booklet with this DVD before viewing, so I had some expectation that this version would show a once successful family now enduring a significantly reduced standard of living. I was not, however, prepared for the degree that this would be shown on stage. The opening set was of a large, sparsely furnished, dreary space with no bright colors anywhere; everything and everyone seemed very drab and uninteresting. The single stage set in the older Houston production was on a revolving stage with individual flights of stairs that rotated independently and this, together with a backdrop used for Don Magnifico's home, was sufficient to give plenty of variety in all but the one set inside the Palace. Conversely, it is the opposite here with only the set within the Palace seeming to have any magnificence and grandeur.

In my opinion the major issue with this production, apart from the sets, was the poor casting of the principal players. Don Magnifico appeared far too coarse and unshaven and wearing what could only be guessed were long Johns that he has been in for far too long. His daughters Clorinda and Tisbe, played by Raquela Sheeran and Lucio Cirillo, were not as charismatic as were Laura Knoop and Jill Grove in the earlier Houston production and consequently not so interesting to watch. Dandini, Simone Alberghini, seemed much too handsome to be a valet masquerading as his employer and sang with more authority than Maxim Mironov playing Don Ramiro. In the Houston production it was quite easy to understand Angelina falling for Don Ramiro pretending to be the valet whereas, in the Glyndebourne version, the more softly sung and somewhat ragged and unkempt appearance of Mr. Mironov makes this difficult to believe.  Ruxandra Donose, as Angelina, is very pretty and has a delightful voice, but was probably a little out of her league singing this most intricate and complicated of Rossini's heroines, though to be fair there were many sections that she handled very creditably.

The audio and video recording of this recent Glyndebourne production is, as usual, of the highest standard but it was Sir Peter Hall's interpretation that made this, for me, a somewhat less than satisfying experience to watch.",1217980800,3,2759,5.059340659340659
2482073,5,B000E1P3BQ,"I am not going to say too much as all the other reviewers have done an adequate job.  This is just a wonderful dvd with excellent singing, acting, costumes, and sets.  One could quibble a little here and there about some of the coloratura on the part of the basses, but all in all everybody pulls together a wonderful show.  Donose has such a desirable voice - I certainly hope we can get some more recordings of her in the near future.  And the Dandini had such a beautiful sound.  The whole thing is a delight.  I've seen all the commercial Cenerentola's available except the movie with von Stade, and this is the best I have seen so far.",1168732800,3,640,4.336134453781512
2482074,5,B000E1P3BQ,"I agree with just about everything Mike Birman had to say in his exhaustive and very informative review of this wonderful DVD of Rossini's 'La Cenerentola.' (I urge you to read it. My review is really just an addendum to his.) I would only add that I thought the musical direction by Vladimir Jurowski was spot on, beautifully shaped. He doesn't dawdle and that is a plus in Rossini. (Yet he was able to linger appropriately in Cenerentola's opening aria about the lonely king.) The all-but-patented Rossini crescendi and accelerandi are marvelously timed. The London Philharmonic are masterly in this June 2005 production at Glyndebourne.

My only very minor quibbles -- and this comes from this being a live production -- are that sometimes there is some problem with the singers being a bit behind the beat in the faster passages of the buffo arias. All the singers are excellent although Alberghini (Dandini) is a bit wooly-voiced, especially in the early scenes. I was not at all bothered by Donose's lower register as Birman was, but I see why he mentions it. At first I thought Mironov (Don Ramiro), whose voice was aptly described by Birman as 'reedy', had a bothersome Supervia-like rapid vibrato/tremolo but he got that under control and impressed with his accurate coloratura and some sly comic acting.

I loved that this production was traditional. Sir Peter Hall knows not to mess with a librettist's invention and yet he did come up with some inventive stage action within the context of the traditional mise en scene. Bravo for that. (Though I was a bit taken aback when the stepsisters, early in Act I, appeared to be receiving the prince's heralds while still in their undergarments. Tsk tsk.)

This is definitely five-star production and gets my hearty recommendation.

2482075,5,B000E1P3BQ,"La Cenerentola has been well served on DVD. The recently released Jean-Pierre Ponnelle filming of the opera was an excellent production, joining Cecilia Bartoli's star vehicle with the Houston Opera as fine representatives of Rossini's unfairy tale retelling of Charles Perrault's Cendrillon (or Cinderella). This new, vividly realized Glyndebourne production traditionally staged (in the finest sense) by Sir Peter Hall is perhaps the best of the three: combining intelligent insight into Rossini's unique operatic vision as well as a perceptive grasp of the historical importance of Cenerentola in the evolution of art, situated as it is on the cusp of the Romantic Era.

La Cenerentola is given the sub-heading (by Rossini) ""a Dramma giocoso in two acts""; significantly, it is an inscription deliberately shared with Don Giovanni, the finest ""serious comedy"" ever staged. Mozart's spirit hovers over this opera; combining, as it does, comedy and a darker world view than is the youthful Rossini's norm. There is no room for farce. This is a relatively sober tale of impoverished gentility struggling to regain a social foothold. There is no fairy Godmother; rather a Voltaire-like philosophe (Alidoro) who attempts to manipulate events for ends never completely clear. This opera is truly representative of it's age and that is how Sir Peter stages it. The London Philharmonic is nicely conducted by the youthful Vladimir Jurowski. That this opera succeeds so well is a tribute to all concerned in this beautiful, resonant production.

First performed at the Teatro Valle, Rome on 25 January 1817 on the heels of Rossini's successful il Barbieri di Siviglia, and with a libretto by Jacopo Ferretti, La Cenerentola is as much a child of the Enlightenment with it's rational values and philosophe trained Prince in the person of Don Ramiro as it is an expression of nascent Romanticism with it's triumph of love over social hierarchy. If you are expecting a traditional fairy tale you will be disappointed. It is more a comedy of manners with serious overtones: the struggles of individual merit attempting to overcome class restrictions. It is an expression of the Age of Franklin, Washington and Jefferson. This Cinderella will better herself not through magic but through intrinsic worth, as coached by Alidoro, a philosopher/social mechanic. Sir Peter Hall suggests (in the 30 minute documentary on disc 2 entitled Insights) that opera singers should be clothed in the style of the music they sing. This production is placed in the era of 1815-1830 and is stunningly visual. The grandees are beautifully dressed in their period clothing, Cenerentola and her family suitably seedy in costumes looking moth-eaten, lived-in and dirty, yet suggestive of former gentility. It is obvious that great thought went into the staging of this opera. The sets also reflect the social position of their denizens, a loving recreation of the era which draws you into the world of this opera like no other component. It is a visual treat.

The acting and singing are fine because both aspects of the drama are stressed. The vile, narcissistic step-sisters Clorinda (Raquela Sheeran) and Tisbe (Lucia Cirillo) are excellently portrayed. The Father ironically named Don Magnifico (Luciano di Pasquale) is superbly repugnant. The philosophe Alidoro (Nathan Berg) is sung with a suitably rich Bass-Baritone reminiscent of Mozart's Sarastro in the Magic Flute. Dandini (appropriately named), the servant who masquerades as the prince to discover which of the sisters is most worthy of marriage, is sung by Simone Alberghini. The prince Don Ramiro (Maxim Mironov) is youthful with a fine, slightly reedy tenor. Angelina (another appropriate name) also known as Cenerentola is sung by lovely Ruxandra Donose. Her voice struck me as slightly problematic. It is a dark mezzo-soprano leaning toward contralto and is an excellent instrument: lyrical and supple. It's a voice that will only improve with time. At her lower register she projects softly so that hearing her distinctly on my sound system required my close attention and an occasional finger on the volume button. Her upper register is fine, with no difficulty in projection (though she's no Bette Midler).

The opera was recorded live at the Glyndebourne Opera House on June 2 & 4 2005. It is shot in 16/9 anamorphic widescreen high-definition film and looks beautiful. The double layer DVD is NTSC encoded for all regions. Sound is available in LPCM stereo and 5.1 DTS Digital Surround and is stunningly lifelike with great presence and immediacy. Good home theater systems will have a field day. Subtitles are in English, French, German, Spanish and Italian. Extras include a Cast Gallery, an Illustrated Synopsis and a short documentary Insights with Sir Peter Hall and Vladimir Jurowski. The running time of the 2 discs is 187 minutes.

On balance, this is my favorite Cenerentola because of its insightful production. It is intelligently presented and beautiful to look at. Opus Arte is releasing some fine DVD sets and this is another example of their high standards. Strongly recommended.

8104276,5,B000E1P3BQ,"The Glyndebourne 2005 production, directed by Hall and conducted by V. Jurowski, is an almost 'perfect' production but for some tiny imperfections.
The goodies first - the production is simply the best 21st century productions of this opera, the Liceu and MET productions included.  The conducting and direction are both eminent - Jurowski and Hall really collaborated to bring out the score's essential elements to great effect! The ensemble works shine, the dramatic elements vividly put across. The orchestra plays with verve and in great Rossinian style, not some thing to be taken for granted in a London performance, and young Valdimir Jurowski really tops predecessors like Neville Marriner in works of this genre.  What the audience would look forward to is his 'Il Barbiere di Sivigli' and 'Gugliemo Tell'.
The sets and costumes are truly top rate, rivalling the classic grandeur of the 1980 La Scala production directed by Jean Pierre Ponnelle as well as the 1988 Salzburg production.
While Jurowski's conducting rivals that of a Claudio Abbado and Riccardo Chailly, his leads are a jot less effective - vocally, the Angelina of Ruxandra Donose nowhere is in the league of Frederica von Stade or Ann Murray, nor the 21st century Didonato and Garanca, let alone Cecilia Bartoli of the mid-1990 production at Houston.  Added to this, visually Donose is pretty in a slighty overbearing manner, some thing not ideal for Cenerentola.  Coupled with Hall's new interpretation, it seems that she's effortfully re-creating a 'Princess Diana' on the operatic stage instead of La Cenerentola!
As Prince Ramiro, young Russian tenor Maxim Mironov is vocally very capable, with a timbre that JDF would but envy.  He is a tad too green on stage, but overall, he is still a successful Don Ramiro, if not as convincing as Francisco Araiza, or vocally as accomplished as Raul Gimenez.
the rest of the cast is very outstanding, with Simone Alberghini's Dandini clearly standing out as the best ever Dandini (even more so that Corbelli or Gino Quillico).
Di Pasquale is a good Magnifico, but his attire is perhaps to shabby to be appropriate.
All in all, this is by a big margin the best 21st century La Cenerentola, and only a small margin behind the great 20th century top ones.",1360454400,2,2270,5.010610079575597
8104277,5,B000E1P3BQ,"This recording of La Cenerentola at Glyndebourne was made in 2005 and this was a new production for Glyndebourne at that time. The setting is strictly traditional in feel and period with appropriate costuming and sets. On that subject, the Baron's home is particularly down-at heel in this production and the baron himself is especially unkempt and this therefore underlines the contrast between his circumstances, and therefore Cinderella's, with those of the prince and therefore Cinderella's potential final home.

The cast is a very strong one and is therefore capable of favourable comparison with Bartoli's portrayal at Houston to take an example of strong casting from an earlier generation.

As already touched upon, the baron at home is portrayed as essentially unkempt. However he remains blissfully unaware of the impression he gives and exudes an over-developed ego. These characteristics are well brought out by Luciano Di Pasquale who has just the right kind of sonorous voice to carry the role vocally. The three other leading men, Alidoro played by Nathan Berg, Dandini played by Simone Alberghini and Don Ramiro played by Maxim Mironov are all strong characterisations as appropriate to their roles. Thus Simone Alberghini brings a great deal of enjoyable and humorous exaggeration to the role of Dandini, Maxim Mironov brings a passionate desire to undo injustice to his role as Don Ramiro and Nathan Berg brings a young man's relatively inexperienced enthusiasm to the role of the prince. These portrayals work well dramatically and are all sung and acted with complete conviction.

The two sisters, Clorinda played by Raquela Sheeran and Tisbe played by Lucia Cirillo, provide an on-going element of comedy as Rossini intended and knock sparks off each other and also work well in this way with Dandini. Both these singers have a fine sense of comedic timing and so avoid heavy-handed overstatement. This makes the whole portrayal far more believable as well as amusing. Both are fine singers as well as actresses and are well able to match the equally gifted pair in the Houston production mentioned above.

Cinderella as portrayed by Ruxandra Donose, is a stronger character than usual and is able to stand up to her two step sisters as well as attempting to fight her cause with the baron before the ball. This is more acceptable as an interpretation than some weaker `servant' portrayals and is more in line with a modern woman and her generation's perception of the role of women of any sort. She brings a mature mezzo soprano voice to the part which fits in well with the stronger overall concept. Her technical control is excellent and she despatches her extended final aria with considerable aplomb without in any way losing her essential moral goodness and generosity.

The whole cast, orchestra and singers are driven at an exhilarating pace by Vladimir Jurowski. At times this must border on the vocal limits for enunciation of the words and it is with an element of jaw-dropping amazement that one witnesses feats of successful vocal gymnastics which still manage to just avoid being a touch too fast for effect. This is exhilarating stuff and one of the many wonders of the performance.

There are the usual bonuses from Opus Arte in the form of an illustrated synopsis and cast gallery. In addition there is a 25 minute documentary during which Jurowski and the producer,Peter Hall explain the ideas behind this production.

The camera work is totally involving and the imaging is crisp and offers good colour depth and definition. The sound is presented in full-range surround 5.0 and stereo formats and clearly reproduces both the vocal and instrumental detail.

This is a very fine modern alternative to the well-established older versions still available. It brings a considerable advantage in terms of recording technology and delivers an exhilarating musical and dramatic experience for the viewer. The audience clearly loved it and I would expect future purchasers to respond in the same way. For these reasons it seems that this disc must deserve a full 5 star rating.

Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:

I think this version is directly comparable to the Salzburg 1988 live version, with Chailly conducting, and Ann Murray in the title role.
Both have sumptuous sets, and very well defined social awareness of the plot. The principals are both well sung, with the Salzurg cast (Murray/Araiza/G. Quilico/Berry/Schone) having a slight edge over this present one, but only by a margin really. (U.S. review)",1351555200,,4627,5.156

8104279,4,B000E1P3BQ,"let's start with the good - fabulous ensemble singing, beautifully performed coloraturas, gorgeous traditional staging and design, wonderful costumes
i do agree with the reviewer who said jurowski is the star of this production - his conducting is brilliant, the perfect rendition of rossini. as others have said, it is crisp and precise, yet charming and colourful
special mention goes to maxim mironov as the prince, as well as raquela sheeran and lucia cirillo as the nasty sisters
and it was a fabulous idea (presumably by director peter hall) to dim the lights for the ensemble pieces - works a treat
i can say the sound on my blu-ray was excellent, and i had no issues - i was listening through sennheiser headphones
now for a few little gripes
overall the picture quality of the blu-ray is very good, although as one reviewer has pointed out, there is an unacceptable amount of grain in some scenes where lighting was an issue. there are also some jarring changes in colour, depending on which camera is used. in one scene it flips several times from golden yellows to clinical whites. surely this could have been addressed?
another reviewer has already mentioned that blu-ray is particularly unforgiving in many respects. i have to agree. it tends to highlight unflattering details - like glistening streams of sweat, or details in make-up, which can become somewhat distracting.
and it pains me to say it - for fear of being accused of being petty and small-minded - but i have to agree that ruxandra donose seems a little old for the role (again the unforgiving blu-ray), especially opposite someone as youthful as mironov. and i found her acting and facial expressions off-putting. she just wasn't my cup of tea
but otherwise this is a fabulous production, as we have come to expect from glyndebourne - and a superb recording.
a worthy addition to any opera dvd collection",1313884800,2,1883,4.869158878504673
8104280,4,B000E1P3BQ,"Jurowsky according to me is the star of this production, right from the overture to the finale. Yes, the singers have sometimes given him a few problems here and there, but overall, one of the best recorded Cenerentolas that I have come across. His rendition is crisp, clear and balanced throughout.
The Staging is simply superb. Thank god we do not have to content with abstractions, slacks and stuff. The sets and costumes stick to Rossini's period.
The singing is uniformly good, but not the greatest. One of the Cenerentolas that I benchmark for comparison is the one from Glyndebourne itself. Remember Kathleen Kuhlmann as Angelina (Cenerentola)? That one. Old, but really gold. Not that this one lacks in its approach, it is just that I liked the Coloraturas and singing of that production a lot better. Among the more recent ones produced, the one sung by Joy DiDonato and Florez and the Garancia and Brownlee are not as good overall as this one, although the role of Cenerentola is carried well by both DiDonato and Garancia.
I loved the two bad sisters in this one. They really show themselves as 'bad' which is 'good' for viewers and the production alike.

The clarity overall is good when stage is lighted well, but goes grainy where light is inadequate. I was wondering if they had sent me a DVD by mistake when the Overture was going on.,But happily, it redeems itself on stage.

Overall, a very good production,and worth buying for its own sake.",1301875200,2,1459,4.762845849802371
8104281,4,B000E1P3BQ,"This production reveals why the close ups of video and the increased detail of blu ray can be, in some cases, a mixed blessing.

First, the good.  This is a superb performance on many levels.  The conducting, singing, choreography and staging are at the very highest level.  And, the picture and sound are superb.  I would think that seeing this live from anywhere other than the first row, would be a rare and wonderful experience.

Second, the not so good. As wonderful an actress and singer as Ruxandra Donose is, up close, she appears to be the mother of the two sisters, rather than a younger sibling.  The other distraction, for me, was the costuming of Don Magnifico, the step-father.  At a distance, I'm sure the extreme filth and raggedness of his costume, wig and make-up adds to the baffoonish quality of his character.  Up close, seeing the wig and makeup peeling from his face and neck is not so appealing.  Minor quibbles but enough so that when I see this again on my home video, I will sit farther back from the screen!",1280016000,2,1035,4.576086956521739
8104282,2,B000E1P3BQ,Viedo excellent but audio reminds of early cold digital sound. I'm use to lp sound and my other blu ray operas are more than satisfactory.,1262822400,2,138,4.56
8104283,5,B000E1P3BQ,"What a joy it is to review a performance such as this! Everything works and the opera emerges as the truly great masterpiece it is.  Glyndebourne has a long history of doing well by Rossini from their early days. The great Italian conductor Vittorio Gui presided over celebrated revivals of Barbiere, Le Comte Ory, Cenerentola, L'Italiana..... Indeed if one were to list the ""specialties"" of the house, one can say that Glyndebourne serves Mozart and Rossini better than any other fare, and better than most other houses.  This 2005 Production of Cenerentola is no exception.

Vladimir Jurowski, the young conductor, has a marked affinity for Rossini.  His performance smiles and makes the London Philharmonic perform with a clarity, precision, and elasticity that unifies the performance and makes it quite thrilling.  One is aware of the amount of rehearsal that must have gone into this production as voices and orchestra are so perfectly integrated into a musical whole...... no mere accompaniment here. In many ways it is Jurowsky's show.

Peter Hall sets the action in period and it works very well.  As we all know, the magical elements of the Perrault tale have been eschewed, and what results is indeed, like Don Giovanni, a ""dramma giocoso,"" profoundly humane and very funny in a wise, mature way.  There is no room here for pratfalls and slapstick that so often marr Rossini performances. The sets are simple and elegant, and the costumes are subservient to the characters..... nothing exaggerated or gauche here.

The cast is uniformly outstanding: virtuosic singers, naturalistic actors, young and handsome.  One cannot ask for more.  Angelina (La Cenerentola) is the great Rumanian mezzo Ruxandra Donose; Don Ramiro (The Prince) is the remarkable young Russian coloratura tenor, Maxim Mironov.... he's still in his twenties. Luciano di Pascuale as Don Magnifico and Simone Alberghini as Dandini, play off each other superbly with subtle humor. The sisters are neither ugly nor charicatures...... they are spoilt kids caught in a charade they are destined to loose.

The blu ray presentation is superb.  Colors are clearly defined, variations in hues are amazing.  The sound is spectacular with air and separation between instruments like I have never heard in home video before.

In short, this is a great performance of a musical masterpiece by an excellent cast of a clever, elegant, witty, rich Peter Hall production, musically, brilliantly executed by  Vladimir Jurowski whose opera work one would wish would become more common in the USA.

Cenerentola is probably Rossini's most congenial, singualrly humane, opera.  Indeed it is a masterpiece, masterfully realized in this performance.",1252195200,6,2705,5.265734265734266
8104284,5,B000E1P3BQ,"This Glybourne production is highly enjoyable with the role of Don Magnifico sung by Luciano Di Pasquale an outstanding singing and comic success followed closely by the excellent performances of the two ""Ugly"" step sisters who are anything but ugly.
The title role of Cinderella sung by the very beautiful Ruxandra Donose was a bit of a disappointment to me. Perhaps her voice was deliberately kept low key as she was often outshone by the sisters although she did come out more strongly in the finale. Those with good surround sound systems will appreciate the dramatic storm scene in the last act and overall I have no quarrel with the audio quality. Very imaginative sets.
Rossini at his best and a great starter opera for those interested in coming to terms with the genre. Highly recommended.",1245542400,,798,4.875
