This, however, was in the early years with a big budget and MAJOR excitment.  Cinnamon plays a cosmetologist doing a plastic surgery job in front of a host of ""bad guys"".  The show is riviting with an unforgetable finale. If you're an MI fan this is a must see!",979862400,6,412,4.381578947368421

The gadgets and all the action and great storylines that never seemed to go over the top of the  viewer's crediablity. The remake of The original ""MISSION  IMPOSSIBLE"" t.v series wasn't that good i don't think it could ever  come close to the remarkable sucess of it's predecessor.",964396800,5,406,4.45945945945946
