4444956,5,B004Q4XZ26,"What a pleasure it was to see this movie. Raymond Burr and the complete cast
were great to see again.  The scenery and photography were beautiful, making
me think I was right there in Denver Colorado.

This movie was made in 1993, the year Raymond Burr passed away. What a great loss,
for not only was he the best actor, but generous and made the best wine at his
California winery. I have seasons 1-4 and cannot understand why seasons 5-8 have
not been released? I will buy them all if they will be released. I highly recommend
this movie to all that are Raymond Burr fans, and couldn't wait to see the next
episode of Ironside in the great late 1960's and 1970's!",1314748800,26,665,4.354838709677419
4444957,5,B004Q4XZ26,"I happen to be a Raymond Burr fan. His movies as Perry Mason and Ironside are excellent examples of his acting ability.

His films are made and acted well with great supporting actors/actresses and they are made in good taste with the lack of bad language and immoral graphic scenes.",1310256000,5,283,4.66

I like the originals better and wish they would carry the other 4 seasons in us format. please let me know if they ever do.

4444962,5,B004Q4XZ26,"I had always enjoyed the series, Ironside when it played. Raymond Burr was one of my favorite actors.
I enjoyed this Dvd mostly because it brought back the entire cast of the show, including Barbara Anderson

4444965,5,B004Q4XZ26,"For anyone who was not a fan of the original cop drama ""Ironsides"", this movie may seem a bit hokey and overacted. But for true-blue fans of Raymond Burr's 1970s series, it is a wonderful love letter that allows viewers to see everyone from the old team back in action once again. Good triumphs over evil and the bad guys get their comeuppance in the end, making me feel nostalgic for the good old days by the time the credits were rolling on this reunion movie! This one's a must for any ""Ironside"" fan.",1389744000,4,504,4.372340425531915

It is so good to see all of these great characters especially Ironside back together again! Nobody could ever play the perfect role of Ironside better than Raymond Burr! Of all the tough guy characters he used to portray and not only is Ironside tough but, firm he intends to get the job done and the criminals put out of action! I highly suggest buying this excellent movie! I promise you won't be disappointed! 10 stars and two thumbs up all the way! Ironside will live forever!",1365638400,,585,4.425925925925926
4444973,3,B004Q4XZ26,"Raymond Burr became a TV icon playing Perry Mason for nearly a decade (1957-1966), and quickly returned to television in Ironside (1967-75), another groundbreaking series.  Burr played Robert T. Ironside, the Chief of Detectives of the San Francisco police, who lost the use of his legs, after being shot in an assassination attempt.  Ironside's staff included female police officer Eve Whitfield (Barbara Anderson), and in need of a personal aide, the wheelchair bound Ironside recruited Mark Sanger (Don Mitchell), a young African-American man with a criminal record.  While these developments many seem insignificant now, back in 1967 they were progressive for prime time television.

Serving as a last hurrah for the original cast of the show, The Return of Ironside (1993) is kind of a bittersweet experience.  While it is a nice bit of nostalgia to see the distinguished cast together once more, sadly Raymond Burr was suffering from cancer, and did not have long to live.  The consummate professional, Burr gives a strong performance in one of his final roles.  Also appearing in the Perry Mason TV movies, Burr remained quite active until his death in 1993.  Barbara Anderson, Don Mitchell, and Elizabeth Baur, who all had not acted in some time, returned for this project, reuniting with Burr and Don Galloway.  Dana Wynter, appears as Ironside's wife Katherine.

Ed Brown (Galloway), an assistant chief in the Denver police department, asks the newly retired Ironside to serve as an advisor, after the Chief of Police is murdered.  Joining Ironside in Denver as his aide is Suzanne Dwyer (Perrey Reeves), the daughter of Eve Whitfield (Anderson).  Dwyer discovers that her boyfriend is involved with another woman, and when the woman's house blows up and catches on fire, Suzanne is suspected of killing her boyfriend, and his lover.

Eve arrives to support her daughter, and the crisis also brings Judge Mark Sanger and Fran Belding (Baur) to Denver, to lend their support.  Determined to prove Suzanne's innocence, Ironside resigns from the police department, and puts his former colleagues to work.  With Suzanne on trial for double murder, Ed Brown walks a delicate line, between duty and helping his old friends.

Centered on Suzanne, the story doesn't have the draw it might have, if one of the original characters was in jeopardy.  There isn't much of a connection to Suzanne, who isn't exactly the most sympathetic character.  Ed Brown and Ironside still have great chemistry together, but Brown being involved in Ironside's private investigation, is pretty ridiculous.  The attempts to integrate the original cast in the story are semi-successful, although characters often have little to do.  With everyone much older, the pace is a little slow, and the finale on a train is rather pedestrian, leaving quite a few a little short of breath.

The Return of Ironside is a nice reunion for the original cast, but much time is devoted to other matters, rather than on reestablishing old relationships.  While there is a bit of the old magic still present, with a clich ridden story featuring unscrupulous business activities, and crooked cops, this effort doesn't rise very far above average.  A small screen legend, Raymond Burr's later years were mostly devoted playing Perry Mason, and it's rather sweet that he also was able to play Robert Ironside one last time.

This movie has been released in region free (Region 0), and Region 1 DVD versions.  The region free version which sells for about $27, is also available at Amazon. UK where at the present exchange rate, the cost there is about $3.50 plus shipping.",1363737600,10,3631,5.082630691399663

4444975,4,B004Q4XZ26,"This was a pretty good comeback movie for the character Ironside, but sadly Raymond Burr passed away shortly after the movie was completed and so, no further sequels could be made. The movie was a good attempt to bring back a TV icon... Ironside. Some of the original cast came back to help too. The only thing that made me think twice about this movie was that the original Ironside series was based in San Fransisco CA and the comeback Ironside movie was set in Denver CO. Other than the change in location, the movie was pretty good.",1361577600,3,536,4.479591836734694

8437921,5,B004Q4XZ26,"I just recently bought this movie. For some reason I was looking up the Actor DON MITCHELL, who had played ""Mark Sanger"", ""Chief Robert T. Ironside's"" Assistant, played by the wonderful Actor RAYMOND BURR. I saw ""THE RETURN OF IRONSIDE"" in 1993, at least  I thought I did. I thought there was a chase scene in the movie. And I remember only seeing part of it. But after I viewed this movie I don't recall seeing any part of ""THIS MOVIE"" at all. From the beginning to the end I don't recognize any of it. I FIND THIS VERY ODD.

Reluctantly ""IRONSIDE"" temporarily takes over the DENVER POLICE DEPARTMENT, when his FORMER CHIEF AID, Ed Brown, played by ACTOR ""DON GALLOWAY"", asked him to, after the Former Chief Of Police is murdered. All of the original core cast were brought back, except ""Fran Belding"", played by ACTRESS ""ELIZABETH BAUR"", was added to the cast after ACTRESS ""BARBARA ANDERSON"" had left the show, continuing on for the next four seasons. BARBARA AND ELIZABETH didn't work together on the series. Since ELIZABETH was BARBARA'S REPLACEMENT, it was unusual that she should be in this movie. I'm thinking RAYMOND WANTED HER IN THE MOVIE. And according to ""IMDb"", BARBARA, DON MITCHELL, AND ELIZABETH, all LEFT ACTING AFTER THIS ""IRONSIDE REUNION MOVIE"". RAYMOND BURR FILMED HIS LAST TWO PERRY MASON FILMS: ""THE CASE OF THE TELLTALE TALK SHOW HOST"" AND ""THE CASE OF THE KILLER KISS"", shortly before he past away. On SEPTEMBER 12, 1993. DON GALLOWAY had a couple more ACTING PROJECTS before he went on to other interests. He past away on JANUARY 8, 2009. DON MITCHELL past away on DECEMBER 8, 2013.

The person who was behind the murder of the Chief Of Police came as a surprise for me. I won't say who was behind it for all of those who have not seen this movie, thereby spoiling it. But I will say: I wonder why was the Chief Of Police out at night on an Investigation with his wife? Since when do Police do that sort of thing? I found that odd, even if it is/was on a Television Movie. Also they didn't seem to give BARBARA, ""EVE"", and DON MITCHELL, ""MARK"", much dialog. I wonder, too, if DON MITCHELL was well. And the ACTRESS, PERREY REEVES, who played ""EVE'S DAUGHTER, SUZANNE"", had some really dumb dialog, like: ""Are you having an affair, are you, because if you were I'd kill myself"". OH BOY!!!

This movie and THE PERRY MASON MOVIES WERE FILMED IN DENVER. I read that RAYMOND LIKED FILMING IN DENVER, THE ATMOSPHERE, AND THE PEOPLE. Obviously they liked him too. The revenue that the movies brought to DENVER were tremendous. I read that by the time RAYMOND FILMED THIS MOVIE AND HIS LAST TWO ""PERRY MASON FILMS"" he could barely stand or walk. WHAT A BRAVE WONDERFUL ACTOR. All in All, this is a really good, decent film. It is literally about ""IRONSIDE"" going about trying to clear SUZANNE of the double murder of her Boyfriend, Police Officer Mike Quinn, played by ""JEFF KAAKE"" and the Police Officer Judy Bernardo, played by ""DARLENE VOGEL"". This is a VERY GOOD MOVIE. When I first looked this movie up to possibly purchase a copy, I think it was going for $50.00. I waited and later tried again. Then I paid about half of that because I bought it from a ""Seller"" and the price I paid for it was the least expensive, new or used. I don't think a lot of fans are giving up their copy of this movie to soon. Now all I have to do is really relax and pay attention to this movie. Maybe I'll realize that I have seen this movie.",1468108800,,3447,4.484076433121019
