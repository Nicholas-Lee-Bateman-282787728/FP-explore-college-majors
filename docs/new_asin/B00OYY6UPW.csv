6777200,1,B00OYY6UPW,"I did not like this move and I loved The Road and The Day..I am basically an end of humanity movie lover. The acting was fair, but the camera angles, etc. . .were horrible. Also, the MUSIC....OMG, did they raid some old 70's vault. The retro music in ""It Follow"" was super good, this music was terrible....it did not help the low production value. Steer clear of it!!!",1438300800,4,368,4.426470588235294
6777201,4,B00OYY6UPW,"I purchased this the other night when I saw one review for 5 stars. I doubted it would really be a 5 star post apocalyptic film and was right. Don't get me wrong, if you like this genre, it's not bad. It was a bit slow at times and lacked flair to give it 5 stars but had all the elements of a good post apocalyptic film.

I like how the movie kept moving through different places and terrain instead of staying locked up in a bunker somewhere. The story was good and acting was OK. I kept wanting more but it just wasn't there so I am deducting a star. I also thought it was a little short at 75 minutes. They should have added another 15 minutes of footage and tried to make it more memorable. Overall was worth the watch but it was no Book of Eli. As Simon would say... ""It was Forgettable"".",1437868800,4,794,4.057324840764331
6777202,2,B00OYY6UPW,"With the realization that just a ""Good"" movie is a rare find, it's become obvious that five star reviews are an immediate ""red flag"".
It's hard enough to find anything out there without sycophantic friends of the movie maker or actors padding the ratings..

That being said, To Survive, is a low budget Post Apocalyptic that never explains what went wrong and we follow a guy around as he bumbles and stubles into bad and good people. I've enjoyed plenty of low budget flicks, but low budget doesn't have to mean low intelligence. The number of bad decisions our struggling little band of dimwits make is really the problem here. Post Apocalyptic is the perfect forum for a low budget movie as far as minimal special effects, but these people are supposed to be survivors, and yes, we all understand that #$it happens, but c'mon!!!! (common sense issues with food, security and transportation are crucial in this genre)
There's a lot of ""Mehh.."" responses out there and unfortunately this movie falls in that category. I've seen worse for sure but unless Amazon makes this a freebie you should probably take a pass. There are some ""brief flashes"" of OK'ness, and who knows, with a few more attempts under the belt and an ear for constructive criticism this director might surprise in the future..

6777205,2,B00OYY6UPW,I could only stand the first 3 minutes. I gave it 2 stars because the music was beautiful and very well written. I wish the movie itself matched it. The music almost tricked me into thinking it was amazing.,1490832000,,206,4.3076923076923075

6777208,1,B00OYY6UPW,"Jonathan (Burt Culver) we discover is a former cop from flashbacks. He survives the apocalypse of unknown causes. He travels from Indiana to...(Filmed in Davenport, Iowa). He meets good people and he meets bad people who he has to fight and kill. They walk, they talk, eat, drive a vehicle, thank God and nothing to see here. Less exciting than ""The Road."" Almost seems like they went without a script and made it up as they went along.

6777215,3,B00OYY6UPW,"Well, I managed to stay awake and was somewhat entertained but it hasn't been that long since I saw ""To Survive"" and I have already forgotten most of it........and no I am not Alzheimic, To Survive is simply a forgettable item. If memory serves me right it was free with my Amazon Prime membership so at least I am not out anything other than the now $100 that Prime membership costs people for ""sometimes"" 2 day ""free"" delivery. The best part of the Amazon experience is their customer service department. If you are not 100% pleased with ANYTHING you obtain through Amazon they will bend over backward to make you happy. I do wish that they would STOP charging for some EXTREMELY old movies. The idea of having to pay at least $2.99 to rent ""The Searchers"" is beyond belief. And what is really weird is that one day an item will be rentable for ""free"" and then the next day it will cost you either $2.99 or $3.99 just to rent. They should open up more of their movie ""Vault"" to give Prime Members free access to viewing more movies of decent quality. The general ""free"" fare is generally lacking in quality of is so old it is public domain material. Come on Amazon, your stocks made enough last year to give your Prime Members higher quality no cost viewing. Give it a thought anyway PLEASE.

6777216,4,B00OYY6UPW,"There are so many bad low budget, B-picture post-apocalyptic films on Amazon. If you're into these sorts of films, you've probably seen your share as well. I'm giving this one a positive review for its good cinematography and locations. I am not sure it is 4-stars, but it's better than 3-star, so I voted up a bit. this is a very quiet film, it plays within the tropes of other post-apacalyptic films, but does it in a very understated way. I enjoyed the slow-paced script and it's good handling of subject material, which we have seen before in these types of films, both better and worse. here, the interhuman relationships are the focus. Very little blood and Gore and zero zombies or mohawked Mad Max-type bad guys. This is a small art house take on a survival film, not at all pretentious or trying to be more than it can deliver within its small budget. While I wasn't sold on the performance of the main actor and could find minor points to nitpick, I enjoyed it. And overall this script and the actors deliveries achieves some real emotion and feeling, which is more than can be said for many other films being made out there.",1451692800,9,1135,4.541463414634146

No of course not but it was OK. Acting was OK, no real special effects, plot was as good as any for the end of the world. I paid 1.99 to rent it and pass some time and it was worth it.

The background music drones on endlessly, and made its way into the foreground. I was unable to hear one of the characters dialogue because the music was louder. The movie was painfully slow, and the terrible acting made it much worse. This felt like an 8th grade film project.

8685582,1,B00OYY6UPW,"Perhaps hate it is too strong a verdict...the actors were QUITE good, given the limited and dreadful script they had to work with...and that is the whole story of the failure of this movie.  Some beautiful and relevant cinematography...some great acting...but why in the midst of this scenario would you abandon a stone and brick building, with hidden rooms AND a full food pantry, because a few fools were attacking?  Why wouldn't you fortify a few areas and maintain your shelter, given that it had adequate food and etc. for many months?  To further a weak plot line, our heroes abandon a safe shelter and food source, for???  Of course this results in some manufactured drama, and at least two more deaths...additionally. for more ""how to die in the post apocalypse"", they return to the building they originally abandoned to get more food...with one tiny bag to fill...and then there is the scene failures...at one moment, they are carrying two gas cans...then, in the next, magically, three...ditto with back packs and other belongings...in one scene, two adults and a child stay behind to pack up useful essentials from a house they slept in...but then jump in the newly found truck with none of the same?  This whole movie is a survivors nightmare, because I can't begin to list the errors these fools make, driven by a poorly written script that serves no one, not the weak story line, not the actors, and certainly not those paying to watch this movie.  What a wasted opportunity to tell a great story...someone has no writing chops, at all.  Pretty much a waste of time, due to same.",1502668800,,1593,4.791970802919708

We aren't specifically told the reasoning or the cause that led to this new world either. The music throughout bothered me. Every time they tried for ominous I heard a faint alarm clock sound which bothered me. It does have some good cinematography here and there which is a redeeming quality. Than the ending.
