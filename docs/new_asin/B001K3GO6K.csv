3662989,4,B001K3GO6K,In no way does this deserve the negative review before me. It's short but you can make this as intense or easy as you like. I do most of it with a 10 lb kettlebell and make all of the cardio high-impact. This gives me a great workout in about 35 minutes. Gin is friendly and cues well.,1236556800,11,285,3.9310344827586206
3662990,1,B001K3GO6K,"""I was not impressed with the Power Abs Medicine Ball workout. I think I was overcharged for the video and I had to buy the medicine ball seperate. What I did not realize, was that my medicine ball came with a 24 minute workout that is awesome! The total cost of medical ball and workout video from Walmart was $11. It is way better than the Gin Miller's Power Abs workout DVD that I bought. I should have bought the ball first and not wasted my money on this DVD.""",1236211200,7,465,4.177777777777778
3662991,4,B001K3GO6K,"It is a good workout because it is different but not a ""killer"" workout.  It indirectly works your core but the specific ab exercises are not that difficult.  I would say that your legs are going to be the place that you feel it the most and maybe some shoulders.",1233532800,11,263,4.24
3662992,5,B001K3GO6K,a very good workout love it.,1413936000,,28,3.8333333333333335
3662993,4,B001K3GO6K,Good workout for getting acquainted with how to exercise with a medicine ball. Encouraging to have options for levels of intensity of exercises,1412553600,2,143,5.260869565217392
3662994,4,B001K3GO6K,Good for all fitness levels.  Works all parts of the body and gets you breathing.  A good workout.  No complaints.,1397692800,2,114,4.6
3662995,4,B001K3GO6K,"I find myself coming back to this one with my medicine ball, rather than the DVD that came with the ball, because the workouts are of the right intensity, meaning that I'm able to complete them and feel I spent the time well.  The exercises are actually quite enjoyable.",1387238400,3,270,4.510204081632653
3662996,4,B001K3GO6K,Good workout with a medicine ball.  Start with a light ball though unless you are in great shape.  You will see great results in the waist.,1386288000,2,139,4.3076923076923075
3662997,5,B001K3GO6K,Nice circuit workout with the ball.  Two levels to choose from to get the workout you want.  You can work up to the higher level.  Good instruction on how to use the ball and prevent injuries.,1361404800,4,192,4.277777777777778
3662998,5,B001K3GO6K,"I'm a senior who works out to keep fit - and this video certainly helps me do that! I like using the medicine ball for some switch-up in my routine, and the length is just right to ensure that I get my workout in before work. Any longer and I might find a reason for not doing it!

And I really like Gin Miller. She motivates me, and I feel like she cares about the people who use her products.",1353110400,7,394,3.925
3662999,5,B001K3GO6K,"This was my first Gin Miller workout DVD which came with Medicine Ball (6 pound). I love how she makes the viewer feel so comfortable and at ease throughout the exercise program, and if you are uncomfortable with some of the moves, she suggests you put the ball down and go through the moves without it. What's really unique about this DVD the camera work  - it shows three different types of footwork you can do during the cardio segment and profiles her from another angle while she is doing the various exercises. Her assistant, Jamie, does the work out with her and modifies some of the moves. They are a good team together. I enjoyed Gin so much I purchased her Kettlebell workout and look forward to adding many more of her exercise DVDs to my collection.",1317168000,11,761,4.5144927536231885
3663000,5,B001K3GO6K,This is one of the most fun workout DVD's I have come across in a long time. I worked up a sweat and looked forward to working out again.,1289606400,5,137,3.7586206896551726

8314176,4,B001K3GO6K,"The workout is really good. As previous reviewer said, the music is loud and awful, and the video keeps switching from widescreen to box office which is annoying. There is only one workout and for the price, I am used to my exercise DVDs containing 2 or 3 workouts.  Ok overall. I also want to try the Stott medicine ball DVDs.",1498262400,,327,4.360655737704918
8314177,1,B001K3GO6K,"I would return this DVD had I not purchased an Amazon Used one for $3.82 plus $3.99 shipping.  It's not worth the shipping cost to return it.  The first thing you notice when you play this workout is the LOUD synthesizer that plays OVER the instructor's voice.  It's a deafening repetitious beat, NOT music, that is so annoying that you want to turn it off.  Even if the noise was not present, the workout would be a waste of time for anyone other than those at a VERY beginners level or in recuperation.  I strongly recommend you consider a different DVD than this one just for the LOUD noise alone...you will find yourself turning it off after the first few minutes of play and never turning it on again.",1485302400,,706,4.441860465116279

8314180,5,B001K3GO6K,"I love this workout!  The music is great, cues are easy to follow and the exercises are hard enough for challenge, but not overwhelming.  I try to do this workout 1 to 2 times a week as a break with other DVD workouts.  This is not just an Ab workout, but a full-body workout.",1467590400,3,276,4.074074074074074

The music is a wee bit irritating in some places but generally the beat keeps you going.  I think I did not like the music in the ab workout.  Just for feedback",1456531200,,252,4.659090909090909
