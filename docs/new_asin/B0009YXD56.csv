8598277,5,B0009YXD56,"I found this DVD to be extremely comprehensive in helping me learn about the HVR-Z1U and HDR-FX1.  I wouldn't have learned as much about my Z1U if I hadn't bought this DVD.  I have found no other training DVD that is this helpful.  These guys know how to make a training DVD.  I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in learning all they can about these cameras.  The more you know, the more you can do.",1164672000,,414,4.324675324675325
8598278,5,B0009YXD56,"So many training DVD's these days are hastily put together with low quality equipment and little insight.  This DVD is different.  If you are one of those people that hates to read instruction manuals and would like someone to visually show you a full discovery tour of the product, this DVD is for you.  It covers just about every function on the Sony HDR-FX1 and HVR-Z1U HDV cameras, and the production values are very high.  This DVD enables you to get quickly up to speed on the functions and use of Sony HDV cameras.  A must buy for anyone who owns or is thinking of owning an FX1 or Z1U HDV camcorder.",1127606400,5,607,4.383928571428571
