She is just so lovable and this volume touches base with her a lot. It explains who she really is and her connection to Yuichi. I would have wanted to know the specific amount of bonus material on the DVD before buying it, and this doesn't have a lot. It contains 4 episodes.",1239062400,,409,4.061728395061729
8240437,5,B00114UUPO,"I first became aware of the TV series Kanon on YouTube.  Since then I have downloaded all 24 episodes of the 2006 version with subbed English.  Then I found the English language version on the video file sharing entity veoh.  I knew that I had to own them. This is volume #3, in which Yuichi's relationship with Makoto grows more complex.  Of all the women in Yuichi's life, Makoto is my favorite, followed closely by Shiori.  Also in this episode, the character of Mai is developed and presents complications to Yurichi.  The main problem with the release of this English version by TBS Animation is the limited availability.  I hope they realise the popularity of this series and re-issue it.  If you like Kanon, or Air, or Clannad, this should be a 'must have' to your anime collection.",1231372800,,789,4.666666666666667
8240438,5,B00114UUPO,"This volume concludes the ""Makoto Arc"" and begins a new one, ""Mai Arc"".  The Makoto Arc ends in a dramatic fashion where Makoto starts regaining back her memories which then leads her to completely lose human traits.  Afterwards the attention is then focused towards Mai.  Now not much is known about Mai, as the only thing we know so far is she fights against spirits that dwell in the school late at night.  Another thing we know is Mai does not like to talk a lot and she has gotten herself a reputation within the school and it's not a good one since she tends to be accused of destroying school property.  In order to improve her image, Yuichi decides to have Mai go to the school dance and he succeeds in convincing her to go.  All is well until something happens at the dance and that concludes this volume.

I have to say after watching 3 volumes of Kanon so far so good.  Though this volume focused more on Mai and Makoto, other ""main characters"" did get some spotlight and that is important for the later arcs.  I particularly enjoyed the scene between Nayuki and Ayu when they met for the first time, even though Ayu has been eating at Akiko's place for some time.  Also, Yuichi begins to learn a bit more about Shiori and pretty much you can guess that will be the next arc after Mai.

I highly recommend this volume for those who have been watching Kanon thus far.  If you have not been watching any Kanon, please purchase and watch volumes 1 and 2 before viewing this volume as it will not make much sense.

P.S. I would have done this review early if I had gotten volume 2 with box earlier than later.  Also, the ending credit claims that volume 4 should be out around April, but according to some reports it looks to be sometime around May.  Remember this is not confirmed news.",1206921600,3,1794,4.377643504531722

Kanon volume 3 continues the high standards and production values of the previous to volume. This first half of this volume concludes Makoto's section story, and it's here that the series' story really shows its polish. The second half of the volume begins Mai's part of the story, as well as providing more insight into Yuichi's relationship with Ayu as a child.

Overall, volume 3 is another solid entry in the series. And as has become the custom, the ending of this volume should make you want to come back for volume 4.",1206835200,2,555,4.595959595959596
8240440,5,B00114UUPO,"( This isn't Keith Carlson, it's his kid.) These are my favorite episodes, in which I call ""The Makoto Arc"" This features Makoto Sawatari, a girl who lost her memory. I won't spoil the ending. But, I will tell you that this anime has WONDERFUL art in it. Makoto is my favorite character in Kanon. So when her arc ended, I cried and cried. These are wonderful episodes. I swear, you will love it..",1205798400,6,396,4.364864864864865
