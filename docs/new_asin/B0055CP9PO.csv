4573973,5,B0055CP9PO,Laugh out loud hilarious. If you were ever a fan of David Wain's work or have ever watched the show Stella this is definitely for you. Episodes are very short and there is about 3 hours of content. Lots of familiar actors and typical Wain humor.,1347753600,,245,4.3478260869565215
4573974,5,B0055CP9PO,Really fun to watch these back to back.  Its a hilarious show with tons of famous guest appearances.  The DVD extras made this purchase well worth it.,1346112000,,150,4.518518518518518
4573975,5,B0055CP9PO,HILARIOUS!! If you like the state or anything with David Wain you'll like this. Well worth the money even if it free on-line.,1344297600,,125,4.478260869565218
4573976,5,B0055CP9PO,"This is a remarkable set for its' humble asking price. Thirty-two hilarious episodes of Wainy Days with a fun and somewhat informative ""Pajama Party"" wraparound created just for this DVD presentation. If you are familiar with David Wain's other efforts this purchase requires little deliberation. If you haven't seen The State, Stella or any of his feature films, then I would probably recommend you purchase one of those along with this DVD and start there.

Also of great interest are the shorts included. They perhaps don't make much sense for inclusion chronologically, but it's cool to see some of David Wain's early directorial work and for that they are a great selling point of this disc.

I should note that the audio commentary was recorded piecemeal with different guests on the various shorts. It is pretty informative as far as I heard, but unfortunately it starts to get out of sync after a certain point. I doubt the likelihood of a replacement disc being authored and manufactured. One can only hope the commentary audio will be made available as a download someday. However, that is a small blemish on an otherwise fantastic disc that is clearly a jam-packed labor of love.",1343347200,,1190,4.91542288557214
4573977,5,B0055CP9PO,I love the quick wit of David Wain plus all the guest cameos. I like how he has a post episode episode it is good stuff.,1334016000,,120,3.6538461538461537
4573978,4,B0055CP9PO,"If you're a fan of any of David Wain's work, you'll like Wainy Days, plain and simple. It's hilarious. However, if you're checking this Amazon page out, you probably already have seen the show, as it's available for free online. And if you haven't seen the show, just go watch it. It's really free. The whole thing. So go watch it.

I'm glad I bought the DVD, because the extras are a lot of fun, and it's a good way to support the project. However, my only gripe is that the video quality is pretty much the same as you get online. So the later episodes that look good online look good here, and the earlier episodes that look like bad online still look bad here. I was hoping said episodes would've been remastered, but unfortunately they haven't. Maybe this is just the highest quality source available, and the raw footage is unavailable, who knows.",1331510400,11,853,4.503225806451613
8458087,5,B0055CP9PO,"Absolutely I'll give it five stars. A labor of DW40's love, and it's funnier than your favorite show on tv today, I promise.",1439683200,,124,4.434782608695652

8458089,4,B0055CP9PO,"I binge watched these over Christmas, I had purchased the DVD for my brother and was given 30 days to stream them on prime. Since it was a web series the episodes are all under 10 minutes so it was basically like watching a long movie. I thought it was pretty funny but I probably should have broken it up into smaller portions.",1390953600,2,328,4.222222222222222
8458090,4,B0055CP9PO,Son-in-law was very happy with this gift.  Guess he'll let us know when he has a chance to read it.,1388102400,,99,3.95
8458091,5,B0055CP9PO,This DVD is great.  I loved Davids other projects like The State and Stella and this was not disappointing.  Incredibly funny.,1378598400,,126,4.9523809523809526
8458092,5,B0055CP9PO,"If you like anything David Wain and these guys have done, you'll love this. Some of the funniest mini-episodes you'll ever watch.",1376956800,,129,4.909090909090909
8458093,5,B0055CP9PO,"Hilarious! Tons of episodes, plus bonus footage. A huge hit with me and my daughter (we have a weird sense if humor!)
Excellent cast.

8458096,1,B0055CP9PO,Should have been called Lamey Days.  I suppose it is my fault for not knowing it was webasodes but I like David Wain stuff when he isn't on camera.,1350432000,,147,4.068965517241379
