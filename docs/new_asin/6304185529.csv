7866181,4,6304185529,"I was very pleased with the Kirov Ballet's Swan Lake...I especially liked the 4th Act with the beautiful harp music and both white and black swans used in the choreography! Fabulous!  This is segment of the 4th Act is particularly difficult music to find and I would like to know if a CD is available of this entire version?  There are music excerpts here that are not found in other Swan Lake ballets.

 I was most impressed by the corps de ballet and their precision and strength.

An excellent DVD to add to any collection!",1152316800,2,526,4.494736842105263
7866182,4,6304185529,"Miss Mezentseva is the ultimate russian balleria. She conveys such fragility in her presence, such humanity in her movements that you are sure that what you are seeing trancends the riguers of training and style. But rather you are face to face with  her soul which she reveals with such candour and frankness. Miss Mezentseva is regal yet is longing for her princes love. She is fragil yet powerfull. It is in these paradoxes of charachter that we identify ourselves. She is not a bird inlove with a prince. She is his equal! A princess inlove. One human being rescuing another and shering a common love. All this is what she brings to you and more. The beauty of the russian school, almost too beautiful, and the integrity and humility of the human spirit which has found love. Miss Mezentseva's dances from the edge of her fingertips when she joins the prince in the famous pas de deux to her points. She is a dancer of such poise and purity, she is so completely devoid of mannerism that one knows that this is the russian school at it's most sublime never seen before or since!",1088640000,6,1082,4.5487179487179485
7866183,5,6304185529,"Over the past 40 years, I have seen many live and several taped versions of ""Swan Lake"".  The Kirov production with Yulia Makhalina and Igor Zelensky is magnificent.  This is ballet at its consummate best.  Having also studied ballet, and danced on point, I can appreciate especially the flawless, expressive and consistently demanding choreography.  Makhalina may not convey the emotional depth in the same way as a Fonteyn or a Makarova, but her every movement conveys the sensibility of an Odette and just as effectively an Odile.  Ballet is clearly her passion.
  I believe that this splendid production on video owes much to its director Colin Nears.  With so many elements at work, he has quite successfully maintained a balance that enables us the viewers to enjoy the ballet as if it were a live performance and we were in the orchestra.",1042070400,6,845,4.901408450704225
7866184,1,6304185529,"I have since raised the score a bit on this DVD although I still can't recommend it except for the curious.  So, notwithstanding the bump-ups on some of the categories below.  I have not disturbed the headline to this review.  I have given scores 1.0 to 10.00, the latter corresponding to perfection.

DVD Video: 3.0 - dull transfer of shabby 1986 Soviet Production is blurry, grainy, and shoddily directed.

DVD Audio: 2.0 - has a very annoying tape hiss that can be very distracting during the quieter numbers.

Production: 0.00 - Dull and way dated.  Probably unchanged since the first production.  Ideologically this makes sense I guess because Swan Lake was created for this company, now calling itself the Kirov.  Unfortunately, the choreography is rote and too willing to cling to orthodoxy.  This amounts to something entirely uninteresting to look at. The worst thing about it is that it seems there was no effort to justify this recorded performance, which is decidedly contrary to just about every other Swan Lake available on DVD.  Examples include the over-prominence of mime and the relative aimlessness of the principle male dancer.

Galina Mezentseva (Odette/Odile): 8.5 - I have revised my opinion on Ms. Mezentseva's dancing.  On further viewings, I found her technique to be precise and moving.  Still, it's hard to believe in her performance. She just doesn't seem to be into it, a situation that I believe is consistent to the cold war image of what Russian life was like - ideological and intensely dull (an oxymoron but accurate).

Konstantin Zaklinsky (Prince Siegfried): 4.5 - KZ was probably a pretty good dancer in 1986: good looking, nice long legs;the problem is, he doesn't get to do anything with them (he has one bit in Act III where he gets to do a once-around with grand jettes (impressive).  That's basically the only moment he's allowed to shine.  But he's a decent partner.  He seemed mostly bored.

Corps:  8.0. - Pretty solid in a late soviet-era sort of way.  Lots of technique.  Little joy.

Orchestra:  3.0 - The violin soloist in the Act II pas de deux is quite moving.  Best I've ever heard on this music.  Ditto some of the wind soloists.  The rest of the orchestra is little more than passable.

DVD content - 0.00.  Herein lies the single most annoying thing:  This package contains ZERO information (in English), on the case, the insert, or on the DVD itself, apart from the names of the two principles.  No mention is made of what the name of the orchestra is, who conducts, what year the production was made.  Some of this information is available in the end-credits, but it's in Russian, so...  I gathered from my very humble ability to sound out Russian characters that the Academy Orchestra of the Kirov Opera/Ballet was conducted by Yevgeny something-or-other.

There is really no excuse for this DVD with the possible exception of Mezentseva who has great technique but doesn't connect very smoothly with the music.",1029456000,47,2970,4.874
7866185,3,6304185529,"On a purely technical note, the DVD is in Dolby Stereo, not Dolby 5.1 so the sound was not all it could be. Also the video was grainy, not sharp as to be expected for a DVD. I am guessing this is just a transfer of the VHS version without any remastering to take advantage of DVD's features.",1021680000,12,291,4.0344827586206895
7866186,5,6304185529,I have seen Mezentseva and Zaklinsky dancing in Giselle.  Mezentseva is my favorite Giselle.  Their Swan Lake is excellent. This is probably the best Swan Lake on DVD.  I like this one better than Nureyev's.  This DVD is a must for every ballet fan.  I can't wait to see their Giselle on DVD.,1006041600,12,292,4.433962264150943
