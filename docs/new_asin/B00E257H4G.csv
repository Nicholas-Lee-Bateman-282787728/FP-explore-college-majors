8600392,5,B00E257H4G,"This porn remake of the Al Pacino classic, Scarface, gives the under belly of society, and social standards at present time in whole, its due. While some actors/actresses would fail at doing their best imitation of Al Pacino, Carmen Luvana,(Pirates,O The Power Of Submission)Adam & Eve's hottest Contract Star, suceeds with flying colors. The cinematography and camera angles are dead on and everything sticks to plot, more so than mainstream legit films.

  If you are looking for porn flicks that keep the viewer satisfied and on the edge of their seat, not to mention xxx films with themes, get this film. I highly recommend veiwing the extras, they are worth watching.

With an end note, I recommend you pick up 'Pulp Friction' an Adam and Eve Pictures spoof of Quentin Taretino's masterpiece, starrring Ava Rose, John E Depth and Evan Stone.",1190419200,,846,4.9787234042553195
