2078301,5,B0002D126G,Whether you are new to fly casting or having problems casting  this DVD  is a must-have. It is very informative. Lefty  is one of the best if not the best fly rod casters out there.,1239062400,3,181,4.114285714285714
2078302,5,B0002D126G,"I actually met Lefty at a sportsman expo in California and he's a very funny and colorful guy.  This was the DVD that Lefty personally recommended to me (a relatively new fly fisherman).  I couldn't agree more.  Lefty explains and shows the mechanics of properly casting with simple fluid motions.  Prior to watching the DVD, I tended to fight the rod and line.  With the DVD format it made it easy to repeat the sections I wanted to review and practice.  With a little practice and Lefty's instruction, fly casting has become significantly more enjoyable and my distance and accuracy has improved dramatically.  Highly recommended for novices or anyone who wanted to learn how to improve the quality of their casting.",1168387200,15,718,4.884297520661157
2078303,2,B0002D126G,"A fly fisherman as famous as Lefty Kreh deserves to be featured in a great video, one that helps him share his knowledge and expertise with all of us who'd love to learn from him.  Unfortunately, this DVD fails badly, but I don't blame Lefty.  He's obviously an authentic expert who is chock full of great info that he'd really like to share.  I blame the production company.  After all, it's their job to represent the viewer's interests by making sure that the audio is clear, that every shot is properly framed, and that every statement is understandable, helpful, and relevant to the overall message.  Unfortunately, they failed to do that, and as a result, I'm not sure I learned anything in return for the $30 I plunked down on this.  For starters, Lefty talks fast, and since the director didn't pick up on this and ask him to slow down, it's almost impossible to absorb his point before he's rushed on to three or four others.  Worse, the cinematography is amateurish.  Too often the cameraman uses a wide shot while Lefty is talking about (and trying to illustrate) some subtle aspect of his grip, or he's talking about his line, but it can't be seen because it's completely out of the frame.  But the biggest problem with this video is that it lacks a coherent, systematic, overall plan.  Instead, it jumps from topic to topic with no apparent rhyme or reason, and there's not even a thorough discussion of a basic cast!  Beginners should avoid this video, because it will leave them confused and frustrated.  Try Joan Wulff's DVD, the Dynamics of Fly Casting, instead.  It's great!  Experienced anglers may learn a thing of two from this video (especially from Lefty's discussion of casting techniques for various ""real world"" situations).  But they'd better be prepared to work hard, because it's tough to extract the info that Lefty's doing his best to share.",1162425600,29,1872,4.752321981424148
2078304,5,B0002D126G,"This is a fantastic video.  I've watched it 3 times already, and my casting is significantly better than before.  I've been fly fishing for 4 years, and this video did more to improve my casting than any time I've spent with a guide or at a clinic.  It also costs much less than an hour with a guide.

The techniques covered have improved all the fishing I do from trout and sunfish on my 4wt up to muskie on my 9wt.  I get better presentation and better distance on all of my casts.  I'm also more efficient so I can cast for a few more hours with the 9wt without getting tired.

Lefty's presentation is very straightforward and clear.  My wife even thought that the video was good enough to sit down and watch with me.",1159315200,9,720,4.242647058823529

8026541,5,B0002D126G,"This is the best casting rod to practice on and it makes for perfect fishing with our real casting rods for fly fishing.
We practiced on this for days and just knew we were going to have fun doing real fly fishing and by golly, we had a wonderful
weekend of fishing and catching our limit. This is the best thing ever. I say this, because I am in a wheelchair and a lady, so
for me to really get the knack of fly-fishing from my wheelchair on the edge of the bank was perfect!! And Joe is  a great
fly fisher. He goes all around casting and catching. I have to admit he caught the most fish. I caught 2 tho!! I suggest if anyone
really want to learn to fly fish, they should get this video and the fly fishing rod (Plastic but affect for practicing anywhere). It
sure gave us insight to how we should do it and we accomplished a great fishing technique Thanks to Lefty Kreh.",1392336000,,874,4.111111111111111

8026543,5,B0002D126G,Lefty Kreh always amazes me. There is so much great information on this DVD that I will have to watch it over and over to get it all absorbed. He has covered almost every situation you would ever be in and he does it so easily. I would highly recommend this for flyfishermen of any skill level,1368835200,,293,4.157894736842105
8026544,4,B0002D126G,"Lefty Kreh is a grand master of fly casting and I have always found his books excellent with their principles and explanations.  This video did not quite match my  expectations. I would have liked more shots of Lefty himself casting (preferably from different angles) since I find learning by imitation particularly helpful. More advice on details of how to practise would also have been welcome.

This being said I have benefitted from watching the video several times.",1286064000,3,470,5.077922077922078
8026545,4,B0002D126G,This was a used dvd I ordered from the seller. I received the product in a reasonable time frame. It was in good condition as advertised. The dvd was well-produced and offers a comprehensive demonstration and explanation of the topic.,1280534400,,234,4.875
