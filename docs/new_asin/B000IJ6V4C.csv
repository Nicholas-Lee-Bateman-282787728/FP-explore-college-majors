8145653,3,B000IJ6V4C,"I was sort of disappointed by the bellydance portion of this DVD.  I watched a youtube performance by Dawn before purchasing, and was looking forward to getting this DVD, but her form is not always correct (ex. her head bounces back and forth a lot during the 3/4 shimmy). It uses a fast techno sort of beat instead of middle eastern music, and the moves are not always in time with the beat.  During the hip drop section she'll be counting by 4's or 8's, but doing 5 drops...  The voiceover, music, and movement just don't always match.  I wouldn't recommend this as an instructional bellydance DVD for beginners because of these problems, and an intermediate dancer will probably find the moves too simple.  That said.. I really enjoyed the pilates workout section of this DVD.  It's challenging, enjoyable, and short but still effective.  I'll add it into my workouts.",1171152000,4,871,4.766666666666667
8145654,4,B000IJ6V4C,This workout is fun and is actually a workout! I have had the video for a few weeks now and still haven't gotten bored. I like the bellydance part because I feel like I am in a real class.  And I am hooked on Pilates now. My husband has even noticed. My stomach is flatter and I feel great. I am looking forward to her next video!,1167696000,2,330,3.925373134328358
