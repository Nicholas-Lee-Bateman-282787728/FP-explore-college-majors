Then we have a guy who's trying to preserve the Krynoid plant. A guy named Keeler who becomes one of the hosts of the Krynoid becomes gigantic plant. Then we have a few of the Doctor's friends who tell him about many of the things going on. And we can't forget the Doctor and Sarah Jane.

722991,4,6303631932,"Ask someone who is not a great fan of Dr Who - but who nevertheless watched some of it in their childhood - what stories they vividly remember, chances are this story is one of the three or four that stand out. ""The Seeds of Doom"" is deservedly memorable. It is a terrific, gripping story that is more than a little inspired by The Avengers and Quartermass. The story is well developed, with the first two episodes taking place in the Antarctic (with the exception of a few close-ups of styrofoam, most of the snow shots are passable). Episode three sees the action change to England and the grounds of Harrison Chase's mansion. This shift in action keeps the basic plot fresh, simply transplanting the location. Indeed, the scenes in the Antarctic are probably the most gripping, while Harrison Chase's presence is virtually kept in the shadows for these two episodes, before he is presented as the main enemy. Tony Beckley's performance as the obsessed millionaire is wonderfully camp. The story also has other well acted characters. John Challis is brilliant as the cynical mercenary Scorby. He is sadistic, ruthless and determined; when he has to join forces with the Doctor and Sarah in episode five, Challis shows a new side to his character without compromising his self-centredness. The cautious botanist Arnold Keeler is another well portrayed character - in particular the scenes when he is slowly changing into the second Krynoid are disturbing. He pleads with Chase, but the millionaire is prepared to sacrifice him in order to see the monster develop. Kenneth Gilbert as the embittered Dunbar is the other standout performance. He sells the secret of the Krynoid to Chase; his realisation that what he has done was wrong is a quiet moment that says a lot. He has caused all this and it is up to him to do what he can to redeem himself. These individual quirks, which ensure the characters are not just catalysts of the action, is one of the core reasons ""The Seeds of Doom"" works so well. Added to this, the regulars, Tom Baker and Elisabeth Sladen are also at their best. Baker in particular has some extremely physical moments you would not expect from his laidback, humorous Doctor we are all used to. Two scenes in episode three spring to mind vividly - when he knocks out the chauffeur and when he twists Scorby's neck in a headlock. The whole story is also suspenseful - when Keeler says ""It's like waiting for a time bomb to explode"", that about sums up the atmosphere. There are some brilliant cliffhangers (episode three especially!) and the Krynoid monsters are quite well done. The scenes of it atop the mansion in the final episode are particularly remarkable. There is only one problem with the story - the final two episodes seem to sag. They are not as gripping or exciting as the first four. There is less suspense and more action, when the reverse is far more fitting for this type of story (and indeed what makes the first four episodes so good). The ending is also very rushed, and quite a disappointment - the final outcome seems all too easy. However, as a whole, ""The Seeds of Doom"" is very worthwhile.",970444800,,3137,4.726277372262774
722992,5,6303631932,"This is my personal nomination for the best story in the Doctor Who canon. It works on many levels. On one level, it is a very serious story, with a  great script, good actors delivering the lines, and some inspired  direction. The Doctor and companion Sarah Jane Smith remain under credible  threat for most of the story, and there are some stunning  cliffhangers.
At the same time, the foundation of this story is composed  of every single clich from the James Bond movies, the Avengers and The  Thing. Harrison Chase is a quintessential Bond villain. Scorby is the  quintessential Bond henchman. The Thing provides the bulk of the plot for  the first two episodes, and the Doctor and Sarah make a credible Steed and  Mrs. Peel. All of this is intentional, allowing you to enjoy the story on a  serious level, and also to appreciate the jokes.
Quite simply, a great,  multi-layered story. A must see for casual Doctor Who viewers.",967420800,,932,4.726708074534161
722993,5,6303631932,"This is the best six-parter story in the creation of Doctor Who!  The whole adventure is utterly engaging with no padding whatsoever.  Its strength lies mainly in the very strong performances from Tom Baker, (who  appears to be really enjoying himself in this one!) and Tony Beckley as  Harrison Chase.  Beckley plays the role of the plant-obsessed millionaire  with the perfect degree of cold detachment.  The Doctor himself is just  about the most violent and physical he has ever dared to be - punching and  fighting everyone left, right and centre!  Perhaps this is not traditional  Doctor Who, but who cares!  Even after being viewed repeatedly, this story  continues to hold up very well and is always extremely entertaining.",960422400,3,731,5.042016806722689

723136,5,6303631932,"We love this one.  It's got everything, Antarctica, a fancy house, an artist, a man obsessed with plants, and an alien plant that takes over humans to speak to the plants.  It is a little bit intense, especially when the humans go through their transformation into the plant.  Actually, that's hard to watch.  But the plot is never ending and fantastic.  Dr. Who is very active in this one, he punches someone and jumps through a window.

I can imagine some people nodding in sympathy with Mr. Chase, the multi-millionaire who identifies with the plants against the humans.  Mr. Chase has a composting machine that would make any gardener very very happy.  And he composes (really bad) music to communicate with the plants in his greenhouse.

723212,3,6303631932,"This story starts off well, with an ancient, dormant seed pod found deep in an icepack.  An evil plant collector finds out about it, and sends his heavy to steal it.  Once the story gets back to England, things begin to slow down a bit.  The Doctor and Sarah Jane do a lot of running in and out of the baddie's mansion, and the army is shown as totally inept at stopping the contents of the pod... which ends up just a wee bit larger than expected.

The idea of all the plants on Earth joining up to take over the planet and use humans as food is rather interesting.  The man who plays the plant collector does a good job, and Tom Baker is always entertaining.

Oh, and stay away from the compost machine...",1375660800,,707,4.2
723213,5,6303631932,"""The Seeds of Doom"" is a very good example of the Fourth Doctor at the height of his game. The story begins in the Antarctic were alien ""pods"" are discovered. This portion of the story is almost like the movie ""The Thing"" in that we have a Antarctic base threatened by an alien creature. Soon the story moves to England, where the alien threat is only part of the problems the Doctor must face. The main adversary becomes an eccentric plant-loving criminal millionaire who is reminiscent of a James Bond villain. He and his henchmen must be overcome as well as the danger of the alien Crinoid that threatens all the animal life on Earth.",1373414400,,637,4.547826086956522

723216,5,6303631932,"This serial from the Tom Baker/ Sarah Jane years is an absolutely brilliant one. The serial's first two episodes resemble the classic horror movie, ""The Thing."" After that it resemble a sort of pre-epidemic 28 Days Later. The acting is awesome, and the characters are powerful. One of Tom's best!",1327708800,,296,4.94
723217,5,6303631932,"The Doctor and current companion Sarah Jane Smith are called in to serve as advisers on a recent discovery made by some World Ecology Bureau scientists down in Antarctica. It seems that they found a bizarre-looking seed pod in a layer of ice and think it is extraterrestrial in origin. The Doctor confirms this when he recognizes the pod as belonging to a Krynoid, a parasitic alien weed. He and Sarah Jane race to Antarctica by helicopter (not by TARDIS, weirdly) only to find they're too late: team member Winlett has been stung and infected by a vine which grew from the pod after it thawed out, and it is slowly transforming him into a half human, half plant monster.

Krynoid pods always travel in pairs, the Doctor says, and sure enough, he, Sarah Jane and Stevenson, one of the scientists, unearth a second pod from the ice where the first one was found. He resolves to keep it frozen. Meanwhile, Winlett escapes and kills the man assigned to guard him. He begins stalking the base, endangering the Doctor, Sarah Jane and Stevenson, the only ones still alive.

Their struggle for survival is going to get a lot harder, though, because a dissatisfied World Ecology Bureau pencil pusher takes information about the seed pods to rich plant collector Harrison Chase and tells him where the research base is in exchange for lots of money. Chase, deciding such a pod would be an excellent addition to his collection, tells his henchman Scorby to go to Antarctica and retrieve the pod: and to eliminate anyone who gets in his way!

One of the most taut and suspenseful Doctor Who serials, with complication mounted on complication adding to the growing dilemma. And the sequence in Antarctica is only the first two episodes of a six-part serial! Needless to say Scorby succeeds in his mission and brings the pod back to England, and after barely escaping from Antarctica, the Doctor and Sarah Jane have to deal with this too, and the ornery Chase, who absolutely embodies the ""Screw the rules I have money!"" mentality, is hellbent on the Doctor not taking away the newest addition to his plant collection. Of course, the Krynoid pod stings someone else, turning them into a mutant plant monster threatening mankind, and things just keep escalating and escalating.

This is a fabulous DVD with a wealth of extras including my personal favorite, the audio commentaries! There's one for each of the six episodes of the serial, with everyone from Tom Baker to the actors who played the redshirts who wind up as plant monster fodder eagerly participating. If 1979's City of Death got me hooked on Baker's Doctor, then it is this serial with solidified my love of classic Who.",1326758400,,2670,4.785249457700651
723254,5,6303631932,"A rich and unscrupulous plant collector acquires an alien seed pod (after the first one is destroyed) from an Antarctica scientific outpost which, of course, subsequently invades the bodies of human victims, developing them into botanical monsters.

But don't think for a moment that this notable Doctor Who entry lacks for originality in any way. This particular episode incorporates some fine cinematography and great locations into a notably compelling yarn.

In overall quality and cozy ambiance, I would compare this episode to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Pyramids-of-Mars-Story-82/dp/B0002F6BSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: Pyramids of Mars (Story 82)</a>, particularly in regard to the time spent by the characters inside the mansion, and on the estate of, an old English manor house property. In any case, the sets are terrific and the story never lags. Certainly the villain comes off in attitude as the ultimate sociopath as his own joy blossoms when the hormonally-driven alien pod reaches out to touch his scientific minion, relegating the poor devil to life as a fast-growing plant monster.

This is certainly one of Tom Baker's best performances as The Doctor and I can highly recommend it.",1320710400,2,2410,8.517786561264822
723255,5,6303631932,"""The Seeds of Doom"" hails from a golden age in the history of Doctor Who, a period when the show's producers raided the toy box for virtually every classic sci-fi monster ever created and presented their own distinctive versions of them. ""Seeds"" borrows heavily from ""The Thing from Another World"" and ""The Day of the Triffids"": scientists uncover two alien seed pods under the Antarctic permafrost, and a genteel but utterly deranged plant collector sends his henchmen to steal one of them and almost unleashes a worldwide apocalypse.

Tony Beckley turns in one of the iconic performances in the series' history as Harrison Chase, the megalomaniacal botanist determined to free the world's vegetable life from human oppression. The seed pods infect humans, transmuting them into giant carnivorous plant creatures that feed on human flesh and bend other vegetation to their destructive will. The first of these Krynoids is blown up before it can escape the Antarctic, but Chase unleashes a second one back in England where it soon engulfs his stately mansion (shot on location at Athelhampton House in Dorset, then owned by a prominent MP and formerly used as the setting for the 1972 film ""Sleuth"").

""Seeds"" is loaded with uncharacteristically strong violence, with even the Doctor packing heat and characters being fed into a mulcher like something out of a Coen Brothers movie, but there's no denying this is classic Who. The Special Features include a 37-minute ""making of"" documentary as well as informative pieces about the story's musical score by Geoffrey Burgon and the behind-the-scenes roles played by the production assistant and production unit manager. Also included is a continuation of the ""Stripped for Action"" series, looking at the development of Doctor Who comics. The Doctor really broke out during this period, going from a crude, one-page feature in TV Comic to a full-blown weekly comic magazine by Marvel U.K.",1303603200,2,1935,5.178913738019169

There they face Scobie (a hit man who runs around a lot with a gun but never fires a single bullet during the entire story.)

The tale quickly changes to that of a mystery as The Doctor tries to discover who has the pod and where it is in hopes of keeping it from infecting someone and feeding on all animal life on Earth.

723258,4,6303631932,"The Seeds of Doom represents an excellent end to the 1976 13th season of Doctor Who. It was originally slammed for being too violent, but in spite of some silly concepts a good adventure featuring Tom Baker's portrayal of the Timelord's 4th incarnation. This 6 parter has lots to offer, some typical of Doctor Who and some more likely found in a Bond movie, for example: brutal hired gunmen (Bond), a psychotic organ-playing mastermind bent on world  domination ( Bond) for vegetables (Dr. Who), a mysterious seed from space ( Dr. Who) a mission to an antarctic research station to recover it (Bond) bound hero about to be mulched is taunted by villain (both Dr. Who & Bond).
In fact the Doctor is entered into the story in a fashion reminiscent  of 007 meeting M for a current assignment ( of course Bond would never play with a yo-yo in M's office). Mr. Richard Dunbar of the World Ecology Bureau shows the Doctor photographs of  a pod removed from the permafrost  after laying there for twenty thousand years. The Doctor eventually decrees the pod a dangerous extraterrestrial known as a Krynoid and the game begins. Unfortunately Dunbar has sold the location to the Mad Millionaire Chase, who considers it his mission to protect the plant life of Mother Earth, and such a valuable specimen  as the pod could easily disappear.... for a price. The pod is naturally a threat to all animal life on Earth.

The Story has lots of interesting characters like Chase's henchman Scorby, whose bullying of his partner Keeler, is as entertaining as Mr Chase's own over-the-top performances. Other quirky characters like Amelia Ducat, one of the world's leading flower artists, who aids the Doctor in getting into Chase's estate to stop his evil plans for the Krynoid. The Doctor even teams up with UNIT for one last time (until his 7th incarnation) although sadly neither the Brigadier nor any recognizable UNIT regulars appear.

All the violence aside... ""Seeds"" is a solid Dr. Who serial with some great moments. Just as
Chase soon asks ""What do you do for an encore, Doctor?""
His response.....""I win.""

723259,5,6303631932,"This is as good as classic Who gets. This is not only the best story of the Hinchcliffe/Baker years (and that's saying a lot) but also among the top 5 stories of the entire original run. It's well-paced enough to satisfy even the new-Who viewers. Although it's a 6-parter it's divided up into distinct segments. The first two episodes are set in the Antarctic and are a definite homage to 'The Thing' while the remaining 4 episodes are set back in England and are a mash-up of 'Day of the Triffids' and 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers', Doctor Who-style. Baker's Doctor is at his most alien, often cold and callous and Elisabeth Sladen is in top form as Sarah Jane. Although tame by today's standards, it had a high horror quotient for the time and was the most violent story of the Baker years with The Doctor involved in hand-to-hand combat that would make Pertwee proud and at least two characters being ground up for plant-food.

This gem has been held back from DVD release for too long while loads of dross like 'Horns of Nimon' and 'Timelash' got to market first. Now if only they would release the remaining Hinchcliffe/Baker stories.

DVD Description
When scientists unearth two seed pods deep in the arctic permafrost, the Doctor and Sarah Jane rush to investigate. Soon the Doctor's worst fears are confirmed: the pods house Krynoids, one of the most parasitic and dangerous life forms in the universe. One of the creatures has already infected a scientist and now a hideous monster is rampaging through the Base, intent on total destruction.

When the second pod is stolen amidst the escalating carnage, it is transported into the hands of insane botanist Harrison Chase. From his mansion in England, the plant-obsessed Chase will allow the pod to split open. Both the ruthless millionaire and the rapidly growing carnivorous Krynoid are intent on infecting and destroying our entire world...

from the cover. It's a classic with outstanding dialog.

Two plant pods from outer space are found in the antarctic.
The doctor goes there to check it out. But a millionaire plant lover wants the pods. He sends his hit man to the antarctic. The plants germinate and become a big danger to the earth.

The movie starts in the antarctic and the rest is in the millionaire's mansion. Besides the Doctor and Sara, the millionaire and the hit man are also very interesting characters. It's a great movie.",1268006400,,562,4.5

723353,5,6303631932,"Way to go Tom(Tom Baker), you did a fine job.  This adventure was really something to admire from start to finish.  It was an incredibly well written biogical masterpiece.  The doctor battling against killer plants, there just are no words to justifiably convey how cool that really is.  -(Triffids anyone?)

A point of interest pertaining to this adventure, is that it was produced during the height of Doctor Who.  That high status started right at the end of Jon Pertwee's reign, and continued to about the mid-point of Tom Baker's tenure.  Subsequently, each adventure during that time period are a must see, and quite possibly a must own for collectors.  If you like your DW adventures a little on the dark side, you won't be disappointed.  This adventure in particular has a serious and sinister tone throughout the entirety of the show.  While, even though Doctor Who targeted the horror section, it rarely was very scary.  But this one actually was a bit.  A rare and interesting trait of this Tom Baker adventure.  Simply a classic.

723354,5,6303631932,"The ""Seeds of Doom"" is my particular favorite in the Tom Baker Series.  It has everything I look for in Dr. Who Series.  Most memorable is the character development of the guest cast members, which is allowed to blossom over six episodes.  From the ""Mad Veggie"" Chase to the ""thuggish"" gun for hire Scorby and the ""unforgettably wimpy"" Keeler, there are plenty of characters to latch onto...  The humor is also plentiful and Tom Baker seems to be at the top of this game in that area with far too many great quips in this one to mention here...

The story overall is well developed and really gets you wanting to see the next episode immediately, which is when Dr. Who works best for me.  The concept of plants vs. humans is not an original one from Dr. Who as it has been done in various sci-fi venues but they do come up with a very good twist on it here.

To me, this is one of the trilogy of Dr. Who - Tom Baker episodes that are a must see/buy for any Dr. Who fan or someone who wants to learn about this interesting world as they are very accessible.  The other two gems being ""The Brain of Morbius"" and ""Horror at Fang Rock"".",1108771200,5,1132,4.232558139534884
723355,5,6303631932,"Is this the best episode of Baker's seven-year run as the Doctor? Quite possibly. Certainly it is up there with ""Horror of Fang Rock"" and ""The Talons of Weng Chiang"" on my list of personal favorites. All of the elements which made the series so good are here -- terrific chemistry, Gothic horror, campy dialogue, over the top villainy, and of course that all-purpose English manor, which appeared in about 17 episodes and which I think actually belonged to Mick Jagger (it gets blown up at the end, but that doesn't mean we've seen the last of it).
I have to say the criticisms of this episode that I've read seem silly to me. Bad special effects? When were the effects in this series ever good? In my view it has only two flaws -- it's too long to watch comfortably in one sitting and there are way too many escapes and recaptures, the Doctor & Sarah spend half the episode getting tied up and the other half escaping, and there is a ridiculous Dr. Evil moment where the villain, Chase, devises an elaborate and horrible death for the Doc and then leaves the room, allowing him to escape, instead of just shooting him....sigh...don't these crazy bad guys ever learn?) -- but they are pretty minor in compared to what works.
""Seeds"" begins at a lonely scientific research station in the Antarctic, a la ""The Thing."" And just like ""The Thing"" the bumbling scientists unearth something from the ice that would better have been left alone. In this case, a large seed pod. They send pics back to London, where the Doctor identifies the pod as a sentient alien plant called the Krynoid, which has unlimited growth potential and a big appetite for human flesh. He and Sarah make tracks for the South Pole to make sure the ticking green bomb stays frozen and harmless. Unfortunately, the bumbling scientists put the thing under a lamp, and before you can say ""Good god, what is that thing?"" one of them is infected.
More unfortunately, a flora-crazed English millionaire named Harrison Chase (beautiful performance by the late Tony Beckley) has also learned of the pod's existence and sends a sneering mercenary named Scorby (another terrific turn by big John Challis) and a biologist named Keeler to collect it by force.
""Who"" always excelled at loosing multiple plot elements at each other like bumper cars, and the crash-bang of the first two episodes of ""Seeds"" is great, creepy fun, as the good and bad guys square off while the infected scientist, now essentially a large angry yucca plant, wanders around strangling people and not caring whether they are good or bad. And just when you think it's over -- bingo, another pod appears. D'oh!
Eventually the action shifts back to England, where Scorby has delivered the second pod to the crazy Chase. He orders Keeler to feed it, and poor Keeler ends up doing just that, in a nasty case of ""being consumed by your work."" Meanwhile, the Doctor and Sarah blunder around the huge mansion and grounds, getting captured and escaping so many times, you wonder why Scorby doesn't just shoot them. Eventually, however, the Krynoid (nee Keeler) gets loose, grows to gigantic proportions, and starts eating Chase's employees en route to germinating hundreds of pods which will destroy the world (or at least everything not made of salad materials). The climax comes with the Doc, Sarah & Scorby trapped inside the crumbling mansion being hunted by the completely loco Chase, while UNIT soldiers fight the Krynoid outside. One small drawback is that while this is another UNIT episode, once again, there's no Brigadier and no Benton -- that's kind of like a peanut butter sandwich with no jelly. You can do it, but why?
""Seeds"" is a great episode with some tremendously wonderful dialogue (""Don't be silly, Sarah -- of course he has to kill us, we keep interfering!"") that also brings up nostalgia/horror for 1970s fashion -- c'mon, where else can you see a bad guy in zippered platform boots, a turtleneck shirt and a jacket with a butterfly collar....without a time machine, that is?",1079481600,23,4020,4.785611510791367
723356,4,6303631932,"The final story of Season 13 more or less ends the Gothic motif of Doctor Who--well, not quite; there would be Season 14's Jack The Ripper story, The Talons of Weng Chiang.  The Seeds Of Doom is a take on The Thing From Another World crossed with The Day Of The Triffids (murderous plants).  It's also the last UNIT story until Battlefield (1989).
A mysterious pod found by a research team in the Antarctic draws two parties.  One is the Doctor and Sarah Jane, sent there by Richard Dunbar of the World Ecology Bureau.  He feels sure he recognizes the pod, and says ""it might still be ticking.""  The other is Scorby and Keeler, respectively a ruthless and armed thug and squeamish botanist.  However, an accident has happened.  Winlett, one of the base personnel has been attacked by a shoot from the pod and transformed into a monster, half man/half plant.  Actually, Winlett was halfway towards turning into a Krynoid, an alien plant.  And that's bad, because as the Doctor says, ""On most planets, the animals eat the vegetation.  On planets where the Krynoid gets established, the vegetation eats the animals.""
After a narrow escape, the Doctor and Sarah trace another pod back to England and to the estate of millionaire Harrison Chase, someone's who boasts the finest collection of plants in the world.  He's such a plant-lover he calls bonsai ""mutilation and torture"" and calls it ""the hideous, grotesque Japanese practice of miniaturizing shrubs and trees,"" and his mission is to protect the plant life of Mother Earth.  Not only does he play some hideous music to his plants, but he has a composting machine that pumps all organic matter into the garden.  As Sarah says, ""I've heard of flower power but this is ridiculous.""
The process starts all over again when Keeler gets attacked by the pod, and here, Chase's fanaticism to his plants is evident, as instead of taking Keeler to the hospital, keeps him under observation, feeding him raw meat so he can evolve into a full-grown Krynoid.  And how large do those things get?  About the size of St. Paul's Cathedral, according to the Doctor, and when that happens, the Krynoid will germinate, and it's up to the Doctor to prevent that.
There is one unforgivable goof at the end of the story.  Sarah mentions the Doctor forgetting to reset the TARDIS coordinates, but they arrived in Antarctica by helicopter, not by TARDIS.
The giant-sized Krynoid and the humanoid variation are well-realized design effects.  The latter kind, where the human features are totally gone and tentacles sprout, is actually one of the costumes of the Axon monsters from Claws Of Axos painted green.
Of the guest stars, Tony Beckley comes out on top as Harrison Chase, a totally ruthless plant-lover who puts the survival of Krynoid above his fellow man.  ""Yes, the plants must win.  It will be a new world, silent and beautiful"" he says, which is topical to the 70's with its smog, traffic jams, and noise.  His trance-like communication to the plants shows him totally gone.
Chase's mansion was actually Athelhampton House in Dorset and was also the same place used in Sleuth starring Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier, and the on-location shooting on the grounds made a good change.
This is one of the more violent stories, with guns fired, brandished, or pointed in threatening positions, mostly by Scorby, and even the Doctor carries a gun (though he doesn't use it).  And the Doctor gets embroiled in some action and fisticuffs.  In one scene, he crashes through a glass skylight to prevent Sarah from being tortured, punches Scorby, and rescues his friend.  Chase wryly asks, ""What do you do for an encore, Doctor?""  The Doctor answers, ""I win.""  Which he does, of course.  Still, a great story with good location and the end of a season that consolidated Tom Baker as the Doctor.",1077840000,8,3824,4.826687116564417
723357,5,6303631932,"This is classic Dr. Who, but it had some props against it. The first two episodes were hastily added on to a standard four-parter because a previous story idea fell through at the eleventh hour. Despite the quick addition of material(how does the Doctor finally get the TARDIS to go where he wants for a change?)it blends together well. It is one of my favourites on many levels, the cinematography, makeup, effects, plot, acting, i remember it fondly- except when eating my broccoli.",1020211200,,484,4.843373493975903
723358,4,6303631932,"Set entirely on present-day Earth, this episode features Sarah (Elisabeth Sladen) and the Doctor (Tom Baker) at the height of their partnership.  Gone is the tired old plot element of trying to get Sarah back home; by now these two are an inseparable team -they take on gunmen, sneak past armed guards, finish each other's sentences, and almost seem to enjoy taking turns rescuing each another.
The serial is longer than your average Doctor Who episode -six chapters instead of four.  The premise is nothing new but is still downright creepy -slow but inevitable alien possession of a human being.  The Krynoid itself, though at the low end of the BBC's already low-budget monster scale, is photographed in such a way as to make it far more terrifying -a glimpse of writhing tentacles in the moonlight.  The suspense elements are played up -the hissing rattle in the dark just outside the window, the dark halls of an Elizabethan manor house, curling creeper vines that strangle their victims, and an eerie violin soundtrack.  Besides the Krynoid and its supporting army of killer Earth plants, you get two center-stage villians: Chase (Tony Beckley), the eccentric millionaire who fancies himself the great protector of the entire plant kingdom; and Scorby (John Challis), the hired mercenary-turned uneasy ally.  Sarah's verbal dressing-down of Scorby is priceless.
Tom Baker is in top form in this episode -he bullies civil servants around, crashes through skylight windows, coldcocks armed henchmen, and even packs both a sword and a gun (though Sarah points out he would never use the latter, he grins and replies, ""True.  But they don't know that, do they?"").  Though the story does briefly feature an appearance by UNIT forces, none of the Pertwee-era UNIT regulars are included.  My favorite character in this serial is the scatterbrained floral artist Amelia Ducat (Sylvia Coleridge), who goes from comic relief to vital plot link and back to comic relief again.  The miniature visual effects are, by Doctor Who standards, actually quite impressive -you get not one but two climactic moments in which entire buildings are obliterated.  Not a milestone episode for Doctor Who overall, but a must-have for Tom Baker fans.",1017878400,7,2228,5.110192837465565
723359,5,6303631932,"This really is a great episode, combining aspects of ""The Thing"" with a gloriously improbable story about plants taking over the world that would have seemed ridiculous under any other circumstances. But as described by Tom Baker's Who, it is a believable and convincing threat and we are actually concerned about the characters involved who get trapped in the Meglomaniac's gothic mansion in a scene borrowed from ""Night of the Living Dead"" as they nail boards over the windows. As with the best of the Who stories what makes this one click is not the Monster [looking at various times like a man who has been smeared with Gardenburger and a huge, quivering glob of vegetable lasagne] but the concise characterizations of the principal players. My favorite is the wonderfully named Scorby [he doesn't even have a first name], a mercenary type that would just as soon kill everybody and be done with it. His final crackdown isn't too convincing -- anyone who has seen combat in ""Africa, the Middle East, you name it ..."" wouldn't go spare if a few creeper vines started cracking the glass, but his exit scene is a true inspiriation. Parts of the story  rely on what can be referred to as an Idiot Plot where people wander off to be locked outside with the monster or idle by the examination table to be contaminated by something they already know is dangerous, but whatever. I love the arctic research base set and the general air of apocolypse, and hearing Baker recite lines like ""Waffle ... Waffle! Waffle! Waffle!"" is exactly why I watch this stuff in the first place. Highly Recommended.",1007164800,,1592,4.768115942028985
723360,5,6303631932,"I have to admit that I'm partial to the Seeds of Doom because the fifth segment was the first episode of Dr. Who that I ever saw.  I was only seven or eight at the time and the sight of evil, intergalactic plants taking over unwitting human beings was one of the most terrifying that I had ever seen.  Well years later, the image isn't quite as scary but the story and the performances still hold up remarkably well as the Doctor (played here by Tom Baker) and Sarah Jane Smith (one of my favorite companions -- an opinion that is apparently shared by many fans) confront insane, plant-obsessed millionaire Harrison Chase (played to cold perfection -- and with an admirably serious air -- by Tony Beckley) and the evil alien fungus that he has unwittingly brought back to life.  This seriel was written by a veteran of the Avengers and, as such, doesn't play so much as a traditional installment of Dr. Who but instead as an especially elaborate Avengers episode in which Patrick McNee has been replaced by Tom Baker and Diana Rigg by Elisabeth Sladen.  As such, the Doctor is willing to engage in hand-to-hand combat with Chase's henchmen and more time is spent on espionage than the usual fantasy and philosophical metaphors than longtime Dr. Who fans might expect.  No matter for the change in pace is handled well by both Baker and Sladen and the seriel comes across not as an abberation but instead just a rare chance to look at another side of the Doctor's universe.  Even with a longer running time than most of the Tom Baker seriels, the Seeds of Doom is still a remarkably quick paced adventure that holds up remarkably well and is a great deal of fun for both fans of the show and, dare I say, nonfans as well.  With its many twists and compelling cliffhangers, the Seeds of Dooms is reminiscent, in many ways, of the classic seriels from the early days of cinema and, for me personally, ranks closely behind The Talons of Weng-Chiang amongst the best of the Tom Baker years.",1005782400,51,1985,4.558988764044944
723361,4,6303631932,"...Brigadier Alastar Gordon Lethbridge Stewert.  And the regular Units.  All we see of UNIT(interacting with the Doctor) is some guy that gets chopped into plant food.
Except for the first part, this show has no good guys(except the Doctor and Sarah and the Krenoid at early stages of transformation).  The 'story compagnion' is a hitman and somewhat of a bully and want's the chance to off the Doctor and Sarah.  I do like the main villan, Chase, however.  He is definitely that, and this makes it easier to have a virtually goodguyless show because everyone looks like saints compaired to the mad man, Chase and his faithful butler.  Both are tollerent of each other and want to put everyone into the compost heap and kill all the animals so plants can take thier rightful place.
This is a good story with the exception that thier is a lack of good guys to help the Doctor. Two Government officials eventually come around at end of part six, however.  It does show the Doctor can always prevail, regardless of the circumstances.  He has, after all traveled the Universe.",1005696000,,1072,4.725806451612903
723362,4,6303631932,"This isn't a terribly traditional Tom Baker story - it's six episodes long, it's got an unusually high quotient of action, and the action take place in plain old modern-day (well, modern at the time) England. It actually feels rather more like a high-quality story from Jon Pertwee's era, thanks to all of those elements as well as the environmental slant.
Even if the story is segmented (the first two episodes take place in Antartica and form a 'mini-story'), it's a rollicking good tale with lots of fun and excitement. Tom Baker is on the top of his game as an unusually fist-happy Doctor, and even Lis Sladen gets a good piece of the action. The guest cast are also of a high standard, and the music by Geoffrey Burgon is again a  welcome change (his scores for both ""Terror of the Zygons"" and ""The Seeds of Doom"" are on the ""Terror of the Zygons"" soundtrack CD).
There are a few downsides to this adventure. The bridge from the Antartica episodes to the England episodes is rushed at best, leaving you wondering why the Antartica material was so necessary. UNIT is called in - for no readily apparent reason - in episode six, without any of the regular UNIT characters...and that's UNIT's last semi-regular appearance! What happened there? Also, the various growing forms of the Krynoid plant creature are rather negligible, particularly the gigantic version.
