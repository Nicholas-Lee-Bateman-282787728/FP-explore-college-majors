8269369,5,B0018C7YZS,"I bought this video because it is hard to keep motivated to exercise and I thought that I needed something more enjoyable than walking on a treadmill.  The dances in this video were definitely upbeat and fun to learn.  Victoria goes through each of the dance steps slowly at first before putting them all together in the end for a nice workout routine.  However, the beginning part where you are simply learning the steps is a workout in itself.  Victoria does the ""lower"" impact version of the dance and her partner does the more advanced version, which you can then switch to when you have advanced to a more challenging workout.  Victoria's great energy and enthusiasm while she dances makes you feel as though you are dancing with a friend instead of working out, unlike many other dry and monotone aerobic instructors on video.",1240704000,,832,4.75
