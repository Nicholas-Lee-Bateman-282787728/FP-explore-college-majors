8497253,5,B006FZCLIS,"I ran across this show while flipping channels on Sunday night and really liked it. Since it's out of Canada, I don't think too many Americans know about it. It's witty and fun and the cast is super. I now have all four seasons and can't wait till
 season  5 comes out.",1400284800,,269,4.153846153846154
8497254,5,B006FZCLIS,"Bought this as a gift for a friend, I already purchased my own copies back a while ago. Love this show, the characters are great and the feel of my hometown of St. John's, Newfoundland is very much there. The amount of guns and crime scare me a bit, but this is a work of fiction and that's just part of the fictional side of everything. Great job Mr. Hawco!",1379203200,,358,4.128571428571429
