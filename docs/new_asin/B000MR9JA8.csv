This isn't some boring, bland, by the numbers instructional DVD. Its a full course straight from hollywood in how to master this movement, which falls somewhere between mime and hip-hop.

2739385,4,B000MR9JA8,"AWESOME BUY!!! A NEW APPROACH TO DANCE INSTRUCTION- NOT WHAT YOU EXPECT!

I bought this DVD because I was tired of learning to do the robot by watching old 80s videos and the scant variety of instructional videos currently out in the market.

Here's why this DVD is GOOD- the art of breakdancing or roboting, for an amateur dancer, is often best taught through easy-to-follow motion technique, not formal education. ""How to Do the Robot"" achieves this very well. Here's why this DVD is AWESOME- Tyson, the DVD instructor who is in great physical shape and has amazing skill, combines an almost stand-up humor approach to doing the robot. There is no lack of dance moves, so you won't feel cheated or undersold. Some parts appeal to a bit more ""mature"" audience in terms of the jokes but I expect this to be quite appealing to younger dancers as well, hands down. So prepare yourself for a bit more candid humor that sneaks in periodically. It will definitely keep you paying attention.

Pros: You can skip to any chapter and pick up a dance technique.

  Instruction is comprehensive, starting out with the beginners moves and working towards more advanced

Also a pro- Tyson inserts full routines throughout the instruction to demonstrate how it should look once the moves are mastered. This is very cool- this guy is really talented.

Cons: Was hoping to hear a lot of cool 80s breakbeats and rap during the instruction video but its mainly dialogue and movement. Once you watch it once through with Tyson speaking, watch it again with music in the background for a real practice session to music.

Spoilers- Don't read if you plan on buying the DVD:

There is also a really funny skit at the end of the DVD under extra footage - it features Tyson and the Elastic Illusion dancers in a supermarket entertaining shoppers. It's hilarious! One of the dancers does this slow motion running thing down one of the isles that defies gravity, worth skipping to when you pop in the DVD. I wish there was more of that, but maybe that will be on their next DVD. I hear that another DVD is on the way from other members.

WARNING, watching may become addictive. Whether you're into the robot or not, it's fascinating to watch.",1171497600,4,2216,4.67095115681234
2739386,4,B000MR9JA8,"A friend recommended this to me, and I had no idea why.  Sure, doing the robot would be interesting, but where would I ever use it?

But now that I've watched it, I totally understand.  For me, the specifics of actually doing the dance moves are secondary.  What I found to be incredibly useful was the posture and muscle control the instructor teaches.  Standing up straight and always being conscious of the tenseness of your muscles gives  that air of confidence and power that is so handy in all areas of life - interviews, dating, etc.

And not only will you control your muscles, you'll build them.  While actually having a surprising amount of fun.

This DVD may not have all the whooshes and fancy graphics of other instructional videos, but the content itself is great.  I can't tell how much a dancer would get from it, but I definitely learned a lot.",1171411200,5,861,4.568627450980392
8171058,3,B000MR9JA8,"For the most part the Dvd is pretty good. The parts that actually show Tyson--the instructor--are very helpful. There is no doubt he knows what he is talking about and he is a very great dancer. However, lots of the movie is advertising his friends or believe it or not the movie, The Secret. Which is about quantum physics. I would rate this dvd with 5 stars in a second if it didn't get off subject or advertise other crap. He even shows your around his appartment and the dirty sponge he uses to clean dishes with. Worth seeing the dance parts. You can find them on Youtube.",1313280000,,577,4.351851851851852
8171059,4,B000MR9JA8,"After years of searching the web for a good Robot Tutorial i stumbled upon Tyson Eberly's dvd. I was skeptical 1st because his sample clips on youtube was extremely retarded and not funny at all. Its like watching a sorry excuse for stand up. But after i really try to watch some of his clips ive learned a lot of useful things. The good thing about it is that he went over 26 useful lessons about the robot. The bad thing is that he didn't go in dept with his lessons and only teach at a introductory level. this video wouldve been great if he provided more examples on his lessons. i forgot to mention the excessive advertisement and goofing off was a wasted of time. i find myself fast forwarding a lot. Good news is this video will teach you what you wanna learn, especially if your into popping, hip hop, freestyle,etc. Ive been popping for a few years now and i really learn how to dimestop correctly. If thats what your looking for then this is it. I recommend this video to anyone who wants to take their dancing to the next level.

ps. i bought the video on demand version for 9.99. so if your not looking to spend almost 20bucks then you should buy it through video on demand on amazon.",1271808000,3,1196,4.315555555555555
8171060,2,B000MR9JA8,"I suspect that many of the other reviews for this product were written by friends of the dance troupe that produced it.  It stars Tyson, who is very charismatic and might have been able to pull off the lengthy, unscripted monologues that make up most of this video if he wasn't exhausted from partying late the night before (a fact to which he makes reference numerous times).  He does a good job showing the dance moves, and is a very talented dancer.  All in all, you can definitely learn to robot dance from this DVD if you can bear the extremely unprofessional production.",1247788800,3,576,4.572815533980583
8171061,5,B000MR9JA8,"This Instructor Tyson Eberly is a very talented Robot dancer. He starts out with tips on posture, and how to isolate different joints of the body. He follows it up with different exercises and practises that one can do to move like a robot. There are movements for arms, hips, torso, neck, walking etc. And tips on Dime stops, jerks, Probing etc. Althogh I am total beginner, I didn't find it very difficult to follow thanks to the excellent instruction.

The material might not be suited for kids less than 13 because some of the language and humor used and partial nudity on some of the funny stuff they show. Also it was interesting that they ran a clip about the ""Secret.tv"" in the DVD. Wasn't clear if it was an ad for ""Secret. Tv"" or just something the instructors wanted to share because it helped them manifest their desires? There are also some amateurish shots of their living room and his roomates, which is pretty humorous.

At the end of the DVD, there is a clip on the performance give by Tyson Eberly, in a competition in Japan. The performance is really good and entertaining. Overall, 5 stars! Very instructional and entertaining!",1229299200,,1147,4.645320197044335
8171062,1,B000MR9JA8,"I bought this dvd based on the many positive comments on the Amazon web-site, but after purchasing it, I am convinced that the creators must have made them up (there is NO WAY anyone can genuinely think all of those positive things about this dvd).  This video is so outlandishly amateur and useless that I had to fast-forward through most of it, and I never turned it on again.  Worst of all, the ""trainer"" thinks he is funny, but isn't. It's painful to watch. I really wanted to learn the robot, but this did not help.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!",1218844800,,548,4.405940594059406

8171065,5,B000MR9JA8,Wow- I am so happy with this amazing video- it TOTALLY surpassed my expectations.  Tyson is the best teacher- it feels like he is really talking just to me.  I especially loved the gluteous maximus isolation lesson- so precious!  I am new at this but have always wanted to learn to do a convincing robot to be the envy of all my friends and now I will be.  I can totally feel it in my abs already- Tyson- you should be on TV- you are fantastically talented and entertaining. Thanks for everything!,1181088000,,497,4.369565217391305

I bought this for my son and I really can't tell you how happy I am to watch him doing something other than his video games. The DVD features one instructor named Tyson who is really just fun to watch. I know for me, I forgot I was watching an ""instructional"" dvd as it felt much more personal. My son doesn't like me to practice with him, but I did find myself trying many of these moves and it's quite the abdominal workout. Its like a pilates of robot or robot of pilates. While watching it, I found myself saying, ""this guy is crazy, and also really good."" What really inspired me to write this review was when I found out my son was able to directly contact Tyson and his crew of Elastic Illusionist (from across the country) for advise and help with the dance moves they teach. These guys are really making male dancing ""cool"".",1180828800,,1059,5.091954022988506
