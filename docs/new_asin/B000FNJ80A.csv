2577206,5,B000FNJ80A,"This is an ideal video which uses great visuals, music selected for tempo, interval training, it's all here! This is the right way to make a cycle training video. I'm talking to you Bike-O-Vision...",1194998400,4,198,4.852941176470588
2577207,5,B000FNJ80A,"I wish there were more like this. Great scenery, great music, helpful guidance for how long to expect to be holding a given intensity. It makes it so that spinning at home is more fun than spinning with your best spinning teacher. It also makes you want to really get out and ride outdoors! Good intensity, too. My heart rate varied between 160 and 180 (didn't check during the highest exertion periods), and I'm a 28 year old female. Of course you could do it harder or easeier, as well.",1173830400,7,488,4.433333333333334
2577208,5,B000FNJ80A,This is the best biking DVD I've seen.  You actually feel like you're on a training ride.  It guides you through a 60-minute workout with timed intervals at different exertion levels.  They also put helpful tips and motivational quotes from professional riders on the screen throughout the workout.  I highly recommend this DVD.,1171238400,5,328,5.132075471698113
8124815,5,B000FNJ80A,"I wasn't too sure if this maybe a little over my head, I love spinning (not a cyclist) and I am used to the spin class type of 'beat the crap out of you in 45 minutes'.  So I gave this a try as some of the DVDs that are trying to replicate classes were okay, not brilliant, until I came across this DVD: loved it and felt I had a great workout AND I was not bored like I can get in classes.  This workout had great variations from hill, interval and speed, all set against beautiful scenery.  There is dashboard that gives you enough information that you can either work with perceived effort (1 to 10, same as in spin class) to all the metrics if you had a monitor for rpm, heart %.  I loved the music as it is all rock themed and dateless.  I couldn't believe when the 1 hour was up!  I like this training DVD a whole lot better than the 'spinning' brand.  Spinervals are great too, as it is trying for cyclists.  Great DVD if you just have 1 hour to workout.  Love all the trivia facts and motivational quotes!",1324771200,,1013,4.075757575757576
8124816,5,B000FNJ80A,"Put this DVD in your player and head straight to training in the Great area around Las Vegas including, The Valley of Fire. I love the scenery and like the music a lot. How about the bands Sevenaya and the Rastaman Music... I usually make the degree of suggested exertion about two levels higher than what's suggested: So if it says a 6, I usually run about an 8. Also I usually stand about a minute or so past what they suggest. And through in a few additional one minute sprints when they are at recovery for ""far"" too long. With these additions, I think it's a VERY chalenging and affective workout.
BTW- I've seen other DVD's from Endurance Films and was dissappointed because they are not near as thought out as this tape was...

8124817,5,B000FNJ80A,"I have acquired many different videos over the years.  Train right, spinervals, epic rides, and this one.  Rides 2 Las Vegas is far and away the best.  Unique music as opposed to the seemingly hr long single beat box track that tends to be the norm which drives us crazy after no time.  i have rides vol 1 as well, which is not polished and dated, but the style is still okay.  This video is as close to indoor training perfection as you can get.  Lots of camera angles and good challenging workout that changes tempo and intensity frequently.  Pop-up video style information, unique music, ride along dashboard and sound ques.  I do notice the newer ""rides"" do not have the music of this one so am very dissapointed, but will tend to put this one in quite often especially when motivation is a little lacking.  Enjoy.",1294272000,,818,4.510204081632653
8124818,1,B000FNJ80A,"I purchased this video because I already owned two others in the series- North Carolina and Southern California (both are great).  It's clear that they hadn't quite worked out the bugs yet on this one.  The music tempo, heart rate target, RPE target, and the actions of the riders on the screen are not coordinated.  at all.  Whiny alternative ballads, with the riders on screen lightly spinning- but you're supposed to be pegged at 90% MHR?  85% MHR = RPE of 6?

There's also no indication of what's coming up in the workout for the first half of the movie.  So when a short interval flashes on the screen, it takes a good portion of the time to find the correct gearing.  They seemed to realize this problem halfway through.

If anybody wants a free copy, you can have mine.",1285718400,,776,4.485714285714286
8124819,4,B000FNJ80A,"I really like the ""rides"" series.  I like to look around and see the desert as I used to live near Nevada and I miss it.  I can see room for improvement on these rides, such as coordinating the music a little better with the pace that you are supposed to be keeping, but honestly, I have bought quite a few spin dvds and the rides series are really the best along with the Spinervals CD's.  Most spin DVDs quite honestly suck and at least the rides series works on keeping you engaged and pushing your limits.  I would recommend any of the rides series if you need something more than your favorite TV show to get you motivated to really move on your bike.",1270252800,,656,4.224
8124820,5,B000FNJ80A,"I like this DVD.  I don't live in the desert, but I miss it, so it's nice to see the landscape on this ride.  I also like it because it's long (about 57 minutes) and pushes you about the right amount.  I always sweat a lot while doing this ride and I like the prompts to push a little harder through the hills.  The music is also pretty good.  The only thing they could have choreographed better is that they are sometimes going down hills and vice versa when I'm supposed to be going up a or down a hill.  This is a minor detail and one that should't dissuade you from buying this if you need a little incentive to step up how hard you push yourself on your stationary bike.  It's well worth the money.  I no longer live near a gym, so I bought a bunch of cycle DVD's and this is one of my favorites (other one is Spinervals 4.0, lean and mean - a pretty hard interval workout).",1257724800,,879,4.040462427745664
8124821,1,B000FNJ80A,"This was the first one of this type I've gotten because of reviews I read on Amazon.  The dvd was ok, but for me personally I don't like the onscreen distractions (like other riders in front of you) or pop-ups graphs, etc., like so many of the other indoor cycling videos these days have.",1205971200,,288,4.333333333333333
8124822,5,B000FNJ80A,I've ridden Valley of Fire SP and this video really makes me feel like I am back again. I even find myself leaning and wanting to turn the handlebar around some of the faster turns!,1198972800,,181,4.2
8124823,4,B000FNJ80A,"Part two of the Rides series lacks a little realism.  How can this be in a simulated ride you ask?  Take for instance the fact that while the on screen dashboard tells you to do a cadence of 80 it is clear the riders are doing 50 or less.  This was not the case in the first RIDES.  I find myself having a hard time keeping ""pace"" with these glaring abnormalities.  It is still a good workout but only if you can ignore the fact you are spinning like crazy while the others pound it out nice and slow.  JUST THE FACTS:  Buy this one only after you have become bored of the first!",1197244800,,579,4.026315789473684
8124824,5,B000FNJ80A,"I love this video. I keep trying to find others as good, but I can't. I've bought this video for my children, and now we all meet at the Valley of Fire once a year to do it ""up close and personal."" This video rocks--they need to do more of them! The music is great, the levels are great, and at the end of the video you feel like a million bucks.",1196985600,2,346,3.8194444444444446
