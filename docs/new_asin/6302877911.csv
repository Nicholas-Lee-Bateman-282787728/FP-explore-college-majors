523608,4,6302877911,"Some films reach cult status for their weirdness (Rocky Horror) some reach cult status for their awfulness (Attack of the killer tomatoes). Some never quite reach cult status and disappear without a trace. Doc Savage seems to have managed to disappear without a trace. They say you should never meet your heroes and I suppose you should never revisit movies last seen as an undergraduate one late night. I had hazy memories of Doc Savage from my time as an undergrad and so upon finding it on Amazon Prime I decided to watch it again. This is a bad film. It's bad in the way films should be bad. B-Movie bad, unashamed of its badness.
Doc Savage Man of Bronze was a pulp magazine hero of the 1930s and 1940s. This film dug up some old episodes and slung them together as a film in 1975. It stars Ron Ely who had escaped from Tarzan but retained an undeniable physical presence and a cast of supporting actors. It has a lot of the high camp style of the original batman TV series. Watching it again I found it to be amusing and so overdone it really should have ended up as a cult classic. That it didn't is a shame. Your life won't be richer for having seen this but as a way to while away an hour or so it isn't bad. Damning with faint praise I know but this is badly overdone and I'm afraid Ron Ely's face would crack if his expression changed.

523634,3,6302877911,"Camp triumphed in the TV show ""Batman"" but there it largely worked due to the performances of the cast and some rather clever writing. If director Michael Anderson, producer George Pal (who also worked in the script) and Joe Morheim has an uneasy truce between that sense of camp, parody and seriousness. The uneven Tone and direction of Anderson (who directed ""Logan's Run"" a year later) as well as the script veering unsuccessfully between the variety of approaches here, doesn't do the film any favors either. If played more straight forward like the action adventure of something like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and stronger more certain direction the film would have at least been decent. The main problem with ""Savage"", like ""Remo Williams"", is that the film ca t decide what it really wants to be although ""Williams"" had more self assured direction from Guy Hamilton.

After the mysterious death of his father in South America,  adventurer/inventor and all around genius Savage assembles his brain trust Monk, Ham, Renny, Long Tom and Johnny to travel to South America and discover what really happened to his father and finds himself hunted as he retraces his dad's steps by Captain Seas who wants to enslave a Mayan tribe that his dad was working with and take their gold.

When I first saw the film, I had already read a handful of Doc Savage novels written by a number of writers (but primarily created by author Lester Dent) under the pen name Kenneth Robeson. I wa s surprised at the time because, while the film does touch on a number of characters, locations and situations that occurred in the novels, lacked the true sense of adventure at the heart of these pulp novels that provided inspiration for Superman (Doc has his own Fortress of Solitude that, like Superman's, is located close to the Arctic) and other super heroes of the time.

The film receives a robust and handsome transfer to Blu-ray with a very high bit rate courtesy of Warner Archives. While this cult film might seem an odd choice for Warner Archives to tackle, the news that The a Rock is working on a new version with Shane Black probably played a role in seeing the film appear ahead of titles that have been requested for years.

The cast does a pretty good job of bringing the characters to life and Roy Ely (best known as Tarzan) certainly looks the part. The handsome production design and use of matte paintings gives the film the appearance of a bigger budget than you would think (although the backlot jungle,just isn't convincing most of,the film but it does add to the fantasy element and recalls films from the era). The use of John Phillip Sousa's music is an odd choice but certainly adds to the camp element of the film.

It would have been nice to get some special features here including a discussion on the unsuccessful tone of the film. A film historian or George Pal could have given some insight into how the production was shot and the largely negative reception in 1975 when it was released. A box office flop, ""Doc Savage"" derailed  the career of producer Pal (who kept trying to mount sequels to both ""War of the Worlds"" and ""The Time Machine"" neither of which got off the ground although the latter did have a completed script and the agreement of the late Rod Taylor to appear in the film. Unfortunately, MGM was not having the most successful decade) who had a number of projects he tried to get off the ground after Savage was released and, well, savaged by critics and ignored by audiences.

Unfortunately, the sole extra we get is a high def trailer for the film.

""Doc Savage"" is an uneven mixture of camp, adventure and the pulp elements of the novels. The direction does the film no favors and the script can't settle on what type of film ""Doc Savage"" truly wants to be. Fans will be happy with the top notch transfer but the lack of special features (typical for Warner Archive) is unforgivable as it doesn't provide a context for the production and the choices that Pal and Anderson made for the film.

2 stars for the film, four stars for the nice transfer, no stars for the lack of special features for an average of three.",1481414400,,4147,4.637602179836512

523636,3,6302877911,This was a disappointing movie for me. I love Doc Savage but it seemed like they were trying to make this movie like the Batman tv show - corny and campy. I liked the book far better than this movie.,1481155200,,199,4.0
523637,3,6302877911,"Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze,"" based on the first of Kenneth Robesons 181 adventure-filled Doc Savage books, stars Ron Ely (TVs Tarzan series) as the title character. Apart from having an Adonis-like body, Doc is also a surgeon, linguist, airplane pilot and inventor, and is a dedicated champion of good and an enemy of bad guys wherever they may lurk.

Returning to New York City after a visit to his arctic hideaway, the Fortress of Solitude (does he sub-let from Superman?), Doc learns that his father has died under mysterious circumstances while exploring the Central American republic Hidalgo. While going through his fathers personal papers, he becomes the target of an assassination attempt. After chasing the would-be assassin, Doc returns to find that his fathers papers have been destroyed. Intent on solving his fathers murder, Doc sets out to Hidalgo.

Viewers should know from the outset that the tone of the movie is broad camp. The acting is intentionally over the top in an attempt to make the movie a pulp novel come to life. Some of the performances hark back to the silent days when villains twirled their mustaches to convey their wickedness. Though the film was produced by George Pal (The War of the Worlds) and directed by Michael Anderson (Around the World in 80 Days), it looks as if it was made by inexperienced filmmakers. The blend of campiness and adventure never hits the proper balance, and the movie becomes laughable for some of the right reasons, but many of the wrong ones. The film is given added doses of looniness with Paul Frees off-screen narration and the incessant John Philip Sousa score.

If you're a fan of bad movies that are so bad that they're highly entertaining, youll probably enjoy Doc Savage  It rightfully bombed at the box office when released in 1975 due to its limited budget, awful acting, plodding script, and forced, often thuddingly misguided attempts at camp. It was George Pals final film.

523638,5,6302877911,"DOC SAVAGE: THE MAN OF BRONZE [1975 / 2016] [Blu-ray] His Body . . . A Physical Phenomenon. His Mind . . . A Mental Marvel. His Fight . . . To Right All Wrongs! Hes Everything Youve Wanted In A Hero!

Based on the first of Kenneth Robeson's 181 adventure-packed Doc Savage books. DOC SAVAGE: THE MAN OF BRONZE hits the screen with all its gee-whiz, gung-ho spirit intact. And its bold protagonist, who along with having a herculean body is also a surgeon, linguist and inventor, remains determined to do right to all and wrong to no one.

Ron Ely [TV's Tarzan] plays the strapping Savage in this high-camp, big-heroics tale of his trek into the Valley of the Vanished to confront the power-hungry Captain Seas [Paul Wexler]. And behind the camera are pros who know how to get the most out of this entertainment bronze mine: veteran fantasy film producer George Pal of The War of the Worlds and The Time Machine and director Michael Anderson of Around the World in 80 Days and Logan's Run. Narrated by Paul Frees.

FILM FACT: Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze received the 1974  1975 Golden Scroll for Best Fantasy Film from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films. The film is also remembered for its theme song arranged by Frank De Vol, based on John Philip Sousa's The Thunderer. John Philip Sousas music was intended to evoke a patriotic theme for Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze and the Lyrics were by Don Black. Other aspects of the Doc Savage mythos were modified for the movie. For example, The film takes place in 1936, but the original pulp novel was published in March 1933. Most Doc Savage chronologies place the events in The Man of Bronze in early 1931 prior to the official opening of the Empire State Building, the implicit location of Doc Savage's 86th floor penthouse headquarters.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Historically-speaking, the science fiction and fantasy cinema has battled high camp and a form of art notable because of its exaggerated or over-the-top attributes and for over five decades. With DOC SAVAGE: THE MAN OF BRONZE [1975], here we have a very tongue-in-cheek film adaptation of the pulp magazine hero or superhero and created by Henry W. Ralston and story editor John L. Nanovi in the 1930s.

DOC SAVAGE: THE MAN OF BRONZE [1975] was originally only available on an inferior DVD release, but now the Warner Archive Collection has released it through their archive programme and what a joy it is, as I have loved this film ever since I saw it at the cinema and subsequently on the television. Before sitting down to watch it I did a little homework, and the film was produced the legendary and brilliant George Pal, who did the brilliant classic films like The Time Machine and War of the Worlds, which I wish Warner Archive Collection would release this on a Blu-ray disc. That alone is a recommend viewing, however it has also help with having at the helm the director Michael Anderson, who had previously directed another big-budget adventure film Around the World in 80 Days.

The Doc Savage character is indeed a sort of Indiana Jones, adventurer/explorer type of character. However he also shares a good deal in common with Batman. He has trained to the limits of human perfection and is a brilliant scientist/inventor (as the cheesy camp theme music lets you know on several occasions). This superhero quality also extends beyond his physical and mental capabilities. Doc Savage has a loyal bunch of sidekicks, each with their own special abilities, as well as a fortress of solitude in the far north, and a penthouse that includes a variety of vehicles, including a helicopter that launches out of a giant eagles head. Better still his official logo appears on all of his vehicles, clothing, and accessories. The logo looks just like the lettering in the poster, and you almost expect to see a little trademark insignia on his various pieces of property.

The film opens with an attempt on Doc Savages life, as a Native American marksman takes a shot with a sniper rifle. No problem though because the windows in Doc Savages penthouse are all designed to refract the interior such that everything appears 3-inches off from where they actually are. Doc Savage and his gang give chase only to find that the whole thing was a distraction. While they were out a secret map sent to Doc from his murdered father gave details of a hidden jungle oasis with a lake of gold. Undeterred Doc Savage and company head to the far reaches of Hidalgo, where they encounter the villainous Captain Seas, who has teamed up with some locals of Mayan ancestry in order to gain access to the gold. Doc sets out to defeat Seas who, with the help of the Mayans, has harnessed the power of The Green Death to do his bidding, who some negative critics thought the animated green snakes were very cheesy animated snakes, well they are wrong, as I thought the animated effects were well executed and very effective and again these pompous critics of this film cant see the irony of this film, where it is just a tongue cheek fun filled film, and just like on par with the TV series BATMAN.

First off lets talk about that cast. Ron Ely (TVs Tarzan) cuts a dashing figure as Doc Savage. On a visual level he is just about as perfect as one could hope, but sometimes can be slightly wooden in the acting department, but honestly his performance worked for me and just the right combination of overconfidence and machismo. His band of sidekicks were also well-played, with the most recognizable being Paul Gleason as Long Tom. Each has their own distinct personality and skill set which are highlighted on various occasions. Paul Wexler plays like a Christopher Lee substitute, but he is just about adequate as the villain, with a touch of camp. Making more of an impression is Pamela Hensley in her screen debut as Doc Savages leading lady. Everyone seems to be having a great time. Yes, the film is a really enjoyable romp to watch, especially with Doc Savage being a decent superhero in this film.

The opening action sequence really sets the tone for the film, as the matte painting of Doc Savages penthouse is nothing short of superb. I am a huge fan of matte paintings in classic films of this genre. Sure they are sort of fake looking, but they can be absolutely beautiful and this is a film that screams a high level of artistry. Unfortunately, when we see The Green Death attacks, it does not quite come off. I understand animation was necessary given the limitations of the time, but the animation here is not quite good enough even for the period. They should have brought in Disney talent for something like this. Every time were treated to The Green Death sequence, what should be terrifying, does not quite come off. Finally the sets look like a few steps above an Ed Wood production, with the most disappointing being the lake of gold.

With my comments about the film DOC SAVAGE: THE MAN OF BRONZE that I found many shortcomings, but despite this I still think it is a classic film genre of its time. Any disappointment stems from the fact that the character could be adapted in a way that would lead to a greater superhero film, and its a shame that this initial outing derailed that possibility. Apparently a reboot was planned in the late 1990's starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and to be directed by Frank Darabont of The Shawshank Redemption and The Walking Dead, but once Arnold Schwarzenegger entered politics those plans were shelved.

One final bit worthy of mentioning is that a franchise was in the works for Doc Savage. At the end of the film we are informed that Doc Savage will return in Doc Savage: The Arch Enemy of Evil. Interestingly details via the internet suggest that a fair amount of the sequel was filmed simultaneously with DOC SAVAGE: THE MAN OF BRONZE. Because the first outing bombed so very badly and the critics really slammed the film in a very negative way, the follow up film was never completed or released. Boy that footage would have made a great extra on this Blu-ray release, assuming it still exists in a vault somewhere? Oh well never mind, we still have this film to fall back on whenever we want a bit of escapism!

Blu-ray Video Quality  Warner Archive Collection has once again brought us another old classic action pack film in this 1080p encoded image and offset with a great 1.85:1 aspect ratio presentation and is presented to us with a commissioned new scan of an interpositive, which was performed by Warner's Motion Picture Imaging facility, followed by extensive colour correction and clean-up, but has a slight analogue softness to it, which characteristic of many Seventies films released over that decade, and the optical image is remarkably detailed with good clarity with this Blu-ray disc. With close-ups you have good excellent definition, especially revealing the minutia of the individual strands of Doc Savage's unnaturally golden locks. The film's night-time sequences feature solid blacks, and its palette ranges from the pale, cool tones of a snowy mountain crossing to the rich, saturated hues of the jungle sequences. Any noise interference and other artefacts are wholly absent, and the film's grain pattern is finely resolved. So all in all this is a very good presentation for a film that was released in 1975.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Warner Archive Collection has sadly not upgrades the audio presentation and given us only a 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Stereo, so despite this, the track has impressive dynamic range for its era, best exemplified in the deep bass drumbeats of the rousing John Philip Sousa standards adapted by Frank De Vol to create the composed film's score. The dialogue is very clearly rendered, as are the essential sound effects, which are usually more goofy than realistic, as in the mixed martial arts showdown between Doc Savage and Captain Seas. Again despite only one audio presentation and its limitation, it is still a good audio exciting presentation.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Theatrical Trailer [1975] [1080i] [1.78:1] [3:01] This is the Original Theatrical trailer for the film DOC SAVAGE: THE MAN OF BRONZE. It is a little bit rough round the edges, and has a slight analogue softness to it, but despite this it is still a great over the top trailer presntation.

Finally, DOC SAVAGE: THE MAN OF BRONZE [1975], was panned by critics and failed at the box-office. George Pal suggested the films failure was to do with the loss of funding, when the studio changed heads and George Pal was forced to cut costs. One of the major issues for me was George Pal seemed to go for more camp style to the film maybe to capture the Batman style. That could be considered a good thing or a bad thing depending on your feelings of Adam West as Batman. But nevertheless it is a piece of cinema history and a shame more money was not allowed to be spent on the film and they were not allowed to do a follow up film. Despite all the negative reaction to this film, I have loved it ever since I first saw the film in the cinema and longed for it to be released on the superior Blu-ray format and now I have it in my possession and it has now gone pride of place in my Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

523639,5,6302877911,"This review is not about the movie, per se. It's about the Blu Ray transfer.

All and all, an excellent HD remaster job. Most of the effects shots, particularly the opening montage, are weak to very weak. When the movie opens, you are asking yourself ""Is this a Blu Ray?"" But the quality really picks up once you get past that effect shot. Great HD detail! Doc hasn't looked this good since the theatrical release (and maybe not even then).

One drawback of the great remastering. Ron Ely looks 10 years older in a lot of shots.

(An aside about the campyness. Yes, it's there. But having read around 70 books of the original Doc Savage Magazine, there was a lot of humor in them, particularly between Monk and Ham. Things like Monk torturing Ham with his two-tailed coin (Ham always bets heads), or telling people that Ham had a tongue that was ""fast in the middle and loose at both ends"".

I liked it because it was faithful to the original material, and also because it was set in a good time period (when men were men, and women were ladies).  Unlike most present-day movies, there is no moral ambiguity in this film - the hero is good, the villian is evil, and the leading lady is very attractive.

There are actions scenes throughout - in skyscrapers, boats, remote indian villages.  And the scenery is very beautiful, especially (BEGIN SPOILER ALERT) right before they discover the secret passageway to the village with the gold (END SPOILER ALERT).

523729,1,6302877911,"Sadly, director George Pals chose to go the way of 'camp' in making this movie. I understand this was the early 70's and a time when fantasy and the fantastic were not yet viewed as genres deserving of serious treatment. George Pals had already proven himself capable of taking seriously such science fiction classics as ""War of the Worlds"" and ""The Time Machine"" but when it came to ""the man of bronze"" he lacked the vision that would have cut new ground as the Indiana Jones movies did later. I thought Ron Ely truly had the look of Doc Savage and it was good to see him with his fabulous five associates. The five did display the unique characteristics Lester Dent had provided them with in the books and were easily distinguishable though I felt the character of Monk was badly miscast in terms of physique. The banter between Ham and Monk was there but ultimately undermined by the 'camp' presentation. The John Philip Sousa soundtrack was so over the top that I felt the whole purpose of the movie was to deride the character and his adventures instead of having fun with them as I actually believe was Pals' intention. For those who love 'camp', this is the movie for them. For those who enjoy the Doc Savage adventures I hope they will be forewarned: this movie lacks the charm the pulp series still possesses for those who can appreciate them. It would have been nice to see a movie from someone who not only got that but could translate it to the screen. I believe George Pals had the talent and competence to do so but instead caved to the zeitgeist of that time period.",1413072000,3,1581,4.512195121951219

523797,2,6302877911,"When I think of the Doc Savage novels, 181 originals if I recall correctly, I remember the action. The Man of Bronze's world is a series of frying pans in a lake of fire. He is constantly leaping from pan to flame and just when you think he is winning the burner gets turned up. Inventive and wild with distinctive characters and great interplay between them all, Doc Savage stories are a great time waster. This movie is also a waste of time, but not a great one.

For those that have never read a Doc story, think Indiana Jones meets the Magnificent Seven.

Unfortunately what we get with this movie is Adam West Batman meets Roger Moore's James Bond. Near parody coupled with buffoonish characters. Ron Ely makes a visually passable Doc Savage, but replaces wooden for bronze. He is never given anything really interesting to do or say, he just sort of poses or dashes. Playing Doc for laughs may have made some sense, but it would mean that the script should actually contain some jokes that were funny. Playing Doc as a joke was a bad idea. The makers of the movie did not have any faith in the source material. George Lucas did and created Indiana Jones.

There are many things to criticize about this film and I will stop after this. As a screenwriter, when you are handed source material with characters like ""Ham"" Brooks and ""Monk"" Mayfair you take this gift and run. They are a variation of Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello and myriad other slim and wide duos including (yes I am bailing to Lucas again) C3P0 and R2D2. Whoever cast these actors missed the boat completely. Monk looks more pig-like than anything and far from being a lean legal machine Brooks looks more the fop and dandy, ineffectual and slight. The other members of the Five are moderate, but indistinguishable from one another. Arguably this is a problem with the books as well, but in a visual medium this can be overcome by the actor creating a distinct manner and movement.

There is no real threat here, no villain worth fearing, no grand master plot that we can care about and frankly no chemistry between any of the characters. (The inclusion of the pig Habeaus Corpus, but not the chimp Chemistry is a miss as well.)

If you are a fan of Doc Savage you will watch this film. Don't buy it unless you get a great price. If you are not a fan, take a fast pass on this one. If you are thinking that your children will like it, get them something of quality instead.

My apologies to George Pal for this review. I don't know what you were thinking here, but thankfully you have a long history of excellent films to prove your skill. Thanks for everything else.",1372377600,4,2646,4.490644490644491

Not disappointed.  Yes, the production values are a bit schlocky compared to today and the story has a couple of gaping holes in the plot, but it's a fun more-or-less-accurate retelling of the first Doc Savage novel.

523818,5,6302877911,"When I first saw ""Doc Savage,"" the film, I was quite young. The film mesmerized me into a total fantasy world of a good guy / tough guy, who also had brains and compassion with the brawn. There are those detractors who complain that it's ""not like the book,"" which we all hear oh so often. Big deal. I personally have never read any of the books, but this film did inspire me to do so, some day. That aside, ignoring the complaints of the ""die-hards,"" ""Doc Savage"" is a rollicking fun adventure.

What I especially loved about this story is... as mentioned already the brawny good guy who also is super intelligent. But more so is his clever cast of characters, and characters they are. It's the love-hate relationships between the crew, as well as all their distinctive personalities, and how they handle business at hand. As well, the 6'4"" Ron Ely (""Tarzan"" in 1966 TV), was a great choice to play the title role. His chisled features and little nonsense attitude made the character come alive.

The story itself is a fun adventure, and years before the ""Indiana Jones"" franchise. This is true pulp story-telling for the adventure seeker. In my personal opinion, ""Doc Savage"" is a must-see, and a must-have in your DVD collection, to which I would also include ""The Rocketeer,"" the ""Indiana Jones"" features, and ""League Of Gentlemen,"" (the last one may be debatable by some). Fun, adventurous, humor-filled, and action-packed. AND, more importantly, this is a film the family can watch together - unlike so much else these days.

I ask similar questions when I find great movies edited for DVD release. Tales of the City and Claudius are two sets that I will not buy until I can get the original, uncut versions.

And here we have Doc Savage.  If you want to experience the sagas of one of America's first super heros, get the Doc Savage books.

Of course there is room of satire and camp. Most of the stories almost beg for it. Buckaroo Banzai was a decent attempt to achieve just this effect.

And now to the less than halfhearted effort to make a cash cow. This movie is a perfect example of why you cannot deliberately try to make a cult movie.

The wretched , deliberate mangling of John Phillip Sousa is the sound track to this movie. Then there is the consistently and possibly deliberately poor writing with which the  other wise well meaning c list actors are forced to cope. The limp unexciting fights and the seriously cheap special effects ... this movie is a failure.

Some studio needs to rediscover Doc Savage. It is ripe to be the next franchise money maker. The idea of a annual summer block buster that can stretch into 100+ movies before anyone needs to write an original script should be enough to get the money people to fling checks in desperate abandon.

You see, when I was a child and went to summer camp in New Hampshire (Camp Takodah in the house!), it was tradition to watch this movie. With an actual film projector. Hundreds of cheering boys when Doc Savage says the classic line, ""Mona, you're a brick.""

So when I bought this on DVD from the Warner Archive -- now available on Amazon's new Never on DVD store -- I didn't know what to expect. Was this movie going to be as good as I remembered from my childhood? The simple answer, yes and no.

The chemistry between the leads is surprisingly good, and Ron Ely plays Doc Savage with the right amount of heroism and humor. The scenes I remember as somewhat scary are passably scary, but mostly funny. The special effects are a cheeseball mess. The parts that break the fourth wall still feel fresh after all this time, even though breaking the fourth wall is practically a movie cliche now.

If you like good-bad adventure movies, or if you actually went to Camp Takodah, this DVD is a must buy.",1337904000,,1059,4.505208333333333
523823,4,6302877911,"I was a little skeptical about ordering an DVD-R on demand version of a movie (I have looked at many but never purchased one), but I am extremely happy with my decision to buy.  I initially expected the delivery time to be longer than most orders I place because these DVDs are made on demand, but my copy of Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze got here within just a few days of ordering, which is insanely fast considering that Alaska orders usually always take at least 5 days to get here.

The packaging I received was the white cover pictured on the ad, which is great because I wasn't too thrilled with the dark blue look of the other cover.  There are a few typos on the back cover (""hits the screen"" spelled ""hits the scren"", etc.) but I am not bothered by that.

The DVD playback menu is very generic; looks to be a Warner Brothers Archive Collection general template (I assume all of the archive collections of this nature are the same).  It has no Doc Savage Title, just says Archive Collection and has buttons to ""Play Movie"" or ""Play Trailer"".  Chapters are automatically set to every ten minutes of the film, not significant scenes.  That's all you get, no bonus content or other extras, but I wasn't surprised.  It's just great to be able to get these old films on DVD finally!

That said, the $15.90 I paid seems a little steep for an on demand DVD with no extras and no movie specific menus.  I think a $9.00 price point is much more reasonable, but since these archive movies are fairly new I understand.  If someone wants a movie enough, they will buy it.  Afterall, I just did!

The movie transfer is EXCELLENT.  Better that some of the highly marketed older movies that have been in print on DVD for years.  I was more than stoked about this.  All of the above rates 5 stars without a doubt, but I give it four because the general story line is just okay to me, and I have never really had any emotional attachment to these characters.  It's a great movie and I have already watched it twice since it came in this afternoon, but overall when compared to other old films I enjoy, this one isn't the top of the list.

If I had the choice I would give it 4.5 stars, but the lack of custom dvd menus/extras in relation to the price as well as the almost-great-but-not-quite story have me leaving 4 instead of 5.",1322179200,,2322,4.348027842227379

When I discovered someone had made a movie, I was both excited and scared--excited because I love seeing my favorite characters brought to the big screen (I'm also a comic book fan who loves seeing live action comic adaptions); scared because I've seen too many of my beloved heroes treated very badly (Superman Returns, the Justice League TV pilot of the 90s, the 70's Shazam show, and more). I finally decided to take the plunge and buy this movie, and I'm very glad I did.

This movie is a very faithful adaption of the original Doc Savage novel, Man of Bronze. In the movie we see Doc's Fortress of Solitute, his car, and aerogyro, all with labels. All five of his faithful friends are along for the ride.

The movie has some decent action and stunts. The scenery and costume quality is typical for a 70's film. The acting is a little flat, but the story is fun. There are a few parts that get a little cheesy and silly, but overall the movie takes itself seriously and respects the fans.

This movie is fun and appropriate for all ages. I recommend it for all fans of Doc Savage, fans of early 20th century comic strips, and fans of classic comic books.",1265760000,9,1215,4.439461883408072

Not only is Doc himself as ideal a role model today as he was more than thirty years ago - combining strength, intellect, compassion, humor and good table manners - but the team of his loyal friends demonstrate that every person has unique talents and skills without which the group as a whole could not function.

As clearly as the film gets that message across, though, it does so with grace and charm instead of banging one on the head with moral superiority. It's a fun film, first and foremost, and my grandchildren (and I!) enjoy it as much today as my former girlfriends' kids did long ago.",1260748800,6,819,4.417218543046357

Ely carries off this performance with aplomb.  This may be the best camp movie of all time.  Every scene drips with satire and irony.  At places, it is vastly amusing.

The original Doc Savage books are horrible pieces of trash.  This movie is a work of art.

It may be that some of the jokes are no longer accessible to younger folks--a fight scene which switches between seemingly dozens of different fighting styles, for example, is funny in itself, but hilarious if one achieved young adulthood in the sixties, when the merits of the different systems were the stuff of adolescent male obsession.

523843,2,6302877911,"Finally available on DVD by Warner Archive, this is the last movie George Pal -- DESTINATION MOON, THE NAKED JUNGLE, HOUDINI, WAR OF THE WORLDS, WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE, THE TIME MACHINE, THE 7 FACES OF DR LAO -- would make. The plot is a cross between the origin story THE MAN OF BRONZE and a later Lester Dent story THE GREEN DEATH. They could have done far better. Infact, Warner Bros had so little faith in the film that they held up its release for a year because they had so little faith in the film. Doc Savage is a creature of another time. Still, it could have been a rollicking new old time serial with better budget and effects. It wasn't. I have a love/hate relationship with his movie. Ron Ely is perfect as Doc but the casting for the Amazing Five isn't very good. Michael Miller as Monk, Darrell Zwerling as Ham and Paul Gleason as Long Tom are just awful. Bill Lucking as Renny and Eldon Quick as Johnny are fine. The script goes for Batman camp. Warner Bros held up the film for a year and then dumped it out quickly. This really could have been Indiana Jones. It held that kind of potential. What is the difference? George Lucas and Steven Spielberg were young guys of their time. George Pal was an old guy of his. The terrific films that fit the 1950's were slowly in a post-Vietnam world seemingly old fashioned in the wake of EASY RIDER and the like. 2001 had changed the sf landscape but Pal chose to make a film that would have worked two decades earlier. To be sure, there entertaining moments and some quaint things. At the end of the day it is a sad end to the career of an incredible film maker. Pal would not make another movie and die five years later. An interesting addition to any collection -- like the unreleased versions of CPT AMERICA and THE FANTASTIC FOUR. Still, one has to look at this film and think (with 181 books to draw from) what might have been. This movie also suffered from a change in regime at Warner Bros while it was in production and from being an origin story. Alas, we will never see the intended sequels: DOC SAVAGE THE ARCH ENEMY OF EVIL & DOC SAVAGE IN ATLANTIS COUNTRY. Played a little straighter, budgeted a little higher and this would have -- six years earlier -- been what RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK became. There is always talk of another Doc Savage movie.

523845,2,6302877911,"After Watergate, Vietnam and the dark days of the Nixon and Jimmy Carter eras, what the world needed was a good old-fashioned chapter-play hero taking on venomous serpents and evildoers in the America of 1936 or the jungles of South America in a series of fantastic cliffhanging adventures. Unfortunately what it got in 1975 was Doc Savage, The Man of Bronze. Perhaps the best that can be said of legendary producer George Pal's final film is that his often beautifully designed but sadly flat adaptation of Kenneth Robeson's pulp-paperback novels probably had George Lucas and Phil Kaufman leaving the theatre and saying to each other ""We can do better than that,"" and adding a bullwhip, a battered Fedora and some much needed character flaws to the mix.

A big part of the problem is that Doc Savage is in many ways even harder to write for than Superman - explorer, adventurer, philanthropist, a scientific and intellectual genius in the bronzed bleach-blonde bulletproof muscle-bound body of a Greek God (or rather the form of TV's Tarzan, Ron Ely, a rather dull Charlton Heston clone here), there's simply nothing he can't do and, more damagingly, nothing that can harm him. The man is the virtual incarnation of Hitler's Aryan ubermensch, albeit with all-American values. And just in case there should ever be anything he's overlooked (not that there ever is) he has not one but five sidekicks in his entourage, the (less than) Fabulous Five. A chemist, an electrician and even an archaeologist I can accept, and at a stretch I could possibly even go as far as to see the possible need for a construction engineer, but what kind of hero takes a criminal lawyer with him on his adventures? In reality Doc's brain trust were probably added because with the hero so tiresomely invulnerable and practically perfect in every way - even Kryptonite wouldn't put a dent in him - there needed to be someone at risk in the stories, though with the exception of Paul Gleason they're all so horribly badly cast and overplayed (as are most parts in the film) you'd happily kill them all off during the opening titles. The villains fare no better, with Paul Wexler exuding all the menace of a geography teacher as Captain Seas, Scott Walker (no, a different one) delivering one of cinema's worst accents (is it meant to be Scottish, Irish, Welsh, Greek, Pakistani or some nationality no-one has ever heard of?) while Robyn Hilton's Marilyn Monroe-ish dumb blonde moll gives Paris (no relation) a run for her money in the untalented bimbo stakes.

Even with those drawbacks, this should have been much better than it is considering the various ingredients - lost tribes, a pool of gold, a dogfight with a biplane and a deadly poison that comes alive, all wrapped up in a quest to discover why Doc's father was murdered. Unfortunately it's a question of tone: in the 60s and 70s pulp superheroes weren't brooding figures prone to state-of-the-art action scenes and special effects but were treated as somewhat comical figures of low-budget camp fun with action scenes quickly knocked off on the cheap almost as an afterthought, the films aimed purely at the matin&eacute;e market: you know, for kids. There have long been rumours that the original cut was more straight-faced - and certainly much of the camp value has been added in post-production, be it the Colgate twinkle in Doc's eye, the comical captions identifying various fighting styles in the final dust-up with Captain Seas or Don Black's gung-ho lyrics to John Philip Sousa's patriotic marches - but plenty was in the film to begin with. After all, it's hard to see how one of the villain's underlings making phone calls from a giant rocking crib was ever intended as anything other than a joke that falls flat, while Doc's explanation to Pamela Hensley of why he never dates girls could be a scene written for Adam West's Batman. Instead, the funniest moments are usually purely unintentional, such as Doc displaying his sixth sense by, er, bobbing his Adam's apple.

Perhaps an even bigger problem is that, while promising on paper, the action is handled in an almost relentlessly mundane fashion, be it chasing a native assassin on the rooftops of New York skyscrapers or escaping from a yacht full of bad guys. Even the winning notion of animated glowing green snakes swirling through the air as they poison their victims fails to raise any enthusiasm from director Michael Anderson: having demonstrated their own invulnerability a couple of scenes earlier, Doc manages to dispatch them with no more than a chair and an electric fan by simply pulling the curtains on them.

Still, aside from Doc's various vehicles all stamped with his logo and looking more moulded plastic than bronze, the production design is often rather handsome even if it is very obviously L.A. standing in for New York while Fred Koenekamp's cinematography ensures the film often looks good despite the low budget. And it's good to see a superhero movie that doesn't spend most of its running time on an origin story, though one is left with the suspicion that Doc sprang fully formed from the loins of Zeus himself.

It's a film I'd really like to like more, but it just feels like 100 minutes of lost opportunities. No wonder Doc Savage, The Arch Enemy of Evil, the sequel so optimistically promised in the end credits, never happened.

Warner's DVD-R is a legitimate pressing, though it's available new from either Warner's or TCM's websites at a more reasonable price than most second-hand copies on the market.",1245542400,5,5546,4.882165605095541

523848,3,6302877911,"The 1930's was the heyday of Tarzan, the Lone Ranger, the Shadow, the Spider, the Green Hornet, Captain Midnight, Gene Autry, Flash Gordon, and eventually Superman and Batman.  A great pantheon of pop culture heroes flourished in pulp magazines, comic strips, radio shows, and movie serials.

The 1960's gave us Adam West as Batman, Derek Flint, Maxwell Smart, 007, and many other hero spoofs(not to mention the theater then unfolding in the socio-political realms); the concept of the hero emerged from this period battered and shaken.

The early 1970's saw the emergence of a new type of rather angry anti-hero: Dirty Harry, Shaft, Billy Jack, Superfly, etc.

George Pal had accurately predicted the sci-fi craze of the 1950's, and so he produced the first picture of that cycle as well as producing the classic and best versions of `War of the Worlds' and `The Time Machine'.  George Pal correctly understood that by the mid-1970's the collective unconscious of America was hungry for a return of the old school hero, 1930's style.

George Pal knew that to make an adventure of this sort with a hero like Doc Savage that you had to somehow acknowledge the absurdity of it all.  Unfortunately, while Indiana Jones and the Rocketeer gave the audience the equivalent of a knowing wink, Doc Savage's director stopped just an inch short of having Doc Savage slip on a banana peel.  This film, then, is an uneasy mix of authentic 1930's style pulp magazine adventure and ham-fisted attempts at camp.

The single worst thing in this film is the soundtrack, a creative but ultimately dreadful batch of John Phillip Sousa marches, including a custom Doc Savage lyric, which is especially loathsome.  It is indeed fortunate that a good many parts of this film managed to escape this score.

Negatives aside, this film will be mildly enjoyable to fans of pulp magazines, old comics, radio and serial heroes, etc.  Fans of Doc Savage should be mollified by the many elements of the source material which were faithfully realized, and that compared to more recent super-hero flicks, the writers took relatively few liberties.  Overall, the cast is pretty good, and Ron Ely looks exactly like the vision of Doc Savage on the covers of the original pulps.  I think he pulls off the role pretty well.  And there are old style cars, airplanes, clothes, and fight scenes, so it's a pretty fun ride.

George Pal might have missed the mark here, but not by much.  Just a year after this film came `Star Wars,' which was basically a retooling of the old Flash Gordon serials.  In 1978 came `Superman, the Movie.' Two years after that came the 1st Indiana Jones flick, set smack dab in the 1930's, just like Doc Savage.  All of these latter productions, however, benefited by taking their source material or inspiration just a little bit more seriously than Pal did.

But since `Doc Savage,' more1930's throwback films have flopped than succeeded, at least commercially: `The Legend of the Lone Ranger,' `The Phantom,' `The Rocketeer,' `The Shadow,' and `Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow.'  All of these were big budget affairs.  For some reason, certain persons amongst us are irresistibly drawn to that long lost decade, when imagination populated the world with mythic heroes.  Too bad these heroes usually remain one step beyond our reach.",1206057600,4,3329,4.926523297491039

Evidently the writers never read the Phantom strips.)Superman I looks like they changed directors 1/2 way thru; The rest degenerated to the point that IV was a social message film; Batman I was decent, if you could accept Keaton..but, the next 2 were abominable, showing no one understood what made the first one decent.

523853,4,6302877911,"This film is very good, but has one critical flaw-the campiness!  I realize it made Mystery Science Theater 3000, and that is the best compliment that a bad film can have.
I say that this film is good for several reasons.  First, the story is faithful to the original story.  Compare that to the fast and loose ""Superman"" and ""Batman"" movies, which were good films, but ran roughshod over the origin stories.
Secondly, and with the one exception of Monk, this film is perfectly cast.  Going by the book descriptions, the actors look like the characters they play: Ham looks like Ham, Renny is uncannily like Renny, and Habeas Corpus looks like a pig, although with smaller ears.  By the way, Habeas wasn't in the first novel, and they left out Ham's pet monkey Chemistry, thank goodness!
To his credit, Michael Miller plays the part that he was cast to play quite well, and he is great and charming actor.  However, he was miscast as a character, and that was the main problem.  Especially, since Monk is one of the main characters in the book.  Other members of the brain trust come and go, but Doc, Ham and Monk are the Holy Trinity of the 181 super-sagas.  I think the produces didn't want to have two muscle-bound characters, and fat people always seem to be jolly.  The fat man/thin man interplay with Ham and Monk works for the film, but it isn't quite right for what should be done.
The hardware is also superbly done.  Basically Doc Savage is a Depression James Bond, and it was a tread to see the retro-technology that would have been used by a genius in the 1930's.  The answering machine says it all.
So now to the John Phillip Sousa music.  It works with me, since Doc Savage isn't a hero, but he is the first-the prototype-Superhero.  He is even prior to Superman, who was really a rip-off of Doc Savage.  Sorry Mr. Seinfeld!  The music adds patriotic majesty and ""oomph"" to what Doc Savage is all about.  Keep in mind, this was made in 1975, a year before the Bicentennial, when we has a spike of patriotism, just like after the 9/11 attacks.  It is no shame to love your country!
The campiness is not as bad as it seems.  The wild success of the Adam West ""Batman,"" is the reason why this film was done in that vein.  You had everyone wanting to be a part of ""Batman.""  Just look at the guest villains, such as Caesar Romero, Burgess Meredith, and the weird cameos when they were scaling the walls with the bat ropes.  I think the studio wanted to try to reproduce the feel of ""Batman,"" but it didn't work.  And it looks quite lame with 20/20 hindsight.
Sadly, this is all we Savagites have to tide us over.  There were rumors of Arnold Schwartzeneggar as Doc Savage.  His body is right, but the accent is all wrong.  A pre-accident Christopher Reeve would be ideal, and there is always hope that we can clone Orson Welles, but other than that, I don't know of anyone who could play Doc, except Nicholas Cage.  Just Kidding!
All in all, this movie isn't as bad as it first seems, and the floating snakes are downright creepy. At least they freaked me out as a four year old kid when I saw this in a drive in.  But I date myself!",1014681600,50,3143,4.409722222222222
523854,4,6302877911,"This is one that should come out on DVD. Great one liners and sight gags. Doc is the hero that every man should strive to be. Nothing gets him down, and the tougher things get the tougher he comes back at them. Armed with courage, determination, resources that would make Bruce Wayne proud and his band of loyal associates; he fights evil and wins the admiration of the dames. Plus it includes some of the cheeziest snake FX ever.

523857,5,6302877911,"Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze, while awkwardly out of time and a general source of embarrassment to most lifelong fans of Lester Dent's archetypal pulp-literature hero, is nevertheless an oddly entertaining and likable film.
Viewed without prejudice, it succeeds on the level of classic action-adventure marred only by an unfortunate overdose of comedy relief courtesy of Monk, the Lost Stooge. The ""real"" chemical wizard was, like Doyle's Prof. Challenger, a tough anthropoidal brawler whose trademark shenanigans contrasted his brutish appearance. Not a pallid Curly with muttonchops.
The rest of the supporting cast play their respective print counterparts convincingly. And as Doc, the Supreme Adventurer, Ron Ely is as close to the mark as anyone could possibly be.
Having watched this movie more than 30 times over the years, I no longer refer to it as a guilty pleasure. Just a pleasure.",975196800,17,894,5.302816901408451
