6357974,5,B00JHH1ZYW,Love the Transformers aminations ... they transform the same as the toys,1411516800,,72,5.083333333333333
6357975,4,B00JHH1ZYW,"Transformers: Cybertron is the third and final part of the Unicron Trilogy in the West. From what I've read in Japan it's a stand-alone series that has no links to the previous 2 series before it (Armada and Energon respectfully) and in a strange way that be why I think it's the best of the three.

Picking up an undisclosed amount of time after the ending of ""Energon"" the destruction of Unicron has created a super black hole that threatens to destroy the Transformers homeworld of Cybertron and eventually the entire universe. Optimus Prime is forced to order all transformers on Cybertron to be move to Earth and to blend in without the humans noticing. Before Team Prime can leave they're visited by Vector Prime the Autobot guardian of time and space who tells them that the only way to stop the Super Black Hole is to find the four Cyber planet keys and the Omega Lock to release the power of Primus the creator of all the Transformers. He also gives the members of Team Prime the power to use fragments of the Cyber planet keys to unlock new weapons and powers.

Then Megatron, Starscream, and the super annoying Thundercracker arrive and follow the Autobots to Earth where we meet 3 new human characters brothers Colby and Bud, and Lori the girl next door Colby and Bud are gearheads and they of course help  the Autobots find the keys and Vector Prime also has 3 new Mini-Cons be their partners.

The quest for the Keys to take the Autobots to Speed Planet a planet of robot racers. Beast Planet a primitive planet filled with Transformers that transform into animals and Giant Planet a planet of giant construction robots and home of the new Mini-Cons.
The Autobots and Decepticons find new members for their respective sides on each planet. Starscream betrays Megatron (for the zillionth time) and uses the power of the Keys to become a giant and even fights Primus who defeats him planet boas! Megatron becomes Galvatron (again) and the series as a knock out drag out fight to death between Optimus Prime and Galvatron that easily equals the epic battle in the 86 animated movie. The final episode takes the Transformers into deep space to finish the space bridge and hide the Cyber Planet Keys.

The animation is combination of tradition cel for the humans and CGI transformers this does take a little getting used to, the designs of the Transformers look great and most (but not all) the Transformers move a lot better than they did in ""Armada"" and ""Energon"" if there is problem with the animation it's the overuse of stock scenes of the Transformers transforming and combining with each other.

The voice acting is pretty good and there aren't many mis-naming characters this time. A lot of the Transformers have accents in this series while some have accents that are funny and some are just downright annoying I do feel it does give them more personalty.

The series is pretty good and with only a few lines and some brief cameos at the end of the final episode to tie into the previous 2 series it works great as it's a series in own right. Give it a chance it's a lot of fun.",1409443200,4,3096,4.618181818181818
6357976,1,B00JHH1ZYW,"A couple weeks ago, I bought my copy of this at my local Hastings.  I got as far as the episode ""Fury"" on disc 6 when the thing completely froze up on me.  It also gave off a very annoying buzzing-like sound.  I contacted Shout Factory about the problem immediately and sent me a replacement disc.  However, the replacement turned out to also have the same defect.  Is there anyone else who is experiencing the same problem?",1408665600,,424,4.454545454545454

6357978,2,B00JHH1ZYW,"Again this manufacture put side bars in the video (Transformers Energon had the same issue).  This allows them to use less disks and less processing power to make these videos because there is less data to process.  So instead of the video being 720x480 it is really only 544x480 of actual data, the rest is black data.",1407801600,,319,4.578947368421052

8650892,3,B00JHH1ZYW,"All things considered not a bad entrant into the line of animated Transformers shows, though still flawed in a number of ways.

The US released is labeled as the 3rd entrant to the Unicron Trilogy, being the sequel to Transformers Energon. However this was a labeling change for the US. In the original Japanese release Transformers Cybertron was an independent entity from Armada and Energon, and it shows. There are almost no references to the first two parts of the Unicron Trilogy, and what few that exist are just throw away lines purposely inserted to make the connection.

The animation of Cybertron is better then the animation from Transformers Energon, however the 3D cell animation is still blocky and stilted compared to a traditional 2D. And a lot of the show's run time is taken up by stock animation of the Transformers transforming and using special attacks.

The plot of the Transformers having to seek lost colonies to acquire ancient artifacts that can stop a universe destroying threat is interesting and it is used well to introduce new characters (meaning toys).

And the obligatory human children characters are OK. They are not overly annoying, but there are times when they have to give forced input to justify their existence.",1513987200,,1252,4.976076555023924

8650895,3,B00JHH1ZYW,"My kids love this version of the series, well the first parts of each anyway.
A while back I bought the Energeon episodes and they liked that so I decided to buy the other once from the 3 Part Unicron Series.
My Sons love them all when they start but all of them start to weaken in the story and the kids lose interest by the end of each.
They each start great but they change too many things in each one, too many new characters added in, probably to sell the figures I suppose, but it negatively effects the story line.
I only dropped 2 stars because the first 3 fifths of the story was good and engaging so 3 out of five stars seemed fair.",1484697600,,642,4.062992125984252
