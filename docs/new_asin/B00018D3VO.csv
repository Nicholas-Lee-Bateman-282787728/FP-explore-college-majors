8007698,1,B00018D3VO,"I purchased this product and wrapped it right away for Christmas. My little one was so excited when he opened in on Christmas morning. The next day he asked to watch it and opened it and was very disappointed to find a COMPLETELY different movie in the case. And to boot it was NOT EVEN a Berenstain Bears movie. We got some Easter Charlie Brown movie in the case. My fault for not opening it before he did, but I would think that the movie inside the case matched the movie on the outside by default. THIS WAS A CHRISTMAS DISASTER!",1482710400,,532,4.2772277227722775
