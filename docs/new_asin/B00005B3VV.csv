7936658,1,B00005B3VV,"As much as I enjoy Federico's compilation of tango music on his CD's (which I highly recommend), this DVD (as well as other two in the series) was a disappointment; probably the most worthless of an number of instructional videos (and live instructors) I've seen over 3.5 years.",1190419200,,278,4.8125
7936659,5,B00005B3VV,"Federico teaches much differently than other great teachers. He does not divide beginners, intermediate and advanced based on a conglomerate of often partially learned tango.

He divides beginners as those who study all the techniques carefully; the intermediate as those who put them in to practice with a partner and further advance.

Lastly, he teaches them to use their technique leading/following skills to DANCE with the music.

As a Karate (Dan Ivan, Hidetaka Nishiyam) student the learning sequence is also used and is outstandingly successful.",1187913600,,552,5.470588235294118
