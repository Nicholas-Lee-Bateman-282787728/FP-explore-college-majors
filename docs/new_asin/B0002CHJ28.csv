8025951,5,B0002CHJ28,"Gregory Horror Show is a strange kind of show; it's in the same vein as Tales From the Crypt, but also with drastically shorter episodes (roughly 2-3 minutes each) and has a single plot happening through the entire show.",1522540800,,220,4.666666666666667
8025952,5,B0002CHJ28,"I was introduced to this series a while ago, and I've been hooked on it ever since. The episodes are somewhat short, but it is a nice little show to watch, and is fairly addictive.",1456704000,,180,4.171428571428572

8025954,5,B0002CHJ28,"I am a sucker for stories that have deep meanings, deal with the darker parts of human nature and make you want to think. The Gregory Horror Show is an amazing piece of animation. It has a deep storyline, dark morals and a cast of characters you will never forget.
I warn you, this is not for the very young or faint of heart, as it contains coarse language and other ""suggestive"" parts. Still, if you are prepared for an emotionally mature adventure, then I highly recommend this.",1404000000,,481,4.4772727272727275
8025955,5,B0002CHJ28,I love this dvd! The characters look like they are made of folded paper to me rather than blocks. All of the characters are interesting in different and kinda creepy ways. This is not for little kids but I have three teenagers and they all love it. Each segment has a little life lesson to get you thinking.,1294099200,,307,4.310344827586207
8025956,3,B0002CHJ28,"Gregory is like art. You may love it, you may hate it, but you will think about it long after you see it. It reminds me of the old computer games that were blocky. At first it turns you off as cheap, but then you realize it is an excellent way to convey mood. it kind of creeps you out in the way  anime bad guys wear masks and you don't really know what goes on behind them. Some of it is silly, some disturbing, some over the top, but over all it''s compelling. It''s one of those things you watch when you're chillin' and thoughtful. It will annoy anyone looking for an action fix as most of it cerebral. My first viewing I didn't care for it, but after a while I watched it again and now am planning to buy #2.",1197504000,,714,3.993006993006993
8025957,1,B0002CHJ28,"seriously, this movie is bad. I like scary stuff, and animated stuff, so I thought I'd like this movie. and I was very, very wrong. the episodes in the movie aren't scary at all. they aren't funny, either. they're just really stupid. not 'funny jackassery' stupid, but 'why the hell did I pay money for this' stupid. I mean, the movie tries real hard to be scary, and make you think, and make you get all freaked out, but it fails horribly at all three things. it just left me kicking myself for buying this horrible, horrible movie.",1110326400,,533,4.448979591836735
8025958,5,B0002CHJ28,"Gregory Horror Show is the story of a hotel for lost souls run by its mysterious proprietor Gregory, a misshapen rat who takes pleasure in scaring his customers out of their wits. The main character (he has no name, but he's obviously meant to represent the viewer, as you see the world through his eyes) makes his way to Gregory House in the middle of the night, and finds that checking in is easy; checking out is the hard part. If Gregory doesn't stop him, then the other guests will. And there's also the question of whether you would want to leave at all...

Gregory Horror is a surreal and sometimes disturbing horror-comedy feature that challenges the viewer in every episode. Its short, almost Twilight Zoneish episodes focus on one of the guests at a time, each of which represent a different facet of the viewer's personality or world. There's the Mirror Man, who has lost his own identity and exists only to show others their true self; Cactus Gunman, who challenges the other guests to hallway duels without any idea of why they're fighting; Judgement Boy, who forces guests to make split-second decisions with either their heart or their head; and many more, totaling 48 in all. (Not all are in this first DVD, however.) The stories can be chilling one minute and hilarious the next, and your host Gregory is the thread stringing them all together. I will say that the story begins to develop and pick up in the last half of the series, which culminates in a weird, fulfilling ending that's sure to creep out and satisfy even the stingiest viewer.

Gregory Horror is illustrated in a strange style. It's 3DCG, and each character has a blocky body, almost like they were made out of Legos. The backgrounds don't seem like much at the beginning, but the characters move fluidly, and this is a much more character-driven series than anything else. The different areas in Gregory House also begin to get more complex as the DVD goes on, such as Roulette Boy and Clock Master's rooms. The English dub (this is dub only) is excellent and hard to find fault with, and the music is also evocative and more than serves its purpose.

The extras include promos of the GHS action figures, five episodes of the GHS series ""Bloody Karte,"" (basically, Gregory Hospital) and some trailers for other Geneon series.

In conclusion, Gregory Horror is perfect for fans of black humor, horror in general, quirky Japanese anime, the Twilight Zone/Night Gallery, or for anyone just looking to have a good and somewhat thought-provoking time.",1095811200,15,2531,4.771689497716895
