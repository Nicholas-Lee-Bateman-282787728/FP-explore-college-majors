8754343,5,B01CXJXHY6,"Russia has a lot of excellent movies which is very difficult to find in the US.  This one is a great answer to 12 angry man, less dramatic but deeper.  It is about how to allocate limited parking spots in a department.  People around the world can relate to the dynamics discussion as it is really humane thus universal.  And unlike 12 angry men, where a hero solves the problem, this one has more interesting plot and outcome.  I feel sorry that the only chance I get to see great Russian movies are on airplanes.  Politics always gets in the way of art appreciation, and that is the case everywhere.",1471824000,2,601,4.418181818181818
