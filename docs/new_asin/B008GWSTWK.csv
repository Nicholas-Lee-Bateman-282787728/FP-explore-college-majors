5160642,5,B008GWSTWK,"I've watched a generous handful of CT's fresh-riffed movies by this point, and though I think they all had their moments, this is the one that I nearly fell off the couch for. This movie almost plays like it was created for Hodgson and the rest of the Titans to make fun of. The acting, writing, directing, music, sets, effects, did I mention the acting, are epically awful. A third of the film didn't even need commentary; the silence during awkward pauses, a particularly terrible dialogue exchange, and the audience is cracking up while the riffers stand there nodding and smiling. Cinematic Titanic Live creates an ""all in this together"" feel which is thoroughly enjoyable for MSTies who can't help but hero-worship the godfathers of movie riffing. I have a nostalgic fondness for Shadowrama, but to watch Joel, Trace, Mary Jo, Josh, and Frank actually perform (and flub their lines, ad-lib, and crack each other up meanwhile) is just a whole 'nother level. Never stop, guys.

The plot of this movie? That's a tough question. Basically, a space ship crash-lands near a small town, and the aliens have the powers of a face-sucking sentient blender set to ""liquify."" Cue the inevitable sequence of events: teenagers making out in a car, small-town sheriff disguised as Jeff Foxworthy, corrupt money-hungry mayor, spunky girl-reporter, mysterious invisible creatures in the bush, ridiculous death scenes, and walking. Lots of walking. What makes this movie stand out, though, is that it contains the worst acting I have ever seen, and I'm including my little sister's elementary-school production of ""Celebrate The Sixties!!!"" which did not, strictly speaking, involve any actors. Neither does this movie. It's the only film in existence that could actually be improved with the addition of Torgo.

Of course, it's not every review where the invocation of Torgo would be considered a positive thing. But if you're watching CT, you know what you're getting into. Alien Factor is top-notch riffing material, and the Titans follow through with top-notch riffing. It's been two days since I watched it, and it's still making me smile.",1341792000,16,2131,5.103151862464183
5160643,5,B008GWSTWK,"Of the cinematic titanic DVDs I've seen so far (up to 5 now), this is one of the best. The only other one that might've been as good is the war of the insects. I highly recommend this to anyone interested. Each one of the cast had me laughing tears at least once.",1442188800,,263,3.981132075471698

5160645,4,B008GWSTWK,"I've seen all the MST3K episodes and a few RiffTrax. All in all, The Alien Factor is absolutely hilarious. Definitely harks back to classic MST3K episodes. The movie itself is incredibly incompetent. The Creeping Terror could only aspire to this level of incompetence, and the riffing really takes advantage of that.

What did bother me a little was seeing them riffing. It took me about half an hour to adjust to seeing the riffers reading their lines. I realize that they were reading lines all along the way in the show, but you didn't see them doing it, and from a theater perspective, I just found it slightly off-putting. However, the riffing was still top-notch, although the timing was off a little at the beginning. I would have given 4.5 stars if I could.",1441065600,,765,4.708955223880597

5160647,5,B008GWSTWK,"Classic work by Joel Hodgson and all of the crew except Mike, Kevin, and Bill (who have had their own thing going with Rifftrax). The movie itself is utterly ridiculous,which is to say I liked it - terrible, but doesn't take itself too seriously. Anyone needing an MST3K fix will enjoy this!",1439856000,,291,4.615384615384615

5160649,3,B008GWSTWK,"Think of ""Cinematic Titanic"" as MST3K Lite. The same concept... the same people... but one of the funny robot stuff. Just the actors sitting around a screen - with a live audience - speaking rehearsed lines over a really, really awful movie. I've watched a couple of episodes, and they're fairly funny. If you liked MST3K, you'll probably think ""Titanic"" is at least okay.",1439164800,,372,4.828125
5160650,5,B008GWSTWK,"I love these guys. This was another homerun! So funny. I have to say, though, that I enjoy, just as much as the jokes, the moments when the movie is so ridiculous that the audience laughs all on their own.",1439078400,,205,4.15
5160651,5,B008GWSTWK,"Seriously a good watch and a great laugh. I was able to by this DVD at GenCon 2015 this year! I originally bought it cause I needed something for Trace Beaulieu to Sign (My Favorite Mad Scientist!), and I had previously purchased ""The Frank"" DVD the day before just to get a look at some of their newer stuff, which was also a fun watch.
Anyway, back to the this DVD. It was hilarious! If you love MST3K(And if you don't know what that means, shame on you!), this is perfect. Now, I love rifftrax as well, but what I still like about this, is that they are there on the screen while they riff the movie. And it's performed live in front of an audience. Not Saying that I need a laugh track, but it's great to actually see their jokes working on more than just me. And the trailers for the other Films are great as well. I can't wait to buy them all!",1438732800,,849,4.120481927710843
5160652,5,B008GWSTWK,"I really enjoyed this movie.  Maybe it was because I liked the Galaxy Invader (even without riffs) and many of the same actors were in this movie.  I assume it was done by the same group.  It had a nice stand alone quality that moved right along, and the riffing was superb.",1437523200,,274,4.230769230769231

5160654,5,B008GWSTWK,"Finest film ever made by Cinemagic Visual Effects. Or, at least, my favorite Cinematic Titanic.

5160659,4,B008GWSTWK,"This is one of the few Cinematic Titanic productions that recaptured the snarky feel and quick wit of MST3K.  The underlying movie is, of course, dreadful, which is wonderful for commentary.  Watch for the ""forced perspective"" remarks, which explains how you can have a gigantic spaceship when you don't have a gigantic spaceship!  I would never suggest that anyone should start drinking if they don't already, but if you do, this is the time.",1430956800,,443,4.95945945945946
5160660,5,B008GWSTWK,"Hilarious, simply hilarious. The film was so incredibly bad - nearly every aspect was evidence of poor decision making on the part of the film's producer, director, and casting directors that it was rife for riffing. Joel and the gang broke into giggles frequently which makes for even greater fun. The scene in the bar with the rock band will have you rolling.

5160673,1,B008GWSTWK,"Without the snarky commentary this has to be one of the worst movies ever made. It must have been a film school project at a school with a very small budget. The ""state police"" officer drives a VW Bug. The ambulance is a compact hatchback. The woods are full of alien monsters but all the townspeople keep walking around in the woods. The monster costumes are on the level of elementary school Halloween costumes. The woods have snow but there is no snow in town.

There must have been a sale on mustaches at the costume store. All the ""actors"" ashamed to let their friends and family know they are in this dog have bushy mustaches.

One of the monsters is a large animated reptile which you can see through. The reptile which is fighting a character seems to be from anther video, probably from a class on animation.",1424995200,,817,4.476510067114094

5160676,4,B008GWSTWK,"Watch out for the jerky picture quality! For some reason, the print of ""Rattlers"" that they're using in this live show is skipping video frames from beginning to end, but the riffing is so strong that the audience barely seems to notice. Besides, the poor image quality reminds us that this is typical 1970s grindhouse cinema: a silly script, amateurish acting, and a shooting budget so low that at least one hospital scene had to be filmed from the parking lot.

Can the rampaging rattlers be stopped? Will the liberated (but not very competent) feminist photographer and her chauvinistic herpetologist partner settle their differences and find true love? Will the army get around to closing a base that's being staffed by only four soldiers? These and other burning questions...",1424044800,,780,5.046511627906977

5160682,5,B008GWSTWK,"The Alien Factor was a horrible 'B' movie with terrible acting, but made funny by the remarks of the original Mystery Science Theater crew. This is about as good as MST3K movies get. Check out the ridiculous cop cars in this movie. Obviously, the movie budget didn't allow for anything resembling a real police car. The State Police can only afford a Volkswagen Bug. Ha! :) It makes you wonder what state they're in. No Fast & Furious here.

5160685,5,B008GWSTWK,The Titans of comedy commentary are clearly having fun verbally assaulting this grade D gutter-budget sci-fi effort.  The unintentional humor never flags and in fact builds.  The commentators capitalize on it and know when to step back for a moment and let the bad acting create it's own laughter.  I've seen this ensemble live and have watched and rewatched this treasure with delight.,1404777600,,386,5.095238095238095

5160687,5,B008GWSTWK,"Every bit as great (and terrible) as you remember from MST3K! These guys are the last word in the art of movie riffing. It is even further entertaining to see Mary Jo Pehl and Frank Conniff riffing movies.
If I didn't know better, I'd say that this Don Dohler classic was made just to be riffed by CinTi. Absolutely hilarious episode!",1398902400,,334,4.491803278688525
5160688,5,B008GWSTWK,"I viewed The Alien Factor for the first time when the Cinematic Titanic tour stopped in Princeton, NJ a couple of years back.  I don't think they could have picked a better movie to riff in front of a live audience.  This movie has pretty much everything you could possibly want in a ""good"" bad movie, including bad acting, terrible production values, and low-budget props and monsters.  At the same time, it appeared that most of the people involved with the movie tried to take it seriously when it was made, which in a weird way makes it more enduring than ""bad"" bad movies that come off like they are ""in"" on the joke.  The movie wasn't great, but that's what makes is good.  If you haven't seen The Alien Factor and like b-movies, definitely get it.

As an added bonus, Cinematic Titanic includes a number of the original writers from MST3K, so if you liked the early ""Joel"" years of MST3K, this is a real treat (no, I'm not starting a beef with Mike - The Film Crew are also great).",1396224000,,988,4.4010989010989015
5160689,5,B008GWSTWK,This was an absolute treat.  Love the live DVDs over the earlier ones.  Glad someone decided to film the riffing in front of a audience.  My Girlfriend was in tears she was laughing so hard.  Rattlers has some odd choices but that is why it was able to make the cut for being riffed on.,1393632000,,286,4.1454545454545455

Lots of laughs at the movies's expense, and the live crowd loved it too, but upon repeated viewing, I have to say,  overacting and /or NO acting aside, I did get a sense that these folks really put it out their for this movie, and the riffing isn't mean spirited.

One of the bonuses is that it was recorded Live and so you get to enjoy the group riffing on the movie with about one hundred of your closest friends.  As always, the quality of the movie or, for that matter, the name of the very movie itself is not as important as how funny the group from CT can make it with their riffs.  They make it very funny -- and with the energy of a live audience, it's even better.  The movie is 'The Alien Factor' and it was made by a guy in Maryland in his backyard fora budget of about one hundred dollars (maybe not even US dollars).  It involves an alien and people and Maryland.  And of course, the Cinematic Titanic crew. -- CT performed its last show on Dec. 31 in Philly (I had the good fortune to be there with my wife) and so these artifacts of one of the funniest groups and their take on bad movies shouldn't be missed.

Even though MST3K has been off TV since 1999, they are more popular now then they were in their ten year run on Comedy Central and the Sci Fi Channel. However, without the G-rated limitations that MST3K had to follow being on TV and some fans being under the age of 13, they are even more hilarious in Rattlers. You can imagine all the snake joke references which I won't get into, Cinematic Titanic is as good if not better than MST3K. You have Joel, Trace, Frank, Mary Jo, and Josh riffing just an awful movie that will make you break out in laughter every few seconds. I laughed so much my ribs began to hurt. This was sold out on Amazon and finally came back into stock a few weeks ago. Get yourself a copy before it sells out again. Entertainment Weekly last month said that MST3K is one of the hundred best shows ever to air on TV. TV Guide called it one of the best cult shows ever to air on TV.

5160707,5,B008GWSTWK,Awesome live show!  Definately one of Cinematic Titanic's top efforts. The movie is bizarre and the riffing is top notch.  Comparable to earlier effors such as Dangers of Tiki Island and East Meets Watts.  Same corny dialoge and a romance that seems very forced by the actors.,1345593600,,276,4.829787234042553
5160708,5,B008GWSTWK,"It's great! Of course all their work is great in my opinion. YAY! Just buy it! YAY!

5160709,4,B008GWSTWK,This live DVD was a hoot.  I loved the comments and truly the riffing of Cinematic Titanic was the only thing that makes this bad 70's movie even remotely watchable.,1345248000,,165,4.5
5160710,5,B008GWSTWK,"It's been a long time since Cinematic Titanic has released a DVD, which is frustrating for fans, but perhaps unavoidable, since they're primarily in the business of touring these days.  However, having watched them live-riff a movie I'd first seen them do on DVD (WASP WOMAN, a last minute replacement for the scheduled film), they're less vulnerable to burning through their material than one might suspect, since differing audience reactions, ad libs, and continual rewrites help to make each show unique.  That said, I would have preferred to see the sword 'n sandal picture that's a part of their current rotation, since that genre produced some of my favorite MST3K episodes, but RATTLERS is a completely satisfying alternative.

Starring Sam Chew, Jr., the guy who played the smarmy, ambitious vice-dean in the MST episode BEING FROM ANOTHER PLANET, this effort to cash in on the post-JAWS, killer animal craze offers a threadbare budget, a no-name cast, slack-jawed direction, and a plot that meanders like Billy in one of those dotted-line ""Family Circus"" panels.  In other words, it's perfect for the CT treatment, and they make the most of it, delivering an extremely funny commentary.  A fine addition to the Cinematic Titanic library, and a must-see for devotees of the Art of the Riff.",1345248000,,1298,5.075117370892019
5160711,5,B008GWSTWK,"Excellent, funny, fast paced and right on the money! Buy this DVD and you won't be sorry. Great movie riffing for all!",1345248000,,118,4.409090909090909
5160712,5,B008GWSTWK,"In case you're not aware of the background of the 'performers' of the Cinematic Titanic series... there was an American TV cult comedy show that ran from 1988 to 1999 called 'Mystery Science Theater 3000' (MST3K for short). The premise was... well, the premise really doesn't matter, the point was the show was an excuse to screen bad movies, and make fun of them through commentary during the screening.

Years later, the original cast and writers of MST3K reassembled into two separate groups: Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett are ""Rifftrax"" and Joel Hodgson, Trace Beaulieu, Frank Conniff, Josh Weinstein, and Mary Jo Pehl are ""Cinematic Titanic"" and both groups continue the tradition of making fun of movies that deserve to be mocked.

Both groups are excellent at the job, but they have different styles. Rifftrax is witty and make a lot of topical and cultural references that make you smile if you keep track of what's in vogue.  It's also very US oriented and frankly doesn't travel as well (I should mention I'm in the UK). Cinematic Titanic is broader, simpler, more accessible humour, and I'd be more likely to recommend a Cinematic Titanic title to my UK friends than a Rifftrax title.

And 'Rattlers' is a good example of Cinematic Titanic at its best. A silly movie about radiation-crazed rattle snakes terrorizing a small community, and the crew have a lot of fun with it and it made my household laugh out loud. If you want 'funny' in an economical package, this Cinematic Titanic DVD is better value than many of the so-called 'comedy' films of 2012.",1345248000,,1584,4.833948339483395
5160713,5,B008GWSTWK,"My sides hurt. You'll have to watch it a couple of times to get all the jokes. Sometimes you laugh so hard, you don't hear all of them. If you love movie riffing, do yourself a favor and get this!!!",1345248000,,198,3.975
5160714,5,B008GWSTWK,"A joke is a straight line between comic and audience. A riff is a triangle between the comic, the audience, and the movie. This explains how it can be so hilarious!! Did you enjoy MST3000? The masters behind that are back and this latest installment lives up to their side splitting sarchasm we've come to know and love.",1345248000,,320,4.5344827586206895
5160715,5,B008GWSTWK,"I have every CT and mst3k episode, including the KTMA episodes, and they've only gotten better.
Rattlers is pure 70's awesomeness! Our hero, a bland, sexist herpetologist unwillingly teams up with a sassy feminist photographer to solve the mysterious plague of deaths from snake bites. There's chemistry-free romance & lame conspiracy around every corner... and Cinematic Titanic to make it watchable!

5160716,5,B008GWSTWK,"I really enjoyed Rattlers and though I was at first worried about Cinematic Titanic moving to a live format, I think it suits them and has been great on several titles. Having a touch of crowd feedback is nice. Being a '70s movie, be wary of slightly adult content but fairly understated.

I will also 'bandwagon' that people need to review this DVD product. A clearly marked as DVD item. This is not the place to add a 1 star review on a non-existent digital download product someone wished existed. Don't punish the DVD. In my opinion it should be removed as not pertaining to this DVD product. So make sure to at least read the 2 extremes before making your purchase.",1343347200,5,670,4.491803278688525
5160717,3,B008GWSTWK,"I love Cinematic Titanic, but this is definitely not the one I'd suggest starting with if you're new to the series. It's funny, but the movie drags to the point where even the riffing can't save it (there's several dead spots during the film) and it's kind of a chore to get through. Also, the ""live performance"" kind of hurts it this time around...the sound mix isn't good, and there were times when the movie made riffs inaudible. Like I said - try another episode before this one. If you're a fan, I'd get it, but maybe not right away.",1343260800,3,538,4.39

I met the case last winter and admire them and their talents. I know humor can be subjective - this one just didn't 'click' for me. The youtube trailer - covers most of what I found funny in this movie. I kind of prefer the 'studio' movies as opposed to the 'Live' ones - but note - my favorite happens to be a 'Live' DVD. I'm not slamming Cinematic - this is just Not a Movie I would reccomend to others. I'll still buy whatever the next release is.
P.S. there is some implied nudity in this movie.
Sincerely, Scott M.",1343001600,6,638,4.031496062992126
5160719,5,B008GWSTWK,"Super funny, as always. I love these live recordings - the in-studio ones were funny, too, but hearing them riff with a live audience pumps up their energy level and their love of performing really shines through.",1343001600,2,213,4.783783783783784
5160720,5,B008GWSTWK,"What can I say...this is another amazing CT release. Live DVDs are just too good and the closest some of us will get to experience a live show.
Do yourself a favor and pick this up , you will laugh very hard for so little money...that is a great deal to me.
Please ignore that stupid one star review complaining about downloads. Some people shouldnt even have access to a computer.

Have fun with CT and I hope they keep them coming!",1342828800,13,433,4.280487804878049
5160721,5,B008GWSTWK,"I'm writing this review mainly because of the other 1 star rating that is about the lack of a downloadable format. The reviews should be about the show itself, not someone's displeasure about having to order a DVD. I share the disappointment, but it's a temporary problem.
The show itself is another great live riffing by the CT crew. Fans of MST and CT will not be disappointed at all; bad movie, funny riffing...what more do you need?  The movie by itself is funny enough, but the CT crew add so much more to it. For over 2 decades these guys have never failed to deliver the goods and Cinematic Titanic has been on the same level and just as funny as anything done during the MST days; and his release only confirms that.  Not many comedy groups can pull that off.  When CT first started releasing live shows a few years back, I was worried they wouldn't measure up...sometimes live show don't work watching at home. But in the case of CT, the format works much better live that I could have imagined and I hope they continue on with live releases.",1342742400,12,1051,4.435233160621761

This has always been done on contract with EasyTakes, whose host had a catastrophic failure recently.  Assuming they get back up and running, you can bet the download will be available.

In the meantime, the trailer looks fun...as usual for Cinematic Titanic.  But I haven't seen it either, as it hasn't been released long enough for my copy to arrive.",1342656000,7,449,4.868421052631579

This movie was made by people whose only qualification besides not being able to act was they must have been related to the director, producer,etc. It makes the cast of Plan 9 look like Academy Award Winners.  NOT A SINGLE LINE was well read or acted. Count how many times the sheriff does his JC Penney catalog modeling pose!  Everything about this movie is awful. Every single line is highlighted by horrific acting.  And Cinematic Titanic brilliantly destroys/improves every scene with hilarious comments. Everyone was in absolute top form. We now own all of Cinematic Titanics movies. We have watched them too many times to count and still laugh uproariously.

8527716,5,B008GWSTWK,"Having experienced Cinematic Titanic Live for two different shows in 2013 I immediately wanted to get Cinematic Titanic Live - Rattlers and The CT crew did not let me down. Once again the movie chosen for riffing was the perfect victim -- barely enough plot to follow and barely enough acting to fill 90 minutes.  The riffers pounced and the live audience loved it.  Each member of the CT team had their perfect moment with incredibly comedic timing.  And unlike the show I saw where I was laughing so hard I missed other riffs, I could pause the DVD until I was ready for the next one.",1449187200,,586,4.457943925233645

This film made by people that are legit in the film industry? WOW! Just no. Production values: none, check. Actors, probably friends or the unforgiven that gave money to make the film or some folks walking by when there was film in the one camera, check. I would say, that if someone made a film that did none of things done in this film, you might be on the way to actual film making. Go opposite day. One of the best from Cinematic Titanic.
