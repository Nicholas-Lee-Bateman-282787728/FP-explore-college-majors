*Plot and ending analyzed*

Apache Drums (1951) is a tedious Western. Take an interesting theme like the Apache Indians, throw in enough filler to completely denude that, and then stage an absurd defensive sequence in a church, whereby the inept White townsfolk defeat the Apache Indians, who, for some reason, don't just go away, and that is what you have.

Most of the time of the film involves the constant bickering between two men (Stephen McNally as Sam Leeds and Willard Parker as Mayor Joe Madden).  A lot of talk as well is stuffed into the film, as the townsfolk sit in their houses doing nothing.  Why the Apaches don't attack is unknown.

There's also a highly annoying character, Arthur Shields as Rev. Griffin, whose bigotry and asinine comments minimizing the Apaches begins to wear thin.  Stephen McNally as Sam Leeds and Arthur Shields as Rev. Griffin hold off an Apache attack in an unbelievable sequence.

The Apache attack sequence in the church, although exceedingly ludicrous, is well lighted with Apache raiders colored in bright red or orange, which lends the scene to the unusual.

None of the actors are particularly likeable, since they both hate each other and really, I didn't care much. I just wanted to see a decent Western, but it's not here.",1490054400,,1316,4.865470852017937
8486075,4,B005TCKZ90,"Superior film boasting a brilliant transfer of the great Val Lewton's final production. Unfortunately, this French DVD does not provide the option to turn off the French subtitles. I was able to work around this by lowering the titles out of the frame with my OPPO all-region player. Also: I very much wanted to listen to Bertrand Tavernier's special feature introduction but alas it is only in French with no English subtitles. When in France....  These limitations preclude what would have been a five star review.",1478044800,,516,5.0
