4936338,5,B0063DOV2Q,I did not know about this series until Amazon pointed it out.  I love Julie Newmar as Catwoman - but now I have something else to love her for!,1333411200,5,143,3.9310344827586206
4936339,5,B0063DOV2Q,"i have always been a fan of julie newmar since her catwoman days. my husband actually remembered this show when it was on in prime time, and he loved it then. we bought it and we are really enjoying ""my living doll."" besides classic commercials, a lucille ball interview with julie, a current interview with julie, a bonus episode of ""doll"" and a bob cummings show, a huge photo gallery, this dvd set actually includes a soundtrack from the episodes. how cool is that? i've purchased many sets of classic shows and have never seen this added before. my favorite episode on this series is ""the beauty contest"" where rhoda is off to become ""miss shindig of the world."" i highly recommend this dvd.",1333411200,12,695,4.612903225806452
4936340,5,B0063DOV2Q,"My Living Doll was the delightful Julie Newmar's first TV series, starring with Bob Cummings, returning to television after TWO eponymous TV shows.  It was the second TV series by Jack Chertok in the genre he pioneered, what would eventually be known as the ""Magic Sitcom"". After a number of very successful Western shows including the legendary Lone Ranger, Jack tried his luck at comedy and knocked it out of the park with My Favorite Martian.  The premise of a hapless innocent suddenly caring for a somewhat unique individual (in this case, a Martian) proved quite the hit, and when he announced plans to swap the gender of the co-star with his second series, CBS bought the series blind, without so much as a pilot.

Julie Newmar plays Rhoda, AKA experiment AF 709, a robot (technically an android, but why quibble with names) designed to man one of America's space capsules. She gets out of her lab, and her builder solicits his colleague Dr. Bob McDonald (Cummings) to find her.  Bob is understandably sceptical of her makeup, but after a brief display of its specs and capabilities (rowr rowr), he realizes he's not on Candid Camera.  As soon as he accepts the facts at hand, things get crazier - AF 709's designer is called overseas, and asks Bob to care for the robot until he returns.

Needless to say, he doesn't return quickly.

Bob has to keep ""Rhoda's"" (hastily named after Bob's aunt) origins a secret from all and sundry, including his sister, his girlfriend (Doris Dowling) and his other colleague, physicist and lothario Peter Robinson (Jack Mullaney).  Aside from the simple problems of keeping an emotionless and literal-minded female robot from getting into embarassing social situations, they came up with rather ingenious malfunction plots as well.  In on episode, we learn that Rhoda is sensitive to the work of Lewis Carroll - he was a mathematician, and his verse is written (so the show explains) according to mathematic progressions that act like a virus to Rhoda's systems.

The show only lasted one season of 26 episodes, and Bob Cummings only lasted 21.  He left the show early, and Jack Mullaney's character was let in on the secret and given custody of Rhoda.

Sadly, like so many series from the early days of television, many episodes are lost.  The box set only includes 11 episodes, the only ones currently known to exist, one of which is of lesser enough quality that it's billed as a ""bonus episode"" in the special features. Other specials include a new documentary about the show, featuring interviews with Newmar and Doris Dowling, as well as producer Howard Leeds.  They also tracked down a radio interview with Julie and Lucille Ball (the show was filmed at Desilu Studios, hence the connection) and some of the original commercial breaks.

While the show itself may have (undeservedly) slipped through the cracks of TV history, many of its concepts and tropes didn't. Interestingly enough, this show is the first one to use the classic bit of robot dialogue ""That does not compute"". This is the show that set up the standards that would be used on Bewitched and I Dream of Jeannie in the coming years.  It's rather interesting that Martian, which proceeded it, would outstrip Doll by two years, three seasons to its one.  Perhaps the somewhat risque setup was a bit too wild for the time.

Julie Newmar is always a stunner (her brief appearance as Stupefyin' Jones in Lil' Abner is worth the price of admission), and her monotone delivery isn't wooden, it's perfect deadpan comedy.  Bob Cummings was as charming as ever, but even the producers admit in the documentary he was a bit old for the role.  One wonders if they'd given Rhoda to Jack Mullaney in the first place if the show could have gone a bit longer.  Jack had some solid comedy chops, and had a long career in character roles.  After Doll, he appeared in another one-season wonder, Sherwood Schwartz' It's About Time, as well as a return to the sexy robot genre, Doctor Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine, one of the Beach party films, starring Vincent Price in the title role.",1333065600,11,4082,4.793152639087019
4936341,5,B0063DOV2Q,"Television audiences in 1964 knew that Bob Cummings was a gifted comic actor following his
wonderfully funny and long-running ""Bob Cummings Show"" (aka ""Love That Bob"") - but what really made
this long-lost, single season sitcom so extra-special was the lovely and talented beauty Julie Newmar
as Rhoda the robot.

Debuting a year prior to ""I Dream of Jeannie,"" this program had some striking similarities, though
Cummings -- unlike ""Jeannie's"" Larry Hagman - was really too old for the male lead on ""Doll.""
Nonetheless, it is a very well written show and Julie displays a natural flair for comedy -- including
some memorably kooky moments.

I've seen an advance copy of this DVD set and it has an insightful half-hour featurette with Julie
along with series producer Howard Leeds and guest actress Jackie Joseph - plus tons of great photos
and behind the scenes details. There's also original sponsor spots, a fun Julie Newmar commercial from the
period and two terrific ""Let's Talk To Lucy"" radio shows where Lucille Ball interviews Julie during the
production of ""My Living Doll.""

It should also be noted that this official collection contains all 11 episodes that have been found of the
26 shows produced. The program's owner has lost the other 15 episodes and was able to put these together
with the help of various film archives and private collectors.

Should anyone be able to help provide additional episodes of this series, please contact MPI Home Video
in Orland Park, IL who has licensed ""My Living Doll"" from the owner, the estate of Jack Chertok, who
produced the series -- as well as the more well-know success ""My Favorite Martian.""

Again, ""My Living Doll"" is a real treat for anyone who enjoys classic '60s sitcoms and high calibre
performers like Julie Newmar.",1329696000,107,1779,4.936454849498328

He passes her off as the cleaning lady named Rhoda. Rhoda is basically a beautiful fembot and is the real star of the show. It will be fun watching these  episodes for the first time.

4936421,4,B0063DOV2Q,I did not see this when it first aired but I had seen bits of it.  It is a showcase for Julie Newmar and she pretty good.  Bob Cummings is not the horny guy that he played on his show.  An episode of his show is part of the extras shows how good he was at being a horh dog.  Julie is a bit stiff at first but I believe that was what the director wanted.  The episodes on the second disc shows a wilder side of the robot and Julie shines in these episodes.  I thought the pool shark is the best episode here.  The best scene is where she steals a policeman's motorcycle.  These episodes are good but getting real good at the end.  I doubt that volume 2 will come out but if it does I will get it.,1460073600,,695,3.8380281690140845

Julie Newmar was perfect in the role of Rhoda, the robotic being allegedly under the control of Robert Cummings.  Sometimes it was a tossup as to just who was in charge, but laughter always reigned supreme.  The girl-chasing neighbor and Bob's sister just added to the fun and games.

Bob had to get his sister to move in so he would not be (ostensibly) shacked up alone with a nubile young woman - because, of course, the plot is basically that nobody is supposed to know that she's a robot. Newmar trained as a dancer and it's apparent. She does a lot of sight gags and physical, almost slapstick, humor. Until someone pushes her ""off"" button ....",1397520000,5,747,4.452554744525547

She is just as classy as back then.

4936497,5,B0063DOV2Q,"I actually remember watching this show in it's original run on primetime TV in 1964. It was cancelled after only one season because ratings weren't as good as hoped, because some network idiot scheduled the show in a time slot against popular shows like Bonanza. However, the show itself is simply wonderful, primarily thanks to Julie Newmar as Rhoda, and would have done much better in another time slot, where an audience might have found it, as happened the very next year with ""I Dream Of Jeannie"", which had a similar premise (beautiful girl with unusual properties living with a military man).

Rhoda is a robot developed by NASA for the space program, in hopes that she can be sent on hazardous missions instead of risking human lives. She is very sophisticated, but a bit naive about social interactions, and has a tendency to take verbal commands very literally. When her builder is reassigned to Pakistan, the task of educating her in the ways of humans falls into the lap of Bob Cummings, who is busy with his own social life.

Rhoda reads a full page of text in less than five seconds, remembers every character on the page, learns to play the piano by watching a concert on television, and looks incredible in her 1964 one piece swimsuit. The primary humor in the show involves how her literal interpretation of instruction often places Bob in awkward circumstances socially.

""My Living Doll"" was never syndicated, and all episodes were believed lost until these 11 were discovered in 2012. It's truly great to see these again, and I hope that the remaining episodes will turn up as well.",1393200000,7,1602,4.776173285198556

When I saw this re-release, I was reluctant to spend the money; most of the stuff from the 60s doesn't live up to childhood memory.  This show, however, is an exception!

Yes, it's silly; it was supposed to be, and it still is.  Bob comes off a bit chauvinist for the 21st century, the female characters a bit non-PC, too, but in general it's just a lot of ""good, clean, fun""!",1362960000,5,512,4.08
4936504,4,B0063DOV2Q,"What a thrill to have this largely-forgotten ""one season wonder"" back in the spotlight thanks to this beautifully-assembled DVD release.  MY LIVING DOLL (1964-65) comes from the same delightfully-screwy decade which brought witches, genies, talking horses, flying nuns and monster families into TV viewers' homes all over the world.  Why it flopped was a combination of creative differences and less than ideal ratings, but the final result is still quite enjoyable.

Space Center psychiatrist Dr Robert McDonald (Bob Cummings) finds himself as the unwitting babysitter for a lovely female robot named Rhoda (Julie Newmar) when her inventor suddenly jets off to the Middle East.  Completely ill-equipped to understand the specific needs of his female houseguest - let alone a ROBOT female houseguest - Bob must attempt to assimilate and tame Rhoda into an ordinary young woman.  Complications exist in the form of Bob's glam but nosey sister Irene (Doris Dowling) and his randy apartment neighbour Peter Robinson (Jack Mullaney).

The show itself is quite cleverly put together.  As expected, a lot of the stories hinge on the ""Pygmalion""-like  relationship between Bob and Rhoda.  Bob Cummings (""The Bob Cummings Show"", ""My Hero"") was coming to the end of his days as a viable 'romantic leading man' when he took on this series - and apparently ruffled many a feather on the set with his attempts to re-write scripts and make the series more focused on his character and less about the LIVING DOLL.  Much controversy still clouds the chain of events that saw Bob Cummings ultimately leave the show before the end of the season.

Which brings us to the series' true star - Julie Newmar.  She is utter perfection as Rhoda, bringing a lovely nave, non-threatening quality to the obvious sexiness which the role might have otherwise implied.  Well-trained in the art of mime and in all forms of dance, her physicality is truly something to witness.  Had the series managed to go on for at least another season, without a doubt, Newmar as Rhoda would have been placed  alongside Elizabeth Montgomery (from ""Bewitched"") and Barbara Eden (""I Dream of Jeannie"") on that rarefied pedestal reserved for the great Sixties sitcom leading ladies.

For a series as ""forgotten"" as MY LIVING DOLL still is, sadly not all the episodes from its single season have been able to be pristinely preserved like ""Bewitched"" and ""Jeannie"".  Only 11 episodes have been located for this 2-DVD set.  MPI Video is actively searching for more missing episodes and I'd urge anybody who can assist in that department to please get in touch with either MPI or The Jack & Florence Chertok Trust.  This set is labelled as ""Volume One"", so fingers crossed there are at least a few more episodes around the corner.

Extra Features are plentiful, as to be expected.  MPI has proven to be quite the treasure trove when it comes to their vintage TV releases and this release doesn't disappoint.  For starters there is ""Remembering My Living Doll"" which runs almost 30 minutes and includes new interviews with Julie Newmar, producer Howard Leeds and Jackie Joseph (guest star in the episode ""The Love Machine"").  ""Let's Talk to Lucy with Julie Newmar"" is a vintage audio interview taken from Lucille Ball's radio show (other episodes have found their way to MPI's ""Here's Lucy"" releases).  An alternate opening credits sequence sees Julie Newmar in a very cute (but risqu&eacute; for the time) baby-doll nightie which was soon dumped in favour of the evening gown seen in the final version.  There's also an assortment of original sponsorship bumps, interactive photo gallery, plus a bonus episode from ""The Bob Cummings Show"" - might MPI be considering bringing out some complete seasons sets of that series?

MY LIVING DOLL will be an essential purchase for lovers of Sixties TV comedies.  Despite its brief life, the show remains a refreshing delight.  What fun to have Rhoda back again.",1360022400,8,3950,5.0261136712749614

While it only lasted for one season, it left an indelible mark on the minds on the fans.

  Julie Newmar shows an uncanny sense of comedic timing throughout this show.  She does a beautiful job of portraying a newly assembled robot that was activated wihtout any programming other than the 'default setting' per say.

  Her creator loses track of her and that's where the fun begins.  She has all the intelligence in the world.  Yet, when she's given a command with the use of slang terms, the comedy begins.  As any robot would, she follows the commands - TO THE LETTER.  Ms. Newmar is a rather physical comedienne.

  In fact, one of the extra features in the DVD set includes some interviews that Ms. Newmar did on the Lucille Ball radio show.  MS. Ball gave Ms. Newmar rave reviews about her performance on the show.  You can't get better cudos than that.  She is also very intelligent.  You got an appreciation of Ms. Newmar's spontenaneos wit in these interviews.

  Robert Cummings' performance played an odd counter-balance to Ms. Newmar's character.  While he seemed to be out of place in this sit-com, he still managed to play a clumsy straight man.  This is a great addition for any fan of old style tv shows and Julie Newmar.",1342915200,6,1512,5.282700421940929
4936540,4,B0063DOV2Q,"I  was 5 when this was first on in 1964 - 65.  I do not remember it at all.  I bought it on a whim.  I am a fan of nearly any show from the 60's and 70's.  I am happy I bought it.  This show is funny, charming and playfully innocent, kind of in the same way ""I Dream of Jeannie "" was.  There were a number of problems with the show though, that led to it not having a 2nd season.  1.  Schedual.  It aired at the same time as  Bonanza.  Well, no one could  beat that show.  I even watched it at the age of 5  and I am still a big fan.  2.  Robert Cummings.  He was not right for the part.  Yes, he is a good actor and i love his other show ""Love that Bob"" but this role requiered a younger man.  He seems to be forcing himself in this role.  It is painfully obovious that Julie compleatly dominates the screen and you can tell that Bob is no match for her.  3.  Bob Cummings quit the show before the 1st season was finished.  Leaving 5 episodes unfilmed.  These 3 things killed the show.  The over all quality of the show is fair. The writing, directing and acting.  That is untill the episode ""The Beauty Contest"".  Here the show finds it footing and really shines, all to the credit of Julie, who is wonderful , funny and charming all at the same time.  Julie  has perfect comedic timing. Her movements, expressions and voice  are perfect as the robot.  I feel the show would have lasted if 1.  They moved it to a different night  and time.  2.  Bob Cummings didn't quit and he let Julie really take over the show.  She was the show.  It was her's.  But if the show did last longer, she never would have been Catwoman on Batman, so you take catnip and lose the  transisters.",1341100800,6,1675,4.0184049079754605
4936541,4,B0063DOV2Q,"I was young enough when this series aired that I cannot remember how many of them I originally watched. As a child, I loved the idea of ""Rhoda the Robot"". Now, seeing these episodes as an adult, I was struck by how sexist the series is. Just on the cusp of the ""swingin' sixties"" (1964-65), the men are all leering over Rhoda and say the most outrageous things. The humor is NOT up to the level of the classic ""My Favorite Martian"" from the same producer (Jack Chertok). HOWEVER! Julie Newmar does some excellent acting as The Doll (a.k.a Rhoda), and the episodes have a fair amount of fun in them. Three stars for the episodes themselves.

I have added a star for the very existence of this set. With the exception of the ""bonus"" episode, reproduced from inferior materials (but one of the funnier episodes), the surviving episodes look amazingly good for a one-season black-and-white program that has had little or no rerun time since. The modern-day interview and the Lucille Ball audio interviews are welcome bonus features. Kudos to the persistence of the people who assembled the package.

I hope the remaining episodes of the series (particularly the few without Bob Cummings, who left the show before the season ended) can be found and released in another set. Even if they cannot, it's great to finally see this show about which I remembered for years.",1338249600,14,1361,4.738396624472574
4936542,3,B0063DOV2Q,"It was fascinating to watch MY LIVING DOLL after all these years, even if the only material available is sub-par (16mm work prints) and not all of the episodes are available.  It's clearly the template for I DREAM OF JEANNIE (set at a space center, Cummings' psychiatrist might as well be Dr. Bellows, second banana Jack Mullaney is a Roger Healy clone, etc.).  Interestingly, the show's most original asset -- lead Julie Newmar's inspired rendition of Rhoda -- never really caught on with the American public.  Perhaps the statuesque Rhoda's ""goofy strangeness"" was a bit too inaccessible for a viewing audience that didn't think twice about embracing Barbara Eden's childlike warmth and Liz Montgomery's winsome ways.  As for star Robert Cummings' legendary ""miscasting"" I can say only this: great as Newmar is, it is the genial and always-inventive Cummings who keeps this gimmick-dependent bauble afloat.  Too old for the part?  Excuse me, his role is a thinly-veiled Henry Higgins, with Rhoda the innocent, awkward young female he instructs in the ways of the world... learning something about himself in the process.  Mullaney is the Freddie character, Eliza's beau, closer to her age and the ""logical"" love interest.  But it's odd-couple Higgins and Eliza we're really rooting for, hoping against hope that this teacher/student relationship will eventually blossom into something romantic.  The same exact character growth dynamic is in place here, with Cummings perfectly cast as the charmingly fatuous, set-in-his-ways playboy shrink who thinks he can create ""the perfect woman"" by approaching Rhoda's cultural tutoring as a detached social experiment.  This requires a mature comedic actor, not the latest in-his-20s dreamboat.  Like Higgins, Cummings' character learns (or would have learned, if the series didn't tank) that women aren't ""experiments"" or ""living dolls"" to be manipulated by immature scientists hiding behind their PhDs.  Amusingly, we get the impression that smarter-than-ya-think Rhoda realizes this all along, and is simply humoring her ""all-wise"" bachelor master.  Gary G.",1336953600,46,2103,5.473684210526316
4936543,5,B0063DOV2Q,"Some years ago, before MPI released this DVD, I hunted out some of this show's episodes and bought them on DVR from a private dealer.  But with this release, I can see the joy and fantasy of *My Living Doll* in nice, sharp clarity of sound and video.  Unabashedly I love this show, largely for Julie Newmar's presence.

I was surprised (but not surprised) to learn she studied with Marcel Marceau--and so much of that nonverbal prowess shows here!  Ms. Newmar might be more appreciated for her work as Catwoman on the BATMAN series, but for me, she's never been better than she is on this show.  Her innocence, wide-eyed wonder and the seeming lack of awareness of how dang sexy she is in the role--these are traits that make the show a joy.  Yes, she's playing a robot, but no, she's not static.  Take the limber kinesthesia she enacts with easy grace in ""The Pool Shark"" episode; focus on her in the background when Bob Cummings is in the forefront.  Or try not to utter a little gasp when Ms. Newmar glides through Chopin (Yes, she's really playing it herself) in ""The Beauty Contest.""

Twenty-nine when she starred on the show, Ms. Newmar OWNED this show. While I'm a fan of Bob Cummings and always enjoyed ""Love That Bob,"" and still do on DVD, Ms. Newmar is the sun around which this show revolves.  I can only hope and pray the other fifteen shows have somehow survived, as Ms. Newmar has said she finally felt at peace in ""Rhoda's"" skin only after the thirteenth show.  Boy, you wouldn't know it by her performances here.  Great stuff.

And by the way: the reviewer who complained that his discs were mislabeled since they contained ""My Favorite Martian"" and ""The Honeymooners"" instead of the series--perhaps those discs never moved beyond the first ten minutes of play.  Both shows are featured in this disc set as commercials for other DVDs by MPI.  The *Living Doll* episodes start right after the extended clips for those contemporary programs.  I, for one, felt the ads offered more bang for my buck. . . but at less than $20.00 for the whole shebang, I'd say I more than got my money's worth.

At the risk of misquoting Charles Dickens, ""Please, sir. More shows, please!""",1334361600,30,2184,4.602067183462532
4936544,4,B0063DOV2Q,"If you are Dr. Robert MacDonald, professionally you are a psychiatrist, but on a personal level you are - one might say - a playboy, a man devoted to a lifetime of chasing women, not that you ever intend to catch one; marriage is the last thing on your mind.  You believe that you fall in that rare class of men known as ""God's gift to women!""

You were perfectly happy in your pursuits until one day Dr. Miller - a brilliant engineer - asks you to take care of something while he is away on assignment.  Now normally you might expect to be asked to feed the cat or water the plants, but in his case he wants you to inconspicuously take care of his Top Secret, hot female robot!  At first you thought she would cramp your style with all of your lady friends, but then suddenly you realize that this robot could fulfill your fantasy of the ideal woman: one who does what she is told and keeps her mouth shut!

While Dr. Miller had preloaded her with 50 mega-items of information, her education was by no means complete.  She understood all of the basic commands such as: sit down, stand up, lie down, walk, stop, turn around and etc., but she didn't know how to get dressed!  She learns by mimicking what she sees, repeating what she hears, and most importantly she will obey your every command.  She's your perfect woman, but remember the old saw: ""Be careful what you wish for!""

Overall:  Although the robot was developed for the space program, the episodes have little or nothing to do with space but center around personal problems in Bob's life.  There is no spark, no chemistry at all between Bob and the sexy Rhoda.  It is the fine performance given by Julie Newmar as Rhoda that raises this series to a rating of 4.

Shows: ""Boy Meets Girl"", ""Rhoda's First Date"", ""Uninvited Guest"", ""Love Machine"", ""The Beauty Contest"", ""My Robot the Warden"", ""I'll Leave It to You"", ""The Pool Shark"" ""The Kleptomaniac"", ""The Witness"" and ""Something Borrowed, Something Blew {sic}.""  The last episode has a notice asking for information on the whereabouts of other episodes.

Features: ""Remembering My Living Doll"", ""Let's Talk to Lucy"", ""Alternate Opening Credits"" - a sexier opening, ""Sponsor Commercials"", ""My Living Doll Music Soundtrack Album"", ""The Bob Cummings Show Episode"" and ""Photo Gallery.""

8492012,5,B0063DOV2Q,"Review is for the MPI DVD release. This is a 2 disc compilation of the surviving footage of the My Living Doll show with Catwoman Julie Newmar. Fair warning, this show can be HIGHLY misogynistic and sexist, especially the earlier episodes. Try to keep an open mind and view thru the lens of the times. Very enjoyable bizarro acting from Newmar as she pretends to be a robot. Dead pan, mimicry, sorta cross eyed. Its so weird it works.

8492013,5,B0063DOV2Q,"Too young to watch it at the time it was first televised (I was only 10 and there is NO WAY my parents would have allowed me to watch such ""adult"" themed fare), I would have to wait until now to purchase the initial episodes and see what I missed all those years ago. I watched the first episode, laughing throughout, with my eyes watering (tears of joy?). Julie Newmar was STUNNING and the writing was crisp and funny. Bob Cummings was his ever-likable self. Three things kept popping into my mind as I watched it: 1) how much this show must have inspired the creation of I Dream of Jeannie, which debuted only a year later, 2) as good as Bob Cummings was, how much better a young Larry Hagman would have been, and 3) as good as Jack Mullaney was, Larry Hagman's co-star Bill Daley was even better. It's just a shame that this show, ahead of it's time, was not the long-term vehicle that Julie Newmar so richly deserved. I guess Barbara Eden, more cute than sexy (and without the navel), was what America was ready for, which allowed it to squeeze by the censors of the time. I'm grateful for the 11 episodes that have survived, but how wonderful it would be if all 26 episodes were to be released one day!",1507507200,3,1207,4.345132743362832
