8608356,3,B00EQ30D9K,"I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas.  When I put in the code to redeem my free digital copy I learned that the code was ""not for my region.""  I wasn't sure why.  Upon looking more closely at the packaging I realized the DVD was from the UK/Ireland region.  I panicked because DVD's are zoned.  I thought I wouldn't be able to play it.  This Blu Ray however let me play in my player with no issues. I'm bummed I can't redeem my free digital copy, that's why I buy Blu Ray instead of DVD, for the free digital copies, however, this does play.  Would rather have a DVD from my region.",1451433600,2,590,4.168141592920354
