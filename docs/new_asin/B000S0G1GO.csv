8203540,5,B000S0G1GO,"I bought this dvd because I wanted to learn as much as I could, and hear advice about planning and building a barn. This dvd did much more than just that! The dvd covers many areas of planning stalls, building pens, watering, feeding, flooring, ventilation, etc, etc. After watching the dvd, we were better able to plan on building our small barn. We are still in the process of building, and I know we have a good education now, on what we should do. I highly recommend this dvd set. It is really cute also, to see their kitties take part in the dvds too!",1320710400,,556,4.304761904761905
8203541,5,B000S0G1GO,"I have read many books and so far this DVD is a great summary for anyone planning on building or renovating a horse barn. Explanations are clear with many graphics and I think it's very useful. Plus, you save a lot of time watching the DVD instead of reading an entire book! There are sections on the DVD where you can easily watch again some sections of specific interest. Enjoy!",1317081600,,380,4.442857142857143
