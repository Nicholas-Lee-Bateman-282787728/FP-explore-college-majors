5360215,1,B009P368PO,"I quickly looked at the reviews and thought I was on to a sleeper movie.  I think the reviews must have been written by people associated with the film.  This is a total amateur, straight to video kind of film.  I watched it for about 20 minutes before shutting it off and wishing I could get my money back.  It felt like a high school production from the very first scene.  Nothing about this is professional - acting is poor - sets are lame - story is corny.  You'd be way better off watching a cornball lifetime movie.",1366934400,2,521,4.26530612244898
5360216,5,B009P368PO,"Awaken is an amazing heartfelt movie about believing in your dreams and following your heart.  It's romantic, emotional and thought provoking.......definately leads to great conversation once the movie is over.  Great for a date night :-) The positive and uplifting story pulls you in with a message of love, hope and fate.  This very powerful film is filled with emotion and inspiration while exploring the possibilities of love....A MUST SEE FOR ALL THE ROMANTICS OUT THERE!!!",1365897600,,478,5.2631578947368425
5360217,4,B009P368PO,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I am a big fan of Corey Sevier and he is amazing throughout.  If you are looking for a romantic movie, I would highly recommend this one.",1355788800,,167,4.1875
5360218,5,B009P368PO,"This touching movie is an emotional journey that will lead you through love, loss, romance and the courage to follow one's heart.  Although there is a tragic element to the story, it is very inspirational at the same time and not a dark or depressing movie.  The film is willing to dig deep emotionally to a satisfying end that left a lasting, positive impression with me.  I hope you enjoy this as much as I did!",1355616000,6,413,4.407894736842105
5360219,5,B009P368PO,"A good blend of science-fiction, mysticism and romance.  This film that has something for everyone.  My wife and I greatly enjoyed this movie.  It's a great date movie because, it's a good conversation piece over dessert or coffee afterwards.  It leaves questions in the air, however they can be answered after some thought.  And, it's a movie you have to watch more than once to catch everything.",1355529600,3,397,4.865671641791045
5360220,5,B009P368PO,"I saw this film at the Newport Film Festival and I'm so happy to finally find it on DVD!  Yay Amazon!  I really love this film.  Rarely do I write reviews for products, but, I really want people to find this little gem of a film that has a lot of heart and deep meaning to it.  It's a bit of mystery, a bit of science fiction and a good dose of romance all rolled in one.  My husband even liked it!  At the screening, the director had said that this was his homage to Somewhere In Time, which I love.  So if you like that film and/or want a film romance that touches your heart, most likely this will be a film for you!",1354838400,5,619,3.904

5360226,4,B009P368PO,So this is no high class Hollywood film. It's not passionate or super dramatic. But it is incredibly sweet and touching. Love can be innocent and transformative. Had me in my feels.,1503878400,,181,4.6875

5360231,5,B009P368PO,"I don't like romance. Just watched it because of the lead actor and expected to be bored, but it's fun and creative and gives viewers a satisfying ending -- though not necessarily the one they were expecting.",1432512000,2,208,4.648648648648648
5360232,1,B009P368PO,"poorly acted, unbelievable storyline",1431907200,,36,8.25

5360234,5,B009P368PO,"This was a ""my husband is gone and it's movie night"" flick.  Perfect with a glass or two of wine!",1414800000,,97,3.85
5360235,4,B009P368PO,"This movie is a nod to one of my all-time favorites, Somewhere in Time, with Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour. It's romantic, but is still about the journey we all have to take with loss, regardless of who we are. The movie begins by showing us how the story will end, but that doesn't detract from it. The story also leads us asking a tough question - is there a time limit on love? In other words, do we pull away emotionally when we know that our loved one is dying? It takes great strength and courage to love through circumstances that are inevitable.
I must also add that, even though the movie doesn't lead us on a deep emotional journey, it does touch on fate, and the courage to stand up for what we know our destiny to be. Enjoy!",1409875200,4,741,4.26241134751773
5360236,3,B009P368PO,The beginning of the film didn't do justice to the latter part of the story. It could have started out with more involvement in the relationships. On the suggestion of psychic phenomena was really what helped the story to the end. The cast could have been less deliberate of the activity since psychic phenomena seems to just happen unexpectedly with no real explanation why?,1394323200,,375,4.875
5360237,4,B009P368PO,It was a riveting movie for me. You need to look at it in several different ways to get to the point; at least I felt so. The name says it all I think.,1379289600,3,151,3.4705882352941178
5360238,5,B009P368PO,It's a story that illustrates what it feels like when you have deep connection with someone that isn't logical or linear. The fact that it isn't what is typically considered a happy ending doesn't diminish the emotional impact. Most relationships in real life don't make perfect sense but they still impact us so the story felt real in that way. The production felt a little overly clean but the acting pulled it together- lesser actors would have ruined it. Happy I got to see it.,1379203200,,481,4.670588235294118
5360239,5,B009P368PO,"Great movie to watch with a group of girlfriends! Pop some popcorn and fill your wineglass. You'll laugh, you'll cry. You'll love it. Enjoy!",1377043200,,140,4.875
5360240,3,B009P368PO,"I guess it has a point, yes it could be lovely for a lot of people, I just like more comedy romance movies. This one is kind of depressing !",1372204800,2,140,3.7
5360241,3,B009P368PO,"I like time travel movies and I enjoyed this one. It was kind of a mystery with a twist. Like the other reviewers said, it was uplifting, although at first an incident made me think it wouldn't be. The movie portrayed the power of love to help someone overcome fear. I must say that the actor portraying the hero's brother did a great job in making me dislike him--good acting.",1368403200,4,377,4.4
8543471,4,B009P368PO,"Romantic, positive, well-acted mystery about two kind, winsome people who meet in dreams and fall in love, to the betterment of both.  Like something you might see on the Hallmark channel.  The actors were captivating, the premise was intriguing and I wanted to see what would happen.  Not profound or great cinema, but sincere and loaded with heart.  Recommended.",1530662400,,364,5.11864406779661

8543474,5,B009P368PO,"I loved it. I guess I'll have to read the negative, one-stars later so it doesn't ruin any thoughts I have. Maybe I'll just pray they look again and understand. It's just a movie.",1523664000,,179,4.294117647058823
8543475,4,B009P368PO,Neat Movie....Worth Watching !!!,1518998400,,32,7.25
8543476,4,B009P368PO,"What a sweet film.  I loved the romantic parallel with both Alex and Rachel dreaming of their perfect match.  Corey Sevier as Alex delivers a nice performance, hitting the romantic highs and lows and the great uncertainty.  His willingness to explore an unfamiliar dream life sparks him.  (How did he get his teeth so white?)  Jordan Ladd plays Rachel who has dreamed of Alex and then finally meets him.  Her faith in the romantic pairing was touching.  I like the technical ways that the two could zap to a different location in their dream life which served to keep the story exciting.  For me, there didn't seem to be a remarkable chemistry between the two actors, but the focus was more on the plot unraveling and wondering how it was going to work out.  Ryan Alosio as Alex's brother Ben walked an emotional tightrope of being a pain to his brother, while also showing how much he loved Alex.  Renee Dorian gave a strong offbeat character performance as the coffee shop worker who has Alex's back.  I enjoyed this independent feature very much.",1516665600,2,1049,4.6775956284153
8543477,4,B009P368PO,"Unique movie. You never knew how it was going to turn out as it was going along. It's kind of low key, deeper and softer emotions of a love story and life possibilities, but enjoyable in that way for more sensitive people who would be drawn to a movie about dream and life and death and alternate realities.",1511049600,3,307,4.310344827586207
8543478,5,B009P368PO,"Loved it.  Reminded me at first of The Glass House with Keanu and Sandra, but the plot took a different path.  Quite enjoyable film.",1508371200,,132,4.458333333333333
8543479,4,B009P368PO,"This was a tearjerker, so you must like that sort of film to watch this.  On that note, while the beginning seems very staged and less than captivating, the characters grow into their roles throughout the film.  I think the premise was interesting and unique and it delves into the question of what dreams are, and whether they can transcend time.",1508112000,,347,4.672131147540983
8543480,4,B009P368PO,"I agree with the person who said this is not an A-list movie, but still enjoyable.  I also like movies that deal with time travel and romance, so that also contributed to me enjoying the movie.",1508025600,,193,4.361111111111111
