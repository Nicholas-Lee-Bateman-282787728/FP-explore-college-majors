5689941,1,B00C3JUJJS,"A powerful secret society with supposedly far reaching ties throughout the world decides to take over an unnamed US city by assassinating its mayor..  Really?!?!?!?!?  What an absolute mess!  A completely implausible plot from beginning to end.  The story line, directing, editing, and acting were so disjointed and inane that I eventually just kept watching to see how many continuity errors I could spot and ultimately stopped counting.",1398297600,,438,5.397058823529412
5689942,2,B00C3JUJJS,"Cast was great, acting...  I'm not so sure.
Felt disjointed, and the end was too abrupt and made no sense at all.

5689943,2,B00C3JUJJS,Plot as a whole makes some sense but execution is disjointed. Like too much cutting room tape left on the floor. Don't recommend watching unless you're really bored.,1397692800,3,165,4.928571428571429

5689947,1,B00C3JUJJS,I honestly like the cast but the budget for the movie must have been about a thousand dollars.  The Boston mayor's office is a empty warehouse of a building.  The police car was a Nissan with no decals and just a light put on top for the Boston Police Dept. I'm really sorry to say this was a total waste of time and except for the stars there is really no one in the movie at all.  Makes little to no sense.,1394841600,9,408,3.951219512195122
5689948,5,B00C3JUJJS,I really enjoyed this movie. Fast paced and very exciting. Sean Patrick Flanery just gets better and better with each movie he makes. Excellent performances from all the actors in this movie with a very satisfying ending. Worth watching.,1389830400,2,237,5.102564102564102

I am going to point my finger at the director for this one.  For the most part, I liked the actors.  The lines/script just didn't make since throughout.  Someone with common sense could have been a big asset.  Without giving specifics, the actors regular said things that were supposed to make the story sound larger than, instead they made the story almost comical.  At one point, they talk about an unbelievable 800 meter kill shot that someone took, however they show someone two driveways away taking the shot.  This is well less than 100 meters.  The victim is shot with a side shot, however in the morgue later they show a forehead shot.  I correctly figured out the bad quys, less then a 1/4 of the way in.",1449187200,,857,4.542483660130719

After the Mayor of Boston is assassinated, special agents John Archer (Sean Patrick Flanery- THE BOONDOCK SAINTS 1 and 2) and Mila Driver (Kristanna Loken- TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES) are called in to get to the bottom of things. They quickly discover that a secret society of illuminati-types is up to no good, as more mayoral candidates are picked off like so many arcade targets. The main problem w/ DP is its jumpy, semi-incoherent story-line. Seemingly important events occur, only to lead nowhere, and silly subplots are introduced -""John, I am your father!""- for no apparent reason. Then the finale just sort of happens, shots are fired, the end. Flanery channels Mickey Rourke, while Loken does her best w/ her stale, straight-out-of-central-casting, female agent role.

Like others, I am left with the feeling that about as much film was left on the editing floor as was in THIS version of the movie.  I really don't care to try to find out if there is another version or not after watching this one.

*spoiler alert*  I can see what they were TRYING to reach for with the ending when Sean Patrick Flanery's character ""Archer"" is suddenly yanked from the case in the final ten minutes and Kristanna Loken's character ""solves"" that one along with the final beach scene which was innuendo about her ties to this secret dark fraternity of movers and shakers rather than just to get a shot of her in a bikini.

But, I found myself laughing and shouting at the screen, ""Seriously?  THAT was the best you could come up with?""

The true (secret) ""Dark Power"", as it were, was how on earth this movie was MADE.  Must be a secret dark fraternity at work there somewhere.  We'll call them the ""deluminati"".

Which is a shame really, since I'm somewhat of a fan of this type of plot.  But, even being predisposed to liking the type of plot or the talents of the main cast, which through no fault of their own, just wasn't enough to save this from being really, REALLY bad.",1398297600,,1439,4.337078651685394
8577096,2,B00C3JUJJS,I have not a clue what just happened at the end. I thought the main character was a police officer? Why did the movie end as if the female agent was the main character? I'm so confused.,1522454400,,185,4.027027027027027
8577097,2,B00C3JUJJS,It was a fair movie. Thought would be more exciting.,1515369600,,52,4.3

8577099,2,B00C3JUJJS,"Plot is very good. Acting  is so--so  otherwise below average, The director should  employ more bite nailing scenes  of action and pizzaz. No need for sexual activity in the elevator scenes which is totally out of context to the story, and uncalled for and irrelevant .The sex scenes at this point and time do not add to the appeal to the mystery seeking populace and also otherwise do not add seriousness to the plot. thanks",1506124800,,425,4.626666666666667

8577102,1,B00C3JUJJS,"Apparently, no one thought perhaps to consider ANY level of continuity in this movie. The last 20 minutes in particular were disjointed and made NO sense at all.",1472947200,,161,4.785714285714286
8577103,1,B00C3JUJJS,"When I saw previous reviews at 3.2 stars out of 5, I gave it a shot. Erggh. What a waste of time. It takes 45 minutes to offer you a plot that it's ""secret organization"" that is putting the plot in place and another 35 minutes to put the movie into rhythm. Then the final 10 minutes removes the main character with no explanation and makes the secondary character the main one with no clear tie in.

When Loken gets injected with a syringe and the woman says, ""It's all over,"" how is it that Loken wakes up groggy?",1470268800,,550,4.445544554455446
8577104,1,B00C3JUJJS,Truly horrible.  I can't believed I watched the whole thing.  Be sure to read the reviews on IMDB before you start.  My guess is that this was supposed to be a miniseries that got cancelled before it aired and someone kluged a few scenes from each episode and called it a movie.  Very disjointed and the plot makes no sense.  I hope Amazon didn't have to pay anyone for this turkey.,1469664000,,382,4.323943661971831
8577105,1,B00C3JUJJS,Boring. Started watching it and made it less than half way through before I decided it would be more interesting to write this review.,1468972800,,134,4.625
