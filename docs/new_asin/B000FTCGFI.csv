2584587,5,B000FTCGFI,"This is an excellent documentary highlighting George Marshall, an under-appreciated American hero. It truly brings to life the tenacious diplomat who won battles in both Europe and America, and recalls the military leader who recognized the somber legacy of war. A great film!",1359590400,,276,5.441860465116279
2584588,5,B000FTCGFI,"This biography gives an excellent portrayal of the life of George C. Marshall.  It interviews those that knew him well and gives an impression of an underappreciated American hero.  George Marshall should be remembered as one of the most important 20th Century Americans:  along with JFK, FDR, and MLK.  His integrity and service to the nation were just phenomenal.  This video is well worth the 1 1/2 hours.  I highly recommend it.",1345420800,14,432,4.930555555555555

2584614,5,B000FTCGFI,"Written by Geoffrey Ward - the author of every Ken Burns' documentary series of note - and narrated by E.G. Marshall, this extraordinary film accomplishes something nearly impossible: it does justice to the most indispensable soldier and statesman in American history.

The direction, pacing and editing are pitch perfect. Naturally you can point to omissions and vagaries here and there because it simply is not possible to cover this man's life in 90 minutes or many times 90 minutes. The Marshall Plan alone deserves that. It is, without question, the most inspired foreign policy program America has delivered.

Just imagine serving a Democratic president with both Houses of Congress under Republican control and convincing them to pass a major foreign aid package aimed at rebuilding the economies of nations that were recently our enemies. Such was George Marshall's credibility and moral authority. And after centuries of conflict, Western Europe has not come close to war since.

The actual date of release of this documentary is 1991. This is fortunate as all the people interviewed are no longer with us. The bad bit is that the video quality is not what we're used to now. Neither is the sound, which loses synch during the last 10 minutes or so if you're streaming it.",1436572800,2,1281,5.033018867924528
2584615,4,B000FTCGFI,"I learned a lot about a man that had much to do with our winning of WWII.

His deference to Eisenhower to lead the Normandy Invasion that he wanted to lead is an example.  Roosevelt felt he was needed more in Washington.

The documentary is greatly enhanced by the inclusion of personal recordings made by Marshall in preparation of his biography, A surprising number of those who personally knew and worked with general Marshall were also tracked down to be interviewed. The biography covers all aspects of Marshall's life, from early childhood, to his military service, to his later work as secretary of state and Nobel Peace Prize recipient.

I know that there are those who fit that definition in private life, but our opportunities for public service have become seriously distorted by the pursuit of money needed to remain in public life and the powerful influence of well-funded and well-organized advocacy groups representing limited interests. Marshall was a man of character and of strife for the best possible result in the biggest possible frame of reference. So many today seem so much smaller.",1408579200,,630,5.31

I am now an American Citizen living the dream life in California. The sad fact of the 21st Century America is, however, that few American youngsters are aware of George Marshal's example of courage, civic duty, and inspiration for the rest of humanity.

Even sadder is that American leaders in the 21st century rarely display any of Marshal's qualities so needed at this time.",1406419200,2,609,4.735849056603773
2584788,4,B000FTCGFI,"A simple biography that is filled with so much of what this great American contributed to history. This is a well presented and narrated documentary that offers the essence of George C. Marshall. Interviews and original footage give a glimpse into all that he accomplished. Remember the timeline when this documentary was written and produced . . . it isn't PBS or HBO and perhaps it deserves more recognition and credit than is given. Definitely recommended for those who do not know who George Marshall was or what he accomplished. Students of military history will find the original footage of interest.

This offers an accurate portrayal of events during this timeline and an interesting look at George C. Marshall's varied talents. Easy to follow for beginners . . . well done!

2584859,5,B000FTCGFI,"I've been a long time history buff. George Marshall is one of the unsung TRULY great Americans in the entire history of the country. In considering the totality of his contributions, and recognizing his incredible impact on a period which was, in so many way's, the great turning point of modern history, I rank the man in the company of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.

Many have never even heard of George Marshall and this, I think, elevates the man even beyond his enormous contributions to the world. George Washington idolized the Roman emperor Cincinatus, famed for accepting the call to become Emperor of Rome, saving Rome and then, when he had absolute power, giving it up and returning to his farm (Harry Truman was a great admirer too). Marshall gave this much and even more, never seeking the spotlight and always acting with absolute integrity.

Imagine, having literally created the greatest army on earth to defeat fascism throughout the world, proposing the Marshall plan and actually getting it passed and implemented (saved Europe and, in doing so, in great degree, saved the world from the absolute horror that communism ultimately demonstrated itself to be). Afterwards being attacked by Joseph McCarthy for, of all things, being cozy towards communism, but having the dignity to not even respond. Then to have the man that he helped to greatness, Dwight Eisenhower, fail to rise to his defense when McCarthy attacked him and, still, retain his dignity and give no spiteful comments in reply....to speak truth to power, repeatedly, forcefully but always respectfully. To act, not just talk, but to never act in a self serving manner. A truly amazing and inspiring human being.

We so rarely get to see examples of TRUE greatness today. Outside of the somewhat cheesy theme music, this is a very good, fairly detailed and enjoyable documentary that gives a good glimpse of what real human nobility looks like. It includes excerpts of Marshall himself recorded in his interviews with Forrest Pogue for his biography as well as documentary footage of Marshall speaking before several congressional committees (I found these fascinating in that it gives you a sense of what the real man was like). Marshall was one of the most respected men of his time and for good reason!

If you're a history buff and inspired by examples of human dignity and greatness then you'll enjoy this documentary. God bless George Marshall and please be kind enough to send us another one :)",1382918400,5,2492,4.983173076923077

Truly one of the important Americans in our history, and unfortunately so humble that he is not recognized as he should be.
