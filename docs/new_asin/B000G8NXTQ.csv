I was so disappointed, I am having trouble buying any foreign films online, for fear of wasting more money.  What is the sense in watching a film if you can't understand what is going on?  I wish that it had been clearly labeled.",1243814400,6,304,4.298245614035087
8129553,2,B000G8NXTQ,"Image really dropped the ball here. Although clearly aimed at the Spanish-language market, other similar DVDs include English subtitles for the benefit of us gringos who are Mexican horror fans. This DVD is in Spanish only, so if you don't know the language, you may wish to avoid this one...on the other hand, it is a rare title that many fans have heard about for years, but never got a chance to see, which is why I took the chance and bought it...in any case, be forewarned.",1159574400,8,478,4.505747126436781
