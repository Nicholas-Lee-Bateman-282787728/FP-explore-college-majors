The CBS special captures the Celine we know and love, performing many songs from ""A New Day Has Come"" while mixing in some fan favorites (""Beauty and the Beast"" feat. Brian McKnight!)as well. She sang a movie medley of ""Because you loved me"", ""My Heart Will Go On"", and ""Beauty and the Beast"", and a few covers- ""At Last"" and ""Nature Boy"". Celine ended the special with a beautiful version of ""Nature Boy""- which included photos of Rene-Charles, Celine and Rene together as a family. I was lucky enough to attend the taping of her CBS special, and I can't wait to see Celine on DVD... She's back and better than ever!",1017014400,25,659,4.409836065573771
1623836,5,B00005M2BX,"Though they are all well-known songs, Celine Dion never stops amazing me every time she sings those songs regardless of the fact that she has sung them many times before. It's simply PERFECT. Only DIVAS could do that.",1012521600,3,217,4.7368421052631575
1623837,5,B00005M2BX,Celine's TV specials were moments in TV history. Any time Celine takes the stage everybody has to stop and listen. She's the master at what she does and nobody on this Earth can do any better.,1012003200,4,192,4.361111111111111

7944723,5,B00005M2BX,"Wouldn't it be nice if this was a collection of all her cbs specials??  It most definatly doesn't sound like the A New Day special...speaking of a new day, they promised a release of the show with a bonus dvd entitled a day in the life of celine, it said so on the one year one heart dvd, it was supposed to be released fall 2004..obviously it wasn't.",1125964800,2,351,4.161764705882353

7944725,4,B00005M2BX,"The CBS special for A NEW DAY was from Radio City Music

Hall and featured as guests Nsync. I believe this is the one.

In the audience you can see actresses Jane Seymour and Sophie Marceau on two closeups.

I taped that one on TV but accidentally erased over it.",1098489600,,263,4.22
7944726,5,B00005M2BX,"To my knowledge this dvd won't be from her show in Las Vegas but indeed the one at the Kodak Theater. I just quit working for Sony Music and have talked about it with a colleague of mine. They have not decided yet if it will be released at all. So 2010 written by amazon is not right. It won't take them about 7 years to decide.
If it will be produced then I can garanty it is worth buying it 'cause I saw it on TV.",1077321600,7,415,3.781609195402299
7944727,5,B00005M2BX,"To my understanding and I can almost assure you that this will be the DVD of her Las Vegas smash show/concert ""A new day..."" I was lucky enough to have attended the show the night it was taped (November 6th 2003). The presenter of the show announced that night to the audience that the show was going to be taped and that it would be released on  M A R C H  2 0 0 4  (I am guessing 03/23 or 03/30 since DVDs are usually released on tuesdays) to celebrate the 1st Anniversary of the show.
BUT THEN AGAIN! Sony Music/Epic Records/CBS music (which are all basically the same corporation) promised that they would be re-releasing Celine's ""Live a Paris"" and ""Live in Memphis"" concerts but this time on DVD, so that might be it.
OR! It might just be the DVD of her special from Kodak Theatre (which I highly doubt), or the staff from amazon.com might have entered this on the list incorrectly. Who knows?",1075248000,5,899,4.339285714285714
7944728,5,B00005M2BX,"This CBS Special is not the one performed at Kodak Centre, this is from her Las Vegas Show and that makes it even better!!!",1065916800,5,123,4.166666666666667
7944729,5,B00005M2BX,"Whatever the reason is for the long-awaited release date, it is worth the wait.
I was at this performance at the Kodak Theatre (2nd row) and it was awesome! Celine puts so much emotion into her music. It's powerful and moving.
Special guest artist include Brian McKnight and Destiny's Child (Beyonce, Kelly and Michelle). Celine performs most of the songs from her A New Day album, as well as a medley with some of her classic songs.
I'm sure this DVD will be as good if not better than the ones already out.",1063670400,6,508,4.473118279569892
7944730,5,B00005M2BX,"Don't be fooled people, this video has had a ""release date to be announced"" tagged on it for over 6 months now, so this is the one performed with CBS more than 2 years ago.  However, this video will be worth the price if/when it is finally released.",1018224000,7,249,4.1875
