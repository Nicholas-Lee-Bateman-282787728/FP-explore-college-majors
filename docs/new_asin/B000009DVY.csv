8588876,4,B000009DVY,"MAYBE YOU CAN REMBER HIS MASTERPIECE 'FIVE FINGERS OF DEATH'. CHANG HO CHENG=JENG CHEONG WOH=CHUNG CHANG HWA !!
KOREA FAMOUS DIRECTOR 'KWON TAEK IM'(2000,FILM TITLE: CHUNHYANG)ALSO START HIS FILM'S LIFE AS HIS ASSIST DIRECTOR. (CAN YOU REMEMBER, JOHN WOO WAS ALSO ASSIST DIRECTOR OF CHANG CHEH.)
THIS FILM IS ALIKE TO BRUCE LEE'S 'FURY OF FIST'. BUT I THINK, THIS FILM IS BEETER THAN IT. WE CAN AGONY EMISSION OF SUBSCIOUSNESS ( SEX & VIOLENCE) THROUGH THIS FILM.
THE STORY HAVE REASONS OF THAT. WHY SHOULD BE IT EMITTED?
IN MY OPNION, HE HAD RENDERED GREAT SERVICES TO HK MOVIES WITH MANY MOVIES.(HE HAD TRANSFERED HIS MAKING MOVIES FROM SHOW BROTHERS TO GOLEDEN HARVEST.)
 I HOPE TO SEE MANY REVIEWS ON THIS MOVIE.
THANKS
