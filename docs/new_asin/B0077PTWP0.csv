8512066,5,B0077PTWP0,"Scheherazade, Tell Me a Story is an essential film for anyone who wishes to truly understand the complexity of the women's rights issues in the Middle-East. Nasrallah's depiction of pre-revolution Egypt is unsparing in its criticism of the authoritarian government forces, but loving in its celebration of the Egyptian people as a whole. This is the story of a brave women who strives to empower her fellow countrywomen by telling their searing stories to the country at large. The viewer can't help but be swept up into the swift pace of the story and find themselves cheering for Hebba and the women she advocates.

A top-notch film that should become a modern Egyptian classic because of its potent social criticism and its remarkable style. Mona Zaki gives a stirring performance as Hebba, a woman determined to transcend the tyranny of her biologically-inferior social status.",1337558400,,881,5.118055555555555
