4165945,5,B003Q7B7A6,"She-Ra as well as He-Man are cartoons from the 80's era that are fun to watch. Every episode has a moral story and the animation still holds well to this day. Fans of the show as well as newbies can pick up this series and will have no problem following it. Thumbs up! for She-Ra, Princess of Power!",1323302400,8,299,4.172413793103448
4165946,5,B003Q7B7A6,The DVD set arrived in perfect condition and when it was scheduled to arrive. The DVD is the complete series and we have had no problems with the DVDs themselves. The episodes are fun to watch and share with my daughter. I remember watching He-Man and She-Ra as a child. This is a good collector's set.,1319328000,10,302,4.410714285714286
4165947,5,B003Q7B7A6,"The complete series does indeed contain the entire series. I expected the package to be more like the He-Man serias where the discs were inside a box. This comes packaged more like a book. Once you open the plastic, it kind of flops around open. I would have liked some kind of sleave to put around the discs - like the He-Man series.",1308960000,5,334,4.317460317460317
4165948,5,B003Q7B7A6,I have always loved He-Man and She-Ra growing up. They were good cartoons which always seemed to bring out the good. I very much enjoy watching them now.,1303862400,3,153,4.5
4165949,5,B003Q7B7A6,"My 4 yr old has a major love for this show.  when I found out that it was sold as a complete series I got it, against my husband better judgment based on the reviews.  I am glad to say I did.  bonus, she got stickers and she cant wait to make shirts with her iron ons.  the quality is good, based on the fact that this is a 1980's show.  I am absolutely happy with it.",1299542400,32,368,3.727272727272727
4165950,5,B003Q7B7A6,"The new complete dvd release of She-Ra is a great gift with the collection of the entire She-Ra series!

However, the design of this set is a little disappointing.

I already own the""Best of She-Ra"" dvd set and that was gorgeously produced with embossed cover,included bonus artwork cards and has alternate dvd covers for each discs that are wonderful. The ""Best of She-Ra "" also has great bonus material of interviews that are excellent!

This is why the new complete She-Ra dvd is kind of disappointing. The artwork of the cover box is okay, but not as colorful or embossed like the ""Best of She-Ra. The back of the box is boring and has a ""notebook"" styling which is not all that appealing.

The set does include some stickers that I do like, but too bad they aren't puffy stickers or glittery hologram 80s style foil stickers!

There was a rumor the new complete dvd release of She-Ra would include a mini comic. However, the so called ""mini comic"" I am guessing is just the included booklet of the episode guide titles that again is done in the cheesy ""notebook"" style. Not at all a little mini comic book that I and many other fans were hoping for and expecting.

There is an Iron on for tee shirts included but the iron on is very little and is okay but very basic and really nothing that special.

Also, all the discs have the exact same cd cover so they all look alike. Again boring when compared to so many great cartoon dvd releases that went the extra mile and bothered to have unique dvd covers on each disc.

Finally, when you play the discs, there isn't even a looping soundtrack while you are on menu and there are no extra features, no interviews, no artwork nothing extra. So sad.

I'm really happy to finally have all the She-Ra cartoon episodes but the makers of this set are delivering I feel a disappointing product. Considering the expensive cost of the dvd set I would have much preferred if they had skipped these cheap extras of so called mini comic,iron on and stickers and done a better dvd set. Ultimately I love this set though just because it is truly the entire series of She-Ra!",1298937600,22,2111,4.490861618798956
4165951,5,B003Q7B7A6,"She-ra is a cartoon that was popular in the 1980's and is a spin-off of He-Man.  It is about Princess Adora (He-Man's twin sister) who lives in Etheria, a planet under the rule of the Evil Horde.  The Evil Horde is tyrannical and rebel forces fight to overthrow the oppressive rulers.  Princess Adora transforms into She-ra when she holds up her magical sword and as She-ra, she gains extra human strength.  She-ra uses her powers to fight alongside the rebellion against the Horde and to protect the Etherians.

This collection of the entire series comes with 10 DVD's, an iron on She-Ra for t-shirts, and a sheet of stickers.  There are no bonus or special features, but given the price I would say this collection is well worth it if you don't already own previously released She-ra DVD's.  The image quality of these DVD's is pretty good considering the age of this series.  I give this product 5 out 5 stars because even though it doesn't have special features, its all about the show and this is one awesome show!",1297468800,44,1019,4.622222222222222
4165952,2,B003Q7B7A6,"For newcomers, these shows have been previously released by BCI/Eclipse only a few years ago; the company went bankrupt and Mills Creek acquired the rights. MC is known for so-called ""bare-bones"" releases with just the episodes. If you can find the BCI versions, they are loaded with interviews, in-episode commentaries, scripts on pdf, concept art photo galleries, physical art cards, etc., and the spines of the individual releases form a very cool mural of all the worlds from MOTU.

I had looked into whether these new releases would include something new for the fans that already purchased the BCI versions, only to find that the extras on those would not be ported over. Also keep in mind that these are likely not remastered in any way, if you are looking into a possible upgrade in viewing quality.

My rating reflects the lack of any bonus material; releasing just the episodes themselves (especially when they have already been available for some time) cannot be considered acceptable: gone are the days of buying dvd/BR product where ""interactive menus"" were promoted as some kind of special ""bonus.""",1295913600,41,1112,5.038043478260869
4165953,5,B003Q7B7A6,"After years of waiting for this beloved series to debut on video, the world will finally be a better place! She-ra, next to He-man is the greatest animated series ever to grace the boobtube. I remember rushing home from school to plop right down in front of my 13"" T.V. to catch episodes of She-Ra: Princess of Power 5 days a week from the mid to late eighties. This toon brought me more than casual fun; She-Ra & He-Man single handedly shaped and morphed my entire imagination til this very moment and possibly beyond. May you too find this series as awesome and engrossing as I did all those years ago!",1294876800,38,604,4.45045045045045

4165989,4,B003Q7B7A6,"Awesome 80s cartoon that had good storylines and decent animation for the time period.  The fact that He-Man and the Evil Horde are in this is sweet. The Evil Horde was not in the Masters of the Universe cartoon but was part of that toy line.  However, I am giving this item 4 stars because the DVD set I received was missing some inserts (a collectible sticker sheet and iron on logo).  This makes me believe that this product is actually refurbished/used.  Also, the product I received is not what is pictured on the first posting for the complete series.

I had bought a couple of seasons separately a few years ago and the bloody disks keep going out on me.  I've had to throw away 3 or 4.  I have to watch all that pirating junk at the beginning of every dvd I buy, but where are these people every time my dvd's stop working?  I've NEVER been given a refund or swap out.  Hopefully these will keep working through the future.  The animation is incredible compared to current cartoons.  Much better morals, and no junk talking or crass negativity from characters/kids on the show.  Good stuff from a moma's point of view.",1394496000,4,650,4.358333333333333

The video and audio quality in the episodes is great, looking and sounding great in big screens (Word of advice, keep the sound low in Catra heavy episodes ;) ).

Where the box set shines is in the little extras and product design. The box set is colored yellow, orange, red and purple, evoking the Crystal Castle. Each DVD is similarly color coded.
