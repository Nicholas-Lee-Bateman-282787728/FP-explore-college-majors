1392721,5,B0000541TN,"Three great Chan flicks that never made a US theatrical release, which means they lack Jackie Chan doing his own dubbing, which is prob the only thing thats not so grand, except for WHO AM I?, which was released on HBO and does include Chan's own voice.
WHO AM I? - Chan goes for a little bit of drama, though I found the Tribe stuff in the beginning a bit weird, this movie has some great scenes, including chan's run through the city in Swedish wooden shoes, a tight car chase, Jackie sliding down a HUGE building, and an awesome roof top fight against two martial artists that certainly Give chan the fight of his life.
Gorgeous- Jackie's Romantic movie, I found alot of the romance to be a bit cheesy, and the main girl is pretty much a bubble head and her motivations for leaving home seem really odd. Jackie is great as the lonely millionaire who has digital fish (heehe) and has only two fight scenes (no stunts) with this really cool australian guy, definetly worth a watch, but not Jackies best in terms of what his fans are use too.
Miracles- I dunno if this DVD comes with the original language cut or not, so I'll stick to the film. This movie was heart warming, chan is so charming as the out of place Mob boss who wants to do something nice for this woman who wants to impress her daughter. It has some great action scenes, including one at the end in a string factory (whats with jackie and factories? lol)
All three are worth getting if you're a Chan fan, a great collection, at a great price.",983145600,7,1509,4.3546099290780145
1392732,4,B0000541TN,"I am a huge Jackie Chan fan and have been ever since I was seven years old. 3 of the first 6 Jackie Chan movies that I ever saw were on this collection. First ones I saw were Who am I?, Rumble in the Bronx, and Rush Hour. Then, I saw 3 of the films on this set:The Young Tiger, Eagje Shadow Fist, and Fantasy Mission Force. I loved all three of these films as a child and Young Tiger and Fantasy Mission are still awesome. Eagle Shadow Fist, while not great now is still quite enjoyable. Due to the varying genres of the ones I saw early on, I was never under the mindset of Jackie always needing to act a certain way in his film. Whether it was Jackie as a fantastic villain in Young Tiger, a joking resistance fighter who dies in Eagle Shadow Fist, or a true underdog hero in Fantasy Mission Force, they were all thoroughly enjoyed and accepted by me. Young Tiger is a five star masterpiece and one of the greatest films ever. I had all 3 films on vhs as a kid and wore them out. This is a great set but avoid Fire Dragon.",1470096000,,1024,4.0492610837438425

1392737,1,B0000541TN,"Not worth buying, try to hunt down the original HK cuts of the movies that are available on Amazon. Though Weinstein tries to make them unavailable and hard to find.

Armour of God 2: Operation Condor is cut about 15 minutes
Armour of God is cut about 6 minutes
Project A 2 is cut 2  minutes
Twin Dragons about 10 minutes of cuts
Accidental Spy is cut over 20 minutes!
Dragon Lord is cut a few minutes. Not in scope aspect ratio.
Project A has a crappy title card pasted on it and no outtakes, but shockingly it's the uncut version on my DVD.

All the movies are English Dubbed, the original language to all of them is Cantonese.
Jackie Chan's the only one doing the great dubbing and he doesn't even dub himself for three movies in the set.",1453161600,,741,4.2785714285714285

Like before.  I didn't want to believe another review and had to see for myself.  Yet, I was proven wrong.  Hardly any Jackie Chan and a waste of my time and money.

You also should know that I am not a fan of action comedies because I like straight action. But when you can get 8 films at this price, it is hard to go wrong. The acrobatic fighting style of Jackie Chan will always entertain you. Then there is the fact you will find at least one scene funny in each film even if you are not a fan. The stunts done by Jackie Chan are done by no other and that is worth the price. Another plus about Jackie Chan's movies is that they are good for the whole family.",1408752000,,636,3.9765625

In these movies, he copied ideas from Western movies in adventure and treasure hunting.

So, a whole family may find hours of enjoyment.  Yes, Jackie Chan is both a producer and actor.  His martial arts
movement seems kind of real.",1407196800,,339,4.775862068965517
1392753,1,B0000541TN,"I don't have any issues with the concept of 8 movie collections, but it has to be executed in a way to where there is SOME quality to the movies.  8 movies on 2 DVDs.  The 2 DVDs are this:

1 two-sided, single layer per side disk.
1 one-side double layer disk.

Yes, the rough math means you have 16GB for 8 movies, which means an average of about 2 GB per movie, which is only half the amount of data space for the old DVD5 movies, and about 1/3 to 1/4 the space for DVDs that have been made since double layer disks have been around, which is a long time.

The end result is that the image quality on these are poor, unless you want to watch them on a 32"" or smaller TV, and by that I mean 32"" widescreen TV, which is not very big.

So if that's what you got to watch these movies, then you will be fine, but if you have a modern widescreen TV that is 42"" or more, these don't look good.",1406160000,,889,3.883977900552486

First of all, they're actual Jackie Chan films, not those ones where a horrible double has his back to the camera for most of the film.  Second, these are good movies from the era after Drunken Master, not the movies from before '78 or so, where nobody seemed to get Chan as a lead actor of his own style.  And third, these are good transfers that are lovely to watch, not those other ones that you suffer through because, hey, it's what happens when you love Eastern film making.

I can't recommend this collection enough, the best one of these I've seen in a long time.",1332201600,8,463,4.658536585365853
1392819,5,B0000541TN,"When I first stumbled upon this 8 film collection of Jackie Chan, I thought I was imagining it. This collection showcases some of Jackie's best films, and the price of the collection is so cheap that it seemed like a ripoff! So, with hesitation, I clicked add to cart. Within only two days, my package arrived, and I slowly unwrapped the gem inside.

It's real! I quickly popped in the first movie disc, and I sat captivated. The quality is very nice, especially for a collection like this. The discs are English dubbed, as all Jackie Chan movies should be watched. All 8 movies were as they appeared in the description. I couldn't be more satisfied. Now, I have hours and hours of Jackie Chan awesomeness to enjoy.

This collection is for real! It's a great deal, and anyone that wants to watch more Jackie Chan movies, these are some of his best. Jackie pulls some of his greatest stunts in these, and as always, he's badass in the fight scenes. As one of the first owners of this new collection, I would definitely recommend it.

Buy this collection if you love JACKIE.",1332115200,18,1072,4.544041450777202
1392820,3,B0000541TN,"I bought it at Wall-mart for $5. The main reason I wanted it was for the action, but it did not have that much action in it. If you like old humor then it's actually pretty good. In my opinion it is worth about $5-$10.",1331164800,,218,3.8666666666666667
1392821,1,B0000541TN,If you can understand Chinese then this tape would be good for you.  There is no way to change the language to English also Jackie Chan plays a villian with a big black mole on his face in one of the feature films and I couldn't accept that concept of him at all.,1320624000,,263,3.9622641509433962
1392822,1,B0000541TN,"The movies on this DVD are horrendous even for their time.  These are among the worst movies ever made in all of human history.  The video quality is remeniscent of 1970s TV commercials shown in third world countries.  The translation and acting is so bad it makes me want to stand in a bucket of water as I touch live, frayed, electrical wires to myself watching ""Lord of the Dance"" starring Michael Flately.  I hope one day all of the original films are found and destroyed.  Absolutely horrible!",1318204800,,498,4.613636363636363
1392823,1,B0000541TN,"All 4 of the films in this pack are filmed in horrible quality, have tons of filler, Jackie Chan is not the main star of them and is hardly in any of them, the camerawork is horrible and the action scenes are few and far between. Skip this film pack, its not worth buying. 1.5/10",1302739200,3,279,4.090909090909091
1392824,1,B0000541TN,"I am a diehard JAckie Chan fan; I love his modern movies.  This package is a complete rip off.  He is barely in any of them!  They have even added ""Starring Jackie Chan"" at the beginning of one, and he is only in it a little while!  There is endless stabbing and killing of women, and a scene of water-boarding.  I am going to throw these DVDs away, and complain to my local grocery store where I bought them!",1302566400,,409,4.1265822784810124
1392825,5,B0000541TN,"Most people watching this probably won't recognize Jackie at all because he looks so young! It's interesting to see how Jackie puts a little more substance into his film productions, which greatly helped the martial arts film to evolve into what they are today.",1280880000,,261,4.954545454545454
1392826,2,B0000541TN,"...well, here you go. I spent $7 on this at Fry's and I'm glad I didn't spend more. Chan, like most actors, worked his way up, and these movies show some of the journey. They are not lost gems... they're just not even really great films. I even have been unable to find one of them in his credits at the IMDB. But he's in them... somewhere. For the amount I paid, it isn't so bad. But I should have had better sense. I was expecting them to be lesser quality, but somehow I didn't expect him to barely be in them. I thought that was rather sneaky... and it was... but I admit, on inspection, the box never says anything more than that it has 4 feature length films and Jackie Chan is in them. Well, okay, then.",1280534400,16,710,4.115107913669065
1392827,2,B0000541TN,"Jackie Chan has a maybe 12 minutes of screen time in the first two films! They have been edited and the sides of every shot are cut off. Sometimes someone will be talking and you can only see half of their face or nothing at all! Jackie Chan is fantastic, but these are not really films for Jackie Chan lovers. Maybe vintage karate movie lovers, but not Jackie Chan enthusiasts.",1221609600,,378,4.414285714285715

The music was totally changed along with some scenes being cut out which really sucked. However, most of these are not really available here for good prices and easily accessible. This is a pretty good collection and I would recommend it.",1515888000,,385,4.676470588235294

Finally got my girlfriend to watch her first Jackie Chan movie-Operation Condor(aka Armour of God 2) with me because of this DVD collection.",1471478400,,439,4.84
