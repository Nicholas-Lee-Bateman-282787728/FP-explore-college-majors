It does give a balance between US Labor, Canadian Labor, and the needs of companies who do the forest harvesting and the landowners.  Good reading/watching for people in today's Forest Products Industries.

The same struggles still exist.  Competition results in people coming to Maine from Canada, to work.  Maybe Canadians and other from outside Maine are more flexible?  I do not know, but the issues still persist.  What might be different is that there are a number of Canadian owners of forest product industries in Maine.  Some of them are well managed and doing well.  All companies operating in Maine  have financial pressure due to dropping of demand for forest products.  Low cost producers can still survive.

Summarizing: This video helps people understand the forces at work in the 1970's and 1980's.  Many of these forces are at work today.  Enjoyable, good for teaching.",1271548800,,972,4.956521739130435
