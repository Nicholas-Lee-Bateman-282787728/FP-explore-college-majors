5974356,1,B00FBQ3GA4,Disappointed! I thought it was some kind of sitcom.  Just several people - unknowns being interviewed.  Not what I was expecting - 2 thumbs down.,1388448000,,145,4.76
5974357,5,B00FBQ3GA4,"Featuring members of the cast and production team of various television series, in a panel discussion that also includes with some questions from the audience, the Live at the Paleyfest series, is typically a lively, entertaining, and informative watch.  The show does a good job of providing some insight into the current events and backstories, concerning the various programs, and their cast members.

Recorded on March 14, 2013 this 62 minute Q and A features series co-creator Michael Patrick King (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sex-and-the-City/dp/B003Z8ZCG6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sex and the City</a>), and the entire principal cast, with Kat Dennings (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nick-and-Nora-Infinite-Playlist/dp/B001MM3AZC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nick and Nora Infinite Playlist</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Daydream-Nation/dp/B004OUZLC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Daydream Nation</a>), Beth Behrs, Mathew Moy, Jonathan Kite, Garrett Morris (The original SNL), and Jennifer Coolidge (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-ExTerminators/dp/B0040BJH3G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The ExTerminators</a>).  The discussion is moderated by Christina McLarty, who while not always posing the greatest questions, does let the panel do most of the talking.

Michael Patrick King reveals much about the production aspects of the show.  Routinely featuring trashy dialog, King and the writers of Two Broke Girls, are pushing the limits of network TV, a trend that has only increased as the show has progressed into its third season.  Doing what he characterizes as ""high low brow"" humor, King says the writers often draw from their experiences of ""being poor"" for inspiration.

King characterizes Dennings and Behrs as ""unicorns"", rare creatures perfectly cast for their roles.  Dennings and Behrs speak freely, but don't dominate the discussion.  A child actor who was ""home schooled and lived in the woods"", Dennings previously worked with King on Sex in the City.  Behrs seems as bubbly and light as her character Caroline, particularly when recounting her experiences with Chestnut the horse.

The discussion provides an opportunity to get to know a bit about the supporting cast.  Jonathan Kite is an intelligent and a very naturally funny guy.  A bespectacled Matthew Moy speaks with no exaggerated accent, and says that he is even weirder than his character Han.  Jennifer Coolidge reveals her inspiration for her character Sophie, while the ultra-cool and laid back Garrett Morris, admits that while he has been clean of heroin for seven years, he is not drug free.

With some interesting stories, laughs, and solid information, this edition of Live at Paleyfest is highly recommended to fans of Two Broke Girls.  Don't miss it while it is available on Prime.  Co-creator Whitney Cummings was apparently also present at the event, but unfortunately does not make an appearance.",1387929600,2,3055,6.358353510895884
