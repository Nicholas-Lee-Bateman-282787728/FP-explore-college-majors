8455878,5,B0053XZ9F0,"This DVD is a must have for any early learner.  My toddler son enjoys this DVD a lot.  It is set to classical music and a soothing woman's voice as the narrator.  Some of the great things about this DVD include colors, counting, and common words/phrases that little ones are just beginning to identify and learn.  Really educational.  Also, the vocabulary review content is a nice bonus.  Overall, a very engaging DVD for my 19 month old son.  My son has since added more words to his vocabulary from viewing this particular DVD.",1355184000,,529,4.623655913978495
