8338405,5,B001RP9760,"The whole point of watching movies like this is because they make you think in a deep artsy, ok im not sure i understood all that kinda way. if you liked donnie darko, its the same kinda thing in a new direction. if you hated it, you might hate this too. the ending on the first made a little more sense if the idea was that it never really happened, but that kind of cheats your out of the experience. i kind of hope they make a part three although some people are already rolling their eyes as it is.",1265846400,2,502,4.03
