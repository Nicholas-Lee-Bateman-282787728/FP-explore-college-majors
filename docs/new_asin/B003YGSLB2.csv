4229307,2,B003YGSLB2,"My daughter is 2 yrs. old and doesn't like to watch it. This is my first Einstein video. I will not buy another. Friends have told me that they are great, but I just watched it myself and it is not fun. I recommend leapfrog dvd's.",1296086400,5,230,4.021739130434782
4229308,1,B003YGSLB2,"Animals around me is the same DVD, roughly, as ""World Animals"" and ""Baby McDonald"" DVD's put together. If you have those, don't get this. I mean- SERIOUSLY- they didn't even try to make it different with the exception of a few new inserts to assist in the transitions between exerpts from the two older DVDs.  Booooooooo! We received this as a gift because my mother knew how much my girls loved Baby Einstein and she was led to believe that this, along with ""World of Colors"" (aka Baby Van Gogh"" and ""World of Words"" (with repurposed material from older DVDs as well), was a new series of DVDs.  I feel like I was just extorted. Will not purchase any more Baby Einstein DVDs.",1294272000,16,676,4.487804878048781

4229315,2,B003YGSLB2,"Such an expensive video. I know a lot of kids who like Baby Einstein, but I guess my son wasn't one of them. I too didn't find it interesting. Son (and I) prefers the Baby Babble videos.",1390608000,,186,4.054054054054054

4229319,4,B003YGSLB2,"My son has been slow to start speaking, but once we started watching this, he felt more confident trying to speak the words.
He has taken off talking ever since, and he picks this movie out of any other baby einsteins we have.
Even my 10mo. old enjoys watching it.",1372636800,,264,4.3

4229321,5,B003YGSLB2,"My little 6 month old wasn't giving this one her pure thumbs up at first. It earned her raspberry rating initially, but she began to really enjoy the little vignettes (marked by the ""camera""/picture-taking sequence). She now smiles with grand joy at her favorite ""characters"" (dragon, piggy, butterfly, etc) as they ""perform"". She seems to absolutely adore the lady announcer-- Julie Clark's-- introductory ""welcome"" in all the Einstein videos. She gives Ms Clark the smile that she reserves for beloved family.",1369699200,,511,5.320987654320987

4229323,3,B003YGSLB2,"My little guy loves it and it keeps him occupied for 20 mins or so.  (He does not watch that much TV) It is quite a simple/rudimentary video but you have to remember its for babies/toddlers.  I would say its suitable for children under 2.  Obviously anyone can watch it and not be offended but the littlest kids will find it surprisingly entertaining.

Should be priced about $10.",1359590400,,380,4.544117647058823
4229324,5,B003YGSLB2,Can't beat a Baby Einstein DVD to educate and teach a baby or toddler (and get them ready for a nap!) Wind-down time!,1357862400,,117,4.130434782608695
4229325,2,B003YGSLB2,"This is a variation of Baby Einstein's Shakespeare DVD.  The first few minutes started out just like it.  I haven't watched anymore because I was so disgusted I had to walk away.  But I am VERY, TRULY disappointed.  I feel ripped off...like they should have warned the buyers in the product description.",1340582400,3,303,4.769230769230769
4229326,5,B003YGSLB2,"I discovered the Baby Einstein products when I began babysitting for my 3 month old grandson. Even at that early age he was fascinated with the movies, and learned unusual and complicated words (xylophone, gyroscope for example) at a very early age. He watched these movies right up to almost 4 yrs old and really learned a lot from them. So with a new grandbaby in the family, I purchased this set to introduce her to Baby Einstein, and hope that she gets as much from it as her cousin did. I love the fact this set also comes with the music CD (which I used to have to buy separately) and the book. A great opportunity for parents and grandparents to interact with the child and the DVD movie. I highly recommend these Baby Einstein products.",1327536000,2,744,4.437956204379562
4229327,4,B003YGSLB2,I know it doesn't take much to produce these einstein videos.  I don't know why they can't just make a brand new one. Although they added a few minor scenes to world of words compared to the baby shakespeare. My 15 month old likes it so I have to give a 4. I don't like it because I got ripped off and plus most of the scenes really don't go together. They show a word and show a scene about the word and then a hodge podge of other scenes unrelated to that word.,1313452800,9,463,3.925531914893617
4229328,1,B003YGSLB2,This video is so boring! My 16 month old is totally uninterested. He likes other Baby Einstein dvds but not this one. Save your money.,1311206400,,134,4.4

Not impressed with the conditioner or shampoo either!!  I spent $200 bucks and I won't buy this product or maybe never from Amazon again!!  I purchased the shampoo last year and it was amazing..
