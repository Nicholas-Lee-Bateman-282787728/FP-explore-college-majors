A man wakes up in a mansion with everyone believing him to be the master of the house.  Apparently, the scheming wife and her boyfriend have found a perfect duplicate for her husband.  They confide in him that if he will sign for bank bonds from an old friend and they will give him some of the money.  What follows is a rather mixed bag of crooks, can artists and thieves.  Nobody is innocent here as even the banker is trying to grab an extra 100 grand.

This film is fairly interesting and should be enjoyable for old 30's movie buffs.  Some pre-code moments are here as well.

Recommended for:  Pre-code fans, mystery and suspense fans and those who collect and enjoy early 30's movies.",1259020800,2,771,4.482014388489208
