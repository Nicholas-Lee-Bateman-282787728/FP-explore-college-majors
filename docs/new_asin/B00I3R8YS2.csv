8638789,5,B00I3R8YS2,"This video and his other videos for specific cameras are very helpful, especially if your are upgrading to a more advanced camera.  I highly recommend them, for the beginner and those with more experience.  The explanations are very clear and succinct, and the video quality is very good.  These videos usually include a section at the beginning for shooting basics, which are very helpful to the beginner and more experienced, but you can skip these if you want to get right to the section on how to use the camera.  I have the video for the Nikon D610 and D750, and both are excellent.",1419292800,,587,4.615384615384615
8638790,3,B00I3R8YS2,"If you are looking for a DVD to learn the functionality of the D610, this is not the DVD to purchase. However, there is a lot of photography pointers for entry level photographer like myself where this is not a complete waste of money. So if your goal is the learn the camera this is not the best option.",1412553600,2,304,4.169491525423729
8638791,5,B00I3R8YS2,"Great product, well worth the cost. Michael does a good job bringing you up to speed on the Nikon D610 and he also gives you a basic understanding of photography that will improve the pictures that you do take.",1409702400,,210,4.410256410256411
8638792,5,B00I3R8YS2,"The section of the video covering the d610 is invaluable for understanding all the components of this impressive and complex camera and I highly recommend. The other sections of the video cover other aspects of photography and are pulled together from other videos done from the author in different times of his life,( as told by his different hairstyles). However, all are well done and he is an excellent teacher.",1397088000,,415,4.942857142857143
8638793,5,B00I3R8YS2,This video really helped me learn more about my camera and how to take much better photos. I enjoyed the different techniques Michael talks about in this DVD to help take better portrait shots. I would buy this DVD for one of my friends.,1393977600,,237,4.409090909090909
