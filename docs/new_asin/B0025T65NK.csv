8351166,5,B0025T65NK,"What a VOICE!.  Rob Rock in 2008 delivered a high octane night of kick butt speed metal.  Dubbed the Voice of Melodic Rock, Rob has dabbled in melodic rock in the past, but this night Rob focuses only on his solo efforts.  And with good reason as Rage of Creation and Garden of Chaos provide some killer songs.  The man is hot, the band is smokin and the energy is electric.  As a bonus the DVD comes with a bonus CD of entire show to create an unbelievable value.  Pick up this set before it is gone!",1502064000,,501,4.11340206185567

8351175,5,B0025T65NK,"I've seen a lot of really good concert DVD's but this one really makes you feel like you're there! The performances, the sound, the passion, the METAL comes through loud and clear! They only had an hour to play but they made the most of it. A lot of singers sound good in the studio but I think Rob Rock sings even better live! He hits some high notes in concert that I don't recall on the studio versions of the songs. Check out the high notes he nails on 'In The Night' for example. Also both guitarist ripped some killer solos! Check out the extended solo's in 'Only A Matter Of Time'. Also, it's inexpensive so buy it, you won't be dissapointed!",1250035200,,649,4.284552845528455
