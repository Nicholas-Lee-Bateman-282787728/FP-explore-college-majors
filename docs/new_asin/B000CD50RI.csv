8097779,5,B000CD50RI,"This was a replacement since the first one stopped playing. I think Adam is great, I had the opportunity to see him in 2008 when he came to NJ. His seminar was packed I had to stand until an usher found a seat for me. I did talk to him after the seminar and found him to be such a nice young man, a little on the humble side also. I use his DVD as I have various health problems and I find them helpful. I definitely believe in the power of healing yourself through positive thinking and visualization. Recommend his books, I have several, and this DVD for anyone who needs to heal themselves and don't want to go on drugs which is the norm in our society today.",1312329600,12,662,4.1

8097782,5,B000CD50RI,"This CD offers many colorfull visualiztions for a wide variety of ailments.  The visualizations are a support to those who may have trouble with visualization therapy. I liked the easy sequence of events and bright colors. These are great for those trying to help themselves, but less of aid trying to heal others. Still a great work.",1171497600,44,334,4.859649122807017
