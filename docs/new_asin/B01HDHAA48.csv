7786033,5,B01HDHAA48,"Tales of Poe has many elements of a great horror film, but it has one other thing most modern horror films don't have-atmosphere. TOP is an exceptional foray into the classic horror literature world where Edgar Allan Poe's most popular stories are reimagined for today's audience. And to top it off, Adrienne King and Amy Steel (two of the Final Girls from Friday 13th) unite in the third macabre story ""Dreams"". If you are looking for that feeling you got watching horror/thriller flicks in the 80's, look no further.",1479600000,3,518,4.831460674157303
8765119,3,B01HDHAA48,This movie was ok. Nothing Great. If your going to bring back Adrienne King & Amy Steel from Friday the 13th parts 1 & 2 at least give Adrienne King a speaking part & Give Adrienne & Amy some scenes together. This is the 2nd movie they've done together & in both movies they didn't have any scenes together. That's nuts.,1530835200,,320,4.262295081967213

8765122,4,B01HDHAA48,"Inventive, scary, shocking; sometimes campy, sometimes surreal, but always beautifully-crafted. This anthology, based on stories by Edgar Allen Poe, is a big-budget example of ""queer horror"" designed to intrigue -- and win over -- mainstream audiences.  Alan Rowe Kelly's performances as an unhappy wife and an over-the-hill movie star are riveting.  The supporting case of indie horror stars give us their all -- including their guts.  The first two shorts -- The Tell-Tale Heart and The Cask -- are linear.  The third short -- Dreams -- is based on a poem that Poe wrote when he was 18.  It is a gauzy mash-up of images that aims to take the audience on the line between dream and nightmare. My advice is to relax and half-close your eyes during this segment -- it's poetry, after all.",1491177600,,787,4.8
8765123,5,B01HDHAA48,"Brilliant movie using great actors/actresses, cinematography,  and story telling!  These updated Poe classics are sure to please even the most discerning of Poe fans!  Sure to be a classic in its own right, you won't be disappointed!",1490918400,,233,5.243243243243243
8765124,1,B01HDHAA48,"Ummmm...thankfully I had amazon prime so I didn't pay to watch this movie but it's almost two hours of my life that I will never get back and that crushes me.  I kept watching to see if it would get better,  and it didnt.  One positive:  the cinematography was very well done.  That's it.",1489017600,,288,4.2592592592592595

8765126,1,B01HDHAA48,I wanted to show parts of this film for my high school English class.  It has a lot of profanity.  It's terrible and not a good Poe partner.,1483056000,,140,3.9642857142857144

8765128,5,B01HDHAA48,"Very unique, well-acted film with some of the most beautiful, yet disturbing images - particularly in the last segment.  So glad I bought it so I can watch it again!  More from Alan Rowe Kelly!",1480550400,4,193,4.485714285714286
