3530063,5,B001DHXT66,"As A Die-hard Andy Griffith Show fan,Gomer Pyle,USMC  just completes the wonderful experience of great comedy that sort of ties in both shows...Frank Sutton is just fantastic and I feel often overlooked as one of the great character actors of his time..When you have seen these episodes as often as I have,the characters,actors and story lines really are funny. If your a great fan of Mayberry,this series really belongs with that collection. In a way its like having 13 seasons of a time period that all ties together for lots of laughs and memories....I AM alittle upset that some of these episodes have been edited and some of Jim Nabors musical numbers have been ommited. Also,I feel there should have been more commentary from Jim Nabors and maybe some of the surviving cast members. It would be great to hear about the filming of some of these episodes from the actual actors and writers....Great shame that the series ended when it did without any conclusion..Unfortunately,though the show was in the top 20 for its entire run,times were changing for television and like many light-rural comedies of the time,all were canceled to make room for more political and social commentary-like shows that would take tv into the 70s",1219449600,26,1230,4.942028985507246
3530064,5,B001DHXT66,"I just loved this show and its great to be able to finish off all 5 seasons on dvd!

There are 30 Episodes for Season 5. It really contains some great episodes: My Two favorite season 5 episodes are: Car For Sale and Come Blow Your Top!

Come Blow Your Top had it all. By the fifth season Jim Nabors and Frank Sutton had perfected their roles as Gomer and Sgt Carter respectvely. This storyline exemplified what the entire series was about. Well respected and tough as nails Sgt Carter trying his best to maintain a top notch platoon while the often clumsy but good natured Gomer seemed to always find a way to make waves and get under the Sergeants skin. This episode featured Alan Melvin as Sgt Hacker who put in one of his best performances of the series as he enlisted the help of Gomer to make Sgt Carter blow his top and win a bet at the same time.

3530081,4,B001DHXT66,This was a fun clean show from the 60's. Bumbling Mayberry resident Gomer Pyle from the Andy Griffith Show  enlists in the Marine Corps much to the misery of drill instructor Sargent Carter.  The show had it's up and downs mainly from episodes sometimes being repetitive but the interaction between actors Jim Nabors and Frank Sutten was memorable. One of the strong merits of the show was the fact many episodes had some lesson to teach about doing  the right things and being honest and about integrity which is rare in comedies today.,1424304000,,537,4.752688172043011

3530089,4,B001DHXT66,"Gomer Pyle's final season is good, but not his best.  There were surely more seasons that could have been made, but CBS was weeding out 'quality, rural family programs for more inner city, programs dealing with peace, war, racism and such.  Enjoy the end of one of the television programs that helped us get away from the real world for 30 minutes and laugh it up.  Sadly, those programs that replaced these family-friendly rural programs have done nothing but make our society worse.  BTW - The U.S Marine Corps asked the producers of Gomer Pyle not to involve Vietnam in the show and to keep it exactly like it was.  The Marine's found the 30 minutes of Gomer Pyle to be a great moral booster and it gave them a little escape from reality, too!",1390867200,,746,4.496296296296296

3530097,5,B001DHXT66,"Gomer Pyle has endured many a trial & tribulation during his nearly five-year enlistment in the Marine Corps. Gomer & Sgt. Carter have one last go-'round in this, the fifth & final season of ""Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C."". Sgt. Carter is looking to sell his car in ""Car For Sale"". Gomer immediately expresses interest, so he withdraws part of his life savings to purchase Carter's wheels. The car gives great gas mileage, so great, Sgt. Hacker (played by Allan Melvin) is also interested in buying it, rather, swindling it from Pyle. Hacker fills up the tank. To the dismay of Carter, the car gets great gas mileage! Carter begs Pyle to sell him back his car, which Pyle does. Now that Hacker knows Carter owns the car again, Hacker goes for the clincher by cyphening the gas from the car. Now Carter gets lousy gas mileage! This is one episode that can't be missed! Sgt. Carter is so stressed out as a result of Pyle's antics, that he loses his voice in ""Just Move Your Lips, Sergeant"" & Gomer meets a kind woman (played by Molly Picon) in the park in ""A Little Chicken Soup Wouldn't Hurt"" - who invites Gomer home & feeds Gomer a smorgasbord lunch. Gomer learns she enjoys giving others pleasure through her cooking, to the chagrin of her son. Gomer finds himself back on MP duty in ""Gomer The Perfect MP"", & Gomer & Sgt. Carter receive star treatment when they're invited to sit on the bench at Gomer's friend's football game in ""Two On The Bench"". Gomer contemplates getting a tattoo to impress Lou-Ann in ""A Tattoo For Gomer"", while Gomer is assigned to camouflage a van in ""Flower Power"", where a band of hippies paint a floral deign on it! Rob Reiner makes an appearance as one of the hippies. Friendly Freddy (played by Sid Melton), now has a computer dating service in the episode ""Friendly Freddy's Computer"". Sgt. Carter has visions of seeing Gomer while on vacation in ""I'm Always Chasing Gomers"" - featuring Kathleen Freeman guest-starring as Sgt. Carter's mom. The final episode is a retrospective of all five seasons in the episode ""Goodbye Camp Henderson, Hello Sergeant Carter"". To sum it all up, Gomer Pyle's tour of duty was an exciting one, & it lasted 137 episodes in five seasons. Don't go AWOL - pick up your very own copy of ""Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. - The Final Season"" ASAP!

3530098,5,B001DHXT66,My favorite line from this show!...I grew up watching this funny comedy and was very happy to get my hands on the final season and I am quite thrilled with the episodes.....Thanks amazon.,1363824000,,187,4.696969696969697

3530100,5,B001DHXT66,Nothing is more pleasant than comedies from years past.  They are so wholesome.  The laughter is never at the expense of someone's feelings.,1360454400,,140,5.043478260869565
3530101,5,B001DHXT66,"These old shows are akin to Andy Griffith reruns in their ability to show the best in human nature. Gomer is a joy to watch in these old shows and the plots are actually more well-written than many of the shows you see on TV nowadays. Heart-warming plots, kind and gentle Gomer, and a fun look at an era gone by, from the older cars to the way the women dress and wear their hair, this show is a fun time capsule. Even the opening theme song reminds me of waiting at my babysitter's house as a 5 year old in 1966; my mom would usually show up during Gomer Pyle, so when I heard the opening theme, I knew I would be going home soon. Even now when I hear the opening theme, I get this feeling like I will get to go home soon! lol! I think anyone who grew up in the 1960's will find this series especially full of sentimentality.",1357430400,,826,4.0426829268292686
3530102,5,B001DHXT66,"I was thrilled to receive Season 5 so quickly when I ordered it.  It was worth the wait!  Every episode I have watched so far is clear with great sound.  I had forgotten how funny this show actually was.  I would recommend this set to anyone who is a Gomer Pyle USMC fan, you won't be disappointed! The episode where Sgt. Carter saves Gomer's life is hilarious...you gotta see it!!!",1348876800,,382,4.414285714285715
3530103,5,B001DHXT66,"I just love it.  I am not usually a fan or cornball comedy, but I love this.  The other elements of the show make it great.  Gomer's innocence and his loud Sargent.  The interplay between the two is great.  One without the other might not be so great.  It is the two together that makes this comedy so timelessly great.  It would appeal to the people who like classic tv, comedy, and though I am very picky about what I let my 5 yearl old daughter watch, I am comfortable about letting her watch it with me and she likes it too.",1344124800,,528,4.117647058823529
3530104,3,B001DHXT66,"I ordered the full series..5 seasons. The first 3 were hilarious! But the 4th season it started to not be as funny cause they kind of ""citified"" Gomer. What made the show so funny was that this country boy was trying to live in the city environment...and staying with his country mentality and upbringing. ""you can take the boy out of the country, but you can't take the country out of the boy"" kind of thing. But the 4th season..they started taking the country out of Gomer and it just wasn't that funny. Just another city boy in the city. They also have Sgt Carter's constant yelling at Gomer get more to the violent side and so constant..I was muting it most of the time. It just got out of hand. The 5th season...they kind of flipped the mentality of Gomer and Sgt. Carter and made Gomer the ""smart"" one and Sgt Carter the ""dumb"" one (for lack of better wording). I didn't like the 5th season.",1321142400,3,897,4.377245508982036
3530105,5,B001DHXT66,"Golleee, Shazaam, this dvd is funny, funny, funny.  Good old fashioned humor.  This is a very enjoyable, but highly improbably sitcom.  Buy it and get ready to laugh.",1307145600,,166,4.857142857142857

3530127,5,B001DHXT66,"I met Jim Nabors when he was on tour in Australia in 1979 and have followed his career closely ev er since.

Because only two early c.ds. were the only ones ever available over here I have been indebted to Amazon in that I have bought all his c.ds. his two films and had purchased the first four seasons of Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C and spent many hours of enjoyment with the acting and in particular his magnificent singing voice  What a lesson in kindnesses and humility we could all learn from the role of Gomer which is indeed indicative of the life of Jim himself.  Unfortunately through illness I missed out for the fifth season when it was released and have only now been able to obtain it. Full praise must go to the script writers for a ending of the series I felt the glueing of two hands together of Gomer and Sgt. Carter a brilliant way of ensuring that a friendship would be never ending.  A wonderful series of good clean humour and loads of laughter and a series which makes us of the older generation realise just hows lucky were to live when this series was presented for our enjoyment originally,  A series to be eternally treasured.",1273622400,,1144,4.428571428571429
3530128,4,B001DHXT66,One of my fav seasons.  Both Jim Nabors and Frank Sutton are great.  The one thing I didn't really care for in this final season was casting the very talented Ronnie Shell as the Corporal.  I wish they would have included his character more in the stories.  Still an excellent purchase though!,1271203200,,293,4.576923076923077
3530129,4,B001DHXT66,"I'm very surprised how consistent this show was right until the end. It isn't my favorite show ever but some that I would place higher like All in the Family had real consistency problems with scripts. Not so with Gomer Pyle. In fact the real strength of this show is how diverse the stories are and how much variety there was overall (singing, trips, courtcases, car purchases).. it does have a few that I consider clunkers; sorry but the Larry Storch episode is just too over the top for my tastes, but overall VERY well made.

Still looking at this show for it was it had a very strong core cast, in fact IMO Sgt. Carter is the main draw, although it takes Gomers unwavering admiration for him to really show the full picture. I am just wild about Lou-Ann Poovey also.. the casting for her is just perfect because it really took a stroke of luck to pair Pyle with a suitable other half (I know she was in other seasons but I didn't review those series). I look at them as a very early forerunner of the 'Woody and Kelly' Cheers pairing -- masterful stuff; two peas in a pod as it were.

I love the artwork, the transfer, and even the little things some other shows missed - like chapter stops.. enough that as a package for what they are charging for this it simply is not to be missed. As sad as I am to know how close to the end Sutton was even while filming this it fills me with warmth to know his name will live on and on, as will that of Private 1st Class Gomer Pyle.

A very fitting end.

ps, I must add I LOVE Sgt. Carter's devilish laugh:)",1250380800,4,1551,4.194630872483222

3530131,5,B001DHXT66,"Gomer Pyle USMC is a very funny show, even though I didn't grow up watching it.  I watched a couple episodes when I was younger.  I am only 21, so it was on the air before I was born.  I got all 5 seasons now, so I am happy.",1244592000,,224,3.5306122448979593
3530132,5,B001DHXT66,"This final season of Gomer Pyle is a wonderful, clean family show for all ages. Even though this show was made in the 1960's, it's timeless. Families  today enjoy it as much as they did over 30 years ago. Jim Nabors and the late, great Frank Sutton are a hit as Gomer and Sgt. Carter. This is a testimony to the fact that comedies can be clean and wholesome and still be popular and enjoyed for generations. Highly recommended!!!!",1243123200,3,430,4.443037974683544
3530133,5,B001DHXT66,"This spinoff of the ""Andy Griffith Show"" (another classic) is a classic all to itself.  I know Jim Nabors gets most of the spotlight in portraying Gomer Pyle as well he should.  But, I want everyone to know that that show would have never been anything close to what it was without the excellent acting of Frank Sutton as Sgt. Carter.  I hope somehow that members of Mr. Sutton's family get to read this because when I was a kid watching this show on TV, I laughed so hard at his portrayal of Sgt. Carter, and still do to this day.  Now that I'm older, I can appreciate the professionalism he exemplified in his acting, wanting everything to be perfect.  Thanks.
  These two guys played characters that were 180 degrees from each other and that made the show.  I wish that it could have run for much more than the 5 seasons that it did.  As with the ""Andy Griffith Show,"" ""Gomer Pyle"" is an excellent choice to add to anyone's video library of classic comedy DVD's.",1235865600,4,965,4.406779661016949
3530134,5,B001DHXT66,"I purchased this DVD set since I really enjoy Gomer Pyle,USMC!  I now have all the DVD sets and have enjoyed viewing the various programs from time to time!  They've had me in stitches!  Somehow, the program really is humorous! I never tire of viewing these television programs which have been put on DVD's for watching the shows on a regular basis.",1235001600,,349,4.596774193548387
3530135,4,B001DHXT66,"Jim Nabours,cast as the lead in ""Gomer Pyle"",played the role he will always be most remembered for,and found a place in television history as a result. Even though he had a successful career as a recording artist also(a very fine tenor),he just could not entirely get out from under the shadow of the character he made so famous. Eventually Mr Nabours ""retired"" from show business settling in Hawaii where I believe he still runs a very successful macadamia nut plantation.
Frank Sutton who came to create his best known role in this series as Gomers'short tempered Sgt. Carter,also found himself typecast much the same as Nabours did. He went on to appear on Nabours' post Gomer television show(a clip from which appears in the season one set)and did various dinner theatre also. Unfortunately he passed away at the age of only 50 in 1974.
No one could ever see two other actors in the roles of Gomer Pyle and Sgt. Carter. Both men were perfect in them and played extremely well off of each other,as the chemistry between them is very apparent in each in every episode.
Season five of this series continues where season four left off,with lots of laughs supplied by Gomer's innane but well intentioned boners and Sgt. Carter's apoplectic reactions to each. Like the Honeymooners where Ralph would yell at Alice,deep down he loved her;so we find a similar situation in this series. For example,there is one ep here where Carter may finally get his wish to see Gomer leave. At first he is ecstatic but by the end of the ep he has sneakily changed the transfer papers and secured Gomer back in his platoon. Even though Gomer has given Carter everthing short of a stay in the local mental hospital,Carter also realises Gomer is always well intentioned and has even unexpectedly come though for him many times. With all his bravado Carter does NOT want Gomer to leave. Besides that,one gets the impression that he thinks""who else could possibly look after a ""knucklehead like Pyle?"" "",but himself.
And the character of Gomer as we all know IS a bumbler but one with a heart of gold who would give his all to help a friend or stranger in need. He is also as devoted to Sgt. Carter as a dog is to his master and is essentially a GOOD person,inside and out. Therefore with both characters essentially good and well intentioned people and that both basically like  one another(Carter begrudgingly so!),it is no surprise TV audiences responded in kind to the show and made it the success it was. Five years was a good run for any show then or now.
This season has alot of great moments. For example,Ronnie Schell returns this last season as Corporal Slater, and replaces Corporal Boyle as Carter's right hand man(Schell had tried his hand at a series which failed during Pyle's 4th season run).Another involves a return appearance by Carol Burnett in her counter-Carter role as a sergeant,this time looking to fill a spot in a talent show. It's a tug of war with Pyle caught in the hilarious middle. Burnett and Nabours do a wonderful unforgettable number together here that lasts over 5 minutes,and it leaves you wanting more. There is also an ep near the end of the series where Gomer is told to paint a truck used for a command post. Along comes three hippies;a blatant sign of the times which was a rarity during this series run. If you look closely you will see one of hippies is none other than a young Rob Reiner!
All in all Season Five of Gomer Pyle is yet another winner of a season and is sure to please all of its' fans. Unlike previous seasons where certain scenes and music have been cut and/or altered,this season appears to have everything intact. And also like previous years this series offers up totally wholesome,FAMILY entertainment. It is written well and can be enjoyed by people of all ages. I urge you to get this final season of Gomer Pyle USMC,and watch the passing of one of the funniest and well liked/rated shows from the 1960s.",1233878400,8,3948,4.664275466284074

3530139,4,B001DHXT66,"Like all die hard Gomer Pyle fans I was so relieved when I first found out that the DVD version was FINALLY being produced. However, I did not expect Paramount to butcher some of the classic scenes as they did. You can't have your cake and eat it too, right?

Nonetheless they have restored my faith, albeit it slightly, with the final season being mostly intact. The Carol Burnett/Nabors duet is fantastic episode which shows the strength and amazing chemistry the two shared on stage together, and the Marine chorus episode where Sergeant Carter can't hold a note left me in stitches once again. It was truly evident that Frank Sutton and Jim Nabors had perfected their respective roles by this time and every episode in this season demonstrates that.

All in all, I have to say that I'm not whole-heartedly impressed with the direction the production of the DVD's has taken but at least they made the last season bearable and I'm much more inclinced to rewatch the entire series over again. In the words of General Cortez... VIVA GOMER PYLE!",1231200000,2,1044,4.730769230769231

Would highly recommend to any comedy lover. Will not be disappointed.",1230163200,2,142,5.217391304347826
3530141,5,B001DHXT66,BY THE FIFTH SEASON THE CHARACTERS HAVE PERFECTED THEIR PARTS AND IT SHOWS. THIS SEASON IS ONE OF THE FUNNIEST EVER! GOMER IS STILL NAIVE AND SWEET AND SARGEANT CARTER IS CONSTANTLY IRRITATED BY GOMER'S SINCERITY AND HAPPY OUTLOOK ON LIFE. SOMEHOW GOMER ALWAYS COMES OUT A WINNER NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES HE FOULS UP ALONG THE WAY AND CARTER STILL PRETENDS THAT HE KNOWS EVERYTHING. A GREAT SHOW WITH SURPRISES AND LAUGHS AND NO FOUL LANGUAGE TO WORRY ABOUT. WHAT A RELIEF!,1229904000,2,473,4.642857142857143
3530142,4,B001DHXT66,"The final season of Gomer Pyle is the proverbial Catch 22. Most of the stories that used to be rooted in some sort of reality are gone. By season five, the writers have turned to more outlandish plots. But, this isn't a bad thing. The fifth and final season features some of the funnier episodes in the series, such as Come Blow Your Top and the Booty Prize.",1229817600,3,358,4.279411764705882
3530143,5,B001DHXT66,"I grew up on this show as a small boy from the 1960's.  I grew up watching Gomer 1st on Andy Griffith and then his own show.  Its hard to believe its been 40 years.  This like many others are now part of my extensive library of tv shows and movies.  They don't make shows like this anymore.  The kind where you laugh and the ones that bring back fond memories.  This show gave us a way to laugh when it was time to laugh and when I heard Frank Sutton died I just remember him as Sgt Vince Carter.

I have all 5 seasons of this show and it was too short of a run.  My only disagreement about the series on DVD was they could of added some more extras.  Cast updates, maybe a insight on the episode we would view.  I know that Jim Nabors is still alive, and also Ronnie Schell.  But overall I very much love this series and glad to have it part of my movie library.",1229558400,,863,3.930635838150289
3530144,4,B001DHXT66,"It is with some relief that I can report at least two episodes from Gomer Pyle fifth season that are plot reliant on songs appear on the DVD set unchanged. The extended musical number between Carol Burnett and Nabors is there and ""Blowing In The Wind"" miraculosly survived in the hippie episode. I still don't approve of what CBS/Par did to this series, but the episodes I was worried about came through largely unscathed.

(I was also relieved that earlier the climax to the Washington two-parter ""Impossible Dream"" is there).",1227916800,11,527,4.855555555555555
3530145,5,B001DHXT66,And somehow I doubt CBS PARAMOUNT will be releasing Jim Nabors followup series soon after GOMER PYLE called THE JIM NABORS HOUR. Too many musical numbers that would be edited out leaving very little left for a DVD.,1219968000,2,214,4.657894736842105

8293378,5,B001DHXT66,"A real shame that so many of the songs Gomer sang were editied.  There is one song Gomer sang in particular that stands out in my mind.
Gomer was on a date with a stripper (whom Gomer was unaware  that she was a stripper).  He took her up to a look out point where the woman thought Gomer was going to make advances toward her, but instead he just talked and sang to her.  The song was  (I think)....""100 Miles"".  Something about a train and you could hear it blow frrom a hundred miles away.  Thanks to anyone who could answer this.",1451174400,,533,4.166666666666667
