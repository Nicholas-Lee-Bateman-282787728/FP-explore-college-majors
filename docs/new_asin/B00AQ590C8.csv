5467901,5,B00AQ590C8,"I Remember watching this cartoon as a kid and to be honest I really liked this show, Now that its finally out on DVD it's a thrill to watch the episodes again. This volume is 32 of the 65 episodes and its still satisfying enough plus a bonus episode of Heathcliff for more nostaligic value, So I hope the 2nd volume comes out real soon with the rest of the episodes.",1361318400,,366,4.169014084507042
5467902,5,B00AQ590C8,"Anybody who grew up in the 1980s must remember the animation boom on Saturday mornings and weekday afternoons. I have great memories of sitting in the floor eating a bowl of cereal and watching my favorite toons. Mill Creek Entertainment has released volume one of the 1987 series Beverly Hills Teens. The series was similar to the popular Sweet Valley High books as it involved the daily lives of rich teenagers. Yes, the show was aimed for a female audience, but I found myself watching several episodes as I waited for Alvin & the Chipmunks to start.

Beverly Hills Teens had a wide variety of characters such as the scheming Bianca Dupree, the laid-back Blaze Summers, the money crazed Buck Huckster, the 10-year-old freshman Chester McTech, the part-time model Larke Tanner, and the jock Troy Jeffries.

The 32 episodes on Volume One are:

Disc One: Double-Surfing Double-Cross, The Dog Ate My Homework, The Makeover, My Fair Wilshire, Robot Romance, Casting Call, Down & Out at the Teen Club, Chase of a Lifetime, Downhill Racer, Radley Wipes Out

Bonus Episode: Heathcliff - Going Shopping/ Cat in the Fat

Disc Two: Shipwrecked, Halloween in the Hills, Visit From a Prince, Camp Camping, Dream Date, The Perfect Gift, A Time to Remember, Chester the Matchmaker, Who Wears the Pants?, Open For Business, Operations: Soap Opera

Disc Three: Teenclub Carnival, Potions of Love, The Teen Cup, Ghost Story, Fairy Tale Flake Out, Nothing But the Gossip, Now We're Cooking!, Old At Heart, Death Valley 500, Star Split, Double Your Trouble

Beverly Hills Teens only lasted for 65 episodes, so I'm surprised, but glad that Mill Creek Entertainment has released this forgotten 80s gem to DVD for the first time. The plots are at times outrageous, but not too unbelievable. The teens' wealth is exaggerated a bit as they deal with typical stereotypical teenage problems. From the hairdos, clothes, gadgets, to the slang, all the best and worst of the 1980s are represented here. I had a nostalgic blast watching the Beverly Hills Teens.

5467903,5,B00AQ590C8,"I am a product of the late 80's kid, my sister was born in the 1970's so she was the one watching this and had the original VHS tapes; which I ended up ""Secretely borrowing"" for the last 20+ years! I loved it; JustKIDS/DIC had some of the best shows: Maxie's World (PLEASE PUT ALL EPISODES OF THAT SHOW ON DVD SOON!) and so many others. Beverly Hills Teens was kind of ahead of its time with storylines and over the top characters; it was just good ole fashioned-high end fashioned fun. I loved it-still love watching the VHS tapes but am THRILLED BEYOND REASON for the DVD's! I hope to write another review once I get my copy next week! Whoooooo! :)

5467957,5,B00AQ590C8,"Finally this series gets its due. I was in preschool when this came out, and watched it all the time for the short time it was on TV. Eight years ago I rediscovered the series in a video rental store, and have been hooked ever since. Finally seeing the whole series on DVD is a dream come true, since it's a rare show. It encapsulates the 80s: the humongous hair, screaming neon colors, surfer slang, outrageous outfits, and over the top tech and decadence. Even the characters seem to know and love their campiness .

Despite the disclaimer to point out that the material is old and has some imperfections, I found the quality stellar, even on a standard definition set. The colors ,detail, and sound were just as pristine as the original airing

5467959,5,B00AQ590C8,"I had only seen one episode or two of this 1987 cartoon on VHS prior ordering this new three-disc collection. I was very surprised at how highly entertaining I find this series! It's unusual for an animated program to do such a solid job of portraying teenagers as realistic, while simultaneously mixing in highly fantasy-like elements in the plots. This combination makes for a zany, often hilarious show which is the perfect escape from the pressures of everyday life.

The relationship between the always-scheming Bianca--with her self-obsessed nature, and the self-deprecating Wilshire (her chauffeur) is a hoot. The predicaments that they get one another into makes for both suspense and drama--but always in a lighthearted way. Meanwhile, the all-encompassing computer genius of Chester provides for some fascinating goofiness. Total suspension of disbelief is required for a lot of the storylines; but truth be told, some of the then-futuristic technological gadgets portrayed in the Teens' interactions are not too far off from what's come to be the norm in the 21st century!

Highly recommended.",1373673600,6,1104,5.375722543352601

Before we were ever introduced to 90210, we had Beverly Hills Teens!  With this set ya get to see some great episodes.  Some of my faves on the set include ""The Dog Ate My Homework"" and ""Dream Date"".  With the show ya get to meet great characters like Larke, Troy, Tara, Jett, Gig, Radley, Shanelle. Blaze and Chester.  And of course there's also Pierce (The Royal Pain) and Bianca (The 'B').  I'd definitely recommend this to anybody who grew up with this or if they've heard of it and never did get to see it, like me, to get this!  Ya won't regret it and you'll get to see these teens livin' in style and doin' it right in BEVERLY HILLS!",1457308800,,765,4.128378378378378
