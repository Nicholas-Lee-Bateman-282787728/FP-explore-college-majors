I am grateful to have had the opportunity to view this story . This story needs to be available

5724604,5,B004XFU8NC,"This video was awesome.  I used to have the videos but lost them.  I have also seen it on PBS.  At the Defense Language Institute English Language Center at Lackland AFB, Texas, where I taught for many years, I sometimes showed it to foreign military students who were pilots.  I never tired of watching this awesome film. Please try to obtain a DVD copy of this film.  You can go to the web site for the film and there you can contact Quentin Aanenson's daughter by by e-mail as I did this afternoon. Please do everything you can to ob tain this movie, especially on DVD.",1360713600,9,572,4.3584905660377355
5724605,5,B004XFU8NC,"Best WW2 documentary I have seen. Aanenson tells his history during his time as a fighter pilot over Europe elegantly. A must have for anyone interested in first-hand accounts be Vets of the War to End All Wars.

It IS available for purchase through his daughter. Search his website for the order form link. Aanenson did not want to profit from his documentary, hence the difficulty of getting it. But it's available if you look hard enough. I got my DVD copy just yesterday.",1352764800,14,475,4.654761904761905
5724606,5,B004XFU8NC,I saw this program some time ago on PBS and have never forgotten it.  Aanenson's quiet yet heartfelt account is a special tribute to all those young men who risked their lives for us during ww2.  His understated yet direct way of telling his story makes its impact even greater. This should definitely be made available on DVD for purchase.  Let us hope that someone will decide to do this soon.,1347840000,6,395,4.535211267605634
5724607,5,B004XFU8NC,"It is Memorial day weekend.  Before running a Amazon search for this product, I scanned all the 125+ channels on my cable hoping this powerful documentary would be televised again. I'm surprised its not.

This documentary made such an impression on me I still remember watching it 20 years ago as if it was yesterday.

I have a daugther who wants to join the marines and a son who has no concept what young men his age faced 70 years ago.

A Fighter Pilot's Story should be available as a public service to honor the incredible courage of those boys who so quickly became men.

This is one product on Amazon the price of which should not reflect supply and demand, it should, and probably needs to be, widely available.",1338076800,22,719,4.5
5724608,5,B004XFU8NC,This is a complete and total disgrace that this item in not available.  This story needs to be told over and over again to all present and future generations. Someone needs to get this corrected ASAP and it needs to be in DVD too.,1316908800,25,230,4.2272727272727275
5724609,5,B004XFU8NC,This is one of the great documentaries of WWII.  It made a huge impression on me.  It is a shame to see it unavailable.  I urge the family and/or owners of the footage to bring it out in modern form.,1306713600,29,199,3.925
8582711,5,B004XFU8NC,Truly amazing and very moving. The first  time I watched it I rewound it and watched it again. Every American should see this documentary to appreciate the sacrifices that were made for them. He is just one of many thousands that would do it all again if they were able and their country called. Rest in peace Quentin C. Aanenson.,1505606400,,330,4.5
8582712,5,B004XFU8NC,This is IMO the best WW2  documentary of a first hand account told by a fighter pilot that lived it.  Excellent gun camera footage and loads of personal pictures are included.  Shame that this documentary isn't more readily available in dvd or digital format.  This is history that needs to be better preserved.,1501545600,,311,4.811320754716981
8582713,5,B004XFU8NC,"This story touched my heart so deeply. It is the best World War II video that I have ever seen, and narrated so beautifully by Quentin C. Aanenson and his lovely wife Jackie.  When I watched this movie on PBS, I called to order a copy ofit on VHS. The voice answering my call was none other than Quentin C. Aanenson himself! It was such an honor being able to talk to this American hero and I will never forget our conversation as long as I live. Although I have the VHS video, I would love to own it on DVD. It is a sad shame that this video is no longer available. It is something that everyone should see.",1477440000,4,608,4.066666666666666
8582714,5,B004XFU8NC,The DVD is still available at www.quentinaanenson.com as of Jan 2016,1452643200,,68,5.2727272727272725
8582715,5,B004XFU8NC,"This story is an epic story of WW11 experiences and should  be reproduced and live on in history for future generations.  I can hardly believe that
funds cannot be found for this purpose.......how about contacting various foundations, especially Veterans' organizations., or setting up a trust?
I would certainly contribute to such a cause.  I am in the teaching profession and such histories are being eliminated in textbooks, so it could well
be that WW11 stories will be but a small bit in history.",1426464000,2,501,5.0120481927710845
8582716,5,B004XFU8NC,"Can only echo the numerous reviews calling for this amazing story to available in DVD or other electronic media...it is vital to our knowledge of just what WWII was all about and the enormous courage of our soldiers, sailors and airmen. It is 5 stars + in my opinion.

8582717,5,B004XFU8NC,This is a remarkably good piece of work. Very hard to find. I can't imagine why it isn't available on DVD.,1418342400,,106,4.095238095238095
8582718,5,B004XFU8NC,Saw this on PBS and am flabbergasted I can't get a copy cause some stingy person won't donate music rights. This is a disgrace to Quentin's legacy and memory. Ken Burns could fix it but he won't.,1417392000,2,195,4.297297297297297
8582719,5,B004XFU8NC,My father was in the unit when Quentin got there and can be spotted in the briefing room...H.W. 'Bill' Collins. The new guys were going down 1 in 4 every day...every day. The vets didn't get very close to the new pilots...Q touches on that later in the doc. I would like to see this available...,1416614400,3,295,4.285714285714286
8582720,5,B004XFU8NC,"I was the editor and son in law of Quentin Aanenson.  It's unfortunate that the family is unable to supply the documentary anymore. The music rights ran out.  I thought about re-editing a new version in HD, but it's way to cost prohibited and would require some major sponsor dollars.",1399248000,3,284,4.66
