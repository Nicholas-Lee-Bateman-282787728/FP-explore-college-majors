8376343,5,B002OQZE8G,"The Best of Ghost Hunters DVD contains 5 classic episodes from the first 3 seasons of the show.

Episodes:
105-November 3, 2004 Eastern State Penitentiary/Philadelphia, PA
201-July 27, 2005 Myrtles Plantation/St. Francisville, LA
219-May 3, 2006 St. Augustine Lighthouse/St. Augustine, FL
222-May 31, 2006 The Stanley Hotel/Estes Park, CO
306-November 15, 2006 Attack of the Irish Elemental/County Offaly, Ireland - Leap Castle

These 5 episodes remain as some of the best in the history of the show. This is also worth buying if you are like me and already own all the Ghost Hunters Box Sets on DVD. The first 4 episodes listed above are from the first 2 seasons when the DVDs were made by Big Vision Entertainment. The quality of those DVDs was somewhat disappointing and with this DVD the sound and picture is flawless for these classic episodes. Great buy for Ghost Hunters fans.",1324080000,4,883,5.0

8376345,1,B002OQZE8G,"first of all, I hate reality television --- it's done because it provides cheap and tawdry thrills.  i bought this dvd to get a flavor for what has kept these people on television for so many years.  it's really stupid --- and i do believe in ghosts and the paranormal --- what i got from this ""best of"" show is a group of people who look like they drink beer more than anything else --- going out and feeling for cold spots and trying to determine whether a shadow on a wall is a spirit or one of them...  stupid, stupid, stupid...",1267574400,,532,4.196078431372549

I've been watching Ghost Hunters (via satellite and in the States) from almost the very beginning. I've now seen the original programs and have read the books of Jason and Grant too. I have to say that I believe that ghosts may exist, but I want some kind of evidence. Some kind of proof. These investigators -- and their paranormal investigation team -- work on the same premise. They attempt to ""debunk"" paranormal claims, but when they gather evidence that is hard to ""debunk"" or ""dispute,"" they are left with evidence that may actually support life after death (i.e., ghost, paranormal activity).

While Ghost Hunters works with a scientific leaning by utilizing technical equipment from EMF meters / K2 meters, digital thermometers, night vision cameras and thermal sensor equipment, etc., other paranormal programs utilize spirit mediums and the like. While I do not discount psychic mediums and sensitives, their evidence is hard to prove or ""debunk."" Nevertheless, programs like ""Paranormal State"" and ""Paranormal Cops"" (broadcast on A&E) have their place as well. They are certainly interesting. Psychic mediums like John Edward and Chip Coffee are quite interesting. In fact, I've been watching John Edward for many years. He's gotten a bit ""mushy"" as of late (even for WE) -- his original program on SyFy used to display his medium abilities more readily. In short, more readings.

Writers and psychic researchers like Peter Cayce are also quite interesting. Peter Cayce utilizes Science, Philosophy and Religion to come up with explanations for the afterlife and reincarnation and Karma. Interesting material.

In any case, the paranormal field is an interesting one. I'd really like to see more programs about legitimate psychics and paranormal investigators like Ghost Hunters, John Edward and Peter Cayce.
