8574473,5,B000BN6M4E,"My wife and I have purchased A LOT of dance instruction DVDs, most of which have been totally useless.

I can tell you that these are by far the best we've come across!

We found both the Librero's beginner's series, ""Big band, Swing & Nightclub Dancing"" and ""Latin Dancing & Argentine Tango"" easy to understand and follow.

Their experience with teaching people to dance is obvious and their elegant dance style when they demonstrate the patterns is a good role model to imitate.

We would definitely recommend them to anybody who is an absolute beginner and has been frustrated trying to learn to dance.",1204848000,5,605,4.788461538461538
