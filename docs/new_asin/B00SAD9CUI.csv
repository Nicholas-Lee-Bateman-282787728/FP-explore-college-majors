8697928,4,B00SAD9CUI,"World Champion Perspective Vol 1:

World Champion Perspective by Metropolitan Chess is a DVD of three high level chess games annotated by former World Chess Champion Viswanathan Vishy Anand.  The games were based on lectures that Anand gave to top scholastic chess players when Anand traveled to Los Angeles in 2012 and 2013. The running time of the DVD is 2 hours and 28 minutes and includes an extra game between Anand and Morozevich and tips on how to build an opening repertoire.

The games on the DVD are between Nakamura-Gelfand 2013, Anand-McShane 2003, Anand-Topalov 2007, and the extra game between Anand-Morozevich 2007. I am making an assumption that Anands lecture were theme based as all of the games are from the Sicilian defense; two Sveshinkovs and two Najdorfs. All of the games were highly interesting and complicated.

The technical quality and editing of the DVD is excellent and the graphics were superb. You really get the feeling that you are attending a private chess lecture. My comparison is based on chess lectures on YouTube, ICC and other chess internet sites. A good idea the authors have is to pause the DVD at critical points and ask the listener what he/she would do in the current position. This interaction aids the learning process and keeps the material interesting.

Anand comes off on the DVD as a very knowledgeable and likable person. You can tell that he loves chess and this probably contributes to his longevity at the elite level. You can also grasp his genius when he goes through thickets of variations on the virtual board. In the introduction to the DVD Anand recommends that you go through the DVD at least two times to absorb the information. This advice is well founded as these games are very complicated with many twists and turns. In one game there was a possibility of having four queens on the board in a sub-variation.

The extra material on how to build an opening repertoire was interesting. Anand compares the repertoires of GM Ivanchuk who plays everything under the sun, to Kramnik, Aronian, and himself. The most practical advice that Anand gave in regards to a repertoire was make sure you are always comfortable with what you play. Anand said that he gave up the Grunfeld because he was not able to respond adequately to surprises by his opponents. In contrast to the Semi-Slav, He was always able to work everything out over the board.

My quips with DVD was that sometimes it was difficult to follow the variations and the return to the main line. Maybe a caption back to the main line would help, but I noticed I was able to follow the content better on my second pass of the material. It would have been good if the authors had included PGN files of Anand games or his games in the Sicilian.

This DVD is only recommended to the serious tournament players as Anand flies through the opening variations and theory very fast and often starts his commentary on move 14 or after. He does not comment on obvious blunders and he assumes the person is proficient with chess databases and chess engines. If you are a Sicilian aficionado the DVD is a must have for the middle and endgame guidance. For under $30 you are getting expert guidance from a former World champion and I think this makes the DVD priceless.

The publisher provided a copy of the DVD to me in exchange for my honest review.",1431043200,2,3357,4.705281090289608
