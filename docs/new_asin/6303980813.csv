758125,5,6303980813,This video chronicles the machiavellian lives of the first four Roman emperors as seen through the eyes of Claudius I.

758282,4,6303980813,"BD Version:  Won't play on my player.  Apparently, BD's coded as A/B/C region playable will not play on Sony or Panasonic players.  The BD's need to be coded as ""region free"" to play on a Sony or Panasonic. if not region A  Weird.  I guess will work on Samsung or LG BD player, or so I am told, but that does me no good at the moment.

So, if you have a Sony or Panasonic BD player, purchase the DVD US region version otherwise you'll have to wait for a BD region A version.

1.26.17 addendum:

Apparently the issue is the frame rate not the region lock.  The North American frame rate (60 hz) for television is different than Europe (50hz).  If your DVD player is not capable of displaying both frame rates you can't watch on a North American player.  However, many players are built for both markets and inherently are capable of both 50 hz and 60 hz.  When these DVD's are produced they are copied to the disc in their native frame rate.

Most TV's don't have an issue as they'll convert all to 60 hz or 120 hz for viewing.",1459209600,2,1026,4.22680412371134

758420,5,6303980813,"One of my very favorite miniseries. The cast of this can never be topped and Derek Jacobi was magnificent as the stuttering, limping, twitching Claudius, Brian Blessed as the bluff Augustus, John Hurt as the crazy Caligula and no one can beat Sian Phillips as the cold, cruel and quite evil, Livia. I bought this set when it came out on VHS and even though I still have it I couldn't resist buying the DVDs to replace them. Not something to watch if you are squeamish as it shows fairly well the viciousness of the Caesars to each other and anyone in their orbit. Debauchery, torture, murder and incest were the order of the day, anything to further one's ambitions or to hold on to power.

758545,5,6303980813,"Truly one of the greatest classic TV series of all time. Although the sets and production are spare and very '70's, the acting is beyond superlative, and the costumes (especially the women's gowns) are quite sumptuous.  This, and Elizabeth R, are to my mind, the greatest television ever made. It is impossible not to lose yourself completely in ever-tightening web of intrigue and evil surrounding Claudius, who needs all his (half-) wits to survive.",1408233600,,451,5.094594594594595
758546,5,6303980813,"Stories about Ancient Rome have always been endlessly fascinating to me. This mini-series based on Robert Graves novels I CLAUDIUS and CLAUDIUS THE GOD are even more entertaining than the book. In this series from the BBC, all the Patricians are portrayed by British Actors, all of whom speak in a British Upper crust accent. This is somehow appropriate as the novels were written by an  Englishman, Robert Graves. This story of the Julian ruling Dynasty whih covers some five generations, is presented as though it were DALLAs or DYNASTY or any one of a number of Prime Time American Soap Operas; a format that was all the rage when this series was originally presented. This approach makes the entire series both accessible and compelling. These folks stop at nothing in their Pursuit of Power and Money. They are a brutal, superstitious lot, for the most part, with the exception of Claudius, who is largely ignored, due to the fact that he is physically challenged and has a pronounced stutter. His family thinks that he is mentally impaired as well, thereby saving him from the assassination attempts that decimate the rest of his family. Performances by Derek Jacobi; John Hurt; George Baker; Brian Blessed; Margaret Tyzack and a host of estimable British actors keep the action moving. Best of all is probably Sian Phillips, who gives us her best Bette Davis-Katherine Hepburn as  Empress Livia with a heart of stone that you are ever likely to see. After one poisonous adventure, a character tells her how good she is, and Livia responds, borrowing a line from the future Mae West ""Goodness has nothing to do with it"" (delivered with a straight face). This is my favorite mini-series of all time, and after having owned it on VHS, DVD and re-mastered DVD, I can say that if they ever manage to transfer this to Blu-Ray, I'll buy it again. Buy the best copy you can afford. Highly Recommended!",1404864000,,1900,4.807339449541284
758547,5,6303980813,"Is there anything that Derek Jacobi can't perform?  The entire cast of characters, the settings, and the story are so well done you will want to watch every episode non-stop.  If you love historical fiction - buy this set.",1403568000,,222,4.666666666666667

758606,5,6303980813,"I like to watch this PBS series close to Easter time, because it shows what was going on in the Roman Empire at around the time of Christ and early Christanity. The stories are very riviting, with corruption and intriege. Ceasar Augustus, and Ceasar Claudius do become Romans most noble Ceasars. A few of the episodes have some nudity, possible the equivelant of a PG 13 movie rating. Key information comes from the writings of contemporary Sleutonius.

758777,5,6303980813,"This very famous series kept PBS viewers coming back week after week to keep up with the dirty deeds in the palaces of ancient Rome.  Derek Jacobi, John Hurt, Sian Phillips, Brian Blessed and Patrick Stewart throw themselves into their roles and wallow in them.  My pick for the outstanding contributor, however, is Jack Pulman, who wrote the script from the original Robert Graves book, which was primarily narration.  Pulman brought the characters to life brilliantly with his characterful writing.  The omissions in this release are missed but not crucial to telling the story.  The production is lavish and up to the best of the BBC imports.",1366070400,,645,4.990654205607477
758778,4,6303980813,"I had seen this some time back when it was broadcast and remembered being surprised at how much I enjoyed it back then.  It was about a character whom I knew little and others whom I had known about but not in such depth.  Based on those positive memories I got I Claudius to watch again now that I had aged and my experiences have shifted my observation point.

When the DVD set arrived, the first show was typical of the times in which it was mad.  The almost monochromatic, close-up infused style used by dramatic TV in those times was a bit distracting.  But, as the story developed those trappings fell away and I was soon lost in the story and watched the series again with interest and pleasure.  I felt the lead role was well cast and bought Cadfael based on that alone.

If old Rome is a subject of interest you cannot help but find this series entertaining and informative.  If it is too limited in its production you might find the HBO mini series ROME a good watch.",1347235200,,977,4.329670329670329

With some persistance we managed to view it all and enjoyed it.

Based on Robert Graves two novels about I Claudius, Claudius is a member of the Judeo-Claudian Roman family line.  He probably had cerebral palsy but in this story is afflicted with infantile paralysis or polio.  Claudius has a shake of a head, a pronounced limp and stutters when he speaks.  Because he is a member of the royal family, he is educated but assumed a fool anyway.  Through the reign of Emperor Augustus, his grandfather, he views his relatives being killed one by one by intrigue.  Livia, his grandmother and the queen is portrayed as the cause of most poisonings and troubles in order to have her son Tiberius succeed the throne.  As time goes on, Tiberius succeeds but doesn't work out well.  Caligula after him is a mad man who kills indiscriminately.  When he is murdered.  Pretorian Guards, seeking to keep their jobs raise Claudius I to the throne.  Does it turn out well or is it a disaster.  Probably a bit of both.

I took a chance with I Claudius, and to be honest I wasn't expecting much with it being upwards of 40 years old and Rome the series being such a near flawless achievement. I Claudius is spectacular! Maybe the most spectacular TV series I have ever seen and it certainly does hold up to Rome, it may even be better than Rome. Infact I Claudius would be a great companion piece to Rome since it begins around the middle of Augustus's reign exactly where Rome the series left off. If you are looking for a quality TV series to dive into that is deserving of your time, you can't go wrong with I Claudius.

758845,5,6303980813,"For those who have been confused with sound and video quality of the set and/or confused as to whether the show had edited content I hope this review will clear up these issues.

First off, this review is on the remastered box set. (The one with Hurt/Jacobi/Stewart on the cover.)  The reason I say this is that part of the confusion is that the reviews for both this set and the box set released way back when seem to be the same exact reviews and I think this is part of the confusion.

Second, the remastered set is not edited though episode one was actually made two hours combining Poison is Queen and Waiting in the Wings together with Claudius talking more about his father Drusus then going right to the medicine ball scene with Drusus and Tiberius.  I'm not sure why this was done but it was only a scratch your head moment for a second and completely forgotten once the show started rolling again.  There were even a couple scenes that seemed to have been extended most notably the scene where Cassius, Marcus, and a couple others plot the death of Caligula, and implied incestuous scene with Nero and his mother Agrippina's which no longer was implied.

Third the sound and video quality were just fine at least for me it was.

As for the show itself.  Well I did take my chances that the dvd set was going to be just fine because of the story's greatness.  I was not disappointed even a little bit.  For those on the fence on whether to buy this or not.  I hope that I have convinced you to do so.",1308873600,26,1509,4.353571428571429
758846,5,6303980813,"Imagine a play being filmed with different stage sets, corresponding make-up and props, and you have a pretty good idea of what this series looks like.  This doesn't have to be huge detracting factor.  You've probably seen plays before and enjoyed them, and this one is very enjoyable as well especially if you liked HBO's ""Rome"".

The first thing that makes I Claudius worth watching is its basic plot-line.  Claudius is the stuttering cripple grandchild of Augustus Caesar and he lives in the house of Augustus (Octavian) Caesar and his wife, Livia.  As such, no one takes Claudius very seriously and in fact he is regarded as a fool.  However while it's true that he is clumsy, he stutters, and he walks funny, his brain is anything but crippled.  When he learns that the wife of Caesar is systematically poisoning all who stand in the way of her stepson Tiberius from taking the throne when Caesar dies, he is indeed in the fortunate position of being regarded as an idiot since all who stand in Livia's way soon discover that ""poison is king"".

After watching the first two episodes, my impression was that the series lumbered along a bit, not completely devoid of interest, but also not the riveting high production ride that ""Rome"" was.  In terms of PRODUCTION and even acting, Rome is of a higher caliber for the most part, the difference between a well-financed modern production and a theatre presentation put to film 35 years ago. In spite of that, there are many memorable characters here as well (John Hurt's Caligula, and Claudius himself are certainly unforgettable).

Having finished the complete Rome series (only 2 seasons), ""I Claudius"" picks up almost exactly where Rome ends, i.e. with Octavian (Augustus) and Livia now with children of their own.  Even Marcus Agripa is still in the scene when the series begins.  Occasionally ""I, Claudius"" borders on a soap, and as I said, it plods along somewhat in the beginning.  But most will not be able to tear themselves away from it after getting through the third episode. Come to think of it, it took me a few episodes to get hooked on ""Rome"" as well. The acid test for me in this case was the fact that I actually spent one or two nights watching it until dawn.  For a show to do that to me it has to be engaging.  ""I, Claudius"" fits that bill once it gets rolling and I'd urge anyone who gets the series not to be put off by the initial 'stage' vibe.  Even without the high production value of HBO's Rome, the basics of the storyline here should be enough for most to maintain interest.  And having seen Rome already will really give you an edge on getting into it since you'll already be familiar with many of the main characters and background on Julius Caesar, how Augustus came to be emperor, etc - which is where ""I, Claudius"" begins.  Another likable device used in this series is the voice-over narration by Claudius himself.  The story is his tale.

For those who inevitably start getting confused by the plethora of family lines and character names, there is a small insert in the DVD set outlining who's who.  And while another detracting factor is that there are no subtitles, the sound if turned up a bit is clear enough to be mostly well understood.  I used subtitles with HBO's Rome (region 2) to get familiar with people and place names.  I was sorry there were no subtitles here, but it really turned out to be much less of an issue than I thought it would be.  Again, if you've already seen ""Rome"" you are in a much better position toward appreciating and understanding this series.

You haven't seen so many snakes in one basket since ""Rome"".  Even without the lavishness or attention to detail that made Rome great, ""I, Claudius"" remains a mesmerizing tale.",1307404800,4,3745,4.636363636363637
758847,5,6303980813,"I recently purchased the remastered version of this wonderful series. The quality of the DVD is very acceptable but the volume needs to be cranked up to almost twice normal on my set. When watching there is no doubt that this was shot for television long ago - about 35 years in the form of a play made for television - harsh shadows from less than ideal lighting are not uncommon. Also, don't expect the quality sets that existed in shows like HBO's Rome or Riley Scott's, Gladiator. But, those shortfalls are very acceptable since both the story and the acting is top shelf. The DVD set includes a very useful chart of the family tree which I consulted many times while watching the series. It also includes about an hour or so on the movie, I Claudius, which was never made and is nothing special, especially if you watch that after watching the mini-series.

It does help to know a bit about Roman history of this period to fully appreciate the story but that is not required. I did know a bit about the history of this period and also learned much more including context for certain key events. For example, why did the pretorian guards, after killing Caligula, want a new emperor, Claudius, when Claudius himself didn't want the job and instead wanted the republic restored? The reason is that under Augustus the Senate created the Pretorian guards, about 4,500 of them - think of them as the ancient equivalent of the Secret Service and Gestapo for the emperor. Their job, which included higher pay than regular soldiers with a earlier retirement would mean that if the Republic was restored they would be out of work, and possibly end up roaming the streets taking what they want. They needed an emperor to hold their job plus going back to a republic could mean yet another civil war.

This a wonderful story with exceptional acting and by watching it more than once you gain a great appreciation for how little dialog is wasted on fluff. I watched it twice and just ordered the book which includes much more detail. This is a must have series for anyone that loves the roman empire or just a good story of plots, power, sex and raw ambition. All the major actors are perfectly cast and old uncle Claudius seems to just grown on you as the series progresses. There is a reason why 35 years later this series is still highly revered. It is different but just as compelling as HBO's Rome - it essentially picks up the story almost exactly where Rome (part II) left off, seven years after the Battle of Actium where Mark Anthony lost to Augustus and then took his own life - Mark Anthony's daughter, Antonia, is Clauidus' mother. Augustus then takes charge of the empire by himself and his wife, Livia, is far more ruthless than Atia, Augustus' mother featured in the HBO mini-series. Highly recommended!!!!",1300060800,3,2813,4.624

The only edit on this CD that I noticed is that at the beginning of episode 1, the first half of the dance is cut.  It's a shame because in that brief minute or so the characters are established.  It can't be because the dancers are topless, because the orgy sequence later on is complete as I remember it.  Perhaps there was a technical issue.

However, Incitatus still attends the wedding, and Messalina still competes with the whore.  As  far as I can remember after many viewings of the VHS, the series is complete.

The sound and picture are much better than the VHS, and I assume were the best that the crew could do with the 70's tape.  I would not hesitate to purchase it.  It would be great to have included some memorabilia or making of on the discs rather than a documentary about an unfinished and terribly dated film with Charles Laughton.

He was writing about the British upper class of the 20'and 30's in the guise of ancient Romans.

The first few episodes take a little concentration because of all the relationships, but stick with it through the poisonings, adulturies, orgies, and a compellingly dissolute depiction of Emperor Caligula (John Hurt). The acting is fine throughout, especially by Derek Jacobi as Claudius, the stutterer who rose to emperor by default. The final two episodes lapse into soap opera, but what a soap opera!

It is based on 2 books written many years ago that have been criticized for filling in the many blanks of the actual historical records and relying on some suspect accounts from at or around the period covered. Well, it was interesting TV, so I won't complain. I have purchased the 2 books and plan to enjoy them as well.

Claudius had some sort of birth defect - maybe cerebral palsy. He was seen as an idiot, but apparently was not this at all. The series covers the period just before his birth to just after his death. These were wild times in ancient Rome!

I really like Derek Jacoby's performance as Claudius. Many of the other characters were very well done too. I especially enjoyed the performance of the actress who played Livia, the wife of Augustus and I think Claudius' grandmother; she was just wicked and enjoyed being wicked - a truly great performance here. Wait until you see how she describes how she killed Augustus. Fans of Star Trek, the Next Generation will enjoy Patrick Stewart (Cpt. Picard) as Sejanus. Another really evil character - but he does get what he deserves in the end. The guy who played Caligula was excellent - he looked truly nuts.

That being said, I guess the series budget was not large. The sets were maybe a little cheesy at times. Some of the choices of actors were a little off too. It is hard to take seriously some of the really puny guys selected for roles of celebrated Roman warriors, and the not so voluptuous women chosen to play some of the most desirable women on offer in Rome. Well, they were not major characters. Ignore this stuff and focus on the rest as it is worth the small effort required.

Even if there was some bending of the facts, the series does show things were pretty wild in ancient Rome. It is a wonder that they could keep things going so well.

As a drama, this is simply fantastic.  Many standout performances.  I've always been a huge Malcolm McDowell fan and loved his portrayal of the title character in Caligula.  However, I forgot all about that performance in light of John Hurt's take on the same character.  For the rest of my years I will never forget his dance in drag.

I was quite fascinated by the documentary of the never released Hollywood version of this.  What was most interesting was seeing Charles Laughton in action as Claudius.  As great as Derek Jacobi was in his role, I have to say that the definitive take on Claudius would certainly have gone to Laughton had this movie version ever been released.  Remarkable.

The series attempts to take the novels, that are 99% exposition and narrative, and present them in a format that is 99% dialogue. The results are not always successful, and often grindingly melodramatic, coming off as an afternoon soap opera in many places, especially in the stilted love scenes.

Some of the actors can remind you of uninspired high school players, while others are spot-on Oliviers and Burtons. The guy playing Augustus looks more like a middle-aged tourist in Bermuda shorts and sandals than the mighty general and emperor. Other actors come off as direct-from-central-casting 70's pretty boys and madmen.

The length can grueling for anyone not watching it as a weekly series, and looking for the plot is like looking for a good emperor; what can you really tell by a man's words, words and more words? Shakespeare could do it, Jack Pulman, maybe not so much.

Consider it a masterpiece for PBS tastes, and by all means read the novels, where you're assured of quality throughout.",1250899200,5,1227,4.828571428571428

759089,4,6303980813,"I, Claudius is a series that I know well from having watched the original broadcast on Masterpiece Theatre and then when it was re-broadcast.  Subsequently, I purchased the VHS tapes.  The BBC television series was fortunate in having so many great actors (many just starting their careers) and would never have been quite as successful had it not been for the astonishing performance of Derek Jacobi as Claudius.  Mr. Jacobi perfectly assumed the physical handicaps of the future emperor and portrayed him as a noble and learned man.  The supporting cast was just as remarkable with superb performances by Sian Phillips (as Livia), John Hurt (as Gaius Caligual) and Patrick Stewart (as Sejanus) just to name those that come immediately to mind.  The production is also quite good although many of the sets are reused with a lot of frequency and I was surprised to see a bust of the second century emperor Antoninus Pius in Augustus' house.

Having read many of the reviews posted at Amazon I think it is important to stress that as good a drama as I, Claudius is it is historical fiction.  I have done a great deal of research and writing about the early Roman emperors my view of I, Claudius as entertainment has altered.  It is a great soap opera but very little of it can be said to be fact yet many people take I, Claudius as accurate history of the period when it is at best a third hand reworking of the facts.  In translating I, Claudius to the small screen the producers took quite a few liberties with Robert Graves' novels and certainly any gossip reported by Suetonius was taken as fact.  A good example in I, Claudius is the scene where Caligula ""accidentally"" kills his pregnant sister Drusilla dressed as Zeus fearful that her unborn child will be more powerful than he is.  The novel has no such scene and Suetonius merely records that Drusilla died without noting anything sinister about her demise.  Yet, I have heard one of the ""talking heads"" from a History Channel program about Caligula's famous ship on Lake Nemi actually take the I, Claudius version of events as fact.

An accurate portrail of history usually does not make an interesting drama (also it would be time-consuming), and ancient history many times needs to be interpreted to reach any conclusions about what happened. I, Claudius is a great drama but for the most part fictional.  So while I highly recommend I, Claudius as a great drama I would also urge those viewers who enjoy knowing the facts to read a few books. I would recommend those by Anthony Barrett, Barabara Levick, Pat Southern and Anthony Everitt.",1233187200,7,2600,4.736141906873614

759117,4,6303980813,"While this edition is an improvement over the previous releases in terms of video and audio and the bonus extra feature is a welcome addition, viewers should be forewarned that this edition does not contain all of the footage that has been seen on previous editions (either broadcast or on home video) of this great epic. Nevertheless, I am assuming this edition represents what viewers in the UK saw on the BBC back in 1976.  I own 2 previous editions:

1. The heavily censored MASTERPIECE THEATRE edition as it aired originally on PBS (taped from a rerun in the early 90's on  shown on PBS as part of MT 20th anniversary; Claudius being the only series that was rerun in it's entirety on MT so many years after the fact.)
2. The IMAGE Laser Disc release of the mid 90's (which I believe was the source of the first DVD release).

Originally CLAUDIUS aired on MT in 13 one hr episodes. This 13 episode format was left intact for the first LD release but the censored scenes were restored, including an extension of the African slave dance in episode one, and Caligula's abortion of his sisters baby in episode 9. While these scenes remained in the broadcast. version they were censored especially the one in ep 9. There might have been other cuts, but these are the ones that stand out.

The new DVD goes back to the BBC version (as far as I can tell) and preserves the format of the original presentation. Episode 1 was 2 hours in length on BBC, thus the new DVD has only 12 episodes instead of the 13 broadcast on American TV. This was due to the fact that episode 1 had to be split in two to accommodate for the 1 hr running time of MT. In this new DVD the african slave dance scene has been shortened by about a minute, and there is a ""bridge""  scene that unifies what was MT episodes 1&2. This scene is a ""flashback setup"" and has Claudius in the gym before the wrestling scene between Drusus and Tiberius and Claudius is thinking about his Drusus when the flashback begins.  This same  flashback setup is present at the start of the MT second episode, but instead of it being in the  gym it is in Claudius study.

I have not gone through the rest of the episodes, but I did check ep 9 (now 8 in the new DVD set) and it seems to be intact. I will add other cuts and/or additions as I go through the other episodes.

I give this DVD 4 stars and it would have been a 5 if not for the shortened scenes

Livia is particularly well played.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is interested in Imperial Roman history and anyone who enjoys historical dramas.  Fast paced, great characters, murder-sex-violence-power - all in there.  I cannot say enough good things about this DVD.",1228953600,,598,4.92
759119,5,6303980813,"I belong to the generation that saw high-budget Roman period productions such as Ridley Scott's Gladiator, HBO's Rome, and even the Polish adaptation of Quo Vadis (highly recommended).  Having also been brought up in the States and becoming something of a classicist during my later education, I had read Robert Graves' books I, Claudius and Claudius the God, and heard of the BBC miniseries and always meant to see it, though not expecting much due to the age of the series and low budget it required to be realized.

When the chance came I snagged up the DVD series, and was so taken by the marvelous acting, intricate yet engaging storyline, and historical accuracy (it is not 100% accurate, but it is more accurate than the likes of Gladiator or HBO's ROME), that I watched the entire miniseries in a day.  It was released originally in the 70's, however, and it showed.  It was pity that Image Entertainment did not put in the extra money to restore such a masterpiece of television, one of Time Magazine's Top 100 television shows of all time- and rightfully so.

I believe each actor did a superb job (though I don't think Augustus was casted or played true to history, Brian Blessed played and excellent father of the Empire).  Hats off to the leading ladies, Sian Phillips as an iconic Livia no doubt, but also Margaret Tyzack plays the stoic, noble, yet imperfect matron Antonia with unforgettable force and sincerity.  Tyzack's performance is perhaps my favorite in the series, as she shines in each scene.  The writers did an excellent job in not type-casting evil as pure evil and good as pure good.  They gave Livia her reasons, and Antonia her imperfections, and the intelligent viewer is to be thankful for that.  Livilla, Messalina, and Agrippinilla were all exceptional ""bad apples of the Julio-Claudians"" as well.

As for the men, Derek Jacobi brought the stuttering Claudius off the pages of history and into life with an uncanny naturalness.  But the standout among the men, I believe, is John Hurt's Caligula which is played brilliantly, and that is no understatement.  Caligula is always an odd character in both history and fiction, and John Hurt does the impossible by injecting both hilarity and eeriness into the mentally unstable emperor. Though Malcolm MacDowell did a terrific job in the controversial, and decidedly ""smuttily inaccurate,"" version in Caligula by Tinto Brass, John Hurt's characterization is more interesting.

As a whole, the entire plot is lengthy but coherent.  You cannot help but get sucked in.  It is no boring, old costume drama, but indeed a work full of intense gravity (i.e. Antonia's ""farewell"" and the secret meeting between Posthumus and Augustus), extreme hilarity (i.e. the marriage of Claudius to Urgulanilla), or an intriguing mix of both (i.e. the exposure of Livilla's murder plot by Antonia to Claudius, Tiberius, and Caligula, or the domestic strife between Julia and Tiberius).  There is nudity and sex, but not so much that it makes you feel the need to shower after.  There is violence and vulgarity, but not so much that it seems to beat you relentlessly over the head.  I, Claudius is all about taste, variety, balance and unity.  It is the reason it is still a classic and is relevant more than thirty years after its premiere.

Liberties are taken with history, for example the infamous murder of Drusilla and cannibalism of her child by Caligula, or even the poisoning of Augustus by Livia, but speaking as a classicist, there is so much truth to the series (or at least it adheres to all the strange material we have from the sources that survive, Suetonius, Tacitus, and Dio especially).  There are so many films, many of which are my favorites (Rome, Gladiator), that I would not recommend to any student as a basic run-down of historical events.  I, Claudius is the exception.

Yesterday, I bought the remastered, 4-disc edition.  They did not give the series the ""George Lucas treatment,"" but the sound is immensely improved as is the picture.  There is hardly any hint of grain and finally it looks more like a DVD, rather than DVD on VHS like the old, 5-disc set.  The soundtrack and voices are all clear as a bell.  The menus are more appealing.  This remastered US version is also unabridged, unlike the older 5 piece US set which cuts out/censors a few parts here and there.  There are, however, still no subtitles included, but that is a minor quibble.

I do hear a film-version -a ""remake""- of I, Claudius is in the works with writer Jim Sheridan (of the film My Left Foot) acquiring the rights.  I am eager to see Robert Graves' literary classic transferred onto the big screen with a large budget comparable to the sword-and-sandal dramas of recent years from HBO and Ridley Scott, but am wary that the acting will not match those of this beloved 1970s television miniseries.  Many of them, after all, are Royal Shakespeare Company veterans.  Part of the reason I, Claudius is so great is that the acting had to compensate for the production constraints... note the amount of extras used and reused, and the prevalence of close-up indoor shots versus wide-angle outdoor ones.  Low production costs could have been a blessing in disguise.  In the meantime, however, as we wait for Sheridan's big-screen remake do not hesitate to get this remastered set of one of televisions best events.  The price is steep (though the remastered set is about 10 dollars less than the previous 5-disc version) but I would gladly pay way more for the classic material contained here.",1228348800,37,5554,4.8515376458112405

759121,5,6303980813,"Robert Graves wrote the book this fine Masterpiece Theater version is adapted upon in 1977, eight years before his death.  Graves himself was a survivor- most notably surviving the trenches of World War I as an English Infantry Officer, (which was no small feat considering the typical 80% casualty rates- at the Battle of the Somme he was listed as having died from his wounds).  Known best for his poetry, his sparkling translation of ""The Twelve Caesars"" and his friendship with conscious objector ""Mad Jack"" Siegfeid Sassoon, Graves was awarded the 1934 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for both ""I, Claudius"" and for the sequel, ""Claudius the God.""  Fortunately, this small screen adaptation by the BBC is just as good as the book.

So how's this screen adaptation?  Scary.  Thought provoking.  Entertaining.  This work brings to life Rome in the first century during the time of Christ.  Augustus (Octavian), Tiberius and Claudius Caesar are mentioned by name in the Bible.  Each of their lives (and many others) are detailed here- they each come clearly to life, with more than enough time to fully develop each of their characters.  Imagine video cameras going ""behind the scenes"" in ancient Rome, and you'll better understand what's being shown in this adaptation.

While it's a work of pure fiction, it's all based on fact.  And in the process, ""ancient"" Rome comes to life all over again.

This is eleven hours of pure drama and character development.  And ""Claudius the Idiot"", ""Claudius the Stammerer"", ""Poor Uncle Claudius"" or ""Clau-Clau-Claudius"" (as he was known to his contemporaries and family) managed to survive by staying at the edge- until he was drug into the center of things when made Emperor of Rome by the palace guard, completely against his own will.

I have noted that several reviews don't like the quality of the videotape transfer to DVD.  Ok, I will give them that.  And I will also agree that it has a very studio feel, rather than a more modern natural feel.  But I'm much more interested in the acting and the story than the quality of the screen image.  I must be showing my age, I guess.

With this work, the early Caesars come to life with all of their strengths and weaknesses.  A sparkling performance by all of the major characters only enhances my opinion of the overall package.

I sympathize with the number of reviewers who have commented on the lack of sophistication and depth in treating this period of the Roman Empire. It is important to remember, however, that this book and TV production reflect a view of history from the top- that is, as seen from those at the pinnacle or near the pinnacle of power and so neglects so much of what we now find fascinating about the Roman Empire. It also neglects its tremendous variety in all facets of life.

After listening to it, a naive viewer might come away with the idea that the Roman Empire fell because of Livia and that Claudius was simple-minded idiot. The studies of the period (especially by B.

759139,5,6303980813,"Before ""Masterpiece Theater"" started trying to pass off imported garden-variety police melodrama like ""Prime Suspect"" as something very special, it used to offer British dramas that truly were masterpieces of adaptation - shows like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Six-Wives-of-Henry-VIII/dp/B000EBD9VM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Six Wives of Henry VIII</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elizabeth-R/dp/B00005LC1D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elizabeth R</a>, and I Claudius.  I, Claudius related the early history of the Roman Empire as it followed the story of the Imperial Family through the first four Emperors.  Critics at the time tended to view it as an engrossing soap-opera, but in fact the drama, fashioned by Jack Pulman from two novels of Robert Graves, was excellent.  Livia (Sian Phillips), driven by a lust for power, schemes to see that her son Tiberius (George Baker) succeeds her husband Augustus (Brian Blessed) as Emperor, no matter who stands in the way. Desire, greed, and madness provide the backdrop for the resulting clash of interests, with the destiny of Rome - and therefore the entire ancient world - at stake.

Ignored, ridiculed and despised for his limp and his stutter, he witnesses and records the vast web of power, murder, ambition, intrigue and madness that engulfs Rome's royal family. Although not as visually colorful or explicit as HBO's ROME, I Claudius does not disappoint.

759142,5,6303980813,"Without a doubt, for an in-depth fictional portrait of another era, this mini-series more or less sets the standard.  The acting is uniformly excellent, but the depth of character, placed in context without cheap TV-style simplification, has not yet been equalled in my viewing.  I will certainly watch it with my kids and discuss the details for hours and hours.

As with all historical fiction, this version fills in a lot of gaps that we will never know, making events more dramatic or directed by malevolent intelligence, but it is an interpretation that is entirely plausible.  This is the artist's license, and Graves was such a scholar that we can trust it.  Moreover, it never crosses the line in melodrama or the maudlin.

The story takes place at the end of the Republic.  Julius Caesar is gone, and after a power struggle, Octavian (soon renamed Augustus) has emerged with his hands firmly on the reigns of power.  It is one of those watershed moments, in which an entire new way of governance is invented.  While not quite an hereditary monarchy, the Roman Emperor must designate an heir to his absolute power, which resides in the hands of two linked families:  the Julians and the Claudians.  Who will succeed Augustus is the crux of the story.  Claudius, deformed, stuttering, and apparently feeble-minded, appears as the least likely successor.  However, the candidates around Augustus keep dying in mysterious ways.  Then when successors are chosen, they lack not only the moderation of the conservative Augustus, but lack his truly masterful political instinct of maintaining certain social balances.  The result is drift, unimaginable autocratic cruelty, and the final destruction of the old oligarchic ruling classes, paving the way for an entirely new class of politicians to arise.  Amidst the most brutal manipulation and machination, Claudius finally has his turn, with very surprising results.  It is a wonderful study in absolute power and its corrupting influence.

Many reviewers have criticized the copy.  Upon viewing it, I must say that it is fine.  The problem is that it was shot in the mid-1970s, which was a less technically adept time, and as a BBC production, it is lower budget that current viewers expect.  Sure, some of the effects look chinsey, but the drama is so overpoweringly excellent that I cannot fault this.

Warmly recommended.  As a classics major, this brings what I studied to life, deepening my fascination with that vanished world.  For a general audience, this version can create an interest that will last a lifetime.  It is absolutely first rate.",1217980800,6,2604,5.056338028169014
759143,2,6303980813,"The irony is that I rented this based on high recommendations from Amazon, so I feel I should say this as a warning.  There are plenty of negative reviews for the DVD quality, but few of those recognize that the quality of the original series is low to begin with.  My wife is a TV producer and was apalled at the low-budget look of this, especially the sound.  We had it turned up over twice the volume we usually use, and it's not the transfer.  They probably used one microphone for the whole room, so if someone walks away from the camera (as they often do in soap-opera style directing) his voice will trail off.  We literally gave up on the whole series 20 minutes into the first episode.  Not just because of the poor quality, but also the whole look of it is very ""70s BBC.""  Older British television has a very distinct look, which makes it unwatchable by today's standards.  The camera angles are either one or two wide shots, and the expected close-up, revealing layers of pancake make-up and 70's hairstyles.  At no time was I convinced that I was watching a scene from ancient Rome, which was (painfully) obviously a BBC sound stage.  I won't criticize the acting, because this is a theatrical costume drama and any vapid soap-opera dialogue is par for the course.

759169,4,6303980813,"I started watching this right after both seasons of HBO's ""Rome"".  This proved interesting, not least because the story of ""I, Claudius"" starts almost exactly at the point where ""Rome"" ends. The comparison of the two series teaches a valuable lesson about what makes good TV. There are many excellent things in ""Rome"", but all its panoply of spectacular sets, thousands of extras, and in-your-face sex and violence also results in a certain superficiality. In the end it's the plot and the interaction between characters that determines the success of a series, and that's where IC wins hands down.

Based on Robert Graves's 1930's novels ""I Claudius"" and ""Claudius the god"", IC tells a tightly woven tale of murderous intrigue, madness, and lust for power, covering the reigns of four emperors: Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius himself. As in ""Rome"", it's the women who are the real driving force behind events, and my, what women they are! Next to Livia, gleefully poisoning all and sundry to clear her son's way to the throne, ""Rome""s, Atia seems a sorry little amateur. Sin Phillips gives us one of the greatest she-wolves ever to be seen on TV - yet the quality of the script is such that we nonetheless pity her when on her deathbed she's overcome with fear of the consequences her earthly actions may have for her in the hereafter.

Hers is not the only stand-out performance, for an other thing in which IC has the edge over ""Rome"" is in the quality and stature of its actors. First and foremost Derek Jacobi is unforgettable as the endearing Claudius, under whose stuttering, limping exterior hides a shrewd, intelligent and remarkably kind man. John Hurt lets go of all the brakes in a Caligula so wildly mad that he might have scared the real one. Margareth Tyzack is a believably regal Antonia, and Patrick Stewart (with hair!) a suitably dashing yet scary Sejanus. James Faulkner's unctuous, doublecrossing Herod is also memorable. Inevitably, with a cast list so long, not all performances are top notch. Fiona Walker's Agrippina struck me as rather wooden and overly emphatic, more of the stage than the screen. Nor was I quite convinced by Brian Blessed's homely, lumpish Augustus - the calculating coolness and somewhat otherworldly good looks that Simon Woods brought to this part in ""Rome"" were rather closer to what one imagines him to have been in reality. And maybe I simply had trouble adjusting to Blessed, too, because I was constantly reminded of his king Richard of Blackadder fame...

Those looking for historical accuracy will find only a little more of it here than in ""Rome"". Though as a translator Graves was intimately familiar with the original sources, his books are very much fictionalized biography - inevitably so, because there is so much that we simply don't know about the early Roman Empire. It is pretty sure though that while Livia did wield some influence, she was not the expert poisoner we see here. Her deathbed worries are anachronistic - the concept of hell was unknown to the Romans.

Made in 1976, IC is an old-fashioned studio production. Interior sets are not at all bad though, even though we see some set pieces being recycled to represent different locations. Costumes and hairdos are well executed too. And while not nearly as frank as ""Rome"" when it comes to sex and violence, IC does include an occasional naked breast and one or two severed heads, which must have been pretty shocking stuff when the series was originally aired. (Again though, the endless graphic fornication in ""Rome"" in the end succeeds less in communicating a sense of depraved sexuality than does a bedtime conversation between IC's Sejanus and Livilla in which he describes to her in some detail how it will please him to see her raped.) The make-up is more of a problem, aging characters looking at times as if they've been administered too liberal doses of Botox.

This Dutch DVD transfer is unfortunately an indifferently cheap production that looks as if it was recorded directly from VHS tape. The series is crammed onto two double-sided discs, with no extras. The image is grainy, light-dark balances are off, and there is recurring image noise. On two occasions my copy got stuck during playback. IC deserves (much) better, and prospective buyers who have Region 2 compatible equipment are best advised to seek out the 5-disc box set available on Amazon UK.",1208563200,4,4407,4.908724832214765

759249,4,6303980813,"I didn't follow this TV series on its first go-around in 1976, because I thought it would be little more than an historical soap opera.  I have not changed my mind about that, but the quality of writing and acting is, of course, far superior and the stories are much more compelling.  I found myself watching all thirteen episodes straight through over a single weekend.

History it isn't, and there is a tendency for people to forget that a movie or TV program doesn't portray reality.  But though the accounts of Tacitus and Suetonius may differ from those of Robert Graves in terms of what actually happened (if any truth can be found at all within contemporary documents), they all certainly must agree on the tone of the times and the character of the personalities involved in this era of the first four Roman emperors.

Historians say that it is unlikely that Livia was the poisoner she was cracked up to be, and Claudius probably wasn't the poor tormented sweetie -- but, then, without all that, there would be much less of a story to tell.  Oh, well, not only must the needs of drama be served, but also it is human tradition for history to be slanted by its writers.  Is a modern historical novelist or TV/cinema scriptwriter really any different from an ancient archivist twisting events into sycophantic paeans dedicated to some victorious strongman?

Regarding the video itself, I concur with other reviewers' complaints about the poor sound quality and the dreadful make-up (latex attachments that are all too visible in close-up), although the color seems to have been restored very nicely.

The hidden jewel in this boxed set is the documentary on Disc Five called ""The Epic That Never Was"".

I read ""I, Claudius"" some years ago and admittedly, it didn't form much of an impression on me. This production caught me completely off guard. I can't believe I bought this from a used-seller for $40 and was given such a treat to watch all these master-class Shakespearean actors. Why have I not heard or seen Sian Phillips before this? She's absolutely wonderful. She's such a wicked woman but intensely amusing. You get to see decades of her misdeeds, all in the name of Rome of course, but even I pitied her during her death-bed scene. There's so many brilliant characters, several who are just so wonderfully hateful, especially John Hurt as Caligula. I read somewhere that most of what we know about Caligula is rumor, that his actual recorded history is unfortunately lost. There's some concurrance though, that he was either mentally ill or suffered from epilepsy. This production however, doesn't give him an ounce pity. He's depicted as as vile and grotesque, a ""monster,"" even as a young boy.  I couldn't stop watching him or feeling afraid for any other person he came in contact with. No one was safe or able to speak out against him. John Hurt was I think only 36 at the time of this production, but he made the wisest choices as an actor. At the center of this family firestorm of murder, intrigue, and debauchery is our little Claudius. It's amazing to watch him survive through one clamity after another with barely the perception of his idiocy keeping him alive. I was a bit conflicted as to how I felt about him, though. On one hand I felt pity for him and his afflictions, and how he was mistreated by practically all his family. He was charming, loyal, and intelligent but unfortunately, too trusting. On the other hand, he barely had a back-bone. It's in his nature not to make trouble and he tries not to get involved, but sometimes that choice makes him gutless esepcially when innocent people need help. Even with some production, visual and sound problems with this DVD, I would still give this series higher than 5 stars if I could. I count myself very fortunate to have seen this. It's given me enthusiasm to buy other films and books centered around Imperial Rome. This DVD series is an absolute treasure, you won't be disappointed.",1184457600,8,2409,4.668235294117647

759276,4,6303980813,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday.  Thanks to Amazon, tracking it down was not nearly as hard as it would have been in the past.  I agree with another reviewer, the first half is definitely more superior, whilst Augustus and Livia are still firmly in control (mostly Livia!).

The series has definitely dated and today's viewer has to exercise a little patience with this.  I believe the financially beleagured BBC actually filmed this in stage form.  Hence there are many 'Actors!!', with heavy makeup.  Costumes were obviously not too taxing everyone is in a toga), and sets could be got round by confining the action to a couple of rooms and probably only one 'outdoor' fountained courtyard.  As for the crowd scenes one would expect to see at the Coliseum forgeddaboudit!!!  This is the Beeb!  With all the budgetary restrictions a Beeb production involves (I cite Mr and Mrs Badger from the BBC production of 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' in support of this - they were giants draped with what looked like shagpile).

All this aside, this adaption of Robert Graves book is one of the greats.  It is carried by the magnificent story and actually requires one to watch, listen and engage.  It can be quite funny and horrific.  Violence is everpresent, but in those days it wasn't necessary to rub the audiences' faces in it.  I am transported back to my childhood when my parents watched the series as originally televised.  We were not allowed to watch it, but I went and borrowed the book from the library anyway.

In the current cultural slump we are enduring, I Claudius is well worth a long weekend with wine and cheese and blankets and someone to giggle with.  Expect to scramble frequently for the pause button while you consult the handy family tree and character guide that comes with this edition, and the ensuing arguments about who is currently banished to a miniscule island and who is related to whom by birth or adoption.

The menus are archaic and the ""big box"" setup for the box set is disappointing (no slimline cases or folding cases to save shelf space)

759279,3,6303980813,"Watching the episodes one after another, about two each night for a week or so, I had high expectations for the series which has been so critically acclaimed.

The first episode was a good, but not fabulously great, way to begin, showing off the titanic acting talents of the likes of Brian Blessed as Augustus (whom I only know as Boss Nass in The Phantom Menace and the wrestling instructor in Alexander), Sian Phillips as Livia, and John Paul as Agrippa.

The real core focus of the series is the ""court"" dramas of the Imperial family, in which they are more like a monarchal dynasty than figureheads of Roman virtue and such.

At some point by episode two, the real focus of the series starts getting muddied.  After Livia kills Marcellus, the episodes start to mold together, with no real action or drama occuring save for the family bickering with one another.  Tiberius this, Agrippa that, Julia etc.  If it weren't for the massive amounts of makeup placed on the actors to indicate their aging, you wouldn't know whether it's still episode three or episode five.

It isn't until Claudius enters the picture that the series begins to pick up again and get more exciting.  At this point, it's discovered that Julia has been sleeping around Rome and Augustus finds out.  While I think Brian Blessed is magnificent as Augustus, I think he's too thick, and boistrous to be the Emperor.  Augustus in reality was very thin all his life, very pretty and often prone to illness due to asthma and such.

Claudius really steals the show at this point, even as a child, with his limping and constant twitching and stuttering.  It's a bit overdone by the child actor, but as soon as Derek Jacobi comes in, he is perfect in his role.

There's really very little interest in Tiberius, despite his great acting and the emphasis on his reign, but the true impact of his terror isn't as rightly felt by anyone in the series as it is in, say, ""Caligula"" (and Peter O'Toole is far superior to George Baker as Tiberius, not to detract anything from him as an actor).  His reign of over two decades is covered in 3 or 4 episodes.

In this period, the drama starts picking up again, with Germanicus and Drusus and Nero and Livia's plotting against them, but really it's not very clearly defined.  Their whole conflict appears to be muddled in the midst of familial bickering and complaining, primarily at the hands of Tiberius's complaining about Rome and everything else.

Patrick Stewart shows up as Lucius Aelius Sejanus, and lasts two or three episodes.  His role, an important one, is quite speedily done, and much focus is placed on him rather than Tiberius in Capri, so when his death comes an episode later, it's rather sudden, and there hasn't been enough characterization of Caligula.  John Hurt just jumps into him straight into madness.

A lot of other rather big roles are either reduced to cameos, or eliminated altogether.  There is no Nerva, and Macro is not depicted as controlling Tiberius via the Praetorian Guard.

As soon as John Hurt comes in as Caligula, he completely steals the show.  His acting is stupendous, despite his presence being in only two episodes, and towards the end it starts going way too over the top.  As opposed to Malcolm McDowell's nuanced portrayal in ""Caligula"", John Hurt's Caligula is all madness, with no humanity to him.  Even his relationship with Drusilla is reduced to lunatic debauchery, with the two of them pretending to be Zeus and Hera and prancing about drunkenly in the palace.  John Hurt's acting in such scenes as his return from Britannia and showing his loot from Neptune to the Senate, and his dancing sequence before Claudius and two of the senators are marvels of acting fire.

Caligula's death is rather hastily done, and done in such a way that there's no real cohesion among the conspirators, and they sort of pull a ""Brutus and Cassius"" by panicking and running around in many different directions until they storm into Claudius's house and declare him Emperor.

A rather small issue I have is that the female actresses they use in the series range from average appearance to frightfully ugly.  This wouldn't be a problem, if it weren't for the constant mention of how beautiful they are, or what stunning beauties the Julians/Claudians produce.  And the same for the men as well.

Reaching up to Claudius's reign, Derek Jacobi seems to get lazier in his role, stuttering and twitching much less (though it probably would have been, as he ceases playing the fool), and begins to act less like the Claudius we've seen before, and more just mumbling and bumbling his way through lines, until the final episode where he begins losing in earnest.

The ending is rather long and drawn out, and seeming to be quickly rushed, as it explains to the audience, rather than show or lightly detail, how it seals up the series.  The actor playing Nero is also quite terrible, seeming to be content to frolic around stupidly looking fat and frilly without anything really important to say.

All in all, the series had great potential to be grand and encompassing, but behind the great acting and set and costumes, it was highly flawed and muddled in the beginning.  Not the greatest series I've ever seen, but not the worst.",1177113600,3,5267,4.74423710208562

Like a horde of long suppressed transvestites let loose in the Young Miss dept. in Harrods, these boys don their togas and literally go berserk. William Hurts' Caligula may be the most inspired performance I have ever seen, as he single handedly establishes that the brits actually ARE (faux) Romans, no longer rootless in the ancient world but instead the essential vessel of Civilization itself as it is born into the modern world via the glorious British Empire!

If you like good drama and intrigue, you'll love it.

759342,5,6303980813,"Is the succinct summing up of ancient Britain by ""Drusus,"" Roman General and stepson of ""Augustus Caesar,"" in what is probably the most ambitious BBC mini-series ever made, the incomparable ""I Claudius."" Spread across 13 episodes and 5 discs, ""I Claudius"" tells the story of 70 years of Roman history and the founding of the Caesarian dynasty, driven almost entirely by the vaunting ambition and twisted machinations of Caesars wife, the malevolently evil ""Livia."" Over a period of decades she plotted and maneuvered, elevating some, destroying others, as if playing a monstrous game of chess with peoples lives, `til she finally achieved her ultimate goal, the placing of her eldest son, ""Tiberius,"" on the throne of Empire. But so blinded by her ambition was she that she lost sight or ignored the consequences of some of her own actions, and was, for instance, responsible for unleashing the insanity and horror that was the reign of ""Caligula"" on the then known World!

Blackly humorous and exquisitely acted by all concerned, ""I Claudius"" will undoubtedly feel ""flat"" and ""stagey"" to audiences raised on epics such as ""The Fall of the Roman Empire,"" ""Spartacus,"" ""Ben Hur,"" ""Gladiator,"" and newer series such as ""Rome."" Indeed, most of the production does have the feel of a filmed play, and this is most noticeable in the ""crowd"" scenes, which are handled with that most venerable of stage techniques, ""noises-off."" For instance, you'll have a medium shot of Caesar and assorted dignitaries around his throne at the Coliseum, the Emperor speaks and the camera slowly zooms in, he finishes and beams at the crowd, who then roar their approval... OFF camera!

But don't let this stylistic - and budget conscious! - technique put you off, ""I Claudius"" is a monumental undertaking, the filming of Robert Graves' two-part literary masterpiece, ""I Claudius,"" and ""Claudius the God."" That the series succeeded beyond everyone's wildest dreams is down to the fundamentals; a superb story, an excellent script, and, in many cases, career best performances from the primary cast, as opposed to squillions spent on sfx. The cast of ""I Claudius"" is HUGE, with an amazing 142 actors credited on the cast page of Amazon... and don't forget that this was a BBC TV production from the late 70's, not a Hollywood epic!

The story is told by an elderly Claudius in flashback, as he writes a secret history of his family, and therefor of the Roman Empire, starting when Claudius himself was but a child and his grandfather, Augustus Caesar, is in his later years. Brian Blessed plays Caesar as a very down-to-earth character. An ex-soldier who now commands an empire, he longs for the old days of the Republic and simpler times, has scant time for all the politicking that goes with his position, and adamantly refuses to allow the Senate to declare him a God. Blessed is one of those actors who can chew the scenery with ease, but restrains his usually larger-than-life persona to give us a very human Caesar, an Emperor who is also a Man-of-the-People.

Sian Philips plays Livia, the wife of Augustus Caesar, and grandmother to Claudius, as a scheming monster who justifies her lifetime of intrigue and murder - including that of one of her own sons! - by proclaiming she was only doing what was in the best interests of Rome! A poisoner of some repute, one character says of her, only half-jokingly, ""They say a snake bit her once. And died.""

And speaking of monsters, we have John Hurt as the utterly crazed and depraved Caligula. Hurt is an incredibly versatile actor, and will be forever known to most, I'm sure, as ""Kane,"" the unsuspecting host to the ""Chest-burster"" in the original ""Alien."" In 1978 he was ""Max"" in the harrowing ""Midnight Express,"" in 1980 he was the titular ""Elephant Man,"" and you may have seen him recently as ""Chancellor Suttler"" in 2005's ""V for Vendetta!"" Hurt's Caligula is a true monster in human form; completely insane, he thinks he has metamorphosed into a God, treats people with childish spite, rewards groveling Senators with their lives or has them executed on a whim, depraved in the extreme he takes his sister as his bride, and makes his horse a Senator! Hurt throws himself into the role with complete abandon, and instead of giving us a caricature of a lunatic, what we have is a truly terrifying mad-man, unpredictable in the extreme, you never know quite what he's going to do next. Cruel, despotic, and vicious, everyone, including his uncle, Claudius, tiptoes around him as if on broken glass in their bare feet! In fact, there is one scene where, in a sudden flash of self-awareness, Caligula asks his uncle if he considers him to be mad. You can see the wheels spinning away inside Claudius' mind, he knows that the wrong answer, or even just the wrong expression on his face, could result in his torture and death, and probably the torture and death of all his friends and family as well! His answer is pure genius; Caligula can NOT be mad, because as Emperor he sets the standard for sanity in the entire World. Caligula ponders this and as he does so you see his momentary self-doubt evaporate; he's back to his old self again in no time and sends his uncle away with the cheery thought that he WAS going to kill him, but changed his mind! This is an incredibly tense scene, and a wonderful performance from both actors.

As with John Hurt's Caligula, Derek Jacobi's Claudius is a career-making performance. First seen under a huge amount of padding and ""old"" make-up as the aged and frail Emperor, Jacobi plays Claudius from his late teens/early twenties, to his death at the end of the series. Sporting a severe limp, and a stammer that is at times painful to listen to, Claudius is considered a simpleton and a fool, something that helps shield him from his grandmothers scheming, as well as an early prophesy that he would one day rule the Empire. The Roman elite took such things very seriously, and even Caligula had to stay his hand lest he anger the Gods themselves! But as well as the limping and the stammering and the drooling, Jacobi shows us the intelligence and innate goodness in his character. A scholar and historian, he, like his grandfather, longs for the old days of the Republic, but knows that the tide of history will not allow the Republic to return, at least in his lifetime.

There are many other great performances in ""I Claudius,"" including a pre-Trek Patrick Stewart - with hair! - as ""Sejanus,"" a commander of the Praetorian Guard, plotting to marry himself into the Royal Family, and even with stand-out performances from the likes of Blessed, Philips, and especially Hurt, it is Derek Jacobi's incredibly naturalistic performance as Claudius that binds the whole story together.

In our current Hi-Def, 5.1, Big Screen audiovisual world, I too, like many other reviewers, was disappointed that ""I Claudius"" wasn't given something of a spring clean to bring the picture and sound up to today's standards. It looks pretty much just the way it did when I saw it on TV back in the late 70's! But, don't let that put you off, as I said, this is superlative television, truly, one of the greats, and I would recommend it without hesitation!

And before I finish I'd like to share a little bit of trivia with you that I always enjoyed hearing Derek Jacobi tell during interviews. They had rehearsed and were filming the actor who played the young Claudius, Ashley Knight, while Jacobi was still rehearsing his own performance, and everyone said how wonderful the child actor was... and it IS a great performance! Unfortunately, it was realized too late that he was limping with the ""wrong"" foot, so Jacobi had to go back to square-one, and start his rehearsals all over again, changing HIS limp to match his younger self!",1158192000,16,7789,4.811053024645258
759343,4,6303980813,"OK - it must be admitted that this BBC production has the look and feel of a play, rather than even a low budget movie production. And so I say four stars and not five - but for the story and the acting - I'd give it ten if I could. The play like qualities, might take some getting used to for those born and bred during the Star Wars era. For my part - I soon find I am no longer paying the least bit of attention to the production shortfalls, as the story being told is totally engrossing.

I found myself wondering obsessively,can this be true? Can this actually be history? Did Little Boots (aka Caligula) really plot and perform the murder of his father, and at such a tender age? Did Livea really poison the fig tree? Did she really Poisen and plot against so many? Did she really beg her grand sons to make her a goddess, to save her self admitted evil soul, from the torments of a deserved hell? Did young Claudius really catch a torn and bleeding wolf pup out of the air? Was Messalenia really such a whore? Was Julia? Was King Herod, really such a close friend of Claudius? Was there really a Sybil - and did she really produce such a prophetic poem? And on and on. . .

When trying to research and find the answers to these questions - I can find only more writing by Robert Graves - and he says yes - it is all true. He also says Ceaser was a very randy fellow, ravaging both men and women - and that he rode a ""monster"" horse, with three toes instead of the usual single horse's hooves.  (Is that True?) Anyway - as I was explaining - the faults in the quality of the production are soon forgotten, as one becomes so absorbed in the story being told. The characters are wonderfully played, and the story really is fascinating!",1155686400,7,1739,4.200598802395209
759344,3,6303980813,"""I, Claudius* along with ""Elizabeth R"", ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII"" and Kenneth Clarke's ""Civilisation"" ranks as the apex of supreme television programming.  Save for ""Civilisation"" what makes these productions shine is not just the superlative acting and writing even by secondary level charecters but the very fact that the sets and production budgets were so sparse and elemental.  The acting and story lines are so good you don't care.  All these programs show that with a good plot, a good story and quality acting you really don't need sumptuous, big-budget sets and spectacular fx to carry the day.  Programs such as these show the paucity of the contemporary push to spend great deals of money on fx and lavish sets at the expense of storyline, acting, directing and all those other annoying things which get in the way of quality.  If your idea of high television programming is ""LaVerne and Shirley"" or ""Gilligan's Island"" this series is not for you.

  That having been said, the dvd production is indeed terrible. I do not understand what it is about BBC productions which simply refuse to provide either subtitles or closed-captioning.  When it comes to providing products which the hearing-impaired can enjoy the British rank abysmally low, if not non-existent.  I have long wanted to buy this set but the high cost combined with no subtitles or closed-captioning does not make it cost-efficient to do so at all. Further, one gets the impression that utterly no thought or care was given into the dvd transfer as it appears someone simply took a non-master tape and slapped it on to a disc without much technical forethought.  Considering that the product description states: ""Roman history comes alive in this magnificent 13-part series. ""I, Claudius"" (1976, 668 min.) ranks among the most acclaimed productions in BBC history."" one would think the dvd producers could have paid it homage in providing a decent transfer and either closed-captioning or subtitles but no they did not care to do so.  I have thought that this dvd set has been out so long that by now they would have put out a more technically astute edition with subtitles but that, considering the over-all cheapness the BBC generally uses in producing their dvds was and is expecting too much.

  That having been said, this is indeed a high moment in television programming.  Despite the above-drawbacks this series is a must-see and is compelling drama.  I can't conceive of anyone with a love of history not being enthralled by it.  But for the lack of subtitles I would have given ""I, Claudius"" five-stars as it is worthy of the highest praise",1152316800,22,2630,4.911764705882353

759385,5,6303980813,"Having first seen the telecast of this on PBS in the 70s, I can't explain why I waited so long to get the DVD version. Seeing this again after so many years I must say the acting and the screenplay has absolutely lost none of it's original punch and I enjoyed it as much as the first time. Derek Jacobi was remarkable in thie role of Claudius and the other actors are all superb. The story of the treachery and debauchery during this period of Roman history makes for some great theater. Masterpiece Theater has never topped this in my opinion although some of their other productions were outstanding. as well.

 I agree with some of the other reviewers that the transfer isn't the best and the sound quality is poor. But turning up the volume is easy enough and the rewards of watching this far outweigh the technical shortcomings of the DVD version.

Quite simply this is one of the greatest television mini-series ever aired.",1143331200,39,929,4.5843373493975905
759386,5,6303980813,"I heard about ""I, Claudius"" from the administrator I worked with when I was an undergrad.  She watched an episode every couple of days and raved about it.  Of course, back then I was too distracted by women to really comprehend what she was trying to tell me: that I, Claudius is one of the best-acted pieces of cinema history.

I, Claudius is much like HBO's Rome, only with a much lower budget.  But what it lacks in scenery and wardrobe, I Claudius makes up for with its acting.  The series is long, taking its time to tell history from the very beginning of Claudius' life through his reign as emperor and his death.  But it's in the telling that the series excels just about anything Hollywood can put out.

I, Claudius' rich history is drawn from the memories of Claudius, the club-footed, stuttering Roman Emperor.  How he came into power is a story unto itself.  But it's not Claudius that's the real show.  It's everyone else: the insanity of Caligula, the decadence of the Roman nobility, the orgies, the backstabbing, the poisoning-there's enough poison going around to fill an ocean. Through it all, Caligula observes...and survives.

What makes I, Claudius such a fantastic miniseries is the quality of its actors.  Sure, you can watch it to see young Patrick Stewart and John Rhys-Davies in their prime, but that's missing the point.  It's the actors who make this miniseries so watchable, from the husband/wife bickering of Augustus (Brian Blessed) and Livia (Sian Phillips), the weary bitterness of Tiberius (George Baker), the utter madness of Caligula (John Hurt), or Claudius himself, played with weary patience by Derek Jacobi.  This isn't just filmmaking, it's a snapshot in time of when actors actually acted.  Sometimes, the camera stays on an actor for up to 20 minutes straight, without a cutaway scene.

If there's a flaw, it's in the DVD itself.  The video footage is grainy, the audio is choppy, and more often than not you get the sense that you're watching a play rather than a miniseries.  Perhaps that's the highest compliment that can be paid to this miniseries.",1142640000,12,2095,4.837078651685394

759388,5,6303980813,"The BBC production of 'I, Claudius', now decades old, still captures the imagination, and is as fresh and timeless as when it first was broadcast. This is a testimony to the skill not only of the actors and production crew, but also to the writer (Graves) who produced what is essentially an historical novel in colloquial English which gives a real feel for the day-to-day life in the imperial family in Rome. Drawing heavily on Suetonius (the People-magazine writer of his day, far more interested in intrigue and personality than great historic events), Graves constructed a storyline that covers the major events of the advent of the Roman Empire (from out of the Roman Republic) by following the lives of the first four Emperors, primarily narrated as a 'history' written by Claudius.

The series consists of 13 one-hour episodes. They begin prior to Claudius' birth and continue through to his death. We are introduced to the men and women who were important imperial figures: Augustus, portrayed as a reluctant emperor; his wife Livia, mother of the nation, far more ambitious than any around her, and in many ways the power behind the dynasty; her sons Drusus and Tiberius, one destined to die early and the other to become emperor (the only emperor never to be deified, in fact); Agrippa, also ambitious but bumbling; Antonia, daughter of Marc Antony, and portrayed ultimately as the most honourable woman in Rome.

With this mix, the story begins of the jockeying for position within the royal family. Livia is determined that Tiberius succeed Augustus, and systematically eliminates all rivals. Whenever someone rises to prominence such that he might pose a challenge (Julia's sons, Germanicus, etc.) they are either discredited and exiled or, for safety sake, an accident or illness is arranged. After Livia is gone we see the rise and fall of Caligula, and the unlikely succession to power of Claudius. Once again intrigue enters in the form of the emperor's wife, not once, but twice, with finally Nero being favoured over Claudius' son Britannicus, who is murdered shortly after Claudius' death. Nero is the last of the Claudians, a prominent family Livia worked to hard to secure on the throne.

Perhaps the greatest scene is the dinner part in which Livia, Claudius, and Caligula are discussing prophecies and the future, at which point Livia confesses her crimes and her motivations to Claudius in hopes that he will, when emperor (a prediction he in no way believes), see to her deification.

Derek Jacobi plays Claudius (from young man to old) with great skill and care. Fortunately for Jacobi, whose career spans stage and screen as well, he has the acting ability to avoid being type-cast, but there is a tendency to default to Claudius (see the scene in the movie 'Dead Again' in which Jacobi plays a man with a stutter). Sian Phillips almost steals the show with her masterful portrayal of Livia. Her speech to the dying Augustus, explaining to him as he slips away why she was compelled to poison him, is a remarkable performance. Brian Blessed plays Augustus with skill. John Hurt, known for bizarre and eccentric performances, manages to interject the right amount of mania into Caligula.

Ultimately, Claudius did write histories and commentaries, but they have not survived. It is unknown if they did not survive due to political censorship (which I, Claudius implies) or because they simply weren't that good.

Alas, in truth, Claudius was neither as competent or caring an individual as one would believe from this re-creation. But it is fair to say that he was a good sight better than those before and after his reign. If you'll invest 13 hours in this series (and yes, it is worth it), take the time to invest a few hours in a legitimate history to find some of the historical realities that were 'glanced over lightly'.

This DVD release is specifically for those with PAL players (the standard NTSC of North America will not show these DVDs properly).",1138147200,16,3987,4.9329359165424735

There is also a documentary on the never completed epic film about Caligula starring Charles Laughton.  I have ordered this one.  Of course, you need an all region DVD player to play it.
After watching the UK DVD, I can report that it is excellent.  What a spectacular transfer.  The series is a delight to watch again.",1134172800,69,669,4.487603305785124
759390,5,6303980813,"I last saw this series on VHS 10 years ago and it was an absolutely delicious treat to see it on DVD again. I watched all 13 episodes in one sitting. Started earlier in the day and couldn't tear myself away from it.

This is a very high quality production with such high quality production and some absolutely marvelous performances. An absolute must see for anybody with any interest in quality acting, especially in an era of talentless sitcom and movie stars who command the adulation of the masses without having any artistic talent to be worthy of it.

I could not possibly do justice to the multilayered excellence of this series in a review here. I could talk for a page full, and it still wouldn't convey to you a feeling of watching this for yourself. So I shall simply say, ""see for yourself"".

I want to make just two critical observations. Firstly, the only weak performance in the series is that of Sheila White as Messelina. She overplays the twistedness of her character, a cheap soap opera like exaggerated performance of face twisting, screaming and blubbering that is quite annoying. But if I cannot say that she is bad actress, that is only to show that at its worst, the series is still very good. But, compared to the performances given by actors playing the roles of Livia, Lavilla, Julia, for instance, it IS weak. Sheila White's performance lacks the natural easy grace of the others that makes one forget that it is only an acting performance. All the other actors metamorphose into the characters they are playings so completely,  its simply marvellous.

The other comment I wanted to make was about the DVD itself. The picture quality is nothing special. Its passable but does not seem any better than what one might have seen originally on TV nearly 30 years ago. There seems to have been no effort made to do a restoration on the original material. But it's passable. What is inexcusable is the sound. Its at a very low level. Watching on a TV through its built in speakers (my home theater is in storage), the sound had to be turned up to maximum just in order to hear all the dialogue clearly. In a time when DVDs have rich sound with wide dynamic range, that exploits high technical quality to make the performances powerful and commanding, its VERY poor show that this DVD has such crappy sound. I just wonder to think that had it a broad dynamic range to where the softest whispers to loudest thunderings were reproduced and clearly and sharply heard at their respective realistic levels, the enjoyment would have been that much greater. That the studio has put this series on DVD with such indifference towards its audio/visual quality is downright disgraceful.

However, the series is so good and so pleasurable, that you must not even consider letting poor technical quality deprive you of this superb series. The loss would only be yours. If in the future the series is released again done properly, I shall buy it again. But for now, I am glad to have seen it as it was.",1134172800,11,3009,4.646616541353383

The series also stays close to historical accuracy in a way that a lot of modern ""historical"" films don't, especially those about Ancient Rome. If you're a Roman history buff who wants a good laugh at the lives of the Caesars, or just want a good laugh, you should DEFINETLY see this series.",1129593600,6,515,4.548387096774194

After all, could we envision Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt starring in something of this caliber? I think not. And I also learned more about the early Roman Empire then I ever did in history class!

There are so many outstanding actors and actresses in this production, but my favorite can only be perhaps the most underrated of his generation, John Hurt. Outlandish, disturbing, and hilarious as the same time as Caligula, I was almost sorry to see him get killed off. How is it possible that Mick Jagger has been knighted by now, but not Hurt?

The retro feel of the sets and camera work may take some getting used to in today's world of big blockbuster special effetcs, but it's also a breath of fresh air.

We immediately began the series. To this day I recall the thrill in my veins when I first heard Derek Jacobi's beautiful voice intone ""I, Tiberius Claudius Drusus Nero Germanicus, this, that, and the other..."" The series kept me spellbound through thirteen episodes. It entertains and educates by turns darkly funny, caustic, dramatic, and poignant. The acting is top notch. Derek Jacobi's complex, multilayered portrayal of the supposed idiot Claudius quickly found its way into my heart. Sian Phillips sent chills down my spine as the ambitious Livia, with a flair for poisoning. John Hurt gives a truly frightening performance as Caligula, the mad Emperor. He is involved in one of the most frightening scenes I have ever witnessed in television or film. It is not graphic, but Hurt's creepily nuanced performance gives it a real chill. There are also fine performances by Brian Blessed and Patrick Stewart,among others. It is the actors that make this period piece come alive. ""I Claudius"" is excellent viewing for history buffs, students, or anyone who enjoys fine acting. This set is well worth the money. The experiences the series creates will last a lifetime. I have many fond memories of watching the series with my father, and I know I will have many more.

759460,5,6303980813,"This one is definitely for sitting in a comfy chair with a tumbler of sipping whiskey and some casew nuts and just get engrossed!

This BBC TV drama is based on British author Robert Graves's two books about the fourth Roman Emperor, Claudius I. The historical Claudius's main claim to fame was the conquest of Britain and the construction of the port of Ostia.

The British have always felt an affinity for Claudius, since it was his effort that joined Britania to the Roman Empire, so it was obvious why Graves would chose Claudius as the main character in his book.

What makes this TV series so impressive is that Jack Pullman had basically to write a whole new story, since the books have little to no dialogue.

We shall not forget that Graves's book is fiction; Livia was not such a massmurderess in real life, and neither was Claudius always such a benevolent ruler. Then, he based his books on Tacitus and other historirians, who were aligned witht the Senatorial party and therefore had a wested interest in portraying the imperial family as negatively as possible. Neither Tiberius, nor Caligula were as insane or bad as Graves describes them.

So, how is the actual series? Just wonderful! The first few episodes take place when Augustus is Emperor, and the Empire enjoys a period of stability. However, Livia, his wife, is dead set on having her son Tiberius succeed Augustus. No one must stand in his way. Slowly but surely she removes all ""obstacles"". Claudius survives, barely, partly because he is considered harmless, and partly since there is a prophesy that he will one day save Rome.

The series gathers speed when Tiberius ascends to the throne. Old, unwilling, bitter, and corrupted he hands over the reigns to the ambitious Sejanus (played by a young Patrick Stewart, no less!). Where Livia was patient and discreet, the new powers are clumsy and brusque. The situation cannot hold and everything slowly but surely descend into bloodbath. From here on the series is possibly the bloodiest and most depraved that has ever been shown on TV, quality TV that is.

The acting is generally superb: Patrick Stewart as the scheming Sejnaus, John Hurt as the perverted and insane Caligula (at the same time funny and scary!), and Derek Jacoby as the infirm and bookish Claudius. We must remember that this is television theatre, so that the sets, while lavish, are somewhat stylistic, and the acting a bit stiff and formal. There are no outside or crowd sequences.

Production standards have probably advanced, but storytelling and acting have definitely not! For sheer powerful storytelling this series could easily run cirlces around anything that is produced today. It can be seen several times without loosing its impact.",1117843200,21,2740,4.915584415584416
759461,4,6303980813,"I have mixed feelings about this series. I didn't purchase a boxed set but recently collected the series in 13 separate episodes as an extra from a leading Greek daily newspaper. With the initial episode disc the paper had a special glossy four-page supplement describing the historical setting and the main dramatis personae as well as a very useful imperial family chart. This made up for the lack of supplementary disc material. The quality was excellent with no signs of ghosting, it could have been shot in 2000,the colour definition was so good. Sound quality was also good. Unfortunately I couldn't get rid of the Greek subtitles ,which happily were in relatively small type but still annoying.

I read the two-volume Robert Graves novel in the paperback Penguin classic series about twenty years ago. The book had its dull moment as well as the series. I agree the acting was superb with some of Britain's finest, especially the villainess Livia, wife of Caesar Augustus and grandmother of Claudius. even the numerous child actors and actresses performed very well indeed. I suppose my only snide comment on the other wise brilliant acting is that ancient Romans are portrayed as middle-class Brits where even Caesar Augustus has a home counties accent.

While the studio sets are lavish and convincing it is seemingly a low budget production. In the TV series not once do you see a Roman mounted on a horse or even an ass. Even crowds at the arena are only hinted at by their noise. This is a pity because some epic action is described in the book such as the massacre of Varo's legions in the forests of barbaric Germany. I hope that somebody, maybe Peter Jackson or a director with similar skills, decides to produce an updated theatre version bringing in some of the action described in the book but missing from the series. Nevertheless, anyone with an interest in Roman history at a critical point in time will enjoy this aging series and eve the great unwashed who relished the TV series , ""The Sopranos"", may understand what is going on, although they may be confused about who is who and who is related to whom.",1117065600,,2128,4.764227642276423
759462,5,6303980813,"A classic TV production from the BBC, ""I, Claudius"" based on Robert Graves novels first appeared in 1976. Derek Jacobi appears as Claudius who ascends to power in Rome through the treachery of Livia (Sian Phillips)the scheming wife of Augustus (Brian Blessed). The top notch cast, script by writer Jack Pulman and direction by Herbert Wise make this one of the finest and most memorable productions aired during the 70's.

The transfer looks fine but the source videotape is nearly 30 years old. The videotape has faded significantly with age and Image and Fox used the best available source tape that they had the rights to for this production. The mono sound is muffled and probably should have been cleaned up and the signal boosted but, overall, the quality of the DVDs are actually pretty good (by comparsion take a look at the 80's version of ""The Twilight Zone"" which had an even worse original source tape). I actually don't feel as if the image quality deserves 1 star although it could have been improved along with sound. Each DVD has three episodes of the series. I can't compare it to the UK re-release for image quality but keep in mind that there's only so much restoration that can be done to videotape this old. Unfortunately, the BBC didn't have the budget to shoot the series on film.

The last disc includes a 71 minute documentary produced in 1965 about the ill fated production of ""I Claudius"" that producer Alexander Korda started (with Josef Von Sternberg at the helm as director)in 1937. The beautiful production design for the unfinished film isevident in every frame. There's a significant amount of footage that survived (and that Von Sternberg cut as he was shooting the film)and that's presented. Charles Laughton's performance has its moments but it's clear he didn't quite have a handle on the role. Reportedly, he had a number of tandrums during production and Korda used the car accident of Merle Oberon as an excuse to cancel the film despite the large sum of money already spent on the film. What's really fun about the footage is that it's not as fragmentary as one would suspect. Hosted and narrated by the late Dirk Bogarde and featuring interviews surviving cast & crew, it's a fascinating glimpse behind the scenes of what could have been a classic film if not for the misfortunes of the production.

Despite the minor drawbacks of the source videotape, this production is worthwhile to view. It's a pity that we don't have more extras with this set but what we do get is magnificent.",1114992000,15,2525,4.786697247706422
759518,5,6303980813,"Think history is boring? Think again! I Claudius is proof that an educational film can also be one of the most popular and entertaining series ever produced. A 1976 mini-series, starring many of the best known theatrical performers of its day, I Claudius is one of, if not the, greatest productions chronicling the history of the Roman Empire. Covering the period from the later years of Augustus's rule as the first emperor of Rome to the death of Emperor Claudius, I Claudius takes a look at the social and political underpinnings and developments of the Roman Empire through the eyes of Claudius, an often overlooked member of the emperor's family. An epic in the true sense of the word, I Claudius should be on every film buff's viewing list...

A young male connected to the family line of Emperor Augustus, Claudius suffers from a strange limp and an odd stutter which make him appear to be a simple-minded youth. But Claudius maintains a keen intellect, and he observes the events around him with meticulous precision. As the end of Augustus's long reign as emperor nears its end, the ruler is in desperate search of an heir. But what he doesn't know is that his wife Livia is determined to see her son from a previous marriage, Tiberius, ascend to the throne. As such, Livia will stop at nothing to murder and ruin those who stand in the way - such as far more noble and deserving heir Germanicus. Through drowning, poisoning, and less subtle means, she insures Tiberius becomes the next in the line of succession...

Meanwhile, Claudius observes from the shadows as the ambitious Sejanus (Patrick Stewart) conspires to obtain the throne and the infamous Caligula rises to power. When his relative is murdered because of his terrible reign of insanity, Claudius is thrust upon the throne, and he attempts to rule with a firm hand of justice and restore the republic to its rightful place of power...

Wrought with suspense, I Claudius will make its viewers question how any human survived the era known as the ancient Roman Empire. The murders, double-crossings, and various affairs seem to be drawn from a fictional paperback found on drugstore shelves - not in the pages of a history book. But I Claudius stays true to the written account of Roman Emperor Claudius who wrote his memoirs during the few years of his reign as the supreme leader of the greatest empire ever to exist on Earth. The result is a story more intriguing than any book or film since produced...

With superb theatrical performances by the entire cast (including Patrick Stewart as Sejanus), I Claudius is an engrossing storyline about the true-to-life people and events that shaped the history of ancient Rome. Like the popular prime-time soap opera Dallas, viewers are drawn to the intrigue surrounding the various characters without even realizing they're learning history in the process! Given its historical accuracy, brilliant dialogue, and ingenious performances, I Claudius ranks as a definite must-see series of films. In fact, one of the top five best of all time...

759519,5,6303980813,"I am sorry that I am repeating a title for this review that someone else used, but I like it so much.  This is one of the very finest series ever made for television.  Some people feel that the lack of music detracts from it, but I feel it makes the acting seem more intense, since no one except the actor is manipulating your feelings as you watch it. It also creates a more somber mood than I find in other programs that do have a musical track. Some people feel the sets are too limited, but I feel they are beautiful and sumptuous, and they again add to the intensity of what we are seeing.  The costumes, like in all the 1970's BBC historical dramas are beautiful as well.

As for the actors, frankly my two favorites are Brian Blessed as Augustus and (no surprise) John Hurt as Caligula (Derek Jacobi is great also, but I am attracted to the others more).  Blessed plays Augustus as a basically well-meaning, genial man, almost making us forget that he was the most powerful man in the Western World and he rubbed out a lot of people on the way to the top.  John Hurt is  effeminate, rapacious and cruel all at the same time.

Although Robert Graves wrote the books in the 1920's, his political message is quite relevant today.  He points out how a generation of seemingly idealistic, family-oriented, heroic figures such as Drusus, Germanicus, Livia's first husband, and even Augustus give way to corrupt, degenerate rulers, with the acceptance of the people.  The Romans, who at one time had a republic and an abhorrence of hereditary monarchy, voluntarily give up their freedom and become indifferent to the debaucheries of their rulers.  Sounds something like the bureaucratic dictatorship of the European Union which is taking away more and more freedoms from the people, and like a couple of Presidents of the US in fairly recent history who turned the White House in to a brothel.

My favorite scene is the one where Claudius and his mother Antonio give gladiatorial games in memory of Drusus.  Here we see the bloody, barbaric side of so-called  Roman ""civilization"" as Claudius' sister Livilla, dressed as a genteel Roman matron, is screaming to one of the gladiators ""kill him!, kill him!"". There is the unforgettable scene just before the games where Livia is addressing the gladiators ""You're all scum and you know it!"" and she tells them something to the effect ""these games are being degraded by the use deceptive techniques in order to stay alive!""

The first four discs contain three episodes each (the first episode is double the length of the subsequent eleven). You have the option of playing it all the way through, of selecting a particular episode or a particular scene - each episode has eight scenes, except the first which has twelve. The picture and sound quality are excellent and the production is completely intact in its entirety. The opening and closing credits for each episode are included as is the 'Caligula/Drusilla' scene at the end of episode eight. That scene was never actually omitted in the UK.

The fifth disc offers a wealth of extras. There is the seventy minute documentary 'THE EPIC THAT NEVER WAS', narated by Dirk Bogarde, and featuring interviews with Merle Oberon (Messalina), Flora Robson (Livia) and Emlyn Williams (Caligula), as well as all the remaining material of the aborted film. There is also a second seventy minute documentary entitled 'I CLAUDIUS - A TELEVISION EPIC'. This features interviews with Derek Jacobi (Claudius), Sian Phillips (Livia), John Hurt (Caligula), Brian Blessed (Augustus), George Baker (Tiberius), Margaret Tyzack (Antonia), Christopher Biggins (Nero) and the director Herbert Wise, as well as many great clips from the programme. There is then a bit where the seven actors I have just listed and the director select their favourite scenes that they worked on (Herbert Wise selects two) and then we get another chance to see the particular scenes. Then we have archive footage of the award ceremonies where Sian Phillips received the 1977 BAFTA Award for Best Actress, Derek Jacobi received the 1977 BAFTA Award for Best Actor and the 1977 Variety Club Award for Best Actor. When 'I Claudius' was first made, it was originally going to be thirteen fifty minute episodes, but for some reason it was transmitted as  twelve, with the first episode being twice as long. Here we get a chance to see the original ending of episode one and opening of episode two. Finally there is a very helpful family tree.

I do hope you now have all the information you wanted MacGuffin and I would seriously advise that you invest in a multi-region DVD player and buy this set. I bought a multi-region DVD player for just 50 on amazon.co.uk and it works perfectly.

I would seriously reccommend this drama serial to anyone who is interested in history or simply appreciates great acting and quality entertainment. It is superbly written by Jack Pulman, expertly directed by Herbert Wise and magnificently acted by the entire cast, especially Jacobi, Phillips, Hurt and Blessed.

One to keep beside Brideshead Revisited (GRANADA TV 1981), Pride and Prejudice (BBC TV 1995), The Jewel In The Crown (GRANADA TV 1984), The Singing Detective (BBC TV 1986) and War & Peace (BBC TV 1972).",1107475200,17,2937,4.913306451612903
759521,5,6303980813,"I was originally forced to watch I, Claudius as part of a high-school Latin class. Let it suffice to say that the viewing had the desired effect. It ratcheted up my enthusiasm for Latin and classical history in general to the point where I ended up studying it at the university level. Having read both books, I, Claudius and Claudius the God by Robert Graves, this is one instance where I actually felt the film version was better than the literary one.

The series is exceptionally well done. The acting is simply superb and the viewer will notice many familiar faces parade across the screen--including a great performance by Patrick Stewart (of later Star Trek fame) as Aelius Sejanus, the right-hand-man of the emperor Tiberius. John Hurt was *the* Caligula for the ages.

The series produced dozens of memorable lines that immediately entered my lexicon and have remained even years later including:

""You've become a god!""

""Is there anyone in Rome who has not slept with my daughter?!""

""I have survived with half my wits, while others have died with all of theirs intact. Evidently, quality of wits is more important than quantity.""

""My body is full of maggots...""

""You knew I was at war with Neptune. How dare you ride with him!""

""What makes you think a filthy, smelly old woman like you could become a goddess?""

The list goes on endlessly. If you are someone who enjoys classical Greco-Roman history, owning a copy of I, Claudius is mandatory. If you don't, you should watch it anyway. I have forced several family members and friends who had no interest in the subject to watch the series, and to a person, they all got a tremendous kick out of it.

Derek Jacobi is excellent as the meek, stuttering Claudius who lives through the reigns of 3 emperors while all those around him are either murdered or meet mysterious deaths.  After his evil nephew Caligula is murdered, Claudius is pulled out of hiding by the Praetorian Guards and made the emperor.

Seeing it as a chance to restore the republic to Rome, Claudius rules wisely paving the way for the evil Nero to follow him.

Sean Phillips is excellent as Livia, the wife of Augustus Ceaser, who will poison anyone that stands in the way of her son becoming emperor.  John Hurt is phenomenal as Caligula and look for Patrick Stewart as the evil Sejanus!",1106524800,7,785,4.700729927007299
759523,4,6303980813,"""...they're excreted."" So wrote Cicero, who was in a position to know (and who lost his head and hands for saying so). This assertion is vividly confirmed in this oh-so-British adaptation of Robert Graves's fact-based novels detailing the intrigues of the Julio-Claudian Dynasty, which was introduced weekly by the peerless Alistair Cooke. I, Claudius premiered here in the States on PBS, courtesy of Masterpiece Theater, courtesy of Mobil (the sponsor). Like so many others, I was riveted to my TV set every Sunday evening for months, eagerly awaiting the notes of Mouret's Rondeau which heralded the next installment of a saga that somehow managed to unravel the complicated ties that bound these characters in a tangled web of family and intrigue. I'm quite certain there's nothing else quite like it, and might never be again. And while I'd hasten to mention that on one hand, it's not for everyone--being a history buff is certainly a help, and one needs a solid attention span--on the other hand, viewers of virtually any background can enjoy this for exactly what it is, i.e., there are no oblique cultural references targeting those of a particular age/background.
I borrowed a friend's copy of this set and almost swallowed it whole, having not seen it since its PBS premiere so many years ago. It was as wonderful as I remembered and therein lies my complaint: a production of this stature merits much better treatment than has been accorded it by Fox/Image. For starters, no effort was made to clean up the print used. Granted, I, Claudius was taped, and so can never look as good as a filmed production but still...a little respect is in order. This print is okay, as is the sound (which isn't as bad as claimed by previous reviewers). The lion's share of the episodes are on two ""flipper"" disks, three episodes per side, and the last plus an interesting documentary on what would have been Alexander Korda's production of I, Claudius share a single side of a third disk.
And that's IT.
There's a paucity of printed material (a single insert is included with the first disk), no ""making of"" documentary, no commentary or interviews, and the menus are primitive by today's standards--bare-bones, non-interactive, automatically running straight through the episodes unless manually stopped. In addition, the enjoyment of all the vintage Masterpiece Theatre presentations could be increased even more if Alastair Cooke's introductions and concluding remarks were included; I felt this absence keenly while viewing the Lillie set which I was lucky to find recently at a great price. I, Claudius is in a class of its own and deserves champagne treatment; such a high list price for so pedestrian a presentation is insulting.
Research discloses that Amazon.uk offers a newer set released by Granada that seems more comprehensive than this one: it contains five disks and includes interviews with the actors, presumably more printed material, deleted scenes (maybe the infamous Caligula/Drusilla scene that was censored for US broadcast?), and possibly the Korda documentary as well; unfortunately, the British reviewers so far aren't forthcoming about the set's technical de/merits. I'd suggest that those with multi-region DVD players investigate that set; the rest of us will just have to hope that the series is reissued here with the respect it deserves.
Update: ""Thank you"" to LUC for his helpful review of 2/4/05; I hope to be adding the Granada release to my collection soon. And to a 5/14/06 reviewer who complains about other reviewers' including criteria other than performance, e.g., print quality in their evaluations, may I point out that I for one am capable of making up my own mind about a performance (although I'm interested in what others have to say)--chances are excellent that I can catch whatever's being reviewed on TV. I'm only interested in reviews that tell me about the quality of what I'm considering PURCHASING, i.e., THIS RELEASE, and that includes restoration, extras, packaging, etc. I doubt I'm unique, and I'll continue to review for my own pleasure and hope that in the process I can help prospective purchasers like myself make educated decisions just as others have helped me.",1104451200,13,4220,5.090909090909091
759524,5,6303980813,"The first thing you will need before watching ""I, Claudius""? A very comfortable chair that you can sit in for extended periods of time. That's because this monumental British miniseries based on Robert Graves's novel of the same name clocks in at a jaw dropping 650 minutes. Yes, 650 minutes! Roughly eleven hours of good old-fashioned corruption, murder, betrayal, adultery, and insanity set in the earliest years of the Roman Empire. No one knew how to mix it up like the Julio-Claudians, that's for sure. Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero each took turns ruling an empire the size and shape of which staggers the imagination. Unfortunately, the absolute control these men exercised over millions of subjects often failed to carry over to their rowdy personal and family life. ""I, Claudius"" deals in depth with the latter. You'll never see huge military campaigns involving legions conquering new lands in this movie, nor will you witness Roman statesmen involved in the day to day affairs of empire building and ruling. There are hints at the wider political picture, of course, but the film focuses deeply on the personal power struggles taking place inside the ruling family. You'll quickly wonder how these people could rule anything, let alone an empire, after just the first episode.

It's absolutely impossible to sum up eleven hours of some of the best television you will ever see in a short review. ""I, Claudius"" is too complex to describe beyond mere superficialities. The film is divided into episodes, each of which begins with an aging, half dying Emperor Claudius (Derek Jacobi) sitting down to write the lengthy history of his family. It's not as easy as it sounds; his wicked wife Agrippina and scheming heir Nero always wish to know what the emperor is up to in his private quarters, thus forcing Claudius to hide his manuscript from prying eyes. He begins his story during the reign of Augustus (Brian Blessed), documenting the scandalous behavior practiced by the emperor's wife Livia (Sian Phillips), who enacts several murder plots in an effort to secure her son Tiberius (George Baker) the title of official heir. No one is safe from the machinations of Livia save the youthful Claudius. His physical infirmities, including a terrible stutter and uncontrollable twitching, convince the rest of the family that he is an irredeemable idiot who poses no threat in the constant race to succession. He is far from stupid, however. Claudius soon learns to exaggerate his physical failings whenever he senses danger. And there is great danger everywhere as members of the family perish at an alarming rate.

Augustus's reign is relatively benign compared to the brutal excesses of Tiberius, and a laugh riot of epic proportions when placed side by side with the brief tenure of Caligula (John Hurt). Claudius's pen recalls the catastrophic results of Tiberius's elevation of a minor official named Sejanus (Patrick Stewart) to the heights of power, the sham trials in the Senate of anyone thought to pose a threat to the emperor, and the gradual ascendancy of Caligula to the position of successor. As interesting as the reign of Tiberius is, it pales in comparison to his successor. Caligula is, for lack of a better term, as mad as a hatter. He soon comes to believe he is a living god, carves up his sister Drusilla, and dresses up as a woman in order to perform a sensual dance for his Uncle Claudius. Caligula's years on the throne are a time of unmatched cruelty, brutality, and senseless murder. The Senate cowers in fear as the emperor prances and capers about Rome, forcing the wives of the wealthy and renown to work in a brothel set up in the palace. By the time Claudius assumes the throne upon the assassination of this lunatic, the problems of ruling Rome seem relatively mundane. The emperor must deal with corrupt officials, his licentious wife Messalina, and the threat of palace coups. It sounds bad, but it's better than kneeling in front of a madman waiting for sudden death.

The above two paragraphs provide only a wide angle view of ""I, Claudius."" The subplots number in the dozens, and often stretch across several episodes. But the story never loses focus and never confuses despite the dozens of major and minor characters involved. Not a single member of the huge cast turns in a bad performance, and several do such an amazing job that they deserve special mention. I think Sian Phillips is the 400-pound gorilla stomping through most of ""I, Claudius."" Her portrayal of the malevolent Livia takes your breath away. She gets nearly all of the best lines, her hateful gazes could melt steel, and she's also an extremely attractive woman. It's almost a pity when her character finally passes away--almost. Fortunately, John Hurt steps in to fill the void as the deranged Caligula. We've all seen Hurt play crazy in other films, but it all started here. His lunatic giggling coupled with the completely outrageous statements he delivers with complete sincerity leave the viewer spellbound. This is craziness on a metaphysical level, a frightening insanity that shocks the soul and delivers big scares.

The only problems I saw in ""I, Claudius"" are two in number. First, the picture quality isn't up to DVD standards. I don't know if this is due to the age of the presentation or the transfer, but expect a hazy, washed out picture. Second, pretty much every member of the cast sports a British accent, which makes sense considering the BBC produced the project. Most of the time this isn't a problem until you look at Frances White, the actress playing Augustus's daughter Julia. Her accent is so piercing that it hurts your ears. Despite these minor issues, ""I, Claudius"" is must see television that even those unfamiliar with the intricacies of Roman history should love.",1102723200,6,5830,4.9459183673469385
759525,4,6303980813,"This series was shot on elaborate soundstages within echoing halls and extravagant attention to detail...but it still looks incredibly fake.  I actually had a hard time caring about the characters for nearly all of disc one(there are a total of five discs in the set), mainly because of the distracting plasticity of their surroundings.  I soon began to ignore this negative aspect and found myself becoming absolutely enthralled with the great adapted teleplay from the Robert Graves' novels and some excellent character acting from a very large cast of admirable actors.  In fact, I first saw many of these actors in the 1989 film version of ""Henry V"" directed by Kenneth Branagh.  There are many notable performances here, the most notable coming from Derek Jacobi as Claudius and the incredibly malleable John Hurt who plays Caligula in an unnerving performance that is both disturbing and hilarious(often both at the same time).  But the biggest star here is the script, which is both intelligent and informative in an historical sense.  By the end of the series, however, there have been so many diabolical schemes along the way that the story becomes predictable through repetition of characters vying for power.  It becomes more a question of ""Who is going to poison who next?"" rather than being shocked by it all.  Overall, this is a well made, well acted, superbly written series worth owning.  I should mention that there are some bloody scenes and occasional nudity/sexual situations that make this series clearly adult entertainment.  Enjoy...and when in Rome, be sure to prepare your own meals!",1095206400,6,1608,5.103053435114504
759526,5,6303980813,"A great adaptation of Robert Grave's fictional work. All of the actors render a stunning and convincing portrayal of what life was like at the core of the early Roman empire.

 Derek Jakobi brilliantly performs the character of Claudius as he ponders his life and impresses his thoughts on to his ""autobiography."" The audience is then taken through the ambitions and intrigues of the Julio-Claudian dynasty from the reign of Augustus to Nero's. Through the eyes of Claudius, the audience has a bird's eye view into the dynastic contests played with wit and humor; seeing the evolution of the empire from the remnants of a crumbled republic to a sophisticated imperial beuraucracy that is protected by the notorious praetorian guard. With this insight, Claudius is soon appreciated by the audience as having a keen intellect as opposed to being dull and slow of wit (Claudius addressing the Senate: ""Many have called me half-witted and yet they lost their heads with all their wit while I still have mine.  I suppose then that quality of wit is more important than quantity!"") His desire for truth and his loathing of the imperial struggle gives his story clarity and impartiality. All of the characters are brilliantly played; their actions and motivations all come to light in the course of the mini-series.

 The acting of Derek Jacobi as Claudius is brilliant. The same goes for Brian Blessed and Sian Phillips as Augustus and Livia. There's even a brief appearance by Patrick Stewart. John Hurt's performance as the sociopathic Caligula is undoubtedly the best one ever presented on screen. The only downside is that the screenplay was prepared on purely British aesthetics as opposed to precise historical accuracy.  The characters are much too stiff in their postures and mannerisms to pass off as Romans who were similar to their Italian descendents in overall behavior and expression.  At one point Brian Blessed as Augustus whistles something akin to a modern beat and style that could not possibly fall within the aesthetics of musical composition prevalent during that period.  The characters therefore come across more as English Victorian aristocrats than anything else.  Some of the historical aspects are also incorrect such as the characters feasting on watermelons which would be extremely unlikely to impossible since the crop is from the Americas and was brought to Europe more than 1500 years after the end of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.

This presentation has a full cast of some of the finest Shakespearean actors in recent memory and their acting more than makes up for limitations of this 1974 production.  For audiences looking for action or special effects, there isn't much to find here; this is a theatrical adaptation and so the sound and stage have their limitations. This is not an action story anyway; if you're looking for that kind of film see ""Spartactus"", ""Cleopatra"", or ""Gladiator."" Despite its limitations, this is a fine BBC production of one of the greatest works in historical fiction. A must see for anyone who enjoys history or just a good story full of intrigue and suspense.",1091491200,10,3120,5.0623781676413255
759527,5,6303980813,"The `I, Claudius' TV production which first appeared on PBS' `Masterpiece Theatre' over thirty years ago was at that time and still is considered a high water mark in public television serial drama. I believe it thoroughly displaced the stodgy `Upstairs, Downstairs' and was almost but not quite displaced on its high throne by the production of `Brideshead Revisited'. What is so distinguished about `I, Claudius' from `Brideshead' with its luminary roster of A list actors such as Claire Bloom, John Gielgud, and Laurence Olivier is that it achieves its quality with largely B list character actors. Almost every actor in the cast has not yet hit their stride, as with Patrick Stewart (with hair) and lead actor Derek Jacobi or, like Sian Phillips and John Hurt, they are at or past their prime as character actors.

The story is taken directly from two novels written by English poet and scholar of antiquities, Robert Graves, on whose knee I learned of the Greek myths from his very authoritative Penguin Classics published two volume work which is more accessible than the Golden Bough and much more authoritative than Edith Hamilton's tired old work. Graves' novel is based on the history and rumors reported in Seutonious' `Lives of the Twelve Caesars', plus a rather sizable amount of poetic license with history.

Claudius is the fourth Emperor of Rome, a nephew of Tiberius, the second emperor and uncle to Caligula, the third emperor, who ascends to the throne after senators assassinate Caligula and his family. But, for most of the story, Claudius is merely a narrator of the real action, which he discovers in his role as a historian. The driving force of the first half of the thirteen part series is the effort of Livia, Caesar Augustus' wife, to replace Augustus' natural offspring by daughter Julia with her own son Tiberius as Augustus' successor as emperor of Rome. She does this by murdering everyone in her way, up to and including Augustus, himself. Suetonious just hints at much of this, so the historical basis of this plot is a bit shaky, but it makes a rootin, tootin good story. The second half of the series is taken up by the corruption of Tiberius term, the insanity of Caligula's term, and the hopeful, but tragicly flawed rule of Claudius, himself.

Graves' conceit, which the telescript maintains, is that the whole story was written by Claudius and hidden away and forgotten for 2000 years, to be discovered and translated by the humble author.

Part of the great power of the story is the juxtaposition of such great figures of history as the early Roman emperors with some of the most tragic and most sordid human acts and emotions. This tone is struck perfectly when Tiberius and Caligula stand over the just dead body of Augustus and Tiberius says `... and the earth shakes with his passing...'. The irony is that Augustus was just murdered in order that Tiberius may become emperor. A similar moment comes when Augustus is interviewing a lineup of about forty noble Romans to ask them whether they had slept with Julia. To a man, they all confess to having relations with the daughter, albeit not all `in bed'. Julia did have her taste for the unusual. The climax is a heart rending scene which shows Augustus' pain at Julia's being exiled from Rome.

A small but impressive task for both the actors and the makeup crew was the aging of many of the actors to span over forty years of age, taking Claudius from a teenager to his late fifties and Livia from her forties to her eighties. This was relatively easy with Brian Blessed and George Baker who begin the story in early middle age, but it seems devilishly difficult with John Hurt who appears to be in the dissolute forties even when he is pictured as a young man.

The greatest praise for acting must go to Jacobi, but Brian Blessed's performance as Augustus, dominating the action in the first five episodes, really made me wonder where he has been all this time. I must assume from the few other appearances I have seen of him that he is primarily an English Shakespearean actor who only occasionally shows up in small supporting roles on film. Sian Phillips, playing the most important character next to Claudius, is much better known in a variety of character roles, many Shakespearian.

While the film lacks `Brideshead's high intensity cast, it also lacks `Brideshead's lush scenery and settings. No modern locations could quite match Imperial Rome, so everything is done in a competant, but ordinary setting. Where `I, Claudius' does not suffer in comparison to `Brideshead' is in the writing behind the screenplay. Graves may not have all the depth of psychological plotting, but his picture of characters motives, passions, and ambitions is simply terrific.

759620,5,6303980813,"""I, Claudius"" is, quite simply, a masterpiece of acting, of writing, and of what television can do like no other medium.
Clocking in at eleven hours, ""I, Claudius"" rips the curtain back from Imperial Rome and shows the savagery, the venality, the evil, and yes, the goodness at work in the court during the early days of Imperial Rome.  Tracking a story over several decades, ""I, Claudius"" tells an epic story of murder, deceit, seduction, and justice that is simultaneously grand and intimate -- the story is simply too grand a scale to be made into a feature film (well, with the caveat that if Peter Jackson can film the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, he can film any epic out there).
Narrated by an aged Emperor Claudius (Derek Jacobi, in a career-making performance), ""I, Claudius"" starts with the reign of Caesar Augustus (Brian Blessed, delightfully Machiavellian) and his vicious wife, Livia (Sian Phillips, almost stealing the show).  Augustus, reluctant to drive a stake through the heart of the Roman Republic, nevertheless seeks to consolidate his power; Livia is fully committed to burying the Republic forever and seating her reluctant son, Tiberius (George Baker) on the throne.  Through seduction, wily craft, and generous doses of poison, Livia gets her way.  Her parting scene with Augustus is a masterpiece of acting on both sides.
As an aside, the acting in ""I, Claudius"" more than makes up for an obviously limited budget and virtually no special effects . . . it's like watching a televised play.  On-screen violence is nevertheless convincing, and the entire cast hits each precious note with skill.  Watch for a young, bewigged(!) Patrick Stewart as the ambitious Sejanus, John Hurt as the deranged Caligula, and John Rhys-Davies as Marcro, Sejanus' second-in-command.
Claudius, born lame with both a twitch and a stutter (""That boy could destroy the Empire just by strolling through it!""), is nevertheless prophesied to save Rome from her bloody fate.  As his older, wiser friends repeatedly tell him (usually just before their own murder), Claudius should play up his disabilities in order to stay alive.  Which Claudius does, and as an amateur historian he chronicles the lives (and deaths) of so many noble Romans.
Tiberius succeeds Augustus (thanks in large part to Livia's gift with poisons), and as he falls into depths of depravity, Sejanus makes his play for the throne.  Caligula inherits the throne from Tiberius, although not as smoothly as he would have liked, and he shows the truth in the absolute corruption brought about by absolute power.  Claudius, staunch Republican that he is, nevertheless finds himself on the Imperial throne, a captive of the Praetorian Guard, following Caligula's untimely end.  He works to restore the Republic, but such is not to be, and ultimately Nero ascends to the throne.
But on the way, Claudius spins one heck of a tale.  Far from the magisterial views of Imperial Rome so often shown in films, ""I, Claudius"" thrusts us into the courtrooms and bedrooms of the Roman nobility, and it's a captivating, but often ugly, sight.",1087776000,7,3095,5.035225048923679

If you like British historical drama of outstanding quality or just Roman history, this is a set you ought to buy. The acting and script are spellbinding. I have watched all of the 5 DVD's in three days, which was sth of a marathon watch. There are no weak spots in the acting and it is fun watching a young 'captain Picard' (yes I also love to watch Star trek). The sets are old-fashioned and nothing like the sets of, for instance, productions like Elizabeth.
But who cares about sets and the like if the acting is so good. The whole series breathes 'theatre' and I love it. It brings back the stories from Latin classes in High school. The Gods, Augustus, the Roman empire and all the Roman stories come to life, as seen through the eyes of Claudius. They are living and breathing (and very fascinating) people.

This DVD release surely is no worse. The source material was perhaps softened a bit too much to lessen video noise on the original. In other words, the focus looks a bit soft. Other than that, there is nothing wrong with the picture quality.

The only way I watch mine is to view it on a computer and make the image so small I can't see the imperfections. It's a lot like the old Video CD, where two hour movies were crammed on two standard CDs.
If they did a better job on the transfer, I'd buy the series again. I'm not getting rid of mine because it's the only thing available. I do, however, expect more from my money than a production that looks like a poorly pirated copy.

I can only imagine what this ""in-studio"" production could have been if made today (with equal actors and direction) with a multimillion dollar budget and directed by Peter Jackson.
Claudius is played by Derek Jacobi of Cadfael fame.
A dashing Patrick Stewart of Star Trek fame has a small but impressive part as advisor to Tiberius.
The ""unknown"" Christoper Guard has a small role - he was the voice of Frodo in the Lord of the Rings (78)
The first Roman emporer of Rome Augustus is played by Bian Blessed (Prince Vultan in Flash Gordon-1980)
Just when you believe that the mass-murdering wife of Augustus is the main ""villian"", here comes John Hurt as Caligula. (Hurt has starred in Harry Potter, the Elephant Man, the voice of Aragon in Lord of the Rings (78), and he played Quentin CRISP of The Naked Civl Servant (off subject, one of CRISP's lines: ""When I was coming to America, I went to the American Embassy and the man asked me 'Are you a practicing homosexual?' And I said I didn't practice. I was already perfect."").
WARNING: What most reviewers don't warn you about is that in I, Claudius Hurt is at the center one of the most brutal scenes in cinematic history. I won't give a spoiler, but you've been warned. By the way, the scene is done with restraint and is integral to the plot, making it both brutal and satisfying--from a cinematic standpoint anyway. Personlly, I'd like to forget I witnessed it. I cringe at the thought of how Quentin Tarantino would abuse us should he remake this classic.

The acting by just about everyone is superlative with the possible reservation that all the acting is more British than Roman. Derek Jacobi,Sian Phillips, John Hurt, Patrick Stewart, etc give excellent performances. The script is also excellent. It is too bad that Masterpiece Theatre, The Forsyte Saga and other great adaptations of classic novels that were made in the 1970s for the BBC, such as the adaptation of Balzac's Cousin Bette and Dostoyevsky's The Possessed are no longer available to be seen as far as I know.

In Rome, everybody has a cool sounding name. Germanicus, how cool is that? Tiberius. SEJANUS! How could I forget Sejanus? (And I nearly did.) You can have a receding hairline and still be cool if you're called Sejanus. Knowing my luck, I would have the only uncool name in the entire empire, like Balbus or something. Also, you can walk around in very cool designer outfits like the toga. Everyday you get out of bed and you're someone cool like David Bowie. In fact, even cooler as the red stripe goes right down your body. How cool is that? Would get pretty drafty if you wore it in Britain, though. Come to think of it, the Romans did visit during the series. Mind you, wearing a skirt never troubled the Scots. They were only troubled by the British who kept defeating them. Alright, so we gave them Bannockburn. We were in a generous mood. Anyway, it's alright to wear a toga in Rome because of the hot studio lights. Which is probably why they keep stripping off and having orgies. I went to an orgy in Stepney once and it was nothing like that. No bountiful fruit, just some dull salad. I made my excuses and left, as they say.
Caligula gets fitted up in this series. In truth, he didn't insist that that guy really carry out his own suicide in his honour, he chucked him in the river for being obsequious and soon fetched him out again. Don't let the buggers grind you down, mate. Also, the scriptwriter was a bit sloppy in having you invite Marcus to a private dance after you had told him you weren't his friend, just to shorthand a conspiracy plot. If you were Caesar and confronted by a dodgy scriptwriter you could say ""take him away and shove his head on a pole, har har ha!"" Caesur is also a very cool sounding name, not to mention frighteningly easy to misspell. You can't walk around going har har ha nowadays. They won't let you.

In spite of the limited sets and obviously low budget this series is compulsive viewing thanks to its superb casting and its compelling storyline.

Sir Derek Jacobi leads a star cast and is so believable as the stammering, twitching Claudius who stays alive, while many around him are murdered, by letting everyone believe he is a witless fool. Brian Blessed plays the emperor Augustus, Patrick Stewart is Sejanus...crafty and ambitious and John Hurt plays the insane Caligula. The production, taken from Robert Grave's novels, follows the Roman Imperial family from the time of Augustus through to the reign of Nero.

The DVD of this production is excellent, the colours have never looked so vibrant, dialogue is so clear and subtitles are available for the hard of hearing....a bonus that wasn't available when first aired.

If you love a fantastic story, with some of the most fascinating characters ever to hit the small screen, then do yourself a favour and buy this DVD.  Nothing matches it.
The story follows the ancient Emperor Claudius's memoirs about his highly disfunctional family through the years from his birth to his near death.  This is the time of the Emperors Augustus, Tiberius and Caligula - intense, brutal and treacherous, and yet at times genuinely funny and very sad.  The sets seem primitive, and yet we are so drawn into the drama and intrigue of the characters that this is forgotten in a moment.  This is absolutely fantastic drama - in my opinion nothing has been made since that can touch it for its sheer power and vibrancy.",1062460800,11,870,4.474683544303797
759671,4,6303980813,"I'm a big fan of the books and the mini-series; in particular, I think Jack Pullman did a fantastic job with the script, especially since the books have very little dialogue, so he had to create almost all of it for the series. Therefore I endorse the positive comments made by the other reviewers, and do not need to repeat them here.
Having said that, I think that the series has a few weak points:
- the relatively minor role given to Germanicus. In the books, Germanicus is a very major character. In the series, he has a very diminished role. This is understandable in as far as the main events involving him occurred outside Rome: the legions' mutinies after Augustus's death, his campaigns in Germany, and his clashes with the governor of Syria, Piso, ending with his death and Piso's subsequent trial. The series obviously lacked the budget to portray scenes involving many extras. Still, I did get the feeling that, when watching the series, one wonders what was it all about Germanicus. The crisis of Piso's trial is abruptly introduced with very little background, so the scenes of the trial fall flat somewhat. Moreover, by eliminating some events, Tiberius's resentment of Agrippina becomes less convincing.
- Brian Blessed's characterization of Augustus. I think he is a fine actor, but one with a sort of overly theatrical and unrestrained acting style. I personally found it very hard to accept him as the Augustus of Graves's novel - - and much less as the historical Augustus.
- they way some characters just pop in and out: after playing a very central role in Sejanus's fall and Caligula's accession, John Rhys-Davies's Macro simply disappears, without any explanation. In the novel, Caligula first removes him from his post by promising to make him governor of Egypt, then has him killed - surely a very short scene could have been included to that effect? Also, Agripinilla, Nero's mother and Caligula's sister, just appears out of nowhere in the final episodes, having made no appearance at all in the Caligula episodes.
- the series wrongly says that Caligula thought that he was not only a god but also ""the Jewish messiah"". In the novel, Graves subtly suggests that the prophecy that made both Livia and Caligula believe that they were going to be the greatest god ever actually referred to Jesus. But the point is never explicitly made, and no connection is made to Jewish point of view in this matter. In this regard, Pulmann actually just confused things.
Of course no adaptation can follow a novel thoroughly, but I really felt that these changes were not only negative, but also unnecessary.
However, I still think that the series's strong points far outweigh the weak ones.",1061942400,10,2705,4.857142857142857
759672,5,6303980813,"The BBC production of ""I Claudius"" is, beyond a doubt, the best portrayal of Imperial Rome in TV or movie setting.  While some may argue that ""Gladiator"" (2000) gives a good feeling of the decadence resulting from Commodus' reign and the decline of Rome, they blow the characters way out of proportion.  The end result is a mockery of Roman History (perhaps ""Caligola"" being the only film worse) and a carbon copy of a much better peformed ""Spartacus.""  Much of the setting and aura, and dress has nothing to do at all with late Empire. Instead, its script suggest that the writers wrote down everything they remembered from a grade school class. Unlike Gladiator, which is nothing but wholesale lies and inaccurcies to the point where the movie is no longer viewable, ""I Claudius"" stems from the works of actual primary documents from Ancient Rome. Robert Graves' novels both come directly out of primarily Seutonius, as well as some Tacitus and Cassius (mostly for the story about Livia), and Jack Pullman saw fit only to take creative license when he felt it necessary to facilitate the plot, but preserving the realism.
The cast of ""I Claudius"" puts anything Gladiator and similar films have to shame.  The finest out of the Royal Shakespearean Actors and Actresses, give emotional and powerful performances.  Brian Blessed makes Augustus a strong Emperor, but a weak husband.  Sir Dereck Jacobi, of course, leaves us no doubt as to who the protagonist is, and each inspiring scene he is in, makes Russel Crowe even more overrated.  John Hurt absolutely dominates any scene he is in with a psycotic look and the outrageous actions for which Caius Caligula was known for. Patrick Stewart, John Castle, Fiona Walker, and George Baker (making an excellent down-to-earth Tiberius)-all well-known talents, give character and plot depth and create dynamic characters.  And as anyone will tell you, Sian Philips should have been deified for her acting here, just as Livia Drusilla was.  Her lines are with such conviction, that we get the impression that we are hearing indeed the real thing. And to compliment Livia's power of speech, Philips' facial expressions capture profoundly, the woman who ""was bitten by a snake, and then it died.""
Even if you don't like history, you cannot help but appreciate quality acting when it is there.  After you have seen this, Gladiator will sit on a dusty shelf while you watch this over and over again.",1061251200,8,2438,4.938875305623472

It simply isn't good enough. These are expensive DVDs and to produce such rubbish is just customer contempt on the part of the manufacturers.

759674,3,6303980813,"This is truly one of the best ""mini-series"" dramas ever made, and I easily rate the show itself FIVE STARS. There's a lot of reviews of this show by others, most of which describing the brilliant writing and acting. Some people mentioned the picture quality isn't that great, considering this is a DVD release, but the original show was shot on video. It's cheap looking, anyone will admit that. The whole production is studio-bound, and there's not a trace of music throughout. It's basically a stage production played by stage actors - and all of that adds to the charm. It's the writing, it's the writing, it's the WRITING! You'll be hooked.
But the DVD has a serious problem with the audio. It's horrible! And I know it's not the show itself, since I've seen this both on PBS and video, and never did I have trouble hearing anything while watching it then. But the DVD version is muffled, and you'll have to turn the volume up ALL the way to hear the more quiet moments. A lot of the time I couldn't hear a thing being said. I was so frustrated that I hooked up a stereo to the TV, hoping that would help. But I even had to turn the stereo up ALL the way, and even then the more ""whispery"" moments are nearly impossible to hear. And considering how much scheming and secret plotting go on in the show, there's plenty of hushed whispering going on through the Roman palaces.
The DVD's only ""extra feature"" is an hour long documentary about the abandoned 30's production of ""I, Claudius,"" which was to be a massively expensive and lavish movie. Sure, it's mildly interesting, but I was disappointed that the only ""behind the scenes"" material was about this lost movie, and NONE about the ""I, Claudius"" I just got done watching. No info, no extras, no ""behind the scenes"" stuff, no commentary, no interviews. Nothing. Grrr.
But if you can deal with the bad audio (and I'm not the only one complaining about the bad sound - other reviewers have mentioned the same), it's worth the money. But it's not a cheap buy. It's a lot of money to invest, and when you spend that much money on DVD's, you expect top quality. But beware - this is NOT the best quality that could be had.
When I watch this again, I'll probably watch the VHS version. Sure, the visual quality might not be as good, but it never was in the first place. But at least I'll be able to hear what the actors are saying!",1059523200,9,2382,4.440639269406392
759675,5,6303980813,"The BBC production of 'I, Claudius', now decades old, still captures the imagination, and is as fresh and timeless as when it first was broadcast. This is a testimony to the skill not only of the actors and production crew, but also to the writer (Graves) who produced what is essentially an historical novel in colloquial English which gives a real feel for the day-to-day life in the imperial family in Rome. Drawing heavily on Suetonius (the People-magazine writer of his day, far more interested in intrigue and personality than great historic events), Graves constructed a storyline that covers the major events of the advent of the Roman Empire (from out of the Roman Republic) by following the lives of the first four Emperors, primarily narrated as a 'history' written by Claudius.
The series consists of 13 one-hour episodes. They begin prior to Claudius' birth and continue through to his death. We are introduced to the men and women who were important imperial figures: Augustus, portrayed as a reluctant emperor; his wife Livia, mother of the nation, far more ambitious than any around her, and in many ways the power behind the dynasty; her sons Drusus and Tiberius, one destined to die early and the other to become emperor (the only emperor never to be deified, in fact); Agrippa, also ambitious but bumbling; Antonia, daughter of Marc Antony, and portrayed ultimately as the most honourable woman in Rome.
With this mix, the story begins of the jockeying for position within the royal family. Livia is determined that Tiberius succeed Augustus, and systematically eliminates all rivals. Whenever someone rises to prominence such that he might pose a challenge (Julia's sons, Germanicus, etc.) they are either discredited and exiled or, for safety sake, an accident or illness is arranged. After Livia is gone we see the rise and fall of Caligula, and the unlikely succession to power of Claudius. Once again intrigue enters in the form of the emperor's wife, not once, but twice, with finally Nero being favoured over Claudius' son Britannicus, who is murdered shortly after Claudius' death. Nero is the last of the Claudians, a prominent family Livia worked to hard to secure on the throne.
Perhaps the greatest scene is the dinner part in which Livia, Claudius, and Caligula are discussing prophecies and the future, at which point Livia confesses her crimes and her motivations to Claudius in hopes that he will, when emperor (a prediction he in no way believes), see to her deification.
Derek Jacobi plays Claudius (from young man to old) with great skill and care. Fortunately for Jacobi, whose career spans stage and screen as well, he has the acting ability to avoid being type-cast, but there is a tendency to default to Claudius (see the scene in the movie 'Dead Again' in which Jacobi plays a man with a stutter). Sian Phillips almost steals the show with her masterful portrayal of Livia. Her speech to the dying Augustus, explaining to him as he slips away why she was compelled to poison him, is a remarkable performance. Brian Blessed plays Augustus with skill. John Hurt, known for bizarre and eccentric performances, manages to interject the right amount of mania into Caligula.
Ultimately, Claudius did write histories and commentaries, but they have not survived. It is unknown if they did not survive due to political censorship (which I, Claudius implies) or because they simply weren't that good.
Alas, in truth, Claudius was neither as competent or caring an individual as one would believe from this re-creation. But it is fair to say that he was a good sight better than those before and after his reign. If you'll invest 13 hours in this series (and yes, it is worth it), take the time to invest a few hours in a legitimate history to find some of the historical realities that were 'glanced over lightly'.",1058918400,9,3848,4.9306625577812015
759676,5,6303980813,"Absolutely the best example of characterization and story telling to be found anywhere. You can make fun of the English for a great number of things, but they have the entire planet cornered on acting! This mini series is perfectly cast and if you give it a chance to get going, it will HOOK you from start to end.
This is surprisingly one of the sexiest shows I have ever seen, too. Not really for young kids or young teens. Brian Blessed is perfect as Augustus, an emperor for whom the job seems too big and exhausting sometimes, but this is because of his scheming wife who will do ANY thing to get her sons the big position held by her husband. Patrick Stewart also gave an incredibly strong and unforgettable performance as a military man looking to sleep his way into royalty and power. He pays by being dismembered and publicly displayed. I'm sorry he's become Americanized with such schlock as the Star Trek stuff.
The series has some unforgettable moments such as when young Claudius is standing with a group of kids and an eagle drops a wolf pup into his hands (wolves, the symbol of the Roman Empire.) It could have been the strong kids, but it's little, slow, stammering Claudius. Then, Caligula (John Hurt) in one of the funniest scenes anywhere shows up in frightful, ungodly drag as some sort of goddess and dances around poor Claudius who knows if he laughs, he'll be instantly dead. When Claudius becomes emperor, the love of his life wife, unknowing to him, takes on the biggest wh*re in Rome to see who can lay the most men in a day. And she beats the wh*re. The wife is then forced to commit suicide by knife, but can't and is forcibly decapitated as she begs for her life.
Tiberious becomes a sexual deviant and forces a woman to do perverted acts in exchange so that her very young daughter doesn't have to. The woman disembowls herself in front of everyone at a dinner because she feels so violated and dirty.
Augustus'beloved can-never-do-anything-wrong daughter beds most of the Roman senate and all her dad's friends and he banishes her to an island forever. Everyone is sleeping with everyone and it's a little tough to keep up, but verrrrrrry entertaining.
If you're looking for great acting and story-telling, give this one a go!! 10 stars, actually, this is the ultimate Classic!",1056499200,2,2309,4.647921760391198

""I, Claudius"" is without doubt one of the greatest things television has ever given us.  This story has everything: great characters, intrigue, murder, lust, sex, passion, politics, humor, etc (and thats just in the first couple of episodes).

759738,5,6303980813,"[This is an update to a review I posted some time ago for the 2000 DVD release.]

Engrossing, wonderfully told tale of intrigue, lust, power, deception and of course, murder that follows in the wake of the ambitions of ancient Rome's first ""familia"". Brilliantly adapted from the Robert Graves's intelligent novels (among my favorite works in print), this series is ranks among the greatest television's ever produced.

It comes as no surprise that this comes to us from across the water--a 30 year old BBC production that owes as much to art direction and production values (even on a TV studio using video) as to the powerful performances by Britain's premier actors.

Many of them, such as Derek Jacobi, John Rhys-Davies and Patrick Stewart (yes, that Patrick Stewart), hail from the country's Shakespearean ranks which adds extraordinary breadth as well as credible gravity to their roles. Brian Blessed gives an inspired performance as the remarkable, complex, and ultimately troubled Caesar Augustus. The absolute best, in my opinion, is Sian Phillips as his Machiavellian wife, Livia, the prime mover of the story's Byzantine plots and machinations.

This is drama of the highest order and on the grandest scale -- no stupid, white trash mob family beheading each other over garbage routes -- an entire Empire is their chessboard. On every level (including the far more artful and judicious use of violence), ""I, Claudius"" makes overrated shows like ""The Sopranos"" look like the cartoons they really are.

If you are not accustomed to deliberately paced, sentient drama, or particularly like Roman history, I recommend renting it first. Then sit back, and take a nibble to have a taste of what American television could and should be. (But beware of the figs and the mushrooms!)

*** UPDATE REGARDING 2008 REMASTERED EDITION ***
There has been much discussion whether this new version is edited or not. The short answer is: yes and no.

NOTE: SOME SPOILERS BELOW.

The biggest changes are in the first episode (broken out into two in the 2000 release). The opening scene with the African dancers is abridged significantly in the 2008 version; there still is nudity, however. One can only guess it was for timing purposes. Also, the episodes previously entitled ""A Touch of Murder"" and ""A Family Affair"" have been combined into one called ""A Touch of Murder"" (as apparently it was first broadcast in the UK).

There is a different transition from the scene where Agrippa bargains with Augustus for marriage with Julia back to Claudius writing at his table. (Which ended episode 1 in the 2000 DVD set).

In the 2000 edition, this dialogue is treated as VO with Claudius at the table. Food is brought in and the slave disparages the cook. This has been cut -- or perhaps moved to a different episode but I can't recall where -- as is the comical moment when Claudius belches and suspects (again in VO) that he's being poisoned.

In the new version, it the scene with Agrippa and Augustus cuts to Claudius walking down a corridor and talking out loud about how Agrippa lasted 9 years before he was poisoned (it has the line ""Wicked, wicked woman!"" referring to Livia). Then there's a very awkward whip pan and freeze on young Drusus, which begins his scene with young Tiberius in the gymnasium. (This was the opening flashback scene in the 2000 edition of Episode 2.)

Other changes noticed in the 2008 edition:
""Waiting in the Wings"", the orgy at Julia's house is shortened.
""Reign of Terror"", the denunciation of Tiberius in the Senate is slightly longer.
""Zeus By Jove"", the assassination plot between the conspirators is longer, with Cassius demanding the entire imperial family also be killed, then he pretends to relent. Also, the ending is cut by a few seconds and there is no ""END OF PART 9"" title just before the credits. In the 2000 edition, we see Claudius's horrified reaction when he opens the door to the bed chamber. In the new version, he just walks in and the episode ends.
""Hail Who?"", there are a few extra seconds showing Caesonia's body just after Cassius murders her.

PQ/AQ:
Picture is notably sharper, except for a handful of scenes that were either overlooked, or just couldn't be cleaned up. Still, it's not a pristine image, but probably the best one could hope for.

Audio is standard stereo. Almost all the dialogue was recorded on set so, depending on the performance, can sometimes be too loud or too quiet at a given volume level. The sound effects such as cheering crowds and trumpets, seem louder than the dialogue.",1046304000,,4552,4.871927554980595
759739,5,6303980813,"The BBC's mid 1970's 13 part adaptation of Robert Graves novels ""I Claudius"" and ""Claudius, the God"" has always been considered to be one of the finest pieces of television ever made (The Bollinger of the Beeb if you like.) and in many ways puts most big budget films to shame. I first saw this when I was about 8 or 9 years old (my parents allowed me to stay up and watch it) and I remember being transfixed by it. Up until then history as it was taught at school was all about cavemen with rocks or pitch battles between army's, quite boring really, but these characters who were ready kill, steal or do what ever was necessary to get and hold on to power really fascinated me. I bought this DVD a couple of months ago, just to have more than anything else, but once I started watching it, the magic started all over again. With the perception of an adult I can see just what a masterpiece this series actually is.
Covering the greater part of reign of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, of the most fascinating periods in history, I Claudius begins 7 years after Octavian's defeat of Marc Anthony and Cleopatra at the battle of Actuim and ends with the accession of Nero. The individual performances from Derek Jacobi as Claudius, stammering his way through life with only the occasional hint of the man beneath, Sian Phillips, as the scheming almost lady Macbeth like Livia and John Hurt's Caligula are all acting master classes. Hurt in particular is in amazing form, many actors have tried to portray the unpredictability and sheer manic insanity of Caligula, but none have come with in spiting distance of Hurt or for that matter any of the three above. This overt display of genius seems to lift the rest of the cast along with them, Patrick Stewart, Brian Blessed, George Baker, Isobel Dean, James Faulkner, Barbara Young, Fiona Walker and Margaret Tyzack, all superb actors and actresses in their own right, give the performances of their careers here.
Although the picture looks slightly crude (not surprising considering that it was shot on video rather than film), the soundtrack is almost nonexistent and the sets look Spartan by the standards set by modern cinema (compare the palaces in here with those in Gladiator to see what I mean), yet despite these shortcomings, the viewer very quickly looks beyond that as he or she is carried away by the truly engrossing story and magnificent performances of all concerned, approach this more as a stage play than a movie and you'll get the idea. Ok so, authorised history is sacrificed in favour of a good story, although Robert Graves himself always claimed it was accurate based on a manuscript he discovered in the aftermath of World War 1, what we have here are the back stairs whispers and not the facts as set down in the history books. But isn't the servants gossip is always much more juicy and often far more revealing than the press release?",1045872000,,2904,4.673828125
759740,5,6303980813,"Here we have a family saga full of intrigue, love, hate, violence, lust, ambition, and insanity.  The drama is heightened because it the family includes Roman Emperors, beginning with Augustus through Nero.  The wonderful dramatic mechanism is the narration of the story by Claudius (played so wonderfully by Derek Jacobi) who is thought to be a fool and yet ends up, briefly, the Emperor.  He is writing his own history of the family and empire from just before he is born until his wife betrays him in favor of her son, Nero.  Along the way we get the amazing and evil Livia (Sian Phillips), the crazed Caligula (played so bravely by John Hurt).  This is a big story, based in outline in fact, but is most of all a great story told memorably.
It is told in 13 episodes as it was aired over the BBC.  It is from the mid-1970s and has some of that period's style and production values, but that really doesn't make it dated because the story and the acting are so powerful.
This five disk collection also includes a documentary of a 1937 version that was going to be done for the big screen and would have starred, among others, Merle Oberon, and Charles Laughton.  It documents what it was intended to be and why it failed.
This series is an amazing experience and its all-star cast almost uniformly went on to great heights.  It is really something that needs to be experienced and you will likely want to view it many times.",1043971200,3,1427,4.503875968992248
759741,5,6303980813,"This production of the original BBC mini-series is fantastic! I own this and highly, highly, and even more highly, recommend it!!!
First of all, the history in this adaptation to the novel by Robert Graves, is impeccable. I make such judgements as a historian, and don't make them lightly. Certainly, there are many flights of fancy and conjecture in this historical fiction, but it is one grand historical fiction! They have the timeline down pat, and the familial and dynastic relationships as well. Poetic liscense is taken, again, in all of the fiction and conjecture, but it really all fits into place with the history, and with what contemporaries wrote of the Julio-Claudian line.
Claudius, the grandson of the first emperor of Rome, Augustus, is played by Derek Jacobi. Claudius was a stammerrer/stutterrer and had a lame foot. Who would have known the greatness that was destined for him other than the Sybill? Claudius' life is chronicled from the retrospectof his autobiography(it would be wonderful is such a one existed!). All of the players for power in his family are there, from Augustus, played by Brian Blessed, to his wife Livia, played by Sian Phillips, to Caligula, played by John Hurt, to the ambitious Sejanus, played by Patrick Stewart(with hair!), and the awful Nero. Claudius' rise to power is the culmination, and his poisoning by his wife the climax. At the end, he and the Sybill(the oracle), laugh about how he cheated death....as he buried a copy of his autobiography that Nero and his mother had so craftilly destroyed.
Another note on the acting in this. Most of these actors are Shakespearian actors. Derek Jacobi's performance is stupendous! I also particularly liked Brian Blessed as Augustus, John Hurt made a very believable Caligula, and Patrick Stewart, so far away from his role as the captain of the Enterprise, plays a villanious and conniving Sejanus.
All in all, get this, beg borrow or steal to watch it. I know its long....13 hours to be precise. But it is worth it. Like a good book, you can't put it down!
The DVD Format is very nice as well.",1043712000,2,2091,4.876404494382022
759742,5,6303980813,"This miniseries blows any other miniseries out of the water. It is the quintessential Roman epic. Derek Jacobi is astounding as Claudius. This is the second movie of his that I've seen. The first Derek Jacobi movie I saw was the Kenneth Branagh version of Hamlet. Ironically, his character's name was Claudius in that one too. All of the actors are stupendous from the big to the small, from the major roles to the minor roles. There are some very sad parts like when they kill Sejanus's kids. When I first read a synopsis on the Internet of Sejanus's last episode. I thought, ""Oh, my God. They kill those cute kids."" I was shocked. I'll admit that it took me a while to recognize Patrick Stewart as Sejanus. I thought he was going to be bald like in Star Trek. George Baker was amazing as Tiberius. He was so strong. He portrayed Tiberius as a man who won't take any bull from anybody, not even his mother, Livia (who was beautifully portrayed to perfection by Sian Phillips). Frances White was simply delightful as Julia. There was one thing I didn't like about her. Her nose was so big. I wonder if that's her real nose. Despite that, Frances White's performance was over too quickly. All of the characters in this show age considerably. For example, Livia is 50 at the beginning of the show. Then, she's 60 and her hair is grey. In her last episode, she's in her 80s and her hair was so white, I thought she was bald. Brian Blessed must be one of the most popular actors alive. He keeps getting hired for everything. For a more recent look at the actor, rent Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace. He was Boss Nass. There is also an appearance by another popular actor, John Rhys-Davies. His most recent role was Gimli in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. He is also known for portraying Sallah in Raiders of the Lost Ark and Indiana Jones: The Last Crusade. He was good. I didn't really recognize him partly because he had a beard in all the other movies I saw him in. My favorite episodes are the early episodes where everything isn't as tragic and dramatic. Things kind of get tragic after Augustus dies and Tiberius takes over. Things are just as good in the last episode where not only is there an appearance made by a character from the first and last episodes (the Sibyl) but there is also a scene where Claudius is in the Senate and all of a sudden, the ghosts of Augustus, Livia, Antonia (his mother), Tiberius, and Caligula (played by John Hurt). Augustus congratulates Claudius on becoming emperor, Livia calls Claudius a fool, Antonia tells Claudius that his nose is running, Caligula tells him that he found out he was mad, and Tiberius tells Claudius that being emperor just isn't worth it. I was moved by this sequence because I enjoyed seeing old faces again. I sort of wish that Julia was there too and all the other people who died along the way. John Hurt played Caligula with a very childish air. I personally didn't know he was so mad that he ate his own child. However, John Hurt's laugh is incredibly annoying. There's another thing I didn't like about the movie. There was too much nudity. I felt like I was watching a movie that was a period piece and a porn movie at the same time. The guy who played Nero made Nero look like [a goon] and it became brazenly obvious how the empire fell. All in all, buy this movie. It is fabulous. It doesn't have subtitles but that's the way it is.",1043280000,,3412,4.452076677316294
759743,5,6303980813,"I had not seen ""I,Claudius"" since it was first broadcast on British television in the late 70s, but as I watched it unfold on video, I found myself remembering vividly every scene. It is that powerful. ""I,Claudius"" has got to be one of the best historical dramas ever shown on television. From the remarkable script to the first class acting, it has everything.
Jack Pullman's script extracts the very essence of the source novels by Robert Graves. The viewer is drawn effortlessly into a world of power, intrigue, murder, incest, and cruelty. At the centre of all this is the stuttering, crippled fool, Clau-Clau-Claudius, who survives palace revolutions and mad emperors through pure luck and by seeming more foolish than he really is. In fact, he survives them all to become a reluctant Emperor until he falls victim to.... well, I won't give the ending away, although it is historical record. Shall we just say that women are rather negatively portrayed. (This is not the fault of Jack Pullman or Robert Graves, but that of the ancient scribbler, Suetonius, whose book -or should that be scroll? -, ""The Twelve Caesars,"" portrayed the Caesars as men of good intentions who became corrupted by power. Seutonius was a republican who loathed the idea of an all-powerful Caesar. He thought that the wives of the Caesars, conniving poisoners all, had a corrupting influence. The Senate, therefore, should be the sole repository of authority, away from the perfidious influence of women. Suetonius was not exactly an early feminist. Graves' source material, as he well knew, is suspect.) However, allowing for Suetonius prejudices, and we are talking about the turn of the 1st millennium here, if women do not come over as sympathetic, then they are at least strong. Livia, the wife of Augustus and aunt of Claudius, practically ran the Empire through her husband. She was evil personified. Only Messalina, the wife of Claudius, and Livilla, the sister of Claudius, (see a pattern here?) match her for sheer evil.
The acting is sheer joy. Derek Jacobi, John Hurt, Patricia Quinn (the sexiest woman ever to grace a film set), and Sian Phillips, all shine. However, it is Brian Blessed who truly stands out. For once Blessed doesn't overact. He brings both subtlety and authority to his role as Augustus and it is a joy to behold.
I cannot fault ""I,Claudius"". It is excellent, truly excellent. Buy it and be entranced. Four videos, each at three hours, and not a minute too long.",1041897600,5,2475,4.923444976076555
759744,5,6303980813,"Simply one of the finest television productions ever made with a who's who of British TV actors from the mid-70's many of whom went on the greater things - Derek Jacobi, Patrick Stewart, John Rhys-Davis, John Hurt, Sian Philips etc.  The acting is extraordinary with special laurels to Brian Blessed who turned in the performance of his life as Augustus.  Do ANYTHING to get hold of a copy, you'll never regret it.",1040169600,3,414,4.736111111111111
759745,5,6303980813,"When the series was first broadcast in 1976, many of us watched it in black and white.  As with any big-budget BBC production, we could expect one repeat run after the BAFTA awards, but then the tapes would be locked away in the vaults of Broadcasting House.  It was never intended for the scrutiny of repeated viewings on video or DVD.  As with nearly all 1970s TV programmes, this has a mono soundtrack.  The sharpness of the DVD mastering reveals many of the flaws in the actors' make-up -- the joins where Claudius's false nose and wig meet his skin can frequently be seen, for example.
There are no location shots at all -- all scenes were filmed inside the BBC studios.  Aside from the excellent characterisations and acting by the main players, most of the minor characters seem flat.  Most of the young men, including members of the imperial family destined to be poisoned, just seem dull princes with 1970s haircuts and no idiosyncrasies.
But it just doesn't matter.  This is an absolutely glorious series, which brings back many memories of the 70s.  One night a week for 12 weeks in 1977, we made sure we stayed in to watch the repeats of I, CLAUDIUS.  From the moment that snake appears across the opening credits (later parodied in BLACKADDER) with the chainsaw buzz of the series' theme tune, we were hooked.
Derek Jacobi is superb as the shy, handicapped, intelligent historian who never wanted to be emperor but ultimately attained the heights.  (You can almost seem him as an early role model for Hugh Grant in FOUR WEDDINGS or NOTTING HILL.)  The message I personally took away from these viewings as a teenager was this: don't be ambitious for status; don't stick out; just be true to your heart and work hard at whatever task comes your way.  Watching it again in as a repeatedly tactless 43-year-old, I see that I somehow overlooked Claudius's extremely diplomatic, even fawning nature.
There are lots of fantastic British character actors in minor roles -- e.g. Geoffrey Hinsliff, later to star in the excellent sitcom BRASS and the long-running UK soap, CORONATION STREET.  Notice also, if you can, the actor who plays Gimli in the new LORD OF THE RINGS movies.  Special mention should be made of Margaret Tyzack, who plays Claudius's mother outstandingly -- she is almost always ignored in reviews of this 12-part series, simply because there were so many major roles.
If you haven't seen this series before, then beware the first episode, which is twice the length of the others, and much the worst.  It's a scene-setter, a vehicle for establishing some of the key early characters, but it doesn't do quite enough to get the viewer to commit to watching the other 11 episodes which, as it happens, all sparkle with brilliance.
At least two year after its US release, this DVD set is at last available in the UK.  If it had been made by Americans, I guess we British would have criticised it for all its historical inaccuracies.  But we must blame the original author of the books, Robert Graves, for these.  Nearly everyone who saw the series has much affection for it, and we all hope we know a little more about Roman history.  Perhaps what we learnt is really about the corruption that absolute power brings.",1034208000,12,3236,4.725978647686833
759746,5,6303980813,"Some of Rome's emperors were born great. Others achieved greateness, while still others had greatness thrust on them. The emperor Claudius was of the last category. He did not wish to wear the purple robe of majesty and it was only the choice of accepting the mantle or being killed that caused him to reconsider. Derek Jacobi as Claudius brings to life Robert Graves' twin novels (I, CLAUDIUS and CLAUDIUS THE GOD), both of which were smash bestsellers in the 1930s. In 1976, director Herbert Wise combined the two as I, CLAUDIUS, which became a mega-ratings hit. Those who rarely watched anything arty on MASTERPIECE THEATER watched this and were enthralled. What they saw was a saga of the corruption of the post Julius Caesar Roman empire. When Brutus and his fellow conspirators stabbed Caesar on the Ides of March, it was only Brutus who did so to bring back the probably non-existent ideals of the long-dead Roman republic. Derek Jacobi plays Claudius as the stuttering, clubfoot that he was, but he also manages to invest his character as a man who has a secret agenda: to restore the republic that had been quashed a full century before. After Caesar's assassination, each of his successors met a violent death. The competent Augustus (Brian Blessed) is poisoned by the sneaky Lavinia (Sian Phillips), who wants her son Tiberius (George Baker) to rule. Years later, Claudius sees how Tiberius is smothered by Caligula (John Hurt), who in a short time really trashes whatever dignity remains in the Roman mind. Still later, he sees Caligula gutted by assassins, who now force him to wear the crown. During the many years while all this was going on, Claudius uses his physical infirmities and his supposed mental shortcomings as a protective cloak against jealous rivals for the throne. He watches, he listens, he writes histories. He is reasonably happy with his life and his pretty young wife Messalina (Sheila White). It is only when he becomes emperor that the mini series becomes really interesting. Now for the first time, Claudius has to play the power game and he can no longer use his ailing body as a shield. In historical fact, Claudius was one of the better, more competent emperors, and in scene after scene Jacobi plays Claudius as a man of immense but flawed dignity. He is so busy with an audacious plot to restore the republic that he fails to learn from the tragic errors of his predecessors. At the end, the viewer has been treated to a sixty year montage of the initial rumblings of the fall of the Roman empire. He has seen up close the behind the scenes machinations of intrigue wielded by power-hungry brutes who see Rome only as a means of personal aggrandizemnent. He has seen that the high price for that infamy is sure and lethal. And he has seen a good emperor trying until the very end to restore the dignity of a country that had been sorely lacking for decades. Jacobi's Claudius is a man who is seen as trying to remain outside the innermost circle of the emperor's bull's eye, but ironically comes to realize that though most seek kingship for selfish reasons, a very few like him have it thrust upon them, exposing them to the perils of envious emperor wannabes. The real life Claudius would have been terribly upset to discover that his own low opinion of human nature was still several orders higher than the reality of that nature. In its historical sweep, its magnificent acting, its bitter realization of the realities of power, I, CLAUDIUS is not to be missed.",1030233600,7,3508,4.752459016393443

I can only give the DVD production 3 stars, however.  The transfer is fine and crisp, but aside from a moderately interesting 1965 documentary about the failed attempt to produce a film based on Graves' books, there is no additional material.  Even sub-titles for the hearing impaired would have been a great addition, to say nothing of a director's commentary.
Someday I hope someone comes out with a real collector's edition of this series.  A commentary by an historian would be worth a lot to me.",1028160000,15,699,4.75206611570248
759788,5,6303980813,"I was one of the original fans of I, Claudius when it was shown on Masterpiece Theater in the 1970s.  When the VHS version was released in the early 1990s I bought a set and have enjoyed it many times.  When I noticed that the tapes were becoming somewhat worn I bought the DVD version.  There is only one word for this series on DVD:  magnificent!  For the first time I truly appreciated the sumptuousness of the sets and costumes.  Marble shines, jewels sparkle, the silks almost rustle.  The colors are amazing.  The audio is excellent as well.  Every aside, whisper, and stammer is crystal clear, unlike the VHS version where sometimes all you hear are mutters.  If you are not familiar with the story, I,Claudius is the history of the reigns of the first five Roman Emperors as envisoned by Robert Graves in the 1930s.  The Julio-Claudians ruled their empire but could not control their own passions or their own relatives.  Every episode is brimful of intrigue, passion, and wicked humor. Also included in this DVD set is a documentary on ""The Epic That Never Was"" about the first time I,Claudius was to be filmed.  The interviews with the surviving stars and the bits and pieces
that have survived from the film before it was cancelled reveal it to have been possibly one of the great films of the 1930s.",1027641600,34,1311,4.623376623376624
759789,5,6303980813,"This is one of the greatest films ever.  The acting is uniformly superb (the camerawork emphazizes this by very effective closeups which clearly reveal the character's thoughts and felings), and the script is literate, insightful and mordantly witty.  For me, Livia is the most central character, even more than that of Claudius himself, for it is her treacherous, vicious and  murderous actions, and the soul destroying effect it has on others, that creates the fear, distrust, sadism and brutality that ultimately brings about the downfall of the Claudian royal family.  The ultimate irony is that while she truly believed that by securing the throne for her son, Tiberius (who she, again ironically, felt contempt for) through getting rid of all those who stood in the way, she was actually securing the survival of the Claudians, she was actually tearing that family apart.  As Livia, Sian Phillips creates an unforgettable portrait of a woman who is supremely brilliant, forceful, cunning and filled with contempt for humanity (as demonstrated by the attitude she displays towards the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of those around her).  She really inhabits her very demanding role to a degree that I have never seen surpassed.

I had to pump the sound level on the TV to the top level and turn on the stereo speakers and I still couldn't hear what they were saying at times.  However, performances like these come along very rarely, especially today.  I doubt you will see this kind of greatness on American TV again.  Luckily they restored the original opening with the African dance. It had been cut for US audiences when originally presented in prudish American.  I do wonder though if the scene where Claudius opens the door on Drucilla, after Caligula had eaten her baby, showed the horror of what he had just done.  It seems to me that there is an abrupt cut in the scene as if we were meant to look inside the door but a censor decided we shouldn't see what was there.  That has always bothered me!",1027382400,3,966,4.48
759791,5,6303980813,"""There is no disputing taste."" I loved the mini-series on BBC, and jumped at the chance to pick up Claudius on DVD.
The series is based on the books ""I, Claudius"" and ""Claudius the God"" by Robert Graves. It definitely helps to have read the books before seeing the mini-series, as the books provide much more background (perhaps too much, in some cases) for various people and events.
This series begins with Emperor Claudius writing his memoirs, then fades back into his youth. Born with a club foot and a stammer, the young Claudius is thought to be a buffoon... an idiot. He is actually quite bright. Early on, though, he is advised to exaggerate the stammer and play the fool. Strange advice, but it serves well.
Rome is full of intrigue, generally revolving around the Emperor's throne. Augustus is Emperor, and his wife Livia (who is also Claudius' grandmother) is the power behind the throne. Livia is a remarkable woman. She desires that her son Tiberius become the next emperor, and has no compunctions about assassinating anyone who gets in the way.
Livia manages to murder Claudius' father and brothers, as well as a few other people who get in the way. But she is fooled by Claudius' charade of idiocy, so she ignores him. She gets her way; Tiberius does become emperor....
I shan't say much more about what happens next. It's a very good story.
It's not suitable for pre-teens, as there are some frank references to sex, and quite a bit of violence and blood - the scene where Caligula stops Gemellus' cough (by having his head cut off) comes to mind.
It amused me to notice that Patrick Stewart had an important role in this mini-series - as one of the most notorious villains. Patrick Stewart *with* hair, mind you!",1027296000,2,1730,4.675409836065573

The great strengths of I, CLAUDIUS are in the driving pace, sharp wit, and ferocity of Jack Pulman's script and the host of brilliant performers who play it out.  Chief among these are Sian Phillips as the calculating, murderous, and unspeakably cold Livia, wife of Augustus; although Derek Jacobi gives a justly famous performance in the title role, it is Phillips who dominates and drives the story with this, the most brilliant performance of her career.  But this is not to disparrage the overall cast, which is remarkably fine and includes such noted artists as Brian Blessed, John Hurt, Patricia Quinn, Patrick Stewart, and a host of others.
Like the serpent that appears in the open credits, the story twists and winds--and covers several generations of the ruling family as Rome slips from the republic to royal rule, largely due to the manipulations of Livia, who has few if any scruples in her determination to rule first through her husband and then through her son.  Although the look of the film is somewhat dated, it in no way impairs the power of the piece, and I, CLAUDIUS remains one of the handful of miniseries that actually improves upon repeated viewings.

759796,5,6303980813,"Bizzare and quirky, this unforgettable lesson in Roman history is the greatest miniseries ever committed to film.
As it starts, Emperor Claudius (the astonishing Dereck Jacobi), reconciled to the fact that he'll most likely be murdered like his predecessors sooner or later, decides to write down the sordid history of his famous family while he still can. Lucky in that his physical disabilities have masked his intelligence (he would now almost definitely be diagnosed with cerebral palsey), he loses most of the few people who really care about him and survives - after the murder of his step-grandfather/great uncle Augustus - the reigns of his uncle Tiberius and nephew Caligula. Dragged literally kicking and screaming to the throne, senility ironically starts to make of him what everyone thought but he had previously never been as he serenely waits for his harpy-like last wife and stepson, Agrippina and Nero, to do the expected. It has been a remarkable life.
Yes, the story is accurate - it's just that when in doubt Graves accepted the more wild rumors about this time period. If he hadn't run with the rumor that Livia had poisoned almost half the family, for instance, the first third of the series would have been a heck of a lot less fun.
A heck of a roller coaster ride it is, too - leaving you laughing hysterically one minute and totally creeped out the next (literally in some of John Hurt's scenes - his Caligula is so memorable that if you haven't seen it in a while you forget that he wasn't even in that many episodes compared to some of the other characters). The only possible complaint is that the last third doesn't have a villain comparable to Livia and Caligula - perhaps it was felt that a strong Nero would have been too similar to Caligula and they had been there and done that already.
A must-see you'll remember for a long, long time. One last note, by the way - if you want to watch this with kids, you'll definitely want to pre-view if they're younger. The middle in particular is not for the faint of heart.",1019692800,6,2046,4.670360110803324

A landmark television mini-series with an operatic look and feel (though not sung in any way) everything about it is alive - from the sets to the actors.  Easily the most convincing ancient period piece, everything flows to a time and place that no longer exists, except in the imaginings of the creative process.  I Claudius excells in every aspect of every creative element - script, cast, direction, art design, cinematography, lighting - it must be committed to in order to be appreciated fully.  In other words, set aside a week to watch the DVD, or two even, with designated times for viewing, so that you can appreciate its addictive qualities.  It's more than a tale of ancient Rome, but a soap opera or dramatic heights and callous lows that can make you cry, blush and even laugh on occassion.  The amazing Derek Jacobi is unforgettable - he's luminous and present, fully realized as both simpleton and emperor by Jacobi, embued with profound and meaningful twitches and mannerisms lesser actors would've used for comic releif (often needed here, by the way.)  Sian Phillips is uniquely grand in another key role - as Livia, mother of the emperor and betrayer, manipulating everything she can get her hands on.  You hate her for disparraging Claudius, but laugh nervously when she turns on the charm.
A handful of superb miniseries have been presented over the years on television, accessible to all, and applauded for generations.  Like ""Roots,"" ""Upstairs, Downstairs,"" ""Elizabeth R,"" and ""Tales of the City/More Tales of the City"" - I Claudius withstands the test of time, and remains today a thrilling, jaw-dropping event.

759868,5,6303980813,"This 25 year old 13 part BBC series was adapted from Robert Graves' book, well, romantic novel, and puts Octavian's wife Livia in the role of Cleo historically assigned in literature.  It's obviously a TV production, but people looking for the blockbuster special effects and location shooting should see this anyway.

The historical Claudius wasn't the bumbling nice guy seen here, but was such an improvement over his predecessor that I cut him some slack.  Besides, the dramatization is enjoyable.  The historical Claudius turned out to be second best of the Julio-Claudian emperors (the best being Augustus).  This dramatic version of Claudius was similarly second best, and comes across as a genuinely nice guy.  The historical Claudius concerned himself with presiding over the courts whenever he could, he built Rome's winter harbor, he established an efficient administration by delegating to a couple of capable men (also shown in the program), and took an interest in the minutiae of imperial matters.  His conquest of Britain may have been ill advised in retrospect, but in our time Britain is the best understood of all the former provinces of the Roman Empire.

Some people may find disquieting the fact that so many of the female characters are murderers and ruthless addicts of power.  Others may notice as I did that the only people of color found in these episodes are dancers, musicians, and other non speaking roles. A few reviewers have noted that the sound isn't mixed up very high.  I also noticed this.  Gosh, what a hardship it must be to reach for the remote control.  Or get out of the house and take a walk instead of watching 13 hours of TV.

It includes surviving footage from the production, as well as numerous interviews with survivors of the cast, the director, and Robert Graves himself.  In my view, this documentary blows the doors off the additional material on the new, new DVD release of ""Spartacus"".

A cheesy paperback from 1958, ""Those About To Die"" [0345242408] by Daniel P Mannix, is a largely factual fictionalized account of the games, not a scholarly work, and if you happen to see it at the library or a garage sale, and have a strong stomach, check it out.  I was just rereading its description of the largest ever naval ""games"" which were staged by Claudius.  He had crews work eleven years to dig a tunnel three and a half miles long through rock in order to drain the floodwaters off landlocked Lago di Fucino (increasing the available arable land), and after this civil engineering project was finished he decided to celebrate with a battle between two ""navies"" of 12 triremes each (a trireme had three levels of oars on each side, it was a huge freakin' ship).

One crew was dressed like Sicilians, the other like Rhodians, and a half million spectators traveled the sixty miles from Rome to watch, including fifteen pregnant women who gave birth during the festivities, not unlike Woodstock.  The lake had to be surrounded by troops to avoid an attempt at a breakout, and at least 3,000 of the participants died during and after this mock naval engagement.

It is historically correct in every aspect of its nature, following the reign of Augustus to the beginning of Nero; it's a drama that will grip you until the very last minute.
I highly recommend this to everyone, regardless if you know the history of the Romans; its something that will make you think and change how you look at life forever.

As for content, this series brings Robert Graves' Claudius novels to life in a way that no movie ever could.  Don't believe me?

On VHS, it costs about ten times more than a big-screen movie-and it's worth it! (Although catching the series on PBS would have been a lot cheaper.) I recommend this film to anyone who can get their hands on it. What Robert Graves does with ""I, Claudius"" is to take a piece of history and spin it into a captivating work of fiction. Some writers and moviemakers can do this by rearranging the facts and ""dramatizing,"" but Graves seems to remain loyal to what we know about the ancient Romans. The largest part of the people and events he describes are factual, which helps make this experience what it is. Books, by their nature of introspection, tend to be better than their movie counterparts. However, some movies are so good that they rival their book sources. ""I, Claudius"" is one of those movies. The book, ""I, Claudius,"" and its sequel are excellent. Still, by the time you reach the sequel, ""Claudius the God,"" most of the gripping characters are dead (Claudius is one exception). This change of pace felt in the transition from first to second book is less apparent in the movie version.

For me, however, ""I Claudius"" is most remarkable for the enormous number of juicy scenes it gives to a wonderful troupe of classically trained British actors. To say that these actors make the most of their opportunities is an understatement. ""I, Claudius"" is virtually a short course for theater students on the use and control of voice to create character.

759923,5,6303980813,"Back in the 1970s, I stumbled onto ""I, Claudius"" halfway through, at the point when Piso's wife betrays and kills him. Even that second-string treachery was so ""cold"" that, like so many of the reviewers who have written here, I was hooked.
A couple of connections I haven't seen mentioned here yet:
I wonder how many ""I, Claudis"" fans were reminded by it of Paul's letter to the Romans. ""For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and wickedness of men,"" Paul says in the first chapter, and he launches into a tirade that's jaw-dropping in its intensity: ""Claiming to be wise, they became fools ... They were filled with all manner of wickedness, evil, covetousness, malice. Full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity, they are gossips, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless."" Paul goes on to show us we're all capable of such things, but I wonder if many of his original readers didn't take that diatribe as referring to the imperial family.
  Secondly, many reviewers here have mentioned how much they liked Brian Blessed in the role of Augustus. They should check out the 1971 epic ""The Last Valley,"" in which Blessed has a small but vivid (and much less lovable) role. That picture lacks the superior acting and great dialogue of ""I, Claudius,"" but it makes up for it with spectacular Tyrolean scenery, and it gives a strong sense of the horror of Germany's Thirty Years War. Blessed has a good supporting role also in ""The Last Days of Pompeii,"" a 1980s miniseries that also starred Lesley-Anne Down, Ned Beatty and Laurence Olivier. Unfortunately, that one's not out on video or DVD yet. Blessed also essays Squire Western, the role Hugh Griffith created in Tony Richardson's 1963 ""Tom Jones,"" in the 1997 A&E miniseries remake. Sad to say, I can't recommend that version. Stick with Griffith, Finney, York, Warner, Greenwood, Bull & Co.

759924,5,6303980813,"I, Claudius was made some twenty-five years ago and was even viewed religiously by my father when it first aired...yet, despite deepened research, inevitable aging and dated effects, I find this series facinating.
I first checked out the miniseries from my local library thinking it would help me in reasearching for one of my many screenplays taking place in that era. Little did it occur to me that within the first hour I had dropped my pad and pencil and just watched the damn thing purely for enjoyment.
Enjoyment it was. With an absorbing story line, cute understated humor and marvelous sets, you begin to forget that you are actually getting a history lesson. Derick Jacobi as well as the entire cast preform superbly. I really found that it was kind of like an indie film...simple, smart and cerebral.
One thing that really struck my attention was the fantastic job done on aging make-up. It's really not that important or anything, but it sure does make the story seem so much more realistic. (Pardon me, please, for calling this a ""story""...it's actually a kind of documentary thing, but ""documentary thing"" is very hard to type over and over...you know how it is, right?)
Anyhoo, it's very good. The whole thing. One person may watch it for the costumes, another for the set pieces and back drops, and some may just watch it to be entertained. It dosen't matter if you don't know diddily squat about ancient Rome, I, Claudius will set the record straight. And with seven max generations of the Augustian family you are sure to get the point sooner or later.

There are too many classic moments to tell about---but my favorite is when Tiberius (the successor to Augustus) has been informed by Claudius that his right-hand man in Rome, Aelius Sejanus (played with great panache by Patrick Stewart) murdered Tiberius' son in collaboration with the son's wife, and is plotting to overthrow Tiberius and take over Rome.  Caligula, who is standing nearby, acts greatly shocked at this treachery.  In tones of utter wonder, he says ""Aren't people _disgusting?_""  Considering just _who_ says this, and what the viewer already knows about him (not to mention what he'll do later on) if you don't laugh at that, you've probably eaten some of Augustus' figs by mistake.",974937600,8,1036,4.931034482758621
759927,5,6303980813,"This is quite an ambitious project taken on by the BBC.  It covers the reigns of Caesar Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula and Claudius.  It is more or less the memoirs of the sagacious Claudius (based on the book by Peter Graves).  The series features Derek Jacoby as Claudius, Brian Blessed as the eccentric but magnanimous Augustus and Patrick Stewart as the conspiring Sejanus, head of the Praetorian Guard.  We also get some cameos of Livy and Horace to boot!
The film starts before Claudius was born - about 20 years post-Actium.  It traces thru enough conspiracies, scandals and debauchery to make modern day soap-operas look tame by comparison.  It has its share of femme fatales, between the insidious Livia, the selfish Messalina and the gregarious (to say the least) Julia.  It details the ruthless nature of those close to the top, all wanting to wear the purple themselves, or conniving to get their next-of-kin to assume the throne.
The film has the ""feel"" of a play.  The sets are static, there is no incidental music and the movie lacks panoramic views of the architecture of ancient Rome.  This is not to say that there is anything wrong with this approach,  just that it is not the same type of movie as, say, ""Gladiator"" or ""Spartacus"" in this respect.
This is a wonderful, must-see production for any fan or historian of antiquity.  The film covers a whole lot of ground (to say the least), but still fits in allusions to numerous historical nuances (such as the defeat of Varrus by Armenius of Germany, as well as the horse that Caligula made into a senator).  I would suggest that anyone who wishes to watch this film first read Michael Grant's ""The Roman Emperors"" thru the reign of Nero to get a backdrop on what is going on.  Also, the DVD ""Cleopatra,"" starring Timothy Dalton as Julius Caesar,  was an ambitious project which leaves off about 20 years before the beginning of ""I, Cladius.""",974764800,8,1909,4.745454545454545

Produced in the 1970's , a time when the BBC seemed capable of  producing classic historical drama at will (see the Six Wives of Henry the VIII,Elizabeth R among others) this fascinating and entertaining Roman epic really ""dishes the dirt""  on the early Caesars and their devious relatives. Derek Jacobi leads an inspired cast of fine British actors, along with the great Brian Blessed as Augustus,and special mention must also go to a very young looking John Hurt as the fabulously mad Caligula. This title comes strongly recommended for anyone interested in Roman history (however whether or not it is entirely historically accurate is open to question),and if you enjoy the series ,then read the books as well,because they're even better.",974505600,5,860,5.092198581560283

This was a strikingly adult series.  It should not be  confused with history because Graves' interpretation of possible motives were probably bleaker than the actual events.  But the acting and writing are both very, very good.  Brian Blessed, George Baker, John Hurt and especially Derek Jacobi give the definitive performances of four consecutive Roman emporers (Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula and Claudius).  Sian Philips was the ""immoral center"" of the first 2/3rds of the series, and ages very convincingly over about a fifty year period.  The supporting cast, particularly Patrick Stewart, Margaret Tyzack and Patricia Quinn are great.  If you appreciate fine acting and adult writing, this series is not to be missed.",974419200,8,806,5.25
759980,5,6303980813,"I have looked everywhere for scholarly work on Livia Drusilla, and there is precious little. And what I  have found has been mostly conjecture. This clears the way for Robert Graves's historical fiction, I  Claudius. After all, one can easily conjecture from what we do know - the numerous heirs standing in  Tiberius's path to the Imperium who died under cloudy circumstances - that something was rotten in  the state of Rome during the reign of Augustus and his immediate successors. And if Graves offers up  Augustus's wife Livia as the Black Widow to end all black widows, who can object?
  This thirteen-part BBC drama is, along with the inexcusably neglected BBC Lionheart epic, A Fall of  Eagles, the greatest TV drama ever made and is among the greatest of dramatic productions ever  made in any medium, including live theatre. (If you have seen both, you will notice some of the same  cast, including Derek Jacobi and Patrick Stewart.)  In fact, I Claudius is indeed ""live"" theatre. It is one of the few productions I can recall to bring the  advantages of live theatre to television - long dialogue and up-close and personal relationship to the  audience - while avoiding theatrical staging's claustrophobic effects on a small (or even large) screen.  This is accomplished, I believe, by screenwriter Jack Pulman and production designer Tim Harvey.  Pulman's dialogue is so dynamic and fluent, that it compensates for the constraints on physical action  imposed by a TV studio. And Harvey achieves a small miracle by somehow conveying the grandeur  of Rome, though likewise constrained by TV. This opening up of both the physical and emotional  atmosphere creates ample room for the story and the performances.
  And what performances they are! Claudius is Derek Jacobi's starmaking rle. And Sin Philips plays  the evil Livia with a deliciousness that makes us all feel terribly guilty. For make no mistake, this is a  cruel, murderous and depraved woman, and this is a monstrous story. Yet, at the end of each  episode, we are lusting for more, just like the Roman mobs in their bloody circuses.

Both discs one and two have severe breakup of the image and  sound. In the case of disc two, the problem was bad enough to lock my DVD  player. The only way I could get out of the lock was to unplug the  player--I couldn't even turn it off through either the remote or the front  panel power button. There are also noticeable, repeated video dropouts  throughout. (Incidentally, I have two players, and both had the same  problems, so clearly the disc is the source of the  difficulties.)
Moreover the navigation is badly designed to the point of  irritation. Keep in mind that 12 of the 13 episodes are included on only  two discs. Each of the episodes is then divided into chapters. That means  for any viewing other than watching straight through a side, you are always  negotiating at least two menus, and the instructions for doing so are  minimal.
I give one star for the thought of including ""The Epic that  Never Was,"" certainly a nice addition. I only wish the rest of the DVD  testified to a similar interest in the viewer's pleasure. This program  deserves better than this shoddy presentation.

My trembling fingers tore at the cellophane  covering the slipcase and I reverently snapped the first of three discs out  its cover and into my player. At once I was swept back to my younger days  in 1976, glued to the television, awaiting those dissonant harsh and  metallically evil string tones which announced the arrival of that serpent  slithering with deadly menace across the mosaic background.  I watched  every installment without a break, mesmerized was I.  But it was different,  crisp, clear, with color that jumps off the screen. Footfalls so audible,  the click of the dice, the stab of a dagger, all vivid and real. Excuse my  effervesence, but I have awaited this revived version for many years,  nursing my beaten old beta copies to death, watching the color fade with  each playing, the sound track more muffled and less audible.  How  refreshing to see it live again in such splendor. So wanting was I that I  searched for a laser disc copy but found them too expensive and used.  This  is an affordable Claudius, one which will stand the test of time.  The  bonus documentary of the ill-fated screen epic is just the icing on the  cake, a look at a good idea that for various reasons couldn't make it to  celluloid. However, the BBC version had an ensemble of actors and actresses  who surpassed Korda's vision. Claudius is an intimate story, told in minute  detail, far to grand and lengthly a story to compress into 2 hours. It  deserves all 13, and revels in that time frame.  The most excellent cast  includes Sian Phillips as the methodically murderous Livia, Brian Blessed  as Augustus, noble in ideas but pitifully pedantic and irritatingly obtuse,  unaware of all the intrigue and mahem going on around him, John Hurt as the  monstrous Caligula (my favorite even above Jay Robinson of ""The  Robe"" and ""Demetrius and the Gladiators"" fame)along with  George Baker (Tiberius), Margaret Tyzack (Antonia), Patrick Stewart  (Sejanus) all provide a wonderful tapestry of murder, debauchery, intrigue,  nobility and fatality that frames Derek Jacobi and his stellar performance  as the stuttering, limping, drooling, observing, waiting, and finally  triumphant Claudius. I highly recommend this DVD to everyone who, like  myself, re-lives the tempestuous lives of the first four Roman emperors  over and over again. 5 stars for I, Claudius....",966556800,18,2468,5.002469135802469
760037,5,6303980813,"This set presents a superbly acted soap opera from 1975 or so of the Roman emperors from Augustus through Nero, through the eyes of Claudius (Derek  Jacobi).  This is no dry telling of tales of the noble Roman emperors, but  rather a very graphic telling of adultery and murder from the two books by  Robert Graves.  The acting in this series is absolutely fabulous,  especially of Jacobi who pretends to be dull-witted for much of his life to  escape the carnage around him and who has the last laugh in the end having  survived most of his peers.  Other standouts are murderous, yet ultimately  sympathetic Sian Phillips (wife of Augustus) and the deranged Caligula of  John Hurt.  Even if you watch this once, the 3 DVD set is a bargain -- If  you watch if over and over again, then it becomes a steal!
A nice feature  of the DVD set is a documentary about ""The Epic That Never Was,""  a grand 1937 attempt to put I, Caludius to film that was left unfinished.",965952000,19,961,4.442528735632184
760038,5,6303980813,"I first saw this series when I was in high school in the mid 1980s and have never forgotten it.  It is a tour de force of the early Roman empire starting with the emperor Augustus and culminating (albeit briefly) in the  emperor Nero.  If you have little knowledge of Rome this may spark your  interest, and if you think the topic sounds boring you will probably be  pleasantly surprised, as some could call this series one of the most famous  and treacherous ""soap operas of reality"" ever to transpire.  The  acting, writing, pacing are all superb.  One final note: if you had the  terrible misfortune of having seen the bombastic ""Caligula"" by  Bob Guccione and think that you have seen this story before, you couldn't  be further from the truth.",964137600,6,748,4.625954198473282
760039,5,6303980813,"In High School our Latin teacher assigned us the task of watching--yuck--a  Masterpiece Theatre production of I, Claudius.  After the first week, we  were hooked.  By Episode V (when Augustus dies) a cult had formed.  What  British television series can capture the minds of a bunch of callow 14  year olds?  Quite possibly the best television series ever made.
Where  can you begin?  It's based on Robert Graves superb novels (I, Claudius and  Claudius the God), and brilliantly adapted for television.  Then there is  the hard-as-diamonds perfection of the cast: Sian Phillips as the ice  queen, Livia; Derek Jacoby's stunning Claudius; Brian Blessed's  paterfamilias, Augustus.  John Hurt turns in one of television's towering  interpretations of the mad, bad, and dangerous-to-know Caligula.  The list  goes on and on.
The only defect in this masterpiece is that it was shot  on video and not film, but that does not affect the enjoyment you will  derive from these wonderful episodes.",962236800,3,989,5.171974522292993
760040,5,6303980813,"I could not have imagined being glued to my television for such a long time, but I can't take my eyes off I, Claudius.  Derek Jacobi is absolutely amazing, but the greatest honors go to Sian Phillips, whose Livia deserved  every acting honor possible.  Yes, Livia, you are a goddess!  I am  enthralled by Patrick Stewart as Sejanus, & he was better looking with  hair!  I felt a certain amount of pity for George Baker's Tiberius, who  seemed a rather decent sort before his mother got through with him.  It was  nice to see John Castle (Geoffrey, my favorite brother, in Lion in Winter)  as Postumus, and his resemblance to Simon McCorkindale, who played one of  his brothers (the first to die, I forget his name) is remarkable.  Brian  Blessed is also outstanding, as is Margaret Tyzack (so good in The Forsyte  Saga).  I must say, though, that for me Jay Robinson (The Robe, Demetrius  & the Gladiators) is the ultimate Caligula.  I first became interested  in this when I read that the character of Vir Cotto in Babylon 5 was based  on Claudius.  How true, even down to the prophecy (a sybil has prophecied  that Claudius will become emperor, and a Centauran prophetess saw the same  destiny for Vir).  I absolutely loved it!",962064000,10,1229,4.635514018691588

I seriously think that this performence is a marvel  of theater and litherature. Whoever has a passion for history, drama and  excitement - add this to your shopping cart! NOW!",961632000,9,417,4.3896103896103895
760042,5,6303980813,"This series has everything--love, lust, murder, revenge, humor, pathos, drama, horror.  You don't have to be a history buff to watch it; it's terrific no matter what you like.  I remember being spellbound when it was  first broadcast in 1976, & it's just as mesmerizing & wonderful  today.  In fact, the more you watch it, the more you get out of it.  This  baby was really the blockbuster that put Masterpiece Theater on the map  & deservedly so (with all due respect to ""Upstairs  Downstairs."")
Watch it for the standout performances: Derek Jacobi  is matchless as Claudius; George Baker as a surprisingly poignant Tiberius;  Brian Blessed as a rollicking Augustus; John Hurt having a hootingly good  time as Caligula; Patrick Stewart (with hair!) smoothly vicious as  Sejanuis; & Sian Phillips etching one of the most truly evil  performances ever as Livia.  The amazing thing about these performances is  that they manage to make even the evil characters at least understandable  & sometimes sympathetic.  Even though they have it coming, you're  really sorry to see them go.
This is also a who's who of British actors:  Blessed has appeared in many Kenneth Branagh films (& as a FYI, did you  know his real-life wife played Sybil Fawlty in ""Fawlty Towers?"");  Baker in many Connery ""James Bond"" films (as a good guy); Stewart  in one of his first roles; John Rhys-Davies appears as the man who does in  Stewart's character; John Castle (Geoffrey in ""The Lion in  Winter"") as Posthumus; Ian Ogilvy (replaced Roger Moore in ""The  Saint) as Drusus, Claudius' father; Simon MacCorkindale; and many  others.
No matter what the reason, make a point of viewing this--with the  whole family.  My brother watched it with his sons, ages 10-12, & got  them hooked on Roman history.  Some of it was a bit graphic for tv back in  the 70s, but times have managed to catch up with it--the violence will help  it appeal to younger viewers used to (& wanting) such action.  Above  all, you'll walk away from this a British tv fan, a Roman history fan, a  Derek Jacobi fan, (& I've always loved Brian Blessed ever since from  this series)...  You won't regret it",961372800,30,2149,4.786301369863014

760044,4,6303980813,"For as long as I can remember I've been fascinated by all things Roman. In  the spring of 1984 PBS showed this series again and on the recomendation of  my high-shcool Latin teacher, I was sixteen then, I watched it. At first I  had to make myself sit still. At that time I was more interested in the  Roman military, battles and campaigns. but I sat and in a very short time I  was engrossed. Yes the story is very dramatic and a bit of a soap opera but  I remember thinking that the Romans were suddenly taking on human  proportions. Before I watched this series the Romans were frozen in my mind  - just like their architecture and marble scupltures. In the skilled hands  of John Hurt, Brian Blessed, Derek Jacobi and Patrick Stewart the people,  as well as the Empire ,took on the human dimension. Just recently I viewed  it again and it's even better then I remember. The writing is brisk,  witty,and intelligent. The fact that the story is studio bound I believe  helps for it can't rely on special effects and spectacular stunts. The  action is dialouge driven and a mark of it's quality in that it never lags.  Wonderful production.",961286400,,1141,4.4975609756097565
760045,5,6303980813,"I, Claudius, when it's broadcast on PBS, is entertaining whether one begins at part one or near the middle, say during the reign of Tiberius.  The writing (by Jack Pulman) is so efficient that any episode of the  program will entertain standing alone, while retaining its place within the  larger context of the series.  Each episode glances back, points forward,  and tells a plausible & engrossing tale about the present.  Thus I,  Claudius is a great achievement in the art of good ""teleplay,""  and yet the writing isn't the strongest element of the production.  Great  acting by all the major characters, and memorable performances by minor  ones, raise I, Claudius above the level of a great ""TV  mini-series,"" turning it into great theatre that just happens to be  produced for the television medium.  In many respects I, Claudius deviates  from the novels by Robert Graves that inspired the show, usually for the  admirable purpose of tightening up the drama, and these alterations seem  natural until you go back and re-read the books.  Always, the main themes  of Graves' novels are stressed in the TV production.  For the true story,  go read Tacitus and Seneca the younger... you may discover that I, Claudius  transforms spotty source texts into a plausible exhibition of early  Imperial court squabbles and mortal enemies and vice and wasteful pleasure  and, not least, strains of Roman nobility, kindness, love, and death.  It  doesn't get any better than I, Claudius.  Spend the 100+ bucks for this -  you will not regret doing so.  If you watch it very often, as I think you  will, you may burn out on every episode and say, ""Well, that was  pretty good but I'm burned out on I, Claudius.  I know all the lines, I'm  fast-forwarding to the really good scenes...""  Don't fear - put the  set on the shelf for a year, then try watching Episode 1 again without  proceeding immediately to Episode 2, and so forth and so on.
For the  record: my favorite scenes are 1) Tiberius, in Rhodes with Thrysallus the  astrologer, laughing at the latest news report from Rome - Lucius (possible  heir to the Principate) has drowned in a boating accident...  2) Claudius  writes a history of Carthage and can't get anybody to read it, but then he  delivers a secret message, rolled up inside the history, to the Emperor  Tiberius, thus bypassing the evil, dangerous Sejanus, who handles all  communications for the Emperor.  The message provokes a crisis, because it  states that Sejanus is plotting to assassinate Tiberius.  Caligula offers a  way out of the crisis, and Tiberius promises to make him the next Emperor,  saying: ""Rome deserves you.  I shall nurse you like a viper in her  bosom.""  3) Caligula, now Emperor, awakens from a long sickness that's  affected his brain, and he thinks he's a god.  He invites Claudius into his  sickroom, to see whether Claudius recognizes the great change in Caligula's  nature.  Claudius enters and Caligula is holding a sword; he threatens to  kill Claudius unless he can guess what Caligula thinks he's become.  Claudius guesses correctly and stays to chat with Caligula, who tells him  frightful stories about past events and then asks Claudius for more  information about Greek and Roman gods... great scenes all, and these  aren't nearly all of them.",959817600,,3299,4.876588021778584
760046,5,6303980813,"I, Claudius, Robert Graves' great book about the Caesars, was brought to television in this BBC series starring Derek Jacobi as the crippled, stuttering Emperor Claudius, narrator of the story. Jacobi is brillian in  this role - going from young boy to old man as the series progresses. Other  standouts are Sian Phillips as Livia, the evil wife of Augustus, Brian  Blessed as Augustus himself in a wonderfully understated performance, and  John Hurt as the insane Emperor Caligula in a performance that is abolutely  over the top.
I have no idea how many times I have watched this series. I  have never grown tired of it. The story of the Caesars - of the  competition, corruption, assassinations, intrigue, political and military  turmoil, family tragedy and human comedy - never fails to entertain. This  series has a little bit of everything that all good stories have, great  plot, fascinating characters, multiple conflicts, moments of drama and  moments of comedy - and it is all (mostly) true.
One doesn't have to be  an enthusiast for historical drama to really enjoy this saga. These Romans  are, in their feeling and ambitions, just like modern folk. Endlessly  fascinating, I, Claudius deserves a place in the collection of anyone  looking to preserve the best that BBC television has had to offer.",959212800,204,1310,5.0
760103,5,6303980813,"Few books are as philosophical, romantic, and adventurous as Robert Graves, I, Claudius and Claudius, the God.  The BBC series started out with naked breasted dancers when such was taboo in the United States.  The video  lacks Cook's Masterpiece Theater comments and such is our loss.  The  performances are stellar, the character development outstanding, and the  beauty of buying the video and reading the books are that they easily enjoy  repeating.",958608000,2,452,5.28169014084507
760104,5,6303980813,"There is nothing that can compare to this.  (10 stars at least.)  Overall historically this  is very accurate.  Claudius was infact very bloodthirsty when it came to the arena  and Tiberius was somewhat more twisted etc...,  but these are small matters, and of  little significance.  There aren't any  players here that don't belong to the script, and  everything happened when  and where it was supposed to.  The book is very  different and deals more  with the Sibyl, but I enjoyed this more (sacrilege, I know,  but just by a  hair).  My biggest complaint is that PBS refuses to release this on DVD  (along with everything else).  Also, since I have an old (worn out) copy, I  don't  know if what is offered is the cut or uncut version.  Needless to  say the uncut offers  more.
This is a great look at the early Roman  Empire, when the 'throne' was inherited and  family members 'arranged' for  succession.  The Emperor, Augustus, is too busy  reshaping Rome to deal  with matters at home.  His wife, Livia, controls the fate of  Rome by  clandestinely killing off the heirs apparent - or manipulating her husband  by making sure he discovers half the senate slept with his daughter.  Little Claudius  grows up largely ignored for his handicaps and manages to  witness almost  everything.  With few true friends, and the butt of every  family joke, he manages to  survive and become Emperor, and Conqueror...
The acting is superb.  This contains my all time seven most hated  characters on  screen: Livia, Sejanus, Messalina, Caligula,  Macro, Nero  and Agrippina minor - in  that order.  Livia was so outstanding that even  after all the hatred she earned, I pitied  her.  Claudius is brilliantly  portrayed.  Germanicus and Posthumus I wept for like no  other.  Julia is a  very sad character, caught in a game out of her league...
If you can sit  through the first fifteen minutes of the first episode, you won't be able  to put it down.",957830400,5,1944,4.753048780487805
760105,5,6303980813,"For sheer acting chops, I don't think there's a miniseries around that matches I, Claudius.  There are the North and Souths, the Roots, and credit where credit is due--for American productions they are sometimes worthy,  even excellent.  But it never got (and will likely never get) as good as  this one.
The characterizations of Brian Blessed, Sian Phillips, Derek  Jacobi, and John Hurt are the particular stand-outs, although the entire  cast and production/direction is stellar.  Twenty years ago, I barely  understood what was going on (at age six, no less), but couldn't help  watching.
These days I understand completely, and still can't help  watching.  Either buy the set or support your local PBS drive, but don't  miss out on this wonderful tale.",957744000,3,757,5.114754098360656

There is no sweeping cinematography to reveal the grandeur of the Empire at its height, but this adds to the  intimacy of the performances ( fewer distractions).  Sian Philips is  fantastic as Livia (Alexis with arsenic) and John Heard is great as  Caligula (much more totally psychotic than Malcolm Macdowell in THAT  movie).  Derek Jacobi was convincing as Claudius (""If I play stupid  maybe they'll leave me alone. Oops...guess not."")  I'm sorry that they  didn't include the connection to Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, who  Augustus defeated at Actium.  It would have been an interesting and ironic  contrast to see Livia in the context of Cleopatra.  Also, don't try to  watch this without a scorecard.  There are many characters and their  relationships can be somewhat labyrinthine.  Enjoy.",957744000,,905,5.159722222222222

Robert Graves' novel took the bits and pieces  of recorded history about Claudius and turned that into a mesmerizing book  told from the supposedly idiotic Emperor's point of view.  The BBC series  went a step further by adding living drama to the classic book and  showcased some of the most skilled actors of our time.  It's interesting to  note that the series' biggest stars, Derek Jacobi, Brian Blessed, John  Hurt, et al are all still highly respected stage actors.  Do yourself a  favor and make sure your children watch this too!

For those who think the video is complicated... the series  CONDENSES vast chapters of the second book (especially Claudius' British  campaigns).

Sheila White  as the treacherous Messalina, Patricia Quinn as the scheming Livilla, Brian  Blessed as the amiable Augustus, George Baker as the cruel Tiberius, and  John Hurt as the insane Caligula all play their characters masterfully.  Don't miss Patrick Stewart as brutal guard Sejanus. A saga of sex, murder,  treachery, love, and a fierce battle for power play out through the  thirteen installments.

What I saw had such an  impact on me that I promptly went out and bought the entire series, then  cleared my schedule and watched all 13 hours from start to finish. Since  then I have watched the series many times over, and look forward to seeing  it many times again. Forget about multimillion dollar blockbusters with  state of the art special effects. This series shows, as the RSC have  consistently shown time and time again, that not only do they turn out the  finest actors on the planet, but that these types of film are no match for  raw acting talent, an interesting story and engaging dialogue. Although the  production was primitive by todays standards and the budget shockingly low,  none of this detracts, but rather adds to it's magic. It still stands today  (at least in my mind anyway) as the most convincing, authentic portrayal of  Ancient Rome during the Claudian Dynasty.  Beginning at the end of the  Republic and just after the Julian era.  The story (loosely based on  historical fact) chronicles the lives of the key individual's within the  Royal bloodline as they plot against, and betray one another in their lust  for power. The characters are vividly and intimately brought to life,  literally leaping out of the History pages to become real people with all  of the weaknesses and faults of the rest of us. Characters come and go with  such rapidity that you really have to pay attention,  no sooner arriving on  the scene than dissappearing, the victim of anothers cruelty, jealousy or  greed.  This is all played out against an incredibly authentic backdrop,  capturing both the romance of the era, and the paranoia of being a member  of the Imperial household. Truly an absolute masterpiece. Anyone fascinated  by Ancient History should buy it. Alternatively, watch it and you soon will  be!

7858976,1,6303980813,"AWFUL!!! I regret not being able to give this abysmal purchase less than one star. The picture quality is beyond awful. NOT blu ray quality by any standard and should not be labeled as such! The 35th Anniversary DVD collection is cheaper and, oddly enough, possesses better picture quality. I would have been better off tossing my $42 out the window. Consider this a public service. Don't buy this blu ray version!!!",1501372800,4,416,4.791666666666667

7858979,5,6303980813,I was so excited that we were able to purchase this dvd set.  We loved this series when it first came out and found it very fascinating.  I remember that when we finished it on PBS all those years ago we were sad that it ended and we didn't get to see any more of the story.  We still felt that way when we watched it this time.  The first disc has a little poorer quality to it than the subsequent ones but it didn't affect our enjoyment.,1485561600,,439,3.9545454545454546
