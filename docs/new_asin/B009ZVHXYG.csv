5374408,3,B009ZVHXYG,"The packaging SUCKS, all the discs are stacked on one spindle.  I buy CDs and DVDs on spindles so I can't really say doing so damages them but unlike those spindles, these discs are being removed and replaced over and over again [providing you like the westerns] so I would want better protection.  One of the biggest problems I have with this package is the discs are not numbered or labeled like they are on the back cover.  I think these discs were sold separately and just combined in this package.  You have to load the disc menu to find out which disc has what movie on it.  Buy this and the Hopalong Cassidy Ultimate Collector's Edition V.2 and you will have all 66 of his westerns.  There is no logic concerning where which movie is placed.  They are different years, no grouping by plot, just random.  I had 2 bad discs  Echo Bridge Home Entertainment isn't the greatest concerning quality pressing,

Picture quality is very good.  As a guess I think these Hoppy movies predate the trio B-westerns like the Range Busters and so on.  He had a young partner or ranch hand and the comic relief buddy.  In these Hoppy is clearly the boss were in other trio westerns the second guy is closer to equal with the first action star.  I have read that his movies had bigger budgets than most other B-westerns and sometimes the theater would run the movie as the main feature.  I would tend to agree.  You see some beautiful country, mountain roads and some of the time a bigger feeling.  The down side [at least for me] is the plots.  Some are great action movies but others are very dull with little action, and some have kids the center of the story.  Rarely somebody sings which I think is a good thing.  The Hoppy look, all in black, progressed over the years, early ones have him in light shades and suits.",1466726400,3,1810,4.443768996960486

8545797,5,B009ZVHXYG,"Buying this and volume two will give you all 66 Hopalong Cassidy feature films.  The negatives:  The discs are not numbered nor do they list the films that are on each disc (The back of the container list the films by disc along with the year of release and the running times.).  It would have been nice if the films were arranged on the discs in chronological order, but they seem to be in totally random order (For example, the first film of the series appears in volume two.).  The positives:  Although each film is preceded by a title card that reads U.S. Television Office following by a color Hopalong Cassidy logo, these prints are NOT the edited television prints.  The films I have watched thus far have the fully restored original theatrical release versions.  The container lists some of the films under their re-release titles but the prints on the disc have the original release titles (the first in the series is listed on the container as Hopalong Cassidy Enters but the print carries its original release title of Hop-Along Cassidy).  These are not splice ridden and scratched 16mm prints!  They appear to have been mastered from well maintained 35mm elements.  If you like shoot em ups/horse operas/oat burners, this collection is a real treasure.  In almost 40 years of home video, I cannot recall any other release that gives so much quality at such an unbelievable bargain price.",1497484800,,1399,4.7875

8545801,4,B009ZVHXYG,"Public domain films are usually blurry or second generation. The wonderful thing about this is they're not. Have watched two so far and they're sharp and clear. They're the films, though, and not the TV shows. But anyone who loves Westerns will be pleased.",1485043200,,256,4.840909090909091
