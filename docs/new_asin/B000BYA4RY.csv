8094210,2,B000BYA4RY,"SPOILERS!!!

Initially engaging for first few minutes, this quasi ""documentary"" about a young Hollywood hot-shot's attempt to scrounge up funding to finish his highly personal film might have seemed relevant in late Sixties/early Seventies. Today, just a big head-scratcher that will quickly leave canny viewers wondering why anyone in Hollywood today would pay the slightest bit of attention to hero's sad-sack dream project--a partially finished zip-budget indie with zero commercial potential. Why would anyone bother documenting the backstory of such a miserably under-financed fiasco? Why aren't we ever shown any footage from this thwarted masterpiece? Why do all the talking heads in the movies look suspiciously like aging film school/drama students? And why. . .?

Suddenly, floating lightbulb time! It's all a put-on. . .but a not very interesting one as repetitive scene-after-scene documents the fictional filmmaker's efforts to scare up money from similarly strapped friends and associates. Long before the ludicrous ""shock"" payoff scene in Vegas (and subsequently far-fetched ""ironic"" coda), anyone remotely familiar with movie biz will probably realize they're the ones getting the business.

Documentary/schmockumentary. What might have been a clever short subject or even a comic ""mockumentary"" is every bit as non-commercial and uninvolving as the fictional protagonist's doomed brainchild.

Too bad it's necessary to sit through this boring shenanigan in order to fully appreciate the fantastic commentary track, in which the gonzo filmmakers reveal--or purport to reveal (Did what they're saying really happen either? Who knows--but it's fascinating.)--all the hoops they had to jump through in order to foist this stunt on the industry and the public. That's the movie they should have shot.",1212624000,,1812,5.724907063197026
8094211,4,B000BYA4RY,"NOTE: Don't read this if you want to be surprised by the movie!

Judging by the overall reviews of this, you will either love or hate this movie.  I saw this movie on IFC without having heard about it previously, and found it very engaging and entertaining.  Prior to and especially after the last scene, I was motivated to research the movie online.  Unfortunately, by reading this and other reviews, you will lose any element of surprise.  This may affect your enjoyment and perception of the movie.

Regarding the other reviewer's criticisms:
- ""It is completely unbelievable"": I have seen many non-business savvy people get in over their heads, much like the character in this movie.  Yes, he was a train wreck, but not beyond people I have seen in reality.  If a documentary like ""King of Kong"" is real, this movie is definitely believable.
- ""film that lacks all ... humor ..."":  I don't think this film was meant to funny, although there is a sort of dark humor throughout.  If you wanted humor you went to the wrong movie.  It is still engaging.

Didn't give it a five...not close to being a favorite movie, but I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't know about much about the movie before seeing it.",1208822400,,1212,4.61214953271028
8094212,1,B000BYA4RY,"This movie had a few promising moments up front, and then completely failed to deliver. The main premise is flawed. It is completely unbelievable that a movie industry professional (as portrayed in the film), who saved $250,000 in three years, could not raise $40,000 to finish his movie. Good grief! Just put it on the credit card! But all the smarmy groveling scenes just got to be too much. Very much a high school production. The ""twist"" ending lacked all effect, and was completely unbelievable. Waste of time.",1208649600,,515,4.863636363636363
8094213,1,B000BYA4RY,"This is a mock-documentary, but unlike the Christopher Guest movies or ""This is Spinal Tap"", this movie is not meant to be funny.  We're supposed to care about a total loser who is trying to get finishing funds for his crap movie that nobody likes.  Every aspect of this movie is poorly done, even the narration sounds amateurish.  I can't figure out what the filmmakers had in mind with this.  I had heard about it getting lots of attention when it showed on IFC.  Now I know why: the movie is a big cheat.  It tries to seem ""real"" and has what would be a very tragic ending, if it actually happened.  But it didn't happen, none of it happened.  Imagine the ""Blair Witch Project"" but without the scares.  There are so many real documentaries about filmmaking that I can't imagine why anyone would waste their time with this.",1144022400,,825,4.483221476510067
8094214,5,B000BYA4RY,"I loved this movie! Never before have I felt compelled to write a letter like this, but I've gotta tell you these guys are frickin' geniuses! I was so taken in by the whole thing, I couldn't get to sleep until I did further research about the project/Tom. The back story was really digging at me and damn if they didn't cover all the bases! I went to the website, and even to IMDB, it took me awhile to find the truth, but they got me! They definitely have put together a masterpiece and I truly have nothing but the utmost respect for what they've accomplished here. Although I spent most of the morning praying for the poor boys' soul, I can honestly say I will recommend this movie to EVERYONE, (which I have all day), and I'll let them figure it out. This movie has instilled in me, a new desire to complete my own unfinished projects and although I truly believe that I'll never be able to reach the artistic heights that these film makers have, it will be something that I will strive for. This movie is the ""Goal Post""! Thank you!!!!!",1139702400,3,1041,4.343589743589743
8094215,1,B000BYA4RY,"I hated this movie. I saw this some time ago on IFC and its memory has apparently stayed with me so I could write this review.

 Here is a film that lacks all subtlety, humor, and intelligence. In its desperate attempt to portray ""reality,"" it forgot about little things like writing, acting, and any kind of formal display of cinematic know-how. It's all very much in bad taste and completely unbelievable. If you want to see an unltra-cynical (read: ultra-stupid) take on filmmaking with a disdain for the human race then this is the stuff that will take you there.  Do anything: read a book, watch a movie (read: a good movie), maybe even take a long walk - but don't see this. You will never get back the time this 'movie' steals from you.

Thanks for the space Amazon, it's been cathartic.",1139356800,3,794,4.531468531468532

It's a riveting film to be sure - I was reminded of Chris Smith's American Movie (1999), but certainly much darker. We certainly recommend seeing it...

Amalgamates ""American Movie"" and ""Waiting for Guffman."" ...This is like both of those... and something completely original... it is a fascinating, gripping portrait, It is definitely worth a viewing.

...there's much to savour in Gallagher's work.  The near freeze-frame reaction from Adele after blurting out ""Maybe you know something I don't,"" is worth the price of admission alone.

It leads to a shocking twist ending, as Tom shows how deeply he's been affected by this setback and how far he's willing to go to settle things. His extreme reaction to the crisis is what makes the film controversial.
