8058543,5,B00099XGUI,"""Taking It To A Higher Ground"" is an excellent gospel music step and upper body aerobics video.  The video includes a very inspiring introduction, a warm up, a step warm-up, a detail review of the step choreography, and a few sessions of step aerobics and upper body workout with or without weights.

I happened upon this video while looking for another step video to add to my small collection (about 6) so that I could rotate them daily, or so.  I was interested in a video that was different from most of the routine ones I have (Cathe Friedricks, Kathy Smith, Crunch, etc.) and was very interested in one that featured gospel music.  I own Donna Richardson's ""Sweating in the Spirit"" and thought that this one would be good too.  [...]  I purchased the video and am finding it very hard to rotate away from it, it is so excellent.

The step choreography is very unique and challenging including some moves and combinations that I have not seen on a step video, but have seen on a dance floor.  The upper body workout is simplistic, but complete in terms of muscle groups and also challenging.  The music selections are excellent and quite inspiring.

I was most impressed by the section where the choreography is taught.  With many videos, one has to learn as one goes along, but this video devotes an actual section to demonstrating and teaching the combinations, which really helps.  By the time you go through the training a few times, the aerobic section is easier because you focus more on form and effort and less on trying to guess which move is next, therefore you can keep your heart rate up.

In addition, the video also includes five persons who are exercising, and one of them does the routine without a step and without weights.  This would be good for demonstrating the combinations to those whose fitness level might dictate that they not use either.

I thoroughly enjoy this video, however I would make one comment.  The leader of the video is not using ""reverse form"", that is to say, saying ""move to the right"" to the viewer while she moves to the left, which would produce a ""mirror image"" to watch and make it easier to follow.  This ""reverse form"" practice seems to be common in many exercise/fitness videos for the benefit of the viewer.  I was able to rectify this situation by viewing the reflection of the television through the mirror I was working out in front of so that when they ""grapevine right"" for example, I am moving with the group.  Other than that, the video is very, very good.",1168992000,4,2519,4.6076233183856505
