8067472,2,B0009VIHP0,"No need to introduce Master Kanazawa here. It is only sad that he appears in a such bad quality production - not a surprising fact for Rising Sun Productions. I have been going to Kanazawa's seminars regularly and I think that for what is shown here on the DVDs, it is a total price rip off. You really have to be an advanced practitioner to grasp the most of the ideas presented in the DVD set. Plus, you must have attended quite a few seminars with Master Kanazawa in order to understand the fine points and comments he makes though out the presentation. Everything is explained by Kanazawa himself and people with poor knowledge in Japanese-style English have no chance of understanding what is said. No subtitles, very poorly made DVD menu, with a horrible sound quality.

For advanced karateka, however, this set is a good reference point for the basic katas, kihon, and kumite. If you teach, the DVDs will help you, I guess, in your teaching process to ""relay"" the Kanazawa style of karate. I guess that is why I got the set in first place. But if you are a beginner and want to learn from the set - forget it. May be the basic moves and patterns - yes, but at the end to take a test, or to clarify the fine points, one will need to train on a regular basis with a proper teacher (which should be the case anyway).

Personally, I would have liked to see more of the advanced katas and advanced kumite (featured in Kanazawa's kumite book) which are missing in this production.

Bottom line - too pricey for what is given in the DVDs. My suggestion is - if you really really think that you need anything in this set - get only the DVDs which you think will be helpful. It is not worth, in my opinion, to by the whole set.",1254873600,5,1725,4.3343653250774
8067473,3,B0009VIHP0,"Whatever your style of karate, a set of DVDs from Master Kanazawa is a 'must have' item! However, the world-class instruction is poorly let down by the production quality.

The disks are cheaply burned DVD-Rs rather than pressed from a factiory produced glass master. This meant that some portions of my set were unviewable (for me), or jumped and stuttered at best. The sound quality is poor and Kancho's speech is continually 'clipping'.

I feel that Rising Sun Productions has let down Master Kanazawa and his tream badly, making it difficult for the dedicated student to get the maximum from the content provided, which is why I knocked two stars off an otherwise 5-star set.

I'm also suspicious of the positive reviews from 'Colin of Canada' for all the Rising Sun Productions DVDs. He couldn't possibly work for .. no . couldn't be could it?",1135209600,7,848,4.834482758620689
8067474,3,B0009VIHP0,"This DVD set is a must-have for any Shotokan Karate practitioner. From basic punches and kicking techniques to advanced kata and kumite, these DVDs cover almost everything there is to know about traditional karate-do.

Having said that, the production quality and content are not perfect:

1) Sound quality is poor.

2) Menu system (scene selection) is poorly done.

3) Sensei Kanazawa goes into great detail while explaining karate techniques, but he does so in English with a thick Japanese accent which is often very hard to understand. Subtitles would be an invaluable asset, but they are not available on these DVDs.

4) Not all Shotokan Kata are included. I recommend getting Kanazawa's tape ""All 26 Shotokan Karate Kata"" in addition to this set.

Overall, 4 stars for content, 1 star for production quality.",1129334400,7,814,5.082706766917293
8067475,1,B0009VIHP0,"As one of the premier Shotokan karate exponents of the 20th century Hirokazu Kanazawa deserved the support of a professional production company to make this series. What he got, clearly,  was incompetent amateurs, hell bent on the biggest profit for the smallest possible investment-and it shows.  What a sad and very public end to an otherwise illustrious!",1128902400,5,357,5.245614035087719
