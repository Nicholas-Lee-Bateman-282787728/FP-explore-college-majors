4531613,5,B003H6KRK2,I love this anime. The story and animation is great.  I decided to wait to get the complete first season and it was worth it.  It was a really good price for 26 episodes.,1304726400,,170,3.9705882352941178
4531614,5,B003H6KRK2,"When I first watched this series, I did not give it much credit. I was not very fond of the story because I tend to avoid animes with dark plots such as this, and to be honest, I found it to be very boring. I am only now realizing after watching the entire series and going back and watching the first season a second time that this season as well as the second season were uniquely setting up for a story that would end up blowing my mind in a way I never expected.

This is a truly great series, and thanks to the manga, I fallen in love with it. I definitely have a much higher opinion of season one now that I have seen what is to come in the future of this anime series. It tears me apart to know that this series is not selling well enough for season three to be released because that's precisely where the show really gets amazing. If you have not watched this show yet because you thought it looked too weird, you are missing out. Do not make the mistake I almost made. If you have started watching but you find it to be very boring, just trust me and hang in there. I promise that you will not regret it. This is coming from someone who never thought he would end up adoring an anime like this, so you can take my word for it. I hope more people will purchase this season so we can see the rest of the series dubbed.

P.S - Lenalee and Komui rule!",1299110400,,1356,4.018518518518518
4531615,5,B003H6KRK2,"well it's a 5 star souly for the fact that d. gray-man is fantastic, the anime and the manga especially.

but... ugh funimation!!! what are you doing, trying to rob us blind yet again!? I own season 1 part 1 and thank goodness i haven't gotten around to getting part 2 yet because here you are releasing the parts together yet again! you've done this with full metal alchemist as well. now I guess we all know your scheme funi and I for one am no longer buying your parts! of seasons because we all know you'll release the full season sooner or later! ugh this is tough and you have gotten me to spend more money then neccesary. the way yall release yu yu hakusho was amazing, 4 seasons all with 20 + episodes. Now for some anime its seperated with 13 episodes on the parts. the only thing you'll get me on when it comes to buying parts of seasons is dbz kai tomorrow, sorry i just cant refraign from buying db,dbz,dbgt anything. but please it would be nice if you came out with this in the first place! not to mention it saves shelf space when you do this instead of separating it.",1274054400,2,1082,4.252427184466019
4531616,4,B003H6KRK2,"If Tim Burton were ever to attempt a steampunk horror story, then I imagine the results would be something like ""D.Gray-man.""  And the first season of this gothic, deeply quirky anime attempts just that kind of atmosphere. ""D.Grayman: Season 1"" starts off relatively slowly as it introduces the main storyline, the akuma and the sweet-natured Allan Walker. But the story really blossoms as our likable, haunted hero begins his new life among other exorcists.

Allen Walker is a strange young boy with a deformed hand, who has the power to stop the akuma (enslaved human souls under the control of the evil Millennium Earl).

And after a disastrous encounter with an akuma at a cop's house, Allen makes his way to the Exorcist Headquarters to introduce himself as their latest member. But things don't go very smoothly -- he's mistaken for a spy, the exorcists are weirdos, and the place is governed by mad genius Komui and eerie Hevlaska. But Allen finds out just what ""Innocence"" is, and why the exorcists are racing to find it.

And his first missions aren't any less stressful. Allen encounters a boy determined to fight the akuma, accompanies antisocial swordsman Kanda to a haunted city, a town stuck in ""Groundhog Day"" (except for the pitiful Miranda Lotto), a mysterious snowstorm, a deadly swordsman, a strange vampiric noble, berserker robots, and a strange group of humans called the Noah -- who have allied themselves with the Millennium Earl.

Cyborg demons, cross-embedded magic arms, virus-filled biobullets, giant glowing worms with collagen lips, vampires, and a mountain fortress filled with eccentric exorcists out to save the world from a grinning, rotund demon who looks like a Blue Meanie and may (or may not) have rabbit ears. Yup, ""D.Gray-man"" is not your typical manga series, even as quirky horror goes.

And ""D.Grayman: Season 1 Part 1"" does an excellent job sticking to Hoshino Katsura's manga series, introducing a gothic Victorian world and introducing the akuma, the Earl, and the exorcists. It also lays the groundwork for what the Earl's plans are, and what the exorcists are doing. It's a pretty standard ""get the artifacts before the bad guys do"" goal, but with a couple interesting twists.

And along the way, we're given plenty of explosive, horrific action with macabre creatures, graveyards, little shadowy towns, and the tragic, horrific origins of the akuma. But lest the series become too grim, we get plenty of funny stuff as well -- including an entire episode devoted to Komui's deranged robot rampaging through Headquarters, trying to operate on the exorcists.

Allen is a pretty endearing hero from the start -- polite, apologetic, selfless and courageous, even when people are nasty to him. But he becomes truly striking character it's shown how got his cursed eye, white hair, and ability to kill akuma. He's backed by a solid supporting cast -- the snotty Kanda, sweet-natured Lenalee, eccentric Komui and initially depressed Miranda. And the Earl is a very creepy villain -- not just because he wants to kill God, but because he smiles cheerfully even as he destroys people.

It also has a very nice dub cast -- Todd Haberkorn is awesome as Allen, and there are excellent performances by Luci Christian, Chris Patton, Eric Vale, Colleen Clinkenbeard and J. Michael Tatum. The one downside is Travis Willingham as Kanda -- way too deeeeep for a teenager.

""D.Grayman: Season 1"" has a few episodes that don't quite reach ""superb,"" but it's an excellent start to an outstanding anime series. Absolutely brilliant -- and promises to get even better.",1271548800,21,3595,5.026890756302521

4531618,5,B003H6KRK2,One of my favorite animes great voice cast for Japanese and English voice actors they did amazing job with voicing each character. I liked the story and plot of this anime it has a lot of action and small fights scenes but it is entertaing and it becomes better after the first few episodes. There is more action and longer fight scenes as the story goes on and more information why the exorcist fight the Millenium Earl as the story goes on. A must see anime if you like action and comedy and great story. I highly recommend this.,1474156800,,531,4.373737373737374

4531638,5,B003H6KRK2,"I looooooove D.Gray-man!  It's in my top 5 favorite anime of all time.  The only downside is that the series is on hold currently and there are only two seasons (I believe the manga also is incomplete).  I believe this is due to the creator having health issues but don't quote me on that.

D.Gray-man is dark and morbid, and occasionally a little bloody, but not gory really.  There's no explicit content either so far which I tend to prefer in the media I vew.  The world is very unique and the plot will keep you glued to the screen.  There are a couple humorous episodes here and there that had me laughing from start to finish, though most of the anime is very dark and heavy in quality.

All in all I highly recommend this anime.",1422662400,,735,4.313868613138686

4531641,1,B003H6KRK2,"Okay, first of all, I'm a huge fan of anime and Japanese culture, having watched masterpieces like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, Death Note, Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero, Elfen Lied, Clannad, etc. I consider my standards pretty high when it comes to anime. With that said, D. Gray Man is one of the worst, most formulaic and lame animes I've ever wasted my time on. The art style seems cool and interesting at first and the story does seem like it has potential, although it's nothing too original. But anyone used to actual mature anime will soon realize how incredibly boring this show is. The ""demons"" that the main characters fight are pathetic and never pose an actual threat to them, and yet the creators think they can fool us to believe that the 100th 2-minute battle with them will somehow still be exciting to the audience. The disposable enemies are without fail always killed with single attacks. It's ridiculous. Not to mention the annoying side-characters and the fact that the main story moves forward very slowly due to all the boring fillers. Furthermore, the way this piece of crap show handles mature themes like love and betrayal is disgustingly juvenile and just makes you hate the characters that are supposed to be likable.
Nevertheless, I was open-minded enough to give the show a chance because I was guaranteed that it would get better. I watched 52 episodes of this garbage but all I saw was a lame filler episode after another. I wasted 21 hours of my life that I could've spent watching actual good shounen anime like Soul Eater, Fullmetal Alchemist or Death Note. Heck, even totally ridiculous and over-the-top stupid shows like Future Diary would at least be somewhat entertaining. D. Gray Man is just dull in all areas. Even the animation's sub-par.
I seriously can't recommend this anime to anyone. I can't imagine anyone over 12 years old would get any enjoyment out of it and even for audiences that young there are much better shows out there that don't take 50 freaking episodes to get interesting. Avoid this show at all costs.",1407974400,,2064,4.833333333333333

4531654,5,B003H6KRK2,This is the beginning story of Allen Walker and his journey. After finishing watching the first season you will want to watch the second season and it is available in dub as well. The only thing is that only half of the anime is dub the other half is not yet dub. If you are like me who has no problem watching it in sub then you should check it out. Sadly the episode is up to only 103 episodes and it ends at the best part. In case you are interesting in catching up to the story you should read the manga because right now the manga is on hiatus and I am pretty sure you can catch up to the story.,1387324800,,600,3.886178861788618

4531656,5,B003H6KRK2,"The first season follows the young hero/exorcist Allen Walker, as he begins his journey to fight the dreaded Millennium Earl.  The story follows the ""Black Order"" which is an organization that was created to fight against the Millennium Earl and his fellow evil doers known as the ""akuma"".  The millennium earl has come to earth in search of the ""innocence"" that is believed to be ""divine power"" from God.  Both sides are searching for this innocence, and if the millennium finds enough of the innocence, then it spells doom for the planet earth.  The show provides some background information about Allen Walker's past life and that of his master General Cross.  It also shows how the ""Black Order"" operates and that there are many types of different personal that work for this organization.

Each exorcist has a unique ability as he or she uses the type of innocence as a weapon against akuma, to help aide them on their journey against the Millennium Earl.  The Millennium Earl,  uses people's emotions against them, into promising that he can bring back their loved ones, from beyond the grave.  In exchange for their souls, he will do this.  But, that person ends up being eaten by the akuma.

 As the story progresses Allen encounters news friends, allies and many different and new types of akuma.  The main exorcists that assist Allen are Lenalee, Krorry, Lavi, Kanda and others along the way.  The story also introduces the other Generals within the order, and there role in the story.  Each General poses a stronger sense of innocence, and is stronger than the average exorcist.  Basically the Generals travel around the world looking for innocence and to find wielders of innocence, and to recruit them to the order, before there innocence is destroyed by the akumas.

Within the order there are other individuals with different roles within the organization.  There are ""Finders"" who travel around the globe in search of innocence, and to investigate claims of newly found innocence, or sightings of it.  These search together in groups, and they have no ability to use innocence.  If innocence is discovered, then an exorcist is dispatched to investigate further.

I enjoyed this first season, because of numerous reasons.  The graphics are really good, nothing to over the top, or cliched.  The ideas are sound and the story line/plot is just perfect.  Almost everything is explained as the story unfolds.  I really like the fact that there is everything in this series: Humor, seriousness, battles, scariness and other things too.  I really recommend this too anyone who likes to read manga, and is looking for a show that offers something for everyone.  you will not be displeased.",1384128000,,2698,4.951002227171492

4531660,4,B003H6KRK2,"Like many other anime shows of this caliber, there is a league of good people, and a league of bad people. You have the Earl who controls akuma (spirits who have to obey the Earls orders) and the Clan of Noah (whom the Earl controls). There isn't much hint to the big story in this season, but you learn some more in the second season. Also, it keeps mystery with a lot of the characters as far as Maria and Krory *spelling*... These are minor characters that have side episodes every now and then. Both are great additions.

You won't be making a mistake with this purchase.",1355097600,,363,4.2
4531666,2,B003H6KRK2,"D. Gray-man just didn't resonate with me much. I expected an anime about a cursed teen who decided (or was fated) to use his curse and powers to fight akuma to be more compelling. Two of my favorite animes are Fullmetal Alchemist and Soul Eater, so, I expected to like D. Gray-man.

It's not that I didn't like the art. It was fine, with two exceptions: the Millennium Earl was more funny-looking than frightening to me, and sometimes Allen's transformed arm looked too extreme for me to accept. (I do have to admit that I have had similar humorous impressions of other demons in anime, even in Studio Ghibli classics.) Other than that, I liked the character designs, the backgrounds, and the animation a lot. I also loved the concept of how akuma were created. How horribly ironic and punishing that a person missing a deceased beloved could be tricked into turning them into a demon. Heartbreaking!

I did watch the dubbed version. I was surprised to see, I mean hear, Todd Haberkorn voice the lead. He was very restrained compared to how he has been in other roles I've heard him play, but I am so used to hearing him play some crazily extreme characters that I had a bit of trouble accepting him as a lead. Not that he didn't do a good job. I think that I just associate his voice with goofiness.

This isn't a bad anime. I just didn't pick up on themes or layers that struck notes with me. I am currently watching Samurai 7 on Adult Swim and love it. Maybe it's just a matter of taste. Maybe it really is a matter of quality.

I don't have enough interest to continue watching the series, and I certainly will not pay good money to do so. By the way, the plastic case was slightly damaged.

YMMV!",1351814400,,1701,4.421725239616613

D. Gray-man is a great series. It has has action, comedy, and drama. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are all pretty good. This series keeps the viewer interested with plot twists, and the introduction of great new characters. I can't find anything not to like about this series.

This is great, because (hopefull) this means others are buying the DVDs.  If Funimation is allowed to produce Season Three, I will be there to buy that Season also. The manga is wonderful, even though it is getting more complex.  This DVD is worth the money!",1343606400,3,417,4.376623376623376
4531671,5,B003H6KRK2,Great series with plot/character development considerably more mature than one would expect to find in one of the run of the mill shounen animes (while not losing the feel of a shounen anime).,1338681600,,192,4.848484848484849
4531672,5,B003H6KRK2,"DGM, is a wonderful series. I haven't been this excited for a long shonen series in a while, but my friend told me about this and I took a risk and bought it. I didn't regret buying it without renting it before hand. I find this way better then DBZ, One Piece, Fairy Tail, FMA, and Soul Eater. Only shonen series that beats DGM for me is YYH, but that's because I grew to love that series.
This series is a dark fantasy series, with humor put into it, but the horror part of the anime isn't drawn with a lot of blood and gore. (I'm not a fan of a lot of gore and blood, as there it's pointless element.) The characters are wonderful (My all time favorite is Lavi) and the story builds up to something big, also it flows the manga pretty well. Yes, the starting episodes are a bit slow, but it's explaining a lot of important details for the series.
On a note, don't hate the series for a small detail, like the fact Allen doesn't have an English accent even though he's British. Todd does a nice job voicing Allen. The cast just does a wonderful job all over for this series.",1336521600,6,1075,4.173076923076923

4531674,5,B003H6KRK2,This is one of the best animes I have seen in a while. I love the characters and the funny moments in this show. One of my favorite parts was when Allen was playing cards with the people on the train. Seeing his flashbacks with General Cross are one of the highlights in the show for me.,1328313600,4,287,4.052631578947368
4531675,5,B003H6KRK2,"This anime is among my top ten favorite animes. It has everything that any good anime needs to succeed not only incorporated into it, but perfected. It rapidly manages to catch the viewers undivided attention and suck them into the story, causing them to form a bond with the characters and share their experiences and views with them. There is drama, suspense, thrills, and exhiliration at every turn in the plot, while points of comic relief are throughout the series in order to mantain a sense of hope. I recommend this anime to everyone that asks me for my opinion, knowing that the only downside is that it is much too short. 5/5 without a doubt.",1318982400,,652,4.629310344827586
4531676,3,B003H6KRK2,"Hello, well this would be my second review on amazon and I can assure you it won't be much better then my first one.  But I'll try to give an opinion that is suited to one anime fan to another.

D Gray-Man is a cool flick, has cool supporting characters, a story that is different from the mainstream genres, has good comedy, action, and has wonderful art.  The story line will grab you and suck you in and demand your attention, I mean, who would of figured there'd be an army of priests kickin butt and saving the world from some crazy ass clown dude with his own army of wild demons that have there own unique human like antics.  The characters are true individuals with there own cool hero like traits and have relatable traits to our own unique characteristics.  The antagonist are smart and challenging foes for the priests to battle. I think the art in this series is amazing, very clean and somewhat detailed at times.  Battle scenes are really good to, with the use of some cool weapons.  The background music is flowing and goes with the story well. I believe any anime fan will see what a great show this could really be, but, the one problem I had with the flick was the main character.  Way tooooo annoying, he just seemed way out of place, like he belonged in a kids show for toddlers or maybe should have had a spot on sesame street. For the first season I found my self wanting to learn much more about the supporting cast and hoping the main character gets killed off in the next episode.  The english dubbed voice for the main character is cheesy too, (I'm not a huge fan of Todd) it made it hard to want to listen and learn about this guy.  I did buy all the series that is available with the reason that the story, the art, and the characters (excluding the main character) are awesome, and the fact that I'm a huge collector of most anime.

I will recommend this to any collector out there, but for someone whose looking for anime and is new to the genre or has just read the manga and is interested in the dvd I say buy it but don't hate me cuz the protagonist seems like such a loser, be patient, the character does get better and more colourful in the second season, but sorry, Todd is still the voice actor.

p.s. Also be WARNED, that all I have is the two seasons and the story has not come to any conclusion but only left me at the main climax of the story.  I had to read the manga series to continue on the story line and have not heard of any future releases for this show.",1305936000,,2503,4.24421052631579

It's also worth noting that these S.A.V.E. versions of this and other series have reversible covers that don't have the green strip or the S.A.V.E
