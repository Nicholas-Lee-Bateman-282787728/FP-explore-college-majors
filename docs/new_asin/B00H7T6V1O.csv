8630653,1,B00H7T6V1O,"Fasten your seat belts!  When I ordered this movie I didn't realize it was a David DeCoteau production. One of his gay but not really gay movies. Let's get to it. I don't care that every one of these are filmed in the same place (I morbidly watched some of the previews) after all this is super low budget stuff. The ""acting""....horrifying. The ""story""...was there one? I get the impression that the idea is to titillate gay men with there admittedly handsome and very nicely built young men (whose acting abilities are so stiff you could dive off them) spending 10 minutes each doing push ups, showering and rubbing himself (3 different guys). There is the terrible ""love interest' too, some chunky no talent blonde girl. Now the big question...why does this guy put some aging bad actress in just about every one of his movies (trailers again) this one is Darcy DeMoss????? for Friday the 13th part 6....REALLY???!!! does anyone remember her? does anyone care??? The one star is for the boys faces and bods only.",1398729600,3,1014,4.728813559322034
