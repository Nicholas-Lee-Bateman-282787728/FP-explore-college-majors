7832706,3,630297383X,"This is a fun Sesame Street video for kids to watch.  Its purpose is to introduce young children to their baby siblings, so they won't hit on the latter or throw the latter onto the floor.  The muppets are always fun to watch, but I don't think this video really works in reducing siblign ""violence.""  Still worth givign it a try, I say.",1166400000,,337,4.317460317460317
7832707,4,630297383X,"My two kids are 26 months apart. My older (daughter) didn't enjoy this video until she was nearly 3 and my youngest (son) 8 months. I explain my daughter's change of heart toward the video being (a) she's older and has a longer attention span and (b) she can relate better to the live footage of older siblings and babies. Maybe 20% of the video is live footage (there are 3 non-muppet skits interspersed in the last half of the video). These are the highlights of the video. The rest is entertaining but not necessarily enlightening, as far as new siblings are concerned.",1067126400,5,572,4.563106796116505
7832708,2,630297383X,We borrowed this tape from a friend.  We are expecting our second child is a few months.  The tape doesn't keep his attention (he's 23 months).  I turned it off in the middle and we haven't seen it since.  We may try again later.  I would rent it or perhaps use it for an older child.,1037404800,8,284,4.0
