4229359,2,B003YJ85CE,"I love Jari Love videos.  I would get every other Jari Love video 5 stars.  I just got the DVD, and I can find one dancey weight routine and the Body Rock weight routine that I already owned.  There just AREN'T three 30 minute workouts on this disk.  I will do the dancey routine at some point, but was really looking for 3 30 minute routines, as described.  If I had known it was one more dancey routine and one I owned, I wouldn't have purchased this.

In addition, the Body Rock routine is lower quality video than on the Body Rock DVD, and doesn't have chapter divisions.  I had to pop this one out and replace it with the Body Rock DVD to finish my workout.

If you are interested in Jari Love, buy every earlier DVD, but skip this one.",1286409600,21,741,4.169014084507042
4229360,4,B003YJ85CE,"This one is pretty good. It's definitely not as ""hard"" as some I've done but it's fun for a change up once in a while.",1312243200,,118,3.76
4229361,1,B003YJ85CE,"I am a major Jari Love fan, and have literally all her DVDs...except this one, which I had to return.  The production values are terrible, the workout is weird, the exercises aren't entirely safe (lots of jumping around with weights), it isn't really two half hour workouts unless you use your remote to skip around a lot.  All around, buy every other Jari Love DVD, but not this one.

I feared this DVD signalled the beginning of the decline of Jari Love's DVDs, but this is very much not the case.  Her newer ones are her best.  Skip to Boot Camp or Revved to the Max for a good workout.",1309910400,,589,4.318181818181818
4229362,5,B003YJ85CE,"I was leery about ordering this product just because it sounded like it was so much easier than her previous ones. However, after doing this one, while it is easier than the other ones, I think it gives me just as good of a workout as her other ones without taking up an entire hour. I was looking for one where I could do a shorter workout while still working my entire body. I do like this one because she incorporates more upbeat music to make it seem a little more like dance. She also does compound exercises so you do get more bang for your buck in a shorter amount of time. I think this DVD works great for non-consecutive days, and it really isn't as easy as I was led to believe in the other reviews. I've had problems with other DVD's being too easy for me, but this one suits me just fine for days when I want less-intense workout. Nice Job Jari! Looking forward to your next one!",1298246400,3,891,4.186046511627907
4229363,3,B003YJ85CE,"My DVD skips during my exercise, this is not good! It messes up my timing and the time I have available for exercise.

What I do like is the first 30 minutes of Jari's new routine! But the rest of this DVD is from her previous videos.",1296086400,,234,3.978723404255319
4229364,5,B003YJ85CE,Tough and great! You will get ripped. I suggest you get all of them. Some are better than others but you will never get bored.,1291507200,,126,4.08
4229365,4,B003YJ85CE,"I can't honestly say that this is my favorite Jari Love workout. It is very different than her others. However, I will say that I got a good workout. It actually surprised me. It is a bit more ""dancy"" than her first videos. But, I was able to work up a sweat. I think I prefer Get Extremely Ripped and Get Extremely Ripped 1000. But, I think I will include this in my workout routine from time to time when I want something a little different.",1287792000,9,443,4.162790697674419
4229366,4,B003YJ85CE,"I have all Jari's workouts, and I agree this isn't one of the hardest.  Still, I enjoyed it  and even though the other reviewers didn't seem to have three thirty minute routines on their videos I did-- and I got it from Amazon  There is a dance weight routine, a simple weight routine and the weight routine from body rock.  And I found it to be fun and a nice break from the super hard, very long ones from the first two extremely ripped dvds.  I rotate the dvds so an easy day once in a while is a blessing.",1287705600,4,509,4.05
4229367,2,B003YJ85CE,"Have to agree with the other reviews on this.........not what we've all come to expect from Jari Love.  I've been a die hard fan ever since I bought her first dvd a couple years ago.  I didn't buy the Body Rock dvd because of reading the reviews about it being ""dancey"".  I want a good solid workout like she has done with her previous dvds.  This one puts me in mind of an 80's aerobics class.  And there are not 3 -30 minute workouts on it. Wish I had waited to see what everyone thought of this dvd like I did with the Body Rock because I wouldn't have bought it.  Come on Jari, get back to what your fans have come to love you for......serious work outs like Ripped and Chiseled and Slim and Lean.  It took me a while to get used to Get Extremely Ripped and GER1000 because they too were different from her previous works but I enjoy doing them now and mix them up with the older ones.  I'm hoping I will enjoy doing this one with time as well but I had also bought Bob Harpers Pure Burn Super Strength along with Jari's Lean Machine and I liked PBSS immediately. Heres hoping Jari will come through for us on the next one!",1286928000,7,1127,4.137614678899083
4229368,2,B003YJ85CE,"I agree with the other comments.  I have 3 or 4 of the Jari Love Get Ripped/ Get Extremely Ripped and love them but was really disappointed with this one.  I agree it is not 3 30 minute workouts.  You start to cool down on the first one around 22 minutes in.  It felt very disjointed and thrown together.  I did not sweat nearly as much as I do in her other workouts.  The music was not bad and there were a couple of decent arm workouts but they were quite repetitive.  Just as an FYI, I would consider myself high-intermediate or advanced in terms of fitness level and work out 5-6 days a week; usually with boot camp but use the DVDs when I cannot make it to boot camp.  She did have more (and better) abs then in some of her prior DVDS.  All in all, my least favorite of her workouts.",1286928000,4,788,4.064935064935065
4229369,2,B003YJ85CE,"I am an avid Jari fan.  I follow all her advice to a T, but I just don't dig this video.  I adore all her other videos.  Do you know why?  It's because they were basic, no BS, no fluff workouts that produced results.  The cover of this is misleading.  It says 3 30 minute workouts.  You won't really find this.  When I popped it in, there was a dancey weights segment for about 22 minutes then a stretch... the 2nd half is basically going back and forth between bicep curls and lateral raises non stop... you think I'm exagerrating, try it.  She seems to have forgotten all your other muscles exist too.  The dancey beginning part I speak of, is pretty stupid.  The dancey moves that she tries to combine with weights basically make it so that you can't correctly execute the weight move... like ths skipping with anterior raise.  You can't really properly do that while you're skipping... I'm sorry.  And those so-called bicep curls with the lunges side to side... yeah right.  I barely felt my bicep tighten at all.  You only work your triceps in one move in this entire Lean Machine workout.  It's some tricep kickbacks which are done too quickly and the elbows aren't back far enough for complete muscle contraction.  Also, the lunges in this video should just be called ""take a step back with a barely bent leg.""  Not good lunges at all where you should get a 90 degree angle in both legs.  I think the reason for this is because the pace is too fast for that.  The 2nd half gets going after your midway cool down, but you have no cool down at the end of the 2nd half.  Makes no sense.

The best part of this video is the abs section at the end and the strength segment from Body Rock... which some might already own.

I'm sorry Jari, but all in all it looks like this video was just thrown together at the last minute and poorly edited... it cuts off a few tracks while she's still talking and moving...?  I've come to expect the highest from Jari and this video just did not deliver.  I agree with the other reviewer... buy all her other DVDs.  They are much higher in quality.",1286409600,46,2084,4.348051948051948
8409354,5,B003YJ85CE,Arrived packaged well. Love the DVD and am using it regularly.,1433289600,,62,4.7272727272727275
8409355,4,B003YJ85CE,"Currently, I am coming back from a really bad fitness year and am looking at all of my old workouts to see which still appeal to me.  This is a DVD that I will keep, if only for the Weights & Abs workout - it's the reason I orginally got the DVD and the reason why I'll keep it.

I've tried many of Jari's workouts over the years, but have kept none of them after a time because they were just too long and, in some cases, too boring.  This one, Weights & Abs, appealed to me because (1) I read raves about this workout specifically with details about the workout that appealed to me and (2) the 30-minute time frame.  It actually appears on two different Jari DVDs and I chose the Lean Machine option because the cover claimed to contain ""3 30-minute workouts"" on the cover.  Since I'm into shorter workout options these days, that sounded great.  Keep in mind though that there are not three separate options on this DVD, but rather Lean Machine, a 56-minute workout with two longer segments - 30ish minutes and 26ish minutes. (The other DVD it's on is Get Extremely RIPPED! Body Rock.)

Weights & Abs does not include a warm-up, so you'll need to select the Warm-Up separately from the main menu. As with Jari's other strength workouts, this workout is broken up into separate segments working particular body parts, with the weight ranges used by Jari and the five background exercisers shown on screen. For some reason, this workout just flows for me and I find myself not watching the clock.  The moves are creative enough to not seem like the same old, same old and the sequence of moves just flows and I don't watch the clock at all.

Lean Machine is different than her earlier workouts that I did - I think mainly because she tried to incorporate dance elements into the beginning of it.  If you're a fan of dance, don't get excited; it's not really dance, but rather movements that go along with the synchronized strength movements.  After a very fast warm up, Jari does this dance section with multiple background exercisers, none of which are a modifier other than carrying a lighter weight.  In fact, Jari herself modifies some of the moves to take out the bounce or jump. In most of these sections, she starts with a lower body move that seems like a cardio move and then she adds a toning move to do with it.  This segment seems to be a workout to itself and lasts about 30 minutes.

In the next segment, she does more traditional isolated strength work.  In each section, she focuses on specific muscles, sometimes supersetting between two different sets of muscles.  This segment lasts around 26 minutes and must be the third 30-minute workout they refer to on the DVD cover.  However, it is not accessible except to go through the Lean Machine menu option and fast forward or skip to where it starts.

When I do it, Lean Machine is one of those workouts that I wonder why I don't do more often because it is so very  different from other workouts.  Plus, she includes a little bit of work in it for the low back, a problem area for me and, again, I wonder why I don't do it more often.  Then, I don't for a long time.  Regardless, I give Jari kudos for trying something different in it. However, Weights & Abs is a workout that do regularly at longer intervals than I should, but that is an integral part of my strength building collection.",1430265600,,3358,4.461538461538462

8409357,5,B003YJ85CE,"I love this series of workouts, the music is funky and its fun.  Someone said it was dancey but I would not call two-stepping and grapevine dancey!  One thing is, this is easier than most of her workouts.",1427414400,,204,4.342105263157895
8409358,4,B003YJ85CE,"I've used many of instructor Jari Love's DVDs in the past, including all four of her original ""Get Ripped"" series as well as her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Extremely-Ripped-Boot-Camp/dp/B004SBDUP4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Extremely Ripped Boot Camp</a>.  Her original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Get-Ripped/dp/B000BTGY82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Get Ripped!</a>&nbsp;is still one of my favorites, as I enjoy the straightforward strength routine that Jari offers on this DVD.

LEAN MACHINE is a bit different.  First of all, I was partially attracted to this DVD because of the claims of ""3 30-minute workouts"" on the cover, but there are not truly three separate routines on this DVD.  This DVD actually includes a 56-minute, multi-segmented workout that is rather disjointed, as it feels like it was pulled together from several different DVDs (more on this below).  Plus, the style of this routine differs significantly from Jari's past workouts, although as mentioned in my subject line, I actually found this to be a nice change of pace.  The second routine on this DVD is a 30-minute workout, but some may be disappointed to find that this is a re-release of a segment from one of Jari's prior DVDs,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Get-Extremely-RIPPED-Body-Rock/dp/B00501LNPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Get Extremely RIPPED! Body Rock</a>.

The Main Menu for LEAN MACHINE reads as follows:  Complete Lean Machine--Warm-Up--Body Rock: Weights & Abs.  I have described each of these segments in further detail below.

COMPLETE LEAN MACHINE (56 minutes total)

*Warm-Up (5 minutes)
Oddly, this is the EXACT SAME warm-up that is also a stand-alone option on the menu.  This also appears to be taken from the BODY ROCK DVD, as it features Jari alone wearing the same outfit from that workout.  Jari cues a fast-paced series of standard warm-up moves such as side-to-side steps, grapevines, hamstring curls, and knee raises.  She concludes with a few brief stretches, including hamstrings and quads.
NOTE:  For the following three segments, Jari works out with 6 background exercisers, all women.  She uses lighter weights (5-8 lbs.) and first starts with a simple foot pattern, then adds the arms, making these segments more like AWT (aerobic weight training) than traditional strength work.  Finally, the music is fun and upbeat--e.g., the first segment is an instrumental version of Prince's ""When the Doves Cry.""
*Arms and Legs (6 minutes)
Jari begins with a ""skip"" forward, adding a front raise.  Next comes a lunge forward, side, back, and center, adding in a front a side raise.  She then performs two squats to the side with an overhead press, and finally, a march with an upright row.  This entire sequence is repeated several times, alternating the right and left leads.
*Arms, Back, and Legs (6 minutes)
Here Jari starts with a double side step with a hop, adding in a double back pull.  She then performs an alternating side step lunge with an alternating bicep curl.  The final move is a lunge to the side and to the back, adding in an overhead press.  Again, the entire series is repeated several times.
*Back and Biceps (5.5 minutes)
This segment begins with a reverse grip bent over row, alternating this move with a bicep curl and rear lunge.  This is followed by a double side step with bicep curl and then a shallow lunge with hammer curl, including pulses.  The sequence is repeated several times.  I really like this track!  I usually don't enjoy rows, but they are fun here, and you can go a bit heavier with the weights once you have the footwork down.
*Lifts (5.5 minutes total)
For this section, Jari goes down to the floor.  The first 3.5 minutes include prone back raises (half Supermans), knee crossovers and hydrants on all fours, elbow plank, and spider push-ups.  The last 2 minutes consist of a brief cool-down stretch, bringing this portion of the workout in at 29 minutes.  You COULD stop here, but the workout continues as described below.

For the remaining four segments, Jari is joined by a new crew of background exercisers (3 female, 1 male) for more traditional weights work.  These sections feel more like her previous videos, although they also seem a bit odd, perhaps due to the editing--e.g., Jari is often cut off while still speaking at the end of the segment.
*Squats (3 minutes)
Jari calls this the ""bonus legs track.""  She performs squats with reps of varying tempos, including pulses and what she terms ""quickies.""
*Lunges (5 minutes)
This is actually a mix of both lunges AND more squats.  Jari starts with the same front, side, back, together lunge from before, but she also adds a double squat to the side and pulsing squats.
*Biceps and Shoulders (9 minutes)
This is a superset!  Jari alternates sets for biceps with sets for the shoulders, switching up between heavier and lighter weights.  She starts with a ""straight reps"" set for the biceps but moves on to tempo variations.  For the shoulders, she begins with front raises but also performs side raises and upright rows.
*Total Body (10 minutes total)
Jari calls this the ""bonus abs"" segment; it consists of 5 minutes standing work and then an additional 5 minutes floorwork.  For the standing moves, Jari does basic squats and lunges while isometrically holding a weight overhead.  The abs work on the floor includes bicycles, butterfly, vertical crunch, lifts, reverse curl, spider push-ups, and slow push-ups.
The second half of ""Complete Lean Machine"" comes in at 27 minutes total, making it sort of fit the description of a 30-minute routine.  However, this time does NOT include either a warm-up or cool-down.

Finally, as noted above, this DVD also includes ""Weights & Abs,"" a 30-minute routine (actually 33 minutes total) taken from Jari's prior&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Get-Extremely-RIPPED-Body-Rock/dp/B00501LNPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Get Extremely RIPPED! Body Rock</a>.  The routine itself does not include a warm-up, so you'll need to select the Warm-Up separately from the Main Menu.  As with Jari's other strength workouts, Weights & Abs is broken up into separate segments working particular body parts, with the weight ranges used by Jari and her five female background exercisers shown on screen.  Unfortunately, the Weights & Abs workout is not chaptered, so you can't skip around within segments like you can on the rest of this DVD.  Here is the Weights & Abs breakdown:
*Squats and Hamstrings Track (5 minutes)
Squats of various tempos, including ""quickie"" squats and bottom-middle-bottom holds, and then the same with deadlifts.
*Chest and Triceps Track (5 minutes)
LONG chest set on floor (4.5 minutes) including alternating alternating single arm chest press, slow presses, pulses, and singles; finish with very short (30 seconds) set of triceps push-ups.
*Back and Wide Squat Track (7 minutes)
Start with single arm row, regular and palm-up grip; switch sides several times.  Follow with double arm row pulses.  Wide squats, including pulses and pulsing lunges; finish with another set of both single and double rows.
*Biceps and Shoulder Track (8 minutes)
This track alternates sets.  Start with heavier weights for bicep curls, alternating tempos.  Switch to lighter weights for front and side shoulder raises with isometric holds; repeat both sets.
*Abs work (6 minutes)
Series of crunches including oblique crunches (with crossover and straight leg), reverse curl, bicycles, slow lifts with straight legs crossed at ankles, and slow bent leg raises.
*Cool down (2 minutes)
Brief series of stretches on the floor.

Despite the oddities of this DVD, I like it!  It is different from other things I have, including other Jari Love videos.  I even like the fact that the first and second halves of the Lean Machine workout don't really ""go"" together--this just gives me the option to choose whether I feel like having a lighter or heavier lifting day.  (Or, for a tough challenge, try doing ""Weights & Abs"" first, then just the first three segments of the ""Complete Lean Machine"" workout--you'll get about 50 minutes of full-body weights AND cardio!)  As long as you know what to expect, I would recommend this fun and different DVD.",1374624000,,8367,5.341723874904653

I was prepared to muddle through another workout just doing what I was able to do while the instructors hopped and jumped, but this one is just right for me.  Its being called ""dancey"" but it really isn't dancey, because there are no steps to learn like other dancey videos.  If you can two step and grapevine, you got it.  The music on here is very good, the participants are all on cue and look good, PLUS they are not the girlie fashion model types, they are very toned women.  So that said, I love this DVD.  Why not five stars??  because there is floor work and I can't get down there.",1331337600,,621,4.211864406779661
