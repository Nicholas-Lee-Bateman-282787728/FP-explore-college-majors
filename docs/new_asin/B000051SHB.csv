1387637,5,B000051SHB,"I cannot wait to own this video.  I watched this the other night and was so emotionally moved.  This video was excellent.  It is full of these great vignettes--some of which are unbelievable--and other crazy people who are ga-ga over chickens.  There is one particular vignette that made me ball my eyes out in sadness one second and then ball my eyes out in joy the next.  I am so impressed with this documentary, I am going to purchase this director's other video, ""Cane Toads:  An Unnatural History.""",994982400,10,503,4.659090909090909
1387638,4,B000051SHB,"I caught this film at the USA Film Festival in Dallas last year, thinking it would be a fun way to spend an hour or so.  (As you may be able to surmise by my online name, I have something of a thing for chickens.)  Little did I know what was in store for me and my companions.  The stories are charming, some even downright silly, and I learned way more about chickens than I ever thought I would.
I loved the story of the lady who gave her chicken mouth-to-beak resuscitation after it got lost in a blizzard, garnering national attention for them both.  Then there's the story of Cotton, the pet rooster of a woman even more eccentric than I.  This pampered chick has his own special seat in the car so that he may ride around with his owner, who dresses him in diapers (guess chickens can't be house-trained!) and washes and blow-dries him daily, after they swim laps in her pool.  He also loves to watch TV with his human.  (Apparently chickens have vision similar to ours, and also enjoy all kinds of music!)  There's also a story about a rural neighborhood where a man who raised fighting cocks moved in, and all hell broke loose because of the noise the roosters made.  I also learned from Mike (""Miracle Mike"") that chickens can indeed live a very long time without a head!  And a pastor tells his moving story about a tiny hen he owned who defended her chicks against a marauding raptor.  This little film may also make you change the way you think about eating poultry (I was already a vegetarian), showing the horrors to which chickens are subjected before being slaughtered for consumption.
Director Mark Lewis' tongue is firmly planted in his cheek with some of these stories, treading a fine line between mocking/deriding his subjects, and gazing upon them with pure affection.  This film is truly a celebration of chickens, and the people who love them.",994896000,39,1867,4.5568862275449105
1387639,4,B000051SHB,"I stumbled into this chicken-history by accident, and thoroughly enjoyed mysef. Never a fan of the creatures, myself - except for as a food source of course, I did come to have a more open-minded and compassionate attitude towards them after laughing myself silly - more at the antics of the human spokespersons on the show than at the birds themselves. The series of stories or vignettes about chickens, roosters, and the people that keep them, that makes up the program is educational and entertaining, with a very tounge-in-cheek (or should that be tounge-in-beak) attitude that kept me tuned in for the entire hour, despite having unpremeditatively channel-surfed into the coop!",994896000,3,682,5.153153153153153
1387640,5,B000051SHB,"it was so tastefully [no pun intended] and artfully portrayed.  This is not your typical documentary by far and I wouldn't be a bit surprised if this film wins an award.  This tribute to chickens had me welling with tears through some parts and laughing through others.  It was thought provoking and has transformed my outlook on chickens from one of a recipe to one of compassion for them as sensitive and thoughtful creatures.  Particularly riveting was the dramatic difference in the lives of free-range chickens, versus factory-farmed chickens.  The haunting, ethereal music that accompanied this segment was a brilliant choice and made my hair stand on end.  I'll never look at a chicken the same way again...especially those in the grocer's case.",994896000,,752,5.073170731707317
1387641,5,B000051SHB,"Wonderful!  A fantastic discovery.  This has become a family favorite (I fast forward a few scenes for the kids).  Humorous, insightful- a commentary on humanity as much as on chickens- but also a way to discover greater appreciation for this common bird.  Favorite scene: reenactment of MTM rescusitation of frozen live chicken; Favorite line (after recording the sacrificial behavior of his chicken, seated in his armchair, legs crossed, reading his account from a book):  ""now I am proud to be called 'chicken'""... priceless!  Recorded it on pbs but I'm on amazon to order a copy for a friend who owns chickens.  We need more documentaries like this by such insightful, witty folks.  And as far as the misleading title...do note many low star reviews are due to false expectations rather than criticism of presentation.  So please read item description and reviews carefully: perhaps the description could be clearer (alludes to vignettes), but natural history is a broad almost multi-disciplinary term including more than just sciency science (check out its definition on Wikipedia) so if you want to use a DVD for more narrow science this may not be it- you really need to research to find the specific content you need (I've been frustrated myself with the inability to preview content and then being disappointed).  But there is no rule against creatively making a slightly ambiguous or even ironic title for a project- it is on the buyer to research precise content.  And this would still be good for an older audience natural history/multi-disciplinary educational DVD.",1483142400,2,1578,5.125

I read a quote once, and I wish I could find it to both quote it properly and to cite the source, but it said something along the lines of ""I love my dog most when he acts more like a human.""  Although I agree fully that chickens are emotional and complex animals, admiring them for what most folks consider human like behavior I think is sort of an injustice to not only chickens but to all animals.  I think this documentary did a good job in showing both the awe of a chicken as a chicken, an animal with feelings and natural compassionate instincts, and the notion that we love animals more when they are participating in more human activities like watching television and bathing daily in a pool with a naked senior citizen.",1402876800,,866,4.503184713375796

It is not entertaining to watch grown people trying to crow and cluck and do their chicken dance...or to watch elderly people who are mentally gone express their love and affection for their pet chicken while giving it a bath and blow dry. I would suspect that these are the same people who write their cats in their wills for millions of dollars. Dont be fooled into believing that there is real history here or information on dif breeds and how they developed....The chickens and the people who made this garbage are an even match...with the edge going to the chickens.

I've grown fond of chickens and appreciate their benefits to our diet, our garden, and as pets, but they are also very stupid birds and closer to dinosaurs than to your cat or dog as a friend-companion.

As far as I can see the people who don't like the video are a little humorless, which is not a crime. Although it's not a scientific treatise on chicken history, characteristics; and it's not a thorough ""how to"" manual on raising chickens, it does provide (for me at least) quite a bit of accurate (if scattered) information; does alert people to significant issues about food raising and production; does provide a serious-humorous sense of why some people become chicken fan-natics.

I am a little bemused by humans who become vegetarians and vegans, though not offended by them. We (human beings) are omnivores by our evolution. It takes a lot of effort and trouble to eat a healthy diet as a vegetarian (and even more as a vegan). The movie dealt tactfully and sensibly about the process of killing the animals we eat.

In fact, it had half of its skull chopped off, leaving enough brain to breath, eat, and stumble around -- just shy of a normally functioning chicken, as it turns out.

It was on PBS and called, ""The Natural History of the Chicken."" Still being in a sense of awe, Im not even sure what to say about it, but here goes.
Theres a woman in Florida who proudly skinny-dips with her rooster/significant other Cotton every morning. She takes him with her everywhere she goes. Shes got a special little car-seat that allows him to look out the window as they drive around town running errands. He eats the same foods this woman eats and even shares a bed with her. She has him wear little panties around the house to prevent him from   well, you know. As Im typing this, they're grocery shopping together since Cotton eats the same things she eats (just not as much I guess).
Ok, now they cut to McDonalds where the Florida lady and Cotton are enjoying a Big-Mac. (I believe this proves I really don't have a life. Its Saturday night and Im mesmerized by watching a chicken eating a hamburger.)
Now, when this woman leaves for work in the morning she leaves on the television tuned to Cottons favorite programs, usually classical music. He also seems to be partial to opera and is a big fan of Pavarotti.
She shared a poem she wrote about Cotton:
My Cotton Rooster
Each day the beautiful, white rooster called Cotton arises crowing.
He has such love and happiness.
He has such a joy exuding from his whole beautiful being.
I never even knew a human that was filled with so much love and joy, so great to greet me each morning.
Then they spend quite some time talking about this chicken that lives for several weeks after it had been be-headed. Its owners took the bird on tour all over the country when it finally died as they were in between gigs.
Another woman who had several chickens as pets was calling them all in for the night when one of them was discovered missing. She searched exhaustively for the bird and found it some time later under a house, on its back, frozen solid, legs straight up in the air. The woman was sad that her chicken was dead, so she picked up the bird and brought it home in order to give it a proper burial.
As she laid the chicken in a box and was about to close it, she felt a faint pulse in the chickens neck. She immediately scooped up the bird and began performing CPR and was able to revive the bird.
Word had gotten around about the miracle, and the owner of the bird was contacted by an animal psychic who wanted to ask the miracle chicken a few questions.
She wanted to know, When you were frozen [the chicken], had you been going down a long tunnel with a light at the end? And, if so, why did you come back?
The chickens response [as relayed by the psychic]: Yes indeed I did go down the tunnel. I got pretty close to the end where the light was and was told You must go back. And I realized that I had been put on this farm not to just lay eggs, but to prove to people that with love and with caring miracles DO happen. (Ah, the wisdom of a chicken.)
There was a lot more, but those were the highlights. I just had to write about it or I wouldnt be able to sleep tonight.

They could have featured more of the many colorful, beautifully feathered breeds in much more detail and in a more artistic manner. They could also have featured working chickens, as they are in a permaculture situation, where chickens are an integral part of the management of gardens and orchards.
