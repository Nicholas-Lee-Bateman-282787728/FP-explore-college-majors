7210891,5,B00YCEW38W,"Sheamus vs Orton: Despite being an unnecessary rematch from BattleGround; the match at least wasn't too wrong. Sheamus got caught with an RKO after going for his apron flying shoulder block. He rolled out of the ring to avoid pin fall. Then eventually won with a brogue kick.
  Primetime Players vs New Day vs Los Mastadores vs Luchadragons: New Day recaptured the titles by pinning one of the Matadores.
  Ziggler vs Rusev: weaker match of the night that ended by a double count out.
  Stardust and King Barrett vs Steve Amell and Adriane Neville: Amell actually wasn't bad and was in the ring awhile before Nevile was tagged in. End came when Amell took out Stardust with a flying crossbody to the outside of the ring. Then Neville hit his finisher on Barrett to get the win.
  Amell actually would deserve to be in the Hall of Fame due to the hard work he put into actually performing as a wrestler; since he's an obvious fan. WWE will probably be quicker to put Jon Stewart in though just because he hit Cena with a chair.
  The Miz vs Big Show vs Ryback (IC title): I just remember Ryback pinned The Miz after Big Show knocked him out.
  Ambrose and Reigns vs Harper and Wyatt: Reigns speared Wyatt for the win.
  Cena vs Rollins (WWE Title): I don't want Cena to ever beat Flair's record; but with that said this match had a pretty lame ending. They must have ran out of people to cause Cena the match controversially. Cena had the match won with an AA but the ref got knocked out.
  In came...Jon Stewart with a chair who apparently is strong enough to hurt Cena with a chair shot. Rollins then hit his Pedigree ""he needs a new finisher"" for the win.
  Hopefully Cena doesn't actually want revenge vs Stewart now. That would be about as lame as Stewart causing him the match....
  The 9 Diva 2 team elimination tag: Brie pinned Tamina eliminating Sasha Bank's team, then Paige's team eventually won when Brie was pinned by Becky Lynch.
  Cesaro vs Owens: The match was given the amount of time both men deserved. It was a nice long match with many close pin falls. Owens eventually got the win with the pop up powerbomb.
  Lesnar vs Undertaker: this was a much better match than their WrestleMania one. Since it was less one sided and Undertaker had a better offense. It went back and forth with both men kicking out of each other finishers more than once.
  End came when Lesnar thought he won by making Undertaker tap with the Kamura lock. Undertaker then hit a low blow and made Lesnar pass out to the Devil's choke. Heyman later pointed out that the ref missed Undertaker tapping and declared Brock the winner.
  Sting never came out to confront the Undertaker. Although WWE already made me less excited when they had Triple H beat Sting in a match no one wanted but Triple H. Sting needed a win before facing Undertaker.
  Anyway the Jon Stewart interference is about all I really found stupid about the show.",1440288000,,2921,4.508571428571429

7210899,5,B00YCEW38W,"It should be noted that this was the first time in history that SummerSlam was expanded into a four hour event while former host of ""The Daily Show"" Jon Stewart was the official guest host for this event & was seen throughout the night including opening the show with his special guest Mick Foley.

Randy Orton vs. Sheamus - A rematch from the previous Battleground PPV as Sheamus saw distracted with people not ""respecting the hawk"" which Orton took advantage of only for Sheamus to regain it focusing on the chest area with Orton getting a cut above his eye as they used similar offense against each other such as powerslams & catching each other with big moves when there was an opening as it ultimately came down to one man executing his signature impactful move on more than one occasion to put the other down in a solid contest but wasn't as good as their previous encounters.

Tag Team Champions Prime Time Players vs. Lucha Dragons vs. Los Matadores vs. New Day - This was held under fatal four way rules that saw plenty of highlights such as one team trying to revive the ""outlaw rule"", unique double team combinations by different teams such as one team monkey flipping his partner into a double flip pin, impactful offense delivered not just in the ring but all around from the apron & ringside, one man getting the hot tag & taking everyone out in sight, and more than just the legal competitors getting involved in the action in a match with non-stop action from start to finish.

Dolph Ziggler vs. Rusev - Summer Rae & a new look Lana were at ringside as Dolph took the fight right to Rusev with dropkicks & headbutts before Rusev to used his momentum against him to his advantage getting aggressive using his power while Dolph continued to use his athleticism to counter Rusev only for him to showcase some athleticism of his own while the ladies on the outside definitely provided a distraction in more ways than one as this was a solid back & forth match but more of a backdrop to the ongoing story involving not just the participants but the women as well.

Stephen Amell & Neville vs. Stardust & King Barrett - Stephen Amell is known for playing Oliver Queen on the TV show ""Arrow"" in a match straight out the pages of a comic book as Neville used his ""altitude era"" style offense to take the early advantage before Amell was called into the ring & kept catching them off guard with what he was able to do throughout the match while Stardust & Barrett bent the rules to their advantage to take & keep their advantage in what was a solid tag team match.

Intercontinental Champion Ryback vs. The Miz vs. Big Show - This was your typical triple threat match where you saw various stories & situations play out such as each man at various points waited for his other two opponents to cancel each other out only to try to take advantage by either executing one big move right after one of his opponents took out the other with a move of their own along with alliances made to take out one of the opponents & offense having a domino effect with one man executing a move that effected his other opponent in another solid match.

Roman Reigns & Dean Ambrose vs. Bray Wyatt & Luke Harper - The Sheild vs. Wyatt Family feud reignited here with a huge bang as this broke down into a four way brawl in the opening minute with bodies flying all over the place from suicide dives outside of the ring to running on top of & being tossed over announce tables as J.B.L. said it perfectly, ""there's no control over this match"" before the action settled down in the ring with one team being able to single out & heavily work over his opponent with physical offense & submissions while the other team relied on double team offense until a page out of not just their old playbook but also a legendary tag team from the past as well in what was a fun & physical match from start to finish.

United States Champion John Cena vs. WWE Champion Seth Rollins - Both men went back & forth early on with Cena taking Seth down grounding him while Seth was relying on high risk maneuvers going through & over the top to the outside as both men went through a series of counters & reversals of each other's signature moves along with each mirroring the other such as rolling through an offensive move showcasing their core strength dead lifting their opponent as they continued to trade momentum delivering one huge move after the other weather it was submission attempts to using their own opponents or another move from a Hall Of Famers playbook against them in what was definitely the best match both men have had against each other dating back to almost a year ago with Cena delivering the type of performances he's had throughout the year as U.S. Champion while Seth pulled out a new series of offense that hasn't been previously seen in his WWE career with the only negative being how the finish happened.

Elimination Match - Team P.C.B. vs. Team B.A.D. vs. Team Bella: Paige, Charlotte, Becky Lynch vs. Naomi, Tamina, Sasha Banks vs. Nikki Bella, Brie Bella, Alicia Fox - This match was held under special elimination rules where the entire team will be eliminated when one member of them loses a fall that was filled with such highlights as a series of aerial maneuvers to the outside and impactful offense delivered throughout the ring & ringside area with one team having the strategy of waiting it out then singling out one member of a remaining team as this was a good match but was more like a battle of two teams with the third team (and first one eliminated) having more of a cameo role in the match than anything else as it came off as a cluster until it got down to the final two teams.

Cesaro vs. Kevin Owens - It should be noted as the announcers pointed out that Kevin Owens in coming into this match after competing in a ladder match for the NXT Championship the previous night but didn't show any signs of fatigue as both men were evenly matched executing similar offense against each other before Owens was able to use Cesaro's momentum in his favor on the outside before heavily focusing on the neck area but kept being easily distracted allowing Cesaro to take advantage as they went back & forth with each man catching the other when there was an opening with some impactful offense from different positions in the ring in what was a great match.

Undertaker vs. Brock Lesnar - Brock came out aggressive before the match started only for Taker to send him to the outside as Brock heavily worked over the midsection while sending Taker to ""Suplex City"" only for Taker to rebound with some his trademark offense causing Brock to bleed over his eye as the match got more physical with both men trading punches on more than one occasion & playing the same mind games on each other plus a body going through a table while Brock delivered more suplexes & Taker executed more of his signature moves with both men also going for submissions on more than one occasion with one man eventually getting caught & showing the ultimate act of defiance in the process as this was a better overall contest than their previous WrestleMania encounter as Taker was more physical & aggressive while Brock continued to be the dominate beast that he's known for with again the only negative thing being the ending to the match depending on how you want to look at it.

It should be noted there wasn't a bonus match or segment on the pre-game show. WWE wanted to make this event their ""WrestleMania"" of the summer and they were able to deliver that here as this was a quality card from top to bottom overall that this is an event I recommend.",1440633600,,7634,4.512653651482285

7210902,4,B00YCEW38W,"The Randy Orton-Sheamus match was good with a clean finish to boot. The Tag Team Titles match: Prime Time Players (Titus ONeil & Darren Young) vs. The New Day (Kingston & Big E) w/Xavier Woods vs. Lucha Dragons (Kalisto & Sin Cara) vs. Los Matadores (Diego & Fernando) w/El Torito was a bit of a trainwreck at times with guys jumping out to the floor and some things being missed, but overall the effort was good. The story going into the match wasn't that great. Good work can make up for that, though, so give the credit to the wrestlers for putting on a good show. The Rusev (w/Summer Rae)-Dolph Ziggler (w/Lana) match was disappointing with a dumb finish to boot. The Neville & Stephen Amell-Stardust & King Barrett tag team match was okay even with the predictable babyface win. The Intercontinental Title match: Ryback vs. Big Show vs. The Miz was uninspiring this side of the McDLT. The Bray Wyatt and Luke Harper-Roman Reigns and Dean Ambrose tag team match was a basic tag match that was intense as soon as they got out there. The start of the match was really entertaining as was the finish. The middle part was a basic tag match working over one of the faces. In terms of action, there was nothing wrong with the match at all. The Title For Title match: WWE World Heavyweight Champion Seth Rollins vs. United States Champion John Cena was a darn good match even with the ref bump and the unpredictable interference from Stewart. At least it was memorable. The Team Bella (Nikki, Brie & Alicia Fox) vs. Team PCB (Paige, Charlotte & Becky Lynch) vs. Team B.A.D. (Sasha Banks, Naomi & Tamina) was a solid match where all the women worked hard, but it was a little long with the heels working over Paige. The Cesaro-Kevin Owens match was a very physical match that was exciting from start to finish and could have ended at several different points. They have great chemistry. Theyre also two guys with unique offensive moves that look credible. The Brock Lesnar-The Undertaker match was an intense match and pretty good for the time given even with the finish.

8718144,5,B00YCEW38W,"I can't remember the last time I watched a Summerslam--as far as the modern era goes--but this was a really good show. Of course--with an event that was slated for 4 hours--there is some undercard fluff, but for the most part, nothing too much to complain about as far as match quality. I can't say I'm too surprised that Cena and Rollins for the World Title was a great match. I know there's a huge section of fans that are Anti-Cena, but I can't recall too many times where Cena had a bad match on a big show like Wrestlemania, or this one. Love him or not, he's not a bad wrestler.

Taker and Brock may have been even better than the famous--or maybe infamous--WM30 match. Just a little bit of controversy near the end, since the Dead Man has never tapped, but apparently did so here. In any event, Taker wins & I know they had many matches before Mania, but as far as the streak goes, Brock 1, Deadman 1.
