6991638,3,B008F6169A,"Okay, so I get it.  She was raped by a bunch of horn dogs....and then went to get revenge.  Only she lost her mind and her brother.  The girl went crazy.  She started killing everyone and although they enjoyed it she lost as well.  Low budget, but appealing.",1388188800,,258,4.291666666666667
6991639,3,B008F6169A,"It's not the best revenge flick nor the most violent but I did enjoy a few if the death sequences.  The first few deaths were not that great but the last few were entertaining and even featured an eyeball removal.  The story is a tribute to 80's revenge flicks and it does indeed to that, right down to the cheesy music and bad acting.  What I thought was nice about it is what others complain about...the film doesn't have a lot of nudity nor does it show the brutal rape of Cherry.  I know seeing the brutality will at times cause the viewer to root for the deaths of the attackers but it was interesting to see a ""nice"" exploitation flick.  The movie is rather tame compared to I Spit on Your Grave. Freeze Me and Irreverseable.  It isn't going to win any awards but we found it entertaining, just make sure you are in the mood for cheese.",1384819200,,842,4.264150943396227

It gets broken after being a victim to sexual crimes Cherry goes off the deep end and begins a rampage that would make Jon Rambo call the cops. This is not a T & A flick although you may get a glimsp here and there. This is revenege and Cherry is a cold one.",1360022400,,316,3.8615384615384616
6991642,2,B008F6169A,"Fans of ""I Spit on Your Grave"" and those who don't admit they are fans will instantly recognize the plot. Cherry Bomb (Julin Jean) is raped in a coke filled session in the Champagne Room. The Good Ole Boy system prevents any conviction. With the aid of another stripper (Denise Williamson) and her reluctant brother (John Gabriel Rodriquez), Cherry vows revenge.

While they are hunting the rapists a hired killer(Allen Hackley), who looks like they got a Samuel L. Jackson clone, is after them.

One of the first things you notice is that Julin Jean's chest is camera shy. Only extras are topless. On the plus side Julin is able to project that dumb stripper/ho mentality, perhaps a little too well. Unfortunately the script, dialouge, and direction couldn't do her justice. For instance, a man gets stabbed in the stomach and is dead in 3 seconds. The suicide was poorly developed and completely unbelievable. Even Cherry herself was extremely chipper the day after she was gang raped. They made unbelievable characters and played them in stiff roles.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, rape (not too graphic) stripper nudity.",1349222400,,1118,5.0
6991643,4,B008F6169A,"So when I stumbled across this movie I felt a strong urge to see it.  Mainly because it was promoted as a 80s motif revenge flick....well in this case a ""rape and revenge"" flick.  Under the assumption one doesn't know what a ""rape and revenge"" flick just see ""I Spit on Your Grave"".  ""Cherry Bomb""  is a modern movie made to appear that it was made in the 80s. I have to say the film makers did a good job on the authenticity of capturing the 1980s.  The fashion, hair styles and atmosphere were pretty much on point.

The major problem I have with this movie is it is about a stripper who gets attacked, rape and seeks revenge.  The only thing you the viewer see is the revenge.  Allow me to explain, Cherry (the title character of this film) is a stripper and you never see her nude.  In addition, the attack in question is never really shown.  Now I don't want to sound like a sick pervert or a misogynist, but if you are going to have a movie about a stripper there should be some level of nudity. Besides what sleazy 80s movie didn't have nudity?  It is like making a movie about boxing without ever showing a fight. Boy those ""Rocky"" movies would have been different.  And in order for the revenge to have some merit, some of the attack needs to be displayed.  The following formula is what made ""I Spit on Your Grave"" so amazing. I found the attack in ISOYG so unsettling that when the revenge came it brought some merit and credibility. Not for nothing, but this same equation worked for how many ""Death Wish"" films?

As for the acting, well it really isn't that great.  In contrast, I didn't go into this movie looking for award winning acting.  Yet the actress who played Cherry did have a likeable quality.  As for the campy value, it is pretty high.  See my previous comment about the acting. Also look for the hit man named Bull who looks like a cross between The Hulk and Jules from ""Pulp Fiction"". As for character development, there is none. The movie has several loop holes; the estranged relationship with Cherry and her brother and where did a stripper learn to become Rambo?  In defense some 80s movies that ""Cherry Bomb"" mimics were guilty of this too, so I can let it slide.

At the end of the day a movie is about entertainment and I would be lying if I didn't say I found entertainment in this film. The action was pretty good and the revenge in question was alright. I really should only give this film three stars but I did find some charm to it.  Yet a word of advice to the film makers, next time you make a movie about a certain character like a ""stripper"", nudity is required.  In addition, if you are going to focus a movie around a certain situation, like an attack, showing this situation is required. That is what your ""target"" audience is going to want.",1345593600,25,2788,4.352030947775629
6991644,3,B008F6169A,ITS PRETTY MUCH A CRAPPY MOVIE BUT FUN TO WATCH IN ALL ITS FOOLISHNESS! IF YOU LIKE CAMPY 70'S FEEL TYPE MOVIES THIS ONE WOULD COVER IT ..,1344816000,5,138,3.9642857142857144
6991645,4,B008F6169A,"Cherry Bomb is an indie action film that is good, but not great. It has enough action and a fast pace, but not enough nudity for a movie with a stripper as the lead character. Adult film star Nick Manning is perhaps the best thing about the movie, delivering a campy performance as the stripper's boss. Also the movie is quite violent.

8698946,5,B008F6169A,"Something nobody has ever said but that somebody should (and I'm just about to) is ""never follow a scream queen into a horror movie."" Just like you don't choose your college because it's the one your significant other is going to, or you don't want to date anyone from work. You should never blindly choose a horror movie because a pretty actress is in it. Perfect example: Angela Bettis. Amazing talent, goddess of the horror industry...but if you follow her without looking you wind up in a pile of crap like Bless the Child.
 But I'll tell you, I have it bad for Julin (aka Julin Jean). I loved her in Sweatshop & The Final, even though she only had bit parts. And yes, her side career as a lingerie model does provide lots of intriguing imagery. So I knew that I was sort of ""letting the little head do the thinking"" when I decided to buy the movie Cherry Bomb.
 Really all I knew about the movie was that Julin was in it. There was a cute girl in red underwear on the thumbnail, but I couldn't tell if it was my lovely J-girl or not.
 But it was. Julin is in center stage in this one. As a stripper who gets gang raped and then goes on a brutal revenge spree, discovering that she has a special genius for retribution.
 And you know what? Julin was awesome! She has the chops. Not just the chops for the by-the-books cheesy stripper revenge Grindhouse exploitation flick that this film looks like at the outset, but the chops for the really strong, gritty dramatic moments that are artfully woven in.
 Among other things this is the best stripper movie I've ever seen--not saying much because there aren't many (horror movies tend to be extreme, and if you're just looking for an easy victim why not write in a prostitute rather than a stripper? It's a more extreme choice...) and the ones there are tend to be way too goofy (eg., Strippers vs Zombies. Ugh). Most poignantly, you get a sense of the general scorn toward strippers that really exists out there...I think there are a lot of people out there who do believe that No Means No is a rule that stops when it comes to any sort of sex industry. If you're doing that sort of sub-legal, taboo job, you really are ""asking for it.""
 When in truth my experience is that strippers are no more messed up than any of the rest of us, and tend to possess keys to happiness in life that few others do...and that's my RfEAL LIFE OPINION.",1408492800,,2386,4.374717832957111
