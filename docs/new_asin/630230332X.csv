7824279,5,630230332X,"Three years after Bugs Bunny's Easter Funnies came another WB Easter special by DFE, only with all-new content, as Daffy Duck's Easter Egg-Citement in 1980! It'd be one of the last DFE productions before becoming Marvel Productions, and consists of 3 new shorts; The Yoke's On Me, The Chocolate Chase, and Daffy Flies North, with exclusive bridging sequences with Daffy and the always-unseen/-unknown cartoonist! The shorts were later seen individually in theatres, then on TV as single shorts again! This whole special can be seen on DVD now, not only in volume 6 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection, but also in the Essential Daffy Duck set!

7824282,2,630230332X,"This TV special contains 3 segments, later edited into the separate cartoon shorts ""Daffy Flies North"", ""The Chocolate Chase"" and ""The Yolks on You"". These are interesting, but if you don't like the 1960's DePatie/Freleng Warner cartoons, stay as far away from this as possible. The best of the segments is ""The Yolk's On You"", in which a hen in Foghorn Leghorn's egg farm cannot lay good eggs. She lays a gold egg, but thinks she's [messed] up again, and discards it. A homeless Sylvester the cat and Daffy Duck fight over it. in ""Daffy Flies North"", the duck can't seem to get a saddle on a horse, and in ""The Chocolate Chase"", we get to see possibly one of the worst WB cartoons of all time, in which a badly drawn Speedy Gonzales tries to make a deal with Daffy Duck's chocolate factory to give the little Mexican mouse kids their chocolate easter bunnies. Ironically, this cartoon has not been seen on television for a long time, and this is currently the only way to see it. Check this video out only if you're brave, it's not at all the classic Looney Tunes we know and love.",990835200,7,1082,4.46969696969697
