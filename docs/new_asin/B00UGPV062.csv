8706262,2,B00UGPV062,"Bob goes to Paris to get rights to a play. While pursuing a beautiful blonde, he is pursued by assassins. This is a typical Bob Hope comedy with many corny one-liners and a few lines that are genuinely funny. Add two beautiful girls and another comedian to play off of, and youve got a moviea weak one, though. Sub par entertainment here.",1485820800,,338,4.467741935483871
