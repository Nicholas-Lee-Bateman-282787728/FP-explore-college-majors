8226061,5,B000WYMWFA,I've watched multiple DVD's of hunting videos.  This is a pure stand out!  It doesn't just show folks shooting game over and over and nothing else.  It truly goes into the prep work involved and the strategies used and even why they are doing it the way they are doing it.  Great transitional nails from topic to topic and doesn't leave anything not addressed.  The DVD is 3 hours and 45 minutes long by the way.  I'm so impressed I'm going to look at ordering some of Boddingtons other videos.  Maybe Cape Buffalo or the African Experience are on the top of my list so far.  You won't be disappointed!,1368316800,,602,4.409090909090909
8226062,4,B000WYMWFA,"Hello,

This book is a good read.  Leopard hunting is one of the most like/dislike forms of hunting in Africa.  Mr. Boddington does a good job of discussing them.  If you have ever hunted leopard or are considering hunting this great cat then you will enjoy this book.  As always, Mr. Boddington makes the reader feel that he really believes what he is writing.

Thanks",1273363200,2,369,4.6
