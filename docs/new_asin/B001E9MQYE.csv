8297228,5,B001E9MQYE,"My wife and I have been missionaries in Latin America for 33 years. Our main area of work has been discipleing and training youth and leaders interdenominationally. Winkie is one of the major spiritual FATHERS of contemporary youth ministry in the world today. He's an incredibly enjoyable communicator. You'll laugh and cry as God transforms and empowers your life for prayer and service. I'm inclined to agree with ""IA's"" review... Study these messages and turn the world right-side-up. Worth every penny!!",1262131200,,508,5.283950617283951
8297229,5,B001E9MQYE,"This series practically sums up Winkie Pratney's life work. Don't bother with Seminary, just buy this and watch it, watch it, watch it. It is absolutely life changing material. I can not recommend the 21CR series enough. If I could have only one teaching series other than the Bible itself, it would without any doubt be this. Get it!!",1219363200,2,335,4.694915254237288
