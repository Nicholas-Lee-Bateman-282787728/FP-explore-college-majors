793453,3,6304145586,This movie was ok.  Not the greatest acting except for the lady star in it.  A close watching of the movie may reveal some disconnects in the presentation of the plot.  See if you can find them if you watch the movie.  There is some nudity and sex in the movie so be ready for it.  I probably would not have watched this movie if I had known the above.,1426032000,,352,3.9714285714285715

793532,5,6304145586,"A pleasant surprise. A pre-chunky William Forsythe gives an excellent performance. Kari Wuhrer is a great actress. The plot involves various bad guys trying to find the money that Ray (Forsythe) stole. Rita (Wuhrer) picks up Ray from prison at the direction of the bad guys, but falls for Ray. A great little gem of a movie.",1406678400,,324,4.701754385964913
793533,4,6304145586,"Good drama about a convict who leaves prison and hooks up with a call girl while he works to locate a cache of money and weapons buried in the Southwest desert. Character development is limited, but the story moves right along fueled by sex and violence as the convict and his new-found girlfriend fight off his enemies.",1405468800,,320,4.631578947368421
793534,2,6304145586,"This is one of those movies where sex is first and foremost.  Then the lies and the misleading situations and the film shot of the female anatomy, which the male cameramen seems to think only MEN are watching!  I hate that!!",1401235200,,224,4.439024390243903
793535,2,6304145586,"This would be a one star rating if it wasn't for some awesome breast scenes.  Movie is full of editing bloopers.  Car is dirty then it's not, then dirty again all in the same drive, etc...",1388707200,,188,4.194444444444445
793536,5,6304145586,"I had the chance to see this on Netflix and the only reason I saw it was because of the Corvette(Looks like an 90'.-sometimes though the wheel cap is missing (1990),other times it looks to have one(1988-89,maybe they used an extra similar vette but goofed like in the Movie Passenger 57).Regardless,the Movie,the acting is terrible. But The Car which is in a lot of scenes performed wonderfully. The movie is typical latenight skinamax fare,Had potential but the only highlight is the car.",1343088000,,489,4.975609756097561

793695,3,6304145586,"This movie is nothing but fun. All the things you would expect in a film of this ""caliber"". An ex-con named Elvis, a hot girl in a red corvette, hidden money, bad buys, and violence. Kari Wuhrer plays her typical part, which means hot and occasionally topless. William does the best ""tough guy"" he can. Part lust story, part vegas drama. It also includes the classic line ""You've been bought, let's get it on"".",1054339200,,410,4.554054054054054
793696,4,6304145586,"I caught this movie a few months back on HBO, I was expecting it to be a T&A fest but it wasn't. It is funny in parts, though the story is thin this movie will still entertain you.",964396800,,180,3.763157894736842

7862936,3,6304145586,Beyond Desire is an action packed film about revenge and payback.  William Forsythe and Kari Wuhrer are good in this film.  I would recommend it for all you Kari Wuhrer fans.,1481241600,,174,4.580645161290323

7862938,2,6304145586,"Not my kind of movie. Didn't finish it. I guess I just didn't care for any of the characters. It was OK with me if they all got shot. For every bad guy there has to be a good guy, right?",1475107200,,186,3.5609756097560976
