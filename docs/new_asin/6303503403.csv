Myths boil down to more than the common connotation of old fairy tales. They are like universal human engrams we don't create. They are within us. They are part of all humanity and have been since time immemorial. Like the number of times the human heart beats, the story of the hero -- the same hero, with a different name, in every culture since the dawn of man.
Joseph Cambell has an equal depth of understanding of religions and beliefs the world over. With this knowledge he is able to correlate startling similarities of myths held by disparate cultures thousands of miles or thousands of years apart.
He will blow you away and you will, like me, find in him a guru.",1029283200,,792,4.394557823129252
7849023,5,6303503403,"Scholar (and former Roman Catholic) Joseph Campbell really throws down the gauntlet to the Christians. Make no mistake about it. There is a wide, *seemingly* insuperable gulf between Campbell's scholarship and contemporary blind faith in vicarious atonement through the Maitreya Buddha, or the Christ, or the prophet which Douglas Adams conjures up in the restaurant at the end of the universe. That said, this gulf is bridged by knowledge, and that Campbell provides in abundance. Campbell maintains that ""getting stuck with the metaphor"" in a religion is the root of all evil; every thoughtful religious devotee likely agrees.

C: The story is that Jesus ascended bodily to Heaven. That his mother,  while still asleep, ascended bodily to Heaven. You don't have to get rid of it - you just have to figure out what it's saying.
M: What do *you* think it's saying ?
C: That he ascended through the INWARD spaces, which is what you must do, too.
M: But aren't you undermining the classical Christian doctrine of the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ prefiguring our own, and overcoming death through a higher spiritual truth?
C: Well, *that* is what I would call a mistaken reading of the symbol. That's reading it in terms of prose instead of  poetry. That's reading a metaphor in terms of the DEnotation, instead of the CONnotation.

Metaphor or no, Moyers and Campbell also have a good time reading creation stories from around the globe, and observing similarities. For example, Campbell observes that in most cultures, the snake is positive, and that when one encounters a mythology which regards the serpent as evil, ""that amounts to a refusal to affirm life"".

It is worth pointing out to potential buyers that Joseph Campbell, while a great scholar, was an immense heretic. He asserted God never has spoken to man, and hence by Campbell's logic it follows the Bible simply is a collection of engaging fiction and edifying myths. While his view of religion certainly has abundant pedagogical value if one is inclined to read the Bible as literature, his view has zero theological value. None. Whatever. What Campbell delivers is an excellent course in Humanities - certainly not a course in serious theological reasoning.",968112000,5,2235,5.02972972972973
7849024,5,6303503403,"Starting with creation myths, Joseph Campbell and Bill Moyers explore the ways in which our mythological systems set up a culture's entire way of viewing the universe and our relationship to life within it.  Whether we  live at one with nature, or whether we see ourselves primarily struggling  against it or within it.
In the previous video, ""The Power of  Myth"" Moyers acted more as a prompter for Cambell's extemporaneous  associational performance.  Here in ""The Message of the Myth"" the  dynamic between Moyers and Campbell really works to create a conversation  between the mythology of western thought which Moyers brings out, and the  mythologies of other cultures which Campbell brings out.  At times I wish  that Moyers would have participated even more in this video, but he seems  to have occasionally been rendered mute by some sort of awe that he has for  Campbell.  Regardless, Moyers provided more of an appreciably creative role  in this video.
Once again, Campbell zeroes in on the metaphorical  signifiers within the mythology as the important messages that they give  us.  He sees more literal readings of the mythology as revealing physical  truths to be a literary mistake, as he says reading poetry as if it were  prose.  Instead of dwelling on the realities of a hereafter, Campbell  proceeds thusly, ""Eternity isn't some later time, eternity isn't a  long time, eternity has nothing to do with time, eternity is that dimension  of here and now, which thinking and time cuts out. This is it.  If you  don't get it here, you won't get it anywhere, and the experience of  eternity right here and now is the function of life.""  I found myself  really appreciating this more common sense and this-worldly approach to  religion and mythology.
What Campbell places at the center of the  metaphorical system seems to be an inherent duality at the base of our  conceptual system which permeates our language.  Campbell switches between  the goal of transcending this duality, and the goal of successfully living  within a system of such duality.  Later he says this squarely in  psychological and bodily terms by saying that dreams and myths are the  manifestations of inner conflicts within us, even bringing it down to the  conflicts between different organs.  Here his thoughts became for me  clearly reminiscent of the later day thoughts and revelations of Lakoff and  Johnson in ""Philosophy in the Flesh"".
Campbell also challenges  us to create new myths appropriate to our challenges today. ""What the  myth has to provide, on this immediate level of pedagogical life  instruction, it has to give life models, and the models have to be  appropriate to the possibilities of the time in which you are living.""  He makes some still-relevant issues about our relationship to our  machines, which we can easily extend into issues relating to ourselves and  the imminence of human genetic engineering today.  We need to understand  that when we alter our fundamental physiological makeup, we are potentially  altering the very basis for understanding our language, metaphors and  myths.  Perhaps we should pause for a better mythological understanding of  our place in this time, before venturing too far down that path.",958521600,2,3235,5.070610687022901
