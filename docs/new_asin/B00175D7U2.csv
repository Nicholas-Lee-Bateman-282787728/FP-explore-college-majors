3167266,4,B00175D7U2,"Informative, useful, and I suspect inadvertently, hugely entertaining.

Burt Rutan, looking a little like Mike Nesmith of The Monkees fame, complete with cows lick, explains and demonstrates moldless composite layup techniques with elan, enthusiasm and authority as does Mike Melvill, despite dressing like a Blue Peter presenter (venerable UK children's TV show). Mike's crisp South African vowels constrast with Burt's rather more laid back drawl.

It becomes clear through the course of the video, just how skilled they both are, as well as how well they work together as a team.

Admittedly though, presenting to camera directly does not appear to be Burt's strong suit, in the introduction to the video and the roundup at the end, he has a hunted look in his eye as he reads the prescripted inspirational blurb. Frankly, it wasn't needed, the very real enthusiasm for the subject shone through as soon as both men got their hands dirty.

The viewer will be left informed and enthused, despite production values akin to an eigthies amateur porn video.

This, to my knowledge at least, is still some of the best source material for any composite homebuilder, despite being around thirty years old.",1267747200,7,1200,5.1020408163265305

8264803,3,B00175D7U2,Shipping was fine but unfortunately this cd is about a 5th generation copy and the quality of the recording is poor.  On the plus side the info I wanted concerning how to work fiberglass was discernible so the cd served its purpose for me.,1481500800,,239,4.431818181818182
8264804,3,B00175D7U2,"I AM REALLY SORRY ABOUT THAT  REVIEW, BECAUSE RUTAN IS THE THE BEST, BUT THE QUALITY OF THE VIDEO IS REALLY VERY BAD. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE DETAILS MORE CLEAR AND NOT IN LOW DEFINITION AND WITH PROBLEMS WHEN RUNNING. I COULD NOT RUN THE DVD ON MY COMPUTER BUT ONLY ON DVD CONSOLE. SORRY RUTAN !!!!!. YOU SHOULD GIVE THIS VIDEO AWAY FREE ON THE INTERNET, BECAUSE OF THE LOW QUALITY.",1471996800,,383,4.175675675675675

8264806,5,B00175D7U2,Video came on time. Quality is not god. It is long time ago made video converted to DVD standard.,1447545600,,97,4.157894736842105
8264807,5,B00175D7U2,"This video is a companion to Burt's book Moldless Composite Sandwich Aircraft Construction.  As such, I think that you should buy both at the same time since the video covers some things that the book does not.  Even though both the book and the video were done several yeas ago, most of the information is still relevant yet. Since a picture is worth a thousand words, the video is necessary to fully understand what he is doing.  The strength test of a composite construction versus and aluminum structure, at the beginning of the material is a little on the comedic side but other than that it is very useful.  I recommend it, with the book.",1438732800,,644,4.573913043478261
8264808,5,B00175D7U2,Very good!,1405123200,,10,4.5
8264809,5,B00175D7U2,"This is a somewhat dated looking but very informative video that covers the basics of composite foam and fiberglass construction. If you are building a new plane, curious about methods or just collect skill knowledge, this video is for you. The information contained is well worth the reasonable price.",1403308800,,302,5.183673469387755
8264810,4,B00175D7U2,"It does not go into more advanced modern methods, but it covers the tried and true construction methods. I was a little disappointed it did not spend more time on the repair processes. You must remember this was taped in the late 70's or early 80's.",1402185600,,249,4.434782608695652
8264811,4,B00175D7U2,"I do reccomend it a lot, it will save a lot of time during your construction following the pieces of adive given.",1394409600,,113,4.181818181818182
8264812,4,B00175D7U2,"Building Rutan Composites, despite being 30 years old and the video quality not the best, is a very useful tool to have in building composite aircraft. Ideally, this DVD should be used in conjunction with Moldless Composite Sandwich Aircraft Construction by Burt Rutan. Combining the 2 together, gives the novice kit builder a better understanding of the correct techniques to ensure your kit aircraft is 100% safe.

Buy the book and DVD together, watch, read and learn about composite layups. Then purchase the training kit listed in the front of the book and have a go. Its cheaper than doing a composite course!",1296777600,3,614,4.961165048543689
