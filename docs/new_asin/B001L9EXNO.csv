3682675,3,B001L9EXNO,"As my title suggests, this disc should have been the special features included with the 'Friday the 13th Box-Set', but it was released a week before the remake's release to cash in on the hype(my conspiracy). Tom Savini, Special Effects extraordinaire, hosts the hour and a half documentary taking the viewer through the history of the franchise via in-person interviews with the films' actors,producers,directors as well as others in the horror movie/entertainment business. The pace of the film is pretty quick, interviews are kept at 'key point only' answers with interludes by Savini to introduce the next topic or film; surprisingly film footage is kept at a minimum due to very in depth descriptions from those interviewed; alot of production photos are used to compliment their stories. Alot of what's said is repeated from the 'Box-Set interviews' about certain production stories(refer to my title), so their will be redundant dialogue to be heard. Definite rent for fans of the franchise and horror movies alike; replay value is a little low due to the very conservative, A&E channel-esque set up of the film, with the exception of Savini's parts. Enjoy-",1233878400,,1164,5.164021164021164
3682676,4,B001L9EXNO,"Just as Charlie Chaplin is remembered for his oversized shoes and endearing form of slapstick comedy, one man is notorious among fans and church groups as the hockey-masked villain of the Friday the 13th series of films. Through the course of over ten sequels, he has slashed, stabbed, chopped, mutilated, strangled, and decapitated countless teenagers. His name was Jason....and now this new retrospective DVD set is here to give us an insight into one of the most famous movie franchises of all time.

While watching this documentary, you'll notice just how many actors and crew members from the films make an appearance. Everyone from Betsy Palmer to Amy Steel to Kane Hodder to Larry Zerner show up, fondly recalling their encounters with our beloved madman. Even the actors who played some of the most odd or obscure characters are here, like Stu Charno (Ted, the lanky jokester who somehow survived part 2). Diehard fans will squeal in delight at the huge roster on display...I know I did.

Get rid of any concerns that this is a boring, talking head documentary. It is very entertaining and funny, and it moves along at a quick pace. Tom Savini, the special effects wizard who is responsible for Jason's deformed looks and gory demise in Final Chapter, makes for a great and charismatic host. There are also a lot of hilarious stories, like how Warrington Gillette walked into a hospital with a prop machete protruding from his shoulder.

The extras are fantastic as well (including a five-dollar off coupon to see the new film). Extensive interviews with all the directors and all the Jason actors, fan films, a mini-poster, a look at the Final Chapter cabin as it stands today, and much more round out the set. These should keep fans busy for quite a while.

I do have a few complaints, though. I wish there was more discussion and showing of uncensored death scenes, but I did love seeing stills of part 3's infamous alternate ending. Also, I was hoping some people would talk more than they did....and why on Earth was that guy from Psyche on here? More from Rob Hedden, Lar Park Lincoln or Paul Kratka would be nice.

Overall, this is a great buy for any fan of the Friday the 13th films. Also, look for the documentary on the Halloween films which came out in 2005. They're pretty similar.

3682677,5,B001L9EXNO,"I watched this documentary on Tuesday and enjoyed everything to it. It was neat to know the whole history of the movie franchise, and it's upcoming remake. The special features to this DVD was also very good to watch.

3682678,5,B001L9EXNO,"I was frankly disappointed in the documentary 'His Name Was Jason' itself. It is a great introduction for new fans or those that don't know much about the character, but it's basically what long time fans have heard all before. What makes this DVD are the special features, tons of interviews and returns to site locations. This is why you should buy the DVD more than the Doc. You get a real insight and new stories. The Fan Films are also great, I personally love the Freddy vs. Jason Bunnies! If this DVD just had the documentary, this would have a lower score, but the extras are way worth buying!",1233792000,2,601,4.472727272727273
3682679,3,B001L9EXNO,"Being a lifelong Jason/Friday The 13th fan I was thrilled to pick up this set, but I have to say it was not as good as I hoped it would be. I expected more scenes from the movies and less still pictures. Anchor Bay did go all out to interview many of the films stars through the years but they just jumped thru the movies too fast. The documentary is only 90 minutes long, it could have easily been 3 hours long and it really should have. I definite must to own for the true horror fan (like me) but I would suggest a rental first before purchase, most people will only need to see this once..",1233705600,3,593,4.076923076923077

3682681,5,B001L9EXNO,"Let's face it, Friday the 13th was the slasher that broke the mold. Paramount's [...] child, that year after made way more cash than the films cost to make. (Saw would be the latter day films series that has dropped a sequel faithfully every year)
This documentary is so comprehensive. In fact, I recommend this to any movie fan who loves a good documentary period. ""His Name was Jason"", finally honors the fans and the many people who made a ""potboiler"" film into an iconic cash cow franchise, with fans the world over. This film made me just as excited as when my older cousin sneaked  me into these films as a kid. Spot on. The extra's alone put Paramount's box set to shame. I highly recommend this as a lovely Valentines gift for the Jason Voorhees fan in your life.",1233014400,4,771,4.468085106382978
3682682,5,B001L9EXNO,"At last the complete history of one of the greatest horror icons, the infamous Friday the 13th serial killer JASON VOORHEES is finally here.
 Like the Halloween 25 years of terror this is another great Documentairy which tells the story of the most scary boogeyman in cinema's history in my humble opinion.
 The friday the 13th series consisted of 12 films (including the upcoming remake) and grossed over $500 millions worldwide (not counting dvd/video rental and sales and merchantise sales) and the title FRIDAY THE 13TH is known EVEN TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT HORROR MOVIES.
 Yes, Sean cunninghum succeeded to create back in 1980 the first SLASHER film which was so successful as it spawned so many sequels and copycats films (only the james bond franchise (23 films), the godzilla franchise (29 films) and the zatoichi franchise (27 films) spawned more sequels than F13).
 There have been previous attempts prior to 1980 in the slasher genre with classics like the texas chainsaw massacre (1974) the hills have eyes (1977) and Halloween (1978) BUT FRIDAY THE 13TH WAS THE FIRST EVER SLASHER FILM WHICH DONE IT WITH SO PURITY and the golden era of those horror slasher films begun after 1980.
 This dvd have pics from all 11 F13 films, interviews, photos, commentairies and so many other extras which will satisfy all the fanatic F13 fans and is being released 10 days before the premierre of the 12th F13 ""remake"" film called just FRIDAY THE 13TH which is released in FRIDAY THE 13TH OF FEBRUARY 2009 AT A HORROR THEATER NEAR YOU. JASON IS COMING FOR YOU AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE JASON'S NEW BLOODY ADVENTURES but 10 days earlier we will have this brand new dvd documentairy called HIS NAME WAS JASON (and the rest is bull).",1226880000,7,1738,4.760797342192691

3682684,3,B001L9EXNO,"I have been a huge Friday the 13th fan since I was kid. I enjoying learning as much about the series as I can which is why I ordered this DVD. This documentary was really disappointing though. It felt very rushed and did not get into much detail about the movies. This could easily just be an extra feature thrown onto one of the DVDs or Blu-rays.

Admittedly, I have been spoiled by the Crystal Lake Memories documentary. If you want a more expanded documentary on the Friday the 13th then buy that instead. You get 2 disks with in-depth discussion of each movie.",1474329600,,564,4.423076923076923

I checked out this doc based on the stellar work the same filmmakers did a couple of years later for the documentary ""Never Sleep Again"" about the Nighmare on Elm Street franchise. This earlier movie finds them still learning how to do this process, and as a result, it's a weaker film.

But yeah, this was a real neat trip down memory lane, Tom Savini was a real cool host with the whole viginette going on along with it. This has a lot of the stars from the films as well as the crew, it was real neat to hear their stories, plus it was nice to see some of them replay their scenes, and some fun gags like the hitchhiker being surrounded by bananas during her interview.

Unlike many of these horror documentaries I've been seeing lately I was very happy they didn't try to make a bunch of political nonsense out of all of this, why that is happening all of sudden I don't know, I mean seriously, does anyone go see low-budget slasher films for political commentary? Anyhow, this was very entertaining and it was a good price too. Lot's of fun for fans of the series.",1368403200,2,853,4.265432098765432

3682715,5,B001L9EXNO,"This was a fun dvd that left me wanting more. I felt disappointed because The Nightmare on Elm Street Documentary was like six hours long and covered everything about the movies. Here we have about twenty minutes going through each movie and the plot. It was fun to see that they tracked down almost all the cast members to comment on the movies. You hear interesting stories from the characters about the films. There are fans of the series like Seth Green and Adam Green who directed Hatchet talking about the series. I liked seeing Amy Steel who was the best Final Girl in the series in my opinion. It's nice to see how much these actors enjoyed being apart of the series and what it did for them. The actor who played Shelly talks about having the honor of bringing the mask into the cabin where Jason kills him and takes his mask creating Jason in Part 3. It was funny to see the fans joke about some of the bad Friday the 13th's.
  You learn a lot about the history of the franchise but I wish it was more like the Nightmare on Elm Street Documentary because I think Jason deserves just as much time being discussed. A true slasher or Jason fan will love the part where they show Jason's greatest kills. It was cool it was hosted by Tom Savani. It had a very creative way of narrating the story. Reenacting parts of the movies before each interview with a cast member. It was great to see Betsy Palmer. It was cool how they showed how they went about doing the makeup and kills. It's great to hear from Kane Hodder. I hope if they do a Freddy vs Jason 2 he could play Jason again. The documentary runs about an hour and half. I think most fans will be pleased with that. Have a great day and enjoy!",1359331200,2,1704,4.272445820433436

Every movie is included! Even if some (I won't name them out of fear of offending you guys) probably could have been excluded without much an outcry from anyone. The part I loved the most is that there was an actor, from each film, talking about his/her experiences. The personal touch gave the documentary heart. And Tom Savini serving as host, and tour guide (if you will) was spot-on and sensational! The extras are pretty cool too. There's one entitled ""Shelly Lives"" which is an absolute riot! I won't say more out of fear of giving away spoilers, but it's definitely worth a mention. The documentary itself is beyond entertaining! In fact, it left me wanting more! So much MORE!!!! I would be thrilled to see a documentary like this for every film in the series. Well... almost every film. lol. True fans should get the exclusions. At the end of the day, this 2 disc DVD is everything you could want, and much, MUCH MORE from a Friday the 13th documentary! Trust me! I'm a REAL fan! One who truly loves Friday the 13th and everything associated with it! Not to say that I went in to this thinking it would rock because it was about my all-time favorite horror movie killer Jason. I went into it with an open mind, and as a fan I was pleased. So enjoy this great documentary from the classic Friday the 13th series! I know I did! I just want to say thank you to the writers, producers, cast, everyone else involved in this production, and most of all... thank you Jason. Without whom, none of this would be possible.

3682719,3,B001L9EXNO,"F13 fans greatly prefer Crystal Lake Memories instead of this documentary. His Name Was Jason does leave one wanting more. The Ultimate Retrospective on F13? Tom Savini is great as the host but not all of his scenes work. They bring back an impressive amount of former cast and crew but they only get to speak for about a minute each. It isn't nearly as in-depth as it could have been been since it had the official blessing of Paramount. Don't expect it to look like Never Sleep Again. The Friday the 13th reboot is also plugged a bit too much (that doesn't work out). The music can be distracting and the inclusion of Friday fans too early in the feature disrupts the flow of it (notably Seth Green and some dudes I saw in the Psycho Legacy). It could have been helped by a score during Savini's scenes with some better writing for him. We want to see more of Betsy Palmer and Kane Hodder but instead we get insiders and fans. However, it is enjoyable and fun for fans of the franchise. I have watched it a few times but I do cringe during certain segments. Some good trivia throughout (e.g. Jason running, Jason getting the mask) with some interesting behind the scenes info.

3682722,3,B001L9EXNO,"I've been reading some negative fan reaction to this stating that it comes across more as a promotional tool for the  FRIDAY remake rather than an in-depth overview of the series' production, like what Anchor Bay did with HALLOWEEN, and I can understand the fans' frustrations. For someone like myself who isn't well-versed in the series, it's a decent primer with the first 15-20 minutes recapping the storyline movie to movie. Some folks are even attacking the editing which feels like its geared towards those suffering from ADHD with its rapidfire soundbites strung together with quick clips from the series. Herein lies the biggest flaw of the film - its crazy randomness. As far as documentaries go, this is one you experience rather than learn from. The talking heads, for the most part, reminisce fondly about their personal experiences on set and its hard not to share their enthusiasm (the quick pace rarely gives viewers a chance not to). If this truly is meant as a promotional fluff piece, then it certainly serves its purpose well as I'm now interested in revisiting the series and the remake. Only occassionally does director Daniel Farrands get to any real meat by hinting at the on-set strife during the various productions. It would have been nice to show more of this sort of reality, and certainly would have made for a more interesting movie. The second disc is a complete blast with all the fun extras, especially those fanfilms - something I'd like to see more of. It was also interesting to see the writers discuss their approaches to the material without being reduced to soundbites (similarly to the longer interviews with the various Jasons on disc 1), you get a stronger sense of who everyone is and where they're coming from. Overall verdict, if you're a diehard, you might want to skip the rent as it apparently offers little new information, but casual fans like myself might want to give HIS NAME IS JASON a peak just to brush up.",1303862400,,1962,4.804733727810651

3682724,3,B001L9EXNO,"I agree with many other folks that the herky-jerky editing is the main problem with this documentary; there is nowhere near the in-depth analysis here that is evident in the highly enjoyable sister doc, Never Sleep Again (the really good one about the Nightmare on Elm Street series). It's still fun to see some of the old cast members reminiscing about old times (I always in particular liked ""Vera"" from Part III and was happy to see her pop up for a few seconds here and there before the ADD-addled editors cut to something else); it's funny to hear how much affection some of the actors have for these movies in which their parts consisted mainly of playing some teenaged stereotype who sooner or later has their throat cut, their eyeballs squeezed out, or receives an axe in the face. The Friday movies were considered pretty sleazy trash back in their heydey, and I've always considered them as such (they have nowhere near the imagination and inventiveness of the Nightmare on Elm Street flicks), but they are trashy *Fun* and the first two I think are definite classics of their kind, with memorable Final Girls, some real scares and suspense, and of course Mrs. Voorhees (""Kill her mommy! Kill her!""). I just wish the makers of this documentary had been able to slow down a bit and let people talk; there is also a real lack of film clips that last more than 10 seconds, another huge debit for obvious reasons. Two other complaints: as good a makeup and gore artisan as he is, Tom Savini's hosting comes off as a bit smarmy to me, and the final 5 minutes or so devoted to hyper-hyping the turns-out-it's-lousy 2009 remake seems in retrospect rather disengenuous. The best part of this final segment is that it really does make me want to revisit a bunch of the originals soon, whereas I never ever ever need to sit through the bland + unnecessary remake again.

His Name Was Jason offers the occasional interesting morsel of information for people interested about the films, but mainly consists of the interviewees talking about how great and underappreciated the series is; if you go in looking for behind the scenes information, as I did, you'll almost certainly be disappointed during the unending sequences of self-aggrandizing indulgence.

3682734,4,B001L9EXNO,"This is a documentary that chronicles thirty years of Friday the 13th. It has the cast, directors, writers, and journalists all talking discussing respective films they were in, helped create, or were inspired by and are sandwiched between clips of the films being discussed at the time. It gives you an idea of what it was like behind the scenes as stories are told about difficulties during a particular scene or film, how the idea for something originally came to fruition, to what they did in between takes, actors getting sick during particular scenes, etc. Spanning twelve films and three decades, this is a must own for any Friday the 13th fan.

I heard this isn't really anything new for the die hard F13 fans as it's basically a video version of Peter Bracke's Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th book. Since I hadn't read the book, this was mostly new material for me.  As informative and excellent as the documentary is, the extras are what most fans have been raving about. The second disc is filled with a lot of segments they only touched on in the full-length documentary along with a lot of other goodies including interviews with writers and directors, fan films, discussions about plotholes, bad acting, etc, Joseph Zito and Eric Anderson walking you through the house they used in The Final Chapter, Friday the 13th in four minutes, a panel at Comic-Con, a survival guide to surviving Camp Blood, and more. There are several hours worth of material on the second disc and really make this an excellent addition to any fan of the franchise.

3682735,3,B001L9EXNO,"I really enjoyed ""His Name Was Jason"", let me state that right up front. As a child of the 80's I grew up going to the ""Friday"" films with my brother, and still watch the franchise on DVD regularly. With that said, I was hoping for a little more from this documentary.
The main attraction of this 2 disk set is the 90 minute documentary which brings back cast and crew of the various films to discuss each entry. Also invited along for the trip are some head-scratchingly unrelated ""celebrities"" like Seth Green of ""Robot Chicken"" and some guy from the TV show ""Psych""?? Not quite sure why they would be considered an ""authority"" on ""Friday the 13th"".
Basically, Tom Savini introduces several topics while walking through a faux Crystal Lake setting, and various cast and crew members chime in with their thoughts on the various topics. (It's fun watching some of these folks take themselves and their parts in the films way too seriously!!) For the most part it's a fun little trip, and serves better as a ""where are they now"" sort of thing. I loved seeing Amy Steel, Betsy Palmer, Kane Hodder and other series favorites again. But to be honest, if you are looking for an in-depth, behind the scenes documentary, you won't really find it here. The film is fun, and if it were included as an extra in the upcoming release of the 2009 ""Friday the 13th"" DVD, it would have been perfect. But when you are paying more for a documentary on a film series than you would for a DVD entry of the series itself it seems a bit odd?
If you are a huge ""Friday"" fan, I recommend you at least rent ""His Name was Jason"", it's a fun quick look at the series. But I HIGHLY recommend Peter Bracke's ""Crystal Lake Memories"" hardcover book. Bracke's book goes into much greater detail on each of the films from the original through ""Freddy vs. Jason"", extensive interviews with cast and crew, as well as studio heads, critics and fans. Maybe if I hadn't read ""Memories"" first I would have been more thrilled with ""His Name Was Jason"", but when the series was so captivatingly captured as it was in ""Crystal Lake Memories"", it's tough for anything to compete.",1237852800,12,2137,4.538860103626943
3682736,4,B001L9EXNO,"I was totally psyched when I read that Anchor Bay had compiled a 2 disc set that covered the Friday the 13th series. And I'm a huge 80's horror fan being that I grew up in that era. And Tom Savini is one of my all time favorite special effects guru's and he was the host ! So I am glad to report that the His Name Was Jason set is well worth the time and money spent. If you are a huge mark for the series like myself it gives you some great insights into the origin of the series. Granted if you've read any of the books about the series then you know a lot of this anyhow. But you also get to hear from every films director sans two(Steve Miner and Ronnie Yu )and the series mastermind Sean Cunnigham. There's interviews with a lot of the films victims and heroines such as Adrienne King,Amy Steel and Lar Park Lincoln. Insight from other horror writers and website operators like Uncle Creepy(who's funny as hell btw) from Dread Central and interviews with all the Jason's not just Kane Hodder. What's missing besides Yu and Miner are the ""name stars"" like Kevin Bacon,Crispin Glover and Corey Feldman. They also push the rebooted,retooled,reimagined whatever you want to call it Friday the 13th that was just released and did surprisingly well at the box office. Being a purist that frowns upon all these pointless remakes that have littered the screen this decade I don't care to see it. But if you want to learn a lot about a much maligned series of 12 films(and rightfully so in some cases like all the New Line Cinema films) then you owe it to yourself to watch this dvd set you will not be disappointed.",1237334400,,1612,4.376666666666667

Everyone from the actors, actresses, filmmakers to the various stuntmen who all portrayed the hockey masked killer with the mama issues, Jason, are all interviewed here in depth and sharing how these films changed their lives and the entire 80s horror industry as we all knew it.

3682738,4,B001L9EXNO,"There have always been icons in motion pictures but none more lasting that the icons of horror. A prime example is the Frankenstein monster that has been around since 1910. The monster along with Dracula, the Wolf Man and the Mummy constituted the golden age of horror icons for years. And then suddenly in 1980 a new icon came to life, 2 years after Michael Meyers arrived. His name was Jason.

And that's a great name to title a DVD which Anchor Bay just has. HIS NAME WAS JASON takes a look at the phenomena that is the Friday the 13th Movies. Here I am, just days away from February 13, 2008, a Friday and the release of the latest Friday The 13th film. Not a sequel this time around but a retelling of the story of Jason Voorhees, the malformed child who grew to become a mass murderer.

This film takes a look at each and every film from the past as hosted by make up effects man (who did two of the films) Tom Savini. With a wraparound story of a girl running through the effects laden horror night attraction based on the film at Universal Studios that gets a bit old, Savini takes us on a trip back in time to the various incarnations of Jason.

There are two small pieces that most people don't recall about the first film other than the fact it is over 28 years old. The first is that a young Kevin Bacon was one of the murdered teens in the film, this helping folks playing six degrees from Kevin Bacon. The second is that Jason Voorhees never murders anyone in the film. With the exception of a flashback and a tagged on scare ending, Jason is rarely even seen.

Jason Voorhees didn't start his campaign of terror until the second film. And he didn't wear the infamous hockey mask until the third. But Jason is a name synonymous with the entire series, even though he isn't around for two films (see if you know the second).

The fun thing that this DVD does is take us back to relive each film not in clips (the film is owned by Paramount Pictures and New Line Cinema). Instead we get interviews with past directors, the creators of the series of films and the actors who played victims. Each one recalls a fun time spent at Camp Crystal Lake

Gruesome death scenes are recalled in word and photograph and fun times on the set are spoken of with fondness. Discussions by directors and those who played Jason (including Kane Hodder who has played him the most, an impressive 4 times) are included along with those of the actors. Even composer Harry Manfredini is along for the ride, discussing what is actually heard in the well known scary theme that always lets us know Jason is nearby.

This two disc set is a must have for fans and honestly, the best part is the initial documentary itself. Also found are extended interviews with the actors who have played Jason on disc one. On disc two you find more interview material with actors and directors, short films based on Jason, a Camp Crystal Lake survival guide, numerous other features and perhaps one of my all time favorites, JASON VS FREDDY as performed by bunnies in 30 seconds.. If you've never seen one of the ""performed by bunnies"" films online you're truly missing out on a treat. You'll want to see them all after watching this.

Before you head out to see the new movie grab you popcorn, your favorite soda and that person who you can hide behind when the scary parts come up. Plop in this DVD and get the low down on the Jason Voorhees mania that has come before. It's time for a new generation to know the name of fear.

3682740,3,B001L9EXNO,"Maybe I got a little too excited and expected too much of this when I first heard about it being released.
After watching it now, I feel a little disappointed in what is on these 2 discs.

The feature presentation had some great inside knowledge I did not know about the franchise, but there was something very nauseating about the editing/cutting between 10 people's interviews in a few seconds that was giving me a headache by the time it finished.

""The Men Behind The Mask"": Was pretty much just the full conversation or tellings of stories that where edited up for the feature presentation. I found it a little tiring hearing things again that I had just heard already.

Disc 2

""Final Cuts"": Again, like the Men Behind the mask, the full versions of the directors explinations and ideas ect..same with ""Dragged From The Lake"" & ""Script To Screen"" it was all just a bit too repetitive and not much of it was all that entertaining.

The ""Survival Guide"" is easily forgettable as the casts, producers, writers ect tell you not to do this, and don't do that blah blah blah

""Jason Takes Comic Con"" like in other areas they throw it in, this DVD seems to be a heck of a promotion for the new 2009 Friday The 13th movie, which is good to see, but makes me wonder why this whole thing needs it's own DVD presentation and why it is not future bonus features for the 2009 F13th when it's released on DVD.

""Fan Films"" was really disappointing. There are so many better fan films then the 4 or 5 films selected here.

""Friday The 13th in 4 minutes"" - again, just showing the same interviews before, re-edited to try and explain all 10 of the movies in 4 mins... honestly, zzzzzzzzzzz

And the box says, ""And Much More"".... not really; There is a visit to the Jarvis house from part 4 that is just them saying, ""we filmed this scene here, we filmed that one there"" and another one on the farm from part 3 saying the same stuff... a stupid video by the guy who played Shelly acting as a lawyer for Jason victims and a tour of the Universal Studio attraction of Camp Blood that would be much nicer to have seen what it was rather then someone explaining what happens so people can see it instead of having to travel there to find out it's been burnt out in a fire by the time you get there.

There is also a couple of hidden eggs, but there not worth hunting for let alone telling you what they are.

Sorry, i'm a huge f13th fan, but I found this DVD to be pretty boring at most, too repetitive, and one giant promo for the 2009 movie. The other thing that has made me wonder, I know the documentary is explaining that Jason has become a global phenomenon, but why should I give a toss what the director of Wrong Turn 2 thought about the franchise? Or whoever that annoying girl was who owned a website that I really do want to see Jason slash in half.

Also, I would have liked to see more scenes from the movies, especially when whoever is taking a stroll down memory lane in there interviews instead of just still shot pictures on screen.

I am appreciating the effort gone into making this to find as many cast members, and those involved in the franchise as possible... but I think what the fans really would have loved would be something from the movies they had never seen before... lost footage, on set footage, hand held cameras or something along those lines... hell, even the video clip to Alice Coopers; ""He's Back (the man behind the mask) would have made my day with this DVD, even fan music videos, trivia's or a game maybe?

I highly doubt I will be watching any of it again soon... I don't think anyone can tell me they could honestly watch this DVD over and over again.",1235606400,,3680,4.36896046852123

Having been reviewed many times over let me just say that this 2 DVD set covers many aspects of Jason that fans already know while giving us something new & unexpected. At some interviews I was surprised to hear actors talking negatively about directors (from Part 4), and cast members making fun of themselves. The fan films (or whatever they're called) are an interesting touch as they show us just how people have been affected by the series. Overall, its a great thing to add to your collection.

3682745,5,B001L9EXNO,"Produced and made by the same team that put together 08's Halloween:30 Years Of Terror (30 must be Horror's magical number lately), comes this extensive two disc documentary of the history of one of Horror's most beloved franchises Friday The 13th and it's star Jason Voorhees. It's main feature is an hour an a half reflection on the entire franchise from Pamela to Freddy to remake, one thru 12. Broken up in segments hosted by a somewhat wooden yet honorable Tom Savini, many and most of the stars and filmmakers show up to tell their expierences on making their Friday film, as well as opinions on others they weren't a part of (and sometimes brutally honest) and feelings on Jason himself and his effect on pop-culture. The Savini segments feature an odd but expected choice of all being filmed on the set of the Universal Horror Nights Set of Friday The 13th:Camp Blood, complete with Tom interacting with the park's hired actors getting slain just like in the films. This documentary is a slight improvement on H30 on the fact that most of it's footage comes from it's crew in an intimate one-on-one setting rather than H30's majority convention footage which can be tiresome to watch in one sitting. This main feature is very entertaining and informative, and I myself could see a reviewing of it a little more quickly than with Myers' homage.

As for bonus features, when the box says over 4 Hours, it's not kidding. Not only do you get very extended interviews with pretty much everyone you saw in the feature, you get comical Internet fan films, Comic-Con footage promoting the remake, recaps of Friday's history done in 30 seconds (with bunnies?) and in four fan-spoken minutes, a walk-through of the house used in The Final Chapter, and much, much more. You even get two Easter Eggs of a musical nature, though once you watch them, you might want them to remain hidden. It's a chockful set, complete with a replica poster, embossed slipcover, and even, for I assume a limited time only, a free movie ticket (no online printing needed!) to the remake. There's even a parody laywer commercial reuniting three of the stars of Part Three that's guaranteed to make you smile.

Of course when trying to cover 12 films in 5 hours, there bound to be an omission or two. For one Corey Feldman, one of Jason's biggest rivals Tommy Jarvis, who was more than happy to contribute to the Paramount version enclosed in their boxset, is nowhere to be found. Neither is Kevin Bacon or FVJ director Ronny Yu. Also, even though it seems a miracle a Paramount/New Line owned franchise got honored through Anchor Bay in the first place, there really isn't much footage from the movies here other than a five second clip here and there, not to mention no footage whatsoever of the 2009 remake, of which I'm certain this release was supposed to be coinciding to begin with. Another strange thing is one of the bonus features, a walk-through of the Universal Camp Blood set, only has it's leading designer walking through the unfinished set explaining what you would see here, when they just should have taken the camera in there (ala Back To The Future:The Ride on the reissue DVD) when it was actually running, which that would have been really cool. But for pure recollections and fond memories, these omissions don't cloud an overall great documentary release.

And unlike H30's FullFrame presentation, this time Anchor Bay did it right with an Anamorphic 1.78:1 crisp picture (though at times that ""water-ripple"" effect on every interviewed background does get distracting) and a decent 5.1 audio mix. So, even if you're a casual fan or a Jason groupie like myself, this is one great DVD to be seen and owned. Finally Jason (and his victims!) get the respect they have deserved.

Pros:
*Probably the greatest retrospective Friday The 13th has ever,
or could of ever, been made.
*Surely they won't talk about Jason Goes To Hell or Freddy Vs Jason, right? WRONG! Heck, they even bring up the ""in-name-only"" television series (they coulda left that one out though...)
*Many familiar, yet painfully aged, faces show up to recollect their time with Jason. Man, thank goodness for the names at the bottom of the screen, it's hard to recognize some of them now, but I'm glad they're all here.

Cons:
*Could have used more clips from the actual films. Sure, there ARE clips, but there should have been more.
*This presentation is one HUGE spoiler-alert. If you are a newbie to the franchise and plan on eventually seeing all 11 previous chapters, do NOT watch this first. Each movie's plot (believe it or not) is explained in full.
*Don't expect an impartial reflection from some of these interviewed. If they thought a certain chapter sucked, they are going to tell you. Really tell you....

i agree with other complaints regarding how this is put together. instead of going through the films in chronological order, they jump around from segment to segment (deaths, the looks of jason, etc.). towards the end, they supposedly have a segment tracing all the continuity errors throughout the franchise and while it starts off this way, the segment is quickly brought off topic.

also, regarding the way this was put together: it really has a ""made for t.v."" feel to it with each segment being broken up by some unsolved mystery-esc savini segments which i easily lived without.

there's definitely interesting tid bits scattered throughout, but again... much of what you get here has been covered in one medium or the other over the years.",1234224000,2,1358,4.622406639004149
3682748,5,B001L9EXNO,"Jason Voorhees... a top name in slasher/horror films for 30 years now. In this 90 minute documentary we get interviews from cast members, screenwriters, directors, and websiters on everything Friday the 13th. Hosted by special effects master Tom Savini, we get a nice history of the series and some behind the scenes stuff in addition to the memories. We even finally learn just where Crystal Lake is (near Green Valley, New Jersey as per the store sign in part 3, although it's also part of ""Wessex County"" per the news reports in part 4).

Besides the documentary, and possibly of greater value, are the extra features such as extended interviews with all the actors that portrayed Jason, the directors, the screenwriters, a visit to the sets of part 3 and part 4 as they appear today, and even the Universal Studios horror attraction 'ride' for the movie. All 12 films (including the new one) are covered. There are a few fanboy films and a few other items. Going price on this 2-disc set can be as low as $9.99. Well worth the price.",1234137600,,1037,4.666666666666667
3682749,5,B001L9EXNO,"I received this as an early Valentine's present because the remake is coming out in 5 days, so I wanted to be pumped and ready for it! This documentary is very entertaining and interesting if you love the series and love seeing Jason do his thing! They bring back a lot of the important actors who were in the movies. Even though the women are a little older, they are still beautiful! They talk about how they got the job, how each movie came to be, a little about the remake, etc. I loved the fan film in the bonus features, including Freddy Vs. Jason in 30 seconds with bunnies! If you love Jason Voorhees, and the Friday the 13th series, I highly recommend HIS NAME WAS JASON: 30 YEARS OF FRIDAY THE 13TH!!!",1234051200,9,711,4.313432835820896
3682750,5,B001L9EXNO,"The actual documentary gets **** Out of 5. But ***** overall for the DVD.

His Name Was Jason: 30-Years of Friday the 13th is a must own for fans of the franchise; this documentary on the series was written by Thommy Hutson & Anthony Masi and directed by Daniel Farrands who wrote Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers and hosted by Tom Savini. Due to some of the people involved like Anthony Masi and the fact this was put out by Starz Home Entertainment (using the Anchor Bay name) no doubt people will compare this to Halloween: 25-Years of Terror.

As much as I enjoyed His Name Was Jason it isn't without its flaws. I was hoping this documentary would cover some of the production on the movies, but actually very little of the making of the films are covered and that's where 25-Years of Terror edges it out. For most of the 90-minutes it's various members of the cast and crew and other filmmakers talking about the movies like Jason's psyche and some of the kill scenes. In a sense it's sort of like hanging out with friends talking about the films, which was really cool, but I would have liked to have heard more about the production of the films. The first 10-minutes or so are spent talking about the plots and I thought this documentary might fail. I mean I enjoy the series, but there weren't many plots. The first and third are really the only ones with hint of a plot, but once we get past that His Name Was Jason really picks up.

What I absolutely loved about His Name Was Jason was seeing some of the actors taking part. Some of the actors have done conventions or put themselves out there with interviews for various horror sites, but some of the actors are ones that haven't been heard of since the releases of the films. There were a lot of actors involved and that's what really made this so much fun. My only complaint is too much time was put on Joe Lynch director of Wrong Turn 2, Adam Green director of Hatchet and James Roday star of the TV series Psych. While I loved Hatchet and love Roday on Psych, I do feel too much time was spent with them. First off Lynch and Green were hysterical, but I would rather hear more from the people actually involved.

Like I said most of His Name Was Jason focuses on stuff you would chat with friends about rather than the making of the movies. Shavar Ross who played Reggie in the 5th part mentions how originally he was set to return for the 6th. Obviously that didn't happen since Jason Lives went in a different direction, but it would have been nice if stated what the original idea was. Granted it's not a huge deal, but information like this would have been nice. The documentary was very fun and at times informative, but I hoped for more focus on the production of the movies and there really should have been a lot more focus put on the people involved, but despite these complaints His Name Was Jason truly is a must own for fans and again despite any complaints the fans of these movies will love this documentary flaws and all.

Some people have complained about certain people not being involved, but look this documentary covers every film in the franchise and it would be impossible to get everyone involved. It would have been nice to see Dana Kimmell, Thom Matthews and Corey Feldman, but regardless His Name Was Jason is still great and has at least 1 person per film. Every film in the series has at least 1 person involved so due to that people have to lighten up.

As good as His Name Was Jason was it's the bonus features that really make this DVD so amazing. The DVD is jam packed with bonus features of 4-hours of content and this is how a DVD release should be like. Quite honestly His Name Was Jason would rate as one of my favorite DVDs; Anchor Bay truly did an amazing job at the release.

The 2nd disc has a feature called Final Cuts, which runs at a total of 77-minutes and are extended interviews with all the directors except Steve Miner and Ronny Yu. Neither of them took part in this set and it's quite a shame Steve Miner wasn't involved. Miner directed Part II, which was Jason's debut as the killer and Part 3, which was the first time Jason dons the Iconic hockey mask. When it comes to the franchise Jason and the mask are the first two things that come to mind and I would hate to think Steve Miner thinks he's above the series.

Final Cuts goes into much better detail on the making of the movies and gives pretty good insight. Some of what is said has been stated before, but this goes into pretty good detail about how the movies came about as well as filming them. His Name Was Jason was shot in 2008 and at that time some of the films ranged from 15-years old to 28-years old so it's understandable that certain details might be forgotten, but this is what the actual documentary should have been like. Again some of this stuff may have been stated before, but it was an excellent feature and really gives excellent insight.

From Script to Screen runs at 31-minutes and has interviews with Victor Miller writer of the original, Barney Cohen writer of the Final Chapter, Todd Farmer writer of Jason X and Damien Shannon & Mark Swift writers of Freddy Vs Jason and Friday the 13th 09. This is another solid feature, which gives excellent insight to the actual writing of the movies.

But my favorite features were Fox Comes Home, which runs at just under 4-minutes and features Gloria Charles who played Fox in part 3 she was a member of the biker gang and in this feature Gloria Charles walks around the filming locations of part 3 and at the end she recites one of her famous lines. Closing the Book on the Final Chapter runs at 12-minutes and features Erich Anderson who played Rob and director Joseph Zito.

This feature like Fox Comes Home is walking around the filming locations and even includes the Jarvis house as it looks now and that was really cool to see. This feature gives some really excellent insight to the making of the movie and again this is what the actual documentary should have been like.

Shelly Lives features Larry Zerner in character and was a laugh riot! This feature is bound to put a smile on the faces of the viewer and since Shelly was such a beloved character it makes this feature even better.

Overall His Name Was Jason: 30-Years of Friday the 13th is hands down one of the very best DVDs ever released. The documentary was very solid, but it's the bonus features that make this release so amazing. Fans of the series will no doubt enjoy the documentary and will love the bonus features; this is a must own for all Friday the 13th fans.

There are a lot more features on this DVD, but too many to review all of them, but trust me this DVD is worth every penny.",1233964800,24,6709,4.404358353510895
3682751,5,B001L9EXNO,"A short and sweet review. Covers all bases from writers, actors, directors, and even horror fans. Covered every single Friday movie from the Paramount days to the New Line take over and even covers the new Friday. I found myself at awe hearing all the great and sometimes scary tales...the highlight is the sad and scary as hell King's (Alice) stalker story. This lets us know why she dissapeared from the spotlight and is now making a comeback. Sure it sucks to see some of the main people missing...to the obvious, Kevin Bacon....to the surprising...Steve Miner and even Feldman, Tom Matthews and Cripen Glover. But for those who did show, they put on a hell of show with their stories of the past and sometimes showing us where they have been. Great documentary....even better extras. Bravo to all involved. Now lets see Nightmare on elm street next!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1233964800,2,866,4.8979591836734695
3682752,4,B001L9EXNO,"This documentary offers nothing new on Friday The 13th. Its a good overview of the series but it felt like it has been done before. There are a few new additions towards the end that are fun to watch. The extras like The Guys Who Play Jason, The Shelly law firm, and The Angry Video Game Nerd are good. I recommend this to Friday fans because its cheap and enjoyable overall. The music on the main menus on both discs seem way out of place and I have no idea why they put it on.

Also, I wish they'd stop screwing around and put Kane Hodder back as Jason. I know they had different four other actors as Jason (not counting part one and five) but he did the best Jason. Bring him back!",1233878400,2,684,4.104477611940299

8317694,2,B001L9EXNO,"This documentary, while fun and entertaining enough, has the same problem as a lot of others coming out today: it's self-indulgent, has no real narrative or structure, doesn't really have anything to say, and ultimately goes nowhere. There's a decent documentary hidden in ""His Name Was Jason,"" but the editors, writers, producers and directors seem to have the artistic sensibilities of 14-year-old horror hounds, so they're simply unable to draw it out.

That's not to say it isn't a pleasant little watch, because it mostly is. It just could have been so much more. There's very little context or behind-the-scenes background to the way Jason's ""story"" is presented; instead, the filmmakers give us a series of fun but haphazard interviews. Really, it only works as a kind of extended highlight reel of the ""Friday the 13th"" movies with commentary thrown in. I would recommend the doc only with that disclaimer.

For a better example of how a horror retrospective can work as a real documentary, check out ""A Return to the Living Dead.""",1482710400,,1039,5.0
