8556582,5,B00AQQGWTG,The first dvd from Alex Jaeger is very awesome and even helps a novice like me improve my vehicle designs. However this one tackles the rendering process and it is worth every penny! The tank-like vehicle he draws and paints comes out looking like something that would be used in a big budgeted production. Not only that but the techniques he uses to achieve a highly detailed render are phenomenal. It is hard to watch this dvd and not be inspired after to design your own weaponized vehicle! Fully recommend!,1356134400,,510,4.677777777777778
