3153784,5,B001675YOI,"I am planning a trip to Alaska this year. In an attempt to learn as much as I can, I purchased ""Into Alaska with Jeff Corwin"". It is much more than I hoped for. It is very educational in describing different areas of Alaska with beautiful scenery and the history of that area. He makes it fun to view while learning.",1298592000,11,316,4.19672131147541
3153785,5,B001675YOI,"This is a great introduction to Alaska by Jeff Corwin. The photography is spellbinding and the graphics are well done too. The host can sound over enthusiastic at times, but Alaska does that to people. It comprehensively covers all aspects of Alaska, its sights and wildlife (Denali National Park and Preserve, The Kenai Peninsula, Bear Country, Southeast Alaska get separate episodes). The DVD is of very good quality, seen on a good LCD or Plasma, possibly upscaled. A Blu-ray, sadly unavailable, would have been stunning. I lament that subtitles are missing. That would have benefitted the hard of hearing. It ideal for armchair travelers and all those interested in this vast land. Alaska is still pristine and efforts like this are needed to drive home the importance of preserving its unique charms. A great buy.",1250726400,17,818,5.066666666666666

It's an incredible place with endless ways to enjoy nature
Jeff Corwin is a humorous and informative guide to this great state. I definitely recommend this dvd. It's important to preserve nature

3153788,4,B001675YOI,"This is a thorough treatment of the wonders of Alaska.  As a naturalist and outdoorsman Jeff Corwin presents the material with enthusiasm and admiration.  This series covers Alaska through all seasons.  Jeff Corwin continually uses the words ""incredible,"" ""pristine,"" and ""spectacular!""

3153790,4,B001675YOI,"Jeff Corwin is a quirky guy--you either love him or hate him---I gave this to my sister who doesn't like him too much because she says he likes to hear himself talk. If you don't mind Corwin, or could put this past you, my sister said it was a very interesting dvd with lots of useful information for her upcoming trip to Alaska. Great footage too. P.S. I think Corwin is cute, so I don't mind listening to his lengthy speeches. He's easy on the eyes. (ha, ha)",1391385600,,460,4.238636363636363

3153795,5,B001675YOI,"I went to Alaska 2 years ago and loved it.  Several of the locations I remembered being there.  The other locations make me want to go back again.  I was a little afraid that some of the wild animal scenes might get violent, but they didn't.  I didn't want to see little bear cubs killed.

8261481,2,B001675YOI,"The host appears to have an ego sized to match Alaska - in other words, enormous!  Way WAY too much of his breathless narration, and entirely too many shots of the host.  I have lived here in Alaska for almost 50 years, and yes, the state is nice, and I like to be able to show potential visitors a good preview of what they might expect when they come to visit.  Unfortunately, this is not it.  Too much of the video consists of close-up shots of the host.  Enough already.  There are other videos that are much better.  ""The Great Alaska Train Adventure"" is but one example.  There are others. Decent photography, good color quality, best viewed with sound turned off.",1422489600,2,670,4.479338842975206

8261483,5,B001675YOI,I love Jeff Corwin. I think out of all the animal show hosts he was my absolute favorite. I was very sad when he no longer made animal shows. My kids have absolutely fallen in love with watching this DVD among his other ones I have because he makes learning about the animals so much fun.,1404518400,,288,4.160714285714286
