7008473,5,B00TGGMK98,"101 Dalmatians 2 was amazing. I watched parts of it during childhood but I never got to see it until now. I bought my copy at Target before customers get to buy it on the website. It caught my eye once I was at checkout. I had to laugh when the puppies were barking at the tune of the old Disney logo. So hard that tears run down my face. I thought about getting this in French & Italian but I now don't have the money. And just like Peter Pan, the animated classic doesn't have the movie in Quebec (not till Oliver & Company) and then I get the sequel and I pay to have a separate French track because on English dvd's, they're mostly Quebec. It was the best screen cap where the puppies blended in with portraits. It also made me think of Bolt because Thunderbolt and Bolt act and behave like they are on TV and yet later in the movie, they realize that they're actors and never behaved like a real dog till towards the end. At the beginning, I thought so much about how I admired Jodi Benson and the fact I never saw her as anything but as Ariel. Then I said when I look and listen to her, I picture Ariel inside my head always. I knew that Lil Lightning was a bad character before I looked him up on Disney Wiki.",1426982400,2,1216,4.070833333333334

7008486,1,B00TGGMK98,"This movie is garbage. Its an insult to the first. I hated that stupid corgi villain,thunderbolt sucked. Everything about this movie sucked. It should not exist and the fact it does makes me angry. I watched about half and promptly turned it off. If you want to show your kid a 101 dalmatian show them the first movie or even the live action one (though that is not good either).",1476316800,,379,4.428571428571429

7008502,4,B00TGGMK98,"4 1/2 STARS  --- PATCH THE PUPPY LONGS TO BE A 1 IN A MILLION, RATHER THAN JUST 1 OF 101 DALMATIONS

A HIGHER STANDARD FOR DIRECT TO VIDEO

Even after more than a decade this direct to video feature stands well against the passage of animation techniques and a smaller budget.  The story is outstanding and has a terrific message as you would expect.  I hesitate to give it five stars because that's rating it the same as the original classic and many other great, high budget Disney productions with pretty developed stories.  However, this one is terrific.  The story development, the music included, and the animation are still better than normal for direct to video even if they are not quite mega budget Disney level.  That is not a criticism, just an observation that it excels on the level for which it was intended and funded.  Patch the main character is adorable and many familiar formulas are maintained to keep you in your comfort level.

THE STORY (no spoilers):  Patch is the awkward puppy in the very large group of 101 Dalmatians.  This follows the same family of dogs and their ""pet human"" not long after the original events.  Patch and his siblings love to watch a show on TV called Thunderbolt Adventure Hour featuring a western style heroic dog who is always saving the day.  Patch in particular is enthralled by the show as it inspires him to be more than just a number in a large group of puppies.  He longs to be a hero himself.  A one in a million.  One day he learns there is an opportunity to appear on the show with Thunderbolt and his sidekick Little Lightning.  He feels this might be his chance.  However, his family is moving to a quieter place in the country the call Dalmatian Plantation.  Unfortunately Patch is accidentally left behind, but he realizes this is his opportunity to go audition for Thunderbolt's show.  Meanwhile, we also learn that Cruella de Vil has been released and is on probation and restraining order from the puppies.  She takes solace in an undiscovered artist that paints animal spot patterns on canvas.  As spot meets his hero, he learns the hard lessons that TV is not reality and Heroes are less than perfect.  He becomes unwittingly drawn in to a plan by Thunderbolt to keep his TV show (because of his expertise on rescues learned by memorizing every single episode of the program).  This is all just setup for the turns of events and hijinks that will ensue.  It is always obvious that Patch will have to distinguish himself in extraordinary events.

OTHER THOUGHTS:  The story and main characters are well fleshed out if not quite big feature level quality.  They are not that far off.  Young kids are going to love this story.  Older youth and adults may want to rent it first before deciding to buy it outright.",1434153600,2,2779,4.610204081632653
