7814334,5,6301740084,Wonderful!!! Just what I have been looking for -- my Father died last year and my Mother cannot watch any of the movies they used to watch together. Roy Rogers brings back happy memories of her childhood - it is just terrific to have this on VHS tape for her as she never mastered the DVD transition.,1269475200,,300,4.280701754385965
7814335,5,6301740084,"I gave this as a gift to my parents and they loved it. No complaints. They enjoy reminiscing and really loved Roy Rogers and Dale Evans so they get a real kick out of getting to see these shows again in their entirety, just the way they were back so many years ago. There are several shows included so they don't have to watch it all at once but can watch several espisodes, or just one. It made a great gift for them.",1241740800,,418,4.048192771084337
