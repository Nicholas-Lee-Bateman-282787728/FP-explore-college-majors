8052870,1,B0007WHD56,"I had high expectations for this series.  They are truly horrible.  The production value is amature at best.  It looks like it was shot with an old vhs camcorder.  The direction/editing looks like it was done on a PC by a teenager.  Now for the content - I bought these so that I could help my 7 and 10 year olds with the basic techniques of the strokes and speak the language of swimming that they are learning on their team.  I envisioned that this would help improve technique as the title is ""Becoming a faster swimmer...""  This wouldn't even do for beginning swimmers of any age.  The examples are bad, the kids in the video are not even performing the exercises properly as shown by the ""Olympian.""  I showed these DVDS to some swimmers that have been  swimming for over 10 years and they actually laughed.  They then pointed out several areas where they pointers/techniques are either wrong or outdated for today's teaching standards.  Save your money.",1185667200,10,959,4.642857142857143
