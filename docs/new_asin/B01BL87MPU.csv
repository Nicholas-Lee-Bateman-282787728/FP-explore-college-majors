8750477,3,B01BL87MPU,"Bargain pricing, prompt delivery, and reasonable quality; cringe worthy movies. Bought this on a whim, based on a review I read in Netflix for the Night We Never Met, and a vague memory of steamy scenes in Walk on the Moon. ""Night"" and She's So Lovely had the look and feel of run of the mill 90s TV sitcoms, and Walk on the Moon did not hold up well either. So, 5 stars for service; 1 star for movie reviews = 3 stars.",1510012800,,419,4.0602409638554215
