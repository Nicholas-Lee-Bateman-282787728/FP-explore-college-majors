7822526,4,6302240999,"We tend to think first of President Reagan when we're reminded of March 30, 1981, but Jim Brady was hurt badly as well and this is about how his life and his wife's changed dramatically from that day forward.  It's a compelling and disturbing account of the shooting that also hurt a DC policeman and a Secret Service agent, but it's balanced by the absolutely amazing work the doctors and hospital staff did to save them all.

I went on to read Molly Dickinson's book (Thumbs Up: The Jim Brady Story, 1987) to learn more about what happened and what the film didn't include, and she did a tremendous job detailing what happened before, during and after that fateful day, that includes Jim's wife Sarah, about whom another movie and book could be done.  She is a tower of strength and courage in her own right.

I understand Beau Bridges won an Emmy award, and well deserved.  This is a challenging story to tell and I'd love to hear an interview with him about the making of this film.  The saving grace in this story is everyone lived, the astounding part is how they did it.",1386288000,,1077,4.469387755102041

7822528,5,6302240999,"This is a true story. James Brady, former press secretary for Ronald Reagan, was shot in an attempted assassination. Before being hit in the crossfire, Brady was very much pro-gun. His experience changed both him, and his wife. Brady is played by Beau Bridges, with his wife played by Joan Allen. Both are astoundingly good. It's a frank, personal, nonblinking account of Brady and his wife, and the whole of their ordeal. It can be funny, illuminating, and very moving at the same time. Bridges' and Allen's performances are excellent, as is the script and direction, and Bridges won an Emmy award for his performance. Do yourself a favor and watch this film.",1354060800,3,660,4.849557522123894
7822529,5,6302240999,"Beau Bridges won a well deserved Emmy for his portrayal of James Brady, the US presidential Press Secretary who was critically wounded and left  disabled for life in the 1981 Ronald Reagan assassination attempt, an  attempt in which Reagan himself was also wounded.  The film's real success  lies with the dramatic and compelling depiction of how Brady and his life  attempted to rebuild their lives under the international spotlight, and it  highlighted the fact that the National Rifle Association, one of the most  powerful pro-gun lobby groups in the world, would rather have us forget -  that not everyone deseves to have the privilege of gun ownership.",967248000,8,658,5.08411214953271
