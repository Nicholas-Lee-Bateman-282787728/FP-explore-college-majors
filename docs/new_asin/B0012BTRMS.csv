8244990,4,B0012BTRMS,"I think the one drawback is that it is a VHS format. That said, I think Martha does a nice job of showing how to paint a simple picture to be used on a card or a framed piece.

My take-away was how she used the paint to get depth, shadow and light.",1373932800,,424,3.8850574712643677
