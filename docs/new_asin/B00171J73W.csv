I've seen better DVDs that dealt with back health care for elders. Im selling my copy because its not even worth pressing play for me. They should have included an advanced or intermediate level. One of my favorite dvds so far is Peggy Cappy, Back care basics.",1228521600,7,424,4.379746835443038
3167034,3,B00171J73W,"I am no yogini but I have done a little yoga before.  When you see ""Beginner"" in the title of a yoga dvd, you never really know just how basic or beginner it is.  This dvd was so well reviewed I decided to try it.  I found it to be very basic and rather slow.  It's a decent workout, but I was hoping for more.  In particular, it would have been nice to have added an intermediate and/or advanced workout option, along with some more ab work.  I found it to be a little overrated.",1221868800,5,480,4.0
3167035,5,B00171J73W,"I recently purchased the Men's Back Health through Yoga, and I must say I am thrilled.  I have had chronic back pain for about six years, and it had gotten to the point that I was having trouble going up stairs, sleeping for more than an hour at a time, and even getting out of bed in the morning.  I have seen countless doctors who could find nothng wrong with my spine.  Visiting a chiropractor has helped some, but I have been completely miserable for over a year.

I began using the program last week, and already I am able to climb stairs and get out of bed like a normal human being.  I still hurt, but the severity is greatly decreased.  I cannot do the poses as well as the people in the video, but I can feel progress already.  In fact, I have trouble even finishing the video, but I manage.  When I do finish, I feel like a new man.  It's simply unbelievable.",1216684800,9,869,4.186746987951807
3167036,5,B00171J73W,This video and her class have greatly increased my flexibility.  I am an avid tennis player and runner but the years were causing me to have severe back and hip pain.  I had never participated in Yoga until I discovered this program.  Now after a semester of classes and watching this video my back and core muscles have more mobility and improvement in muscle strength,1214265600,2,369,4.6461538461538465

3167038,5,B00171J73W,"As an older man, I have had back problems due to many years of playing a variety of sports and running. I was skeptical at first but now that I have been using these non-impact stretching excercises, my back and core muscles are much improved.  It takes a little time to become comfortable, but this is well worthwhile for those, like me, are just starting out in Yoga. It allows you to go at your own pace.

3167039,5,B00171J73W,I worked out with the video and it was great! After completing the workout my back and whole body felt much better. The reward from working out to this video is worth the efforts.,1212105600,,179,4.294117647058823
3167040,5,B00171J73W,"Great introductory DVD into yoga, particularly for us men. I had a nagging back injury that would never quite heal. I would constantly worry about my back and about hurting it again. I was never interested in trying yoga until now. I have used this DVD and it is a great way to ease into yoga and to work on helping your back. Based on my five month experience with this DVD plus a class so far, I believe that you don't need to do a lot of complicated, exotic poses to see benefits. Rather, consistently doing a set of well thought out poses geared towards certain body areas and having a positive attitude can work wonders if you're patient. It has taken time, but to my relief, my back has improved tremendously so I couldn't be happier! Excellent for keeping a healthy back injury-free, too!",1211932800,3,795,4.4520547945205475
3167041,5,B00171J73W,"All I know is that my back feels better. After years of working behind a desk my lower back and hips have tightened up so much that it hurts when I'm sitting and when I'm standing.  I can't do either for too long. It's been about a month since I have been following along and what I enjoy most is the fact that I can get in a good stretch and workout before work. It's not too long like my other yoga DVD that has ended up just sitting in its DVD case. Not to mention that I can't keep up when they jump from pose to pose.

Life is busy and who has time to work out for an hour or more. It's great to have the 60 min work out tucked away for those days that you have a little more time. But if I have a 60 min workout ahead of me then I know I will just end up putting it off.

I find this yoga DVD a great way to jump start my day.

I also find the pose review really helpful.",1209081600,,877,3.6737967914438503
3167042,5,B00171J73W,"This DVD is great!  I am new to yoga, but have done martial arts, running and backpacking in the past.  I guess those activities took their toll on my back.  I had almost given up on sports until I found this video.  I now do the gentle but effective workout each morning and I am amazed at the difference.  My flexibility is increased, my strength is increased, and I feel like I am able to return to my former activities.  What a Gift!",1207785600,,437,4.204819277108434

8264669,2,B00171J73W,"I am a bit surprised to see the reviews saying this is for beginners only. In fact the opening credits of the DVD say the men featured in the DVD are only beginners and also says it is for men who are out of shape. Then......the first movement focuses the lead female instructor and the ""in shape"" guy on the right grabbing their feet. Come on now, if you bought this video because of being out of shape, having back problems, you are hardly going to be grabbing your feet with the first movement. If you can do that - your back is fine and you need advanced yoga videos. For most of us -it should be like touching just below our knees. Then the next movement is downward dog. Again, no one in the video seems to be having any problems with fully executing this move either.

This video should have a simpler beginner version, or should focus both on men truly in need of back work (i.e. only able to do partial movements).",1322352000,2,923,4.274285714285714

8264671,4,B00171J73W,I have done some other yoga in the past and this one was perfect for what I was looking for. It was not that long and great moves. Something I can do several days a week to improve my back issues!,1287100800,2,196,3.8048780487804876
8264672,5,B00171J73W,"I am a middle aged-man who has suffered through back issues for years. A good friend recommended this Instructional Video to me, because it helped him. I truly feel that this DVD will be beneficial to many, many other men who have neglected their backs over their lifetimes. I currently am in a ""desk"" job, and participate in strenuous activity (sports, yard work, leisure activities) on the weekends, and only occasionally during the week. This DVD has taught me how to develop better posture and how to train my back to work better for me. In the last 3 months I have noticed a huge improvement in my flexibility and a reduction in the number of days that I experience back pain. I have also found that my overall back strength is much better. I believe that the approach to training in this video is very well geared to men, especially to those who are unfamiliar with the benefits of the entire Yoga experience. I found the music to be relaxing and enjoyable. I also believe that a large part of my motivation to continue to pursue this training had to do with the instruction being led by Loredana, who is a very attractive woman, with a soothing voice, reassuring confidence, and a relaxing demeanor....

8264673,2,B00171J73W,"I know nothing of yoga and was given this DVD for Christmas because I would like to improve my posture and alleviate back pain from sitting too much during the day.

This DVD is accessible to even the most novice of yoga practitioners, but it is too accessible.  I ran through it twice and thought, ""This is it?""  Roughly $15 for just 30 minutes of instruction?  It's not worth it.  I found that it was easier just to follow the sheet of poses in the DVD case because I find Loredana's voice to be annoying more than relaxing.  The production value is also low.

I cannot recommend this product.",1230854400,,595,4.4036697247706424
8264674,5,B00171J73W,"Excellent DVD! As a primary care doctor I see many musculo-skeletal maladies. Being in good shape is not just about strength but also about flexibility. This DVD is basic and elementary. It is easy to follow and learn and to fit into a busy schedule. Loredana's instruction helps getting you in touch with your body and will help reduce stress and increase your vitality. Be proactive! If more men did this routine they would have less aches and pains and would not need a doctor. 5 star DVD.
