8541143,5,B002W2B7HE,"Discovered these guys through an 8bitcollective link on Youtube and don't usually write reviews, but they rock (A) and also (B) they don't reply to messages on their website so hopefully they see this and will answer my question about the Casio SK-8A and where in the hell I can find one.

That said, these guys are a lot like the spintronic-Led Zeppelin-esque Christmas-song band prophesized in the bible. So much so they probably are. Using an arsenal of 80's Casiotone (considerately and carefully catalogued on their blog) they put together my new favorite non-Basher Christmas album of all time and that is saying a lot. Waveform nirvana. Pure Vince Clarke disco [...]. Something to wrap my beleaguered brain around while handing out parcels to corporate zombies. Way better than Hootie & The Blowfish.

Check them out, but don't be disappointed if you don't get it at first. Kind of like beer the first taste can be unpleasant and then before you know it you're skipping school to drink it under a bridge. As a wise man once said ""Don't worry about people stealing your ideas. If your ideas are any good, you'll have to ram it down their throats."" Truly, this is a project worth being rammed down people's throats and I hope to see another record by this time next year (GET ON IT DUDES!!)

8541145,5,B002W2B7HE,"This is my new fav 5.1 DVD. I typically hate Xmas music, but since I love 5.1 Audio DVD's I gave this one a shot. First of all, I was shocked at how someone could make Christmas songs actually cool. Then I was surprised the visuals accompaniments were so interesting. Usually there is just random shapes moving around my widescreen, but this was much more like videos catered to every song. I buy quite a bit of 5.1 stuff and this is what I wish they were all like.",1259366400,,465,4.235955056179775
8541146,5,B002W2B7HE,"This Deluxe 2 set edition of Kasio Kristmas is super cool! I was surprised to see that this deluxe version is now available. The 5.1 surround mixes are really unique and sound amazing. In addition, they provided a variety of weird motion visuals that sync to the songs while they're playing. ( any 8 bit, nerdcore, 80's synth geek, child, adult, or alien will find these fun & hypnotic) Anybody with a home theater set up will love this. It will definitely add a weird vibe to my Christmas party this year.

There are also some fun extras as well as the conventional stereo CD version included .",1257984000,,595,4.5092592592592595
