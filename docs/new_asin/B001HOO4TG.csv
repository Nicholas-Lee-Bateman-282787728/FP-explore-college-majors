3642561,5,B001HOO4TG,I have to recommend this to my dad because he would love to know the history behind this. It's a great documentary beautifully filmed and sort of a rare subject to research. I enjoyed it very much. Thanks for the hard work and history lesson. Kuddos!,1467763200,,250,4.456521739130435

3642566,4,B001HOO4TG,"A well crafted documentary about the history and modern challenges facing this famous fishing tackle manufacturer.  Lots of old film footage and anecdotal stories from those who worked at Hardy.  Very British, but touching in it's reflection and sensitivity to the ""old ways"" and the joy of using something made by hand.  Recommended.",1363132800,4,334,5.264150943396227
3642567,5,B001HOO4TG,"I was a little unsure what to expect from 'The Lost World of Mr Hardy'. I'd read some great reviews but did think, ""hey it's just a film about a fishing tackle company"". I needn't have worried, in fact I was blown away. This is one of the best documentary films I have ever seen. Not just because of the subject, that loveable and eccentric old British company called Hardy's, and their rise and fall. More than that, it was a story about a 135 year love affair with angling, and a film about people besotted with what they did; which was to make the best fishing tackle in the world. Wonderful archive clips from the 20s and 30s really capture this incredible world now sadly lost to us. The Hardy's are great inventors and quite the showmen too. Yet all the while the world is changing around them; World Wars are fought and won, the British lose their Empire, but still deep at the heart of it all, is a passion to fish, and the need to be the very best lives on, albeit with unbelievable ups and downs.

The spirit of fishing behind this film is what makes it really stand out, the dedication and workmanship of master craftsman of days gone, as well as those struggling to survive in our modern day. I guess the U.S. and the British are pretty similar in how they'll happily discard things of value in their recent pasts. I think it's 'hats off' to the filmmakers for rescuing so beautiful and fascinating a part of our angling history, one perhaps soon lost forever.

The film-making by the way is excellent. If I saw this on the big screen I'd go away a happy man (you can do that too). The photography is lush, the editing poetic and it knows when to savour the moment. And the music, it strikes this wonderful balance between beauty and melancholy and if I could buy the soundtrack I would.

Apparently in the early days of Rolls Royce, their advertisements would show their cars parked up outside the Hardy's shop in London. Hardy's was the brand they wanted to aspire to and in turn Hardy's became know as the Rolls Royce of fishing tackle. I'd say this film is the Rolls Royce of fishing films. ""Only the best is good enough for fisherman"", claimed J.J. Hardy in the 1890s, well this film exceeds the claim. In my opinion it's an essential hour and a half of armchair angling for anyone who appreciates the best.",1225152000,23,2324,4.425233644859813
3642588,5,B001HOO4TG,"... wow,  what a beautiful film; the landscapes, the sport and the art of the sport, the craftsman of today and yesteryear, the business life story, the dedicated engineering, etc. as well as the narratives within the narratives, and so-on all came together beautifully and moves you in an epic, ethereal way
the filmmakers nailed the form, function, and feeling of the subject and produced a film that is complete in those same terms;  the 3 f's most products and films will nail one of those threerarely all.
  everything was spectacular, as one might expect in an epic film; the screenplay, cinematography, musical score, interviews, segues, continuity, etc., yet, here we have a documentary that is epic as it follows the narrative of a mythical figure, that being Hardy's as well as the sport, and presented in a magically and mythically manner...
...""The Lost World of Mr. Hardy"" is an epic documentary and a masterpiece.
Thank you, that was wonderful.",1475884800,3,958,4.96875
3642589,5,B001HOO4TG,"This will make you lament for the not too distant past, heartbreaking in a way, but ultimately this film shows a love of craftsmanship and dedication to making the very best fly fishing equipment.",1475625600,2,196,4.794117647058823

3642592,5,B001HOO4TG,"As a long time salmon and trout fisherman in England and Scotland, this brought back many pleasing memories of the sport, the equipment and visiting the Hardy shop in Alnwick. Great program which tells the story of the great manufacturer and its demise to cheap foreign copies of vastly inferior quality. What a true gift it would have been to work there or to bring it back to its former glory. If you fish for salmon or trout you need to see this.",1470700800,2,449,4.421686746987952

3642597,5,B001HOO4TG,"I really enjoyed it.  It gave a glimpse into  history of angling 100 years ago.  That being said, I think most people would find it tedious unless they had a real love for the subject.",1468540800,,184,4.2
8309263,5,B001HOO4TG,"It funny like anything mechanical or just craftsmanship.  Texas to a tack shop and have boots made just for you.  Not Nike, but boots that will last your entire life and feel great!  I feel same about vehicles, I personally like Jeep CJ7's not Toyota J40 knock offs (blah).  I think there is a place to make carbureted sports cars, that is the appeal of the Porsche Singers, air cooled, manual, carbureted sports cars, feel and connection with the road, unparalleled.  All the ECM stuff drives me crazy, just too much (except I have to say I do prefer the safety of autonomous vehicles).
Thank you for crafting this documentary.",1525392000,,628,4.672727272727273

8309268,5,B001HOO4TG,"A great documentary regarding business aspects and craftsmen in a changing world. Would have liked to have seen more on rod and reel models and development. Hardy made an everlasting impact on trout and salmon reels and it would have been great to see more. For instance, do they have a museum in their new factory where you can see the different makes and models? If not, then there are probably some collectors in England. Review some collections even if the owners remain anonymous. Would like to see a document of the actual rod & reel models in chronological order in video format.",1484179200,,586,4.699029126213592
