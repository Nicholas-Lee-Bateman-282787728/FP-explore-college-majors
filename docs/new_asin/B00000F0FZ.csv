7906960,3,B00000F0FZ,I purchased this Vhs version thinking it was a Dvd. The cartoons were classic rhymes that brought back fond memories as a child. Although there were parts that had static I found myself trying to fix the tracting on my Gran's Disney Tv but overall she wanted to see it over and over again. It did arrive quickly however but gave it a three star because of the little parts that were jumpy/with static.,1336780800,,401,4.4324324324324325
