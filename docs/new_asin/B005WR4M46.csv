8488064,4,B005WR4M46,"I got this as a gift for a fan of the [rather short!] series, who loves the intensely Japanese puns. Unfortunately, the series is such that it's nigh-impossible to translate, so if you don't understand Japanese, you will be completely lost, especially since--as it's a Japanese BD--there are no subtitles/captions included. Neither of us are fans of the main character Drossel's arbitrary character design changes, but at least it still uses the same voice actors from the first season.",1402876800,,486,5.1645569620253164
