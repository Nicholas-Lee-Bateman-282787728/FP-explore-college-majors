8335175,2,B001Q8NZYS,"This collection of six Gardel films - three per disc - seems ideal on paper. The set is from ""Coleccin Cine Club"". What one discovers after viewing is that there are no subtitles in this set. The quality varies from terrible to mediocre. The films appear to have been taped from early television presentations. There are plenty of vertical lines as well as white specks. The listing of the films on the box as well as the discs is incorrect. Here is a corrected list with
the date of each film:
Disc One: Meloda De Arrabal (1932)
  El Tango En Broadway (1934)
  Tango Bar (1935)
Disc Two: Luces De Buenos Aires (1931)
  Cuesta Abajo (1934)
  El Da Que Me Quieras (1935)
Luces De Buenos Aires is not available on any other  Gardel DVD listing at present to my knowledge. This film not only suffers from terrible visual as well as
audio quality, but has the added indignity of some kind
of identification consisting of two small squares with ""EJD Movies"" inscribed within them - one square at upper right and one at lower left for the duration of the film! Buyer beware. Only for those who must have it all... If one should have Gardel (and why not?) the better, but more expensive, solution is to buy the individual five DVDs from International DVD Group S.A. available through Amazon. I have viewed only Meloda De Arrabal in the latter group. The quality seemed somewhat improved, and subtitles are available. Restoration needed! In the meantime, the tangos are superb, the fedora hats imposing, the Gardel voice glorious.",1270339200,14,1522,4.69172932330827
