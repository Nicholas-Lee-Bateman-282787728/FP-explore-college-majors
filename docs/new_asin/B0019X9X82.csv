8275542,5,B0019X9X82,"Really fine very high bit-rate DVD from Germany.  Who knows why the hour long Hitchcock TV shows are not available here, but this one had top notch treatment with a nice box set style case, book, and some of the very best SD DVD encoding I have seen in years.  Really worth the money I paid, and more!",1438473600,3,301,4.172413793103448
