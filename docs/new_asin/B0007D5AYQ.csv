These videos gave me so much motivation and confidence and were so helpful I enjoyed them all.

I liked the way they were packed, organized, the editing was great, the music, I liked the Tom Deters narrating, and the bodybuilders as well.

This was definatly a unique era of bodybuilding and I miss the early 90's to be honest.

They even go step by step on supplementation, meals, and gym routines.

I wish they would put these out on dvd for better quality. Sadly after 2 decades video tapes so age badly .",1330560000,,588,4.571428571428571
