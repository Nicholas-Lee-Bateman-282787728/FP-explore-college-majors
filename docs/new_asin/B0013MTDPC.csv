8252207,5,B0013MTDPC,"Richard's stuff is credible. A REAL course, not the baloney out there. The only complaint that I have is his cerfiticates that you earn are really, really cheezy looking. Totally inappropriate to hang on the wall with any credibility. Why he couldn't just charge $20 for a nice certificate is beyond me. The certificates he sends out are hoakie considering the course work is rigorous and thorough. I give him an A for the course though!",1353110400,16,437,4.7631578947368425
8252208,5,B0013MTDPC,"Since taking Richard Nongard's course in Clinical Hypnosis I have helped people in my professional counseling practice with issues of weight-loss, fear-of-flying, smoking-cessation, anxiety-reduction, test-taking-anxiety of an advanced medical student, and other goal-accomplishments.  It's been rewarding to have acquired the skills to help my clients more effectively through Richard's certification training in clinical hypnosis. What also stands out in my experience with the ICBCH Hypnosis Certification Training Course was the friendliness and professionalism of the customer service.",1207180800,11,590,6.662337662337662
8252209,5,B0013MTDPC,"My wife and I both took the Certified Clinical Hypnotist course and she took the Certified Advanced Clinical Hypnotherapist course and we loved it. We learned a lot about the techniques and Richard presents the course in an easy-to-follow, entertaining and informative format. We would recommend these courses to anyone who is serious about becoming an expert in hypnosis. We both use the techniques we learned in our private practice.",1206316800,13,435,5.228571428571429
