8375458,5,B002NV7D7W,"This series is a life changer. It's hard to describe how these 6 DVD's can change your life, but they have the potential of opening up your life to ""Real Love"". Most of life settles for imitation love. There's a bumper sticker that says, ""Searching for love, but will settle for s_x"". That's our dilemma where do we or to whom can we turn to find Genuine, Real love? Only you can answer the question about the loneliness you are suffering, and searching but never finding Real Love. Our entire society is all about counterfeit love, so I suggest taking a look at Greg Baer's book and eventually these DVD's.",1429142400,2,607,4.527272727272727
