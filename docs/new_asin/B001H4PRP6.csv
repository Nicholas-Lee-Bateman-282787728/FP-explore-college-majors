The story? was entertaining.. a bit grapic on some subjects.. eeunichs? ok .. but some parts of it were a bit over done in the story line.  overall i enjoyed the story..  when they are based on history then well there is not always room to have them end the way you want.. they kinda end the way that history dictated.  Incidentally YA entertainment products are usually not found cheap.  THey are the best there is out there for english subs and quality of product.  YA i think got out of the business, (one drama 3 parts was close to 1000 dollar total for 54 hours).  so finding these on amazon at dirt cheap price.. i kind of bought first.. and asked questions later.  It seems that this 3 part series sold a lot of part 1's.. and a lot of people must have gotten disallusioned.. and so the part 2 and 3's did not sell as many.. so now they are getting rid of those cheap.. ( part one will cost you waaaaayyy more than what part 2 and 3 are selling for)  So part 2 and 3 might just be the hook too.  These are Korean drama's.. use them with EXTREME caution.. once you watch one.. you may be addicted for life.  they are like 16 20 30 50 60 or even 90+ hour movies!  their quality of production and acting.. as good or often better than anything you can find in hollywood.. a whole new universe of entertainment.. if you can just live with subtitles!",1406764800,,1584,4.292929292929293
8307794,2,B001H4PRP6,"I've watched dozens of Korean TV series dramas. Many were historical dramas. This was perhaps the least inspiring I've seen.

The script was ho-hum. Basically, it centered about a clueless dummy who castrated himself to become a eunuch, so he could be near the woman he loved, while nominally serving the king, who made that woman his queen. He constantly exasperated people in the story, as well as viewers, acting like he knew what was up, but really didn't. Try rooting for him to come through, then time and time again he gives one more reason to assume he is hopelessly stupid.

The scriptwriter was also very wasteful when it came to utilizing his characters. Often, when you expected something really unique to happen, you're disappointed with two-dimensional story developments.

The high point I would say was the proficient acting skills of Jun Kwang Ryul, who played the head eunuch and sage adviser to the kings.

Han Jung Soo provided great supporting acting to augment Jun Kwang Ryul's role. And Jun Hye Bin was fascinating as the always-scheming femme fatale.

Oh Man Suk in the main role was so predictable as to be boring. And Koo Hye Sun, as the love of his life who became a queen, was often irritatingly repetitious. I fault more so the lackluster script they had to follow. But she was much better in ""Mighty Chilwu"" and ""Boys Over Flowers."" Both characters seemed to be retarded, having severe learning problems, time and time again failing to learn anything from their mistakes.

Before buying this Korean TV series, I would strongly suggest buying something else... unless, like me, you've already seen just about every other Korean historical drama, and want to watch it simply because, like the man who told people who asked him why he must climb a mountain, ""Because it's there.""
