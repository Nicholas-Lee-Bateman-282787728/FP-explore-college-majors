8595373,5,B004FFBMIA,"In a word: thrilling. Neither the mono sound (well balanced and detailed as it is) nor the vintage black and white video imagery can detract from the significance of this release. The rare opportunity to experience visually as well as sonically the great Boston Symphony Orchestra under Charles Munch, one of its finest music directors, trumps any shortcomings. The 1958-1961 footage features Ravel's Ma Mere L'Oye Suite as well as Debussy's Iberia and La Mer. Munch's profound empathy for this repertoire is everywhere matched by the superb playing of this great orchestra. Witness the masterful maneuvering of the complex and challenging transition to the last movement of Iberia (Le Matin d'un jour de fete). The subtle dynamic shading and rhythmic plasticity produced by the strings in movement II (Petit Poucet) of Ma Mere L'Oye is extraordinary. The exaltation at the conclusion of La Mer is palpable. The list goes on and on. Refinement and excitement in perfect equilibrium.  68 minutes of pure joy. Annotations are excellent.",1299456000,10,1034,5.228915662650603
