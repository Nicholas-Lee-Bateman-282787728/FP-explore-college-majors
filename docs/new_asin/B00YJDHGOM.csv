7222759,5,B00YJDHGOM,"Ken Burns recalls when his father shook his head in amazement of his son Ken Burns, when Ken told his father that he knew what he was going to do next which was making the Civil War documentary, and his father asked what part, and Ken replied all of it. Civil War is the most defining and the most important event in American history and this documentary certainly brings it all into reality. A must see educational documentary. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1441843200,7,449,4.555555555555555
7222760,4,B00YJDHGOM,"The restoration of Ken Burns epic documentary is a welcome upgrade of the original materials, but anyone expecting a revelatory experience from this new 4K master will realize immediately that the limitations of the original 16mm negatives are glaringly evident in the new product. While the images are brighter and show more subtlety in their colors, most exhibit grain from the inexpensive film that was used for the documentary, and the aspect ratio of the format still leaves bars on the sides of  16X9 screen.

It is probably unreasonable to expect the massive amount of vintage still photography to have been rescanned for this restoration, but anyone who has seen modern high definition scans of vintage photography (including those in Burns' more recent documentaries) can attest to the almost tactile quality of the images. While greatly improved, the iconic ""Ken Burns effect"" panning and zooming of the original photographs are still subject to the original recording media, which falls far short of modern technology.

While it would have been a Herculean effort to refilm the vintage photography and artifacts and reframe the original contemporary interviews and scenic photography for a 16x9 aspect ratio, (and maybe even remaster the audio to 5.1 channels) it's hard to imagine a more worthy subject than The Civil War.",1441584000,33,1334,5.224299065420561
7222761,5,B00YJDHGOM,"I was a junior in high school when the original came out. At the time, I had no interest in history. When my history teacher showed this in class, I was hooked. I learned so much about the civil war, especially growing up in southern middle TN where so many battles happened. I later bought a medal detector and found a few relics in the Pulaski/Shelbyville area. Anyway, if it was not for this series, I would have not cared about our nation's history.

I was delighted when it was rereleased  & recorded it so I could have it but my DVR went out so I lost it.  That's when I decided to buy it so I can watch it & even take notes.  If you haven't seen this, it is truly fantastic.  There's lots of pictures, which are much less grainy in this re-mastered version,  it is narrated by several people  with music of the time  playing in the background,  as well as some sound effects which go along w/ the photos.  It is told in such a way to really bring the people & situation to life & is something that will really stay with you.  It's far from boring dates & dry facts.  I highly recommend it.

7222795,1,B00YJDHGOM,"I watched this documentary when it was originally broadcast, and have loved it ever since.
My wife and I watch it once a year, generally in February, amidst the doldrums of Winter, when a Sunday can be spent cozied up with a good fire and a lonnng documentary.

I purchased the 'remastered' 25th Anniversary set, lured by the promise of an even better viewing experience than that offered by our old 'original' PBS Gold  DVD set, which has been the mainstay for over a decade.

Today, with fire crackling away, we eagerly sat down to watch.....

The first disc of the 25Anniversary set would not even load in our Magnavox DVD player.
Undeterred, I switched to yet another make player ( I have learned over time; it pays to have alternatives)...it loaded.....

BUT... we watched for only for a little while, as the picture was grayed-over and had a fuzzy aspect to it, as if a scummy-film were overlayed on the images. Those were the full-color modern ;mood' images ...  shot at great visual landscapes and battlefield memorials...and now looking so, so BAD..... Worse, we soon found the historical  period Mathew Brady/Alexander Gardner images were over-exposed and too bright, washing the details out...
It was easy for my wife and I to immediately spot the flaws as we have --as stated--seen this documentary many, many times....

We went back to the original PBS Gold release, and are watching that as I type this.

Now...I have noted all the gushing reviews of those who apparently have no issues at all, and are quite satisfied with the 'remastered' 25th Anniversary release...
I had in fact, read all the comments.... Good AND Bad..... BEFORE I purchased the 're-mastered' release...I had paid attention to UPC Codes, Date-of-Manufacture, all that.......
 I had high hopes that we would be among the pleased purchasers...
We are decidedly NOT.

To Those Considering Purchase; Apparently; You MAY Get Lucky...BUT.... Then Again; You May NOT.

As for me, I am not rolling the dice ( and spending the money ) again on yet another 'remastered' set...
The remaster sounds like a great idea.... but what good does it do when you cannot depend upon the quality of the set you pay for ?",1455408000,5,2184,4.825737265415549

7222824,1,B00YJDHGOM,"PROS:
The bonus material is great content-wise.
Everything is much, much sharper and clearer.

CONS:
Much of the new 1080p 'detail' is man-made noise and artifacts, intentionally put into the production.
As others have noted, the brightness on these blu-rays is through the roof.  Anything that should be black is grey.  That includes the bars on the sides that would normally be solid black.  This is a deal breaker.
As a result of the crazy-high brightness, all the colors are washed out and bland.  The scene depicted on the beautifully remastered cover of the case?  Yeah that's not anywhere near what it looks like on disc..  It really contradicts the efforts that went into restoring this masterpiece.

I'm returning this, which is probably the first for me in my decade of shopping on Amazon (other than outright non-working defects).  This is such a big issue that there's no doubt in my mind it will be fixed and re-released.  I've attached an image of one of the discs playing on my computer.

7222833,1,B00YJDHGOM,"I eagerly ordered the bluray restored edition, expecting crisp photos and beautiful graphics.  What I received is a terrible disappointment, ugly and unwatchable.  The images are too bright, the screen is washed out, the image does not fill the screen but has ugly gray sidebars left and right,  the black levels and contrasts and color saturations are amateurish, the videos such as of Shelby Foote are grainy and annoying, and even the soundtrack seems weak and pale compared to the wonderful sound of the DVD set I bought a few years ago--even though it seems to be the same recording.  I assumed that I got a defective set, so I looked here at the Amazon customer reviews and discovered that many other buyers are having the same disappointing experience.  I can see that some of the photos seem to be more detailed, but it does not compensate for the unpleasant appearance of the screen.  Don't buy it.  Find the previous DVD set.

7222834,4,B00YJDHGOM,"In October 2015, PBS marked the 25th Anniversary of  The Civil Wars initial broadcast with an all-new,4K  restoration of  Ken Burns masterpiece on Blu-ray disc (BD). When I first saw this BD set on Amazon.com, I quickly pre-ordered it, eagerly anticipating its arrival. When it was delivered, I immediately began watching it

and was almost instantly underwhelmed by what I saw. Artistically, The Civil War itself was as good as ever, certainly one of the best documentaries ever produced, regardless of subject matter. But technically, this BD set simply did not live up to my high expectations for it.

The quality of the video in this supposedly 4K restoration was a major disappointment. The video throughout all nine episodes was just too bright, suggesting, perhaps, misadjusted black levels. That problem was easy enough for me to fix, however; I simply adjusted the brightness level down a bit on my BD player.

But there was a bigger problem that I couldn't fix: the sometimes overpowering graininess present in many scenes. Now, I learned a long time ago that film grain can potentially be a good thing, especially in high definition presentations. At appropriate levels, grain actually enhances resolution and gives a video presentation a wonderfully realistic, filmic quality. That was true for much of The Civil War. Unfortunately, film grain was so pronounced in many sections of the film   in both monochrome and color scenes  that it became for me a big distraction. And I could find no adjustment that would allow me to compensate for it.

Its too bad this 25th Anniversary edition of  Ken Burns The Civil War is let down by what I consider (at best) disappointing video quality.  If  this version of The Civil War had fully met my expectations, it would easily have garnered a five-star rating from me. Im deducting one star because of the video problems.  I won't lower my rating any more than that because I believe it merits least four stars, based on the overall artistic strength of the film, the first-rate audio quality (5.1 DTS-HD MA); and the many bonus features included in the set.

The Original Oct 2015 release was flawed, the picture is as bright as the Sun, and at least for me and my family almost impossible to watch. I watched on a somewhat ""high end"" Blu-ray transport and the video on the documentary itself is horrible. The DVD's from 2011 and 2005 did not suffer this terrible malady so it's not the source material, it was likely the Blu-ray mastering/authoring that was employed. Has anyone who have given this Oct 2015 release positive reviews actually viewed the video on that Oct 2015 Blu-ray edition?

This Oct 2015 released Blu-ray set is an atrocity and I returned mine post haste. A real travesty considering the documentary represents what may very well be the all-time best use of the TV medium. However, PBS admitted this Oct 2015 Blu-ray set is defective and in Dec 2015 released a corrected version with a new UPC of 841887027380. They are also accepting returns from those who purchased from PBS or Amazon. Not sure about other vendors, but for more info write to (pbscustomerservice@pbs.org)

Dec 11, 2015 EDIT :  I got my hands on a copy of the corrected set [UPC 841887027380].  At the bottom of the set on the shrink wrap is a sticker with the new UPC. If the sticker is removed the old UPC is underneath on the box and there likely will be no way to differentiate between the bad set and the new corrected version. I have selected Disc 4 at random and sampled as well as compared to the older DVD versions. This time the picture was everything that was advertised - finally. Picture is noticeably better than the original DVD and 20 Anniversary [150th] set but then again so too should any property transferred and mastered Blu-ray over it's DVD doppelgangers. Grain structure thankfully was left intact and as a result the detail on many of the photo's and other footage is striking. You can freeze frame and actually read many the presented documents. Please note I've only looked at the fixed Disc 4 thus far.. Kudos to PBS for correcting but sad to think many not in the know will be receiving the bad Oct 2015 version this XMAS and will never realize how great the corrected version actually looks.",1445558400,110,2396,4.886699507389163

7222838,4,B00YJDHGOM,"A little wider but the restored footage is grainy in comparison to the DVD 4:3 or even the series available on Prime. Sound quality is still good and the commentaries by Ken Burns are welcome. I can't recommend this to people who have seen the ""unrestored"" version but it still stands as one of the best documentaries ever done regarding our bloodiest conflict.",1445212800,3,361,4.746031746031746
7222839,2,B00YJDHGOM,"Frustrating Blu-ray quality. The black levels on the episodes are gray and washes out the picture. On the extras, you can see how it is suppose to look with the correct black levels. However, on the episodes themselves, it is gray in color, and it makes the picture whiter than it is suppose to be, affecting the video.

I have compared to my DVD set from years ago and this Blu-ray is better. The sound is good, the picture has more information, and is a more clear picture. When I compare the snippets of the show in the extras, to what the episodes look like, you can clearly see something bad happened in the episodes with the black levels.

Two stars because of this glaring mistake, NOT the show itself. Why couldn't they get the black levels right, like they did on the extras and the short commercials.",1445212800,11,810,4.466216216216216
7222840,1,B00YJDHGOM,"Eric Schindler is absolutely correct. This is a major disgrace. PBS and Burns should be alerted to this disaster. I couldn't sit through more than 10 minutes and had to give up. I checked the 2nd disc and found the same problem.

I have the previous DVD release and can easily see the black levels are fine here.

Are there proper sets out there or are they all like this?",1445212800,43,411,4.453333333333333
7222841,1,B00YJDHGOM,"I just finished watching the first two discs of The Civil War and I feel compelled to pen my amateur opinion. While I do not have the best hardware, nor any longer the sharpest eye, and my technical expertise is more a personal fantasy than an established fact, I have to say that I am sorely disappointed with what I saw.

Watching these first two discs was as if someone had turned the brightness on my television to its maximum. There were no blacks to be seen, not even in the vertical bars aside the viewing area. When the credits were rolling, it was hard to see where the image ended and the black bars began. Dark greys were the closest thing to black to be found.

The whites were so bright as to obscure fine detail. It made me want to squint my eyes.

The colors seemed bleached like laundry left to dry several times too often under a desert sun. I thought I was looking at a faded Polaroid print. It is an overexposed slide show that made me wish I could apply Adobe photoshop to it. At times the grain is so thick during the color scenery segments that you would think it was filmed in the middle of a swarm of gnats.

These discs should be recalled, incinerated, and replaced. I would really rather watch my dvd edition than this unnatural abomination. I have no idea how the blu-ray.com reviewer gave the video a 4 out of 5. I do not know what Ken Burns saw, if or when he approved of this travesty, but it could not have been what I just sat through.

I also found that the constant reminder of Bank Of America's sponsorship grew tiresome fast. These mini commercials precede and follow every single episode.",1445126400,47,1625,4.34983498349835

7222846,1,B00YJDHGOM,"The issue is NOT the documentary.  The problem is with the quality of the DVD.  The quality of the DVD is pathetic.  There are numerous skips in the narration.  I would estimate that a word is either skipped or can not be heard approximately every 25 to 30 words.
I thought the problem might be with my DVD player, which I haven't used is a couple of weeks.  I tried a couple of other DVDs that were 5 to 6 years old and did not have this problem.
The problem exists on all the discs in the set so I believe it is an production issue.

7222850,5,B00YJDHGOM,"Do not be put off by the word 'documentary,' although this is an utterly brilliant and spellbinding documentary series. Ken Burns' ""Civil War"" is as compelling and absorbing as any fictional story, and the characters portrayed become as alive as those in any movie. Burns accomplishes this movie-effect by the clever and artful panning of a still photo while an actor (you'll recognize many wonderful voices) reads the actual words of the person being shown or describing a scene from that person's perspective. With music of the period and realistic sound effects added, you really forget these images are still photographs and not motion pictures.

Being a Northerner myself, I'm not sure if I'm accurate in saying Ken Burns' ""Civil War"" series is unbiased, but I did not detect a slant to his history telling. Personally, I became quite fond of people on both sides. There was one soldier who was frequently 'quoted' for whom I developed such an affection that I began worrying if he'd make through the entire war alive and in one piece.

I think this first-person perspective of selected readings from real diaries and letters of the period gives the series such an emotional appeal. It feels very Present Tense, and you feel very much a part of it all.

Interviews with various historians are interspersed throughout the series, my favorite being those with author and historian Shelby Foote. I could watch a full hour of Shelby Foote and never be bored. His voice, his perspective, his delightful phrasing...first rate! Historian Barbara Fields provides the African-American perspective, as do the quotes from freed slaves and the wonderfully articulate Frederick Douglass.

This is our history, and Ken Burns makes it come alive for us in the safety and comfort of our homes. But don't be misled; this is a series about a gruesome war, and there are many disturbing words and images. While one can rejoice in the achievement of emancipation, there is nothing to celebrate in the horrendous loss of lives, concluding with the assassination of President Lincoln. But don't let the sobering aspect of the subject matter keep you from watching this truly brilliant series. Not only will you have a far greater grasp of our past, you'll have an understanding of the issues with which we continue to grapple as a nation and a society.

Ken Burns' ""Civil War"" series is absolutely a ""must-see.""",1442707200,12,2394,4.975
