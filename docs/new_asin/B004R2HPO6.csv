8438645,3,B004R2HPO6,"Sunny Deol in another of his formula action flicks. Salaakhen was just mind-blowing and kind of crazy. Sunny plays this simple guy, who is forced to take the law (as usual) in his own hands and goes beyond the limits to get justice after his father (Anupam Kher) is humiliated by a false conspiracy, which leads to suicide in court. From the point where Sunny is jailed and the rest of the film to the end (to the end) reminds you of Ghayal, especially because he is outraged by so much corruption in the law. The action occurred in the last 30 minutes of the movie (more would have helped). Amrish Puri is the greatest villain out there, but there is another 'baddy' responsible for the trouble (watch to find out who). This climax is long with a car chase and a short bus stunt. Overall, this movie may not be as great as Ziddi, but it is alright. Watch it for Sunny Deol!",1304380800,,874,4.335365853658536
