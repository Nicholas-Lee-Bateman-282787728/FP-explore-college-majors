5564830,2,B00BACT1I4,"Marvel animation is just simply not up to par with DC animation yet, and that's really too bad, especially since Marvel puts out much better live action films. Sadly, this trend continues w/ Marvel's latest offerings. I had higher hopes because I really enjoyed Tales of Asgard and Planet Hulk. I thought they were large steps in the right direction. Instead we get two steps backward. Let me give you specific reasons of what went wrong here:

1. Dialog - Bad, bad, bad. Especially the scenes between Pepper Potts and Tony. They are cliche-filled, they are cheesy, they are terrible. There are times even when Pepper's lines were three bad lines right in a row, that all said the same thing in a different way. Nick Fury was reduced to a caricature. Only the Punisher has some good lines, but his presence in the film is much more minor than the cover suggests. The opening flight scene between War Machine and Iron Man sets the bar very low as Tony taunts Rhodey over and over again using the same lines, and the movie never clears that bar.

2. Plot - VERY MINOR SPOILERS. The plot hinges around an attack on a space tower at the beginning of the film by this ""Technovore."" Because Tony was there, SHIELD wants to bring him in for questioning. How do they try to bring him in? By trying to kill him. Yes, because Tony won't come in for questioning, Fury authorizes Mandroids, Black Widow, and Hawkeye to kill him. Why the escalation in violence? Who knows? The movie never tells us. In that scene where Technovore destroys the space tower, he also kills everyone inside it. Everyone except Iron Man, of course. Why does he spare Tony when he can easily kill him? Who knows? The movie never tells us. Where does Technovore get his powers from? Who knows? The plot and silliness continue through the entire film, but providing more examples would spoil it for you. Even the climax is a contrived mess that makes no sense.

What went right? The animation is pretty darn good. All of the characters are drawn a little but anime style, but that shouldn't bother anyone. Pepper Potts is strangely unattractive, and Black Widow's breasts are threatening to pop out the entire film. Like I said, it's anime style. The only reason I give this film two stars instead of one is because the animation is decent and they worked the Punisher into a small, but amusing role. I'd still recommend skipping the film.",1365552000,53,2401,4.618266978922716
5564831,5,B00BACT1I4,"Excellent anime! Saw an early screener.  Incredible action, and an interesting storyline that actually gets philosophical for a super hero movie!  If you love Iron Man and the Avengers and the Punisher, I would check this out.  Some parts are a little slow, but I think that's fine, it's geared for an older, THINKING audience.  A bit weird and gory at times, so not for everyone, and probably not for the younger kids under 12... but all in all, really enjoyed it!",1365292800,8,465,4.634146341463414

The voice stars listed where for the english dubbed version. Usually I prefer the original language with english subtitles for movies in other languages as I hate the speech and lip movement not matching. In animation that doesn't really apply as the lip movement and speech don't sync anyways. What really bothers me in a movie like this and having to read the subtitles is that it distracts you from the wonderful anime that the artists worked so hard on. You can't enjoy visuals for having to look down and read the subtitles.",1454198400,2,700,4.745901639344262

Norman Reedus was an dd choice for Punisher but i wouldn't say he was a wrong one just weird to see a different face with the voice.

5564856,3,B00BACT1I4,"For some reason, Marvel Animation has outsourced a number of projects to anime studios, including four different TV series and a series of movies.

One of those movies would be ""Iron Man: Rise of Technovore,"" which is approximately 65% Marvel action and mayhem, and 35% contemplative Nietzsche-quote-dropping anime. Gorgeous animation and some fun supporting by much-loved Marvel characters (Punisher, War Machine, Black Widow and Hawkeye), but it does have a slight problem with the whole Tony Stark Vs. SHIELD subplot that could have been avoided with just a few minutes of discussion.

Tony Stark is preparing to launch a satellite that will allow global surveillance to stop crimes and attacks before they happen... which sounds an awful lot like the villains' plan from ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier."" But before the satellite launch, a mysterious young boy in bio-tech armor (referred to as Technovore) attacks the facility, and both Tony and Rhodey are attacked by men in flying suits of mech-armor.

But when Rhodey is seemingly killed in the battle, Tony goes on a rampage. Nick Fury tries to contact him, but when Tony ignores this attempt, an all-out assault is launched to stop Tony -- including sending Black Widow and Hawkeye to intercept him. So the eccentric billionaire joins forces with the Punisher to smoke out the mysterious attacker, and figure out what kind of technology he's using. If they fail, SHIELD itself will be the next target.

""Iron Man: Rise of Technovore"" is an odd hybrid beast -- some parts of it could have been transplanted directly from a Marvel live-action movie, like the opening scene of Tony and Rhodey zooming over a version of Utah that could only have been dreamed up by someone who has never been there. There's plenty of smashing cars, Mandroids blowing up, people aiming guns and arrows at each other, and occasionally the Helicarrier getting tangled up in long streamers of white biotech goo.

In between those action scenes, it's very clearly a product of Japan. There are long contemplative scenes at times, such as when we see the mysterious Technovore sitting in a glowing white room with a mysterious woman, quoting Nietzsche and conjuring blue butterflies from the air. In fact, the design of Technovore is very clearly anime-styled, more so than anything else in the story -- a long, slender, almost insectile design, with an eyeless mask that evaporates and balls of corrupting white... STUFF that just dart away into nanobots.

The story's biggest problem is that one of the main conflicts -- SHIELD trying to hunt Tony -- comes across as completely over-the-top and avoidable. Yes, Tony is grief-stricken, but literally two minutes of dialogue would have avoided a lot of the story's destruction, and the whole contrived ""SHIELD hunting Iron Man"" story would have been flushed away. It feels like a distraction from the rather slow-moving central plot, which is too simple and straightforward to stand on its own.

The voice acting is overall quite good -- Matthew Mercer, John Eric Bentley, James C. Mathis III, Kate Higgins, Troy Baker and Clare Grant all give solid performances, mimicking the movie characters pretty nicely. The characters are also rather similar -- while the Tony of this anime doesn't have the charmingly arrogant snark of Robert Downey Jr, he is well-developed as a mischief-maker and grief-wracked friend.

Norman Reedus' Punisher is perhaps the odd duck out. He's not badly-dubbed or out of place, but he feels oddly extraneous to the main story. Eric Bauza's Technovore/Ezekial is probably the weirdest performance -- he's got a distant, gauzy, childish personality that seems less developed than the other characters, and his motives seem kind of disjointed.

""Iron Man: Rise of Technovore"" is a fairly entertaining little Marvel story, but it does suffer from slow spots and a rather contrived subplot about SHIELD attacking Iron Man. Worth a watch and beautifully animated, but the script could have used a few more rewrites.",1422057600,,4024,5.103343465045593

Nice fast paced action, but the story and villains are overdone but the Marvel heroes such as Iron Man and company are excellent. Love the quirky Tony Stark remarks and detailed technology in his suit of armor is done outstanding!
The Cons now: First there is too much dialog. Its long and drawn out to really get going and too much talking between the hero and villain before they can actually fight each other.  My pet peeve on the Marvel Avengers: Black Widow & Punisher as well. Next we see that the villain always has to turn into a giant massive gross looking monster before its actually killed. Seems all the Anime movies I have seen, seem to end this way too. I guess for these style animators its just too damn easy to kill the villain normally and has to become more powerful than it was, then finally die in a massive and gross way. Overkill is an Anime requirement!",1403136000,,971,4.517045454545454

5564871,3,B00BACT1I4,"I've watched the movie about 3-4 times and it really isn't as bad as it is. In fact, when I first saw it, I didn't really like it. I decided to sit with it and try again. Not only that, but I had to do a bit of research to understand things better.

I think one of the things that really threw people off was when the main villain, Stane's son starts going berserk. They don't really explain the the technovore cells in the suit start going unstable within his body. He just kind of says, ""Why do you reject me?"" (or something to that effect). He then mutates into some crazed monster on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, stops suddenly- and sprouts out as a giant cloud of technovores that connect to the HOWARD satellite. This was the scene in the movie where everyone I watched the movie with was like... ""WTF am I watching..."" Also, Rhodey waking up and jumping back in the War Machine suit like nothing happened... really?

Another thing they didn't explain in the movie was who ""Sasha"" is. Sasha is the creepy lady who has a couple of dialogue scenes with Ezekiel. Sasha Hammer is a big part of Advanced Idea Mechanics (A.I.M.) daughter of the Mandarin, an old nemesis of Tony Stark. Sasha and A.I.M. are the ones who helped provide Ezekiel Stane with his armor. People who don't follow Iron Man are just very confused as to who this lady is since they don't really explain anything about her.

Another complaint that I heard people talk about was why S.H.I.E.L.D. chasing after Tony instead of Ezekiel. The way I understood it was S.H.I.E.L.D. was after Tony because they had no idea where Ezekiel was or how to track him. They didn't know what he looked like or who he was and they needed the only living witness in custody to explain what really happened. A bunch of people died, and the government wanted answers via interrogations with Tony- but Iron Man of course, didn't want to sit around for all that stuff and decided to go after Stane himself.

Now, with all that stuff out of the way, I liked the other scenes in the movie. The parts involving The Punisher, Black Widow, and Hawkeye. The fight scenes were pretty cool, I enjoyed them. That being said, I really enjoyed the first half of the movie.

The second half of the movie kind of disappointed me. Ezekiel Stane's character annoyed me and the end with the Technovores was just kinda like ""WUT?""

Regardless, I did enjoy a good majority of the movie, so I feel that 3 out of 5 stars is accurate. It's okay.

5564873,1,B00BACT1I4,"I literally just watched this flaming turd and writing about it is only making me more angry.  My head hurts from trying to figure out if the plot and logic were going over my head or it was just absent.  I previously read the bad reviews and always knew It wasn't going to be a great movie but hey, I'm going to need it for my collection and it comes with a ticket to see Amazing Spider-Man 2 which I'm going to see anyway.  The reviews don't do this garbage justice because there is no amount of words that can express how really bad this movie is.  I thought people were exaggerating, since that's what a lot of people said about Iron Man 2.  I own every direct to video movie Marvel has put out until now and even the worst one is pretty good.

There's plenty of people saying how bad this is.  Let me illustrate (I'll try not to use too many ""spoilers"") First off, this movie has no logic whatsoever.

A dude in a white suit kills a bunch of people and attempted to destroy one of his satellites and all Iron Man does is lecture to him about killing being bad (until he gets away).  This guy immobilizes Iron Man and blows up the building as War Machine comes in. (Keep that in your mind)

Nick Fury has SHIELD detain Iron Man because 1. He is the sole survivor and wants to debrief him so Nick Fury doesn't get chewed out by politicians 2. So Iron Man will not get killed by the guy in the white suit.  To stop him from going after the guy in the white suit Nick Fury sends all of shield to try to get Iron Man back even if they have to kill him.  That's right SHIELD is trying to kill Iron Man so he will not get killed by the guy in the white suit.

After a long time avoiding SHIELD, Iron Man runs into the Punisher for no damn reason except that they were after the same guy (in the middle east), and Frank Castle looked up a name on the internet for him from his hideout.  The name of the son of the guy who took his company and tried to kill him mind you ""Stane, sounds familiar"" (Cuts to scene of Stane/Iron Monger being killed with the arc reactor from Iron Man). Iron Man finds the guy who killed his best friend and gives him a monotone lecture.  AFTER THE LECTURE the Iron Man suit is disabled by Nanites .

The ""philosophy"" of the villain is so stupid, I was getting headaches trying to makes sense of it.  Stane Jr. made himself into a biomechanical organism.  He is no longer human so he wants to kill all humans through technology because of human reliance on technology because he is the next evolution of humanity.  (I understand this doesn't make sense, that's my point)  I could go on but I think I've illustrated my first point enough.

The other thing that makes this story so bad is the voice acting.  Every character is monotone.  It's not even that it's monotone, (because monotone can be cool like Fox Mulder) they all sound like they are reading to have their voices digitized for a phone tree.

Then there's the other things like bad dialogue, stories that are built up and go nowhere, etc. that almost everyone is talking about.  I figure you've read those parts in other reviews and don't need me to repeat it.  Only anime and Marvel fans should bother with this and that is only to see how truly bad it is or to fill that gap in your collection.  Everyone else, stay away!!!!",1399075200,2,3311,4.230891719745223

5564875,1,B00BACT1I4,"If you are looking at all these terrible review but are like ""But it's Ironman! I love that guy!"" let this one be the final one you read.

I know it has Ironman (Tony Stark, the king of kool, the man with the plan, Captain Kickass, a real hero who doesn't use magic handtools or jump around in the shadows wearing pajamas)

I know it this whole Mavel and the Avengers thing is pretty big right now.

I know the animation looks slick, and it is, but....

Youtube the two cool fight scenes. If you must see it all watch it with the sound off or else you will hear your childhood getting beaten with cheesy anime cliches, dialogue that ranges from getting kicked in the one testicle cringe-worthy to ""wat?"". It's like the writers just copy pasted jokes from '90s b-movies. The story is something roughly like if M. Night. Shamallama was perpetually 12 and maybe a little mentally handicap.

It's a shame for sure. It is loaded with potential. The animation is clean and fast, the characters are all well established (I mean in general, you will have no idea who the hell anyone is if you just watch this steaming pile of broken dreams). It even has bloody TONY STARK, just starkin' it up. *Sigh* To bad it just sucks.

First of all, what is wrong with all the character's eyes?  They just look creepy like the animator was just trying too hard to make them anatomically correct but also make them look like an anime character's.  Other than that the animation was pretty good.

Plus I could really care less that Obediah had a son he didn't really care about which drove him to become crazy and inject himself with nanobots or whatever those things were.

The best parts of this was the parts with the Punisher in them, because let's face it, anything with Norman Reedus in it is just plain awesome!  It was also refreshing to see that Tony made references to other parts of the Marvel universe such as the Savage Land, Asgard, and Captain America.  Other than those scenes I could really care less about the rest of this movie.

Unless you're a HUGE Iron Man or Marvel fan, you can skip over this one.  It doesn't really add anything to the overall saga of the Marvel universe.",1378771200,,1153,4.781725888324873
5564884,2,B00BACT1I4,"As with the Marvel Anime Iron Man series, all of the animations of the armors look great.  However other than the armors, the animation seems quite flat and lifeless.  While there is a lot of action in this movie, it seems few and far between.  The story was what you would expect if Iron Man guest starred in Neon Genesis Evangelion.  It features a lot of very existential talk, but it does little for the story.  Most of the time it seems to be trying to hard to be smarter than it actually is.  I liked some of the other Marvel Animes and wouldn't mind seeing more, but they need to be a lot better than this.  At 88 minutes it seemed overly long, and seems long only because the story tellers needed to add more length to it.  It might have worked better as a 30 minute OVA, but as a movie it was dull.",1377820800,,806,4.121794871794871
5564885,2,B00BACT1I4,"""Iron Man: Rise of Technovore"" is an anime movie made as a follow up of sorts to the 2010 Iron Man anime series. It's the second time that Marvel and the animation studio Madhouse have teamed up to tackle the golden avenger, but this time with a different writer, director, and team. Having seen and enjoyed the 12-episode anime, I was looking forward to watching this movie. Aside from the music and cast however, no other connection to the series can be found. In fact, they make more connections to the live action franchise than anything else.

The story opens with Iron Man (Keiji Fujiwara) and War Machine (Hiroki Yasumoto) goofing around in their armors prior to Tony's press release concerning his new ""Howard"" satellite. It's meant to watch over the entire planet in an effort to protect people from danger, and the media is in an uproar over its potential for invading people's privacy. Rightfully so. There's never a clear response for this from Tony unfortunately (I would have liked to hear his defense of it), as the site is attacked by a group of armored goons. They're in the service of Ezekiel Stane (Miyu Irino), the deranged son of Obadiah Stane, and he's out to destroy the planet. Why? It's not really clear. Something about technology...I don't know.

It's easy to discuss what's good about this movie because there's not much. First of all, the animation is quite nice. The characters and their armors all have interesting designs, particularly the shape shifting Technovore armor that Zeke wears. We also get a large variety of Marvel heroes, like War Machine, Black Widow, Nick Fury, Hawkeye, and even the Punisher. That's right, the Punisher's in this, too. The action is fast paced and frantic, making the Iron Man armor seem incredibly powerful and advanced. To match this, the original Japanese cast (those from the series reprised their roles) is quite good and sound fitting for the characters.

Unfortunately, the rest of the movie can't back up how nice it looks. The plot is paper thin, and the characters are about half that deep. After seeing quite a few of them now, it's safe to say that Iron Man stories tend to work the best when they're about Tony Stark. He's an incredibly complex and fascinating character to dissect and learn more about. It's a shame nobody told Brandon Auman, the guy who wrote this story, because Iron Man is just an action stand in here. He's a cartoon version of the human character most have come to know, stripped down to his bare basics, being bad one liners and plot convenient intelligence.

If the plot were at all intriguing, maybe they could get away with this. Perhaps by having an interesting and dangerous villain to make up the difference. No luck here, either. Ezekiel Stane is modified from the comics to be a generic young anime villain, seeking to destroy all mankind for the sake of his vague and lofty ideals. He spews pretentious dialogue devoid of greater meaning, often to a woman that's never explained. Who was she? Why did she hang around with this creep? I guess we'll never know.

The rest of the cast is just as bland, with Hawkeye (Shuuhei Sakaguchi) and Black Widow (Miyuki Shawashiro) serving as meaningless foils to Iron Man who's on the run. Why S.H.E.I.L.D. spends so much time and money trying to bring in Iron Man is beyond me. It's a flimsy excuse for more mind numbing action scenes that don't need to be there. If they would have just helped Iron Man find the bad guys instead of impeding his progress at every turn, the movie would have been over twice as fast. The time wasted on these would have been better served developing the characters; getting them invested in what's going on. Maybe they could have found something substantial for War Machine to do, instead of removing him from the majority of the movie. Or giving a better excuse for Iron Man and the Punisher, two characters on pretty opposite sides of the superhero spectrum, to team up. This is probably wishful thinking on my part, because the awkward script prevents the dialogue from making any of these characters matter.

""Iron Man: Rise of Technovore"" is a mediocre and generic foray into anime that had me wanting to just go back and watch the far superior show. Despite the nice animation, its visual success is dwarfed by the simplistic and uninteresting plot, wooden dialogue, bland villain, and excessive action.",1376870400,2,4391,4.771052631578947
5564886,4,B00BACT1I4,"I was very disappointed by the anime.  It was slow-paced and a little off-putting.  That said, it wasn't a bad show.  It just wasn't doing Iron Man justice.

Along came this movie, Rise of Technovore.  It was fast-paced, looked nice, and had a decent story.  Yes, it is still anime style.  Get over it.  What is wrong with the art style?  I love it.

I like this movie a lot, but it isn't quite as entertaining as the live action movies.  If you are an Iron Man fan, you will undoubtedly enjoy this movie, because it ties into the Marvel universe quite well.  For example, Shield plays a big part, and you get to see the Punisher in action.  The Black Widow and Hawkeye hunt Tony Stark (Iron Man) down.  The biggest issue for fans is Technovore's continuity.  In this movie, Technovore eats machinery and has a kind of bond with a human being and is somehow weakened by Tony's energy source. I still do not understand why Technovore is weakened by energy in this movie.  I prefer the original Technovore story from the comics, in which it was a parasite that acted similarly to The Borg from Star Trek and assimilated everything in sight.

4/5 for being very entertaining and looking pretty.  It doesn't offer enough for a fan of the comics but it is a nice supplemental material.  It was very enjoyable but could have used better writing.",1376784000,,1339,4.504166666666666

I know this will sound odd but I love anime and I love Marvel comics but this has to be the worst mix of the two. Ironman/Tony Stark felt like a cheap leftover anime character that got thrown into the mix last minute. The plot had so many holes and the parts that made sense bored you to all hell. Tony Stark was nowhere near his charming, witty, self-involved self, he was a bore. I know this will sound wrong, hard not to and people will totally miss the point I am trying to make but Tony Stark had entirely too many Japanese idiosyncrasies that it pulled away from the Marvel Character. If this was meant for a strictly anime audience then it works but for an Marvel audience looking for a Iron man movie, terrible. The villain was the biggest 2-D bore ( no pun intended ) I have seen in a long while, he was boring and beyond chiche.

The one redeemable thing about this entire movie? Norman Reedus, pretty damn good Punisher/Nick Castle.",1376524800,2,1036,4.34020618556701

Ezekiel stane is a great villain but the problem is that his dialogues are very strange. That's because he is traumatized.

Punisher and War Machine action scenes are small and they are just supporting characters. But they look great.

The only problem is that it is very short movie and the story is a little rushed. If you are waiting for a great movie with deep history and long action sequences, this movie disappointed.

5564892,4,B00BACT1I4,"With the success of the 2010 ""Iron Man"" anime series featuring a collaboration between Marvel Studios and Japanese animation studio Madhouse Inc.  The two companies collaborated once again for an direct-to-video animated film featuring Iron Man titled ""Iron Man: Rise of the Technovore"".

Featuring characters from the Marvel Universe such as Iron Man, War Machine, Black Widow, The Punisher, Hawkeye and S.H.I.E.L.D., the animated film will be released on Blu-ray and DVD in April 2013.

""Iron Man: Rise of the Technovore"" begins with Tony Stark/Iron Man and James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes/War Machine on a race against each other in their armor.  But immediately out of nowhere, unknown beings in armor begin attacking them.  Are they human?  Are they with a terrorist organization?

But when Tony Stark sees a boy being able to manipulate his armor, it's high technology which Tony Stark has never seen before.

And as the fight continues, both Tony and Rhodey are separated.  As Rhodey goes to look for Tony, a blast blows up the building that Rhodey was inside of.  And Tony fears that his friend may be dead.

As S.H.I.E.L.D. arrives to interrogate Tony and find out what caused all the destruction, Tony is unsure what caused the problem, but he knows that he saw a kid who has taken over high-technology or alien technology that surpasses his own technology.  But who is the arrogant boy that he confronted?

Needing some answers, Tony knows he must leave S.H.I.E.L.D. but Nick Fury tells Tony Stark that because he is the sole witness to what happened, it's important they keep him safe. But Tony, refuses to be a prisoner of S.H.I.E.L.D. and flies out to get some answers.

Angry at Tony for escaping, Nick Fury sends Black Widow and Hawkeye to retrieve Tony Stark, as well as his many soldiers at S.H.I.E.L.D.

But as Tony tries to get some answers of who may be involved...whether it was the terrorist organization A.I.M or someone else, while trying to get information in the Middle East, a well-known individual known as The Punisher is trying to eliminate them.

Needing to find answers quickly, before S.H.I.E.L.D., Black Widow and Hawkeye try to capture him, will the Frank Castle (The Punisher) help Tony Stark? And will he find out how this boy is possessing incredible power and why is he targeting Iron Man?

VIDEO:

""Iron Man: Rise of the Technovore"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  As one can expect from animation studio Madhouse Inc.  Art backgrounds look fantastic, CG rocks look very good but also the city landscape looks well-detailed.  Animation is well-shaded and the character designs are very awesome.  Colors are vibrant and sharp, I detected no banding issues or artifacts during my viewing of the film.

If anything, you do notice the quality differences from the previous TV series vs. an animated film.  ""Iron Man: Rise of the Technovore"" looks great on Blu-ray!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Iron Man: Rise of the Technovore"" is presented in English and Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  the film is also presented in Spanish, Portuguese and Thai 5.1 Dolby Digital.  First, let me discuss the lossless audio.  As one can expect from a Marvel animated release, each film I have watched, has utilized the surround channels effectively and with this film, a great use of surround channels from Iron Man and War Machine flying, to the various destruction and weapons utilized in the film...the soundtrack is rather active.  Good amount of LFE and for the most part, a solid lossless soundtrack.

Both are well-acted but there are differences in translation between the Japanese and English release.  If anything, the English dubbed version reflects a style that captures how the characters are in the comic book, while the Japanese version is slightly changed in dialogue.  Both work well, it's just when Frank Castle makes a sarcastic remark to Tony Stark, you expect that sadistic humor from Castle, while in the Japanese version, it's more subdued and not as violent.

As for subtitles, subtitles are provided in English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese (Mandarin Simplified), Chinese (Mandarin Traditional), Korean, Thai/

JUDGMENT CALL:

As a long time reader of Marvel Comics and an anime fan, ""Iron Man: Rise of the Technovore"" is a storyline that appeals to both old school and new school Marvel fans who love the character of Iron Man but also anime fans who appreciate the quality that comes from a major anime studio such as Mad House.

The partnership between both Marvel and Madhouse have been fantastic as I really like how much mature and darker, the anime series have been.

First, the storyline.  The storyline centers around the antagonist known as the Technovore which was first featured in 1993 in ""Iron Man"" issue #294.  In the original comic book series, Tony Stark was the creator of Technovore, which was intended to be a virus.  The computer program combined with nanobots and would eventually become an antagonist towards Iron Man and also War machine.

In the animated film, Ezekiel Stane (the estranged son of Tony Stark antagonist, Obadiah Stane), has found a way to combine with the Technovore and create a suit that incorporates technology that is far advanced from the technology that Stark Enterprises uses.

After the Technovore levels the city, S.H.I.E.L.D. wants to protect Tony Stark because he is the only witness to who was the cause of the destruction.  Tony being the person who does things his way, flies out to get some answers, while S.H.I.E.L.D. is not too thrilled with Tony Stark escaping.  So, S.H.I.E.L.D. sends the Black Widow and Hawkeye to retrieve Tony Stark.

As Tony tries to find out if the terrorist organization A.I.M. is being used, he eventually has an uneasy alliance with The Punisher.  And the fact that you get quite a few kick butt characters like War Machine, Black Widow and Hawkeye is a major plus.  Also, throw in a storyline that incorporates Pepper (Tony Stark's assistant and girlfriend) a bit more as well as members of S.H.I.E.L.D. including Nicky Fury, you know that you're going to get a lot of action and battles.

But as a fan of the characters, it was great to see a fresh storyline but also cool characters including cool character designs.  The fighting is well-animated but Madhouse did a great job for the art backgrounds.  Beautifully painted backgrounds, as well as CG backgrounds, well-shaded characters, great mechanical design...there is a lot of things going on in this series that looks very good and it's fascinating to see how the Japanese did with the character designs of Black Widow (which are fantastic), The Punisher and also Hawkeye (kind of reminds me of ""G.I. Joe"" leader Duke), but from the design of Iron Man, War Machine and the other robots and attack planes, I thought everything came together very well and for an animated film, Marvel did a great thing by working with Madhouse!

Voice acting is well-done for both Japanese and English, but as mentioned, if you watch both, you will notice a slight difference in dialogue.  The Japanese is slightly subdued when compared to its more in-your-face dialogue that is featured on the English dub.  But with awesome picture quality, lossless audio is immersive and definitely an active soundtrack which was very cool.  You also get three special features included on the Blu-ray release.

Overall, ""Iron Man: Rise of the Technovore"" is an action-packed, thrilling animated film featuring one of Marvel Comics' iconic characters, Iron Man plus appearances by a few other well-known names from the Marvel Universe.  The Japanese treatment of the series from Madhouse looks and sounds wonderful on Blu-ray.  If you love Iron Man and love anime, ""Iron Man: Rise of the Technovore"" is definitely recommended!",1372896000,,8667,5.0160951714485655

5564908,3,B00BACT1I4,"MINOR spoilers ahead.  Be warned, anyway.

The success of the first Iron Man movie seems to have been completely unexpected by Marvel, since with the exception of Avengers: EMH, every other adaptation of the character they've tried to do outside of comics and live action movies after it has ranged from poor to mediocre, and this, sadly, is no exception.

This movie is a sequel to Iron Man 2.  Not a spiritual sequel or anything like that, it clearly uses plot points from the live action Iron Man films and more or less the same version of their characters.  Except tuned down to make them less dimensional.  You'd remember Tony Stark from the live-action films as a sarcastic wise cracker.  Here he likes to say a bunch of things that are not jokes but he likes to think they are.  The banter between characters is ridiculous instead of funny and the dialog is pretty much terrible and cliche.

The basic plot for this movie is: Stark sends to orbit a satellite which can access every computer in the world.  Stupidly, they actually let him do it.  Yeah, a couple of people protest, but I guess the governments of the world are perfectly OK with a private industrialist being able to take control of everything when he feels like.  Anyway, predictably, a villain wants to use this satellite, and tries to take him by using biotechnology so powerful that Iron Man is hopeless to stop him from killing everyone in a launch site.  After that, Tony has to race against the clock while trying to find this person while evading the forces of S.H.I.E.L.D. who want to attack him for... reasons.

So, a villain with an organic tech armor who is capable of detroying everyone in sight.  Should be an interesting enemy for Iron Man to defeat, if there was any consistency in him.  You see, the guy shows up at the beginning of the film, kills everyone in the launch site and overpowers Iron Man so hard he's completely powerless to stop him.  And then... he leaves.  Why doesn't he kill Iron Man?  He needs him for something, right?  No, Iron Man is nothing but an obstacle in his path, he says so himself later in the film.  Yet every single chance he gets to kill Iron Man he decides to stand there and recite some poetry instead.

Oh, yeah, he's one of THOSE villains.  You know, those who try to seem profound by talking with fancy words and nonsensical messages.  Those who EVERYONE hates.  By the way, if you're interested in knowing how he got that armor of his, good luck.  He has a connection to Tony's past, but as it turns out, it's just a coincidence.  He's not there for revenge.  I'll give him THAT point over the live-action films villains, who all have a grudge against Tony.

How about the other cast?  There's Pepper, who is taken out of her vacation to do something that J.A.R.V.I.S. could easily do faster (but, you know, padding).  There are Black Widow and Hawkeye, who are reduced to play the Coyote to Iron Man's Road Runner.  There's Nick Fury, who's wasted and turned into a bipolar psychopath (also, I find it quite irritating how his voice actor can't decide if he wants to imitate Samuel L. Jackson or not).  There's the Punisher in a glorified cameo who is the only one who gets good lines (and top billing, apparently).  And then there's War Machine, who... well I think a more aproppiate name would be ""Deus Ex War Machina"".

What do we have so far?  A boring villain, bad dialogue, bad characterization for main and secondary characters, what am I forgetting about?  Oh, yeah... the bad writing and the STUPIDITY.  I mentioned a little about the villain not killing Iron Man when he gets the chance.  On the other side of the spectrum we have Nick Fury, who decides he doesn't want Iron Man to get killed by the villain because he's a witness, so his great idea is to... kill him himself.  That's right, he wants to protect Iron Man from death, but when Iron Man refuses to be protected and goes away he sends people to kill him.  I can't even begin to stress how ridiculous this is.

It's like they just wanted to have a lot of action but they didn't want to spend more than a couple of seconds in trying to justify it.  So yeah, while Iron Man is out there trying to save the world from a supervillain the top powerful spy agency in charge of doing the very thing Iron Man is doing spends its time and resources trying to kill the man doing their job.  Your taxes at work, gentlemen.

I also have to point out that Tony Stark, for being supposedly a super genius is quite the idiot sometimes.  He never, for instance, even entertains the idea of destroying the damn satellite the villain wants to use to control the planet.  And when he eventually saves the day (I don't think I ruin the story by telling you this) it's only because he just happened to remember he had the solution all along.  That's right, this would fit right in on an episode of Super Friends.

So, what's good about this?  The animation is pretty good.  The art style is good if you like anime, but I feel it doesn't fit for all characters, specially the Punisher, who looks too much like a classic anime pretty boy.  A shame since he's the best character in this mess.

So, if you're really curious, I recommend you rent it.  Or wait until someone does and watch it with them, like I did.  I can't recommend you purchase this thing because it's not worth it.  It's a watch-once-and-forget-about-it kind of film.  An absolute shame, since Marvel is really, REALLY behind DC in the animated features department.  But if people actually buy these, they're going to think they're doing a good job, and we really have to make them know that isn't true.",1369353600,,5648,4.502952755905512

5564916,5,B00BACT1I4,"I am a comic artist / writer. I've been an Iron Man fan since I was like 5. I am very familiar with all the subject matter going on in this film; Iron Man, Comics, Comic Movies, Anime-- It's all in my wheelhouse.

I'd heard these Madhouse Marvel interpretations weren't all THAT amazing (specifically, the Wolverine one). Then, seeing all the 1 and 2-star reviews of this movie, I felt that claim must be true.

But, having watched it, I can't really understand why this movie is getting such a bad rap.

Maybe it's because people are expecting a movie similar in theme / tone to the live action Robert Downey Jr. films. Well, yeah, no, RDJ is not in this film. This is not that kind of film. If you're looking for RDJ winks and asides, you won't find them here (although the movie does try it's best to replicate the new, quipping RDJ-style Tony Stark-- To reasonably well effect here). This movie is not an emotional character piece.

What this movie IS: is a true IRON MAN action spectacle. Tony is IN HIS ARMOR for about 90% of the movie (which I love). This movie is less about Tony Stark, more about the powerful armors he, his friend Rhodey, and the new mysterious villain employ. So, if after 3 films of pleasant RDJ-asides, you are looking for more of a straight-up Armored Iron Man Action Fest: this is your flick.

What's even cooler about this movie: It actually ties into the story built thus far in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. They mention events that occur in the previous Iron Man films, including references to Obediah Stane and appearances from other Avengers, Nick Fury, Black Widow and Hawkeye, who I felt were pretty well represented in this movie. Hawkeye specifically is a hoot in this flick.

The Punisher even shows up, voiced by Norman Reedus (""Daryl"" from Walking Dead). Which is interesting, but it somehow fits. It helps that this Punisher is a bit more youthful seeming. Some people might wonder WHAT Punisher is doing in an Iron Man flick, but that's just how COMIC BOOKS work.

There's a lot of humor in this movie, too. Some good one liners. This isn't just throwaway anime garbage-- they actually really tried to replicate some of the swagger and sass the original Iron Man movie / Avengers movie had.

Rhodey: ""Man, am I glad you're alive!""
Tony: ""Not as much as me!""

That's good stuff.

Sure, the story is a LITTLE strange. But seriously, it is not that bad or hard to follow. It has some emotional fugue-ness to it at times (a standard trope in most anime), but for every weird, preachy villain scene (of which there are like 2 or 3)-- there are at least 10 awesome action set pieces where Iron Man gets to really strut his stuff.

And STRUT HIS STUFF HE DOES. If there's one thing MADHOUSE knows how to do, it's animate the HECK out of Iron Man. Iron Man's suits have never looked this cool, in the live action movies or otherwise. Iron Man himself is deftly animated, with a slightly new look. And WAR MACHINE is up there with any heavily armed GUNDAM. He's just MASSIVE. It's amazing.

They make use of integrating CG with the animation, sometimes it looks a little stiff-- but when it works, it REALLY works.

Giving this movie a 5-star rating to hopefully level out the unjustifiable 2-star rating it currently has.

Don't listen to the haters. If you're looking for a good time with Iron Man, and you're at least REMOTELY an anime fan, there's a lot to like in IRON MAN: RISE OF TECHNOVORE",1368576000,10,3436,4.538834951456311

It's really difficult to believe that you can mix a good idea for a threat to a cast of several beloved characters and end up with something this bad.

One of the other reviews mentions that he thought the animation was pretty good.  Well... no.  The art for the film wasn't bad, but animation is how you put those images into motion.  An example is that when we first see Nick Fury, it's a nice version of him, artistically framed.  But, over the next three scenes with him, we are looking at the same still frame in which the only thing that ever moves is his mouth when he talks.  So we have some of the most realistic, detailed images of our hero's animated in the very least life-like way possible.

The fact is that this is an average subpar anime movie with a veneer of Marvel overlaid.  They've even reduced Technovore to an average anime ""demon"", with the mandatory tentacles and tendrils.  This combined with all the ultra close-ups showing only half of a person's face, the overlong scenes with that seemed to be placed to set mood, but in actuality there was just nothing happening and the bad poetry and worse philosophical rantings, puts this one in the category of the worst thing I have ever seen from Marvel.

 Watching the action scenes are the least of the problems.  As I was watching this I was thinking that if you took any non action scene and took a 45 second excerpt out of it to show someone, no matter where you took the excerpt from, it would be enough to convince most people that they shouldn't waste their time with this one.  There is good anime out there; this isn't it.  There is good Marvel animation out there; this isn't it.

Also the humor and dialogues are Japanese so it may or may not make sense to you.

Finally, I like the concept work of the villian in this movie, but where is the action? Action is one thing I love about the Japanese anime.

5564937,4,B00BACT1I4,"After the somewhat successful run of the anime series on what was once G4, Marvel decided to make another production of the Armored Avenger, but this one seems to tie into the Iron Man/Avengers live-action movie franchise. The Marvel Anime lineup included Iron Man, Wolverine, X-Men, and Blade, which were more or less all in the same continuity. Although this particular movie could be completely removed from that established ""universe"", even though it does hint at other Marvel incarnations like Asgard and the Savage Land. It was animated by Madhouse, who also handled the other Marvel anime series, as well as a few other original Marvel animation movies like Planet Hulk. So at least you know Marvel was off to a good start with this production.

Tony Stark(aka: Iron Man)is unveiling his new satellite named the Howard which is supposed to provide recon for the entire world warning of any threats as they surface. However, Ezekiel Stane, son Obadiah(aka: Iron Monger), seeks to use the Howard to destroy life on Earth with his new Technovore technology. The Technovore was a one-shot creation by the supervillain group AIM in the comics, but here its the creation of Ezekiel, and is sort of like a techno-organic version of the Venom symboite from Spider-Man. After Rhodey(aka: War Machine)was injured after the attack, Tony is on the run from SHIELD while trying to unravel the identity of this new enemy. Stark rendezvous with the Punisher in the Middle East for intel on Ezekiel, but is interrupter by Black Widow and Hawkeye, which leads to a great chase between the four heroes. Iron Man finally confronts the Technovore, with all of SHIELD and War Machine having to stop this menace from wiping out all life on Earth.

The animation in this is very dynamic. It was directed by Hiroshi Hamasaki, whose previous works include Ninja Scroll and Perfect Blue, and his style really comes through, especially in most of the bombastic action sequeneces. It makes you wonder why there aren't more anime with people in armored suits(not including ""magical armor). Do yourself a big favor and get the Blu-Ray to fully appreciate the total scope of the animation. Also, don't bother with any of the other language settings except for the English dub because the dialogue is way more fitting for fans of the Marvel comics and movies.",1367193600,2,2334,4.9363867684478375

One thing I did, against my better judgement, was to watch the English dubbed version (I was watching with my eleven year old son and he's not sold on foreign films quite yet). As I switched to the English version, the subtitles were on screen for a brief time and I noticed they were different from the English dialog. The English version basically said the same thing as the subtitles, but the spoken dialog was much simpler. I wonder now if the subtitled version might have better writing and thus a better movie...unfortunately, I have no desire to put any time into finding out (my son didn't even stay around to watch the whole thing, he left after the Punisher/Widow/Hawkeye scene).",1367020800,4,1055,4.494791666666667

5564946,3,B00BACT1I4,"At first I wasn't sure why so many were going to give this DVD bad reviews. Most commentaries were over the animation and dialogue.

Having watched the movie now, I can see where they are coming from.

From where I sit, Rise of the Technovore is a standard, mediocre anime with a Marvel character, covering and flavor to it.

It's a decent enough anime style if you don't mind how white washed it will be. The lines are rather rote and forced at times. If it didn't have the Marvel name and Iron Man attached to it, this would be one of thousands of animes that's out there and is quickly forgotten because it looks like all of the rest with this technological monster going to destroy the world, tentacles sprouting from it and the hero comes in with everything at dire odds and impossible to win the day yet he does so.

I can see why there are complaints of Punisher's appearance and cameo in this movie being so lack luster. And then Hawkeye and Blackwidow weren't much better off either.

If you look at this as standard anime fare, this is okay, watch it once and forget it. Move on to the next anime in the pile to watch.

But that this has the Marvel name and characters attached to it and the newest Marvel dvd movie out since the end of the MLG Productions and Lionsgate contract and the whole Disney now owns Marvel. People have a right to be upset. I'm glad we have a new dvd movie and that there's a promise of more Marvel Animated movies coming. But more could have been done. The animators could have done better.

Take a page from DC and WB and actually take some comic lines and adapt them to animation like they have. In the mean time, if this is what we continue to see, yes DC is going to own the arena for the direct to dvd animated movies. They are doing better when it comes to direct to dvds and television series.",1366502400,8,1838,4.279538904899136

Then again, just having him even in it was great. The art in this is beautiful. I frequently found myself stopping to admire the illustrations.

If you're expecting this to be like the live-action movies, it's not. This is an anime. If you don't like anime, you may not like this movie. In fact, when I started the disc up, the primary language is Japanese not English as Amazon suggests. As an anime, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I have all of the other Marvel Animations movies and this one is probably my favorite.

As for the movie, I'm not sure if this is typical Anime but IMHO Marvel made a big mistake doing it in this style.  The one thing I noticed right away was that it defaults to spoken Japanese with English subtitles.  When I switched the audio to English the subtitles remained but throughout the movie the audio English and the subtitles showed differences in dialogue.  I understand that for some things there may be no direct translation but there were some pretty large differences in quite a few instances and that to me was fairly annoying.
The whole movie for me had poorly written dialogue, VERY bad animation and the story just seemed to plod along.  The only reason I watched the whole thing was to see how it ended, totally not worth it, don't waste your time.  There are several things that just don't have much story support, like why SHIELD seems to try and kill Iron Man when he disagrees with them.  Then the Technovore character .. Horrible !!

5564950,4,B00BACT1I4,"I think the problem many other reviewers are having with this movie is that it is very much in keeping with a particular genre of Japanese anime...  I'm not an expert on anime but the style and tempo of the script seemed very much like the Ergo Proxy, Last Exile, or Count of Monet Cristo anime series or the Ghost in the Shell anime movie.  A lot of silence, metaphors about nature, and an underlying theme related to an Eastern perspectives on Western culture.  For instance, the story antagonist's female companion reads Nietzsche to him as he ponders floating white balls while an old-style gramophone plays.  The first 45 seconds of the movie is completely silent and features the struggle between ants and bigger bugs.  That kind of thing.  So, not really your average Saturday Morning fare.

So folks looking for a kick ass American-style Iron Man movie are just going to end up bewildered and disappointed.  However,  if you are interested in a cultural twist on the Marvel characters, and have a passing interest in cinematic styles relating to Japanese animation, you might enjoy this.

I can't speak for everyone, but subtitles take my attention away from the actual film. Instead of watching the action, I get too focused on reading the dialogue.

So, for me, this was highly unwatchable, and a waste of my $4.99.",1366243200,7,404,4.534246575342466
5564953,1,B00BACT1I4,"I can't even get through this movie. First off, it defaulted to Japanese with English subtitles. Fortunately, I was able to adjust that on my blu ray player.  However, the animation style is harsh on the eyes and truly, this was a huge waste of money.  Wait for it to stream on a service you already pay for, don't spend any extra money on it.",1366243200,3,343,4.2615384615384615
5564954,3,B00BACT1I4,"This is a classic example of Marvel outsourcing its animation; this movie was created almost wholly by an anime studio (Mad House of Trigun and Deathnote fame) with the American studio having very little input. So from that perspective, it succeeds as an anime film. The animation is gorgeous and there is the feeling of world-ending plots and over-the-top villains that are more android than human in their actions. If you're a fan of anime, it's all stuff you've seen before, and you might quite enjoy it.

That said, if you're watching this for the Iron Man feature, you may not want to bother. The narration itself is very disjointed, and the characters are all pretty two-dimensional as another reviewer pointed out. The story is spotty, and it seems like it makes very little sense (why would Nick Fury actively being trying to kill Tony Stark with mandroids? So that there is an excuse to put in more exciting action/mecha scenes, of course!) There's spotty science, and no one seems to be bothered by the question that's set up in the first five minutes of the film which is ""Is it okay to send a giant spy satellite into space to spy on people's every move as a crime prevention measure?"" The answer seems to be yes, because while that would make for a spectacular plot, that's not what the movie's about.

If by some chance you're a big Ezekiel Stane fan from the comics, you're the one who will be most disappointed at all. Ezekiel is nothing like his 616 counterpart. He is detached from reality, and has zero redeeming qualities. He looks about 14 and Tony Stark repeatedly talks about how he's stepping in as the adult to ""scold"" him for his best friend's murder. There is nothing of the conniving, off-the-rails Zeke from the comics.

You can rent this movie from multiple digital sources. If you absolutely NEED to see it, renting is the better alternative to buying it.",1366243200,33,1886,4.674698795180723
5564955,1,B00BACT1I4,Poor storyline and pitiful animation. It's as though it was rushed through with the idea of making a quick buck rather than appeasing the customer,1366156800,2,146,4.88
5564956,2,B00BACT1I4,"Been an avid Marvel fan who also loves Anime, the announcement of ""Iron-Man Rise of Technovore"" got me excited at the possibilities that we might witness when the movie gets released this month. To make it even more exciting, other Marvel heroes were confirmed to appear in the anime, such as Hawkeye, Black Widow, Nick fury, and even punisher. So you can understand how excited i was when i fired up the blu-ray of ""Rise of Technovore"", turned off the light and hoped for the best.

Story:

Now, since this is a spoiler-free review, i will not get into the plot's details, however what i will say is that the story is disjoint, and feels sometimes moronic, especially in the first half of the movie. Some of the dialogues can really be cringe worthy. Having been written by, Brandon Auman, the same writer who gave us the excellent ""To Steal an ant-Man"" episode of avengers EMH, i could not help but feel disappointed. Some of the characters are there for almost no reason (i am looking at you Punisher even though you are awesome). Other characters are written as philosophical and say the weirdest nonsensical lines you would ever hear in a Marvel media (i am looking at you Zeke Stane). The plot is written to be part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, however some elements feel very redundant to the Avengers Movie (like the bad guy wants to be taken on board of the SHIELD Helicarrier to cause chaos and then crash it). Anyway, suffice to say that this is the only Marvel related media that almost put me to sleep form boredom. Very Disappointed!

Video:

After reading the previous reviews that went online yesterday i was hoping the reviewers were exaggerating in term of how bad the video quality is. Unfortunately they are not. The colors are washed out, the imagery has a very annoying lighting effect that really hurt the eyes (i had to reduce my Tv's brightness for this movie). For a 2013 Blu-ray animation Iron-Man rise of Technovore leaves a LOT to be desired.

The backgrounds are VERY empty and generic, and some of them are lousy CGI, and as far as the animation goes, it is pretty generic (Except for an AWESOME Iron-Man 2 style suiting up of tony). Background characters have barely a face, and a lot of times the main characters only moving part is their lips, giving the movie a low budget TV anime series feel. The Iron-man rendition toggles between hand drawn animation (which is great) and CGI, the latter i found less distracting that the 2010 Iron-Man series by the same studio.

Not everything is grim though, the main characters design is pretty great, and some of the fight scenes are dynamic and well choreographed, we just hoped the rest of the movie aspects fared as well.

All in all, i really expected more from Marvel's reentering to the Home Video market.

Audio:

Unlike the Story and Video, Audio on Iron-Man: Rise of Technovore is good. Voice acting is decent with some odd choices (Norman Reedus as Punisher, really?). Explosions rock your room and the soundtrack itself is very fitting.

Summary:

Having waited for this anime since the day it was announced, i can't express how disappointed i am from the final result. The strange movie plot, cheesy dialogues, eyes hurting imagery and low budget animation makes Iron-Man: Rise of Technovore an embarrassment to the Direct to Video Super Hero Genre, especially when company's rival (DC Animation) is producing 3 QUALITY features a year. Better step up your game Marvel!",1366156800,4,3463,4.745424292845258

5564958,1,B00BACT1I4,"Marvel may have live action superhero films down to pat but their animated efforts suck big time.

Why do companies insist on this awful, unwatchable Jap-style animation with its washed out colour, lack of detail and hazy overlit look ?

Couple with a stupid, incoherent storyline and poor voice talent and you have a monumental stinker.

Watch this at your peril !",1366070400,5,365,4.854838709677419
5564959,2,B00BACT1I4,"After watching an early screener, I came away wondering what was worse...the writing or the voice acting.  This was bad from the get-go.  While none of the Marvel anime has been great so far (Blade being the best, IMHO), this was just awful and the worst by far.  The characters were one dimensional, the story was disjointed and the dialogue of the villain was next to impossible to follow. It was clear to see what the writers were trying to do, but they kept missing the mark.  You'd think an Iron Man story with Hawkeye, Black Widow, and the Punisher would have to go out of it's way to be bad.  Well, that is exactly what this did.  For half of the film, Stark is running from SHIELD mandroids.  How is that the development of a story?  It's not.  It is a means for putting together a lot of robot fight scenes.  But if I wanted to watch Macross, I would.

I give this 2 big thumbs down.",1365638400,4,892,4.25
