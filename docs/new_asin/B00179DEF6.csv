8265474,2,B00179DEF6,"My 20 month old did not want to watch even the first story. There is some narration voice-over rather than the characters talking the entire time so maybe she was turned off by it. She much prefers the Leapfrog Letter Factory for learning the alphabet (always requesting it!).  Will give it a few more shots and see if she likes it more. As a parent, the quality of the product seems ok, not really too much fun though. I also much prefer the Leapfrog Letter Factory!",1344988800,,467,4.430232558139535
8265475,4,B00179DEF6,"Short and sweet. I started looking for these videos when my daughter was 18 months old. Now at almost 3, she still loves them. I'd recommend ANY of the Little People videos. They are great and even though they are a bit commercial (because they are related to a toy) they are still super cute, super sweet, and perfect for the preschool set.",1289001600,,341,4.428571428571429
8265476,5,B00179DEF6,"My son received a Little People toy (farm) for his birthday and it came with a Little People DVD.  He absolutely fell in love with the DVD and it became a daily ritual of watching it before bedtime. So, naturally I had to find other Little People DVDs and this is one that we bought for him. He loved it just as much as the other one!  I love how there are little episodes and they each last about a minute long so my son will stay interested. This is the perfect little movie to pop in!",1288051200,,487,4.010309278350515
