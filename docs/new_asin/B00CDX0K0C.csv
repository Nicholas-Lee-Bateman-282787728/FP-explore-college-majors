Super low budget and the acting is about as terrible as it get. I have seen youtube videos in high school way better than this. I tried to stick it out to the end where everyone dies and couldn't take the bad acting anymore. Also the dream sequences were on par with someone getting high, fogging up a camera, and filming it. The best part about this movie was giving it the one star it deserved.",1407024000,,511,4.069306930693069
8580681,5,B00CDX0K0C,"Being a huge fan of shows like Ghost Hunters, I was really excited when I saw the trailer for G.H.O.S.T.  The plot drew on specific aspects of real ghost hunting shows which I really enjoyed.  The camera work has a similar feel to Paranormal Activity and The Blair Witch Project which always makes the viewer feel like they are there with the actors.  I felt that this style made the movie more scary because I felt like I was in the action. I definitely jumped several times which made the movie really fun to watch.  Although it starts off with a similar theme to many scary movies out there, the ending sets this movie apart.  I did not see the twist at the end coming which made the movie unpredictable.  It was refreshing to watch a movie that was still scary, but had an original plot line.  Don't be afraid to add G.H.O.S.T. to your collection of scary movies.",1390608000,2,867,4.415094339622642
