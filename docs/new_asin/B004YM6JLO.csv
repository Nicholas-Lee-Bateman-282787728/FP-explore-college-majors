4500527,3,B004YM6JLO,"Despite the fact that I have given this series a three star I do love it. However, I fear that the plot through the last two seasons has moved so quickly that it is running out of it's fresh play between the supernatural creatures. The first have of this season is the typical nail biting lusty action. Unfortunately the end is rushed and a little silly. Too many characters are killed off. And is it just me or is there some crazy spell to avoid every mishap they stumble into? The only good thing about the end of this season is that it may mark the beginning of a relationship between Damon and Elena.",1318204800,13,604,4.307017543859649
4500528,1,B004YM6JLO,"I'm in the US Military, serving overseas, but since I'm outside of the US, I cannot watch anything from Amazon downloads! I am a US citizen and it's not fair that I have to wait until the whole season becomes available on DVD or Blu-Ray to see these episodes! I'm willing to pay for these episodes just like anyone else, so why can't I purchase these episodes just because I'm stationed overseas! I do have a US credit card and my billing address is a US address, so what's the big deal??? Aside from that, I LOVE THE SERIES!",1317686400,4,525,4.313131313131313

4500530,5,B004YM6JLO,"This episode changes everything between Alena and Damon. There is also a very impressive twist with Claus.
The only draw back is that it is hard to change to a new episode. I give this five stars.",1317168000,,196,4.324324324324325
4500531,5,B004YM6JLO,"I admit, I am hooked on this show!  I watch it with my pre-teen daughter and it appeals to both of us for very different reasons.  The fact that both an 11-year old and her 47-year old mother enjoy it is a true testament to just how good it really is.  The story keeps moving, always keeping you more than interested and on your toes.  I look forward to each and every week.  And for those that compare the show to the other vamp stories (Twilight, etc.) out there, PLEASE DON'T!  Vampire Diaries (both the books and the show) blows them all out of the water.",1316649600,9,559,4.226415094339623

If you have never seen it, don't start with season 3.... too much happens in EVERY episode, and they can fit so much action in 1 season, it feels more like 3 seasons!!!! So if you don't start with season 1, episode 1, then you will be crazy lost!!! Start at the beginning, you won't be disappointed!!!

As a review of the show itself, I grew up watching The Vampire Diaries and I still think it is the best show out there. Especially the first couple of seasons, you will be very addicted and so driven into their world, you will fall in love with characters and hate others, but the plots and twists are just insanely good.

4501017,4,B004YM6JLO,"This was the last good season of The Vampire Diaries in my opinion, and the best season of the series over all. It continued developing the stories of the main characters, without introducing too many new ones. It was also the last season with any sensible historical flashbacks, and the last season of individual story arcs that weren't (quite) ridiculous and over the top.

I can't speak to how well this series matches the novels as I tried reading them but couldn't get into them. They are too YA for me, and the series departed quite significantly from the books beginning with Season 1, so it's like comparing apples and oranges.

I stopped watching early in Season 5. Season 4 just went in one wrong direction after another (starting with the sire bond -- ugh), so I should have stopped with Season 4.

Season 3 is my favorite season. From jump, The Vampire Diaries was not a very well written show (my god, the pilot was cliche piled on cliche). It also suffered from changes in the writing and producing teams, as the original producers and writers moved into other shows. But the characters -- and the actors playing them -- made up for the poor writing.  Season 3 had fewer continuity errors (both in terms of previous episodes and in terms of character destruction). At least until Season 4, when the writing just took a steeper nose dive than it had in the previous three seasons.

In looking back on it, in my opinion, there is no reason to watch Season 4 or 5 (or 6) at all. If you care the most about the romantic triangle (Stefan, Elena, and Damon), and you care most about the trio of friends (Bonnie, Caroline, and Elena), plus Jeremy and Matt -- just stop here at Season 3. It all gets much worse and their characters are assassinated over the remaining seasons -- Bonnie is especially badly (and repeatedly) exploited as a mere plot device/deus ex machina, again and again.

But I guess that's what good fanfic is for: correcting the madness of bad writing teams and the contradictions of writers who obviously haven't seen previous episodes or tracked the character development over the episodes they *didn't* write.

Obviously, this is just my opinion, but many, many fans -- who watched TVD from the start -- agree with this assessment.",1426636800,,2260,4.663316582914573

4501198,1,B004YM6JLO,I thought the first two seasons were great but I didn't like this one. I stopped watching late in Season 2 because it was turning into the Werewolf Diaries. I thought I'd give it another shot on Blu-ray since I like Nina Dobrev. The originals kind of ruined this season for me yet they got their own series which I will never watch. I know the main villain was Klaus but I hated Cole more even though he wasn't in that many episodes. Elijah mumbles through his lines and is about as interesting as watching paint dry. Elena is so wishy-washy. She's always trying to protect everyone even Elijah who basically screwed everyone over and the end of season 2 by not killing Klaus. They end up getting hurt or killed anyways. I liked what Katherine said in the second season about her dull as dishwater doppelganger Elena. I thought the evil Alaric thing was lame. I don't recommend this season. There are very few re-watchable episodes. I think this show peaked too soon. Season 4 is slightly better than this one but that's not saying much.,1413936000,,1037,4.550802139037433

4501262,3,B004YM6JLO,"I almost didn't watch this season. Because, I hated what that hybrid bastard did to Stefan at the end of Season 2. He DID NOT have to blackmail Stefan into becoming a Ripper again to save Damon. I know why he did it, when he saw the life that Stefan had that he didn't have, he wanted to ruined it. Stefan had love, friendship & loyalty that he had earned. But ""Reckoning"" was hands-down the worst episode for me, when Klaus compelled Stefan to turn-off his humanity, I cried so damn hard. I wasn't a big fan of Damon during this season either, Stefan was forced to sacrifice everything to save his life...and, yet, here he is trying to steal the love of his life. NOT COOL. Damon didn't come to his senses until the ""1912"" episode, when he reminded Stefan that he tried to help him before he went off the edge, that scene was extremely touching, especially when Damon said to Stefan ""You're all I got"". I also liked when Stefan & Damon discovered that Alaric was killing people due to the effects of the Gilbert ring. There was some Damon's lines, that did crack me up:
The Hybrid: What's your big plan, Elena? You're going to walk through a campsite of werewolves, roast a marshmallow, and wait for Stefan to stop by?
Ghost World: I think you got your voodoo wires all crossed when you got rid of Vicki Donovan. Because, I'm pretty sure that I just got spit-roasted by Mason Lockwood's ghost. Maybe, because he chained me to a chair & shoved a hot poker in my chest. Let's just say I'm having deja-vu. I don't have time for vengeful Lockwood, when I kill someone, they're supposed to stay dead. Whatever you screwed up, fix it.
Break On Through: Just making sure that the witch didn't turn you into a toad or block of salt. Bonnie did a little spell, nothing to worry about, just something to keep the killer in you at bay. Let's just say you've got an alter-ego hellbent on killing council members.

EPIC MOMENT:
After everything....Elena CHOOSES Stefan! I cried because, Stefan told Elena in ""Don't Go Gentle"", that the reason he was acting out was because after bit Elena, he never wanted to feel anything again. That scene in the gym was something that I been waiting FOREVER to see. Since, we are possibly approaching what could be the Final Season of ""The Vampire Diaries"", I hope that Elena comes to her senses & chooses Stefan, just like she did in the ""Season 4"" opener. Because, Stefan has sacrificed so much...not just for Elena, but for Damon as well. Examples:

Season 1 - Fool Me Once: Stefan sacrifices his freedom, when he hears Elena scream from inside the tomb; After everything Damon has done, Stefan begs him to leave the tomb with him, before they both end up being trapped.
Season 2 - Rose: Stefan apologizes to Damon, for forcing him to complete his transition.
Season 2 - The Sacrifice: Stefan once again sacrifices his freedom to save Jeremy, when Katherine tries to kill him.
Season 2 - The Dinner Party: He SAVES Damon (again!) when he learns that Damon will die, if he uses the dagger.
Season 2 - The Sun Also Rises: He OFFERS himself to be sacrificed to save Jenna's life...
Season 3: Ordinary People: He saves Damon (how many times has he done that now) when Mikael is about to rip out Damon's heart.

Family is everything to Stefan, and that's who Elena should be with, someone who puts family before anything else. Because, if somebody would've told me, how many times Stefan would save Damon's life, when I started watching ""The Vampire Diaries"" I would have laughed in their face.",1409443200,,3516,4.542586750788644

What I love about owning the Blu-Ray is that it looks so much better than streaming and you can binge. Also, if you know TVD, you know there are a LOT of commercials so with Blu-Ray you can watch uninterrupted which is very nice. If you are new to this series, get started - you won't be disappointed.

Also the digital copies aren't compatible with iTunes, which is a bit of a disappointment for me.

4501368,3,B004YM6JLO,"I bought this DVD since I had a majority of these episodes on windows media player and itunes, however I didn't have them in one place hence purchasing this DVD. I  bought the fourth season since I didn't have any episodes. Anyways I have enjoyed the Vampire Diaries since the beginning, season one, however the plots have become predictable and aren't as intriguing as the earlier plot twists and writing. Season three is about Elena's relationship transition from Stefan to Damon, which is the focus of season four as well. Anyways it seems like the show is losing its capturing and engaging element with viewers (season four and five anyways), season four felt a little forced with the plot twists that are common to the earlier episodes. I can't believe that they killed Alaric, probably because of his own show. I feel like the show is declining, it's on its fifth season (on tv) yet I feel that the show is losing its touch, in writing and plot. If you enjoy the show or want to give this DVD as a gift to someone who does definitely go for it, however wait until the cost is under twenty dollars if your not an regular fan.",1389916800,3,1130,4.512195121951219

4501387,5,B004YM6JLO,I am still watching the series. It just seems like the 3rd season was when I still really like the show. But the big reason I purchased on dvd set is sometimes there are too many commercials and not all is shown.,1386979200,,212,4.071428571428571

4501391,4,B004YM6JLO,This is my guilty pleasure. I really like this show. It has pretty actors and nice settings and nice wardrobe. The stories can be so convoluted but that is part of the fun. I do not think this show should be watched by young teens as it does show sex between minors. Older teens should be aware of your opinion about this before watching.,1385683200,,338,4.296875
4501402,5,B004YM6JLO,was not able to catch a lot of the season so I decided to get this to catch up and follow the series.  One of the best series out there and keeps one wanting more with the love triangle.,1384819200,,186,3.769230769230769

4501404,5,B004YM6JLO,"Before I begin I can't specify enough to leave your Twilight expectations at the door because this is far more graphic and plot specific. I really like Twilight but TVD blows it out of the water even surpassing the TVD books. This season is no different and in my small opinion the best yet. Each episode from Season 1 until now constantly surprises leaving you wondering what is next and the finale this season is no exception. I have the set simply because of the added extras it includes. Bonus scenes, commentary and oh the gag reels! If you our a fan its definitely worth having, if you never seen its definitely worth seeing from the beginning..you will be slightly lost if you don't but will quickly catch up. My best advice is if you think you might like it try it. I really don't think you will be disappointed.",1383696000,,820,4.473333333333334

4501411,2,B004YM6JLO,"I liked the first 2 seasons of The Vampire Diaries, but this season has completely ""jumped the shark"", ""gone off the rails"" or whatever phrase you want to use for this incredibly LAME season. The whole ""Doppelganger"" thing with Elena is beyond silly, but the dumbest plotline by far has to do with Alaric. Just HOW many times is this man going to die? His sudden Jekyll/Hyde alter ego is ridiculous when there was no build-up to it at all. Besides that, there are so many other minor plotlines going on with each character that the show totally loses it's cohesiveness and tension. It's very hard as a viewer to stay invested and interested in the characters when you can barely keep track of who is a vampire, werewolf, or hybrid THIS time, since so many people are being changed into supernatural beings. Take the character of Tyler, who started out as a normal 17-year-old boy, but THEN becomes a werewolf, and THEN becomes a werewolf/vampire hybrid....seriously? Clearly the writers just gave up early on in the season! I'm surprised they didn't whip up a plot with a time-machine...it wouldn't be any stupider than the rest of the plotlines in this season. Somebody needs to tell the writers that an excessively convoluted plotline does not make a show more exciting, - it only makes that show more annoying. The key to good writing is this maxim: ""A simple story, told well"". The writers need to go back to focusing on the love triangle between Damon, Elena and Stefan without all of this other garbage thrown in. Happily, Season 4 gets the show back on track.",1381536000,,1566,4.698181818181818
4501422,5,B004YM6JLO,"I have been watching this show since the Pilot episode back in September 2009. I have to admit, nerdishly, that I have NOT missed a single episode in the last four (4), well, now beginning, five (5), years. Every summer, I wait eagerly, (and shamelessly,) for September/October to arrive, making my own imaginative scenarios for the new season... I freely admit that I am a Vampire Diaries junkie. I love ""True Blood"" and ""Twilight"" (the books MUCH MORE than the movies,) but The Vampire Diaries is not even in the same league, to me. In between seasons, I've kept myself busy reading and re-reading L.J. Smith's ""The Vampire Dairies"" books; ""Shadow Souls"" is by far my favorite, and I've lost count the number of times that I've re-read it; although I am also a fan of the TVD inspired books ""Stefan's Diaries"" series. I love how I get to indulge in reading about my favorite characters whilst I become enthralled at the completely different storyline. Of course, for those of us who HAVE read all the original four (4) books,(""The Awakening"", ""The Struggle"", ""The Fury"", and ""Dark Reunion""), as well as the resurrected and re-vamped (pun intended) books that L.J. Smith has so graciously written for us die-hard fans: *THE RETURN* :: ""Nightfall"", ""Shadow Souls"", ""Midnight""; then *THE HUNTERS* :: ""Phantom"", ""Moonsong"", ""Destiny Rising""... And the ""novellas"", of sorts, loosely based on the Vampire Diaries TV show on the CW: *Stefan's Diaries* ~ ""Originis"", ""Bloodlust"", ""The Craving"", ""The Ripper"", ""The Asylum"", ""The Compelled"" ~ the latter books written in collaboration by L.J. Smith, Kevin Williamson, and Julie Plec....

********SPOILER ALERT FOR SHOW AND BOOKS************
The books that have been written DURING the previous seasons just add to the love of TVD!!! Those of us who have read all the books can easily catch the subtle nuances of their influence throughout the entire series.... (HELLO!!! Klaus! Elena becoming a vampire, being sired to Damon, Alaric and Meredith... -I still don't get WHY they cut Meredith's character from the book when she was MUCH more prevalent than Caroline - even tho I love the show's Caroline!! - a brief nod to Mrs. Flowers in season 2, Damon's crow and mist in the first few episodes, ""Fell's Church"" as the church the vamps were entombed underneath, and even the appearance of the tomb under the church matches the description from ""The Fury""... Of course, those are only a few similarities.... And there are way too many differences to even begin to get into; most importantly, Elena's not blond with blue eyes, the Salvatore brothers ARE NOT 500 years old and from Italy, the town is Mystic Falls, not Fell's Church, Klaus did NOT turn Katherine, who is from Germany in the book, however, on the show, Katerina Petrova (Katherine's TRUE name), was from Bulgaria. A vampire named Rose was tricked by Katerina into making her a vampire to save her from being sacrificed by Klaus as the doppelgnger to release a curse placed upon him to suppress Klaus's werewolf genes, and when broken, he became a true vampire-werewolf hybrid - and truly immortal; Nor is Klaus thousands of years old, psychic, and, at times, ghostly. None of the vampires can shape-shift into animals....or fly... Sage is a 900-year-old FEMALE VAMPIRE and not a huge, muscular, ""Frank"" or ancient Frenchman/Old One (Original) MALE VAMPIRE, Aunt Judith is now a 20-something Aunt Jenna. Elena's parents had JUST died less than 6 months ago in the TVD show, whereas, in the book, they had passed a few years earlier. In the books, Elena was, well... A snobby bitch. Not so on TVD. And I think one of the biggest changes: Elena's younger sibling is no longer a 5 or 6 year old, Margeret.... Now Elena has a 15 year old broth - Jeremy.  ****SPOILER ABOVE FOR BOOKS AND SHOW****",1381449600,,3794,4.898911353032659

4501501,3,B004YM6JLO,I enjoy vampire type movies..and the first two seasons were very good....but after the second season I think the authors have lost  ideas  for the series..too many characters  and and flashbacks....I  will not buy any more series..when vampire stories begin to mix in werewolves and many other fantasy characters..watch out..,1371081600,,325,5.44
4501512,1,B004YM6JLO,"When I started watching this series I thought it was much better than Twilight, but as the series goes on it becomes increasingly more and more stupid. At this point (18th episode of season three)I finally couldn't stand it anymore and Twilight suddenly looks pretty good! I think Scooby Doo episodes look smarter and even more entertaining. I can't understand the high ratings, maybe it is that this show is not for me. Damon and (surprisingly) Caroline are the more likeable of the bunch (actually Damon is pretty cool). Elena, who is the main character is annoying to death, and I thought that Bella was bad enough. And let's not start with Klaus (bad clown). I get it that this is fiction but even fiction has boundaries with reality in order to make feel the story ""real"". It looks like Roadrunner and Coyote Cartoon, they try to kill Klaus and never can. And the writers justify it now with the absurdity (even for fiction) that the bloodline will die with the original vampire turner. Voila! And they didn't move on, they stayed with the same plot since the last part of the 2nd to the 3rd season!. Don't they have more ideas? If they don't, well, hire new writers! I've seen a couple of season four episodes and it gets even worse!!! I won't waste time and money in this anymore. They should change the name to ""The adventures of Klaus, the supervampire"". If you are a fan of vampire stories stay with True blood or the old stuff where vampires are monsters of the night. In fairness the first season was good. The second so so. I wouldn't recommend the third season, but (like I did) find about it yourself. You'll be disappointed (like I am). What a way to waste a former good show!",1370995200,,1692,4.532679738562091

4501515,3,B004YM6JLO,"When I found this series I was thrilled. I had followed True Blood until half way through the forth season when I said enough is enough. I watched Twilight up until the last movie when it just got bizarre. I was hoping this series would be different than the others--more captivating with less gratuitous sex and teenage drama. And it was in the first two seasons. It was by far the best vampire series I had seen. But then by the third season it began to get old and weird.

The plot was advancing and then digressing as it traveled in circles to the point that I said enough already. Elana and Stephan are following the same path as Sookie and Bill in True Blood. They love each other so much that one cannot live with out the other, and then they are cool. She finds herself attracted to his vampire brother, and then she's back hot for Stephan, but he doesn't want her. Oh wait, yes he does, but she is not sure about him. Klaus is evil and then he isn't. We have to kill the originals, and then when we have them, we let them go because we can't kill them without hurting our friends. There was so much back and forth with all of this that my brain got whiplash watching it. If the fourth season follows down this path, then just like True Blood and Twilight, I'm done.",1370649600,2,1274,4.242798353909465

4501650,5,B004YM6JLO,"TVD is one of my all time favorite shows. I literally do not have enough wonderful praises for the story and cast. Every episode leaves me breathless, wanting more. These episodes NEVER disappoint. I was actually discussing this with a friend and we noted how some tv shows that you love will still, from time to time, have disappointing episodes. Maybe it was boring, nothing really happened.. etc. NOT TVD! Literally every episode turns into a new twist. The acting is incredible and unexpected. And the music weaved throughout always makes for emotional scenes. LOVE.",1360886400,,570,5.010526315789473

4501658,5,B004YM6JLO,Quite possibly the best season of Vampire Diaries so far.  The story arches this season were awesome.  The brothers are hot.  The originals are evil.,1360627200,,149,4.88

4501660,5,B004YM6JLO,"I love this season things are getting more and more complicated. And i bought the 1912 episode because of Damon's terrible humor. "" A chipmuck asked me my name today, I told him it was joe, that lie.. will haunt me.. forever."" haha",1360454400,,231,4.395348837209302

4501664,3,B004YM6JLO,"Are the writers getting tired of this script?  It definietly shows!  This season was cut off too quickly and leaves the viewer with a lot of unfinished, loose ends.  Not as eventful as other seasons.  Probably because they turned Elena into a vampire and there isn't much of a story line to hang on to humanity.",1360022400,,311,4.5
4501665,5,B004YM6JLO,"I know that it's sad that I'm almost 23 and I'm still watching teen vamp shows, but I can't help myself - this show is just too juicy! Not to mention, uhhh, Mr. Somerhalder!

4501667,5,B004YM6JLO,I have been watching Vampire Diaries for years now. I have to say coming from the 1st season to the 3rd and now the 4th its a huge difference! The show has such a good story pulling you in while every episode you watch is a good episode. The 3rd season takes this to a whole new level and will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. I recommend this show to anyone who likes a compelling story with great action  and emotional engagement. This show can pull in just about anybody.,1359763200,,497,4.123711340206185

4501690,2,B004YM6JLO,"This show was great at pulling in an audience, but it felt so glum by the time it got very far into the third season. I think it kind of peaked too early and then it just felt like it was trying too hard to maintain intensity after that. I will compliment their creativity in the little twists to the story. If this story was not so deeply morbid and depressing, the twists and turns might keep my attention. Plus, it felt like they just kept trying to add more sexual stuff to make it more dramatic or something. It just ended up making the whole thing whorish and lame. Someone bring back ""Pushing Daisies"".",1358553600,3,609,4.304347826086956

Yes, vampires and werewolves roam free but the writing is amazing and the whole production is simply amazing. I love every moment that I watch and I laugh, cry and morn with each character. Damon is my favorite as he is for many because of his wit and charm but also because he is seriously hot. But I love Damon for every reason and I couldn't imagin the show without him. So thank you to the writers, actors and whoever else supports the show and helps to make it great! Can't wait for more seasons to come!",1358035200,,602,4.243478260869566

4501706,5,B004YM6JLO,"Very entertaining show. As a dude...I don't care for all of the lovey dovey stuff. But the vampire scenes are fantastic and the plot is extremely well done.

This show is a more mild version of True Blood. Not nearly as much sex/violence/cursing as its HBO cousin. I am a little old school, so I like that there aren't boobs in every scene. This show is just as good (if not better) than True Blood simply because the show doesn't have to flaunt sex in every scene just to keep people interested. Plus the Vampire Diaries doesn't have fairies. Which is always a plus in my mind.

Highly recommend.",1357776000,2,597,4.467889908256881

I was shocked that this is actually good, assuming you can get best the teen soap opera and barrage of emo music.  It's almost the exact story of Twilight, even season 2 (just like the second twilight) introduces werewolves.  Boone (Lost reference) is easily the best character and carries the show.  Each season is better than the last.  My favorite episode from this season is Homecoming, it has a great ending.",1357689600,,502,4.659090909090909

Granted, it can get a bit cliched and frustrating at times, but it keeps my attention and drags me in every week there's a new episode.

Its not as teeny boppy and annoying as Twilight (which I still love) but doesn't have the sex and gore of TruBlood (which I have only see 4 episodes of, so I'm not sure I can really accurately compare the two).

4501776,3,B004YM6JLO,"Let me count the ways -- or, on second thought, maybe not.  My Google search for ""vampires in movies and books"" yielded 15 million entries.  Suffice it to say that these creatures are lodged deeply in our collective unconscious.  The ""Twilight"" movies alone have so far grossed an astonishing 3 billion dollars worldwide.  Television's Vampire Diaries has gone on to Season 4, and True Blood to Season 6.  What can account for the extraordinary appeal that these stories seem to have for countless hordes of teenage girls?  I am not part of that demographic, but will nonetheless try to evaluate these three shows.  If I should by chance tread on your favorite, please don't take offense.

Vampire Diaries has many flaws, but none of them are quite fatal.  The most glaring of these flaws is this:  The producers seem to have scoured Hollywood to find every available pretty boy with six-pack abs (a specialty of this network), but, alas, most of them are at best unconvincing actors.  The good news, however, is this show's endearing fidelity to the basic High School Vampire mythology.  Also, these scripts are much better written than the clunky twaddle that passes for dialogue in the Twilight films.  Of course, as all true genre fans know, the boy vampire will try heroically to deny his evil nature in order to win his girl's love.  This struggle never ends, but will always be continued next week, and always include a touching final scene accompanied by a sweet pop song.  I may sound a bit cynical here, but, in fact, these moments usually bring a tear to my eye.

Possibly the most surprising and curious thing about this show may be its bizarre chastity.  Having hired all those comely actors, the producers never let us see them naked, even when having sex.  This is in contrast to True Blood, which tends to take nudity and sex to campy excess.  So what is it about Vampire Diaries that makes it work?  Here's one suggestion:  The photography and direction are very fine and every shot is beautifully illuminated against dark shadows like a Vermeer painting.  (True Blood, by contrast, tends to look quite gaudy).  This subtlety of design and lighting suits these ancient creatures.

Finally, there is actor Ian Sommerhalder, who plays the bad brother Damon (or is he the good brother?).  While his mugging, smirking, and waggling eyebrows should certainly be dialed back a bit, he completely steals every scene he is in.  Perhaps he is the series' secret weapon.

 In sum, then, the classic simplicity of Vampire Diaries easily beats the overwrought extravagance of True Blood and the lame dialogue of the Twilight series, and earns my vote as the best of the genre.  I will be back for the next season.",1354233600,,2718,4.797413793103448

4501867,2,B004YM6JLO,"I've been a fan of the Vampire Diaries since season 1 first aired, however, this season was just awful and sorely lacking. Storylines were picked up and dropped all too quickly without properly being explored all season. Moreover, it was was the same stuff, just another season. It was always another party, Elena still not being able to chose which brother she wants, Caroline in yet another love triangle, Tyler leaving town again, Damon throwing yet another temper tantrum because he doesn't get his way, Bonnie constantly getting screwed over even though she's the only character that ever does the right thing, etc.

And, even after having three whole seasons, there are still quite a few characters that remain underdeveloped (Tyler, Matt, Jeremy, and Bonnie). The worst lack of character development lies with Bonnie's character. Being a witch, she's very important to the plot, yet the writers manage to put her and her development on the back burner every single time! It's quite baffling.

The character of Klaus was originally introduced to be the most ruthless, inhumane vampire ever, yet this season we saw him drawing ponies and crying about how his family doesn't love him.

Overall, while this season had quite a bit of potential at its start, it was just lacking too much. Maybe season 4 will be better, but I think season 3 had pretty much closed this show for me.",1349568000,5,1382,4.897435897435898

I've read the books, watched the tv series and the followup books by Stephan's diaries. They are similar but all three are different and that is what makes this series a must have.

The only thing that would make it better is hmmmm nothing. :)

4501894,5,B004YM6JLO,"If you love vampires (or witches, werewolves, hybrids, and ghosts) and YA-type romances, you will love Vampire Diaries! Season 3 had me gasping and cringing and ooing and awwing at every single turn. The love triangle in this show is epic, and so much more realistic than in other shows and books.

Elena clearly has feelings for both the Salvatore brothers and is constantly torn between the love she has for Stefan, and the feelings that she has for his bad boy, older brother, Damon. I love that this is a REAL love triangle, unlike the triangle in Twilight which I thought was strange because clearly Bella never wavered from Edward and so it was more like Bella and Edward, with Jacob hanging around on the outside. This is not like that. This is a real triangle with real tangles and implications because she has real feelings for both of them.

My only complaint was probably how the season ended. My jaw hit the ground (so kudos for that) but I couldn't help but feel worried about what's next, especially since...***SPOILER ALERT***...Elena is now a vampire!! Frankly, I was shocked, and concerned about what direction the show is going in because 90% of the previous plots had to do with keeping fragile, human Elena out of harms way, or keeping the original, Klaus, away from her human doppelganger blood. Obviously, all of those plots are going to get flushed down the toilet now so where will that leave us? Also, we already saw the 3-vampire triangle with Damon, Stefan and Catharine, and personally, it didn't do anything for me. I just hope it's not going to be like that or we might be in trouble.

Either way, I loved this season and am waiting on pins for the season 4 premiere!",1349049600,,1697,4.631229235880399
4501895,5,B004YM6JLO,"I was bored on netflix one day and always saw vampire diaries on there and thought hell no, the only show i love right now is sons of anarchy and twilight was enough of the ""vampire craze"" for me but my curiosity got the best of me and I'm thankful it did.  I was interested as I started watching season 1 and then I couldn't stop, in less than 2 weeks I got through all 3 seasons of Vampire Diaries.  Wonderful show, amazing story lines, twists, action and thrills, its mysterious, simplistic, but so much to take in.  Amazing acting and so many characters to fall in love with.  I was waiting for this show to get cheesy but it hasn't even come close. Season 3 was amazingly powerful, be careful with episode 7 though, I never even tear up during emotional moments watching tv and I was bawling at the end of that episode, it snuck up on me. I can't imagine anyone who watched that episode not have dry eyes at the end, such a moving episode. Can't wait for season 4!",1348963200,,969,4.25
4501896,3,B004YM6JLO,"I thought the first two seasons were great.  I'm not that crazy about the third.  Would probaly rate it five stars if not for the fact that there is more gore which to me isn't necessary, the ""love scenes"" are nothing but couples jamming themselves up against walls with heavy breathing (sounds like they're in labor) and mashing their faces together.  Someone yodeling a song every five minutes is distracting and annoying.  Plus always the same scenario - a school or town party where someone gets maimed or killed, (then comes back to life with a big gasp) slammed up against something - same-o, same-o.  Think the writers are running out of ideas.  Will be very surprised if it goes to a fifth season.",1348963200,4,705,4.645161290322581
4501897,3,B004YM6JLO,"First of all, I gotta say that I feel terrible for giving such an amazing show 3 stars but hopefully anyone looking at the 3rd season of the show is quite familiar and possible own the first 2 seasons already, and you know the quality of the show and are really hooked to it.
Just before I get to the not so good part, I would like to say that The Vampire Diaries is pure entertainment, if there is one network show that can put cable shows to shame is this, writers know how to keep a 22 episode season really compelling; there are almost no fillers and there is always something happening. To manage to do this for the third year in a row, is just AMAZING!

With that said, now to the part why I gave this a 3 star review. In simple words this package is awful. First, why on earth did WB studios thought that giving a tv show a DVD-Blu ray combo pack edition was a good idea? I get it for movies coz you can squeeze the DVD version along with the digital copy or some extras not in HD, plus a movie is usually a 1 to 3 disc edition. But, for a tv show is a whole different story! 9 discs on that package is just too much, the pin that holds the disc trays seems to be at its limit with 9 discs.

Then there's the fact that it doesn't make any sense, there are no new extras on the DVD versions to justify packaging them with the blu ray discs. And, think about this, if you own a blu ray player is because you have an HD tv and you want to make the most of it; then you start purchasing your movies/shows on blu ray whenever you want to watch them on HD quality; based on that, why a customer interested on the blu-ray version would ever feel the need for the DVD version? why would they feel torn between each of those editions? On the other hand, if you do not own a blu-ray player and you want the DVD edition, why would you feel the need for the blu-ray? and if you do have a blu-ray player but for whatever reason you want the DVDs, again why would you need the blu-ray discs? To me, it just doesn't make any sense! They should have the usual DVD only edition, and a Blu-ray only one; let the consumer decide which one they want coz I really doubt anyone would want to watch episode 1 on a blu-ray and episode 2 on the DVD. On the aesthetic side, this set also looks weird next to the slimmer blu-ray only editions for the first 2 seasons.

As a fan of the show I purchased it to support it and show the studio they can make a profit out of it so hopefully we will get many more seasons of this awesome show, but I gotta say, I am extremely unsatisfied with the packaging for this edition and if I could boycott it without also hurting the show, I would.",1348963200,5,2662,4.0283553875236295

4501976,5,B004YM6JLO,"I have already seen the entire Season 3 which was fantastic so I can hardly wait for the Blu Ray release!

My only comment is that I noticed that Season 3 will only be available on Ultraviolet.  No Digital Copy!!  Sorry, I really don't like Ultraviolet.  I like the fact that a Digital Copy that works with iTunes will show up as a purchased item on your iTunes account and would allow you access forever.  Furthermore, iTunes also allows me to stream via my Apple TV to my big screen.  It all works quite easily.

With Ultraviolet, it seems like every studio does something different.  Some movies you can't even download.  Some movies from Sony and the like make you download a multitude of files, like 10 to 20 files for one movie, that aren't recognizable by anything but some Sony player which also has to be downloaded.  I think Flixster does the same thing as I recall.

Apple and iTunes/Digital Copy had it all worked out making Digital Copy a wonderful experience and then some of the other movie companies had to deploy these iTunes wannabe's which really kinda suck!

Vudu may work great, haven't tried it yet.  Amazon may work great, haven't tried it.  But I have tried Ultraviolet, Sony and Flixster and they stink!  At least offer an iTunes Digital Copy along with Ultraviolet so we can make a choice!

Update 9.18.12:  I recently discovered that some, and I stress only some, movies that are on my Ultraviolet account do tie in to my Vudu account.  I forgot I had a Vudu account since I have never used it.  To use my Vudu account I have to buy another compatible streaming device such as a TV, Blu-Ray, or use a video game system, which for some reason, I just have never got into even though I have both the XBox360 and a PS3.  Maybe I will check out the XBox360 option.  I would probably rather use Roku box but Vudu is not supported on Roku!  I throw my request in with countless others for Roku to sign up with Vudu/Walmart to stream their movies!!",1347321600,2,1968,4.453781512605042

4502022,5,B004YM6JLO,"I thought it would be stupid. I knew had to be stupid. But i pressed record on my DVR anyways because I liked the Twilight movies and loved the Twilight books. I've never looked back since. The Vampire Diaries is SO much better than Twilight by a LONG SHOT. Since the 10th episode of the first season I have always watched it, and around my house everyone knows I get livid if they skip it on the DVR. There is no doubt that I won't watch this series till the very end. I have already pre-ordered this on eBay for $18.99 Normally I always wait to have others get pricey items for me but with all seasons of Vampire Diaries I've bought them myself. I cannot wait till season 4, especially after what happened on the last episode although I won't say what happens, someone may get angry.

4502047,2,B004YM6JLO,It takes a long time for the video to load and then once it does the video quality is not good. I would have bought hd but that video never loaded. Netflix and hulu have you download video playing software when you sign up with them to help you watch things. Maybe that is an idea you could think about. My videos on those site load fine typically and have a great picture while watching.

A lot of people either like this or True Blood. I love them both. I don't compare them at all. They are both great shows, but they are very different.

4502251,5,B004YM6JLO,"This episode is definetly my favorite of this season(maybe of the whole show). It's my fav because in this episode we get to see a different more sweet and caring side of Klaus, and it's always cute to see the bad guy show some love. And I love the music they picked for this episode(Give Me Love-Ed Sheeran) but TVD always has great music for their episodes, it always fits so perfectly",1342310400,,387,4.388888888888889

The story of how they became vampires is very clear,easy to understand and it all makes sense, whoever the writer is, did an excellent job. If vampires were real the story they made up for this episode seems like a great fit. Most vampire movies/shows never explain where vampires came from...but really good episode",1342310400,,484,4.987654320987654
4502283,5,B004YM6JLO,"I loved this episode because we got to see The Originals (esp Klaus) before they were vampires, giving us a peek into their world when they were living in Mystic Falls before it even came to be. I love season 3 because the show not only brought in new characters, but took us on a new journey as far as the story line went. I have a feeling this is just a tip of the iceberg as far as what we know about the Originals. They've been alive for so long I'd love to see them with their own spin-off. They have so many more stories to tell.",1342224000,,535,3.962962962962963

She brings everything to the show, Nina Dobrev is such a good actress playing Elena and Katherine. I can't wait for season 4 watching for her turn into a vampire is going to be so different and amazing! This show always keeps you interested, new things are always happening. The creators do such an amazing job at reeling you into the show. I am so addicted to this show. I first watched it on netflix, I was such a twilight fan I said this show is going to be a stupid copy of twilight and I don't think I am going to like it, but I was bored so I just clicked on to it, I was hooked from the first minute! It is nothing like Twilight! It is wayyy better, twilight doesn't even come close to The Vampire Diaries. The chemistry between the characters feels so real! That's what I love about this show!

4502362,5,B004YM6JLO,"I was only somewhat shocked about the turn of events in this episode; I felt it was just a matter of time before certain events occurred (so as not to be too much of a spoiler, I will just say that this is in regard to what happens with Alaric and Elena). Some issues were wrapped up, but we are left with enough cliffhangers to keep us on edge until the show returns in the fall. There were plenty of the twists that keeps fans of the show hooked! All in all, a very exciting season finale for one of the most addictive shows on TV. If a fan of this show, this episode is a must!
Just to comment on Vampire Dairies in general and the Twilight comparisons: I gave this show a shot when I was bored with my usual TV fare and wanted something different, waiting to sneer at the ""cheap Twilight knock-off."" But to my surprise, Vampire Dairies is SO MUCH BETTER (and I am a fan of Twilight!). This show is everything Twilight wants to be. The acting is better, the stories more engaging, there are no neat little happy endings, and, for the characters, the lines between good and evil are much more blurred, which, in my opinion, provides for greater dramatic impact. Don't be put off by the demographic this show is aimed at (I am WAY over that line!)- its just a well-made show that deserves greater recognition.",1336780800,18,1310,4.329268292682927
4502383,5,B004YM6JLO,"While it's undeniable that The Vampire Diaries is targeted at the teen to 20s crowd, it has appeal for other ages. The gore and violence is kept relevant rather than over the top - and I challenge anyone who doesn't normally buy into the supernatural genre to give this show a chance.

While the constant drama surrounding Elena does, at times, get as boring and annoying as the similar infatuation with Lana on Smallville, the show delivers powerful story lines, interesting twists and excellent performances from the majority of the cast. You become drawn into the story and the acting is so good that, for the most part, you completely forget that you're watching a show.

Memorable, delicious, with a depth of emotion that drives the main characters to do what's necessary, unthinkable, unavoidable. A great show!",1336780800,6,817,4.956204379562044
4502384,5,B004YM6JLO,"I own the first two seasons and I plan on buying the third season soon after it comes out.  The story is painful to watch from week to week or to find things to pass the time during hiatuses, but the series is worth it.  This series has romance, heart-break, adventure, joy, history, and of course, the paranormal.  If you don't like urban-fantasy (fantasy set in present day) you probably won't like this show.

If you enjoyed Twilight, you will like this show.  If you hated Twilight (like me) you might still enjoy this show.  I love Anne Rice and these vampires are more Anne Rice than they are Stephanie Meyer.

There is a lot of character development in this season, and it doesn't go unnoticed by the audience.  You will find yourself empathizing with would be enemies and crying over lost love (both romantic and platonic).

The series does seem to get boring in the middle, but it quickly picks back up and ends an intense edge-of-your-seat finale.  And, yes, in case you were worried the show would be left with a cliff-hanger full of questions, it does.  But, don't let that turn you away.  The series has been renewed a 4th season.

It will be good to invest in the DVDs because you will want to watch some episodes over and over.

Bonus Features:

I own the other DVDs and I adore the bonus content.  The interviews and commentary are great, but I found myself wishing more episodes had commentary.",1336694400,,1411,4.5396825396825395

While I enjoy The Twilight Saga and that story line, The Vampire Diaries is far more intense with the storyline, the relationships, the action... plus, in addition to vampires and werewolves, you have a 3rd element with witches.

While some say the writing faltered a bit in the middle of the season (there are still three more new episodes to come as of this writing), taken as a whole the series is thrilling.  TVD fits between ""Twilight"" and ""True Blood"".  To me, ""Twilight"" is bloodless (pardon the pun!) and True Blood is good but R rated.  If you haven't seen TVD, buy the third season, but buy seasons 1 and 2 also so you can catch up.  You will be so caught up in the absorbing story lines, the wonderful characters, the danger, the sexiness (but no complete nudity or graphic sex for those of you who need to know that), and the beautiful people who are also good actors, that you will be hooked!",1334966400,,828,4.282051282051282

Just when you think you have figured out what is going to happen next, the show sends you a curveball that comes completely out of left field and makes you remember why you decided to watch these realistic and fantastical vampires rather than the much-glamorized Twilight versions.

I would love to be able to watch the episodes but cannot do so because I am stationed overseas. I too feel as if this unfair due to the fact that I am a US citizen and have a US address. This makes no sense to  me especially since Itunes allows the episodes to be downloaded. I can understand there would be issues if the product was free such as with Hulu etc but if I am willing to pay for them why not. Also now what am I supposed to do with my instant download credit? I can't do anything with it while overseas. I love this season but instant video on Amazon needs to have some adjustments made.,1322092800,4,764,4.155405405405405

The plots pull off more action and blood, but also a more deep look on the characters feelings. Also, the introduction of new characters (and comebacks of old ones) are part of the reason has been so good since the beginning.
Every episode is a great episode, because sometimes in a show they are some few episodes you want to forget (maybe because they're too boring, and useless for the main plot), but that's not the case with this show. Every episode is important.
I know that only half of the season aired (writing this as of November 10th, the original airing of the ""mid-season"" finale), but I could say is so far so good. I can't wait to see the another half (hopefully something more extreme). Anyway, I hope this show lasts at least five seasons, because it has a lot of strings to pull off, and that fans could enjoy easily... It's worth the pre-order.",1320883200,36,980,4.419889502762431

4502569,5,B004YM6JLO,"I absolutely love this show! I put off watching it for a long time, all the while enjoying the Twilight series, Trueblood, Ghost Whisperer, Supernatural and similar shows. I was hooked after just a few episodes. And now, even into the 3rd season, each episode continues to shock me, with (spoiler alert) the most recent surprise being that of Tyler's uncle Mason returning.

One problem I have with season 3 is when in the world is Elena and Damon going to hook up? Am I the only viewer has been waiting for this to happen for the past year now? Stefan, Elena and Damon and the 3 main characters and the show IS advertised as the ""love triangle"" being the main theme, so, how is it they can drag it out for this long and NOT give Damon and Elena a chance? I watch each episode just waiting for something to happen, and while it is always quite entertaining and I love the twists and surprises at the end of each episode, I really think they are dragging it out between Elena and Damon for too long. Also, I would LOVE to see how Stefan, now with no humanity, would react to seeing Elena with Damon? Even without his humanity, I know that a core part of him still loves Elena, compelled or not.

My absolute FAVORITE part of Season 3 is the love affair with Tyler and Caroline. Caroline's character has evolved from a snobby, whiny, shallow, princess type, into a smart, considerate, intelligent and interesting character. Tyler has also evolved into someone more fun to watch as well. I think their sex scene in episode 2 or 3, was one of the best sex scenes I have ever seen. I love the chemistry they have and I hope they stay together and it works out. Someone needs to turn Matt into something, anything, because his character is just too boring. He's been sad since the first show, first season. Geez, give the guy something to live for already! Through it all though, I love Damon. Ian Somerhalder is just breathtakingly gorgeous! If I were Elena I'd be throwing myself at him by now. How many times can a guy save your life before you at least throw him a bone?!!

The one person I really miss is Jenna. I don't know how they could bring her back, but, if they bring anyone back, I wish it would be her. She brought a certain element to the show that doesn't exist without her. The show's different with her gone. I admit they didn't give her character a whole lot to work with, but she was a great actor and I enjoyed watching her. She was quite pretty as well. I'd like to see Anna come back to life too. All the different elements involved with each character make this show superb. Any 1-2 characters in the show have so much going in in their own lives, they could almost have a show of their own. So, when you combine all of these characters, you have an extremely compelling (no pun intended) show that I just can NOT get enough of!!",1319328000,5,2847,4.357815442561205

There seemed to be a lessening of the killing in season two than the first season (a good thing I thought) with greater development of the characters, especially Caroline Forbes (played by Candice Accola). When the human Caroline was on the screen in Season One I wanted to turn off the T.V. she was so anoying, then she freaked out when changed. But now her character has bloomed into my favorite in the series, caring and fun loving she works for goodness and I totally love her! Tyler (played by Michael Tevino) became much more likable in season two, but now that Klaus has made him a hybrid it is hard to know to whom he is loyal or if he will abuse his new powers. I think the one chance he has is if Caroline can keep him from going off the deep end (he is a fool if he doesn't worship and stay with her)! Nina Dobrev is, of course, amazing...how she switches from the good Elena to the evil agenda of Katherine is a tribute to her acting abilities! Elena is showing even greater strength in season three! Elena's younger brother Jeremy Gilbert (Steven McQueen) is a real assest to the plots. IMHO his character exudes kindness yet strength and he clearly loves the young witch, Bonnie Bennet (played by Katerina Graham) who seems to always be the one to ""save the day"" with her magic. Alaric Saltzman (played by Matt Davis), gives a solid performance as the teacher and substitute father figure for the Elena and Jeremy Gilbert who tries to keep Elena and Jeremy safe while helping Elena fight for Stefan to break free of Klaus and return to her. Stefan Savatore (played by Paul Wesley) has gone from self-loathing vampire who loves Elena and who doesn't want to be the ""Ripper"" he once was, back to a Ripper under the influence (if not the total control) of the evil Klause. Stefan made a ""deal with the devil"" (Klause) in order to save his brother Damon Salvatore (Ian Somerhauder) who had been ""nipped"" by a werewolf (deadly to vampires). Now, in the third season, the plots are thickly inter-woven with new challanges and characters (as well as some supposedly dead characters) entering or re-entering the action. My wife is in LOVE with Damon, who can say more with his eyes than hundreds of spoken words...Ian Somerhaulder is amazing (and I'm glad he isn't killing everyone and everything in sight as he was in season one - it's allowed him to have more depth of character)! This is a great series and my wife and I will continue to watch season three and purchase the DVD's or Blue Ray's when the whole season is avaiable. I'm finishing my book, ""Immortal Relations"" to be available through Amazon's ""Create Space Publishing"" late December and while completely different, I hope readers find it half as good as Vampire Diaries.",1319155200,,2864,4.60665362035225
4502571,5,B004YM6JLO,"I only regret is that it is only on once a week. I think that the Vampire Diaries Series has the potential to run for many seasons to come. There is a fantastic set of characters that can travel back and forward in time to revel the secrets of the past and how they interplay with the present and the future. the historic perspectives are so interesting. Europe, Romania, Chicago .Mystic Fall, The plots and settings are endless can't get enough off it. Did I mention the love story and sexual tension between so many of the characters, not only the stars of the series Damien, Elena and Stefan. Want more could we possibly ask for than more,more,more!!!",1318723200,59,654,4.5508474576271185
