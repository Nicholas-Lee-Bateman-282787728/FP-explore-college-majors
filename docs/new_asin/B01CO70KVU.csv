7685096,5,B01CO70KVU,"First off, the subtitles are great: large, bright white, super-easy to read in every frame. So often the subtitles fade into the background and are in very small font so it's almost impossible to read them, especially if you're sitting far away from the screen. Not these - they're fantastically clear. I wish all subtitles were this well done.

Now, for the content: For a cop show, this is pretty lighthearted. Sort of the anti-Criminal Minds. Think more along the lines of Rizzoli & Isles. There are no horrific, sick serial killers and twisted psychopaths whose minds we're asked to immerse ourselves in (no thanks - not a Criminal Minds fan here). The actors are a bit hammy, and the overall feel of the show can be hokey at times, but I still really liked it. It's a good-natured show, and the plots make sense and are pretty straightforward. The relationships between the actors are lighthearted, humorous and warm.

As for Inspector Rex, the dog, he's simply adorable (although he's a big, well-muscled German Shepherd, not one of those tiny dogs celebrities carry around in their purses). If you're a dog lover, give this show a watch, because I think you'll fall in love with Rex. He has a very expressive face and an infectious enthusiasm. Clearly he's been well trained and well loved. The relationship between the lead character and Rex is wonderful, both loving and humorous.

No, this isn't Shakespeare - far from it - but it's enjoyable and fun, and I think people who love dogs will like this show. I certainly did. And I'd love to adopt Rex!",1469923200,14,1559,4.724264705882353
7685097,5,B01CO70KVU,Excellent product. I've fallen in love with the Inspector Rex Series!,1467331200,,69,5.363636363636363
7685098,5,B01CO70KVU,"The actors in the first season could not have been better chosen for their roles!  ""Moser""  is in reality a dog lover, based on mannerisms with Rex, and authentic portraying a new dog owner. The humor can be subtle but the interactions between the colleagues is hilarious! Rex is a super actor as well, and remarkable with his training. Unique and creative storyline! Some crimes are too creepy as realistically depicted. The locations in Vienna - apparently not sets or a studio lot - are stunning. Names and clothing are realistically traditional; even Tyrolean coats; that an Austrian or even Viennese accent can be heard is awesome! With such a spot-on blend, it's too bad the original cast could not have remained for a few seasons. That I bought a DVD after seeing the episodes just once before is a testament to it's enormous appeal - even 20 years later! I now have friends watching the English caption versions and enjoying them far more than anything on TV in the U.S. Please release the second year in English subtitles soon!!!",1465776000,8,1038,4.761111111111111

7685104,3,B01CO70KVU,"This is a great show, but I wish that some of the more sexual scenes were omitted.  Because of the unexpected sexual scenes, I give this a 3 star, if this show did not include that, then I would give it a 5-star rating, for sure!",1486166400,,229,3.9782608695652173
7685105,5,B01CO70KVU,"saw this offered on mhz, and purchased on amazon.  the scripts are very simple written as a vehicle for a dog.  if you love light mysteries, seeing other countries in the comfort of your home and love dogs you will enjoy this. every detective/police person should have an inspector rex on his team.  the dog is a well trained actor/performer and shares the weight of making this a successful series.",1483401600,,399,4.671428571428572
7685106,1,B01CO70KVU,"Actually, I don't hate Inspector Rex, I love it, but I hate that Amazon has moved it behind the Mhz premium wall. I have been watching the series free as part of my Prime subscription and suddenly it is no longer available. To finish the series I'd have to subscribe to Mhz. That stinks!",1479945600,5,287,4.333333333333333
7685107,5,B01CO70KVU,"Love this show. Have seen season 1 and am breathlessly awaiting season 2 and every one after that. Rex is an incredible Actor. He is beautifully trained and I already can pick up by his facial expressions just what little trick he's going to pull next. It's a fun show and I love the other characters
as well. I also fell in love with his puppy show, he's is just so interesting and fun to watch, and I've had an intense fear of this breed since a child encounter with an angry one, but have quite altered my feelings since watching this show.  Thanks for having this show to purchase.",1479686400,,585,4.318181818181818
7685108,5,B01CO70KVU,"Rex is the best.  Detective show that's light but  has endearing characters especially the German Sheppard Rex.  I love watching this show. Please, please Amazon give us more seasons of Rex to view on Amazon prime.  The DVD are not for region 1 so please stream more seasons of Inspector Rex.  I can see why this show has had such a long run. We need more Rex.",1479168000,2,360,4.313432835820896
7685109,5,B01CO70KVU,"Best bad TV show EVER, highly recommended for German Shepherd lovers around the world.  I used to watch this in Switzerland where it would be dubbed in Italian, French, or left in the original German.  It didn't matter what language it was in, it is that great.  Still, was happy to get a copy in my native English to enjoy whenever the feeling strikes...",1478476800,,355,4.515625
7685110,3,B01CO70KVU,Cute idea but needs more dog and less Cops who do stupid things. I've seen two and probably won't watch more unless I'm really bored.,1478390400,,133,4.36
7685111,5,B01CO70KVU,"Such a treat for dog-lovers (Kommisar Rex is truly a winner!) and for German-speakers who want to keep their Wienerdialekt in shape!  Loved it when it aired on Austrian television and am loving the Season 1 on Amazon Video, certain that one season will  NOT be enough!",1476835200,2,268,4.680851063829787
7685112,5,B01CO70KVU,"I love this show. I saw it dubbed when I was living in Italy and followed it for years. The first season was possibly the best, but I enjoyed all of them. I wish we could get the whole series and I'm glad that it's reached the American audience here on Amazon. Will be watching it again this week - great job Amazon! Encore!",1476662400,,324,4.078125
7685113,5,B01CO70KVU,"Endearing characters, great glimpses of Vienna, standard and therefore satisfying police procedure, and truly bad criminals attracted me to this show. It's been a long time since Turner and Hooch, but kind of like that. Except, Rex is very well behaved. Yes, fictional, perhaps a tad dated, but the stories are interesting mysteries and the outcomes are satisfying. I enjoy seeing different parts of Vienna, and listening to the Austrian language. The subtitles are very adequate so I can follow the dialog well.

I subscribed to Amazon Prime because they host tv shows that are either never on standard tv,  or are too old. I don't know how the plug got pulled on gory television rules, but I don't care to look at it. I appreciate the lighter glimpses of this show. If you liked ""Midsomer Murders"" or ""Mr and Mrs Murder"" you might like this show, too. I do.",1473638400,3,859,4.72
7685114,3,B01CO70KVU,Second episode of disc one is bad:first 5 minutes to the end...video not clear& no audio. Thanks .David,1473033600,,103,4.777777777777778

7685116,5,B01CO70KVU,A very enjoyable series!  I love listening to it in German and reading along in English. I only wish the whole series were available in a US DVD-zone boxed set of DVDs!  Also that Amazon Video offered the whole series as well.,1471910400,4,226,4.357142857142857
7685117,5,B01CO70KVU,"I started watching this on amazon's prime video - I have only seen the first few episodes but it is very entertaining. And if you like dogs (or ever liked Lassie), you'll love Rex.  Very glad I stumbled upon this on amazon video.",1470787200,2,229,4.325581395348837
7685118,5,B01CO70KVU,"Filmed in Vienna and spoken in Viennese Standard German, the series might be a little kitschy were it English language; however, the Viennese settings, the German, and above all, Rex, contribute to this entertaining series.  Although it was filmed in the 90s, the video and sound quality are excellent.  Some aspects of some episodes contain adult-only themes and scenes, so if viewers are younger than teens, parents might want to monitor the viewing.  Otherwise, the episodes tend to move along, and the characters are fleshed out.  Rex, of course, is the reason young viewers would enjoy the series.  I appreciated the training that went into the dogs who played Rex, but, for me, the Viennese setting and the Viennese German were the main attractions.  I might mention that the last episode is a prequel to the other episodes.  In it Rex is introduced as a puppy, and some of his habits and practices as an adult are explained.  Amazon, please keep giving us foreign-language films.",1470614400,9,986,4.933333333333334

8753496,5,B01CO70KVU,"Absolutely first class TV series, clean and clear picture quality, excellent subtitles, and a magnificent dog. You don't have to be a dog lover or owner to either laugh yourself silly or furtively sniffle into your Kleenex. Rex will capture your heart in two shakes of the tail. His human fellow actors aren't bad, either. You'll love it and wish there were more. [And end up buying the whole series from Australia, as I did. And this, after already having purchased the series in German. But----- as I have a husband who does not speak German, we needed subtitles.] We are currently at our third viewing of the whole works and enjoying every minute of it.",1530230400,,656,4.663793103448276
8753497,5,B01CO70KVU,"First saw Rex while visiting my sister during spring 2018 in Europe ...  upon my return to US, I was so happy to be find on internet a video I could order with some REX episodes in US format.  It's a heart-warming TV series of how a german shephard police dog REX saves so many lives.  I don't think of myself as a dog-lover, but REX is so endearing & such a hero ...  I hope more REX episodes will become available in US video format.  He's a modern-day Rin-Tin-Tin.  And the humans are also great!  Go REX!",1527033600,,508,4.122448979591836

8753499,5,B01CO70KVU,"Such a great show.  The characters are fun to watch.  What I especially like is that everyone seems to agree about what is right and wrong.  Rex, Stocki and Moser are a great team.  I hope more in the series will be made available",1518825600,,230,4.159090909090909
