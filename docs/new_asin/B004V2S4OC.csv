8442724,5,B004V2S4OC,Got it quickly. As advertised. Good show.,1470441600,,41,5.0
8442725,2,B004V2S4OC,"The second season tends to meander around quite a bit at first and then picks up after several shows. But, the conclusion to the season is rather poor and very unsatisfying emotionally,. both for the main villain and the two detectives. the writers seemed to have run out of inspiration. I thought the first season was brilliant and was very much looking forward to season two. too bad, really.",1322438400,,394,4.72463768115942
8442726,3,B004V2S4OC,"Although this story was more detailed than the first season's, it was not nearly as tight and the ending was contrived to match the beginning moments. This same thing was done in season 1 but with perfection; here it was forced and obviously just a gimmick. The story took tangents which did all eventually come together BASICALLY but nothing astounding. It lacked the punch of the first season and this was sad becasuse season 1 was so brilliant.",1314662400,3,447,4.743589743589744
8442727,5,B004V2S4OC,"Great to see a second season that is not a disappointment after the great first season. Better photography and cleaner than the first season, but still missing the great acting of Paola Krum as Laura Santini and Antonio Birabent as Bruno Costas!
Anyway, if you liked the first this second season is a must. If you did not see the first season, buy them both!

Ah, BTW, the packing inside is wrongly misslabeled as season 1, but the DVD's content is correctly season 2.",1312243200,2,468,4.571428571428571
8442728,4,B004V2S4OC,"This is a fantastic series and I'm glad that the second season is finally available! But there was a very strange situation with my copy - the outer packaging is all for season 2, but the inner packaging - including the labels on the discs themselves - are all for season 1. If you get a copy like this, check out the discs before you freak out - they were the correct ones, just mislabeled!",1311724800,7,391,4.226666666666667
8442729,5,B004V2S4OC,it's such a shame more people don't know about this show---there's really nothing like it out there---a series to be treasured. renzo and marina forever!,1307577600,,153,5.16
