8189457,5,B000P6R6MY,"This DVD explains the important aspects of ballet dance and how they relate to the boy ballet dancer. It is really good for a female ballet teacher because there are mostly instructional DVDs out there geared for girls and if you have boy students their training must be geared towards jumps and turns. It is not a class for a child to follow and I really think it's very helpful to me. As a female ballet teacher, there are movements boys and men need to perfect that I was not taught because I am female. If your students will not have the advantage of having a male ballet teacher at your school, this is very helpful to the female ballet teacher so the boy students will get the training they need.",1367712000,,702,4.366412213740458

8189459,2,B000P6R6MY,"Saying that this DVD was a disappointment would be an understatement.  The quality is poor,filming amateurish and it doesn't show much dancing.  There are far better DVDs out there for beginners even though they are aimed at girls.",1347926400,,231,5.052631578947368
8189460,1,B000P6R6MY,"I was looking for a DVD of a basic ballet class for my 10 year-old-son.  This is not a class.  I think this might be helpful for teachers, but it is not a tool for parents to use at home.",1329696000,4,187,3.65
8189461,4,B000P6R6MY,Is like watching boys doing a class... they give you tips to teach guys and if you are a guy they give you points of view in where you supposed to focus in order to strength and develop the muscles you will need in your career.. but nothing special or nothing you will fall in love... if you are a teacher you probably should get this... is Cute to watch the little kids taking class...,1302393600,2,386,4.16
8189462,4,B000P6R6MY,"Not a lot out there for boys about ballet if they want to practice at home.  All of the children's ballet dvds I have seen are only girls.  This one is just a little off putting due to the dated look.  With male dancers around like Bolle, one would hope that something a little more modern and technique oriented could be made for boys who are interested in learning ballet.",1296691200,5,374,4.314285714285714
8189463,5,B000P6R6MY,This is a great DVD for a male of any age group wanting to learn the basics of ballet.,1240531200,3,86,3.5789473684210527
