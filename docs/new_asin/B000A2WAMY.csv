8437276,3,B000A2WAMY,"In the mid-1990s, there was an extreme sports television show called ""The Extremists With Gabrielle Reece.""  It was one of my favorite programs at the time.  (Granted, I didn't have cable, and my antenna got like three channels.)  I thought this boxed set was that show, so I bought it.  If I'm not mistaken, I think the Amazon description for the product page mentioned Ms. Reece (at least at the time I made my purchase).  So, I get the boxed set through the mail, start watching an episode, and there's no mention of Gabrielle Reece.  Now, I suppose it's possible that they added her halfway through the season, but I'm not spending my time watching all those episodes to try to find out.  They just aren't the same without Gabby!  Therefore, I have to give this a mediocre rating.  The only reason I'm not giving it one star is that there is a chance she appears later in the season, but I'm just too lazy to check.  If anyone actually checks and provides an answer to this, please post a review here.  I would probably return this dvd set, but the price was so low, it's probably not worth the effort, and I will probably put it in the garbage eventually.  Assuming Gabby isn't in any of these episodes, WILL THE PERSON WHO OWNS THE RIGHTS, PLEEEEEAAAAASE RELEASE the REAL ""Extremists With Gabrielle Reece,"" and you may as well release the complete series as one boxed set, as I don't think there were that many episodes in the entire series.  Okay, that's enough commenting for now.",1397347200,,1488,4.548872180451128
