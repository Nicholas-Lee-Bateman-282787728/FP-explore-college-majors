8617321,4,B00FNRA3SO,"Sony's Choice Collection has put out an English dubbed edition of the hilarious ""Le Bambole"" (AKA: ""The Dolls""), a Royal Films release from 1965 starring in episodes with Virna Lisi and Nino Manfredi, Elke Sommer (who we know how she sounds but neither here nor in Italian can you actually hear her), Monica Vitti and Gina Lollobrigida, Jean Sorel and Akim Tamiroff, all superb.  The episodes were directed by Mauro Bolognini, Luigi Comencini, Dino Risi and Franco Rossi (in alphabetical order, not their respective sequences).  The Sony/Columbia Pictures product is excellent, but there are Italian speaking versions available with moderate and sometimes poor quality transfers, so I recommend ""Bambole!"" highly, but if you are at all any kind of completist and want to hear the original language(s), be warned.
