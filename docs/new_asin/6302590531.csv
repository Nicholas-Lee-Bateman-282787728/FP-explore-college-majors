487221,4,6302590531,This is a great comedy/ horror movie which plays on our fear of homeless people. Bill Paxton is great as a new home owner being terrorized by a homeless man. A few of the scenes were quite chilling and there is some gore so the squeamish need beware. I loved the twists and turns the movie makes and the ending will surprise you. It is purposely over the top which should be expected from a Mel Brooks production. Watch it late at night if you dare and you will check your locks before going to bed.,1409270400,5,499,4.208333333333333

487223,5,6302590531,This is a great film for anyone who loves disturbing suspense edge of your seat dark comedies. The story is about a everyday company man who is pushed over the edge by a psychotic vagrant that breaks in his newly bought house and frames him for deaths of the people around him. Bill Paxton has the best mouth acting in the business from Aliens to Weird Science this film is a must see. It is hard to find. Tried to find a torrent for it but the only one I found was in Russian. I made a old VHS copy of it back when blockbuster was that place you went to rent movies then get raped on the late charges. Those were the days,1334016000,5,622,4.024193548387097
487224,5,6302590531,"This movie has Bill Paxton as a man who man into a new house only to be terrorized by a vargant/homeless man. Paxton tries to get the police anybody to believe him. Eventually Paxton goes insane as he finally discovers who  the vargant is! Also co-starring in this movie is Micheal Ironside(Starship  Tropers,ER,Total Recall) as the cop looking Paxton's Vargant  problems! It's a movie that will have you laugh, cry and other emotions as  you either cheer on the vargant or Paxton! I enjoyed this movie and will  watch it again soon! The movie is great as is the plot! Is there any genre  Paxton cannot act in,I wonder! I know in this movie he did the job just  with his character! Kudos to everyone that worked on this movie! If you  want to see Bill Paxton go isane in one of his movie ,buy this movie! It's  a winner in my book!",954201600,12,831,4.379084967320262
487225,5,6302590531,"It's one of those bizarre dark horror comedies - and wait till you find out WHO the vagrant is... the terrific chamber score by Christopher Young (Hellraiser, Species, Urban Legend) is Philip Glass on a crack trip. A one  in a million.",942883200,18,235,4.595238095238095

7828315,4,6302590531,"I love me some Bill Paxton. Everyone should love Bill Paxton. He has since passed away but even before that I viewed him as a national treasure. If you can watch Weird Science, Aliens, The Vagrant, Tombstone, Near Dark, Twister, True Lies, A Simple Plan, or Frailty and not be enamored by him in at least one of those films, you need to re-evaluate your life.

Paxton plays Graham Krakowski a hardworking lower middle class citizen who purchases a fixer-upper. His new purchase is being intruded upon by a vagrant who proceeds to drive him insane. Graham believes the vagrant is a killer but others refuse to believe him. Is Graham going crazy or is this intrusive old man really a murderer?

I had a lot fun watching this slightly unknown gem. It's quirky and fits right in with Paxton's known nuttiness. He turns almost everyone against him as he slowly lets a weird vagrant encroach upon his personal life. Even though he can't afford it, he spends a substantial amount on building a fence around his whole residence, installing alarms and cameras. He becomes extremely paranoid and even dreams about this dirty old vagrant breaking into his house. Maybe he has the right to be paranoid? Give this one a try. Some great low-key humor with some thrills.",1506988800,,1255,4.726027397260274

7828319,5,6302590531,Bill Paxton at his best. I loved this movie. A black comedy playing off of the paranoia of a yuppie homeowner who may or may or not be terrorized by a homeless man who likes breaking into his house and messing with his mind. A great performance by the late great Bill Paxton.,1496620800,,275,4.2075471698113205

7828322,5,6302590531,"This movie is Bill Paxton at the top of his game.  His character's paranoia is off the charts and leads to some truly funny moments in the film.  Too bad Paxton (like all actors and actresses that make it big) doesn't showcase such wildly enjoyable performances anymore.  However, acting like this is why he became big.  Great movie.",1479686400,4,333,4.689655172413793
