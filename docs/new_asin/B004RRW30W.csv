4461054,5,B004RRW30W,This documentary is short and sweet.  You really get to see the real personalities of Will and Kate and how in love they are.  They seem really excited about their future.  I ordered it for my mom because she loves history and this is definitely an event that will go down in ours!,1300665600,9,281,4.264150943396227

8439234,4,B004RRW30W,"As a Princess Diana fan, it has been fun to watch William grow up and embody the best qualities of his mother, father and grandmother Queen Elizabeth. It seems no one can find fault with his choice of a queen-to-be.  With Royal Jubilee week this past week, it was fun to watch scenes of England.  If you want to see more of Britain, this fun little DVD takes you to the haunts of William and Kate and explains their history, how and where they met (at St. Andrews), and their engagement/wedding planning details.  Royal insiders share their thoughts about the couple and their plans, so if you like that sort of thing, and I do, this is a bit of fun and froth.  There's not a lot of detail, but this is a warm-hearted overview of the couple.  So, wouldn't expect much more than you've seen before in still photos, occasional interviews etc. if you are Royal watchers.  This film ties it all together and probably best watched on a rainy or cool night with a bowl of popcorn for a girl's night in.

I thoroughly enjoyed this romance-friendship story on film--you can stream it from Netflix for free if you don't need to own it--and I learned some facts about the couple I hadn't known.  Speculation on Catherine's dress designer for the wedding in this film was entertaining.  In retrospect it seems obvious that Catherine might choose a designer named McQueen. There was a picture of Catherine's mother in front of Bruce Oldfield's design shop, and he did design Catherine's mother's gown which resembled dresses Diana used to wear.

The film did re-show a lot of the same video of Catherine as a single woman walking down a street when they talked about her, but since there was legal action taken regarding photographing and filming her by the Royal Family when Prince William was dating her, there probably wasn't much video available so it's understandable they showed the same footage over and over.

If you're a Royal Family and Prince William, Harry and Catherine fan, you should enjoy this charming film.  And there's some lovely scenery of England and Scotland as backdrop as an added pleasure.",1339200000,,2103,4.700272479564033
8439235,3,B004RRW30W,"I rented the video as a test before buying for my grandaughter; I'm glad that I did. It's ok for a one off viewing, but perhaps not worth the cost of full purchase. There are several instances where they do not have the correct dates, and the mistake which stands out most to me is the place in the video where they are discussing the wedding dress. While spectulating as to who the designer might be; they draw comparisons between the styles of the Duchess; and Diana, Princess of Wales; even highlighting hers from 1981. They mention Elizabeth Emanuel; but not her former husband David, who did much of the design himself, and when it is time to interview Elizabeth, the name ""Charlotte Todd - Designer"" appears on the screen and not that of her own name. Nice footage of Diana, and early interviews with William during his Gap year; but I wouldn't recommend it for purchase.",1313452800,5,877,4.592356687898089

This DVD PRINCE WILLIAM & KATE: THE ROYAL ROMANCE, produced by P.B.S. (Public Broadcasting Service), was produced AFTER the royal engagement announcement,
but BEFORE the actual wedding.  So, although the people who, on this DVD are ""royalty experts"", ""insiders"", and ""in the know"", probably (still) DO know a lot about the Royal family and the underpinnings of what goes on in the palace, they do NOT know as much as anyone ""ordinary"" who has bought or viewed this DVD - POST 29th April, 2011, that is.  Of course, the people interviewed on this DVD
NOW know a great deal more than thaty did then about the Royal Wedding -- but they did NOT know this when this documentary was produced!

So -- we see a wonderful royal weddng cake which was NOT the final choice for the wedding cake, and glimpse an astonishingly beautiful wedding gown....which was NOT Kate Middleton's choice fir her wedding gown at all! We see the coach they left in, after the wedding -- but NOT the suprising and delightful drive throgh in Prince Charles Aston Martin.  Even the most ""common"" of commoners, (today), knows a great deal more than these ""experts"" did, in pre-wedding days.

Still, it's nice to see SOME of the behind-the-scenes preparations.  And if not oll fo them are exactly what came to pass, they still have a deep ring of authenticity about them.

Personally, I would have liked to see much more.  By this time, a ""second edtion"" should be masde, enompassing all the wedding- (and post weddng), events.  Like -- where did the various guests stay before the wedding?  Who, if anyone, stayed at Buckingham Palace/  At Kensington Palace?  Or....where else?  What happened at the post-wedding reception?  Were there any pre- or post-wedding concerts, as were held
at the equally-magnificent, just-past Swedish Royal Wedding?  Did Prince William -- and the new Princess Catherine -- give any public or private speeches after the wedding, as the royal Swedish couple did?  What music was played at the reception....nd afterwards?

In this pre-wedding edition, it's easy to feel smugly superiour to the ""experts"" who didn't predict the right dress, the right wedding cake,etc. Post wedding celebratins are not covered, at all.  This DVD gives a nice, though generalized view of pre-royal preparations.  They are regal, and they are breath-taking. But sometimes they are dead wrong, and little extra material is given.",1307318400,5,2477,4.93719806763285
8439237,2,B004RRW30W,"Judge Bill Gibron, DVD Verdict -- ""As an already pointless relic of a country eager to celebrate something special, this is a ridiculous rip-off contained within an impossible to deny desperation by the British citizenry for anything William and Kate related. At only 45 minutes (with an additional 10 of already viewed Q&A material from the presentation itself as a ""bonus feature""), it's a pointless entertainment endeavor. It's just a cobbled-together collection of editorial tidbits hastily fastened to a fiasco of an explanation. Sure, William and Kate look good, and they come off as cool and confident. Just wait until after the pomp and circumstance. That's when the British press will really take the gloves off and start swinging. For now, they're playing pleasant, even if Prince William and Kate: The Royal Romance is more noxious than nice."" You can read the full review at [...]",1303084800,3,892,5.116438356164384
