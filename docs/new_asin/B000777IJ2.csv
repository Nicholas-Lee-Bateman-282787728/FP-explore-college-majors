2202796,4,B000777IJ2,"The Twilight Zone was picking up speed by Season 2.  By this time, CBS began to see that it was a great show, which all of us knew since the beginning.

The only problem that plagued Season 2 were the six episodes that were videotaped instead of filmed due to budget reasons.  These episodes were ""The Lateness of the Hour,"" ""Static,"" ""The Whole Truth,"" ""Night of the Meek,"" ""Twenty-Two,"" and ""Long Distance Call"" (you can actually view the difference when compared to the remaining episodes).

With this Definitive Edition, it is obvious that the videotaped episodes haven't held up well visually and audibly.  Many of the scenes from these episodes either jump or fluctuate.  The audio is also hard to hear when characters are away from the camera, thus, away from the microphone.

However, don't let these episodes sway the fact that The Twilight Zone was a great show and even with these few episodes, Season 2 is a great addition.",1141084800,18,935,4.770186335403727
2202797,5,B000777IJ2,"You might think because of the yearly Twilight Zone marathons played on TV that ypou've seen them all, but I thought the same until I bought all five seasons. There are many, many episodes I haven't seen and enjoyed fully.",1140652800,8,222,4.575
2202798,5,B000777IJ2,"I love Twilight Zone. It's one of the greatest TV shows of all time, and it's great to see the episodes presented by season in their original order. I do have some nitpicking though with the packaging:

The extra stuff is fun - but some of the ads for other TV shows and TZ Billboards in the middle of the episodes kind of break the mood while you're watching the stories.

Also, while the filmed episodes look terrific, some of the videotaped shows in Season 2 suffer from a fluttering and decomposing picture quality. Couldn't they find better copies, or maybe is it just that videotape doesn't preserve well? I have the VHS tapes from CBS Video Library from nearly 20 years ago, and I don't remember these issues with the 6 videotaped episodes.

Finally, a 'Play All' feature on the discs, and a direct start of each episode (instead of going to an index of scenes that hints what will happen) would have been nice too - not too mention that some of the seasons are missing closed captioning. Probably not a big deal if you have a modern TV though.

Despite these criticisms, TZ is still wonderful to have. Highly recommended to anyone who likes good stories that give you something to think about.",1138406400,10,1201,4.546296296296297
2202799,5,B000777IJ2,The Definitive Edition was great quality. I was taken back to the 1960's as I watched my DVD's. Keep up the great work.,1125705600,5,119,4.217391304347826
2202800,5,B000777IJ2,"The twilight zone is heavily based on the metaphysical outcomes of quantum physics, relativity and psychology. The picture quality is excellent and the sound is cristal clear (notice how some episodes looked like they were filmed with a handycam). I won't have to wait for the sci-fi channel marathons to watch them now. Overall: EXCELLENT!",1123545600,8,340,5.2
2202801,5,B000777IJ2,"This set lives up to its billing.  The Definitive Edition, seasons one and two (with the rest come shortly), finally delivers the quality this series deserves.  The video reproduction is stunning and the extras fill out a perfect package.  I've seen some reviews suggesting that this edition will quickly be replaced by yet another improved edition.  Don't believe it.  With this set, the old reels and their caretakers have put up about all they can deliver--outstanding video, reproduction in original broadcast order, a detailed book-length episode guide and commentary with the season 1 package, and, finally, Rod Serling introducing ""next week's"" show.  Until DVD's are replaced as a delivery vehicle, this edition will be as good as it gets.",1113350400,36,747,5.235294117647059
2202802,5,B000777IJ2,"The Complete Second Season of Rod Serling's Twilight Zone is now on DVD. This second season contains all 29 episodes on 5 disks. It is full frame and is about 900 minutes.

2202803,5,B000777IJ2,"If you hopped on board for season 1's definition edition, you probably don't need much convincing to pick this one up either. It's a great deal cheaper than season 1 (though there are less episodes in this season) but packs a lot of punch considering the high benchmark set for the show's debut season. There are a great number of gems with very few clunkers sprinkled in.

Among the episodes collected here are two of the series' most poignant social commentaries in ""The Obsolete Man"" (with Burgess Meredith) and ""Eye of the Beholder"" (probably the most infamous episode in all of TZ lore). To make things more varied, the second season also brought us some lighter fare like ""Mr. Dingle the Strong"" and ""A Penny for Your Thoughts"". We also get the TZ debut of Shatner in ""Nick of Time"" and its companion piece ""The Silence"", both notable episodes for containing no real supernatural elements yet keeping very much in the spirit of the Twilight Zone. And some of the best-loved episodes of all, the flawless ""One Hundred Yards Over the Rim"" (featuring audio commentary with star Cliff Robertson, Oscar winner for ""Charly"" and 'Uncle Ben' in ""Spiderman""); ""Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?"" (a brilliant ensemble piece driven by atmosphere); and ""Shadow Play"" (one of the most overlooked episodes in the series).

Season two also brought about budget restraints, which lowered the total number of episodes and caused several to be shot on videotape. Few other shows could have gotten away with this approach, and the videotaped episodes include a heartwarming Christmas-themed ""Night of the Meek"" that sees Art Carney becoming Santa Claus and ""Twenty-Two"", which suffers through probably the worst special effect in the history of television. If you haven't seen it; I dare not spoil it for you.

Boasting remastered hi-def film transfers from original camera negatives and magnetic soundtracks as well as continuing the tradition of restoring the ""Next Week"" teasers from Serling as they belong in the broadcasts (even those that ended up with Serling holding a pack of Oasis Cigarettes and puffing away -- priceless!), season 2 is yet another excursion into the Twilight Zone that will offer something that even diehards will not have seen or heard yet.

Commentaries include:

* Billy Mumy & William Idelson on ""The Long Distance Call"" (Videotaped episode. Mumy's other TZ credit is as the legendary Anthony Fremont in ""It's a Good Life"", which he has recorded an additional commentary for to look forward to in season 3's set. Idelson had acted in a season 1 episode but actually wrote this episode himself, though Charles Beaumont is credited with co-writing it -- Idelson goes into a bit of detail in regards to this. Meanwhile, Mumy shares stories about his mother's hesitance to let him star in such a morbid episode and informs us that he went to high school with 'TZ Companion' author Marc Scott Zicree himself!)
* Cliff Robertson on ""One Hundred Yards Over the Rim"" (Understated time travel episode -- Oscar Winner Robertson's performance is incredibly real here. His commentary is less than animated than the one mentioned above, but still enjoyable as he talks about the 9-page report on the character that he had written himself before shooting began, the ""controversy"" over the tophat he wore, and even lets us know he's writing the script for ""Charly 2""!)
* Dennis Weaver on ""Shadow Play""
* Shelley Berman on ""The Mind and the Matter"" (Truly a ridiculous episode and, in true TZ fashion, becomes enjoyable for exactly that reason.)
* Donna Douglas on ""The Eye of the Beholder"" (Not the voice -- except for some dialogue at the end that didn't require her to be overdubbed -- but the infamous face in this episode -- and later Ellie Mae of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" notoriety.)
* Don Rickles on ""Mr. Dingle the Strong"" (great to see the ""Merchant of Venom"" contributing an audio commentary)

Also included are original production slates for the 6 videotaped episodes. These are small videotaped clips of the guy with the production slate in hand, calling out the show name, production number, take and then ""Action!"" Might seem like a minor inclusion, but really helps lend credibility to a set that calls itself ""definitive"". Really, it's the little things that can make a huge difference. We get all of this content, plus the Mike Wallace Interview with Rod Serling (a marvelous piece originally available on one of the ""Treasures..."" discs), Serling appearances on ""Tell it to Groucho"" and ""The Jack Benny Show"", another wave of TZ radio dramas & isolated original scores, plus a DVD-ROM script of ""Twenty-Two"" with Serling's notes and a lot more audio interviews contributed by ""TZ Companion"" author Marc Scott Zicree all add up to make this the second installment of ""Must-Buy TV"". Your wallet compels you!",1111449600,83,4833,4.967861557478368
2202804,5,B000777IJ2,"How much are we lovin' these releases of The Twilight Zone in these definitive collection dvd packs?

Season 2: all the eps including classics like

""The Odyssey of Flight 33"", ""The Howling Man"", and ""The Trouble with Templeton"".

But the treat here again are the features and if what I've read is true, then picking this up for $69:99 is a very good buy.

Radio Twilight Zone eps, appearances made by Rod Serling on a number of tv shows including ""The Jack Benny Show"", original promos for the next weeks' episode, and commentaries by Dennis Weaver (how good is ""Shadowplay""?), Don Rickles, Fritz Weaver and others, whose names have escaped me at the moment.

Ok, maybe season 2 wasn't quite as good as 1 but with the features, the lower price and the mere existence of these on dvd, well you can't complain.",1110931200,13,809,4.629370629370629

2202826,5,B000777IJ2,"TW season #2 is arguably the best of its 5-year run. It was the 2nd year when just about everything came together for this great classic series. Many of the best & most well known episodes came from Season 2, incl--- 'The Obsolete Man'; 'Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up'; 'The Invaders'; 'The Odyssey of Flight 33'; 'The Howling Man'; 'Eye of the Beholder', & too many more to mention.  There were ""only"" 29 episodes, compared to 36 in the 1st season. On the down side, CBS began their constant barrage against Serling to make cheaper episodes, a barrage that would only increase during the remainder of the series.  This led to 6 episodes shot on video tape instead of film, which was too much of a constraint for this type of show. Years ago, it was hard to tell, but as Hi-Def TV's have come along, these episodes stick out like a sore thumb. It doesn't really matter, as they were still very good.

Part of the fun is to look at the cast when the credits roll to see major stars of today who were getting their early breaks into show biz back then.

Not only entertaining....it is a quick education on what was going on in the 60's.  From war and weapons to outspace, and from time travel to aliens....they have it all...  Sometimes the episodes accurately depict what life in 2016 is like...where some are so far out that it is like a trip to Tomorrowland circa 1963.  All in all a very enjoyable series that I highly recommend.  The episodes (sans commercials) are perfect to watch over lunch break.  Enjoy!",1474848000,,609,4.8076923076923075

The episodes, and their story line are delivered through the actors, not special effects. Shot in black and white with only one camera I believe.

2203247,5,B000777IJ2,"I bought this set as part of the Complete Series box set, and the episode I remember most clearly out of this season set is ""The Obsolete Man"", starring Burgess Meredith and Fritz Weaver. In it, a librarian (Meredith) is condemned to death by a blustering demagogue (Weaver) because books have been banned as being irrelevant by the totalitarian State. At the end, Rod Serling does his accustomed preview of what's on next week. But the episode Serling names isn't in this set. I later found it at the beginning of the Season 1 set and went ""duh""--of course ""Obsolete Man"" had been broadcast as the last episode of this season, so it was time for reruns. Anyway, when I got to school the day after ""Obsolete Man"" aired in 1961, a lot of the guys who tended to bully the nerdy kids had also seen the episode and immediately ganged up on all the kids who ""read too much"", chanting ""obsolete, obsolete"". In retrospect I get the impression that they missed Serling's point. But now--years after Serling's death--the incident at my school does tend to provide a hint of just what kind of people make up the kind of State that Serling describes in the episode.",1449187200,,1154,4.579710144927536

How different from some modern sitcoms that were good for a while and after few seasons just decayed towards the end -for example The Big Bang Theory and Two and a Half Men. Twilight Zone with fewer resources, less experience with audiences, and clearly lower budget, focused on what is important: good story-telling as opposed to using futile, sexist, or racial jokes from snobbish nouveau riches (new-rich) actors. Bravo for the old writers and actors. They set a pretty good standard.",1446940800,,514,5.0588235294117645

His ability to present the possible ways in which humans can dehumanize one other is only matched by the lesson of why it is important to be vigilant against government oppression. The Obsolete Man demonstrates how blind adherence to an over-bearing state can cause us to lose sight of those individualist and collective elements that contribute to a better society. See this and be amazed how relevant it is and continues to be; Serling could have written this in the days of Hobbes and Locke or in 2015, making it a lesson for all to learn regarding the place, development, and force of the state in everyone's life.",1443139200,,705,4.8347107438016526

2203381,5,B000777IJ2,"Twilight Zone was a groundbreaking series for its time.  The actors, plots, and, of course, Rod Serling created a television program that delved into the fantasies, horrors, and imagination of the viewers.  I loved it when it first came out and still do!",1434412800,,254,4.883720930232558
2203382,5,B000777IJ2,"Of course, everyone, every American,  in my age bracket grew up with The Twilight Zone. As a kid, the show seemed more eerie than it feels now. And there were eerie aspects to the show, and it still strikes me somewhat that way today. The music, the camera work, the narration. But the amazing thing about the show as I watch today is the incredible deep messaging in the episodes. There are big psychological, metaphysical, and even human relationship issues that run through almost every episode. And they sneak up on you, from almost every angle of everyday life. I haven't read too much commentary on Rod Serling's work, so if this is redundant observation, my apologies, but I think Rod Serling has to rank as one of the great philosophers of our time. And he used the medium of TV to get the message out in a very, very entertaining way. The approach may seem preachy to folks today with some of the issues he pinpointed, whether it was greed, or emotional attachment, or gambling addictions, or fear {fear, that is probably the main issue that Serling explores} but he really, really makes you think. This show is readily available on Amazon Prime, and it should be standard assignment for people interested in philosophy, religious studies, or metaphysics. Truly, every show is a work of art and intelligently put together. Some of the episodes are hilarious, and you can see themes that were used in movies that appear later on. One example, Season 2, Episode 14, ""The Whole Truth."" The story is about a used car salesman who finds himself in a similar situation as Jim Carrey in the movie ""Liar, Liar"" That episode is so funny it was almost impossible not to laugh out loud.  The acting is usually first-rate, with big stars, many times early in their careers, sometimes the ""twilight"" of their careers. It's serious acting, not tongue-in-cheek at all, even though the subjects are sometimes outlandish, the actors never break their stride. That is one of the things about the show that makes it so good, it treats the ideas seriously.  The Twilight Zone, truly an iconic show!",1434412800,,2087,4.743801652892562

At times the 25-minute dramatizations can be very frightening, but there is generally no ""blood and guts"" horror. Rather, the stories can be terrifying the way the plight of the Morlocks is terrifying in H.G. Wells' ""Time Machine"". Some of the episodes veer into science fiction, and many concern the nature of the relationship between individuals and those in authority. The series has worn well for the most part, although some references deal with specific concerns of the period, such as the cold war between the US/USSR and their respective allies.

So, they look at a calendar to discuss the schedule.
But the calendar in the hallway shows 1944!
(Yes, the newspaper article should not say bomber went down 17 years ago).
The doctor turns to the officer: and asks:

2203494,5,B000777IJ2,"The second season of THE TWILIGHT ZONE had many memorable episodes. Rod Serling was a man of great literary and social intellect, somewhat ignored because of the genre he worked within and was famous for. ""The Twilight Zone"" frequently bordered on the edges of science fiction if not immersed in it. Society's values being what they are, science fiction has never been thoroughly embraced by conventional thought as a legitimate literary or cinematic art form. That is society's loss and Serling's heartbreak. However, ""The Twilight Zone"" still endures.

THE TROUBLE WITH TEMPLETON is a very sentimental and endearing episode written by E. Jack Neuman and directed by Buzz Kulik. Veteran actor Brian Aherne is given a chance to see earlier times, happier times, but memory and truth are not always one and the same. I love this simple episode. Brian Aherne was always such a dignified actor with a flair for lighting up the screen with his contagiously likable presence. The casting of Brian Aherne here was a brilliantly one. As a viewer, one can really relate to the years and memories that this great actor and the character he plays here must have experienced. Uniquely in this role, given his great performance here, Brian Aherne elevates this episode far beyond the mundane.

LATENESS OF THE HOUR is from the Second Season and it was filmed on video tape. It was written by Rod Serling and directed by Jack Smight. Inger Stevens plays a young woman and her father (John Hoyt) is a stickler for precision in every aspect of his life. That obsession for precision takes its toll upon their robot servant girl and has a devastating effect on Inger Steven. Thus, the conflict between them erupts with devastating reality. This is a classic episode and somehow that it was shot on video instead of film adds to stage like quality it captures.

EYE OF THE BEHOLDER says it all. Janet Tyler will have to have her bandages removed from her face to reveal if the operation was a success or not. But, there is more than meets the eye to that question and Bernard Herrmann's score brilliantly sets the mood for this very powerful study into the human psyche.

NIGHT OF THE MEEK is pure Serling all the way. Rod Serling's yearning for those cherished days long gone or a part of ourselves that we think was lost is always evident in his best works. NIGHT OF THE MEEK is very uplifting and may bring a tear to those who cherish this episode. Art Carney showed us all a great dramatic side and depth which enhances this beyond the ordinary. The fact that this was one of the six episodes of THE TWILIGHT ZONE that were recorded directly onto videotape instead of film gives it that ""live"" appearance and helps add to its validity as an icon of the days of ""good television.""

THE SILENCE seems like it would be more at home as an episode of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents."" However, Franchot Tone gives an excellent performance as an elder member of a parlor club who finds the ceaseless rhetorical chatter of a younger member (Liam Sullivan) too nauseating to bear. Franchot Tone offers Sullivan a half million dollars if he can keep silent for a full year. Jonathan Harris, Tone's friend advises him against making the bet but to no avail. Written by Rod Serling, this is actually one of his more memorable episodes from the Second Season of The Twilight Zone and is true to his ongoing theme of nostalgia for days or generations past. We have the old guard up butting up against the new, the more flamboyant, more self-assured and more modern thinking younger point of view. Yet, Franchot Tone does not fit into that category of endearment of an earlier generation, his age places him there, but not the man. That is what is so interesting about this episode. Also, thematically to the nature of The Twilight Zone, there are no elements of the fantastic, but simply twists of fate that shape the effect of this tale. Franchot Tone was a veteran motion picture star and an almost forgotten one at this point in his career and it is amazing to watch him in this episode directed by Boris Segal. It is so intriguing how the old guard faces off against the new. Rod Serling does not really give us a any feeling of optimism which he usually does for this theme as he did so endearingly in WALKING DISTANCE. This is a classic episode.

LONG DISTANCE CALL written by Charles Beaumont and William Idelson is one of the six episodes recorded directly to videotape instead of being photographed on film. The story concerns a little boy played by Billy Mumy who communicates with his dead grandmother over his toy phone. Thematically it rounds out this volume as it examines our attachment to those we love.

MR. DINGLE, THE STRONG is a neat little episode written by Rod Serling and directed by John Brahm from the second season where a timid little man (Burgess Meredith) is suddenly given superpowers to the dismay of his tormentor (Don Rickles). It is all an  experiment conducted by a two-headed Martian.",1420675200,2,4990,4.701372997711671

2203564,4,B000777IJ2,"This review is for the original, dual layered version of the 2nd season of the original Twilight Zone on DVD.  This is one with all the extras on dual layered discs.  This series was also released with the same box art saying it was dual layered but were actually single layered discs.  Then, an Episodes Only collection was released.

I deducted 1 star because of the odd errors that were present on the discs in this collection.  I'll get to that later.  This release gets 4 stars because of the quality of the episodes themselves.  Rod Serling, Richard Matheson, Charles Beaumont, and George Clayton Johnson turned in a superb series of stories for season 2.  Classics like The Invaders, Will The Real Martian Please Stand Up?, and The Obsolete Man are part of this season.  The episodes are presented as completely as they've ever been released before.  They even include the middle title cards and the Next Week teasers.  These teasers haven't been seen since the series originally aired.  Nearly every episode has an isolated score track and some have commentaries from the people associated with them who were still alive.

However, the presentation of this set has some rather odd errors.  A lot of episodes say they have Twilight Zone radio drama adaptations as extra features.  Selecting these bonus features does nothing!  If you select them in Windows Media Player, the player crashes!  I've checked the DVD's and the streams for these special features simply aren't there.  So, the discs were made this way.  Disc 5 isolated score tracks are unusual in that they do have some dialogue in them: Rod Serling's opening narration on the titles animation.  No other isolated score tracks are this way.  On the other discs, many isolated scores have very soft dialogue present on them.  There's also a weird audio item on Mr. Dingle, The Strong.  When Don Rickles twists Burgess Meredith's nose near the end, he first taps him on the shoulder.  Burgess acknowledges this by humming at him.  This hum is not present on my DVD set.

So, the bottom line is you will enjoy the content on these discs, for the most part.  Don't be surprised if some bonus features don't work because they simply were never there to begin with.  A tad bit sloppy in presentation.",1408579200,,2263,4.7927461139896375

Each episode is a short story masterpiece, with few actors, no special effects, and a simple direct plot.  But these stories could run rings around some of the current hour long dramas.  Most importantly, at the end of each show, the viewer actually has to stop and think about the meaning of the story.

There seemed to be less of the exaggerated sci-fi weirdness, and more focus on following the characters through the fictional setting, which overall made for better storytelling.  Most of the episodes in this season depend less on the novelty of the main idea, and more on telling an interesting story in that setting, so they don't lose as much when I recognize ideas I've seen in other places.  It seems like Serling et al. were figuring out how keep the main idea from being a gimmick, which it was too often in season one, and now I'm looking forward to seeing what they did with season three.",1404518400,,654,4.572649572649572

Although at times the technical aspects of the shows might seem nave or off their mark, the acting is usually spot on and the story line is always interesting.

TV deserves the nickname, ""great American wasteland."" I believe they could take this series and put it in Prime Time
and it would capture that time slot. Unless someone has satellite and has been introduced to ""The Twilight Zone""
(those under their 50's) they don't know of the golden age of TV. Its such a shame that Rod Serling died of a heart attack at 50-you can't just plug someone else in with such vision, or let the networks demand creative control; no creative director/producer will work under terms that amount to censorship.

I like twilight zone and think its a great show but the mixture of stories in this season are less exciting and very dated. If your going to watch this season go straight for the classics and skip the other episodes. They aren't up to par to some of the other stories Rod Sterling made in other seasons.

I watched something with ""Rip Van Winkle"" in the title.
While growing up,  I watched many of these, but do not remember seeing this one. In typical Rod Serling fashion, fouor crooks steal gold and then hibernate in suspended animation for about 100 years. Only three awaken as one dies from having his chamber destroyed over the years. One gets greedy for all the gold, kill another but destroys their old car. This proves to be a big mistake since they are out in a desert miles from town. The remaining two have to walk miles in the sun without water towards the nearest town. Eventually, one kills the other and dies himself while holding onto the gold. Almost immediately, a couple drives up in their rocket car and find him with his bar of gold. The man in the car tells his woman partner that gold used to be worth something but no longer and throws the gold bar into the desert.

Just pure unadulterated spookiness and unsubtle social commentary without the ice, mixers, garnish, special guest appearances, or commercial breaks. Well, maybe a word or two from our sponsor before the chain-smoking Rod Serling tosses out a teaser about next week's episode. Good Lord, he might even mention the name of the writer! That's the way it was in '50s/'60s TV. And Twilight Zone was among the best of the lot. Still is.

Go ahead. Treat yourself to a marathon of little boys wishing their enemies into the corn field, nuclear worldwide war paranoia, troubled men longing for bygone days of idyllic youth, and troubled women longing for -- or desperate to avoid -- perverted beauty. You may never want to get on a plane again. Even the devil himself-- well, I won't spoil it for you.

The episodes appear in their original broadcast order. For my money, the best years were the first season and the fourth (the only hour-long episodes), but feel free to disagree. Yeah, there are a few clunkers in there, but go ahead and buy all five seasons. You know you want to.",1388448000,,1122,4.690355329949239

2203692,5,B000777IJ2,Rod Serling is one of the most creative screen writers of the 20th century.

In my opinion this was a ""thinking mans"" series. Having been a child at the time, I would not have been able to voice that but in revisiting them I experience many of the same thoughts that I did at the time. Just as I did back them, I am amazed that so much could have been communicated in such a short period of time (less than 30 minutes including commercials.)

For those who have never seen them, let me encourage you to give them a try. I just saw them with someone 20 years my junior and, despite them being in black and white (a format which seems a bit challenging to many who have largely only been exposed to color) she got as much out of them as I did.

I put this thing into my blu-ray player right after watching the Jurassic Park blu-ray, and was simply WOWED at how much better these transfers look than that film.

Although for some of them, you can see the ending coming, it's still enjoyable to see how TV shows can be made to be very creative without graphic sex and violence.  It's also enjoyable to see some stars before they were famous (e.g. a young William Shatner).

This is by far the best Twilight Zone episode ever created! Watch and listen to what the past is saying of our future..",1361577600,,489,4.384615384615385

2203739,5,B000777IJ2,Rod Serling's works are ever relevant. I remember them as being great. Seeing them again confirmed that. 'The Obsolete Man' is one of many memorable episodes. These provide a great antidote to the mindless and much-copied theme that characterize much contemporary programming.,1360627200,,276,5.595238095238095

2203748,5,B000777IJ2,I have always been a huge fan of Rod Serling and the Twilight Zone. This particular episode really caught my attention because of how pertinnent it  is to the present time in which we are living. Especially the second half of the show. An out of control government determining the usefulness of the citizenry. Not out of the realm of possibilities.,1357344000,,348,4.704918032786885
2203749,4,B000777IJ2,TZ helps you use your own imagination to really get a thrill!!! This indulgence was worth while. Good quality and sound,1356998400,,119,4.714285714285714
2203750,4,B000777IJ2,"Season 2, Episode 61, ""The Silence"" was one of the more enjoyable Twilight Zone episodes I had seen in some time.  Jamie Tennyson (Liam Sullivan, who was ""Apollo"" in Star Trek!) stars as the overly gabby member of a millionaires' club, whose main passion apparently is to gab and gab and gab.

Having had enough, Colonel Archie Taylor bets that Tennyson can't shut up for one full year.  If he does, the Colonel will pay him $500,000.

It's an interesting way to get a guy to shut up.  Tennyson spends the year in a large glass-enclosed box of a room and wears lots of scarves and neckties.  It's hurtful the way Taylor teases Tennyson, making up stories about his wife hanging out with other men.  But Tennyson does not break.

It was cool to see Taylor's lawyer played by character actor Jonathan Harris (Lost in Space's Dr. Smith) in a serious rather than his humorous roles in that crazy Irwin Allen show.

Bottom Line:  Great twist ending if you've never seen this episode before.  This episode really ranks up there with episodes starring Agnes Moorehead and others.  A must-watch for sure.  A great study in human psychology, stress and eventual ending that in some ways leaves the viewer wanting.  Written by Rod Serling himself.  Recommended.

2203758,4,B000777IJ2,"The Twilight Zone has always been among my all-time favourite tv shows despite the fact then when I first encountered it as a boy it scared me so much that I couldn't sleep! This second season is now in Blu-Ray format and while not every episode looks great on 1080p due to the various states of deterioration of the original master tapes they are certainly a whole lot better than the dvds. The sound quality for the most part has been cleaned up and hisses are few and far between. What I like about the Twilight Zone is that I never seem to tire of watching the episodes over and over again as I always seem to find something new that I missed on previous times. Not all the episodes in this second season score but the ones I liked the most are: ""The Howling Man"", ""The Eye of the Beholder"", ""The Invaders"", ""Twenty-Two"", ""Long Distance Call"", ""The Silence"", and ""The Obsolete Man"".

While most episodes have excellent picture and sound quality, a few are not so well transferred but overall this is a very good blu-ray set of season two of the series.

Recommended!",1342051200,,1070,4.482051282051282
2203759,5,B000777IJ2,blown away by how many great episodes are on season 2(including my favorite of all the obsolete man) most of the episodes contain a radio-drama version and all include a choice between original and remastered audio. The picture quality is amazing although the format could not be altered to wide screen resolutions (16x9 and 16x10)since they did not exist at the time so there are black bars on the left and right side of the screen to give the 4x3 traditional aspect ratio in high definition. I would absolutely love if they released a standard definition version of the entire twilight zone series on one or two blu rays so avoid disc swapping and to drop the price of the series so everyone could enjoy this television classic that has stood the test of time.,1341360000,,762,4.651851851851852
2203760,5,B000777IJ2,"""Eye of the Beholder"" may no longer have the surprise it did for the viewers who watched this episode for the first time back in 1960 but the social message still resonates in our modern culture of hating the ""other."" Who defines what is beautiful? Who establishes the cultural norms? How do we treat those who fail to conform? At its best the Twilight Zone asked the difficult questions about human existence shining a light on our fears, prejudices and ignorance. This episode stands out for hitting us where we live and how we act when confronted by those who are different.",1340064000,,577,4.666666666666667
2203761,5,B000777IJ2,"Used this fun episode recently with my Language Arts students in 6th grade. It was an introduction to a Science Fiction unit.

A rifle carried west at this period of time by the early pioneers would have been a Flintlock Rifle of some kind, not a breech loader.

2203766,5,B000777IJ2,"I've been a fan of The Twilight Zone ever since I saw William Shatner's classic performance in Nightmare at 20,000 Feet. Normally, I'm skeptical about older shows being remastered like this for Blu-ray, but overall, I'm pretty impressed. In a nutshell, here's what I think about The Twilight Zone on Blu-ray.

GOOD
- the quality of the transfers look very impressive in HD, there's no artifacts or other anomologies sometimes seen in the DVD version
- the audio tracks have been restored and remastered and they give a lot of new depth to some of the classic episodes
- a nice collection of episodes that still stand the test of time
- great extras are included, including interviews and other behind the scenes bits

BAD
- the set can be kinda pricey, so shop around for the best deal

Even if you have these on regular DVD, I realize that it can be daunting to buy another series AGAIN, just to have it in HD, but trust me, it's worth it.",1326326400,,940,4.485380116959064
2203767,5,B000777IJ2,I feel its a must have for all Twilight Zone Fans. It has boat loads of information that never fit on the standard DVD. Each Season is unique and full of fun facts.,1325289600,,164,4.0

Anyway, one night I was in the living room watching TV clicking through the channels and came across this episode.  I was mesmerized and hooked from there after.  Rod Sterling was ahead of his time.  The TZ series was just amazing and some famous actors starred in them which is cool.  The stories presented in a half hour grab your attention, make you crave for the ending and leave you thinking.  I would recommend this series to anyone.  Enjoy!",1323907200,,567,4.233644859813084

Whether it be a first time purchase or replacement for the regular definitive dvd versions, the crystal clarity and remastered sound is simply stunning.  The resolution is so high that, in close ups, you can see the pores on people's faces and see the individual fibers that make up their clothing.  I am simply amazed that they could take old film and make it look so good.  What you see on this set is likely better than anyone has ever seen them, even when they were originally broadcast.  The bonus features are cool and also in HD as well.  I love the packaging.  It's slim and the same size as any other single disc bluray release.  It has two sturdy flaps on the inside that hold the discs very nicely.  If I could give it 10 stars I would.  You will not be disappointed!!!",1316217600,3,836,4.398692810457517

Where film can be re-sampled in higher resolution for Blu-ray, videocassette cannot. Viewers may also notice that these episodes were shot at 30 frames per second. This is different enough from the 24 frames per second that you are used to that you will notice, and undoubtedly dislike, the change. I know that many will buy this season on blu-ray to have a complete set, but know that half of this season will be visually disappointing.",1313539200,,585,4.909090909090909
2203775,5,B000777IJ2,"KUDOS to the folks at Image for NOT using evil DNR which would have destroyed Mr. Serling's original intent. To those that do not know, grain is an literally part of the physical composition of silver nitrate. Director's chose film stock based on how much grain they wanted their artistic vision to have. Grain=Detail not the opposite. To remove grain no matter how carefully always removes fine detail. So much detail is in this Blu-ray set you can even see the ripples and sheen of Rod Serling's herringbone suits in some of the intro's. That and the tiny lines on actors faces is detail to the MAX. Except for it being black and white, it is like they standing right in front of us. You don't get that when DNR is used, what you do get with DNR is a waxy unnatural look.

The folks at Image should also be proud for giving us unaltered, uncompressed sound as an option. For those of us who despise unnatural processed modern digital sound and this is a blessing of blessings. Coupled with the pristine video which totally unmarred thankfully due to no DNR this Blu-ray set is nearly as good as a pristine 35MM print. This set showcases Mr Serling's genius rather than try to conceal it in a shoddy revisionist modern manner. This and all the Zone sets are true reference quality.

To the people at Image please produce all your Blu-Ray using the same level of quality and professional effort as your Zone sets!!!!!

Many company's could learn valuable lessons on proper Blu-Ray mastering from the people at Image who worked on these zone sets.",1305676800,12,1546,4.614545454545454

2203777,5,B000777IJ2,"The Twilight Zone is my favorite show, even though I was born several years after the show ended. As a child, my mother used to sit me in front of the television to keep me occupied. (Nintendo/Playstation/XBOX/Computers/Etc.) had not even been thought of yet for the family home. I was hooked immediatly! Ever year I can't wait for 4th of July weekend because the SciFi Network shows a 24 hour a day marathon for the whole weekend. I found myself loosing sleep just to catch the episodes that fascinated me growing up. This past year (2010) SciFi Network decided NOT to show the marathon during the 4th of July weekend and waited until New Years weekend. Since I'm a huge college football fan, I missed over half of the shows due to schedule conflict with the games.
  Since I already had Season 1 of The Twilight Zone - Definitive Edition, I decided to order the rest of the series. I was not about to let what happened last year happen again! So now I can have my own marathon anytime I please!
If you are a HUGE fan of old SciFi Thrillers... this series is for you! At the price they are selling for, it is a steal! Without a doubt, Mr. Serling paved the way for several other outstanding programs of the same nature (Kolchak: The Night Stalker/X-Files/Fringe) and of course Mr. Serlings second series (Night Gallery) just to name a few. I have found that if you have a Blu-Ray player with at least a 120hz LED television, the video quality from the DVD editions is outstanding!

The blu ray transfer quality of the second season is absolutely stunning I thought Image did a fantastic job with the first season but this second season has blown me away the video quality is so sharp, clear and absent of grain I cant believe my eyes! ( i guess it must have something to do with the condition of the original source material as the 1st season had quite a bit of grain). Even the 6 episodes shot in video look damn good considering.

2203786,5,B000777IJ2,"Rod Serling doesn't disappoint in this fantastic series from the early sixties.  Not gonna list all the episodes for times sake but I'll just mention a handful such as the ""Howling Man"" about a man coming face to face with a captured devil in an old castle, ""The Eye of the Beholder"" episode about the concept of beauty in an upside down reality and ""The Obsolete Man"" starring Burgess Meredith as a librarian classified as obsolete by a futuristic socialist state.  I can name more but you get the idea.  It's great for the entire family but some of the stories may be a little spooky for little kids.  Nontheless, relive your favorite episodes from this great series and this collection is just one of many to buy.  Enjoy!!",1279929600,,725,4.589147286821706
2203787,5,B000777IJ2,"After finishing its freshman year on CBS as a somewhat low-rated TV series, ""The Twilight Zone"" started its second year in September, 1960 beset with a major problem: CBS president James Aubrey didn't like the show and attempted to destroy it before it had a chance to build an audience. His first attempt at ruining this classic series was to slash its budget because he stated the series was too expensive to produce with the kind of Nielsen numbers it was bringing in. As a result six episodes that year were shot on cheap videotape, not film, and the result is obvious. Also, the number of episodes made went from 36 in the first year to 29 in season 2. Still, thanks to excellent writing by Rod Serling and his so-writers, and the dedication of its ardent fans ""The Twilight Zone: Season 2"" is regarded as one of the series' best seasons.
 In this splendid set all 29 shows are included and features an array of some of Hollywood's biggest stars including Agnes Moorehead, William Shatner, Donna Douglas, Jack Carson, and Dennis Weaver.
 The shows themselves look impeccable being cleaned from their original studio masters. The episodes are full frame which is how they were originally shown in the early sixties. Bonuses include interviews with actors who guest-starred on some of these shows as well as audio commentary by stars such as Dennis Weaver.

2203789,5,B000777IJ2,The DVD was a gift for my 8 year old grandaughter who watched Twilight Zone with me when I was visiting. She became fascinated by the stories. She loved the DVD and makes her Mom and sister watch several episodes at a time with her.,1259712000,,232,4.177777777777778
2203790,5,B000777IJ2,"Very few shows have left a legacy behind them as the Twilight Zone. It was the second series, in my opinion, when the show really came into its own. Many classic episodes are included here- and watching them again was like visiting with old friends...And if anything they seem even better with the passing of years.",1243382400,,315,4.642857142857143
2203791,4,B000777IJ2,"The presentation of the second season sees the series begin to mature and feel more confident in the style of stories and execution to present.

So much has been said about this series, I can hardly add anything new. I saw these in ""first run"" as a kid and I still love them, though I really have to be in the right frame of mind to watch them.",1227052800,,344,4.0588235294117645
2203792,5,B000777IJ2,"Even if you have the series on VHS or previous DVD releases, the picture and sound quality is SUPERB. The transfers are perfect. The extras make it worth the purchase. It even contains a disc with one classic TZ comic book from the 1960s and 1970s in PDF format so you can read a classic issue on your computer.

One small note: I definately agree with other reviewers. THE TWILIGHT ZONE: UNLOCKING THE DOOR TO A TELEVISION CLASSIC by Martin Grams is 800 plus pages includes ""everything"" about the classic series and is a wonderful companion with the DVDs. The book details Serling's writing career on radio, early television and Twilight Zone is well researched and highly detailed. Exclusive interviews with cast and crew and behind-the-scenes trivia will floor you. What you do is watch an episode and then read up on it in the book and you'll discover a wealth of trivia that makes this worthy of appreciation. Both the DVD set and the book is on Amazon.com. Do yourself the favor and get both. You'll thank me for it.",1226016000,,1022,4.6464088397790055
2203793,5,B000777IJ2,"I spent over $800 on the VHS videos from Columbia House two decades ago. I spent less than $140 for the complete DVD set and discovered more treasures, rare filmed interviews, bonus extras and high-quality transfers that are far superior to what I have been watching the past 20 years.

The retail price keep lowering over the months but by now it's beyond affordable. I recommend you grab this season box set today. While the Mike Wallace interview clip has been released commercially previous, the Jack Benny clip is very funny.

I also suggest you buy ""The Twilight Zone: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic"" because the 800 plus page book is a P-E-R-F-E-C-T companion to the DVD box set. Before or after you watch an episode, you can use the book to uncover the in-jokes, bloopers and trivia that make viewing these episodes fun. Watching the shows is one thing, knowing the behind-the-scenes stuff is even more fun. Both are available on Amazon.",1222128000,,957,4.793939393939394
2203794,5,B000777IJ2,"I've been fascinated by The Twilight Zone series since I was about 7 years old.  I'm 41 now.  Starting last year, I bit the bullet and decided to start getting the series on DVD.  Just purchased Season 2 and while there are great episodes in each season, I have to say that a heavy concentration of my favorites are here.  ""Shadow Play"" and ""The Obsolete Man"" are among the best works ever made for TV in my view.  However, even the ""lame"" episodes in this season are fun to watch.

This is a must for any Twilight Zone fan.  And if you don't know the show, this season is perhaps the best one to start with.

My only complaint -- and this is just a manufacturing defect, is that there were two ""Disc 4's"" in my set.  Fortunately, it was just a mislabeling.  The ""other"" disc 4 was actually disc 5, so everything was fine.  I just had to write a 5 on the mislabeled disc and I'm good to go.

Thanks to all of the talented writers, directors, actors, composers, camera operators and all of the others responsible for making Twilight Zone a timeless and enjoyable piece of art.",1178928000,,1075,4.32
2203795,3,B000777IJ2,"I have found for whatever reason, the quality of the DVDs for this season are not as good as the other seasons. I have all 5 seasons on DVD, and only season 2 seems to have jumping horizontal lines and occasional wash out of picture in at least 4-5 different episodes. This is peculiar since I also have all episodes on VHS tape as well, and NO episodes have this tracking issue on VHS. I bought the DVDs in hope of replacing the VHS copies, but the VHS copies of season 2 are visibly much better quality than the DVD. It seems in the transference of the episodes for this season onto DVD was poorly done. I have noted this on not one, not two, but three different versions of the season 2 collection. They all seem to happen in the same episodes as well. One episode in particular that I have found one of the worst is ""The Lateness of the Hour"", which incidently happens to be one of my favorite episodes. It also doesn't seem to be isolated to one disk, I have witnessed it on at least one episode on each disk. Has anyone else come across this in season 2?  I'm wondering if all season 2 collections are hosed or if I have come across a streak of bad copies.",1176163200,7,1162,4.1875
2203796,5,B000777IJ2,I received this DVD set for Christmas and I really liked it. I enjoyed so many of the episodes on this set. I enjoyed the first season too but I enjoyed some of these even more. A lot of great actors and stories in this season. ANOTHER GREAT SERIES OF TWILIGHT ZONE. SIMPLY THE BEST. A RECOMMENDATION to ANY TWILIGHT ZONE FAN.

2203800,5,B000777IJ2,"I was born in 67, and grew up in Wales. I saw the Twilight Zone occassionally on net work TV, initially in the early 1980's. For what ever reason it was not shown very often, (Cable and satelite was not avauilable until the 90's in the UK). I recal as an eleven year old watching an eposode which was subtle, atmospheric, obsorbing and very original. So.....I bought season 1,2, 3..., They are all very watchable, some better than others, and I recommend them (All). The 60's, the black and white film, and the acting are the hue that make this series so unique. The storylines are subtle and will not always blow you away, but that does not matter. The acting, direction and atmosphere make upfor it. I recommend season 1,2 and 3. I,m sure the other seasons are just as good, although this is some criticism by pendants. Go for it, easy weekend or late night viewing.",1152921600,3,868,4.5
2203801,5,B000777IJ2,"It is a dream come true to have these original Twilight Zone Episodes.  I bought all 5 seasons.  Now, rather than wait for TV to show my favorite episodes, I can see them whenever I want. These are absolutely terrific.  I strongly recommend buying all 5 seasons.",1141430400,8,262,4.531914893617022

Fantastic stories and I am sure you will one or more that you will never forget.  I used to wait for the marathons on television for this show, now finally I can watch them anytime.  This stories are still very interesting in this day an era, and all have a moral to them and discuss human issues and fears.  The quality is great.  It is also fascinating to see all the stars that appear in this story.  Actors who later went on to become household names.",1518134400,,570,4.271028037383178
8045354,5,B000777IJ2,"My review is of ""The Twilight Zone: Season 2: The Definitive Edition"" on DVD. If it is mixed with reviews of other editions, that is due to a long-occurring glitch with Amazon.

Season 2 contains 29 half-hour episodes. 23 of these were shot on film, and six were shot on (early) videotape as a means of cutting costs when the series ran over budget. The 23 filmed episodes look and sound better than ever. The six videotaped episodes have some minor but noticeable flaws in the picture, with small static specks and a few moments of distortion. However, if you can overlook this, the videotaped episodes are still completely watchable; and the writing, acting and direction is first-rate, as usual for this series.

""The Twilight Zone"" did various types of stories, ranging from spine-tingling horror to science fiction to light comedic fantasy. There were no recurring characters; each episode was completely self-contained. The only common threads were: each episode was introduced by Rod Serling; each episode depicted some sort of strange and bizarre occurrence; and each episode was written, directed and performed with tremendous talent and dedication to achieving a high level of quality. (In addition to hosting, Rod Serling also wrote about two-thirds of the episodes!)

I highly recommend the ""Definitive Edition"" over the ""Episodes Only"" edition due to numerous terrific bonus features! As with Volume 1, several episodes have optional voice-over commentaries by actors who appeared in the episodes, all of whom have wonderful memories of working on this program. Rod Serling was not only a first-rate writer; by all accounts he was also a first-rate human being, who brought out the best in everyone around him.

Other bonus features include audio recordings of interviews with various writers, directors and actors by Mark Scott Zicree (author of ""The Twilight Zone Companion""), who share interesting recollections of making specific episodes. There is also a complete kinescoped interview with Rod Serling by Mike Wallace from 1959. Rod Serling was established as an acclaimed writer of sophisticated hour-long TV dramas, and explains his plans to launch a new half-hour anthology series to be called ""The Twilight Zone"". Also, as with Volume 1, a handful of ""Twilight Zone"" radio dramas (adapted from classic ""Twilight Zone"" episodes from four decades earlier) are included, on the same discs as the original TV episodes on which they were based.

In my humble opinion, there are no bad episodes; every one of them is worthwhile. However, my personal favorites from this season include:
""Nervous Man in a Four-Dollar Room""
""Eye of the Beholder""
""Dust""
""The Invaders""
""Twenty-Two"" (To this day, I always associate the number 22 with this episode!)

If you are considering buying the set described in my review, please remember this review is of ""The Definitive Edition"", although it will probably also appear with other editions.",1515715200,,2943,5.22457627118644
