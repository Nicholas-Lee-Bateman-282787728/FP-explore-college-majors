4529695,5,B0052ADP6Y,"Everybody who is directly or indirectly confronted with the difficulties to overcome the tragedy and misery of Addiction should watch this DVD. As a relative or a friend of an addict it is so important to try understanding the dynamics of Addiction. For the addict himself it is difficult to break the vicious cycle and to live a sober and full filling life - however with the respect, love and care for ourselves as addicts there are ways and means to become and to stay sober. This DVD may help in that process.",1435968000,,513,4.526881720430108
4529696,5,B0052ADP6Y,Great video!,1432512000,,12,5.5
4529697,5,B0052ADP6Y,"This is great. The presentation of different addict's and their struggle to get and remain clean depicts the true nature of addiction. I love the use of the Drug Court and what an incredible Judge!  rgles of and insidious nature addiction, but presents a ray of hope that no one is beyond help, no matter how long it may take. 2nd and 3rd chances are sometimes needed for an addict to understand the nature of addiction  and grab hold of recovery.

The DVD was shipped quickly and packaged well with another DVD, ""Unguarded"". I am very happy with my  purchase  of both recovery films. Great Job! I would purchase again from the sellers.  Thank you!",1426636800,3,648,4.591304347826087

4529700,5,B0052ADP6Y,This movie was very motivational to my clients.  Great to watch and scary at the same time.  It COULD happen to you.,1383091200,6,116,4.2272727272727275
4529701,5,B0052ADP6Y,"There have been many films about drug addiction, what makes The Last Fix exceptional is that the filmmakers gained the trust of the recovering addicts to such a degree. This shows that time was spent getting to know them and the drug court model and philosophy. In other words the filmmakers didn't parachute in, turn on the camera and then leave so they also gained the trust of the drug court team members . And they showed the East End Regional Treatment Court in the context of the national Drug court movement and weaved in the footage of NADCP  , the drug corts' national convention artfully.
This film is a combination of the art of documentary filmmaking ( great editing) and heart. Heart and art makes 5 stars.",1336348800,12,719,4.6171875
4529702,5,B0052ADP6Y,A must-see film especially today with drug-related deaths on the rise.,1302048000,,70,5.454545454545454

8453670,4,B0052ADP6Y,great teaching tool for AOD education class,1489708800,,43,5.285714285714286
8453671,1,B0052ADP6Y,"I was looking for a good documentary about addiction and recovery. Although this documentary was inspiring, as to the recovery of the addicts depicted, the details about the program that they were to have completed were not described in detail. It was a great commercial for the ""drug court"" method of recovery but there was little substance to the film. The price of this documentary was high compared to other films and disappointing in content.",1477353600,,447,4.973333333333334
8453672,3,B0052ADP6Y,"Disappointed. The pic on the cover suggested one individual's ""Passage from Hell to Hope."" Instead, this is a review of drug courts on Long Island. While adult drug courts are commendable, a better title would have been ""Why Your Town Needs a Drug Court and How to Do It."" If you are a judge, politician, probation officer this video cold be pure gold. Otherwise, save your hard-earned $.",1476403200,,388,4.720588235294118

8453676,5,B0052ADP6Y,"As a social worker, I show this video to some of my clients and the message of Drug Court is received in a positive manner.",1456185600,,123,3.96
