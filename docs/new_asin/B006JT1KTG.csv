8499805,5,B006JT1KTG,"This adorable play tells the story of a young man who grows up to be a successful but tormented artist/chef/father/entrepreneur.  The tunes are addictive and you will find yourself singing along to some of your favorite classical tunes after a couple of viewings.  I was lucky to see this in person and hope some day the MWPV school will put it on again.  All the songs are derived from classical music and opera.  The lyrics are simply genius.  This is a story of love, hope and the courage to pursue a dream - performed by middle school students with no formal training - this play could serve as an excellent instruction-based project for any middle or high school drama department.",1337558400,2,685,4.675
