8196494,5,B000QH6Z6A,"Young, beautiful Greta Franklin (Barbara Bouchet- DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING, THE FRENCH SEX MURDERS) takes a secretarial job for an author named Richard Stuart (Farley Granger- STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, ROPE, THE PROWLER). Greta is actually trying to find out what happened to a friend of hers named Sally. Sally also worked for Stuart, and came to a grisly end. Rosalba Neri (LADY FRANKENSTEIN, THE FRENCH SEX MURDERS, THE DEVIL'S WEDDING NIGHT, 99 WOMEN) co-stars as Stuart's wife and personal assistant, Eleanora.  AMUCK is a wonderful example of an early 70s euro-thriller / mystery film, complete w/ naked, slow-motion gal / gal love scenes (yep, Ms. Bouchet and Ms. Neri)! Ah, the Europeans! Always decades ahead of the curve! Sheer magic! My goodness, there's a lot of frolicking in this movie! We do eventually get back to the whole finding-out-what-happened-to-the-lost-friend thing. Eventually...",1402099200,,901,5.345070422535211
8196495,4,B000QH6Z6A,"I am not sure why a company has not remastered this film. Really an amazing giallo. The leading ladies are great...Bouchet especially. But also, it is filled with red herrings and interesting characters. I give it four stars only because it isn't in a good quality format just yet.",1336089600,,281,4.755102040816326
8196496,4,B000QH6Z6A,"The title of this review says it all. Rosalba Neri and Barbara Bouchet star in this 70's Italian thriller which isn't great, but good enough if you're into this sort of thing. This movie is not a gory giallo at all, so don't buy this movie with that expectation. If you're a fan of either or both of the two leading ladies, you will not be disappointed.

The DVD itself is nothing to rave about, so don't pay too much for it. I've seen it listed for $80!! I paid less than $20 for mine. This ""Limited Edition"" DVD is full screen and from a somewhat dirty (but passable) print, so the DVD tech spec police should probably avoid it (this aint Criterion/Anchor Bay). That being said, it does have some interesting special features including an interview with Rosalba Neri and a ""revealing"" photo gallery.

In short; the movie itself is great for fans of either leading ladie. The DVD package as a whole is sub-par for those of us used to the Criterion treatment, but does have some nice extras. This edition is most definitely not worth anywhere near $80, but if you are a 70s Italian cult-film nut and/or Rosalba Neri/Barbara Bouchet fan, it's worth paying around $20 for.",1254700800,8,1170,4.540284360189573
8196497,3,B000QH6Z6A,"The film for myself is great, being a Barbara Bouchet fan, however this DVD is merely a Vhs copy . Not worth the sticker shock. If that's the case, avoid it until they remaster this very, very good movie.",1218758400,6,204,4.256410256410256
8196498,4,B000QH6Z6A,"After searching, I found this film. It was recommended by a friend. I was NOT disappointed. I loved it!!!! It has eroticism in a totally sadistic manner!!! A true Giallo gem!!!!",1205193600,2,177,4.741935483870968
