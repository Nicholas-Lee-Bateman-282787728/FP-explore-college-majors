7911852,2,B00000J315,Personally I think this was not the best investment of my taichi education funds. Sitting on the grass on a sunny day at Taichi Farm this stuff is fun to watch. But for videos I find a recording of a master's form to be much more valuable to watch over and over and absorb their spirit and technique. A video that is all Dr. Yang or Master Liang or people of their calibre is a much better investment.,1128038400,,401,4.153846153846154

It begins with an introduction to Tai-chi with Bob Klein, explaining forms, push hands and self defense principles.  Then we see beautiful demonstrations of Tai-chi, showing incredible variety of movements and exercises.

Demonstrations include Yang, Chen, Sun, Guang Ping and Hao forms, Two person forms, Liu Ho Ba Fa Quan, Pakua Chang, Tai-chi Tiger Form, sword, sabre, fan and stick forms, sword sparring, self defense applications of forms, push hands and even the lion dance.

Demonstrations by Jou, Tsung Hwa - Yang, Jwing Ming - Jiang, Jianye - Pat Rice - Jay Dunbar - John Painter - Bob Klein - Jean Goulet and many more.

This program can be used to learn about Tai-chi, its basic principles and to see what the various exercises should look like when practiced properly.  With this knowledge you will be able to distinguish good teachers.  Many menu chapters make this DVD easy to use.

7911854,5,B00000J315,"This is a great idea for a video.  20 T'ai-chi teachers got together and demonstrated their forms, push hands, sword play, self defense applications and even a lion dance.  The video begins with an introduction to T'ai-chi  explaining what it is and the differences between the various exercises, as  well as self defense principles.  Then you see the teachers giving their  demonstrations.  As an example, for the Yang form, several teachers give  about a minute each of their form and each is blended into the next, so it  seems like a seamless form.  Yet you can see the variations in approach of  each teacher.  This is also true for the push hands, some more flowing,  some more aggressive.  A voice over explains what you are seeing and each  teacher's name appears as he or she is shown.  It is a fascinating video to  watch as the teachers are many of the most well known in the T'ai-chi  field.  It was taped at Jou Tsung-Hwa's T'ai-chi Farm in New York State.  (The farm is now gone, unfortunately, so this video is a sort of  collector's item).",961632000,31,1055,4.594594594594595
