2525471,5,B000EOTEKE,The students liked this video and paid attention and it created a great discussion on many aspects of the industrial revolution.,1361836800,2,128,5.142857142857143
2525472,5,B000EOTEKE,Brings history to life for middle and high school students as well as myself. It arrived in perfect condition and sooner than promised.,1259452800,,135,4.913043478260869
2525473,4,B000EOTEKE,"I used this video in my 9th grade World History class and although the animated sections are somewhat juvenile, the information is historically sound and illuminating.  It appears to be the only viable educational video on the Industrial Revolution out there.  I highly recommend it.",1237248000,2,283,5.266666666666667
2525474,3,B000EOTEKE,"Five minutes into ""Mill Times"" I was blown away, and ready to buy the entire set of David Macaulay's productions sight unseen.  (As of my writing there is also ""Pyramid,"" Castle,"" ""Cathedral,"" and ""Roman City."")

Then I finished it.

It's not that it's poorly done, no.  It is informative, and information is what I was looking for.  I bought it chiefly because I was looking for a video about the origins of Industrial Revolution and, more specifically, what the heck was a mill and what did they do there?

Well, I certainly got that answered.  The first five or ten minutes about the process of turning wool into cloth was extremely useful, and helped answer several questions that had been lingering in my mind, chiefly owing to reading so much 17th- and 18th-century literature.

But I was surprised to see that large chunks of this film -- even most of it -- were animated.  I don't mean illustrative computer animation of buildings and machines, but an old-fashioned animated story complete with characters and a plot.  I wasn't expecting this.

The animation was, I admit, well done, not boring, and managed to breathe life into the abandoned mills you see about New England, but it was also jarring and not entirely relevant.

I was expecting more of a straightforward, live-action documentary about the history of mills and the details of their operation.  There was some of that, sure; but the bulk of this production turned out to be almost an animated soap opera focusing on the romantic and financial problems of fictional personages.",1212796800,21,1548,4.862595419847328
2525475,5,B000EOTEKE,"David Macaulay hosts another romp through history in his PBS special called Mill Times. Like Roman City, Pyramid, Cathedral, and Castle, Macaulay uses animation and video to show how people interacted with the buildings and machinery of past ages. Macaulay presents many of his specials through the eyes of people such as leaders, workers, and politicians. This makes these specials a perfect avenue of understanding the social sciences. Viewers will learn how wool, yarn, fabric, rivers, factories, and steam power shaped mill times. Footage of restored working mills help explain how past people crafted textiles. It is interesting to learn how mills came from England to America and impacted the people of the modern times. Macaulay presents vivid, factual, and concise information about the history of mills that will benefit people of any age. This special truly coveys how mills have shaped where and how people live today. I plan to show this DVD when teaching American industrialization and the rise of cities.

These are some questions that a viewer can easily answer as he or she views this DVD:

1. What was the most common material that people in New England once used to make clothing? wool
2. A loom is used to create fabric or cloth.
3. What was the energy source that once powered early mills? water
4. What was the name of the fictional mill that Josiah Greshan and Shaddrack built? Huntington Mill
5. An early mill could spin the same amount of material as how many people? 50 people
6. How did mill owners access river energy? Owners built dams
7. In what year did Samuel Slater build the first American mill? 1789
8. The factory system began employing hundreds of workers.
9. In what city of Massachusetts did Lowell build his famous textile mill? Lowell
10. What did Lowell do to attract farm girls to work in his factories? Lowell offered good paying jobs and ensured that girls would not drink alcohol and would go to church. He also housed the girls in boarding houses and fed them very well.
11. What day of the week did Lowell girls get off? Sunday
12. What did some factory workers begin doing when unsafe working conditions, low wages, and long hours became unbearable? They formed unions or went on strike.
13. What name did Slater give to the mill he built in 1806? Slatersville
14. What was the new source of energy that made it possible to run a machine anytime and anyplace? Steam
15. Why did many New England mills begin moving south? Steam replaced the necessity of river power, cotton was close by, and labor was cheaper.

Mill Times is an excellent DVD special that will give people of all ages new insight in the development of the textile industry and how it impacts the modern world.",1176336000,40,2723,4.752642706131078
2525476,5,B000EOTEKE,"I have always enjoyed David Macaulay's work.  As a child I was captivated by ""Castle"" and later grew to appreciate ""Pyrimid"" and ""Cathedral"".  I currently teach 8th grade US history and ""Mill Life"" has become a central part of my lessons on the industrial revolution.  The film, with Macaulay's unique blend of animation and on-the-spot dicussion, helps show the technological, and social issues involved with 18th and 19th century textile mills.  This is a must for teachers who focus on this time period and highly recommmended for anyone who wants to be entertained and learn something at the same time.",1156377600,13,606,5.03

8112113,5,B000EOTEKE,Great video.  My children are learning about the Industrial Revolution.  They really enjoyed this.,1480204800,,98,5.928571428571429

8112115,5,B000EOTEKE,"Although some people do not like part of the movie being a carton, I think if breaks up the movie and makes it more entertaining for elementary students. I think the movie is well worth it for my classroom when teaching weaving.",1458864000,,228,4.4523809523809526
8112116,4,B000EOTEKE,"Mill Times is probably the last PBS special that combines hand drawn animation with live acton and David MaCaulay's narration. While the special gains points in it's educational aspects it also has a visual clashing in it's 3Danimation backround techniques and it's 2D hand drawn animation! Computer graphics are used in a 3D way to depict the mill machinery and the 2D hand drawnanimated characters is combined with it! In  ROMAN CITY in 1994 a hand drawn ship is colored in in 2D with the ocean and they combine well with the hand drawn computer coloured characters that are also coloured in 2D. By 2001 in MILL TIMES the 3D ship with computer generated water is less pleasing to the eye and has a jarring effect.

Still the hand drawn animated characters work well, even though the over all effect is jarring and less consistent then the previous specials. MILL TIMES is the most ""high tech"" in treatment of all of Macaulay's specials. The earlier specials were more consistent  in their use of hand drawn 2d animation! This has become a problem in combining 3D graphics with 2D characaters! But if you are looking at the educational aspects of the film then it delivers and the 3D graphics do illustrate the mill machinery well. That is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars!",1445040000,,1272,4.644444444444445
8112117,4,B000EOTEKE,"I love water power industrial mills (though glad I never have had to work in one).  There is a major Mill museum about 30 minutes from my house (Hagley Museum, Wilmington De).  I have toured Lowell, Mass and have been to other sites of early water powered industry both in the United States and Canada.  Given this interest I was primed to love this DVD and did.  It was nicely presented.  The presentation was logical; the narration was clear and easy to follow.  The animations helped one understand how Mills worked.  In addition to sections on the mechanics of Mills a significant portion of the DVD was devoted to the economic and social changes that resulted as a consequence of this industrialization.",1436572800,,708,4.754098360655738
8112118,4,B000EOTEKE,I Showed it to my eighth grade U.S. history class and they got a lot of information out of it.,1401148800,,94,3.75
8112119,5,B000EOTEKE,"This is a great film to show in the classroom. I am a world history teacher and I have showed this film for my Industrial Revolution unit and students have found it entertaining and informational. Hosted by David Macaulay, it is a great film that depicts the development of mills during as forerunners of the industrial revolution. The documentary shows real machinery from the times, including water-powered mills, inventions like John Kay's flying shuttle and Richard Arkwright's water frame.

The film also has cartoon animation following the story of an inventor and entrepeneur from the UK who travels to the U.S. to seek his inventions. The cartoon animation increases the attention span of students so that they are not always listening to Macaulay's voice.

I strongly recommend this film for history teachers. I showed it in the middle of the week, after I had frontloaded the Industrial Revolution through a guided reading, and then followed that by a lecture of the Industrial Revolution with the invetions the next day. The third day I showed the film, and by then the students had background information on what Macaulay is narrating about.

Excellent choice!",1381276800,,1172,5.09375
8112120,5,B000EOTEKE,I have used this documentary in teaching a US History 1 class for 5 years. It is accessible and visually appealing.  I think this is a great resource for teaching the industrial revolution.,1365552000,2,189,4.7272727272727275
8112121,5,B000EOTEKE,"Students need to SEE the Industrial Revolution, not just read about it. This is a great resource for showing them mills, water wheels, steam engines, some of the hazards of industrialization, the key people involved, etc. And for any fans of the 'Liberty Kids' series, there is a fictional LK-ish cartoon woven into the documentary portions to highlight the arrival in the states of machinery and the impact on early America. And for any frustrated instructors who wish classroom documentaries were less boring, Macaulay speaks clearly, at the right pace, not too fast, and not too much ... and with just the right amount of humor. My students LOVED it!",1364083200,5,653,4.945454545454545
