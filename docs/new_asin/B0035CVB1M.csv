4070169,5,B0035CVB1M,"Bobby is a legend of comedy. After all the times I've seen him at the Improv, I CAN'T WAIT to see his new special. He is the man. He says what's on his mind with no filter and what's on his mind is priceless. Check some of his videos out on his youtube channel, he has some clips of his special!",1267056000,,295,3.8524590163934427

I've been watching the previews on his YouTube [...] and I CAN'T WAIT to see the special next week! Already pre-ordered a copy of the DVD, too!",1266796800,,270,4.42

8388851,2,B0035CVB1M,"Bobby Slayton has tons of experience in comedy, ho knows how to work a crowd. His performance is all fine and dandy, but his jokes are the problem. I found them stale and building on really outdated clichees. Men cannot communicate, Women talk and shop too much. All men want is sex and a sandwich. If this amuses you, go for it. But if you look for witty observations and clever against-the-grain thoughts, stay away from this DVD. You'll watch the first 30 minutes and then notice that you haven't even smiled once.
I mean he opens with a routine on waiting in the airline security line and what he thinks of the old Asian couple he encounters. He then goes on to say that he doesn't know ""if they were Japanese, Chinese or just tired."" You expect Krusty the Clown to come out with buckteeth any minute.",1423612800,2,805,4.445945945945946
8388852,5,B0035CVB1M,Amazingly funny -- if you can take the PC violations. (And you should!),1410134400,,71,4.538461538461538
8388853,5,B0035CVB1M,"This CD is over an hour of gut wrenching laughter. I love comedy and a lot of it is very good. However, Bobby Slayton is non stop laughter.",1392681600,,139,4.0
8388854,5,B0035CVB1M,"I originally saw this aired on one of the comedy channels late at night and decided I just had to own it. The Pitbull of comedy is a riot. Everyone I've showed this too has a reaction, be it good or bad, but no one has left before the end of the show.",1302825600,,251,3.7547169811320753
8388855,5,B0035CVB1M,"great show, love this guy..
