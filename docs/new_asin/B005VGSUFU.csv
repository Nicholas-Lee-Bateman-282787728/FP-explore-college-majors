4897297,1,B005VGSUFU,"I ordered the DVD assuming that the ""virtual haunted house"" would provide background ambiance to highlight my Halloween decorations.  I assumed the ""virtual haunted house"" would be just that...a trip through a haunted house.  It was nothing more than snippets of bad movies, mostly in black and white.  ...and if I wasn't disappointed enough, the DVD wouldn't even continue to play towards the end.  I ended up making a coaster out of it.  Very disappointed!",1349740800,2,458,5.053333333333334
4897298,3,B005VGSUFU,"This is great, but I thought it was a video about how to make a haunted house. It's clips from scary movie's though. I misread the info :(",1346889600,2,138,3.9642857142857144

8487462,3,B005VGSUFU,"I was going to play this movie as background for my tween Haunted House party. It was a little too thriller-like (I think for their age), so I went with a YouTube Halloween Skeleton Hollogram video instead. This movie had very short clips from movies in the 70's and 80's like Creature Double Feature. Lots of screaming by woman and was oddly edited. I think it would be a great addition for an adult party.",1413936000,,407,4.44
8487463,1,B005VGSUFU,"I thought this would be sounds for haunted houses, but instead it was old Halloween music.  I was disappointed! :(",1386547200,,114,4.7
8487464,5,B005VGSUFU,I wasn't really expecting this but it's something different. The many old scary movies they depict on the app is wonderful. It's not really scary but nice once hooked up yo your t.v.,1380412800,,182,4.545454545454546
8487465,5,B005VGSUFU,I have seen a lot of bad reviews about this DVD. If these people would have looked up the title on you tube they would have gotten a sampling of the DVD. I had it going on a laptop as I gave out candy and everyone loved it!!,1372204800,4,224,3.6875

8487467,5,B005VGSUFU,"I ordered this to play silently in the background of a tween Halloween party.  It was PERFECT!  Almost exactly what I wanted!  This is a ""video"" of old horror movie clips.  Most are black and white.  Both my kids (ages 14 and 11) were mesmerized when we played it before the party to make sure it was appropriate.  They had never seen anything like these clips.  Of course, they  made comments such as ""Blue Screen,"" or ""He's a terrible actor,"" but overall they were fascinated.  At the party, we played this in the background, over and over.  For the most part, the kids didn't really pay attention, but towards the end, when they were playing ""Truth or Dare"" they looked up an watched it.  They were mesmerized too.  Highly recommend.  Can't figure out why others have given this low reviews.",1352505600,5,794,4.585714285714285
