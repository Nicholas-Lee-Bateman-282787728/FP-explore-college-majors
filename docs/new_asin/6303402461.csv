642149,2,6303402461,Was hoping for more authenticity in narration. It seems that the tone of Ishi's voice conveys more truth. The sound track leaves room for improvement in narration.,1354665600,,163,5.074074074074074
642150,5,6303402461,"The film covers the experiences of Anthropologist Kroeber in his relationship to Ishi.  It is a very moving film, and an excellent documentary.  It covers not only the history of Ishi but also what happened to his people, who were driven into almost total extinction.  I highly recommend for an Anthropology class.",1347235200,3,314,5.0

642153,5,6303402461,Ishi's story is one of the most remarkable and unforgettable personal stories in history. The documentary is fascinating and deeply moving. Also highly recommended is the book Ishi in Two Worlds by Theodora Kroeber.,1306800000,,215,5.352941176470588
642154,5,6303402461,"A beautiful documentary based on the true and incredibly sad story of the last ""wild"" Indian in North America. Ishi was a wise, gentle soul, and his story is heart-breaking.",1230422400,5,173,4.8
642155,4,6303402461,"This is a wonderful documentary, narrated by Linda Hunt. I, having read 'Ishi in Two Worlds: A Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America' by Theodora Kroeber (1897 - 1979), was greatly impressed by it. It perfectly captures this remarkable man, of such courage, kindness, talent, and greatness of simplicity, who died long before he should have, at a time, just, when the necessary work could be done on someone like him, where racism, ignorance, and intolerance, truly, began to have enemies. The film is scattered with audio of the many early audio recordings Ishi singing and telling stories - I sure hope that the tape that they were transfered onto, in 1957, has had deservingly, lovingly-digitally remastered copies made of it, so that all may hear the voice of this great man, from so long ago.

One thing that struck me, since I saw the opening portion on YouTube, is that it is filmed on film that looks as though it is from the late '70's, not 1992. Despite this, it is a fantastic film, that is a great source for any Ishi enthusiast, or humanities teacher. I sometimes say to myself, when I am sad, or when someone I care about leaves, Ishi's good-bye, which is the final line of his biography by Theodora Kroeber - 'You stay. I go.'",1224201600,7,1254,4.598214285714286
642156,5,6303402461,"I mostly use this film in teaching introductory anthropology because it does several things well.  First, it provides comprehensive coverage of a story about an individual who lived through some of the horrible things that happened to California natives.  That works well at putting a human face on historic events.  In addition, it does a good job of weaving in the story of the early days of anthropology in this country through Ishi's relationship with Alfred Kroeber.  Along the way, implicit questions are raised about the sorts of ethical dilemmas faced by Kroeber.  Finally, the historic photographs and recordings are well utilized.  Visually, the film is well made and elicits sympathy for Ishi while also documenting his resilience and strength of character.  That makes him a real three-dimensional being, as opposed to a mere stereotypical victim.  One comes away with a real appreciation for who he was, in all his complexity.",1177977600,27,939,5.172185430463577
642267,4,6303402461,"It was very informative, but not what I expected.  It is a documentary told by a narrator.",1461542400,,90,4.294117647058823
642268,5,6303402461,"It was hard hearing about the massacres the whites committed against the Yahi people. How could someone be so savage yet call these people savage just because they didn't live by their pathetic standards!! Standards that cause people stress, illness or rendered thousands of people living on the streets homeless.

While I enjoyed the documentary, it was painful. What a dirty history America has and how evil of certain Americans to deem people inferior because of the color of their skin!",1460419200,2,490,5.049382716049383
642269,2,6303402461,I am Wintu and have many friends that are Yana. Now I am very sad for what the white people have done to us. Richard Burill has more information.

642272,4,6303402461,I wished it was longer. I know there simply isn't enough info to make it longer. I regret the fact that we destroyed so much culture before we ever knew the value and the fact that we didn't see ourselves in the people who were here when we showed up.

642275,5,6303402461,"A great film that had my attention from beginning to end.  So informative and so heart wrenching at the same time ... a story about a man with a history forgotten by all making his way in a new world.  What others saw in him was described in such a way that I could not stop watching and will I'm sure see this again.  I have seen the movie about this true story, The Last of His Tribe,  with Jon Voight and Graham Greene which I thought was great. This documentary was better. Highly recommend.",1444867200,,495,4.178947368421053

642395,5,6303402461,"This is a powerful documentary on the last Yahi, named Ishi who was discovered almost hundred years ago in California.  How the modern educated and civilized westerners mixed with him in speeding him up on the culture and customs.  This film showed that Ishi went back to his home base in search of the family spirits after many massacres.  He showed modern people how to make bow and arrows in his survival skills in making forks to catch fish on river and stream.

He was however the last known Yahi in Turtle Island.  This well made documentary gives a lesson on Native Americans and Anglo-American.",1374364800,,602,4.695238095238095

7846338,5,6303402461,"Ishi - the Last Yahi is not the only movie about Ishi, but it is by far the best. Ishi was the last survivor of a Northern California tribe that was slaughtered by Euro-American settlers in the late 19th and early 20th century. The story of how the Yahi were exterminated stands in for so many other stories; few white Americans realize just how brutal their ancestors - and our government - were. At the same time, Ishi is not merely a tragic figure. He surrendered himself in 1911, three years after the rest of his family were killed or died in hiding, and ultimately came under the protection of one of the ""fathers"" of American anthropology, Alfred Kroeber. He became a newspaper sensation, ""the last wild Indian,"" etc., but the film makes it clear that Ishi was strong and resilient, not merely a tragic figure; he adapted to his new life and ultimately taught those who saw him as an object of study much about their own humanity.  I wholeheartedly recommend this film.
