2468620,5,B000CPWDHQ,"When I first saw John Hillcoat's film The Proposition I was literally shocked and dumbstruck with what I had just witnessed. As a long-time aficionado of the horror genre I could say that part of me has become desensitized to onscreen violence and nothing really shocks me. Even though I've seen films with more violence throughout its running time, The Proposition just had a heavy sense of despair, moral ambiguity, and a Miltonian feel throughout. The film felt like how it would be if one accepted an offer from one of the damned to stroll down to the Nine Circles of Hell. As much as I didn't want to accept that offer the curiosity of what I might see won out. That's how I was able to sit through the entirety of Hillcoat's ultra-violent and nihilistic tale of lawless and amoral individuals in the untamed wilderness of 1880's Australian Outback.

I must agree with film critic Roger Ebert when he said The Proposition seemed to mirror another dark and violent tale. Hillcoat's film shares so much the same themes and tone as Cormac McCarthy's brutal novel, Blood Meridian, that one almost wondered if the film was adapted from McCarthy's great novel. But similarities aside, Hillcoat and Nick Cave's (director and writer respectively) film can clearly stand on its own two bloody legs.

The film begins with a bloody siege and shootout and we're soon introduced to two of the three Burns' brothers. We soon find out that both brothers, Charlie (played by Guy Pearce)and Mikey (played by Richard Wilson) are outlaws wanted for a multitude of heinous crimes with a recent one the senseless rape and murder of the Hopkins family. One Capt. Stanley (Ray Winstone) who acts as law in this particular area of the Outback. He's gives older brother Charlie a proposition. He'll spare the younger brother's life from the hangman's noose if Charlie finds their older brother Arthur (played with Kurtz-like menace by Danny Huston) and kills the outlaw leader. The quest is set as Charlie accepts and sets out to find his brother. Whether Charlie will go through with killing his older brother Arthur is one thing the audience won't find out until the final minutes of the film. Even though there's no love-lost between Charlie and Arthur, there's still the traditional bond of family that makes Charlie's quest a complex one.

We realize early on that Charlie is very protective of his simpler, younger brother Mikey and would do anything to save his life. Guy Pearce does a great performance as the conflicted and brooding Charlie Burns. There's a quiet intensity in Pearce's performance. He's pretty quiet through most of the film, but one could feel the palpable rage just roiling beneath his brooding countenance. Pearce's Charlie is one who is only a trigger away from exploding into outright violence. Charlie is definitely a child and creation of the lawless Outback the film is set in.

Arthur Burns on the other hand is introduced as an almost warrior-poet who would watch the sun set and spout poetry as easily as gun down an innocent or slice a man's throat without missing a beat. Danny Huston does a bravura performance as the charismatic and wholly amoral Arthur. His performance easily matches that of Pearce's scene for scene. Another performance that I must point out as being very strong in the film is Ray Winstone as Capt. Stanley, the Ahab of the tale with his obsession to bring civilization to the lawless Outback and to bring Arthur Burns to ultimate justice even if it means dealing with the lesser evil that is Charlie Burns.

The Proposition will be talked about alot for its unflinching look at violence onscreen. Though there's been films that have more violence per hour than Hillcoat's film, but the extreme brutality of the killings, maimings and rape in The Proposition has such an air of realism to it that one cringes at every gunshot wound and knife slashing. Like Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream, The Proposition's scenes of depravity makes one want to rush into the shower and cleanse off the dirt, grime and stink of the film. It's in this unflinching and realistic portrayal of death and violence that the film shares alot with McCarthy's Blood Meridian. The images are difficult to watch, but our curiosity makes us look through squinted eyes to see the full breadth of the violence. In time, just through the audiences acceptance of the oncreen violence do we soon become complicit in whats going on the screen.

It is a shame that The Proposition had such a limited release in the US. I think this film would've done as well as Eastwood's Unforgiven in giving the audience a different, darker side of the Old West mythology (though its really the Australian Old West). John Hillcoat has crafted himself a brutal and nihilistic film that's very hard to watch but also difficult to ignore. The Proposition is a film I highly recommened people see in the theaters before it disappears, but failing that they should search out for the dvd once its released in that medium. This film is that good.",1154390400,140,5033,4.826187717265354
2468621,3,B000CPWDHQ,"Australian outback western covers the genre's traditional story and gunplay well, while never being cliche, but by sundown, the stunning, blazing yellow and red cinematography, and Australian folk inspired music, by alternative rocker Nick Cave, who also wrote the screenplay, lingers fresher in the mind than the gritty bad guy vs. bad guy, earnest and crudely violent history lesson of Australia in the late 19th Century. It boasts concern for the inhumane treatment of the aborigines of Australia, who suffered a similiar history as that of African Americans in the U.S., with reminders via vintage historical photographs depicting an enslaved people, but the film is mostly indebted to Charly Burns, (Guy Pearce), a member of the notorious Burns brothers, who is given a 'proposition' by the local lawman, to ride out into the outback to kill his older brother, or his younger brother, held in the jailhouse, will be hung. A bit much to ask of him, and us, the audience, and while it tries to create a doom mongering cowboy mission full of mysticism and rocky plateau sunsets, it becomes less interesting, and less rewarding, the closer he gets to his objective, with little, if any moral conflict. It's glistening red, fresh kill violence, isn't nearly as objectionable as the lawman's wife character, who spends the entirety of the film dreading the thought of rape.",1150675200,,1372,5.075221238938053
2468622,4,B000CPWDHQ,"This film has often been compared to Eastwood's spare and dark UNFORGIVEN.  There are certainly many similarities in tone.  But if anything, there is even less redemption available at the end of this Australian western than at the end of that Oscar winner.

Simply put, Ray Winstone plays the equivalent of the ""new sheriff"" in a very small, dreary dusty ""western"" town in Australia.  The worst bandits in his area, the Burns brothers, are his primary goal, and when he corners and captures the two youngest brothers, Mickey and Charley (Guy Pearce), he offers Charley a proposition.  He and his simple younger brother will be released if Charley goes out and kills his psychopathic older brother Arthur.  If not, Mickey will be hung on Christmas Day, a few days away.

The fallout from this simple proposition is bleak, bleak, bleak.  The film is slow moving and takes time to establish tone and to let us savor the unbelievable Australian scenery.  As John Hurt (as a bounty hunter) says, it's the most horrific place he's ever been.  The scenery is beautiful (sunsets, colorful rocks) and brutal...long expanses of sand and scruff.  But the slow pace is punctuated with moments of extremely graphic violence.  Each bullet hole or knife wound (or spear wound) is painful to watch.  I'm not sure when I last saw a movie that made violence appear so unpleasant, so painful and so ugly.

Everyone in the film is great.  Guy Pearce...exceedingly grubby...is torn between deciding how to deal with one of his brothers inevitably dieing.  Ray Winstone gives a rich performance...just when we think we've got this guy figured out, he shows another layer.  And then another.  He wins our sympathy finally.  Emily Watson is his wife, and her performance is a litle colorless...it's the biggest weakness in the characterizations.  Not her fault...she's just too passive to be entirely believed.

The best performance comes from Danny Huston (John's son, Anjelica's brother) as Arthur, the psycho.  His character appreciates nature and poetry, but also raping and slow, painful murders.  He's a conundrum that's never fully explained...but Huston is riveting.  His oily, sweaty, dirty face is etched with emptiness...I know that sounds like an oxymoron, but trust me.

Other nice touches include an interesting soundtrack (co-written by Nick Cave, who wrote the script) and lots of stuff focusing on the uneasy melding of the ""white"" man and aboriginies.  This adds an extra layer of sadness, and of danger, to all the proceedings.

I would give the movie 4.5 stars, if I could.  It doesn't quite reach 5 (the pace is just occasionally over-indulgent...a couple of semi-important characters just drop from the story), but it's very compelling, very brutal filmmaking.  NOT FOR KIDS!!!",1149897600,58,2775,5.077433628318584
2468623,5,B000CPWDHQ,"Only if you were a Nick Cave fan before he immersed himself in writing fiction can you appreciate the film.  I hesitated seeing the movie because I did hear mixed-reviews, but I felt obligated as a Nick Cave fan.  The movie did not let me down in the least.  In fact, I think it ranks higher in caliber than many other movies I have seen this year--I find ""The Proposition"" to be quite undervalued.",1149724800,2,398,4.351351351351352
2468624,3,B000CPWDHQ,"Charlie Burns (Guy Pearce), a cowboy roaming the Australian outback in the early part of the 20th Century, and his younger brother, Mike (Richard Wilson) are captured at a whorehouse, after a bloody gunfight, by the new lawman in town, Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone). Charlie and his three brothers committed a particularly brutal murder of an innocent family. After that event, Charlie and Mike left their brother, taking off on their own. The Burns' Brothers became public enemy number one and the public demand their capture. Stanley makes Charlie a proposition; he will keep Mike in custody while Charlie goes out to hunt his older, more vicious brother Arthur (Danny Huston), the leader of the group. If Charlie kills Arthur, Stanley will let Mike go. Stanley comes home to his wife, Martha (Emily Watson), who tends the garden and attempts to make a proper home, a refuge for him in this godforsaken place.

""The Proposition"", written by Nick Cave and directed by John Hillcoat, is a good, very violent Western, similar to the films of Sam Peckinpah. The film depicts an era of Australia's history many of us are probably unfamiliar with and it does so in particularly grisly fashion.

Guy Pearce is a very good actor and it is always a pleasure to watch him. Well, almost always. In ""The Proposition"", he once again fully inhabits his character, a dusty, dirty, bloody, violent cowboy riding the Australian range. While this is great for the character, it is not so pleasant for the audience. Every time he and the other actors enter the screen, you can almost smell the stink rising off their bodies, they are dirty, sweaty, bloody or in some other way filthy in just about every scene. Ray Winstone's Captain Stanley is always covered in a sheen of sweat or dust. Again, this helps to make the film seem authentic, but it doesn't make it very easy to watch. The stink and dirt are very nearly palpable and you feel your nostrils closing in defense, to ward off the onslaught of odor.

Pearce is always interesting to watch, but Charlie Burns is more of the silent type, much like Clint Eastwood's famous persona, the Man with No Name. Charlie does a lot of observation and seems to jump into action at a moments notice. At times, this makes him scary, at others, simply interesting. Throughout, he seems conflicted about his family. On the one hand, he wants to put as much distance as possible between his older and younger brothers. He clearly cares about his younger brother and loathes his older brother, but the reasons for these feelings are a bit vague. Yes, we get that Arthur led them to massacre an innocent family, but did Charlie have regrets only after the act? We don't really find this out and it leaves a bit of a void concerning this character. The performance is good, but Pearce has done better.

Ray Winstone is a little more complicated. On the one hand, Captain Stanley realizes he has been sent to a lawless hellhole to establish order. In order to accomplish this, he must be ruthless. But he also has a wife at home, who provides him with an escape and won't tolerate such behavior. Martha (Emily Watson) does everything she can to maintain a normal English home. There is a moment when he returns home, when he has to stop for a moment and realize he is in a completely different environment. This is his sanctuary and he doesn't want anything to invade it. At one point, Martha journeys into the town and visits her husband at the jail. As the other men look at her wantonly, Stanley has to restrain his anger. He can't have his wife unprotected in the small town.

Emily Watson does an interesting job with Martha. Clearly, she would rather be elsewhere, in England, enjoying the finer things in life, but her husband has been called to this post, so she must support him. She grows a garden, she orders a Christmas tree and fine ornaments from a catalog and she prepares a turkey for their holiday dinner. She works tirelessly to maintain a proper lifestyle, yet, she still seems bored with the life of solitude here. She doesn't seem to have any friends, and seems to be regarded as another class of human all together by the people in the town. It is a nice performance, bringing depth to the film.

John Hurt portrays a bounty hunter by the name of Jellon Lamb. In his initial encounter with Charlie, Jellon is so drunk he can't even think straight, rattling off racial epitaphs directed at the Irish. His histrionics lead to some of the worst over acting I have seen in a long time. Later, he has regains his wits and attempts to take the Burns brothers in. Thankfully, the performance is brief; too much of his scenery chewing and the film would be unbearable.

Danny Huston is interesting to watch as Arthur, the older, more psychopathic brother. But we don't get an overriding sense of his evil. For instance, when Charlie returns, Arthur seems to welcome him with open arms. There is never a sense of distrust. He never questions why his younger brother would leave and then suddenly return. There is also a woman in the camp who appears to be Arthur's girlfriend, but then she suddenly disappears. These inconsistencies mar this character and prevent him from becoming a memorable, evil SOB.

As the film reaches it's inevitable, bloody climax, there is also something missing. Clearly, Charlie will play a part in the climax, but his motivation is unclear. Why does he take the position he does? The only indications we receive are looks of quiet brooding as Charlie stares ahead, grime and blood covering part of his face. Because he is the silent type, he doesn't talk a lot and his character isn't as fully developed as necessary. Which is a shame because Charlie promised to be one of Pearce's most memorable creations yet.

Yet I can still smell the stink emanating from his pores. Unfortunately, that is about the most memorable aspect of his character.

""The Proposition"" is an interesting film, but to fully enjoy it, you will need to be a huge fan of westerns. If you don't like this genre, or violent films, stay away. Far away.",1149552000,17,6086,4.684752104770814
2468625,2,B000CPWDHQ,"I never knew that there were so many flies in Australia. THE PROPOSITION has a cast of millions, all of them insects. There isn't a scene where we don't see or hear a bevy of buzzing bugs. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get used to seeing Guy Pearce or Emily Watson acting completely nonchalant as a fly crawled around on their lips.

While John Hillcoat's film is about racism, fraternity, and justice, I found the flies more interesting. THE PROPOSITION is something of an Outback Horse Opera and plays like a good first act of a grand Spaghetti Western. Yet, first acts are typically a half hour long at most, not 114 minutes! In other words, the film started out just as it was ending, and it took far too long to get there. Everything should have been paired down into twenty-some minutes.

The plot of one brother (Guy Pearce as Charley Burns) sent to kill his mad dog (yet oddly philosophical) older brother (Danny Huston as Arthur Burns) to ensure that their youngest babe in the woods brother (Richard Wilson as Mikey Burns) will not be hanged on Christmas Day was stretched painfully thin. Even the subplot of lawman Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) trying to maintain law and order in a ""savage land"" as he's sandwiched between ignorant bureaucracy, brutality, and an imported sense of British Propriety is tenuous at best.

One of the largest problems with his ""looks great, less filling"" film stems from our inability to sympathize with Guy Pearce as our foil. He invites sympathy but acts like a somnambulist, simply traveling from one locale to another. Even when he's run through with a spear, he appears nonplussed.

Written and scored by Nick Cave, the music in the film adds to some of the tedium. We hear the same ten-note refrain repeated throughout the movie. There's one noisy bit on the soundtrack that works well and seems to signal that the film's finally getting into gear but, alas, it ends before it begins too.",1149292800,2,1946,4.697947214076247
2468626,4,B000CPWDHQ,"MOVIE: The Proposition opens in the middle of an intense gunfight and we learn that it was actually an ambush set up to catch the ruthless Charlie and Mickey Burns. Two of three brothers who are part of the problem that Captain Stanley is trying to fix. The film is set during the 1800's in the Australian outback as Britain began to colonize the continent and basically throw the Australian Aboriganals into slavery. The story revolves around Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) who is trying to ""civilize"" the land by ridding it of the murderous outlaws who plague it. So, he captures Charlie Burns (Guy Pearce) and Michael Burns (Richard Wilson) and offers Charlie a proposition. He wants him to set out into the outback to find his other brother, Arthur Burns. He feels that Arthur is the abomination who has the reputation of being a rapist and a murderer. He wants Charlie to kill is brother or his younger brother will be hanged on Christmas Day. The film is incredibly gritty, and incredibly violent. In fact, it's as violent as the crud that we see in horror movies these days. However, the violence is not used for gore's sake but rather in a realistic and effective manner that adds to the tone of the film. The characters are deeply fleshed out and the screenplay is absolutely amazing. The film has a distinct moral ambiguity, and that makes us as an audience have to decipher which of these characters are good or bad. To label a main character in this film would prove difficult since each of them goes through their individual journey. I suppose if you were to single out a main character then it would be Guy Pearce, but Ray Winstone's character almost has the same weight as Pearce's. They both go through a series of events that leads them to their own discoveries of who they really are in this mess. Who is right and who is wrong in this movie? Captain Stanley is ridding the land of crime, but in doing so he is taking over the land of the natives and creating hatred and intolerance towards them. Charlie Burns may be a bad guy, but he goes on a personal journey of loyalty to his family and comes to realize just who his family is in comparison to himself. Does this revalation make him a good person? The film presents lots of questions for the audience to ponder, which is why it is such a great film. This is not just a mindless shoot 'em up western, this movie requires an expression of thought on the audience's part. The problem with the film in my opinion was the pacing, which in turn leads to the editing. The film was poorly constructed and it didn't spend time where we needed to spend time. The film is told in a linear fashion, but scenes felt short and before you know it we're already progressing to the next scene. The film overall is an amazing experience though. Nick Cave's script is just marvelous, and his subtle and menacing musical score is brilliant. The film also boasts breathtaking cinematography, cinematography that would make Leone himself very proud. Color tones, extreme contrast, and extreme wideshots are also all used to perfection and they all relate directly to the story. Look for shifts in color and certain motifs that are used, it is really a feast for the eyes.

ACTING: The film has an amazing cast. Guy Pearce (Memento), Ray Winstone (voice of Mr. Beaver in Narnia), Danny Huston (The Aviator), Emily Watson (Angela's Ashes), John Hurt (Alien, V For Vendetta), and David Wenham (Faramir from LOTR) all deliver amazing performances. They each craft their characters out so well that it makes the film incredibly interesting to watch. There isn't one weak link within the entire cast, they all have great performances. Truly a very great cast.

BOTTOM LINE: Gritty, dirty, brutal, and intelligent. The film is a great morality tale about righteousness in human nature, and it has an amazing cast to deliver Nick Cave's amazing screenplay. John Hillcoat presents a great vision for the film, but his sense of direction is a tad bit unfocused. The poor editing also detracts from the impact the movie has on the audience. The film's brilliant cinematography is worth admission price alone though. See it if you can find it since it's a limited release, but if you can't find it at a theater then definately check it out on DVD.",1148860800,9,4286,4.660501981505944

It's a good concept for a plot, the younger brother is in custody awaiting a hanging, but he will be pardoned if his brother kills his older brother outlaw instead.  I initially thought Captain Stanley was Russel Crowe, albeit I thought he looked a bit off to his normal self, as Ray Winstone talks pretty similar to a lot of Crowe's characters in similar films, and even does the fringe flick thing and other mannerisms.  I was considering turning it off but then the aboriginal prisoners starting howling after saying no, the Irish fugitive guy didn't live with a dog in the cave, he was one. I thought, well this might get a big more interesting if its a werewolf western (or weredingoes since we were in The Outback after all).  But disappointingly the Irish fugitives were just your standard rapists and murderers.

2468659,4,B000CPWDHQ,"Nick Cave and John Hillcoat have conceived a western filled with the kinds of characters you'd find in Cave's own Murder Ballads.  Morally ambiguous and intriguing, you just can't let your eyes off of them, in spite of their actions.

The Proposition is a grisly western set in the 19th century.  The title alludes to Ray Winstones character, a sherrif, as it were, and his deal with a criminal played by Guy Pearce, to catch his crazy brother, played by Danny Huston.

The film is violent and is as dependent on the scenerey as much as its great performers.  Australia is hot, isolated, and unforgiving.  The characters are sweating and frequently encounter swarms of flies.

Guy Pearces character is a member of the Burns gang.  In an attempt to save his simpleton brother, he accepts the offer from Captain Stanley, played by Winstone to kill his brother.

The film is really about relationships and what people will do to preserve or destroy them.  Guy Pearces Charlie Burns uses few words, but is clearly conflicted on what to do with his brother.

Captain Stanley is either trying to strengthen his legacy, alluding to his past triumphs, or please his wife, who seemed to be directly affected by the tragedy the Burns brothers are wanted for.

Stanley makes an executive decision to ask Charlie to find his brother, against the will of the city and its leader, played by David Wenham, the movie's one weak spot, as he overacts quite a bit.

The movie is bloody and its characters are rarely the sympathetic type, save for Stanley's wife.  While Pearce is the star, Winstone shines, as he convincingly becomes disshelved as he realizes the impact of his choices.

 Caves script is spare amd seems to intentionally leave out some details, notably the original crime the Burns brothers are wanted for, most likely to not force the viewer to not side too much with any one character.  Let it be known, there really aren't too many heroes in this peace.

The direction is sharp and beautiful, paying close attention to the land, creating a feeling of both feeling trapped and isolated while ironically being placed in a wide open landscape.

The Proposition is a nice grisly western, filled with sharp literate dialogue, separating itself from the usual action fare.  Back off though if you're looking for your standard hero driven western.  These characters seem more like what youd encounter in real old west.  For thst reason alone, this is worth checking out.  That and John Hurts brief, but masterful take as a bounty hunter.",1465516800,,2531,4.821345707656612

If he succeeds he and Mikey will be pardoned. Winstone, Pearce, and Huston give great performances and John Hurt steals the scenes although he only appears twice.

2468682,5,B000CPWDHQ,"A Christmas tale from the gallows tree. This moody western noir boasts a soundtrack by Warren Ellis and Nick Cave that is worth the price of admission, alone. However, taken in its entirety, The Proposition may be counted among the finest western's ever made. The screenplay was penned by musician Nick Cave and, as with his songs, you can rightly expect a script that is at once hyper-literate, brutal, gritty, and beautiful. Still, the success of this films sits squarely on the shoulders of director John Hillcoat who made restrained but powerful choices -- notably, a poignant monologue delivered by Emily Watson, during which Hillcoat allows the camera to show only Watson's naked back, neck, and hands. These precise, thoughtful cinematic gestures create alarming intimacy with the characters -- between acts of savagery, even the ruthless psychopath played by Danny Huston is portrayed with poetic stillness. In raising the bar, Hillcoat garners exceptional performances from an already exceptional cast -- John Hurt as a grizzled bounty hunter and Guy Pearce as Huston's brother and fateful executioner, not the least among them -- but Ray Winstone has easily delivered a career high as the coarse, tough frontier lawman who is intent on ""civilizing"" Australia, as much for the sake of his internal morality as for the delicate and refined sensibilities of his wife. Civilizing tactics might involve using brothers to track brothers, subjugating aboriginal peoples or, at the very least, forcing them to wear shoes and starched collars in the blasting heat. The core conflict between emotional ideal and rugged truth plays across Winstone's soul like the sun moving over the devastating Australian landscape. And Hillcoat gives ample attention to it all, revealing the expansiveness and ugliness of the human heart as it is amplified in the writing of human history.",1419811200,4,1874,5.25

2468693,5,B000CPWDHQ,"A striking work of genius, set in the Australian outback of the 1880s, The Proposition stands among the best ""westerns"" made in the last 30 years. Harsh, unrelentingly violent, tightly edited and incredibly compelling, with a sophisticated psycho-social commentary, it merits multiple viewings.

Arthur Burns, the leader of the Burns ""gang"", terrifies the local European population and is viewed by the Aboriginals as an unkillable ""Dog-Man"". His clan has brutally murdered the entire Hopkins family, after first raping the pregnant Mrs. Hopkins. The Hopkins were close friends with the local police captain's wife, Martha Stanley. Martha is a woman of refined and delicate sensitivities that her loving husband, Captain Stanley (perfectly played by Ray Winstone), does everything in his power to protect.

The opening scenes of the movie vividly portray a gun battle between the local police and two of the Burns, Charlie (Guy Pearce) and his beloved teenage brother, Mikey. Disgusted by his violent ways, Charlie and Mikey have recently parted ways with their older brother Arthur. They are overwhelmingly outgunned by the police, but remain alive and are taken into custody. The police caption, Captain Stanley, then makes a ""proposition"" to Charlie: if he finds and kills his brother Arthur, young Mikey will be kept from the gallows. Otherwise, the noose will go around Mikey's neck in 9 days.

The unapologetic savagery of the Burns brothers gang is based in the ancient ethic of family allegiance and revenge. Although unmercifully murderous towards threatening outsiders, they form a loyal and caring family unit within. This is contrasted against the horrific and capricious institutionalized violence of the local governing powers, performed in the name of ""civilization"", and carried out by the lonely wretches that man the police force. Among the police, only Captain Stanley has a wife (Martha) to keep him company, to the other men's envy.

The ideal of civilization and order is epitomized by Martha Stanley's character. She is portrayed in several scenes serving tea on fine china to her husband, and in others carefully washing her unblemished white skin in a luxurious bath. Yet her privileges are based on a hierarchy that maintains dominance through sadistic violence, while subjugating and alienating those in its lower ranks. Of this, Arthur Burns and his kin want no part...",1399420800,3,2397,5.316622691292876

irritating characters in a single movie. John Hurt plays what may be by
now a John Hurt specialty, the insanely irritating lunatic screeching about
nonsense, roaring with laughter at nothing, and quoting poets and so on.

Nick Cave's screenplay, backed by the brooding/soothing music of Cave and Ellis; which only adds to the desolatness of the emotions and the place, provide Guy Pearce a role that will cause one to question the loyalty and love of a sibling.  This, to me, is what this movie is essentially about:  The love you have for your flesh and blood in battle with the conviction of your eternal soul.  The conviction that must maneuver the scales of justice in the face of brotherly love.  It is a movie that everyone, mature enough, needs to see.  It should make you question your honor, make you question familia love.  It's not Hollywood bling, but it is writing in its most essential, poetic form, with acting that sets it in stone.

The military captain in charge of apprehending the Burns is played by Ray Winstone, superb actor.

2468735,4,B000CPWDHQ,"2005's ""The Proposition"" is a Western that takes place in Australia, and it's far from a typical Western.

THE PLOT: Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) is the new lawman of the territory and he's determined to civilize this brutal wasteland. In his way is a band of outlaws comprised of three brothers and a few others, but two of the brothers want out after the leader, Arthur Burns (Danny Huston), savagely murders a family in one of his raids. The two brothers are apprehended by Capt. Stanley, who offers a proposition to the older of the two, Charlie Burns (Guy Pearce): Find and assassinate the leader and both will go free. Charlie agrees to the assignment to save his little brother, not to mention he believes Arthur crossed the line when he killed the innocent family, which included a wife with child. Plus Charlie seeks redemption.

As far as filmmaking, cinematography, actors, locations, soundtrack & editing go this is a top-of-the-line film with a surreal, haunting edge. As my title blurb suggests, there are similarities to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heart-of-Darkness/dp/1466399767/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heart of Darkness</a>"" and the original ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apocalypse-Now/dp/6305609705/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apocalypse Now</a>,"" although it fails to achieve the greatness of the latter.

The story plays out in a realistic manner with long stretches of drama and bleak landscapes interspersed with flashes of extreme violence. Ray Winstone and Guy Pearce are great as the two main protagonists. Capt. Stanley understandably wants to rid the land of the brute outlaws, whereas Charlie seeks redemption for himself and his little brother. Danny Huston as Arthur Burns is captivating as the focal point and villain. Yet he's not a villain in the cliched sense and he's not one-dimensional. He loves the beauty of God's creation, he loves the art of language and he's a mystic of sorts, but he clearly crossed the line at some point in his outlaw endeavors and now must be wiped off the face of the planet. Will Charlie do it?

My only criticism is that the film seems too short. It needed more time for details and character development. As it is, we sort of have to guess the details, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I just wish the film would have gone the route of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apocalypse-Now-The-Complete-Dossier-Apocalypse-Now-Apocalypse-Now-Redux/dp/B000FSME1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apocalypse Now: The Complete Dossier (Apocalypse Now / Apocalypse Now Redux)</a>"" and given us more definition and development. Another minor criticism is that I wished they picked someone other than Emily Watson to play Capt. Stanley's wife. Not that she does a bad job in the role; it's just a matter of taste.

The runtime is 104 minutes.

FINAL WORD: ""The Proposition"" is one of those films that gets better with repeat viewings, as long as you like the approach of films like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apocalypse-Now/dp/6305609691/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apocalypse Now</a>,"" albeit way shorter (too short).

2468743,5,B000CPWDHQ,"Looks like the Australian Old West was a lot more ruthless and vicious than the one in the U.S.  A lot.

This is a shocking film, with great acting, brilliant writing, gorgeous scenery, and a subtle, but biting subtext: Colonialism is far more barbarous than the supposedly ""uncivilized"" outback it aims to tame.

This subtext is conveyed mostly through the character-development of Ray Winstone, Emily Watson (his wife), and Guy Pearce.

Winstone begins as the rough-hewn police sergeant who vows to bring civilization to this bleak outback town during the days of British colonialism.  He is vicious and impulsive, but also smart.  He makes a deal with Guy Pearce: he will hold Pearce's younger brother hostage in jail and free Pearce to find his older brother, the leader of their gang.

And it is this ""proposition"" that starts Winstone's transformation.  He realizes that his colonial superior, and in fact the vast majority of the (white) townsfolk, are far more bloodthirsty than Pearce's gang.

When the younger brother is finally flogged--against Winstone's pleas--even Watson, his wife, who had been clamoring for vengeance, sees the reality, the butchery and horror, and pointlessness, of such punishment.

Winstone himself, along with his wife, is finally saved, by, of all people, Pearce, who realizes his psychopathic older brother (his two psychopathic older brothers, in fact) are beyond control.

The British colonial official, meanwhile, who ordered the flogging, and later a slaughter of abos on no evidence, gets off scot free.",1303171200,4,1547,5.273469387755102

Stanley lives in the remote prairie with his beautiful wife, Martha (Emily Watson). After capturing two of the Burns, he offers Charlie Burns (Guy Pearce) a pardon if he were to kill Arthur Burns (Danny Huston), leader of the outlaw family.

Charlie, now riding with his older brother, must decide whether to honor the proposition.

The movie is well acted by all and the photography beautifully depicts the stark landscape that is not unlike the dry American southwest. The Proposition is blatantly violent as it leaves the viewer with little to imagine in its clear depiction of savage head bashings and one getting his head blown off.

When the two older Burns Brothers sit on their mesa gazing at the sunset, stirred by its beauty, it's hard to fathom their viciousness. We know they're both killers, psychopaths, utter outcasts from a community that is already the fly-specked outer fringe of civilization. We know - because it's the premise of the film - that one brother might have to kill the other before the last frame. There are actually four brothers in the gang but the younger two are mentally limited. They're being pursued by 'the law' more assiduously than previously because of a raid on a homestead during which they murdered a whole family after raping a pregnant woman. They're not morally -- or aesthetically -- appealing, these Burns brothers, but the craft of film-making is such that we the audience feel more empathy for them than for the nasty customers -- drunken slob troopers, bounty hunters, and one well-dressed prig who must be the town banker -- who are howling for their blood. The only well-meaning chap in sight is Captain Stanley, a hired law enforcer who has brought his genteel wife to this badlands. The Captain dreams that it's his role to bring order to this frontier, but even he is morally compromised from the first scene, in which he makes the ""proposition"" that brother Charlie Burns should murder his older brother Arthur in order to save his younger brother Mikey from hanging on Christmas Day. Besides, what the frontier really wants of him is the extermination of the aborigines. The man hasn't a prayer! His role is truly quixotic.

Now, in some films, one might look for back-fill, -- causation, clues -- about how the Burns Brothers became outcasts, but there are no explanations to be had in The Proposition. Things are. Period.

There's a lot of the harrowing atmosphere of a Patrick White novel, ""Voss"" for instance, in this film. Patrick White was Australia's sole Nobel Prize for Literature winner, so far. Like the 'bounty hunter' who tangles with the Burns Brothers, Patrick White's characters are often haggard, filthy, desiccated men with backgrounds of education and class. They are, at the same time, more degenerate and more metaphysical than your average gunslinger in an American western shoot-em-up. As far as I know, the script of The Proposition isn't based on anything of White's, but it could have been. Or perhaps it's really Australia; it's the harsh history of Australia that infuses both Patrick White's novels and this film.

Still, I found myself not quite accepting the climax of the film, which I have to refrain from disclosing. I'm not quite desiccated enough myself to be content with ""Things are"". My reluctance to merely believe in an act that seems unbelievable is the reason for my deduction of a star from my rating.",1267228800,5,2890,4.9059304703476485

All the best westerns are about the nature of order and justice and The Proposition, while set in the Australian outback rather than the old west, understands this completely and probes these themes well; a film of exceptional (albeit never gratuitous) violence but also one which generates many wonderfully quiet moments with Ray Winstone (good as ever) and his wife Emma Watson, this is quite a little movie.

This is not like any other western that you have every watch. There's not a lot of horse chases and standoffs with gun a blazin'. But there is suspense and violence that fit the story well.

I don't know what else to say about the Proposition, it's fantastic. This is probably not a movie for the massess because there's not enough explosions and special effects I'm sure. If you like a good story and good acting and good directing then see this movie.

The blu-ray transfer is outstanding as well.",1252886400,2,651,4.508474576271187
2468757,5,B000CPWDHQ,"I don't use the word perfect often. But I will say this movie hit every mark for what I expect and hope to see in a western. nevermind the fact that it takes place in Australia. The Proposition is easily the best Western film I've seen since Eastwood's magnum opus, Unforgiven. Actually it shares a lot with Unforgiven. The realistic approach to characters, the fuzzy line of right and wrong, characters and their sordid past.
If I had to sum this up into just a few words, I'd say the film is poignant, you get a sense of sorrow watching it. You watch Ray Winstone's character attempt at all lengths to bring justice to this lawless little town. You can sense the past of the Burns brothers, without the need of any flashbacks. You get a perfect sense of their relationship. The story is about these three brothers, and an offer made to Charlie (Guy Pearce). This offer, extended by Winstones character, Captain Stanley. The offer is simple, kill your older brother, a psychotic murderer, to save your younger brother.
In many ways Pearce's character is the ""star"" but the film balances its leads very well. This is the first film I've seen from Director John Hilcoat. he captures the mood and tones of a place we thought only existed in Western America. But the outback is the perfect setting for a western. The directing of the film is stellar, it evokes that somber tone, the shots are set up so well. Each frame is used to its full potential whether simply portraying the harshness of the Outback or capturing the remorse on faces after a brutal public whipping. Again, the film hits every mark. What little 'action' it does have is absolutely crucial to the story and is speckled throughout, unlike most modern westerns that feel you have to continually build. The Proposition knows how and when to show its action scenes. And as a side note, if you pick this up of Blu Ray, be prepared for an incredible picture. The colors in this film make me remember why I bought a BD player in the first place. All the dust, and the heat, and the flies are captured in such stunning realistic detail, its worth many times what you pay for it.
Nick Cave wrote the script, weird I know. But the guy has done an incredible job of allowing the audience to really feel for the characters and to step into their boots when they're on the screen. Nick simply wanted to compose a score for a Western, Nick would go on to score the underrated but lengthy Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. But Hilcoat asked him to write a film, some Cave had never done before. Which is very hard to believe considering the emotion, timing and style portrayed in his script. The gruffness of Captain Stanley (Winstone), the boyish regret from the youngest Burns brother. John Hurt makes a small but unforgettable performance as a bounty hunter, but his characters lines sum up the entire mood of the time period. I'm hoping Cave continues to write as he obviously knows what he's doing.
Ok so I think I've rattled on long enough about the film. But in closing, I bought this movie at the whim of remembering the trailer I'd seen way back in '06 when it first came to DVD. The price on the Blu ray was amazingly low, so I picked it up. Since buying it i've been showing it off to all my friends, dragging them over in an attempt to share this beautiful film with them. And each one has loved it just as much as I did. If you're a western fan, or just a fan of period dramas in general, pick The Proposition up.",1252713600,4,3500,4.4703125

2468761,5,B000CPWDHQ,"THE FILM

Judging from the offerings over the past few years, it appears that the western, as a film genre, is in something of a renaissance, after roughly three decades of being nearly extinct. The newest western films do not bear much resemblance to the genre's ""golden era"" of circa-1950s Hollywood, aside from the fact that they are part of that same genre. Such classics as ""Red River,"" ""High Noon,"" ""Shane,"" ""The Searchers,"" ""Rio Bravo,"" and ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" will always remain hallmarks of filmdom, as they should. The western, however, is a genre that began to change radically--along, of course, with the rest of filmmaking generally--during the sixties, beginning mid-decade with the so-called spaghetti westerns like ""A Fistful of Dollars,"" then with Hollywood's new style of western, featuring the likes of ""The Wild Bunch,"" ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" and ""McCabe and Mrs Miller."" Decades later, ""Unforgiven,"" heralded the rebirth of the western.

The latter westerns were different from those in the fifties and earlier not only in their aesthetic and technical styles of filmmaking and, in some cases, their graphic depiction of violence, but also in the essential nature of their protagonists. Where the difference between good guys and bad guys used to be clear-cut in mid-twentieth-century westerns, we now find ourselves sympathizing, if not outright cheering, for ""heroes"" who, at best, may be profoundly flawed in some way or, at worst, may partake in the same activities of the villains once loathed by audiences over a half-century ago. Our tenuousness toward our new brand of good guys (or better-than-worst guys) is further increased when the violence in which they partake is shown in a style that is much more graphic and unglamorous than anything ever imaginable when Technicolor was still a relatively new phenomenon.

All of which brings me to ""The Proposition,"" a raw and very much modern western from Australia, of all places, that takes to a new level its cues from the revisionist westerns so popular of late, and with much artistic success. The subjects in this memorable film directed by John Hillcoat aren't known for robbing banks or running brothels. But those on the side of the villains are known for their rape, brutality, and murder. Those ""good"" guys who are charged to introduce and enforce law and order across the frontier of Australia do so with their own brand of brutality and murder (but not rape). In fact, at the start of the story, smartly written by Nick Cave, the good guys, led by Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone, gruff and husky) actually appear to be far more ruthless than the career criminals they so brutally subdue and arrest upon breaking into a shack-like brothel, maiming or killing most of the people within.

Despite the carnage, the Captain's main targets, a pair of the notorious Burns brothers, remain relatively unscathed. Relatively. Attacks that leave one bruised, frightened, and angry is a relatively better outcome than those that leave one dead. But here already arises the second reason for which we could question the integrity of our hero, the C\aptain. It turns out he is willing to spare the otherwise unavoidable execution of these two--Charlie Burns (Guy Pearce, at first a portrait of defiance; then, one of inner conflict) and his younger brother, the virtually harmless Mike (Richard Wilson, inhabiting a young body with the demeanor of a scared, little boy)--if Charlie successfully finds and kills his older brother, Arthur, the leader of the Burns gang and by far the most dangerous and accountable for the most deplorable of their crimes, including rape and murder. Therein lies the proposition of the title: kill your brother or be killed yourself, along with your dearest younger sibling. Charlie, the middle brother, accepts and is soon on his way to fulfilling his end of the deal, while Mike is sent to jail, with the Captain's promise to keep him in good health until the business with Arthur has reached its grim conclusion.

The Australian outback he travels through on the quest to find his estranged brother is an inhospitable, arid terrain of desert, drybush, rocky caves and mountains. Trees are sparse, and the leaves on those that stand are dry or nonexistant. Everything seems coated in a dusty yellow. The night sky, by contrast, is a clear blue, filled with stars. The desert twilight, in which characters and rocky ledges are rendered as silhouettes against an orange and yellow sky, are among the most memorable images in a movie that is filled with them.

The appearance of the people, especially the men--including most of the main characters in the story--is as haggard and unglamorous as the land they inhabit, their faces dirty and partly-obscurred by thick, messy beards, their foreheads sweaty and criss-crossed with wrinkles, their teeth irregular, their heads topped by long, dissheveled hair, the clothes they wear barely more than rags. Even the uniform of Winstone's captain seems weatherworn. The main actors are well-known, but so thoroughly are their appearances subsumed by the rawness and the lack of luster the story demands that many of them are barely recognizable. To spot Pearce here, one forgets that he played a thoroughly clean cop (in both looks and behavior) in ""L.A. Confidential,"" a few years prior. All the severe visual beauty is created and captured by director of photography Benoit Delhomme, production designer Chris Kennedy, and costume designer Margot Wilson.

The travels through the countryside not only advance the story, but serve as peaceful interludes between the scenes of tension and violence. In several scenes, a voice can be heard softly whispering its poetry. Others contain the music of Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, spare but, as such, also complementary. The film is fortunate to have screenplay writer Cave, in this second role in that he manages to integrate the screenplay and soundtrack better than would normally be expected. Another highlight of this film is the editing by Jon Gregory, which, at certain key moments, cuts seamlessly back and forth in time or between locations, but without causing confusion or itself becoming the main attraction. It serves to provide a nice economy of time as well as heighten the drama.

In the midst of this rough-hewn frontier, Charlie encounters a humble cabin amidst a wasteland filled with ashen boulders and colorful discarded glass bottles. It is the home of the equally-colorful Jellon Lamb (John Hurt), an ancient hermit, losing his teeth, who is by turns wily, wisecracking, and a bit off-kilter, yet speaks much as an English professor might (a little too much so, really) and is experienced at defending himself--something every man must know how to do in this world.

In the first couple scenes with Arthur Burns (Danny Huston), the film's ultimate bad guy, just after Charlie finally finds him, he seems contemplative on one hand and genuinely caring for both his brothers on the other. Not traits we would necessarily expect to see in the picture's most wanted villain. The love between the brothers is palpable, making the chief goal at hand rather difficult, though perhaps not impossible.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the divide, the Captain has affections of his own in the form of his loving wife, Martha Stanley (a constantly concerned Emily Watson). Easily the entire film's epitome of loveliness, grace, and cultured behavior, she stands in sharp visual contrast to most of the other characters in that she does not ""look terrible"" (her words, at one point, to describe her own husband, who agrees with that assessment). They seem so different--she, petite, quiet, and refined; he, stocky, loud, and brutish (except around his wife)--that it would be difficult to believe them as a couple were it not for the tangible mutual intimacy the actors Watson and Winstone so convincingly infuse their characters with. When she pays him an unexpected visit at the jailhouse, it is remarkable to watch Winstone, in the space of a few seconds of a single scene, go from demanding captain to quiet and concerned husband, always trying to protect his gentle, but curious, wife from the harsh realities of his job.

Like Martha Stanley herself, the couple's very residence, in fact, stands alone, in sharp contrast to its rugged, desolate, flat environs. Relatively large, sturdy, and far more refined than anything else around, moreso than the buildings in the dusty town where the jail is located. It remains every bit the small taste of the British culture the Stanleys left behind when the Captain took on his present duties.

The other character of note that stands in elegant relief to those around him is Eden Fletcher (David Wenham), the superior who assigned Captain Stanley those duties in the first place. Unlike Mrs Stanley, his demeanor is more pretentiously upper-crust, exuding an air that is both authoritative, and somewhat detached. We first meet him, cleanshaven except for his groomed moustache, cloaked in his three-piece suit, tie, hat, and fine shoes, as he gallops into town on his white horse. He is in tune with the new settlers so far as his quest for law and order, but, as the picture of the immaculate, delegates the dirty work to Captain Stanley and his officers.

One may be, at first, tempted to assume Fletcher's and, to a larger extent, Martha's superior grace indicates that they are the story's moral center, but that would be unwise. In fact, no one man or woman truly serves that purpose. There are no real heroes. Remember, in this picture ""good"" and ""bad"" is never a simple case of black and white; it takes on a form that is much more dusty-brown. As the tale pans out, both Martha and Mr Fletcher join the townspeople in asking the Captain why the jailed Mike Burns has not received a harsher punishment. No matter that his actual involvement in the rape and murder of an innocent was merely a tangential guilt by association; the town is out for blood and if he is the sacraficial lamb, then so be it. A large part of the picture's brilliance comes from the fact that it raises the question of what, exactly, constitutes fair punishment for injustices, and that it does not glorify or prettify the revenge that both sides eventually take against each other. To the contrary, the violence here is consitently shocking and raw, at times grizzly, rather like that done to wild animals.

Through it all, each of the characters experiences changes in regard to their moral and ethical positions, social status, relations with others, and how they live up to their promises, or fail to. And we're shown the resulting consequences, usually involving varying incarnations of agony. For all its frankness, it can be a difficult film to experience, but it is very much a movie worth seeing, and a must for those who enjoy the most modern of westerns available.

ON THE DISC
This review refers to the Blu-ray disc edition. The features of other available editions may differ.

Since this is a high-def disc of a recently-made film, the image is so sharp that one's eyes bleed (metaphorically). Detailed textures on clothing are viewable as patterns, not just noise, and individual strands of hair are easily distinguishable from each other, no matter how inter-tangled they are with each other. The sound is clear enough but this is another instance where spoken words are barely audible compared to music, a problem that is especially detrimental to this film, given the presence of much soft speaking.

There are a good number special features, as follows.

AUDIO COMMENTARY featuring director Hillcoat and writer Cave, who explain their goals and methods that drove the making of the film, and their experiences. Overall, it's relevant, quite informative, and well done.

DELETED SCENES number seven and most feature Patrick Hopkins (Oliver Ackland), a family member of the slain victims who was left out of the final edit of the film. Viewing these scenes, I feel that the filmmakers generally were wise to have left out most of the scenes, which, while themselves are good, would not have added much to the film but extra running time. The one scene I thought should perhaps have been left in is when Mrs Stanley encounters Hopkins on the street, as it would have helped clarify how signficant the capture of the Burns brothers was not only to the family of the victims but to Mrs Stanley herself.

PHOTO GALLERY includes a generous selection of stills from scenes that appeared in the final film itself as well as many on-set pictures shot specifically to compose a photo gallery such as this. The actors are in costume and on set in all instances. The two types of photos are interwoven so well together and are so stylistically similar that, at a casual first glance, they may all seem to be film stills. Under different circumstances, I would have liked to have seen other photos, such as of the director in action, say, but this is quite well put-together.

THE MAKING OF THE PROPOSITION. This documentary manages to enlighten viewers on a fairly large number of related topics, albeit briefly, in under a half-hour, including the filmmakers intent to capture the rough life and injustices of the Australian frontier, musician Cave's expansion for the film into screenwriting, a brief interpretation of each of the important characters by their respective performers, shooting in conditions that were decidedly inhospitable, and how well the cast and crew worked with each other, working with the aboriginal community, Quite good.

INSIDE THE PROPOSITION is a greatly-expanded documentary about the film, its production, and the issues with which it is concerned. Some of the clips from the shorter making-of piece are, in fact, taken from this longer work. Well-organized, it is divided into nine sections, covering topics that concern the script, characters, themes, shooting conditions, filming on land that is considered sacred, and other topics. The sections can be watched singly or as a seamless whole. One wishes it were more dynamic. As it is, the filmmakers, actors, and crew are on-set talking heads. Clips of the film and other supporting images and could have been used to illustrate the points made by the speakers, as was the case in the other shorter documentary. I do very much like the film stills of each speaker with their name and role superimposed in title; it's a simple and effective method of introduction.

THEATRICAL TRAILER, which has a little slice of much of what the feature delivers: action, intrigue, a slight meditation, rustic landscapes. It comes close to spoiling certain scenes, especially the final confrontation, but certainly does sell the film.",1234742400,5,14773,5.015905383360522
2468762,5,B000CPWDHQ,"The Proposition, written by songwriter, Nick Cave, uses the conventions of the Western genre to wrestle with ideas of good and evil (somewhat standard in the recent strain of revisionist Westerns) but more interestingly, uses the form to also indict the colonialist mission in Australia. The story is set in motion when a lawman bent on capturing three outlaw brothers makes a deal with the middle of the three: bring back the oldest one or the youngest, who he has in custody, will hang. The lawman, played by Ray Winstone, echoes the film's tagline, when he proclaims emphatically ""this land will be civilized."" Yet the remainder of the film makes it abundantly clear that what the European settlers have brought to the country is a far cry from civilization.

The contrast between the worlds of the colonialists and the colonized is effectively evoked in a scene where Ray Winstone's character tells his Aboriginal servant to be on his way as he settles on his porch, rifle in hand, waiting for the inevitably brutal attack from the outlaws that will follow. He wishes the Aboriginal man, ""Merry Christmas,"" at which point the latter removes his shoes and socks at the gate of the yard, returns the good wishes with a hint of irony in his voice and walks away barefoot. The camera lingers on the shoes briefly, letting us know that we are meant to see something beyond the surface in this moment. One interpretation is that the shoes are a connection to ""civilization"" but in this case, a civilization that doesn't fit into the world it has been introduced to. Later another Aboriginal man, who is serving as a tracker for a group of lawmen, calls attention to the barbarism of the Europeans when he comments to one of the lawmen, ""strange mob, you whities,"" as they observe the remaining members of the troop standing around a tree, trying to urinate on each other. Like Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man, which also uses the Western genre to critique the treatment of indigenous people, The Proposition gives a voice to the oppressed and does it in a way that's not merely politically correct.

The Proposition is an incredibly violent yet somehow subtle film. Themes are suggested but (excuse the pun) nothing is black and white. Over 100 minutes the moral struggles of its complex characters are explored and time feels like it has passed too quickly. The film's violence feels essential to the narrative for lending verisimilitude but also for adding urgency to the stakes involved for its characters. Not a scene is wasted. The images are lyrical, the visual style, brisk and the cinematography, breathtaking. The casting and performances are all perfect, with Danny Huston and John Hurt being particularly outstanding.

This is a brilliant film that's been unjustly ignored, but not surprisingly so, considering its underlying critical stance. Rent, buy or borrow it, but make sure you see it.

2468772,5,B000CPWDHQ,"A beautiful western.  Nick Cave's script is outstanding and the soundtrack he made to go with it is mesmerizing. This was the first blu ray I bought, I already owned the DVD.  For western fans, Nick Cave fans, classic film fans- God, I don't care who you are, check this out.",1220313600,2,275,4.372549019607843
2468773,5,B000CPWDHQ,"I added this to an order of five other movies, more as an afterthought than anything, figured that at such a low price, it would be hard to go wrong. And wow, what a deal that turned out to be- I ended up watching it before any of the others, and I was impressed on all fronts.

Nick Cave's script is tight, well-paced, and lends plenty of depth and pathos to both of the two main characters, and in turn, Guy Pierce and Ray Winstone both ably rise to the challenge of making each a complex, fully-realized figure that the viewer wants to understand and doesn't really simply root for or against, which makes the movie all the more interesting to watch as the inevitable conclusion draws near.

Add very solid direction and just the right amount of (non-gratuitous) violence to the mix and you have the formula for an excellent ""modern"" western, one that any fan of the genre should enjoy and also one that might well be worth watching even for those that aren't as familiar with such movies as Unforgiven and the like.

The Blu-Ray transfer is surprising solid for such an affordable disc. First Look isn't necessarily known for the best transfers around, and though there are certainly plenty of shots that have unpleasant levels of softness, the vast majority show excellent levels of detail and are sharper, which lends well to showing the depth expected in the better hi-def transfers.

Overall, a very strong entry in the genre, a good effort on Blu-Ray, and a great price.",1219622400,6,1479,4.633587786259542

Brilliant acting with a terrific plot and setting I'm sure American audiences have yet to experience (the Aussie outback), this is a must-see for anyone who even thinks they might possibly like a Western.

Though most reviews have been good, I am surprised this one hasn't received more attention for it's acting, cinematography, brutality, and beauty. Guy Pearce continues to impress in everything he is in, but the real reason to see this film is for Ray Winstone. He is one of this generations finest actors and is brilliant in ""The Proposition"". If you're squeamish, beware, as there is much violence within. But if you can handle it, I'm sure you will have to admit that this film is a masterpiece.",1219190400,4,557,4.6938775510204085
2468776,2,B000CPWDHQ,"Hype is hype and cinema more than most art genres suffers due its dependency on it. However, I was prepared with empathatic promise for,'Propostion' having lauded Cave's score for,'Jesse James' and esteemed his writing in,'The Secret life of The Love Song'. After all, we'd seemed to have dieted on Westerns as kids and even gone to the same art school in Melbourne. So I dipped into the recent,'Nick Cave Stories' and this film over the weekend. The conclusion is that both products do not showcase his talents at their premium. The brilliant, brooding intensity found in the three minute pop vehicle is not so elucidating when extended to feature length nihilism. We never enter into the hearts or minds of the characters and no amount of ravishing scenery, and again, a superb score, can disguise or substitute for the serious absence of moral compass. Not, mind you, in the narrative, which one  expects from the given scenario. But in the treatment and construction of the film. Whether this is the writing or directing I don't know. But I frequently felt that the film's sense of the frontier was left on the storyboard, and at times veered close to parody; cliches and stereotypes abound and the film has that familiar, pre-psychological Australian aspect to it. As for, 'Nick Cave Stories', only the industry of hype cultivating celebrity, could justify its publication. Such scant offerings and marginalia is a reproach even to hagiography. A few Polly Borland photos apart saves it from absolute dismaissal as trivia.",1217808000,4,1527,5.011811023622047
2468777,4,B000CPWDHQ,"Great characters, cinematography, and music propel this harsh tale of the 1880s Australian Outback. The characters are mostly shades of gray, with even the most villainous seeming to have at least some kind of moral code. Although awash in violence, the movie does convey the damaging aftereffects upon those who witness, experience, and perpetrate it, even when it seems justified.

The film crew ventured far enough into the Outback to capture not only its desolateness but some spectacular sunsets and moon shots. The music enhances the overall feel of the movie. The collaboration between  musician/wordsmith, Nick Cave, also the movie's screenwriter, and Dirty Three's Warren Ellis works exceedingly well, combining Ellis' atmospherics perfectly with Cave's lyrics.

All of the acting succeeds, but the most noteworthy is John Hurt's portrayal of the bounty hunter, Jellon Lamb, which alone is worth the price of the movie.

2468779,3,B000CPWDHQ,"After recently leaving his older brother's (Arthur) gang, a dirty, skeletal bad guy named Charles Burns (Guy Pierce) has taken along his younger brother (Mikey), keeping him away from more senseless slaughtering on the behalf of the gang (you have to love how into character Guy Pierce gets).  The arid countryside of Australia is rough, and being a criminal makes it even worse.  And when Captain Morris Stanley, a driven law-man who fancies himself as an Aussie version of Wyatt Earp, decides to go after the three brothers, there is major trouble for Charles.

Both brothers are soon captured, and that is when Morris presents the proposition to Charles: find and kill his brother Arthur, or his younger brother Mikey will hang.  It's obviously a difficult choice; he seemingly has to decide between saving a more nave younger brother, or allowing his older brother, a man referred to as an abomination, to live freely.

What follows is a search by Charles and Morris amongst the Aborigonies for Arthur Burns, a man who has been given a Crocodile Dundee-level, mythical status by the locals.  He's someone to be honored and feared, so much so that shape-shifting powers have even been attributed to him, as if he were magical and able to change into a dog at will.  Not so much.  Charles finds his brother and is forced to make the ultimate decision.

This film's deliberate moral ambiguity is it's strength, and the conclusion provides yet another difficult moment, where good and bad are not completely clear, and the best characters can do is grasp onto the belief that God works in mysterious, albeit seemingly unjust and perverse ways.

There are several major flaws to this movie.  The first, and clearly the worst, is Morris' wife Martha, a busybody moron ruled entirely by emotions, constantly interfering where she is neither wanted nor supposed to be.  She's just a dreadful character.  Aside from her considerable attempts to ruin the movie, there were also some very poorly done camera shots, and a storyline looser than an all fiber diet.  Perhaps it was just that there was too much focus on Morris and not the others.  It's the absolute lack of meaningful character development that really hurts this film.  At the end of the movie I didn't empathize with a single character; in fact, I loathed everyone except Morris.  Last but not least, the audio quality is horrible.  I don't know if it's merely an aspect of the DVD transfer, or just amatuer movie making, but watching it is difficult without either missing something or getting eardrum injuries - choose your own agony.

It's a fairly good movie, with great acting and some interesting aspects, but it's lacking in too many ways to be considered a great movie.",1212710400,,2734,4.866090712742981
2468780,5,B000CPWDHQ,"The Proposition (John Hillcoat, 2006)

Imagine you're the middle brother of three, and the three of you have been an outlaw gang for so long no one remembers anything else. Now imagine that the local law captures you and your younger brother, and offers you a proposition: you have nine days to find and kill your older brother, or the law will hang your younger brother. What do you do?

Such is the situation that Charlie Burns (L. A. Confidential's Guy Pearce) finds himself in. The law, in the person of Captain Stanley (Sexy Beast's Ray Winstone) has younger brother Mike (Richard Wilson) in chains, and will only let him go if Charlie hunts down and kills his psychotic older brother Arthur (Danny Huston). As with most westerns, it's a simple plot; what you do with it is what separates the wheat from the chaff. And John Hillcoat has stamped himself a director for the ages with this, the best western since Dead Man a decade previous.

Australia seems an obvious place to make westerns; the great big sky just begs for the kind of stark, unforgiving cinematography that Australian directors have been utilizing for decades now. (Though, oddly, despite living in the land of the cinematographers, Hillcoat imported his from France-- Benoit Delhomme, who cut his teeth on such stunning movies as Cyclo.) It's dead perfect for westerns, as is the barren, inhospitable Outback landscape where The Proposition takes place; New Mexico ain't got nothin' on this. Add a script written by Nick Cave, who seemed to be channelling the spirit of Cormac McCarthy's earlier, bloodier western novels (oh, yeah, if you think The Road and No Country for Old Men were warped, check out Blood Meridian...). Cave has had a fascination with the culture of the American South for a long, long time now (note his excellent, terribly underrated novel ...And the [censored for amazon consumption] Saw the Angel), and since McCarthy originated in the South (while I'm talking books, McCarthy's southern-period novel Child of God is another must-read), it all comes together like one huge thunderclap. And what a storm it unveils. Cave, who also did the music for the film (with his Bad Seeds compatriot Warren Ellis-- no relation to the graphic novel writer), meshes the two in a remarkable way; being as much a music fan as a movie fan, I tend to pay a lot of attention to how well music goes with image, and it does so here in a way I'm not sure I've ever seen before. The film's music is as much a character as is Charlie, or Arthur, or the outback itself. (Okay, I can think of one other example, perhaps-- Peter Gabriel's score for The Last Temptation of Christ.) Cave created a thing of remarkable savagery and beauty here, and Hillcoat realized it as well as he could-- and that is very well indeed.

I haven't even scraped the tip of the iceberg of the reasons why you need to see this movie. There are so very many. Hillcoat, whose next project is, ironically enough, an adaptation of McCarthy's The Road (why Cave did not write the screenplay, I've no idea, but Guy Pearce is once again involved), has created what may be the perfect down under western here. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Flirting with a spot on my 100 best movies of all time list. **** ",1212105600,3,3255,4.703508771929824
2468781,3,B000CPWDHQ,"...but not ""excellent"" or ""epic"", I'm afraid.

What's nice is seeing a fresh Western-type movie, but unfortunately there is not quite enough character development or focus to label this as a fantastic overall achievement. The brutal opening scene which results in the gritty dialog between Captain Stanley and Charlie sets a tone for the movie that makes your guts churn but the dramatic intent doesn't maintain as the movie goes on. When it was over, I wasn't dying to watch it more than once.

On the good side, it was unpredictable, which is saying a lot when it comes to movies these days. Great cast but not used to their full potential. Great basis for a story with the script falling a little short. There is some beautiful cinematography of the Australian outback. The interior shots of Stanley and Martha's home were filled with vivid old-timey colors, including a gorgeously-shot scene of Emily Watson in the bathtub.

***Small Spoiler Alert***- and I'm sorry but I'm having a really hard time believing someone could survive a spear injury like Charlie got. That was tough to swallow and is an example of one aspect that made it difficult to take the drama as seriously as it was meant to be received.",1209859200,,1212,4.7894736842105265

2468783,4,B000CPWDHQ,"Bleak, brutal and yet strangely lyrical... a bit like Cave's own music. It looks great, the score is mean and moody, and it's got a huge emotional impact. Ray Winstone is as solid and steady as ever, and Guy Pearce adds the bearded cowboy to his CV.

2468784,5,B000CPWDHQ,"This is a movie about cycles of violence.  The movie asks the question:  What does it take to end cycles of violence?  How does an eye for an eye ever end?

And the movie suggests some violence will not stop without relatively innocent men and women standing up against the people they love who are violent.  This movie is not about good guys and bad guys.  It is not about ""us"" and ""them,"" where ""them"" is some foreign group.  This movie is about the bad within our own community, our own family, and ourselves.

The Proposition or the question the movie asks is:  Would you stop the violence if the person closest to you was the cause of the violence?  And if you could not stop the violence, would you be willing to separate yourself from the person you love who is unjustifiably using violence and threats of violence?

This is a very graphically violent film.  It does not shy away from focusing on the cruelties of violence.  So, if you are a person who has trouble with violent images and getting them out of your thoughts and dreams, I caution you strongly.

This film is great.  It is an important film.  The film asks the viewer to weigh and compare threats and fears.  It suggests that greater fears require greater measures, efforts, and consideration.

Each main character in this film is associated with another character who is using violence to achieve an objective.  And each character decides whether or not to stay associated with the violent patterns.

No character ""wins"" in the end of this film.  All of the characters become casualties to violence.  And the question each viewer is left to answer for themselves is:  Even though none of the characters are left unscarred by violence in the end, is the world better off because of the choices each character made?  The answer to that question is not intended to be simple or clear.  It is for each person to decide.",1205193600,,1887,4.594594594594595
2468785,4,B000CPWDHQ,"In 1880s Australia, a lawman makes a deal with a bandit to bring his murderous brother to justice. Simple story about the brutality of frontier life has direction, cinematography and characters reminiscent of the best 60s spaghetti westerns such as ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" (1969).

2468786,2,B000CPWDHQ,"The Proposition is a very nicely shot, well-cast (Guy Pearce, Ray Winstone, Emily Watson, John Hurt, Danny Huston), but finally uninvolving little gothic Western written by Nick Cave. It is also yet another movie that was absurdly overpraised. Cave currently enjoys the dubious luxury of not being able to take a wrong step with critics - the surest recipe for artistic complacency and stagnation - and it's Cave's script that lets the film down. Admittedly, Cave has come up with a good, archetypal story (a criminal is sent to kill his brother in exchange for freedom), but he doesn't appear to be interested in writing real characters we can sympathize with, or even believe in. The dialogue is functional at best, at worst pretentious and heavy-handed. Cave's presence is felt throughout every scene and every line, and it feels like an intrusion. His penchant for murder, darkness, and quasi-Biblical subtexts works fine when it's the backdrop for Gothic ballads, but here it just seems indulgent, slightly sophomoric. Though it looks beautiful, The Proposition doesn't really amount to much, not least because the film - Cave's script - is so full of itself. It parades its ""deeper"" meanings and existential violence like some whiskey-soaked barfly trying to be deep but only succeeding in being annoying. The Proposition is somehow smug and self-enamored, and it has a kind of arrogance - it never bothers to develop its themes or characters or bring them to life. When all the blood and thunder is over, however much we may be impressed by the spectacle (critics bought Cave's malarky hook, line, and sinker), we really couldn't give a damn.",1204588800,10,1649,5.021897810218978
2468787,5,B000CPWDHQ,"One of the sad truths of the last 20 years is that Americans seem to have largely lost touch with the western films they invented. But the films live on often far from their inspiration. This is an ""australian"" western. Its a brutal morality tale set in the australian outback. This isn't for everyone in that the story (and almost everything else) is very intense.

The acting is uniformly excellent and the shooting of the film is very creative. If you like intense stories at the edge of law and morality, this is a good piece of work.",1200614400,,538,4.489795918367347
2468788,5,B000CPWDHQ,"The plot description makes ""The Proposition"" look like a putrid exploitation flick: a criminal is given the chance of a pardon for himself and his younger brother -- who's to be executed on Christmas Day for rape -- if the man kills his older brother, a psychotic serial killer.

It's nothing of the sort. Though there are scenes of brutal, grisly killings (which are brief, and not lingered over), it plays out as a nuanced drama about compassion, justice, guilt, and responsibility, in an environment where these things are in short supply.

I disagree with the reviewer who rejected the film on the basis of its ""pointless depravity"". ""The Proposition"" is not about depravity, but what people consider depraved behavior, and how they react to it. This is the sort of R-rated film parents should invite their children to watch, so they can discuss the story's moral issues.

The performances are uniformly outstanding. John Hurt gets the ""scenery chewing"" role as a crazed bounty hunter, and delivers magnificently. Unlike Jack Nicholson's performance in ""The Departed"", Hurt's doesn't seem out of place with the quieter performances of the other actors. I find it remarkable that directors (Ang Lee, Martin Scorsese) continue to elicit ever-more-subtle performances from actors, without becoming ""arty"" or vapid.

I'd never heard of John Hillcoat, but his direction puts him in the top rank of directors. I find it remarkable that, though sound films have been around for 80 years, the quality of acting and direction continues to improve. A motion picture is a Gesamtkunstwerk that can be ""anything""; Hillcoat and Cave show that films have yet to reach their artistic limit.

It's difficult to overpraise Nick Cave's simple-but-focused screenplay, which makes its points without making us aware it's making them, and his musical score.

This is a magnificent motion picture. Don't let the violence keep you from seeing it.

Comments on the BD: I recently bought the Blu-ray edition. In the running commentary (created for the DVD), the director complains that the sunsets look exaggerated on DVD, tha the film was shot to look right in a theater. I don't know whether the BD comes closer to the theatrical experience, but it's great to see this film on a large high-resolution screen. My opinion hasn't changed. This is a terrific film, very much worth seeing. I liked it even better the second time around.",1200009600,,2411,5.057934508816121
2468789,4,B000CPWDHQ,"Set on an arid desert and sun-baked continent, during the late 1800's British settlement days, Pearce stars as Charlie Burns, one of three brothers that make up the notorious criminal Arthur Burns...

At the opening credits Charlie and his younger brother the 14-year-old Mikey are captured after a bloody shoot out with regional Captain Stanley in the aftermath of a brutal rape and murder... The decent captain is after their eldest brother Arthur described as 'the beast,' and is prepared to do just about anything to get him...

Thus Stanley lays out Charlie an unholy bargain: While Mikey stays in his custody, in jail, Charlie must find, kill or return Arthur or his teenaged brother will be hung on Christmas Day... He has nine days to do so...

Charlie eventually finds his brother but is left with one choice... He must decide if he can live with his decision to either kill Arthur or let Mikey be executed...

John Hillcoat's characters not only strike us with their emotions of grief and pain, or their passion of hate but they are presented in their real states that sway down hopelessness, denial, pity and firm belief...

Pearce combines a touch of kindness to Charlie's character, but it's a touch that keeps out of the way any love... It's, in essence, only enough to add a decisive influence on his personality that makes him unpredictable...

Danny Huston is magnificent as Arthur Burns... His deeply intelligence and totally brutal character is captured in a very good sense...

Richard Wilson, Mikey is given little to do beyond being frightened and horrorized...

Winstone is amazing in the role of the army officer who wants to civilize the place... We feel how his nerves are about to break... He imprisons his wife Martha for safety and protection caring at the same time about her delicate sensibilities...

Emily Watson is absolutely stunning as the fragile woman whose gentleness captures convincingly the character of Emily, the innocent wife who cares about her husband, her house and her perfect ""garden"" but her way of life is so far away from the reality of her surroundings...

John Hurt gives an interesting performance as the deranged bounty hunter...

2468791,5,B000CPWDHQ,"Since so many others have rehashed the plot of The Proposition here, I will not. Instead I will make a few observations about why I think this is such a compelling movie. Be forewarned, its not at all for the squeamish. The blood, the gore, and the nightmarish graphic brutality would all combine to make this a film that would stand out for those reasons alone if not for the fine acting and cinematography that propel it to its stature as one of the finest frontier films of our time.
This is not the US frontier, but the Australian one. The Australian outback was a place far more unforgiving than much of our own West. When you remember that Australia was originally a place to which the United Kingdom shipped its excess and most incorrigible convicts and recognize that the outback was the place to which the most recalcitrant and anti-social of them were likely to flee, then you can see how the stage is set for some brutal confrontations between the authorities and settlers who want to civilize the land, and those who live by no law but their own. And instead of the Indians to deal with, Australia's settlers had the aborigines with whom to contend for lebensraum.
Here are some things to notice: the relentless shimmering heat, the constant swarms of flies, the sere landscape, the ramshackle nature of most structures (Captain Stanley's is the nicest), the omnipresent dust, the primitive nature of nearly everything and everyone including the abos, endemic racism, and the tendency to violence that seems to bubble just beneath the surface of nearly everyone, white man and abo alike. Notice how everyone rather grimly goes about their daily lives. In such an environment, there is little wonder that brutality reigned. Notice also how Nick Cave's inobtrusive score augments an overall feeling of oppression and menace in a landscape bursting with both.
As for the characters themselves, the acting is almost uniformly excellent. Even the stoic aborigine characters, while not saying much, do a fine job of lending an air of authenticity to the story. You might notice that The Proposition is entirely derivative and goes to the same well from which Peckinpah and Leone have imbibed many times before. In spite of that, John Hillcoat's film remains uniquely Australian and that's what gives it some of its appeal. If you can stomach the carnage, I highly recommend this one.",1197849600,,2389,4.886699507389163

This movie was made and set in Australia but the time frame is similar: around 1880. What's ""brutal"" about the story is the violence, bloodshed and language - but only in spots.

The language is odd in that the vocabulary of most of the people is above-average, but be warned there are a number of f-words. I question whether that word was around in the 19th century, but it's prevalent in this film. Actually, the violent scenes will be more offensive to viewers than the profanity. Like the profanity, however, the violence only comes in spurts. Most of the film has much calmer moments, surprisingly low-key.

One thing that is there throughout the 104 minutes is the excellent cinematography. This is a pretty film, nicely shot with some beautiful scenery and colors, stylish at times, too. To me, this was the best part of the movie. It's indeed a visual treat. Benoit Delholmme deservedly won several international awards for his camera-work in here.",1189987200,33,1119,4.822916666666667

The spectral Australian landscape is a counterpoint to the brutal human presence. The filming reminded me of Terrence Malick, whose films highlight the crazed behaviour of humans while nature's ebb and flow continues, indifferent to the bloodletting. Ray Winstone, as the man who 'will civilize the place' clings to civility while engaged in a nasty job, and Guy Pierce has some unpleasant business to attend to, including the stir- crazy character played by John Hurt. Emily Watson is wholesome and helpless in a landscape that must have been as if from another planet to the colonial brutes from England and Ireland. Riveting and glorious viewing, this is a stark, fly-infested view from down-under as it probably was back in the day.",1188777600,17,897,4.947019867549669

This is not just an action movie where guys run on the horses, shoot their guns and ride into a sunset.  This is a complex story about relationship between aborigines and white settlers, it is a morality tale and a story about is single man whose desire to ""civilize the land"" brings nothing but chaos and destruction even in his own family.  I am hoping that more filmmakers from Australia will pusue this genre.  Actors are haunting in the accuracy of the characters they portray.  The beauty of the land is overcome with the oppression of the heat.  It is as if flies, sun, dirt are all contributing to savagery of the people around it.

2468797,5,B000CPWDHQ,"I am not a fan of the Western; in fact I'm so not a fan that I had to be practically forced to watch this film despite the fact that I love both Danny Huston and Ray Winstone.  That said, `The Proposition' is so perfect it film that it breaks my top five of the year.  It's so engrossing, so breathtaking and so blisteringly real that one can't help but become completely invested into the story, the plot and the characters.  The performances by the entire cast are above and beyond brilliant, and the direction is superbly orchestrated.  Just about every facet of this film is brilliance, from the score to the cinematography to the captivating screenplay.

The plot follows a group of murderous brothers, Arthur, Charlie and Mike Burns who kill for the pure thrill of it.  When Charlie and Mike are captured Charlie makes a deal with the Captain for his and his younger brothers life.  Charlie is asked to kill his oldest brother Arthur, the mastermind behind the brother's murderous rampages.  He accepts the offer, and Mike is left in the Captain's hands until the job is done.  This is the proposition that starts the film and as the film progresses it builds upon each character so well, effortlessly drawing the audience into the plight of each.  As Charlie travels to find his brother he faces the decision of whether to slay him or join forces with him to overtake the Captain, and in Charlie's absence the Captain is left to battle his conscience and the strong will of the townsfolk who want to exact revenge for the rapes and murders on young Mike who it appears really had little to do with the happenings in the first place.

What really sets this masterpiece apart from almost every other film in recent memory is the commanding strength of the entire cast.  This truly is an actor's film, and each and every actor does such an orgasmic job with their performances.  Guy Pearce, an actor I never really developed a liking for, delivers his finest performance, very understated and nuanced and subtle performance.  In fact what makes each performance here so brilliant is that amidst the brutal and bloody backdrop each actor relishes in the subtleties of their characters providing the perfect compliment for the rampage taking place within scenes.  Emily Watson also delivers one fine performance as Captain Stanley's gentle wife, tortured herself by the aftermath of the Burns brother's disastrous actions and plagued by her good soul yet vengeful spirit.  Danny Huston, who plays Arthur Burns, delivers his finest performance to date.  This guy is truly one to watch.  He's given three of my favorite supporting performances in the past few years (`Birth', `The Constant Gardener' & `The Proposition') but here is where he finally grabs hold of his character and delves into his soul, developing someone truly evil, just completely and utterly infectious.

But, that said, his performance doesn't even come close to the brilliance that is Ray Winstone.  As Captain Stanley, Winstone evokes so much emotion, so much effortless truism.  When his character is first introduced he appears to ruthless, so harsh and in my eyes he appeared to be the outright villain of the film, but within moments it was made apparent that he was in fact the moral center of this film.  As he battles with his own conscience versus that of the town, and even that of his usually supportive wife we can read the frustration and inner agony writhing over his face.  As his wife pleads with him to take vengeance, as the town presses further down on him, as he watches in complete detachment the fruits of the town's persistence we can see this mans inner turmoil taking its toll.  What Ray Winstone does here is what every actor should hope to one day accomplish, and the fact that he was snubbed by the Academy in favor of mediocre work by DiCaprio and the sentimentally nominated O'Toole is just ridiculous and downright aggravating.  Forget Whitaker, Winstone gives hands down the best male performance of 2006.

So, in the end `The Proposition' may very well be my favorite film of 2006.  I'm still weighing out my final opinions but it's definitely cracked my top five and that's not something I would have ever expected.  What John Hillcoat has brilliantly been able to accomplish is create a epic moving drama set in the west complete with breathtaking action, brutal violence and above all else and beating heart that demands the audience emotional investment.  As I have already mentioned, `The Proposition' is downright cinematic perfection, from breathtaking direction, effortless camerawork, brilliant scripting and some of the most endearing performances to date all coming together to create a movie experience you won't soon forget, or therefore regret.",1186617600,14,4764,4.890547263681592

Ray Winstone as the captain that wants to bring civilization to the outback of Australia.  John Hurt has several memorable moments as the bounty hunter.

This movie shows what a great piece of art a Western can be.  The endless possibilities.  The wide open space.  The polychromatic visions and desert landscape.

A beautiful evocation of a time and a place, cinematically stunning, musically spare and poetic, unremitting in it's executions of the will of violence and the struggle of men.
But to me, The Proposition is a rumination on White Man's Burden, a fraught incursion into the moral morass of Australia's Aboriginal genocide and Christian hypocrisy, ignorance and fear. The disregard for the Aboriginies is pivotal to Arthur's (Danny Huston) madness, while Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) must toe a line, one which nobody seems able to comprehend, in pursuit of civilization. Biblical homage can't get too much closer than one brother's murder of another, and the paradoxical simplicity/majesty of the basic acts resonates vibrantly throughout The Proposition.
So, while I am less familiar with director John Hillcoat, I do know Nick Cave, so I can more easily attribute my visceral movements to his artistry, with no disregard to Hillcoat's direction. Nor any toward Guy Pearce, a chilling Huston or-(one of my absolute favorite actors)-Winstone.

2468801,4,B000CPWDHQ,"The Australian outback plays a pivotal role in this movie set in the 19th century Australia when law is far in between. The story is simple enough where Guy Pierce's character is given a proposition to kill his brother (leader of the pack that allegedly massacres a family and raping a woman pregnant with a child) within nine days so that he shall be given a pardon & to redeem his younger brother. And so the journey begins. There is a glimpse of racism of the time (and still does) when there's a discussion of Darwin and how ridicule the white people felt when they are compared to monkeys and to Aborigines.  The Police Chief with a constant headache is fervently trying to resolve the crime properly by stamping down upon the Gang whilst his Superior is keen to dispense quicky justice to appease the citizens.  This movie succeeds in creating a feeling of living on the edge and unpleasantness.  Swarms of fly are ever present, intense heat, loneliness of the outback. Headed by outstanding casts such as Emily Watson, John Hurt, Dany Houston, they portray a hostile outback where everyone fends for themselves and perhaps the desolation is driving people to madness &/or desolation. This is an outstanding movie that deserves to be seen on the big screen.  Nick Cave's music accompaniment to the Proposition really is rather appropriate indeed.  Overall, a very comprehensive movie that should have a bigger commercial success.  Here, Guy Pierce truly shows his versatility in different genres.

However, this film was not as good as I had thought it would be. Sure, it conveys the savagery and the grime of the Australian outback in the 18th century but the story plodded along and the climax of the film was quite disappointing.

With such an array of good actors and material, it could have been so much better. The story was written by Nick Cave, the Australian ""singer"" and dark lord of grumpy indie murder ballads.

2468804,4,B000CPWDHQ,"""The Proposition"" is a grim, atmospheric western set not on the American frontier but rather in the Australian outback of the 1880's.

Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) is a police officer sent from England to impose law and order on the largely uncivilized populace inhabiting that newly settled region of the world (his jurisdiction includes aborigine natives as well as the recently arrived whites).  Those orders set Stanley in direct opposition to the Burns Gang, a notorious band of thieves and cutthroats comprised of three Irish brothers who are suspected in the rape and murder of one of the most prominent and influential families in the territory.  After Stanley captures two of the men, he imprisons one - the weak, sniveling Mikey - and frees the other, Charlie (Guy Pearce), threatening to hang Mikey if Charlie fails to hunt down and kill the third brother, Arthur, purported to be the vile ringleader of the group.  Thus is set into motion a brutal, violent tale of revenge and justice that soaks the exquisite Australian landscape in generous helpings of blood and gore.

""The Proposition"" is not for the faint of heart or weak of stomach, as it literally rubs our noses in the violence it is portraying.  In vivid, unflinching detail, the movie captures the inhumanity and bloodshed perpetrated by the characters on one another throughout the course of the story.  Stanley is an unlikely central figure for the tale, since even though he begins as a hardnosed, unyielding stickler for law and order, he turns out, in the long run, to be one of the most reasoned and restrained players in the drama.  In fact, he faces intense opposition from the townsfolk for being too lenient with his prisoners and too slow in exacting justice for the horrible crimes committed.  Stanley, who is also deeply devoted to his loving wife, stands as a kind of transitional figure linking the barbarous past with the hopefully more ""civilized"" future of this continent uniquely tucked away in its own little corner of the world.

The second major character is Charlie, who has to decide between betraying his older brother by killing him in cold blood or letting his younger brother swing at the end of a rope if he doesn`t.  Unfortunately, Charlie is not nearly as fully developed a character as Stanley is, nor is his moral dilemma as clearly developed or dramatized either.  We don't get the sense that we know much about Charlie even after we have spent quite a bit of time with him which is a shame since his thought processes and actions are pivotal to understanding the outcome of the story.  Perhaps more successful is the portrayal of Stanley's wife, Martha (Emily Watson), who is torn between her innate compassion for humanity and her desire to have her dear friend's death avenged by the public execution of the men responsible for the heinous crime.

What distinguishes ""The Proposition"" from so many other westerns is its deliberate moral ambiguity, its recognition that people don't always fit into nicely wrapped packages of good and evil, and that fairness and justice are not always the clear-cut commodities we've been taught to believe they are from literature and movies.  And all this is done against a stark natural landscape that stands as a mute, indifferent witness to the insanity of the humans' actions.

Pearce, Watson and, especially, Winstone deliver remarkably restrained, understated performances as the three main characters caught up in the drama.  After all, with all the blood and carnage up there on the screen, the last thing the film needs is a bunch of over-emoting actors adding to the excess of it all.

""The Proposition"" is clearly not for everyone, but diehard Western aficionados would be remiss in not seeing it.",1175385600,5,3755,4.933333333333334

2468806,5,B000CPWDHQ,"I loved everything about this movie: the novelty of an Australian Western; the freshness of viewing racism from perspectives other than American blacks and whites (in this case, Aboriginal indigenous people vs. white colonialists); the absence of likeable characters- any virtue evidenced by Charlie Burns (Guy Pearce) and Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) was only due to the loathsomeness of those around them; and the pointless cycle of revenge killing.  This is the antithesis of a feel-good story, and depicts the moral relativity of an extreme environment.  The movie is extremely violent, but importantly, not pointlessly so; I'll take The Proposition's brutality over Scorsese's The Departed's any day of the week, for its realism, its appropriateness in context, and its evocation of sympathy.

This is largely a movie about setting, and about how a stark environment can beget an obdurate, stark people.  It's the late 19th Century Australian extreme version of how American cities bear witness to greater violence during particularly hot summers- in the Proposition, every day is sweltering, everyone is pissed, and everyone is violent.  The movie simply could not have done a better job of conveying that setting: the characters are so dirty you can almost smell them through the screen; Nick Cave's bleak musical score is hauntingly beautiful (Cave wrote the script as well); and the scenery is craggy, and the whole landscape looks like an overdeveloped photograph.  It's a beautiful combination, though, and I daresay without any proof that the movie is an authentic depiction of life in that area at that time.  A stunning film.",1173312000,2,1641,5.288461538461538
2468807,3,B000CPWDHQ,"I have no beef with the cast; they did a great job. And the setting can't be beat: lawless, savage Australian outback.

2468808,3,B000CPWDHQ,"Guy Pierce, one of three outlaw brothers, and pictured on the cover of the DVD, rarely speaks in this 'Western' outback tale of a sheriff struggling to keep his maintainence over a town seeking justice for crimes committed by the most vicious brother of the three, hiding in the hills, and sought by Pierce after the sheriff propositions him to kill this brother or lose the younger one in custody.

If you go in expecting a direct storyline that reveals the plot straight away, or a fast action Western with gun fights galore, you'll likely be disappointed by the intentionally slow pace of the film, which prefers to switch back and forth between the sheriff's dilema against an impatient town, and the brothers in the hills, which develops at a snails pace, since little about them is revealed throughout most of the film.

There are times it feels like nothing's happening, but for characters speaking to each other about vague story elements that have little consequence at the moment. This is a film that must be taken in once it is finished viewing as a whole, not in any one scene, which as said, seems too obscure to comprehend the value of alone.

Plenty of whispering, slow discussions amid some strong cinematography and acting that reveals the story very, very slowly... As a note, there are some bloody, short torture scenes of people screaming that injects some interest amidst the otherwise slow, grumbling story. For patient movie goers, I not being much of one enough to enjoy The Proposition, though still believing the performances are worthwhile.

2468809,5,B000CPWDHQ,"""The Proposition"" is less a linear drama than a prose poem. As scripted by Nick Cave, it does not develop according to any three-act structure, but rather seems to lurch wildly in different directions throughout, as if the rhythm of the story is dictated by the volatile passions of its characters-- characters that are, with only a notable pair of exceptions, all passion themselves. They are not nuanced; they react like kicked dogs. They rarely speak, and when they do, they speak only to express themselves, not to participate in any dialogue. They are as implacable and beyond appeal as the pitiless sun that scorches the barren sands of the Austrailian outback; a place which, through John Hillcoat's lens, becomes desolation itself.

These are all points to the credit of a remarkable film, which succeeds because its director knows the value of silence in an age when most are all too fearful of it. Look at ""The Good Shepard,"" for instance. The characters in that film never stop talking, but we don't care, as they have nothing to say. The central characters in ""The Proposition"" say almost nothing; they speak through their actions, and the result is astonishingly effective.

The story is almost Biblical in its brute simplicity and directness, and resonates like a tale from the Old Testament. It concerns four brothers, who share the name of Burns. The elder Burns, Arthur, is irredeemably brutal and nihilistic; his speech is that of an educated man, but his surroundings seem to have dulled whatever moral compass he might once have been directed by. The second Burns, Charles, is equally brutal but more focused in his rages; he is lethal when provoked, whereas Arthur is merely lethal. The third Burns, Samuel, acts much like Arthur, but his evil deeds are mitigated to some degree by the fact that he may be retarded. The youngest Burns, Danny, is certainly retarded; he does as those around him do because he lacks the capacity to do otherwise.

All four of these men are identified at the outset of the drama as killers; none of them are innocent of the crimes for which they are sought. When the film begins, Charles and Danny are in the hands of an English captain who has perceived a division among the brothers, and endeavors to work it to his own advantage. Specifically, he threatens to execute Danny unless Charles kills Arthur; in which case, the remaining brothers will be pardoned. This is the proposition of the title.

A lesser film would provide endless scenes in which Charles considers aloud the moral dilemma he has been placed in with a convenient supporting character to act as a foil, or at least provide a voice-over narration. ""The Proposition"" relies upon no such devices. Charles treks into the outback in search of his brother, alone, impassive, bereft of any discernable psychological preoccupations. He will find Arthur, and he will act decisively in some way. How, we cannot know until the proper stimulus is given, and he reacts to it. The mysterious, single-minded purposefulness from which he acts reminds one of John Wayne's lone wolf in in ""The Searchers,"" although Charles is, if anything, even more sullen and withdrawn than Wayne's character.

The outback, we are led to believe, breeds such people as this. We meet a bounty hunter, who confesses that for him, God has evaporated; we sense that such divine authority has no place in a land where Arthur Burns' maniacal rages remain unchecked. When the focus of the film shifts to the English captain, who believes he can achieve peace by playing the Burns brothers against one another, and his wife, who is still under the delusion that only good things happen to good people, we cringe, because we know how vulnerable these people are. They are dealing with a force in the Burns gang that they cannot comprehend, that they cannot control, and which sweeps down and destroys whatever it sees fit at a moment's notice, like some hellish sandstorm.

This vision is startling and immensely powerful; the failure of man to civilize his natural surroundings and ultimately being destroyed by them has been the subject of countless works of valuable and compelling literature, Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" being perhaps most valuable of them all. Cormac McCarthy's ""Blood Meridian"" comes to mind as well, with its desert-spawned criminal protagonists wreaking havoc near the Mexican border before the American west was won. However, while McCarthy's vision was often diluted by what seemed like cruelty for its own sake, ""The Proposition"" does not stray into such territory. Its violence is graphic, but never seems excessive. Even the gory finale unfolds as we imagine it would have to, rather than as some geek preoccupied with bloodshed might wish it would. When people react to the violence in ""The Proposition,"" they're not reacting to the quantity of it, but to the honesty and inescapability of it. ""Blood Diamond"" contains more instances of violence, and depicts it more graphically than does ""The Proposition,"" but only the violence in the latter film leaves you shaken.

From beginning to end, ""The Proposition"" consistently strikes the right notes. Calling it a ""revisionist"" Western, I think, misses the point. ""The Proposition"" is a proud heir to the tradition of Ford, Leone and Peckinpah, and such brutal early Eastwood projects as ""High Plains Drifter."" It does not apologize, as such ""revisionist"" efforts as ""Unforgiven"" do, for being what it is: a story about brutal men in a brutal land. When the Burns brothers settle their respective scores at the film's climax, one is immensely grateful for the courageous efforts of not only Cave and Hillcoat, but the actors, the cinematographers, and the musical composers, who allow the finished product of the film to match Cave's original vision. This is a film that has the audacity to be about nothing more or less than what it is about, that does not compromise, that does not cheat. The story ends as it had to, the way it had to, for the reasons it had to.

It will be remembered.",1171324800,4,6055,4.929411764705883
2468810,5,B000CPWDHQ,"The Proposition, written by songwriter, Nick Cave, uses the conventions of the Western genre to wrestle with ideas of good and evil (somewhat standard in the recent strain of revisionist Westerns) but more interestingly, uses the form to also indict the colonialist mission in Australia.  The story is set in motion when a lawman bent on capturing three outlaw brothers makes a deal with the middle of the three - bring back the oldest one or the youngest, who he has in custody, will hang. The lawman, played by Ray Winstone, echoes the film's tagline, when he proclaims emphatically ""this land will be civilized."" Yet the remainder of the film makes it abundantly clear that what the European settlers have brought to the country is a far cry from civilization.

The contrast between the worlds of the colonialists and the colonized is effectively evoked in a scene where Ray Winstone's character tells his Aboriginal servant to be on his way as he settles on his porch, rifle in hand, waiting for the inevitably brutal attack from the outlaws that will follow.  He wishes the Aboriginal man, ""Merry Christmas,"" at which point the latter removes his shoes and socks at the gate of the yard, returns the good wishes with a hint of irony in his voice and walks away barefoot.  The camera lingers on the shoes briefly, letting us know that we are meant to see something beyond the surface in this moment.  One interpretation is that the shoes are a connection to ""civilization"" but in this case, a civilization that doesn't fit into the world it has been introduced to.  Later another Aboriginal man, who is serving as a tracker for a group of lawmen, calls attention to the barbarism of the Europeans when he comments to one of the lawmen, ""strange mob, you whities,"" as they observe the remaining members of the troop standing around a tree, trying to urinate on each other.  Like Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man, which also uses the Western genre to critique the treatment of indigenous people, The Proposition gives a voice to the oppressed and does it in a way that's not merely politically correct.

The Proposition is an incredibly violent yet somehow subtle film. Themes are suggested but (excuse the pun) nothing is black and white. Over 100 minutes the moral struggles of its complex characters are explored and time feels like it has passed too quickly. The film's violence feels essential to the narrative for lending verisimilitude but also for adding urgency to the stakes involved for its characters. Not a scene is wasted. The images are lyrical, the visual style, brisk and the cinematography, breathtaking. The casting and performances are all perfect, with Danny Huston and John Hurt being particularly outstanding.

This is a brilliant film that's been unjustly ignored, but not surprisingly so, considering its underlying critical stance. Rent, buy or borrow it, but make sure you see it.

The DVD extras (interviews with the cast, director and screenwriter) are also excellent, providing valuable insight into the background and themes of the film.",1170374400,,3061,4.937743190661479
2468811,5,B000CPWDHQ,"""Suppose I said that I could give you the chance to expunge the guilt beneath which you so clearly labour"" so said Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) to Charlie Burns (Guy Pearce). Of all the ""suppositions"", this one sentence encapsulates all that can said of each and every major character in the film.

Moral ambuiguity aside, Charlie Burns is faced with a devil's alternative. The vague allegory that he is plunging headlong into Dante's Inferno, also known as the wild west of the Australian outback, is also considered as a journey in the heart of darkness, Conrad-style. Only this time, the relationship between the hunter and the hunted is made more complex and familial.

Choosing between the love of his family and his own life, he values the life and welfare of his younger brother, Mikey, even more than his own. Thus, he accepted the suicide mission without much protest. In terms of priority, he values his own life than that of his flamboyant older brother, Arthur, whom he was sent to terminate ""with extreme prejuidice"".

Guy Pearce exudes a sense of brood and existentialism over the course of the beautifully photographed film. Danny Huston played Arthur Burns as a sort of a mythic Kurtz-like character who proceeds his monstrous deeds with a bestial instinct, but like an animal, know when the end is nigh. Emily Watson is also given substantial screentime, adding dimension to a female character in an otherwise, machismo film. The director John Hillcoat is to be applauded for giving a holistic overall development of all characters in the film. The addition of an erratic soundtrack that adds to the dread and abysmal situation in the outback severely elevates the film to a mythic proportion.",1170201600,11,1712,4.958188153310105

Although there are a few overwrought sequences and missteps along the way, this is overall quality stuff and is heartily recommended.

2468813,5,B000CPWDHQ,"I've seen The Proposition twice now and can honestly say. this is one of the best westerns ever! What a story, can you imagine being served a deal like that. Words really won't give this film the dues it deserves, this is visceral, emotional film making at it's absolute best. The story is uncompromisng, unapologetic, and wrought with realism.

Also of particular interest is the setting, so rarely have we seen the Australian outback in it's early turn of the century form. It was an uncivilized, back woods continent primarily used as a penal colony. John Hillcoat makes us feel every tumbleweed that passes by. You almost feel like you haven't bathed in a month while watching this film. We see how tough life was back then, and how it took it's toll on even decent men. The pain that Guy Pearce carries with him throughout, is so heart felt, that I get a lump in my throat thinking about his situation. Danny Huston is so f@^*in' marvelous, what an actor! This guy exudes confidence and commands respect reminiscent of early De Niro, Pacino, Duvall etc..He creates a monster that is so filled with human conflict, anger and even love, that he instantly humanizes Arthur and shows you the weakness that is at the core of his evil.

This film works on so many levels that it would probably take several more viewings in order to totally absorb how these lives function and the dichotomy of human relationships. A brilliant film, not for sensitive viewers or anyone who likes hollywood style fast-editing. This film moves on it's own pace and does not conform to any set genre, it's pure non-Hollywood entertainment.

Highly recommended!",1168560000,2,1639,4.784452296819788
2468814,5,B000CPWDHQ,"Coming up with any description for `The Proposition' will be precarious for deterring an audience, and that's a shame. Startlingly brutal, this film takes place in the Outback of Australia during the 1880's, so it really should be called an Eastern, rather than a Western. A revenge story with a vengeance, Captain Morris (Ray Winstone) vows, ""I will civilize this land."" He's the British equivalent of the partakers of Manifest Destiny and the typical new sheriff, trying to bring law and order in the dry, forsaken land. His iron hand makes the cure seem worse than the lawless contagion.

His obsession is to kill or obtain Arthur Burns. After a huge shoot out, he has Charlie Burns (Guy Pearce) captured. He makes him a proposition. To spare his younger brother, he must find and kill his older brother, Arthur, within nine days, before the arrival of Christmas*. We're never shown what the Burns brothers allegedly did, but, unlike the horror we're presented with for nearly two hours of the movie, it is too horrible to show. (They're accused of raping a pregnant woman.) Capt. Morris does everything to get his man. Besides putting his brother in a desperate situation, he lets a rapist go and kills a native aborigine just to name a couple of moral compromises. Just when we think the Captain is the pit of established barbarism, we see him cry when he is denounced by an even tougher superior who chastises him for his desperate rampage of justice.

The film goes back and forth to all of the major fronts: The Burns' family in their exile, the aborigines, who keep a native tradition of reciprocity for slain tribal members; and the law and order head office. All are victims of terrible violence. Gruesome to the fore, the acts of bottles smashing on heads, toes blown to a stub, public floggings, and stranglings--just to name a few--nearly reinvent violence. Presented with graphic detail, anguished writhing, and blood-curdling screams, 'The Proposition' can hardly be accused of glorifying violence. All but the most perverse will find the whole movie a deterrent that makes one hold on to dear life. Indeed, the dialogue is so beautifully eloquent, we feel like we are often given the modern equivalent of Shakespeare. Amazingly, it never comes across as artificial or out of character, even when they speak poetically about the beauty of nature and the fragility of existence. And it's all done in the spare laconic Western tradition. The characters still retain their gritty determination as well as their rough Aussie and Irish immigrant dialects.** Some of the best, reflective scenes are heard with the echoed whispering of Charlie's innermost thoughts.

`The Proposition' for all its bloodshed is an excellent adventure with enough time to pause and reflect on the beauty and brevity of life and nature when it's at its dearest. Despite all the gore, the violence is hardly a Western arcade. It's not just your typical shoot out at the Queensland Corral. We can almost feel their pain and are presented a tragedy of unrelenting vengeance and violence. Besides excellent tension brought from the acting, the cinematography and the directing are awesome, making us gasp, like watching the cinematography of the Outback sunsets. Inspiring and remarkably well constructed, 'The Proposition' is a must-see for movie buffs.

2468820,3,B000CPWDHQ,"There are no heroes in this film.  Throughout the long history of the Western, the films themselves were mostly set in the unforgiving terrain of the American West, or at the very least, on a comfortable Hollywood sound stage.  When one watches ""The Proposition"" you get the feeling that the actors are suffering just as much as the characters they are portraying in the harsh Australian outback.  The producers should receive accolades for filming on location in the outback itself, thus giving the film a gritty realism lacking from other modern westerns.  Although set in Australia, the earmarks of the new-western have all been incorporated into the story:  1.) The blending of right and wrong until no one really knows the difference.  2.) The presence of aboriginals in place of the traditional Native Americans  3.) The conflicted protoganist who is torn between doing the `right thing' or the sort of `right thing.'  In such movies as ""Dances With Wolves"" John Dunbar's choice was clear in the end with what path to follow.  In this film, we are never really sure what path Charlie Burns will follow, and even in the end, when the apparent conflict has been resolved, we are still not sure.",1165017600,,1198,4.862068965517241
2468821,5,B000CPWDHQ,"Words come to mind we we think of movies. When someone asks, ""How'd you like it,"" or  ""What'd ya think about it?"" we immediately formulate a quick response, then fire it at them. Usually, ""It was Good"" ""It was Great"" ""Loved it!"" ""Want my friggin money back!"" and other such exclamations, you fill in the blank. But when I think of The Proposition, a movie I watched a few days ago, and am still haunted by it, I cant think of just one brief summation; but if I did I would have to say, The Proposition is incredible.

How refreshing it is to see a NEW western. Growing up I would sit with my dad and watch the Duke, Eastwood, Ward Bond, Stewart, etcetera etcetera, and loved them. John Ford had massive Landscapes, Anthony Mann had his 73, Cooper was the only one in town brave enough to give a dang, and Dean Martin proved he wasn't just ""the straight man"" (Katie Elder). Probably the most obvious reason that westerns succeeded so long in the middle to early years of Hollywood was the clear-cut sense of Good and Bad... ok and Ugly. I always hoped that another would resurface, since the only good ones in recent years were Tombstone, Open Range and Unforgiven - and the mediocre Wyatt Earp and The Quick and the Dead. Others have come and gone, some really good, but amazingly... and prepare yourself... The Proposition has a punch that pales most all movies in general. This truly is an amazing work.

The proposition is this, a man and his little brother are captured. He is told by the captain who captured them that if he can kill their murdering/rapist older brother, he will release them. Sounds like a simple story huh? Believe me, there are moments that you don't know how to feel. Villains turn out to be heroes, and heroes debate which side they want to be on. Sometimes, I intentionally don't go into grave detail about the plot, nor the characters, nor the actors that play them (Hint LOTR), because on occasion that's as much part of the surprise of the viewing experience. But bear in mind, The Proposition is violent. I have never mentioned violence before, if that tells you anything. But, none of it is untrue to the rough nature of the story.

I also would like to mention, Kudos to the brilliant, unusual soundtrack. (Click my name to read review) It sets an eerie tone and complements the hellish visuals.

I could literally go on and on, but just know I give this movie the s~a~o~s mark of approval, and I think that this movie will be haunting me for a while to come.",1164758400,4,2493,4.4823788546255505

2468823,5,B000CPWDHQ,"In the special feature documentary about how the Proposition was made, Danny Huston explains why he didn't want to say too much (best wishes) to the actors while filming because he didn't want to jinx the movie. He recalled what Lauren Bacall had said to keep his father, John Huston, from jinxing Treasure of Sierra Madre- Shut up, John, it is just a western.

The Proposition is going to haunt me for a long time. Nick Cave and John Hillcoat tell a bold tale in the best of ways - letting you figure out where the bad and the good are and telling a history that needs telling. Delhomme's photography is beautiful in how it sorts out the natural beauty and the psychological tone of the film - using that stark light to disorient our tradional ideas of what might happen and the pictures of the land and the faces to carry the plot out. Cave's music and whispering narration are alluring, frightening, exciting, and amazingly effective for transporting the imagination out of our comfort zones (through grime, racism, marital and fraternal love, and survival on the brink of humanity) through the plot.

When good actors take on a story like this, you have to be curious. Guy Pearce expands his range to playing an Irish desperado. Who would have thought that he could go from drag queen to LA cop to this stringy-haired cowboy so easily. I love the marriage of the Stanleys played by Winterstone and Watson.  Danny Huston never used to be on my radar before; now he is. John Hurt is another interesting surprise as a grizzled, well-travelled bounty hunter.  The script is so well written that it must have been a dream to explore who these characters were and the world in which they lived.

The Proposition is in the same vein of westerns as High Noon, The Unforgiven and probably most importantly Breaker Morant. I might not deliberately watch this again because the story is so intense and forensic in its violence, but I would find it hard to walk away if I happened upon it on television or at the house of a friend.  That sound track also might tempt my mind and fingers to seek it out. That stark white light and that majestic Australian landscape and human scape has indellibly marked my mind. There is a shamonism in this kind of movie when its elements can help shake your soul with the base notes of a dijereedoo, Celtic fiddle and the percussion of horse's hoofs.",1163289600,2,2377,4.59433962264151
2468824,3,B000CPWDHQ,"The Proposition has the kind of premise that Anthony Mann would have loved - wild colonial boy Guy Pearce is released into the outback to kill his psychotic older brother Danny Huston to save his younger brother from the noose by Ray Winstone's policeman determined to civilize his godforsaken corner of 19th century Australia. Unfortunately it never quite makes enough of it. Coming to it after both the excessive praise and the equally excessive backlash I wasn't disappointed, although the film does have problems. The most obvious is that screenwriter Nick Cave and director John Hillcoat become so enamoured of Winstone's character that he dominates the film to the detriment of not only the other players but the film itself: while there's none of his scenes that should be cut, neither Pearce nor Huston get nearly as much screentime. As a result, the central moral dilemma is kept firmly backstage and Huston's nature is only really hinted at rather than explored, although the violence, when it comes, is convincingly blunt. But at times it's almost as if Coppola had decided that instead on concentrating on Martin Sheen's killer in Apocalypse Now he'd make a film about the officer who sends him out to terminate with extreme prejudice instead.

It's a film with great things going for it - there's some fine dialogue, Hillcoat has a great visual sense and a striking eye for the Scope frame, while an underplayed Winstone is superb - but one that never becomes great.",1163203200,13,1479,4.9397590361445785
2468825,3,B000CPWDHQ,"I was very intrigued by the raw reality of this film--the general filth of the Australian equivalent of the Old West, the stark violence that is not glamorized in any way.

This film bears comparison to the brooding spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone, though it avoids the over-romanticism of the brooding hero.  And there seem to be clear hints at Jim Jarmusch's _Dead Man_ with Johnny Depp, at the very least through its use of bare, historic imagery paired with a very modern soundtrack, though this film stays rooted in its ground situation and doesn't turn towards the metaphysical the way Jarmusch does.

This film poses the great moral situations of great film, those great choices that define character or philosophy.  In this film, Charlie Burns is given the choice of letting his young, childish brother Mike swing from a noose, or killing his older, bloodlust-filled brother Arthur.  This choice is given to him by Captain Stanley, the man who has Mike in prison and who is out to tame this feral land.

This film is full of binary choices--man or animal, innocence or knowledge, violence or love.  Arthur has dug himself into the outback and is considered by the aboriginies to be a dog on two legs.  Yet he prizes family and finds a worse life to be one lived unloved and alone.  Captain Stanley has brought his wife with him to this untamed land so that she can be his bastion of civilization, his zone of comfort.  The people of the settlement in Captain Stanley's jurisdiction are calling out for justice on Mike for the rape and murder of a pregnant woman, yet they are not ready for the brutality of the justice they seek.

There are a lot of good ideas going on in _The Proposition_, but somehow the movie didn't pull together at the end in a way that satisfied all that it had promised along the way.  It was not that the film seemed to want to turn its philosophies towards open dissatisfaction to comment on the nature of existence.  It just seems that the stark nature chosen for the film ended up constricting its ability to address these dualities in a satisfying way.  There are many things to like about this film, but as a complete package it left me a little wanting.",1163116800,6,2196,4.611825192802057
2468826,4,B000CPWDHQ,"The Proposition is an appallingly violent/juicy (delete as applicable) story about an English police chief (Ray Winstone)'s attempts to bring a trio of Irish roughnecks to justice after a brutal slaying. Despite ii being infinitely preferable to 90% of what passes for the Top 50 movies currently availbale in the local video store, there are a few minor niggles. The good sides: the story moves along at a good pace, the script - courtesy of Goth rockstar/novellist Nick Cave - is assuringly competent and 'gothy', the realism is refreshing and tangy (dental hygiene wasn't what it is today); the acting performances - particularly of head hoodlum Arthur Burns and his young sidekick, Samuel - are spot on; the photography is really good and the fly-blown Australian outback makes an excellent setting for the story and indeed, enhances the uncompromising tone of the movie. The music is good too, with focus on moody although one of the leitmotifs, a poem (presumably from the pen of Mr. Cave), which repeats itself like a kind of mantra (something about riders being as dry as a bone) is either brilliant poetry or indecipherable twaddle depending on the extent to which you prepared to suspend your disbelief.

Which brings us to the shortcomings. I thought that both Ray Winstone and Guy Pearce were slightly wooden and over-ponderous in their roles as police chief and bad-guy-with-a-conscience respectively. Whether this is due to any technical limitations as actors or whether the director's work in this area was found lacking is something for the critics to decide. No acting limitations are apparent in John Hurt, however, who makes a superb cameo appearance as the toothpaste-challenged, cod-intellectual bounty hunter. Credit to Emily Watson, too, who does her best to inject a third-dimension into her role as the long-suffering, sexually and emotionally frustrated wife of the police chief. The amount of violence and bad language is jaw-dropping, and makes Reservoir Dogs look like Chitty Chitty Bang Bang in comparison. I personally don't mind it, but persons of a sensitive disposition may find it all a bit much.

2468832,5,B000CPWDHQ,"This 2005 Australian film hit limited theatres in the US last May without much fanfare. Too bad for the filmmakers, because they could have probably done a lot better than a $2 million box office if had they marketed the movie a little bit better. And too bad for the American movie going public, because a much larger audience should have been treated to one of the best movies of the past 2 years.

The first comparison that comes to mind is Eastwood's The Unforgiven. But rest assured, The Proposition is no imitation. It is a classic Western that ranks right up there with the best in the genre. The Proposition is realistic. It's suspenseful. It's brutal. It's well acted. It's well directed (by little known John Hillcoat).

In the 1880s, after the rape/murder of an Australian Outback family by Arthur Burns, his two brothers and their pals Sam and Two Bob, Captain Stanley (popular character-actor Ray Winstone) captures Charlie Burns and Mikey Burns and offers Charlie ""The Proposition"": Charges will be dropped against Charlie and his young, impressionable brother Mikey if Charlie hunts down and kills his older brother Arthur. But there is a stipulation: Charlie has to find and kill Arthur in 9 days or Mikey will be hung on Christmas Day.

Why would Stanley make a Proposition that results in the just deserts of only one of the rapist/murderers? Because Arthur is the misanthrope even though Arthur would argue that he and his band are not misanthropes at all...they're just family!

2468834,5,B000CPWDHQ,"`The Proposition' was such a nice surprise I'm still reeling off of the experience.  I am not a fan of the western in general.  I've seen a few that I've enjoyed but for the most part they don't even begin to interest me.  To be completely honest I didn't have the highest of hopes for this film either, and the only reason I picked it up was the fact that Ray Winstone's performance was so highly lauded.  I took a chance, and for once I can honestly say it paid off.  The film starts off with a bang, gun shots being fired in every direction, people dying left and right and then in walks Winstone.  From the outset it appears that Winstone's character (Captain Morris Stanley) is the villain, for when he sits across from Charlie Burns (Guy Pearce) and his younger brother Mike (Richard Wilson) Ray has so much anger and bitterness etched across his face he just reeks of evil.

But...that is not the case.  Charlie and his brother Mike are part of the Burns gang, their older brother Arthur (the brilliant Danny Huston) being the most gruesome and detestable brother, and they are wanted for the rape and murder of a young woman.  Captain Stanley makes a deal with Charlie.  If Charlie will hunt down and kill his own brother then the charges against him and his younger brother will be dropped.  Stanley proceeds to hold Mike captive as leverage and sends Charlie on his man hunt.

In the meantime the town grows restless and intolerable with Captain Stanley who they feel is being unrealistic.  They are upset that he has let Charlie go free and are insistent that they execute Mike so that this woman's murder may be avenged.  Even the Captain's own wife Martha (Emily Watson) is demanding blood, as is the town's first citizen Eden Fletcher (David Wenham) and the pressure is weighing heavy on Stanley.  The praise that Ray Winstone has received do to this performance is extremely justifiable and in my opinion he deserves an Oscar nod this year (the beginning of this year has just been full of brilliant performances it's a shame most of not all may be forgotten come December).  Another standout here is Danny Huston who just further proves that he is an actor on the verge of greatness.  This is one of the most involving and engrossing westerns I've ever seen (thanks in large part to John Hillcoat's brilliant direction) and has opened my eyes to a form of cinema I've avoided for so long.",1160697600,4,2404,4.579439252336448

The old Australian ouback with a justice seeking ""sheriff' and a couple of really bad brothers reeking havoc. Because the word proposition was uttered once , it still didn't seem to fit the movie for a title to me. A rougher word word would have worked better.

  That being said the film holds the adult viewers attention with a strange feel that is shockingly real. Intense, wicked, welldone acting all around. I realize the film was a bit ""artsy"" but some scenes were stretched out too long. The violence fit the occasions in a unique way and really was gruesome.

2468836,4,B000CPWDHQ,"""The Proposition"" is a fable set in the Australian outback of the late 19th century -a Western from Down Under. With its homesteading, gold rushes, outlaws, idealists, and clashes between European and native cultures, Australia is an ideal setting for a Western. Its social intricacies and harsh realities are similar to those in the U.S. at the same time, and the landscape is equally parched but more beautiful than the American Southwest. At the request of director John Hillcoat, Australian musician Nick Cave wrote his first screenplay for this film as well as its score.

The massacre of a homesteading family by the outlaw Burns Gang has put Captain Morris Stanley (Ray Winstone), the British military officer in charge of law enforcement in the nearby town, under considerable pressure to bring the gang to justice. Realizing that this will require more inventive methods than a respectable man would normally entertain, Stanley makes Charlie Burns (Guy Pearce) a proposition: Stanley will let Charlie go and hold his simple-minded teenaged brother Mikey (Richard Wilson) in custody. Mikey will be executed on Christmas Day unless Charlie can find and kill his charismatic brother Arthur Burns (Danny Huston), the leader of the gang whom Stanley calls ""a monster and an abomination"". Charlie has 9 days to kill Arthur or young Mikey will hang. Meanwhile, the town's first citizen Eden Fletcher (David Wenham) is demanding blood.

Though it is imperfect, ""The Proposition"" is certainly thought-provoking. I found some of the characters contrived and theatrical. And the film alludes to a lot of aboriginal issues and frontier history that Australian audiences will know more about than Americans. But the story raises basic questions of human adaptation and what it means to be ""civilized"". Captain Stanley and his genteel wife Martha (Emily Watson) have been cast into an infernal environment of foreign culture, lawlessness, ambition, ineptitude, horrible violence and oppressive heat. ""I will civilize this place,"" Stanley proclaims. Though he resists abandoning his British concept of justice, perhaps naively, Stanley's attempt to adapt to his new environment instigates the events of the film: He makes Charlie Burns a Proposition.

Stanley's gracious wife Martha represents civilization in this anarchic land. Her well-kept home and gentle manner seem to imply higher ideals than harsh reality will accept. But her insistence upon vengeance for her murdered friend and her willingness to exploit her husband's devotion to get it betray a crack in civilization's faade. Moviegoers may feel that Hollywood has run its course with Westerns and has little left to say. I wonder if charting new territory in American Westerns is simply too politically risky. But I have high hopes for Australian ""Westerns"". The land is beautiful, and the moral ambiguities and ethical dilemmas posed by disparate cultures and purposes are ripe for a screenwriter's picking. I hope ""The Proposition"" will be part of a large, successful genre in Australian filmmaking.

The DVD (First Look Pictures 2006): ""Behind the Scenes"" is a documentary in 5 parts: In ""Making Of"" (27 min), director John Hillcoat and writer Nick Cave talk about their inspiration for the story, the cast discusses their characters, the environment in Australia of the 1880s, and filming in the outback. ""Info & Script"" (6 min) has some redundancies with ""Making Of"", but, in addition, the actors talk about the script. In ""Characters"" (11 min), the cast elaborates a little more on their roles. ""Research and History"" (18 min) is about preparation, authenticity, and production design. The conversation in ""Themes"" (8 min) is with John Hillcoat and Nick Cave. There is an audio commentary with director John Hillcoat and writer/composer Nick Cave. Cave comments on the music and how he structured the story. Hillcoat discusses locations, sets, actors, historical references, and the impact of the heat on filming. There is also a Photo Gallery of 18 production stills and behind-the-scenes photos, and there are some Deleted Scenes.

2468838,5,B000CPWDHQ,"THE PROPOSITION is one of the more satisfying 'westerns' to come along in years.  Just as Serge Leone created the spaghetti westerns in Italy and set a precedent that American films were to follow, so director John Hillcoat and writer Nick Cave turn the back country of 1880s Australia into a devastating impressive work of grit, dirt, lawlessness and hardship of living in the early days of Australia's distance from Britain. This is an art piece sculpted from brilliant actors, some of the finest photography on the screens today, and a film score that is breathtakingly beautiful.

Shot almost entirely in shades of umber and sienna THE PROPOSITION is the tale of a gang of brothers - Charlie Burns (Guy Pearce), Mikey Burns (Richard Wilson) and hooligan and evil Arthur Burns (Danny Huston) - who have wrecked havoc on a frontier town under the eye of police Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone), married to the lovely Martha Stanley (Emily Watson), and the extremes to which the law will go to capture the worst of the perpetrators, Arthur.  After a gruesome shoot out Charlie and Mikey are captured, but Captain Stanley propositions Charlie to bring in his loathsome brother Arthur to spare young brother Mike from the gallows on Christmas.  Charlie rides out to find Arthur, encounters a bounty hunter Jellon Lamb (a brilliant tour de force role for John Hurt), mixes with the aborigines, and ultimately confronts Arthur.  And that is quite enough of the story to relate in brief.

It is the quality of the film that takes your breath away.  Not only is the acting utterly first rate by the entire large cast, but the rhapsody of imagery created by the camera of Benot Delhomme and the haunting score from the pens of Nick Cave and Warren Ellis give us a frame after glowing frame gallery of some of the most beautiful film ever made.  This is a movie so rich in story and production that it is bound to become considered as one of the greats of the western ilk.  Highly recommended (for those who can tolerate a lot of violence!).

2468839,4,B000CPWDHQ,"A riveting powerful Australian western ""The Proposition"" recalls the operatic grandeur of Sam Peckinpah's best work. Outlaws Charlie (Guy Pearce) and teenage Mikey Burns (Richard Wilson) are captured by outback police Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone). Both face hanging but Stanley offers Charlie a deal; if Charlie hunts down and kills his psychotic brother Arthur, he'll spare their lives and pardon them. The duo split with Arthur (Danny Huston) after he led an attack on homesteaders raping and killing the members of a family and he's managed to elude the authorities and bounty hunters successfully by hiding in the mountains. If Charlie doesn't return by Christmas he'll have Mickey's death on his conscience. Stanley finds dealing with the elements and the violence of a frontier increasingly isolates him from his wife (Emily Watson) and threatens to destroy his life.

Filled with some powerful performances ""The Proposition"" won't be for everyone. It's a violent western with few characters that have any socially redeeming value. Every one of the actors makes of the most of their roles with brooding Guy Pearce and Ray Winstone doing terrific work. Danny Huston's Arthur is a combination of psychopath/philosopher/poet as he lays waste to everything he touches including his own family. Emily Watson also should also be mentioned for playing a character who's life has largely been sheltered by her husband and family. She must come to grips with a tragedy that has unbalanced her life and emotions.

""The Proposition"" receives a stunning transfer that beautifully captures the devastated landscape of rural Australia. The rustic colors deep rich yellows of the sandy landscape vividly come to life in this top notch DVD. The Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1 soundtracks both sound terrific particularly during the action sequences and the conclusion of the film. You'll feel like you're lost in this barren landscape with bullets whizzing past your ears. There's also a very good 2.0 stereo soundtrack as well.

We get a wealth of special features for such a low profile film. The audio commentary by director Hillcoat and musician/writer Nick Cave is filled with trivia about the time, inspiration and difficulty in achieving the authentic look and feel of 1880's Australia. We also get a number of deleted scenes that fill in the background on the film (one of which probably should have been included as it helps to clarify Charlie's guilt and feelings of remorse). There are also five featurettes on the making of the movie which total about  75 minutes. The first focuses on the making of the film including background on the genesis of Nick Cave's script. We also get separate sections on ""Characters"" where the actor's give their feelings about the roles they play, ""Research"" which looks into the time the film is set and a section on the themes explored in the film where the cast and crew give their take on the ultimate meaning of ""The Proposition"". We also get four trailers although curiously not one for this film.

A powerful film and one of the best to glide briefly into theaters earlier in the year ""The Proposition"" is beautifully rendered in this top notch transfer. With solid extras complex performances (Winstone, Huston, Pearce and Watson) this is one proposition you'll have a hard time turning down.",1159315200,8,3334,5.087751371115174
2468840,4,B000CPWDHQ,"This is a brutal and bleak Western set in Australia.  The Burns brothers Arthur (Danny Huston), Charlie (Guy Pearce), and Mike(Richard Wilson) have just raped and killed a pregnant woman; and two of the Burns brothers have just been captured by Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) after a big shootout.  Captain Stanley gives Charlie a proposition; within 9 days he is to go find his brother Arthur and bring him to the authorities;  in exchange, Mike won't be hanged on Christmas day and Charlie will receive a pardon.  Charlie sets off and goes find his brother;  meanwhile the town and the mayor in charge is upset in hearing about his proposition and wants justice to be done.  Capt. Stanley is caught in a terrible situation;  meanwhile the Burns brother reunited and they go back to the town to find their little brother Mikey;  the movie ends with a violent confrontation and a surprise ending.

Many of the reviewers have done a great job in explaining the main story line, so I won't repeat that.  What I would like to describe are the interesting aspects of this Western that are novel and seldom seen in other Westerns:

a) The clash with being ""civilized"" in a region raised on violence --  Capt. Stanley wishes to civilize the town; that's why he proposes a proposition instead of dealing brutally with the Burns brothers.  Captain Stanley and his wife want to be civilized, but it is like swimming upstream in a raging river -- the townspeople live on violence and demand brutal justice.

Australia is depicted in a very bleak light. It is a violent frontier even more extreme than that of the U.S.  There is no law, people live by the gun, and townspeople demand swift and brutal justice.  There is violence done to the aborigines by the white folk, and death is everywhere along with all the flies.  It is a wilderness of death.

b) Multi-dimensional character development

Both the ""good"" guys and the ""bad"" guys display good and bad characteristics.

The authorities (whom we would normally associate as the good guys) are clearly not good.  They are brutal and bloodthirsty.  They make foolish decisions which have tragic consequences.  Captain Stanley is a tragic man; he wants to do what is good but he is not allowed to make a civilized proposition due to the pressure made by the mayor and the bloodthirsty deputies.  Captain Stanley dearly loves his wife Martha and wishes to protect her from all the evil but he is barely able to do that.

The Burns brothers, despite being psychopathic killers, have their own ""moral"" code and have a close knit sense of family and brotherhood.  The older brother, Arthur, shows deep affection for his younger brothers and want to have close family ties.  It's just that Arthur gets crazy when he gets mad and then goes into a killing frenzy.  Charlie is a man born in the wrong family and with the wrong brothers.  He is clearly bothered by the grisly murders his brothers committed and he is a man with a conscience.

Even the most psychopathic of the Burns gang (Samuel, a demented teenager who does most of the raping) can spout eloquent poetry and sing a touching song.

I agree with reviewers who note the similarities between this movie and ""Unforgiven"" -- both are revisionist Westerns, both deal with the themes of retribution and revenge, and the characters display both good/evil aspects.  This movie is much bleaker though than ""Unforgiven.""

I thought that John Hillcoat did a great job of directing this movie.  The script and the storytelling were great.  The movie is very grisly in its violence but it is not gratuitous or excessively gory.

I enjoyed the 5 part special features on the Making of the Movie, which features good interviews with the director and the cast members.

If you want to watch an interesting Western rich in character development, watch this one.  Don't watch it if you're depressed though.  The violence may be too intense for people under 13.",1159315200,3,3939,4.770710059171598

2468842,5,B000CPWDHQ,"Historically, and from a character perspective, there's still mining to be done in western films, and THE PROPOSITION gives us a great sense of both. Aussie director John Hillcoat delves into Australia in the 1880s, telling about the bloody lawlessness and aboriginal prejudices.

The story centers around the outlaw Burns brothers, Charlie (Guy Pearce, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL), Mike (DECK DOGZ) and Arthur (Danny Huston, THE CONSTANT GARDNER). When Charlie and Mike are caught by local lawman Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone, COLD MOUNTAIN), Charlie is pulled aside and given a distasteful proposition: kill your brother Arthur and Mike will live. Charlie loves Mike dearly and hardly knows his other brother, Arthur. He grudgingly accepts the terms but it quickly becomes clear that he's unsure what to do. Is the killing of one family member in order to save another morally apprehensible? What if your moral boundaries are skewed?

Charlie rides off to find his brother in the searing Australian Outback.

Meanwhile, back in town, Captain Stanley is having great difficulty controlling its citizens once they learn one of the dreaded Burns brothers is in the local jail. A powerful bureaucrat named Eden Fletcher (David Wenham, THE LORD OF THE RINGS) demands swift justice. He orders that Mike Burns be lashed 100 times. Knowing that Mike probably won't survive this, but also battling feelings his lovely wife Martha (Emily Watson, GOSFORD PARK) has about the crimes Mike has committed, Captain Stanley is forced to give in to the township's demands.

Back in the Outback, Charlie finally runs into his twisted brother and comes face-to-face with his worst fears: killing someone of his own flesh and blood. Can he do it? Should he do it?

The word ""epic"" has been on the lips of many reviewers, but epic may be too big a term for this flick. It is enjoyable, and has sweeping views and great acting (even John Hurt makes a soulful appearance as a perverse bounty hunter), but it doesn't approach films such as LAWRENCE OF ARABIA or DOCTOR ZHIVAGO in scope. And that's okay. There are many films out there that are still very enjoyable but don't meet the epic criteria.

That the western film has been done for nearly a century might make one think that it's dying out as a genre. But no. THE THREE BURIALS OF MELQUAIDES ESTRADA and UNFORGIVEN are two of the more recent favorites that prove there's still life out there for the western. And The Proposition is another excellent example that it's still got cinematic value.",1159142400,27,2521,4.962085308056872
2468843,4,B000CPWDHQ,"'The Proposition' is one of the dirtiest, bleakest films I've ever seen, and certainly the darkest western, far surpassing films like 'The Wild Bunch' or 'Unforgiven' in this respect.  On the downside, 'The Proposition' is sometimes so obsessed with creating a mood of desolation that it forgets to have anything happen.  This makes the film a bit of a disappointment, as it gets so much right but lets us down quite a bit on the simple story telling level.  Still, it succeeds enough in these other respects that it's more than worthwhile, but you can't help but wonder how great this movie could've been if it had a bit more going for it with the plot.  Of course, I think the extreme desolation of the film is partially rooted in it's slow pace and occasional uneventfulness, so perhaps they couldn't have punched up the plot w/o weakening the mood.  I dunno.  Still, you could hope for more.

'The Proposition' centers around the three Burns brothers in 1880's Australia.  They've recently been involved in a brutal murder and rape, and the two younger ones have been captured by Capt. Stanley.  Stanley, however, isn't satisfied: Mikey is young and a simpleton, obviously not truly responsible for his actions, and Charlie seems remorseful, perhaps also corrupted by association.  The leader, clearly, is Arthur, who is still at large with a cadre of killers.  So, Stanley proposes that he release Charlie, and that Charlie's goes and kills Arthur, earning a pardon for both him and Mikey.  If Charlie does not return with Arthur dead by Christmas, Mikey will be hanged.

This central plot actually takes fairly little screen time, up until the very end.  Charlie finds Arthur fairly quickly, but he, quite reasonably, doesn't act immediately.  He doesn't know what to do.  Arthur is, after all, his brother.  The film focuses on Capt. Stanley as much, if not more than the Burns brothers.  He is committed, as he famously states, to 'civilize this land.'  This will not be easy, as he is not a monster, and this is a very monstrous land.  He also wishes to protect his wife from the horrors of the country, but they're so numerous that this is not a simple task, the problem compounded by the fact that Eliza Hopkins, the murdered woman, was a friend of hers.  Furthermore, one of Stanley's superiors is displeased with Stanley's deal, and he will fight against Stanley in honoring it.  Stanley is at the heart of the film, a generally good man stuck in a hopeless situation, and his position is somewhat reflected in Charlie's dilemma as well.  (Charlie isn't good, however, though he is better than most others around him, so it comes to much the same thing.)

This is a gorgeous and gruesome film.  The Australian desert is certainly reminiscent of the American, but it's somehow more foreboding and majestic, and director Hillcoat uses it beautifully.  The film is as much about showing us the sun-scorched desert as it is anything else, so I hope you have a taste for it.  I'd dare say that this film uses a desert locale better than any other film I can think of.  Westerns are often interested in the clash of civilization with savagery, and 'The Proposition' shows this particularly well, largely due to the specific setting.  The characters siding with law and order come from a Victorian-English background, an era which is at least perceived as being especially distant and obsessed with social mores, so the contrast is especially powerful.

The desert is also filled with death and violence; the buzzing of flies is omnipresent, unknown bodies scatter the scenery.  This is perhaps one of the most brutally violent films I've ever seen.  That's not to say it's one of the goriest films I've seen, though it's definitely got moments like that, intensity and gore are not the same thing. (Indeed they're often contrary to one another, as gore usually turns into impersonal spectacle.)  Scenes such as the lengthy scourging and a remorseless stomping murder have a sort of brute intensity rarely matched elsewhere.  Needless to say, this film is not for the faint of heart.

Performances are strong across the board.  Guy Pearce, as Charlie, usually gets top billing, though he is perhaps one of the less memorable characters.  He honestly exists more as a plot device than a person.  Still, I like Pearce in general and he generates a certain amount of sympathy for his character even though he doesn't tell us much about himself.  Ray Winstone's Capt. Stanley is more striking, and he's a truly sympathetic, almost tragic figure, as he works for his impossible tasks of controlling the land and protecting his wife.  Emily Watson is also good as Martha Stanley, powerfully conveying the sort of horrified disbelief that overcomes her as she comes to see what life is really like there.  Finally, John Hurt is memorable as a crazed, drunken bounty hunter also after Arthur.  He's quite hammy, but he's still got real menace about him, and adds a bit of life to the picture.

While the film is, as a whole, a bit low on action, it comes to life quite effectively at the end.  I don't dare go into specifics, but it becomes quite intense, probably all the more so because of the slowness of the earlier scenes.  It's a long buildup, but it proves to be worth it.

I haven't done this film much justice in this review.  It's quite a unique experience.  You just have to watch it.  If you wanna see the dankest, dreariest western around, this one's for you.

Grade: B+

Guy simply had to lay off bathing for a few days and grow his hair out to blend in perfectly with frontier Australia.  Nick Cave, who is an unusual singer/songwriter in his own right, has penned a harsh recreation of nineteenth-century existence on the red continent.  Mr. Cave has also provided an excellent soundtrack that lingers over uniquely Australian phenomena like the eerie cauterwaul of a Kookaburra, or a harsh, squealing didgeridoo riff that goes right down your spine.

You may find similarities to Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" in the movie, as Charlie Burns (Pearce) searches for Arthur, his psychopathic  brother (Danny Huston.)  Arthur Burns holds a similar role to Kurtz in ""Heart of Darkness,"" and if you're not finding the comparison familiar, try Apocalypse Now, and substitute Brando for Kurtz.

Winstone is obsessed with bringing law and order to this frontier. This means bringing in a deadly gang of brothers lead by the evil oldest brother Arthur. He captures the middle and youngest brother and offers the middle brother Guy Pierce 'the proposition'. This is to save his young simple minded brother by killing his evil psychopath older brother.

I found this movie to be gritty, dirty and very violent. But this is a gritty,dirty and violent time.

This is not Butch and Sundance with the lovable ""bad guys"", this is a very visceral, very violent, very beautiful movie with characters that use there own internal justifications to give them the right to commit this violence. This is a story set in a time and place where the value of an ideal, whether it be family or a better world, is more valuable than life. So how can a movie that seems to have no one to root for be a great movie let alone, watchable?  The answer is hard to find, but if you give it a chance, you cannot turn your eyes from the screen and the people on it.  Ray Winstone, Guy Pearce and Danny Huston are dead on in their roles.  Winstone's Captain Stanley is a man that finds solace in his home and the different world that it represents to him.  His flaw is that he has given himself the impossible task of trying to make the land and people in his new country fit his ideal, and he is willing to go to almost any length to get there.  This leads to the proposition that he gives to Charlie Burns(Guy Pearce)to choose one brother over the other, Arthur, the psychotic older brother played by Danny Huston or Mikey, the dim-witted younger brother.  Given this you as a viewer can know that there can be no happy ending.  No one can win.  But what you can know is that the story getting there is intelligent, and superbly crafted.
