7968100,2,B00006G8FG,"""What Killed The Mega Beasts?"" is a documentary that explores three theories of how the large mega-fauna that once inhabited our planet vanished in various locales around the globe.  Think about it: When was the last time you saw a Columbian Mammoth, Marsupial Lion or Elephant Bird wander past your living room picture window?  The three theories are dubbed: Chill that denotes climate change as the culprit; Ill that denotes an all-infecting virus as the source; and Kill that believes that human hunters were the cause.

I know, of course, 'tis not good to overly criticize a team for making the film that they made rather than the movie that you wish that they had made.  Having said that, separating this question into these three categories is pretty much the same as separating the biological origins of the world and its species into Old Earth Creationism, Young Earth Creationism and Evolution.  One particular theory (theory in a scientific sense) has more credence and credibility than the other two.

As the film progresses, this becomes clearer by the frame.  Despite the passionate advocacy of their proponents, two of the theories have little basis in actual factual findings, and the logical objections to them are strong ones.  In the narration, the makers of the film themselves admit major flaws in both of these theories.  There is even a bit near the end where they attempt to expand the definition of Kill to include environmental degradation by humans to create a fourth compromise position.

There, also, appears to be an elephant in the room that no-one wants to acknowledge.  'Tis hard to imagine that scientists would be reluctant to blame Caucasians of European descent for hunting the Carolina Parakeet and the Passenger Pigeon to extinction.  Yet, there appears to be a reluctance to blame non-white, non-European peoples, whom I gather are supposed to all be viewed as nature lovers who spent all their time hugging furry and feathered, little animals, as having been capable of doing the same to other species.  Strikes me as a bit of a double standard.

Despite the first stated flaw in the conception of the movie, it does provide a great deal of useful information, and it gives a look at the currents theories' being debated.  Not only that, but it, also, gives a chance to hear the thoughts of some of the best biologists-paleontologists and scientists who are working the world today: Tim Flannery and Steve Wroe of Australia, Richard Holdaway of New Zealand and Gary Haynes and Paul Martin of North America.

It is always a delight to hear Tim Flannery speak, and Steve Wroe has the best description of a Marsupial Lion ever.  The CGI is pretty good, and it is well integrated with scenes in which modern humans and animals interact with the computer critters.

Because of that, with the qualifications entailed above, this film does rate a watch.  It is probably one to rent and not to buy.  It, also, should be noted that the DVD contains only this documentary and no other special features or previews.

7968101,3,B00006G8FG,"The ""Overkill"" theory, the hypothesis that humans hunted many large animals, mostly mammals, to extinction in the past 50,000 years is discussed extensively by Peter D. Ward in his ""Rivers in Time"", esp. Chapter 10  ""Overkill"".  The evidence is rather compelling, if not overwhelming.  Humans arrived in Australia ca 35-50,000 years ago, finding perhaps 50 genera of marsupials, many quite large.  In only 5000 years these animals were extinct. Only four marsupials remain.  A similar situation unfolded in New Zealand.  Humans arriving in the many South Pacific islands found no large animals, but their arrival frequently resulted in the extinction of 50% of native animals and many plant species.  Polynesian arrival at Hawaii in ca. 300 A.D. quickly led to extinction of 50% of native bird species.  A similar story is that of Madagascar, the world's fourth largest island, where 80% of species were unique.
In the Americas, the arrival of the Clovis people ca. 12,000 years ago, at the end of the last glaciation, resulted in the extinction of all native large mammals, some 35 of 55 genera. Only 12 large mammals now exist, all arriving with humans over the land bridge with Asia.  In South America, 46 mammal genera went extinct.  While kill sites are rare and poorly informative, it seems certain that Clovis people hunted mastodons, mammoths, large sloths, wooly rhino, for food, resulting in their scavengers and predators also going extinct.  They did so in only 1-2,000 years, so that by the differentiation of the Clovis into the hundreds of American Indian tribes, ca. 10,000 years ago, all such native mammals were gone.
Elsewhere, Peter Ward writes that some have said that humans in North America have replaced a billion animals with 300 million humans, reducing the biodiversity of Planet Earth.  The 7 billion humans on Earth are acting similarly to the entire planet.
This is an important book and I urge everyone with any interest to read it.

7968102,5,B00006G8FG,"I found ""What Killed the Mega Beasts?"" to be very well done, interesting enough to hold the attention of middle school and high school age children, but keeping its focus on the underlying scientific question of the pressures leading to extinction.",1113264000,3,248,5.073170731707317
7968103,2,B00006G8FG,"""What Killed the Mega-Beasts?"" is a Discovery Channel production.  As an introduction some of to the giant mammals (and in one instance, bird) of the Plesticene it may have some interest, but it is flawed in far too many ways.
First: the suppositions. 1) There are a class of animals generally known as Mega-Beasts: this is merely a sensationalist term for large creatures as diverse as reptiles, mammals, birds; carnivores, herbivores, omnivores, that have existed since the time of the dinosaurs.  (The special concentrates on only a few of these--the wooly mammoth/mastodon, the giant beaver, the giant lemur, the giant ground sloth, the marsupial lion and the moa.)  2)  These giant beasts have all suffered a single, individual fate--namely, extinction.  Of course, Africa and Asia still have a number of ""Mega-Beasts"" surviving, although perhaps precariously, into the present day, including elephants, rhinos, hippos, and tigers.  3) The extinction of the creatures considered, although it occured the world over and over the span of at least 50,000 years, has a single, or at least common, cause.  This point infuriated me--there's no reason at all, or certainly no reason shown on this program--to believe that the cause of the moa's extinction 700 years ago in New Zealand is identical to the cause of the extinction of the Giant Beaver in North America 20,000 years ago.  And while the individual scientists (with one rather remarkable exception) are fairly careful not to make this claim, the narration repeatedly implies it ad nauseum.  Only in the last 15 minutes is any consideration given to a complex of factors as the cause for extinction, and then again, it's all or nothing.  So while there is some interesting material (I had not been familiar with the Giant Lemur of Madagascar), overall the scientific content is dubious due to the sensationalist oversimplifications of the narration.
Second, the production:  Again, in an effort to make the material ""sexy"", the three main theories are given rhyming names: kill, chill, and ill.  (KIll being the idea that mankind hunted these creatures to extinction; chill being climatic change--including in one case not a chill but a drought of 1000 years; and ill being a ""hyperplague"" which one scientist insisted must the the sole cause of all the extinctions in spite of there being no evidence yet discovered at all to back up the theory.)  This rhyme was repeated so often with such melodrama that my family started making up new theories--""pill"", the idea that the megabeasts became crazed drug addicts and overdosed to extinction; ""Krill"", the megabeasts were done in by tiny zooplankton; and ""Dill"", the megabeasts were pickled to extinction.  The Discovery Channel intended this to be broadcast on television with commercial breaks but apparently they have no respect for their audience's attention span.  After EVERY break there was a ""back announcement"" of the program's thesis.  That's undoubtedly useful if you fall asleep, walk in late, or have Alzheimer's; but on a DVD it's infuriating.
Third: the science.  That ""ill"" was considered at all, with this total lack of evidence, again speaks to the sensationalist aspect of the production.  While certainly viruses and bacteria do jump species barriers--right now in Asia we are experiencing a bird flu which jumps from various birds to humans, and just today it's been found in pigs--this would have to be an unusually virulent species jumper with a fondness for large animals and no taste for small ones which furthermore no longer exists.  Anthrax-like diseases have surely played roles in decimating, stressing, or even extinguishing particular animal populations over history, but a single disease rampant over 50,000 years, active up until 700 years ago but now no longer apparently on the planet strains my credulity.
Fourth: the animation.  What Killed the Mega-Beasts clearly follows on the footsteps of the BBC's Walking with Prehistoric Beasts, but does so with a cheaper budget...or at least, those are the results.  The animations are  not, as the descriptions say, ""the most rivetingly realistic computer animation available""--for the most part they aren't good at all given today's extremely high standards.  Particularly poor are the mixed animation/live action shots: a modern crocodile takes a swipe at an animated giant lemur, and a marsupial lion attacks two primitive men.  The latter scene had my 13 year old daughter yelling ""FAKE!"" at the TV.  'Nuff said.
I've been interested in these odd, gigantic creatures since I was a child and first got a plastic giant ground sloth mixed in with my dinosaurs, so I'm really glad that they are finally getting the attention they deserve.  But your money will be much better spent on Walking with Prehistoric Beasts.  If you already have that, you will be disappointed with this.",1076025600,48,4867,5.1668789808917195
