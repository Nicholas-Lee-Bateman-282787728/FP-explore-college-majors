8198944,4,B000R5NZ1Y,Spatter Farm is so low buget and over the top. If you've ever seen this movie you will never forget it. This movie pushes the limits. I had long wished they would release this film on DVD.However I feel I have to warn people that this DVD edition is not complete. This is a a watered down cut version. I own the original uncut version on VHS.The DVD edition is missing several key scenes. Must be the Palonia brothers have become wimps in there old age. Why they would sensor this DVD edition is beyond me. Don't toss your VHS tapes out. It's the only way to see this movie uncut. If you can find the VHS edition grab it.,1351641600,7,621,4.183333333333334
8198945,1,B000R5NZ1Y,"I think this move was BY FAR the worst EVER.  I've seen some bad movies too!  The special effects...well, they were AWFUL.  At one point there's a decapitation and the head that falls off it like a pinata type paper head.  OMG, it is SOOOO STUPID.  NOt even the stupid you laugh to, the stupid you wanna just keep your DVD remote in hand so you can fast forward a lot of the stupid boring stuff, and there's plenty of it.  Really, do not buy this unless you like films made with a camcorder and a 10.00 budget.",1203465600,3,510,4.153061224489796
8198946,5,B000R5NZ1Y,"Here's another great release from the fine folks at Camp Motion Pictures.  This time, they unearthed ""Splatter Farm"", a camcorder shot full length from the 80s.  I think I heard that the filmakers were only 17 or so when they shot it!  If you liked Camp's previous releases (Woodchipper Massacre, Ghoul School, etc) you'll love this one.  My suggestion for a great Friday night is this DVD and a pizza from your local gas station--you can just pretend that you rented Splatter Farm in all it's big-box glory at the gas station ""rental wall"".",1186704000,17,541,4.723404255319149
