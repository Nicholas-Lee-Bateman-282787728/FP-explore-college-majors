8635375,3,B00HS85PXO,"Over a decade ago, the Italian Exploitation genres were being well represented by such companies as Media Blasters, Blue Underground, and No Shame films as fans were introduced to complete , uncut and widescreen versions of Horror, Crime and Pepla photoplays.  Now Raro Video has taken up the mantle set up by those companies by releasing important Euro Crime titles for the first time .  Their Fernando Di Leo crime sets are fabulous and now this month no less than four titles will be released to fans of which this one, Director Franco Prosperi's 'MEET HIM AND DIE' aka 'PRONTO AD UCCIDERE '-1976 is the first.  Although its a great showcase for star Ray Lovelock who would go on to star in another film for Prosperi, the underrated  1978' s 'THE LAST HOUSE ON THE BEACH' aka 'LA SETTIMA DONNA' , it emerges as a derivative yarn involving undercover drug operations surrounded by some exciting car chases and double crosses.  Lovelock ,who fans saw as a secondary character in some early films of Director Umberto Lenzi and Fernando Di Leo and who was also front and center in Director Jorge Grau's excellent Zombie Horror 'LET SLEEPING CORPSES LIE' aka 'THE LIVING DEAD AT THE MANCHESTER MORGUE'-1975, plays his anti hero role no holds barred straight.  He is joined by American actor Martin Balsam as a capo in the drug trade and gorgeous Elke Sommer coming off some US titles and some great Horror films of Director Mario Bava.  Unfortunately, she does not have much to do here.  The photography by Roberto D'Ettere Piazzoli is excellent and the music by Ubaldo Continiello mixes Lovelock's folky tunes with some progressive motifs.  I viewed the DVD and it is gorgeous in a nice 1.85 transfer in Italian with English subtitles.  The disc has a 6 minute intro by writer/filmmaker Mike Malloy as its only extra. He also wrote the booklet included with the DVD.  Recommended  to fans of Euro crime thrillers, just be sure to know there are other titles out there that are much better than this but you can do know wrong in having this in your collections.  I'm looking forward to Raro Video's other titles.  Just keep em' coming!",1397865600,4,2133,4.745257452574526
8635376,5,B00HS85PXO,"Raro strikes again!  We are fortunate to have a company like Raro in this day and age that brings to light these beautiful Italian films of the past.  The quality of the blu ray, its packaging, and its one extra (a video introduction by Mike Malloy, an author) are all first-class, as usual.  The film has suffered a few minor damage marks in one spot, but otherwise is remarkably preserved.

This film stars Ray Lovelock, who plays a policeman who goes undercover in part to avenge himself against a couple of thugs/robbers who shot and crippled his mother (while she is trying to prevent him from drawing his gun?  Nice, mom!).  He is ostensibly out to break up the drug ring that these thieves belong to, and Martin Balsam plays one of the drug bosses, and Ray gets into his gang during a prison breakout and subsequent doings.  Down the road a bit (literally) we meet up with Elke Sommer as the ""secretary"" of another drug underboss, and she turns out to have more to do with the plot than one might expect.

This film almost got four stars from me, because frankly the plot is full of holes, but for once the folksy theme song is not completely horrible (kind of catchy, in fact), the action sequences made me realize the Italians were at least on par with Americans in this regard (but the collateral damage is much better!  Machine gun innocent bystanders!  Why not?), and the cinematography is first rate and of course you have Ray Lovelock in a starring role, and Elke Sommer always raises a film by one star for me, because she's beautiful and has a charm all her own.

Be sure to watch the ""extras"" to see the Mike Malloy interview/introduction.  It's very funny, entertaining, and informative.  He points out this was one of two films signing on Ray Lovelock as the star, since Ray was up to this point usually the sidekick or some other supporting player. He also gives a pronunciation guide for the term poliziotteschi and related terms, though of course I am still confused.  Malloy points out as well that at this time there were, confusingly, two directors with the same name (Franco Prosperi!).  This Prosperi's other best known film may be ""Last House on the Beach,"" which also has Ray Lovelock in it (La Settima Donna - 1978).

You can't go wrong with a Raro film.  Highly recommended.",1396656000,5,2305,4.596577017114915
