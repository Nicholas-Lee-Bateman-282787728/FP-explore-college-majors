1846648,5,B00008G91Q,Real easy to follow.  Yoga always helps me to relax.  Peggy does a great job on demonstrating the various yoga positions.  Well-done. Five stars.,1111363200,17,145,4.958333333333333
1846649,3,B00008G91Q,"yoga is good for focus and concentration, but sometimes certain yoga teachers don't get their points across effectively...peggy does not have the""it"" factor that i consider a tv instructor need, she is just blah, not the best like these reviews said...she lacks positive energy, and this workout show be more defined as a senoir citizen wokrout, not one for obess or overly heavy people, they will struggle with it....not for me!",1102636800,16,429,5.056338028169014
1846650,5,B00008G91Q,"I initially purchased this for my 85 yr old mother.  She's having trouble with flexibility and balance, and I thought this might help her.  Before I sent it to her, I thought I'd better try it!

I typically work out with weights and on a treadmill.  I've done jazzercise, pilates and tae bo over the last few years.  I consider myself pretty physically fit.  HOWEVER, I've only tried yoga once or twice, so I would definitely consider myself a beginner there.  I liked how Peggy led the exercises, and I was relaxed at times and very challenged at other times (e.g. keeping up with the sun salutations).  I'm on line right now because I'm going to KEEP the copy I have, so I need to buy another for my mom!",1096329600,133,706,4.376923076923077
1846651,5,B00008G91Q,"Yoga may be the most advanced system of stretching and toning every developed. Yoga postures have the added advantage of increasing your flexibility and range-of-motion and strengthening your muscles and tendons. ~Stephen Cherniske

After a trip to India, Peggy Cappy became interested in yoga. She practiced yoga for eight years and then decided to share her practice with others. She then began to work with students of all ages. The ""Yoga for the rest of Us"" video/DVD was created after she worked with senior citizens and realized the long-term benefits of a yoga practice.

Now you can learn to do yoga at any age. Peggy uses a chair and covers a number of basic yoga positions. She carefully leads her students through the exercises and each student shows a different level of flexibility and strength.

I found this three 20-minute session practice to be healing, comforting, enjoyable and completely relaxing. If you are at an advanced level of yoga, this series of restorative poses could be a calming break from a demanding schedule or a way to reach a deep level of relaxation through a more focused and soothing workout. There are also a variety of exercises designed to improve joint flexibility that do not require you to do a yoga pose. You can literally sit in a chair and reach your arms in various directions or lift your legs and move your feet in various directions to release the stress of everyday life.

The benefits of yoga are many and Peggy shows you how you can create more flexibility, increase muscle strength and balance your body through stretching. You will experience Mountain Pose, a Warrior Balance pose you can adjust to your level and Sun Salutations, which are modified with a chair. If you choose not to use a chair, you can follow one of the students showing the intermediate poses.

Peggy Cappy has a comforting teaching style and no matter what level you are at in your yoga practice, I think you can benefit from the results. I have rarely felt so relaxed after doing a yoga video/DVD. I can also do this DVD on days when I have lower energy and about an hour later, I feel renewed and healed. There is a focus on breathing, which is so needed when you are tired and stressed. After doing yoga for a number of months you will start to notice a decrease in pain in your body and your body will have a new level of strength which then allows you to more easily walk up stairs, get out of bed without as much stiffness in your joints, climb in and out of a bathtub or even walk with improved posture.

1846652,5,B00008G91Q,"This is an excellent yoga video for a person who is older and/or out of shape. I had never tried yoga and when I had chronic back and neck problems I bought a bunch of yoga videos and books that promised to help me. All claimed to be aimed at beginners and very gentle. This is the only one that was true to all its promises. I have been using it daily for about 3 weeks, it helped immediately and I now look forward to it. It is especially nice as it is broken into 3 separate 20 minute segments that each has a focus. There is never an excuse for not having enough time. Definitely worth the price.",1090281600,325,600,4.050420168067227
1846653,4,B00008G91Q,"For a student of the Indian classical dance like me, this DVD proved quite helpful, especially the breathing instructions, although I would prefer to see some more spiritual explanations (yoga is not aerobics, after all!), and the psychological meaning and effect of the postures.
Peggy Cappy's presentation is very clear, and covers the basics. I particularly liked the Sun Salutations series, as these are practised by all professional Bharatanatyam dancers, who have to produce rather complex postures. I know I will never be as flexible and as agile as the young professional dancers, and I will hardly ever dance as effortlessly and gracefully as Medha Hari in her DVD, but Peggy Cappy's excercises will make you stay fit and healthy, if this is what really matters for an amateur dancer like me.",1084665600,29,801,5.075757575757576
1846654,5,B00008G91Q,"This was a wonderful discovery that has really transformed my entire life.  It proved to be much more useful to me than the Pilates Beginning Mat Workout  and the Living Yoga  tapes I had gotten because I used to be fairly glued to the couch due to my weight. But this low-impact and low-stress approach to physical fitness has really created a whole new world for me to live my life in now with tremendous opportunities for self-expression and fulfillment.  With this as a building block for physical change, I was able to move onto a great new diet approach with South Beach, and subsequently my husband and I found new sparks in our intimate life with the aid of the magnificent ""New Sex Now"" video training -- an experience that really got our hearts pounding like never before.  All of these life-transforming products come with heartfelt thanks and the highest recommendations.  Life is too short to waste it sitting on a couch watching the world pass you by.  Do something to make your world a better place!",1078358400,84,1014,4.662921348314606
1846655,5,B00008G91Q,"I saw Peggy Cappy on Public Television during the December 2003 fund drive.  I was impressed with her ability to teach yoga to a diverse group of students.  The class is primarily attended by persons over the age of 50 years that have limited mobility. Peggy uses chairs to enable students to stay safely on their feet while attempting unfamiliar ways of moving their bodies. The video covers most of the basic standing poses (tree, triangle, warrior I and II, downward facing dog, upward facing dog as well as a simple sun salutation).  this is a must have for yoga teachers and for all others that have joint stiffness, limited mobility (because of age, infimity or weight).

1846699,3,B00008G91Q,"I already have one of Peggy Cappy's DVDs (Easy Yoga for Arthritis), and so bought this one without concern.  I am a little disappointed in it.  It moves slowly, not unusual for a yoga tape, but the absence of music throughout the entire DVD (with one exception) gives a feeling of extreme low energy and dragging disinterest. While my first Peggy Cappy DVD also did not have music in the workout, her presentation was somewhat more animated, and so helped to mitigate the missing music. The one place where she does insert music, is on the 20-minute commercial at the end of the tape. That part is very well done, as a matter of fact much better than the actual workout.

Section 1 (20 minutes) is breathing exercises and warm up. I most likely will never, or very rarely, use this.
Section 2 (15 minutes) is balance exercises. This is the part that salvaged this DVD for me.
Section 3 (15 minutes) is sun salutations & relaxation. I can get these on many of my other DVDs, and would not have purchased this one for that purpose only.",1441411200,2,1034,4.48936170212766

1846701,5,B00008G91Q,"Rented this DVD from my library, and now I'm going to buy it.  (It's also available on Prime Instant Video, but I want to have the DVD for my own library).  There is also a 3 minute clip available on YouTube. Peggy has a very calming, encouraging voice.  I am a senior - 68 yrs - and a pinched sciatic nerve causes weakness in my right leg.  I became concerned that my balance was becoming affected.  I believe this workout will help to strengthen my legs and increase balance, as well as  strengthening my hips.  There are four other people in this video with Peggy.  The viewer can choose which person to follow, depending on his/her ability.  Use a chair, or not, it's up to you.  You may need a chair for some poses, but not for others, depending on your strength and ability.  You can use it as a beginner, and then, as you gain strength, you can continue to use the video, following the more advanced poses.  From the back of the DVD case:  ""Presented in three 20 minute segments that can be done separately or as a complete one-hour workout.""  First segment is warm-up stretches and breathing exercises.  Second, standing yoga poses, all of which can be done with the help of a chair.  Last section includes sun salutations and easy exercises for relaxation.",1439424000,13,1265,4.506607929515418

Since I am a newbie to yoga and not too flexible, I have chosen to do the yoga using a chair. I plan to do away with the chair as my strength and balance increase.

Then, one day by chance, I turned on my tv and there was Peggy Cappy advertising one of her many yoga programs. I watched, I really liked her style, and I promptly ordered some of her dvds. That was about three years ago, and I am still doing her yoga programs, and now, her meditation cds-I feel better than I have 'ever' felt in years!

I want an actual yoga workout, with real yoga poses, done slowly and explained well. But Cappy's routine is fast, much too elementary and doesn't carefully explain the poses before entering into them. There were four actual yoga poses (all rushed through) included in the routine; plus the sun salutation - which is done much too quickly for beginners and the elderly. The rest of the dvd is Cappy promoting yoga and herself. I was very disappointed and won't purchase any more of her dvd's.",1355184000,21,673,4.616666666666666

Yoga for the Rest of Us is great for those us us who have physical limitations and want easy, gentle yoga. It is good for beginners, too. It helps with my fibromyalgia pain, too.

I enjoy Peggy Cappy as a yoga instructor. She has a wonderful delivery about her and I can see why her students rave about her in the last segment where they talk about what yoga has done for them.

I did some research and found that that this pose could put strain on the upper neck.  I am disappointed that she does not say this on her video.

Other reviewers have pointed out how easy it is to follow her instructions, how inspiring it is to see students of varying shapes, sizes and ages, and how very nice it is too see multiple variations, so I don't need to mention that (oops, guess I did anyway).  I wish I'd stumbled across this 12 years ago when my mother first came home after her stroke - although there are many poses she wouldn't have been able to do, I think I could've gotten her to do the seated head/neck, shoulder, hand/arm & leg/feet (the latter two with just one arm/leg) as well as the breathing, and they would've benefited her greatly.

1846847,5,B00008G91Q,"I like Peggy Cappy's ""Yoga for the Rest of Us"" best of dozens of yoga dvds that I have tried. I'm 68 and have been doing yoga regularly for only about a year, so younger or more experienced people may prefer other dvds, but for me this one works for several reasons. First, it is clear. Peggy Cappy speaks clearly and slowly so I can follow each move easily. Second, the visual demonstration includes four students each of whom may present a slightly different variation on the exercise. Third, it is engaging. I have watched many yoga dvds that fail to engage the viewer because they move so quickly with so little articulation that they clearly are designed either for very experienced users or for people who are generally quite physically motivated but also not very verbal. I like Peggy Cappy because she gives lucid explanations and proceeds at a pace that older or less experienced people can follow.

Two final features make this dvd one that works well for me. First, it is divided into three 20 minute sections which can be performed separately or in one hour-long session. This makes it easy for me to do one part or the whole sequence depending on my schedule. Finally, and most importantly, Peggy Cappy stresses lots of wonderful stretches that I have not found in any other yoga dvd. She pays attention especially to arms, wrists, hands, fingers and legs, feet, ankles. In an older person, these extremities can become very stiff and lose pliability. Peggy Cappy's attention to stretching these parts of the body has helped me to regain flexibility and to feel really good. I highly recommend this dvd.",1291507200,28,1616,4.750889679715303

It is certainly not a video for the ""professional"" yoga student but perfect for those with limited capabilities or those who want good stretching routines.

The 3 different, about 20 minute segments, are perfect.  The viewer can do as much or as little as they want.  The first segment is perfect for viewing before bedtime. It is relaxing and soothing.

Most of the DVD is at a very slow pace, very easy to follow - in fact, if you're familiar with some of the exercises, you may get a little impatient. Then you get to the sun salutations, and if you're not familiar with them, it's really not possible to execute them. I have watched them three times now, and there is no slow-motion explanataion for the novice. I'm familiar with some of the yoga stretches from aerobics classes which integrate a lot of similar stretches, but must say that I was not able to figure out so far what I'm supposed to do on the sun salutations. Why would Cappy do a DVD that is extremely basic for some segments, and then high-speed-you- better-know-what-you're-doing for one segment?

1846865,5,B00008G91Q,"Yoga for the Rest of Us by Peggy Cappy is a DVD that can help beginners of all ages and fitness levels discover the benefits of yoga. If you think you are too old, too out of shape, or not flexible enough to try yoga, the students in this DVD demonstrate otherwise.

Cappy, a New Hampshire based yoga teacher with over 20 years experience offers gentle senior yoga classes where many of the participants are 70+. You may have seen her on PBS.

In Yoga for the Rest of Us, she leads 4 of her students of varying ages and abilities through a one hour session that can done all at once or divided into three 20-minute segments, that include Warm-Ups, Standing Poses, and a Flowing Series of modified sun salutations that concludes with a nice long relaxation.

The DVD begins with Cappy's introduction, where she discusses the many benefits of yoga, her purpose for producing the DVD, as well as a review of what to expect and how to proceed. Her delivery in the introduction and throughout Yoga for the Rest of Us is warm, sincere, and engaging. The pacing slow and deliberate.

Part I, the warm-up stretches, are all done seated in a chair and begins with an exercise in learning to tune into your breathing and noticing the sensations you are feeling in your body. It provides a good transition out of the busyness of your day, and into your yoga practice. She then leads you through a series of gentle stretches beginning with your neck, and then moving down your body to your shoulders, torso, wrists, hands, feet, and legs.

Part 2, is dedicated to standing poses that are designed to build leg strength and improve balance. The poses are all demonstrated with several modifications and variations to accommodate different levels of ability. Those who are less steady use a chair for support.

Basic yoga poses such as mountain pose, tree pose, warrior pose, triangle, and downward facing dog are performed slowly and methodically with detailed alignment instructions. Cappy, encourages you to make the adjustments necessary to accommodate your specific needs, something that I think is extremely important for staying safe as you begin to practice yoga.

Part 3 of Yoga for the Rest of Us begins with modified sun salutations, a flowing series of poses that are demonstrated both with a chair for support and without. She encourages you to only do as much as feels right as you begin.

The DVD concludes with a few gentle compensation poses for your back and a nice long guided relaxation - the restorative reward for your earlier yoga practice.

If you are looking for a gentle yoga DVD that can help you increase your flexibility, strength and balance, Yoga for the Rest of Us is worth a closer look.

I did not follow my own (belated)advice for ""Buyer Beware"" and did not READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING!  So - DVDLegacy gets a very bad review and very bad ""Seller Feedback"", but Amazon gets an A+ for customer service.
Another point - when one has tried all options to no avail, Amazon has a wonderful feature for resolving issues: Click the ""Call Me"" button! They really did call!  I was having trouble with ""Submit Claim"" button, and the person on the phone filed my claim for me. Money was back in my account the next business day.
Very pleased with Amazon, but I will always read the ""Seller Reviews"" before buying, from now on.

I've become older and overweight, and I wanted to find some way to get in better shape, but had difficulty finding an exercise program that didn't intimidate me. How delighted I was to find ""Yoga For The Rest Of Us"" - I can actually DO IT without falling on my face or limping to the chiropractor. And I feel the benefits. I feel that my strength, stamina and sense of balance are improving. And as a bonus, it's a great stress-buster.

I reviewed every yoga tape in our public library, looking for one that gave us the benefits of a yoga workout without leaving us in knots.  A great entry into yoga for almost any age group!  My only suggestion, as these poses are very well demonstrated, is that someone totally new to yoga would find a visit to a yoga workshop helpful to get going.  I give this an A for being a really great beginning for anyone needing to stretch and strengthen his body and balance.  An A for being super for seniors, as well.",1227398400,,791,4.19205298013245

1846924,4,B00008G91Q,"I have done several yoga tapes over the years and this is definitely the most basic, but that's not all bad.  Peggy Cappy is not coming from a ""new-agey"" perspective of ""mind-body-spirit"" [That in itself will cause many to dismiss her].  There's not even music as background.  However, if what you are looking for is a way to increase flexibility, balance, and general well-being, this will help.

The DVD features ordinary people - not models or people who can tie themselves in knots.  Quite the opposite, the ""Meet Peggy Cappy"" section interviews older individuals with all the problems of aging.  And, if you are younger - don't let this be a turn off.  These people are an inspiration.  {Most yoga, pilates, or aerobic videos feature perky, healthy, good-looking bodies which can just plain be disgusting when you know those days have passed and you're just attempting to stay in the same jeans size.)

This isn't going to make you sweat and if you are into a real fitness program, you will definitely need more than this.  Yet, there are some real beneficial aspects to this as well.  The focus on breathing is very good as are the foot and wrist exercises, things that are often missed in other fitness videos.  I'm not disappointed that I purchased this; I will not use it on a daily basis, but when I am overtired or just want to take a break, this will be good.

If you are brand new to yoga, out of shape, or dealing with an injury, this video would be a great introduction. It is encouraging, safe, and motivating.  It's certainly better than doing nothing.",1146096000,129,1569,4.63768115942029
1846925,5,B00008G91Q,"Having never tried yoga, and being neither overly flexible nor a ""New Age"" person, I was a little skeptical about it.  But stretching and balance are an important part of any fitness regimen, and yoga is the best way to do both as well as to relax, so when I saw this DVD, aimed at people who are not already proficient at yoga or physically fit, I thought I would give it a try.  I have really enjoyed it, and it has been a very pleasant surprise.  The 15-20 minutes of stretching at the beginning are simple but consistently effective.  The standing poses offer a lot of variations depending on your individual strengths and abilities, and all of the poses and variations are presented in an encouraging, egalitarian, non-judgmental manner.  The sun salutations, while accessible even for inflexible me, are surprisingly demanding in terms of endurance.  The last surprise for me was how effective the relaxation section is, coming right after the sun salutations.  I do this DVD at the end of the day and find it really helps me sleep well at night and face the stresses of the morning in a calm and comfortable way.  I miss these exercises if I don't get to do them for a few days, and I don't get bored hearing the DVD repeatedly (as I had feared I might - although I am getting the second DVD in the series, just in case!).  While this DVD isn't ""high-tech"" yoga with background music, lithe performers, gorgeous scenery, or all the technically correct yoga terms, it does meet people where they are - in their own homes, with something less than a perfect body or complete grasp of all that is yoga - and invite them to try more.  It makes yoga more inclusive than it might otherwise seem, and if it inspires people who otherwise would shy away from any form of exercise, then I'm all for it.",1144195200,52,1799,4.507692307692308

1846931,5,B00008G91Q,"I have tried several yoga DVD's and classes.  This DVD strikes a good balance between too basic (there was a Morning and Evening Yoga for Senior Citizens DVD I watched where you did Sun Salutations in a chair--puleeze!) and a true beginner (Yoga for Dummies-Basic, for example, which I am working up to) Like the For Dummies one, it is a little talky, something that is irratating when you do it every day, but the chair as extra large block is a brilliant idea that really makes it possible for me to do yoga. (As Ms Cappy puts it, it makes the floor 18 inches higher.)

I am doing this DVD almost every day, and after working with it for 2 months (along with a few private lessions with a friend to spot alignment problems) I am able to join and keep up with a beginner class at my Health Club.

As with all yoga, you can do as much or as little as you want, she gives examples without the chair, but it is still very simple, so you can still use this workout as you grow stronger.

For ABSOLUTE beginners at Yoga, I highly recommend this DVD. It isn't just for Senior Citizens (and I am neither that old nor that inflexible) It is for any age that finds a beginner class too much at first.",1140825600,9,1192,4.214912280701754
1846932,4,B00008G91Q,"I purchased this DVD and another Yoga video by Allen Finger.  Peggy Cappy's version is definitely inspiring.  Ms. Cappy demonstrates the poses along with 4 other real people ranging in age from 40-something to 70-something.

The idea that she encourages the use of a chair for the poses is wonderful and made me feel like this was something I could do.  I felt really great about myself as she moved slowly through the breathing, stretching and beginning poses.

However, it seemed that 15 minutes into the second 20-minute session that I had jumped into an intermediate class.  She moved very quickly into combining moves without demonstrating each.  I know I will get the hang of it, but it's going to take a while---like putting individual dance steps into a complete routine.

I recommend the video for people who might be afraid of failing at Yoga --- as I was.",1137369600,22,866,4.76510067114094

The poses that Peggy Cappy describes and demonstrates are not only beautiful and therapeutic on all levels of our being (body, mind, and spirit), they are also DO-able!  Thanks, Peggy Cappy, for bringing your gifts to those of us who need them so!",1126742400,21,416,4.763888888888889

In just a few sessions, I was surprised at how quickly my strength returned.  A great start for an older beginner or a returning student.  The session has something for everyone.  There are 4 students with Cappy and she shows different ways to modify the poses.",1124323200,21,372,4.661538461538462

I've been doing the full dvd for just 2 weeks now, every day minus one day a week. Though I'm a very young looking 55, I am super out of shape, overweight and body hurts always. I'm a clean eater but have hypothyroidism, so my weight is crazy out of control when meds aren't working (I went years undiagnosed). At only 5'3"", that ain't good. I share this to say that the simple moves on this dvd done consistently REALLY have helped me thus far. Literally just standing in mountain pose hurts my body... I cannot wait until I can stand there pain-free. I feel like it will happen with this! After the first time going through it, I ordered one for my sister, who is similar age and in similar poor physical condition.",1515369600,,815,4.368421052631579

7983956,5,B00008G91Q,"Peggy Cappy has developed a wonderful program for that group of us who are not as flexible due to arthritis. With the use of a chair, I still feel I am getting a great workout, and if I want I can challenge myself without the chair. The first part is stretching , and I have even recruited my 90 year old Mum to join in! Peggy is so calm, and her soothing voice puts me right to sleep in the cool down! I have had so many yoga dvds that just didn't work for me. This one is awesome! Thanks Peggy! There is a mini documentary at the end where Peggy talks about the program, and there are people of all ages in her class. I can't believe the flexibility they have! I can see myself doing this workout for a long time!",1506988800,2,715,4.006993006993007
