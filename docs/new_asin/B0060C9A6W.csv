4912635,5,B0060C9A6W,"Becoming Santa is a truly wonderful film, full of magic and fun. The star, Jack Sanderson, is one-of-a-kind . . . sweet, nostalgic, witty, and smart as a whip.  His journey to rekindle a sense of the Christmas spirit is nothing short of  delightful.  He explores the history of Santa Claus (sounds boring, but it's not), attends ""Santa school (who knew there were Santa schools?),"" rides the Polar Express (great moments here), and practices his quick comebacks with young children around the United States.  This is a Christmas classic.",1321488000,10,537,5.0

However, it was quite interesting and my five year old grandson now knows there are real Santas and how he can actually become one himself. I found the documentary very interesting and after watching this I was not disappointed in the purchase at all. I would recommend this video to anyone who loves Christmas.",1469232000,,485,4.46067415730337
4912648,5,B0060C9A6W,I always wanted to know what it takes to be a real good Santa. This book really goes into a personal endeavor being Santa. Some segments just moved me. Really Great.,1469145600,,165,4.354838709677419

4912650,5,B0060C9A6W,"I just saw this last night. It was a wonderful documentary. (Not for kids however if you know what I mean). This documentary is about how one man becomes Santa Claus. Buy it on Amazon and it will be money well spent.
What I enjoyed about this was it truly does show the good side of humanity. A huge shock was that the film is not snarky. Today many film makers would have made this sarcastic. The Christmas Spirit shines through on almost every frame. In this film we see man deciding to become a Santa for the upcoming holiday season.  He goes through training at a ""Santa College"" and along the way he sees how much ""Santa"" means to not just children  but children of all ages.  Buy this movie.  Share it with friends.  Everybody adult that enjoys Christmas will love this",1467072000,,775,4.391608391608392

4912655,4,B0060C9A6W,While I think a lot of what is indicated in video is true I am not sure becoming Santa is quite this easy or do you get the gigs this guy got.  I think this was a bit stages.  Still fun to watch though.,1433808000,,202,3.5681818181818183
4912656,4,B0060C9A6W,interesting and sad,1428883200,,19,5.666666666666667
4912657,5,B0060C9A6W,Nice to see a guy who has all the right Santa attributes trying out the job to see how it feels. Most Santas you see are too old to bring the myth to life. Without an immediate family to worry about this guy is a joy at the job and shares the joy with the kids. And he has a childlike quality himself so most kids can relate to him. It's good to see that he isn't bound by any inertia to keep playing the role even though he obviously has acting experience. With the exposure from this film he should be able to play the part wherever and whenever.,1427068800,,548,3.9909090909090907
4912658,5,B0060C9A6W,For anyone that loves the christmas season and the santa concept a great movie.  Hollywood actor becomes santa and learns and shows us what it means to be a living breathing santa.. how it changes those that play the role and effects the kids and adults they come in contact... must viewing.,1424390400,,291,4.596153846153846

4912660,4,B0060C9A6W,"A cute documentary about a man's journey to become Santa Claus for one Christmas season.  The man, Jack, starts out with less than jolly feelings about Christmas following the death of his mother and is determined to find his Christmas spirit.  It is fun to follow his journey and see the behind the scenes of what it takes to be a convincing Santa.  Bits of history about the legend of St. Nick/Santa are thrown in for good measure.  It would have been interesting to see more of the ""business side"" of being Santa included though.",1419465600,,532,4.568421052631579

4912666,5,B0060C9A6W,"If you are thinking about ""Becoming Santa"" this is a very good video. After being a Santa for over 25 years, this DVD points out the good and not so good things about assuming the role. If you are just looking for entertainment this may not be right for you.",1388620800,,258,4.18
4912667,4,B0060C9A6W,"This documentary is very interesting and touching. I had no idea there were ""Santa Schools"" but it now makes me wonder if some of the people I have deemed ""good Santa's"" went to a formal training. I like how they incorporated and highlighted various charitable programs and interviewed a diverse group of Santa's. Very informative and entertaining.",1385683200,,348,5.12280701754386
4912668,5,B0060C9A6W,"I'm not sure if ""sweet"" is the right term to use for this film, it is funny, insightful respectful and kind-hearted... but ""sweet"" still lingers in my mind.

As a disclaimer, I am also a ""Santa"" so I can empathize with many of the things that are discussed in this documentary...

But... beyond that... not only does it show the depth of commitment that many ""Santas"" have for their chosen profession, it shows the kindness that can be brought out in all of us through these mens (and womens) attempts to keep wonder and imagination alive in the world.

Make no mistake, this isn't simply a documentary about a guy trying to become a Santa Claus... Jack Sanderson takes us along on his personal and professional journey with humor and warmth in a way that leaves you laughing and then dabbing your eyes at the sheer joy that you see expressed by both the children and the Santas themselves.

I HIGHLY recommend it... it might become your favorite ""get into the spirit"" Christmas movie!  It sure did it for everyone in my house!

(Warning: Although there is nothing innapropriate, you might want to watch it with adults... little ones (and even not-so-little ones) could be confused by it.)

Stay Jolly!

4912670,4,B0060C9A6W,"The daily life of a store Santa looks so simple: little kids sit on Santa's lap and tell him what they want for Christmas.  What could be easier?  But how does one go about handling the little ones who are terrified of Santa?  And what about the boys who want toy guns for Christmas when their parents do not approve of such gifts?  Or the children who want expensive gifts?  How about the children who ask, ""Can you bring my Daddy back?""  Does Santa need training, and if so, who does it?

Watch Jack Sanderson as he morphs into Santa Claus, buys a personalized Santa suit, and interacts with both adults and children.  A fascinating look into the internal preparations of ""Becoming Santa.""",1371859200,,691,4.560975609756097

4912672,4,B0060C9A6W,"This is a great documentary, especially for those of us who have shared the persona of Santa Claus.
I have be Clausin' for 20 years and it was enjoyable to relate to a lot of what took place as he went through the transition.
NOT for the kiddos!
I found myself wanting to say more than they did about certain aspects of being Santa - but I just had to remind myself that this wasn't an instructional video LOL.
Merry Christmas!",1355961600,3,427,4.283950617283951
4912673,5,B0060C9A6W,Terrific documentary and it didn't hurt that Jack makes such a wonderful Santa. Very informative and entertaining. A great documentary to get into the Christmas spirit!,1355875200,,168,5.5
4912674,5,B0060C9A6W,"I'm a professional Santa here in Australia so it was really great to see how the other Santas do their thing. I enjoyed seeing his transformation both in physical looks and in his approach to the role. He gradually began to look more like Santa and also began to believe in the role of Santa.

I enjoyed seeing the Santa School  sessions, something we don't have down this way yet so it was instructive to see how they handle the hard topics as well as the fun stuff.

To get to see him perform in the parades and special events, even to do a volunteer stint standing on the street ringing a bell, great stuff.

Did I get anything out of this? Sure, as a Santa I got to see many faces of people that up until now have just been a name on an email. It was especially cool for me to see Adele and her workshop. Her name has high respect for quality suits in the Santa community so to see her at work was a treat for me.

Away from my own role I also enjoyed seeing somebody ""get it"" about Christmas and just what it is to really become part of the fun and the joy of the Season.

I think families will enjoy this tale so long as their children are of an age where they can understand that there is a real Santa and there are also lots of helpers.

Quality of the movie and editing was good and I was impressed that this movie came out of an independent movie house.

One negative was the many (4?) trailers I had to sit through before I got to see the menu. Maybe it was something I was doing wrong but this seemed to be forcing me to watch stuff that I had no interest in just so that I could get to the good bits.",1329436800,13,1613,4.003115264797508
4912675,5,B0060C9A6W,"I had the pleasure of catching Becoming Santa this year on OWN.  I loved the film and would recommend it to anyone and everyone.

4912676,4,B0060C9A6W,"Loved it!

Jack Sanderson is a funny man and watching him take this journey is fantastic.

The end will have your eyes leaking, your heart soaring, your smile as big as Texas and your belief renewed.

p.s. - this is NOT a movie for children as it shows the behind the scenes of becoming Santa; the title should infer that but you never know!!",1324857600,2,342,4.3125
4912677,5,B0060C9A6W,"After losing both of his parents, Jack tries to rediscover the spirit of Christmas by becoming a Santa Claus. Middle-aged and having no family of his own, Jack's journey to become one of the most identifiable and loved icons in the world leads him beyond the ""ho, ho, ho"" to the hope that Christmas offers.

As well as following Jack as he becomes Santa, this film also spends some time show us the history of Santa Claus.

A delightful and touching film. Goes great with cookies and a glass of milk.",1324598400,4,500,4.483516483516484

4912679,5,B0060C9A6W,"Great movie!  Delightful, funny and touching.  I have seen the movie three times already this December, and bought two copies of it to give away as Christmas presents.

Sanderson is compassionate, human, and hilarious.  You will love this movie!

One caveat:  If you get the physical disc, there are a lot of previews for other documentaries which are not appropriate for watching right before a Santa movie.  These automatically play when you start the disk, but you can easily skip them by pressing the ""Menu"" button on your DVD player's remote control.  Trust me, you really want to skip them - you can always go back and watch them later if you're really curious.  When we rented the movie online, there were no previews, so this wasn't an issue.",1324339200,4,750,4.751937984496124
4912680,5,B0060C9A6W,"What a warm, wonderful experience to see ""Becoming Santa"".  Jack Sanderson is an authentic character--one who is compassionate enough to make you feel warm and fuzzy about his journey, and edgy enough not to cross the line into sappy sentimentalism.  I learned so much about the history of Santa Claus (yes, it's really interesting!) and I never found myself bored with the topic.  It's the type of film I plan to watch every holiday season now.

4912683,5,B0060C9A6W,"How many documentaries can truly ""touch"" a person in a heartfelt way?  A movie that makes the little ""Scrooge"" in all of us melt away and put a giant smile on your face with a warm feeling in your heart?  This movie delivers all that and more!  Jack is a wonderful person and makes a great Santa (the kind of Santa I would have loved to see as a child).  Watching his journey makes you feel like you're with him at every step.  It's engaging, fun, and I didn't find one minute of the film boring.  If you love Christmas, this movie is for you.  Of course, you may not want to show this to your child unless they know that there are many Santas out there that are his ""helpers,"" but they still report to the Big Guy (wink).  This movie is for the child in all of us.  Highly, HIGHLY recommended!  And Merry Christmas!",1322697600,5,816,4.173076923076923

I have decided that in addition to ""Its a Wonderful Life"" claymation ""Rudolph"" and ""The year without a Santa Clause"". I would not necessarily let younger children watch the movie, only because they may become confused about Santa, but our 6th grader and 8th graders watched it and enjoyed the movie (maybe not as much as us).  We were able to share the move with family as that is what we do over the Thanksgiving weekend. EVERONE LOVED THE MOVIE, even a few that really don't usually don't like anything.
