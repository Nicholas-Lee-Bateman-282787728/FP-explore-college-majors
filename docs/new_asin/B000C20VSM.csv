2452471,2,B000C20VSM,"Very cool document of Los Angeles in the early 1970s. Lots of cool actors, ranging from Gene Hackman to Karen Black and Harry Dean Stanton, but the pace and pursuit are sorta' lackluster in this flick.",1361404800,,201,4.611111111111111
2452472,5,B000C20VSM,"As a Kris Kristofferson fan, I had long wanted to see Cisco Pike. Critics (including Pauline Kael) gave Kristofferson good reviews for his performance as the title character. When I finally tracked down a copy, the film lived up to my high expectations.

Cisco Pike concerns a singer-songwriter who became a drug dealer and spent time in prison after his music career hit the skids. Much to the approval of his girlfriend (Karen Black), Cisco tries to get out of dealing and back into the music business. However, a crooked narc (Gene Hackman) makes Cisco an offer he can't refuse - go back to dealing or head back to prison. Cisco Pike is short (94 minutes) and the plot is fairly straightforward; the film, however, easily holds the viewer's interest.

Other than Kristofferson, the best thing about Cisco Pike is that it does such a good job of evoking early-1970s Los Angeles. The visuals alone - the cars, the clothes, the hair - make the film worth watching.  Kristofferson also contributed a great soundtrack that includes many of his best-known songs (""Sunday Morning Coming Down"" and ""The Pilgrim,"" among others). Finally, the cast is excellent; it includes Warhol superstar Viva and the always-seedy Harry Dean Stanton as Kristofferson's former bandmate. Look for Antonio Fargas (Starsky and Hutch's ""Huggy Bear"") as the drug dealer Buffalo.

It might take some searching to find a copy of Cisco Pike. For those with an interest in the 1970s, Kris Kristofferson, or offbeat cinema, it will be worth the effort.",1261267200,11,1520,4.949019607843137
2452473,3,B000C20VSM,"I am a Kris Kristofferson fan and have loved his music for many years. He has lyrics that are in my estimation are extremely philosophic and poetic, plus many quotable phrases.  This movie had several of his songs from his alblum ""The Silver Tongued Devil and I"" and was the reason I purchased the DVD. His ability as an actor are definitely limited. Gene Hackman as tough guy with problems is old hat.  Karen Black has always been sexy, and has many better roles. The movie is dated and has an unbelievable plot, that in reality makes it ""corny"". Really a stretch to have to sit through just to hear a couple of songs that can be hear under less boring circumstances.",1260316800,2,668,4.467213114754099
2452474,5,B000C20VSM,"Great to watch this movie again, and happy it is at last available.
Brought back a heap of memories. First time I saw it was on a Halliburton oil drilling ship out at sea off the Tasmanian coast, in 1972.
A completely straight crew of oilmen.
I couldn't believe that such a film was flown out to us.
Very basic acting etc, clunky plot etc, but I love it. Bought the vinyl of the music about the same time.",1188950400,3,405,4.139240506329114
2452475,4,B000C20VSM,"When it comes to playing Cisco Pike, there is virtually no acting required for Kris Kristofferson.  Pike is a down on his luck musician who is coming off of a pot bust and is looking for a way back into the music business.  Gene Hackman is Holland, a seemingly straight laced LAPD cop who blackmails Pike into getting back into the pot dealing business.  The film focuses on Pike working his old contacts to try to move 100 kilos of pot within 59 hours (kind of a take on ""Gone in 60 Seconds"").  During this weekend Pike is forced to lie to his live in girlfriend (Karen Black) about his reasons for getting back into dealing and he is reunited with his old singing partner Jesse (Harry Dean Stanton), who is by now a hopeless heroin addict.

""Cisco Pike"" is a good movie with a solid cast.  Kristofferson is highly believable playing a variation of himself, even singing some of his own songs in the movie.  (For those interested in the music, check out ""The Silver Tongued Devil and I by Kristofferson, as close to a soundtrack to this movie as you will find and a very good album on it's own merits).  Gene Hackman plays a quirky role in the middle of his most successful period as an actor (Bonnie and Clyde, French Connection, The Conversation and the Poseidon Adventure).  Karen Black is Kristofferson's beautiful, earthy girlfriend and Viva appears as a variation on the part she played in almost every movie, an offbeat woman seemingly in a world of her own.  Viva always had the ability to make her dialogue seem ad-libbed, whether it was or not.  Finally, Harry Dean Stanton puts in another great character performance and would soon appear with Kristofferson in another role seemingly modeled after Kris' own career and persona, ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"".  Also look for Alan Arbus playing an unsympathetic character (the manager) before his very sympathetic turn as Dr. Sydney Friedman on ""MASH"".

""Cisco Pike"" is dark and downbeat, but enjoyable as an honest portrayal of a man, trying to straighten out his life, who is forced into a bad situation and finally loses all that he cares for.  I highly recommend this to Kris Kristofferson fans and those who enjoy the look and feel of early 70's cinema.",1173744000,10,2220,4.658974358974359
2452476,5,B000C20VSM,"I first discovered this film through an interview with Robert Towne at the Los Angeles Film Festival several years ago.  I decided to give it a watch and afterwards wondered why this film has been overlooked throughout the years.  It is classic 1970s cinema.  With a cast that includes Gene Hackman, Harry Dean Stanton, Karen Black, Kris Kristofferson it really should have been more popular.  Shows how important the distribution process can be in affecting a film's place in history.

All this to say that this film should be more recognized than it is and is worth owning on DVD next to all the other classic 1970s films.",1168819200,3,624,4.7407407407407405
2452477,5,B000C20VSM,"Finally, it is out on dvd! It was quite hard to find on VHS and I've been waiting for the dvd for some time. Funny how it sometimes takes so long for a good film to get to dvd. Kristofferson it seems has always been somewhat underrated (check out his fine performances in The Tracker, Flashpoint and playing a small role as a very lowlife biker in Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia for some oft overlooked examples). Outstanding performances by Kristofferson and Hackman. Look for Harry Dean Stanton in an as usual fine performance as Kristofferson's former partner...and Karen Black plays his girlfriend. Other synopsises here give a good description of the plot; Hackman plays a semi-psycho dirty cop who is being forced into retirement and is making Kristofferson use his drug connections to sell some weed for him. Great soundtrack featuring Kristofferson's Pilgrim: Chapter 33. Just a great ole' film like they don't make anymore!",1162425600,3,937,4.936708860759493
2452478,5,B000C20VSM,"Nothin' in the world better than an old hippie movie, and I just got finished watching one: Cisco Pike.

Faded rock star Cisco (Kris Kristofferson) promised his girlfriend (Karen Black) that he's all done dealing pot.  If he gets convicted a third time he'll get five years.  Enter the crooked narc, Sergeant Leo Holland, played by that loveable bastard Gene Hackman.  He's got a truckload of high quality weed that he's forcing Cisco to sell in 48 hours or he's gonna bust him again.

Then the fun begins.  Along the way we meet Doug Sahm who plays an extremely wired Tex-Mex singer (what a stretch) and the perma-weird Harry Dean Stanton as Cisco's ex-bandmate, not to mention a couple of the flakiest hippie chicks you're likely to meet in Venice California, circa 1972.  I learned a few important facts from this film.  For example: You can tell an undercover narc by looking at his socks (they're always white).  Also, if you get pulled over by a cop, eat the pot!  If he asks you what you're chewing, say gum!

I enjoyed the heck out of this movie.  It was Kristofferson's first, and he displayed an effortless manner of acting, sort of the way his whole life has been: effortless.  And I gotta tell ya, ol' Kris was one sexy dude back then, wasn't he girls?  I wish I had that squint, that swagger, that rail-thin frame, that tousled hair, that growl of a voice, those cowboy boots...Damn, I just wish I wrote some of those songs!

After listening to some of his early music and seeing this movie I've come to the conclusion that Kris Kristofferson is a national treasure.  Let's ring him up and tell him before it's too late.",1140048000,37,1633,4.560137457044673

8095349,5,B000C20VSM,"This is a forgotten movie with Kristofferson's film debut and at the time I first saw the movie, I didn't know who he was but I knew he was a terrific actor. With a top-rated star like Gene Hackman along with Karen Black, it was a powerful story with a punching finish line near the end of the movie when Cisco assures his long forgotten stage buddy that ""the people don't want  your looks, they want your soul.""  This movie should be played on the Networks at least 3 or 4 times a year just  so people can see this forgotten masterpiece.",1383177600,,538,4.254901960784314
8095350,3,B000C20VSM,"I'm not sure if this was an accurate representation of Venice Beach in 1972 or if Hollywood was just trying to satisfy the public appetite for more edgy subjects.  Perhaps it was a little of both.  I'm sure people this morally bankrupt have always existed, but it all feels a little too casual and reckless.  I would guess drug dealers try harder to minimize their chances of being caught, exposed, or ripped off.  Gene Hackman was never allowed to get beyond every cliche of a dirty cop and Kris Kristofferson just seemed bored and apathetic no matter how strange things got.",1382486400,,576,4.673267326732673
