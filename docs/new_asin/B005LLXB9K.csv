4829234,5,B005LLXB9K,"Pearl Jam was a focal point of my life in high school.  I feel fortunate to have witnessed their evolution and to understand the appreciation they receive (and deserve).  It was amazing to reflect on my own life as I watched the DVD and the footage collected from over the years.  Back in high school, I was a diehard Pearl Jam historian, but this DVD revealed more interesting facts about their experiences and emotions.  I highly suggest this documentary.  The two hours go by too quickly!",1319846400,4,491,4.662790697674419
4829235,5,B005LLXB9K,"I saw this a few weeks ago in a theater and was amazing.  At first, I wasn't sure where it was going.  But it quickly picked up and loved the fact that there was extensive footage of Andrew Wood; having never actually heard him speak, made it alone worth the look.  It's wall to wall great music and in depth current interviews with everyone surrounding the band.  I'm a Pearl Jam junkie; saw them at MTV Unplugged and followed them around in the early years.  I can't believe it's been 20 years; the material made me reflect on life moments as I followed the band.  Awesome job by Cameron Crow in direction and interviewing.",1319760000,3,625,4.43859649122807
4829236,4,B005LLXB9K,"A couple of days ago i watched the PJ20 Film
on PBS, granted it was edited for Language but i am imagining minus the bonus footage it was the same film and i will be getting the dvd for my collection

As i sit here and listen to the PJ20 soundtrack there is a couple of gripes with the film. Now coming from a die hard PJ Fan its not hard to be objective of the greatest band on earth but i think the gripe is more with Cameron Crowe, but PJ had alot to do with this film. The film is great don't get me wrong, but i think for the average fan not so much for the die hards. I know i am going to get pounded for this review but here it goes

Throughout the film great never before seen footage, interviews and snippets of live performances. 2 clips they played from Nassau and Philly i was there so that was great. The Film had me teary and had the chills throughout but its lacking in some areas. 1) Crowe and PJ go thru the whole history of the band, each member how they got there etc but they some how skip over very quickly the revolving drummers they have had over the years it is played off like a joke and very quickly, as much as Matt Cameron is great he is only a small piece of the bands history. 2) I was shocked to see more dedicated film time to Nirvana and Kurt Cobain then i was to see Alice in chains and Layne Staley ??? according to what has been written and said Eddie and PJ were very close to Layne (ala Mad season etc) 3) The film mentions every band known to man like Mookie blaylock, Green River and Mount Tre etc but no mention of Bad Radio? and other Eddie Vedder early bands. 4) Very brief in the bands influences and what bands they appreicate it. Yes Neil Young and the Who and Hendrix are mentioned but not so much updated artists 5) The film could have been longer, it feel a little rushed and feels a little skippy, jumping from piece to piece. 6) The movie is written and directed in i would say a ""Fans Perspective"" not many hard questions asked.
I was super excited for this Film and did my own campaining getting everyone i know to go see it
By no means am i a critic but i am a fan and have watched enough Documentaries to see what i think was missing",1319760000,7,2188,4.027586206896552
4829237,1,B005LLXB9K,"The deluxe edition is out of print and won't be reprinted, so if you're a fan and couldn't make it to the ten club in time, Pearl Jam wants you to know that YOU DON'T MATTER ANYMORE.

Also, this Blu-ray doesn't come out until after Xmas because it's a best buy exclusive. It's sickening to see a band like Pearl Jam stoop so damn low.",1318982400,7,334,4.138461538461539
4829238,1,B005LLXB9K,"Wow, so this is just the movie itself and NO extras at all??? There is no point in buying the single disc, no-extra version, and now they are sold out of the deluxe sets. The deluxe sets will probably run $1000 on E-Bay...",1318636800,6,222,4.186046511627907
4829239,5,B005LLXB9K,"I saw this doc at the movie theatre in a 1 night only showing. There wasn't 1 empty seat. Judging by the audiences reactions, everybody thoroughly loved this film. I have always liked the band, although not a die hard fan. This documentary is extremely well done , no surprise given the fact that Cameron Crowe is behind it. Nice mix of interesting dialoge and live footage. Also , quite a bit of humour. A fitting tribute in the 15-20 mins spent on Mother Love Bone and Andrew Wood . As well as Temple of the dog and comments from Chris Cornell. Just an excellent 2 hrs spent. Any moderate fan will really love this doc. I am looking forward to watching on dvd and hopefully seeing some extras too.",1318377600,25,699,4.384615384615385
4829240,5,B005LLXB9K,Cameron Crowe has made a superb film documentary of Pearl Jam's history including lots of excellent interviews from people who were there and showing some amazing live performances from around the world. The film begins with the story of Mother Love Bone and the death of Andy Wood which then leads to the beginnings of Mookie Blaylock and their search for a voice that would transform them into Pearl Jam. The interviews include great stories from Chris Cornell and each of the members of Pearl Jam who give honest and detailed information about the whole grunge scene and the meteoric rise to fame that threatened to end the band. The reasons behind Pearl Jam's longevity are explained and even the down times in their career are looked upon as blessings for the band. The soundtrack is full of rare demos and amazing live performances that show what a great live band Pearl Jam have always been. Pearl Jam Twenty is both informative and entertaining and represents one of the best music documentaries of all time.,1316908800,11,1016,4.811428571428571
4829241,5,B005LLXB9K,"This is one of the best (edit: THE best) rock documentary ever concieved. This is the raw, pure, untainted view of music and specially grunge in its earlier years. The Seattle sound and bands and the way they show the story starting from Andy Wood, just amazing. PJ has been the soundtrack of my life from an early age and seeing this movie unfold and tell the story of one of the most important bands of the 90's is breathtaking. The innocence in the presentation and the band itself is missing in todays music and bands. These are honest, true musicians that only made music because they wanted to express their thoughts and try to make a difference in the lives of their fans not their own wallets (read: every new band out now).

If you like any music from late 80's and early 90's, do yourself a favor and go watch this or buy it, it will have a lasting impression on your thought of music. I ordered this on my phone the moment I stepped out of the screening, even ordered the book for good measure.

If you are looking for another great rock documentary or mockumentary I should say, check out Spinal Tap. The band doesnt exist but its an amazing movie to watch.

Grunge forever!",1316649600,9,1186,4.406392694063927
4829242,3,B005LLXB9K,"Really enjoyed this movie, but since it's going to be on Public Television in HiDef for free 10/21/11, why should I buy the lower-quality DVD version...?  Because we were promised 4 hours of extra footage, good reason!  But this release description says only 29 minutes of extra footage.  Hopefully, the description is wrong.  Or, the 4-hour version is a different, higher-priced product (how could PJ do that to us haha?)

Also, would like to see the BluRay because the newly-shot footage is HD quality.... hate to see it printed-down!

4829243,5,B005LLXB9K,"The Cameron Crow documentary captures the intensity of Pearl Jam in the early years, along with the explosion of the Seattle scene.  Crows creation is fluid and the editing is creative and visually stunning.  The film clearly depicts Pearl Jam's relationship and contribution to other bands from the early '90s.  The viewer gets to know all of the original members of the band, their personalities and artistic contributions.  The film does an excellent job of explaining how and why Pearl Jam survived for 20 years.  As a life long Pearl Jam fan, I have to admit there were a few events in the film that I did not know about.  The film is full of different emotions and I laughed more then I thought I would.  Overall, a must see for anyone who grew up listening to Pearl Jam.",1316563200,45,777,4.546762589928058

Now, 20+ years in, they are still as powerful.  The film by Cameron Crowe is artfully put together with rare footage and one-on-one interviews, and of course artfully integrated with music.  Any loyal PJ fan has to have, and those interested will find inspiring.  Highly recommended.",1504396800,,586,4.888888888888889
4829252,5,B005LLXB9K,"Wow. This was such an amazing homage to what has made Pearl Jam, Pearl Jam. It not only displayed the hard work and dedication that this band has maintained with their music, but it paid respect to all of those artists in the past and along the way that inspired and enriched this band musically. I had a lot of emotions watching this documentary. Music literally gets me through life, and this band has been a huge contributor to that for me. Cameron Crowe did a wonderful job with this film. It's real, raw, and we get to experience a little intimacy with each band member - which I find to be very special. I definitely recommend this for EVERY music fan, no matter who/what inspires you.",1504396800,,691,4.448818897637795

So,  I'm purchasing it.  The stories brought me heartfelt tears and the  music made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I'm a bigger PJ fan now,  after watching this. It was often intimate and was clearly honest. After the death of Chris Cornell a month ago,  I have been revisiting my favorite bands. This documentary had a few touching moments that included Cornell. Would like to watch those moments over and over. And I especially loved the look into each PJ member's life. May Pearl Jam live forever!

To update my review,  I'm so happy that I ordered the deluxe CD set. For a few bucks more I got almost 6 hours of joy. A superb choice to add to my collection!",1498262400,4,831,4.316129032258065

Being a highschooler in the early 90s  I loved PJ and it really brought me back to a lot of fond memories.  I love that they are still together and still touring, such a beautiful family!  I had the awesome opportunity to see them live a few years ago and it was a wonderful experience.  I highly recommend this film, especially for all you 40 somethings out there who want to reminisce.",1483574400,3,466,4.25

They tend to go really fast through some stuff I wanted them to spend more time on, and they have some really interesting pictures but they show them for only a second! So I'm glad that I got the companion book to go with it. I recommend getting the book.

Pearl Jam is one of the best bands in rock and they are still, 25 years later, together and touring and making new music. They are all very talented guys and I love them.",1483056000,6,533,3.935185185185185

I picked it up from the library just for something to watch. I thought it might get me more interested in the band or it might be an interesting film but it was just OK. I'd only recommened this film if you are a Pearl Jam  fan. I first heard of this film from seeing a bit of it on PBS several years ago. The actual film is 2 hours long!!

4829407,3,B005LLXB9K,"Well, I am true Pearl Jam fan. But have to speak the truth here. With Cameron Crowe working on this and having it be an authorized project I expected a lot more.

I suspect a novice Pearl Jam fan may simply be confused by the editing on this film with quick cuts and short dialog. Basically a montage of videos and little context holding the documentary together. A lot of material is just short edits like an interviewer asking ""do you think grudge has disappeared"" and Eddie Vedder just wiping his teeth. Wikipedia would be a better place to go to get the facts and history of the band.

The beginning was fairly well done with the detail about Mother Love Bone and the death of Andrew Wood. This is more along the lines of the history of Grunge music or the roots of Pearl Jam. Only issue of this being the title of the documentary implies the last 20 years and MLB disbanded beforehand so maybe the coverage was just wanting to pay homage to the friend that didn't have to the success they had. Sounds mean but wished this was edited down a bit for other things.

Chris Cornell comments about Andrew Wood and Eddie Vedder was interesting. Wished they had more of that. Chris stuck out since he was one of the few non-Pearl Jam members interviewed. Comments by Stone Gossard were really interesting about control of the band and his actual house and music collection. Other people's comments were sort of reserved and predictable.

Something that I thought was noticeably missing is the Coachella music concert in 1993. Seems like more an oversight than something too controversial to talk about. But who knows. The ""Shoe the shoeless"" rant was priceless.

The drummer situation was glossed over in a way where it just was made to be funny. They took the route of not really explaining anything (and avoid being rude to the former members). A higher road would have been to see if any fences could be mended. Maybe interview Dave Abbruzzese and just talk about music and positive stuff. The Eagles were able to bring in former members for their documentary. But I didn't really expect that here. Sort of a missed chance to balance the story and add a feel good moment.

Pearl Jam's promotion of the Singles movie was stuff I have never heard about. The stage climbing of Eddie Vedder I did know about but the videos of it I never saw before. Pretty neat. There are nuggets to be found in this film.

The thing that really bugged me was the organization of the film. They should have had it more chronological. When talking about the band in the 90s you should not be listening to music created and sung 10 years later. When talking about the 2010 version of the band there shouldn't be videos of 90s version of band with long hair. And the interesting bits are so short and buried in the stream of short edits that it would be difficult to fast forward to find a funny bit to show someone. Basically not going to be reference material that you would ever reference.

This is, of course, Cameron Crowe and not just handing camcorders out to roadies. But I see replaying Touring Band 2000 more than this. even with the graining video. Since you can at least find the parts that are interesting.

Anyway if you're a true fan you'll watch it all the way through. But to be honest this is not 5 stars. A true fan maybe 3 stars. And if you never heard of Pearl Jam probably 1 or 2 stars.",1388102400,2,3384,4.471636952998379

4829411,4,B005LLXB9K,"I think it goes without saying that this is a must-have film for Pearl Jam fans, especially those who want to learn more about their history and get a more behind-the-scenes look at the interaction between them.  Cameron Crowe is a phenomenal filmmaker and obviously a huge fan of music, as his film ""Singles"" was heavily focused on the Seattle music scene that begain to dominate in the early 90's.

The early parts of the film are focused on the death of Mother Love Bone singer Andrew Wood, and how his death affected the community.  Cameron included a lot of very early footage from those days, mixed with new interview pieces to provide a thorough backstory to the origin of Pearl Jam.  From there, it shifts into telling how they acquired singer Eddie Vedder and his integration into the band and the Seattle community.  I see this film as more of a character study than a simple timeline-based story of the band from its creation to current state.  The Foo Fighters released a documentary called ""Back And Forth"" which was similar in regards to showing how the band was formed but then closely followed what was going on within the band as each album was released.  I would have liked to see more of that in Pearl Jam Twenty, but there were some poignant moments that I did appreciate, such as Cameron sharing the actual ""Momma-Son"" demo cassette that Eddie recorded his vocals on, and Stone visiting his old apartment where he and Jeff first listened to the demo.  For PJ ""nerds"" this kind of footage is like gold simply for its nostalgic value.

Even as closely as I've followed the band, I learned a lot about their early days from watching this, especially in regards to their relationship with Chris Cornell and how he was a bit of a mentor for Eddie when first arriving in Seattle.  It's a great film for PJ fans, probably not enough to turn non-fans but a great wealth of knowledge and footage for those interested enough to know more.",1385337600,,1949,4.606936416184971

I would imagine that it would be of great interest to the passive fan as well since it tells a great story of a band from this era (yes, already in the past), and how they reached stardom but yet tried in vain to keep it real. Great inputs from members of other bands of the time.",1360713600,,346,3.887323943661972

4829442,2,B005LLXB9K,"I must say that this film was an entertaining 2 hours that seemingly flew by. It as well made and interesting and a good watch. It didn't make me like or dislike the band anymore than before. There were 3 things that I remember clearly the next day..... 1) Jeff Ament swears an awful lot, almost every time he's on camera... 2) I almost wish the Mother Love Bone opening was even longer, but mad props to the band for so much Andy Wood love.... 3) I really really disliked how they glossed over the past drummers in an almost disrespectful matter of fact manner. It was done in such an obviously contrived way to make the band bigger and more important that any particular drummer aside from Cameron. All of those guys really helped shape those 90's records in a profound and important way and to almost completely ignore each of them by name just left a bad taste in my mouth. It's not a true documentary by any means and it's clear the band has a lot of control over what made it into the film. Aside from that it was entertaining and something to do for a few hours on a Sunday evening.",1353888000,4,1089,4.29126213592233
4829443,5,B005LLXB9K,"The Cameron Crow documentary captures the intensity of Pearl Jam in the early years, along with the explosion of the Seattle scene. Crows creation is fluid and the editing is creative and visually stunning.
  The film clearly depicts Pearl Jam's relationship and contribution to other bands from the early '90s. The viewer gets to know all of the original members of the band, their personalities and artistic contributions. The film does an excellent job of explaining how and why Pearl Jam survived for 20 years.
  As a life long Pearl Jam fan, I have to admit there were a few events in the film that I did not know about. The film is full of different emotions and I laughed more then I thought I would. Overall, a must see for anyone who grew up listening to Pearl Jam.
  The extra footage in the delux edition is well worth the buy.  There are clips of members of the band creating songs as well as live footage and in depth interviews with all members of the band.",1353542400,5,971,4.482954545454546
4829444,5,B005LLXB9K,"I will begin by saying I am a devoted PJ fan, following them almost since the beginning. The Nw music scene has always been highly charged and eclectic, with a variety of sounds that run the gamut. Raining 9 months out of the year leaves folks up here with a gloomy kind of feeling. But bands like Mudhoney,Soundgarden,The Melvin's,Pearl Jam, AIC & Nirvana,as well as Mother Love Bone paved the way for countless bands to follow. They were neither Emo,nor pop or ""conventional"" bands...They played loud, fast,and with such incredible feeling that they were really hard to define. They were confessionals,love songs, songs filled with angst, rage,social awkwardness and alienation. And their history is deeply inter-twined with Pearl Jam's. So-and-so was in a band with so-and-so, who knew so-and-so, who was flat-mates with so-and-so. We are treated to an evolutionary tale~ this epic documentary chronicles the scene culminating with the formation of the Band, the evolution of the band and it's members(especially Ed), their rise to stardom (and the interim),and how they have went on to become one of the greatest bands the world has ever known,giving the viewer insight as to why they have a core of devoted fans that follow them with almost Deadhead-like religious fanaticism. Cameron Crowe has a lengthy history with the band, having directed them in ""Singles"", also being close friends with them. This Documentary is a must-have for fans, music buffs and historians, who will appreciate a behind-the-scenes look into a complex, yet down-to-Earth bunch of guys whose love of music and their fans has transcended time, and who are passionate about not only these things, but social and environmental causes as well. 2 decades is a long time in the music industry, but they have found their niche, and continue to wow and amaze, while seemingly to never miss a beat. Highly recommended,highly informative,and highly appreciated.",1351900800,16,1932,5.175718849840256
4829445,5,B005LLXB9K,Pearl Jam never disappoints! A superb DVD on the early years and origin of the band! Offers anything a Pearl Jam fan could want!! These guys stay true to themselves and that is a great thing in today's corrupt world!!,1350172800,,217,4.45

4829447,5,B005LLXB9K,Pearl Jam 20 DVD is is great documentary about Pearl Jam.  I found the history of Pearl Jams beginings interesting.  The video footage from 1991 was fun to see.  Seeing the band members talk about eachother and about the tragies they indured was inspiring.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who loves Rock n Roll.,1346457600,2,318,4.625
4829448,5,B005LLXB9K,Got this for my husbands birthday and he couldn't have been more excited ! It was really interesting and although I've always liked pearl jam watching this made me love them !

Personal glimpses into how band members felt regarding different events and turmoil.  Even some friends that are not necessarily die hard Pearl Jam fans were captivated by the movie.  Excellent directing and editing, out of this world music, and a story that made me laugh, cry, and ponder the meaning of it all. Loved it!",1340064000,2,459,4.7974683544303796

Shows the true face of pearl jam the good,the bad and the ugly moments the band and its members had, and if you already love them you'll end up liking them even more. An awesome movie not just in a musical level but well achieved through it all. Pearl Jam, there is more to it than meets the eye, and most of it is presented to us in this incredible documentary.
LONG LIVE PJ!!",1338854400,,437,4.214285714285714
4829451,3,B005LLXB9K,"Let me start off by saying that I'm a big Pearl Jam fan - from their beginnings - and bought Ten in late 1991 before it ""hit it big"" after hearing ""Alive"" on local alt radio.  I still feel strongly that it is one of the greatest and most influential rock albums EVER recorded. I was very excited to watch this movie/documentary, but, I must say, it left me disappointed. It started off very promising, with a compelling intro, but then failed to maintain the narrative. It amounts to a bunch of interview responses (not necessarily with the interviewer's question heard first) shown along with clips of the band playing live, presented chronologically throughout their career. Okay, so where's the backstory? Like: How *exactly* were you discovered/signed? What was it like recording your first album? How was it recorded? (tracked/live) Was it intimidating to work in the studio? (they mentioned that Eddie was shy; that's it on the backstory). What was it like working with Rick Parashar, the guru producer who crafted this *amazing* sound that was copied for a decade! Couldn't we have heard from him? Such a missed opportunity. Butch Vig gets so much credit (rightfully so) for his work with Nirvana. And, why did Pearl Jam later remix Alive for their greatest hits? Not covered here. How did they go about selecting producers to work with? Not covered. Also, the movie would have benefited from a consistent voice-over narration to tie all of the pieces together. There was some narration, but not enough. The musical-chair drummer situation was covered in under 30-seconds, over an hour into the movie; but this was a huge issue and influenced the band's sound as they moved from one drummer to the next. These differing *sounds* were not explored. The band was never asked to ""give me your thoughts"" on each and every album (great, good, bad, bomb), or ""which album was your favorite?"", or ""which songs are your favorite?"", or ""were you consciously trying to change your sound, or did that just happen/evolve?"". And, how about more info on their song writing process. We learned that Eddie took over from Stone somewhere around Vitology, but that was it. The deepest nugget was the seeming admission that the band recoiled (perhaps subconsciously) from success. These guys never really wanted to be this famous -- this should have been explored more. I shouldn't be able to learn more from Wikipedia than I did from watching this documentary. After the first hour it became apparent that the film just was not going to dig deeper. Don't get me wrong, it certainly has some entertainment and nostalgic value, but it falls far short of what it could have been. So, what could it have been, you ask? See the Foo Fighters ""Back and Forth"".",1336780800,11,2742,4.846481876332622

4829454,4,B005LLXB9K,"I saw Pearl Jam and Soundgarden open for Neil Young in 92 or 93 and then they slowly drifted off my radar. Then this last summer I got to see them both again. I saw pearl Jam at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto during the Toronto Film Festival where they premiered this film. The film is really good for someone like me just getting back into the band there was a lot I did not know or had forgotten so it was really interesting to watch. They had great interveiws with the band and Chris Cornelle from Soundgarden. It starts of with some great video of Mother Love bone which I had never scene before. It also had some Temple Of The Dog live video. Lots of great clips of Pearl Jam live (since they have so much live film and video I really hope they make a set like kiss did where you get multiple shows in one package) and great interveiw clips from throughout their carreer. However I do feel Pearl Jam must of had final say on the film because certain things get mentioned in passing (like drug problems) and very little of the internal struggles are talked about or expanded on.
I don't know how great this film would be for die hards. If you know the Band's history there won't be much here. Although the Grammy segment is classic. My only major complaint is the lack of bonus materiel. If you bought this from their web site you got four hours of bonus material. I am getting tired of the practice where you have to by things from certain sites to get bonus material. I know you are saying ""just go to their website"". Well in this case they are sold out and sometime it's not the Band's web site you have to go to. With Yes's Union DVD/CD you had to go to the web site of the company making the package. I also feel it punishes people who get into the group later on. I also know in my case it has discouraged me from getting into a group that I can't get all the product I want from. I did eventually buy their CD's but this happened when I got back into Iron Maiden because I could no longer buy their cd's with the bonus b-sides disc's. It has also stopped me from picking up their other albums because of the CD reissues they have started and you get bonus stuff when ordered from their site.
So over all! Solid Doc.",1334102400,,2228,4.183720930232558
4829455,4,B005LLXB9K,"While I really enjoyed this film I think it really could have been called 10 , as it really finishes after the first ten years of the bands life, or maybe Cameron should have just made a film about the Seattle scene and left it at that.
For me it is the last ten years of this bands life that are the most interesting, and while Crowe touches on the journey this band have made I felt he just let it peter out, maybe he had just had enough of making the film.
A really good film, but could have been better if the director had decided what kind of film he was making. Had me heading back to my Pearl Jam CDs though!",1333843200,,615,3.967741935483871

PEARL JAM TWENTY resumes the history of the band and also documents what happened in Seattle on those years...Pearl Jam create 2 of the most relevants albuns of that grunge era...TEN and VS...After that they continue to create great musics, never really selling their sound or becoming part of the mainstream! Eddie Vedder is one of the best lyricists of all time...The duo guitars of Gossard and Mc Cready are incredible and Ament are a great bass player...Pearl Jam is part of my life, thank you, guys!",1331337600,,609,4.648148148148148

4829459,4,B005LLXB9K,"I love this documentary. Cameron Crowe combines a whole lot of footage and music to create a poignant overview of the band and it's history. The interviews and contrast between members and their younger selves is interesting.

Praise for:
-Chris Cornell's interview. He brings an excellent perspective to the story.
-Mother Love Bone's story, along with Andy Wood's
-Stone Gossard admitting how much Kurt Cobain's criticism had on the band.
-The clever transitions to certain elements of the story.
-Great backstage/live stuff.
-Even the credits were fun to watch.
-Temple of the Dog

But wanted more history/info on:
-Other bands from the past (Bad Radio?!)
-Side projects of the guys (eddie's solo work, Brad, Mad Season)
-What about relationships with other bands from the Seattle area? (Alice n Chains, Mudhoney)
-How's about some info on Boom Gaspar?
-And how's about the influence PJ has had on so many other bands? Would love to know what the guys think of bands covering their songs...

So overall I LOVED this movie, but as a die-hard fan I guess my only gripe is that I wanted even MORE!
I can understand though, timing and how to make so much info from 20+ years flow together. Such a great documentary. And I find it funny how I so want this documentary to get an Oscar, but know that the band wouldn't care! Despite my wanting for more info, I felt like this documentary was a thoughtful love letter to PJ's fans.",1329955200,2,1426,4.765182186234818
4829460,4,B005LLXB9K,"I really loved this film, to be honest though I think that is intended for Pearl Jam fans. People I know who had seen it without knowing much of PJ gets a little bored in some of the parts of the film.",1328486400,,201,3.8095238095238093
4829461,5,B005LLXB9K,"I am 23 years old, and when I moved from Peru at age 12, my Pearl Jam collection and knowledge included some of their earlier stuff such as Ten and Vs and eventually I got their self titled album...that's it. I knew a few of their songs, some of their history and knew they sounded great, but somehow I just never really got into them they way a lot of people do you know? This documentary shows the history of the band way before they were Pearl Jam and their struggles after they became well-known and not only is the documentary extremely well put together but I have to say it, it made me a bigger Pearl Jam fan. I mean, here is a band I have kinda known, haven't seen them live yet but afterwards it left me hungry for more Pearl Jam. I sound lame?...maybe. I'm not going to pretend ""I have been a die hard fan for years"", all I know is that I have been studying their catalog since I saw the documentary for the first time and have never had so much fun in my life. Makes me wonder what I have been doing this whole time. Get it.",1328400000,4,1035,4.078431372549019
4829462,3,B005LLXB9K,"A friend mentioned that I had to get this DVD. My wife is a big Pearl Jam fan and the friend has been to five concerts, so I thought it was a good idea.  I ordered the Blu-Ray in advance and thanks to Amazon for giving me a refund to the lowest price before it was released, that rocks.  Unfortunately the content just does not.  I get the Seattle scene thing, but it is amazing how little they speak of or show Nirvana and Soundgarden.  Being a 26 year-old from Spokane, Washington, it was interesting to hear about Mother Love Bone and go back and look at all the connections going on that I missed because I was too young at the time, but I had to really read after the DVD to figure out why Pearl Jam formed as it did.

The bonus content is absolutely weak.  I expected much more out of this material.  Really, all it was good for was a laugh to find a grammy in a basement, and as justification to download music for free because musicians' cribs show they don't even know what to do with the money.

Finally, the real problem is I don't feel like I know Eddie Vedder better at all.  Maybe he's just another mythic rockstar, but one learns nothing more about him im my opinion, other than he drinks wine all the time...weak.

If you're a big Pearl Jam fan, enjoy, but if not don't expect to become one based on this footage.  Seems like it could have been so much better.  Oh, also maybe its because its really based on a book (same title) I learned after the fact.  I recommend the book before this.",1328313600,4,1505,4.2020905923344944
4829463,5,B005LLXB9K,"Here's some things I learned about Pearl Jam in Cameron Crowe's Pearl Jam Twenty, despite Pearl Jam being a band I thought (just by growing up in the 90s revering alternative music) I knew everything about: That Jeff Ament identifies with the LA Clippers, that the story of ""Alive"" is basically true because Eddie Vedder's father did die when he was 13 without Vedder knowing him, that Vedder had a penchant for climbing scaffolding in the early 90s, that Neil Young wanted to call Kurt Cobain a week before his death to tell him to take time off, that ""Ten"" the album was named after the number on Mookie Blaylock's jersey (because, of course, Mookie Blaylock was Pearl Jam's first name).  Crowe does such an extraordinary job recapturing what music was like leading up to Grunge's explosion in the early 1990s that not only do you learn to re-love its innocence, you learn - as Chris Cornell tells you early on - that those involved in the scene already disliked it even before anyone paid attention. Early on you see Andy Wood, the doomed tragic almost-rock star of Mother Love Bone, the proto-Pearl Jam, confess into a camera he'd even open for Warrant (!) if he had to.  A moment like that (it not only forces you to remember who Warrant is, but why someone would dislike them) shows you the innocence of a movement it wasn't even aware it could possess.

That's because Pearl Jam Twenty is a movie that in its singular love of a time bypasses any irony and lets you experience what seeing that music for the first time was like; in a way it's the first movie to treat music of the last 25 years with the same mythology of the rock music of the 70s. Pearl Jam, by surviving, get to present a surprisingly moving history of managing the modern rock business by, basically, doing what they felt like they were supposed to do.  You see the band's surprise at being famous and their unease about it in ways that, although sometimes speedily worked through, present what must be as accurate a portrait ever filmed of rock music in the 1990s, a time that people like me like to think of as important in music.  I could quibble with the movie's rushed we-love-the-fans recount of the band's love of switching up their playlist that help fill up the final fifteen minutes of the movie.  But scenes like that go a long way to sketching the details of what it's like to be a survivor of a genuine moment in music history.  By the end, you feel proud to have lived through it with a band who, truly, managed to always be themselves.",1327795200,2,2526,4.502183406113537

4829470,5,B005LLXB9K,"Wow, this is an amazing film. It starts off with the members of Pearl Jam (and other grunge star Chris Cornell) talking about the demise of Mother Love Bone, the band that included soon to be members of Pearl Jam. Then it moves onto them meeting Eddie Vedder and the band's long and great career from Ten all the way up to now. You will learn so much about the band from this. I am a huge Pearl Jam fan and found that I didn't know many things that were included in this documentary. Highly recommended to any Pearl Jam fans",1324944000,,524,4.198019801980198

4829473,5,B005LLXB9K,"I started out not liking them when I was a teenager not because of age, but it seemed over little time.. there would be a Pearl Jam song pop up on the radio every time I took a 10 minute drive somewhere and usually always the same few songs.  Well around here in these boondocks it hasn't changed too much at all and neither have the songs.  I did, however, fall in love with the Yield album and found their self titled a welcome change.  Other than that I blocked a lot of the other material out for the longest time.  This doc really helped me understand the pressures of the popular music scene and I could relate to this band a great deal.  Very entertaining and well edited.  I find myself listening to them a lot more often.",1323129600,10,730,4.215827338129497

4829478,5,B005LLXB9K,"Pearl Jam 20 takes a look behind one of the most influential, powerful, controversial and vital bands of the last two decades. Whether you've been a fan since before their formation from the remains of Green River and Mother Love Bone or novice new listener, this documentary is insightful and enjoyable for any audience while at the same time telling a true story full of emotions of this incredible band. It features some very interesting and rare video from the early days, including interviews and live shows of Andy(R.I.P.) and Mother Love Bone that any older fan will sure to enjoy. From triumph to chaos and contraversy and tragedy, it depicts it all and shows how the band persevered and why they are regarded as such a band today. Now, for the what you get on DVD/Blu-Ray, is the film and approx. 26 minutes of 'bonus' material, which a majority is seen partially in the actual film. Even on the band summary, it states there is over 1200 hours of video material collected. Now I know that would be rediculous, though incredible to release all of that(I know there is/was a bigger deluxe box set available earlier), but a little more extras could have been included for the standard editon, especially since the film itself was so very good. But overall, it is well worth the $15-20 range and is something any Pearl Jam fan young or old will sure to cherish years to come.",1322265600,,1381,4.640816326530612

4829480,5,B005LLXB9K,"What a cool movie.  It spans the whole 20 years of Pearl Jam with funny interviews and interesting commentary.  The old video clips are priceless, it's amazing to feel like you are let in to a secret inner circle.  The home videos are just fantastic, it makes you that much more connected to the group.  There are tons of stories that are never heard or rarely discussed.  It's a real trip, I highly recommend it for any fan!!!",1320710400,,427,4.423076923076923

4829482,5,B005LLXB9K,"I really liked this movie.  It took me back to my early 20's and the wilder years for me.  I remember the grunge scene coming of age.  The hair bands suddenly looked really stupid.  The movie recaps a solid 20 year run for a great band.  I have not played the soundtrack yet, all good things in time.  I liked how they gave a soild history to the band, no sugar coated turds here, just the real deal.  Vedder's comments at the Grammys surprised me.  They should have not even gone if it meant nothing to them.  Besides that, it was a great look back a super talented band.",1319932800,,572,4.174311926605505
