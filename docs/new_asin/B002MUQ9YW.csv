JOSEPH HAYDN /SINFONIA in D MAJOR(trk 2) /SYMPHONY in G MAJOR Hob. I:88 (trk 3-6)/ HARMONIEMESSE in B flat MAJOR,Hob XXII:14(trk 7-12) Soloists:  MALIN HARTELIUS,S.  JUDITH SCHMID,A.  CHRISTIAN ElSNER,T.  FRANZ-JOSEF SELIG,B.

Mariss Jansons finds the drama in these works without using excessive force. To me this is an ideal compromise between an authentic instrument performance, with straight tone singing in the mass, and a Romantic period performance with vibrato. In my opinion Haydn, in this mass, is looking forward to the Late Romantic at the age of 70.

The soloists are first rate, and the choir is almost as good.

What makes this DVD extra special is the beautiful ornate Waldsassen Basilika, which puts the music in an authentic setting. Most of the time we hear classical music in concert halls and opera houses that were built after the death of the composer. The recording captures the long reverberation time of the Basilika, while keeping the solos clear by using an excellent balance between the solo microphones and the main microphones. Sometimes the choir does not sound as clear as it should, but considering the live acoustic the choral sound is excellent.

It would have been nice to have subtitles for the mass. As a choral singer I have no need of subtitles, but newcomers would find subtitles very helpful. This is not the only DVD of Sacred music that does not have subtitles, so I am not taking off a star for this. The booklet does have the Latin text, but no English translation.  Tracks are listed incorrectly in the booklet and the titles for the mass are at the end of track 6 following the end of the symphony.  BR Klassiks needs to put in more tracks and list them correctly. They are new to the DVD business, so this does not surprise me.  From a marketing standpoint, BR Klassiks should have listed the works performed in larger print.  They got the really important stuff, picture and sound, right.

A short extra track with information on the Basilika would also have been nice to have.  If you have a super audio CD player you will want to check out the SACD hybrid CD of this performance. Bavarian Radio is now producing their own CDs and DVDs on the BR Klassik label. In addition, there are MP3 downloads available for less critical listeners. BR Klassik may actually make everyone happy with this approach. All versions are available from Amazon.

Sound quality is very good in the DVD LPCM format. I cannot test the 5.1 options on the DVD, as I listen with AKG 240 studio phones, nor am I going to test the SACD. A five channel speaker system that would do justice to the SACD 5.1 format is, in my opinion, a thirty five thousand dollar investment. Alternately good five channel sound is a massive speaker building project. The AKG phones have a transparency that speakers have trouble matching, so I am staying with two channel sound.

For Audiophiles BR Klassik is offering high quality recordings that will provide what I believe is a unique opportunity to compare several audio formats of the same performance.",1259712000,5,3083,4.7669172932330826
