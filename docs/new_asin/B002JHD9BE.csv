PARAISO TRAVEL [ENGLISH]

A dynamic visual approach enlivens this familiar portrait of cultural shock and shattered dreams.

The story about a young Colombian couple who take a shot and wants to try ""The American Dream"",  and land at the far side of ""paradise"".  This stranger-in-a-strange-land theme of alienation has been very well portrayed in a mix of bracing vitality and gritty authenticity.

The director establishes through fictional characters a heady atmosphere and strong sequence that places WOP immigrants in Queens,  New York - a famous resident area preferred by most low and middle class Hispanic and Latino community residing in New York State.

As many of us - trying to live the ""Now Non Existant American Dream"" - struggling to make a better life for ourselves, they end up losing each other in a never easy to understand process, especially for our relatives and family members who must pay a priceless cost.

The appealing pulse of the movie may be easily applied to your unique neighborhood anywhere within The States - from harrowing human-smuggling through your daily struggle to get your first job.

Needless to say,  Life in America,  especially nowadays,  is a bid for survival either in a cosmopolitan city like New York or in any other small town in the states. Highly recommended, especially for Americans and specifically for all those narrowed minded souls living in America incapable to understand this almost ""inevitable sociological change"", a land made up by immigrants. Premium image and sound quality Five starts to the director Simon Brand who successfully depicts ""Our Journey"" to America.

3938476,5,B002JHD9BE,"This is the story of two young lovers, Marlon and Reina who decide to migrate to the United States by going through Guatamala and Mexico from Colombia and then sneak across the border.  They end up in New York in search of Reina's mother and get separated.

As the movie opens Marlon storms out of a room after an argument with Reina and gets chased by the police.  After he escapes he realizes he is lost and has no idea how to find Reina.  He ends up going from Brooklyn to Queens (Jackson Heights) where the wife of the owner of a Colombian restaurant takes pity on him.  She finds a place for him to stay and then gets her husband to reluctantly give him a job.

All Marlon can think about is finding Reina and the movie switches back and forth between Marlon's struggle and search and flashbacks to how he and Reina left Colombia and went on their grueling trek to dangerous parts of Mexico and ultimately to the dangerous crossing into the United States.

The movie is full of many colorful and interesting characters such as John Leguzamo as an S&M lover, the weird people who occupy the abandoned building that Marlon ends up living in, and the sexy woman that made the crossing with Reina and Marlon, who Marlon later meets up with.

Marlon doesn't seem to realize what he has with the people who are very good to him including a budding Colombian singer who loves him.  Instead he continually obsesses over Reina, who is a bitter and corrupt individual.

The movie never gets boring and is both poignant and at times humorous.  I highly recommend this one!",1274659200,,1566,4.498233215547703
3938477,4,B002JHD9BE,"PARAISO TRAVEL  is an intense little film that joins the ranks of the other multiple films dealing with immigration, this one as seen from the eyes of those immigrating to the US.  It is a hard driving film with many messages about not only immigration but the rarely discussed aspects of the torturous route to get to this country AND the resultant disappointment/disenchantment with the America of the north - the supposed land of dreams. Written by Jorge Franco Ramos and Juan Rend&oacute;n and directed by Simon Brand, the film was made with a cast of relatively unknown actors (with the notable exception of John Leguizamo) and one wonders had the actors been more experienced would the film have been stronger.

The story relates the problems of two young people Reina (Angelica Blandon) and Marlon (Aldemar Correa) who 'escape' from Medillin, Colombia to make their way as immigrants  passing through Guatemala, Mexico and Texas on their way to New York in search of the American Dream.  The film is shot in flashback fashion: we are lead to believe that the two 'lovers' focus so strongly on their dream that they lose themselves in that pursuit.  What this film does in very strong fashion is show the grueling, harsh, despicable events that occur to immigrants in the South American countries on their way 'north' - some of the events are difficult to watch.  But even more strange is the response of the immigrants who do succeed in making it into the USA - without knowledge of the English language or the American labor situation and atrocious living conditions imposed on illegal immigrants.  Marlon in particular seems to view the plight of the illegals (street workers, flop houses, menial jobs) with disgust, choosing to focus instead on his fruitless plight to regain his lost Reina separated from him after a misunderstanding in New York.  To say more would spoil the ending.  Suffice it to say that the film show the ugly side of immigration and the consequences that too often replace the dreams of those who make the dangerous trip to this land of possibility. It is another side of the coin we should all know.  Grady Harp, April 10",1272067200,6,2155,4.828804347826087

We see the story of two immigrants from Colombia to New York told in a non-lineal format. The two lines of this young couple's trip through South America and resulting residency in New York are bounced back and forth, book-ended with an unusual ambiguity of character outcomes. I liked the style and the resulting quality of moods in each setting, and I really think he makes a competent film with this group of unknowns. The graphic storytelling mixes a spattering of family loss, hatred, love, and finding oneself while trying to survive as an immigrant in the US.

The picture quality and sound are done perfectly and the city scapes of NY looked pristine upscaled. I tried the English dubbed version but it was painful and the sound was not mixed well back into the main frame - the 5.1 Spanish was just right. The special features appeared to be thorough, but I could only muddle through the main 50-minute documentary/making-of as there are no subtitles (all in Spanish). A short picture gallery is also included. There are some stark and brutal similarities to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sin-Nombre/dp/B002FHGESI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sin Nombre</a>&nbsp;as also depicted in this film, but both are worthwhile viewing this quarter.",1257206400,6,1617,5.8808510638297875

8371471,4,B002JHD9BE,"The movie is interesting at the beginning, showing very realistically all the obstacles immigrants face.
Yet, the main character seems very weak and spineless to me ; just the longing to have sex with his girlfriend makes him undertake, as it seems, the journey from Colombia to the US! Once in the US, he is still obsessed by her, despite her obvious obnoxiousness and indifference to his fate. You feel sorry for him, but at the same time you cannot help thinking he is somewhat ridiculous.
The last scene is not very coherent with the reminder of the movie, and to be honnest a bit far-fetched.
Aside from Marlon, the other characters are interesting and also well interpreted (Ana de la Reguera is great). Altogether, I had a good time watching this movie, despite some aspects that could have been better.",1359849600,,810,4.75177304964539
