7872995,3,6304475926,"It is not as much about the animals as it is about the filmers of the animals.  The film could have alternate valid titles:

1. A Bartlett family vacation
2. Flying ultralight airplanes in the desert

If they cut the reality TV part of the show and edited the animal footage into  hour, it would be 5 stars.

The producers should have made a separate 'making of' film and concentrated upon the close-ups of themselves and introducing the whole family and their planes.  I regret to inform that there is a lot of self-promotion by the makers of this video.

My opinion:  I think National Geographic (of which I am a member) funded their field work.  Surely there must exist more animal footage?  We would enjoy that more than watching the Bartletts take off/land their pair of ultralight planes 10 times.  Taking their grandson for a ride, etc.  I have spent time in Namibia and heard other artists were kept out of the highly restricted Skeleton Coast park because of the Bartletts presence there.  And for the funding to them, and denying access to others, all we got to see was this little amount of animal footage and so much of their family life?  Disappointing.",1358208000,,1166,4.624390243902439

7872997,5,6304475926,"I remember watching this specific film years ago. So, while in Washington D.C., I was happy to find it that NG store in NG headquarters. This movie is one of the all-time greats that National Geographic has produced. Des and Jen Bartlett do a incredible job of showing the life of the elusive desert elephants of the Skeleton Coast of Namibia. Some infomation concerning other desert-dwelling animals, such as the giraffe and lion, is put in as well, but the main focus is the elephant. Their commitment to filming the beauty and ruggedness of the desert and the animals in it is evident in the beautiful shots and story. Were it not for photographers and filmographers like Des and Jen, the wild beauty of inaccesible places would never be known. I highly recommend this movie",1036108800,,777,4.762962962962963

I loved this program.  I especially loved the footage of the desert elephants.  They were wonderful.  I also loved the lions.  Thy were spectacular.  It made me sad to find that the local people had killed them.  Especially when the female was four months pregnant.  It makes me realize how prescious each animal is.  It makes me want to do something about it.  Where else in the world could you see footage of a lion feeding on a dead whale.  I particularly loved the behind-the-scenes look at the making of the program.  It was actually in the program.  Usually I find that annoying but not this time.  I found it added a lot to the experience.  It was like being there as they filmed.  The personal touch it gave made this one of my favorite National Geographic programs.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.",989366400,3,928,4.396449704142012
