1731748,5,B000069HPZ,"I was introduced to yoga a few years ago by a friend, but after being diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome I was in too much pain for ""normal"" yoga. So I went in search of something more back friendly and this was the dvd I found. I have to say that  after weeks of medication on top of medication to control the symptoms of this condition that this dvd has been more effective than any of the conventional treatments I've tried.

Unlike some of the other dvds I have seen, this one is not filled with complex moves that only the uber-limber can do. Rodney Yee's methods are easy to follow and very easy on the body. One small word of caution-you do need to follow either his words or his actions in some spots as he seems to reverse right and left at times. Aside from that, I could not be happier with this dvd.",1139011200,13,816,4.2243589743589745
1731749,4,B000069HPZ,I bought this to help improve my lower back.  This is a very good program for beginners with no experience in Yoga.  Rodney Yee's yoga attire is minimilist and that helped me to see how to position my body correctly.  Make sure you have a similar type of chair as used in the video.  I used my dining table chair and the chair's back was too high to do the back and leg stretches well.,1127692800,9,385,4.093333333333334
1731750,4,B000069HPZ,"This is a good beginning yoga tape. As I have severe damage to my spinal column, I was hoping for something with more modified poses. The routine is broken up in 3 sections: stretching, strengthening, and restoration. Overall, they are all good though, I think, a little short. I would not recommend this to anyone else with severe, cronic back problems-I cannot do many of the poses and someone who is not aware of their limits could aggravate their condition.",1126396800,12,461,4.775
1731751,4,B000069HPZ,"This workout could indeed be more challenging, but it does what it promises.  I got into yoga three years ago to relieve pain from a slipped disk.  The workout stretches out my back and relieves tightness/pain, and in a short period of time. With a little commentary on breathing technique, I think that it would be excellent for people who are new to yoga.  Those of us who are familiar with yoga can always adapt the exercises that we find too easy, taking it to the next level ourselves.

What I find most annoying is the series of ""commercials"" for Gaiam products--there are far too many.",1124668800,15,592,4.556603773584905
1731752,5,B000069HPZ,"Well, not really!  However, this DVD is a wonderful introduction to sitting better and exercises to take care of our backs.  I have been doing yoga for eight months and did not find the instructions for the various poses too easy or too hard.",1123977600,6,242,4.4772727272727275
1731753,3,B000069HPZ,"I like the 20 minute chapter where Mr. Yee takes you through some strengthening and stretching exercises. However, the first and last 20-minute segments are largely unproductive. The first time you use it, the first segment (""exploration"") does give you some insight into how your back works. As it has very little in the way of conditioning, you'll most likely skip right to the second (real) segment on a daily basis. The third segment (restoration) seems to be Gaiam's way of pushing yoga-specific merchandise (bolster, blanket, blocks, etc). Again, there is no conditioning here. I do think the ""strength and flexibiity"" 20-minute segment is very nice, and has helped a lot with my posture and given me better flexibility and relief from my herniated disk pain. So I personally think I'd buy it again, but cost aside there was a chance to make this a really nice 3-segment dvd and they instead made a decent 1-segment dvd.",1102723200,76,926,4.904458598726115
1731754,3,B000069HPZ,I had Rodney's original Back Care video and I bought this DVD to use for business travel so I could play it on my laptop in my hotel. It was WAY too slow moving for me. I plan to return it to Amazon. I was very disappointed.,1084147200,10,224,3.7872340425531914
1731755,4,B000069HPZ,"Excellent yoga instructor Rodney Yee offers this 3-part workout focused on strengthening back muscles to maintain a healthy back.  He utilizes props (blanket, bolster, chair, brick, strap) to make the poses more gentle and accessible to those at all levels of fitness (although absolute beginners should stick to his previous video, Back Care Yoga for Beginners).
The first 16-minute section concentrates on simple stretches to warm up your back muscles.  Poses are done either while lying on the floor or in a seated position, and Rodney uses a blanket to increase range of motion.  The second workout is a bit longer (around 18 minutes) and places greater emphasis on strength moves.  It begins with simple backbends (eg, cat pose) and moves on to standing poses modified by use of a chair; it ends with a series of lying stretches.  In the final workout, Rodney uses a wider variety of props, including TWO chairs and both the blanket AND the bolster.  This is a slow-moving, approximately 16-minute practice which focuses on relaxation through practicing a small number of poses for a longer period of time.
At times, Rodney's reliance on props is a bit distracting, particularly while you are trying to relax during the final section.  However, he always allows ample time to relocate the props inbetween poses, and his use of the props is definitely beneficial at some points, such as during the second practice.  Rodney's manner is extremely calm and relaxing, and his voiceover is always perfectly in sync with his on-screen performance.  One minor criticism is that he doesn't offer mirrored instruction, but this is easily ignored given his otherwise excellent cuing.  Overall, this is a very good workout by a master yoga instructor.",1062979200,158,1744,5.066433566433567

1731764,2,B000069HPZ,"I got this as a Christmas gift after finding it on Amazon and adding it to my wish list. This DVD is not easy to follow along and rather confusing:
- Most moves are single poses; thus no repetition to help you make sure the move is done correctly
- If you just listen to the words and attempt to follow along then you may be unable to do some moves as I've found references to left and right are incorrect at times. For example, the first triangle poses indicate to put your left arm on the chair and raise your left arm in line with your spine - not possible if you see what is visually going on. This again is incorrectly spoken when you switch over to the other side.
- If you are not familiar with yoga, some position references may not be understood, e.g triangle pose, down dog.

After watching it completely, I feel like the actor in the DVD was more interested in showing off his physique then actually being helpful to anyone performing these yoga moves. Very disappointing. I will never consider getting another GAIAM Yoga DVD again.",1489276800,,1043,4.376288659793815

1731775,5,B000069HPZ,"I really like Rodney Yee's teaching style.  It is simplistic, accessible to everyone.  Even during transitions you can see how he is moving from pose to pose.  It isn't a magic trick he's doing where you're in down dog and then wallah on the video your supposed to struggle into Warrior pose.  It's basic movements for people who may or may not have injuries or difficulties with movement.  Since I usually feel better and a bit more unlocked after following along with the video, I thought it deserved 5 stars.  I've also used some of his other videos successfully.  This is not ""weight loss/high impact"" yoga (although a distinct decrease in inflammation and bloating might result), this is healing yoga.

LONG story about my back pain ahead! Skip to ""END of long story!"" if you've no interest in why I needed this help video and only want to really hear about the DVD/digital program Pros and Cons. :-)

+++++++++++++++++
I've worked desk jobs for years, and after 2008 I have mostly worked in the video game industry. This means less than healthy hours worked for less than healthy durations, eating less than healthy catered food for too many meals of the day while sitting in less than healthy ergonomic conditions. We were usually given any ergonomic equipment requested: special chairs, foot rests, wrist rests, keyboards, lumbar cushions, etc. You name it. We were encouraged to get up and stretch regularly, but in reality this doesn't always happen when you are working on a deadline. You work, work, work and later you and your body regrets. This cycle is repeated hourly, daily, weekly... you get the idea.

Over the years I have luckily avoided carpal tunnel, but I have managed to royally mess up my back just by sitting and not exercising. I am not obese, but sitting too much is just really that freaking bad for your body!

I've had sciatica - in my 20s no less! - and it was brutal. It was a chronic issue for awhile. Then it sort of worked itself out with some stretches a friend suggested, and it only cropped up now and then until the specific sciatic nerve pain disappeared. Yet the pain in my lower back persisted, centralizing around a vertebra which could sometimes pop in and out of place. When it would pop out it would leave me hobbling or in near unbearable pain. In reaction to the pain my muscles would tense, which often seemed to be preventing the vertebra from realigning itself. Things all up my back to my neck and shoulders would be affected by the strain as my whole body would clench in pain throwing out the balance of the entire system, as it were.

When my back was out I couldn't get the Brita out of the fridge. When it wasn't out I was dealing with the aftermath of my body having seized up to ""carry on"" with life despite the painful lower back issues. It was just brutal. If I let myself think about it I would feel like I was ancient and that my body was trashed. At one point, with one job, I had health insurance for a brief period of time. Ironically it was at this time that I was so crunched that I couldn't get time off work during our launch push in order to go to the doctor. When I did get the time I happened to inexplicably not be in any extreme pain, but confessed it was at least an 8 on my pain scale when the back went out. Then I explained that I didn't want pain pills-- they make me feel dopey. I wanted to not feel crippled and I wanted my back to get better instead of relying on drugs to pretend I didn't have a vertebra popped out of place! The doctor really seemed to take me seriously at that point. I was given some muscle relaxers, which I sparingly used in the evenings when I really needed to, and a set of stretches. I was also encouraged to try yoga.

The pills helped me relax enough that I could literally pop my vertebra in place with my two thumbs. The stretches seemed to help but I felt sort of directionless with them. I got this digital download for my Kindle and when my job was lost in a company-wide layoff, when the muscle relaxers ran out - this program was still there for me and my back trauma. This program... I can't even begin to explain how good it is for me these last couple years!

Now, whenever I use this program I can go from a pain that is just under the pain-threshold I felt with appendicitis to literally nearly feeling as though I am floating on a cloud. But the first few times I was wobbly, unsure. The moves were weird, new and difficult-- I was (and admittedly am) really out of shape! But after watching it once or twice while trying to do the poses I got the general idea. The wonderful thing is that once you know the moves you can just listen, never having to crane your neck to watch as you yoga-pretzel yourself, because Mr. Yee does an amazing job of explaining every single move.

As you get more comfortable with the program, and you really listen to all the little things he says like ""feel your back release"" and ""breathe into the stretch""... and you close your eyes, really visualize and follow his guidance... this program goes from great to INTERSTELLAR! I was not exaggerating when I said I can go from staggering pain (can't push a vacuum, walk up the stairs, pick up a bottle of laundry soap without wincing at a sharp reminder pain and/or wrenching the lower back further) to complete bliss with any given use of this 50-something minute program. I have found that really visualizing all of Mr. Yee's breathing, stretching and visualization guides boost the results many times over. I also found that when I listen to my body - which will say similar and totally different things than your body will say to you - I don't ever hurt myself.

One last important thing for other newbies. Remember when I said I had never gone to a yoga class? Well, I have found that 1. I don't know how to do Downward Dog properly AND/OR 2. It just isn't any good for me. It makes my elbows hurt really badly and this strain ripples through my body negating the possible benefits of the pose. I tried to wiggle into a better pose. I tried to read how to adjust my posture, but found little difference in the discomfort level. I powered through it a number of times thinking my body would get stronger but... without a pro I have decided not to risk hurting myself and I just do child's pose and/or the cat/cow poses thing in lieu of the downward dog. I let myself really stretch into the poses thinking about broadening my muscles away from the spine, or stretching my arms out as far as I can. I breathe... and frankly it feels amazing. Then, when Mr. Yee is done with the downdog part of the flow, I carry on with the rest of the program and this works for me. You may need to make alterations of your own and all I can say is: really listen to your body and gently, carefully, do what feels right. I do, and because of this the program works for me and I get so much out of it. I couldn't be happier with the program as it is, or with my little adjustments and tweaks.

END of long story!
+++++++++++++++++

PROS:
-Soothing narration/soundtrack - Mr. Yee has a calming voice and there is a very subtle new agey track softly playing in the background

-Descriptive flow narration - Once you know the poses you never have to look at the screen unless you want (maybe to watch the pretty waves of the ocean?) because Yee will not only tell you the pose, but how to move into it, how to breathe and a large number of really helpful visualizations. He does a stellar job here.

- Effective program - This has helped me with lower, middle, upper back pain along with shoulder and neck pain of a variety of sorts. Every single time I do this video, especially if I do the whole ~50 minutes of it, I feel anywhere from ""just pretty darned relieved"" to ""ready to dance with a unicorn, fart sparkly rainbows!"" or maybe something more mundane like ""smile and just take a nap"".

CONS:
- No HD version - at least not on Amazon. I could take or leave this, honestly, as I don't ""watch"" this program anymore anyway. I listen and close my eyes and make my back feel AWESOME with it. You might care though, so I am mentioning this for you! :-)

-Pacing - There are times I just wanna sit in each pose longer and/or repeat one that is feeling REALLY good for whatever problem I am having that day. The program can be done as-is with no issues, and you will most likely feel beyond fantastic doing it that way, but if I wish for a more leisurely pace at times you may, too! When I am feeling rushed I will press my toe on the spacebar of my handy mini-wireless keyboard to pause the workout. Then I will hold the poses and/or do more of the ones I am enjoying. When I feel ready, I unpause and move on. Presto!

THINGS YOU NEED:
-Yoga block - at least 1 but 2 would be helpful
-Yoga mat - or not, if you feel comfortable in the poses without one.
-Towel - at least 1 but I find having a small one and a large one, pre-rolled and rubber-banded, to be very helpful
-Strap - you only need this briefly but it feels SO good! I bet you could substitute a belt or a strip of ribbon, cloth, etc. etc. if you were low on funds and a bit creative
-Bolster - I splurged and got a decent one (not one of the really over-priced name brand versions, but a firm, well-stitched one). I use it on its own sometimes when I am just a little uncomfy with my back or while I am reading in bed cause it is just so comfortable. I love it and it was a worthwhile purchase. You could probably substitute with a large pillow, cushion or something - again be creative if you haven't got the cash. If it works, and makes you feel great, I won't knock it!
- Chairs - 2, he uses folding chairs.

Bottom Line: I love, love, love, LOVE this program. I've used it MANY times in the last couple years and the ONLY thing that would make it better would be if I were more consistent in doing it. I admit that I often put it off until I am in pain, and that is a shame, because I feel like doing this program at least a few times a week could prevent the problems before they cropped up. My significant other has seen me in my worst pain and seen me after using this to mitigate said pain, and he agrees with me how great this program is. When I am just a little out of whack he will say, ""Why don't you do your yoga?"" and I smile and say, ""Yes, I think I will!"". I love him, too!

Best of luck to YOU and your back pain going away! I hope this review helps and that no matter what happens you find a good way to end your suffering. :-)",1428019200,4,9981,4.23869610935857

I'm not sure if it's just because I'm insanely anxious and the music or narration chills me out, but either way, I love it.  As for my back, in addition to being Perma-tense, I had pulled a muscle that was excruciating (had already seen my dr but was in pain and she told me to expect it to take about 3 wks to feel better).

Some people have said this DVD is too short but I find it a tad long, considering how many times you need to change positions and equipment (floor, chair, blanket and strap).  I have started doing this dvd part by part but I struggle with how quickly we are expected to shift from one accessory (or position) to the other especially with a sore back.

I could do without the chair movements and I usually skip those and to me, the best part is the first part and a section of the second part.

It is impossible to get into the positions he suggests because implanted surgical devices do not allow the movement.  Also, he often suddenly refers to a new piece of equipment, which might be a ""bolster,"" a rolled towel, a chair, etc, but if you have not WATCHED the whole video before trying it, you can't do it.

1731858,5,B000069HPZ,"I tweaked my back 3 weeks ago.  I tried a deep tissue back massage, heat and steam sauna, and my doctor put me on anti-inflammatory and muscle relaxant medication.  I felt like the pain was spreading down to my thighs and my whole body seemed to be getting stiffer.  The medication initially provided some relief, but the pain came back worst.  I decided to try yoga that would target my back and Amazon had Rodney Yee's back care yoga workout that I could rent/download immediately for 7 days.  I am a fan of Yee so I also ordered a back care workout.  So I rented it, and used it right away.  I'm was using heat and taking medication but this is what happened to me.  First, the workout requires a lot of equipment (strap, blanket, blocks, chair and bolster), I used things around my house, a cloth belt (strap), blanket and pillows (bolster), and I reached for where the blocks should be.
Day one
This was the most difficult, I was very tight.  I was tight in places that I didn't realize.  I had to keep rewinding the video to find equipment or get the equipment in the right position. I didn't want to miss anything and I wanted to do everything.  The ab strengthening is very difficult, so I supported my head with one hand and used my other arm for everything else, I still had back pain.

Day 2 was much smoother.  I knew what to expect and I appreciated using the blanket and strap.  When I finished, I was walking around putting everything up and I realized that my back wasn't hurting.  When I turned or gently bent down, because I was testing my back there was a slight twinge.  I didn't take any more medication only a hot shower.

Day 3 was the best.  I flowed through the workout non stop.  I still had to support my head when doing the ab strengthening, but I listened to my body.  My back is no longer hurting.  I haven't taken the medication in 2 days.  And a lot of stiffness is gone.

I believe this yoga routine helped my back.  I was doing a lot of things to help it, but the relief didn't come until after I started the back care yoga routine.  The best way to use this workout is to stretch to your flexibility.  If anything is hurting don't do it or modify it.  I really feel good.  I have 4 days left on my rental and I plan to do the workout everyday until it expires.",1390348800,10,2295,4.25
1731859,1,B000069HPZ,This video is nothing but a series of poses and one does not follow the next.  There is no talking which would be fine if there was a logical progression to the moves.  They bounce from the floor to a chair and back.,1389398400,3,216,4.0

It's broken up into 3 20-minute sessions - Exploration, Strength and Flexibility, and Restoration. The Exploration is a nice warm up. Strength and Flexibility is more traditional yoga poses so it's a little more challenging. Restoration is a great cool down with long, gentle stretches. If I don't have time to spend an hour the Exploration session is good. For those with severe back problems, you might want to stick with the Restoration session at first. It's very relaxing and the poses are not too intense. My only complaint is the amount of props he uses. I wish he would let you know at the beginning of the video what you'll need to start the session. Of course after a couple of times, you'll be prepared, but it's still nice to know that before getting started.",1381795200,,915,4.619631901840491

I am an advanced beginner who enjoys beginner YOGA dvd's, too. This was calm, soothing, peaceful and well-explained. The workout is gentle enough so that if you are coming into it with pain, you likely will ease it as the workout progresses. Breathe as much as you can! Be gentle with yourself. I go away from this yoga sequence feeling like a million bucks. Initially, I was bugged by needing to have a blanket, block and chair....but have learned to love 'em as they help ease the poses and make it gentler on your back. Besides, once you have them parked neatly next to your computer, its not a deal. The only part I caution is in the 3rd 'strengthening' section where the lunge pose into a forward back bend moves quickly. Watch your knees! All round an excellent back stretching and strengthening workout.",1375747200,,983,4.559322033898305

I would definitely suggest after using this dvd though that you have at least a couple hours to lay down or recline, it leaves your back very loose and somewhat tender so I'd lay back with an ice-pack for sure. The dvd was in good condition and I did not have any issues with the condtion of the dvd or it's packaging. This dvd came in good time as well.

There was too much involved laying on a chair... and I also felt nothing afterwards but frustrated and let down. I also wish I could return it.

I have been a fan of Rodney Yee for more than 12 years. His voice and teaching style suits what I am looking for in at-home yoga practice. I have several of his DVDs and I always have them in rotation. Back Care Yoga is not for an experienced yogi looking for a challenge. But, when I feel the tension building in my back this instantly eases and relaxes, even after one practice. I like how the video is divided into sections, in case time doesn't permit completing the full practice - or, for me now, at 5 months pregnant I can only complete certain parts.

1731882,2,B000069HPZ,"I bought this to help my bad back and aching joints. Seeing all the good reviews on Amazon, I figured I'd try it. This is my first attempt at yoga, which I tried after doing an aerobic program by Jennifer Galardi, hoping it would involve some stretching to help my pain. With a bulging disk, you shouldn't do much forward bending, at least not without keeping your back straight or arched. Unfortunately, most of the stretches in this DVD involve curling forward. So if you also have a bulging disk, don't use this program.

The production values are high, with perfectly flattering lighting and scenery, and there is a surprising long list of people in the credits (a large crew worthy of a TV series). With all the care taken to produce such a visually appealing video, you'd think they'd do a better job with the voice-over and music (I use that term loosely). Yee's voice drones incessantly over very annoying sounds that are more tones than music. Yee doesn't really explain the movements in an earthbound way, instead using loopy new-age phrases, something like ""let your arms and legs support your heart,"" ""keep your spine supple,"" and ""breathe through your spine."" At least my repeated eye-rolling has really relaxed my eye muscles. Even Jennifer Galardi did a better job of explaining in her DVD.

Even as a first-time yoga-doer, I found these programs to be too slow and insubstantial. As other reviewers pointed out, he uses and changes props too often,which kind of ruins the flow. I will listen to his suggestions for ways to sit in a chair that should help my back, but I don't think I'll use the rest of this DVD.",1365292800,3,1628,4.688811188811189

His use of props can be a bit distracting at first, yes, but once the routine is practiced a few times the prop usage flows well.

I do have lower back issues so I forced myself to go through the video, even though it was slower than what I am used to.  Rodney has some excellent stretches and poses to improve your back. Some of the poses I have not seen anywhere.  If you have back pain, lower or upper, you should probably get this video and do it.  It will help.  Just don't expect a workout.  It's good to do before going to bed. Also the production quality and setting are beautiful, far better than most.",1362182400,,621,4.211864406779661

The exercises are designed to relax and stretch your back as well as put you in a mentality where you're noticing and correcting your posture throughout the day. The poses were engaging without being too difficult, although it's definitely more about treating your back problems than being a challenging workout.

The tools used in the video are a mat, a blanket, a bolster, a yoga strap, two yoga blocks, and a chair. I don't have a bolster, a strap, or yoga blocks, but I was able to make do with objects around the house without too much trouble.

This video helped to assist me personally recover rather quickly by correctly mechanically reducing my pain. My only complaint is that Rodney, as great an instructor he is, moves too quickly between poses and does not give you a heads up as to what equipment you will need prior to beginning. Other than that, I would recommend this for people who are familiar with yoga and have acute as well as chronic low back pain.

I am trying to work this into my morning, with my ultimate goal to do this once in the morning and once in the evening. I am a mom who works full-time, so this will be very challenging. I was concerned that this would be too strenuous, but I would describe it as relaxing, light stretching. I did not know when I first did it that I was going to need a chair (such as a sturdy kitchen table chair) and a yoga strap. The first time I did the DVD I used a towel instead of a yoga strap but have since bought a yoga strap. (easier to use than the towel)I recommend this for anyone with back pain. I think with continued use that this could significantly help me. If you are thinking about it for yourself or as a gift for someone else and you are reading this review, just buy it!

The dvd ends with a relaxing series of restorative postures using props, that allow you to completely relax your back (and the rest of you!). All this with amazing Hawaiian scenery and gentle music.

Also there are no examples or suggestions of how to modify poses if you can't do what the instructor is doing.

I started doing this every day for one week while skipping my other workouts, then did this every other day in addition to my normal work-outs again and did it make a HUGE difference! This is excellent not only for pain, but I simply feel like my back is stronger and I am more conscious of my posture. This is now part of my normal routine and if my back flares up again, I'll do just this again until it feels better.

I purchased this item because I was looking for a way to work on back strength and to help with muscle soreness and strain. What I was not expecting was the number and different types of props used in the video. I was able to improvise and some of the props he uses are expensive and I have no intention of getting them.  A list of the kind of props needed or their equivalent would have been helpful - either in the Amazon description or on the back of the case.  That said, I have enjoyed the dvd and found it very easy to follow along and it is quite suitable for beginners. Although I am not a rank beginner, because of my muscle issues I found it helpful, especially before retiring for the night. Rodney explains and demonstrates the poses in a way that is easy to follow, even on the first viewing. And the pace is relaxed enough, so that someone with very tender muscles can keep up. The bonus section on sitting posture was very helpful and a good reminder about chair ergonomics and body mechanics for working while sitting on a chair at a desk.

It literally heads off trips to the chiropractor or pain specialist.

It has also helped me to become more mindful of my back and each of its components.  I have a much better understanding of the motion of my spine, the interaction of the muscles, and how my ribs and hips fit into the whole picture.  I'm much more able to relax individual muscles relieve pain on my own after having used this DVD for a few years.

I have had around a year of regular yoga instruction. Because I was teaching T'ai Chi at a yoga studio, I was fortunate enough to be able to experience some great instruction in a number of yoga styles.

I haven't been able to continue the classes, but I wanted to continue to work with yoga.

I should also mention that I'm 62. I'm in very good shape and reasonably flexible, but have to warm up thoroughly and move carefully through full range of motion exercises.

I liked the explanation of posture that makes up a segment of the tape, although, once I've watched it, I have no need to return to it.

The ""Strength and Flexibility"" segment was an okay moderate workout. I would say that some of the poses could be somewhat challenging to an inflexible novice. It would probably not present a real challenge to someone with little to no knowledge of yoga, if they were fairly young and flexible.

The exercises are useful for opening the hips and back (triangle pose, warrior 2, etc.)

The ""Restoration"" session is nice, but, along with others, I would prefer fewer (to no) props for my practice.

My favorite part of this DVD is the ""Exploration"" section. I find myself coming back to it again and again. Not because it's challenging -- it isn't -- very gentle and soothing stretching and breathing -- but because I find the combination of moves to be a wonderful cool down, post workout (whether I was doing a yoga/pilates workout or a martial arts/running/DDR workout).

I have his AM/PM Yoga for beginners DVD already and was looking for a way to branch out a little w/o getting too complicated. I was disappointed in this DVD. Unlike the AM/PM DVD, in Back Care he doesn't really explain too much about alignment - it seems to move rather quickly from one pose to another. None of the familiar pose names - no real focus on holding poses and centering and breathing - just blip-do this one-blip do this one. Too much concentration on a chair (and FYI you have to have one that is the perfect height to accomplish what he wants - mine was not!) and not enough deep stretching. It just didn't seem very yoga-ish to me. My back felt tight when I got done - popped in the PM yoga for Beginners & felt the stress melt away. Honestly I have almost zero interest in even playing this one again and I am very disappointed about that. :-( Skip this one and go for Rodney Yee's AM/PM Yoga for Beginners.

He provided no strength exercises but rather a bevy of different stretches. Don't get me wrong, they felt good and I always felt relaxed afterwards, but it simply was not what I was looking for.

1731950,5,B000069HPZ,"I wish I had purchased this program when it was first released. It is great for maintaing a healthy back. Recently I encountered problems with my back following an accident at home. Pilates and physical therapy helped but did not take me into the progress that this program has. Because pain causes stress, it has been therapeutic for body and mind connection and designed to keep the entire back strong while promoting proper body alignment.  As a dancer I am fit and practice yoga, but I needed a gentle program and sequence to promote instead of disrupting healing.
 If you are a beginner to yoga, you may be a little lost, so view the program several times or begin with Rodney Yee's beginner series. I would venture to say this is gentle yoga and very therapeutic for those trying to strengthen or rehabilitate the back.
There is a section designed with back care exercises includes proper body mechanics for sitting properly. The concept here is to correct the bad posture of everyday which can cause a degenerating back. Simple yoga stretches done in a chair can correct and prevent damage to our spine. Rodney Yee, alongside a physician, are  interviewed and offer advice and benefits of yoga.
The program is broken down into three sections:
1.exploration - simple seated stretches
 2. strength and flexibility gentle stretching, ie.lunges, Warrior poses, bent legged down dog
 3.restorative- deep undulating  breathing and relaxation, relieving tensions while resting on bolster seated in chair
Learning to let go of tension is perhaps one huge element is releasing pain. Learning to break the relationship that we at times acquire with pain is part of the exploration into the self. The concept here is that at times the pain can be tied to emotions. This program has soothing calming effects as Rodney narrates each posture, with cues on proper breathing . He is surrounded by peaceful nature and water as he leads into the poses. The background music is so relaxing and as he says. "" let go"", you simply let go.
 Simple items may be utilized to facilitate the poses into more gentle modifications. A bolster, 2 chairs, a blanket, yoga mat, and 2 blocks, these are simple measures that don't add up to the cost of prescriptions or lengthy doctor office visits and fees. The blocks allow you to maintain just enough length as not to compromise the stretch into deeper pose if you are not ready. If you don't have a bolster, 2 pillows tied together work great. I gladly gathered the necessities and begin the program. I modified each posture to my ability. In just one session, I had m relief and that was enough to know I was on the right track to healing. I paced my workout with few poses from each section and continue to progress with it daily! It is a must have for maintaining a healthy back-pricless!",1259971200,,2817,4.760245901639344

1731954,4,B000069HPZ,"NOTE:  This same yoga practice, now being release by Gaiam, was previously released by Living Arts.  It has also been released under the title ""Back Care Yoga,"" but it is NOT the same practice as ""Back Care Yoga for Beginners.""

Excellent yoga instructor Rodney Yee offers this 3-part workout focused on strengthening back muscles in order to maintain a healthy back. He utilizes various props (blanket, bolster, chair, brick, strap) to make the poses more gentle and accessible to those at all levels of fitness (however, absolute beginners should probably stick with his other practice, Back Care Yoga for Beginners).

The first 16-minute section concentrates on simple stretches to warm up the back muscles. Poses are done either while lying on the floor or in a seated position, and Rodney uses a blanket to increase range of motion. The second segment is a bit longer (around 18 minutes) and places greater emphasis on strength moves. It begins with basic backbends (eg, cat pose) and moves on to standing poses modified by use of a chair; the segment ends with a series of lying stretches. In the final section, Rodney uses a wider variety of props, including TWO chairs and both the blanket AND the bolster. This is a slow-moving, approximately 16-minute segment which focuses on fostering relaxation through practicing a small number of postures held for a longer period of time.

At times, Rodney's reliance on props is a bit distracting, particularly while you are trying to relax during the final section. However, he always allows ample time to relocate the props in-between poses, and his use of the props is definitely beneficial, particularly during the second practice. Rodney's manner is extremely calm and relaxing, and his voiceover is always perfectly in sync with his on-screen performance. One minor criticism is that he doesn't offer mirrored instruction, but this is easily ignored given his otherwise excellent cueing. Overall, this is a very good series of yoga practices by a master yoga instructor.",1240876800,60,2026,5.090361445783133

I did the am/pm in the past and felt great (am was best). I thought this would be just as awesome but more specific for my back.  Long story short - too many props for two little poses/ exercises/stretches. He goes a little two quickly between setting up props and doing the poses and his directions are too quick also. Toward the end I was like are you kidding me...I might as well just take a nap on my stomach.  I am just floored and feel like I am getting a migrane. My neck is stiff.

I've been suffering from sciatica for about 2 months, and Rodney Yee's DVDs are about the only thing that I have done that has yielded such fast & painless results. He REALLY helped me. I am still on the mend, but I feel MUCH BETTER after I do this sequence. It is very gentle and do-able for someone who is still in a bit of discomfort and trying to heal. The first two segments are comparatively more active, the third is mostly relaxing postures (btw, you will need a giant bolster or pillow for max comfort/effect). Its about an hour long, so I only get to it once or twice a week, I guess I could just do one of the 3 - 20 minute segments, but I tend to opt for a quick morning stretch with the AM yoga sessions (either his ""AM & PM yoga"" or ""AM yoga for your week""). It's hard not like Rodney Yee - he's so mellow and easy to follow. You do have to figure out the breathing most of the time b/c he kinda assumes you know when to inhale & when to exhale so it might be confusing for a beginner, but other than that, I love his work!

But I don't have all the props needed for this video..perhaps if i had a Yoga Bolster I would give it a higher review.  So this may be my problem versus anything Rodney Yee did.  My back hurt afterwards.  Maybe I was using muscles that don't get used often enough.  For whatever reason, I was a bit displeased and haven't used it since.

I recommend buying all the props that are required for the video.
I will probably eventually buy a bolster and try this video again.

I love Rodney Yee and will keep buying his videos.  The man is 50 or was last year....and is extremely hot, but even more than that he has a pleasant voice, good cuing, and is thorough with his instructions.  He is also very very experienced and he really knows what he is doing.

Rodney Yee and Patrica Walden make up for most of my yoga DVD collection...and they are better than other videos I have tried with the exception of ""Yoga conditioning for Weight Loss"" by Suzanne Deason. Her video is very high quality also.  I'm not very good with words, but what I am trying to say is that I put Suzanne Deason in the same category with Rodney Yee and Patricia Walden.

I have an extensive DVD collection. And I highly recommend any video done by Yee, Walden, or Deason.

I do not think we could have started doing the Back Care more often than this and we feel we have found a good balance with this regiment.

I usually skip the first warm up breathing segment, shortening the workout to 45 minutes, which is perfect. Unfortunately, it requires several props (inevitably something needs to be retrieved during the workout, causing me to angryily ruin my steady breathing and meditation grr) but these props definitely contribute to the workout in a vital way (especially if you do actually have back problems).  This was the first Yoga experience my sister had and toward the end of the video she asked 'So when do we work out?'.. she loved the relaxation of Yoga and was a bit sore the next day (the most delightful benefit such a workout).

1731973,4,B000069HPZ,"I bought this dvd because I read from the reviews that doing yoga to help with back pain can really help reduce or even eliminate back pain and I found out that it is TRUE. Now, I have always been skeptical of yoga. I did not believe that yoga could do anything but stretch you out. When I looked at a picture of some one in yoga pose, I always thought, how can you strengthen your body just from doing that? But based on the reviews, and the fact that I am in pain ALL the time because I have degenerated disks in my lower back and neck, I decided to give yoga a try. After all stretching did always feel good to me. So I looked up a few simple poses and it helps ease some tension. So I decided to buy a dvd. I did a search on yoga for backs and I found this dvd. Rodney yee's yoga is soothing and very helpful. I like his voice, he is not annoying like some yoga voices can be. I would have given it 5 stars but it took me a long time to get through the dvd, so that I could really learn the poses before moving to the next. It moves just a little to fast. But it is still a good dvd. The poses are very effective and it really does help ease the pain IF you keep up with doing it every day. The other thing I did not know is that I would need 2 yoga blocks and a bolster which I did not have the first few times I attempted to do this dvd poses. I just used a thick blanket rolled up as the bolster. Good dvd, very helpful but you must keep doing the yoga to reap the benefits.",1178409600,6,1481,3.811688311688312
1731974,1,B000069HPZ,"The poses/exercises in this DVD flow quickly from one to another. This might be okay for people who are experienced with lots of poses and movements, but it is very difficult for a beginner. It's pretty tough to keep one's head and torso in the proper position for a pose while looking at your TV to see what one is supposed to be doing. I've seen another video, Yoga for Dummies, where the instructor describes the pose and takes it slowly so that you can first watch it and then do it, before moving on to another pose. This video is not like that. The poses/exercises are verbally described simultaneously as they are performed by the instructor at full speed, and then it's on to the next section. The verbal descriptions tell the listener to do things like, ""Move into cobra pose,"" without any prior description of what ""cobra pose"" is, which this reviewer found annoying. Even worse, these exercises are difficult. If you have back pain, do NOT expect to be able to come close to performing most of these poses. This dvd might be good for healthy and athletic people who want to maintain and improve their back strength, but it is far too advanced for those who have back problems. Lastly, I always thought that breathing was a big part of yoga, but it is relegated to a secondary place in this DVD. I wish I had another DVD to recommend for back care, but I do not (yet).

A lot of the other reviewers have dissed the first section (""Exploration"") for being boring or not challenging enough, but it's just what I need.  My backaches are caused in part by contracted muscles in the lower back, and section 1 is really excellent at helping you stretch and relax those muscles. Section 2 is for strengthening and is also very necessary.

As to the props:  Well, we use a strap in my yoga class.  You can  get two yards of grosgrain ribbon at a fabric store for about $1 and you've got a strap.  I use a rolled up beach towel for the blanket, a folding chair, and skip the brick.  I used to use a large pillow for the bolster, but stopped using that as well.  I also occasionally add some poses from my yoga class when I feel like it to vary the routine and get an extra stretch.

I don't use this DVD anymore, because I don't care for Rodney Yee's style, which I find somewhat shallow.  I've been more impressed by the Yoga Zone instructors, who give in-depth explanations in a personable way.",1146009600,20,474,4.9
1731981,5,B000069HPZ,"This workout does a good job of targeting the back and helping build strength in the back. Some sections are very challenging while others, such as the cool down, are more easy going and are suitable for those with more severe back issues. There are also alternative poses for those that might be too aggressive for some people. I absolutely recommend this to those who want to build a stronger back.",1140998400,16,400,4.647887323943662
1731982,1,B000069HPZ,I have arthritis in my back and neck and this video exacerbated my back & neck pain from the 1st 5 minutes!  Since I had great success with AM/ PM yoga I thought I would give this a try. I am not a beginner & I have gone to many advanced yoga workshops without issues.  I thought this video would help me even more.  I was wrong!  I have had to stop all yoga for the last 3 weeks after doing this video only once.

I love Yee's other sessions, and they work very well. If you already have back issues, please look into hip opener sessions. Do NOT get this.",1518739200,,271,4.666666666666667

But starting slow over weeks, then moving up to the next one really helped.
I can honestly say Rodney Yee has changed my life. This series, and my determination has helped me. Thanks Rodney, you are really making a difference...
BTW: On gaia tv ($10 monthly) they have this series, rodnetly yee other series and hundreds of others. And they have awesome shows, docs, org programing.....",1507248000,,495,4.7011494252873565

7965476,1,B000069HPZ,"I bought this DVD along with Back Care Yoga for Beginners (also Rodney Yee, front cover of DVD jacket has green border; back cover has photos of Yee in black shorts; run time 30 min). I understood from the reviews that this DVD is a more intermediate version for yoga back care.  However, when I popped in the DVD it was the same exact video as the Beginner one.  (I checked the back jacket of this DVD, which has photos of Yee in blue shorts and says that run time is 67 minutes).  In a nutshell, I bought the same DVD twice.",1499558400,,526,4.137254901960785
