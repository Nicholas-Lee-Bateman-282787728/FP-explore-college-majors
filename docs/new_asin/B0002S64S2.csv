8031017,5,B0002S64S2,"This is the one that starts the whole series and it is awesome, well at least in my book it is.  Lorenzo Lamas pulls off another great acting job at Rio Arnett.  If you are a fan of the series Air America then watch this one first because it tells how Rio comes to Costa Perdida and to his surprise an old friend is running the airport.  Rio gets a chance to work with his father on a mission and while on that mission something goes wrong, the mission now for Rio is to find his father who he believes is alive and was not killed in the explosion.",1363219200,2,548,4.009174311926605
