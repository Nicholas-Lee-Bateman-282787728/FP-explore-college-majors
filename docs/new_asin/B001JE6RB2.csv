8365544,1,B001JE6RB2,"We like the DVD but the format is in PAL and can not be played on my DVD player (I have PS3)/  it can only be played on the computer.  The DVD is from Europe and is in Europe format not US format. I wish I would have known that when I made the purchase - I would not have purchased it.  All buyers from the US beware - or you may be dissappointed.

When I first heard of this project, I thought, wow, what else is he going to surprise and bless us with.  After all, he is a true entertainer with a fine voice. Can't go wrong, It's got to be spectecular, just like all his other DVD and audio releases. Was going to buy the CD and DVD, but opted for the DVD instead.....  Glad I did not buy the CD!
While the DVD is recorded in HiDef quality, both the sound and video are top notch, with true DTS surround sound. Even my audio system enjoyed pouring it out.  However, the review is about Helmut's singing, and, well, he just does not get it right.  While he does well in some numbers, You still can't help but feeling like there should be alot more coming from him, and you wait with anticipation, but never delivers.  Perhaps this type of American Swing Standards are a bit off for him, who knows, but his rendering of all these wonderful classics are a bit too mediocre.  I so wanted him to succeed with this project, but for me, it just did not work.  I would have loved to give this DVD a 5 STAR rate, and would have just because it's Helmut, but I honestly could not. Being good enough is just not enough.",1252972800,,1234,4.243589743589744
