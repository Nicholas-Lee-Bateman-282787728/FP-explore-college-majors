8276800,1,B001AD54NO,"*1/2. Only a few scenes of the film will linger in my memory : Jack Palance's performance as the sadistic Ogatai, Gengis Khan's son, Anita Ekberg and Antonella Lualdi as the Blonde and the Brunette who, this should absolutely be noted down here, will be equally savagely flogged by Jack Palance and the numerous quicksands (that's very personal, I love quicksand scenes in movies). What's left of the film is already forgotten.",1322697600,,427,4.944444444444445
8276801,2,B001AD54NO,"After obtaining this movie years ago on VHS, I had high hopes for the DVD. Not so. Sinister Films has done nothing to improve the picture quality which, at times, appears to be almost devoid of color. The only saving grace is a beautiful score by Mario Nascimbene (SOLOMON & SHEBA, BARABBAS, CARTHAGE IN FLAMES, THE VIKINGS, ALEXANDER THE GREAT, ETC.) which unfortunately has never been independently released though promised decades ago on vinyl. Perhaps Peplum will yet release this score on CD.",1310688000,3,497,5.0
