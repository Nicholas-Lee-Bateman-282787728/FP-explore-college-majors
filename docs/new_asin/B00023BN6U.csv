I didn't think I'd like a show about Japanese boxers but I was WAY off.  This show is awesome in so many wayz.
Its about a kid named Ippo who gets picked on cus he has to work with his mom on the docks all the time, has no social life, and goes to school smelling like fish.  One day he is rescued from the bullies by an up and coming boxer named Takamura who happens by.  Ippo then decides that he wants to become a boxer.  Things get crazy from there.  You'll laugh, cry, and roll on the ground laughing some more.  This show will own you.  Crazy characters Aoki and Kimura, Takamura, Mashiba, ect.  You'll like this anime even if you don't like boxing.  My sister loves it!  I hope it becomes really big cus I want them to make more episodes!!!
Havent watched it with the English dub yet.  If I do I know I'll miss Takamura's psycho laugh that always cracks me up.  We'll see how it goes...",1087171200,5,1069,4.116504854368932

8021170,5,B00023BN6U,"I was not enticed to see this series at all, let me tell you.  When I first saw the previews for it, I was not impressed because I thought the series was an older one due to the style of the animation.  For more than a year, I kept seeing preview after preview on some of the other anime DVD's that I watched and the one thing that stood out was the catchy title song on the previews.  After some time, I stopped seeing those previews, but the song stuck in my head.  So, as I like music, I went along and rented the first disk--hear me now--just so I could listen to the title song.

I heard the song.  I watched the episode.  I was hooked from then on.

No, hooked isn't enough.  Addicted is more like it (so much so that I bought the action figures).  This show has so much more to offer than a catchy title song.  It has everything you want in an engaging story.  A relatable character, great cast of supporting members, and one of the best uplifting stories you could ever watch.

You really care for everyone in the series--even the ""bad"" guys.  Not only that, they do justice to the sport of boxing.  Everything in this anime has a foundation to stand on, even the boxing.  They treat it with respect, and you will definitely know a thing or two about the sport after watching the first disk alone.

By far, this is one of the few anime series that deserve a much broader appeal and exposure than what is mostly on TV these days.  I would swap all of the anime shows on TV, just so we could get this one show on.  It is that good.

Buy this DVD.  It is not a waste of money.  It is an investment into pure excellence.  Something you will remember for a long time.

Must have.",1159833600,15,1682,4.136222910216718
8021171,4,B00023BN6U,"Ippo Makunouchi is a high school student who is too wimpy for his own good. Some yakuza type bullies with pompadours are constantly terrorizing him and beating the snot out of him just for looking at them wrong. You know Ippo has more spirit than this though, because he does grueling work every day long past school hours to help out his widowed mother's fishing boat business. It's a wonder he has any energy for school. In the midst of one of his getting his butt kicked sessions, a jogging passerby, Takamura, who also happens to be a boxer, rescues Ippo from certain injury. In awe of the older man's skill, Ippo begins to realize that maybe becoming a boxer is his destiny!

While everyone knows the familiar pattern of the Karate Kid and Rocky in which a relative newbie goes through intense training and soul searching to find the extraordinary talent that lies within themselves, this does not lessen the quality of this good show. Just because a story has been done before does not take away from the truth of its message. The character of Ippo is at times pitiable but he never gives up and really does want to start a new life of courage. The quality voice acting accentuates and broadens even the stock characters and the animation is pretty good for a tv show. I could have done with less of some of the slapstick comedy because it doesn't work very well, but is a minor fault. I look forward to see how this show develops.",1139097600,,1437,4.505747126436781
8021172,5,B00023BN6U,"Ippo, a timid highschooler, is one day saved from being beaten up by Takamura, a boxer. Enthralled by Takamura's skills Ippo begins to learn boxing, soon finding love for the sport and a drive to challenge the boxing world.",1127692800,,223,4.743589743589744
8021173,5,B00023BN6U,"This is my absolute favorite anime bar none so whatever I may say will be biased towards it. Even if you have no interest in boxing, this show will still keep you begging for more as the characters are likeable and identifiable. There's no convoluted plot lines like Evangelion or confusion like Lain. It's a simple, straight forward, feel good anime which is what makes it tops in my book ahead of my other favorites Initial D and Hikaru No Go. Even better, if you're any kind of martial artist or fitness enthusiast, watching Ippo train and fight will keep you working out, if not harder, as you become inspired to keep going. I suggest, even if you're only a little curious, to go ahead and pick up or rent this anime. I'd say, 99% of you will like this anime. Even if you've seen the episodes before it got licensed, pick it up and show your support. No matter where you got your shows before, nothing will be as clear and crisp as this release except for the original Japanese dvd releases. I watched the dubbing and it's not bad. Of course, imo, the Japanese language track is always the way to go, but the english dub isn't as bad as the Initial D dubbing. Plus, Geneon kept the original sound track to the anime in the english track so you won't find any annoying weird metal rock music like you would in Initial D.",1089158400,6,1323,4.382113821138211
8021174,5,B00023BN6U,"Hajime no Ippo- or Fighting Spirit, as it has been localized, is one of the best shows I never thought I would watch.  Along with Initial D, it fits a peculiar genre- really good stories in subjects I have no intrest or background in.  I am a girl- and about all I know of boxing is 'Mike Tyson's Punch-Out' back on the NES.  When Ippo was reccomended to me as a character development/sports action story that any fan of 'Whistle!' and 'Prince of Tennis' should like, I was doubtful.  Thankfully, my friends kept at me until I watched it to shut them up- I owe them one!
  To set the tone, let me tell you that even the title is a play on words.  Hajime no Ippo should translate as 'Ippo's Beginning', Makonochi Ippo being the tititular character.  However, ippo can also translate as step, makeing the title read, as this first DVD, 'The First Step'.  The animation quality is good- with only a few recycled scenes, and the characters develop in a realistic manner.  The series goes on for 3 seasons- 78 episodes- and a movie.  The only dissapointment that a real fan of Hajime no Ippo might run into is that, even at 3 seasons, there was not enough time to tell all the stories covered in the 60+ manga.  However, for any person just consittering 'Fighting Spirit', for any reason, think no longer- this one is a keeper.",1088294400,6,1322,4.439834024896266
