8568913,1,B00BI6SOLM,"So having been brought up on this show in the UK, I thought finally someone would have seen sense and released the ORIGINAL version of this show.
Unfortunately I can guarantee everyone reading this, if you buy this DVD you will be short changed again.

I managed to get my hands on the Second Sight Region2 releases for comparison - and am sad to report that even within the first 3 minutes of the first episode of the first series there are edits and cuts  (what for example, is anyone thinking that an incident on a train, about a handkerchief and someone blowing their nose on a newspaper is too offensive for the audience).

I wouldn't mind if this was a more recent show, but I imagine everyone who is actually buying this knows what they are getting.
I also accept that it may be down to the regional censors more than the Entertainment One people releasing this in the US, but either way it seems ridiculous.

I'm going to reach out for a UK copy of the 5 disc collection (but I hear those have edits too) - who know with all versions we might actually be able to cut a whole, complete series together.

Seriously people if you've got this far to read the review, abandon all hope - and save your money.  If you really want a copy, get mine off ebay.com (which is where its going right now).",1369353600,28,1298,4.3429752066115705
