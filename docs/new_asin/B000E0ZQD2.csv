8324259,5,B000E0ZQD2,"A psychological thriller - without violence!  What an exceptional treat!  Formidable acting by the late Guillaume Depardieu (son of Gerard).  Will be looking for his other films.  Not a realistic plot but well carried out with a deeper meaning of inner struggles.  Not top notch in any way, just well done in its unique style and overall pleasing.",1487116800,,347,4.913793103448276
