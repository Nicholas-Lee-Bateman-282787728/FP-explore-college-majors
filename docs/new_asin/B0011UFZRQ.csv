8242400,3,B0011UFZRQ,"Lorna, a wealthy woman who lives alone in the country, is visited by a female friend who asks her to look after her maid, Triana, while she and her husband are away.  Triana is an orphaned Gypsy and illiterate.  The friend tells Lorna that Triana has nightmares and a fear of horses as she leaves.

Lorna awakes to Triana shooting at a naked man on horseback (Mr. Nude).  She says he has followed her here and her palms read that if she takes him as her lover, someone will die.  That evening, Triana starts to make a move on Lorna, leading her to figure out that she was sent away after the husband discovered that her friend and Triana were lovers.

Lorna takes Triana into town, buys her clothes, takes her to the museum, and out to dinner.  Triana explains that she is afraid of lightening since seeing a man struck (""Everything was blackened except for his teeth"");  Lorna adds that her husband was killed when his car struck a tree (he may have committed suicide since their marriage was so bad).  That night they become lovers.

The following day, while walking by the river, Mr. Nude tries to rape Triana;  she stops him with a rock to the head.  That night, she tells Lorna about the incident and that this is the second time he has tried to rape her.  Mr. Nude shows up at the house (clothed) to return the necklace he ripped off of Triana earlier.  Triana is rude to him (with reason).  Lorna's reaction?  She scolds her and tells Triana to thank him for returning the necklace, and invites him in.

The story continues as Lorna tries to balance her relationship with both Triana and Mr. Nude.  Yes, there is nudity in the film (which seems to be what a lot of other reviews seem to focus on).  The story moves too quickly, especially towards the end.  The parts are there but not fleshed out.  I found the ""rich people are jerks"" ending pretty amusing.

This is a good movie if you like watching cult ""classics"" and Euro-exploitation but don't mind a ""meh"" storyline.
