8022500,5,B00025JZO0,EXCELLENT TRANSACTION ... FABULOUS DVD ... THE BEST !!!,1502236800,,55,5.222222222222222
8022501,4,B00025JZO0,"Released in 1972, Piranha chronicles events when a brother & sister photography team (Tom Simcox & Ahna Capri) enlist a guide (Peter Brown) for a tour in the jungle wilderness where they meet a friendly-but-mysterious hunter named Caribe (William Smith), who lives in the jungle. Caribe shows his true colors when he acts upon his Native namesake.

People badmouth this movie because they fell prey to a bait-and-switch by DVD-makers or whomever. This is NOT the Roger Corman nature-runs-amok flick of the same name from 1978. Neither is it a creature feature at all. It's a realistic Venezuelan jungle adventure/thriller with hints of horror highlighted by genuine early 70's atmosphere. Despite being an adventure/thriller, the title Piranha does not misrepresent the movie, which is explained in the second half and ties into the plot (Im not going to give it away). Another thing to keep in mind is that the movie was released in '72, three years before ""Jaws"" made nature-runs-amok flicks popular. So the filmmakers didn't title it ""Piranha"" with the intention of misleading fans of creatures-on-the-loose flicks.

In any case, the cast is great, although they coulda done better with someone other than Capri in the female role, even though she plays the part well despite my slight misgivings. Simcox is a likable masculine protagonist and its too bad he didn't become a star, although he had constant TV work. Brown is good too, but its Smith who towers here, literally at 62, but in overweening taciturn charisma as well. Caribe seems like a cool guy to party with in the jungle and the quartet have some good times together, including a long (8.5 minute) motorcycle race, but the story takes a dark turn in the final act. Ive seen a handful of Smith films & TV episodes over the years and this is by far his best role.

Some complain about the stock footage of numerous animals, but it adds to the jungle atmospherics. Others complain about the thinness of the plot and the seeming padding with the animal, Native and diamond-panning footage, etc. This has have caused some to criticize the movie as a Venezuelan travelogue, but I enjoyed this aspect. Viewing the film IS like vacationing in Venezuela and I found it interesting and informative, but its just a stage for the interesting low-key drama of the quartet. And, say what you will about the thin story, but it gels together into a meaningful whole with interesting things to glean.

If you're in the mood for a 60s-70s psychological adventure/thriller I recommend Piranha. However, if you need an explosion every second and unrealistic action sequences to maintain your attention look elsewhere.

The film runs 90 minutes and was shot entirely in Venezuela.

8022502,1,B00025JZO0,"No horror, one place where the piranha fish shows up. Two people die before Piranha the poacher dies. Not worth the money to make the movie.",1376092800,,140,4.423076923076923
8022503,1,B00025JZO0,"Wow.  I was looking for piranhas here, but did anyone find any yet? We have watched over half the movie and not figured out the meaning yet - and DEFINITELY have not seen any piranhas.  Not a good movie.",1324512000,,203,4.17948717948718
8022504,1,B00025JZO0,I can't imagine anyone creating a movie like this.  There is nothing in it worth watching.  Terrible script and only one scene showing bubbles that are supposed to be piranhas.  It wasn't the movie I thought I ordered.  Now it's filed in the trash can. Would like to know plot before ordering movies.,1296518400,,300,4.60377358490566
8022505,4,B00025JZO0,I received the video in a timely fashion. Good movie if you're into 70's cheesy horror movies. May be cheesy but it blows away current efforts like Saw.,1274572800,2,152,4.464285714285714
8022506,3,B00025JZO0,"A photographer and her brother go to Venezuela on a quest to see one of the last undisturbed places on earth. Their guide takes them deep into the rainforests, where they meet up w/ Carib (William ""Invasion Of The Bee-Girls"" Smith), whose name actually means piranha! Carib acts like a total nut from the start, but our heroes ignore his weirdness and let him take them even further into the middle of nowhere! Along the way, Carib shoots just about any animal in his path, putting the photographer gal's nerves on edge since she abhores guns and violence. While watching this unfold, I kept yelling at the screen, ""Why are you idiots following this maniac?!"" Well, my cries went unheeded, as the ding-a-lings went right on following! In true early 70s fashion, the final 20 minutes hold most (in this case ALL) of the suspense. Carib reveals his true eeevil self. ""DUH!"", I screamed at my television! Anyway, I'd recommend hitting the old FF button during the wilderness and diamond mining footage, leaving a nice little 45 minute movie...",1157932800,3,1040,4.815642458100559
8022507,1,B00025JZO0,"With a title like ""Piranha, Piranha"" you might expect to see a few piranhas in this movie. Don't be ridiculous: what you actually will see is unending scenes of industrial diamond mining, motorcycle racing, and absolutely unending hunks of stock footage of every kind of animal (mostly birds, but also lots of alligators and sloths) known to man. I would guess that literally over half the running time of the movie is stock footage.

The plot, as thin as it is, concerns a whiny female photographer and her accomplice going to Venezuela to photograph wildlife (hence the premise for the stock footage padding). Once in the jungle they meet a certifiable lunatic (who dabbles in sadism, rape, kidnapping, and killing exotic animals) who ends up chewing the scenery for the bulk of the movie. In the end almost everybody dies, and you will never guess the stirring conclusion. Well you would never guess it if you had zero brain cells, but a single-celled organism can figure out the ending about five minutes into the film.

This is not only not about piranhas (they are onscreen for maybe 15 seconds), it is not about much at all. Count yourself among the fortunate if you can somehow manage to fall asleep during this stinker. This film is truly amazing in its utter inability to either entertain or excite. Do not waste your time on this red herring, red herring.",1134777600,12,1366,4.7594936708860756
8022508,1,B00025JZO0,"Desperately seeking diamonds, a band of adventurers discover that life in the wild is not all fun and games.  After traveling throughout the land on motorcycles and seeing several scenes of birds, they stop at a local pub to drink heavily and absorb the culture.  As they become engulfed into the culture and the land, they gather the aid of a hunter named Caribe that has not only mastered a bike race, but also harbors a darker plan.  When they arrive to their destination the sight of diamonds turns to dust as these friends are forced to play prey and predator with an evil that wears a familiar face.

William Gibson directs this poorly acted, scripted, and pause-ridden suspense thriller that is easily lost in the shuffle of modern day cinema.  The low budget is very obvious as Gibson riddles the film with overlapping scenes of birds, birds, and more birds to fill time.  We are even shown unending scenes of diamond mining and bike racing, leaving nothing to develop characters or story.  We are even shorted on the title of this film as there are only two mentions of the flesh eating fish.

Back-stories are underdeveloped leaving us a lack of emotion for the main characters and building an emotionless climax that only gave us hope that the film was over.  Nothing was worth saving in this film, unless you enjoy studying birds from different countries (outside of the one that the film takes place). Gibson missed the entire focus of this film and the final result reminds us of a preschooler's first collage where there were tons of images, massive amounts of glue, and no real structure.

Grade:  * out of ****",1094428800,8,1627,4.693661971830986
