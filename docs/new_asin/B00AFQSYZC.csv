8551101,5,B00AFQSYZC,"This series stays close to the Baum source, and should familiarize viewers who have only ever seen the MGM movie adaptation with the author's original vision. The nearly 30-year old Japanese animation still works quite well.",1425168000,,224,5.25
8551102,2,B00AFQSYZC,"The TV show is fine, it is a good introduction to the sequel novels and the original Oz novel. That is precisely why I purchased this set to introduce Oz to a special child.  What I am disappointed and pointing out in this review is on the disk content. The first copy I received had the closed captioning for another movie, one that has adult language and situations. I thought the disk with a few scratches had been tampered with even though it was NEW through Amazon. I contacted customer service and received a replacement set,  no scratches- same movie closed captioning. I tried it on other players same result.",1414022400,,617,4.6

8551104,5,B00AFQSYZC,"I used to watch these movies on TV as well as rent them on Videocassette growing up. A great item to add to your collection or as a gift to someone who is a Oz fan.  If you enjoyed the original Wizard of Oz as a child, you'll also enjoy watching these 4 movies on two discs.",1394841600,,274,3.807017543859649
8551105,2,B00AFQSYZC,"I haven't bought this one as it is the exact same as the first dvd box-set Lightyear had released.

It is decent enough, but I have actually emailed them that I was not happy with both versions being severely cut and that they needed to release a box-set with all 52 episodes on it, netflix.ca have it, I am just waiting for netflix.uk to get it (hopefully).

So I know that the episodes are not lost and that they are just being lazy.

It is not worth buying because of the amount of episodes cut from the original story line and some of it doesn't make sense and I have seen the originals  repeated in the uk in the 90's and I remember it extremely well.",1391299200,,656,4.182539682539683
8551106,5,B00AFQSYZC,"Thank you so much for delivering on time,this was a gift for my 29 year old son who is a fan and collects everything from THE WIZARD OF OZ it bring back lots of memories.",1387929600,2,170,3.8857142857142857
8551107,4,B00AFQSYZC,"I've loved this series since I was a little kid so I'm pleased to see it re-released and cut down to 2 discs to mark the 25th anniversary, but I've got a bit of a bone to pick with Lightyear Entertainment. Why aren't there any extras? It's been a over a decade since the original edited VHS releases so why no behind the scenes bonus material, an interview with the cast, or even a quick run through of Baum and the history of the Oz books? Well I guess you can't have it all and this is better than nothing so if you're interested, give it a go. Now if we could only get all 52 episodes on DVD....",1378684800,2,598,4.033613445378151
