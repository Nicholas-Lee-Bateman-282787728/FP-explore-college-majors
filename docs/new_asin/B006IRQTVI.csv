8498780,3,B006IRQTVI,"This single-DVD package comprises three Discovery channel specials on oceanography.  The first, Dive to the Bottom of the World, follows a group of scientists seeking biological and rock samples from the Marianas trench.  Unfortunately, this episode is largely unresolved: the scientists successfully retrieve their samples, but there is no explanation of what the evidence means, or its broader significance.  The second, Cracking the Ocean code, has a more coherent narrative.  Again, a group of scientists are in search of samples in the Pacific, but this time the findings are clearly explained: the microorganisms are of interest in studying the food chain, and may be useful in generating biofuels.  The third, Ocean Voyagers, follows a group of humpback whales.  This episode is visually beautiful but the commentary is rather sparse.",1520121600,,841,5.48062015503876
