1805768,4,B00007CVRJ,"Jose Carreras and Agnes Baltsa are in excellent voice for this performance, Piero Cappucilli is fairly  good but i'm biased because i don't like him very much. The biggest suprise comes from the King (i can't remember his name but his face is right infront of me) I saw him as leporello in Don Giovanni with Bryn Tefrel and Renee Flemming in the title roles and he is much younger in this and in much better voice as well. WELL WORTH THE BUY!!!",1152489600,5,444,4.349397590361446
1805769,4,B00007CVRJ,"I've always found Verdi's brilliant ""Don Carlo"" (here presented in the 4 Act Italian version) something of a curiosity in that the title character has so little to do.  Everyone else gets moment after shining moment, yet Carlo, after a busy Act 1, is pretty much window dressing.  Too bad when you have such a charismatic tenor as Jose Carreras in the role.  Watching him in this live performance from Salzburg makes you long to see what he could have done with the original, Fontainbleu Act 1.  Maybe it's just as well, however, considering Carreras's Elisabetta, Fiamma Izzo D'Amico.  There's a reason you've probably never heard of her; her voice isn't bad, but she has absolutely no stage presence whatsoever.  D'Amico pretty much wears the same sour, ""what's that smell?"" look on her face from beginning to end.  I understand that Elisabetta's having a rough time of things, but a better actress could have found some variation in her portrayal.  Thank God for Ferruccio Furlanetto and Agnes Baltsa, the two best reasons to get this DVD.  (And at this price, why not?)  Each gives a fierce, stunning, definitive performance; I cannot imagine anyone live or on tape who could possibly interpret these roles better.  Cappucilli is terrific, a real throwback to the golden days, when opera singers stood on stage and SANG.  He doesn't quite bring down the house as he does on other DVDs, but at least he's not mugging to the audience, as was his habit.  The production director and designers make good use of Salzburg's cavernous stage, and von Karajan does very well by the score.  All in all, this is a solid, no frills production -- except when Furlanetto and Baltsa are on stage, when they set off real fireworks.",1145404800,39,1719,4.802721088435374
1805770,5,B00007CVRJ,"Don Carlo by itself is one of the most interesting and refined operas of Giuseppe Verdi. Here there is a great cast with specially strong points in the Bass and baritone roles( Furlanetto: Felipe- Cappuccilli: Rodrigo - Salminen: The great inquisitor). There such a link between those three singers; expression, vocal perfection... Then we have a very well selected Don Carlo (Carreras) although for making the dream team i woulded chosen Placido Domingo for the title role. Carreras sings in a very good level, showing real Carlo. The two female roles are also in a very good level (Izzo D'amico and Agnes Baltsa). Baltsa combines an expressive acting (sometimes a bit exagerated) with an exelent vocal performance. Izzo D'amico is maybe less expressive, and her singing is very good, not at the level of a Mirella Freni, but I found it interesting.

Von Karajan conduction is subtle, refined as this opera requires. His orchestra responds to the perfection that he (VK) demands and has no weak points.

I highly recomend this version to every opera lover or interested about listening a great musical work.

Levine's version is also one Don Carlo to watch, with Domingo, Freni, Ghiaurov, Furlanetto... Domingo and Freni make the difference, but Karajan conduction makes more sense for me than Levine's.",1134950400,19,1304,5.08411214953271
1805771,5,B00007CVRJ,"Don Carlo was my first opera and probably because of that it holds a special place with me. I love this opera and Jos Carreras himself said in his book ""Singing from the soul"" that hard pressed and after much agony this would probably be his ""desert-island-opera"".

In this dvd Jos Carreras is playing the heartbroken Don Carlo, son of the king of Spain. The king has just married Don Carlo's beloved Elisabetta. They married to seal the peace between Spain and France. Elisabetta is still very much in love with Don Carlo, but of course has to deny her love for him, being married to his father. Carreras looks wonderful as the tortured Don Carlo and sings even better. There has been lots of talking about his voice being to ""light"" for this kind of repertoire. I find his voice perfect for this role. Instead of just blasting away in the arias and making Don Carlo sound like a warrior he gives us a subtle portrait of a heartbroken, young hero. His sweet, honeyed voice is just right for this purpose. In the duet ""Io vengo a domandar"" with Elisabetta you can see him hoping for a sign from her that she still loves him and he's totally deflated when she tells him goodbye. I also love his facial expression when he tells her that he loves her so much and doesn't care what happens to him. It's just spot on. Don Carlo and Elisabetta's duet where they're singing about meeting in a better world (Ma lassu ci vedremo) in the final act is heart wrenching. The two voices melt together just perfectly.

The very young Fiamma Izzo D'Amico (she was 22 years old at the time of this performance) is playing the role of Elisabetta. It's true that she has the same tortured look throughout the opera, but her voice is just wonderful. And wouldn't you also feel depressed if you had to marry the father of the love of your life? As I've mentioned before, her duets with Carreras are outstanding.

The now late Piero Cappucilli who possessed a very beautiful baritone is perfect as Rodrigo. He's a very involved singer and his death scene in the prison with Carlo is very moving. Even though he's dying his singing is really good.

The greek firework Agnes Baltsa has the role of Eboli. The scene with Don Carlo and Rodrigo in the queen's garden is wonderful. Her fury and her facial expressions when she discovers that Don Carlo is in love with the queen instead of her (as she herself believed) are priceless. She can belt like no one else to give the performance that extra ""umph"". But she can also sound heavenly. Later on she's giving us a fiery rendition of ""O Don fatale"".

King Filippo is wonderfully portrayed by Ferruccio Furlanetto. His voice being rich and dark can sound like a dictatorial king, but also like a vulnerable husband who's not completely sure whether his wife really loves him or not.

Matti Salminen who has a booming basso gives us a portrait of a really frightening inquisitor and he's certainly not a man to mess around with.

Even though it's a fairly long opera it's highly recommendable. I can't decide whether this would be my desert island opera, but it sure comes close....",1126915200,16,3104,4.561938958707361
1805772,4,B00007CVRJ,"Although there are some really wonderful things about this production of Don Carlos, it is far from definiative.

  My most bilious comments go to the stage direction.  This production, unlike that of the metropolitan with Domingo and Freni, make no attempt to produce dramatic dividends.  Leads stand near eachother and sing, cues in the lyrics for actions are ignored and the Chorus files in and out.  It is left for the individual charachters to create their own magic with out the inspiration of a talented director, which was somewhat a ditractor.

  The singers, alhough somewhat old and tired, turn in some good performances.  Carreras is Don Carlos, and he does alright.  This performance sits in the very end of his vocal decline into operatic obscurity before leukemia hospitalised him in 87.  He seems very intent and focused on his singing and forcing his voice to work, rather than acting.  He looks down a good deal, and displays a forced focus which is not in the drama.  The sound is very good on the bottom and the middle, but frayed, foggy and uncomfortable on top.  This is evidenced in the passage Sire Egi Tempo Ch'io Vivo, where his voice nearly gives out on the B natural, in a ugly note.  Dispite yelly and uncomfortable passages, he is a world class singer, with unrivaled phrasing and  integrity.

 Fiamma Izzo DAmico is Elisabetta.  She was unimpressive to me.  he acting was not good,  She merely displayed an unhappy scowl, and there was no attachment to Carreras's Don Carlos.  Vocally she was average, with a credible top, but not enough to command the orchestra on the bottom.  She was unable to overcome her one-sided portrayal.

Agnes Baltsa is Eboly.  What a rush it is to see Agnes.  She belts as if she were in Les Mis, and flips between head and chest.  This causes a hole to open up in her voice between F and C, where, when she doesnt belt, she get very little sound.  She has some very irksome vocal passages where she sounds hoarse and scratchy, and seems on the verse of losing it in Don Fatale.  But although the voice is chancy, it is also thrilling and visceral, and Baltsa knows how to be melodramatic onstage, so she adds much to the performance (If I were carreras I would have merely forgotten the princess and taken the wild Greek Baltsa)

  Thee real winner of this production is Feruccio Furlanetto as Phillip the second.  His look, his eyes, were so convincing.  His pain, his turmoil his rage were visible from the start.  His acting is extrodinary which he carries through his incredible instrument.  He rivals Giaurov, not in vocal volume, but in tonal intensity and charachterization, 5 stars to Phillip here.

  Cappucilli, does anything but mail in his performance, he is honestly vocal involved in the drama. But he sounds strained and tired in thhe twilight of his long carreer.  His top has a uncomfortable strain, and the open snarl of his voice had become too much by this time.  But his acting, and his portrayal betray his aging voice.

The supporting cast is again good, and this is a great addition to the great Met production of around the same time also on Dvd.",1115510400,31,3132,4.680147058823529
1805773,4,B00007CVRJ,"I was during the first hour or so tempted to call this opera an archaic bore, vast stretches of tedium broken only by the rare appearance of a plodding warhorse of an aria anthologized so often I could hum along with it.  But it improved, tunewise.  It was not ALL Wagner.  The veil song was indeed and inexplicably halved, as the only other reviewer of this item pointed out.  However I did not see in Baltsa (whom I like) another Callas, fire-breathing or otherwise.  And Elisabetta's voice (particularly in Tu che le vanita (there now, I mentioned an aria, a bit of red meat for the erudite) her big number) was very slight and lacking in force.  Other than that, it was a very pretty voice and I thought she used it nicely.  The staging was wooden and melodramatic, characters struck poses to end scenes, which I kind of liked, it gave a nicely old fashioned, period piece flavor to the opera that I liked.  I have the original French version on DVD, but I was so truly bored after an hour and 20 minutes, that I shut it off.  Maybe, since I liked this version and also have and like the CD set of it (also with Karajan, Carreras and Baltsa), I'll take another crack at it.  Better than wasting all that money before giving it a 2nd chance.  Incidentally, the price of this DVD (the one I'm writing about) is a steal, I don't remember what I paid for mine, but for the music and the price, I recommend it.  Finally I want only to say that the story is good (if you like to watch christians burning heretics), it was a joy to see Karajan smile during his curtain call, and everyone sang beautifully, although d'Amico's voice (Elisabetta) was though pleasant a little weak.",1091145600,5,1675,4.420195439739413
1805774,4,B00007CVRJ,"This is DVD of a 1986 Salzburg Easter Festival live performance
and as such it has all the excitement and sense of occasion of a
real thatrical experience. Karajan, of course, controls the whole production, being his festival. The Berlin Philharmonic in the orchestra pit is something few recordings of this opera can compete with. Karajan conducts without a score in his usual transcendental manner. The total effect is crisp, powerful, dynamic, precise, tightly controlled and well detailed. His approach works especially well in the powerful climaxes, dramatic exchanges and the great assembly scenes. The finale of Act 2 (the Auto da fe scene) is superb.
The singers are what makes this performance so extraordinary and
memorable. The opera requires six top quality singers. Karajan,of course,hand picked them for the roles, using some of his perennial favourites and some newcomers. Agnes Baltsa and Jose Carreras plus Piero Cappuccilli are some of the perennials.
They are beyond praise. Baltsa probably ""steals the show"" with her wonderful voice and fire-eating, Callas -like dramatic and
emotional acting ability. Carreras, Karajan's favourite tenor, uses his voice articulately and with great inspiration. Cappuccilli,one of the great Italian lyric baritones of our time,
as Rodrigo, truly shines.
Ferruccio Furlanetto creates a deeply moving portrayal of Philip II. His great aria in the third act and subsequent exchange with the Grand Inquisitor are Verdi at his best and Furlanetto does great justice to it. Matti Salminen, the great Finnish basso, has
a stentorian voice and mighty presence-thoroughly frightening as the Inquisitor.
Finally, as the Queen, Fiamma Ozzo d'Amico, relatively lesser known, a young Italian spinto soprano, is equally at home in the
lyrical parts, but fully capable of dramatic outbursts. A beautiful woman, certainly looks the part. In her final duet with Carlo one can almost feel sparks flying between the two and
understand why the two were in love with each other.
Important note: This is the four act version, which has been used
successfully for over a hundred years. There are some minor cuts Karajan makes for the performance. E.g. Eboli's Song of the Veil is chopped in half, quite inexplicably-this way the song is incomplete and makes no sense at all! The CD set, however, is complete.
Not everybody likes Karajan. I personally prefer Giulini's more fluid and graceful style which gave him such resounding success in London. However, there is no video of Giulini that I know of.
Nevertheless, I can sincerely recommend this DVD, it will give
ample satisfaction. It comes on one disc, handsomely packaged with a well detailed booklet. The sound is first rate.",1058313600,111,2711,5.248847926267281
1805788,3,B00007CVRJ,"In my opinion the initial Fontainebleau scene is essential to the opera.  When it is omitted, which it often is unfortunately, it impoverishes the whole opera, musically and narratively. The story and the musical themes are all determined in that primal scene.  That said, the opera is quite good. Furlanetto may not have had his infant wife's heart, but he sure steals mine in his solitary lamentation.",1293580800,5,403,5.0

A friend of mine who bought this DVD told me that the direction and acting were very good, but the sound and quality of the DVD were not. I agree with the first assessment but not completely with the second, it is true that the DVD is not HD production  and of course the differences are noticed when an old production(before 2000)is compared with the new ones (after 2000).Although the scenery and color were good.
I wasn't surprised with the acting-singing of Jose Carreras, Ferruccio Furlanetto, and Agnes Baltza,I know them from other performances, but the rest of the cast that I didn't know were also very good in particular Piero Capuccilli who played Rodrigo,Marchese di Posa.
Karajan as a director and the orquestra were great, but it is also not a surprise.

1805792,5,B00007CVRJ,"Superb DVD. It is well-balanced between the artistic talents and the technical endeavour. Most opera DVDs are far too dark.  This one is bright and colorful, especially for a 1986 recording. Artistically Von Karayan deserves the major credit.  He probably picked the singers. I observed no weakness in the DVD.
Baltsa: What a supreme performance!  Her O Don Fatale is a show stopper, and the audience showed their appreciation.
D'Amico: Excellent actress/singer. Her demonstration of pain is subtle, but unmistakable.  It complements her beautiful singing.  I disagree with the negative comments about her.
Carreras: As always, Carreras is Carreras, a passionate singer-actor.
Furlanetto:  Beautifully portrayed the inner pain of a powerful monarch, vocally and dramatically.
Cappucilli:  The chemistry with Carreras is a corner stone of this opera.
Bottom Line:  Undoubtedly this DVD is a best buy (<$10).  One cannot afford not to buy it, thanks to Amazon.",1278806400,4,958,5.462585034013605
1805793,5,B00007CVRJ,"I was very pleasantly surprised by how wonderful this production is. No tired singers here: the cast is uniformly wonderful, the sound is great, and Verdi's glorious music drama is brilliantly captured on this DVD. Personally, I prefer it to the Met's DVD of ""Don Carlo"". Carreras is my preferred ""Don Carlo"", and I don't miss the music from Act I, which, to my ears, has never measured up to the rest of the opera.

Two big thumbs up for this ""Don Carlo"". If I ever end up on a desert island, I'll happily take it along with Karajan's ""Verdi Requiem"" - another fantastic DVD with a young Pavarotti & Ghiaurov.",1235520000,5,610,4.495495495495495
1805794,4,B00007CVRJ,"For once Karajan does something I can stand.

OK, that's not fair, he was good at live precision-comedies when he was young, and his ROSENKAVALIERs and FALSTAFFs are standard-setting.  Let's say, for once ELDERLY Karajan does something I can stand.

The main thing this performance gets right is the weakness of the characters.  Furlanetto is not a power-singer nor a giant nor even a true basso; his King's principle emotion is fear and his impotence is evident from the first note.  It's OK, the King is weak, but it's supposed to reveal itself gradually.  Jose Carraras' weakness is more appropriate.  Even Piero Cappuccilli's Roderigo seems worried and depressed rather than reckless, as if he knows what's coming.  Self-confidence is reserved for Matti Salminen's super-athletic Grand Inquisitor, and Franco de Grandis' Old Monk/Carlo Quinto.  Grandis is one of two singers this performance introduced me to that I'd like to hear a lot more of; the other is Fiamma Izzo d'Amico.  Every sound she makes is gorgeous and she's SOOOOO hot.  For once we can see, rather than imagining, a young Elizabetta.  (There's another good thing about Karajan--his long series of proteges specializing in ultra-feminine, ultra-vulnerable heroines.)

I don't know how old Agnes Baltsa is but she still has her gifts.

The staging and costumes are excellent too.",1234915200,,1349,5.185185185185185
1805795,4,B00007CVRJ,"Ok my research was on this opera so don't you dare mark this review as not helpful (just kidding).  First of all, Don Carlos is one of the most coherent operas in the Wagnerian sense where a motif underlies an event and tells the story as opposed to insipid Italian text.  In the case of Don Carlos the friendship motif becomes the very core of the opera making four appearances each with its own meaning.  This opera is the most meaningful of all Verdi operas.  In philosophy, very close to Beethoven's ode to joy or Fidelio, but in music half way italian and half way Wagnerian.  Bizet, if you respect his opinion, hated this opera.  But I love it.  I have played it all the way through.  Ok but as for this production.  The real Don Carlos is long, very long.  Karajan boldy cut the entire first act.  So go figure.  But the production is lavish and Carreras is magnificant and Elizabeth is very beautiful.",1182124800,8,909,4.442424242424242
1805796,5,B00007CVRJ,"I thoroughly enjoyed this performance. I think this is a mixture of French ""Grand"" and Italian opera, and the performance does it justice. The characters are a great mix of sympathetic and unsympathetic, but they are deep and complex and you can understand why they are the way they are. There are few caricatures.

Vocally, this is in general a large-voiced cast, and everyone is in good form. Carreras is a sympathetic and convincing Carlo -- not too strong, not too weak, but ambivalent as he should be. Furlanetto's brooding and conflicted Philip has a huge voice and  his character is suitably complex. Izzo D'Amico's pure and dutiful Elisabetta (whom I had never heard of before) has an excellent voice, and I don't mind the fact that she's not very dramatic: hers is the character who manages to restrain her emotions until the very end, and she lets her voice do the expression. Cappuccilli's loyal Rodrigo is vocally expressive and moving, such a wonderful example of sacrificial love and friendship. Baltsa's Eboli is a bit too melodramatic for my taste, but what passion and fire in her voice!

The different characters' attitudes towards God is also very interesting. Religion is abused by the church and the state, but faith also provides great personal hope and motivation for characters like Elisabetta and Rodrigo.

Karajan's Berlin Philharmonic creates a rich luxurious sound. There are times when it overpowers the voices, but not too often.

Visually, it is good, though a bit drab (OK, considering the dark nature of the plot and the many sad situations), and there were too many ""sideways"" shots of the singers, but the clarity and general quality is very good for a live performance. The auto-da-fe scene, while big grand and aurally impressive, was the only disappointment for me, as I thought more could have been done to make it more interesting visually.

The price is an amazing bargain too. Recommended for anyone who loves Verdi and grand opera. I wouldn't make this your first opera if you're a novice to opera, because other works (by Mozart, Rossini, Bizet, earlier Verdi or Aida) might have more ""upbeat"" numbers that have more immediately accessibility for a newcomer.",1177113600,9,2202,4.970108695652174
1805797,4,B00007CVRJ,"The great age - and almost at its sunset!

1986 Salzburg - the great karajan vocal triangle Jose Carreras, Piero Cappucilli, Agnes Baltsa, all on their peak, and as the Chinese Iching saying goes - ready for decline.

The star of the show is undisputedly Ferruccio Furlanetto, the best Philip II since Cesare Siepi. And Elizabeth de Valois, sung by 22 year old Fammia Izzo D'amico, is fresh of voice and lovely to behold. Her vocal fireworks did not take place until the very last Act, and she rose to the occasion fully. Where is she now?

Yes, the big names, Carreras, Cappucilli and Baltsa to varying degrees sounded tired.  There was a gap in Baltsa's upper and middle registers not noticed in her earlier years.  Cappucilli sounds tired as Posa, and Carreras had slight difficulties with the top B flat.

Furlanetto, not old at all in 1986, portrayed a suspicious and conservative king, outwardly powerful but inwardly insecure. His vocal eloquence increased even more with his big aria, sung to great height and deeply moving as well as abounding in beautiful tone.

Salminen is as imposing as ever as a basso serioso.

7975030,5,B00007CVRJ,"Despite some minor blemishes, this is truly a Don Carlos for the ages, as is the audio set based on this grand Salzburg production. While this is not Verd's most famous or popular work, it could be argued that this is his finest work. All a matter opinion and if you are reading this review, you are probably a fan of the opera. If, as Caruso suggested, Il Trovatore requires the 4 greatest singers in the world, Carlos needs the best 6 plus a virtuoso orchestra under the control of a maestro who understands the detail in this score.
Karajan's conducting of this performance is outstanding, although different to the studio recording where the tempi are generally slower and more measured. The detail and subtle textures are beautifully expressed while the musical climaxes are huge. Some will argue that the occasional swamping of the singers is undesirable but I did not find the balance a problem. Karajan's obsessive attention to the dynamics works wonderfully and the pianissimo moments are highlights.
The sound quality is every bit as good, if not superior, to many more modern DVD productions. The viewer is presented with a huge reverberant sound stage to match the large physical stage at Salzburg. If there is a minor quibble, it would be the relatively poor picture quality and, to be fair, I don't know whether this title is available on blu-ray.
the 6 greatest singers in the world? Perhaps not but it would be difficult to imagine a finer cast assembled on one stage.  Jose Carreras is in wonderful voice in the title role, golden toned and sung from the heart. His phrasing is ideal for Verdi, although there are one or two slightly strident notes up the top.  Elizabetta is wonderfully performed by Fiamma Izzo d'Amico. The size of her voice is quite a revelation but she sings with restraint, intelligence and great sensitivity. The moments when she lets go and really opens up are quite breathtaking. Agnes Baltsa is a wonderful Princess Eboli.  Some vocal purists may frown disapprovingly at her obvious split between registers but it is all part of the Baltsa package and she turns it into a dramatic virtue. This lady is a true diva who gives her all on stage and leaves nothing in the dressing room. Her portrayal of the famous aria "" O don fatale"" is a one of many great highlights. The second verse of the veil song in Act 1 is cut for some unknown reason and does not quite make sense.  Piero Capucilli gives a subtle and intelligent performance as Rodrigo, the true hero of the piece who sacrifices himself for the less deserving Carlos. One might argue that the Capucilli voice had seen better days but his effortless bel canto enables him to shine in the more lyrical passages that often bring bigger voiced baritones undone. His stagecraft is wonderful, slightly underplayed but most effective. If there is a performance of the night to be awarded, it has to go to Ferruccio Furlanetto as King Philip II. It is an exceedingly difficult role to maintain. One moment, he is the all powerful tyrant, the next, he is tortured by his own personal doubts and fears. The scene in his chambers, commencing with one of the great bass arias of all time, and culminating with Eboli's lament, is compelling viewing and listening. In particular, the confrontation with the grand inquisitor is well managed. Matti Salminen makes a grave and menacing figure as the blind old zealot with the fate of Spain, the king and half the known world at his mercy. The king's illusion of power gradually evaporates in this scene, a tribute to Furlanetto's acting prowess.
The production and staging are generally powerful and convincing despite a few awkward moments, including the very end of the opera, which I found slightly uninspiring.
Overall, this performance is an operatic tour de force with exceptional singing from a stellar cast and great playing from a mighty orchestra.  If you are a lover of this piece, you will not regret having this set as part of your collection and will enjoy it many times over.

The only outstanding performance is from the little known soprano, Izzo d'Amico, who displays a firm knowledge of the Verdi singing line.  The rest of the performance, visually and vocally is a dull reflection of the aged conductor's temperament in his last years.  Too bad.",1360540800,,354,5.175438596491228

7975033,5,B00007CVRJ,"""Don Carlo"" is Verdi's grandest, greatest operatic achievement, in my humble
opinion.  Exquisite music throughout, with wonderful roles for all six
principal singers.  I am sure that perfectionist, genius Giuseppe Verdi, would
have been absolutely delighted with this performance.  I most certainly am
thrilled to enjoy this magical experience of a wonderful opera, performed to
perfection, under the calm, dignified and so precise direction of the brilliant
conductor, Herbert Von Karajan.  Every principal role was acted and sung as if
this production was their masterpiece performance.  The orchestra and chorus
were of a similarly high standard.
This tragic tale of multiple, unrequited love relationships is set to music which
embodies all the emotions, drama and passions of everyone involved.  The love duets, with Jose Carreras and Fiamma Izzo D'Amico, were so intense and realistic
that I shared their grief.  The heroic duet, with Carreras and Cappuccilli, was
powerful, with a recurring theme.  Agnes Baltsa. as the embittered Princess
Eboli, gave what must be her finest dramatic performance.  Inspired acting and singing by Ferrucio Furlanetto, as King Philip II, and Matti Salminen, as The Grand Inquisitor, gave superb reality to their roles.
I thank heavens that I discovered how to adapt my Region 2 DVD player to be able to play this Region 1 DVD.  I cannot understand how there can be any justification for the EU to prohibit retailers from identifying which DVD players are multi-
region, or indeed, in 2011, with so much easily-available products worldwide, why such regional separation exists.  Restrictive practices such as this should be
banned.
This ""Don Carlo"" DVD is my all-time favourite and I heartily recommend it to all opera lovers, especially enthusiastic ""Verdians"" like myself.  It is excellent value.",1293840000,4,1836,5.381118881118881
