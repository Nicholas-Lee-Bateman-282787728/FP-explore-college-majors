8723647,4,B01169B32W,"This was a very enjoyable performance.  The language was clear.  The subtitles worked well.  The video images on the blu ray version were very clear, detailed, with good color saturation.  We found the DTS master audio mix to be substandard at least with the settings on our sound system.  In particular the orchestra was much too loud and often drowned out the speakers or singers.  In addition, with regular speech there was a hollow echo that the live audience wouldn't have noticed but one I found bothersome.  The stereo mix was fine and I would suggest starting with that PCM mix.  Again, this could have been my sound system settings but the settings were the same ones I have used for many DTS blu ray disks without a problem.  Finally -- a good comment - the people who authored the blu ray disk activated the ""resume play"" feature with allows the disk to book mark and resume play instead of from the beginning.  The DTS audio issue was why I gave this four instead of five stars",1469318400,,989,4.536723163841808
8723648,5,B01169B32W,"Simply exquisite. In acting, concept, setting. A must for Shakespeare appreciators, this his most complex verbal creation. Oh yes. Easily the equal of the beautiful BBC version. RSC takes a few liberties, substitution in a few cases of truly obscure  words for more modern versions and a significant alternation in the Nine Worthies scenario ( no hooting lords,  no Jude-Ass),with an imposed if masterful shaping of the 1914 trope. Having seen, as a theater professional, hundreds of Shakespeare plays, this is perhaps the finest realization of a comedy I have ever seen. All praise. Thank you.",1454803200,5,594,5.177083333333333
8723649,4,B01169B32W,"Loves Labours Lost by the Royal Shakespeare Company and directed by Christopher Luscombe is a very well done production. If evaluated as pure entertainment  it definitively would deserve five stars. The acting is excellent; the stage design is delightful, the costumes are impeccable. The fact that this DVD presents a recording of a live performance from Stratford-upon-Avon - is an extra bonus. However, when evaluating its effectiveness in projecting Shakespeares message  it is another story. Every Shakespeares play has an ambiguous character whose actions drive the entire plot. Therefore, it is always a great challenge for theatre and movie directors do not remove this ambiguity. Because it is this ambiguity that may lead the audience to perceiving the plays meaning. Costard is such an ambiguous character in Loves Labours Lost. One needs to understand him very well in order to grasp the meaning of the play. Costard is the royal jester. He is the wittiest character of the play. Shakespeare underlines this by making him deliver the longest word spoken in all of his plays, i.e., honorificabilitudinitatibus. Definitively, Costard is not an illiterate idiot. Yet he mixes up the letters given to him by Don Armado and Berowne and delivers them to the wrong persons. The play indicates that the name of Jaquenetta was written on the envelope containing the letter addressed to her. But Costard delivers this letter to the Princess. This would mean that Costard intentionally mixes-up the letters. Why would he do it? And what would be the purpose of doing this? It is this ambiguity that points towards the inner meaning of the play. The audience is supposed to be exposed to this ambiguity and to ponder upon it. Only then the spectators may be able to perceive Shakespeares message. By presenting Costard as an illiterate gardener, the RSCs performance robbed the audience from this experience.",1451433600,3,1908,5.151612903225806
