You will love this movie if you like to reminisce over the 1980s' get-rick-quick generation (aka ""yuppie"" generation).  The character Zane (Craig Sheffer) represents the last of the WASP artists and producers that were in existence before they were all usurped from the industry.",1477526400,,366,5.186440677966102

Zane Smith (Craig Sheffer) has a laughingly pathetic life. He is the creator/producer of a hit, family t.v. show called ""Rock 'n' Roll P.I."" (get into that later). His life seems to be going in a downhill direction; his fiance leaves him for another woman; he owes the IRS 5 years worth of taxes, plus interest. His shrink, Dr. Berlin (played by Orson Bean), does him more harm than good.
Penelope (Chelsea Noble) is the object of Zane's obsessions. He meets her, and instantly becomes infatuated with on the set of Rock 'n' Roll P.I., where she is playing ""Girl #3"".
Then, there's Reno (David Cassidy). Reno is the star of ""Rock 'n' Roll P.I."" Ok...Rock 'n' Roll P.I. can best be described as a mix between ""The Partridge Family"", ""David Cassidy:Man Undercover"", ""21 Jump Street"". Reno, very well portrayed by former 1970's icon David Cassidy, is like Keith Partridge with a serious attitude problem. He's a temperamental, spoiled brat, that likes to get down and party...party in ways Mother Partridge would frown at.
Well, Zane's problem is his negative attitude. He dwells to much on how lonely he is, as well as obsesses to much on Penelope. His problem too, is how is he going to come up with 5 years of taxes owed, to pay his debt to the IRS??
Things look really bad for Zane...
Zane and Penelope's relationship moves in a possitive direction.
But, wait!!
The IRS comes down pretty hard on Zane. He owes quite a bit of money. Zane decides he can afford it, no problem, since Rock'n'Roll P.I. is a highly rated family show, even when it goes into reruns, so money shouldn't be a problem...
Well...life takes a serious turn. Fate? Karma? Well, Reno is arrested for possesion of cocaine, and charged with intent to distribute (WHOA!! The star of a family show, that has positive moral values, arrested for drugs!!!) The network pulls the plug on Rock'n'Roll P.I., and Zane loses everything...
...except love. Zane in the end, comes to his senses and realizes the most important things in his life are Penelope and his dog Wolfgang.
Hard to get into at first, but, it had a good story. David Cassidy as Reno was not the main, or central character of the story, but his was a strong pressence. Craig Sheffer as Zane almost reminded me of Kevon Bacon in his performance; Zane was a little stiff, kinda mannequin-like, whether he was meant to be portrayed that way, I am not sure, but Sheffer portrayed him very well, making him a likeable guy...he just needs to losen up.
If you are in the mood for a cute romantic comedy, you'll enjoy this.",1029369600,3,2640,4.631130063965885
7856612,1,6303954081,I only bought this movie because David Cassidy was in it (he gets the star).  He was the only good thing in it.  He was a parody of his 2 former TV personalities.  He played such a jerk and I found myself laughing at his outrageous behavior.  His believability as such an arrogant jerk tells you what a great actor he is!!!!!!,985737600,,326,4.209677419354839
7856613,1,6303954081,"Craig, I am probably one of the biggest fans you have.  I liked you in the movie, but the movie had a bad plot.  I hope to see you in more films.  I would like to meet you in person one of these days.",955238400,,200,3.5
