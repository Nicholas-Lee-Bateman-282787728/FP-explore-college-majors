8229190,4,B000XPZTBC,"OK, maybe the narration is not polished and the color could have been better, but you really got the flavor of Russia on the rivers. This is much different than what we are usually shown.  And I learned that Peterhof is a 45-minute ride across the Gulf of Finland from St. Petersburg via high-speed boat!  Gives you an appreciation of the distance!  Reminded me of the river strip I took in Holland.  Very Interesting.  May have been a little dated, but there is not enough on Russia out there.",1306281600,,494,4.50561797752809
