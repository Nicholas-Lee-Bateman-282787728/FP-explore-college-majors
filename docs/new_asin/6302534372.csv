480793,4,6302534372,"Yes, Babe Ruth was a baseball legend.
Yes, Babe Ruth was like an overgrown kid in a candy store, trying to gobble up as much of the good life as possible before it overtook him.
That is how it is portrayed in ""The Babe,"" showing the ups and downs in the life of the Bambino.
John Goodman was excellent in this role. He played all aspects with gusto and showed what a talented actor he really is. Look at these facets.
1. He leaves St. Mary's, shy, scared and not knowing what was waiting for him.
2. His childish antics as he discovers things around him, such as the elevator in the hotel, chewing gum, good food, beautiful women and plenty of booze.
3. His absolute love for the game, although he took no measures to keep himself in shape to play.
4. His rollercoaster of emotions as his career and his personal life took ups and downs, from signing the biggest deal in baseball and creating ""The House that Ruth Built,"" to physical confrontations with the fans who jeered him.
5. His devotion to children, especially those who were orphaned such as he was. He took them for rides in his car, he brought shoes to them in the orphanage.
6. The painful realization that his career was over as he walked off the field for the last time with his head down, to the standing ovation of the home crowd.
This is a vast expanse of characterizations, and Goodman covered them all. True, he did have to lose weight to play the Babe. He dropped down to 275 pounds. That's only 15 pounds more than Babe usually weighed when he reported to spring training after an offseason of indulging in food, booze and women. He would play his way down to 240 pounds by the end of the season, but he was still 20 pounds overweight. Just think how many home runs he would have hit if he had the work ethic of a Lou Gehrig, a Nolan Ryan, a Mike Schmidt or a Roger Clemens.
Sure, Goodman had a washerwoman swing at times during the movie. But, keep in mind that he is ""right"" handed and is performing with his left. I am very right handed, and when I try to throw with my left hand, I look deformed.
To those who glorify Babe Ruth, this movie may be a shocker, but it told the truth. He loved the game, and he loved to live the wild life. Ultimately, it shortened his career by a few years.
Goodman is great as the Bambino! Not only can he do comedy (he is totally hilarious in Rozanne), but he can do good dramatical roles if given the right piece, such as in this movie. Heck, with the nose job and his round face, he could pass for the Bambino's son!",978566400,10,2525,4.251559251559252
480794,4,6302534372,"I think this was a good solid movie.  Babe Ruth was a legend, no doubt, but all that glitters is not gold, and his life was no exception.  I think that by watching this movie you can see why the Sultan of Swat was the way he was, as far as his temper, his low self-esteem at first, his overgrown sense of his own self-worth toward the end of his career.  I thought John Goodman played a fine Ruth and while he did appear excessively heavy and slow for the part, Ruth was not a slim, overally muscled athlete in the 1910's.  Perhaps, the ""dirty"" scenes another reviewer commented upon were the scenes dealing with Ruth's flatulence!  Overall, it was a good movie, my kids were able to watch it and enjoyed it and I think Goodman did a great role as The Great Bambino.  This movie tells it straight, doesn't over glorify him just because he was who he was; afterall, he like the rest of us, was human.",973036800,5,899,4.258823529411765
480795,1,6302534372,"As a feature film, this is overly long, dreary and surprisingly depressing, considering the subject (the glory of Babe Ruth and his towering baseball career.) And John Goodman as the Bambino?As one reviewer  noted, Goodman's one of the few actors who would have to LOSE weight to  play Babe Ruth. Truthfully, Goodman is so grossly out of shape there is no  way that he can convincingly pass for an athlete! He swings the bat more  like Babe Ruth's sister.  If you're interested in the Babe's life story,  check out the A&E Biography video, or Ken Burns' Baseball documentary.",949190400,9,575,4.816326530612245

480887,3,6302534372,Baseball players come and go.  But they will still be talking about The Babe for as long as there is baseball.  Growing up in an orphanage to a baseball career.  He played in an era where he hit more home  runs a season then most teams.  And if he hadn't been such a power hitter would have probably been a Hall Of Fame pitcher.

480895,5,6302534372,"This movie was an excellent baseball movie.  My son is a 12 year old baseball athlete and is now highly interested in baseball movies.  We chose this one since it was ""PG"" and he already read many books on Babe Ruth.  I won't give away any details of the movie since a review is not supposed to do that.  Instead I will list what we liked and what we disliked:
Likes: 1) Pretty accurate storyline compared to biographies about Ruth 2) Goes through his whole life, not just his baseball life 3) Mix of serious drama and humor to keep the film from being too dramatic 4) Easy for younger children 10+ to follow  5) Good balance of showing Babe as a hero, jerk, and sympathetic character.  6)  There are no inappropriate scenes and the language is pretty tame, however, there may be a couple words that parents may object to but honestly it is modestly tame for other PG movies
Dislikes: 1) Film gets a little long.  A few scenes could have been cut to shorten the movie by 15-20 minutes  2) The end of his life is rushed a bit since the final scene still shows him playing baseball.  Even 5-8 extra minutes about his final demise would have been a better conclusion than just words after the movie.
It is worth the $3 to rent.  I'm not sure I would spend the money to own it because it's not one of those movies you will watch over and over.",1462320000,,1339,4.273809523809524

480969,2,6302534372,"The Babe is a careless, clichd, colorless, cornball version of the colorful slugger who George Will described as an Everest in Kansas. One of the big problems is the inaccuracy of this version of the story. One glaring example is the films handling of the Johnny Sylvester story. In the film, Babe visits Johnny, who is near death, in the hospital and promises to hit two home runs for him. When the Babe hits a second home run (in the ninth inning) weak, little Johnny is instantly healed. In reality, the Babe never visited Johnny in the hospital. A friend of Johnnys father gave Johnny two baseballs, autographed by several Yankees, including Ruth. In the 1926 World Series, which happened at about the same time, Ruth hit 4 home runs, which lifted Johnnys spirits. The following spring, Johnnys uncle met Ruth and thanked him for cheering Johnny up with his home runs. After the two chatted, Ruth asked a nearby sportswriter who Johnny Sylvester was. In the movie, Ruth hits 3 home runs in his last game, and then trudges down the dugout runway alone, until a grown Johnny Sylvester catches up with him and tells him, Youre the best thats ever been. In real life, Ruth did hit three home runs against Pittsburgh, but not in his last game, and not in front of Johnny Sylvester. Another irritating example of this inattention to detail is John Goodmans swing. If you want to see an actor who really looks like a hitter, look at Robert Redfords swing in The Natural. Its hard to see how this films Babe Ruth ever hit any homers with that awkward-looking swing. Partly because of the inaccuracy, the films Babe Ruth lacks depth and color. The real Bambino was a more complicated person who could play ball magnificently. This Bambino mainly plays cornball. My favorite scene was the opening aerial shot of Yankee Stadium.",1447718400,,1821,4.7115987460815045

480986,2,6302534372,"As a life long Yankees fan, I have read a lot about, and admired Babe Ruth, since I was very young, but I never saw the film based on his life. I heard nothing but bad things about it, and as it turns out, my fellow critics were correct. The Babe is supposed to be a bio-pic from the birth of Babe Ruth, until his untimely death, however the focus of the film is a problem. Film makers portrayed Ruth as an ignorant man-child, a drunk, and an emotionally abuse husband and father. At times, he may have been all of those things, but they were merely a small part of his overall story. Little, if anything is mentioned about Ruth's infections personality, his generosity, or his activities off the field, besides his drinking. Ruth is portrayed as a man who gained fame, simply because of his ability to hit home runs, in a way that insinuates, he was lucky and didn't deserve all the fame and attention he received. The portrayal of the Babe isn't the only problem with this film, as the timeline and historic accuracy aren't even close to the truth. They show Ruth more with the Red Sox than the Yankees, insist that the majority of his fame came in Boston, and finally, they show his big seasons much later than they actually occured, and even go as far as to insulate, that they were in response to the media saying he was done. John Goodman stars as the Babe and he does a spot on portrayal, from the voice to the mannerisms, he was very very good, but it's overlooked by a film that stretched the truth to the point of being insulting to Ruth fans. The only thing I really enjoyed about this film, besides Goodman's performance, was a series of short films Ruth did with some orphans in the 1920's, that were included on the DVD. These shorts were much better and painted a much more accurate picture of the man, than this film ever did. The Babe is worth seeing for the performance of John Goodman, but be warned, it's a bio-pic that is more fiction than truth.",1438992000,,1967,4.377049180327869

480988,5,6302534372,"Director Arthur Hiller's THE BABE (1992) has a music score by Elmer Bernstein. It's an episodic bio of baseball legend Babe Ruth that stars John Goodman as George Herman ""Babe"" Ruth, Trini Alvarado as his long-suffering wife, Helen and Kelly McGillis as the 2nd Mrs. Ruth, Claire.

(In an interview during this picture's production, Goodman noted the irony of having to lose weight to play the Sultan of Swat.)

Although not the greatest sports movie, this one's adherence to historical detail relevant to costuming, also the look of 1902-'35 America, are outstanding. Babe Ruth is presented as a likable child-man who was very flawed. Despite inaccuracies for the sake of dramatic effect, there's more than a ring of truth in Goodman's fine portrayal, and at times he really resembles the Bambino.

Definitely recommended for all baseball fans (even Yankee haters!) or anyone who appreciates costume dramas.",1437523200,,908,5.205479452054795

481023,3,6302534372,"Not nearly as bad as people make it out to be but still not nearly as great as it could have been. While I commend the performance of John Goodman and the rest of the cast in general, the films low budget is very noticeable and the amount of changes that they make to Ruth's story is a huge number.

95% of the story only shows the negative side of Ruth's story and the positive stuff is mainly about the Myth's we've heard from Ruth's biography instead of the facts.

The low budget shows in the movies rather short running time for a Biopic and the amount of Baseball stadiums they could utilize. Only a couple of stadiums were used and were dressed differently to try and hide this fact. This would have probably worked if they were dressed better but you can tell right away that it's the same stadium each time.

So overall, if it were a fiction film, this would have worked wonderfully but it's not. It's about a real man, a true legend in the history of sports, Babe Ruth. With a low budget and too many historical inaccuracies, The Babe is a film that just doesn't work as a Biopic.

The Babe is a true to life biographical sketch of one of the greatest baseball players of all times. John Goodman who plays the Babe along with Kelly McGilles, co-star, does an excellent job in this movie thus giving us the true character of the kid from a Baltimore orphanage to his rise to baseball stardom.

481222,3,6302534372,"Babe Ruth is arguably the most well known baseball player in history. He was most certainly one of the greater players to play the game.  The stories and legends surrounding both is playing and his personal life could fill volumes; and indeed do.  It has gotten now to the point that it is difficult to separate truth from fiction.  All that being said though, even after you discount the myth portion of his life, Babe Ruth was still and all a fascinating man and baseball player.

Now the movie being reviewed here cannot in any shape or form be classified as a historical documentary.  If a person wants that sort of thing, then it is best to find one of the many, many fine biographies written about Ruth.  No, for the most part this film is an extremely fictionalized version of Ruth's life and Ruth's game.  The errors in this film are beyond counting.  The portrayal of Ruth's life; while based on loose interpretations of fact, are quite off the mark in most cases.

But all that being said I cannot actually trash the film.  I personally viewed this work as a simple baseball story about a historical character in which Hollywood did its usual job on.  I actually enjoyed watching this film as I felt the acting was most certainly up to par as acting in this type of movie goes and I liked the fact that the film makers most certainly captured the feel and essence of the times.  Sports in general, and baseball in particular, were a national obsession and followed closely by most of the nation.  This was before T.V. and (gasp) before football became our National Sport.  Times were quite different then; some for the good, some for the bad.  This film, if you watch closely, portrays the way it was quite well.

John Goodman, despite being very much overweight for the part, actually did a pretty good job of catching the character of Ruth, in particular during the last part of the film.  The two ladies that played his two wives were excellent in their part and probably turned in more accurate performances of the people they portrayed than anyone else in the film.

This film must be viewed as a simple ""baseball"" film and is not a historical documentary. Fans of baseball; those to know and love the game and its history will more than likely grind their teeth when watching much of this film but again, it must be remembered that this is not a documentary, rather it is a baseball film loosely based upon real characters.

Now my personal objections to this film boil down to two things.  First is that a great film could be made of Ruth's life without twisting the truth all that much.  His real life was actually more interesting than anything Hollywood could come up with in their fantasy world.  My second concern is that many young folk may watch this film and come away feeling they know the ""true"" Babe Ruth story. The film makers here had a great opportunity to make a great film about a great baseball player but to be frank...the blew it.  On the other hand, viewed as a work of pretty much fiction, it was kind of fun to watch.

Note:  I did not watch this on blue-ray, or any other recording device.  I watched this one on very late night T.V.  It was a good movie for those who like to prowl the late night movie channels.

481223,4,6302534372,"The casting of John Goodman was a masterstroke for this film. He provides great energy and the cuddly presence of Babe Ruth naturally.

Ruth's generosity is well conveyed in this film. Whether it was a child ill in hospital or a teammate he was selfless when it came to giving.

So many baseball records were set by Ruth, and for those fans that were lucky enough to see him play often witnessed history in the making.

This film portrays Ruth as a baseball phenomenon and an at times decadent fun loving person, who liked to give.

481224,4,6302534372,"I remember liking this film a lot more when I was a kid.  Of course now that I am older, I realize that it doesn't do George Herman Ruth justice, as a person, or a ball player, making him into an oaf and a clod, a big shambling mess on the ball field.  The movie script over simplifies important scenes, makes a big deal out of others that don't seem as though they should be, and glosses over important events entirely.  It's still enjoyable, but take it with a grain of salt.  More interestingly, watch the two wonderful short films on the special features that the real Babe Ruth made, and compare them to the trainwreck John Goodman portrays.  In one Babe goes to an orphanage and teaches a kid how to play baseball, in the other, he steps off a train to play stick ball in a field with some kids.  The personality of the real Babe Ruth was what made the man interesting.  There are only a few scenes halfway through the film where John Goodman came close to capturing that personality.  They should have concentrated on getting their facts straight when they made the movie, rather than trying to get a reaction from the audience.  My biggest complaint was that they totally missed the relationship with Gehrig and Ruth. My favorite aspect of the movie was the nostalgia of a time period long gone, that they just don't make very many movies about. Maybe one day, Babe Ruth will get the movie he deserves.

But now that I have gotten older, and have seen numerous pictures and newsreels on Ruth, this film misses the mark in terms of its potrayal of a fat overgrown kid. Ruth was a consumate athelete as one reviewer pointed out. Not only could hit well he could also pitch well. he was all muscle though with the exception of the 1922 season. It was the 1922 season which was his worst, not 1925. It was 1923 when Yankee stadium opened that Ruth led them to the World Series, which would have been great for the movie to depict. He was also well aware of his flaws. But was not oblivious to his fans. This is one good thing about the film, Goodman does do well in portraying him as someone who adored his fans. I think a film about the real Babe Ruth would be more appropiate in the sense of chronicling a fascinating story about his career as a player as opposed to little snipits of games. This movie to me was way too short. It should be one of those epic 3-hour type movies. Ruth completely changed the game. Which we only get a glimpse of in the hotel scene with Jumping Joe with the line ""Homeruns are a rare commodity, keep them on the ground where they aint"". This was important point about Ruth coming of age in the Deadball era, had the film embelished on it just a little bit more it would have been better.

Alot of people say that the story is innacurate, and to that I say ""AW Banana oil!"" This movie is the tops. There's only one other movie about the Babe, and that one had him stepping into a dark dingy bar and ordering a milk! Babe Ruth didn't drink no milk. John Goodmans portrayal, if not completely accurate, is at least a lot of fun, and from what I know (I never met the guy in person-did you?) is pretty spot on.
The Babe partied every night of the week, and usually strolled into the game sometime around the second inning to sock one out of the park. He'd smoke a few cigars in the dugout, and usually had a mug of beer waiting for him at home plate. Nobody told The Babe what to do, because he owned. The guy pretty much paid everybodys salary in the day, and is still pretty much the reason why those jerk off Yankees still have so much dough.
He was an animal on and off the field. Just ask the dames that hung all over him. He had two smoking wives.. one a small town waitress, and the other a sexy Zigfield follie (aint that the dream?)
Yeah he had to overcome some serious struggles in life, but don't we all? The guy exuberated a good time, for the folks, and especially the kids, for whom he had the biggest heart in the world... And he told fart jokes at fancy dinners!

Goodman seems to have been given the license to ""go for broke"" with a ""larger than life"" approach, that leaves little for the viewer to consider of Ruth's actual life.  With the broadest of strokes, Goodman  plays Ruth self-consciously; the mis-en-scenes are without any surprises and Hollywood-predictable.

Too little was shown to give us the sense of Ruth-as-athlete and the milieu of early 20th century baseball, a fascinating story that awaited telling but missed the opportunity here.",1147219200,3,569,5.031914893617022
481309,3,6302534372,"Probably the most famous baseball player of all-time, Babe Ruth should definitely have had a movie done about him, and ""The Babe"" is a decent effort, but is not without flaws.  First, there are many inaccuracies in this movie, but I won't go into that too deep.  At the end of the movie (1936), The Babe is spitting up blood during the game between the Braves and the Pirates, but Ruth did not pass away from cancer until 1948.  Certainly Ruth did not have cancer in 1936..  There's many other things, but I don't need to list them all.

But the thing that really bothered me about this movie is that Ruth is portrayed as nothing more than a bumbling idiot while he was with the Red Sox.  While this is good for a few laughs, it really took away from my enjoyment of the first half of the movie.  I'm thinking ""THIS guy is Babe Ruth??""  However, as soon as Ruth is sold to the Yankees, he becomes much more intelligent and doesn't act like a complete dumba$$ all of the time.  At this point, the movie takes a much more serious turn, and in my opinion, the last half of the movie is EXCELLENT.  The film delves into the Babe's issues both on and off the field, and definitely has some touching moments, and a strong finish to the movie.  Too bad the first half of the movie was so silly..  So overall, 1 star for the first half of the movie, 5 stars for the second half, for a final score of 3 stars.

I thought that John Goodman was very good as The Babe, although yes, he was much larger (weight) than Babe Ruth really was at any point in his life, but let's not get hung up on details.  Goodman was a good fit for the part, and Kelly McGillis was excellent in the supporting role of Claire Hudson.

All of that said, if you're a true baseball historian, you will find plenty to complain about with ""The Babe"", but if you just want a fun baseball movie to watch, then I would definitely recommend it.  I would hope that someday a movie is made about Babe Ruth that is more historically accurate, and has a much more grand feel like the movie 61*, because this telling of Babe Ruth's life just isn't quite the home run that it should have been.",1142812800,13,2145,4.233415233415234

As was noted elsewhere by other reviewers, Goodman's Ruth does not represent a great athlete. Ruth was not overweight growing up, nor in his early days as a ballplayer. Ruth's weight did fluctuate, but few to this day know that Ruth had 123 career stolen bases, and actually led the Yankees in steals one year (1923). Goodman's character was unreasonably slow, and at the end was portrayed as unable to run the bases even on a home run. This might work as light humor, but it certainly is not fact. Also of note, Goodman was a natural born right-hander that had to learn how to bat and throw left-handed like Ruth for the purpose of acting in this film. This makes Goodman look awkward, and even less like an athlete on a few occasions.

On the other hand, I understand as a general rule that playwrights and filmmakers are given a certain ""artistic license,"" and that it is alright on some occasions to stretch the truth for a purpose. The bloated portrayal of Ruth might be one such example, no matter how erroneous it is from a factual standpoint. Even so, many of the inaccuracies have no discernable purpose. Case in point,  ""Jumpin' Joe"" Dugan was never a teammate of Ruth's in Boston, only in New York. It is also known that Ruth did not have any home runs in 1914, but according to this movie he had one that year. In addition, Ruth was not the first player to hit a home run at Forbes Field. The list could go on for a while, and there seems to be no reason why the filmmakers decided to alter such facts. ""Jumpin' Joe"" may have been put in there just to have a veteran teammate friend for Ruth, but Dugan started his career three years after Ruth did, so he could not have been a veteran to Ruth at any point in his career. They could have picked someone else to fill this fictitious ""veteran teammate"" role, or scrapped the idea all together. The 1914 home run served the purpose of providing a dramatic rookie year home run, but this scene could have been set in 1915 instead, and with some modifications perhaps could have been just as dramatic. Lastly, regarding Forbes Field, the announcer could have said a true statement along the lines of ""Forbes Field is a pitchers ballpark, not many home runs are hit here folks,"" as opposed to the inaccurate ""no one has ever hit a ball out of Forbes Field."" The latter line had a dramatic effect, but was not necessary.

Also of note, Ruth's supposed ""meeting"" with gangster Alphonse Capone seemed a bit absurd, perhaps this was thrown in to get a glimpse of the times. Aside from the dicey misrepresentations though, there were a few strong qualities. The acting was strong overall, with Ruth's two wives giving strong performances, and Goodman's performance was not a total wash, even if there was too much over-the-top buffoonery. And let it be said that this film does have the ability to evoke some of the excitement of the game of baseball - a sentiment especially felt as an eight or nine year old viewer. But as said by Derek Armstrong, there were ""too few ambitions toward a greatness to match that of its subject matter.""",1123459200,21,3356,4.523887973640857
481312,1,6302534372,"Normally I don't review content on DVDs just execution ....this product suffers on both counts.  The true story of BABE RUTH is a legendary one...and this movie pays little attention to much of it.  With all the amazing athletic feats to deal with this movie mostly takes the personal route and gets pretty redundant with it...how many belches do we need to hear or meals do we need to see consumed at record pace?

Goodman could have played Ruth...but he'd have needed to drop some weight...lots of it.  Ruth was a great athlete and while his weight fluctuated he was never the blob that Goodman is.  I remember seeing this movie when it first played in theatres and until I actually saw real footage of Ruth and learned the true story years later did I realize what a travesty this ""movie of the week"" type project is....

BEST THING ABOUT THIS DVD?  the two bonus featurettes starring the real BABE RUTH as bonus features...they alone are worth the ten bucks",1115683200,10,961,4.617647058823529

481314,5,6302534372,"I enjoyed this movie. Some of the reviewers don't understand this was not a documentary on the Bambino. This was a movie. The fine gentlemen P. B. Pereira attempt to dismiss John Goodman as a somewhat successful star from the late 80's is idiotic and off the mark. You sir are taking the whole movie too seriously. Babe's rough and tumble upbringing left its mark on him. Goodman is terrific throughout the movie,& I really fell for the lovely Trini Alvarado who plays Babe's first wife, she is stunning. As far as the would have, could ofs and other wild speculation on how good Babe would have been, think about this. Babe didn't use illegal steroids like today's ball players, he rode a train not a jet, fitness equipment did not exist. In addition the old ball parks tended to have greater distances from the plate to the fence. I highly recommend this movie, if for just the ""pull my finger"" line.",1097366400,3,902,4.574074074074074
481315,1,6302534372,"I can't help but wonder if this film wasn't made more from an excuse to cash in on the popularity of John Goodman at the time of this film than an honest desire to portray the baseball icon.  It would certainly explain the film's inaccuracies and rushed feel.  I remember that around that time (late 80's, early 90s), Goodman seemed to be fairly popular.  Can it be coincidence that somebody wanted to make a film about Babe Ruth at around the same time Goodman started receiving recognition in Hollywood?  Honestly, I don't think so.  At any rate, Goodman is miscast as Ruth.  For one thing, Ruth wasn't really fat; more like broad and stocky.  He was quite athletic and able to play the field -  remember, there was no such thing as a designated hitter back then.  In other words, offense isn't the only part of baseball; Ruth played defense too.  Does this film ever show Ruth in the outfield?  Can't say for sure because I didn't really watch the entire thing, but it's hard to imagine paunchy John Goodman fielding fly balls.  The other thing is Goodman is simply unlikeable as Ruth.  As we can see from film footage (including Pride of the Yankees), the real Ruth was energetic and charismatic.  Goodman's Ruth is simply loud, crass and grating.",1093219200,19,1251,4.627272727272727

If you love Babe Ruth and baseball, or at least have an appreciation for ""the man"" and his impact on this classic sport, then you will enjoy this film. I admit it's a little on the silly side, kinda portraying Ruth as a clownish figure at times; but you have to remember he was a rollicking, fun-loving party animal after all in real life--a highly gifted boy who never really grew up, God bless him.
