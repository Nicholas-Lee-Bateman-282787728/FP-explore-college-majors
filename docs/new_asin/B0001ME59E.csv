1998 U.S. International Film & Video Festival.

Travel to five nations as Dale Chihuly directs an imaginative whirlwind that integrates artists, craftspeople, engineers, and spectators. Between 1995 and 1996, Chihuly traveled with his team of glassblowers to glass factories in Finland, Ireland, Mexico, and Italy, and worked in his own Boathouse studio in Seattle, Washington. This DVD documents the extraordinary development of this ambitious international project, Chihuly Over Venice. In September 1996, Chandeliers created in all five nations were installed at fourteen locations around Venice. Months of intensity reach an apex as the Chandeliers arrive in Venice and Chihuly directs their installation in such varied places as the Doge's apartment at the Palazzo Ducale, in the cloister of Sant'Apollonia, and in the Rialto Fish Market.
