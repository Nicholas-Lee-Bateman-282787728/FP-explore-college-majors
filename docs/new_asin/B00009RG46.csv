1889396,5,B00009RG46,"Great look, great lighting, great camera angles and better than average KF movie acting. Action scenes were fabulous to say the least and the plot was not very predictable with a few twist. Great fantasy period piece.",1050451200,,217,4.891891891891892
1889397,1,B00009RG46,"When the swedish prime-minister returned from a visit to China he blabbed about 'stability' and almost gave he chinese government a total understanding for the events on the square of heavenly peace (or whatever the square is called where courageous chinese citizens met their death when opposing the rule of the few over the many).
So does this film.
Spoilers ahead.
Hitler and Napoleon dreamt of the same thing as did the first ruler of China but unlike him they did not succeed in their folly.
It may be a sign of our present times that fascists go unnoticed. Now, for those who do not know what fascism is then let me illuminate You on the subject, so that You may better understand this film:
Fascism is an ideology which claims the right for a supposed elite amongst men to rule over the rest of mankind.
With tearful beauty this film defends this idea. Under the breathtaking grandiose scenery it presents, the most disgusting ideology mankind has ever dreamt up is buried.
We follow the 'hero' through his ordeals in order to assinate the evil one, only to see him in the end succomb to that same person for his megalomaniac plan equal to any Hitler or Napoleon. The 'noble' emperor exclaims that the reason for him attacking other kingdoms is only to unite the many so that there will be 'peace in the valley'. But what could be worse than peace under oppression? This question does not even occur in this abomination of a film, beautiful on the outside and grizzly in the inside.",1050364800,9,1489,4.622641509433962
1889398,5,B00009RG46,"This is one truely amazing film.
I have got it on DVD-9 from China, the quality and sound is unmatched 5.1, DTS, Superbit quality. ($15. US)
Jet Li how good is this guy, I have seen some of his other films but his performance in HERO is well worth watching.
Nominated for 16 Film awards in Hong Kong, picked up 14 of them.
On par with ""Crouching Tiger"" but 100% more action....
Great story line, touches both reality and the spiritual side of you.
See It, Buy it... Watch it over and over...",1050278400,,491,4.290322580645161
1889399,5,B00009RG46,"don't listen to those complainers above, they lack the ability to see and accept a movie for what it truly is.  this story does remind me of Crouching Tiger, but only because of the fight scenes, the entire meaning behind the film and the whole plot is completely separate.  I don't think you can really say one is better than the other, because they are way too different, but if i were to look solely at fighting, this movie far surpasses Crouching Tiger.  With less philosophical meaning, it lacks in it's ability to really get the audience drawn to the characters, but with such good artistically choriographed fight scenes who cares.  Also, Zhang Zi Yi is in the film, you truly cannot go wrong with that.",1050105600,,710,4.611111111111111
1889400,5,B00009RG46,"YES, I think it is *perfectly acceptable* to compare this movie to ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". I absolutely love both films, and I think this one is the better of the two!  The biggest reason people will compare the two films is because the martial art battles are shown in a very similar style. Yes, both are obviously done with lots of wire tricks.  (I don't understand why people complain about how unrealistic the fight scenes are in both movies?? This is a movie we're watching!! Stories - whether fact or fiction - can be exaggerated. If you were untrained in combat, lived back then, and saw a master Swordsman or Martial Artist, they would probably appear to have ""gods-like"" skills.)
Both movies are absolute works of arts - they are artistic stories, that have deep philosophical meanings.
Why do I think this movie is better then CTHD? The story is stronger (although I will admit CTHD has a very nice flow of pacing!) In Hero, the story gets more and more interesting as it unfolds.
The visuals are *very* well done -- the fight scene in the rain near the beginning has a very ""clean"" look that you will want to show off time and again to friends on a big screen!  The use of color to convey more meaning then what the dialog and action can by themselves, is a brilliant call.  Movie buffs will recognize that other great movies such as ""The Matrix ""(muted greens while in the matrix), and ""Brother Where Art Thou"" (pseudo black & white, with a dusty look) also employed this trick.  The colors are rich and vibrant in Hero.
The music is excellent, and dovetails with the movie quite nicely.
If you liked Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, or Iron Monkey, you will probably love this film.",1049846400,7,1704,4.592105263157895
1889401,1,B00009RG46,"With a cast like that, I expected a decent film...I could never get into it, though.  I felt like I was having ""art"" shoved down my throat...each flashback has a color scheme, like red, green, etc.  It gives the movie a great visual appearance, but ultimately distracts and removes the viewer from the experience...it reminds the viewer he/she is watching a movie, rather than relating to the movie directly.  I've never had that sensation in a Hong Kong or mainland movie, even those for which I had no subtitles and had only the images to tell me the story.  Plus, I can see the same person die only a couple times before I get fed up and say, ""just kill the guy, already, and get on with it!""
Odd thing...almost all of the people I've talked to in mainland China hated ""Crouching Tiger"", but loved this movie.",1049760000,9,812,4.503401360544218
1889402,5,B00009RG46,"Zhang Yimou's films are like the ""perfect woman"". They're beautiful to look at and intelligent.
 I've been reading that people have been comparing this film to Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". People who compare this film to Lee's film, are not very educated in foreign films. And I don't say this to sound like a snob. ""Hero"" is similar to Chen Kaige's ""The Emperor & the Assassin"". The story-line follows the same time in history. And to be honest both film are masterpieces. But, I admit as I watched this film in it's opening moments I thought to myself that ""Hero"" seems to lack something ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""The Emperor & the Assassin"" had. This film doesn't seem as majestic as either. Also the fight scenes don't seem as amazing as those in Lee's film. But, Zhang Yimou's film possess other qualities that make this film just as impressive. Yimou's film's are always heartfelt and emotional. There is such passion in his films. ""Hero"" is such an impressive movie. It's just as touching as Yimou's other masterpieces like ""Raise the Red Lantern"", ""To Live"" & ""The Road Home"".
 The story revolves around a warrior named ""nameless"" (played by Jet Li). He has managed to kill three of the King's most feared assassins. And now has been rewarded by meeting the king. King, intrigued to discover how one man could have achieved such a feat, ask him to tell him the story of how he accomplished this. ""Nameless"" tells his story of how he was able to deceit the three of them. But, soon something unexpected happens in this movie, and this is when the movie had me hooked. And soon we are asked to question ourselves as to what is true. And soon we are thinking of another classic foreign film. Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"".
 ""Hero"" has so many hearfelt moments in it that we gladly give our emotions to the characters. The movie's ultimate message, without spoiling the film for you, is about peace. Here once again Zhang Yimou has made a bold, beautiful, tender film that all should be able to enjoy. I haven't seen many movies so far this year, but, I doubt I'll be able to see a better film than this one.
 Bottom-line: Might not have the gradeur of films like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""The Emperor & the Assassin"", but, it makes up for it with it's emotional impact and Yimou's strong directing. So far, the year's best film!",1048550400,8,2364,4.661870503597123
1889403,4,B00009RG46,"It's not fair to compare this movie to ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" directed by Ang Lee.  These two movies are so far apart from one another, akin to chalk and cheese.  Where ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a no-nonsense straight-up story telling, ""Hero"" is more like a ""Pulp Fiction"" type of story telling.  The same story is told from different perspectives and then, we shall decide for ourselves what actually happened and what outcome would we expect from those happenings.  Many of my Chinese peers were utterly disappointed with ""Hero"" because it's arguably one of the most expensive Chinese movie ever made & yet, the final touch didn't quite live up to their expectation.  Naturally, it's a star-studded movie with appearances by Jet Li, Maggie Cheung, Tony Leung, Zhang Jiyi.  Due to Director's involvement in theatre productions in China, I would like to believe that he applied the visual touches of theatres into this cinema spectacle that I could only describe as spectacular.  This time around, the martial arts is emphasised with special effects, & in order to prevent viewers from been confused with narrations by Jet Li, the cast were given the blue, red, & white treatments.  For example, from one person's point of view, it's rendered the ""blue"", but from another person's, it's actually ""red"", & the truth is to be revealed in ""white"".  It's quite imaginative to concoct a story about these few assasins who had attempted various times to rid of Emperor Chin, the Emperor who united China from various Kingdoms, the Emperor who gave us the Great Wall of China, & also the Emperor who in his later years would sent his followers around the world looking for elixir of life to give him the gift of immortality, and as the legend goes, those followers of his ended up settling in Japan & thus, the Japanese today.  In the end, the assassins were the ones who convinced him that he's on the right path and thus, the formation of modern China.  Talking about mixing fact with fiction.  Overall, this is definitely a beautiful movie, a movie that deserves to be enjoyed but one also has to accept that it's an ambitious movie that didn't quite pick up an Oscar this year.  Still, it's still a good movie to be had.  Well done.",1048550400,23,2249,4.777777777777778

1889405,3,B00009RG46,"Artsy to an extreme. Very pretty (well shot) but sometimes to the point of being a cologne/fragrance commercial, but there is plenty of pretty for the eye to take in. The story is thin but entertaining in a way you expect from ancient legends no matter the culture. Fight choreography is alright, but nothing innovative or heart pumping. The fights serve more as a dance than to express violence. Also... the version that says ""English Subtitles"" on Prime is actually dubbed with no options aside from English.

Stunningly beautiful, laced with the perfect music score; the slow pace of depth and contemplative silence, with words few and far between, yet so well placed that when the fluid dance of the art of sword flight is mesmerizing in its dynamic surrealism or the swelling music of events occurs, by contrast it makes the whole movie vibrant and deeply grounded in a realm extraordinarily rare in films. Scenery magnificent, costumes and sets shine as jewels in the storyline; culturally fascinating. Early on, would have said it didn't have a heart; there was a coldness throughout, which even the passion of their purpose, or the love and death-tears, couldn't melt. Yet in the end, it came together with such resolution and insight from that quiet contemplation, that mastery of the twin-craft itself as Master teacher. 'Use the thorn to remove the thorn, then both thorns can be thrown away'..., so to speak. Not an easy film for someone who has a hard time with violence; tho it was minimal, it was as poignant as that which the story was made of. A rich experience, and truly one of the most visually beautiful and deeply ambient, culturally engaging movies I've seen. Thanks for having it here.",1470528000,,1331,4.6923076923076925

The story is told in flash-back with lots slow fighting and flying scenes. The scenery, sets, and costumes are astounding, and the CGI plays important role not just in executing the stunts, but to deliver the poetic mood of the movie.
There is great focus on traditional values and heroics, but the movie also pushes you to look beyond the obvious story and consider wider impact of people's motivations.  The pace of the movie allows you to really process the depth of the story beyond fighting sequences.
I definitely recommend this movie.",1456185600,,792,4.859259259259259

I especially loved the scene of when she flies to the rooftop, closes the shutters, and protects the building from a gazillion arrows, shot via the king's army.

There is a story.  A man called Nameless/Jet Li claims he had defeated the king's greatest arrivals, which allows him to get physically closer and closer to the king.  And he describes his conquests in detail.

The king's rivals are lovers Broken Sword/Tony Leung and Flying Snow, and also Long Sky/Donnie Yen.  Zhang Ziyi has a small part as Moon, beholden to Broken Sword.

The colors are gorgeous, vibrant, yet appearing natural.  The fighting scenes are so eloquent.  The king is very clever and challenges Nameless repeatedly.

But after watching it more recently...there's something that really bothers me with the political ideology this film puts forth. To understand it, better take a quick look at the film's plot. There's something subversive and troubling here.

SPOILERS AHEAD

Our hero, Jet Li, is an assassin. He has gained the king's favor for killing a few other dissenting assassins, but really it's all a ploy to get close to the king himself...who is very paranoid over being murdered...can't imagine why...

This king, which the film likes to portray as ""honorable"" and ""wise"", adopts the cunning military strategy of simply bombarding unguarded civilian towns and cities with a rain of arrows. Nobody is spared.

Our honorable king is a genocidal dick...but ultimately our hero respects him for trying to unify China. Ultimately, our favorite assassin abandons his plan, deciding that perhaps to attain peace, it's okay to simple shoot arrows into a town until you're sure everyone is dead. After being exposed, he's executed by a tearful king...who goes on to further conquest, butchering hundreds of thousands to unify China.

This film likes to celebrate pacifism, as is the case for one of the warriors who serves as a side character, but at the same time continues to celebrate complete and absolute annihilation of the innocent as long as it leads to peace.

Now...if this were a film about Adolf Hitler in the vain of one of his attempted assassinations, do you think the assassin would put his guns away because he feels what Hitler did is good? Is it okay if it ultimately unifies Europe under the Nazi banner?

What about more recently? Is it responsible to simple shell the crap out of a city with artillery and napalm until people stop whining because they're all dead? Do you think the US government was encouraging pacifism in Vietnam while they were dropping agent orange on people?

If you answered no, thank god. If you answered yes, well...I look forward to your future war crimes tribunal.",1429920000,,2186,4.9346049046321525

1889550,1,B00009RG46,"Firstly, I must qualify that I'm not a trained professional at assessing remastering/transfer, but I do know it when there's something amiss with picture quality. My review is focused on picture quality. As for the movie itself, I have nothing but praise.

Picture Resolution
This movie is 2002 release, era before blu ray. Thus we had been watching it only on VCD and DVD, and it looked great. But on blu ray with big screen, I must say that that's not the case. I spotted at various scenes that the resolutions or bit rates were not uniform. For instance, the early part of the movie, the scene when Nameless arrived at palace court yard, the picture quality of the palace building's distant shot is of much lower resolution than the scenes before and after it. It also looked old. As well as at many other scenes, like the green lake where Broken Sword & Flying Snow practised calligraphy, was also of inferior quality. Great and dramatic scene where Broken Sword fought the king in palace court decorated with green drapes could've been more stunning had it not been for the poor quality of the video. Colors are dull, shallow, and not rich. Not to mention the mirror lake scene. Considering efforts put into filming these exotic places, this is a terrible waste.

Flesh Tone
At many scenes, the skin tone/brightness was not consistent. Though the story was told in several hues for different point of views. But I'm talking about the flesh tone within the same chapter's hue. Especially the blue scene where Nameless demonstrated his sword skill, skin tone was much affected, making the actors/actresses looked deathly bloodless or poorly colored. And in white scene, facial skin tone was sometimes all right but at times too bright and washed out, which was the scene when Flying Snow stabbed Broken Sword. I initially suspected poor post-production coloring, but big names like Zhang Yi Mou and Doyle are no amateurs. These could not have escaped their eyes.

Conclusion
When I finished watching, I must say that my watching experience and re-living the movie was way below what I expected. This is not watching a blu ray quality movie, this is a High Definition (at some scenes Standard Definition) movie being blown up to blu ray size, but not accompanied with blu ray quality. This movie is undoubtedly a praiseworthy work of art, but all these flaws really got in the way of admiring it. Then I was thinking are all these to be understood and excused due to being a transfer of a (not so) old movie, or has some unprofessional remastering / transfer been executed? So, potential buyers, manage your expectation.",1418428800,2,2622,4.8093126385809315

1889558,2,B00009RG46,"The movie starts with the main character, Nameless, meeting with the Emperor after having killed the three most deadly assassins in the known world (who were trying to kill the emperor): Flying Snow, Broken Sword, and Sky. The story is told as a series of flashbacks as Nameless and the Emperor converse over tea. However, in an entertaining twist (not too hard to figure out yourself), the first flashback is actually a total lie. The story is revealed by the retelling of these flashbacks, each telling getting closer to the truth until all is finally revealed at the end. I really liked this way of storytelling. It kept me interested and curious to find out what the truth really was and to see how the movie would end. I found myself trying to decipher the truth from the lies as the movie went on.

Despite the creative storytelling, the story being told was rather mediocre. A simple vengeance tale with no turns that I haven't seen before. I believe it was the way the story was told that helped make it interesting. The plot is so thin that it had to be retold multiple times in order to create a feature-length movie. In fact, the movie probably would've been server better if it had ditched it's method of storytelling and developed the plot that was there more.

The characters are one of the biggest faults I consistently have with this director's movies. They do things that make no sense. It feels like I'm watching a chick flick. During one of the fights, a drop of water is splashed on the corpse of a dead character. One of the combatants immediately runs to wipe off the single drop of water (which looked like a tear on her sad face). He does this despite the fact that the other guy is trying to kill him. I get on a real world level that this character feels like life is pointless without his lover, but that's not shown in the film. It's said, but not shown. At no point in the movie do we get an impression about how much he loved her. The characters are all like this, especially Nameless. A classic movie rule is ""show, don't tell"", which this movie, despite it's visual nature, doesn't follow. It tells us this, it tells us that, and I'm ultimately not convinced when I'm supposed to feel an emotional impact.

The biggest fault I have with the movie is its attempt at dramatic moments (here on referred to as ""dramatic""). There are many times where the movie tries to be emotional, dramatic, or touching, but I just end up laughing. A good example would be the fight bewteen Nameless and Sky. After the guards clear out, the two fighters just stand there when a blind musician gets up to make his way out, but Nameless stops him and asks him to play another song. So the old man does so and we've now arbitrarily set up a classic kung fu trope. It doesn't feel like *part* of the film world. It feels like an artificial moment the director wanted to put in there. It's like a kid who wanted to make a kung fu movie like the ones he enjoys by copying the classic, well-done scenes from his favorite movies. He copied them, but all he managed to do was tack these elements onto the film instead of actually integrating them into the film. He tried to make them work without figuring out WHY they worked. It gets worse when, instead of beating the crap out of each other, Nameless and Sky fight ""in their minds"". The fight is played out in short, black and white clips, representing the battle going on in their heads, but not physically happening. It sounds like a good ""moment"" in a movie, where two masters face off against one another on a higher plane of skill than a novice, but it does not come off that way. It's not set up in the movie, it just happens. It's so disconnected from reality (""they fought in their minds??"") and the rest of the movie, that it does not add to the film, it takes away from it.

The fight scenes, with the exception of one, also fall to a similar fate as the rest of the movie. Slow motion is used excessively in these fights. Fight scenes are supposed to be exciting. Literally slowing down the fight makes it far less exciting to watch. Slow motion in a fight scene should be used to draw attention to either a particularly important moment like a fatal blow, or to make it easier to see a really cool move. But that's not now it's done hereit's used for everything. Furthermore, the choreography is repetitive and awkward. During one of the fights in particular, the fighters spent most of their time running and jumping around in slow motion. They only attacked each other a few times. It was a very repetitive fight watching them simply fly around over and over again.

Another problem that the movie in general suffers from, as well as the fight scenes, is that of odd jump cuts. In one cut, the fighters may be running away from each other or from some object, in the next cut they'll be right in each others' faces. One fight did this excessively and it disrupts the continuity of the film, making me feel like I'm missing parts of it. Thankfully, the fight scene between Jet Li and Donnie Yen is totally awesome. That fight scene saved this movie for me--it was totally bada**. There were some really impressive moves and my eyes had trouble keeping up with the action (courtesy of Jet Li), which is a good thing.

The Wuxia moments in this movie (and the director's other films) also fall flat on their face. In one fight, Nameless and Broken Sword literally smack a droplet of water back and forth like a ping pong ball. The film slows like it's a dramatic, beautiful moment, but I broke up laughing. This is hampered by the fact that the special effects are obviously fake. In the fight between Nameless and Sky, after one of the ""dramatic"" moments, Nameless charges forward through the rain in slow motion. He's moving so fast, that the rain looks like it's nearly frozen in mid-air and we see Jet Li smack into these floating raindrops as he charges towards Sky. However, the special effects as the raindrops explode upon Jet Li's expressionless face look incredibly fake. I think we're supposed to take these moments as beautiful, but it's not beautiful, it's ridiculous.

A final fault I find in this movie is Jet Li's acting. I don't recall him ever changing facial expressions away from his stoic, souless gaze. During some shots, it works to the character's advantage, but largely I found his character to serve no purpose in the movie. He's completely an emotionless piece of cardboard. You could replace every shot of Jet Li's face with a cardboard cutout and nobody would know the difference. He does such a good job at it that I'm not even mad, I'm actually impressed. Unfortunately, it doesn't make for a better movie.

To the movie's credit, it is very visually striking--lots of use of color and some very aesthetically pleasing visuals. There's a fight scene that takes place entirely upon a lake and it's beautiful to watch the water splashing in the sunlight with the mountains in the background. But these visuals don't do anything for the movie. They're just there to look good. During the separate retellings of the story, the visual color scheme changes from red, to blue, to white. Perhaps this means something to the Chinese viewers, but all I can picture is the director saying, ""Oooh! Look how dramatic and artistic I am! I'm such an amazing director!"" It's visuals for the sake of visuals rather than the story. The Wuxia moments suffer the same fate.

The fight scene between Jet Li and Donnie Yen is the only thing worthwhile about this movie. It's a slow (literally), boring, senseless movie.

Still better than House of Flying Daggers.",1417219200,,7639,4.557174071376548

It's close to both in the lyric beauty of the photography.  It's only flaw is a lack of pace; each part of the story is told at least two and often three times, slowing it down.  Still, all these movies are intensely visual in a profoundly Chinese way: Striking colors fading into monochrome; the grace and beauty of the human body captured in flowing motion or abrupt stills.",1404259200,4,514,4.688888888888889
1889594,3,B00009RG46,"Strange for film that seemed to have lots of action, but at the end, I got a sense that it was slow.

Gives the impression of a big production movie and you can see it has a lot of people and costumes, but I think the computer had to create some people - there is just too many soldiers.

So, this guy (Jet LI)  is going to assasinate the Ruler, but he must get close enough to spring his plan. He supposedly defeats legendary warriors and get the attention of the Ruler who invites him to palace. Ruler tells him that his story seems suspicious and smokes out his plan. The other people in the movie whom he killed recovered early in the movie but late really did die. The Hero (jet li) at the end is executed with a zillion arrows.",1404086400,,874,4.075581395348837

I didn't watch the English dub, with stuff like this I feel it's best to have the original language. Of course this being a Jet Li movie, the fighting is utterly fantastic. This film in particular has a very fast, flowing style, something akin to Avatar: The Last Airbender. There's lots of slow-motion and flowing clothing and vivid colors.

When I finally got it last week I watched it right away.  The visuals are stunning as are the action pieces.  Then we got to the end of the movie.  This film is not about an individual challenging the state to right wrongs, but it is about the state operating at the expense of the individual.  This is exactly the thing which the Declaration of Independence declared to be wrong.  The emperor touted security over freedom, but it was his security rather than real security which he offered.  The land is not more important than the individual.  Crimes by the emperor are still crimes, no matter what he purports to bring about by them.  That may have gone in BC China, but in America this film should be valuable in showing us the consequences of unity by supression.

Do yourself a big favor and track down the Chinese or Elite Japanese version. I downloaded the movie (Chinese original version) before I bought it here and was absolutely taken aback by the beautiful masterwork in this story. The colors, the music, the characters, everything. But what I fell in love with was the dialogue. The translation was superb, concise and didn't glare out or detract from the movie.

None of that transferred to the North American release. The picture itself was mediocre and the translation was completely different. Clumsy wording and flowery excesses replaced the verbal clarity and efficiency that moved me. The pounding Kodo drums and swelling violins fell flat next to the lead weight of the stupid dialogue which popped on the screen as a distracting garish yellow.  ""Ruined"" doesn't even do what Miramax did to this movie justice. They skewered it worse than Broken Sword at the end of the movie. Butchered. So disappointing.

Sadly, this DVD is going in my pile destined for Goodwill, though letting someone repurchase this mutilated junk seems to kind of defeat the purpose.

1) a fictional presentation of events leading to the current time.
2) a surmised presentation of events leading to the current time.
3) the actual events leading to the current time.

The whole story is not presented in each case, just the differences, but some of the differences are stark.

There are wonderful performances from the entire cast, but particularly:

Jet Li as Nameless is wonderfully stoic throughout.

Chen Daoming performance as the King of Qin is wonderfully layered and complex while maintaining dignity at all times.

Zhang Ziyi plays a very emotionally complex Moon.

Tony Leung as Broken Sword and Maggie Cheung as Flying Snow are amazing in a relationship that has become strained (see the film to see why).

Then there's the spectacular visual beauty of it.  Certainly there's wire-fu, but it's not intrusive (and in fact quite necessary).  The film kind-of describes an actual event some 200 years BCE.  Kind-of sort-of.  OK, there were assassination attempts on the King of Qin, but they're really dull compared with what is depicted in this film.

As a lifetime student of numerous martial arts (Judo, Jujitsu, Karate, Kobudo, etc), I have loved seeing good Asian and other martial art films that also have a good story with the action.  This one (Hero) has a somewhat complex plot which actually makes it interesting to watch the story unfold.  If you are not used to seeing these Asian martial art movies, you could become confused in some parts of this video; nevertheless, it is a compelling and enchanting movie to watch.  Like many well-made Asian films, this one has many dazzling colorful scenes which makes this movie a pure visual joy to the senses.

The story centers around a famous warrior and his desire to seek revenge against a dictatorial emperor, but as the story unfolds we discover the tale becomes much more complex.  The emperor and the no name warrior (Jet Li) play a cat and mouse game as the warrior relates his experience in killing the emperor's enemies.  The martial arts action is nothing short of fantastic and the story moves along quickly in each scene.

In conclusion, if you like Asian martial arts films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, or the American made Kill Bill, you will enjoy this film.

1889753,1,B00009RG46,"This film is unrelentingly awful!

To begin with, the martial arts sequences are pretentious and silly to the point of being unwatchable.  I've been a fan of Chinese martial arts movies since getting hooked on Shaw Brothers films in the mid-1970's, and I understand that some suspension of disbelief is required, but this film is completely over the edge.  Scene after scene of ridiculous flying swordsmen, walking/fighting on water, characters making cow-eyes at each other to express deep emotional soulfulness, and silly fight scenes back dropped by fluttering panels of colored silk.  Of course, because there is zero character development, it's hard to give a damn about any of it, and it all just plays as affected and goofy.

More importantly, the central message of this film appears to be that ""national unity"" justifies government brutality.  As best as I can make out in this absurd wreck of a film, four assassins start out wanting to overthrow a violent king who has destroyed their homes and families.  One of the assassins (Broken Sword) has a change of heart, because he ""realizes"" that only this king can conquer and unify the country.  To convince the Jet Li character also to abandon his quest to kill the king (which he does), Broken Sword uses his gauzy spiritual calligraphy to write two words in the sand:  ""Our Land.""  A better two words would have been ""Totalitarian Propaganda.""

The ultimate point of the film is that violent oppression in the service of totalitarian authority -- raining down arrows on schools, the murder of heroes, and, presumably, crushing democracy protesters under tank treads -- are all to be applauded if preformed in the service of a unified central government.  One can't help but think Leni Riefenstahl would approve.

Many critics suck.

I have never been so baffled by so many boffo reviews. This movie is essentially an exercise in art house cliches. Movie-goers will look back on this phenomenon years from now and scratch their heads in amazement.",1339804800,2,280,4.8125

Takes a bit longer to load on my USA NTSC Panasonic Blu-ray player, but it warns you of that.  After the initial load, the rest plays fine, no pauses in scene transitions.  Transfer is pretty good for a film that's over 10 years old.  Trust me, this film is worth Blu-ray.  If you've never seen it, the color schemes are just brilliant and look beyond beautiful in enhanced quality.

1889771,5,B00009RG46,"I was lucky enough to study Chinese martial arts theater (in brief) some years before watching this film. Even the trailers intoxicated me, and I went out of my way to get to see it. As a film, it did not take long to reach legendary status in China. However, the reception here must have been minimal.
The colors of the film coordinate with the attitude behind the story. Red is the color in order to portray everyone as heroic, while blue is the color used to portray everyone as deceptive. There is perhaps more nuance to it than I can even capture.
The style flows like a well choreographed ballet, and the battle sequences are often hypnotizing. Although reminiscent of films like Crouching Tiger or House of Flying Daggers, there is so much of the film that is stylistically so original and striking that it is even hard to make comparisons. Yet, fans of those films will appreciate this treasure.",1335571200,5,903,4.614906832298137

1889774,5,B00009RG46,"In my opinion, this is one of the very best 'wushu' or 'kung fu' movies ever made. This is the movie by which all the rest from the genre need to be measured.

The color and cinematography is amazing. Each action, each word, each musical piece is intertwined to create a whole that is much larger than any part. The story is top-notch and thoughtful. The music enchanting.

When I watch a movie and am left thinking about the real implications I know I've hit on a gem.

Be aware, however, this is a propaganda piece from the Chinese government. It's intended to show a particular take on how citizens should respond to the order that government can bring. If you can look past that and just enjoy the movie for the experience you'll not be disappointed.

It's well acted by an all star cast with vast experience. Out of all the cast I found the Jet Li character to be the most wooden and least interesting. The rest of the characters come alive in various ways and pull up emotions that can often be in conflict.",1331424000,,1013,4.401069518716578

1889776,1,B00009RG46,"Based on the numerous raves here and on Rottentomatoes.com, I eagerly rented the film, expecting greatness. While it earns high marks on use of color, I found the rest of the film derivative and worse. It doesn't hold a candle to Ang Lee's take on the same genre (Crouching tiger...), and Lee's film uses the effects much more in service to the plot, which is more interesting, humanistic and full of richer characters and themes. Hero is presented initially as fantastical, but in the end the viewer is told it's basically historical. Thus the story could and should've been told without all the levitation, which amounts to nonsense if this is historical drama. Essentially the filmmaker is asking us to believe and disbelieve simultaneously and accept the wisdom of the narrative as we are distracted by millions of projectiles and the impossible, heroic defeat of same.
The worst aspect of the film, which nearly every reviewer either misses or chooses to overlook is the blatant service the film pays to Chinese imperial dogma. Forget about local indigenous cultures or autonomy. Wise, all-conquering emperor knows best and sees all ends. If only stupid locals could be as wise as emperor, but they are just inconveniently diverse peasants. Thus Jet Li, despite all his sacrifice to reach a close enough audience to execute his assassination chooses to let the emperor continue conquering the world and unify the lands and their aimless, clueless peoples. A hero's funeral is the would-be assassin's reward. More color, pageantry and copious extras as credits roll.
This isn't art; it's pure propaganda. The director and actors should be embarrassed to have participated. Made by and for imperial stooges of all ages, it looses 4 stars for its inherent and unabashed evil.",1330819200,10,1777,5.068259385665529
1889777,3,B00009RG46,"Of course, this is only my opinion. I was expecting great things of this film, and it does have some incredible elements, but overall it just felt a bit flat. I think that perhaps the story translates (figuratively) better to a more collectivist-minded, Asian audience. For me, the ending just left me disappointed, and not in that ""sad, but still meaningfully thought-provoking"" way that it was probably intended to. I can appreciate a challenging philosophical statement, but at the end of Hero, I just felt like something was missing. Perhaps that was and is indeed the point, but because of that, I am not going to give it five stars. The film as a whole, as opposed to a typically flowing story, is more like a series of beautifully choreographed cinematographic dioramas. The colors are incredible. This is the sort of picture that, as someone else said, would be worth having hi-fi AV gear to enjoy on. Also as others have mentioned, Jet Li and Zhang Ziyi (sp?) are not necessarily the stars in the way that the cover suggests. The other lady and guy (I won't pretend to know their names) carry more of the actual story. Anyway, this is what it is. Unorthodox storytelling style, but lots of style.",1330473600,,1205,4.7156398104265405

I had forgotten how multi-faceted the emotional impact it had on me to see such fine film making and storytelling. This is the stuff of Chinese legends and fantasy at its finest. Merely combining stylish martial arts with gorgeous landscapes weren't enough for the director, he made sure the music and cinematography shared the same vision and the end result just elevated the movie's epic feel into a different realm. I was surprised at how the movie never lost its power to instill a sense of awe at the many exquisitely shot scenes, at the incredible locations, at the scale and the grandness of design.",1326499200,,736,4.625954198473282
1889781,5,B00009RG46,"I have just finished watching this in its Asian incarnation produced by GdFace.  If you love this movie you owe it to yourself to track it down. The soundtrack is so superiorly balanced in all aspects (music, sound effects, dialogue).  The translation to English is much more subtle and balances the written word with the spoken dialogue to great advantage. There is footage, anywhere from 2 seconds to 45 seconds, that was cut from the American release that is not just interesting but actually important. I love this film and now feel as though I have seen it for the first time.  Two small drawbacks.  The written intro is only in Chinese, as are the special features, but if you've seen the American version you know what it says. And periodically the company puts its logo in the upper left hand corner.  I found that after the second time I didn't really notice.  If you have never seen this movie rent the American so you get a grasp on the written intro and outro, and then find this edition.

Also consider that this is a chinese influenced film and not the traditional overdubbed Japanese sword fighting films you might be used to. Ashes Of Time (1994, Wong Kar-Wai) would be another example of this style of cinematic filmmaking.

1889786,5,B00009RG46,"Just as I remembered it, Hero is one of the most jaw-droppingly gorgeous fantasy pictures ever made. Yimou Zhang's direction is exceptional, with breathless landscapes, intense perspectives and seamless action scenes that manage to shine coherently despite the frequent jump cuts. The film's rich sequence of colors gives each act a distinct, easily identifiable tone and flavor, which is naturally the most pronounced aspect most admirers will remember. What took me by surprise with this viewing, though, was how integral the audio was. Every action in each fantastic fight scene is matched by a subtle, but perfect, sound effect that hammers home the precision and power of each stomp, leap or swing. An ambitious visual feat that delivers in spades, it also carries a poignant, timeless message about the necessity and ultimate intentions of war.",1303430400,2,850,5.303703703703704
1889787,5,B00009RG46,"Easily one of the Top 5 greatest movies I have seen.  The plot is deep, the characters are rich, the scale is enormous, and the fighting is both a combination of ground and wire fights.  The thing that sells this movie the most is the cinematography.  It is gorgeous and on Blu-Ray the colors pop even more.  The sound is a bit of an issue on English dubs are uncompressed, but this is not enough of an issue like others have said to discourage people from buying the DVD over the Blu-Ray.  The picture enhancements are enough to make this movie with the few extra $ over the DVD.

I can say that I did a fair amount of research before purchasing and would say to get the single disc over the dual-disc simply for the fact that you have essentially all of the same features for less cost.  Also check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jet-Li-s-Fearless-Blu-ray/dp/B001HUWQEK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jet Li's Fearless [Blu-ray</a>] not quite as beautiful in terms of settings and fight styles, but this is without question one of the few films where you can see Jet's skills with his hands, feet, and a broad variety of weapons.

1889788,4,B00009RG46,"In recent years, Zhang Yimou has been creating some truly epic movies -- expansive, lushly opulent action films with a heavy dose of tragedy and romance. And before he even created ""House of Flying Daggers,"" Yimou created ""Hero"" -- visually rich, stunningly action-packed, and beautifully made, ""Hero"" is a unique film that takes the soul and senses on a rollercoaster ride.

Ancient China (third century B.C.) was divided into seven kingdoms, and the most powerful lord was the King of Qin (Chen Dao Ming). He wants to unite China under his own rule. But he lives in fear of his life, most particularly from a trio of deadly assassins: ""Broken Sword"", ""Flying Snow"" and ""Long Sky"" (Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung, Donnie Yen respectively). And lest they get close to him, everyone is kept at a far distance and the King is surrounded by armed guards.

Then a man called Nameless (Jet Li) arrives, announcing that he has somehow killed them, and is actually permitted to sit within a certain distance of the King. How could he have killed three incredibly powerful warriors? Not just by his impressive martial arts skills, but through his cunning as well. He uses sexual divisions and jealousy, calligraphy (yes, calligraphy), and his wits to defeat all three assassins in turn.

But the king is not convinced that Nameless is telling the whole truth, and concocts a version of his own that also explains Nameless' actions and choices. A game of wits starts to form between the mysterious warrior and the wily king. What is the truth behind the hero's story?

Despite having been released much later, ""Hero"" was apparently the first of Yimou's wuxia action movies -- and while it doesn't cover much new ground in the fantasy martial arts area, it's a magnificent and awe-inspiring film. And perhaps most uniquely, it draws heavily on Akira Kurosawa's classic ""Rashomon,"" by having the King and Nameless provide wildly different versions of the same story. What is the truth? It turns out to be far more complex than even those involved would have thought.

And Yimou's wire-fu creates a film where style and fantasy overcomes the realistic, full of lush color and swirling action scenes. People slash off hundreds of oncoming arrows and leap through walls of droplets -- just try doing that in the real world. And the fight scenes are, simply put, balletic -- they fight while suspended over a lake as their swords dip through the water, fight to music, battle in a swirl of fallen autumn leaves.

As exquisite as the action seems, it would be empty without a suitable plot to go with it -- and while deceptively simple, Yimou's storyline is actually rather complex emotionally. There's a passionate romance that is splintering apart, personal rivalry, and the whole question of what the titular character's plans are, and what he ultimately chooses to do. The one flaw is that I'm not sure why he makes the decision he does -- it seems rather out of left field.

Jet Li and Chen Dao Ming give the best performances of this film -- they both portray intelligent, suspicious men who are playing a strange game of truth and deception. Their back-and-forth conversations are entrancing. The three assassin actors -- as well as the wonderful Zhang Ziyi, as the mistress of one of the men -- are given secondary roles, but do an excellent job of imbuing them with little hints of humanity, tragic romance and briliant skills.

Rich, visually entrancing and crammed with powerful emotions, ""Hero"" is one movie that won't leave your memory anytime soon.",1302480000,9,3541,4.870431893687708

1889792,4,B00009RG46,"`Hero' is a film that, whilst stunningly beautiful and with amazing cinematography, is one that can only be fully enjoyed the first time around. Sadly it loses it's impact with repeated viewing. Following an assassin who attempts to kill the emperor this film has plenty of plot twists and intrigue. Coupled with the vivid colours, incredible locations and set design and flawless fight choreography this makes for one visual feast. I've come to realise that however amazing the fight scenes are, they are less impressive second time round and they actually drag by the end of the film. Scene after scene of flowing combat, however graceful, become tiresome after a while. Luckily this film has a strong enough plotline to sustain it. Jet Li is great in the main role and all the supporting actors are highly admirable as well. This film is very much in the vein of others produced around this time ('Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon`, `House of Flying Daggers' and `Curse of the Golden Flower') I.e. it has lush, rich colours, awe inspiring costume design and the cinematography/direction is highly polished. This makes for a short, but captivating film and although it may lose it's charm after the first time you watch it, that first time is so breath taking it more than makes up for it.

The film relies very heavily on wire-fu, and the martial art performances take a back seat to flashy cinematography and art direction. Think Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon with an even greater emphasis on atmosphere and just enough swordplay to qualify for the fringes of the genre.

While Hero will likely fail to deliver on any level for a martial arts fanboy (or girl), there's no question it possesses the 'martial arts vibe' under its high gloss facade. Jet Li and Donnie Yen are two of the stars, yet Donnie Yen's role is almost a cameo. And while the fight sequences are definitely about art over form, the fight between Li and Yen works well very well and it's too bad that it couldn't have been longer.

In the end, Hero would be best described as a martial arts flavored arthouse film. If that description doesn't sound like your cup of tea, I assure you Hero is not for you. Otherwise, enjoy!",1292976000,3,1006,4.583333333333333
1889799,1,B00009RG46,"IMHO, it's one of most overrated films from China.  I guess most were distracted by the dazzling lights and ""colors"".

First, the souls of this film are Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung, that they save this film from becoming worse than the toilet paper I used in the public restroom, and they should be on the cover of the DVD instead of Jet Li and Ziyi zhang.

Jet Li can't act! Period!  In this film, you can replace Jet Li with a piece of stinky wood, that it'd provide you better chemistry and drama.  Ziyi really has a supporting role here.

Honestly, if I close my eyes whenever Jet Li appears, then I could really enjoy the first 30-35 minutes of the film, but the director, Yimou Zhang fails to show restriant and butcher an otherwise nice original idea for the script.  I meant how many times you can tolerate seeing Tony and Maggie killing each other.  By the time it got to 2nd or 3rd colored, I got very irritated and angry, as if someone just shove an highschool experiment in front of me!!!

IMO, Yimou Zhang either should go back to making folks' story on the countryside with Gon Li, or maybe he should retire.  Just because you are famous, it doesn't mean that you know how to make all kinds of different films.  In this case, Yimou completely wasted the brilliant efforts by Tony Leung/Maggie Cheung.  And that scene with some students jumping to flying arrows was completely foolish and useless to the overall story!

A director (and/or producer) needs to show self-restraint in order to create a masterpiece, which by definition is not too much nor too less but just right.

The ending is also uninteresting!  Oh yeah!  Did I mention that Jet Li is terrible?  Jet Li can't act, and he's completely and totally unfit for this role, Nameless, since the movie requires this character to show all kind of depth of emotion simply by sitting there and facing the Emperor.  It's very tough role, that basically using silence to show so much emotions and *action*.  Only a few actors in this generation can get this.  For example, it's like how Russell Crowe faces the Roman Emperor in Gladiator, and/or Chow Yat Fat shows in Better Tomorrow.  I don't think Jet Li would ever has the acting skills for this kind of role.

No!  Not a great film!  Terrible directing!

If you want to watch some nice special effect and costume/make-up, then you can watch about 20 minutes of the film.  If you like Tony Leung/Maggie Cheung, then only watch the first colored story (and maybe second)!

After learning more about Chinese history recently (my son study it two years ago in the 1st grade) and learning about the emperor who united China and created the terra cotta army, I now find so much more depth and understanding of the dramatic ending to the movie than I had experienced it when I first saw it, even though I found the ending fascinating, novel and thought-provoking even when I originally saw the movie.  There actually is a reference to this movie in the terra cotta warriors exhibit that was on loan to the US by China for about 2 years, and what I found thought-provoking about it years ago, is truly fascinating - though highly stylized fiction it can provoke a very interesting dialogue on the nature of nation-building and the history of China.  Not your typical martial arts, adventure film.",1267401600,,949,4.505813953488372
1889812,5,B00009RG46,"In terms of movie reviews, I believe there are far superior reviews than ones I can conjure up for the film. This movie, along with The Fountain, are two of my favorite visual films of all time. The complexity of the film is layered three fold - 1. The physical 2. The emotional and 3. The philosophical.

The first layer is comprised of mixing martial arts, combining wire work against traditional weapons of war - the spear, the sword, the bow and arrow. For those who actually follow Chinese martial arts movies, there are some basic moves that are considered ""flash moves"" - moves that performed in dramatic fashion and style, which provides a viewer with distinct visual enhancement (and for you more vocal movie watchers, these are the moments where you go, ""daaaaaaamnnn"" or ""that's gotta hurt"") Zhang Yimou's direction was not to overdramatize these moves, he instead carefully incorporated them into the Choreography, enhancing but never overshadowing the plot itself, thus never fitting the genre of a traditional martial arts movie.

On a side note, you may or may not know that all stunts were performed by the actors themselves, some of whom have little or no training in how to wield a weapon. In the ""making of"" section, Jet Li commented on this particular challenge, ""it would almost be as if I have no training in Ballet yet took a five day crash course before going on stage for my first performance."" Zhang Ziyi was brought up as a dancer, Maggie Cheung (Flying Snow) and Chen Daoming (King) are traditionally dramatic actors, Tony Leung (Broken Sword) hasn't done wirework for some ten years. The only two people who are known for their martial arts skills are Jet Li and Donnie Yen, who (outside of Jackie Chan), are considered two of the best martial artists in the business. The physical demands of these actors and actresses need to be recognized before this review moves further.

The second layer is the emotional. Comprised of the loneliness of a king (Chen Daoming) who has never met his equal, an Nameless Soldier (Jet Li) whose quest for vengeance compels him to assassinate the king, the orphan (Broken Sword) and his quest to find a ""home"" with Flying Snow, the turmoil and jealousy triangle involved between Flying Snow, Broken Sword, and Moon and finally the deep emotional bond between Broken Sword and Flying Snow. The latter theme is beautifully demonstrated when they try to sacrifice themselves in the place of the other in a staged fight with Nameless. Broken's Swords' deep love for Flying Snow is demonstrated in his mentoring of her swordsmanship, but his deep love of those ""Under Heaven"" demands his sacrifice of his love for Flying Snow.

The complexity of their relationship also resides in a conflict of philosophical proportions - Flying Snow's need for vengeance in order to find peace, and Broken Swords' discovery that peace is found where there is no weapon either in hand or heart. His understanding compels him to not kill the king, at the cost of Flying Snow's love. Such an understanding leads me to the third layer of the movie - the philosophical.

When viewed through an ethnocentric Western lens, I can see some aspects of the film validating the ""dictatorship"" form of government formerly employed by China. However, my rebuttal is that the film's direction is FAR deeper than that. The film responds to a form of government that Plato called the Philosopher King. One of his most cited ideas is ""[A] true pilot must of necessity pay attention to the seasons, the heavens, the stars, the winds, and everything proper to the craft if he is really to rule a ship"" (The Republic, 6.488d). Plato claims that the sailors (i.e., the people of the city-state over whom the philosopher is the potential ruler) ignore the philosopher's ""idle stargazing"" because they have never encountered a true philosopher before. In this case the Philosopher King is the King himself. His wisdom is demonstrated by his attention to the essential characters of Flying Snow and Broken Sword, his real vision to stop the warring of the 6 Kingdoms and unite them under a single rule, his effort to unify China under a single language, and his attention to the winds and spirits using candles. Unfortunately, ""without war there can be no peace"" as the saying goes, the King's governing skills as a philosopher are not demonstrated here, (it is demonstrated in actual documented history however) his skills at conquest are.

Moreover, contrary to a Western, individualistic society, the Chinese and East Asian countries are collective in nature, which means that people tend to view themselves as members of groups and sacrifice to benefit the group, never to the needs of individuals. Baring that in mind, the sacrifices of Broken Sword and Nameless are not validations of the particular form of government, but are in the name of peace. In their review of the words Tian Xia (Under Heaven) drawn in the sand, they have discovered that their sacrifices are for the peace of the 6 kingdoms and the millions of people who would be united ""Under Heaven."" Such is the reason that the King cannot be killed, such is also the reason they (and even the King) are willing to give up their lives to find that peace. In an Eastern perspective, such sacrifice is what bares the title of the movie, ""HERO""

""Swordsmanship's first achievement is the unity of man to sword. Sword becomes the man, man becomes sword, and even a blade of grass is a weapon. The second achievement is when the sword exists in one's heart. When absent from one's hand, one can still strike an enemy with bare hands. But swordsmanship's ultimate achievement is the absence of the sword in both hand and heart. The swordsman embraces the world and everything in it. He does not kill and maintains peace instead.""",1267056000,2,5810,4.8449144008056395

1889818,4,B00009RG46,"How fortunate I am to have waited for a good copy of this movie.  I'd seen the final section on TV and knew I wanted to buy it, but so many people report having technical difficulty with the CDs they buy, that when I did find a copy it turned out to be perfect.  Luck, no?  But then, I was doubly fortunate because I found a good Chinese Video and book store with a large rental area, as well as a small but knowledgable staff who could guide me through the many titles I recognized and wanted, as well as the superabundance of those titles I did not recognize at all.  And in Phoenix, of all places.  Phoenix, which doesn't even have a Chinatown.  Or even one Chinese movie house.  (Gasp!)  And, coincidentally, I bought a copy of the Tan Dun orchestral suite from HERO a month or so before from Amazon.

A pity, but the film is too complex to review comprehensively.  I feel sure my Amazon readers don't want an monograph, certainly not on anything as esoteric as this ancient tale of China before it became what it is today.  One imagines the legends on which this story is based must go back several thousand years, and these characters' lives must, therefore, have taken on a patina of imortality if only because like most of the lives of the ancients, these heroes and their adventures have been written about at various times by many different people; they have become part folklore and part literature.  We cannot see the real people clearly through the mists of historic tradition, though we can be fairly certain of their existence.

There is no plot in HERO, and some will be disappointed and puzzled.  The film illuminates a tale or legend and is based on a time when the first (or if not the first then one of the first) Emperor(s) of China was busy conquering neighboring states, in order to incorporate them into his own.  We know it happened.  We know the effort was successful and that it took a very long time and cost many lives.  We know as well that the Emperor was opposed, and this story, HERO describes four individuals who attempted to assassinate him.  There was no over-arching, altruistic or political reason.  They wanted to kill him in order to avenge the states he conquered and subjugated; their own states.  The men are Silver Spear (played by a tall, skillful martial artist and specialist with the lance whose name I cannot recollect) Broken Sword, played by Tony Leung, and No-Name, played by Jet-Li.  There is a single female assassin called Flying Snow, played with astonishing skill by Maggi Chun, and there is a young female apprentice played by the dazzlingly beautiful dancer, swordswoman and actress, Zhang Ziyi.  These individuals will attempt to work out their murderous strategems in various ways and differeng places throughout the film.

However, the attempted assassination is not all the movie shows; it is not even all the movie is about; there is at least one passionate, heroic love within the assassin's group; the love of Flying Snow and Broken Sword.  This working out of the story is not told in a linear fashion.  It is as though the ambiguities of the legend of the attempted assassination demanded to be told and retold, in various ways, from differing angles.  There is no right or wrong way, and certainly no direct way.  So, that makes it challenging to watch.  The story is not complicated, really.  It's quite easy to understand.  It is essentially, a love story told against a background of intense political danger, but you must give in to it on its own terms, the way you do when you liswten to a Brukner Symphony.

For me, there are three creative elements to look for, particularly.  Or at least I focus on these three.  The first and easiest is the decor.  The designers have found a way to imbue all the surrounds, interior and exterior, with a feeling of what the ancient Chinese buildings, walls, pillars and architectural passageways must have looked like, by concentrating the design elements on the peculiar characteristics of antique ceremonial bronzes.  This makes for a look of intense but exquisite savagery.

The second element proceeds out of the first:  It is Calligraphy.  One sees rows of glyphs, or proto-characters all in little boxes, on many surfaces -- as well as stylized dragon or monster faces -- that remind you that Chinese, the longest continually used of all human languages, was carved or engraved on strips of bamboo which were sewn together into mats, and rolled up.  These crude scrolls became the first books before paper was invented, and several important scenes in this movie take place in large rooms, or libraries, actually, where stacks of thousands of these rolled-up scrolls form columns a dozen feet high.

This movie has as one of its crucial or plot elements, the ancient art of Calligraphy, itself, you see.  Chinese literacy is thousands of years old, I know as do you, yet truthfully, I have never in my life seen any film or play that dealt as  intently with the crucial skill of Calligraphy, or writing, or simply, Literacy itself.  Not anywhere.  Not depicting any era.  In fact, so important is writing to the story (and obviously to the Chinese) there is a battle scene about it.

At one point, we find that No-Name has joined the other assassins at a city that is under seige by the Emperor.  The approch of the armies is immenent.  The townspeople have fled, all of them but the assassins (one of whom is an eminent teacher in the Academy of Calligraphy) and his young apprentice, Jade.  But all the assassins are fugitives.

In one of a number of impressive displays of directorial talent, the Director uses his heavily armed and seemingly limitless army of thousands of extras with a kind of virtuosity in moving big, armed men, that reminds me of the first time I saw Mike Ditka whip the Bears heavyweights into moving formations behind the line of scrimmage, before making a play.  The speed, the precision: It's simply indescribable!  How do you rehearse a thousand men (and horses) and get them to move like one, on a signal?  Somehow it is done and we see how that ancient army used the compound bow -- and its far more impressive than at Agincourt -- and a hail of arrows falls on the Academy.  Arrows pierce the rooves, the walls; they wound and terrify students, until the oldest teacher enters and paying no attention to the rain of death, finds his place and fearlessly continues to draw his characters in his practice sandbox.  The studdents return to their desks, though the arrows continue to fall.  Abruptly, Flying Snow decides to take charge.  Distaining assistance she runs outside, leaps on the roof, and like a whirling wheel of red, with her sword combats and defects vast numbers of arrows.  No-Name too joins her on the roof and he deflects hundreds if not thousands of them too.  And here, something happens that I have never seen or imagined in my life:  Downstairs, Tony Leung, Broken Sword, standing over his calligraphic sand sketching box, begins to draw in the sand with his rod in a kind of frenzy of motion, matching Flying Snow and No-Name on the roof.  His garments, his hair, everything flies as though he were in a storm, and his movements are incredible.  Apparently, in his frenzy of writing, he is, by matching the efforts of his comrades on the roof, equaling (the effects of) theirs to such a degree that the attacking army is defeated or exhausted, and marches away.  It's inexplicable, but God! it is something to watch!  Tony Leung in a caligraphic frenzy is a unique sight.  It is no wonder he is an international star.

Sometimes I wonder what would have happened had Western or European sword-fighting, become blended into formal court dancing; which is to say into the intricate athleticism of Ballet?  It never happened, of course, but if it had, and if the intellectual understanding of warfare in all its forms had blended, at that level,  we might have inherited the kind of glorious, dancing exercise and skill in manoeuvering and battlefield strategy that the Chinese and Japanese know as Martial Arts in all its forms.  Sun Tzu, one of the great historical figures of Chinese military history wrote about THE ART OF WAR, and others throughout time and in differing countries have spoken and written about that art.  But here, HERO's director chooses to focus on the various aspects of war, themselves, of battle and fighting and to offer them to us artistically treated -- in other words, not the old Samurai-Ninja battles we've all seen so often and loved so much, but -- something very rare, very unusual.  And that's the third aspect of this film that catches my imagination; the successful effort to elevate swordplay to a high performing art.  And it involves the extreme beauty of the weaponry used by the characters, as well.  Sword collectors around the world must covet Jet-Li's engraved and slotted weapon.

There are a number of battles and engagements throughout the movie, weaponry drills, and manoeuvers of large numbers of armed troops with horses, and they're all worth watching.  Even the Emperor fences well.  And one could go on and on about the armaments themselves; the beauty of finish and finesse of design.  But, particularly, I want to recommend a combat that takes place between No-Name and Silver Spear, rather early in the film.  It happens on a rainy afternoon in a pavillion garden, while a blind old beggar-man strums a zither.  Ultmately, it's all about poise, spiritual poise; that is, symbolized by raindrops, the spaces between not only the movements of your body and your weapon, but the spaces between your visualizations of your struggle and its outcome.  The Master Swordsman, Jet-Li fights the way Picaso painted.  He never squints.  His eyes are always wide open.

The second great duel I want to mention, takes place between Broken Sword and No-Name, over a small pavillion in a lake, late one summer afternoon.  Now, Flying Snow lies dead on a couch, and Broken Sword watches over her.  (It is part of the story that they have been lovers and that No-Name came between them and contrives  both their deaths.)  The pastoral scenery is absolutely magnificent; still, peaceful, ideal.  No-Name appears and the duel begins.  It is an exhibition of probably the very best ariel-assisted duelinhg that can be done on film today, with no surrounding trees or bamboo to echo the fighters' movements.  Instead, the combatants, appear to fly back and forth through the air over the lake and the pavillion, their draperies flapping and their silouhettes changing as they vary their fighting poses, swooping and diving like birds.  And then, somehow, because they never at any time land on earth, or touch the water with their toes, the tips of their swords slash it's surface in the way some birds drink, on the wing.  It is not in any way real, or realistic, rather it is fabulous and metaphoric in the true sense.  Flying drops of water from one sword are cut in air and hurled back by another.  Turning from the duel, and abandoning his sword, Leung flies to the side of the dead woman in time to brush away the solitary drop of water on her cheek.  No-Name leaves.  It is over.

I saw it once, watched it twice, very, very carefully.  I had to see if I'd seen what I'd seen, and now, tonight, a week later, it came to me: what my intuition told me.  I had been watching a poem, and or a song.  I didn't know what the poem was, but it was probably ancient or at least venerable, and might have had to do with Swallows on a Lake, or Devotion.  And it came to me only an hour ago, from the past.  On the face of a Blue Willow Ware plate, when I was a child, I'd first noticed two kissing swallows in the sky, flying over a pavillion.  I didn't know; did it have a meaning?  And instantaneously I realized I'd seen that motif many, many times in blue Canton Ware. Yes!  It meant something and derived from keen observation of birds and deification of Nature.  And here, the director was discovering it again and showing it in a completaly new way, combining the art of the sword and Cinema.

All these new films, and this one as well, they do not merely entertain; they open worlds.",1261785600,4,12194,4.68579492003763
1889819,2,B00009RG46,"I should say first that I own the DVD and not the Blu-ray. I was extremely disappointed to not see a high-res chinese audio track on the Blu-ray. I have a fairly high end audio system and when I first got it I would show it off with the Hero DVD. That disc had a chinese track in standard DTS and it sounded incredible, way better than the Dolby Digital track on the same disc. So I was really hoping for even better sound with the Blu-ray.

This very stupid mistake would almost be forgivable if not for two things. 1: The chinese DTS track from the DVD is not on the Blu-ray either. STUPID! 2: The english dub does not feature Jet Li's voice and the emperor's voice is that of an actor I can easily reconize which makes it very distracting. They've also put more emphasis on matching lip movement rather than the emotion in the dialog.

As I said have not bought this Blu-ray yet; although, I may cave in because while the DVD sounds great it does not look great on my HDtv. The worst part about all of this is that Buena Vista does not re-release live-action movies very often.

1889821,4,B00009RG46,"I've only just seen this after years of catching snippets on TV.  Others here have detailed the plot much better than I could.  Color, music, drop-dead scenery (encompassing western Chinese deserts to Beijing's Imperial City to the Karst Country of the coast) and fantastic acting take this martial arts film to a completely different level from even Jet Li's other films.

One thing I wanted to mention was this: the Asian film scene has a WONDERFUL star in Tony Leung Chlu-Wai, who plays Broken Sword.  A subtle actor, Tony Leung Chlu-Wai's face is like an open sky--emotions just flit across it like scudding clouds.  He's mesmerizing.  He's by far the best actor here, regardless of all the swordplay.  For some reason, he reminded me a little of Rod Steiger--not because he looks like Steiger, but because he has that same bottled-up talent.

The king, played by Chen Dao Ming, is also marvelous.  His middle-aged face is filled with intelligence and a quiet acting style that's a joy to watch.  When he verbally spars with Nameless, I cought myself wishing we could just watch him!

Li's competent, and all the action's just up his alley, but he's so contained I found him uninteresting.  Fancy saying that about Jet Li!!  No, watching the many versions of ""what happened to Broken Sword"" simply made my night.  I'm looking forward to seeing him in other films.",1257379200,,1367,4.836206896551724

So, let's get down to basics and the things that do actually matter. My wife (who is Chinese) and I sat down in front of our Kuro Reference and had a great time. We listened to the 'lowly' 5.1 Putonghua track, of course, and were not bothered one whit.

This is a great wushu epic with charismatic actors, stunning locations, decent CGI and - above all- fabulous cinematography.

1889824,3,B00009RG46,"Beautiful, artistic, poetic...an enchanting martial arts film that will captivate you with every scene!

These are the words I feel about ""HERO"", the 2002 film directed by Zhang Yimou (""Curse of the Golden Flower"", ""The House of Flying Daggers"" and ""Happy Times"") and a film that would feature cinematography by Christopher Doyle (""Chungking Express"", ""In the Mood For Love"", ""Fallen Angels"", ""Happy Together"") and music by composer Tan Dan (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""The Legend of the Black Scorpion"").

The film would also star Asia's top talents which include Jet Li (""The Warlords"", ""Fearless"", ""Once Upon a Time in China"", ""Fist of Legend""), Tony Leung Chiu Wai (""Lust, Caution"", ""Red Cliff"", ""Tokyo Raiders"", ""Infernal Affairs""), Maggie Cheung (""Ashes of Time"", ""Sausalito"", ""In the Mood for Love"", ""Comrades: Almost a Love Story""),  Daoming Chen (""Peace Blossom"", ""My 1919', ""Infernal Affairs III""), Zhang Ziyi (""House of Flying Dagger"", ""My Wife is a Gangster"", ""Musa the Warrior"", ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"") and Donnie Yen (""All's Well, End's Well"", ""Iron Monkey"", ""Flash Point"" and ""Bodyguards and Assassins"").

The film which was Hong Kong's most expensive film at the time, was critically acclaimed, won several awards and eventually would make over $178 million worldwide in the box office.

""HERO"" is presented on a two-ray Blu-ray disc with one being the primary Blu-ray and the other being a digital copy version of the film.  Also, the Blu-ray also comes in a slipcase.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""HERO"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1) and suffice to say, this film just looks incredible.  It's one of the most significant qualities of this film is its artistic direction, costume design, set design, location and most of all, the cinematography of Christopher Doyle.

Personally, I have always have seen Christopher Doyle as an avant-garde cinematographer since he worked on Wong Kar Wai's ""Chungking Express"" and suffice to say, his amazing cinematography and the tight editing really pulled the artistic vision of director Zhang Yimou to new heights.

Picture quality is vibrant.  Very vibrant and color plays a big part in this film.  Grain is seen on the film and I'm glad to see that Walt Disney has again kept with that and not gone the excessive DNR (Digital Noise Reduction) route.  But for a film that came out back in 2002, is it a reference film on Blu-ray?  Not really.  But it does look very good.  Part of the main reason is that despite the film being shot in beautiful locations and costume design and the colors really enhance the look of the film, it's no super clear, nor is it reference quality compared to recently released films on Blu-ray but still, ""HERO"" is just absolutely magnificent to watch.

As for audio quality, this is where it pains me to give it slightly less than perfect score.  The film is presented with an English 5.1 DTS-HD losless audio track but the original Chinese language is only in Dolby Digital 5.1 (along with the Spanish and French).  For a film of this caliber, I was hoping there would be a lossless audio track for the Chinese language but unfortunately, it's not.

But for some, I know it's a dealbreaker for some that the original language is not in lossless audio but the English version is and to be fair, I will say that the English dubwork is very good for this film.  For earlier DVD releases, Asian films released in the US had terrible English dubbing but I will say that ""HERO"" turned out very well.

For audio, sounds such as the rains, swords clanging, arrows zipping through air... this is all captured quite well on the DTS-HD lossless audio track and sounds great.  For the most part, audio is front and central channel driven with dialogue, music and sound effects but many of the soundtracks do utilize the surround channels.  Again, I wish the original language was in lossless but for those who enjoyed the dubwork, you will be pleased by the DTS-HD audio.

As for subtitles, subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""HERO"" comes with the following special features (in 480i, English 2.0 Dolby Digital, English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles):

  * Close-Up of a Fight Scene - (9:18) The secrets of the fighting choreography of ""HERO"".  Quentin Tarentino, Jet Li and Donni Yuen discuss the fighting choreography.  Also, storyboard and fighting scene comparisons.  (Note: Some of the footage is the same as the one used on the main featurette).

JUDGMENT CALL:

""HERO"" is a film that really distinguishes itself from other martial arts film due to its artistic style, wonderful cinematography, well-chosen locations and of course, having a talented director and top talents of HK cinema definitely helps as well.

For the most part, ""HERO"" was definitely one of those films that you can remember for many years later for its scenes.  From the vibrancy of the colors used, the battle scene on top of the lake (which Director Zhang Yimou wanted perfect still waters and didn't mind waiting to film when it happened), the thousands of arrowheads attacking the art school, there is simply many scenes that are just memorable.

Sure, ""HERO"" is a beautiful film known for its cinematography, its talent, its location but what about the storyline?  The story of ""HERO"" is good but not great.  Where a film like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is one of those films that captured beauty through its storyline, ""HERO"" definitely relies on the visuals to enhance the storyline.  Because the film is split up into three arcs with three different stories of what took place, it's all about how the viewer interprets that storyline and how that storyline touches their soul.

Personally, I have found ""HERO"" almost like a piece of art.  You embrace everything that went on to create that artistic piece.  From its characters as Jet Li and Donnie Yen are just fantastic when they battle each other during their scene.  You know that when these two are together onscreen, you're going to get a beautiful, captivating scene with the best fighting choreography.  When you see Tony Leung Chiu Wai and Maggie Chung, you know that these two have awesome chemistry and that they can bring out the more dramatic scenes and even during their fighting scenes, everything seems believable and the two enforce the vibrancy and color of the film.  The same goes with Zhang Ziyi who brings the more emotional scenes to the film.

But is the Blu-ray release perfect?  Unfortunately, it misses the mark of perfection due to the Blu-ray not including a lossless audio track for the Chinese language.  I was so excited about ""HERO"" on Blu-ray and it's a given, we are going to get awesome picture quality because it's a colorful and vibrant film.  You know that the scene between Falling Snow vs. Moon with its rich red colors and yellow leaves is going to be absolutely brilliant on HD or the scene when Broken Sword and Falling Snow wear these blue outfits or their green outfits and you know that color is going to look great on Blu-ray.  But along with that awesome picture quality, you want awesome audio.

The English dub is definitely one of the better English dubs for an Asian film and the lossless audio track was very good.  But I was torn by wanting to watch the film in its original language but knowing that the audio quality of the Chinese Dolby Digital 5.1 was nowhere near the 5.1 DTS-HD English track.  For a fan of this film, for me...it was bittersweet.

So, overall ""HERO"" is definitely a wonderful film to catch on Blu-ray and it's great to see Disney give this release a digital copy as well.  But for the most part, ""HERO"" could have been a great release but without the Chinese audio track in HD, it ends up being just an average release.",1252972800,68,8377,4.876944837340877

We don't see French films dubbed, so why did this stupid film company go out of its way to destroy a great Chinese film in this way? It's ignorance on a grand scale. Dumbos at Miramax need to realise that there is a great joy to watching subtitled foreign films and no-one wants to see great art films destroyed with these inappropriately dubbed soundtracks.

The greatness of Zhang Yimou classics such as Raise The Red Lantern, To Live, House of Flying Daggers, The Road Home, Ju Dou and Hero is partly because of their Chinese soundtracks, and to dub these films is to destroy the very fabric of their art. I own House of Flying Daggers on Blu-ray and that film has been largely destroyed by the horrible dubbed soundtrack, which makes the actors sound goofy and unreal. You cannot believe how bad House of Flying Daggers now is and I don't know if I can bear to watch it with those dreadfully corny dubbed voices. Miramax needs to understand that customers don't want dubbed cr*p ... leave the soundtracks as they are, with English subtitles.

My other complaint about Miramax is that it won't listen to its customers. There are a lot of great reviews on Amazon, and across the web, about the film Enchanted April, which has an almost cult following. But is Miramax thinking about releasing it on Blu-ray? Hardly. Not one word has been mentioned about the possibility of this title coming out on Blu-ray. We are seeing second-rate films released by Miramax on Blu-ray, but not something good like Enchanted April, which so many people want to see at its very best.

It's not logic, but it's pure art. The only thing I didn't like about ""Hero"" was Zhang Ziyi. She is a great actress, but I found her doing a bit of overacting a few times. But with that said, everyone gives excellent performances. Jet Li, Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung, Donnie Yen, Chen Daoming, and Ziyi turn out to be a great team of actors.

Unfortunately, this movie's debut on the BD format really suffers and disappoints diehard Asian movie fans like me because some jerk at Miramax (who needs to be fired) royally SCREWED UP and made the decision to encode the ludicrous English-dub audio track in the lossless 5.1 DTS HDMA format, while the original Mandarin track that any self-respecting fan would prefer is in the crappy (and lossy) Dolby Digital 5.1 format.

Whether this was an honest mistake or done out of ignorance or as a racist sentiment on Miramax's part is irrelevant. What matters is that true fans are screwed because of this decision.

1889831,5,B00009RG46,"In recent years, Zhang Yimou has been creating some truly epic movies -- expansive, lushly opulent action films with a heavy dose of tragedy and romance. And before he even created ""House of Flying Daggers,"" Yimou created ""Hero"" -- visually rich, stunningly action-packed, and beautifully made, ""Hero"" is a unique film that takes the soul and senses on a rollercoaster ride.

Ancient China (third century B.C.) was divided into seven kingdoms, and the most powerful lord was the King of Qin (Chen Dao Ming). He wants to unite China under his own rule. But he lives in fear of his life, most particularly from a trio of deadly assassins: ""Broken Sword"", ""Flying Snow"" and ""Long Sky"" (Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung, Donnie Yen respectively). And lest they get close to him, everyone is kept at a far distance and the King is surrounded by armed guards.

Then a man called Nameless (Jet Li) arrives, announcing that he has somehow killed them, and is actually permitted to sit within a certain distance of the King. How could he have killed three incredibly powerful warriors? Not just by his impressive martial arts skills, but through his cunning as well. He uses sexual divisions and jealousy, calligraphy (yes, calligraphy), and his wits to defeat all three assassins in turn.

But the king is not convinced that Nameless is telling the whole truth, and concocts a version of his own that also explains Nameless' actions and choices. A game of wits starts to form between the mysterious warrior and the wily king. What is the truth behind the hero's story?

Despite having been released much later, ""Hero"" was apparently the first of Yimou's wuxia action movies -- and while it doesn't cover much new ground in the fantasy martial arts area, it's a magnificent and awe-inspiring film. And perhaps most uniquely, it draws heavily on Akira Kurosawa's classic ""Rashomon,"" by having the King and Nameless provide wildly different versions of the same story. What is the truth? It turns out to be far more complex than even those involved would have thought.

And Yimou's wire-fu creates a film where style and fantasy overcomes the realistic, full of lush color and swirling action scenes. People slash off hundreds of oncoming arrows and leap through walls of droplets -- just try doing that in the real world. And the fight scenes are, simply put, balletic -- they fight while suspended over a lake as their swords dip through the water, fight to music, battle in a swirl of fallen autumn leaves.

As exquisite as the action seems, it would be empty without a suitable plot to go with it -- and while deceptively simple, Yimou's storyline is actually rather complex emotionally. There's a passionate romance that is splintering apart, personal rivalry, and the whole question of what the titular character's plans are, and what he ultimately chooses to do. The one flaw is that I'm not sure why he makes the decision he does -- it seems rather out of left field.

Jet Li and Chen Dao Ming give the best performances of this film -- they both portray intelligent, suspicious men who are playing a strange game of truth and deception. Their back-and-forth conversations are entrancing. The three assassin actors -- as well as the wonderful Zhang Ziyi, as the mistress of one of the men -- are given secondary roles, but do an excellent job of imbuing them with little hints of humanity, tragic romance and briliant skills.",1248566400,,3415,4.847341337907376

1889838,5,B00009RG46,"""Hero"" is a visually stunning and philosophically profound parable on the relationship between violence and power. It is one of the very few movies that achieves a remarkable fusion between the philosophical ideas underlying the narrative and the visual language that is used to recreate it before our eyes.

Below I am going to recount the philosophical backbone to the plot in some detail so I would advise those who would like to give themselves the opportunity to unravel the ideas on their own not to read further until they have seen the movie.

It all starts with a king who ruthlessly wages war to conquer neighbouring people. His brutal expansionism breeds hatred and resentment in those that have been subjugated to his rule. Three masters of the sword - Sky, Flying Snow and Broken Sword - unite to kill the tyrant. Their attempts remain unsuccesful. Then they are joined by a fourth master - Nameless - who persuades them to join in a plot combining cunning and force to murder the king.

The first part of the movie is only an introduction to the central point at issue. After his alleged victory over the three plotters, Nameless is invited to the royal palace. He is allowed to come within ten paces of the monarch. Later we will learn that Nameless has been training for 10 years to unfailingly kill from that position. So at that point the king is virtually dead. Nothing can technically stop Nameless to take his life.

The king asks him details about the way he has defeated his opponents. He is not satisfied by the account that Nameless offers him and recognises the deadly intentions of his guest. The King then recounts an alternative version of the sequence of events that has led Nameless to his palace. It is in reply to this version that Nameless introduces the central issue.

It appears that a previous assault on the palace by Flying Snow and Broken Sword was unsuccessful because of the deliberate refusal of Broken Sword to kill the king when he was in the position to do so. Indeed Broken Sword has withdrawn from the plan to murder the King, which is a bone of contention with his partner Flying Snow who is still very much committed to the cause. Broken Sword introduces a dilemma in the story: to kill the king or not to kill the king. We learn that he has transcended that dilemma by a long training in the art of calligraphy.

Central in the movie is the insight that mastery of the sword can be practiced at three levels: the mastery of sword in the hand (allowing you to unfailingly kill your opponent from ten paces), the mastery of sword in the heart (allowing to kill your opponent with bare hands from 100 paces) and the mastery of sword neither in hand nor heart (which transcends the act of direct killing and conflict by a vision of peace and mercy).

Broken Sword is someone who has mastered that highest level. He now sees that sparing the life of the king will at some point lead to a unification of an empire and enduring peace for all. This is a resolution of the dilemma - to kill or not to kill - at a higher level of wisdom. Confronted with Nameless's determination to kill the king, Broken Sword cannot but transfer the dilemma to Nameless. The doubt ""to kill or not to kill"" indeed settles in Nameless who is still vacillating when he is standing before the king. The latter recognises this and increases the pointedness of the dilemma by offering Nameless his own sword to kill him. Nameless has to resolve the dilemma there and then. Eventually he decides not to kill.

By doing so he transfers the dilemma to the king who now has to decide whether to have his attacker executed or not. He decides to have him killed. That is a very conscious choice. As an individual human being the king has enormous respect for Nameless leap to the highest level of sword mastery (which is why the latter is given the burial of a hero) but as a ruler he has to respect the integrity of the law and the trespasser has to be killed. The law is not able to transcend the dilemma. It is not able to accommodate the everlasting tension between the two horns of the dilemma. That is a deeply philosophical assertion about the nature of institutionalised power and the Law.

There is an interesting corollary to this movie. Flying Snow and Broken Sword embody the two horns of the dilemma: to kill vs not to kill. They are waiting for news from Nameless's mission: a red flag for a successful kill, a yellow flag for a failure. When the yellow flag appears, Flying Snow is enraged. She understands that this can only be because Broken Snow's councel has led Nameless to consciously forsake his mission. Broken Sword tries to persuade Flying Snow of his point of view but he can't bring her to consider the dilemma, let alone to transcend it at the higher level of wisdom he has gained. Reluctantly he fights with Flying Snow. From Broken Sword's vantage point the fight is utterly pointless. It draws him again in a quandary he has left behind him a long time ago. At a certain point he just drops his sword, a split second before Flying Snow will hit him with her sword. That split second embodies the desperate trust of Broken Sword in Flying Snow's ability to recognise and transcend the dilemma. Either she does in that split second or she never will. She fails and she kills him. After his death she decides to kill herself.

Zhang Yimou tells this magnificent foundational myth in the most splendid and virtuosic fashion. The images are poetic, suggestive and precise. Nothing is gratuitous, everything assumes significance. This is great, timeless cinema.",1233446400,5,5600,4.602204408817635

1889841,5,B00009RG46,"Hero genuinely impressed me, much to my surprise - I'm not a fan of the humourlessly one-note Jet Li, who has always struck me as a character from Mystery Men who didn't make the final cut (useless `super' power - the ability to wave a flagpole around very, very fast) and after all the fuss made over the tedious, overlong and undernourished Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was expecting the Western critical praise to translate into another tired and overfamiliar movie that appealed mainly to people who hadn't seen much Eastern cinema. Boy, was I wrong. A gorgeous looking epic with a real sense of scale and amazing visuals allied to a complex plot, I was kicking myself for not seeing this one on the big screen. Not everything is successful (the duel on the lake never quite works), but more than enough is to guarantee repeat viewings. Li's limitations are used well for once and while Ziyi Zhang's petulant acting still doesn't entirely convince me, it's surprising to find the weakest performance coming from the film's best actor, Tony Leung Chiu Wai. Never at his most convincing in fantasy swordplay movies (the introspective Ashes of Time excepted), he seems a little underpowered for such an iconic role. But these are minor quibbles with a major delight.

Be aware that there is an extended director's cut available in China (the disc has English subtitles though there is a curious intermittent trademark watermark in the top of the screen), although Miramax seem in no hurry to release it here.",1219536000,3,1511,4.879377431906615
1889842,4,B00009RG46,"Red version: Hero is the story of one man's quest (Nameless, played by Jet Li) to destroy the three assassins (lovers Broken Sword played by Tony Leung Chiu-Wai and Flying Snow played by Maggie Cheung, and Sky played by Donnie Yen) who tried to kill the King of Qin (Chen Daoming).  Nameless bests Sky in combat, and Broken Sword and Flying Snow betray each other, all the while fighting off the King's entire army, until Nameless finally kills Snow. At least, that's the story Nameless tells the King, who is privileged with advancing within ten paces of him.

Blue version: The King disagrees.  He knows the assassin lovers and doesn't believe the story. He instead believes that the three assassins sacrificed their own lives to allow Nameless the audience with the King, and thus a chance to commit regicide himself. He has developed a special move, the King theorizes, that can kill a man at ten paces.

White version: Now the truth comes out.  Nameless explains who he is, where he came from, and why he is in the King's palace. Nameless has a technique that can skewer a person while missing all their vital organs, making the blow look fatal. He used it on Sky and he uses it again on Flying Snow. Surprisingly, Broken Sword is against the entire notion of assassinating the King at all, a decision that harkens back to the duo's first assassination attempt. It failed only because Broken Sword chose not to kill the King.

Throughout the movie parallels are made between calligraphy and martial arts, and specifically the symbol for the word ""sword."" There are deeper meanings within the brush strokes, a form of enlightenment that Broken Sword achieved and that the King discovers in his conversation with his would-be assassin. Nameless' decision and the effect it has on the other assassins provides the twist to the tale.

Hero is a breathtaking movie, filled with balletic martial arts, lovely scenes in vivid colors, and natural settings reflecting China's ancient history and beauty.  It's entertaining and moving, and the relationship between Broken Sword and Flying Snow anchors the piece.  The three different tales, each depicted by a particular color scheme, provides different backdrops for heroics, drama, and warfare.

On the other hand, Hero is a Chinese cinematic version of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Who-Moved-My-Cheese/dp/0399144463/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Who Moved My Cheese</a>"" - it reinforces the status quo with a sinister charm.  Killing kings is foolish, says Hero, because it only leads to more war.  Nameless' decision is one of sacrifice, one for the many.  Were this only a fable, the story wouldn't be politically charged.  But the King of Qin went on to become the Emperor of China, who did a lot of great things.  So, you know, killing him would be bad because China wouldn't be nearly as great without him.

The question becomes whether or not that matters on a greater moral scale.  Hero clearly makes the point that we should feel sympathy for the poor King in his enlightened state. Revenge never gets anyone anywhere. And yet by reducing the course of history to the assassination of one man, Hero makes many assumptions: about the importance of said man, about the progress of China, about our own human failings.  It's a very Chinese movie, which makes it either more authentic or less palatable to American audiences. It all depends on your definition of the term ""hero.""",1218844800,3,3470,5.057894736842106

From the philosophy of how to become a good king and betrayals thereof. Everything about this movie is pure aesthetic, and art for arts sake. The backdrop is so illuminating and dreamlike. How in one moment, the scenery is very green, then very red, that it gets really fun to guess what the next color will be. Overall, an awesome movie you don't want to miss.",1217203200,2,532,4.33
1889844,5,B00009RG46,"First off, it is important to note that this version is the shorter, American version.  While some of the changes were subtle, they do take away from what I consider to be a flawless film.  For instance, the translation of Huang Di in this version is 'Our Land'.  And while that seems nice, the true translation is 'All Under Heaven'.  Just has so much more poetry to it.  If you enjoyed this film in the US, seek out the original version.

Hero is fantastic because it is not a pure martial arts movie.  With Zhang Yimou at the helm, there was something else to be expected of this film- and it delivered.

What Hero represents is martial arts filmmaking as an art form.  While watching the movie the thought that kept popping into my head was 'visual poetry'.  The amount of nuance and subtlety that Hero contains is hard to even begin to explain.  But the more you watch, the more you see the little details that add so much to the film, mostly on a subconcious level.

See the colors change.  Notice when all the sound is pulled out in favor of silence, or of just the musical score. The power of a scream where there is no sound is overwhelming.  The interplay between regular and slo-motion is used, not just for visual style, but to jar ones senses or to convey an emotion that words cannot evoke. See th focus change as the direcotr leads your eye around the screen.  Notice the arrangement of people and objects in the frame.  Nothing is an accident.  Nothing is left to chance.  It is obvious that Yimou has control over even the slightest detail, a gift reserved for a handful of only the most talented like Hitchcock or Scorsese or Wong Kar-Wai.

The fight scenes in Hero are amazing because they have a life of their own.  They weren't designed to ""one-up"" every other fight scene ever committed to film.  The much touted Jet v. Donnie fight is extraordinary.  Not because it is the most technically complicated or the most mind-blowing, but because it is designed for these two legends to be in perfect sync with one another.  It is flawless.  Even more so, it tells a story.

In the fight we see the essence of these two characters.  And the fight scenes just get better from there.  The scene over the lake still gives me chills when I watch it.  That may well be the most poetic choreography I've ever seen.

What else excited me about this film is that Tan Dun returned from doing his excellent Crouching Tiger score to do this one.  Except this time, he traded in master cellist Yo-Yo Ma for legend violinst Itzhak Perlman.  This score is more accessible than the CTHD one was.  And the music is like its own character in this film, sometimes being the only thing one hears.  It complements the picture and the story brilliantly and lends much to the viewing experience.

I was disheartened to see negative reviews on the internet where people felt it was a film that was a propaganda piece for China and its rule.  I understand that the real Huang Di was not as beneficent as he was portrayed in this film, and that his rule was violent and short.  But what I saw wasn't propaganda for a communist/socialist government.  What I saw was the beauty of a culture that evolved over hundreds of years of bloodshed and hardship.  And regardless of the official party line, I was moved by ""All under heaven"".  At no point was I ready to throw a Che or Chairman Mao poster on my wall.  I don't think this is the movie that people need to worry about ""sending the wrong message"" to the kids.

This film was not meant to be any type of historical record (that's why we have history books and why movies aren't valid sources to cite in research papers).  What this movie represents is filmmaking at its greatest height.  The film as a true art form, combining on-screen and off-screen talent with visuals and audio that can stand alone, yet when combined, equal more than the sum of their parts.

1889846,4,B00009RG46,"Zhang Yimou's ""Hero"" is probably one of the most visually beautiful and exquisitely filmed movies I have seen in many a year. Set in the third century BC during the unification of the seven kingdoms under the first Chinese emperor, the film stars Jet Li as a literally Nameless warrior who has supposedly vanquished the emperor's most fearsome enemies: Sky, played by Donnie Yen, Snow (Maggie Cheung Man-yuk), and the previously undefeatable Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu-wai).

Nameless is escorted into the divine presence as a hero, but after hearing his account of how he defeated these three foes, the emperor isn't buying any of it; he suspects Nameless fabricated the whole thing only to get within striking distance (ten paces) of the emperor himself in order to carry out an assassination plot. The story then divides itself into a Rashomon-like re-telling from various POVs, each one photographed with strikingly vivid color shifts -- a vibrant red, a pale blue, a pristine white, and a delicate, pale green. And then we see Reality, photographed against a background of lifeless desert mesas which seems to emphasize the futility of it all.

The most compelling characters in the film are Snow and Broken Sword -- she's a single-minded woman warrior with a take-no-prisoners mentality, and Broken Sword, her lover, is a warrior who has fought one fight too many and no longer believes that the sword is the only option to resolving conflicts. But Snow, like the true believer she is, loves her principles more than him, and the resulting confrontation between them is as inevitable as it is tragic.

The acting is excellent all around. Jet Li is an appealing and likeable hero (or is he an anti-hero?), and Tony Leung gives a totally convincing performance as Broken Sword. The cast is rounded out by the exquisitely beautiful Zhang Ziyi as Broken Sword's servant Moon, in love with her master and faithful to the end, and Chen Dao Ming as the emperor of Chin.

There are going to be endless comparisons between ""Hero"" and ""Crouching Tiger"", Ang Lee's masterpiece. Visually, ""Hero"" can hold its own against ""Crouching Tiger"" any day in the week. And yet, somehow, it doesn't grab you emotionally in the way ""Crouching Tiger"" does. ""Hero"" is gorgeous to look at and maybe that's its problem, it's so eye-popping to watch that the story doesn't measure up to its pure visual impact. Zhang doesn't do a ""Rashomon"" tale as brilliantly as the late, great Akira Kurosawa, and in this film he doesn't grip us as totally as Ang Lee, but he's delivered a movie that, at least to watch, is eminently satisfying.

**SPOILERS**
If you haven't watched the movie, go watch it.  If you don't get it because the translations are so bad, then you can come read this and watch it again.  IF you still don't get it, email me...
**SPOILERS**

First of all, this IS a martial arts movie.  For anybody who has spent any serious time study martial arts, martial arts isn't just about kicking and punching.  With particular attention to Chinese martial arts, martial arts is very much more about the lifelong pursuit of peace.  There is a graduation from being the fastest, strongest, most able to destroy, focusing on the narcissistic self, to being a sacrificial humble person who seeks to spread morality through influence rather than the sword.

The first ""mind"" fighting scene should be a HUGE clue into what's coming.  That martial arts is performed more in the mind than with the body.

Next, I read a lot of people talking about the ""fantasy"" like aspect of the movie.  This is in tradition of many of the literary novels of this period.  The whole movie is about what is going on in the minds of people.  It is the perfect for that purpose.

As far as the ""Dances"" and all this, it is so frustrating what I read on the reviews here.  The characters who are fighting with each other, if nothing else, have deep respect for each other.  As the stories are retold, they are being retold with admiration and respect for their peers.  The point of the sequences are one to be a retelling of a story, and two, to speak of those that they respect.  They aren't supposed to be ""real"".

And for those that hate the ending, well, I guess you haven't seen too many asian movies...  Asian movies don't use Disney endings.  The movies are meant to have impact, not give you a good feeling.

Further, for those that think that the last guy standing is the ""good guy"" in the movie, you need to start being able to see something and make your own decisions about what is right or wrong despite what you see or is told to you.

This is not a propaganda movie either, as history did show, a lot of good  did come from this temporary unity, however its cost was terrible.  Further, the asian audience, for whom the movie is made, know too well the history of this Emperor. Besides most already know about the real life account on the attempted assassination of the Emperor and know that this is not really what the story is about.

I really enjoyed this movie, not just because it is pretty, but because of the message it is trying to show.  I mean, who is the real hero? Who was the most powerful?  Who never got it?  Who DID get it?",1209945600,4,2658,4.433884297520661

Indeed, with ""Hero"", he has created a world unto itself, magical and mystical, thanks to brilliant use of color (Christopher Doyle's award winning cinematography is stunning) and the exceptional use of Tan Dun's music (with help from Itzhak Perlman). Multiple plots and the interpretation of events make this a film to pay attention to, and at a swift 99 minute running time, it's worthy of multiple viewings. Jet Li, Tony Leung, Ziyi Zhang, Chiu Wai, among others, are perfectly cast. If this is a ""trilogy"", I think ""Hero"" is the best of the three.

1889859,5,B00009RG46,"Hero genuinely impressed me, much to my surprise - I'm not a fan of the humourlessly one-note Jet Li, who has always struck me as a character from Mystery Men who didn't make the final cut (useless `super' power - the ability to wave a flagpole around very, very fast) and after all the fuss made over the tedious, overlong and undernourished Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was expecting the Western critical praise to translate into another tired and overfamiliar movie that appealed mainly to people who hadn't seen much Eastern cinema. Boy, was I wrong. A gorgeous looking epic with a real sense of scale and amazing visuals allied to a complex plot, I was kicking myself for not seeing this one on the big screen. Not everything is successful (the duel on the lake never quite works), but more than enough is to guarantee repeat viewings. Li's limitations are used well for once and while Ziyi Zhang's petulant acting still doesn't entirely convince me, it's surprising to find the weakest performance coming from the film's best actor, Tony Leung Chiu Wai. Never at his most convincing in fantasy swordplay movies (the introspective Ashes of Time excepted), he seems a little underpowered for such an iconic role. But these are minor quibbles with a major delight.

There is one irritating problem with the directors cut disc, however - a watermarked logo that periodically appears in the upper corner of the frame that can only be got rid of by skipping the disc back a second or two when it appears.

This movie is violent but not gory and most importantly the violence in this movie has a reason for being!!

1889864,4,B00009RG46,"Zhang Yimou has been the darling of the arthouse crowd outside of China (""Raise High the Red Lantern"", ""Not One Less"", ""To Live"", ""Red Sorghum""), but his relationships with the Chinese government censors have not always been easy.  In this movie he tries to please everyone and to the extent that many people found ""Hero"" to be compelling cinema, he has succeeded.

Indeed one might say that with this movie Mr. Zhang has finally removed any doubt that he is the ultimate symbol of modern Chinese popular culture:  Aesthetically exciting, full of energy and movement, both engaging and appalling in his treatment of individual lives, and in the last analysis, more concerned with success and with keeping himself in good grace with the government than in making a stand for any kind of progressive politics.

""Hero"" as has been said by many others, is a visually stunning peice of film-making and quite possibly the most beautiful film of  2004, and perhaps the five years before that as well.  The acting particularly by the dramatic leads (Tony Leung, and Maggie Cheung) is spectacular and supporting performances by Jet Li, Donny Yen and Chen Daoming are excellent.  Zhang Ziyi does her usual histrionic eye-candy routine.  Personally I am not a great fan, but she does her job and doesn't get in the way too much.  Why Tony Leung would have chosen her over the infinitely-sexier Maggie Cheung is way beyond me, but I digress.

The story is typically Chinese in that character is not nearly as important as plot.  The job of the actor is to suggest character depth based on the parameters of the character given.  In some cases e.g. Donnie Yen's aristocratic Sky, this can be done even with minimal lines.  In other cases, most obviously Jet Li's performance as Nameless, the character serves to drive the plot and is not meant to be psychologically complex or emotionally compelling.

My personal view of ""Hero"" is that it is Zhang Yimou's answer to the philosophical issues raised by Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", in which duty and happiness are juxtaposed against one another, with the moral victory going to the latter.

For Zhang, the answer is not nearly as clear.  ""Hero"" ends with the defeat of the forces of beauty, skill and integrity, and the triumph of totalitarianism and unflinching vision.  QIn Shihuang is a monster, Zhang posits, but he is the only man who can unite the country and usher in 3000 years (or however many it currently is) of Chinese greatness.

As someone who had friends who were in Tiananmen Square the night the tanks rolled in, I can't say I have a lot of sympathy for this view.  As a successful movie maker and, at the time, the romantic partner of the aforementioned Miss Zhang, Zhang Yimou may have the luxury of being resigned to the course of Chinese history, but if China is to take it's rightful place among the great nations of the world, there'd better be a more robust moral compass in effect than the one that he seems to be backing in this movie.  Not everyone agrees with this view of course.  For a very well-thought-through argument against this position see Jenny Kwok Wah Lau's discussion of ""Hero"" in Jumpcut vol. 49.",1194739200,4,3189,4.7723132969034605

The plot takes place 2000 years ago, with 7 warring states in the Chinese region.  The ruler of Qin (Chen Dao Ming) wants to conquer his fellow states, and unite China.  Assassins are after him, and thus he shields himself in the palace to keep all but his most loyal followers away from him.  A prefect from Qin is summoned to the King, as he has killed 3 assassins who have been attempting to take the King's life for some years!  Nameless (Jet Li) comes to the King, and then relates his story on how he killed each of the 3 assassins.
The first battle is between Nameless and Sky (played by Donnie Yen).  For those waiting for the sequel battle to ""Once Upon a Time in China II"", you will not be disappointed.  The scene is intense: as they battle in a rainy courtyard, with a music player providing background music.  So intense in fact, that eventually the battle is fought within their minds!
 Next, Nameless tells the King he travels to a small calligraphy school to encounter the assassins Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) and Broken Sword (Tony Leung) who are currently lovers at odds.  There is a beautiful scene where the King's army lays assault to the school with arrows, as the students and teacher perform calligraphy.  Eventually, Nameless challenges them to a duel, but they cannot decide who goes.  Flying Snow stabs Sword, but then has to first fight Moon, (Zhang Ziyi), who is Sword's apprentice.  When Snow kills Moon, she goes to battle Nameless, who defeats and kills her!  Following all of this?  When Nameless finishes his story, the King does not believe him.  And thus enfolds, the rest of the story from the King's viewpoint, and then what really happened!  I was impressed by the depth of the characters and story, that eventually leads to the sad climax, and the true meaning of ""Our Land"" !
  The movie is visually stunning!  The background, the remote locations, the costumes, and the use of colors are awesome.  The director uses coloring to influence the characters and the scenes!  From the brightness of the yellow leaves, to the blue lake, to the green sheets in the palace, all the coloring is an explosion on your eyesight.
  There are some extras on the DVD:
* Hero Defined: is basically an overview on what Director Zhang Yimou thought of the movie as he began production of the script, and how he wanted to make a ""Swordsman"" movie and what it takes to make a ""Hero"".  I am still amazed that this was his first action film!  Impressive!  Also, for the lake scene, it took them 20 days to film the scene, as they could only shoot from 10am to 12Noon, because of the calmness of the lake at that particular period.
* Storyboards
* Conversation with Quentin Tarantino and Jet Li:  An informational talk about martial arts films, and Jet Li's various performances in them.

Some people have compared the retelling of the story (from three different perspectives) as similar to the approach of RASHOMAN (directed by Akira Kurosawa).  The question that remains for us is whether ""Nameless"" (Jet Li) is a ruthless murderer or a fearless warrior who has taken a stand for those castaways from the lower rungs of society.  The supporting cast is equally intriguing in their roles, and, the lines between good and evil become increasingly blurred through character examination and the reallignment of the angles of human manipulation.

The film puts the empire ideal on pedestal, which I know is fashionable nowadays even in wealthy democracies, but we have to see that this film is a clear answer to criticisms about the Tianmen square massacre and the cruel oppression of Tibet. The choice of warring kingdoms versus one big peaceful empire is itself a misrepresentation as it neglected the third most obvious possibility: making peace, which I must agree might not have been an option 2000 years ago at the birth of the Chinese Empire but should be now.

And there are plenty of impressive things from warriors so powerful they do battle within their minds, to a wise character named Broken Sword, who fights with just that. All of them have names except the main character, Nameless. And when watching the movie you will understand why.

If the movie has any weakness in my opinion it's that the ending with a couple of the characters is just a bit drawn out and could have been shortened and still retained the same effect.

There is a lot more, but really everyone who likes movies should watch this and see for themself.",1180828800,2,1086,4.334975369458128

The tyrannical but shrewd and insightful King of Qin (Chen Dao Ming) who wants to unite seven kingdoms in one powerful country, is the target of three legendary assassins: Sky (Donnie Yen), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) and Broken Sword (Tony Leung), accompanied by Moon (Zhang Ziyi), his devoted servant. The titular Hero, the man without the name (Jet Li), who defeated the assassins, receives as an award a unique private audience with the King of Qin in his Royal Palace...

I believe that this is an amazing film which has everything working perfectly: great story which is told in the manner of Kurosawa's Rashmon, romance, action (and what the action it is...), political intrigue, suspense, fantasy - and if this is not enough, 'Hero' is one of the most visually stunning films I've ever seen - Christopher Doyle's cinematography, jaw - dropping use of colors, costume design, Tan Dun's musical score, and artfully choreographed fighting sequences leave you breathless.",1179705600,,1061,5.097701149425287

The visual splendor of this movie is what carries the action (or lack of action) and the actors. The ""story"" is complex, intellectually provoking, almost a cultural essay rather than an action flick. The acting is less than subtle -- do I dare say ""wooden"" -- except when the computer-assisted ballets of combat erupt. The whole narrative ends in a way that many non-Chinese may find uncomfortable, if they choose to analyze it.

The grace of action, mixed with the tranquility of story was wonderful.  The use of multiple versions of the same story was a nice homage to Rashoman, but done in a entirely different way, keeping the feeling unique.

1889885,4,B00009RG46,"This movie is a clever telling of three different versions of an assasination plot set in ancient China. Jet Li plays an assasin (whose name is unknown), whom is brought before the emperor of Qin to tell the story of a plot to assasinate him with three other assasins accused of being his accomplices. The first telling of the story is done by Jet Li's character, intended to hide facts and decieve the emperor. The emperor not being fooled, rebuts with the second version of this story that he believes to be true. Jet Li's character is then forced to come clean with the truth in what proves to be an intelligent climactic end.

Unlike most martial art movies, this movie has a lot of substance in the storyline and acting department. Which is this movies strongest point.

However, it is hard for me to qualify this as a martial arts movie. The action in this movie is done primarily with wirework and cinematography creating real visual beauty but no realistic impact is felt in the fight scenes. The action is almost too fake to feel that this can be called a martial art film. The action does have a real visual beauty but obviously pushes it too far at times. The swordfight scene on the lake was a little too far and sort of just.....lost me. Being a martial artist myself and a tough reviewer my opinion may seem a little biased, however this movie obviously wanted to create a visually stunning film to attract a more mainstream audience. So if your looking for a more realistic, hard hitting martial arts film you might want to look elsewhere. I would recommend 'Ong Bak' or even Jet Li's "" Fearless'.

But definately watch this movie for the story. Having said that, watch the sub-titled version NOT the dubbed version. Since dubbed versions always lose much of a films substance in the dialogue, watch the subtitled version as you will need it in this film.",1169942400,2,1870,4.592814371257485

However, I have to note that Tibet and Formosa were not part of this first king's ""One China"" policy.  I also note that according to one source, ""The wars [during the warring states period] that occurred were not generally ones due to diplomatic or territorial frictions among the seven states but instead were wars stemming from one state attempting to conquer and control all of the states. In other words, the formation of the empire came not as a result of anarchy but as a result of greed and drive for power.""

Leave aside its politics for a second, the movie was too disjointed and too iconic.  By disjointed I mean changes in time, place, scene and from reality to fantasy without proper transition.  Maybe my difficulties come from the movie being in another language and from another cultural perspective.  By ""too iconic"" I mean each character had superhuman power, clarity or judgment when the film supposedly was about actual historical characters.  Moreover, the film's visual and iconic nature allows it to be easily parodied and in fact it and ""Crouching Tiger"" have been parodied by the movie industry itself, with the faux-Chinese film that they play at the beginning of the movie to instruct patrons to turn off their cell phones.

The answer is a joyful and reverberating  ""Yes!"" The special features section of the DVD is just as important to view as the film itself. It is important to understand how the film was born and came to life on the screen. First, the decision to include some of the best and most famous Asian actors and actresses is highly critical. The fact that it took almost 24 months to complete the screen play, which was written by the Director, Zhang Yimou along with Li Feng and Ang Bin is most amazing and unique. It is a joy to hear Zhang Yimou, the director explain his view point in writing this unique story, which is crucial to understanding the deeper aspects of human nature. The creative process comes alive and it is just as fascinating to hear and understand as viewing the stunning film and scenery of different locations in China ...

The story line is subtle and simple: a Chinese swordsman is brought before the King of a province of China to explain how he managed to kill three assassins and arrive before the King within 10 paces of his throne. The king analyzes his story and through keen questioning, in a most legal and lawyer-like fashion, he dissects the truth. There is Confucious-like depth to the manner in which the story unfolds as the King is told the three different versions of the swordsman, Nameless's experiences.

Each story has one of these colors associated with it: red, blue, or green. Different aspects of the story are emphasized with other visual artistic wonders, for example, leaves falling during a fight between Nameless and Snow. In the final scene our ""Hero"" b helps unite China for future generations. The meaning and depth of the story and visual cinematography are priceless and beyond word descriptions.

1889901,4,B00009RG46,"I was looking forward very much to seeing ""Hero"" when it was shown in certain movie theaters in the United States. I bought the DVD version and have seen it several times. This movie has a rather complex plot, which is neither necessarily good or bad, but necessitates for many of us seeing the film again to better understand the actual ""truth"" of the events presented.

  Maggie Cheung and Zhang Ziyi are my two favorite Chinese actresses and I was very happy to see both of them in this movie, although Zhang Ziyi has a mostly supporting role. One of the most notable aspects of ""Hero,"" as noted by many reviewers is how Zhang Yimou, the director, uses vibrant colors through certain segments in the movie. The special effects, especially the use of arrows, is somewhat overdone, but the movie, as a whole, is very good and worthwhile watching again and again. However, as far as Chinese action films go, I think ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""House of the Flying Daggers"" are better.

  I was not overly impressed by the character ""Nameless,"" played by Jet Li. Given his tragic family background and the determination of the king of Qin to conquer Zhao, his homeland, his rationale for sparing the live of the future first Qin emperor is quite implausible. I do not mind the patriotic aspects of the film, relating to ""our land,"" and this Chinese patriotism is not really propaganda, certainly no more so than certain celebrated American films.

  My main criticism of ""Hero"" is it should have shown the king of Qin for the villian he really was. The king of Qin was very ruthless, his rigid Legalist governing approach and determination to use military force to unite China led to repression and the deaths of hundreds of thousands of human beings. The first Qin emperor has been properly considered by most Chinese and American historians as being a cruel tyrant, responsible for widespread suffering among intellectuals and the common people.",1151452800,4,1956,4.832335329341317

1889904,3,B00009RG46,"The movie Hero was a very interesting movie, because it was separated into different sections with different colors for different stories. There were black, green, red, white, and blue, each colors represent a different perspective of what really happened.

 There were four main characters in the movie, Flying snow, Broken Sword , Nameless Warrior and the emperor. Each character had their own personality and uniqueness, but all of them had the same goal and purpose, and it was to kill the emperor. I think the characters Broken Sword and Nameless Warrior were the only two characters that had a turning point in their personality and goal. They both wanted to kill the emperor in the beginning, but towards the end, they looked at the problem in a more in depth way and decided it the whole country would be worse than it is now if the emperor was killed.

 I think the different perspectives and the different colors of the stories made the whole movie really confusing. While I was watching the movie, I didn't now which perspective I was watching.

Also, the amount of dialogue is very limited. The director hoped to make use of the limited dialogue to create and touching atmosphere, however, he was unsuccessful. When characters in the movie died, I felt no emotion, because I did not feel connected to them.

After watching this movie, I was not sure of who the actual ""Hero"" referred to. It could have been protagonist, Nameless Warrior, but at the same time, almost all the characters in the movie were heroes in their own ways. Maybe the director's goal was to allow the audience to walk away from the movie, still wondering who the real Hero was.

Before watching this movie, many people informed me that it was a very good movie. But because I am not a big fan of action movies, I was unsure of what the movie would be like.

1889910,4,B00009RG46,"""Hero"" is a beautiful movie, as all Zhang Yimou movies are.  There are spectacular outdoor, epic-like scenes, and wondrously colorful costumes and fabrics (and swords!) in addition to the choreographed sword play.  I would also note that this movie was his most successful American box office flick--and therein lies a problem.

Zhang Yimou is a great artist.  He uses the silver screen the way a Michelangelo or Rembrandt uses a canvas.  His sense of color and line and composition would cause Da Vinci or Picasso or any of the great Renaissance masters to sit up and take notice were they around today.  His films are universally admired not only for their visual artistry but--and this is where I take exception to the direction in which that this film suggests that Zhang Yimou is going--their story-telling ability and their unusual sensitivity to the human condition.  Here we have a fantasy of Chinese history brought to life.  We have supernatural swordplay--beautifully, hauntingly done, to be sure: sword play as ballet--but what we don't have is a real human story.

This is more like a legend.  The great King of Qin, threatened by three great warriors--Sky, Broken Sword, and Flying Snow--is now threatened by a third, the Nameless one (like somebody out of a Clint Eastwood movie), who has pretended to vanquish the other three as a means to get within ten paces of the hated King in order to slay him.  This is history as seen from the point of view of Great Men, not history as the force of events and conditions greater than any single person.  This is also history as myth.  It is nationalistic: the great Chinese king unites ""our land"" in a great historical event in which the Chinese people can take pride.

It also glorifies war.  The great gray mass of soldiers in the service of the king (Zhang Yimou actually used something like 18,000 soldiers from the Revolutionary Army of the People's Republic of China in the production) represents a force that will go on to triumph over lesser forces.  The King of Qin can be seen as the ultimate warlord, the warlord with the largest army and therefore the one who will win.

Yet, there is a sense in which this does not sit well with Zhang Yimou.  He likes the individual heroes, and indeed would have Nameless achieve his personal victory except that Nameless sees in the end that killing the king would not be a victory at all.  Furthermore, Zhang Yimou celebrates in the choreographed sword dances of his heroes the indomitable human spirit that will in the long run, triumph over the forces of sheer might.  We can see this in not only the beauty of the dances, but in the association of calligraphy--that uniquely human art form--with the play of the sword.  He who practices calligraphy with his heart and soul also learns the secrets of the sword.

My problem with all this is that just prior to seeing this film I viewed Hotel Rwanda (2004) in which ironically the horrendous human slaughter in Rwanda was achieved in large part through the use of machetes made in China.  Can we celebrate the sword about which it is said: if you live by the sword you will die by the sword?  These are words that have only a tiny impact to us compared to what they meant to the people of 2,000 years ago who actually knew what it meant to die by the sword.  Or should we more correctly celebrate the word, not the sword?  For it is also said that the word is mightier than the sword.

I think Zhang Yimou knows this, and I suspect part of what he wanted to convey in this film is that sort of message.  However, I think his love of beauty and his sense of what works cinematically overcame what he might have intended, and instead of a great film we have one that is merely beautiful.

But by all means see this.  See this for his artistry of course.  See this to compare it to the legendary kung fu movies.  See this for Jet Li who plays Nameless and is a great favorite of the Chinese cinema, and for Daoming Chen who plays the king.  And see this for the beautiful actresses Maggie Cheung, who plays Flying Snow, and Ziyi Zhang, who plays Moon.  And last but not least, see this for Tony Leung Chiu Wai who plays the enigmatic Broken Sword.",1147132800,3,4202,4.558666666666666
1889911,5,B00009RG46,"I've read many reviews on this and heard many opinions... now it is time for me to interject. There are some things that absolutely must be addressed.

The action in many contemporary Eastern movies is often hard to grasp. Myth, legend, and history would (and did) have us believe that ninja, samurai, and other practitioners of martial arts were capable of superhuman feats, and this is clearly represented in motion picture form. Surely, we cannot stand on water. Granted, we cannot fly either. That being said, this movie does not gratingly or jarringly demand that you suspend your disbelief. In fact, action can hardly be said to be the focus of the film, though the main characters are virtuosos of combat.

What IS the focus of this movie is the storytelling. Though the combination of the music and the scenery are consistently breathtaking, they are simply a backdrop to a well-woven tale that may challenge you intellectually and philosophically. There are twists abound, but they are not the gimmicks or cliches that we are growing accustomed to in the films of recent years. The movie does not build up to a single scene wherein the actors figuratively shout ""Surprise!"" and the credits roll while we are either left in shock or in disappointment depending on whether the twist was thought-provoking or just insulting. Though the story is for all intents and purposes told three times, it maintains a level of tension and invites the viewer to engage in internal dialogue to a much greater extent than just to ponder what will happen next. We are led to feel the losses or the successes of what we are watching unfold only to realize it was merely a deception, not only to the characters we are watching but to the audience as well! There are timeless questions of sacrifice, love, truth, happiness, politics, etc. etc. the themes that will strike close to home as we are all humans and our lives are made of such.

My only minor disappointment while watching with this movie was the refusal to offer a truely ""loose ends tied up"" ending, seemingly typical of many Eastern movies of late. While I much prefer this to the Western ""Hollywood ending"", I have trouble not proposing more logical endings. The thing that I have come to realize is that movies are about people, and that people do not always act logically. If you cannot deduce the reasoning and the emotion behind the decisions made by the characters, that is your problem and not that of this movie. There is plenty of source material to provide multiple ample explanations.

To sum it up, this movie is written, choreographed, filmed, acted, and scored with such loving attention that it is hard not to appreciate it. It is no stretch to realize the qualities which led Tarantino to attach his name on it it so prominently, though with all due respect not many people know what, if anything, he may have contributed (though you can find out in a few minutes if you search these reviews for his name).",1145836800,4,2974,4.7466150870406185
1889912,4,B00009RG46,"After two viewings, I am still not sure what to make of this film, story-wise. I have no problems exalting praise for the cinematography which, for many people including me, was the drawing point.  I had heard it was the most beautiful film ever made. Well, I wouldn't go that far, but it IS visually spectacular.

It's even more appreciated now that I watched one of the documentaries in which I learned to what great lengths director Yimou Zhang the crew went to, to make this look so good. It took a lot of patience, waiting for just the right conditions, such as the smooth, silvery lake which only was calm two hours a day.

Overall, I didn't think the story was that appealing except for the good message at the end, about the good of all being more important than satisfying one's personal vengeance. Well, who could argue with that?

As for the rest, perhaps being a Westerner unfamiliar with Eastern culture, it's harder for me to relate to the mind-set. I would be interested to know how Asians viewed this story, as opposed to similar films.

Sometimes I think these wild Crouching Tiger-like action scenes are too long and overdone, but at least in this film they were very original and, once again, more visuals feasts than anything else. On my second viewing, I discarded the subtitles and went with the dubbed version to concentrate more on the stunning look of this film. It paid off.

Some of the reviews here are extremely helpful so I'm tempted to cut this review a little short: read the positive reviews, skip the negatives, give the movie a try - if you don't like it come back and make friends among the negative reviewers!

I loved this film but go at it with an open mind! This film isn't just about action, if you're looking for an action picture look away! Aesthetics and story are everything here. The film is about the future of a Chinese dynasty as well as a telling of a very interesting and unique story (almost Akira Kurosawa style in its execution).

Truly beautiful!",1145491200,,793,4.866666666666666
1889914,4,B00009RG46,"If you like martial arts films in which swordfights take place between characters that seem to float on air, then Hero could be the film you've been waiting for.  Hero is full of exquisite scenery, vibrant colors, radical fight scenes and an awesome display of extras in epic proportions (it is said that 18,000 Chinese Army regulars played the role of the Qin army in the film). But unlike Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Hero's characters don't connect with the audience on an emotional level and as a result it is difficult to get to know them.

  Directed by Zhang Yimou Hero is reportedly the most expensive film in Chinese history, it is also his first attempt at this type of film. Like Crouching Tiger, it is firmly within the `wushu' genre (roughly translated, this means `Heroic Warrior') and serves up several impressively choreographed fight scenes.

  The film is set in China in the third century BCE . The Nameless one (Jet Li) is a provincial prefect who has been summoned to the imperial court of the powerful King of Qin (Chen Dao Ming), in order to tell him how he has defeated the King's three greatest enemies: Broken Sword (Tony Leung), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) and Long Sky (Donnie Yen). As Nameless spins his various yarns in flashback, the King realizes that he may not be telling the truth, so we get several different versions, similar in style to the 1950's Japanese film Rashomon.

  The cinematography, by Christopher Doyle, is incredibly beautiful - frankly, it's the main reason to see the film. The use of color saturation enhances the viewers experience and is used by the film maker to separate plotlines. One breath taking fight scene in particular takes place against a sumptuous backdrop of bright golden leaves that turn to deep red at the scene's climax. In fact, each of the fight scenes are color coded. Although the link between the colors and the scenes themselves is subtle, there is definitely a method to Zhang Yimou madness.  The red scenes correspond to the characters feelings of jealousy and impending doom.  The blue sequences show the anguish of lost love.  Green is used when the Broken Sword and Falling Snow are plotting and attempting to kill the King.  Finally the use of white seems to signify redemption.  Still, who cares when the final product looks this good?

  As Nameless, Jet Li makes a suitably inscrutable hero, whose tales may or may not be hiding an ulterior motive. His fight with the character Sky, in large part takes place in the minds of the two combatants.  Maggie Cheung is also impressive as Flying Snow, particularly during the exciting attack on the calligraphy house where she fends off hundreds, perhaps thousands, of arrows using only her particularly sturdy sleeves.

  Undeniably Hero has several great fight sequences and is profoundly beautiful to look at. The score by composer Tingxiao Hou's is also completely integral to the film. His use of an ancient Chinese stringed instrument called the Gugin (Qin for short) is completely appropriate (and ironic) and  makes the Nameless vs. Sky fight all the more dramatic.  However, the un-engaging structure of the story means that we never really get to know any of the characters on a personal level, they have no depth and as a result, there's no emotional hook to the plot.  That being said, watching the film more than once will make you realize that it doesn't really matter, the film stands on its absolutely stunning cinematography alone.

  To sum up, Hero is definitely worth watching! The stunning photography, hauntingly beautiful musical score and the sheer spectacle of some of the scenes makes it time well spent. At the very least it serves as an appetizer for Zhang Yimou's follow-up film House of Flying Daggers.",1145318400,2,3776,4.876175548589342

Instead of ""All Under Heaven"", or ""All under the People's Republic of China"", it could very well have been an American movie set in the Civil War echoing the cries of ""All under the Union"".

But that's besides the point. IF it was propaganda, then EVERY character in this movie would have supported the Qin from the get go, but this is not the case with Maggie Cheung's character, who resisted the Qin right to the very end, until she takes her own life rather than live in the enemy regime. And Nameless' decision not to kill the emperor was a very humane one. What point was there? He knew it would have just spawned a whole new war with the next strongest faction vying for the Mandate of Heaven, and what we get is an endless cycle of violence in a divided China. (I doubt any of the other warring states were any less ruthless than the Qin either, just that Qin were more cunning) Human beings are not one dimensional characters who will stick to their beliefs indefinitely. Had Nameless killed the emperor, this movie would have degenerated into another one of those cheesy westernized version of a Chinese movie. Because of his humanity, his mercy, and his ultimate sacrifice, that's what makes him the hero of the movie. It's too bad some people here can't see that.

The story is told in the past with multiple versions and the emperor who is listening to Nameless' story has to figure out which tale is real or a lie.  Each version of the story puts a great angle to the plot and at first I wasn't sure what was going on until I stuck with it.  The natural scenery is flat out stunning and it is nice to see a movie that isn't stuffed with fake looking computer graphics.

the movie 'The Last Samurai' could learn alot from this movie ('Hero') and the characters in it, Broken Sword and the warrior named Nameless. well, i suppose we all could. what i mean by that is that 'Hero' is not just a visual feast, but an interesting movie that may make you think about life. in it's own way 'Hero' gives us some light at the end - some kind of peace of heart and a better way to live.

Right, the freedom to live one's life, which includes the liberty to shop at Wal-Mart.  Not the ""freedom"" of collectivism, which is real exploitation and oppression.  I'll give this movie two stars for beautiful scenery, some good acting skills, and such, but the overall message is one that just goes to show you how socialism isn't progressive at all, but just a return to the old world order collectivism that enslaved so many people to massive suffering and stagnancy for so long. The ""needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"" doctrine has always failed to realize that what all ""no just the many"" NEED is freedom and natural rights.  This are what serve people's needs the most.  The whole collectivist ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"" has always been the ideological basis for the institution of slavery, imperialistic wars, tribal warfare, etc.  Self-sacrifice for a cause or ideal isn't noble if it's sacrificing others for a cause.  The warmongering warlord in this movie isn't any more credible than the other warlords.

While a story framework exists (a classic tale of the First Emperor's war to unite China told with a unique twist on the famed Rashamon device of layers stories; an almost chess-match like conversation between Jet Li's Nameless and the man who would be First Emperor) it serves mainly to enable a literal palette of martial confrontation, beautifully choreographed fights in both the Hong Kong and Mainland, Kung Fu and Heroic styles, each matching dress and environment to a particular color scheme (blue robes alighting across a lake, red dresses flickering through the autumn leaves, black suits clashing among buildings of stone, etc.)

The film's theme is boring, tedious, arrogant, and morally suspect.  The moral of the story is that the means justify the ends, and if the means involve pillage, murder, coercion, and forced conformity then the end result, which is ultimately Chinese unification, is justified.  If you agree with this sort of logic, then you will more than likely love the film.  This, in combination with the visual acrobatics, will dazzle you.

1889926,5,B00009RG46,"Hero is a beautiful work of art, a visual feast for the senses featuring a powerful, complex storyline and some of the most exquisite swordplay I've ever seen.  Western filmmakers can never hope to rival the all-encompassing quality of a film like this because, to the West, martial arts are all about action, fighting, and violence.  I'm no martial arts expert - not even close - but I do know that the true martial artist is, as the name says, an artist, one who uses his limbs and entire body as unconscious extensions of a mind that has become one with the life inside and around him; it is much more of a mental than a physical endeavor.  And, as impressive as any particular fight scene may be, it is only secondary to whatever powerful forces lead up to it.

I see no reason why Western audiences would not be enthused by this movie; the story is built on many intriguing layers, but the basic plot is seemingly easy to understand.  Jet Li plays a nameless warrior who comes to the court of the king (Daoming Chen) of the Quin province to present him with the swords of his greatest enemies, the assassins Sky (Donnie Yen), Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu Wai), and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung).  Quin is the largest and most powerful of the Six Kingdoms, and the king's dreams of unification have been stymied for years because of the dangers posed by these deadly assassins.  The nameless hero is the first person granted the right to come closer than 100 paces from the king in the last three years.  It is odd that the knowledgeable king knew nothing of this minor official turned hero before now, so he is most interested in hearing how the nameless warrior dispatched the three most deadly fighters in all the land.  We are shown the story in a series of cinematographically gorgeous flashbacks awash in the most absorbing, vibrant of colors.  If you're thinking this sounds like a pretty simple story, though, you are quite wrong.  The king of Quin is a brilliant thinker who questions the nameless hero's story - and, eventually, the elusively remarkable truths standing at the heart of this epic film are revealed.  Hero is sure to play more powerfully to the Chinese who see in the king of Quin the man who united the disparate kingdoms and basically forged the Chinese nation-state, but the revelations imbedded in this intriguingly complex story contain nuggets of understanding for all who will see, hear, and contemplate them.

The fight scenes that dominate the film are just exquisitely done.  You don't see a lot of martial arts films centered on the sword rather than hand-to-hand combat - probably because swordplay is difficult to master and choreograph.  The performers make it look as natural as breathing in this movie, however - it's not only incredibly impressive, it's extraordinarily beautiful to watch.  Wires schmires - it's pure poetry in motion.  Tan Dun's soundtrack only adds to the wondrous effect with its endlessly haunting strains.

What really makes Hero stand out is the complexity of its characters.  The nameless hero, Sky, Broken Sword, Flying Snow, the king of Quin - these are not simple warriors; they are intricate creatures with deep, long-standing motivations, connoisseurs of the art they pursue, master strategists, dreamers, and men and women with ideals far more powerful than themselves.

I have to mention the fact that Ziyi Zhang appears in this film as an apprentice to Broken Sword - although hers is not a major part.  Many will recognize her from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and House of Flying Daggers.  For my money, she's the brightest light in Hong Kong cinema.

This film is truly epic in scope - in terms of the cinematography as well as the incredible performances.  The only recent martial arts film I rate higher than Hero is House of Flying Daggers - and I don't expect any movie to top that extraordinary masterpiece any time soon.",1135555200,5,3908,4.78125
1889927,4,B00009RG46,"****1/2

The Hollywood action crowd could learn a thing or two from ""Hero,"" a martial arts picture that tells a complex story to go along with its fight scenes and generates one unforgettable image after another.

Set in the period before China became a united kingdom, ""Hero"" deals with such classic themes as courage, self-sacrifice, honor, revenge and romantic passion, and does so on a scale that is both intimate and epic.  In this tale about the founding of a nation, the protagonist is a master swordsman, known only as ""Nameless,"" who is either an assassin of other would-be assassins who are out to kill a king, or an assassin bent on killing the king himself.  The beauty of the story is that it unfolds in the form of a mystery, almost ""Rashomon""-like in the way it views the same incidents from the differing and often contradictory perspectives of various characters, some of them eyewitnesses to the events and others spinning tales out of pure speculation.  Like the images in a kaleidoscope, the plot points are constantly grouping, then falling to pieces, then re-grouping into other patterns until a full-blown picture of the entire story at last emerges.

The kaleidoscope analogy is a fitting one, for it is in its visuals that ""Hero"" truly becomes a masterpiece.  The film is like an artist's canvas brought brilliantly to life, a canvas covered with the most vivid and eye-popping colors imaginable.  Whether it's the sight of huge armies marching against impressive landscapes, their flags of war fluttering in the breeze, or thousands upon thousands of arrows soaring through the air in a literal rain of death, or a beautifully choreographed fight scene in a meadow strewn with impossibly yellow and red autumn leaves, ""Hero""'s imagery makes an indelible impression on the viewer.  As is the custom with many recent Chinese films, the swordfight scenes have been turned into slow motion ballets, with the participants defying gravity by flying effortlessly through the air to unimaginable heights.  This emphasis on the surreal gives the film the mythic quality it needs to tells its ancient tale.

Yet, even with all its visual sumptuousness, ""Hero"" never forgets that it is, first and foremost, a story about people - their lives, their loves, and the conflicts they face as they play out the roles assigned to them by history.  Rather than getting buried under all the visuals, the characters are able to stand out from the background and make their mark on the viewer's heart.  This is helped immeasurably by the fine performances from Jet Li, Tony Leung Chiu Wai, and Maggie Cheung among others.

Kudos to writers Feng Li and Bin Wang, director Yimou Zhang, cinematographer Christopher Doyle, costume designer Emi Wada and all the other talented artists who have had a hand in crafting one of the most visually exquisite and intellectually satisfying films in recent memory.  American moviemakers please take note!",1131753600,7,2944,5.016427104722792
1889928,5,B00009RG46,"In 2002, Yimou Zhang directed the Chinese martial-arts film entitled ""Hero"", or ""Ying Xiong"" in transliterated Mandarin Chinese.  Released theatrically in the U.S. in 2004, the film's story centers around three assassins, a warrior and a king who are experts with martial arts in pre-unified China.  Each of the assassins are from the kingdom of Zhao and want to kill the king (Daoming Chen) of the neighboring kingdom known as Qin. As the film begins, the king of Qin has requested a visit from a nameless warrior (Jet Li) who claims to have defeated the assassins.  The nameless warrior enters a great empty hall and is told to sit about 50 paces from the king to tell his story.  The king sits on a raised platform. In front of the platform and separating him from the rest of the great hall are a hundred or more flickering oil-filled lamps shaped like small soldiers.  As the nameless soldier begins to tell his story about how he defeated the assassins, the film flashes back to a Zhao village with a massive Qin army approaching.  Inside the Zhao village is a school of calligraphy in which the assassins have come to live: Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu Wai), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) and Moon (Ziyi Zhang, who played the pivotal character of Jen Yu in the 2000 film ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"").  In this first version of the story with all of the Zhao people wearing red, the Qin army opens fire with a massive number of arrows shot from very long bows.  The arrows begin to destroy the village and the calligraphy school.  The assassins escape the onslaught, but are encountered by the nameless warrior who successfully defeats them.  Returning to the king of Qin's great hall, the king is suspicious of the nameless warrior's story and proceeds to tell what he believes really happened.  In this second version of the nameless warrior's battle with the three assassins, they all wear blue and a beautiful battle scene unfolds over a lake with floating choreography reminiscent of the 2000 film ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".  Returning again to the king of Qin's great hall, the king becomes suspicious of the warrior's true intensions as the flickering oil lamps blow in a particular direction to warn the king.  It is here the final and more honest telling of the story begins with the three assassins and the nameless warrior all wearing white.  Here, Broken Sword explains why several years earlier he did not kill the king of Qin when he and Flying Snow had the opportunity to do so.  During this explanation the film flashes back several more years to the king of Qin's great hall, which is filled with green drapes.  With Broken Sword and Flying Snow each wearing green and taking on the king's massive army, Broken Sword engages in a personal battle with the king; but makes a surprising choice.  Here, at last, the full meaning of the story becomes clear as time shifts back to the present for a highly emotional ending.

With a combination of exquisite uses of color, beautiful cinematography, superb martial arts choreography and a complex story, ""Hero"" is a wonderful film to watch.  If you enjoyed films such as the 2000 ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" or the 2004 ""The House of Flying Daggers"" (in which Ziyi Zhang also starred), you will probably enjoy ""Hero"".  What is important to remember with ""Hero"" is the historical context for the film: the first emperor of China was the king of the kingdom of Qin, who successfully and brutally conquered the other former Chinese kingdoms to unify China.

1889929,5,B00009RG46,"Hero, brings to the screen the story of a warrior who rids the realm of three assassins who threaten the emperor's life. The story gets more complicated as things are not as they seem in China...

The film combines romance, drama, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind!

Moreover, the fascinating culture and traditions of China are presented very well in the film.

The plot is excellent and opens a window into the mysterious Orient.

Furthermore, shot on location it provides for some amazing scenery.

Needless to say, Jet Li, Tony Leung Chui Wai, Maggie Cheung, Ziyi Zhang, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100%!  Their great talent and chemistry clearly shows, thus providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again.

The setting, the dialogues, the music and the costumes are all wonderful!

Very well written and very well presented, it is a movie definitely worth owning, yet alone watching, especially for those with a soft spot for History, and especially for Eastern/Oriental enthusiasts.

Strongly recommended along with Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and The House of Flying Daggers, to those with a soft spot for all things Chinese.",1130457600,3,1326,5.013698630136986

1889939,5,B00009RG46,"This mythical account of the first emperor of China, Yinzheng (259-210 BC.), who started the Qin Dynasty, and who many attempted to assassinate, is glorious in its visual poetry, its flying martial arts, and the charisma of its actors. Yinzheng's desire to conquer his six neighboring provinces and unify the country led to years of bloodshed, and in this film, there are 2 men and a woman, who are mentally powerful enough and adept in their fighting skills to go against him. Jet Li is marvelous as the Nameless one, and Maggie Cheung gorgeous as Flying Snow, but it is Tony Leung (""Chungking Express"") who shines above all. A man who exudes strength and beauty in many of its forms, he is fantastic as Broken Sword. Also excellent are Chen Dao Ming as the Yinzheng, Zhang Ziyi as Moon, and Donnie Yen as Sky.

For director/writer/producer Zhang Yimou, a master of dramas like ""Raise the Red Lantern, "" this was his first endeavor in the action genre, and he creates scenes that seem as though they are being sculpted, with flowing curtains and walls that tumble with ethereal grace. Christopher Doyle's cinematography of vast panoramas is a feast for the eyes, and added to this scenic banquet is a musical score by Tan Dun that is a delight, with violin solos by Itzhak Perlman. The story is also cleverly told, with various versions of the same plot presented. Satisfying on many levels, ""Hero"" is a stylish epic that can be seen repeatedly, with more to be gained with each viewing.

It is interesting to compare this film with Chen Kaige's exquisite ""The Emperor and the Assassin,"" which tells basically the same story from an historical perspective. DVD extras include ""Hero Defined,"" with interviews with the filmmakers and cast, ""Storyboards,"" and ""Inside the Action,"" a conversation with Jet Li and Quentin Tarantino. Total playing time is 99 minutes.

The story involving an assissan's realization on purpose and the greater good over revenge is such a resounding theme absent in most action films, and all American action films.  The choice of color and movement to depict different takes on the same event make the artistry of the story unfold much easier then the typical dream or different angle of alternate takes shooting we see in films on this side of the Pacific.  Most of the martial arts are reserved for sword play unlike other films of this genre.  The movie is large on contrasts and gives deep insight to each character along with there motives.  A very engaging movie that isn't too over the top with wire work or dialog.  Great action and sword play and excellent direction and writing.

Maybe that's because of the brilliant cinematography, the engaging set pieces, the surprisingly emotional performances, and twisty storytelling that propels the film.  Jet Li, who it is great to see in a film of this type without a hip-hop soundtrack or a team-up with DMX, plays Nameless: a mysterious warrior claiming to have defeated three warriors who had intended to assassinate the reigning King of Qin.  As the story unfolds, twists are abound, as Nameless recalls the events, and the King gives his own interpretation.  The fight scenes are exceptionally done, even though there are plenty who will find them redundant, overdone, and possibly even drawn out or boring.  Hero isn't a film for pure action junkies who love American Jet Li flicks like Kiss of the Dragon or Romeo Must Die, but it would do them well to see this and keep an open mind.

The visuals, the scenes, are unlike anything I've ever seen before.  In the ""making of"" featurette, Zheng Yimou says that one of his overriding goals was to create images which would come back to viewer, again and again.  The fights were beyond beautifully choreographed -- what we're to come away with are the unforgettable scenes:  Falling Snow and Moon fighting among the whirlwind of leaves.  Nameless and Broken Sword moving back and forth over the mirror lake.  The anonymous demanding hoarde of Courtiers, all in black.  Green silk, cascading like water from the ceiling of the King's palace.  And my favorite, Nameless and Falling Snow fighting off an impossible swarm of arrows, as Broken Sword dances with the caligraphy brush and blood red ink.

There's far more, and for me, the film invites many repeat viewings.  I feel like I've only just scratched the surface of it...and the images haunt me.

If one is looking for a straightforward martial arts action movie, or an easy-to-follow plot, one may be disappointed.  That wasn't my goal, so I wasn't.

1889945,2,B00009RG46,"This is a beautiful movie; visually stunning, outstanding choreography, good acting, and made with real attention to detail.  But what is the point of all this genuine artistry?  The dialogue is a lot of semi-mystical garbage.  Much has been made of the Rashomon-like structure of the plot but without real human content this is just another piece of slick technique.  Commentators who argue that this is a thinly disguised piece of Chinese nationalist propaganda are onto something.  The first Qin emperor is an ambiguous figure in Chinese history; the first unifier but also a real tyrant.  This film's argument is that individuals have to be sacrificed for the greater good and glory of a unified Chinese nation.  There is no doubt that this message is congenial to the present rulers of China.  This certainly wouldn't be the first time a historical fantasy has been used to support contemporary ideology (by either nominally communist or non-communist leaders).  Nor is it the first time that a really talented film maker has exchanged their services for resources to make a big film.  It wouldn't be fair to say that Hero is another  Triumph of the Will, but its closer to that brilliant but immoral picture than to something like any of Kurosawa's best historical films.",1123977600,9,1277,4.976415094339623

1889958,4,B00009RG46,"I bought this DVD somewhat sight unseen and was very pleased that I did. I would have liked to rate it at very nearly 5 stars but sadly that is not an option. There are very few detractors here but I must be honest. I found at some points that the visuals were sometimes so intense that they overshadowed the complexities of the plot. This is at once a complement and a curse. To do something so well that you have reached the highest level. This actually paralells an underlying message in this film- once a warrior reaches the highest level of mastery he is no longer a warrior. He actually becomes the peacemaker.

 On one level the visuals are stunning. The action scenes and romantic undertones are very well played. All of the parts are played with a subtlety that is hard to match.

 On another level there is a political message which the communist government would like to deliver to Taiwan. ""A unified China is more important than selfish individual pusuits"". This may be why such a restrictive regime would endorse the project in the first place.

 On a deeper level there is a message which comes accross as something quite the opposite of that mentioned above. It seems almost subliminal but it is best expressed by the image of a man standing fast in the path of a Tank. He is at first dwarfed by the metal monster but in the end it is the tank that yields. That this selfless act of faith can overcome the powers of destruction is the central idea in most visions of the highest human ideals.

 This movie can indeed be viewed on more than one level. If you are one to analyze and ponder the deeper messages there is plenty to keep you occupied here. If you just want a movie that will sweep you off your feet and transport you to a far off place and time this is one to get lost in. 4.9 stars.",1123027200,2,1809,4.347181008902077
1889959,5,B00009RG46,"Let me tell you why some Americans hate this film. You see, this is a Chinese film. That's right, a film made in that not-a-democracy China. What's worse, it's a communist country, and an Asian one at that! Now most Americans can't read Chinese, can't speak Chinese, know diddly squat about China, and haven't been to China (or anywhere outside of their counties, for that matter). But they will knock anything Chinese! They simply hate China for reasons they don't even understand.

I have lived in the US for 14 years, and I can tell you this: more than 80% of Americans are an uninformed, propaganda-driven herd.

Regardless of the origin of the film, I submit that sacrifice for the greater good is a noble cause in any culture. Yet you see many Americans (and Brits, Aussies) doggedly obsess over the fact that the film is made in a communist country and the message is a communist one. Load of crap. It's only an excuse. Deep down, they hate the film because of their blind hatred for China and disdain for all things Asian. Take, for example, Braveheart, a historically based fiction well-received in the US which extols the heroism of William Wallace. Supposedly Willie fights and dies for Freedom. But does he die for his freedom to go shop at WalMart anytime he desires? No. Willie is a ""hero"" because his cause is (supposedly) freedom for Scotland. (Of course, his fight doesn't really start until his woman is slain, and he gets into big big trouble with the Brits.)  In any case, the theme is sacrifice for the greater good. Americans foam in the mouth praising this film. But if sacrifice for the greater good is communist ideology, isn't it evil?

Hero is not completely historically accurate, but which Hollywood flick is?  Hero is simply a story well told, and told with astounding visual beauty.  It's great entertainment, and in that respect it's nearly perfect.

PS.  For those of you who can't speak Chinese, the English translation in this movie is reasonably good, although some emotion and power of the Chinese language is lost in the process.  Certain things simply sound lame when expressed in English (this goes both ways, of course).  However, there is a major mis-translation.  The two words written by Broken Sword actually means ""all under heaven,"" not ""our land.""  Not even close.  But then, it's simply impossible to translate some things faithfully from Chinese into English, without making it sound tacky.",1122681600,6,2440,4.836538461538462
1889960,2,B00009RG46,"A warrior known only as Nameless (Jet Li) presents himself to the King of Qin (Daoming Chen), who is engaged in the forceful unification of the separate lands that will one day constitute China.  Nameless claims to have slain the three master assassins (Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung, and Donnie Yen) that have dedicated themselves to destroying the King, and the king allows Nameless to come within 100 paces of the throne to relate his adventure.  When he has finished, the king has his own interpretation of events, which throws doubt on all we have heard.  Both versions are presented in flashback.

This film has an interesting structure and a good basic story, but ultimately emerges as an overblown homage to a tyrant.  All of the main characters are presented as beings who exist on a rarefied plane where every act and thought is fraught with nuance and philosophical implication.  This includes the King of Qin, who is not simply a conquering despot, but a selfless philosopher-king who just happens to command an enormous army and doesn't flinch at slaughtering his opponents, even when they offer no resistance, such as the passive students of a calligraphy school.  The strong jingoistic slant is perhaps not surprising, given that this is the most expensive film in Chinese history; I suppose that government cooperation does not come without strings attached.

In addition to the above objections, the film is just plain overblown.  I loved ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""  It featured incredible wirework and beautiful cinematography as well, but it was all in service of a compelling story and a convincing romance.  Director Zhang Yimou spares no effort to outdo Ang Lee's film by straining to make every single frame beautiful with a capital B.  Everything is color-coordinated, wind-blown, perfectly lighted, and slo mo.  He seems to have forgotten that a fight scene should also be exciting.",1122249600,6,1910,5.083333333333333
1889961,2,B00009RG46,"Why, oh why do I continue to subject myself to Chinese import movies.  Here's what I mean, I didn't want to see ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", it just didn't appear to be that interesting to me, yet critics applauded the film for its intense action and drama, so like a brainwashed moron I watched the film, and go figure I hated it.  Apparently I didn't learn my lesson though, since I was convinced yet again by critics and by a couple of friends this time, to see the Quentin Tarentino produced, Jet Li epic ""Hero"".  This movie with subtitles or dubbed, either way has incredibly boring and wooden dialogue, and the action sequences, while awesome lack the realism that I was hoping for to some extent.  I'm ok with over-the-top action, that is unrealistic to an extent, but the action in this movie was just like that in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", impressive but unrealistic.  The difference between the action scenes in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Hero"", is that in ""Hero"" the wirework used to create the action is quite obvious because some of the flying appears to be wobbly and clunky.  Well, that's enough complaints for now, let's get on with the story description for ""Hero"" and then I'll give a final breakdown to finish things off.

""Hero"" is a movie that apparently was made in China a few years before it's release here in the states, because when the movie was in theaters the Chinese import-DVD was at several retailers.  The story of ""Hero"" is set before China became one country, when the different regions of China were divided up into warring provinces.  The ruler of the Qin province has a plan to unite all of the warring provinces together to form one nation.  However, some of the other provinces do not want this to occur for fear of being oppressed under the ruler of Qin or anyone else that may not have their province's best interests in mind.  To thwart the unification from occurring, several highly paid and trained assassins are sent to eliminate the ruler of Qin, and anyone else who gets in their way.  After cutting down one soldier and/or bodyguard after another, the assassins are getting closer and closer to achieving their goal, that is until they encounter a local prefect (Jet Li) of one of the villages of Qin.  This prefect, though only one man, single handedly eliminated all of the assassins and now serves to protect the ruler of Qin at all costs.

As I stated earlier, I knew I would probably not enjoy this movie too much, but I thought surely my friends would not lead me astray (I didn't have the same faith in the movie critics), sadly my faith was misplaced.  Though the movie had potential, in my mind, it quickly squandered it, leaving us with a story that defies belief (even more than ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""), I mean one man taking on entire armies, give me a break.  The acting and dialogue seemed wooden, and truthfully the parts of the story that are purely drama are incredibly boring and really don't propel the movie forward at all, they are only there to fill space between overblown fight scenes.  The special effects and wirework were impressive in some scenes while others weren't as good.  ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" contained better special effects and wirework than this film.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie, unless you absolutely loved ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" or are a fan of Jet Li, then you might enjoy this film.  Otherwise I suggest avoiding this movie and seeing a much better Jet Li movie, ""Unleashed"".

""Hero"" is rated PG-13 for violence and minor sensuality.",1121990400,3,3601,4.757234726688103
1889962,4,B00009RG46,"Director Zhang Yimou is the best China has!  In 'Hero', he wraps fable, history, adventure and myth together in a cinematographically stunning epic.

Basically, the tale is the story of the first Chin emperor, the man who unified China, and the plots within plots of the rival kindoms' assassins who try to stop him.  Told from multiple viewpoints, scenes are oft-repeated and altered, depending on the narrative point.  This device is re-enforced by soundtrack, color, and camera work.  It is magnificent.

If you've never seen Jet Li act, or never seens Zhang Yimou's other films (such as my favorite, ""Shanghai Triad""), you are in for a treat!

I took a single star off the top because the high-wire martial arts scenes were wonderfully-choreographed but just a little over the top, ala 'Crounching Tiger'.  Otherwise, a delight, a classic, and worth many watchings.  Subtle, complex, visually sumptuous.

The scenes are beautiful, moving around in China to get different places, something that might bother someone who knows where things are, in my ignorance i don't mind. There are lots or extras and a black sky of arrows, technics that overwhelm the senses, making the director and the camerapeople tops in this movie.

I didn't know if I was watching a parable about a society being enslaved or set free. Like Kurosawa's Rashoman, Yimou Zhang gives us a feast of perceptions dressed in a pageant of flowing and brilliant color and characters prepared to defend their convictions.  Even if the actors are not emotive, the camera plays to their strengths.  They are wonderful in fleshing out the strong male and female characters by playing with our sympathies and sense of adventure.  No moment is wasted or prolonged.  Every movement is rich, even if it is not fighting. We are pulled up into the rafters to safety or into the saddle to ride like the wind before all is lost.  I could watch it over and over again.  As mentioned in another review, Hero has its hunks and beauties. I loved watching Jet Li, Tony Leung, and Donnie Yen like I enjoyed watching Scott Glenn, Danny Glover, Kevin Kline & Kevin Costner in Silverado. Horsemen on the Roof or Hidden Fortress come closer to this movie in how beautifully it is filmed and the underlying meaning.  I miss the idea of choreography used for dance.  These days, it seems to be used exclusively for fighting (or even martial crafts for some movies).  It would be wonderful if dance could become as important again.  In the meantime, as long as a movie like Hero  or Crouching Tiger can reach even the most stubborn xenophobe, there is a place for martial arts movies.

I still agree that there is a lot of the same thing over in the movie, but that is part of the theme. It is pretty much about a warrior who talks to the king about stories of three other assasins. EVERY actor in this movie delivers a mighty fine job. There is no doubt that this is a beautiful movie. Even though there are a lot of battle scenes, there is still a beauty and art to it without it being gory. The picture is alive with life and color. The color usage/theme is very well done. (I wish I saw it in the theatre). You'll see scenes and themes of red, jade, blue, white, yellow, etc. The outfits worn also contribute in those themes...they are also beautiful as well. The sound and music are nicely set, most of it is poignant. There is a lot of emotion in the movie, but it is certainly not sappy or anything like that. I can't imagine the amount of work that went into the film, but it sure payed off. This movie is a piece of moving art. And for those that like a lot of sword play action, you'll really appreciate this because there is plenty of it in this movie. I'd recommend. I also have to recommend you pay close attention because it could be a little confusing. If you don't like subtitles, then watch the dubbed edition (very well dubbed). I also saw the one in Chinese with subtitles and I noticed there were some shots that were not in the dubbed edition.

1889967,4,B00009RG46,"What is Yimou Zhang's fixation with mixing martial arts with the tragic love story?  I guess it doesn't really matter, since this time he seems to have pulled it off pretty well.  ""Hero"" does what ""House of Flying Daggers"" tried but failed to do with any credibility -- to tell a poignant tale of passionate romance within the context of the classic Chinese martial arts film.

Jet Li plays ""Nameless"", ostensibly the hero who saved the emperor of Qin from the deadly trio of assassins, Sky, Broken Sword and Falling Snow (the latter two being lovers).  Nameless is brought before the emperor, bearing the weapons of the three assassins as proof that he vanquished them, to be rewarded for his feat.  The emperor lavishes great honors on Nameless, and questions him about how he was able to defeat such powerful enemies.  As Nameless tells his tale, the storyline is played out as a series of flashbacks depicting each encounter.

The emperor, however, is suspicious of Nameless, thinking him to be a crafty assassin himself and in league with the other three, using these concocted events as a way to get close to the emperor.  The emperor offers his own account of what he thinks really happened, and the story is retold to a different conclusion, again through a series of flashbacks.  Nameless notes that parts of the emperor's rendition are correct, but others are not, and tells a third and final version of the tale.  This leads to a surprising denouement, where the relationship of Broken Sword and Falling Snow is brought to a tragic climax.  The two disagree vehemently on whether the greater good would be served by killing the tyrannical emperor, as opposed to letting this strong ruler unite all the nations of China under one banner and thus end the wars that have raged for generations.  Broken Sword's ideal of ""our land"" and the good of the nation overrides his desire to kill the emperor, provoking a deadly challenge by Snow, with unexpected and unintended results.  In my opinion it is this element of the story that lends a great air of nobility to the movie as a whole, and redeems what might otherwise be just another high-tech martial arts movie.

The rest of the film was relatively well done.  I thought the initial fight sequences involving Sky were great, but from there on the director relied way too much on the use of wires and special effects.  The remaining action scenes were a visual feast but lacked any real credibility, especially the fight at the lake, where Nameless and Broken Sword demonstrated an uncanny ability to walk on water.  The director's use of color was overwhelming and unmistakeable -- and at times overdone.  In general, though, the effect was positive and lent itself to a visually beautiful, if somewhat overly artsy, presentation.  If I were to compare ""Hero"" with ""Crouching Tiger"" and ""Flying Daggers"", I would definitely say this one is the best movie of the three.",1118966400,4,2927,4.806387225548902
1889968,4,B00009RG46,"This is a review of the DVD version of ""Hero,"" directed by Zhang Yimou.  (There are some spoilers in this review, but I do not reveal everything.)

I have long admired ""To Live,"" Zhang Yimou's chronicle of one family's experiences through China's tumultuous early twentieth century. In fact, I often use it in my classes. So I was looking forward to seeing ""Hero."" ""Hero"" is a different genre of film, but it is a great film in its own way. I have wanted to write a review of it, but it's hard to do it justice.

One can easily appreciate it, I think, without knowing much of anything about Chinese history. But one's experience is greatly deepened if one does know more.

For example, the nameless warrior (played by Jet Li) says he wanted to see his future opponent Broken Sword write the 20th form of the character for ""sword,"" because seeing his style of calligraphy would give him enough insight into his swordsmanship to defeat him. This follows a long tradition in East Asian thought that ""the Way of the sword and the Way of the brush are one."" This is true in a technical sense, in that both require a particular combination of power and grace in one's hand and arm, but also in a philosophical sense, because both require a Zen-like focus on one's craft. (During an attack in which thousands of arrows fly through the calligraphy school, we see Broken Sword calmly practice the character as arrows whiz by his head, and in the same sequence the calligraphy master instructs his pupils to return to their desks, and practice during the attack.)

When he hears the story, the King of Qin smiles and remarks, ""Imagine that. Twenty ways to write the same character."" When he conquers all of China and finally becomes the ""First Emperor,"" he will standardize the style of characters (setting a standard that lasts essentially till today -- the forms of Chinese characters are recognizable two millennia later because of him), as well as standardizing weights, measures and laws.

But although there is much that is historically accurate in this movie, it is not primarily historical fiction. In every fight scene, the acrobatics defy physics. This is a convention of Chinese martial arts films, which the broader American audience came to know through ""The Matrix."" In ""The Matrix,"" we suspend disbelief because a premise of the film is that the world as we know it is an illusion, and to the extent that one can see through the illusion, one can violate what is supposedly natural law.

But from the nameless warrior's first battle with Sky, the flying leaps signal something very different, and very crucial, to us: we are in mythical space. We are in the same space in which Odysseus blinds the cyclopes, and in which Jesus heals the blind. Everything here is true, but not true in the way that an almanac is true. Things are unreal, to warn us that they point beyond themselves to something more real.

Part of what they point to is specific. Chinese, especially on the mainland, have wrestled with the legacy of Mao. Literally millions of people starved because of Mao's crackpot ideas, and countless thousands were executed or publicly humiliated in his campaigns to rid the country of subversive elements. But Mao compared himself to the First Emperor. Yes, he was draconian. But he unified China after a period of civil war and disunity, and ultimately strengthened it. Just a few years after he came to power, China fought the U.S. to a draw in the Korean War. And China would not be a superpower (or on the verge of being one) if it were still engaged in the endless struggle born of disunity.

In the film, the nameless warrior wants to kill the King of Qin because the King's armies killed his parents. Broken Sword had a chance to kill the King, but stopped at the last minute. His lover, Flying Snow, can never forgive him for this, because the King had killed her father. Broken Sword asks the nameless warrior not to kill the King of Qin, and writes two characters in the sand to explain why. They are tian xia, ""beneath Heaven,"" an idiom in Chinese meaning ""the world.""

They all have good reason to kill the King of Qin. But they must sacrifice themselves and their goals for something more important than any one of them: the well being of the world.

The sacrifices are tragic. The nameless warrior is too dangerous to be allowed to live. Because of all that has happened between them, Broken Sword and Flying Snow can no longer live. But the results of any other actions would have been more tragic.

So Zhang Yimou's film has a specific political subtext. But it also has a more general significance, because the issues that people in China have faced are special cases of issues that all humans face: love, loyalty and the often tragic conflict between the good of the individual and the good of everyone ""under Heaven.""",1118793600,3,4848,4.677230046948357

Coming from a Chinese perspective, I watched the movie with the English subtitles, and realized that there will always be something lost in the translation.  The writing cannot be judged from the subtitles.  The script was written in something of classical Chinese (think Shakespeare vs. modern English).  As for the martial arts, unless you've seen more than just Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon and House of the Flying Daggers, and unless you've actually studied and learned the arts, it's difficult to pick up on the subtle differences in fighting style.  Finally, this movie is not so much about the martial arts as it is about the cinematography, music, artistry, and simplicity that is so characteristic of modern Chinese film.  This is the type of film you must see at least twice in order to fully appreciate it.

1889986,3,B00009RG46,"This is such an odd movie.  It is surreal.  Its greatest strength is its physical beauty, its use of color, its use of masses of uniformed men, the panoply of it all.

Its greatest weakness for me was that it had me experiencing the agitation of its main characters.  That's never fun for me.  It is a bit emotionally draining.

We have the convention of one individual outperforming thousands, the super-hero silliness.  But rather than criticize the unreality of it, we can only accept it as part of the surreal character of a film that is a beautiful poem to watch.

The plot doesn't bear scrutiny.  It is a story of assassins whose target is an ambitious king of a region of China, intent on conquering the nation piece by piece in order to unify all of it.

Do the assassins want revenge for the attack against their own region, or do they choose to sacrifice their own land in favor of unity?  Are they assassins or aren't they?

Why stop at China?  Why not justify the conquest of the entire world in the name of unity?  Wouldn't this prevent future wars?

No of course it wouldn't.  There would be the rebellions.  Unity works best when the defeated party has a change of heart and rejoins the nation, as happened in the USA.

Human rights are more important than political unity, which can be either good or bad.  Do we unify the world in the name of Hitler?  Unity in itself is neither good nor bad, and accepting this truth weakens the argument of this movie.

The plot is pretty weak, since it all boils down to whether the assassins want to kill or don't.  What kind of movie is that?  I want to kill you.  No, on second thought, maybe I don't.  I don't think it is much of a plot.

The weakness of the plot and the agitation of the main characters influence me to knock the rating down to 3 stars, but the beauty of the movie prevents me from dropping any lower.",1117324800,2,1876,4.3497109826589595

1889990,5,B00009RG46,"Okay, people...let's get a hold of ourselves.  Many have knocked the martial arts sequences in HERO as being horribly unrealistic and that this fact has ruined the movie.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  True, the martial arts in this film are not the ""realistic"" acrobatics of Jackie Chan.  Instead, it is pure visual poetry.  These martial arts sequences are absolutely beautiful to watch.  Anyone that can watch them without coming away with a sense of awe is just plain blind in my book.

In fact, that goes for the entire movie.  HERO is one of the most gorgeous films I have seen in a long time.  Not only are the sequences superb, but the scenic locations are also breathtaking.  Moreover, the extensive use of color is astounding.  While watching it, I felt completely transported into a different world and found myself lost in the film's sheer beauty.  Furthermore, the mythical story is extremely complex, interweaving several themes & variations of the central plot.  The audience gradually discovers the truth of this film and it continued to surprise me throughout its length.

I am not sure why so many people did not like this film.  I can only guess that they were expecting a pure-action film with Jet Li taking on a country, ""Rambo"" style.  I, for one, am happy that we were treated to something more.  HERO has plot, heart, emotion, and style.

1889991,3,B00009RG46,"Basically, I think the graphic, plot, and theme all work fine and those who enjoy plays should be able to enjoy this movie as well (at least, I do). A major part of the movie, i think, is devoted to delineating and discovering of perspectives (narratives, you might say) related to the proper fate of China proper. In the end, a supposedly supported perspectives is revealed and the death of some characters might represent the painful but necessary abdication/self-annihilation for a better future. Even if there can be a better future, it necessarily involves an excruciating self-negating process. Something passionate, tender, free or even righteous must be given up. I'm not sure if every character and plot fits into this major theme very well because some do seem a little bit distracting, but still entertaining (nothing really needs to make sense as long as you like it).

Some might think the implied theme of reunification is a serious problem. I wouldn't totally agree with it for the reason the emperor wants to unify China and three characters give up assasinating him is for the longer peace of China. ""If you want peace, prepare for war."" This is from Punisher, but it explains the logic well. However, I seriously doubt that the director made this movie to condemn Chinese nationalism, though I don't know if any trace of anti-cosmopolitanism is obvious in it.

Anyway, graphic is cool, plot acceptable, theme...a little bit cliche, and, because the theme cliche, the use of multiple narrative might seem childlish and rather less challenging. But for those who really have no idea about Chinese history during the end of Chou dynasty and the present situation between the strait, it might be interesting. That is why I gave it three stars.

The is even a long, drawn out story plot in the movie involving caligraphy, which I found really boring and did not really feel that it served a purpose in the movie.

The ending of this movie is also very disappointing.  I'm not going to ruin it, but I will say that it made the movie seem rather pointless.

""Hero"" is a gorgeous film.  There is no doubt of that.  As the professional reviewer says, it is ""sumptuous"", but ""sumptuous"" can be a code word for overkill.  As my friend once said of Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""A good movie but a little too much singing.""

The same can be said for ""Hero"".  It is a good movie but there is a little too much dancing.

The premise is intriguing.  China is seven kingdoms.  One kingdom is on the verge of conquering the other six to make one country.  The King of that kingdom is always in danger of being assassinated and one assassination attempt in particular was nearly successful.

The assassins have allegedly been vanquished by a nameless hero, a lowly prefect, who has come to tell his story to the king.

The presentation is simple even though the story is complex.  The actors are talented and charismatic.  The martial arts fighting sequences were beautifully staged and that is part of the problem that I had with ""Hero"".

There were too many staged fighting sequences.  I realize that the story is being told in a narrative style that is similar to a fable, but the actors (Jet Li, Zhang Ziyi, and notably, Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung) are excellent and I would have loved to see more of their story and their acting with respect to their sacrifice and a little less ""suspended with wires"" martial arts.

But then again, maybe that's just me.

Even with the criticism above, I did not feel like I wasted two hours or my money when the credits started to roll.  That is always a plus and why I gave it four stars.

Also as a work of art, ""Hero"" rises much above most visually impressive movies of this genre---the plot does require a fair amount of concentration and thought to really understand, and during the last 30 minutes or so a strong Buddhist subtext arises unexpectedly.  This was a pleasant and remarkable surprise.

The subtext is Buddhist, but also very nationalistic and politically convenient from the Chinese perspective---I'm sure that the still-totalitarian Chinese government must've been very happy to see this one come out!

The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 stars is because I felt that many of the fight scenes were a bit overboard, and things got a little melodramatic towards the end between the main characters.

But it was a very fun way to spend 2 hours!",1113350400,2,883,5.013698630136986
1890013,5,B00009RG46,"Hero is a gorgeous movie, and when I say gorgeous I mean that it was breathtakingly beautiful. Although the translation from Mandarin to English lost some of its power and overall intelligence, it wasn't too bad after the first ten minutes of getting use to it.

Hero is a movie that requires deep concentration as Jet LI and the king tell us their take on each side of the story portrayed here. It is a moving and emotional story of true love, revenge, desire and hatred that shaped and molded the future of China. It is a story of three people and their inner struggles to survive in a world that was ruled by a king they did not understand. Ultimatly it is a story of three people and their various struggles to overcome the passion and bonds they shared to shape their opinions on how the world should and would ruled.

The ending is very sad, its not many movies that can force me to tears, but this one did. Definatly a must see for all Jet Li fans. You won't be disappointed in this particular Hero.",1113177600,3,1006,4.345744680851064

1890016,5,B00009RG46,"The story of ""Hero"" mirrors that of the Kurusawa classic ""Rashomon,"" whereby the ""same"" tale is told differently every time it's narrated.  The plot basically revolves around the deaths of three assassins who are determined to murder the king of Qin (pronounced ""chin""), a powerful kingdom that is to unite China eventually.  The nameless hero, played by Jet Li, claims to have killed all three, and proceeds to present his story to the Qin king.  When the king discovers some discrepancies in the hero's story, the hero changes the story.  Finally, the king presents his own version of the events.

The plot is more or less a ploy to present some beautiful and powerful scenes and doesn't quite stand on its own, esp. since it more or less copies the Rashomon formula.  But the film is, to repeat myself, both beautiful and powerful.  The kung-fu moves are dance-like as in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" but with more energy and more precision.  The hero is almost like Superman; whereas Superman is kind of cute, the hero here is all business, very professional, yet you can't help but feel some sympathy for his plight.  The arrow scenes are very carefully designed and leave the audience breathless.  The filmmakers employed thousands of extras (as opposed to using computer graphics) for the invasion scenes, which are again impressive.

Hero breaks no new grounds in filmmaking, but it does a terrific visual job.  Underneath all its beauty and overwhelmingness is a story of faith and betrayal.

1890017,5,B00009RG46,"Fist of all I would like to say wow! When I watched the film for the first time it was like looking at a beautiful painting for the first time. It felt like pure art and that is exacly what it is. Art. The film is about a warrior who has defeated the three most threatening assassins to his king. In return for his efforts he is awarded money, land but most of all the privlige to sit within ten paces of the king. As the warrior tells the king of how he defeated these three brilliant assassins we go back in time and get a quite stunning visual interpretation of the warriors story. However the king is not convinced of this story as he knows of these assassins and almost lost his life to one of them. What we get now is the story from how the king thinks these events unfolded and this includes the king thinking this warrior has defeated these assassins because he knew he could get close enough to the king to kill him himself. Is the king right? I don't want to give anything away because this was an absolutley incredible experience for me and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. The movie has many layers and unfolds very exquisitey bringing out almost every emotion we have as human beings. Not many films can do that.

Now time for me to explain the tittle of my review. What is an orb? We know they are in the shape of a ball, small and fast moving. They are also sighted in areas that are ""haunted"" or areas that have a lot of history or/and both. Orbs are not visible to the naked eye and they are either caught on camera and rarley captured on home video. Nobody really knows what an orb is. Some say electricty causes them and some say they are a form of ghost. Either way I have seen a lot of movies and never in my whole life have I seen an orb captured in a motion picture. Untill now.

The first couple of times I did not notice it. But earlier today I watched ""Hero"" and noticed something in the corner of the screen. I thought nothing of it at first but I wanted to be sure so I skipped back a scene and watched very carefully. If you want to see this orb skip through the movie untill the time passed says exacley 1 hour 26 minutes and 39 seconds. This object which I believe is a orb is visable for exacley one second and it starts off at the top right hand corner of the screen and ends up in the bottom middle of the screen. When the dvd is on pause I suggest you zoom in as much as you can and press the pause button another nineteen times and you can see the path it takes from start to finish. Now that's something you won't find in the special features.",1111881600,6,2585,4.086614173228346
1890018,5,B00009RG46,"I didn't know what to expect when I rented Hero, but I was pleasantly surprised. With its intense visual style, gracefully choreographed fight scenes and a storyline that you are really able to get into, Hero proves to be the only movie I've seen recently that is really worth a damn. I've heard people say it's the Chinese 'Braveheart' and I really think that sums this picture up. This definitely feels like epic filmmaking. I would absolutely recommend this one to not only people that are fans of martial arts movies, but also to people who are enraptured by awesome storytelling. Plus the visual style in this film is just phenomenal.",1111449600,4,639,4.7657657657657655
1890019,5,B00009RG46,"Just to get this out of the way, Kill Bill's director did not make/direct this movie (for those who are unaware of this). I suppose you can say he simply presented this movie directed by Yimou Zhang to America. So about as far as I can say, ""HERO"" is a very beautifully done moive. It doesn't give away its plot away early in the movie, there are many twists that may confuse you and the acting is topnotch. The story goes like this: Je-Li's charater ""Nanmeless one"" comes to the king of Qin with the message of death concerning three deadly assasins bringing with him their weapons and thus, tells his story of how he klls them. But the king of Qin has doubts that he is telling the complete truth.

The fighting in this movie is the best I've since I've watched ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""; The simple retelling of Nameless one's story and the battles he part-takes in againsts the assassins are awsome save for one that concerns dancing across the water, that battle was hard for me to grasp. But when you boil it all down its actually a movie about Romance and revenge like most Chinise/Jpaanese movies placed in the fuedal era. The audio in the movie boils down to dobly digital 5.1 surround sound, with the choice of of English or Chinese among other languages.

But if your going to watch the movie in any kind of lanauge The orignal Chinese audio is the way to go. English dubs is still the hardest things for me to watch in any kind of movie that wasn't recorded in that lanauage. So to save yourself from any embarassing or agonizing choices . . . just pick the Chinese dailouge and activate the English subtitles. You'll enjoy the movie better that way. --- [a 5 out of 5]",1111104000,2,1688,4.441935483870968

1890021,5,B00009RG46,"I saw ""Hero"" twice on its opening weekend in the states, and made sure to purchase a copy as soon as it was legally available. That's how strongly the film affected me. I was prepared to like it because I'd seen and enjoyed many films the cast (especially Jet Li) starred in. Yet, I was surprised at how much I loved the film. The fight scenes are stunningly choreographed, the cinematography is beautifully surreal, and the film's moral is an Eastern message undiluted for Western consumption. No single actor or artist involved with this film can truly be singled out for praise; ""Hero"" is a group effort and uniformly good.

I won't discuss the plot, because I do not want to spoil any of this movie for anyone. Suffice to say, this is a serious movie set in Ancient China. Do not watch this DVD hoping for Jackie Chan-style hijinks or you will be disappointed. Despite its many excellent action sequences this is not a standard action movie - every act of violence in this film, no matter how stylized, has a purpose and a consequence. Coming at the end of a summer with one thinly disguised superhero movie masqueraded as an action film after another, ""Hero"" was the payoff I'd been waiting all summer to see.

The extras on the DVD are minimal but worthwhile. There's a short documentary, some storyboards, and the option to view the film in English or French rather than Mandarin Chinese. (Those of you who hate subtitles will appreciate this.) There's also a nice, short conversation between Jet Li and Quentin Tarantino. It was Tarantino who lent his name to the film so that Miramax could release ""Hero"" theatrically in the US and not dubbed, hacked, and direct-to-DVD. I'm no Tarantino fan, but after the good he did helping ""Hero"" find an American audience, I'd do him a favor anytime.",1110672000,3,1797,4.6835443037974684
1890022,5,B00009RG46,"Without a doubt, ""Hero"" was absolutely the finest movie of it's genre that I've ever experienced.  The filming locations in China were breathtaking providing for intense visual eye candy.  The panoramic cinematography was exquisite.  The beautifully crafted story was woven around masterfully choreographed martial arts and sword fighting sequences.

Jet Li playing the character Nameless, is an unquestioned nonpareil of martial arts skills.  He is the hero named in the movie title.  Before the creation of what we now know as China, the land was a conglomeration of 7 warring provinces.  The most powerful of which was called Qin.  The king of Qin possessed a vision of the unification of these provinces.  Of course this dream was not shared by all.

Li, born in the rival province of Zhao, was orphaned and adopted into a family in Qin.  Ten years of rigorous training honed him into the finest swordsman in all of the Qin province.  He had vanquished three of the most deadly assassins who had been plaguing the king of Qin, in order to gain his confidence.  His ultimate aspiration was to assassinate the king himself.  The three assassins known as Sky, Broken Sword and Snow, also martial arts experts helped structure Li's resolve to attain his goal.

This Quentin Tarantino sponsored martial arts masterpiece, expertly directed by Yimou Zhang, was both a powerful and sensually appealing cinematic experience.",1110499200,3,1419,5.108695652173913
1890023,2,B00009RG46,"This movie almost put me to sleep.  I felt like I had been in the theatre for 3 hours.  This style of movie making just doesn't work for me.  Yes,  the visuals were very good.  The music was fine, but after an hour it starts to wear on you.  The acting is quite good, though.  Ziyi Zhang is always great.  It's the directing I have the biggest problem with.  The transition from present to past is not done very well.  Sometimes you can't tell if you are watching a past event or a present one.  The endless fight scenes become tedious after a while.  There are many pointless, and long, scenes added in that have nothing to do with the plot.  For instance, do we really have to spend 15 minutes discussing the importance of Caligraphy in the fighting style of Broken Sword?  Five minutes would have been fine for me.  What was the point of Flying Snow killing Broken sword in one story and then fighting/killing Moon shortly afterwards?  None, nada.  It seems like half the scenes in the movie are filler like this.  Jet Li's character is a little disapointing.  Every fighter he goes against in this is better than he is.  Sky lets him win.  He can't beat Broken Sword or Flying Snow either.  The only character in the movie he can beat, supposedly, is the Emperor.  Shouldn't Jet Li be the dominant character?  Oh, well.  These are just a few things that bothered me.  Maybe I'm just too pragmatic for some Chinese, artsy, films.",1110240000,5,1432,4.453488372093023
1890024,5,B00009RG46,"This 2002 Chinese movie is an epic extravaganza in the best action film tradition.  It is much more than that, however, as it was conceived with a bigger purpose in mind.  It is not just about the swordplay.  It is about just what it takes to be a hero.  There are themes of love, vengeance and redemption as well as personal dramas inside of all the action.  This is the most expensive Chinese film ever made and I understand the Chinese army itself is cast as the extras.  It was filmed in a remote area of China where it was very windy.  And the scenes all reflect this.  For example there is one action scene with two women engaged in swordplay where golden leaves are blowing all around.

The plot seems simple at first.  A swordsman is being honored for conquering a king's enemies.  But as the story unfolds, it is much more complicated than that and we see the same story told over again from several different points of view.  Each time our understanding of it deepens.  And although it is not realistic and could never quite happen this way (especially the choreographed action scenes) the theme is universal even though the plot is a little hard to follow.

I have nothing but accolades for the people who brought this to America.  I understand that Quentin Tarantino was involved in this project.  He's seen in one of the extras on the DVD in an interview with the star, Jet Li.  There's also an excellent extra about the director, Zhang Yimou, which really enhanced my appreciation of the film I had just viewed and kept me up long after my bedtime just to relish every moment of it.

I loved this film and give it a high recommendation.  It might not be for everybody.  But those who appreciate the art of filmmaking and the complexity of ideas will love it.",1109980800,4,1772,4.478125

1890026,1,B00009RG46,"Just as I have had to ransack contemporary country music in search of good rock & roll, unable to find it elsewhere, so I have had in recent days to search among Chinese films to find something that touches the heart, for the same reason.  Most American films I see are filled with magnificently special-effected visuals, significant of nothing.

""Crouching Tigers"" was one such Chinese film I was touched by, odd this is to say about a martial arts movie.  But the two things needed to engage my feelings I found there:  compelling characters caught up in a compelling story.  When I heard tell that ""Hero"" was of that same ilk, only even better, I eagerly went.  My verdict:

Utterly uncompelling characters caught up in a presentation so narratively disjointed as not even to qualify as a story.  Why was who doing what to whom?  Who's side were we supposed to be on?  Were impending or anticipatable events to be welcomed and cheered along or dreaded and resisted?  Don't ask this mess, just blink at all the pretty, meaningless images blurring by.

This thing is not a movie but a coffee-table book to be brusquely, unthinkingly riffled.  If someone wants to argue that it consists of not just pretty but of artful images, I will not contest the point; if they want to call it a film, I very much will.",1108944000,13,1307,4.606060606060606

1890028,5,B00009RG46,"'Hero' is easily the best film released (at least in the West) last year. It rises far, far beyond the impressive standard set by 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and leaves one inspired and awed. Set against the backdrop of some of the most important moments in human history it combines a sweeping, epic scope with a layered plot full of suprises and twists. But most of all the story of 'Hero' is almost secondary - ultimately it is only the chosen medium for explaining an ideal, a philosophy. It shows how the individual is irrelevant when compared to humanity as a whole and advocates selflessness and sacrifice for a greater cause than any few people's emotions and desires. It is a noble ideal, told in the most spectacular fashion immaginable.",1108771200,9,752,4.792307692307692
1890029,3,B00009RG46,"The special effects, the cinematography, and the sound are exceptional in this movie. The fight scenes, as they are in all martial arts movies of this type, are highly choreographed. Some of them could be executed in the real world, but others have never been observed, and no doubt supposed to exemplify the ancient mythology of Chinese ""inner strength"". Physical laws are to be ignored in these scenes, as such realism would be contrary to the purpose of the movie: to glorify human conflict and smooth over its horrors. Mythology and an exaggerated sense of purpose are what cause many to willingly participate in activities that are to their detriment. It is difficult to face death without a banner or set of symbols, or a promise of heavenly rewards. But the momentum of real arrows is not deflected by fanciful choreography. They draw blood regardless of the wishes of their targets. No amount of mental concentration will deflect their parabolic trajectories. In real battle, gravity cannot be defied as it is in the elaborate bodily movements of this film. Gravity is democratic in pulling all down whose hearts are pierced with an arrow. So are there heroes on both sides of a conflict as claimed in the beginning notes of the movie? Not likely, as war should be viewed as a necessity, as a last resort, and is never to be glorified or elevated. It is by far the worst activity humans can indulge themselves in, and if there are real heroes, it is those who bring war to an end.

Due to its rising importance in the modern world, it is now imperative to undertake a thorough and exhaustive study of Chinese history, to learn the Chinese language, and to understand Chinese philosophy and Chinese cultural traditions, especially how the latter influences business decisions. This film brings up a few ideas that seem to conflict with some of the Western viewpoints of Chinese culture and history. For example, Chinese women in this film are portrayed as strong and independent, and as formidable warriors. Is this the way they are viewed in China? Or is it more accurate to view them as the foot-bound maidservants as they have been typically portrayed in the West? In addition, the cultures of the West are led to believe that the Chinese are a contemplative people. The philosophy of Confucius for example is presented as one that reinforces this view. A large degree of profundity is imputed to his analects. Only a rigorous study of Chinese history will allow one to make conclusions on his influence. If it is indeed a philosophy of contemplation and pacifism it is certainly not apparent in this film. The film therefore could be viewed as inspiration for obtaining a true understanding of the Chinese people and their belief structures, not as it is portrayed in movies, but how it really is, without masks and without exaggerations. Such a project is a challenging one, but well worth the effort and time.",1108771200,4,2922,4.820717131474104
1890030,3,B00009RG46,"The most startling thing about this movie is not the fact that it is a blend of an art-house drama and a rollicking kung fu movie, but that it so strongly promotes Chinese nationalism. Director Yimou stated that he wanted to make a modern myth for China, and boy did he ever. Beware of spoilers in the next few sentences: the plotline essentially justifies the violent imperialism of the king of Qin during China's warring states period. For example, we see the king's armies attacking a city with complete disregard as to who they kill, innocent civilians included. The ""hero"" of the story is attempting to assassinate the king, whose forces murdered his family. But in the end he has a change of heart. He realizes that the greater good is the good of the whole land, and lets the king live, since it is he and he only who can unite the warring kingdoms. Bring on the invasion of Taiwan! As a kung fu movie goes, it stands well above average in the capable hands of Yimou. The way he permeates each scene with a single color enhances the drama unfolding between the various characters, and of course the fight scenes are like nothing you've ever seen. It's not a bad way to spend an hour and a half, but Hero is far inferior to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.",1108771200,2,1261,4.48695652173913
1890031,3,B00009RG46,"Set in what we know today as China but about 2000 years ago Hero is told in several sections and gets kind of confusing at times. Apparently the king of Qin, one of six sections of the future China, has been troubled for years by three assassins. One day a nameless man (Jet Li) comes in and tells the tale of how he has defeated the King's enemies. The king listens and then tells him that wasn't the way it was , it was this way and proceeds to tell the story a different way (in his version apparently only one of the killers is apparently dead and Li is working with the other two). Both versions use flashbacks and a lot of detail & locations as well as a predominating color in each story's segments.

It was very interesting to look at, I loved a lot of the details but found the use of color distracting.

1890032,5,B00009RG46,"I came to ""Hero"" expecting to see a critically acclaimed martial arts film. My attitude toward martial arts films might best be described as indifferent. I like some of them, but I'm not an enthusiastic fan. I only had to see the first few minutes of ""Hero"" to know that it was something special, though. The art direction and cinematography are so striking in the opening scene that I consciously thought that this film would be worth watching whether or not the story, characters, or fight sequences interested me. By the first sword fight, I was entranced by the film's beauty. When I saw the red and orange hues that followed, I thought ""Hero"" might be the most beautiful motion picture I have ever seen. And that was only the beginning. Director Zhang Yimou is one of the best directors in the world today...at making emotionally incisive, understated dramas. ""Hero"" is Zhang's first action film and, I think, his masterpiece. His characteristic depth and social insight are combined with the energy, history, and flexibility of the martial arts genre in ""Hero"". The result is larger than life story and characters in a film of uncommon beauty. Zhang has said that the audience will remember the images of ""Hero"" even if we forget the story. To say that he is right would be understating ""Hero""'s visual impact. This may be the most beautiful film ever made, thanks in no small part to cinematography by Christopher Doyle and art direction by Huo Ting Xiao.

""Hero"" is a fable that takes place two millennia ago, during the era of warring states just before China was unified under its first Emperor. Qin is one of China's 7 states, and its King's sole ambition is to unite China under one rule. The Qin army's constant attacks on the 6 other kingdoms have made the King many enemies, however. Three assassins from Zhao have harassed the King for a decade, and he has promised riches and an audience to whomever defeats them. The reward is claimed by a Nameless (Jet Li) prefect, who arrives at the Court for his audience with the King. The King asks Nameless how he defeated the 3 great assassins: Sky, Flying Snow, and Broken Sword. So Nameless begins to tell the story of his battle with Sky (Donnie Yen), who visited his district, and his clever manipulation of Snow (Maggie Cheung Man-Yuk) and Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu-Wai) at the calligraphy school where they both studied.

Many of ""Hero""'s scenes have prominent color elements -red, blue, white, or green- depending on who is telling the story and why. The cinematography has to be seen to be believed. The fight sequences were choreographed by Hong Kong action director Tony Ching Siu-Tung. And martial arts fans will be pleased to see Jet Li and Donnie Yen reunited onscreen. The sword fighting sequences don't propel the story, however. They are well-integrated with the narrative and character development. And like everything else in ""Hero"", they are absolutely beautiful. You don't have to care for action or martial arts movies to enjoy ""Hero"". This is just a great film by any standard. 2000's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" was the first Asian film to find a wide American audience. Its US box office was more than twice that of ""Hero"". I attribute that to hype. ""Crouching Tiger"" is a good genre film, but ""Hero"" is far superior. If you liked ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", you'll love ""Hero"". If you were underwhelmed by  ""Crouching Tiger"", you'll be overwhelmed by this film. Congratulations to Zhang Yimou for making a masterpiece that will be praised for generations. Don't be put off if you don't normally like martial arts movies. This is a sweeping drama that is punctuated by action. See ""Hero"" on the biggest screen you can find.

The DVD: Bonus features include a making-of documentary, storyboards, an interview with Jet Li, and a soundtrack spot. ""Hero Defined"" (23 minutes) is alternately narrated and subtitled in English. It follows ""Hero"" from pre-production through some of its 6-month shoot and includes interviews with director Zhang Yimou and the film's cast. I recommend it for Zhang's comments. ""Storyboards"" shows the storyboards for 4 action scenes next to the finished scene as it plays out. In ""Inside the Action: A Conversation with Quentin Tarantino & Jet Li"" (14 minutes), Tarantino interviews Jet Li about his career and martial arts in the movies. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish. Captioning is available in English. Dubbing is available in English and French.",1107993600,5,4502,4.911957950065703

Hero tells the disjointed tale of a nameless warrior who is granted an audience with the future ruler of China.  The warrior claims to have vanquished three assassins who have plagued the royal household for years.  Through a variety of flashbacks we view the different angles of the story as told to the King until it is completely at odds with what was originally expected.  Compared to Crouching Tiger this film lacks the epic scope and humanistic sweep.  It tries too hard to be attractive.  There are moments of sumptuous beauty as the fights are framed and CG effects are poured in.  The wire work is great and the color palettes change in dramatic fashion with the combatants.  The film asks the viewer to make a lot of logical jumps for the purpose of plot advancement, and to embrace fully its eventual coda.

Told Roshomon-style, the same story is retold during the course of the film from four different point of views. Our Hero (Jet Li) is telling the emperor of China how he was able to defeat the four great assassin's that threatened the emperor's life. But as the story moves along, we soon realize that what we see and hear might not be what truly happened, and that Li might also have a hidden agenda.

The film is just amazing to look at. The colors are rich and breathtaking. The action sequences are filmed beautifully (American filmmakers take note : a great action sequence is one where you actually see what happens, not one where the editing is so fast and choppy that you can't register anything!). The performances are solid (especially from Ziyi Zhang and Li) and the story very touching.

This is a martial arts flick with a heart and soul. Based on historical events, Hero will surprise you at every turn. This one has taken a place in my all-time top 10 fave action flicks. Don't miss out on it.",1107734400,3,1233,4.595454545454546

It is every bit as good as ""Crouching Tiger"".  The scenery is beautiful and is shot on location in China.  Yimou Zhang has done a remarkable job with both the colors and the choreography for the fight scenes.  The film is just plain beautiful to look at not to mention the action.  The action is actually better than ""Crouching Tiger"".  This is just a remarkable film.

The story is about a Hero called ""nameless"" protecting the Emperor of China from a band of assasins.  Jet Li plays the Hero and he tells the story of the duels with the assasins.  To tell any more that this will ruin the movie for you.  Just let it be said that there is much more than just what I told you here.  There is also the usual extras with the DVD and it is a mini documentary on the film and what the crew tried to do.  That is whorth the price alone.",1107129600,5,1227,4.13135593220339
1890036,5,B00009RG46,"A movie of this complexity really cannot be described without the reviewer sounding like they think they are the next world famous movie critic.  Plus, a movie of this calibur is tough to review without becoming too verbose.  That being said, I do not fashion myself a movie critic by any means, and I will try to keep my review concise.

Summary? This movie is nothing less than a masterpiece.

I stumbled upon this movie quite accidentially.  However, I am certainly glad I did.  It is a simple story which is masterfully and flawlessly told.  It unfolds before you like a carefully crafted series of chess moves, is very entertaining and engaging, and has a few twists along the way.

A point that must be made is that this is not a ""kung-fu"" movie.  It has action scenes that will please any martial arts fan, but this movie is so much more.

Although I preferred the musical score of Crouching Tiger to Hero (it seemed as if Hero's music was heavily influenced by Crouching Tiger), the score is very enjoyable and perfectly suited to the movie.

What can I say about the other major components?  Set design and shooting locations were almost flawless and in most cases absolutely stunning.  It struck me that maybe Crouching Tiger's (ok, so I'm a big fan) outdoor lighting (effective use of time of day) may have been more dramatic than Hero, but Hero is still far and away better than virtually any other movie you are likely to have seen.

One of the main things this movie does more than any other movie I can recall was the effective use of color in costume and sets.  Whoever thought of this and chose the actual color pallet (sp?) is no less than brilliant.  It really is a visually beautiful movie.

This is one of the best movies I've ever seen at any and all levels.  It's really not surprising that it's not a Hollywood original.  I don't think they make them like this anymore.

Is this Communist propaganda like some have summized?  I believe you need to view this film in it's historical perspective.  Come on people!  What was the set of ideals driving this part of the world during the era of the film?  I believe it was one of self-sacrific and honor to the greater good.  You don't necessarily have to agree with these principles to enjoy this movie!  As a matter of fact, there are a couple of scenes (won't reveal them here) that on a personal level I certainly objected to.  However, the characters actions were much like I would assume given their philosophies displayed.

Conclusion?  You won't know what you're missing until you watch it.  After you watch it, you will be forever glad you did.",1107129600,4,2621,4.562231759656652

This one offers more than most. It describes a set of encounters between Nameless, the Hero, and assassins that had tried to take down the empire-building king. In a unique bit of visual story-telling, it goes over those encounters again and again. Each telling is changed by a different bit of spin-doctoring, to the point that the viewer may give up all hope of knowing the truth (whatever that means) of the original encounters. This could have been very confusing, except that each telling is color-coded. By themselves, the tinted stories are visually appealing. As a set they work very nicely. The one constant through all but the first interlude is Moon, loyal retainer to one of the assassins.

Good action/adventure with a little more depth than a comparable movie from the West, and people generally keep their clothes on. The good guy wins in the end, but you'll have to find out for yourself what that means.

1890041,3,B00009RG46,"Hero is a beautiful film. The saturated color of the costumes,autumn leaves, mountain lakes, painted deserts and palaces was superb. The martial arts scenes were amazingly directed, best described as surreal ballet in fast motion.

The plot is interesting, changing direction three times, and thus keeping the viewers on their toes. The story is related first through the eyes of Jet Li, an assassin acting like a provincial officer. His story of the deaths of three assassins certainly has internal consistency. However the Emperor is too wise to fall for a coherent story. The Emperor then relates his suspected version of the deaths of the 3 assassins. The Emperor's story unmasks Jet Li, but the plot takes one last twist as Jet Li tell the third variation of the complicated dance of revenge, attraction, rage, and trust.

The film left me very disturbed however in that the underlying philosophy is that the stability of the state, even a state created by a blood thirsty tyrant, is of such value that individuals must sacrifice their lives for the unity of China. Whereas this concept may be acceptable in China where the authority of the state must be preserved at all costs, is far different from the political philosophy of the United States where citizens can rebel and react against tyranny.

The film is beautiful but in the end it is a creature of another culture and political philosophy from our own.",1106438400,4,1416,4.891666666666667
1890042,5,B00009RG46,"This is a great movie as it works on two levels. It is a well directed martial arts film with visual poetry on the order of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It is also a work of fascist propaganda with displays of visual grandeur that emulates and ultimately exceeds Triumph of The Will. Hero's vast imperial sets, its glorification of ruthless leadership and self-sacrifice on the altar of national greatness, are pages out of the fascist playbook.

I enjoyed the very subtle way the propaganda was put into this film. It was expertly done. The story of this film is that the Hero ""Nameless"", although he wants to kill the Emperor, doesn't. He realizes that the Emperor's wars of conquest are necessary to unite China. That the Emperors wars, which destroyed Nameless' family, are a necessary step to bring unity and ultimate peace to China. That's the exact same attitude of the Chinese Communist Party: You may not like us, you may want to get rid of us, but we're the ones who keep China stable and peaceful, so don't touch us. Although it has a historical setting, the message is modern, it is a prequel to the invasion of Taiwan and the forceful reunification of China.

The visual poetry is second to none. The battle scene in which the character Flying Snow fights and defeats Moon in a backdrop of golden falling leaves is one of the most effective martial arts scenes ever filmed. The leaves turn red when Moon is mortally wounded. The scenes of the endless armies of the emperor with their banners waving is out of Riefenstahls playbook, but is done even better. Words don't do justice to the cinematography here. Definitely a must see.",1106438400,3,1646,4.711805555555555

The martial arts action was very exciting to watch. A nice blend between Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Matrix. But what really amazed me were all the colors and visual effects incorporated into the film that made it really stand out among all the others I've seen.

The plot can be a little complex for some to understand, but without giving too much away basically it is three different versions of the same story. The first version is told by the ""hero"" of the movie played by Jet Li. The second version is told by the Emperor who has summoned the ""hero"" to bestow upon him a reward for certain deeds accomplished. The third version is once again told by Jet Li's character. All three versions of this story are different, and in all three stories the same characters are dressed very differently to add even more distinction to them.

While the computer animation at times looks a little on the cheesy side, the rest of the action of the film makes up for it and is beautiful to watch. Filled with incredible images, cinematography, and martial arts, Hero delivers on many different levels.",1106352000,,1326,4.516666666666667
1890044,3,B00009RG46,"After reading some of these reviews I was not sure I saw the same film.  As far as the politics and history of the movie are concerned, it is irrelevant.  At that time of civilization most of the earth was in conflict.  I believe this movie was intended to show the transformation of Nameless as a bitter assasin driven by human rage to a man of ideals.  No more no less.  I have read about some of the ancient history of China and it is as complicated as complicated can get.

This movie compares with Gone With the Wind as an historically based novel.  Just like Gone With the Wind we see character transformation instigated from the outside events.  Don't get me wrong, Gone With the Wind has no comparison in its genre.

I would have given this 3 and 1/2 stars but as you all know that is not a choice.  I recommend this movie as a good movie but not as a history or idealistic movie.  Jet Li is a good actor.",1106352000,,913,4.189655172413793

Like Crouching Tiger, Hero is based in the Warring States Era of Chinese history--the time of Sun Tzu, about 300 BC.  The Warring States Era established the Chin Dynasty, and the roots of modern China start here.  So, by comparison, the Warring States tales are similar to American Wild West stories.

A tale of intrigue, the story twists, turns, and never stales.  A mysterious swordsman claims to have eliminated three legendary assassins... but the wise king senses something not quite right.  After Nameless, the swordsman, tells his story, the king tells his story.  Then, there's the Truth... The movie uses different colors to tell each person's viewpoint, and it makes the story very cool!

There is a bit of a spoiler here, but kind of needed for the review.  If you hate spoilers, skip to the next review.

On the plus side, the cinematography is outstanding.  The movie is gorgeous.  The art direction is fantastic.  The actors give some of their best performances.

On the mixed side...  The soundtrack is by Tan Dun, which would be a plus, except it sounds far to similar to Crouching Tiger.  It is still good, but seems far to familiar.

On the negative side...  One of the reviewers compared the movie to ""Communist Progaganda"".  He has a point.  The main message of the movie seems to be that citizens have the duty to die for the state in order to insure its survival.  (Because to fight the state would cause chaos and that is worse than death.)  I disagree very strongly with any philosophy that puts the life of the state above that of its citizens.  I can understand it, given the handover of Hong Kong to mainland China.  It is still a very strong negative for me.

Still, it is a very good movie mared by a philisophically repugnant ending.  But if you are a fan of Chinese cinema, you still need to see it, warts and all.  It is still an impressive film.",1106352000,4,1238,4.3464912280701755

For his reward he is offered the chance to sit with the King and tell the stories of how he managed to kill the skilled warriors Sky, Broken Sword, and Falling Snow.

It is a death that seems coordinated by these elegant players in a most beauteous and macabre fashion. The film, visually, is a work of art. The choreographed sword fighting scenes are reminiscent of dance steps at times, and the wire work is well timed and utilized in a way attractive to the eye. The effects are stunning as well. Periodically the characters use the elements to their disposal to fight against their opponents. Wind, water, earth, and fire are present throughout all of the film, many acting as weapons in the fight scenes.

What I found most interesting was that the colours changed as different characters related the events in their own perceptions. When the nameless warrior spoke in the beginning the colour tones were warm crimsons, vermilions, opera pink, and golden. When the King told his impressions the colours changed  to a cold colour scheme, that of cyan, aqua, violet, and grays. Even when the character Sky revealed his thoughts the colours shifted again to citron and soft greens.  The rest of the film was resplendent in monotones, whites and earth tones, grays and black.

The cinematagrophy for the movie as well as the choreography for the fight scenes are just mesmorizing(very Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon-esque). I like how it is at least somewhat based on Historical events, with the first Chinese Emperor Shih Huang-ti playing a prominent role.  Along with this were small details like when Jet-li's character pays the blind musician he uses pieces of bronze(I think they were axe heads or something like that) that were really used for money in ancient China(or at least convincing replicas)!!

1890051,5,B00009RG46,"I don't know where to begin with Hero, in all honesty.  When I walked into the theatre to see Hero, I was thinking two things:  1) This movie is going to be awesome, and 2) I hope it shows some sort of individuality (critics said it was too similar to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon).  Hero delivered on both of those notes.  I can't stress enough that the point of the movie is not to show people flying around and shielding arrows with silk dresses, that is just part of the overall effect.  The point of the movie is 'visual poetry'.  If you could imagine watching your favorite poem, it would be in the form of Hero.

Beside that, the movie itself is absolutely amazing.  The fight scenes will leave you breathless.  There is not a moment when you will ask yourself ""Why did the director do that?""  Some memorable fight scenes are:  'The Fabricated Showdown' between Nameless and Sky, 'Falling Leaves' between Snow and Moon, 'Green Sheets' between Broken Sword and the King, 'Walking on Water' between Nameless and Broken Sword, and 'Library Encounter' between Nameless and Snow against Broken Sword and Moon.  Each of these scenes encorporates a different color into it to show the emotions in the fighters.  For example, 'Green Sheets' is represented by green, displaying the greed and selfishness of Broken Sword.  'Falling Leaves' is represented by orange for rage, followed by the transition to red, representing the lust and love both women had for Broken Sword.

The plot is very simple yet very powerful:  a Qin warrior who goes by Nameless has recently killed the three most feared assassins in all of China:  Sky, Broken Sword, and Snow.  As a reward, the King invites Nameless to drink within ten feet of him, the closest anyone has been allowed to come within the king since the assassination attempt on him three years before.  While Nameless recalls the story of how he was able to kill the three assassins as so many tried to do previously, the king devises his own theory as to what really happened.  When the truth comes out, it seems as if nobody is safe, not even those who have died.

Hero is an action packed thrill ride, but ultimately it recalls the unbreakable love between man and country.  Through tragedies and thriumphs, intimacy and heartbreak, the love from each of the characters can be seen to that of ""Our Land"".",1105574400,,2349,4.705882352941177

I believe this is where the cultural gap came into play. It is often difficult to translate select elements and dialogues of an Asian film in a manner that Western audience would understand. (Try reading a book of traditional chinese poetry translated into English! Yikes!)

The subtitles for this film have done a decent job doing this. Still many things don't appear crystal clear. I highly recommend watching this movie twice before you complain of its plot problems.

Also, I have read quite a few reviews criticizing the scenes of fighting on bamboo and on top of the water in both this movie and Crouching. I would like to add that these are very traditional fighting sequences in Chinese Kung-Fu movies. Supposedly they demonstrate the power of a warrior's Kung to step atop anything, even ridiculously soft and yielding substances.

It may not appeal to your logic (why on earth would they fight atop trees when they can do it on the ground?), nevertheless, it is an essential element that allevates the magic power of Kung-Fu masters as presented on films. You really are missing the point if you are fussing over the logical explaination behind these scnes, for much of Kung-Fu is defying our logical perception of physical limitations.",1105315200,11,1458,4.91869918699187

1890056,4,B00009RG46,"This movie takes place around the time of Chinese unification, where many provinces were forced through war to come together.  Loosely based on a story from around that time, a Nameless warrior played by Jet Li slays three enemies of the state and presents their swords to the emperor.  Narrated by the Emperor of Qin (strongest emperor of pre-Modern China) and Nameless, the plot is based around Nameless's three fights.  However, simplicity is thrown out as the Emperor questions to see if that is Nameless's true motive.

The story plays in a decently complex fashion as we travel with the words of Nameless or the Emperor to events that either were or might have been depending on Nameless's honesty.  However, at heart there is more to this story than just that, because each of Nameless's adventures (real or unreal) tell tales of sacrifice and love, for people and for nations.

The usage of colors was spectacular and made the fight scenes that much more beautiful.  The only lack luster component of the film to me is that now almost all of the fighting seems like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" all over again.  That was novel then, but not so novel now.

Overall though, I still really appreciated the story.  I especially found it fascinating how the story wound around Nameless's intentions for seeing the Emperor.

That is still a strong component though and whether you liked the movie or not it is still important to acknowledge the underlying them of patriotism for China.)",1105056000,7,1607,4.824817518248175

Are the assassins ruthless, cold murders? Or metaphysical poets of calligraphy and swordplay? A second viewing is required to absorb the subtleties of the portrayals.

The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. Each scene is saturated in a particular hue -- crimson, emerald, gold -- requiring an artist's palette to keep track of the color changes. The Chinese scenery is almost mythical in its beauty. The acting is alternately taut -- with movement kept to an absolute minimum -- and expansive, as in the many fight scenes.

""Hero"" is a movie of visual poetry, martial valor and physical tension. Though the use of wires in martial arts movies is now familiar to the point of clich, their use in this film was astoundingly complex. The locations are extraordinary -- from a miraculously still lake to an autumn whirlwind of golden falling leaves.

1890061,5,B00009RG46,"I object to the ""Crouching Tiger"" comparisons.  Treating violence as ballet is more suitably attributable to Sam Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch"" or 1939's ""Jesse James"" or even ""The Matrix"", all of which treated the action that way.  The dramatic beauty and color palette are more attributable to ""The Scarlett Empress"" and ""Lost Horizon"".  If ""Hero"" and ""Crouching Tiger"" have anything in common, it is that they both serve their purposes, and this means they have nothing in common.  They have one supporting actress in both films, and the same music composer.  Perhaps the director knew what he wanted to stay away from when dealing with his first martial arts film: namely, typical martial arts films.  Aside from that, the two are completely different, and ""Hero"" is a better film.  ""Crouching Tiger"" surprised many people with it's ""Disney-esque"" or ""Wizard Of Oz"" fantasy plot and visuals, but ""Hero"" defines the understanding of the secret developments of real warriors.

  The truth of ""Hero"" comes through the balletic violence.  The film is more about what causes a development within a soldier through an act of non-violence.  In a way, the balletic violence is no different from the other love scenes in the movie.  Really, the film is not a film with mindless violence, (like most martial arts films.)  It is a film about ending war by submitting oneself to ideals above the lines on a map regardless of death, when death serves peace or love.  Would you not welcome death if it served love?  What is the purpose for war?  This is a good movie, above the average intelligence.",1104710400,6,1587,4.906015037593985
1890062,3,B00009RG46,"""Hero"" marks the second release of a mega-budget Chinese martial arts fantasy film (as the genre is commonly known) in the U.S. since ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".  It has been riding high on its predecessor's successes, and those who liked ""Crouching Tiger"" will find this film to be equally appealing.  But it's worth noting that ""Hero"" is an unique film in itself, in that it's the first such film released in the U.S. who dares to carry a political message.

Boasting an all star cast of Tony Leung Chiu Wai, Maggie Cheung, Zhang Ziyi and Jet Li*, director Zhang Yimou (""Raising the Red Lantern"", ""The Road Home"") undertakes the project of making a multi-million dollar martial arts fantasy film for the first time in his career.  It becomes apparent during the film that Zhang is not only concerned with the choreographic beauty of martial arts action, but also wanted to make a film that superimposes several elements of cinematic aesthetics.  He notably takes inspiration from several other works.  The action sequences are no doubt similar to that in ""Crouching Tiger"".  The use of different colors corresponding with different scenes in the film, in the effort to convey certain moods, is an obvious tribute to Akira Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"": There's a scene where the two leading female characters duel in red silk robes in a forest, as they fight, all the leaves falling from the trees and on the ground begin to turn red.  One could even say that some of the grand scale fighting scenes and computer generated graphics are Zhang's response to American productions like ""Lord of the Ring"" and ""The Matrix"".

The movie's story is somewhat superficial in its execution, but manages to stay on target with the message of how we define a hero.  In the film, Jet Li's character ultimately sacrifices his personal aims for the greater good --- the unity of the Chinese nation.  I have to give Zhang credit for daring to inject into his film a political message that's not easily accessible to everyone, especially the American audience.  In the end, I nonetheless found the film to be visually stunning, as it makes very good use of China's beautiful natural landscapes, combined with richly colored photography.

Where the film falls short is on the overall strengh of the cast's acting.  But this is partly the director's doing.  Zhang never bothered to delved too deep into his characters, and preferred to have them do the talking by moving gracefully or sitting silently in beautiful color-matching robes most of the time.  The acting, when there is any, tends to be overly melodramatic, and even pretentious at times.  The film is also a bit inauthentic in its obvious nods to ""Crouching Tiger"": Some of the action sequences and techniques are too similar.  And also the music, because Zhang had actually gone as far as hiring the same composer from ""Crouching Tiger"" to compose the music for ""Hero"", and this fellow ended up giving us almost a duplicate score.

Aside from its lack of authenticiy in certain areas, done so mainly to please the identified tastes of a foreign audience, ""Hero"" remains an interesting piece of work by director Zhang, both visually and plot wise.  For a contrast in plot and character studies, check out his new martial arts fantasy release, ""House of Flying Daggers"" (also starring Zhang Ziyi), due out in the U.S. in December 2004.

And although there are lots of martial arts sword fights, everything is -- don't be scared off by this -- poetically portrayed with simple dialog and deep feeling. Despite all the fighting, there aren't a lot of huge blood spurts and cruel closeups, but there is a memorable love story and a great historical perspective. The violence exists to serve a point -- revealed late in the film. There are some scenes in this movie that will stay with me forever, such as the battles above a still lake and in a forest of yellow leaves.

1890066,5,B00009RG46,"I shall avoid the repetitive plot retellings and focus on what worked for me.

1.  I found the use of different color pallettes for different scenes breathtaking.  It helped to convey mood and set the scene.  Not something we see a lot of in Western cinema.  Innovative, original, and worked very well to move the story along and set each scene.  It was almost as if the colors became characters in the film.

2.  The fight scenes were very well-choreographed, but not the meat of the film.  The characters interacted with the world around them wonderfully.  The scenes on the lake and in the forest with the leaves were excellent.  Also watch the Jet Li/Maggie Cheung arrow scene.  The ability of both actors to move the way they do (accepting that wires were involved, I'm not totally naive) is flawless.  I still command Maggie Cheung and Ziyi Zhang; for non-martial artists, they can move as a fighter very well.

3.  Speaking of actors, I cannot fault any of them.  An all-star cast without a doubt.  I love Maggie Cheung, and it is obvious that Jet Li makes better Asian films than American films; for some reason, American filmmakers cannot get past the ""hack and slash"" martial arts film.  Asian filmmakers can, and they really showcase Jet Li's depth.  The acting alone could make this a five star film.

4.  The ability of the crew and writers to put different spins and subtle nuances on each version of the story was a high point of the film.  While the non-linear storytelling had the potential to be distracting, and on a certain level was the first time around, the writing, cinematography, and acting made each version different, unique and it's own.

Ok, the beef:  Tarantino needs to leave his hands off these films.  Period.  I have the original Chinese Special Edition, and although even the menu is in Chinese and I have to guess how to turn on the English subtitles, I find it to be a far superior film.  The subtitling was better, there was about 10 minutes of extra footage.  Little things, but they made a difference, especially by the end of the film where the Nameless has to make his decision.  Especially the subtitles.

One other issue I want to address. A number of reviewers have complained about this being a ""propaganda piece"".  All I can say is ""so what if it is?""  It is also a visually stunning film with a great deal of emotional depth.  American cinema can only hope to be this good!

Oh, I lied.  One last issue.  If you're thinking this is just another ""chop-sockey"" flick, please read the reviews (and the dvd box) before complaining that it isn't.  By now, unless you've been living under a rock, you should know there's more to this than just a few good fight scenes.",1104364800,10,2711,4.596234309623431

C) A few of the early fight scenes were good.  Most of the others, again, relied too much on slow-mo!

D) Some of the large army scenes were too CGI'd for me.  You don't even have to look closely to see that the people are duplicated.

E) Each time a character in the movie is stabbed, they show the victim's face and you hear the sword go in.  EVERY SINGLE TIME- How trite!

I thought the cinematography was beautiful.  i also may have a new favorite movie director.  this fact is noted in other reviews, but i'd like to clarify that the visual beauty is in no way gratuitous, but is integral to shape of the movie, much like in the movie Amelie, and a few other foreign films.  the way all the seperate elements in this movie were so meaningful to the shape of the whole is most impressive, and is seen in an american movie maybe once a decade.
the storyline, being the attempt on the first chinese emperor's life, is based in history, and there are in fact many chinese movies that deal with this.  however, the story is not (of course) to be taken literally, but is a vehicle for the authors inquiry into what constitutes nobility, what is the essence of virtue, what is loyalty, and the truly difficult and complex task of determining where your loyalty ultimately lies.  There's an interview with Jet Li on the dvd in which he states that he's been waiting for a roll like this for a very long time.  All the main characters are heroes in a sense, and the director lets none of them off the hook in the decisions they must make.  this is not remotely similar to the american definition of hero, which is basically just a ""good"" guy who kills all the ""bad"" guys and gets to fornicate with a invariably beautiful damsel in distress along the way a la the american version of a ""love"" story.  this is relatively heavy moral stuff.  luckily, due to the skill of all those involved in making this movie, it is not a burden, but a joy to watch.  once it starts, you won't be able to turn away from the screen.
there is some action, (the most visually stunning scenes by far,) but it is neither gratuitous nor overly abundant.  it resides in the mythical realm of spirit and dream, and deepens the impact of the whole movie.  if you want a whole package experience, i definitely recommend this.  if you want to watch an ultra-cool, ultra-macho comic book hero (minus the depth of character present in a comic book,) mindlessly slash nameless villians to a meaningless dance track, while single-handedly keeping the leather industry in buisness, watch a Blade mov",1104019200,5,2388,4.562060889929742
1890070,2,B00009RG46,"I liked Crouching Tiger a lot and thought that this movie might be along the same vein but was very disappointed. Although the action scenes were nice it gradually dawned on me that this movie is in fact a Chinese propaganda film. I am not sure whether it was the:

- Excessive use of red (which incidentally is the color of the Chinese flag and signifies the revolution)

- The various dialogs suggesting that assassins should desist since the emperor is trying to unite the country. Could this possibly suggest that the freedom fighters should desist so that the communist government can unite the country such that peace can prevail - I think so! I wonder what the people of Tibet think about the peace brought to them by the land grabbing activities of the People's Republic of China. Trust me, if you have lived in any country that has shared a border with China you know about the underhanded techniques the Chinese government uses to acquire as much land as it can.

- The fact that the ""Hero"" was sacrificed in the end for the greater good of the empire; not unlike the many innocents that have been sacrificed along the way for the greater good of the modern day People's Republic of China

What is really sad however, is the fact that the makers of this film were able to market this film as a somewhat mainstream action film all the while feeding western audiences Chinese propaganda.

1890072,5,B00009RG46,"This review is based on the Chinese version DVD, with English subtitles.

This is a great movie based on a true event, one of the most famous assassination attempts on Qin Shihuangdi (pronounced ""chin shr-hwang-dee""), the first emperor of China. When the story starts, a warrior referred to as Nameless is being rewarded for killing three of the most wanted assassins. What they don't tell you in the movie is that Qin Shihuangdi was afraid of death, and he hired alchemists to create the Elixir of Life so he can live forever. So as his first reward, he gets to drink within 20 paces of Qin Shihuangdi (normally the people are only allowed within 100 paces of him.) The first half of the story is Nameless telling Qin Shihuangdi his story of how he killed the three assassins, Sky, Broken Sword, and Flying Sword. After he tells his story, the emperor tells his side of the story, where he throws an interesting twist into it.

According to my East Asian History teacher, this film is historically accurate. The film portrays the ancient Chinese ideals of Confucianism, Legalism, and qi (pronounced ""chee"") energy, among others. (Note: yes, they are supposed to look like they are flying, that is supposed to represent qi energy.)

The plot of the film is great, and I was kept in suspense throughout the two stories, and afterwards. The special effects are nothing to write home about (again, the movie is trying to be realistic), but they add great effect to the movie.

1890078,4,B00009RG46,"Hero is several things at once: it is a mythical story of the unification of Japan; it is a wuxia martial arts film; it is a suspense mystery.

It is not, really, an ""authoritarian"" film, at least in my view. It is a story of hard moral decisions made under almost unbearable pressure.  And it is one of the most beautifully filmed movies I've seen in years. It's well worth watching.

This review will contain CONSIDERABLE spoilers for the film, so stop here if you don't want any more detail.

The story takes place in the distant past of China, when it was divided into six fractious kingdoms; in this particular era, the Emperor of Qin is seeking to conquer all six and become ruler of the entire country. The framing story of Hero is the arrival of a nameless warrior who claims to have killed the three superhuman assassins that have sought the Emperor's life for ten years. For ten years, none have approached closer to the Emperor than a hundred paces. As a reward for each assassin he has bested, the hero is seated progressively closer to the Emperor and invited to drink with him; over drinks, he tells the story of how he defeated each of these assassins, any one of whom could have killed him.

  Except that none of the stories are precisely true, and the Emperor deduces that in fact the ""hero"" is a fourth, even more deadly, assassin. He then tells HIS version of what he believed happened, and how. The nameless hero then admits he is indeed there to kill the Emperor, and we arrive at both conversing over the true version of events (which is neither the hero's first clever story, nor the Emperor's deduction), before the final denoument.

  Those who have read either other reviews or even this one carefully can guess that the Emperor survives -- the assassin does not kill him, and dies for that choice. I can understand that some consider this to send a totalitarian message -- submit to authority, etc., die for the many, etc. -- but these are actually, in the context of the movie, choices of personal morality, and ones of great cost. The hero is not submitting to authority, but deciding that the vision of a united, no-longer-warring China is one which, in the long run, will save more lives and cause less suffering than killiing the Emperor and temporarily stopping this particular war.

I do not, necessarily, agree, and certainly the poor characters could do with a bit less of the star-crossed fatalism which seems endemic in these sorts of movies, but in truth all of the main characters are heroes in one sense or another: the Emperor, waging a war for what he truly believes is a higher purpose, and, when cornered, willing to accept his fate at the hands of another's choice. The nameless hero, coming to stop the Emperor for the sake of his old homeland, and then coming to the most difficult decision at the critical moment; Broken Sword, the warrior who realized the Emperor's goal and accepted it, and lost his love in so doing; Snow, his true love, who did not accept this course; Sky, who was willing to risk death just to allow the Hero his chance.

Yeah, it's all very Chinese (and somehow also very Wagnerian), but damn, it's gorgeous to watch. If one wants some of the same plot, based on the same basic story (the great warrior king trying to unify the world under his control) but one with somewhat less tragedy and ending with the Emperor getting his, Storm Riders is the way to go.",1103414400,5,3432,4.571661237785016
1890079,5,B00009RG46,"This film may be disturbing for many people accustomed to the usual patterns of the Western vision about the meaning of the hero .

Hero according the Greek meaning has nothing to do with this special hero.

The difference is overclear. The hero in the West World works out under individual considerations . Even if you may argue the Heracles ' twelve works ,  the hero never acts under a collective sense .

And this is the clue . The Oriental hero will act under a collective criterion :To unify the people and the land . But beware about this point ; the real hero never acts under any ideology because he does not know the rules of the game ; he is a nature force and his actions are out a rational concept . Consider the case of Sigfried in The Ring for instance : He dies precisely when he enters to a conventionalist world with rules and agreements ; those terms are nothing for him.

That's is less than understandable for a hero who suddenly resurrected in China .

Any other argument is invalid to justify this strange behavior. Every one of the rivals who fight with our hero know they are uncapable to reach the goal because they lack the noblesse and purity of spirit ; as they act under the passion , they know they are not the adequate messengers and obviously they accept involuntarialy he is the only one capable to show the King the hidden desire , the collective voice of that enormous community .

The visual splendor illuminates the screen  all along the film .

The highlights sequences of the movie are in the field when the yellow leaves are falling and swept by the wind in the female conflict and the other in the Palace under the green curtains falling .

Yimou Zang is actually the most remarkable chinese film maker .

Watch this amazing fable and convince by yourself the role of the hero has never been reach the throne ; hero's role goes beyond that goal . He is born to intend to change the world no matter how expensive be the prize . And the death is a fellow partner due it will be very hard for any one of us to find a hero writing his memories . His life is brief , his origins are always unknown and his fate  will never be the same of the common man .

This film can only be described as cinematic poetry. It is a brutally beautiful combination of an art film and a martial arts film, accomplished by using color and cinematography to complement action, choreagraphy, and dialogue. These elements are used masterfully as the film unfolds. The story itself is deceivingly simple because once you add the poetic visual elements, it becomes very gripping and powerful.

I wasn't going to post a review of this film until I read a review by someone (see below) who had things like this to say about the film:

1890082,3,B00009RG46,"Wuxia Pian, in Chinese Hanyu Pingying, means Martial Arts Hero flicks in literal translation, is a class on its own. Hong Kong had made tons of it and created a whole industry out of it. From these films, pops out past legendary names like Wang Yu, Cheng Pei Pei (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Tiger) and as recent as Jet Li. It has also provided a whole host of inspiration for autuers like Ang Lee and Tarantino for their films.

Now it has fallen upon China's Oscar darling boy Zhang Yimou who takes it upon himself that it is every Chinese director's dream that he should make a swordsplay flick himself. And so he has. Two, in fact. The other, House of Flying Daggers, is still playing in theatres at this time of writing.

Zhang's movie is simplistic in nature. Harvesting from historical folklore regarding China's ""first"" and most ruthless emperor of all, Qin Shi HuangDi. This is the monarch who engineered the construction of the Great Wall of China.

The story concerns on the ascension of the Qin emperor as the emperor of all China once he had united all seven warring states at that time. Naturally, with all despotic tyrants comes disgruntled assassins hellbent on dispatching the revered emperor. According to legend, three assassins had sworn to this task.

Jet Li is an anonymous swordsman aptly named, ""Nameless"". His prowress were said to be so legendary that he had already dispatched all three assassins, said to be excellent martial artists themselves. The movie then unfolds in Rashomon style whereby Nameless relates his tale to the emperor and the ensuing subtefuge that peels off inevitably one layer at a time.

Zhang can be applauded for the look and feel of the movie. He proves himself to be as good a cinemtographer as he was in the past before he became a director. The costumes and sets are exquisite as well as exotic. However, the plot remains lacking. Chinese patriotism in the Chinese Communist Party style still remains in an exacting, yet curiously post-Deng manner. The CCP probably wrote the script themselves.

This movie is worth a watch for two scenes. The fight between Jet Li and Donnie Yen. It's a pleasure to see a cinematic rematch between real-life two martial arts champions who were last seen in ""Once Upon A Time in China 2"".

When you see a title like that, the first thoughts that come to your mind are probably 'Neat,' 'Interesting,' 'Action!' 'Fighting!' and 'I want to see that!' - probably not 'Boring.' But that, I'm afraid, is what it is.
Don't get me wrong, the visuals are stunning, and some of the fight scenes quite entertaining.

The plot, however, I could not sync with.
I understand there are some layers to the story, but it's basically this man (Jet Li) sitting before a throne, telling the king of his victories - how he defeated the 3 assassins. He tells one story. The king doesn't believe him. The king tells what he thinks happens. He gets it right, except for one thing - so the nameless hero has to tell of that.
... Right ...
So it's three tellings of the same story. Just like that.

The three assassins are Sky (Donnie Yen), Broken Sword, and Flying Snow. Let me tell you this - the fight scene between Sky and the hero is the most interesting, but it's the only one that happens only once. Donnie Yen is a great actor (he's really good in Iron Monkey) and great at the martial arts. But he's only in this one little scene.
Then Jet Li has to go fight the other two, and it's with them the stories keep changing.
It's hard to connect with the characters, because they keep changing. For a hero, the nameless guy doesn't do very much.

The fighting is neat at first, but then it gets boring. Wow, they flew! And then they flew again, and again....

What I can say for this movie is that the scenery was really beautiful. They have a scene where Broken Sword and the hero are fighting (flying) over a lake, and the lake and mountain scenery is absolutely gorgeous.
The choreography was all right. The directing was fine. But the movie was boring. It was really surprising - even my father, who simply loves all martial arts movies, said it was flat out boring.
The most fun thing, actually, was the commentary (""Hero Defined"" - a look at the epic masterpiece).

If you are into the stylized fighting and tragic story-lines, I do recommend at least starting the movie. Otherwise, this is one you can go without seeing. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was good.

1890085,4,B00009RG46,"Nameless, a county-prefect-turns-swordsman (Jet Li), goes to the King of Qin (Chen Daoming) claiming he has killed three of the king's greatest arch-enemies, the assassins named Sky (Donnie Yen), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) and Broken Sword (Tony Leung).  With the presentation of each dead assassin's weapons he is allowed to inch closer to the king by 20 paces, as he answers the King's questions about how each assassin came to be killed.  The King surmises otherwise...With a storyline reminiscent in structure to Rashomon (though lacking the latter's emotional resonance) Zhang's epic martial arts movie is wonderful to behold, a stunning excuse to put in some really superlative action choreography, hails of shafts, and rolling fabrics of color which will no doubt please fans of the action (ie. The Matrix) genre.  One scene has Li and Leung dueling gracefully on the waters over a backdrop of ravishing landscape tinted blue and green by Doyle's outstanding photography, and as the movie puts it, the presentation is as pictorial as a scroll of sumptuous calligraphy.  The sleek tale is too slim to carry any character development, and presents itself for better or for worse as a streamlined allegory.  Though Li and Chen are the main protagonists, Leung and Cheung undoubtedly steal the show, as a pair of fellow assassins and lovers, only they lend the movie the proper emotional weight in an otherwise supremely handsome, if tenuously scripted, film.  A bonus is in the film's soundtrack: Tan Dun's score, as ever, is superb.

P.S. The two characters Broken Sword scribbled in the sands could be better translated as ""All under Heaven"" (ie. every human life under Heaven) rather than ""Our Lands"" as given by the Miramax version; not only is it a more *literal* translation, it also corrects the political bias provided that the Miramax subtitles, which lead to so much misunderstanding of the film's ending.",1102982400,4,1920,5.115015974440895

It was lyrical and the colors still show up in my dream. I almost had the same effect when I saw ""Hero"" - this is splendid, fascinating - could not have been better.

Please do not use the English dubbed version - please listen to the Chinese version with English subtitles.

Starting with the plot which deals with 3 versions of the same incident is quite unique - now listen to the voices as they narrate the version - the tones change , the confidence level change in the tone of the voices (this is why you have to listen to the chinese version and not the dub).

The story is about a rebel and the emperor - it is the tactics used by the rebel to reach to the emperor and convey the message of his heart (lets not reveal all the twist).

Part 2  - look at the sets and the canvas. The sets are amazing - every costume has been designed with care to match the canvas - the dark forces are in black and the rebel forces in orange. (When Tolkein writes the same in Hobbit we praise him - don't we).

Part 3 - look at the movements - the same as we have seen in Battleship Potemkim - the dark forces are static while the rebel forces are dynamic - the dynamic forces cut through the static lines - this is an age old riddle that many artists have worked with

Part 4 look at the martial arts - they are movements to convey the emotions and as you wiull notice in different versions of the same situation the fight is different and the costumes are different - they match the mood of the incident

Part 5 - it actually talks about peace - ""our country"" the main theme of the movie is a message of cohesiveness which is so much needed in today's world. It talks about a united country with better communication among it's people

The color combination used in every canvas or frame is just mesmerizing. Most of these are computer effects but I have never seen in movie industry the computer being used to create this level of art, this movie brings HK movies to a new age , new generation like Citizen Kane did for English movies.

Jet Li plays a nameless warrior who presents to the Emperor of Qin the weapons of the three greatest assassins. All of who had sworn to kill him. We are taken on a trip through the stories of the Nameless and how he killed the three assassins. And then once again when the emperor tells us his interpretation of what he perceives happen. Ever perception of the story has its on emotions, visually displayed by its own primary color. The filming is also epic; they were able to use the Chinese army to fill in as extras for the emperor's army.

The conflict shows us the emotions involved with what that emperor was trying to do; unite the seven provinces under one rule. It does delve into both side's reasons and how one person's assassin is another's hero. And what we learn is both sides of any conflict have its heroes. But the main theme this movie tries to get across is that it is a great hero who thinks of his land before his own desires.

For the martial artist we are treated to Jet Li and Donnie Yen fighting each other. It is a wonderful fight. And I hope we do not have to wait years to see them paired up again. This fight alone is worth watching the movie for.",1102636800,10,1431,4.292592592592593

1890095,4,B00009RG46,"Firstly , I've read alot of the reviews for this film. In my opinion , most reviewers , reveal waaaaay too much. Half of the fun is watching this film reveal itself. So , I'm not going to be long winded. I also notice that there's always comprisons to "" Croutching Tiger , Hidden Dragon "". And the reason is because it's in the same league. But you'll never hear or read that it's better than ""Croutching Tiger""...and that's because it's not. However, "" Hero"" is just as entertaining and luckily makes some new breakthrough's in it's fighting sequences and stretches the artistic symbolism of film making. If ""Croutching Tiger , Hidden Dragon"" was a living person...then "" Hero "" would be a favorite, 1st cousin. The cinematography , for ""Hero"" is simply too mesmerizing , for any words that I can use to describe it. The plot is basic but also very touching and not predictable. The acting was impressively believable. Especially , during some of the fight sequences. Honestly , alot of the flying stuff , was so absurd that it would be hard to suspend my belief , had it not been for the actors, making me believe, that they could really do that stuff. Top notch directing , with a top knotch cast endures this film to me and ensures that this will be one of those films that become a cult classic. Just like , ""Enter the Dragon"" , and ""Croutching Tiger"" have become.  Sometimes , it takes an authentic director , with an authentic vision , to create such an authentic film. Although , "" Hero "" over saturated the media with previews , and it's reputation for being one of the most thrilling films of the year , proceeded the film itself......I found it to be atleast 90 percent of what it claimed to be. I highly recommend this film and can honestly say that this is another staple film. Movies, like "" Hero"", not only keep the martial arts genre alive....but take all films...to a higher level.",1102550400,,1898,4.501449275362319
1890096,3,B00009RG46,"As another reviewer mentioned, this is a beautiful movie, extremely well executed, but with a political message that I simply could not embrace.

The quick synopsis is this: The Emperor of Qin, in his bid to unite all of the kingdoms of China, has made many enemies.  Among these, the most formidable are Sky, Broken Sword, and Flying Snow, a trio so terrifying that the Emperor refuses to allow anyone within 100 paces, and has offered thousands of gold pieces for their heads.  Along comes Nameless, a lowly bureaucrat from one of the interior provinces, who claims to have bested all three and wants to an audience with the Emperor.  That being allowed to come within 10 paces of the Emperor is part of the reward for defeating the three assassins presents an interesting enigma to be solved.

In terms of artistry, this movie has few equals.  Jet Li, one of the premier martial artists in movies today, delivers a convincing performance as the Nameless champion, and the remaining principal actors, Maggie Cheung, Tony Leung, Donnie Yen, and Ziyi Zhang offer dramatic presence and martial artistry.  The visual palette of the movie, the striking choice of colors (each separate battle and its retelling offers a different primary color), and the literal cast of thousands (most of the crowd scenes, except for a few obviously CGI long shots of massing armies, seem to be composed of actual actors) create an incredible experience for the viewer.

However, the politics are deeply flawed.  In brief, this is an apologist's excuse for the authoritarian Chinese government.  It is clear, after watching the movie, why the Chinese government has wholeheartedly supported this film (the mere presence of hundreds of extras seem to suggest that quite a few strings were pulled to facilitate its fimling, as well as extensive use of majestic locales, such as the main palace, desolate vistas, etc.).  The emperor even has a line where he says (paraphrasing) ""People think I am a tyrant, but only he understood me"" (where the idea is that unifying the country and maintaing its stability are the loftiest of goals).  Basically, the message is that the people of China should be proud to be members of this great country, not dissent and follow the orders of the puzzling, sometimes tyrannical government, because deep down, they want what is best for the people.  The government is merely misunderstood, and heavy handed tactics, such as wipping out defenseless studends in caligraphy school (in the movie) or defenseless students protesting in a square (in real life) should be viewed in the light of patriotism and national pride/security.",1102464000,7,2637,5.006864988558353
1890097,5,B00009RG46,"I was mesmerized through the entire film. It is one of the most beautifully filmed, scripted and acted piece of artwork I have ever seen.

It is different and predictably not everyone liked it but I thought that it was brilliant.

Jet Li stars as the Namesless Hero who in service to his King killed the three assasins: Sky, Flying Snow and Master Broken Sword, who had been attempted to kill the King of Qin; revenge for his soldiers killing their families in the Kings quest to unify the seven warring states of ancient China.

This is a typical Chinese legend told in beautiful Chinese style. I have loved the old Chinese legends from my experience with the martial arts and felt very ""connected"" to the characters.

It is timeless epic of love, honor, duty, sacrifice, loyalty and revenge told with the most beautiful cinematography I have ever seen. Better even in that regard the the Last Samurai ( another brilliant piece of art)

The movie is essentially a series of re-tellings of events surrounding Namesless' quest to kill the assaisins, Nameless telling his version of the killing of the assasins for the kings benefit. The king being paranoid about the attempts on his life requires Nameless to initially drink and speak from 100 paces. As the story is told the king permits Nameless to advance closer and closer.

Probably due to my familiarity with Chinese legends I knew what was coming, but others who watched it with me never guessed until it was tacitly revealed by the King and Nameless.

The directing, acting fight choreography and script were beautiful beyond my abilty to describe. There is more than one version of events told and as each is revealed the whole truth finally comes out.

It is not necessary to agree or disagree with the ""message"" that unification of the warring states but the end result is based on historical fact of the beginning of the unification and China's first Dynasty.

This movie gave me goosebumps.

Buy this movie and enjoy it over and over.

Watch it in Madarin once without the subtitles. It is a spiritual experience in its native language. The subtitles distract you fomr seeing all the fine nuances of the actors faces and motions as well as the extraordinary scenery.

One note about the wire stunts. These stunts are popular in Chinese films and do add a ballet-like flair to the sword fighting scenes. Many in the US seem to be down on the ""flying"" of the fighters saying it is over the top and makes the scenes look silly.

I come here to defend the flying on several counts. First, who are we to say that it is impossible? Because we can't do it or understand it? If that is the standard then the ""impossible"" is done every day of our lives. How many things that we have always said was impossible turn out to be very possible and maybe even simple? Think about that.

Also - if anyone is familar with the ancient ""kungs"" they are themselves almost unbelievable yet many of the masters have demonstrated accomplishment in these kungs that defy modern scientific explanation. Jumping, iron broom, basket and red sand kungs are still being performed today in parts of China and can be witnessed.

China has a long history of learning and knowledge. The Chinese were making wine in 7,000 BC! The Chinese had thousands of years to practice and study and perfect these kungs. In some cases there were a hundred generations of masters who practiced a single kung their entire lives and did nothing but that! You don't do anything for that long unless you have results.

Think of acupuncture as one example. Previously dismissed as ""voodoo"" by western medicine yet the Chinese have been practicing it for 4000 years! Who would do something for 4000 years if it didn't work? Now acupuncture is done is frequently western medicine. They still can't explain it but they have to admit that it works.

I think it is very presumnptuos to think that we educated and ""modern"" westerners know it all and can so easily pronounce things as being impossible, especially things from such an ancient civilization. The Chinese were writing, learning and exploring their world ( and space ) when we Eurpoeans were still living in trees and hitting each other with clubs. Folks, we don't know it all.

I have seen myself red sand kung, jumping and wall climbing kungs. I have seen a master of basket kung walk along the edge of a wicker basket so soft and light I could move it with a breath yet I saw master balance and run along the edge without distorting the weave. There was no trick. I saw with my own eyes the red sand kung and it was not a trick.

Simple jumping like these scenes depicted. I can give it the benefit of the doubt. Not only that they lend a beauty to the scenes that is stunning in its impact.

Also, I'm getting tired of defending this movie to people who've only gotten the North American version of the subtitles. It's like we're not even talking about the same movie anymore.

What a thing to do to such a beautiful piece of art. How do these people sleep at night?

Looking through the other comments below, I followed Raul Saavedra's advice and checked out the difference between the image quality in the special features, and the movie itself. He has a very astute point. The main movie image quality just ends up looking that much worse in comparison. Why do the scenes look so awesome in the special features sections? My theory is that they tried to cram too much onto one disc (the Japanese release is 2 DVDs), and had to compress the video even more than the overseas releases to make up for it, so the image quality of the movie itself suffered.

1890102,4,B00009RG46,"With the plot twists and kung fu scenes like that of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.' the movie 'Hero' stands alone in not only being a source of pure entertainment but of keeping the viewer informed and up to date on things and matters that shaped history. The movie starts out as the central character played by Jet Li by the name of Nameless. Essentially he is one that has very little identity and have become virtually a statistic of the emperor uniting all the fragmented lands and kingdoms in ancient China 2,000 years ago. The movie itself let us not forget that with advance historical achievements such as in this case a growing empire with its massive armies has to come about through obstacles that entails certain historical and cultural values. No one is not saying that in whatever shape or form how all empire is going to be. In this case  trying to break through the barrier of Nameless explaining to the emperor how he managed to kill the three assassins  who have been for the last ten years have been plotting the emperors death which turned out to be extremely false and flawed. Throughout the movie we see how through certain scenes how the emperor is vunerable such as 1)when two of the assassins were able three years prior to fight off three thousand of his best soldiers and 2)Nameless himself was able to get ten paces close enough to the emperor-whom we learned later on was himself part of the plot aiming to kill the emperor. The movie is rich in themes and effect. It doesn't leave to much anyone expectation anything left wide open or undiscussed. The plot development is strong and any weakness through the shift of the plot is made by the presence of a powerful army.

Yet we must not take this the wrong way in any type of historical analogy. This empire came about as we watched the movies of the reluctance and perhaps even say courage of one of the earlier assasins to 'split' with the plan of 'going on' to assasinate the emperor. These decisions are motivated by looking at the bigger picture or as some would say the 'totality.' Then again despite how powerful each of assasin were they were still human and often times caught up by hubris or by other human emotions such as love and loyalty.

The mistake I think people will make about this movie is to assume that all empires have been formed on maintaining 'universal peace' or as we have witnessed in the 50 or so years by 'human idealogy' such as controlling the very essence of life. They can be formed just by the winds of time and history itself. In this movie are some 19th German thinking such as controlling and swaying the masses like you read in Isaiah Berlin's 'The Crooked Timber of Humanity.' (sorry for anachronism)

Empires of the future will no doubt be formed in the acquisition of lands and countries and the use of the most powerful and destructive forces on earth. In today's time the mathmatics doesn't work with the dissolving state and institutions which is being reflected the physical world being crowded out the virtual world such that the future unlike 'Hero' won't have massive armies whose presence will strike fear but be rather something like anti-armies more like the formation of virtual states and labarotory engineering from birth until adult hood as the means of any forms of social policy. This has to come about through certain things among them a strong super technological revolution that will underscore most political science but on the other hand energies that has to be unleashed that will have to shape the line of war and political outcome. There are on the other hand will no doubt be Heros viewed in the as traitors or assassins but like Nameless --'buried as a hero.'",1102291200,5,3711,4.659541984732824

The special effects in the movie are quite stunning, in the fighting scenes no moves look dodgy even when they take on an army the moves that are performed accually look like they could do the job if perfected in the way that they are in the movie although the one on ones are much more amaising. Slow motion effects are added to see the sharpness of the skills performed by the warriors. The artistic style of fighting in this movie is deffinately a pick up from all the previous movies that i've seen that take on the same style.

1890104,5,B00009RG46,"First of all let me clarify something, this is NOT a QUENTON TARENTINO movie. ""Hero"" is a foreign film, that came out originally in 1999 but was brought just now to the US thanks in large part to QT (who loved the film and thought US audiences would too).

Hero is set in china during it's ""warring states"" period. During this time, China was not a united country as we know it today, but consisted of 6 or so smaller kingdoms which were almost always at war with one another. Then the king of Qin (chin) attained military supremecy and began to ruthlessly conquer his neighbors, swallowing up all the kingdoms of china ""like a silk worm gobbles up mulbury leaves"". The king of Qin then proclaimed himself ""Shi Huang Di"" China's First emperor... china as we know it is born of this empire.

The story is full of twists and is told in a Roshomon style (showing different perspectives of the story until we finally arive at the truth). The entire movie is really a conversation between the King Of Qin and a bounty hunter who has killed 3 assassins from the rival state of Zhou that were trying to kill the king. The Hero, tells the king his stories of how he defeated each, and the story takes a few twists.

Our Hero, and his opponents all possess almost super-natural kung fu powers. And the fights are utterly amazing. The fight scenes and martial arts choreography are OUT OF THIS WORLD. In fact they're so over the top that many might find them ""silly"". But this is supposed to be more of a legend or a myth than a story based in reality and that should allow you to watch on with awe at thier powers rather than chuckling at seeing men walk on water or fly through the air.

The acting is superb. Jet Li and all the others do an OUTSTANDING job! This combined with amazing vivid visuals and innovative use of striking color give Hero a very complex and heartfelt emotional depth that other movies are lacking now a days. Everything from the diologue to the story to the acting to the fabulous soundtrack is touching and moving.

Amazing visuals, great cinematography, a wonderful score, excellent actors and a deep and engaging story... what more do you want? One word summurizes this film - FANTASTIC... in every possible sense of the word. Those just wanting a kung Fu Swordplay movie with some crazy fight scenes will get more than they could have possibly hoped for. Those wanting a deep and engaging historically based epic will also be pleased. And the passion with which this film was finely crafted ensures that it touches on every emotional aspect of life - love, hate, peace, war, passion, dedication, compassion, regret... you name it. You don't just watch this movie, you feel it - so those seeking a movie with depth and meaning behind it and a real story to tell should look no further than hero. It's a martial arts historical epic that has many levels and layers and you can come away from Hero with as much as you are willing to look for in it.

1890107,4,B00009RG46,"HERO is Yimou Zhang's first attempt at a martial arts film - and the novelty shows.  As the featurettes explain, he dreamed of making a sword film, searched for a story, and finally wrote his own story that would allow him to express his excitement about the genre.

So, the story is minimal - Nameless Hero (Jet Li) gradually approaches the King of the province Qin as he relates how he protected the King from potential assassins.  The film is done in flashbacks to show how Nameless Hero accomplished his feats.  In the end a plot is revealed that brings the movie to an odd resolution.  And that is really all the story is about.

The beauty here is in the choices of various colors to depict the various stages of Nameless Hero's quest: oranges become yellows become reds become greens become whites, etc.  The settings are placed within the vast deserts of China and in palace courtyards. The costumes and settings are magically lush and stunningly beautiful.  The action is the expected highly choreographed martial arts sequences that appear more like ballet than fighting.  The huge supporting casts of armies are amazingly well staged with epic action and surreal results.

The overall message is about the way the once divided China of 2000 years ago became united into what is called 'the Land'.  That is really all we have as far as directorial message mission.  It matters little that the acting is minimal and wooden, that the use of flashbacks and revised flashforwards leaves some mystery as to which of the characters have been killed on several occasions (!).  The pleasure is in the looking - and this is a beautiful, active piece of art to watch.

My care for the story slowly disintegrated as the movie plodded along, with fight scenes that were half-hearted --- some just pointless.

No amount of color filters could save this film.",1102032000,4,370,4.661538461538462
1890110,2,B00009RG46,"The color themes were a good idea and, in and of themselves, implemented well. There were other esoteric themes in the movie such as the the emperor's candles and their manner of giving off vibes by blowing in various directions in unison.

At that point the thrill ended for me. The martial arts displays were overly artsy and underly realistic (see Jet Li in 'Kiss of the Dragon' or 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' if you want to see entire caliburs of higher quality MA's work). They were also very redundant - that spinning horizontally in the air deal was done to the point where I wanted to spin my remote control at the screen in a similar fashion.

Additionally I thought there was far too much wire work that didn't really go anywhere. It was of a higher quality, in my opinion, than some of the wirework in CTHD but at least in CTHD there was a lot of variety and not the same three or four wire scenes repeated endlessly.

I might have scored this higher had the cast been of a lower calibur. It's just innate that we tend to judge the quality of given people against themselves, and actors such as Jet Li took two steps backward against some of their previous work. This I have to blame on direction (regardless of the origin - the directors job is to pump the best of the best from those he/she is working with).

Overall my expectations, which were partially based on the trailers, were very high, so this film was a great dissapointment for me. It was also a great frustration as I know the cast has much higher ability and some of the thematic ideas were very clever. It sort of makes you want to write to the producer and ask ""can we try this again only do it right?"".

As well, the story itself was lacking luster.

So - you ask - why give it any stars? I did so because it wasn't a total waste. In addition to the thematic concepts mentioned earlier there were at least a couple of decent sequences. One was the inital arrow rain let loose by the emperors army on the calligraphy school. That was kinda 'special'. As well, the costume designs were admittedly impressive.

Good luck and I hope others who have bought the movie find more in it than I.",1102032000,3,2168,4.378109452736318
1890111,4,B00009RG46,"For those accustomed to seeing Jet Li in campy (if entertaining) American movies like Romeo Must Die and Kiss of the Dragon, Hero may come as a bit of a shock at first.  Directed by Zhang Yimou, who's apparently a pretty big deal in China, Hero is an epic morality tale writ large, filled with outsized emotions and political intrigue that just goes to show you not much has changed in the past 2000 years or so.  On its face, it concerns the king of Qin's campaign to unite the seven states of China, but there's a lot more going on beneath the surface.  What starts out as a story of a humble civil servant doing his duty for his king eventually turns into an operatic tale of vengeance, honor, and conflicting values, with plenty of breaks for the kind of rousing martial-arts action that made Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon so legendary.

The quote that opens the film states that in any war there are heroes on both sides, and indeed Hero more than anything else is an examination of the idea of heroism.  The most important idea to be taken from this movie (in this writer's humble opinion, of course), is that of idealism, more specifically how it serves to motivate people.  Nameless is obviously an example of how people's ideals can evolve over time, as his motivations shift from a narrow desire for revenge to a broader concern for the greater good of his people (whether his actions are the best way to achieve the greater good is debatable, but beside the point).  Similarly, we see how Broken Sword and Snow quarrel over the wisdom of assassinating the Emperor, even though both have noble intentions, or at least think they do.  Even the Emperor himself is a paragon of moral ambiguity, as he relentlessly pursues his goal in spite of his awareness of the cost in human lives (incidentally, if you want to see this subject explored from a decidedly different angle, check out the even better film The Emperor and the Assassin).  In the end, whether explicitly or not, each major character has statement to make (actually, Zhang Ziyi's Moon is somewhat extraneous, but I'm willing to let it slide because she's hot).

Of course, this being a Jet Li movie and all, much attention is going to be focused on the fight scenes, and none of them fail to disappoint, whether Li is involved in them or not.  It's movies like this one for which the term ""poetry in motion"" was invented.  And if you think there aren't enough swordfights in film these days, you should check this movie out at the earliest possible moment.  Just about every battle here is tense, precisely choreographed and shot, and at times even emotional. While there's plenty (maybe a bit too much) of the expected high-flying, intricate action, the scenery ends up becoming more of a focus since it's just so damn stunning.  As many have noted, each fight scene showcases a predominant color, be it red, green, or white, but what's more important is the attention to detail that Yimou put into filming them.  Everything has some significance, from swirling leaves to falling drops of water to the string music that plays during the early battle between Nameless and Sky.  This is the rare movie that can consistently engage your senses without overloading them.

It's not just the combat scenes that provide some major eye candy, though: visually, this whole movie is a stunner.  The cinematography gives some idea of the vastness of the Chinese landscape, with awe-inspiring shots of steppes, deserts, and forests, and the scenes involving massed Chinese armies are among the most foreboding and impressive I've seen anywhere.  The arrow attack on the calligraphy school, in addition to being rather poignant in its own way, is particularly impressive in its use of perspective, with shots that do for arrows what John Woo's direction has done for bullets.  In a similar vein, although it's a minor detail, the scene where Nameless sticks his sword through the middle of an arrow shaft is just about the coolest thing in martial-arts movie history.

Since so much has been said on the subject, I feel I'd be remiss if I didn't throw in my two cents about the political implications of Hero.  Personally, I find the accusations that this movie is an apology for communism or totalitarianism to be exaggerated if not utterly baseless.  Yes, we all know China is a communist country, and communists do all kinds of naughty things, but this movie hardly goes out of its way to endorse any particular ideology.  It's really more about such themes as unity, sacrifice, and patriotism, which countless filmmakers the world over have explored without mentioning communism.  More to the point, with the exception of the postscript that appears on the screen after the action has already ended, the movie doesn't endorse the actions of Nameless or anyone else; it merely demonstrates that different people have different notions of what constitutes ""doing the right thing.""  While viewers are certainly going to draw their own political messages from this movie, the ideas explored here are far more eternal and universal than any ephemeral debate over systems of governance or the virtues of centralized power.  People need to just watch the movie and enjoy it for what it is, not start inferring messages that don't exist.",1102032000,4,5292,4.818784530386741

I love the way different colors were used symbollically throughout the film, until finally in the final sequence, everything is in white and the actual events are revealed.  I also enjoyed the love story between Flying Snow and Broken Sword.  When I watched this with my friends,we were in tears for the whole second half of the movie!  I also was able to see it on the big screen and loved it there too.

On the contrary, its an endorsement on the part of Mr. Tarantino, and I'm sure the filmakers considered it a welcome one when they received their royalty checks.  Lets face it, despite the fact that much progress has been made in recent years towards making Americans more open to foreign films, they still have very limited box office potential in the United States.  Most Americans won't even consider seeing a movie if its subtitled.  Putting QTs name above the title guarantees a built in box office that would not have been there otherwise.  And the ploy worked brilliantly.  ""Hero"" opened at #1 at the box office and stayed in the top ten for several weeks after that. If the movie had not been good, having QTs name on it would not have made a difference after word of mouth got out.  But if QTs name had not been there at all, it would likely have opened in a few art-house cinemas and faded to video soon after.  Hats off to QT for turning on a new generation of fans to the pleasures of Hong Kong cinema.

1890118,5,B00009RG46,"Since I did not see the theater release I can only comment on my viewing it at home.

I overhead projected the DVD using a Marantz 12S2 DLP projector on a 100"" Da-lite Cinema Contour screen.  I thought the video superb but again not able to make a direct comparsion to the theater release.  I to noticed the switch to B&W in part of an early scene.  Chalked that up to director's choice and enjoyed it none the less.

""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" was my first look at the highly stylized kung-fu action scene.  My first reaction (after a few minutes) was one of non-believability.  Now I have come to realize that this is no more than ballet and try to enjoy it on that level.

I viewed the film in Mandarin with English subtitles and enjoyed it very much even though I felt as if I was missing some beauty when diverting my eyes to the sub-titles.  I spooled the movie again this morning to check out the Engish dubbing.  It was accented english but the voice quality seemed to match the actors voices and the dubbing was near perfectly synched.

I found the story to be absorbing, well told, and well acted.  I was not thinking ""propaganda"" at all during the movie and even as I reflect on it I do not get that sense.  This movie can be enjoyed on many levels so turn loose and have a good time.",1101859200,18,1301,4.304526748971194
1890119,4,B00009RG46,"From the very beginning of this film it is entirely obvious that director Zhang Yimou studied Akira Kurosawa films before shooting.  This film is huge in scope with magnificent sets, a large cast of extras all clad in ancient armor, and beautiful locales for all the scenes to unfold shrouded in a veil of fantastic cinematography.  I was reminded of two Kurosawa films, in particular: ""Ran"" and ""Rashomon.""  ""Ran"" because of the sheer size of this film with regards to sets, cast, and costumes; and ""Rashomon"" because of the unusual plotting.  It isn't until the film is nearing its conclusion that the entire truth is revealed with an historical aspect thrown in for good measure.  Of course, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is the most immediate comparison in modern day cinema with regards to the balletic choreography during the many fight sequences.  The magical fantasy that was so charming in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is given a much more serious tone here with ancient history/folklore as the driving spiritual force behind the story.  There are some minor flaws.  The one that stands out the most is when two similar scenes are compared.  Both are fight sequences that take place within the matched warriors' minds.  The early sequence is shot in black and white, while the later scene is shot in color.  That sort of lack of consistency is the main reason I cannot consider this a masterpiece.  There were many other small, though unfortunately noticable flaws scattered throughout the story, but to nitpick would be to forget how good the rest of the film is.  The cinematography is the true star here, though many of the actors acquit themselves with talent and dignity.  This is a glorious and colorful spectacle from one of my favorite directors, Zhang Yimou.  It was interesting that he chose to do an action film when his most notable films are all dramas.  Some of his finest works include ""Raise the Red Lantern,"" ""Ju Dou,"" and my personal favorite, ""To Live.""

1890122,3,B00009RG46,"This DVD doesn't do justice at all to how beautiful the original movie looks.  I went to the theater 7 or 8 times to watch Hero, liked it really a lot.  This movie is very artistic and beautiful in all respects in my humble opinion.  Colors were so brilliant, scenes so beautiful and sharp, audio was so amazing, music was so great, the story was so simple yet so well structured, and the conclusion of the movie is so poignant and well done.

I was one of the first customers to get the DVD in a local Walmart yesterday night at official release time.  Verdict after watching some scenes, video quality is extremely poor and dissapointing.  If you already have this DVD, or if you rent it, and you think the video quality in this DVD is *not* terrible, just go to the Special features section and watch in amazement how much better the colors look there in the shorts of the movie, compared to how those same scenes look during the actual DVD playback of the movie.  For instance the scene where Nameless walks down the stairs exiting the King's palace, guards all around. During the normal DVD playback of that scene, everything looks grainy, washed out, and way ""over burned"", as if it had been filmed with too much light, and with low resolution.  But that is not the case of course, those are just compression artifacts introduced by a terrible transfer.  Go to the special features and see through them, and wait till you see that same scene. There you can see it with MUCH BETTER SATURATED COLORS, BETTER CONTRAST, and DECENT RESOLUTION.

HOW COME THE TRANSFER WAS GOOD FOR THE SHORTS AND PREVIEWS IN THE SPECIAL FEATURES SECTION, BUT NOT FOR THE MOVIE ITSELF IN THE DVD???????

The same applies to pretty much all scenes shown in the Special Features.  Pretty much all of them have better color saturation and balance, and look overall way better than what you see watching the movie from the DVD.  I can't help but feel indignation. It is such a shame that this gorgeous movie received such an unprofessional treatment. This is really one of my favorite movies of all time, and for the movie I'd give 5 starts for sure.  Not to this DVD.

The colors, especially yellows and blues, here are nowhere near as brilliant and saturated as in the movie. The gorgeous fight scene between the two women, with the beautiful swirls of yellow leaves and petals, on the DVD shows terrible washed out yellows, and washed out blue skies in the background. Inside the palace, the blues of the stones are not as saturated as they should be either, and the deep saturated yellow glowing dots in the candles in the original movie, with their rich yellow aura, are barely yellow in the DVD, they could pass as just dim whites.

Also the DVD has parts that seem to be in terrible low grainy resolution, for example the passionate love making scene.  It looks simply terrible and grainy on the DVD, plus with deteriorated colors.  Same as when Nameless walks down the stairs outside the Kings palace, which looks the worst of all.  Most annoyingly, some skin colors in general appear some times purplish and greenish on the DVD. This is all the most disappointing, precisely because something that stood out so beautifully in the original movie was the richness and beauty of the colors.  Putting the Special Features section aside, overall video quality in this DVD is plain shameful, zero stars for that.

Audio sounded really great from the DVD though, no objections there. And this movie has awesome audio and music.

But if there's a movie that video-wise has been poorly transferred to DVD, and deserves a second remastered release, it's this one.

Hopefully it will be released in HD-DVD some day, with much more faithful colors and resolution.  Again if you have it already, or if you rent it, just watch the special features to get a glimpse of how much you are missing.

Addendum: My impressions are based on watching this DVD on my 27"" flatscreen Sony Wega TV using its special widescreen mode. I have calibrated this TV as best as possible using the AVIA DVD, but I know the limitations of this display (in particular, most Sony TVs tend to have overpowering reds.)  Even so, just watching the Special Features makes so evident the fact that things could look so much better in this DVD.  About 60 other DVDs I've watched several times with this same equipment, and many of those movies I've also seen a few times on the theaters.  Only with Hero I experienced this major dissapointment and indignation with the colors (and resolution in some parts,) comparing the movie on the DVD vs. how things looked on the big screen, or oddly enough, on the Special Features section!",1101772800,10,4671,4.656516443361754
1890123,3,B00009RG46,"I can go on and on about the greatness of this film. The colors, cinematography and moving performances are some of the most graceful and impressive examples of Wuxia I've ever had the pleasure to watch. I won't say anything beyond that though, because plenty here already have expressed it better than I could. Read the many the five-star reviews of ""Hero"", and believe them to be true. They are. Hero is a brilliant piece of wuxia cinema, artistic, stylish, well performed, well written and very well directed. [...]

This movie could have been released, and people would have gone to see it without Mr. ""Cinema of Cool"" attempting to take credit for something he had absolutely nothing to do with. If you think Quentin Tarantino had ANYTHING to do with the creation of ""Hero"" consider yourself fleeced, because you were. I bought the Chinese import from eBay well before it was prepared for release in the USA, and well before it occurred to Miramax to give QT credit for this move.

It offends me personally that Quentin Tarantino would dare to stamp his name all over this as if he himself worked on it. He did nothing but put his name on it. I've been seeing reviews (not just here but everywhere online) by people who think he directed it because it says ""Quentin Tarantino Presents""! He did NOT direct this damnit! Zhang Yimou did. He did NOT write it, produce it, film it, perform in it (and thank God for that) or do anything but like it as much as most of us do. All he did was ""present it"" and what the hell does that mean? Nothing!

Why, Mirimax, did his name need to be stamped all over someone else's work? He IS a brilliant stand-alone creative element in cinema- invoking his name to fill theaters is despicable! And Tarantino himself is a piece of work for DARING to take any form of credit for this great film. What's next? ""Quentin Tarantino Presents ""Braveheart"" or how about Quentin Tarantino presents ""Ben Hur"" It's (beep)ing pathetic.

It must be some kind of mean joke to play on the real creative people behind this, but those of us who see through this marketing scam aren't laughing, nor is anyone else.[...]

I'm probably shouting at the rain, but I'm going to appeal to consumers that if you saw this in a theater and loved it--- make a statement and buy the Chinese import of this movie. Miramax and Quentin Tarantino are trying to fool you into thinking this is another great work of the so-called indie-maverick.

Jet Li is charismatic as the nameless man who confronts the emperor with three weapons from three assassins who had sworn to kill the emperor.  As he tells the story of each man, we see these episodes exquisitely filmed with dazzling action and in a dominant color.

1890127,4,B00009RG46,"Much as Ang Lee demonstrated his directorial virtuosity in CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, Zhang Yimou has applied his magnificent talents to the martial arts genre with HERO. This is movie not only worth seeing, but worth watching two or three times, or more. Each viewing unveils new appreciation for Zhang's artistic direction, Chris Doyle's cinematography, Tan Dun's musical score, and Itzhak Perlman's violin performance, not to mention fresh insights into the story line and character interrelationships.

The story line is simple enough on its surface, based loosely on Chinese historical fact. The king of the Qin state seeks to unify the Seven Kingdoms some 2,000 years ago, and three assassins from the defeated Zhao state wish to kill him. An unknown warrior named Nameless, from the Qin state, succeeds in killing the three assassins and returns to collect his reward in an audience with the King. As we view segments of Nameless's explanation of how he defeated three such fearsome opponents, a battle of wits ensues with the skeptical King until the truth emerges. Their verbal sparring beautifully parallels the feints, thrusts, and parries of the martial arts scenes.

Within this story line, we are treated to extraordinary, ballet-like martial arts contests between Nameless and the three assassins. Each scene is dominated by one primary color, from the opening desert white to the reds of the calligraphy school to the yellows of autumn leaves whose wind-swept swirls become weapons in themselves. A sword fight between Broken Sword and the King of Qin is cloaked in flowing green cloth, reminiscent of Zhang's use of colored cloth in JU DOU.

While HERO evokes memories of RASHOMON, this is not the same motif. The three ""versions"" of the assassins' reported deaths are rather more like the gradual unfolding of a Sherlock Holmes mystery. As the tale reveals itself, the relationship of the four assassins (including Nameless)moves from enemies to spurned lovers to companions working together and finally to a genuinely tragic (if seemingly platonic) love between two of them.

Several less recognized aspects of HERO are particularly worthy of note. First, anyone who saw Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung in IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE will find it remarkable that the same two actors could pull off the characters of Broken Sword and Flying Snow so successfully. Second, the game of Go played by the assassin Sky at the beginning of the movie magnificently foreshadows Nameless's successive movements in the King's presence from 100 to 20 to 10 paces. Third, the ballet movements in unison of the candle flames burning before the King are not only brilliant in conception, they mirror the closing scene's behavior of the King's faceless advisors calling for Nameless's execution. Finally, the juxtaposition of calligraphy brushes with swords and flying arrows is a dramatic visual rendition of the pen and sword adage.

A last comment. Criticism of HERO as Communist Party propaganda is laughably absurd and demonstrates a severe lack of understanding of Chinese history. Qin Shihuang was a product of his times, no more or less tyrannical than the Egyptian pharaohs, Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, William the Conqueror, Suleiman, or the American generals who ""cleared"" the Wild West of Indians. Regardless of his methods, Qin Shihuang accomplished a grand unification (All under heaven) that continues two millennia after his death. HERO evokes the founding of a nation and one unknown man's ultimate decision to sublimate his desire for revenge to the greater good of his country. That makes it no more propagandist than stories of Abraham Lincoln's struggle to re-unify the North and the South at the cost of countless thousands of lives, and far less pathetically propagandist than the recent ""American hero"" movies celebrating Jessica Lynch or Ronald Reagan. Americans need to take a long, hard look in the mirror more often before screaming propaganda about the cultural work of other countries.

HERO is not a perfect movie. The sword fight over the lake goes a bit over the top, the calligraphy/sword connection is overplayed, and Zhang Ziyi's character Moon too often feels extraneous. Nevertheless, HERO is a Must See for anyone who loves great story-telling and great movie-making.",1100995200,226,4311,5.213564213564213

Jet Li is the nameless warrior who kills the assasins and arrives on the emperor's doorstep. He tells the story of his battles, seen in flashback. But Li's story is soon contradicted by the emperor, who sees a plot to assasinate him. The result is a mosaic of Rashomon-like contradictory flashbacks filled with stunning kung fu acrobatics. Yimou removes the usual hokey jokes associated with the kung fu genre (the film is strikingly humorless), concentrating instead on making the film as beautiful as possible.. The screen is drenched in amazing colors, computer animation and graceful violence. This work of art deserves to be seen.

I was pleasantly supprised at the originality and plot twists of this movie, along with the wonderful music and fluidity of the story.  Anyone who likes Jet Li but maybe didn't like ""Romeo Must Die"" needs to see this movie to help reinstate Jet Li as the modern day martial arts #1 actor. I'm glad that this movie is coming out on DVD before Christmas. I've been wanting to see again almost every day since I saw it last.",1100908800,4,542,4.520408163265306
1890130,4,B00009RG46,"Although interest in ""Hero"" may have been created by ""Crouching Tiger"" of a couple of years ago, this movie is very different.  There is action:  sword fights, attack by armies, thousands of arrows flying through the air.  In a slight way, it can be called a ""kung fu"" movie.  Yet, there is more here.

Like ""Crouching Tiger,"" the photography, scenery, and action are breathtakingly beautiful.  Here, the filmmakers use color almost as separate characters.  Martial arts are depicted as philosophy rather than just sword styles.  Based on an actual historical period, the characters have depth.  Perhaps those unfamiliar with Chinese history will have reason to read up on it.

""Crouching Tiger"" is a movie that can be viewed many times without growing tired of it.  ""Hero"" is a movie that should be viewed many times in order to peal back the layers and find the depths of the story.  The old kung fu movies have been built on and the results are fascinating and beautiful movies with depth and charm.  Both of these newer films are so much more than martial arts fantasies.",1100736000,9,1075,4.808743169398907
1890131,3,B00009RG46,"Basic plotline: The tyrannical emperor of China is on the verge of making China one unified country under his control. However, three powerful assassins have vowed to kill the Emperor for his war crimes. In retlaiation the Emperor has placed the most lavish bounty in history to the man that brings him proof of these asssassins' deaths. Enter Jet Li. He brings the Emperor proof that he's defeted these 3 deadly assassins, but as the Emperor questions Jet Li's story it begins to form holes and only at the film's end is the truth revealed.

Some people may be wondering why ""Quentin Tarantino Presents"" is above Jet Li's name on the DVD. Well, truth be told Tarantino had zero to do with the making of this film (so don't expect KILL BILL type action). However, the company (Miramax) that bought the U.S. distribution rights to HERO has a bad history of mangling nearly every Asian film they release in the US, so Tarantino and the company came to an agreement that if Tarantino let's them slap his name above the title of the film then they'll leave the mangling of HERO to a minimum. So U.S. cinema fans owe Tarantino that much, but otherwise his name has no business being associated with this film.

One name that everyone should associate with the film HERO, but few Americans know, is Yimou Zhang. Who? He's the director. Ultimately, direction is what saves this film and it's flimsy plotline and hollow characters from becoming just another low-grade kung-fu B-flick. Nothing wrong with chop-socky B-flicks. I love those, too. But Yimou Zhang elevates the material and makes it cinematic. The fights aren't just cool--they're beautiful. Some may call them too ""artsy,"" and it's true the film's use of color to denote perspective can feel a bit heavy handed at times, but never to the point of going overboard.

It seems a lot of reviews are comparing HERO to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and many ways you can feel HERO trying to be CT,HD. It's true that both films have exceptional cinematography and excellent fight choreography, but there is sadly where the comparisons end. On the down side, HERO lacks the wonderful story and griping characters of CT,HD. HERO has a one-note love story between two assasins thrown into the film just to move the story along. Also HERO is basically one story about two battles told from three different perspectives: Jet Li's Character's, the Emporer's, and then the truth. On the upside, it has a great gimick of showing audiences the same fights but form different perspectives. And the ending wasn't exactly what I expected; it somehow left me feeling both satisfied and a little cheated.

Bottomline: HERO is a kung-fu flick dressed up real nice and elevated by the director cinematically, but without any charcaters of real depth or a strong plot it doesn't live up to its full potential.",1100736000,6,2841,4.827515400410678
1890132,5,B00009RG46,"i loved this movie.  I'm sure everyone's already raved about the cinematography and beautiful scenes and colors etc.  I agree with them.

But I also personally liked it because I identified with the culture somewhat.  I hate those kitchy movies involving ""the Orient"" from a Western perspective that make it all look stupid and stereotypical and all about yelling martial arts people who don't speak good English.  You know, like Shanghai Knights or whatever.  That type of movie annoys me a lot, because it has no empathy, and makes Chinese culture look like a superficial exotified stereotype from a Western context.  But this movie was wonderful in the dignity of the characters, because the story about the Chinese characters was made from a Chinese perspective and context, and therefore knew what it was talking about, and therefore also had depth and true empathy.  That made it beautiful.  Like...Jet Li in Hero vs. Jet Li in Unleashed.  In Hero, he is in his own language/element and you really see the true magnitude of his ability and dignity and character.  In an American movie like Unleashed (based on the trailer), he's an ANIMAL for crying out loud, and you just notice his broken English and just his typical martial arts fighting skills, and he's just a novelty to be toyed with.  See the difference?

So in short, I loved Hero because it seemed more genuine and had true dignity and gravity and was just beautiful overall, and though it had awesome fights in it, it wasn't ONLY about the fight scenes.  I felt like I really identified with and understood the types of dialogues that happened in the movie.  Very genuine and beautiful in all senses of the word.

I loved that the entire film was in Chinese with English subtitles - it gave a much more authentic ambiance to the film.

He begins to tell the story of how he met and dispatched  the three assassins, sky, snow and broken sword. The story is really only a pretext for some of the most visually arresting scenes and some elegant sword and martial arts.

But Yimou takes the whole genre to a new level with a Rashomon retelling of the story until the truth is revealed. Be prepared for some of the most visually stylistic sequences you will ever see. The fight on the lake alone takes this film to another level.

1890141,2,B00009RG46,"There is a scene deep into Yimou Zhang's Hero that burns with inspiration. A warrior bent on assassinating the king of the kingdom of Qin, Broken Sword, enters the chambers of His Majesty and begins a violent assault for which the king is well-equipped. The two men battle with a ferocious intensity, unencumbered by excessive slow-motion or flying effects, while huge tapestries of lime green plunge to the ground like majestic birds shot to their deaths. The scene has suspense, it has intensity, it has life...and unfortunately, that's the only time you'll find those things in the 96-but-feels-like-200 minutes of Hero.

  Which is kind of shocking, considering the movie starts out with such a promising fanfare. Against a slowly forming background, we learn of the history of China 2000 years ago: how it was divided into kingdoms, how they all fought with each other, and how one king attempted to bring it all to a close. Unfortunately, being a king and all, a lot of people want his ass dead, so the poor dude can't get any sleep. Finally, though, a nameless warrior ends His Majesty's worries by wiping out the three deadliest assassins and the king wants to hear his story. Nameless (Jet Li) proceeds, guided by a rather nice panoramic shot, to the chamber of the king and rests 100 paces from him, with the promise to advance paces at the king's behest. So he begins his story, and the framing device of the film is set up. If Hero had remained in that room with Nameless and the king, it would work. There is a message about honor, about duty, and about patriotism that arises from the film's present-tense frame that I found intriguing in parts. Of course, it would only last about 15 minutes if it did that, but as of now, I'd take that over the pure, shameless tripe that gets slung during the flashbacks.

  Hero is a perfect case of simply trying too hard. The first flashback of Nameless' murder of the first assassin, Sky, culminates in a dull battle overstuffed with relentless slow-mo, Matrix-esque bullet-time effects, and - but of course - Crouching Tiger flying. I don't have anything against martial arts; I think it's a compelling art that has created some enjoyable cinema. Director Zhang, though, doesn't seem to think that the existence of the violence itself is enough, though, and he insists on hampering it with special-effects flourishes, one after the other. It's tiring, uninspired, and - worse yet - kinda boring.

  The film moves on to the next stage of Nameless' quest, in which he must get rid of the last two assassins, lovers Broken Sword and Flying Snow. Slowly but surely, Hero reveals itself as what it truly is: an ultra-expensive movie that disguises its vapidity in a frame story with echoes of themes done 100 times before, and 100 times better in other movies. One of the more unnerving aspects of the film is its presentation of metaphors. Instead of subtle gestures that even a semi-stupid audience would get, things like ""music is like sword-fighting,"" and ""calligraphy is like sword-fighting"" are written into the script and said multiple times! Even the visual beauty of the film gets old: cinematographer Christopher Doyle (who so brilliantly photographed Phillip Noyce's Quiet American and Rabbit-Proof Fence) drenches the set pieces in a single color scheme for really no other point than to look pretty.

  And I'm sorry, call me old-fashioned, but this crap just comes across as silly. I'm not a huge fan of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but I don't really remember unintentionally laughing at some of the flying scenes. Ang Lee's film created that visual as a kind of extension of the characters' abilities: the characters of Tiger seemed so skilled that it just seemed logical that they could defy gravity. Hero just seems like it had extra money and some strings hanging around.

  There is a decent message (trite as it may be) hidden deep within the film, and when the plot opens wider into a Rashomon-like angle, Hero has brief moments of narrative intelligence. In fact, a scene following many of the flashbacks, in which an important revelation about the king's fate is made, is flat-out well-done. It's all lost, though, in the endless, pointless exercise of style that consumes the bulk of the film. Hero is far from heroic; it borrows from so many other movies, I'd go as far as to call it a wimp. C-",1098748800,20,4373,4.812
1890142,5,B00009RG46,"This film far exceeded my expectations. It is very deep on many levels. The astounding cinematography which uses beautiful displayes of colors for emotional content, hevenly scenery, and exquisite choreographed fighting. The fable like story telling which Poetically layers truth and reality, questions friendship, duty, and honor, and provides a glimps into chinese history. The blend of all of these elements makes the flim enjoyable on many levels.

  Beware spoilers in this paragraph. Some scenes I particularly enjoied where the battle with Sky in the ""chess house"" where they were playing ""Go"" which is a poetic foreshadowing of the battle that takes place in Nameless and Sky's mind. The fight in the leaves where the opponents rarely touch they just use there energy to force the leaves at each other. And the water confrontation.

  Now I just want to get something off my chest. I feel that the inclusion of Quentin Tarantino Presents tacked on to this film, and broadcast in all of the promotion is just blatant shameless advertising. I don't think it gives the creators there due respect by having Tarantino's name thrown out there like he had anything to do with the film being made. I love his films, but this is absurd. I've had several people come up and say ""Hey have you seen the new Tarantino movie?"" The same thing happended with The Iron Monkey. I think it is disrespecful to the creators.

Zhang Yimou and Christopher Doyle's collaboration on the visuals virtually make Hero a stunning picture book about ancient China. Add to that a narrative that's reminiscent of Rashomon, and you have a film that's both simple and complicated. Simple, since it is basically a one-act play wherein Nameless (Jet Li) walks up to the King of the Qin, a privilege he got after allegedly dispensing three notorious assassins, to tell his story of the events. Complicated since Nameless' version is different from the King's and it is revealed, layer by layer, that each assassin, including Nameless, have different agendas. Each subplot is profound and examines the theme of what it takes to be a hero and the sacrifices you have to make to be one (a theme also explored in Spiderman 2).

And it may be just me but there's also an underlying propaganda in the end when one must sacrifice his ideals for the good of many.

And just like a later Zhang Yimou period drama, House of Flying Daggers, Hero is at its most basic, a love story framed by the tumultuous period of the Seven Kingdoms.

All in all, Hero is highly recommended.",1098230400,8,1187,4.697115384615385
1890145,5,B00009RG46,"""Hero"" is written like a poem and sung like a ballad. It is at once simplistic yet complicated, dark yet dazzlingly beautiful. Far before Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was introduced to the Western theatrical world, a multitude of martial arts films abounded in SE Asia. ""Hero"" is the embodiment of the strength, savageness, and unsurpassed beauty that comes from the harmony built by body, mind and soul through years of practicing martial arts.

Jet Li steps back from his stereotypical Hollywood bash film to execute an unparalleled work of art. Combined with the commanding presence of Maggie Chung, his female counterpart, and the talents of Tony Leung and Zhang Ziyi, this is a fiercely acrobatic ballet only tangibly supplemented by a barely necessary sparse dialogue. Though set in Ancient China, the film is laced lightly over with distant facts which are used as the mere backdrop for the retelling of an epic.

The cinematography & choreography of this film are amazing. With every retelling of the story, the vivid color changes and panaromic sweeps inherent in each scene speak a thousand words on their own, giving the actors a masterful stage to play on. The fantastical and somewhat spiritual, supernatural tone of each scene is accentuated by the trademark Chinese martial arts wire work, giving the impression that the four main characters are no ordinary people, but fine artisans and such masters of their craft that they have transcended normal physical laws.

To fully appreciate this movie one has to recognize that ""Hero"" is about one thing: story telling. Any legendary story in any culture holds elements of the fantastical, the mythical, the unknown. ""Hero"" encompasses all of these elements and demonstrates the depth of human imagination.",1097798400,7,1768,5.153310104529616

This is the story of a Chinese hero (played by Jet Li) who is brought before the emperor to tell of his exploits.  The emperor doubts the original story the hero gives and gives his own interpretation of how events unfolded.  The hero then retells the correct story.

In other words, the story is told three times.  While this sounds like it Groundhogs Day reincarnated, it is far from that in that each version is completely different from each other and doesn't have you sitting there going, ""Oh, no, not again.""  The story grabs you and keeps you interested.  In fact, at the end of the movie I found myself wishing for more.

Over the past three years, we've been spoiled by the Lord of the Rings movies, but with that over, we'll just have to except the fact that there's not going to be another spectacular epic this December. So with LOTR gone, what will be the ""best movie of the year""? I think I found that out on August 27th with the release of Hero, a Chinese martial arts epic from the producer of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. I first discovered Hero in a preview before I Robot. My reaction was: ""Hey, that looks cool!"" Closer to the release date, I started to see articles in the paper discussing the movie, each making me more and more interested. Finally, on the 27th of August, I read the four-star review in the tribune, and decided to see it myself.

 Enough with that, on to my opinion. Hero is definitely the best movie since Return of the King, and if you pretend that wasn't made, it's the best movie of the century! The story, the visuals, the fights, it's more than you could ask for in a movie of any genera! To be polite, Hero completely blows Crouching Tiger, and Enter the Dragon (my other two favorite Martial Arts movies) 10,000 feet out of the water! (I won't ever bother comparing Hero to Hollywood trash like The Matrix.) Just a warning: if your dumb (like 99% of the population), this isn't the movie for you.

The fight scenes themselves are just so artistically orchestrated that you will be left in awe with unblinking eyes.

There are many reviews here that already talk about the plot of the film and so forth, so I mainly did this to give an opposing view on some points made by others, making it clear that I am a mere English speaker.

One review says that the Miramax English sub-titles are terrible in general. I would hope that he/she is not comparing it to the meagre offering presented in the official Chinese release DVD, which I own. The Miramax sub-titles are an IMMENSE imrpovement as  they show a far firmer grasp on English idiom. The Chinese release sub-titles read like an ESL book: short, unimaginative and vague. The only time it shows any sort of superiority is near the end where ""Our Land"" turns out to be the more literal (and more accurate) ""All Under Heaven""; and the closing sub-titles are much less cheesy and sentimental. However the Miramax sub-titles cannot be blamed for the fascist tones in the film: the plot and ending of the movie do that very well on their own. In addition, I saw no difference between the two version plot-wise: Miramax was indeed planning to change it, Tarantino protested, and it was left alone for the most part because Miramax stipulated that Tarantino's name had to be at the head of the credits, as you an see on the DVD cover. All this can be learnt at IMDB.

Additionally to say that the movie did not do well in North America is hilariously misguided: it debuted at No. 1 and stayed in that spot for two weeks. How many foreign, sub-titled ""indie"" films manage to do that?

I plan to buy this DVD as well...the movie is that good. :) The characters are interesting, the story is riveting and the cinematography is gorgous (and I don't usually notice such things).",1097280000,2,1937,4.507122507122507
1890152,4,B00009RG46,"*Hero* beautifully-filmed movie turned out to be one of the finer cinematic experiences I've subjected myself to in the last year. This is a state-sanctioned tale manages to more-or-less successfully fuse mythic history with post-modern storytelling in a manner that is occasionally jarring, but generally effective.

The plot itself is archetypal in its streamlined straightforwardness: a tyrant warlord has long feared three assassins, but one nameless hero from a little-known province has bested them one after another. By way of rewarding the industrious official and satisfying his own curiosity, the emperor invites the champion to court to tell his tale. The champion's stories comprise the bulk of the movie -- leaving the court visit to serve primarily as a loose frame for the majority of the narrative.

And here's where it gets tricky.

The hero episodically relates the circumstances of his three victories; and then the emperor -- having listened politely throughout the exposition -- decides that the hero is lying, and that he must be in cahoots with the assassins. Then the warlord proceeds to offer his own speculative version of the three victories. And THEN the hero counters the charge ... offering yet a THIRD version of the three victories which may or may not be the ""real"" way things went down. When I accused Hero of being a bit post-modern in its storytelling, this is what I meant: the device of the unreliable narrator is exploited to the fullest.

The third and final description of events comes across as the one most likely to be true. For one thing, the hero's final words on the subject are never challenged by the warlord king ... and for another, all the symbolism points our subconscious Magic Eight Balls towards ""Yes."" The actors are finally wearing white, implying that this version is the pure one; and there is a brief out-of-frame tie-in with the court events as we understand them.

All in all, I give the movie an A+ for style and a B for story. It wasn't perfect, and I have no doubt that the cultural disconnect between me and China stands in the way of potential deeper appreciation on my part, and that's fine. I got what I wanted from this movie, and I am comfortable recommending it to others.",1097193600,6,2245,4.866492146596858
1890153,5,B00009RG46,"Great film for reasons that have been stated numerous times over. However, the film , especially the Miramax version, which is the version you'll be getting when you're buying this film, is very propagandistic, given the China-Tawain situation. A thing to note about the Miramax release...the subtitles were done very poorly, and the MOST CRUCIAL translation of ""All Under Heaven"" was instead translated to ""Our Land""...big difference...the film did very poorly because of this in North America...and to the reviewer who said that the Chinese should quit the invisible ropes act...you must be american. This was a GENRE film and the conventions of ""swordsman"" films includes the ""weightless"" acrobatics you see. It's what makes the genre the genre and Chinese ""swordsman"" films what they are. If different cultures were to quit what they do just to be accepted more in the west, this world would be a boring place.

1890155,5,B00009RG46,"Hero is one of the most magnificent foreign films to come out in a very long time. In fact, I haven't found any I quite liked since Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (which you can't help but mention when discussing Hero).

Jet Li (y'know, the famous action dude) stars as the warrior Nameless, who was left without parents when he was very young. In the opening of the story, he is summoned to the Emperor to gather his rewards for killing three wanted assassins: Sky (played by Donnie Yen), Broken Sword (Tony Leung, of In The Mood For Love), and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung, of The Soong Sisters). There is also Broken Sword's young apprentice, Moon (Zhang Ziyi, of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon). But as the story develops, you learn there are many secrets being hidden. This is the type of film that tells the same story several times, only different in each version. Everyone has a different idea of what has happened.

The great thing about this film is that the ball gets rolling right away. As opposed to Crouching Tiger (which I did also like), there was not much character development. But in spite of this, you will still feel for them all and feel very attatched to certain ones. Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung both pull off amazing performances. I also love to watch the two of them fight. Leung is very precise in his movements, almost as if (as mentioned in the movie) he is writing calligraphy as opposed to fighting. Cheung moves very gracefully and is dressed in robes with long sleeves, which paints a beautiful portrait. Her fighting techniques almost seem to be dancing with swords rather than out to kill.

This film is highly recommended to any foreign film lover, any action film lover, and any Zhang Yimou fan. Zhang is one of my favorite directors, and this is an all-time masterpiece.",1096675200,4,1817,4.671875
1890156,5,B00009RG46,"Certainly the most visually beautiful film I've ever seen.  The Director's use of different color motifs for each version of the story was inspired.  It also presented us with an intelligent meditation on honor and bravery, and above all, 'rightness,' that is sorely lacking in today's world.  The love story was also quite moving.  Makes most other movies seems like a waste of film.  A masterpiece!",1096502400,2,400,5.0
1890157,3,B00009RG46,"""Hero"" is absolutely one of most beautifully filmed movies of ANY genre...EVER.  For that reason alone it is worth seeing, whether you are a fan of martial arts movies or not.

The use of colors as themes, indeed practically as supporting actors in their own right is absolutely awe-inspiring.  The movie becomes impressionist art brought to life, and a particularly dazzling life at that.  The action sequences are sublime (the highlight for me was perhaps too early in the movie when Jet Li and Donnie Yen squared off at the ""chess"" club during a rainstorm.  These are two professionals of unquestioned pedigree and ability that are always a joy to watch in any fight sequence; they have clearly outdone themselves in ""Hero""), and the wirework -while admittedly not to everyone's taste- is likewise inspired.

Comparisons to the Japanese classic ""Rashomon"" are justified, even though ""Rashomon"" is essentially multiple perceptions of the same act and ""Hero"", also told mainly in a series of flashbacks, is more similar to the ending of the home video version of ""Clue"" (most immediate example that comes to mind; obviously ""Hero"" is a far moe serious film than ""Clue""!).

My only problem is that the ending completely betrays the direction in which film was heading from the very beginning.  Without giving away the ending, it is simply not believable to me that someone who has dedicated so much of his life toward accomplishing a specific task would allow the certainty of his commitment to be questioned or even remotely compromised so easily.  I have noticed a rash of pacifism in mainstream martial arts films over the past few years (perhaps starting with Li Mu Bai's decision to hang up the Green Destiny sword in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and running through Hanbei Mizoguchi's pleas for non-violence in ""Samurai Fiction""), and frankly I find it rather unbecoming for the genre.  The title of ""Hero"" somewhat belies the decision of the protagonist, in my opinion.

""Hero"" shares some of the tragic Shakespearean elements of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""...and as a result both films are somewhat ""deeper"" in content than most martial arts movies, perhaps in an attempt to appeal beyond the typical cult audience and toward manistream moviegoers.  I'm not a class warrior or a movie snob enough to recoil in horror at the notion, but the soul of what makes these movies so enjoyable is somewhat compromised and that is somewhat disappointing if you have spent years watching the movies and developing your appreciation based on traditional martial arts film values.  Regardless of the action and effects and choreography that drop the jaw to the floor, the plot should have a resolution that is met with satisfaction within the viewer's soul.  And for THIS viewer, ""Hero"", though undeniably beautiful and almost certain to find a place on my shelf for its aesthetics alone, does not pass that test.  How unfortunate.",1096329600,6,2935,5.0476190476190474
1890158,3,B00009RG46,"A few other reviewers have touched on this, but I felt that, whatever its artistic merits might otherwise have been, the film was really tainted by its propagandistic message.  That message could hardly have been more obvious with respect to the Peoples' Republic of China's aims to re-absorb breakaway provinces like Hong Kong and Taiwan.  I thought it was particularly telling that the movie featured big Hong Kong movie stars like Jet Li, Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung, as if it were a direct message to the Hong Kong people to give up their dreams of autonomy for the ""heroic"" cause of unifying China, aka ""Our Country.""  As such, the film is all about submitting to paternalistic political authority.  The emperor, a brutally ambitious historical figure, is depicted here as a wise, sensitive, but misunderstood idealist who sheds a tear at the thought that one of the assassins spared his life for the noble cause of unification (gosh, all he really wanted was to bring people together . . . how sweet!)

Artistically, too, I thought that the film wasn't up to the best efforts of Yang Zhimou, such as ""Raise the Red Lantern.""  To me, it seemed a little unoriginal, as if it were a self-conscious blend of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"" and even a colorful dash of ""The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover"" thrown in.  For all of its stunning visual beauty -- and it was truly spectacular in this regard -- it seemed a little soulless, as if grabbing the mantle from ""Crouching Tiger"" and setting a new standard for artistic martial arts movies were perhaps its main aim.

But all that aside, it was still a worthwhile effort, and a beautiful film to watch.  The acting was terrific, and in my opinion, Maggie Cheung and Zhang Ziyi are two of the most ravishingly beautiful and affecting actresses in the world.  It would be worth it alone to see their jealous fight scene with swirling golden leaves, swooshing and clanging swords, and a stunning hue shift to blood red as the loser dies at the climax.  Wow!  Too bad so much of the overall effect was spoiled by the shameless political pandering.",1096243200,10,2132,4.732432432432432
1890159,5,B00009RG46,"As somebody else said,  this movie is about philosophy and spirituality.  It's also about romance.  I wish I had seen the original version,  since I heard it was better.

Anyway,  this is the kind of movie that will flow throughout your soul and leave you feeling changed when it's over,  if you're looking for a deep message.  The words are potent,  the colors show deep emotion,  the actors are fierce and the choreography is fantastic.  Of course the choreography is not supposed to be realistic.  It's artistic and flowing.  Want realistic?  See The Matrix.  Oh wait.. :P

My sister didn't like this film too much because she's a slow reader and doesn't have much of an attention span to begin with.  If subtitles are hard for you to deal with,  I think watching the movie a few times would help.  I know that I didn't catch ""every"" subtitle,  but I got the point of the story.

I only wish my TV were the size of a movie screen so I can see it again in it's full glory.",1095984000,5,974,4.359550561797753

1890161,4,B00009RG46,"This movie is about people from a province in China who want to overthrow the king who is from another province. This movie is set many hundreds of years ago.  Hero has great action sequences. The cinematography and mix of colors is visually stunning.  There is one scene where a lady is wearing red and when she falls, the leaves are orange and they turn red - it looks gorgeous!  There is this other scene where there are mountains and there is water, it looks like an oasis.

Hero was colorful, meaningful and had great character development. I liked the message of ""a world with no borders"" and the underlying message of peace. It would be great to relate that message to the whole world!",1095984000,5,692,4.512
1890162,3,B00009RG46,"Based on the cinematography and martial arts scenes, I'd give this movie five stars. I'm taking one off for the overly complex plot and another for the simplistic and heavy-handed propaganda of the film. Director Zhang Yimou, who also directed lesser known but equally artistic films such as Raise the Red Lantern, has had some of his prior films banned in his home country, China. The Chinese government has, on the other hand, embraced this one, which in my opinion is not necessarily something to commend it.

Although it takes place a long time ago, it is basically a propaganda piece for Chinese nationalism. Jet Li, the star of many popular martial arts films, plays a nameless warrior who has apparently defeated the emperor's most dangerous enemies. I say ""apparently"" because nothing in this movie is straightforward; the nameless warrior may be lying, as the emperor suspects. Several versions of the story are told, each placing the nameless warrior in a different light (literally, as well as figuratively, as everything is filmed in gorgeous colors that are like paintings come to life). After a while, I found this more confusing than intriguing, and I began to wonder how even the characters themselves could keep track of whose side they were really on. As for the fight scenes themselves, all involving swordplay, they are on a par with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, with warriors flying through the air and exhibiting superhuman abilities. In one scene, for example, two warriors fend off thousands of arrows with their swords. Any fan of martial arts should see Hero for this alone.

Hero is even more artistically filmed than Crouching Tiger, with the natural elements, such as water, leaves and the colors of the landscape  blended seamlessly into the action. This, of course, takes away any sense of realism, but the film is not meant to be realistic. Hero is really an extreme exercise in Romanticism, in every sense of the word. Romance between characters plays a large role, as between the two lovers Broken Sword and Snow. By the end, some of the tragic romance was a little excessive to me, but perfectly consistent with the tradition of Greek tragedies or Shakespeare.

It was the romanticizing of the nationalistic impulse that I found most objectionable. In the end, Hero flatly announces that dying for the sake of an empire is the most noble thing one can do. Of course, if you agree with this message, your reaction will be the opposite of mine. What really bothers me is the oversimplification of such a message. We are told that by uniting China into one great country, peace will be established. If you look at history, whether Chinese or any other, war and conflict goes on and on, no matter who is in power, and whether power is centralized or not. Hero takes place several centuries before Christ and is supposedly based on fact. The least bit of research can tell you how peaceful China was during the last two thousand years. So the film ultimately makes all its artistry, martial arts and romance subservient to a myth, and a very dangerous one at that. I could see a similar film being made on behalf of many tyrants throughout history.

I don't think it's unfair to judge a political film like Hero at least partly on its politics, though this is obviously subjective and others will like the very things I disliked. Aside from this, I found Hero to be a beautifully filmed martial arts movie, if at times overly complex and overwrought.",1095724800,32,3483,4.827470686767169
1890163,4,B00009RG46,"Hero is an extremely beautiful and compelling to watch.  The editing was superb and the fight scenes were spellbinding.  The plot, which in the beginning seemed too straight-forward, grew in layers as the story circled back & more details came to light.  Some have said that the wire-assisted helium-filled warrior fighting style has played itself out. I rather think that when done right it's like a floating ballet and I still enjoy it.

Nameless's motives only became more uncertain and ambiguous over time, so that his final flying leap at the end of the movie held enormous tension.  I held my breath (figuratively) because I couldn't tell where the film would lead.

This film really drew me in. The barrages of 10,000 arrows also were very compelling - and that was something new to the screen and a very powerful image.

But in the end Hero didn't leave a good aftertaste, because the purpose of this film is propoganda.  It's a big wet-kiss to the Chinese government.  It's meant to reinforce political unity, sort of like a 'Triumph of the Will' for the People's Republic.  That's a lousy analogy - there are no Nazis here - but I still felt like Zhang was making a political point and that he knocked me over the head with it and it felt uncomfortable.

Something like 'crush the individual, allow evil (the King's tyranny), if it's for the Greater Good'. O.K.. I actually disagree under most circumstances, and besides, one repetition instead of five would have been plenty.  In comparison with 'Crouching Tiger' which had a larger variety of themes, both romantic and personal, Hero felt like the less complex and less important film.  I think Zhang is a great filmaker, but this might not be his best work.

For fans of Jet Lee who want to see a similar (I think superior) film from his earlier career, see 'Once Upon A Time in China', a huge hit for him from 10 years ago that was recently released on DVD with English dubs and subtitles.",1095638400,6,1953,4.6725146198830405
1890164,5,B00009RG46,"The spectacle was great. (If you're not big on wuxia -- the credibility-bending bits where the warriors fly around -- it helps if you think of the story as mythology, which it is; accept that, then sit back and watch the interesting spectacle of two swordsmen jumping across the surface of a bright green lake.)

Other than the spectacle, what I found fascinating was the Taoism. There's a lot in this movie about the proper role of an assassin, the purpose of kings, the importance of a noble goal, the structure and order of society (especially reiterated in the ending) -- all very Taoist ideas. It's something I find a lot of people I've spoken to have missed completely because they don't know squat about the Tao. It amazes me that the nontheistic Chinese government allowed the director to get away with so much of it. You can actually use this movie as an introduction to that philosophy. Plus (and not to take anything away from the philosophy) it's a very cool action movie.",1095465600,7,984,4.655172413793103

If I wanted to read, I would have waited to order the book!",1095465600,2,254,3.9038461538461537
1890167,5,B00009RG46,"It will always remain beyond me how such a breathtaking work of art was both kept on the shelves for two years, killing its chances of wide Awards recognition, and sold off as a mindless, heartless action flick derived from the mind of Quentin Tarantino and the ""skill"" of Jet Li, rather then giving those who deserve most of the credit any notice (i.e. director Zhang Yimou, the beautiful and talented Maggie Cheung, the profound Tony Leung). Also, though the action doesn't surprise me, I'll forever be disappointed in the media's constant need to compare it with 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,' another martial arts film that is similar in nature, but not in structure, execution, or story.

Let's get that part straightened out: just because both 'Crouching Tiger' and 'Hero' are from the same nation, are both action-oriented films, and both include Zhang Ziyi in its supporting cast does not by any means make them at all comparable to each other. At each's core is an immensely different film. I will end this discussion of the two here, because I don't want to fall in that trap of irrelevant comparison as a cop-out.

'Hero' is first and foremost profound. Its imagery, characters, action sequences, and reality vs. internal portrayal storyline all interconnect with astounding cohesiveness, never separating from each other, working back and forth to create one of the best films of the year. Never once did I lose track of what the film was saying, or its nuanced emotional power. Most felt disconnected from it, but when you allow yourself to be embedded into the complexity of the human story (executed brilliantly with a finely crafted screenplay), 'Hero' immediately becomes three-dimensional, unfolding into something much more than an on-the-surface, mediocre war drama.

If you happen to find Foreign films abysmal, forcing you to concentrate a bit too hard for your tastes, still take the time to see 'Hero.' It is most famous for its equally deep imagery. You know you're seeing something mind blowing and revelatory when a character's robes blowing in the wind are as accurately choreographed as Maggie Cheung fending off a barrage of arrows.

What further elevates 'Hero's standing as a great film is its precise and intelligent use of its beauty. It is not simply appealing to the eye for the sake of having astounding visuals. The colors work into the story, changing as its two central characters, Nameless (Jet Li) and the King of Quin (Daoming Chen), reflect on their own interpretations of Nameless' explanation as to how he defeated three notorious assassins --Broken Sword (Tony Leung), Long Sky (Donnie Yen), and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung)-- that have been out for the King's blood for years after he had massacred their people. The colors --red, blue, green, and white-- not only distinguish the separate versions visually, but also distill each's emotional foundation, causing the experience of watching this film to be much more involving.

I should not focus too much on the imagery, however. If you enter the film concentrating on the visuals alone, you may risk distraction, ultimately ruining this particular cinematic experience. I highly recommend this film, but I advise those who are interested to keep its themes of inner conflict, abuse of power, and the hindrance of paranoia in mind. Luckily, Zhang Yimou has done such a fantastic job honing, polishing, and crafting this film, processing it may not be too difficult for some. The combination of this subtle emotional power, Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung's masterful performances, Yimou's heartfelt direction, and Christopher Doyle's finely detailed cinematography proves to be one of the most satisfying, memorable, and epic experiences I've had at the theater in years.",1095379200,4,3769,5.121951219512195
1890168,4,B00009RG46,"I admit, I didn't like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  In general, I'm not impressed with fake martial arts.  The flying, the mystery, all seems wasteful to me.  Bulletproof Monk and the Jackie Chan movie Medallion left me wanting.  Typically, if you deliver ""real"" fighting that is ""possible"" in the sense that computers are not involved.

However, for the first time, I liked a movie that had computer ""assisted"" fighting sequences.  One of the reasons is the are limited, and the fight sequences in general are not really about fighting, but something more.  Hero is a movie about the past.  Somewhere between now and later the present no longer is history but becomes legend.  Or so says the LOTR people.

See this movie.  It touches on love, honor, and beauty.  This flick itself is a work of art, and the most expensive movie ever made in China.  The least you could do is see it.",1095120000,6,887,4.681818181818182
1890169,4,B00009RG46,"The inevitable comparison for the movie Hero is to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  The question arises - is this one as good?  The answer, sadly, is no.  But perhaps that is an unfair comparison.  CTHD is one of my favorite movies.  Hero has a completely different feel.  In terms of art direction, Hero may even be superior.  There are some scenes in here that are literally breathtaking.  For instance, the girl-on-girl fight amongst the autumn leaves.  The main difference is that Crouching Tiger had a stronger, more traditional plot.  Hero tries to be the martial arts Rashomon - with different versions of the same story repeated over and over.  Even the fight scenes are a bit problematic.  They are great wire-fu, but they are somewhat unmotivated.  We cut to fights in the middle without seeing their beginnings or ends.

This is a long movie.  If you are not a hard-core Asian/Martial Arts movie fan, you may want to wait for this on home video.  If you are a fan of Eastern Cinema, it is highly recommended.",1095120000,6,1019,4.704545454545454

To be sure, the fight choreography and camera work are superb - the visuals of lone martial arts warriors facing off against veritable armies of soldiers and archers are breath-taking. The mixing of violence against a back-drop of lush natural environments is likewise stunning. However, what surprised me was the depth of the plot, and the message/moral at the end of the movie, which is NOT typical of most martial arts movies. Right up there with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - and in some ways superior. Go see it!",1095120000,3,638,4.862385321100917
1890171,4,B00009RG46,"""Hero"" is the apocryphal story of the uniting of warring kingdoms in Asia into the country of China.  Three assassins who have sought to murder the king have themselves been murdered by the Nameless warrior (Li).  Now, Nameless is brought before that king (Daoming) to be rewarded for his heroic deeds.  While there, he recounts the tales of his battles with these assassins, and then the king offers another perspective on things that turns everything that has gone before on its head.

""Hero"" is an interesting movie that will not appeal to everyone.  It is in many ways reminicent of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", but also very different.  Filled with vibrancy and color, every frame of this movie is amazing to look at.  It is very easy to get lost in the images presented by director Zhang Yimou.  The fight scenes are beautifully choreographed and surreal.  Utilizing the ""Wire-fu"" first seen be American audiences in ""Crouching Tiger"", the characters leap and spin with no regard for gravity or any laws of physics.  The story itself seems straightforward, until the king offers a possible alternative for the way things actually happened.  Then, the movie takes a number of twists and turns that are mostly satisfying.

""Hero"" is not your typical action movie, and I cannot recommend this movie for everyone.  That being said, I think that this movie could be a pleasant surprise for some people looking for something a little different.",1095120000,9,1449,4.962655601659751
1890172,4,B00009RG46,"Hero is a beautiful and stunning film. The cinematography is outstanding. And just seeing the landscapes of the Chinese countryside are breath-taking.

I have to admit for me the story was alittle hard to follow. The subtitles moved alittle to fast in places, and I missed some of it. In certain scenes I may have been looking at the beautiful

landscapes and just missed the subtitles. And the same story is told in three different versions so it does not flow continuously.

The special effects were also amazing. And these were done in such a way that they added to the beauty of the film.",1094774400,2,592,4.619047619047619
1890173,4,B00009RG46,"HERO was originally released in Asia in 2002 under the title YING XIONG. The film stars Jet Li as a fighter and local lawman known as Nameless. The movie takes place in ancient times when the country of China did not yet exist and was simply a broken nation of seven different kingdoms. The King of Qin is a wise and mighty ruler and is determined to unite the warring kingdoms into one country. Nameless is sent to the King after it is known that he has killed three assassins, two men and one woman, who have tried to murder the King before. Nameless tells his story and a battle of wits ensues as the story is revised several times.

There is some pretty darn cool sword fighting that takes place in HERO and the visual imagery is stunningly beautiful. The plot device of retelling the story several times makes the film more interesting than if it was a simple straightforward tale and the slow character development of Nameless and King that builds before our eyes augments the other positive aspects of the movie.

However, HERO is a movie and simply as a movie, it's not as good as it could have been. For example, some of the action sequences are drawn out way too long and come off as being cheesy (many in the theatre I attended laughed at some of the most serious battle sequences in the film). Also, because the story is retold several times, viewers can easily become confused and disinterested. As a work of art though, HERO is magnificent and is worth watching just to admire its beauty. Appreciate it for what it is and nothing more.",1094774400,,1549,4.48936170212766
1890174,5,B00009RG46,"I saw this production in a theatre, in TAIWAN.  Thankfully, they did offer it with English subtitles (I have never been a fan of dubbing).  And it was phenomenal.  Forget ""Crouching Tiger..."" this story is based on actual history... but forget that as well and just sit back and enjoy an elemental film with stunning visual (non-CGI) effects and incredible acting that is not limited by the language it was filmed in.

Don't watch this if you are expecting a glossed, over-hyped, hollywood-style action film.  You won't get it.  There is too muuch STORY to this film and all the action supports that story.

This is a perspective film and its use of colours to isolate and unite the segments is truly lovely.  This is storytelling with a strong visual impact.

I'd love to see it in the theatre again.  But since that is not an option... and I cannot purchase the coded DVDs here, I will eagerly await its US/Code 1 release... hopefully with special features in English.",1094688000,2,970,4.686390532544379
1890175,5,B00009RG46,"""Hero"" has been getting a bad rap as an inferior version of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" but except for being of the same genre, ""Hero"" is as visually stunning, intelligently presented and much more story-oriented; therefore less martial arts driven, than its much-vaulted predecessor.

Even though I am a great fan of the Ang Lee film, ""Hero"" is, in many ways, the more intense, more complicated and an even more physically gorgeous film. I particularly admire director Yimou Zhang's use of color as a way to propel the story forward: color as a narrative as well as a design device.

The plot is told in several versions with different characters giving their version of the story, ""Rashomon"" style. Nameless (Jet Li) is the catalyst for all of the action and the transcendent Ziyi Zhang (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) and Maggie Cheung (In the Mood for Love) add beauty and class to the proceedings.

""Hero"" is a gorgeous film, breathtaking in its visuals and unique storytelling and a triumph for all concerned.",1094601600,2,1021,4.95906432748538
1890176,4,B00009RG46,"This is an excellent movie. As most people probably know, it is a movie that has actually been out for quite some time. When I first saw the previews in the theatre, I thought they were going to dub it in English for a North American release, however, it turned out to be subtitled. It's better this way since it's awkward when the dialog and voice doesn't match the actor or actress. It was the same for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.

I've heard a lot of complaints from people expecting more action. I think this movie has a good balance of plot and action as well as outstanding cinematography. The movie tells 3 versions of a set of events. The initial lie told by Jet Li's character to the emporer, the emporer's guess of what actually happened, and the actual story. The only fault in this approach is that 2/3 of the movie is spent telling events which did not actually occur. However, that didn't bother me too much. The fighting scenes were well choreographed. One weird thing was that 'tian xia' (our land), had so many strokes and took so long to write!

As for the casting, Zhang Ziyi is great although I would've liked to see her more in a starring role. Jet Li is perfect for the part. And Tony Leung Chiu-Wai is always better as an actor than a singer.",1094515200,5,1269,4.418803418803419
1890177,5,B00009RG46,First of all people need to understand or have some concept of the chinese culture before they can really understand this movie. This is truly a beautiful story of sacrifices made for the love of two people as well as the love of a country. The intrigue comes in when the viewers have to figure out which of the tale is the truth. Overall the story unfolds in a flurry of cinematographic magic and martial arts fantasy.,1094428800,4,419,4.454545454545454
1890178,5,B00009RG46,"Like many other reviewers, I was exposed to this movie through the Chinese DVD release. I was speechless with the art direction and the photography of ""Hero"". It ranks as one of the most beautiful movies ever made. The way the colors that prevail on a scene are in sync with the scene's mood, is not subtle, but it is impeccable and tasteful. In addition to this, the way Tun Dun's music once more is integral to the story shows how deep of an artistic relationship the director, Yimou Zhang, and the composer developed.

While I can see how some people may find some of the fighting scenes a bit unrealistic, that doesn't take away from its brilliance and how artistic they are. In this movie we're being exposed to a different culture, one where honor, tradition and denial of instant gratification are above all things: something for us as Western people to learn from.",1094256000,6,872,4.625806451612903

If only other movies could be as beautiful as this one.  This is much more than a fighting movie it is a piece of film ART!  I don't know if it has been or will nominated for an Oscar but it should just for the visuals alone!

A must see!",1094256000,4,464,3.935483870967742
1890180,5,B00009RG46,"Well, this is one of those movies where everyone who gives it a positive review is bound to say exactly the same thing, but I'll go ahead and review it anyway. Simply put, this is the most visually striking film I've ever seen with some astounding action scenes, while still having an interesting plot and strong emotional impact. That is about as strong of an endorsement as I can imagine.

Despite it's various points of interest, the visual splendor of the film is certainly the most impressive aspect.  As I said before, this is the most beautiful film I've ever seen. Frankly, little I can think of comes at all close.  Visually, it works on all levels. It has stunning, varied landscapes ranging from snowy mountains to forests in autumn to desolate, rocky steppes and great deserts filled with sand dunes.  Personally, I seem have less appreciation for natural landscapes than most, yet every outdoor landscape in this film is awe-inspiringly beautiful.  The costumes are outstanding as well, with deep, pure colors.  Beyond this, the film uses color beautifully in general, with most scenes having a dominant color in character and landscape, which changes from Red to Blue to Green to White and so on.  This use of color also fills the film with an appropriate sense of surreality, befitting the supernatural and occasionally parable-esque nature of the film.  The film also contains the strange beauties of military formations. There are awe-inspiring shots of the endless ranks with their fluid symmetries, scenes of cavalry riding through the windswept desert and the frightful volleys of arrows. Despite not being a war movie this has the finest visualization of ground forces that I've ever seen, surpassing even the extraordinary The Thin Red Line. (In terms of aesthetic beauty, not realism, of course)  Naturally, this is all beautifully shot, with tons of extreme longshots, which wonderfully showcase the beauty of both the human and inhuman portions of the scene.  On top of this, the action scenes are fantastic.  Personally, I consider the fight between Nameless and Sky at the beginning of the film to be one of the finest 1 on 1 fights I've ever seen.  The fight between Moon and Flying Snow in the leaf strewn forest is also particularly extraordinary, albeit more for the scenery than for the fight choreography.  The only minor misstep is the fight at the lake in the mountains, which is fine except that it repeats itself a bit too much.  There are many who are opposed to wire-work and the use of CG and whatnot, and those sorts will likely have issues with the fights found here.  Indeed, the action scenes here are usually as much art film as they are action film, and most of them are so wildly stylized that purists won't care for them. So consider yourself warned, not that you needed to be had you seen any ads for the film.  I suppose I could go on and on about how this film looks, but I could never hope to give you a true sense of how fantastic this film looks. Just see it yourself.

Unlike many films with such an emphasis on visuals and action-scenes, this film has interesting characters and a well developed plot.  I could go into specifics, but suffice to say that it managed to retain hold my interest from beginning to end, the ending of the film is genuinely sad, and every significant character in the film is sympathetic in their own way, even though they may be at odds with one another.  This is as much as you could ask for from a purely dramatic film, much less a martial arts film.  Some people have found this film a bit confusing, as it is primarily told via flashbacks,  which may or may not have actually occurred.  Personally, I wasn't confused, and at worst you will likely be lost only briefly if ever.  And the plot isn't the main interest in the film anyway.

Some have complained of the pro-communist elements of this film, but I can honestly say as one who strongly opposes communism both as it exists hypothetically and practically that this doesn't bother me at all.  Most significantly, it is mainly implicitly pro-communist, in that it is patriotic and pro-China as an idea rather than specifically supporting the communist government.  Beyond, little that is in the film specifically applies to communism in a way that wouldn't apply to most other societies.  At it's heart, it simply promotes  peace and self-sacrifice for the common good, both of which are valued in pretty much all societies, and are qualities which I can readily support.

Well, that's it. This is one of the finest films I've ever seen, so you ought to go see it.",1094169600,5,4606,4.7368421052631575
1890181,4,B00009RG46,"This is one of the few movies of 2004 that I want the DVD of. This one has much more artistry than the average movie. I don't understand it yet. Apparently there are alternate realities where the characters take different paths in each reality and have different experiences. An example being how the character ""Snow"" kills people multiple times, apparently as if they weren't killed the first time. But I don't think the movie is just one reality. The whole film is very abstract and beautiful. The only thing I would change is the fact that the original actors and actresses didn't dub their lines in English. It's kind of distracting to try and watch it and read the words at the same time.",1094083200,2,693,4.596774193548387
1890182,5,B00009RG46,"I started off my day watching ""Spider Man"", cause I was in that mood to see ""Spider Man 2"" again, but I decided to see ""HERO"". Besides I've been waiting for this film sense 2002 when the Academy nominated it for Best Foreign Film. My mother and I wanted see it, because we thought it was going to be another martial arts film. And I bet that's the way the rest of America felt.

I was thinking ""Okay another Jet Li film, nothing to worry about, I mean think about it. ""Lethal Weapons 4"", ""Black Mask"", I mean Jet Li hasn't done good movies. Man was I WRONG. This film is probably the best film of the year. The colors of the characters clothes tell us which story is real or fake. The story is told from more than one point of view. You can't tell which story is real until the ending, an ending that I will not spoil.

The fight scenes are the best I've seen sense ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" Infact this film is better than ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", the fight scenes is  the story beneath the story, not like ""The Matrix Trilogy"" that has mindless, mindless action and not enough dialogue.

I'm not going to spoil anything about this film. I will always see why people would say ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is way better than ""Hero"", I mean that film was a milestone in martial arts, but ""Hero"" is done in a different way, a better way.  This film is so beautiful its scary. I almost threw up seeing the beauty of this film, I wanted to pause the film so I can contemplate on what I just saw. Of course I'm still wondering which story was real or fake, but that's just a minor flaw. I LOVE THIS FILM.

P.S. I forgot to give credit to Zhang Yimou and Zhang Ziyi. Yimou, you are one of the best directors in the business. Ziyi, you are a great actress.",1093824000,5,1771,4.271641791044776
1890183,5,B00009RG46,"Despite being billed as being from Quentin Tarantino, Zhang Yimou's ""Hero"" (original title: ""Ying Xiong"") is more ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" than ""Kill Bill."" Visually rich, stunningly action-packed, and beautifully made, ""Hero"" is a unique film that takes the soul and senses on a rollercoaster ride.

Ancient China (third century B.C.) was divided into seven kingdoms, and the most powerful lord was the King of Qin (Chen Dao Ming). He wants to unite China under his own rule. But he lives in fear of his life, most particularly from a trio of deadly assassins: ""Broken Sword"", ""Flying Snow"" and ""Long Sky"" (Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung, Donnie Yen).

Then a man called Nameless (Jet Li) arrives, announcing that he has somehow killed them. How could he have killed three incredibly powerful warriors? Not just by his impressive martial arts skills, but through his cunning as well. He uses jealousy, calligraphy, and his wits to defeat them. But the king is not convinced that Nameless is telling the whole truth, and concocts a version of his own. A game of wits starts to form between the mysterious warrior and the wily king. What is the truth behind Hero's story?

""Hero"" follows in the footsteps of ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon."" And while it doesn't cover much new ground in the fantasy martial arts area, it's a magnificent and awe-inspiring film. But despite all the wire-fu, ""Hero"" dips into an area that ""Crouching Tiger"" didn't -- it draws heavily on Akira Kurosawa's classic ""Rashomon,"" by giving us different versions of the same story. What is the truth? That is left blurred, and eventually the people who tell the stories are more important than the truth.

Zhang Yimou creates a film where style overcomes the realistic, full of color and scenery and beauty. People slash off hundreds of oncoming arrows and leap through walls of droplets -- just try doing that in the real world. The fight scenes are, simply put, balletic. They fight while suspended over a lake as their swords dip through the water, fight to music, battle in a swirl of fallen leaves. But none of this jars the viewer if they remember that in this film, the style and beauty of the action is what makes it effective.

Jet Li and Chen Dao Ming give the best performances of this film -- they both portray intelligent, suspicious men who are playing a strange game of truth and deception. Their back-and-forth conversations are entrancing. The three assassin actors, as well as the wonderful Zhang Ziyi, are given secondary roles, but do an excellent job of imbuing them with little hints of humanity.

Zhang Yimou's first foray into the martial arts genre is a roaring success. It lacks the freshness of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" but it stands firmly on its own feet with a beautifully intricate story and amazing action scenes. A must-see.",1093824000,8,2841,4.896049896049896
1890184,5,B00009RG46,"I feel like I have been waiting a long time to see this movie and that the trailer for ""Hero"" (""Ying xiong"") has been teasing us for at least a year.  I have to admit that I fully expected to see an epic full of battle scenes and massed armies of men.  My mistake.  This film from China is a pointed fable, distilled from legend that may well be myth, and with a point that may well be lost on Western audiences.  This is clear from those viewers who are unwilling to accept the conventions of wire work in Chinese martial art pictures and whose standard of realism refuses to allow for the poetic ballet of combat.

The prologue makes it clear that this story takes place in China before it was China, when the land was made up of seven warring provinces and the King of Qin (Chen Dao Ming) dreamt of conquering the other six provinces and uniting the land.  For years the king has been unable to have a peaceful night of sleep because there are three assassins who are out to kill him.  Now comes a nameless warrior (Jet Li), who has come to the imperial court to be rewarded for killing the three unbeatable assassins.  He is warned that he may not approach within 100 paces of the king or he will be killed.  But because he has bested the assassin Sky (Donnie Yen) in combat, he is allowed with 20 paces to tell his story.

Most of the story of ""Hero"" is told in flashback as Nameless tells his stories and the king questions him.  We also learn of the fates of Broken Sword (Tony Leung) and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung), two assassins who were also a pair of lovers.  But there is more than one truth and more than one tale to be told in this film.  Director Zhang Yimou, improving on the artistry we first enjoyed in ""Raise the Red Lantern,"" color codes the stories that we see.  First the story is told in lush shades of red, then in cool blue, again in white, and finally in green.  Drops of water and swirling yellow leaves all become parts of the dances of death during the fight sequences, captured by cinematographer Christopher Doyle.  ""Hero"" is a gorgeous film that uses its saturated colors better than any film of recent memory.  There is a code to the colors, but that is something you need to come to terms with on your own.

Another strength of this film is that the fighting (choreographed by Wei Tung) and special effects do not overwhelm the actors who are required to play what is on some level the same scene as slightly different characters.  I know there are computer generated effects in this film, especially since there are more arrows shot in ""Hero"" than any film in history, but for once I did not get the feel that what I was seeing was not real.  That is become this film keeps coming back to questions of aesthetics, from the breathtaking use of color to the eloquent idea that swordsmanship and calligraphy are intrinsically awaited.

Special mention has to be made of the music, composed by Dun Tan and featuring violin solos and fiddling by Itzhak Perlman along with drumming by the Japanese group Kodo.  I have never really seen one of those Hong Kong kung fu movies where everyone screams while they fight and I might never get around to it given the silent eloquence of the fights in movies like ""Hero"" (not to mention ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""), where the moments are underscored by the sound of clashing swords, pounding drums, and a violin.  ""Hero"" is an art film, albeit one made on a larger and more colorful canvas.

""Hero"" may be sold as being a big film but it is really about something relatively plain and simple.  I disagree with the idea that either the style or substance of the film is beyond our Western sensibilities.  Apparently the reason the film has the ""Quentin Tarantino Presents"" tag at the start was so that Miramax would not cut 20 minutes of the film out on the pretext that it too Asian/confusing for Western audiences.  Indeed, I have seen some critics who professes to be confused about the complex plot and I can only wonder if they were equally confused by ""Rashomon,"" an obvious reference point to this one (in many ways Yimou owes more to Akira Kurosawa's classic film than to Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"").  Certainly after a century of cinema we are capable to looking at the same thing from multiple perspectives and enjoying this gem of a film that has finally made its way to our shores.",1093824000,299,4385,4.481761006289308
1890185,5,B00009RG46,"I didn't like this film for its special effects (same effects that were in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and not a lot of it either) but more for its message. It's extremely political as it goes to the heart of a conflict that happened thousands of years back in China when the Emperor was trying to unite the seven states under his rule.

The core of the film is death; in particular, the death of four characters that all choose their own demise to make a statement. There are four statements made in this film and they all have political parallels today. One of the statements made is: Unite Our Land. Such message, come to think of it, doesn't bode well for Taiwan.

The moral of the story is that heroes exist on both sides of any conflict. In today's politics, that's an all too familiar concept as one people's ""freedom fighter"" is another people's ""terrorist"" and one nation's ""martyrs"" are another nation's ""suicide bombers.""

This film will definitely get you thinking. I recommend it.",1093824000,53,996,4.68
1890186,5,B00009RG46,"This is a movie that hits you on every possible level, emotionally, visually, aurally - nearly every sense is engaged.

Rarely has a director's use of color to capture and frame action and emotion succeeded as magnificently as does Yimou Zhang in ""Hero.""  Told through a sequence of four strongly defined acts within a framing device of narrative sequences between the King of Qin (Daoming Chen) and Nameless (Jet Li) each act presents a different spin on how Nameless (Hero) conquered the three most feared would be assassins of the King, becoming the only man garnering trust and honor enough to come within 10 paces of the fearful of his life ruler.  Zhang imbues each act with a distinctive and explosive yet marvelously controlled palette:  Red, White, Blue, and Green, each setting the emotional tone, advancing the physical drama, the resultant effect a marvelous achievement combining art and action.

As stunning as Hero is visually as a story its actors must pull their own and here Zhang is blessed with an ensemble up to the difficult challenges presented them in a deceptively simple tale.  I cannot praise highly enough the work each brings to the film lending even further to the feeling of luxuriousness Zhang has imparted into every frame.

Throughout its four Rashomon-like sequences, each actor takes on divergent motivations to achieve their actions altering personalities while simultaneously maintaining the centrality essential to their established characters. In this regard, Tony Leung Chiu Wai (Broken Arrow), Maggie Cheung (Flying Snow), and Ziyi Zhang (Moon), with Messrs. Lee and Chen present a formidable acting ensemble.

Greater challenge is given to each as Hero, necessarily offers little opportunity exists for traditional character development.  In spite of that challenge Zhang's cast exceeds every imposed limitation and create fascinatingly complex characters who become easy to care for as they go about the business of breaking our hearts.

As deeply felt - and as integral - as the emotional content, Hero's action sequences are executed with a combination of old world bravado and new age technology that is - quite literally - breathtaking.  The scenes of Qin's army -thousands of them - in battle, marching or surrounding the palace, is overwhelming in its sheer manpower.

Hand-to-hand combats, with their Shaolin priest inspired feats of flying up walls, atop lakes or through the air are nothing short of spectacular, their stylized violent images ravishing and the most beautiful in an already staggeringly striking film.

Entwined throughout is a nationalistic tale of disparate warring factions unifying to become one China.  Unfortunately many have misconstrued the film's message comparing sublimation and sacrifice of individual will for the greater good, with Hitler's plan for a master race.  Nothing could be further from truth and spirit of this remarkable film.

We left and the theater manager kindly gave us our manager back.  It is worth noting that a male adult, female adult, and two children all disliked this movie.

Here is what I thought made it so poor.  To begin with, the subtitles flashed on the screen quite quickly.  I am a fast reader and barely made it through them before they were gone.  The type face they were in seemed hard to read to me.

Where this movie really lost me was in the much vaunted fight scenes.  It was ludicrous.  These people were standing sideways on porch railings, hanging upside down from the edges of a roof, and leaping 30 feet.  When you kick someone, they to do not two two backflips and land 20 feet away.

Some people describe this as beautifully choreographed.  I call it, fake, unrealistic, and so far-fetched that it made the entire movie more ridiculous than a cartoon.

Why? Watching it was like reading ""A National Party No More"", like watching a Bush-hater convert to the other side. Strange, but true. Consider.

Assassins bent on killing the tyrant Emperor Qin, whose goal is to unite and bring peace to ""Our Land"" - actually a genteel mistranslation of ""All Under Heaven."" Similar to charges of imperialism leveled at the ""House of Bush"". All the assassins are united and motivated by their hatred. And, it would seem, rightly so, their families/peoples having suffered losses under the Emperor's grand vision.

However, along the way, a couple of them have second thoughts, after understanding the Emperor and his aims, and getting a glimpse of his wisdom. Who is steadfast in hatred? The woman, in unpolitically correct fashion paralleling the ""girlie men"" derided by the Governor of California. The irrational feminine animus who refuses to reconsider, refuses to let go of raw hatred.

Every little detail about the movie, from color to the drops of water has significant detail.

From a philosophical point of view, Hero draws SOME comparison to Akira Kurosawa's ""Rashomon."" This movie DOES pack alot of moments that require sincere and careful thought! The use of color and the brilliant cinematography had my eyes glued to the screen throughout the movie. The musical score blends perfectly with each scene, as if the instruments were making love to each lush background (I know that sounds corny, but hey? You'll know what I mean when you see the film!)

There's no other way to describe this movie except as a VISUAL, POETIC delicacy. So much symbolism and beauty is hidden behind each spoken and unspoken word.

It would take a retard to truly NOT appreciate this film. It sickens me to know that the society we live in today is so shallow, that the only way they can enjoy a movie is if it's back with half naked chicks and explosions.

After seeing ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Iron Monkey"", both incredible movies, I've realized that this genre has some really excellent work and now this movie, starring Jet Li, can be added to the list.  Though ""Crouching Tiger"" is still my favorite, this film is completely amazing and has some of the most beautiful imagery I've seen on film.  Whether it be a ""shower of arrows"" or golden leaves whirling around two fighters, this movie uses small things and turns them into a complete treasure for the eye.  Even color is used like a secondary character in this film.  I think this is one of the most stylized films I have seen in the last few years and Hollywood should take note.

Jet Li was really good---this is the first film I've seen him in.  After seeing ""Hero"", I'll have to check out some of his other work in Chinese cinema.  Maggie Cheung is a beautiful actress and I hope to see more of her.  The rest of the cast do nicely in their roles, a couple of them also cast members from ""Crouching Tiger"".

If for nothing else, you'll enjoy the look of this film.  But luckily for the viewer, there is more than that---a good story, great fighting sequences, a passionate love story.

Virtually every scene in this film is a marvel, but some stand out in particular -- two female warriors fighting amidst swirling leaves which symbolically turn from yellow to red; Nameless battling the first assassin in the falling rain, with the tip of a sword driving forward through a crystalline raindrop; the two green-clad assassin lovers battling through hundreds of the king's monochromatic legions, a martial dance of perfect athleticism and deadliness; Flying Snow using her vibrant orange robe to deflect hundreds of arrows in the attack on the caligraphy school; and my favorite, the scene where Broken Sword and Nameless do battle on the surface of a pristine emerald lake, gracefully running across the placid water surface, an enrapturing tranquillity barely disturbed by the loud ringing of clashing steel.

So beautiful.

The sound in this movie is also outstanding. It is my belief that great sound is an unfortunately undervalued commodity in film making, but ""Hero"" is a visceral sonic experience to complement the stunning visuals.

I found the story and the style of narrative interesting. Nameless, a warrior with preternatural fighting prowess, earns an audience with the evil king for defeating three powerful assassins. The story unfolds in a series of flashbacks as Nameless relates the events, and each story is like a self-contained chapter, again and again offering one exquisite scene after another.

Although I was bothered by the ideological stance of the film, it didn't do much to diminish the pleasure experienced while watching it. Hopefully it doesn't bother people -- it's not like this movie is going to turn you into a communist, unless you're an idiot in the first place. I found the ending of the movie very tragic (mostly for Flying Snow, who is essentially betrayed twice in her quest for justice). Communist movies can have emotional resonance (and I'm an anarchocapitalist, so trust me).

Just enjoy the beauty of it all.",1093737600,3,2163,5.221902017291066

The visual cinematography, dynamic martial arts sequences, riveting acting and overall presentation surpasses Crouching Tiger and any other martial arts movie ever made.

Who would have thought that the political intrigue behind the unification of China could be vividly portrayed and woven so intricately with the characters' struggles on a macrocosmic and microcosmic level.

This movie compels one to question more than ""Who is a hero and what are his/her characteristics?""  This movie is thought-provoking on varying levels, such as:

(1) What truly motivates one to action? Anger? Revenge? Love? Hope?;

(2)For those who practice the martial arts, to what extent is one's practice?  Merely on a physical level, emotional level or on a transcendental level?

(3) And most importantly, from a universal perspective, one cannot refute that the struggle between love and hate (of self and others) is akin to that of war and peace...for both require pain and sacrifice.

Parallels, imagery, action, intrigue--all combine to form what I believe to be one of the best movies ever made.  Indeed, this movie is a masterpiece!",1093737600,4,1368,5.291666666666667
1890199,5,B00009RG46,"First off, this movie is way better than Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  The fact that it is based on a legend in China makes it even better.  Some of the most amazing directing and fight scenes I have ever seen.  The fighting is about 95% with swords (Kung Fu wasn't invented until many centuries later) but it is spectacular nonetheless.

Jet Li is a warrior who supposedly has killed three assasins who were trying to kill the emperor.  As a reward, he is invited to the emperor's home (it is not really a palace but a big building) and allowed to approach the emperor within 10 paces (nobody else may come within 100 paces).

He is given riches and must tell the tale how he disposed of the 3 assasins.  The tale is told 3 different ways.  Each time the director uses different colors.  First, yellow and red, then green, and finally white.  Each story is very different.  The tension builds to a highly climatic and unexpected ending.

Not to be missed!",1093651200,4,958,4.505813953488372
1890200,5,B00009RG46,"I have seen this film on dvd and have enjoyed it ever since, but now --- thanks to Quentin Tarantino --- I've been given the chance to see Zhang Yimou's film where it should be seen: on a big-screen theater.

Hero is one of those rare films that transcends its genre roots. In simplest terms, Yimou's epic is nothing but a kung fu film. Where Yimou's film excels and exceeds its predecessors is in its use of the color palette. Hero's use of vibrant solid colors to represent a certain sequence of events and point of view is surpassed only by Akira Kurosawa's classic Shakesperean samurai epic Ran. As in Kurosawa's classic, Yimou infuses the screen with vibrant colors to tell a story of love, vengeance and in the end, the true meaning of heroism. Hero's scenes burst with color. From the solid crimson that dominates the Calligraphy School sequence to the solid colors of red, turquoise, yellow, etc.. on the characters costumes. Just the use of color alone makes Hero a must-see film for students of film and cinematography.

Yimou's film owes alot of its narrative to Kurosawa's other Shakespearean samurai classic Rashomon. His film tells the events detailed by Jet Li's character, Nameless, to the Emperor Qin of China through flashbacks. Each telling is countered by a different version the Emperor has been told in advance. Each Rashomon-like sequence also points out that truth will always be subjective. What is truth for one individual may turn out to be a lie for another. The dialogue between Nameless and the Emperor are as riveting as the martial arts scenes the dominate each flashback sequence. I would give Hero a less than perfect score just for the fact that its story gets lost once in awhile in the visuals and pageantry of Yimou's direction. This might become a problem for audience who can't keep track of what they're watching and reading the subtitles at the same time.

Jet Li has always been a favorite actor of mine. I've seen most of his films from his Hong Kong kung fu films to the mediocre ones he has made since arriving in the United States to try his hand in becoming a Hollywood star.. Hero shows that Jet Li is more than a silent, kick-ass martial artist who is only good in making kung fu flicks. He does more than his share of fighting in Yimou's film, but during his dialogue exchange with the Emperor Qin, Li demonstrates that he is a very good actor. The audience is never really sure what his character's agenda from the beginning and part of this should be laid at Li's acting chops. He keeps Nameless enigmatic, but at the same time charismatic enough for people to root for his character. It is not til the end that we find out what has been motivating Li's character. The other actors in Hero are a who's who of Asian cinema: Maggie Cheung, Tony Leung, Donnie Yen and Zhang Ziyi. The limited time that Zhang Ziyi is given in Hero doesn't diminish her excellent work. I honestly think that her work in this film is much better and more polished than the one she did for Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. She's even more beautiful in this film than she's ever been. She conveys her characters youth, passion and impetousness with equal fervor. Maggie Cheung is the opposite, but no less impressive. Her character is the balance to Ziyi's. She gives a wonderful performance of calm reserve holding back pent-up passion and emotion. Like Lee's martial arts epic, Hero treats its female characters on equal footing with its male players. This is quite a feat since the story itself is based historically during China's Warring States period when females where not given equal treatment barring the few exceptions.

Zhang Yimou has made an extraordinarily beautiful, lyrical and classically epic film. One doesn't have to be a martial arts aficionado to thoroughly enjoy Hero. It should satisfy and entertain both men and women. It is quite a shame that it took Miramax 2 years to release this film in the United States (it was released in 2002 in Asia and has already been nominated for Best Foreign Film during the 2002 Oscars). Region 0 dvd copies are already in the market and people have ended up seeing this film only in that format. I suggest for those who have only seen this film in that way to run out to whichever theater is showing it and buy themselves a ticket to see this film the only way to see it: on the big screen.",1093651200,11,4386,4.64819587628866

It would seem that the ""amercian"" version of the movie is dumbed down. most of the important, in fact, THE MOST IMPORTANT dialog has been changed. and the changes have caused flaws within the entire movie. I would have given this movie a perfect score, and with the chinese release i do, but the version just released in the states is completely flawed, completely different, and complete CRAP. All i can say without giving it away is this movie is about philosophy and more important spirituality, and with this ""new"" release of the film, both of those are stripped away and replaced with materialism. TRUELY. If the DVD release in the states is going to be just like this, it will be a damn shame. this movie has been completely ruined.",1093651200,10,917,4.5636363636363635

But even if this film had absolutely no plot to speak of, I would have considered the money I plunked down yesterday to see ""Hero"" to be money well-spent, because I have been witness to some of the most achingly beautiful filmmaking I've ever seen. As in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" the characters here fly through the air and dance across water, but ""Crouching Tiger"" surely could have benefitted from the sublime camera eye of ""Hero."" One scene of swordplay in particular that takes place in a grove of trees amongst swirling yellow leaves almost stopped my heart in my chest: It was that gorgeous. And yes, there is a plot also, one that involves various assassins with names like Sky, and Broken Sword, and Flying Snow. I have to admit that the tales and counter-tales told were a bit confusing at first, but by the time the film is over, all the pieces have fallen into place, and this chapter of ancient Chinese history has assumed a truly mythical quality.

If you can suspend your disbelief in wire-fu for a few action scenes, you will enjoy it very much. Be warned, this is more drama than action so be prepared to go through the movie's pacing that's sometimes erratic.

1890204,4,B00009RG46,"Hero is a beautiful movie.  It works in a way that awes the mind while telling a story.  In the opening scene, we see the Nameless assassin (Jet Li) talking to the emperor of Qin.  He begins to tell the story of how he killed three of the deadliest assassins.  He tells how he was able to exterminate the emporor's worst enemies, something that nobody else would even dare attempt.  However, his story causes confusion, and the emperor is quick to call the bluff. All is in hopes of making the country a unified body.

Hero is another brilliant stylized martial arts movie.  Watching the images that appear on the screen is mesmorizing.  There is a certain type of uniqueness that is able to grasp a person and not let go.  Of course, the visual effects are going to be in great condition.

The cinematogrophy is beautiful.  The colors that are used in this film are used perfectly. There is one scene where two people are fighting, and the whole scene suddenly changes to red.  It's just remarkable. The sound is excellent as you can here arrows whizzing by your ear.

Hero may not appear in the ranks of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but it does stand alone on its own.  It is a good film, and the actors do a great job conveying different types of emotions and artistry.  It is worth seeing in a theatre.",1093564800,,1309,4.4641350210970465
1890205,4,B00009RG46,"Zhang Yimou's ""Hero"" is probably one of the most visually beautiful and exquisitely filmed movies I have seen in many a year. Set in the third century BC during the unification of the seven kingdoms under the first Chinese emperor, the film stars Jet Li as a literally Nameless warrior who has supposedly vanquished the emperor's most fearsome enemies: Sky, played by Donnie Yen, Snow (Maggie Cheung Man-yuk), and the previously undefeatable Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu-wai).

Nameless is escorted into the divine presence as a hero, but after hearing his account of how he defeated these three foes, the emperor isn't having any of it; he suspects Nameless fabricated the whole thing only to get within striking distance (ten paces) of the emperor himself in order to carry out an assassination plot.  The story then divides itself into a Rashomon-like re-telling from various POVs, each one photographed with strikingly vivid color shifts -- a vibrant red, a pale blue, a pristine white, and a delicate, pale green.  And then we see Reality, photographed against a background of lifeless desert mesas which seems to emphasize the futility of it all.

The most compelling characters in the film are Sky and Broken Sword -- she's a single-minded woman warrior with a take-no-prisoners mentality, and Broken Sword, her lover, is a warrior who has fought one fight too many and no longer believes that the sword is the only option to resolving conflicts.  But Sky, like the true believer she is, loves her principles more than him, and the resulting confrontation between them is as inevitable as it is tragic.  The acting is excellent all around.  Jet Li is an appealing and likeable figure, and Tony Leung gives a totally convincing performance as Broken Sword.  The cast is rounded out by the exquisitely beautiful Zhang Ziyi as Broken Sword's servant Moon, in love with her master and faithful to the end, and Chen Dao Ming as the emperor of Chin.

There are going to be endless comparisons between ""Hero"" and ""Crouching Tiger"", Ang Lee's masterpiece.  Visually, ""Hero"" can hold its own against ""Crouching Tiger"" any day in the week.  And yet, somehow, it doesn't grab you emotionally in the way ""Crouching Tiger"" does.  ""Hero"" is gorgeous to look at and maybe that's its problem, it's so eye-popping to watch that the story doesn't measure up to its pure visual impact.  Zhang doesn't do a ""Rashomon"" tale as brilliantly as the late, great Akira Kurosawa, and in this film he doesn't grip us as totally as Ang Lee, but he's delivered a movie that, at least to watch, is eminently satisfying.",1093564800,27,2596,4.899543378995434
1890206,4,B00009RG46,"Just got back from seeing this film in a sold out theater. I must admit, at least half of the audience seemed to dislike the movie a great deal (especially the guys). The fight scenes aren't really that great and most consist of flying around and close-ups of the actor's faces. The fight between Jet Li and Donnie Yen towards the start of the film being the exception, which was pretty good. The visuals are what make the movie work. No, not visual effects, but the colors and locations really have an impact and grasp your attention throughout the short 95 minute running time. Jet Li is pretty good, but really doesn't do a whole lot in terms of fighting and Zhang Ziyi is very pretty (the girl from ""Crouching Tiger"") as always. The story is actually pretty good and follows the plot layering that was used in ""The Usual Suspects,"" where you hear a bunch of stories that are untrue until the truth is finally revealed at the end. I think it's worth seeing if you like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" and if not at least see it once it hits Dvd.

1890207,4,B00009RG46,"In 230 BCE, King Yinzheng of Qin (Ch'in) launched a series of wars of conquest against the six other major states of China, which over the course of the next 9 years would unify China with Yinzheng as the first Qin emperor - Shi(h) Huang (Ti). By 206/07 BCE, the empire would collapse under a peasant revolt aganist the Emperor - who had standardized a number of aspects of China and rebuilt and strengthend the Great Wall, but was seen as a tyrant who overtaxed and overworked the people. It is against this backdrop that Hero takes place.

The movie begins with Jet Li's character ""the Nameless One"" welcomed into the palace of the king having recently dispatched three of the greatest assassins from the Zhao(Chao)province to make attempts on Yinzheng's life. His audience with the king provides the frame story for which most of the movie is told in flashback. Kept 100 paces from the king for security, the Nameless One recounts his defeats of each assassin in turn, and with each recounting is allowed to come closer to the throne of the king.

Within the flashbacks we see lots of wonderous Jet Li wire-fu, full of sword, spear, kick and leaping action. Each flashback makes use of a different vibrant color theme: black for the frame story, then orange, red, blue, white and green. Loose fabric from the wide sleaves and long robes of the combatants flutter and drape with beauty during the fight scenes. The Chinese landscape too plays a dominant role shifting from lush mountain valleys to desert, to autumn woods. With a possible nod from the Matrix, cg animation of leaves and arrows add to the fairy tale aspect of the film, which feels more like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" than ""Iron Monkey""",1093564800,2,1711,4.738255033557047

1890209,3,B00009RG46,"Based on my viewing of the movie on a Chinese release DVD, ""Hero"" is a pretty movie and a fun ride and nothing more. Those who thumb their nose at the wire-fu (wired kung-fu) should just relax and enjoy. It's entertainment! Those who don't care and enjoy the action shouldn't profess that this movie shows the intricacies and deeper philosophies of kung-fu because ""Hero"" doesn't.

That said, I do like the movie, though for my tastes, I'm glad I didn't pay to see it in the theatre. My main problem is that ""Hero"" seems too contrived. The plot is weak and the characters are almost farcical. It seems like they wanted so much to capture the same audience (and revenue) of the ""Crouching Tiger..."" scene that they really didn't care about the story or building characters. It is a poor imitation of ""Crouching Tiger..."" and those who didn't like that movie will like this movie even less. It is like a Saturday morning cartoon trying real hard to be dramatic and clever.

It is, however, a treat to watch. It's like a Skittles commercial. The multitude of alternate reality/story flashbacks is visually defined by the colors of clothes that the characters wear - all matching each other. You have whites, yellows, blues, reds-a rainbow of flavor! Unfortunately, it is this eye-candy that also doesn't engage you in the story. How can something with so much staging be real? It can't. So why should you care for the characters or story? You don't have to. Just enjoy.

(By the way, the violence is PG-rated. No gore-which is why it seems so much like a Disney movie.)

Let me also add something about the special effects. Yikes.  The arrow attack on the city is neat to see, but when you see Jet Li knocking them down, the arrows turn into terribly animated matchsticks bouncing off his arms and legs. Groan.

Those who profess that there is a philosophical quality to the movie are probably referring to the ""all under heaven"" reference and the ""deep"" thinking needed to understand the Chinese writing for ""sword."" I guess I'll let this be. Each individual will probably have different thoughts on this...

All in all, if you want to see a marginally fun movie, then ""Hero"" is fine. In fact it's pretty safe for younger viewers as well.

Jet Li stars in this big budget film as a soldier/assasin who starts questioning the motives of his king. He is the main reason why I watched this film and I was not disappointed by his stunt work, nor his acting ability.

There is alot of talk about honor and Zen philosophy, a whole lot. People who went crazy over Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon will probably like this film more than me, it is much better than that dreck but I wish that it more wireless fight scenes in Hero.

This fighting is more like a beautiful ballet with swords.  My real problem with this film, or rather it's American release is simply this, I purchased the movie a month ago on Amazon for 2.95 from a private vender, and apart from the prologue and epilogue the entire movie, like Tarrentino's ""production"" is subtitled in English, all Tarrentino did to market it is produce a trailer (which give away the entire plot and mystery surrounding the movie, yet another bad move) and redo the prologue and epilogue in English for an American audience.  There was really nothing further for him to do, a film student at a community college could have done this.  Now he has the sheer audacity to release the movie, charge $8.00+ to view it, re-release it on DVD with new packaging and reap the profits, all in the guise that he produced it.

1890213,5,B00009RG46,"Western movie studios like to spoonfeed the story to the audience and have an ending that provides closure. Asian movies tend to be more ambigious & leave the conclusion more open-ended to allow the audience to walk away ""thinking"" about the consequences of the actions of the movie characters.
The wire kung fu is meant to be an expression of the inner turmoils that play within the character's heart and mind. Suspending your belief in reality would have to take place to accept the incredibly artistic fight scenes in this movie or just about every other action movie ever made like Spiderman or ID4. At least enjoy the beautiful camera work and use of colors in this movie instead of thinking about ""too many pretentious but self-indulgent thought-to-be poetically beautified scenes"".
The ""peking opera styled slow talking dialogue"" is used effectively in my opinion. JUSTAREADER may not be a fan of this type of dialog but everybody has their own opinion.
Zhang Yimou used the story of the Qin Emperor only as an outlet much like Passions of the Christ. Many will not agree with the portrayal of the Qin Emperor in Hero or the portrayal of Christ in Passions but it made its point.
I agree that the Qin Emperor is not as ""benevolent"" as Hero suggests but this is a fictional story meant to convey the conflicts of the characters - the sacrifices made for self and country and the eternal question ""does the ends justify the means""?
Boring movies don't move the audience and just passes 2 hours of their lives. It's the reaction I get after attempting to watch Dreamcatcher, Road Trip, or Day After Tommorrow.
Great movies provoke a reaction from the audience. This is a great movie with great visuals and cinematography. It got a reaction out of the ""love it"" and ""hate it"" camp! It wasn't a simple ""love it"" or ""hate it"" review.
Some of the best movies and music are derivatives of others. Example: Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith just borrowed from the blues and garage rock; Hero borrows from Rashomon; the list can go on and on forever. So to call Hero an unoriginal movie is an oxymoron because every movie copies from earlier movies.
Not all westerners are ""simple-minded"". People who just want simple Kung Fu movie or action movie with no plot will be bored to death and will find the movie ""too complicated for westerners.""

1890215,5,B00009RG46,"""Hero"" is a very ambitious film, attempting to combine quiet introspective philosophy with visually stunning action and pageantry.  It is like an intimate epic.  The scope is grand to say the least, with full armies on the march as well as intense and magical personal duels, all of which serves as decoration to the Buddhist philosophy being put forward.
It is very beautiful, and this is probably the first thing to be noticed.  The various elements, actors, scenery and colors all combine to create a visual splendor.  It is a very painterly movie, a feast for the eyes.  Specifically, color is used to create moods and to differentiate the various storylines.  If the visuals are painterly, then the Martial Arts are dancerly, along the same line as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" to which inevitable comparisons must be drawn.  The actors are equally beautiful as well, and ""Hero, truly a feast for the eyes, could probably be enjoyed in this manner, without any dialog.

The same story is told and re-told, each time moving closer to the purity of truth, and with truth comes enlightenment.  This is an intimate tale,  a quiet verbal duel between an Emperor, so fearsome and lonely than no human can approach within one hundred paces of him, and a nameless subject, who might just be a true hero.  Between them, a story is told of epic engagements, artists and warriors, and what is actually worth fighting and dying for.
I won't spoil too much of the story, as part of ""Hero's"" strength and insight lies in discovery.  That is not to say that it is full of surprises and twist endings, but rather that, like all Buddhist insight, the answer of the movies riddle lies as much in the viewer as in the actors.",1087603200,5,1802,4.722044728434505
1890216,5,B00009RG46,"At the end of China`s warring states, the Kingdom of Qin is the most ambitious and ruthless of the seven states. Its` King is the target of assassins from all over China. Of all the would be assassins, Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu-wai), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung Man-yuk) and Sky (Donnie Yen) are the most dangerous. When Nameless (Jet Li) kills all three of them, he is offered a chance to meet the King. Nameless explains how he used their personal relationships to expose and attack their weaknesses, but - in a similar scenario to Akira Kurosawa`s Rashomon (1950) the King tells a different version of the same story....
There`s no denying a lot of care was put into this film, it is amazingly shot and beautiful to watch (what do you expect when Wong Kar Wai`s cinematographer Chris Doyle is at the helm?). I liked the clever use of the colour scheme (green/red/white/blue) that was used by Zhang Yimou to emphasise different things.
An all star cast was assembled for this film - and everyone performs well in their own ways I think. Tony Leung and Maggie especially are excellent, turning in a performance which draws comparisons with the Wong Kar Wai movie In The Mood For Love (2000). Playing the role of Broken Swords servant Moon, Zhang Ziyi (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, The Road Home) is gorgeous, though her turn perhaps reminded me of Jen Yu in Crouching Tiger too much, as if she`d phoned her performance in. Donnie Yen`s part is sadly also little more than an extended cameo, though his fight in the rain with Nameless (Jet Li) is very impressive.
Of course, comparisons are bound to be drawn between CTHD and this film - Maggie`s/Zhang Ziyi`s forest fight reminded me of the sword duel of the earlier CTHD, as did the balletic walking on water or flying through the air. To top it off, the composer Tan Dun wrote a score for Hero that is not too dissimilar to the one in CTHD (particularly at the beginning and end with the drums and violins).
If I have any complaints at all, I would have liked to have seen more character development and backstory. I also wasn't sure about the way the tyrannical King is portrayed as simply a misunderstood man, ignoring what he was really like in Ancient Chinese history and what he did to his people. This doesn't show the whole picture.
Plot gripes nothwithstanding, bear in mind that what we have here is essentially a Producer`s Cut of the film, assembled by American company Miramax and missing about 20 minutes from Zhang Yimou`s original vision. One can only hope the rumored Extended Edition of the film gets a release on DVD in Hong Kong or the US someday.
Overall though, I think this is an outstanding piece of cinema.",1087257600,4,2688,4.649159663865547
1890217,5,B00009RG46,"Hero is a Directed by the fatastic Zhang Yi Mou. A very respected and highly recognized Asian Film director. Hero is his first Martial Arts film and he has done the right thing with this.
The story is about ""nameless"" telling truth and lies about the journey to assinate the Qin King. Other characters are Broken sword and flying snow and moon. The acting is very good. The special effects are extrodinary. The story line may be allitle confusing for some but because the film is so addictive, you will want to watch it again and go deeper into the film and once you get the film's deeper plot, you will say ""yay/wow""
In amtial arts films, the fighting films aren't that exciting, just punch kick, punch kick. This one, the fighting is so graceful and smooth. This IS AUTHENTIC fighting and you can see how nice they move. The camera work in the film make the fighting scenes very dynamic and calming, like the fight in the chess court. The acting is very good, script is good ( subtitles are easy to understand) There is actually meaning to this film than just swish and slashing. There is emotion in this film. This film should not be compared with Crouching tiger Hidden dragon as Crouching tiger hidden dragon is badly made. Crouching... is a lame, try-hard asian film only directly for international audiences (no offence. The plot is horrible, the fighting is silly, the acting is horrible and the whole thing is just plain awful but Hero is a fantastic film that should be watched and appreciated.

Some of the performances may leave you cold and the politics colder but the depths of the characters feelings are intensely wrought and left me with tears in my eyes.

1890222,4,B00009RG46,"This film premiered while I was living in China,and it was quite the anticipated event. I don't recall anyone being disappointed in it; quite the opposite, most found it quite moving and stirring. Personally, I think it is one of the best martial arts movies around, and that it scores quite well as a film. It's true that the movie isn't brimming over with fights, but that's not the mark of a great kung fu movie. The true mark is the artistry of the fights, their context, and the way in which the Chinese martial arts tradition and culture is conveyed. Hero does well on all these counts.
  I must disagree with the New Zealand poster; I think it's quite interesting to compare this movie to Crouching Tiger. Hero was quite widely held to be the mainland's answer to the Taiwanese/Hong Kong produced CTHD.Overseas Chinese seem to be a little disappointed in Hero, while Mainlanders seem to prefer Hero. Aside from sharing a cast member (Zhang Ziyi, in a rather thankless role), they are pretty different movies, but both are Chinese in their own way. Both capture the stoic melancholy of Chinese culture, CTHD in terms of love, Hero in terms of patriotism (though there is an understated romance at the heart of Hero). Perhaps it's the heavily politicized climate, but mainlanders seemed to find Hero much more moving. The not-so-implicit premise is that law and order are more important to a nation than freedom, a view Americans are unlikely to sympathize with (though you have endorsed if you voted for George W. Bush.)This is a pretty realistic philosophy, and it's an idea that has driven Chinese political thought for three thousand years. Mainlanders are intensely patriotic, and this film hits them where they live in depicting the wrenching sacrifices of the characters. CTHD, by contrast, is a much more personal movie, and I think it captures the sense of loss and dignity, the sense of preservation, that makes Hong Kong and Taiwanese culture different from that of the mainland.
  Which of these films you prefer depends less on their respective qualities and more on what draws you in personally. I prefer CTHD, but there's no denying that the nobility on display in Hero is quite stirring.
  Zhang Yimou is one of the world's great directors, and it shows. The film is beautifully shot, impressively edited, and well acted (if you've never thought of Jet Li as an actor, you may revise your opinion somewhat). It also serves as a mini-geography lesson, with some of the most spectacular scenery in all China on display. The fighting, when it happens, is top notch. Donnie Yen (Iron Monkey fame)puts in a brief but impressive performance in one of the best fights in memory. This is a wire-fu film, but don't dismiss it on that count. Wire-fu, while artificial, is arguably more true to the culture of wushu than the old-school stuff. George Lucas' Jedi are linear descendents of the fighters in Chinese martial fiction, and this movie shows why. Wire-fu takes as much physical talent and effort as any other kind of martial display; no one can seriously think that just because his jumps are enhanced that Jet Li is a sub-par wushu artist. I admit, even I rolled my eyes a little at the arrow deflecting scene, but it is cool. Even cooler is the way the calligraphy students continue working while the arrows fall around them. Now that's Chinese.
  Bottom line: when it gets here, see it. If you liked the pathos and pageantry of CTHD, you won't be disappointed. Just don't expect to be moved quite the same way.",1075939200,8,3531,4.777049180327869
1890223,5,B00009RG46,"Hero is the biggest Chinese martial arts movie since Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  It takes place during the formation of the Qin Dynasty.  THe ruler of Qin is locked away in his palace because there are many assasins out to get him, chief among these are Sky, Broken Sword, and Snow.  Naturally he is surprised when a warrior named Nameless brings him the weapons of these three master assasins.  The Qin leader is curious and invites Nameless into his palace to tell his story.
One of the great innovations of this movie is the creative use of color.  During Nameless' audience with the Qin leader, several versions of the story are told, and each is represented by a major theme color.  It makes a real impression when you see it, and the colors definitely effect your emotions.
The sword battles are some of the best ever.  In particular, I liked the scene where Nameless and Snow fight off an endless shower of arrows.  It's so dynamic, and I haven't seen anything like it before.

This is the first time I encountered a 3-in-1 story and successfully translate it into moving picture. Each player has multi-dimension which is more realistic and benevolent to human complexes. This movie insults no one.
Technical wise, the thuds, hums and swishes of thousand flying arrows were astounding sound of might and fear. The use of colorcoding was a brilliant concept of transitions of story-version.

Where as Hidden Dragon was a story, this is a philosphical meditation on action versus peace. And, even though the same composer is used, the music is not comparable--Hero is a far more nuanced invesigation of Chinese culture. (The way the blind musician shakes the robs back from his hands is itself a stunning look at the martial arts ""body state"" that internal arts aim for. The King of Qin is amazing to watch even though he largely just sits there and talks.) Another film that Hero is being compared to is Roshimon, because retellings of the tale that is the heart of the movie. This too is incorrect. The point of the retellings is not to reflect different vantage points and interests, but rather to provide the set-up for the climax and to explore the three themes (equal to the three stages of martial arts the King of Qin sees in the giant caligraphy): passionate action, extreme committment, and, ultimately, serene peace.",1073347200,6,1062,4.745945945945946

1890232,4,B00009RG46,"Comparison is inevitable.  We have seen Oscar-winning ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" which has virtually rewritten the standard of martial arts action.  Perhaps ""Hero"" should have been made two years earlier, but still it is worth watching for its breathtaking beauty.
The story is told in traditional Chinese epic literature style, so don't think of the film as showing accurate history of China.  The time is around 200 BC, and seven kingdoms are fiercely fighting each other.  Then a mysterious man ""Nameless"" (Jet Li) appears before one of them, King of Qin.  Nameless claims that he had killed three assassins who had once attempted to kill the King -- Broken Sword (Tonny Leung), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung), and Sky (Donnie Yen) --  and giving three swords as proof of his story, Nameless starts to tell the account of his fights against them.
Then we see beautiful fighting scenes -- but the King notices something is wrong with his story.  Nameless is not telling the whole truth, or completely lying.  But for what?  And what happened to the three fighters?
The picture is always beautiful, thanks to the camera of Christopher Doyle, and great costumes designed by Emi Wada (known for her work in Kurosawa's ""Ran"").  The wire-actions are wonderfully done, but my honest feeling is like ""Wonderful, but I have seen them before.""  Not that it's bad, but when the characters start to fly in the air over the serene water of lake, you cannot help remembering Chow Yun-Fat in ""Crouching Tiger,"" especially when you see Zhang Ziyi again (and her role is not as big as that of ""Tiger."")
There are two main problems that you should know before seeing the film.  The film shows one version of ""truth"" in flashback, and comes back again to the present time, and goes back again to another flashback that might or might not deny what we have seen before.  Thus the film looks going on and on, as if pushing re-set button of TV game many times.  This kind of  narrative is destroying our emotional response to the characters whose motives are not clear until the near end.  And beware; the film's title ""Hero"" might be misleading if you imagine the very conventional figure of ""Hero"" in Hollywood films.  The values the film is trying to show might not be yours (it wasn't mine, and I am a Japanese).  It was like, ""I understand your idea, but I don't particularly like it.""
Undeniably beautiful, but I think the director Yimou Zhang should have stayed in the simple story formula he showed in his previous works like ""The Road Home.""  Good action film, and even profound, but you don't have to take the message of the film as it is.",1062806400,27,2633,4.722100656455142

Only the most ignorant of western viewers would appreciate Shihuang as depicted in ""Hero"". One of his greatest achievement was, of course, building the Great Wall of China. In the process he utilized slave labor from his prisoners of war, committing unfathomable homicides against the society, in a scale as large as the Nazi Holocaust. That wall was literally built by human flesh and bone, people, there's nothing grandiose about it. One of the reviewers below was right when compared Shihuang to Hitler, this is about arguably as close as we could get to compare this person to a modern day tyrant; although I am certain Hitler himself is nowhere near the like of Shihuang and Genghis Khan. The truth is you tread on blood-thirsty dictators if they fail in their process of conquering mankind, and you glorify them if they succeed.

1890236,3,B00009RG46,"When Zhang Yimou said he wanted to make a martial arts film that would become the most successful Chinese film in history, I was actually disappointed. He had never done a martial arts film, and judging from his resume it's hard to imagine he harbored any interest in the genre whatsoever. When I saw a trailer for HERO, suddenly this seemed like the mainland's answer to Ang Lee's CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, or maybe Zhang was simply becoming something he wasn't before -- driven by market forces instead of artistic license. It was hard for me to guard against judging HERO too soon. But when I finally saw the film recently, I found that my skepticism wasn't necessary.
I'll dispense with the commonalities between HERO and CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, other than to say Lee's film is an inspiration. Ultimately, I think HERO owes more to Akira Kurosawa than to Ang Lee. To what extent Zhang Yimou was influenced by Kurosawa, it is not apparent in his earlier films. In HERO, those influences are unmistakable. With its strong colors, streaming flags, howling wind, and phalanxes of massed troops, it evokes the elegant imagery of RAN. Its complex, multi-perspective narrative is directly reminiscent of RASHOMON. There are also references to the visceral violence of THRONE OF BLOOD, done to a similarly frightening effect. And HERO's vaguely amoral undercurrent recalls the dangers and consequences of THE BAD SLEEP WELL.
I found HERO's action very good but not great -- a strong opening faceoff between Donnie Yen and Jet Li (and others) sets the bar fairly high but is never surpassed. The drama is intriguing, but its characters are a little too distant and thinly drawn, making the movie emotionally uninvolving as a result. What makes HERO most watchable is its visual design, with sumptuous art direction, costumes and cinematography. Zhang Yimou has always had a gift for strong visuals, but his earlier films were propelled more by ensemble casts with a small-story focus, using imagery as punctuation. This is very different. HERO is a feast for the eyes, with the boldest visualization of any of Zhang's films.
It is photographed by Christopher Doyle, who is Wong Kar-Wai's longtime collaborator and arguably the best cinematographer in the world today. Doyle captures each shot like a watercolor, saturating every detail onto the film frame. Our eyes are treated to such simple things as swirling leaves, flickering candles, spraying water, flowing hair and gowns, and a single drop of blood. It is a film asking to be appreciated in the highest fidelity possible.
If there's any flaw in this extravagance, it is that seemingly half the movie takes place in slow motion, as if each scene is to be sipped like a fine wine. This emphasis slows the momentum of the action. Most of Zhang Ziyi's battle against Maggie Cheung is spent in slow motion, which may look beautiful, but it just doesn't look much like a fight. Somewhat choppy film editing in several action scenes give us montages of posed shots instead of the flowing ballet of martial arts we expect to see.
HERO ends on a note that has already caused controversy, with some accusing Zhang Yimou of giving in to mainland political demands, and still others branding him a traitor. I think if we use Zhang's past history as a guide, then surely the ultimate meaning of the film is not as simple as it looks at first glance. In the end we are left to debate who, or what, is really heroic in this story.
The version of HERO I saw was the internationally distributed 98-minute version. Miramax apparently wanted, and got, nearly 20 minutes removed from the director's 116-minute first cut. I suspect that some important pacing and character development were lost on the cutting room floor as a result. Whether those scenes will ever be restored is anyone's guess. I join many others who would like to see Zhang's ""director's version,"" so we could see whether the extra scenes added to the flow of the narrative or made it more ponderous.
This is not Zhang Yimou's best film (which is TO LIVE, in my opinion), but it is already his most popular, which accomplishes what he set out to do. HERO is not what CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON was, nor should it be. When judged on its own merit, HERO is a beautiful, inspired film, and without sacrificing Zhang's stark sensibilities or bitter tone. I'm not sure why Miramax is dragging its feet with this film's release, but as long as they do, U.S. theaters will be deprived of a remarkable, if flawed, creation from one of the world's most talented filmmakers.",1056499200,4,4583,4.854406130268199

Do not be confused this is not a superproduction in the AMERICAN way, this is a really sober movie. Photography is amazing in every step of the way because since the movie depicts various facts, from various perspectives given of course by the characters, each time a new perspective is brought in the color palette changes playingly beautifully with light and color temperature.
Everything in the movie is really carefully planned, Art Direction, Acting, Photography etc, but the fights deserve a special mention they are quite better even that Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or any MATRIX the answer would be poetry of movement.

This was a absolutely spectacular piece of filmmaking which completely exceeded my expectations and showed me that the Chinese film industry is finally coming of age.  I'm very impressed Mainland China is able to come up with a movie of this calibre.  While it is true that some western viewers may not be familiar with the chapter of Chinese history this movie alludes to, the movie is strong enough that it should be able to overcome that handicap.  Also viewers should keep in mind that, unlike ""Crouching Tiger"", this movie was made by Chinese for Chinese.
  First of all, let me just say that I'm no lover of the communist regime in China, and I'm well aware of Qin Shi Huang's (the first Emperor) cruel rule as a tyrant.  However, ""Hero"" shows us that history is never black and white.  It is difficult to catagorise someone like Qin Shihuang as simply evil or good for China, and we just have to accept him as he is.
  Visually, ""Hero"" is perhaps the greatest achievement in mainland Chinese cinema...well, ever!  The special effects, locations, scenary, etc. are all up to par with American movies.  Zhang Yimou is obviously a director who loves his work, and it shows.  Especially prominant is his meticulous use of colour (any who's seen the film will know what I'm talking about), which he embeds throughout the movie with loving care.  My favourite scene is when Broken Sword duels with Qing Shihuang in the palace admist a sea of beautiful green drapes; the way the drapes all fall at the end of the scene was just sublime.  Of course the swordfighting is as good as you'd expect from this sort of a movie.  Jet Li is at his best, and it's obvious that he's much more comfortable as an actor when speaking his native language.
  The acting in this movie is generally good, but the standout performance goes to Chen Daoming for his awesome portrayal of Qin Shihuang.  Chen handles his multilayered and complex role with skill and creates a ""villain"" who, at the very least, is unforgettable.
  As far as plot goes, I find the movie to have much less in common with ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" than movies like ""Gangs of New York"".  ""Crouching Tiger"" was all about characters.  ""Hero"" has memorable characters, but this movie is about nothing less than the Making of China.  There is no better word than 'epic' to describe this film.  More than anything else this movie shows us what China is all about.  America was born in the streets (so says ""Gangs of NY""), but China was born through the sacrifices, ambiguities, and tragedies of these blood-stained pages in history.  I  have never been more proud of being Chinese.",1053648000,4,2667,4.689655172413793
1890242,5,B00009RG46,"With the largest budget ever for a Chinese film and an all star cast directed by Zhang Yimou, you don't expect something mediocre. With all the factors above, it seems fitting that this film is one to remember and cherish. Large budgets for movies don't exactly mean 'quality filmmaking', but in this case, the film didn't suffer, but only added the perfection that could have been missing if on a smaller budget. Yimou went all out on this one, and you must see it to believe it, when it reaches American movie theaters in the winter.
The story is fairly simple, I do not want to give away too much in this review, but the most obvious connection to this movie and 2 others would be Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"" and Kurosawa's ""Ran"" Many others say ""The Emperor and the Assassin"" which is more on the obvious side.
Many perspectives are shown, much as the basis for Rashomon. Each story that is retold has a distinct 'color' towards who is telling the story, which brings in the ""Ran"" comparison.
Emi Wada, who did the maginificent costumes for ""Ran"" also did the costume design for this movie, obviously using her greatest asset, colors bright and bold. The color coding in the movie almost serves as a seperate character, as she did with the 3 brothers in Ran.
The fight sequences, especially between Jet Li and Donnie Yen are nothing less than breathtaking. Very much taking the wire-flights in the style of Yuen Wo Ping, and using them to the full degree possible (which you know must be a lot of fun for the actors).
Some people that reviewed the movie here might have complained about the story not being 'full' enough, but there is a small explanation for that. The original running time was actually around 110 minutes long, but Miramax (or MiramAXE to some people) thought the movie was too long for 'international' audiences, so the film was cut to 98 minutes. What was cut is unknown to me since there is no Director's Cut available anywhere, even in Hong Kong or China. I did feel that the first fight scene coming in around the 10 minute mark was a little sudden, but the cut material might have explained things better. Let's all hope for a Director's Cut when finally issued in the US.
This film is the reason why we go to the movies. It is a visual delight, along with a strong storyline that keeps you interested and intrigued. Yimou scores again with this one, you must see it to believe the hype.
Best shot/sequence:
It would be so much easier if i could divide it by the best sequence by way of color coding, but to choose one, it would have to be the first fight sequence, with Jet Li and Donnie Yen. Switching for dream sequence black and white to reality color, this fight scene in their minds was breathtakingly beautiful. This is the scene I show people to convince them this movie.",1053648000,3,2801,4.548514851485148
1890243,5,B00009RG46,"This is a martial arts movie as seen by the acting of Jet Li but it one with a twist.  I'd encourage anyone who is an enthusiast of martial art movies, art films, Chinese culture, or philosophical films to watch this one.
As to accusation toward Yimou Zhang about his glorification of ""tyrants,"" upon further review of the movie, Zhang Yimou does no such thing.  Rather than glorifying that ""wang,"" he is glorifying principles.  He is also recognizing a watershed event in Chinese history of the unification of the seven states to end the warfare and even makes reference to this in the mention of the many scripts of Chinese that were unified by the first emperor.",1053043200,,665,4.666666666666667

It's a pity that people who have never tried to master a skill or talent are always negatively criticizing someone else's hard work. Especially the non-martial artists, the non-actors, and less just face it those who have no talent at all. Anyone one who says that this movie is no good could never have put there best efforts into their work. It is obvious (except for the Asian movie expert critics) that this is a classic movie with a classic cast. I believe that our senses become dull when they are constantly bombarded from all directions. Some of us have lost our sensitivity due to watching too many flashy films. This is a CLASSIC film and all of you out there that are actors, martial artists, martial arts film enthusiasts have to give this movie a thumbs up! I guess that I am a little biased because I watch movies with an open mind and don't compare them to others. Silly me! I wish peace and love to ALL UNDER HEAVEN.",1052006400,2,1081,4.4646464646464645
1890245,4,B00009RG46,"Finally!  More than a year after I reviewed it, ""Hero"" is finally getting released in the United States.  It is a visual treat - I would encourage all fans of the genre to go and watch it - not just once, but at least twice, to appreciate the artistry of director Zhang Yimou, cinematographer Chris Doyle, and actors Jet Li, Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung and Zhang Ziyi.  ""Hero"" is set in the 3rd century BCE during the period of upheavals in ancient China known as the Warring States period. King Yingzheng of the state of Qin, one of the seven independent states of ancient China, had ambitions to conquer the six other states to form a unified China. In pursuit of this ambition, he ruthlessly waged devastating wars and eliminated the other six states one by one, inflicting incalculable suffering upon the people of ancient China. ""Hero"" is Zhang Yimou's fictitious account of four swordsmen from the rival state of Zhao who conspired to assassinate King Yingzheng. In order to get close enough to the King to kill him, one of them (Jet Li as a swordsman called ""Nameless"") must convince the King that he had defeated and killed the other three (Donnie Yen as ""Sky"", Tony Leung as ""Broken Sword"" and Maggie Cheung as ""Flying Snow""). I will not spoil the story further by revealing more. Now for my conflicting feelings about this movie. First of all, let me say that I enjoyed ""Hero"" immensely. Who wouldn't? With its cast of some of the most exceptionally talented Chinese actors, its superb cinematography, its gorgeous scenery (a substantial portion of which was filmed at the Dunhuang deserts) and its engaging story (several different perspectives of the same event), ""Hero"" easily kept me engrossed from beginning to end. The use of different primary colours, such as red, blue, green and white, in different segments of the movie to denote the emotional states of the protagonists was also fascinating to watch. However, ""Hero"" also deeply disturbed me. After past ""subversive"" movies like ""Judou"" and ""Raise the Red Lantern"" (that is, ""subversive"" in the opinion of the Communist Government of China), Zhang Yimou seemed to have a change of heart and made a movie that can be seen as an apologia for tyrants and dictators everywhere. King Yingzheng was depicted as an almost benign and noble king who wished to unify China in order to stop the bloodshed caused by almost continuous warfare amongst the seven states for over five centuries. ""Hero"" conveniently glosses over the fact that King Yingzheng was the most universally hated tyrant throughout the last two thousand years in China's history. Although he did manage to unite China and also did other great things such as implementing a single Chinese script and a single measurement system, building the Great Wall of China, setting up an efficient bureaucracy for governing the immense country, etc., his cruelty and corruption cannot and should not be forgiven and forgotten, the way ""Hero"" tries to forgive and forget for the sake of the greater good. King Yingzheng buried scholars alive and burnt ""subversive"" books because both had the potential to arouse the masses to rebellion. He enslaved millions to build his Great Wall and slaughtered countless others in his ambition to become emperor. ""Hero"" suggests that true heroes are those who are willing to sacrifice their own individual needs for the greater good of the country, and that governments must sometimes do the unthinkable to achieve the greater good. Could this be Zhang Yimou's interpretation of the actions of the Chinese government during the Tiananmen Square massacre? For a much more rounded perspective on the character of King Yingzheng, I greatly recommend Chen Kaige's ""The Emperor and the Assassin"" featuring Gong Li - most definitely my favourite movie about the First Emperor of China.",1051747200,3,3831,4.9828125

1890247,2,B00009RG46,"Face it, either you love a movie or you don't.  There's always something to pull the viewer in, or distract them with horrible disgust, but in this case, the movie's more black and white than of a distinction. ""Hero,"" directed by Zhang Yimou, along with a cast including Jet Li and Chen Dong Ming, depicts the story of China before being united under one rule.
  As told through the eyes of a nameless warrior, ""Hero"" centers on four assassins trying to rid the country of a supposedly power-hungry king, only later realizing that the king's intentions are that of harmony.
  But this idea of harmony and unity is what ironically separates the movie into two perspectives.  It's a simple two-sided case, where the movie style is wonderfully done, yet the plot is rocky, and off-center.  As a director, Yimou displays this multi-faceted story amazingly well, although a few times overdone, with symbolism.  From the color schemes of promoting peace to voicing the sorrow of betrayal, vibrancy can be found in every action sequence, and melancholy in the void of the desert scenes.  Wire effects really help the action in presenting a gracefulness to the contradiction of the wild fury of fighting, reminiscent of those found in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" and even digital effects add to the epic scale of the movie, as you'll understand in the arrow scene. Then there's the technique of perspective, as if viewing the movie from a shattered glass; the story is retold multiple times but with different ideas and actions, forcing the audience to piece their own truth.
  But as aforementioned, that is only half of the experience. Of course it's visually stunning, but with such an upsetting plot, it's hard to appreciate the majesty of the film at times.  The plot itself is not upsetting, but how it is told.  Yimou portrays the first emperor of China as one who desires peace and shows that his means justify his actions.  Although the movie notes that this is only one of the various myths of what really happened, it is still absurdity at best. The first emperor did build the Wall of China and did other great things, but his corruption outweighed the benefits he presented.  He buried scholars because they held too much information, slaughtered countless innocent lives, and even burned books (the last ruler to do that was Hitler).  Showing the better perspective of the emperor can be understanding, but that fact that they only showed one side and over glorified the man's ambitions made this a disturbing experience.
  Of course, this is only a movie that is being talked about, and many can disregard the fiction and enjoy the visual aspect.  But a film is an extremely significant medium that can speak to us and profoundly move us.  By mixing the visual majesty along with an absurd glorification, this seems like nothing more than propaganda.  It can be, as said before, excused easily, but the problem is that Americans will soon be witnessing this film, and let's face it, American culture centers its history lessons on America; not many Asian Americans will even know it's invalidity (being one, it took a while before I even realized what I was actually viewing).
  Yimou's vision and style are stunning talents, but with storytelling as such an integral part in movie making, it makes it hard to both disparage and recommend a film that overzealously venerates what it shouldn't.",1050451200,5,3406,4.885217391304348
