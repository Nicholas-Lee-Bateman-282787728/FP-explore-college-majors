6136071,5,B00H7E8KVI,"Plot. Hmm. Dasterdly look a like takes over master of ceremonies place in popular touring show in order to disguise real intentions to commit robberies in buildings next door.
What is confusing about that? Meanwhile real master of ceremonies, Kermit, has been transported to Russian Siberia camp not only wondering how to escape, but also wondering if his troop of friends actually need him anymore since the road show is a success via tabloid news.
One of the best Muppet features since Christmas Carol with arousing score and numbers, & many funny situations.",1395619200,6,561,5.043010752688172
6136072,4,B00H7E8KVI,"MUPPETS MOST WANTED begins immediately where THE MUPPETS ends.  As Kermit and the gang are preparing to pack up and go home, they notice a camera thats still filming and realize that must mean theres going to be a sequel. Thus begins the first of several original songs, Were Doing a Sequel. In the first stanza of the song Kermit sings, Were doing a sequel/Thats what we do in Hollywood/And everybody knows/The sequels never quite as good. Although the MUPPETS MOST WANTED has a lot of great gags, witty one liners, a pretty decent plot, and is filled with original musical numbers, the film doesnt quite reach the same level as THE MUPPETS. That doesnt mean that MUPPETS MOST WANTED is a bad movie because it isnt. Its just that other than a couple of scenes, the film lacks the heart and magic that made THE MUPPETS such a great comeback movie.

In MUPPETS MOST WANTED, the Muppets meet with a manager to the stars, Dominic Badguy (Ricky Gervais) who convinces them they should go on an international tour to strike while the iron is hot. Unbeknownst to the Muppets, Dominic is the second-in-command to the number one criminal in the world, Constantine. Constantine is a frog who, other than a mole on his face, looks identical to Kermit. Constantine has also escaped from an international gulag in Siberia, Russia and the Muppets World Tour is all part of his plan to pull of the biggest jewel heist in history.

Like THE MUPPETS, MUPPETS MOST WANTED is full of references to past Muppets appearances. For instance, the opening number Were Doing a Sequel has a closing aquatic bit that harkens back to Miss Piggys entrance in THE GREAT MUPPET CAPER and the plot of THE GREAT MUPPET CAPER also revolved around an international jewel thief. There are several references like this throughout the film.

There are some good songs in MUPPETS MOST WANTED. Bret McKenzie has written several original songs for the movie and the musical score is by Christophe Beck, he of now FROZEN fame.  Personally, the new songs I liked most are Were Doing a Sequel, Interrogation Song, and Something So Right. I also really liked the Muppet versions of the songs Working in the Coal Mine and Moves Like Jagger.

Like all Muppet movies, MUPPETS MOST WANTED is filled with guest stars. Some are quite minor in this film, but they are there. First Ricky Gervais, Tina Fey, and Ty Burrell all have lead roles. In addition, Tony Bennett, Hugh Bonneville, Jemaine Clement, Sean Combs, Lady Gaga, Celine Deion, Josh Groban, Salma Hayek, Toby Jones, Frank Langella, Ray Liotta, James McAvoy, Chloe Grace Moretz, Usher, Miranda Richardson, Saoirse Ronan, Danny Trejo, Stanley Tucci, and Chrisoph Waltz all have cameos of varying degrees. Also, Zach Galifianakis reprises his role as Hobo Joe from the first movie (just for one brief scene) and Tom Hiddleston (Loki from THOR and THE AVENGERS) has a very small cameo as The Great Escapo; he is completely unrecognizable as himself.

MUPPETS MOST WANTED lacks some of the heart and nostalgia of THE MUPPETS. However, it does have a lot of great gags, witty one liners, a pretty decent plot, and is filled with original musical numbers. Besides that, it is a Muppet movie and a Muppet movie isn't quite like any other type of movie around.",1395619200,21,3261,4.781527531083482
6136073,3,B00H7E8KVI,"Izzy's 8 and she was excited to see this movie so we took off to see it pretty much as soon as we could. On the whole, we were mildly amused but she sure had a hard time sitting still for the whole 2 hours.

To the positive, as usual The Muppets give with the usual wacky madcap humor. There are the gags and pratfalls that you expect from the movie. Fans of Sam the Eagle will be thrilled because for once he's a central character and the center of attention for quite a while. The music numbers are not overwhelming and they're semi-memorable. Probably the best thing about the movie, and the one that garnered the most laughs, was a Monsters University short before the movie started. After that the whole thing seemed rather downhill.

The negative bits come in most strongly from Izzy who said, I quote: ""The plot was really confusing."" While I didn't share the sentiment I can see how she might think that given her age. I'm also increasingly unhappy with the attention paid to the character and voice of the Muppets themselves. Rowlf now sounds like Scooter and Scooter sounds more like Fozzie. Statler and Waldorf sound completely different and the beloved Animal is a shadow of his former glory. While I understand they'll never match exactly it seems like the voice casting isn't even trying to match the originals at this point.

In summary, if you've seen all the movies before this and you're just interested in completeness then this one is a fine choice. All the usual lovable characters are there and at least they look the same. Aside from a focus on Kermit and Sam the rest of the cast is pretty typically represented. To those who are just looking for a kids movie to see I'd pick something else. Izzy squirmed and squirmed the whole time and had that poor bored look on her face that says, ""is this over yet"" from about minute 20 to the end.",1395446400,2,1861,4.5
6136074,5,B00H7E8KVI,"So Kermit has a doppelgnger, huh? And he is dastardly! Therein lies our PG-rated story. (I think the rating is based on some subtle sexual references, but later, we couldn't recall what they were.)

As you probably know, The Muppets can invite an astonishing number of name brand performers to one of these capers. In this one, if you recognize one familiar face, you'll see 30 more! I am in bewildered awe that so many performers (on both sides of the pond) seem delighted to provide cameos for these fuzzy folks.

Along with the familiar character voices, here are a few of the guest celebrities we enjoyed:
  * Ricky Gervais (""The Invention of Lying"") is Domenic Badguy (pron. ""Bah ghee"" it's French), the villain's evil sidekick (""Number Two"" ...smile...).
  * Tina Fey (""30 Rock"") Nadya makes ""Siberia"" rhyme with ""superior.""
  * Christoph Waltz (""Django Unchained"") takes a turn dancing with a Muppet. Which kind of dance you might ask? Yup! A Waltz!
  * Ty Burrell (""Modern Family"") is Jean Pierre Napoleon, an Interpol agent who is determined to bring The World's Most Dangerous Criminal to justice, so long as it's BEFORE his American counterpart!
  * Salma Hayek (""Grown Ups"") as herself. She suspects that the proposed ""Indoor Running of the Bulls"" event in a crowded theater might present a bit of a problem.

I LOVED the world's smallest police car; the visits to Berlin, Moscow, Dublin, London and Siberia; the glimpses of famous American, Canadian, French, Spanish, Mexican and British actors; music from ""A Chorus Line"" done by a line-up of Siberian prisoners (you won't believe all the familiar faces in THAT group!). Many times I was the only one reacting, but then again, movies are my hobby. I could easily name 25 actors I recognized without breaking a sweat. They ranged from ""Machete"" to ""Downton Abbey."" These are such a romp!

The children in the screening audience adored The Muppets and their lively production numbers, the adults loved all the familiar faces, laughed at the clever dialogue and applauded the surprise guest in that iron box. Me too! Amazon will notify me when the DVD is available because I always notify my JayFlix.net folks.",1394841600,16,2171,4.912328767123288

Gradually it dawned on me that the writers and producers and actors are totally aware of how stupid it is, and are leaning into it. You can tell they're having fun with how dumb it is.

 The small ones will relish the latest Muppets movie.  The puppets travel to Europe and get mixed up in a jewel theft.  The jewel thief is a dead ringer for Kermit the Frog which leaves lots of room for mix-ups.  The PG rated film will offend no one.  It last a full and exact two hours so prepare for  a long sit if you have very young ones.

I'm all for the Shakespearian comedy of misidentification, but the Muppets could have taken it over the edge as I think Jim Jensen (SP) would have wanted it. The only segments that I believe came close to that weirdness were the scenes with Kermit in the gulag. The imposter plot fell short of that expectation.",1469664000,,483,4.627906976744186

It has the same humor, intelligence, and overall feel of the Muppets under Jim Henson's genius, even more so that The Muppets (2011) which was also great. Not only are the Muppets back in their original, brilliant form film-wise, but musically they shine again as they did in the Henson era of the late 70's/early 80's. And the music! The music is probably my favorite take away from Muppets Most Wanted, as well as it's predecessor. Another thing I love about the newest Muppet films is that it is quite obvious that the people who made this film and wrote the music were also long-time Muppets fans, much like myself. I know that both James Bobin and Bret McKenzie are in my same age group, so I imagine they probably love them at least as much as I do, and likely for as long as I have. I can't give Bret McKenzie enough praise for his musical contributions to the Muppets. He deserves every award and accolade he has received, and then some. Jim Henson would most definitely be proud to have him on board. If only the failed Muppets series reboot had employed these same geniuses, or at least tried to copy what they did....if only...*sigh*",1469145600,3,1426,4.4884615384615385

6136212,4,B00H7E8KVI,"Muppets Most Wanted picks up where The Muppets (2011) left off. Fresh off their great stage show in the US, they are told to take their schtick on a World Tour.
Rickey Gervais becomes their Tour Manager, and a switcheroo lands Kermit behind bars and a super criminal leading the Muppets in what turns out to be a Jewel Heist. This movie is loaded with celebrities, some playing themselves-Christoph Waltz, Lady Gaga, Tony Bennet, Usher; some acting as Russians-Ray Liotta & Jemaine Clement, and Ty Burrell as a French Interpol Officer. The cameos are great, the Muppets are real puppets (not CGI).

Video-wise, the colors are vibrant when needed a clear picture quality. Audio is fine, lots of singing. The extras add some more laughs, love the old guys (Waldorf & Statler) and Gervais laughing is a riot, and lets not forget Bret McKenzies great music video.

I thought this was a fun movie. There are plenty of things kids will like and plenty adults will laugh at. If you like The Muppets, youll enjoy this movie. Stay through the end as the credits roll, there are a few gags until the end.

are you havin a laugh?""",1456963200,4,1119,4.641414141414141
6136213,3,B00H7E8KVI,I liked the movie and my kids enjoyed it too. However I feel like the movie was really directed at adults. The funniest and cleverest jokes were way over kids heads.

Kermit's voice is a little off - now that Jim Henson has passed, no one can quite imitate Kermit like him. But the personalities of the Muppets are still the same, and my favorite is still Beaker (who is hilarious in this movie.)

The slapstick and borderline-idiotic comedy are hilarious, and if you're as big a fan of the original Muppets as I am, you'll love every bit of this movie.",1456617600,,571,4.428571428571429

I was wrong, because this one is FAR better than the 2011 film!  Good gags, human actors did a good job, good (if outdated) plot, and the MUSIC was GREAT!  I keep getting ""I'll Give You What You Want"" stuck in my head!  And I didn't get that ""it's all computer graphics"" feel.

6136252,5,B00H7E8KVI,"Got to say that, although there are overwhelmingly positive reviews here, the few negative ones take me by surprise. Okay, the plot is not in any way up to the standards of the Pixar films, but how could it be? As a character amusingly points out during the film, this is actually the seventh Muppets film and total originality is not going to be on the agenda. But the strength of the Muppets, despite its ownership now by Disney, is that it can still within the first five minutes mock studios in their ongoing search for franchises, mock Pixar itself and also recognise its very nature as self-aware 'product'. But, aside from Ray Liotta's hypnotised turn in an incredibly minor role (he was much better the last time he was drafted into the Muppets family), where else could you expect to see Ricky Gervais, Tina Fey, Salma Hayek and Christopher Waltz together onscreen alongside a frog and a pig? And when the jokes are this good, and my 6 year old son laughed throughout, I'd have to call this instalment of an endless franchise a real success!",1440028800,,1050,4.620320855614973

On its own, it isn't terrible, it's just the absence of Jim Henson and the other original muppet people is palpable.",1434931200,,279,4.6
6136272,5,B00H7E8KVI,"I was one of the few (it seems) who wasn't thrilled with the recent attempts to bring back The Muppets franchise, so I didn't rush out to watch Muppets Most Wanted.  I did, however, go ahead and buy the movie when it first hit Blu-Ray.  And I just got it watched if that tells you anything.  But I am thrilled I bought it and am kicking myself for not watching it sooner because this movie is wonderful.

The movie picks up right after the end of the last one.  Literally.  I mean, it opens with the The End fireworks.  Clearly, this means that studio has ordered a sequel.  And as the Muppets brainstorm a plot, they hit on a perfect story and things get under way.

Flushed with the success of their come back (from the last movie), The Muppets have decided to go on an international tour.  They have signed up with Dominic Badguy (its French and not pronounced as it looks.  Really!  Would he like to us?) (Oh, and hes played by Ricky Gervais.) who will help arrange the dates and locations for this tour.  And they start in Europe  Germany to be exact.

However, Constantine, the number 1 villain and worlds most dangerous frog, has managed to escape from the Russian gulag where hes been held.  Hes a ringer for Kermit the Frog  except for a mole.  As Kermit gets captured in Constantines place, Constantine pretends to be Kermit and uses their tour as cover for his evil scheme.  Will anyone realize the switch in time to free Kermit and save the day?

Okay, so its not the most original plot, but I didn't care.  You know why?  I was having so much fun along the way it really didn't matter.  The action was fast moving and actually held up pretty well with no major plot holes.  Okay, I don't expect perfection from the Muppets, but still, there wasn't anything that made me roll my eyes.  There are even some tender moments between the characters as the movie went along.

First and foremost, this movie remembered that it was a comedy, and thats why I loved it.  The jokes were plentiful and rapid fire.  In fact, Im sure I missed some as I was laughing at the one that had just come before.  The laughs start with the opening number and continue right until the end.

As always, there are plenty of cameos that added to the fun.  Ill leave it to you to figure out who appeared.  The main three human stars are Ricky Gervais, Ty Burrell, who plays an inspector that teams up with Sam the Eagle to try to track the mysterious bad guys, and Tina Fey, who plays the chief at the gulag.  The song Tina sings when we first meet her is hysterical.  All three of them are top notch making us believe in the magic of the Muppet world.  The Muppet performers are great as well.  Truly, there isn't a bad moment in the film.

That includes the songs which never slow things down but always advance the story or provide us with wonderful laughs (usually both).

The Blu-Ray has three versions of the film.  Theres the original theater cut, the Unnecessarily Extended Edition, and the Statler and Waldorf cut.  Youve already spent longer reading this review than it would take to watch the Statler and Waldorf cut (and I think you).  Still, its good for a quick laugh.  And I must take exception to the name of the Unnecessarily Extended Edition.  Thats actually the one I chose to watch.  Afterwards, I watched the opening scene in the theatrical edition.  Some of my favorite jokes in that first scene had been cut for theaters.  Seriously, you need to watch those extra 14 minutes.  You will thank me as the jokes are so funny.

And really, thats what makes or breaks a Muppet movie or show of any kind.  As I said at the outset, Im glad I bought Muppets Most Wanted because I will definitely be watching it again.  Its light, fun entertainment that will leave you laughing.",1434758400,,3775,4.423580786026201

I have grown up on everything muppets.
After watching the 2011 Muppets movie and hating it- I hesitated to watch this movie.
Waited until it was on HBO
and now I really wish I had seen it in the theatre.

Lots of fun celebrity cameos.

The human actors are used well without upstaging the Muppets or being marginalized by them.

6136398,5,B00H7E8KVI,"I grew up with ""The Muppets"" (I was 4 when the Original Movie came out!) It is my generation of Fans who are the original viewers of the phenomenon that is ""The Muppets"".
Between ""Manhattan"" and the 2011 Jason Segal film, us original Muppet Fans were left high and dry thinking ""It's truly over"" But after the few failed films of the 1990's, 2011 came back with Our Muppets, the ones we love and remember. We were simply overjoyed. And honestly, when I first heard about ""The Muppets Most Wanted"" I worried. I thought they were just going to capitalize on the 2011 film with some silly plot and sub-par songs. When I saw this film I was more than pleasantly surprised.
The three humans (Gervais, Burrell and Fey) are amazing. But like another review said, the TRUE stars of this film are The Muppets themselves who do not get upstaged by their human being co-stars.
The film is full of surprises, subtle jokes, great original songs (Bret McKenzie who is a true talent) and a plot that even my movie-snob father (who will only watch Academy Award Winning Mysteries) enjoyed.
Constantine is funny, how they made an Evil Kermit Twin funny AND believable is beyond me, but they did it. I didn't even check this film out until it came out on DVD that is how skeptical I was. Now I just can't stop watching (and sharing it)",1416009600,,1317,4.514644351464435

6136415,2,B00H7E8KVI,"From the moment they burst upon the scene in the 1970s, The Muppets have invariably been more likable and charming than their material. Their eighth cinematic venture, ""Muppets Most Wanted,""  is no exception. The movie finds the gang ostensibly launching a comeback world tour, when, in reality, they are merely being used as pawns in an elaborate series of heists all across Europe, culminating in the nabbing of the Crown Jewels. Ricky Gervais is the group`s ""manager"" who is actually the criminal mastermind behind the heists.

As co-written by Nicholas Stoller and director James Dobin, ""Muppets Most Wanted"" features a tired storyline, pointless musical interludes, some thudding one-liners, and a barrage of pop culture references that seem way above the heads of the movie's target demographic - unless the writers are actually aiming for the nostalgic baby boomer crowd, in which case we have a lot more serious problem here than just a mediocre movie. That also might explain the presence in the non-puppet cast of such luminaries as Tina Fey, Ty Burrell, and a host of famous ""guest stars"" too numerous to mention.

The palette is colorful and the puppetry first-rate, but the movie is way overlong and loses most of its luster after the novelty of seeing The Muppets performing together again wears off (which is very quickly). ""Muppets Most Wanted"" proves once again that, like many of the good things in life, The Muppets are probably best when taken in very small doses.",1415232000,,1484,5.024390243902439

6136442,4,B00H7E8KVI,"A MAJOR improvement over ""The Muppets"" (2011), ""Muppets Most Wanted"" is funnier, more original, and just more *Muppets.*

The 2011 movie had several problems that this movie mostly fixed. The last movie was cute, but didn't feel quite like a real Muppet movie. The plot was just a rehash of the same ""save the theater!"" cliche we've seen a hundred times; the human guest stars were bland; and that horrible Gary Stu Walter hijacked the show. I appreciate that the movie re-introduced the Muppets to the new generation of kids, but beyond that, it did nothing to advance the Muppet franchise. In ""Muppets Most Wanted,"" the plot is fresh, the human guest stars are as outrageous as the Muppets, the entire soundtrack is great, and they actually introduced a new Muppet who's interesting and funny.

PLOT:

This time, instead of the same ""save the theater, and learn to believe in ourselves!"" routine, there's an actual *story.* The Muppets are on a world tour, unknowingly aiding two jewel thieves, one of whom steals Kermit's identity. Kermit fights to escape a Russian gulag, while Sam Eagle and a Frenchman track after the Muppets, determined to solve a mystery about stolen art. Even for a corny comedy like a Muppet film, there's still a lot of fun to be had with a multi-layered plot like this. This story is unique. There are parallels to be drawn between this movie and ""The Great Muppet Caper,"" which is a bit better, but it's different enough to feel like it's own separate story.

CHARACTERS:

No one Gary Stu hogs the spotlight this time. With multiple plotlines, there is room for several characters to shine. Any fans of Kermit and Piggy will be happy to see their relationship get more development than usual (with Piggy questioning what she really wants from Kermit). Fozzie and Animal both get to show their heroic sides, as they track after Kermit (though, sadly, Scrappy Doo--I mean Walter--joins them.) I was pleasantly surprised to see Sam Eagle given his own subplot, possibly for the first time in any Muppet movie. Finally, the new villain Constantine, is hilarious, and is now up there on my personal list of favorites, along with Gonzo, Rizzo and Pepe.

Gonzo fans will be disappointed to see that the blue weirdo has a small role, doesn't interact with his best friend Rizzo, and even had his great verse cut from the Interrogation song (the full version is on the soundtrack). But Gonzo's one scene, the Indoor Running of the Bull, is fantastic, and so-very-Gonzo.

The *human* characters are also one of the best things about this film. The correct recipe for a human guest star in a Muppet movie is, to act as over-the-top crazy as any of the Muppets, but *play* that craziness dead-straight, never once acting as if they're talking to a puppet. Mr. Badguy, Inspector Napoleon, and Nadya all fit that bill beautifully. In my book, all three of them are up there on the list of best-human-characters-in-Muppet-movies, along with Tim Curry's Long John Silver and Michael Caine's Scrooge.

The only problem with the cast is, yes, Walter....and by extension, Fozzie. Since Walter is the new secondary lead after Kermit, he winds up stealing personality traits and roles that *should* go to Fozzie. Fozzie is Kermit's best friend, and traditionally, the Muppet with the biggest heart. *He* should have been the first to notice that something was ""wrong"" with Kermit, not Walter; and *he* should have been the one feeling the most guilty about how they all treated Kermit, later on; not Walter. I could tolerate Walter more easily if he wasn't kicking the classic Muppets out of their own roles. Walter could work fine as a minor character, just a cute kid who travels with the group; but he has no business among the main cast.

SONGS:

The soundtrack to ""Muppets Most Wanted"" is great. Unlike the last movie, which tried hard to be ""cool,"" with pop-like songs and a cliche rap number, ""Most Wanted"" treats its musical numbers like *musical numbers.* And the styles range dramatically: from a cane-and-top-hat opening number (""We're Doin' A Sequel!""), to the hilariously dramatic ""Interrogation Song,"" to a joyful soul song about the gulag, to a spicy '80s parody, it's all great.

HUMOR:

Though this movie is tons of fun, I can't entirely say it's one of the *funniest* of the Muppet movies. But there are certainly memorable moments. The ""badge envy"" scene comes to mind. The many comical comparisons between Sam Eagle's American attitude towards work, and the lax attitude of his French comrade, were also highly amusing (the coffee scene in particular). Constantine's addiction to blowing things up also made me laugh hysterically in the theater.

FLAWS:

The main reasons I gave this four stars, instead of five, are:
*  Walter (being overused)
* The babies (they're not cute or funny, they're disturbing)
* Butchering the Interrogation Song (seriously, listen to the soundtrack version: it's great! The movie version is choppy and awkward, though the visuals are funny.)
* Not quite as funny as past Muppet movies
* Finally, no matter how wonderful a Muppet movie is, I can never give five stars if one of the movie's stars isn't Gonzo. Just my personal taste.",1413936000,2,5190,4.888509670079636

This movie is yet another example of Disney taking something pure and well written and turning it into a garbage truck full of Disney crud. The movie starts bad and ends up bad. CGI Kermit (or the anti-hero of Kermit) is a gross joke taking away any puppet realism (and yes I am laughing while I write that) while he does Kung-Fu moves that look terrible in idea as well as delivery. The dialogue is horrific...geared away from us who love them...but that is not enough. It is an attempt to make our kids AS DUMB AS POSSIBLE. There is nothing clever...there is nothing coy...there is nothing gentle and heartwarming. There is only a bad commercial for what Disney wants us to buy next...and believe me...you should not partake.

The only reason this gets even 1/8 a star is that the cameo appearances are done by wonderful performers who, I am assuming, had no idea how this over-edited, dumb written, craptastic disaster of a muppet movie would end up.

Ricky Gervais fit in with the Muppets so well, Ty Burell made a humorous French cop, and Tina Fey was lots of fun. While a lot of the Muppet movies seem like the same thing again and again, for this film it was like they took your typical movie plot and threw Muppets in, but in a good way! And like usual, there were too many cameos to count, catchy songs, and plenty of Muppet humor.

As for the Blu-ray combo pack it's self, I like that the have the extended edition on there and the bloopers. I think Gervais had too much fun making this movie, given by how often he was cracking up in them.",1412121600,,706,4.115942028985507

6136541,4,B00H7E8KVI,"FUN! Plain and simple. The plot is very enjoyable, my daughter loved it. There's a wide range of actors and actresses that make cameos, and some that stay throughout the movie that I would have never imagined to participate. All of them along with all your usual characters stuck in here and there.

Muppets: Most Wanted, is brilliant in telling the story of family. Along with the mix up of a world known master mind criminal. His identity is criss crossed with Kermit's. So you can imagine the rest, but you really should watch this.

Overall all there's a good message to overlook your ego for things that matter in life. My daughter loved this movie till the end. It was almost like going to a theme park in your living room. Much better than their last film in my opinion. So if you've watched everything for kids recently except this, get it.

6136546,2,B00H7E8KVI,"Was very disappointed with this one, especially when we consider how good the Jason Segel comeback movie for the Muppets was a few years ago.  This one seems to be a hastily written sequel to cash in on that one's success.  The human actors in this one are big names, but apart from Gervais really weren't given an opportunity to shine.  Ty Burrell (Modern Family) got too caught up in trying to put on a fake French accent and act like a bumbling fool, and wasting lines comparing the size of one's badge with American Eagle.  The only funny line he had, this car has been banned in most countries due to it being too big, was impact wise destroyed by the fact that in the background every other car was a normal regular sized car.  A bit of investment in making other fake small cars for the background would have made this joke work.

Tina Fey plays an obsessed fan of Kermit who runs the Gulag in Siberia where Kermit is mistakenly imprisoned after the similar looking Constantine escapes and puts a plan in place to switch places.  Although Fey does an all right job in her part, it's let down by how unbelievable this scenario is.  First of all Constantine blew up the prison when he escaped, yet this is forgotten about.  Everyone there speaks English, even the prisoners in the yard when he arrives, surely Kermit's main problem in not being able to prove who is should have been the language barrier.  Everyone after a minute or so (prisoners and staff) call Kermit, Kermit, so they know who he is but no one lets him out or reports this, since Constantine killed a heap of guards when he escaped, you'd think they'd want him back there.  Tina Fey's character you can understand but not the others.

The writing is just poor overall.  Europe seemed to be like pre wall coming down Eastern Europe, clothing wise and behaviour of citizens in Germany, Spain and elsewhere.  Why would a German police van, transport Kermit all the way to the Eastern half of Russia?  It would have had to drive through other countries before it even got to Russia.  Basic geography (or simply looking at a map) doesn't seem to be something the scriptwriters were ever taught.  A truck can drive to London from Siberia over night.  Flying in that time would have been a stretch.  We have a train that can somehow get to Dublin from Madrid ignoring the fact you've got the sea in between land masses. Speaking of transport we also have a helicopter that can hover in the air while a lengthy scene goes on with no pilot. The fact Constantine doesn't sound at all like Kermit yet no one really notices or just accepts he's got a cold or other weak excuses really is treating child audiences like their stupid.  At one point a character has to choose which is which, surely just saying talk would have sufficed there.  The Kermit puppet seems to be new, as especially in the opening scenes you can notice the hand operating the head through the material, something I've never noticed in previous movies or the Muppet show.

The songs aren't catchy at all.  In Segel's Muppet movie they were memorable, got stuck in your head and you actively sought out the soundtrack as you wanted to hear them again.  There isn't one decent song on this film's soundtrack.  They even bring out Cline Dion to further ruin your experience at one point in this one.

The only thing that scrapes this up a star in rating and maybe gives it a check it out if you can on TV or somewhere else for free is the nostalgic factor of it's The Muppets, you'll see many characters from your childhood once again.  I liked the fight scenes with Constantine escaping the Gulag, we actually get to see Kermit's puppet body act like a real frog for the first time, leaping like a real one and other frog actions as Constantine dispatches the guards. Disappointingly we never see this frog behaviour from either character for the rest of the film. We get to see what Kermit and Miss Piggy's offspring would actually look like in a fantasy scene from her mind.  That is interesting and something that's been discussed widely in popular culture when their relationship has been mentioned over the decades.

The Muppet characters don't really drive the plot or any of its outcomes, they are really just there in the background and left standing around in the aftermath.  They really have to bring back Jason Segel to write the next one if The Muppets are going to continue on as a franchise.",1411257600,,4437,4.551637279596977

I did find some of the humor funny,  (Josh Groban hidden scene) it was too few and far between. I remember the muppets from being a kid and raising kids and I think they miss the mark by trying to make a drama within what should just be chaos and skits... It just makes for an uncomfortable ride.

I felt like Kermit wasn't Kermit (no I don't mean Constantine I mean Kermit) I felt like he had some sort of personality change. There was way way too little of the other muppets, the plot was pretty weak, and the ending was cheesy even for a muppet movie. The jokes weren't bad but they didn't make up for the lack of heart.

While this installment of the Muppets falls a little flat, it suffers from being merely good. The original three films, and The Muppets are great. Keep that in mind.

Muppets Most Wanted skews slightly younger in the jokes and music. There is a lot of singing, even for a Muppet movie. Still, the film has its moments (more than a few good belly laughs), moves at a brisk pace and is a welcome piece of family entertainment. It is sweet, and loving, as a Muppets movie should be. My 2 year old loved it and we watched it several times over the course of our rental.  It held up and so did I, so that's a testament to the film.",1409616000,,764,4.155405405405405

We know it was done right because the songs get stuck in your head.  My husband sings ""am I a man or am I a Muppet"" in the shower almost daily. But this movie just didn't do it.

Kermit, the group's current manager, is against the idea but eventually agrees ... only to learn that Dominic is in league with the world's most cunning villain, Constantine, an evil frog who resembles Kermit exactly (with the exception of a mole on his face) and has just escaped a Russian gulag in Siberia.  The innocent Kermit, after getting a fake mole attached to his face by Constantine, is captured by the Russians ... as Constantine, using a horrid Kermit impersonation, starts the Muppet gang on their world tour - in reality, a cover for a series of daring robberies around the globe.  The film is funny at times (kids should love it), but this one lacks the real heart and soul that made the first one so terrific, a few weak musical numbers also dragging it down a bit.",1409529600,4,1065,4.684491978609626

The jokes at the expense of the stereotypes of Europe were lukewarm at best (capital of comedy, Berlin Germany; sacrosanct lunch and vacation time for Europeans).

We adults laughed about the European extended holiday and break schedule (my husband is European, and this humor was repeated several times which we thought was really funny), though this went over my kids' heads. The cast was fantastic! We are big fans of Tina Fey and Rick Gervais. There are many cameos as well. All in all a great movie for younger and older kids!

The whole Constantine/Kermit issue (while expected since it was the set up of the whole movie) wasn't funny.  They tried, but it just felt flat.  The Cameos, while they were great people (Celine Deon, Lady Gaga, Tom Hiddleston) were even less of a cameo than you would suspect.  Celine Deon was supposed to be Piggy's fairy godmother, but she didn't even speak to her.  The muppets themselves brought up that having spent the previous movie getting Kermit's human relative into the muppets (only to supposedly leave now) was done at the cost of an older, less developed character (his frog nephew.)

I was a fan, but it didn't see like something Henson would have stamped approval on. This film by contrast is fun, full of cameos and follows a classic ""caper/hi-jinx"" storyline.

If you like Tina Fey, I think she really steals the show, but some of the other cameos are pretty awesome too. All in all it works, and it a pleasure to see.",1408406400,3,576,4.433962264150943

6136709,4,B00H7E8KVI,"Its always a great pleasure to see another big-screen Muppet movie. Like the earlier film with Jason Siegel, director James Bobin makes Herculean efforts to recapture the style, flair and glorious inanity of the original Muppet Show, thus the segments of the film featuring the actual show are the most fan-appealing. All the major Muppets and some lesser-known ones get a chance to shine in the most Muppety way possible.

The new movie has lots of color, great songs, clever cameos, very savvy scripting and skillfully timed direction going for it. But theres still something missing. A jewel heist story was already done back in the 70s. Muppet movies seem to work better when they satirize show business, advertising or some other ripe-for-ridiculousness institution. Granted, the stakes are much higher here than they might have been in The Great Muppet Caper. Both films even have an Esther Williams-swimming cavalcade scene, though it was more lavish in Caper.

That wouldnt matter so much if Ricky Gervais was either a supporting character than the co-star, was given more comedy to do, or was left to improvise so he would have been as funny as he is in the outtakes. Gervais is a great comic star, but not a movie star. Nor does he have the widespread appeal to justify how much screen time his character gets. This is in no way a criticism of him nor his talent, just a comment about how he might have been better utilized.

Ty Burrell, who gets just the right amount of screen time, making one want to see more, delivers his customary screen stealing performanceperfectly teamed with Sam the Eagle. Yes, his character is a Clouseau type, but he could easily play Clouseau. Nobody does determined cluelessness like Burrell. Tina Fey also takes on a tasty comic character role as the head of a Siberian prison, with convict show tunes (and incongruous cameos) worthy of Mel Brooks.

Like the last film, the songs are perfect for The Muppets and have a quality on their own that justifies more attention than they get. It was a shame that singer/songwriter Bret McKenzie did not get an appearance on the Academy Awards telecast, since that would have deservedly raised his profile. At least he is showcased to advantage is a music video with Miss Piggy (Bret looks a little like a bearded, lanky Herb Alpert).

Muppets Most Wanted is very good, yet not quite great. Theres a lot here to love, though, especially seeing the old gang (as well as welcome newcomer Walter) doing whatever it takes to get them on screen. Even on the classic Muppet Show, some episodes were better than others but it didn't matter because The Muppets were the main raison Dtre to tune in (aint I continental?).

Bonus Features are fine (but no commentary, sigh). Theres a blooper reel with a funny title about it being the longest ever, maybe. Again, Ricky Gervais is funnier here than he is in the movie. I realize he was playing a villain (Mr. Badguy), but they might have added in some of his infectious laughter.",1408406400,2,3002,4.77456647398844

6136721,5,B00H7E8KVI,"The Muppets returned to the big screen this year (2014) in Disney's ""Muppets Most Wanted"", their 8th film and a somewhat direct sequel to their previous film, ""The Muppets"". This is worth noting, because ""The Muppets"" was a real game changer for Jim Henson's much-beloved felt family. The group had been in something of a rut for years until the Jason Segel driven 2011 film gave them the revival they severely needed and deserved. The final product was something of a comeback masterpiece, an Oscar winning success that would have been impossible for any follow-up film to match. The dynamic simply would no longer be there for any sequel to The Muppets, that instant importance of breathing life into a treasured franchise that seemed all but dead to anyone but the truest fans (like myself). Most of us new that and weren't looking to compare the two films so much as we were just looking for another fun Muppet movie that lived up to those of the Henson era. That's just what we got. ""Muppets Most Wanted"" is not THE best Muppet movie in existence, but I'd still rank it as one of the best.

In ""Most Wanted"" the Muppets pick up right where they left off in the previous film, making it more of a direct sequel, as I'd mentioned, which is not really something the group has done before. Previous Muppet movies appear to be wholly unrelated. The human cast from the last movie is gone though, and the Muppet gang finds themselves unclear of what to do next. They're together again, they're popular again, they have a new member named Walter (and 80's Robot appears to be part of the group now too), and it soon comes to their attention that the studio has ordered a sequel! This leads to the first of many WONDERFUL musical numbers: ""We're Doing a Sequel"". Just as the excellent James Bobin returned to direct this second new Muppet outing, songwriter Bret McKenzie of Flight of the Conchords fame (and the reason the last film won an Academy Award) also returned the write the songs again, and thank goodness! Bret is without a doubt one of the main reasons these new Muppet films have been so outstanding. His ability to write excellent and hilarious songs in any style, as seen before on the Flight of the Conchords TV series, has proven perfect for the Muppets, and I especially like ""We're Doing a Sequel"" because of how much it sounds like something longtime Muppet songwriter Paul Williams might have written! Just like the last film, ""Muppets Most Wanted"" is filled to the brim with wonderful songs of this outstanding quality. But, back to the storyline. While contemplating a plot for their new sequel, they are approached by an agent named Dominic Badguy (Ricky Gervais), who suggests to them that the Muppets should take their classic vaudeville show on a world tour. And so, they do! Of course, this is just part of an international crime caper plot to frame the Muppets for the crimes of Dominic and his boss, the most evil frog in the world, Constantine! Constantine has escaped from the Gulag, a Siberian prison, and soon trades places with Kermit the Frog, who finds himself locked up in the frozen fortress. From then on, the film moves between Kermit's attempts at a great escape, the gang's world tour being confusingly managed by the completely inept Constantine in the guise of Kermit, the bad guys' crime conspiracy and the attempts by French Interpol agent Jean Pierre Napoleon (Ty Burrell) and C.I.A. agent Sam Eagle to find the real culprits.

That's about all I can say without getting into spoilers. In true Muppet fashion, there are a ton of cameos in this film, and a third star in Tina Fey as the head guard of the Gulag who develops a special fondness for Kermit. The human cast is a riot, especially in doing brilliant Bret McKenzie songs. The Muppets are in great form as well, a few oddly sounding voice replacements aside (really, that was Janice? Anyone can do a good Janice! Who was that supposed to be?). I'm still getting used to the new Piggy voice, though for most of the film she was better here than in the last one. I also feel like Fozzie Bear has been waaay stupider lately than he used to be under Henson. I kinda miss the old, not really THAT stupid Fozzie, who was just not really very good at telling jokes and a bit naive. Ever since Treasure Island he's had a severe mental disability. But, the previous film had these issues too, and they are not worth dwelling on in the grand scheme of things (though the powers that be SHOULD take note of and address them). The movie itself is fantastically funny, even if the European crime caper plot is one the Muppets have tackled before, making it a bit of an odd choice when there are so many other genres they could have gone with.

So, you may be wondering why so many people find this people lacking. Well, this can be as simple as a flawed sense of humor in the viewer, or just a hatred for sequels or certain specifics of the film or cast. I mention these points purely because I can only see one noticeable issue that any longtime Muppet fan should have with this film, and that's the simple fact that it is pure comedy. Don't get me wrong, it has its sentimental and emotional moments, but they are in the style one would expect in a pure comedy. They aren't lingered on and they are still made light of. This is a bit different from most if not all the previous Muppet films, in which when things get emotional, it's done in a serious, makin' ya misty eyed sorta way. That adds a weight to a film that makes it more than a comedy. However, is this really a flaw? Not when what you are trying to make is a pure comedy. But, people are used to Muppet films being more well-rounded rather than just being pure comedy 100 percent of the time, hence the complaining. So, basically, this is a great film, but there you have it: It is purely a comedy. Watch it to laugh, but not to get as sentimental as you might watching the previous Muppet films. This movie is out to crack you up, and if you have a sense of humor, it really should!

Now, as for the bonus features in the blu-ray edition, which naturally looks and sounds fantastic, this is where one finds the release of ""Muppets Most Wanted"" more lacking than the film itself. Disney pushes this as a ""Unnecessarily Extended"" Edition. This means that the film comes with two versions: The theatrical cut and the extended cut. Some prefer the theatrical cut, but really, I might prefer the extended cut. It is simply a bit more jokes and stuff, and it's as good as the rest of the film and seamlessly integrated, so really, there is no reason not to opt for watching the longer version. If I hadn't seen the theatrical version in a while, I could easily believe they were one in the same. There are a few scenes where you might catch that you've never seen them before, but that's about it. The funny thing is, the ads for this release brag that there are three versions of the film. The third is a very brief joke, not a full version of the film. It skirts the label of false advertising. Aside from that is a blooper reel, a short comedy bit of Rizzo the Rat writing a fake fan-letter to the filmmakers to complain about not being in the previous film (he and Robin get a nice if sad and brief acknowledgement this time around, and this little bonus carries on that note), and finally, there is a music video of one of the funniest songs in the film (though they are all very funny), ""I'll Get You What You Want"", performed by Bret McKenzie. The last bonus feature is great for Flight of the Conchords fans. Still, this isn't a very long roster of extra features, and the way I've seen this pushed in commercials, I can't help but wonder why. There are no behind the scenes interviews, there's no commentary, no trailer, no Monsters University short (Party Central, which played before the film in theaters), and still no ""Muppets at Walt Disney World"" 80's TV special, Disney! It's... not as spectacular a release as toted, but it's still got some stuff, and sometimes with Disney it's a surprise to get much of anything, so I'm not complaining too much, but a few of those things shouldn't be missing. Feel free to pick and choose which yourself. As for the included DVD of the film, that only includes the McKenzie music video and the theatrical version.

Regardless of whether or not the amount of extras satisfies you though, I highly recommend picking ""Muppets Most Wanted"" up. Despite what people say, as a musical comedy, it is fantastic and probably holds more laughs than most of the Muppet films people say are superior (I love all those films too, but people get carried away when they get on a nostalgic soapbox and are always a bit hard on sequels). As a pure comedy, this is a different style of film than those before it, and maybe there is a tradition there that shouldn't be broken, since the core fanbase is probably a very essential aspect of the Muppets' survival. But this is still a great film and those McKenzie songs matched with so many great personalities, human AND Muppet, are a HUGE part of the reason why.",1408320000,4,9094,4.522478736330498

6136739,5,B00H7E8KVI,"This is a review more about the Blu-Ray than the movie, although I will say that I never got into the muppets, and haven't really paid attention to the movies that much until this one.  I really liked this one, but I'm not a Muppet ""purist"" so I didn't feel that it detracted at all.  As an adult with a 10 year old son, this one was FAR more fun for me to watch as a grownup.

But after seeing the movie, my son, as always, wanted the soundtrack.  I agreed, I loved the songs.  But we were surprised at how much longer most of the songs were - and a subsequent viewing of the movie had the shorter songs verified again.  We loved some of the lines in the soundtrack songs that they cut out of the movie.

So the Blu-Ray immediately got 5 stars from us because they included the extended version of the movie, which has the songs in their entirety, just like on the soundtrack, with all the great lines they cut out of the standard movie version.

The extras aren't much of a surprise, since they had them on You Tube and such for a while now, the Rizzo's Biggest Fan and the ""alternate"" cut from the old hecklers that was just their couple moments in the movie as ""The Whole Movie.""  But they did have what they called the longest blooper reel in Muppet History.  And it had some good parts in there, although I think they went overboard with the Ricky Gervais laughing all the time.  But it was fun to watch him cracking up when he was trying to deliver his lines, which really was a neat insight to how much fun he must have had working on this movie.

The sound is great, full surround, and the transfer was well done.  It looks awesome on our big LED TV.  And there are a lot of extra scenes as well that were not in the original movie.  All told there's about 12 more minutes of movie here, including a great scene from outside a bathroom door with Constantine and Dominic arguing over who has to go, repeating number one and number two.  There's only a few ""new"" scenes, but many of the scenes actually have just a few extra lines in them, which in some cases actually explain a few things in more detail.

So if you or your kid liked the movie, this is definitely the version to get.  And it includes a DVD as well, and their digital copy.  Even if it was just the Blu-Ray disc and nothing else, this would've been worth it for me to get the full songs in the movie with the extra scenes.",1407974400,15,2396,4.180827886710239

The issue I have with the Blu-Ray is that Disney decided to go with DTS-HD HR audio on the disc. It's not bad, but for a movie with such great songs, why wouldn't you go with lossless audio? This may not affect everyone, but for those of us with good sound systems, it makes a difference.

6136749,4,B00H7E8KVI,"This film, with its memorable music, wild humor and very brief cameos, is more like the classic Muppet movies of the 80's than any that have come out since. Bravo!

While I like Jason Segel's 2011 ""The Muppets"" and appreciate the effort at bringing the Muppets back, too much of the film reduced the Muppets to supporting characters with reductive personalities recreating their greatest hits. The characters needed to be reintroduced and there probably wasn't a much better way to do it, but it was not the classic Muppet mania that I grew up with. Nor are the films like Christmas Carol or Treasure Island that were both preoccupied with their human leads too. And Muppets From Space threw out original music numbers, and much of the charm, in the process of the fated 1999 film.

Muppets Most Wanted sets things right. This film serves as the fourth true contender after Jim Henson's original trilogy of The Muppet Movie, The Great Muppet Caper and The Muppets Take Manhattan. I don't understand why modern auds have trouble with humor that marries silliness with sophistication in the classic Muppet tradition like this film did. It's not perfect, but it is extraordinary. I loved this film! 4 out of 5 Stars.

PS - Too bad Amazon has decided to screw its faithful customers by holding Disney Blu-ray and DVD pre-orders hostage until the day before release[such as this one and Captain America 2] in order to increasingly extort more money from distributors: http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/amazon-takes-the-muppets-off-the-shelf/ This movie and many others are available at reasonable prices from countless other online retailers like Target and Best Buy.

6136755,4,B00H7E8KVI,"Continuing right where the Muppets left off, Muppets Most Wanted isn't as original or entertaining as the first one in 2011. Perhaps a lot of us were caught off guard by how amazingly fresh it felt for a Muppets movie to come out in this day and age. Likewise, Muppets Most Wanted is still an enjoyable flick, whether compared to other films or not. More emphasis is on the Muppets themselves rather than the split focus between the human characters and the Muppets in the first movie. Specifically, Kermit is pretty much given top billing. The human characters, to be honest, are really here to move the plot forward, which is actually a wise decision by the screenwriters to make sure the movie doesn't forget what its title refers to.

The musical numbers are not bad, but this time around there's not any that stick out in particular. There definitely feels like a lot more celebrity cameos, a staple of the Muppets franchise. Some are obvious (ex. Usher, Tom Hiddleston) while some you might miss entirely (ex. James McAvoy). These trademark characteristics are all wrapped around a plot that's only unpredictable for little kids. But this film succeeds where it has to, and that's the humor and non-offensive screenwriting. Families who've watched the first film will probably not find Muppets Most Wanted to be a better movie, but still a moderately enjoyable one.",1404086400,3,1371,4.884120171673819
6136756,4,B00H7E8KVI,"Reboots/sequels roughly fall into these three categories: heartless studio cash-grabs, worthwhile additions to the story, and the seldom seen 'even better than the first one.' Muppets Most Wanted fits pretty snugly into the 'worthwhile addition' category, although it is more ambitious and satisfying than most. It's a sequel that's totally self-aware and rides a very similar comedic wave as the 2011 reboot while having a new and engaging premise. Possibly the best aspects of the movie come from director/writer James Bobin's dry wit (there's a Seventh Seal reference in a Muppets movie?!) and Bret McKenzie's insanely catchy tunes. Their work from Flight of the Conchords is very similar to the tone and songwriting humor in the new Muppets movies and Jemaine Clement even has a minor role as a gulag prisoner. Match these ridiculously creative minds with a talented voice cast and the delightful personalities of Ricky Gervais and Tina Fey and the outcome is an always fun comedy for all ages. It's true that it doesn't quite match the quality of its predecessor, but it comes closer than the majority of sequels do.",1402358400,,1121,5.0978260869565215

With the same familiar tone of offbeat humor and vaudeville antics, the movie will be familiar and fun to all of the group's fans. This time with a European tour and jewelery heist as the centerpieces of the plot, my only complaint is the lack of Muppets in the movie. The ""evil Kermit"" villain and his sidekick receive more screentime and musical numbers than any of the regular cast. And the classic supporting characters all are given very little to do, from Gonzo down to the grumpy old men, or the shrimp and the guy who throws the fish.

6136761,5,B00H7E8KVI,"I grew up with The Muppets.  I have very fond memories of being a child and watching their films and visiting Disney and seeing their show and basically all things Muppet get me flushed with excitement.  When Jason Segel rebooted the franchise back in 2011, I was nervous but ultimately rewarded with a film that felt like a fresh and modern take on the classic Muppet direction, and while the film had its lulls, it served as a benchmark for better things to come.

That better thing was Muppets Most Wanted.

Picking up where 2011s film left off, Muppets Most Wanted finds our felt covered friends in need of some direction.  Where are they going to go from here?  Thats where Dominic Badguy comes in.  He misleads The Muppets, turns them against Kermit and then stages a switcheroo, replacing Kermit with the infamous Constantine, the worlds most dangerous frog.  With #1 and #2 in place (ranking of their infamy), the plan is set in motion.  Use a Muppet world tour as the perfect rouge  find the clues leading to the Crown Jewels in London.  Constantine poses as Kermit (a horrible impression and yet that is half the fun), which includes wooing Miss Piggy and destroying the whole show, as Dominic pulls the strings in order to make the heist, but with break-ins coinciding with the Muppet tour, it isn't long before the FBI/CIA team up to track them down.  In the meantime, Kermit finds himself in a Russian prison mistaken for Constantine and at the mercy of a crazed warden named Nadya who just so happens to be secretly in love with him and forces him to help with putting on a musical starring the prisoners (which include the likes of Ray Liotta, Tom Hiddleston, Danny Trejo and Josh Groban).

I know this sounds like a lot to process, but it all works so brilliantly.

The writing here is remarkably good.  The zingers all work, the gags (physical and verbal) all land and the pop culture references and cameos are inspired and hilarious to boot.  The multiple storylines remain fresh and exciting and never feel jumbled, forced and lost in the shuffle.  We get a complete story each time.  The entire prison segment works on its own, the entire heist plotline works on its own, the verbal spatter between Napoleon and Sam Eagle works on its own (and honestly, can we hand Ty Burrell and Eric Jacobson the award for Best Onscreen Team!), the love triangle between Kermit, Constantine and Miss Piggy (sort of) works on its own and yet they all fit together like a glove.

And everyone here gives this their all.  These cameos are so much more than mere actors phoning it in for a paycheck.  Ray Liotta WORKS it in that cabaret lineup.  Celine Dion pokes fun at her own persona in a mere song.  And don't even get me started on the likes of Tina Fey and Ty Burrell, who just ooze so much comedic energy here.

And the songs are all spectacular, especially the Interrogation Song (that whole scene is just brilliance thanks to the aforementioned team) and that opening Were Doing a Sequel sets the tone perfectly for this whole experience.

There isn't a lull to be had here, for every scene is perfectly spliced to keep us hooked, frame for frame.  I haven't had this much family fun at the movies in a long time.",1400716800,11,3224,4.5828970331588135
6136762,5,B00H7E8KVI,"This kermit reminds me of the Muppet Show or Muppets Take Manhattan.

6136763,4,B00H7E8KVI,"The Muppets are something that I hold near and dear to me. I grew up listening to Kermit albums, one of the best gifts I've ever received is a stuffed Kermit with a little scarf from my girlfriend, and I love even the most maligned outings of the crazy little guys. Yes, even ""Muppets From Space."" The 2011 film with Jason Segal and Amy Adams was a fantastic film and a great way to bring Muppets back to the mainstream. So, of course, expectations were high for the sequel, and right off the bat, the opening number tells us to taper our expectations for the sequel. And while it might not reach the general appeal brought to us by its predecessor, ""Muppets Most Wanted"" is not only a truly riotous film in its own right, but a worthy addition to the Muppets canon and a love letter to adult fans.

Kermit has been swapped with a lookalike known as Constatine, the ""world's most dangerous frog and number one criminal,"" and thrown into a Russian gulag overseen by quirky guard Nadya (played by Tina Fey, at the top of her game.) Meanwhile, Constantine and his accomplice (Ricky Gervais) are taking the rest of the Muppets on a world tour to cover up their insidious scheme to hunt down and steal the crown jewels in England. Despite his hilariously stilted accent, the rest of the gang thinks Constantine is really Kermit, and goes along with everything he says. Which is not much, considering he lets them do anything they want, which just so happens to be running the stage shows into the ground with outlandish acts that never cease to entertain, such as Gonzo's ""indoor running of the bulls"" or Christopher Waltz doing the waltz.

If that last joke was any indication, ""Most Wanted"" is a film that feels directly aimed at an adult audience who is familiar with the Muppets, and is pretty well-versed in pop culture. Everything about the film's sense of humor, from name-dropping Danny Trejo to  Constantine putting Vaseline on the camera while smooth-talking Miss Piggy, is mature. Not in the sense of bodily function or sex jokes, but in the sense that you'd have to be in on the joke to find most of it funny. On top of that, there are throwbacks and knowing nods to longtime fans, such as the calling out of Rizzo and Robin being absent in the last film. If that means anything to you, then ""Most Wanted"" is a gift from the movie gods. For those not versed in pop culture, or interested in finding a good movie for kids, I would urge you to look elsewhere. The theater I was in was actually full of children, but in the end, only the older teenagers and adults laughed at what was happening on screen, and I would argue that's because the movie is made for them.

Is that a bad thing? Should a Muppets movie always be made with children in mind? I'm not convinced. This is a series with a huge pedigree stretching back several decades, and one that has accrued a very adamant adult fanbase since its inception. To be honest, while I adored the 2011 film for its attempts at broadening public awareness of the series, and its willingness to appeal to every age demographic, I feel like ""Most Wanted"" is almost necessary. It feels like something of an add-on to the last film, in the sense that hardcore fans will see this as an expansion of the universe they know and love. And because those fans are mostly adults, it makes sense that humor would be a little more reference-heavy, a little more oblique. Whether or not Jim Henson would agree with the direction taken by the writers here, I don't know, but I do know as somebody who has been into the series my whole life, I appreciated every moment of it. And by that, I mean I was laughing hysterically 90-something percent of the time.

Whether or not this is something you'll enjoy very much depends on how much you love the Muppets. Do you enjoy them from time to time? Did you feel a tinge of anger inside when Lady Gaga (who makes an appearance here) seemingly butchered an army of Kermits for a dress? Are you just looking for some light entertainment for the kids? Your reaction to this movie, honestly, is reliant on how funny you find gags like Danny Trejo and Ray Liotta doing a number from ""A Chorus Line,"" or how much you appreciate seeing lesser-known Muppets getting to see the light of day, or both.

As for my opinion? I loved it. Perhaps it wasn't as well-made as the last, but it made me laugh more, and had more truly clever humor than most modern comedies. Not only that, but it just felt like it was made by a team of people who really, truly cared about these strange little puppets and the world they operate inside of. Ultimately, ""Muppets Most Wanted"" is a collection of bizarre gags, clever cameos and great service to the fans under the guise of a comedy-thriller. It's immensely satisfying and funny, and while it doesn't have the broad appeal that many films in this series do, broad appeal does not a good movie make. Which is why, in my book, this film is a winner despite not really being the most accessible film for kids Disney has put out as of late.

""Oh he sounds different but he has a cold.""  ""Oh I'm acting different because I have changed my mind about something.""

We have the required scene where they are mimicking each other's movements because the bad guy thinks he is looking in a mirror.  We also have the scene where they are both on screen and the characters say, ""But which one is the real one!?!""  To which I said, ""Oh come on!  We're not really doing this are we!?!""

(I think the rating is based on some subtle sexual references, but later, we couldn't recall what they were.) All that distinguishes Kermit from his nemesis Constantine, is a wart on the bad guy's upper lip. That, plus the Russian accent....

As you probably know, The Muppets can invite an astonishing number of name brand performers to one of these capers. In this one, if you recognize one familiar face, you'll see 30 more! I am in bewildered awe that so many performers (on both sides of The Pond) seem delighted to provide cameos for these fuzzy folks. I could easily name scores of actors I recognized without breaking a sweat. We have seen them in everything from ""Downton Abbey"" to ""Machete."" What fun!

Along with the familiar voices of our favorite characters, here are a few of the guest celebrities we enjoyed:
  * Ty Burrell (""Modern Family"") is Jean Pierre Napoleon, an Interpol agent who is determined to bring Constantine, The World's Most Dangerous Criminal to justice, so long as it's BEFORE his American counterpart!
  * Ricky Gervais (""The Invention of Lying"") is Domenic Badguy (pron. ""Bah ghee"" it's French), Constantine's evil sidekick (his ""Number Two."" Maybe THAT's the reason for the PG rating. ...smile...).
  * Tina Fey (""30 Rock"") Nadya makes ""Siberia"" rhyme with ""superior."" She enlists her prisoner Kermit to bring some class to her Siberian prisoners' annual musical. She LOVES Broadway!
  * Christoph Waltz (""Django Unchained"") as himself, dances with a Muppet. What kind of dance you may ask? Yup! A Waltz!
  * Salma Hayek (""Grown Ups"") as herself. She suspects that a proposed ""Indoor Running of the Bulls"" event in a crowded theater might present a bit of a problem.

I LOVED the world's smallest police car; the visits to Berlin, Moscow, Dublin, London and Siberia; the glimpses of famous American, Canadian, French, Spanish, Mexican and British actors; music from ""A Chorus Line"" done by a line-up of Siberian prisoners (you won't believe all the familiar faces in THAT bunch!); and Miss Piggy's dilemma. There were times I was the only one giggling, but then again, movies are my hobby.

6136772,4,B00H7E8KVI,"""The Muppets"" movie from 2011 reintroduced a fixture of many adult childhoods to a brand new generation of kids. Kermit the Frog and gang were out of the entertainment business and scattered too-and-fro. They were a forgotten group of misfits that possibly had something to do with the death of the backbone of the entire phenomenon, Jim Henson in 1990. Of course, thats a little too deep of a topic for an actual Muppet movie, but much of the Muppets comedy comes from reality and while they were never forgotten by their fans, now adults; they were just missed.

That was the entire story of the reintroduction movie of 2011 and it was a smash hit, so naturally there would be a sequel. It literally picked up right where the first movie left off; right in the middle of the street where everybody had been singing ""Mahna Mahna"". The crowd clears, the set clears and the Muppets realize that all of their loyal fans were paid actors and they needed to decide then and there, what the next movie, this movie was going to be about.

The song and dance begins and while much of the music wasn't quite as memorable as the first movies, ""Lifes a Happy Song"", ""Pictures in My Head"", ""Me Party"" or ""Man or Muppet"", the chaos that was Muppets backstage is more prevalent, just on a world stage. Although, watching a group of prisoners in a Siberian gulag, led by Ray Liotta and Danny Trejo, doing ballet and trying to put on a Muppetish performance was pretty hysterical.

Theres something magical about the Muppets and their chaotic adventures, because despite the fact that the movie attempted probably two hundred jokes and only five or six of them actually were funny enough to make me laugh, I can still say that I had a good time at the movies. The movie is always moving and really only challenged my interest once when Miss Piggy and Celine Dion went into some weird black and white love song with MTV effects and such. I have no idea where Celine Dion came from either.

Many of the various characters that didn't get much attention in the first movie got the same treatment in the second movie as well. In fact, theres a lot wrong with the movie and its scripting. Despite that, its a Muppet movie and nobody can say that all of the Muppet movies were great or even good, but they were all Muppets movies and theres something still pretty phenomenal about watching cloth characters come to life. Its a step back from ""The Muppets"" 2011 movie, but it is definitely faster paced and entertaining.",1396224000,7,2498,4.569196428571429
6136773,3,B00H7E8KVI,"I love the Muppets! I loved the revival of the 2011 The Muppets  new movie because it had all the heart and drive of what makes the Muppets so very special. Although this one does make fun of itself in a hysterical opening number called Theyve Ordered A Sequel , it still only gets at its real Muppet heart in the last 15 minutes of the film. I was truly hoping for more story and character.

Director James Bobin (The Muppets, Flight of the Concords) did a really good job with the first reboot in 2011 but fell short mainly because of the script written by James Bobin and Nicholas Stoller (Five year Engagement, Yes, Man) this time. Basically its the story of an evil and most dangerous frog named Constantine who figures out a plan to replace Kermit because  without his mole on his face  he happens looks just like Kermit but speak with a very thick accent. They made the film international, but not intriguing. They filled the screen with gags and bits, but not consistent with the story. And yes, there are great gags and amazing cameos throughout and the musical numbers are actually very good, its not until the end of the film that you really start caring about Kermit and the gang.

All the regular cast is back and their voice talents like; Steve Whitmire is Kermit the Frog / Foo Foo / Statler / Beaker / Lips / Rizzo the Rat / Link Hogthrob / The Newsman. Eric Jacobson is Miss Piggy / Fozzie Bear / Sam Eagle / Animal. Dave Goelz is The Great Gonzo / Dr. Bunsen Honeydew / Zoot / Beauregard / Waldorf. Bill Barretta is Pepe the King Prawn / Rowlf the Dog / Dr. Teeth / The Swedish Chef / Bobo the Bear / Big Mean Carl / Baby Boss / Carlo Flamingo / Leprechaun Security Guard. David Rudman is Scooter / Janice / Miss Poogy / Bobby Benson / Wayne.  And finally, Matt Vogel is Constantine / Floyd Pepper / Sweetums / Pops / Robin / Lew Zealand / Crazy Harry / 80's Robot / Camilla / Uncle Deadly.

Leading the bad guys is none other than the sharp wit of Rick Gervais (The Office, The Invention of Lying) playing Dominic Badguy. (Need I say more? Oh, but Ricky does sing a very catchy number and he dances too! Who knew?) Playing both the bad and good side is the Russian prison warden; Nadya played charmingly by always ever snappy and funny Tina Fey (30 Rock, Anchorman 2) herself!

Now Sam the Eagle has his French peer in crime solving named Jena Pierre Napoleon, played hysterically by Ty Burrell (Modern Family, Mr. Peabody and Sherman). The two spend part of the movie hysterically out sizing the size of their badges to each other.

The songs are good and catchy to sing along with and the cameos include Josh Groban, Lady Gaga, Christopher Waltz, Stanley Tucci, Miranda Richardson, Tony Bennett, Usher, James MacAvoy, Frank Langella, Sean Combs, Salma Hayek, Zach Galifianakis and Celine Dion.

Its definitely a family film, but unlike the first one, I don't believe it will hold the interest of the adults as much as the kids. Muppets Most Wanted fell a little too short for me because I wasn't as endeared to the characters like I was on the first one and the story a little predictable. Wait for the Blu-Ray on this one!
