I have to say, it's not a bad bootleg copy.  It has all the seasons, and it played though with no problems; however, as with all bootleg DVD's, just because mine played well, does not mean yours will.  Just be warned that this is bootleg.  The picture Quality was about the same as if you bought the other DVD's.  I know, because I bought the season box sets, thinking that they would be a higher quality of video than the bootleg.  Not really, the DVD Box sets, are old and the film shows it's date.  So pro's: The bootleg set has the same picture quality as the DVD box sets with only slight compression pixilation.  The sound is about the same, but the bootleg sounds a little more muffled than the DVD box sets.  So in the end know what you're getting.  THIS IS BOOTLEGGED!!  But it's not bad.",1228521600,3,959,4.226519337016574
