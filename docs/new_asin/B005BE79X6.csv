4643741,5,B005BE79X6,"You can't go wrong with this truly inspirational documentary.  The story of Terry Hitchcock is mindblowing.  Why on earth would a middle aged man with no athletic background chose to run a marathon per day for 75 days and put his body through ultimate torture, at one point breaking both ankles and having a heart attack?!?  Because he loved his children.  He wanted to raise awareness for single parent children, of which I am one, raised by my mom, and did so in dramatic fashion.  This is Forest Gump in real life.  An amazing story for anyone.",1328918400,5,547,4.587628865979381
4643742,1,B005BE79X6,"I agree with bowknuckles. Totally. I would like to add that the promotions and the actual movie have a disingenuous aire about them. Is the movie promoting public awareness of the struggles of single parenting? Never in any single promotion I saw was more than one notion emphasized . Other meanings emphasized in separate promotions: Struggles of the loss of a loved one to cancer. Struggles of an ""ordinary"" 56-year-old who ""ran 75 consecutive marathons in 75 consecutive days"". A struggle that tested one man's Christian faith. Actually, I perceived the movie as a promotion more for Terry Hitchcock than anything else with scant indications that ""the run"" was a spiritual tribute by a father and husband to his wife endured a slow and agonizing death fighting breast cancer. Actually it was Hitchcock's wife who endured the ultimate test with grace and dignity. I wouldn't be so cynical about the movie if I hadn't viewed it with a radiologist who stated quite unequivocally that Mr. Hitchcock could not have possibly run 2200 miles with prior and run-incurred bone fractures and a serious heart condition. I also found the movie rather boring. The footage of ""the run"" intercut with interviews of Hitchcock, his children, et al is a cliche device used, for example, on cable TV shows like The Weather Channel's ""The Force of Nature"", etc. My Run, although narrated by Billy Bob Thornton (wonder how that happened), came across to me as the director trying to drive a square peg into a round hole - an attempt by director Van DeSteeg to glorify and iconize Hitchcock with a B- movie by hyping Billy Bob Thornton's quite small involvement time-wise as narrator. My Run came across to me as an attempt to be s a ""Hoop Dreams"" calibre motivational film. Although My Run did the festival circuit and did well, it's theatrical stint did not. There is a reason this movie was virtually intended for the DVD audience.",1328832000,2,1914,4.856269113149847
4643743,5,B005BE79X6,This story is so incredibly powerful and very well captured in the film.  There are so many great messages in this film and you will seriously be inspired to live your life to the fullest! It is a must see...,1328745600,2,208,4.2
4643744,5,B005BE79X6,i seen the release in theathers and got dvd for christmas best gift ever! as a new runner almost 3 yrs now it is inspiring to watch my dream is too complete one marathon and Terry did 75 if he can do i know i can too! I am shooting for 2012 to do marathon don't know when yet! He is a fighter!,1328745600,,293,3.6666666666666665
4643745,5,B005BE79X6,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. But, I watched it, and was really surprised. I actually started running the day after watching it. Seriously, I was really moved by the story and seeing someone run 75 marathons in 75 days will get your butt up off the couch and you'll be happy doing it. Terry's story is very inspirational and I really look at him as a hero. I highly recommend this movie to all of my family and friends. I can't say enough good things about it.",1328745600,,476,4.241758241758242

4643747,3,B005BE79X6,"As a breast cancer survior, I needed to watch this movie. There are so many reasons to give up going through the process of being a cancer patient, so I wanted to see it from a different perspective.  The reason I gave it three stars is because instead of focusing so much on his running, I believe it would have improved the movie if they would have focused more on his emotional state at each juncture of his journey.  They don't really bring it home how difficult it is to take each moment and live in that moment, because that is all anyone has whether a cancer patient or not. He ran through the worst part of one town and made it through alive, yet cancer patients everywhere get thrusted into this positions because of the financial burdens associated with the disease.  Overall, I am making the point that the producer did not do a good job a tying the two issues together, yet they are the same emotional journey. All ""hero's"" have the same character traits.",1316822400,2,967,4.451977401129944
4643748,4,B005BE79X6,"""When Sue died I said to God, how come not me?  But I think I had a lot to learn, so that's why I'm still here.""  The inspiring documentary about Terry Hitchcock.  A 56 year old who ran to bring awareness to the country about single parent families by running from Minneapolis to Atlanta after losing his wife, having numerous heart problems (ncluding a heart attack a few months before the run), high blood pressure, two fractured ankles and a fractured knee cap. Did I mention that that's the equilivant of running 75 marathons in 75 straight days...the record before this was 3. Told with present day interviews and footage of the run this is one of the most inspiring, uplifting and outstanding documentarys I have ever seen.  If you watch this and you are not moved by the spirit of this man you have no soul.  Overall, an absolute must see.  I give it an A.

Would I watch again? - I know a few people I would show this to for them to see, I would watch again with them to talk about it.

4643749,5,B005BE79X6,"I saw My Run in the theater and enjoyed every last second. As a ""regular runner,"" this movie put running and life in perspective. One of the things I love about running is that learning to overcome the obstacles in the sport builds experience that can be applied to all sorts of other situations in life. Terry's journey showed that lesson over and over. I figured if Terry could do what he did without making any excuses along the way, then I had no excuse not to make my life exactly what I wanted. I would recommend this movie to anyone, runner or not.",1312588800,10,555,4.346153846153846
4643750,3,B005BE79X6,"This is a movie with great subject matter and no so great execution.  While I was deeply enthralled in the story, I wasn't as pleased with the way it was presented and it made it hard to approach and easy to get up and ignore.

Terry Hitchcock was your average guy.  He had a wife, three kids, and a successful job.  But then after his wife develops breast cancer and dies, he becomes a single parent without a job.  He does his best at raising them and at the age of 56 realizes that he needs to do something to help other single parents out there.  So he decides to run from MN to Atlanta for the Olympics.  And he's going to do it at a marathon distance each day.  All translated, that's 75 marathons in 75 days.

Terry is an admirable guy.  He's old, a little beaten up, yet still tries to push himself to his limits.  It makes me feel a little guilty for not running today because of severe sunburn.  I feel like a wimp.  But having a cause to run for usually helps and Terry had one that was near and dear to his heart.  His children we don't see as much of, except for the one that sticks with him through his whole run.  But the movie was mostly about Terry, and not the people around him.

I think that a movie about running has the potential to be interesting or boring depending on how it is presented.  This one was an interview documentary and it just didn't bring that excitement and sense of fulfillment that another style could have brought.  We see Terry running a bit, but the majority was of people talking about him and his struggles.  That has his place, but considering he was running for single parents, I expected to find out a little more about what he experienced as a single parent if they were going to do interviews.  But that was a very small part of the movie so I didn't feel as if I realized why he was running for that cause.

The actually film itself was split between the modern day interviews and the footage that was shot during Terry's run.  I found the older footage more interesting, even if it was of poor quality because of the time it was shot.  It actually showed what was going on though, rather than someone just talking about it.  With interviews, it was more like reading a book, which I would have rather done for that part of the story.  When it comes to a movie, I'd rather actually watch something happening.  There also were odd bursts of music, that while they were good songs, they were actually kind of scary because they were so unexpected.  Loud and just out there at random points, they made the movie a bit disjointed.  And Billy Bob Thorn narrating?  Since there was interviews going on I wasn't sure what they needed a narrator or why Terry just didn't narrate.

I think that what Terry did was fantastic.  It's definitely an admirable feat of human endurance.  I just wish that the movie would have showcased it a little better.

4643754,5,B005BE79X6,"Terry had a dream and he did the running but it was his son who ultimately made it happen.  None of us stand alone and Terry was blessed with a son who understood that and choose to stand with his father.  Definitely a special man in his own right.

This film was a reminder of the reason we all get up each day, that there are people out there who need us, today may not be our family, but there is someone.  We all need to open our hearts and just try a bit harder, we can make a difference, maybe not change the world today, but change one life.  That is all that we each need to do today to change the world tomorrow.",1357689600,2,621,3.936

4643756,5,B005BE79X6,"In this space I have written about the feats of well-known runners like Dean Karnazes, Michael Horton, and Marshall Ulrich.  These men are world-class ultramarathoners who have run big miles, setting them apart as ultra-elites.  Joining this small group is Terry Hitchcock, whose mega-marathon run is documented in My Run.  Unlike those other runners, Hitchcock could scarcely have been considered a runner before he decided he would run a marathon a day for 75 days.  But that's exactly what he did, running from Minnesota to Atlanta, arriving in time for the start of the 1996 Olympics.

Hitchcock's wife died of cancer in 1984, leaving him to raise 3 kids on his own.  Shortly after she died, he lost his job.  A decade later, he decided to draw some attention to the experiences and challenges of single parents, so he came up with his plan to run to Atlanta.  Although he had not run marathons before, he found a trainer to help him prepare.  He was slow (at one point he said he ran about 8 hours a day), but his endurance held up and he seemed to stay strong.

Besides the painful process of running that far, the other painful part of the film was the dissolution of his team.  He started out with a support team in an RV, but they fled, so he was left with only one of his sons to support him for much of the run.  They did get some free hotel stays, though.  The focus of My Run is more on the runner than the run himself, following his personal journey.  Runners who see the film will probably be asking, How did he do that?  Karnazes, Horton, and Ulrich are seasoned runners with impressive running resumes.  Hitchcock is just a guy.  Which is really the message of the film: regular guys can do the seemingly impossible, whether it's running 75 marathons or raising 3 kids on his own.",1344384000,4,1797,4.496913580246914
4643757,5,B005BE79X6,Good movie. Starts off a little slow but it picks up. Makes you feel like you can do anything when you dedicate yourself to it.,1341964800,3,127,4.12
4643758,5,B005BE79X6,"I first put the movie into my queue because I recently started running to train for my first 5K. On the day of the race, I fell down a flight of stairs (before the race began) and broke my ribs, and severely bruised my hip and thigh. I ran the 5K, not knowing the extent of my injuries. Afterwards, people thought that I was crazy for running in this condition, but now I can say, ""Not as crazy as Terry Hitchcock"". Wow--I could never do what he did. Awesome feat!

It wasn't until I began watching the film that a deeper connection arose. My dad had to finish my raising after my mother died of cancer.  So I liked every inch of the film, because I connected with it.  I connected with the kids point of view, connected with Terry's grief after he first lost his wife, and it helped me to see that what my dad went through during the grief process can be pretty normal. I mostly connected with his desire to keep his goal.

Would have loved to hear more of the family dynamics, but I understand that the film was focused on the run and raising awareness for the foundations.",1341792000,5,1075,4.254901960784314

Saying he represents the pained ""single parents"" he sets out with his children only to alienate at least one of them before its over.  Despite that he represents that he is running for the difficulty of single parents, there is not one reference to those difficulties but he sure did line up his share of press people to talk about him and his run.

I am an experienced runner who has retired due to chronic back pain and spent much of my race training practicing smart and safe methods for the taxing that running long distance places on the body. I was disappointed that Mr. Hitchcock's trainer didn't appear to practice safer and more effective tips for sustainability and recovery and that family and friends, except his son, Chris, bailed on him mid-stream. Additionally, Mr. Hitchcock was difficult to hear (poor audio) and understand while being interviewed in his chair. Where the so-called media person?
