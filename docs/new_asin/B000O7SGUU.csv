8184021,4,B000O7SGUU,"This is an ok film, not very exciting, not much action, but ok. It is 1909, Butch Cassidy and Sundance have been killed and Sundance's wife has become the most wanted woman, with one lawman being obsessed with a desire to capture her. For a year, she worked in a store with a husband and wife. The husband had previously been part of the Cassidy gang. The lawman comes and wants to find and arrest her, but she escapes. In retaliation and because he knew the husband was previously part of the gang, he arrests him.
Sundances wife is determined to get him out of jail. One way is to get the help of a Mexican revolutionist. He becomes infatuated with Sundances wife and agrees to help. She, in turn, agrees to help him use the techniques of the Cassidy gang in getting weapons that are being shipped to the head of Mexico.",1464134400,,822,4.379084967320262

8184024,4,B000O7SGUU,"A enjoyable western with Katherine Ross playing Etta Place again, the love interest of the Sundance Kid from ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"".  This TV movie has her fleeing from Charlie Siringo (Steve Forrest) who is determined to ruthlessly  hunt her down even though Butch and Sundance have already been killed in Bolivia.  When he arrests a friend and former gang member for aiding her, even though the man has been a model citizen for 9 years, she turns to Pancho Villa (Hector Elizondro) for help in freeing him in exchange for getting hims guns to aid him in his Mexican revolution.  Interesting story with a unrequited simmering romance between Etta and Pancho.  She can not get over the loss of Sundance and they have a interesting scene when she talks of him and very lightly in the background the music playing is ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head"".  Entertaining film.  You get the feel from the way it ended that they might have had a series in mind.",1417478400,,968,4.658823529411765
8184025,4,B000O7SGUU,"For a TV sequel to the popular 1969 film, ""Wanted: The Sundance Woman"" ain't bad. It came out 8 years later and Katherine Ross still looks great with her inimitable winsome spirit.

THE PLOT: Butch and Sundance are long gone (dead in Bolivia) and Etta Place (Ross) is hiding out as a store clerk in Arizona. A burly detective is on her case and determined to find her (Steve Forrest). When the husband of the couple she was staying with is jailed for harboring a fugitive (Michael Constantine) Etta goes to revolutionary Pancho Villa for help (Hector Elizondo).

I wasn't expecting much from this TV movie; it's too talky, but it won me over. This can be attributed to Ross' charm, a decent cast (also with Stella Stevens and Katherine Helmond), the Old Tucson locations, the team-up with Pancho Villa, quality train sequences and some solid writing with good subtext; for instance, the way Etta does good to her enemy and a character's realization that the criminal he made out to be a monster is not a monster at all.

The film runs 95 minutes.

GRADE B or 6.5/10

PS: There's another sequel to ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" called ""Blackthorn,"" released in 2011, starring Sam Shepherd as Butch Cassidy. The outlaw didn't die in that 1908 shootout in Bolivia and is living on a small ranch in the Bolivian wilderness in 1927 where he decides to go back to the USA to meet his son. It's a quality modern Western (see my review for details).",1400025600,,1448,4.618677042801556
