2566193,5,B000FI8MHK,Very nice movie. Never thought I would ever see Eric on a motorcycle again after CHIPS. I would recommend this movie.,1277769600,3,117,4.619047619047619
2566194,5,B000FI8MHK,"Sorry I am not able to review this film. I live in the Philippines and operate Hard Riders Bar & Grill. The movie was sent to my son and he has not forwarded it to me yet. When the bar is first opening in the afternoon I like to put on a biker movie instead of using the DJ. A lot of bikers love to come in just to watch the films. By the way I am an American and ride a Harley here I even have two. One in the bar
for display and I ride one to work. Am always looking for new Biker movies. Thanks I am sure it and the others will be fine!",1277510400,2,539,3.5762711864406778
2566195,3,B000FI8MHK,"In this movie, Erik Estrada plays a member of a motorcycle club who expiernces a member worst fear. He is accused of being a rat!",1270771200,,129,4.2
2566196,3,B000FI8MHK,"What can I say? It's just one of those 'bikerflicks' with a lot of shooting and violence. It's still amusing though, but not very believable, especcialy the fact that the main character stays alive when his whole trailer is filled with lead! But there are much worse movies.",1209254400,,274,4.729166666666667
2566197,1,B000FI8MHK,"If you watched CHiP's for years waiting for Ponch to pull his gun or drop the ""F"" bomb, then this may be your movie.  Filled with 80's, early 90's cheese; compleate with girl band montages and female wrestlers in tiny swim suits. About a biker who kills a dirty cop and then leaves to protect the gang, only to be framed by the dead cops partner who turns the gang against him. If you love B biker movies this will be right up your alley. If you are looking for a movie with sceans of vintage bikes this is not your movie as there are only scant shots of near modern day Evo's. Over all not a bad flick for your biker movie collection, with an ending only slightly better than ""Hells Angles on Wheels"".",1164499200,17,702,4.2

8122748,1,B000FI8MHK,"I was hoping since this was made in 94 it would be at least decent since it came out after biker flicks like Stone Cold and Beyond the Law,(both of which are WAY better than this)but it's NOT! it looks like it's from the late 80's not the early 90's. and, Estrada looks like he should be hanging with the Village People not a biker gang. basically old cable tv production values and bad acting with cheesy dialogue. even most of the old biker films from the 60's and 70's are better than this! DONT WASTE YOUR TIME.",1444435200,,515,4.26530612244898
