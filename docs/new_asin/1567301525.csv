7796767,5,1567301525,"I'm a professional historian, and I found this movie to be very true to the spirit of the eighteenth century. I loved the little inside jokes (for those of us who have studied the plays and the history of the times). My French roomate used this film in her introductory level French classes at Tulane. This is a must-see film for those who want to be introduced to pre-Revolutionary French culture. But, you have to be interested in the subject (seriously interested) in order to appreciate the film.",1127952000,9,500,4.693181818181818

7796769,5,1567301525,"This movie is an excellent view of 19e Paris. Luchini is excellent as usual, and I must agree with the second review, one can only wonder with the first reviewer why someone who probably thought Independance Day is a  fine film would even go see a real movie such as this.",962323200,7,272,4.333333333333333
