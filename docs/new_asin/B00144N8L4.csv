This makes it strengthening but not straining for pregnant women who notice looser joints and more sensitive muscles. I have seen and done other prenatal exercise regimens that I was unable to continue because my pelvis was too sore, or because I tired too easily (even when they had a ""time out"" to check your heart rate and make sure your breathing isn't too heavy). Even sedentary women can perform most, if not all, of the exercises demonstrated here. Certainly any mildly active woman can do them all.

My only hesitation with this DVD is that some of the breathing seems a bit fast-paced in a couple spots, and I am not certain this is desirable. Rapid breathing can decrease oxygen supply to the growing baby. These faster breathing segments are short--the whole workout is only 31 minutes--but it could result in lightheadedness. As Tammy Moore is joined by pregnant guests but was not pregnant herself during this filming, this could be one reason. For those women who want to exercise along with another pregnant instructor, something else might be a better choice.

Overall, this presentation is satisfying. The bonus CD makes it more portable, as some women prefer to use their iPods or to exercise without being confined to a screen. Screen-free exercise can help with better concentration.

Fit Beginnings Fit Mom Yoga (which is the same as Mind & Body Fitness For the First Six Months of Pregnancy) is a nice prenatal workout.",1325635200,,1580,4.822878228782288
