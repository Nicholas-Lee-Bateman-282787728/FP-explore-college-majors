8762110,3,B01G2A7AEU,"The Amazon product details are not correct because only ""Les Tontons Flingueurs"" has English subtitles. The other two films, ""Les Barbouzes"" and ""Ne Nous Fachons Pas"" do not have English titles. That said, all three films are beautifully restored and ""Les Tonton Flinguers"" is well-worth the cost alone. Also note that Olive Film has a version of ""Les Barbouzes"" that is subtitled in English and issued under the alternate title"" ""The Great Spy Chase."" I cannot find a subtitled version of ""Ne Nous Fachons Pas.""",1514419200,,512,5.035294117647059
