8711921,5,B00W3JQXG6,Great series!!! Lee Mack is amazing. I wish Tim Vine and Miranda Hart were in the series a little more.,1525132800,,103,4.2
8711922,5,B00W3JQXG6,I really like this show and the humor is fun and somewhat American style sitcom. Lee Mack is one funny man,1521504000,,106,4.095238095238095
8711923,5,B00W3JQXG6,"Extremely funny show, many of the episodes are truly laugh-out-loud funny. I especially enjoyed the show after Sally Bretton joined in season 2, as she seemed to be a better fit with the other characters. So glad I bought an all-region DVD player, so that I can enjoy comedies like this that are not sold in American format. Now I look forward to getting my hands on Not Going Out, season eight!",1516320000,,395,4.5

8711925,5,B00W3JQXG6,"Thick, fast-paced British accent makes for some difficulty in following. However, quick-wit --- intelligent humor ---  what's not to like! Rated 5 stars!",1484697600,,153,5.6521739130434785
