8173102,4,B000006HCY,"This is a nice, informative look at the career of Carl Perkins as well as his friendship with Paul McCartney. This video contains some really nice footage from 1993 of Carl and Paul jamming and talking together in Memphis. They tell stories and discuss Carl's music and the impact he had on the Beatles. The interaction between the two legends here is loose, friendly, and insightful.

Perkins tells how he wrote the sweet ballad ""My Old Friend"" about McCartney when they were spending a week together on a boat in 1981. This might be the prettiest ballad Carl ever wrote, and the two of them eventually went into the studio and recorded it for Perkins' last album ""Go Cat Go"" a few years later.

Carl also tells us the poignant story of how he lay in a hospital bed in 1956 recovering from the car accident that took away the momentum of his rising career while Elvis' popularity exploded around the world. It is touching and inspiring when Carl explains how he stopped dwelling on the opportunity he had lost and began to focus on the good things in life that he had left such as his family.

This is highly recommended to anyone who enjoyed the great concert video from 1985 ""Carl Perkins and Friends: A Rockabilly Session"".  Both of these videos show Carl Perkins as a fine musician and a sweet and sincere man.",1148860800,7,1315,4.559322033898305
