I willhappily say that I own all three movies, but I have to admit I HATEdubbed versions, they don't do the original films any justice, they don't sound right, they sound silly, and this is no different, the voices don't sound right, I would much prefer the subtitled version. The first movie, called 'Virtual Death' sees a special case to be solved by the first of three characters featured in the short series, named Sen Goku, a real cocker ex-convict turned cop with a bad hairdo and a bad attitude, its his mission to track down an expert hacker who's hacked into Oedo's (the name of the city) tallest skyscraper's computer network, which additionally, has access to Oedo's military network as well, which is bad. The second movie (and undoubtably the best of the three for action) focuses on the second character named Gol-gl or something (? ) and he's been chosen to fight a super powerful cyborg monster created by a corrupt division of the Chinese military. The third film is perhaps not so good plot wise as the previous two, it sees the third character a wierdo transvestite (he wears earrings and lipstick) cop searching for vampires or something, not the best of the three, but its still got good action. If you are after more substance (i.e.  a story) in your Manga (such as Akira, Macross Plus etc.) then stay away from these films, but if you are after a complete and utter action romp with tons of sci-fi, incredible animation, not to mention a really cool looking cyborg robot in the second movie, then this is for you, it does not compare well when put up to other Manga that boast a more developed plot, but it beats a lot with its action scenes, which are undoubtebly the best thing about the series, I like it.",955670400,,1785,4.5607476635514015

This is truly one of the most spectacular  anime's i have seen in a long time. The beautiful city skyline, the  futuristic vehicles, and the awesome original characters are just the  beginning. This movie is a hacker's dream and a anti-computerization  person's nightmare all rolled up into one. The year is 2808 A.D. Your a  prisoner doing hard time on a space orbital prison. Your in for life times  3, you get a choice, you can stay aboard this space prison and rot or you  can join the special cyber force of the police doing the high risk suicide  jobs not even the most seasoned cop would lay a finger on. Your job is to  track down and capture an A-class prisoner, violent, highly skilled  murders, asassins, and just about any skum you can imagine. For every  criminal you catch the state is prepard to knock a bit of time off your  sentence so one day you may be free again. There's just one catch..to make  sure you don't head for the border [excuse the pun] your fitted with a  special collar. If you try to escape, fail a mission, or don't check into  headquarters within 24 hours the collar will detonate!  Your mission,  fifty-thousand people are trapped within the tallest and most secure  building in the city. A computer genius has seized control of the building,  it's robotic matainence droids which are now killing machines, and now he's  linked up to the goverment's military computer!  He has access to the  city's weaponary arsenal which includes a 30 gigawatt laser cannon which  orbits the planet and he's targeting the building, and to make matters  worse you've only got 24 hours to complete this mission and check-in or  your head will literally explode!  The dubbed version is excellent!  The  voices are very good and the background music makes this anime even better.  Wild plot, awesome technology and killer effects!  I highly recommend it.",947635200,4,2125,4.586666666666667
