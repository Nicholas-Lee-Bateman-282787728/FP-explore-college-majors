8470995,3,B005G172RM,"Got this for ""A Christmas Story"" only. ""Jack Frost"" is just OK, and ""The Year Without a Santa Claus"" TV remake is probably one of the worst Christmas films I've ever seen, although Harvey Fierstein's ""Heat Miser"" is a view of the future seeing what our current president looks like and is surprisingly well staged. Had I really thought about it past the low price, I probably would have bought ""A Christmas Story"" as a single feature with all the extras so I didn't have to save it with two films I probably won't ever watch again or lend to friends, at least those whom I want to keep as friends.",1493164800,,597,4.387387387387387
