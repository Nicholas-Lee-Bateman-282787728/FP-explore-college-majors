5968933,5,B00F77MARM,"Yep. The Last Season/Volume of Futurama is in the Volume 8 set. Not many good episodes, but most of them range from Good-Awesome! Love the show, and the series finale is great. Any Fan should pick this up.

Disc 2 of the set is probably where you'll find the better episodes, the final 4 are all Great! And The Inhuman Torch is the best sci-fi episode that they've done in years. I'd recommend picking this up, because of these episodes alone. They got better with making eps in this season, the final 6 really show it. and you might even find it better than the last 3 volume sets.",1380585600,11,582,4.339449541284404

5968935,5,B00F77MARM,"NOTE to Futurama fans and potential buyers: This is the SECOND HALF of Season 7. If you're confused by the ""Volume 1-7"" series (which, fyi, are 2-disc sets of half-seasons; and, if you're looking for Seasons 5-7, here is what you'll need to know:

SEASON 5 = is officially the collection of 4 Futurama ""Movies"" ('Big Score', 'Beast', 'Bender's Game', 'Green Yonder')
SEASON 6 = Volume 5 (First 1/2 of the Season; 2 disc set) AND Volume 6 (Second 1/2 of the Season 2 disc set)
SEASON 7 = Volume 7 (First 1/2 of the Season; 2 disc set) AND Volume 8 (Second 1/2 of the Season 2 disc set)

Unfortunately, I can't personally speak to the Volumes 1-4 as I have the original Seasons 1-4 dvds.",1489622400,24,685,4.3858267716535435

5968949,5,B00F77MARM,"This was a half-season, basically the second half of Season 7, with only 13 episodes, starting with ""Forty Percent Leadbelly"", with a silly plot about Bender fulfilling his lifelong dream to become a blues singer. It has its funny moments, but blues references and Mississippi delta humour is not really what Futurama is about, although it's amusing to hear Bender sing (and at the end, to hear him rap again, after he and Silicon Red have sold out). ""2-D Blacktop"" is one of the better Futurama episodes, with its nutty Fast & Furious satire, but also the gorgeous fractal art. Nice visit to the second dimension, nice pimperoo! ""T: The Terrestrial"" is a silly parody of ET: The Extraterrestrial, which is serious fun indeed. ""Fry & Leela's Big Fling"" has the pair as a real couple trying to get some privacy... but there's a catch. Totally outrageous situations, and a bit more of Leela's past. Nice. ""The Inhuman Torch"" is also genius, with sun-mining for helium, ""Sunny with a chance of tragedy!"" The Planet Express become firefighters, and all sorts of inner politics happens, with Bender at the centre of it all. Great! ""Saturday Morning Fun Pit"" is a triple episode with animation satire, starting with a genius piece where the Planet Express crew re-appears as the Scooby Doo team, here called Bendee Boo and the Mystery Crew, with a guest voicing (again) from George Takei. Wait till you see what they do at the typical ""I wouldn't have gotten away with it, even without you kids"" unmasking scene, not for the faint-hearted!! There's a Princess Purpleberry segment that takes off on Strawberry Shortcake that's not so essential, but the GI Joe satire piece GI Zappis everything you wanted it to be and more, especially the code names - Hermes Conrad as ""Waterboard"", Phillip J Fry as ""Freezer Burn"", Leela as ""Nutcracker"", and Bender as ""Orphan Crippler"". ""Calculon 2.0"" is a pretty good Calculon episode, especially the part where he's resurrected. ""Assie Come Home"" is a so-so episode about Bender's shiny metal fanny perpendicular with a nice opening segment about the Blips and the Cruds (rather than the Bloods and the Crips). ""Leela And The Genestalk"" is a great episode on GM, while ""Game Of Tones"" is a truly strange episode about dreams (albeit with some very nice sentimental moments about Fry and his mom at the end). ""Murder on the Planet Express"" is fantastic, over the top dark comedy, with some great surprises (especially the scene of Bender with ears). ""Stench And Stenchibility"" is a strange episode where Zoidberg meets a lovely girl with no sense of smell and Bender gets into a tapdancing contest that nearly kills him. Strange. The final episode of the series (so far), ""Meanwhile"" is a great item that centers around Farnsworth's most recent useless invention to have interstellar consequences - a button that reverses time for 10 seconds. Brilliant. It brings up all sorts of really great scenarios that can't be discussed without giving too much away, suffice it to say that it's one of the series' best episodes, and a nice capper. Nice cameos also from the vampires of the Vampire State Building here too - they might have been great recurring characters if the series had been allowed to continue... too bad.

The series also has some nice bonus features - ""Precious trimmings - a compendium of deleted scenes"" funs for 16 minutes. One of the better skits features Calculon's acting setting switch that includes William Shatner, Peter O'Toole and a few others. Then there's ""Futurama University"" (23:00), a long-ish interview segment with a ton of different peiole who were involved with the show, that talked about character design, colour, and 3-D modelling. ""Inside Futurama: The Writers' Room Of Tomorrow"" is an interesting view of the trailer that the writing crew sat in to put the episodes together, with some dissection of the process and the tools, going 360 degrees around the room to examine all the corners, and to show the fan art that decorates the place, as well as an inspection of the 3-D printer that was used to build Bender's guitar in ""Forty Percent Leadbelly"". Nice!",1460851200,,4125,4.909742120343839

5968951,5,B00F77MARM,"Such a great TV series!  its too bad it ended,  but at least it made a great run! ill never get tired of the humor in this show thats for sure!  reason for the title is this is one of the few blu rays ive seen with some high quality video between 30 and 34mbps. CN could learn alot from who ever mastered these discs...  with cartoon network your lucky to get it on dvd and usually only the first season. Anyways  Most movie on blu ray are saved at 15 to 25mbps. and that usually never fills the disc capacity up.  personally i wish they would put the whole futurama series all on blu ray in one box set.  speaking of boxes the blu ray cardboard packaging sucks!  i ordered the whole series and all but one of them was crushed...  would have it killed them to put these in plastic cases over paper!?!",1458000000,,800,4.109677419354838

The packaging, like the other volumes, is a great design.  The artwork and color is a nice addition to the dvd shelf, the only problem is the cover art is so good it beckons a Full Display.  Which, lets face it, is an awesome problem to have.
The episodes are brilliant, the commentary is the full flung fun its always been full of nerdy facts, technical tidbits and insight into a lot of the writing and voice work.

For the fourth time, I own the entire dvd collection of Futurama.  A weird notion.  Speaking of, the Series Finale 'Meanwhile', as it currently stands, is among the better episodes and is certainly on par with the previous (at the time written) Series Finales; The Devils Hands Are Idle Playthings, Into the Wild Green Yonder and Overclockwise.

A bitter sweet addition to the collection to be sure but considering the talent everyone behind this show has, the potential for further stories and its past reluctance to stay dead I'm sure that in the not-so-distant future I will be again buying new volumes of Futurama",1391817600,6,1135,4.65

However this is the age of simplicity and no one wants to think to hard or has the attention span to think out side of the electronic box.

The final episode is the best ending that a show could have.  It gives a sense of finality while still having the option of continuing on.  I believe that when shows end in this manner it means that writers/creators/producers still like the show and they aren't just ""phoning it in"" or collecting a paycheck.  They respect their viewers and want to give them a good product.  Futurama has succeeding in doing just that.",1390953600,6,557,4.575757575757576
5969041,3,B00F77MARM,"While still better than almost anything else out there, its obvious that Futurama 2.0 was running out of juice.  I'm of the opinion that the newer seasons have all been inferior to the end of the original run, but only because Volume 3+4 are almost completely golden.  My favorite 2.0 episodes are The Late PJF, A Clockwork Origin (my fav 2.0), Overclockwise, Reincarnation (Anime and 8 Bit), so you get my tastes.
But on to Volume 8, when I first watched it on TV on a marathon, I was horribly disappointed, but upon subsequent viewings, I found much more to like.  My favorites are Fry and Leela's Big Fling, and the GI Zapp segment of ""Fun Pit"" ranks up there with the best of any 3 parter.  The rest is pretty disappointing (and awful by Futurama standards), I didn't laugh once the first time I saw 40%LB, and I was literally mad at Meanwhile.  It was basically the same finale as ""Stargate"", where in the end nothing really happened (plus everyone was stuck in purgatory or killed).
If you are a Futurama fanatic, you definitely have to get this, but if you like Futurama, and vol 7 disappointed you, skip vol 8.  Its my hope that they will get one or two more movies and wrap it up.",1390608000,3,1189,4.431192660550459

So more on topic, this is the final season of the show, showcasing some of the brilliance that made the show worth watching in its finals hours.  The final episode ended in a touching manner that I really respected and thought was a nice way to end the series... on a moment that was both happy and sad.

If you are new to the series, you can jump in with this volume and not be lost, but you would be missing out to not see other episodes, and the movies.  If you are a series vet, you know what to expect and this volume gives plenty of it.

Volume 8 - the last season of the show - was probably the weakest season over all.  the last episode, however, was a very satisfying ending to a great series.

Upscale the damn things and be done with it), and this is definitely a nice set. The picture is crisp, the sound is great, and the menus and animations are pretty snazzy.  Season 8's menu music and animations are particularly nice.

However, even though the main content is pretty awesome, there are some details that subtract a star for me.

The commentaries (which are really the reason I wanted these seasons on disc, when I could just watch it on Netflix) are a mess. On this set, you can choose to ""play all episodes,"" watch each episode separately, or play episode with commentary, but not ""watch all episodes WITH commentary."" You can either watch each episode with commentary, and keep having to wait until the end of the episode, and the return to the main menu, to continue on, or use the Extras menu to directly select each commentary.  Even Season 5's idiotic mess of options allowed me to set all the commentaries on (granted, one at a time), and then ""play all episodes.""

And the box itself, while having pretty snazzy artwork, has some piss-poor disc slots. Nevermind the fact you'll likely scratch the discs after a while having to slide them in and out, but the slots themselves are so loose the discs fell out when I turned the folded insert upside down. There's no grip at all to them. Granted, it means you won't scratch because of force, but seriously, allowing them to just fall out isn't any better. And the box overall is quite flimsy.

I've watched every episode of Futurama over the years(including the ones within Volume 8, which are brilliant in every sense of the word) and have never found any reason not to like the show.
I guess Mr. Groening doesn't have the courage or the will to continue with the show. Maybe the effects of the first cancellation of the show back in 2003 are still haunting him, although I've come to understand that it was because of some stupid political statements that Groening made that drew the wrath of the owner of the FOX network, Rupert Murdock, and got Futurama cancelled in the first place. Then in 2010, Futurama was resurrected and picked up by Comedy Central and like every other fan of the show, I let out a big sigh of relief. Now, it's been cancelled again and I can only imagine it was because of some other stupid political statement or screw-up that Mr. Groening made. I, for one, will NEVER forgive Matt Groening for letting Futurama get cancelled permanently
