6637593,5,B00NB9ILGM,"This might not be a film for everyone. If you're looking for something cinematographically perfect, then it's not your film. This movie is a story that is well told, using home videos of the person telling the story. It is not a happy story and I think many people who have gone through something similar in their lives will be able to relate to the pain and the triumph of getting out of that pain, transforming into something positive in their lives. I absolutely love this film.",1426896000,3,481,4.540229885057471
6637594,2,B00NB9ILGM,"Petra, the much younger sister of Elena glues together home video's and photos to tell the story of her sisters' demise in New York.  It is slow going and with, to me,  pseudo artsy shots.  It is a serious and heavy piece (which doesn't have to preclude any laughter perse), but there is very little lightness in the movie, the story or the actual images.  Most of the actual videos are hand held and not particularly great, think your uncles documentation of your birthday.  What exactly happens to Elena doesn't get told either, there must be more to it than shown.  Musically it kind of drags along as well, and last but not least I don't really know what the filmmaker wants me to experience and take away from this movie.  I like low budget films, but this one really is stretching it.  . If she just wants to share her loss than I'd suggest go to a therapy group if that helps.  So no, didn't do it for me.",1424131200,2,912,4.317647058823529
6637595,5,B00NB9ILGM,This film is stunningly beautiful. It will remain in my thoughts for a long time and so it should. If a film can be poetry then this one is.,1423353600,,140,3.8620689655172415
6637596,5,B00NB9ILGM,"I saw this film when it premiered in The Rooftop Films Underground Movies Outdoor in Brooklyn, and I loved it.

I have been waiting for this release, I bought two copies; A film this beautiful deserves to be shared.

It deserves much praise for there is an Elena inside all of us.",1411344000,2,280,4.365384615384615

8677148,5,B00NB9ILGM,"A melancholy and artful meditation on the invisible and unarticulated depths of sisterly emotion. Ms Costa plays nimbly with evocative atmospherics, reminiscence, and narrative reconstruction, creating a layered, dreamlike sense throughout. The story dances itself out wistfully while the expected declarations of love, aspiration, and resentment, are hinted at but never obliquely surfaced.  There are some truly sublime shots, often accidental, their depths achieved through the nostalgia so often created by family videos, which make up much of the footage.  Thorough but not laborious, creative but rarely indulgent, to view it is to dream after a night of vivid storytelling.  The result is a triumph: effervescent, limpid, haunting, exquisite.",1448150400,2,749,5.853211009174312
8677149,1,B00NB9ILGM,"Utterly terrible documentary made by what must be one of the most narcissistic, self-centered people in the business. The movie makes such an obvious attempt to be profound and artistic, but completely fails on every front.  It is about a Brazilian girl, Petra, whose sister Elena commits suicide when Petra is just 8 years old. The whole film is made up of a bunch of home videos of Petra's wealthy family as she was growing up. This is it. It does not go any deeper into the subject of suicide, the social context that surrounded their lives, or anything beyond the personal feelings of family members. It ends with Petra dancing and spinning circles in front of the camera over and over again for 10 minutes while the film tries to be artistic. Absolutely no artistic value or interesting content whatsoever.",1440288000,2,811,4.75177304964539
8677150,3,B00NB9ILGM,"This documentary is almost like a fictional dream.  It is a good doc.  I subtracted a couple of stars simply because it goes on just a tad, and dips slightly into annoying trying to hard to be an artistic piece, but it is a solid film by a brave family.",1432857600,,253,4.04
8677151,5,B00NB9ILGM,"One of the best films I have seen in a long time.  It is a very honest study of the human condition - how humans love, suffer, grieve, hurt and survive.",1431043200,,152,3.903225806451613
8677152,2,B00NB9ILGM,"This is a movie done completely in the narrative, like a documentary, albeit a fictional story. I did not feel compelled to finish it at the time but I hope there was an unpredictable twist or something that would have pulled me to the end.",1430265600,,240,4.355555555555555

8677155,5,B00NB9ILGM,"Tragic and spectacular... The film-making and narrative quality are masterful. The Director/writer captures the poetic, romantic nature of the Brazilian heart which is a mystical, other worldly journey through many complex realizations.",1429056000,3,236,6.40625
