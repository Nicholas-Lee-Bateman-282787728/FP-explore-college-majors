4309810,5,B004AJDEBE,"This is the most amazing anime I have ever seen! It has just about everything from, dark, depressing moments to 12 year old boys in dresses to laugh out loud comedy  and (let's not forget) the questionable yaoi. I would say mostly for fans of Vampire Knight, Blood+, and Will O Wisp. It has such an interesting story line and the cast looks amazing. I can't wait to see the 'corset scene' in english ;D That's a classic scene!",1290556800,15,426,4.3924050632911396
4309811,3,B004AJDEBE,"Only good if you haven't read the manga. While the characters stay true to themselves in this first season: the storyline is way, way off. A good 60% of it is 'filler' that never happens in the original storyline, which given the amount of manga produced at that time is understandable.. but also laughably pathetic at the same time: especially as it diverges very early on. The ending of this season in particular is a huge downer .. especially if you wanted to see Joker and the circus crew at any point. They don't even appear, and the story goes so far into left feild it's rediculous. The art and animation were good, and as stated above teh characters do stay true to themselves, giving anyone who had read it and just wants to see it animated a nice treat.

If you've never read the manga, it's a great buy full of action and a lot of drama: as well as a lot of laughs.. though in some cases you had better have a perverted sense of humor (lol). Otherwise I would suggest trying to find a copy to rent if you 'must see' .. because for BB fans, it's very disappointing.",1290470400,12,1075,4.321782178217822
4309812,5,B004AJDEBE,"Kuroshitsuji has hit America!  First time I saw this or heard of it was when I was radomally looking on mangafox to discover more manga.  And I stumbled upon this.  Now, usually what makes me want to really read something is by the art work or the title to it.  And seeing as how I like things dark and depressing, I chose to give this a little shot.  Maaan, I LOVE THIS!!!  You guys would probably drop dead with laughter if you ever stumble upon the scene where Sebastian puts Ciel in a corset.  That was classic!  But I'm not going to spoil it 'cause that would be evil, but I can't get off into it that much because I'm only on vol. 5 and I've had some sneak peaks with the episodes on youtube, but by far what I've seen, Square Enix is once again at it.  If any of you have heard Vampire Knight and or Will O' Wisp (All time favs), then you'll TOTALLY love this one.  If not, there is something incrediably wrong with you guys.  But be forwarned, the anime and manga don't exactly have the same story line as I found that out the hard way.  The circus one is only in the manga cause I didn't see it when I was watching some of the anime.  But get this, you'll love the dark humor, sad moments, and...I'm not too sure about the questionable yaoi...but I love it!  Let's paint the town red for the best shinigamii; Greil!

4309813,5,B004AJDEBE,"I started reading Black Butler in the pages of Yen Plus. When I found out that it had been animated, I tracked down and purchased an import set. The art on this series is excellent. The subtitling on the version I have is well translated, but I understand that Funimation has redone it. Some of the episodes are from the manga, others are original. I am looking forward to hearing it in english. The voice cast that Funimation has for this is an excellent one.
  This is definitely worth the purchase!",1290297600,4,501,4.4945054945054945

4309816,5,B004AJDEBE,"I was really impressed with the high quality of animation put into this. When I ordered it, I wasn't sure what to expect. It's definitely worth the money! A good demon story for just about anyone interested. :) The level of ""Mature"" content is pretty low. I'd say it's about 30% fighting though. Wouldn't show it to little kids due to the use of guns and other tools as weapons, but no perversion. :) Mostly follows the original storyline. YAY! ^-^ There seem to be a few added parts, but I find that helpful since it deepens the plot explanation. It has a very cool and unique style to the storytelling that I thoroughly enjoy!",1332892800,,628,4.469565217391304
4309817,5,B004AJDEBE,"I don't generally get very involved in anime. I'm a ""social watcher"". My friends watch it, so I do too. But Black Butler hooked me. It's immensely enjoyable and never dull. It's a mix of comedy, tragedy, bloody revenge and naughty jokes that keeps you off balance. I squealed like a fangirl once per episode, and I am not a squealer.

That being said, I haven't read the manga, so I don't know how it measures up. I've also seen a lot of complaints about the accents. They sounded fine to me, but I'm not British, so maybe I just can't tell.",1330473600,,541,4.303921568627451
4309818,5,B004AJDEBE,I love Black Butler. It's a good historic fiction anime. I love the Limited Edition of the 2 DVD set. It's really beautiful! The anime has a good dark side.,1328054400,,156,4.233333333333333
4309819,5,B004AJDEBE,"I love the Black Butler anime, and am currently working my way through the manga series.  Here are my thoughts SOLELY BASED on the Japanese vs. the English versions.

PROS
-Sebastian's voice! '
I know a lot of people don't care for it, but I thought it suited him PERFECTLY!  Just spot-on for the super evil, super sexy butler that he is.

-Grell, Madame Red, Lau, Prince Soma and Agni, Mey-Rin, Bardroy, and (I GUESS) Lady Elizabeth's voices all suit them very well, and the acting is lovely.  I could gush for days about all the good qualities they carry, but I shall restrain myself.

-London Bridge.
I know this sounds kind of weird, but hearing the Japanese voice actors singing London Bridge was just. . . odd.  And I was too busy focusing on how weird it was to take in whatever emotion I was supposed to be feeling at the time.

-More realistic
The anime does take place in England, after all.  Some finicky accent connoisseurs may complain that they sound ""fake"", but I couldn't tell the difference, and it's a HELL <(See what I did there?  Demon butler?  Eh?  EH?) of a lot better than having them all speaking Japanese.  I was pleasantly surprised by the Prince's and Agni's voices, the actors did a good job.

*

CONS
-Ciel's voice.
He sounds like a woman!  Yes, I realize that women are the only ones who can do boy's voices for stuff like this, but COME ON.  The whole time I listen to him, all I can think is, ""This doesn't sound like a 12-year-old boy at all.  This totally sounds like a woman.""

- The Undertaker's voice.
In the Japanese sub, Undertaker had this low, raspy, awesomely creepy voice that helped define the character.  Now, he sounds like a pirate.  MAJOR disappointment, as he was one of my favorite characters.

- The dialogue
The translation is noticeably different than the subtitles in some sections.  Most notably (for me) when Sebastian calls Ciel ""Young Lord"" instead of just ""Lord"".  I dunno why, but it seemed to take away from the whole phrase. I'm getting nit-picky, I know.

*

Overall, I would recommend buying the English dub over the Japanese one- each has its own faults, but you feel the overall effect much better when you see it in your own language.",1327276800,,2201,4.536895674300254
4309820,5,B004AJDEBE,"Just looking around on the internet I happened to run across this anime. I watched acouple of shows online and I was hooked! Im SO glad I ran across this. The evil and fighting is great but it also has comedy and some sad stuff to make you cry. It had all the simple things I look for in an anime. This is one show you should check out, if not just because it's awsome then mabey because the butler Sabastian is ""just one HELL of a butler"" *giggle* :)",1326412800,,451,4.022222222222222
4309821,4,B004AJDEBE,"People were really pained about Sebastian's voice, which is the main thing I wanted to touch on. It's not the same as the Japanese voice, but in a way, it's better. Although it might take time to get used to, especially if you've heard the Japanese version, Sebastian was done a lot of justice with the chosen voice. Ditto for Ciel.

The manga and anime are very different. They leave each other out, so don't come in here expecting every character to join the party. The ones that do, though, are very entertaining. All in all the DVD is worth checking out- the scenery is beautiful, the story is good... I even rewatch it from time to time!",1325289600,,642,4.440677966101695
4309822,5,B004AJDEBE,"This is one of the few series that I have watched multiple times. Mind you I have never read the manga so my opinion may be a bit biased but I thought it was fantastic. One of my favourite things about this series was the art. I thought it was very detailed and everything was beautiful. I didn't really care historical accuracy as the series itself is a fantasy series but that's, again, my opinion. I have, and will again, recommend this series to people who aren't picky about the little details.",1324080000,,499,4.434782608695652
4309823,5,B004AJDEBE,"This anime is awesome in pretty much evreyway possible.
The story is about a 12 year old named Ciel Phantomhive and he makes a contract with a Demon butler named Sebastion. The contract is that Sebastion will stay with Ciel and do evreything he says until Ciel's ""final task"" has been complete.
That's pretty much all i can say without giving the story away.

Ciel and Sebastion are very good charecters and the supporting cast is also very good and funny.

The artwork is AMAZING i could go on for days about the artwork but it is very good and it fits the gothic theme very well.

The music in this show is good. I would say it would be amazing but the 1st ending was very weird (Wasn't bad just didn't fit the show)

I loved the opening. The music had this gothic fell to it and the way the opening video was done was amazing!
As i said the 1st ending wasn't bad it was just not fit for the show. It was called I'm alive by Becca. It was just very Pop and didn't fit with the show. Let alone it was done in English.
The 2nd ending was way better and brings back the gothic theme the show and the 1st opening did.

I would recomend the Japanese version, because the english version well some of the voices are okay but others are just annoying. It is also British voices which takes some getting use to.",1323648000,,1305,4.204
4309824,4,B004AJDEBE,"This is a great show whose writing and animation is first rate excellant.  Johnny Depp has done roles like this and I think this would be his cup of tea if he were to take the role as the Butler.  As great as the series is, if Depp were to play the Butler I bet he will be great.  If anyone disagrees, I would not mind.",1323561600,,319,3.803030303030303

4309826,5,B004AJDEBE,"Ever since I saw this anime, I've long been wanting to purchase it. However, since the US broke it down into halves, and priced it at like $60 each, I was hesitant.  I was actually going to purchase it in all japanese (daisuke ono is like my favorite v/a) with english subtitles online, because that was only $34, but I decided to check amazon one last time, and since it's cyber monday week, they were selling each half for like $19!!! What a steal! So, i bought this instead, for both languages!! It arrived promptly in two days, in perfect condition! Thank you amazon! this anime is amazing, and your price was amazing! so, five stars for service and as product rating!!!",1322697600,,674,4.524590163934426
4309827,5,B004AJDEBE,"Well written plot, well written characters, nothing is obvious, nothing is overtly cliche, the obligatory fanservice is mild, comedy, action, humor, suspense, mystery, drama, revenge, betrayal, violence, death.

First you should know that despite being a shounen series, this has an all-girl fandom. Most watching this series bail after Grell shows up. This series is VERY heavy on BL (light yaoi) suggestiveness, but never becomes blunt, like a platonic romance between a demon & jailbait. All of them important men are beautiful & all of the important women are crazy.

It has small elements or characters that remind me fondly of other animes; Gensoumaden Saiyuki, Kyou Kara Maou, Kino no Tabi, Weiss Kreuz, The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy, Detective Konan, Arslaan Senki,& more than anything; Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro.

I can't really tell you ANYTHING about the villains or the protagonists without giving away massive spoilers. All I can say is that demons are good & loyal & angels are evil liers.

Season 2 has only half as many episodes but it heavily amplifies the homoerotic fanservice full steam, but also rewards any men who have stuck with the series with large amounts of gigantic breasts. The season starts with a different boy & demon in a similar bond & situation, but the bond is broken when the other demon butler, like his young Gilbert Cocteau-like master, starts lusting over Ciel.",1319155200,,1411,5.042918454935623
4309828,5,B004AJDEBE,"I LOVE THIS SERIES.
I love the characters in this series (especially you Sebas-chan)and the development of said characters, and the plot and pace of the show.
I won't say much because discovering this series for yourself is probably the best thing, being told too much about it would simply ruin the fun.
This is definitely something every fangirl - and I mean EVERY fangirl (especially those who already know about our precious Sebas-chan) - needs in her collection.
Now I haven't read the manga but I plan on doing so soon as I have heard that it is even better.
I certainly plan on adding this masterpiece to my collection! Cheers!",1318032000,,634,4.669642857142857
4309829,3,B004AJDEBE,"I waffled between giving this 3 stars & giving it 4, but I finally settled at 3. Why? Because despite the strong animation & decent voice acting, this just wasn't as strong as it could have been.

First off I want to praise Funimation for their dubbing. The original voice acting might be superior but this was quite well done & shows exactly how far dubbing has come in the last 10-15 years. There's a few weak spots here & there but it's good enough that you won't regret watching the dubbed versions at those times when you're just not in the mood for subtitles. The artwork is also very well done in this series. There are nice colors & I love letting my eyes slide over the character designs.

Where the series trips over itself is in the filler episodes. They're OK enough but they're just rather weak sauce in comparison to the other episodes. I normally don't take off points for filler episodes but they just dilute the set as a whole. When the series is on point it's awesome, but when it drags it really drags.

Despite this I would still recommend getting this box set or watching it online. It's one of the better anime series out there & it only improves from here.

4309830,5,B004AJDEBE,"I heard about this anime through a anime fan firend, I was double thinking about buying this anime at first, but checked it out on youtube, I was hooked! I loved the anime, had to have it now. I love the actors in this anime, loved the action and drama behind the each characters. I got both season one part one and two, couldn't get enough of it. Can't wait for season two, hopefully it's out soon^^",1311552000,,400,4.207792207792208
4309831,3,B004AJDEBE,"It is obvious from the DVD collection that 8 manga do not a season make. Part One of the collection covers most of the first two books in the series, but goes off on curious tangents in an effort to pad the series, no doubt to bring it up to the requisite number of episodes to fill out a season. Considering how difficult it was to obtain this first part of the collection, I was hoping for something a bit more intriguing. In the manga Sebastian possesses a charming ominousness and at times appears not unlike his beloved felines with their way of tormenting their prey before killing them. Where is the seducing slyness that always seems to shock his master by reminding him that the handsome form hides a creature waiting patiently to devour his soul? Other reviewers have complained that Sebastian does not look like his manga counterpart and that the accents of both main characters are not quite what they imagined. Personally, I didn't mind either Sebastian or Ceil's voices, though they seem more ""mid-Atlantic"" than English. The anime does lack the exaggerated pretty of the manga, but it is not distracting. What is distracting is the trio of idiot servants whose voice actors are irritating in the extreme. To give some credit, perhaps they are going for humour in creating such painfully sounding people. The alternative is to consider that none of the voice actors can do a credible English accent (two are a sort of bad Cockney and the third a complete mystery). The anime writers also seem to feel the need to add more macabre elements than appeared in the actual storyline. I have mixed views of going off on tangents with regard to translating manga to anime. In the case of FullMetal Alchemist it resulted in a completely different story. Here it sort of wanders off, comes back, then wanders off again. It is not a bad series, but it could have been better. The source material is much better to look at than read, however, if the anime creators wanted to embroider on the original, they could have come up with storylines that were much better. With three more books left to release in the manga I have not read it all. I fervently hope there is no fire breathing dog demon who runs around naked in his human form nor any maniacal hermaphrodite angels. That would be so disappointing...",1311552000,,2308,4.659313725490196
4309832,5,B004AJDEBE,"I got this anime without knowing what to expect, and was very pleasantly surprised!  Great animation style, awesome English voice actors, stunning bishies, and most of all a gripping storyline that draws you in after the first episode. Highly recommended!",1308009600,,255,5.375
4309833,5,B004AJDEBE,"I watched the series online before I purchased this box set, so I am used to listening to the voices in Japanese. I find it harder to take this anime seriously while watching it in English. Some of the English voices are well done British accents, while others are horribly forced, and off-putting. Ciel's voice, in my opinion, is the worst; there's very little emotion and his voice actor did a poor job of disguising her feminine undertones. Sebastian's English voice is well done, but to me, it just doesn't match his character. In the Japanese, Sebastian's voice is much deeper and smoother and sexier. Undertaker's voice is a stereotypical, ""crazy old man"" voice, whereas in the Japanese it's kind of airy and soft-spoken and in my opinion, reeks of a maniacal psychopath as opposed to the high-pitched screeching of the English version. Grell's voice is good in both versions, that I cannot complain about. This might not matter to someone who has never watched this anime at all, but to someone who has watched the entire series in Japanese before watching it in English, this is kind of a turn-off. In short, watch this anime in Japanese before you watch it in English. You'll be glad you did.

In regards to the overall show: the story is very entertaining, especially if you like the whole angels vs. demons scenario. I kind of stumbled upon this series on Hulu several months before buying this and I fell in love after only a few episodes. It was mainly the artwork, character designs and the victorian clothing that attracted me at first, but once I got into it more, the story was infectious, albeit the numerous fillers. The characters are well characterized and designed, and have very distinct personalities. There is some violence, but not as much as some other anime that just dish it out indiscriminately. There are also some sexual themes/situations, especially when you add Grell to the story, but otherwise, there isn't a whole lot of nudity or anything perverted: just some suggestive, awkward and slightly uncomfortable (but in a good way) situations. I wouldn't suggest that younger children watch this, but then again, it's rated TV-MA for a reason I suppose.

The artwork on the packaging is nice too, and looks very nice in any DVD/Anime collection. This is the 2nd anime series I've bought for my shelf, and I'm glad I did. It is a ""story that will stay with you for a long time"" (according to the OVA not included in this box set)",1305158400,,2461,4.747663551401869
4309834,5,B004AJDEBE,"Absolutely AMAZING series! I bought part two as well and when watched all the way to the end, it leaves you with an awed and amazed feeling. The accents in it bring the more British authenticity to it, although some voices I believe to be better in the Japanese version; however I prefer having the accents, makes it more realistic.
As the series go on you just swoon more and more over Sebastian and his sexyness!!
The plot, at times seems to go off track and into a random episode that really has nothing to do with the plot but although there maybe an episode or two like that the entire thing falls together at the end and makes for a fantastic show.
I greatly reccommend this show to anyone who loves anime, guaranteed you'll love it.
Not to mention the box is absolutely beautiful (I have the limited edition box however). I just love love love it! :D I recommend it 100%!!!",1304812800,,880,4.404907975460123

  the accents weren't too bad-sebastian was devine as was griel.as for ciel-well-it's very hard to do an angsnt preteen boy(the japanese actress who does ristuka in loveless is an exception)this one could have been much worst.

4309840,3,B004AJDEBE,"Animation is average...plot is thin. Many episodes could be viewed as filler episodes. Although many episodes do relate to another I just could not get in to this. It may have been better at 13 episodes because there are several episodes that are very good and you are engrossed in what is going on.

 However the ""Great Curry Cookoff"" episode was rather dull. Oh no...they under the possesion of the evil curry...<--yawn. I will not go into detail about the entire series but it is somewhat of a detective based story set around the mid 1800's or so and it is not completely continous. Ciel (the young master in this story) made a deal that will eventually cost him his soul....enter the butler and the over used phrase ""I am simply one hell of a butler"".

 It appears that they could not decide on should it be a serious or light comedy so it bounces back and forth and does not blend extremely well together. It had tons of potential but fell short. All english dubs are done with English accents and some are horrible. If you can pick up the whole series for around 20 bucks then it may be a decent purchase.

All but 2 of the English voice actors don't fit their parts, most noticably the girl chosen to voice for Ciel Phantomhivem, one of the main characters.  Also, an extreamly poor job was done in the chosen diolog as it compares to the subtitled diolog which greatly affects the percieved relationship of the main characters.  If a viewer had not seen the subtitled version first they might think that Sebastian actually cares about his Master Ciel.
  I bought Black Butler because I love the intense story and the memorable characters.  Just being able to easly watch it whenever I wanted is good enough for me.  I want more episodes and more special featchers.  I want more Kuroshitsuji.  If and when the Kuroshitsuji Musical 1 & 2 with English Subtitles become available for purchas I'll want them too.

Even the disk art itself is gorgeous. Every inch of these are covered in artwork. I even found some hidden treasure. The box had a label with DVD information on it and it wasn't until it peeled up some that I realized there was more underneath. I was able to easily pull it off to a beautiful picture of Grell and Madam Red! It's obvious an awful lot of care and planning was put into this DVD. This show has a lot of fans to begin with and I think they realized that. Honestly? Overall, I think they did a fantastic job with dubbing. Don't get me wrong. Nothing beats the original, but that's how it is with most everything.
I have to say, a lot more things make sense now that it's translated professionally because, purist as you may be, subbers make translation mistakes. They did a great job of staying true to the original script while making it sound believable and natural in English. I usually do prefer subs, but I appreciate good dubs because A) my mom's dyslexia makes it really hard to keep up with subtitles and B) I can't fully appreciate the artwork and what's going on because I have to read subtitles.
Now to the individual actors. Right off the bat, I have to say Madam Red and Grell's actors were fantastic. In my opinion? Right on the mark. I think they did Madam Red and her subtext very well and Grell makes me laugh just as much! The servants are hilarious, especially Bard.
On to our main dynamic duo, if you will. They are, of course, where I'm going to be most critical.
Ciel was... good. Most people criticize that Brina Palencia sounds too feminine, but I honestly think she sounded fine in that respect. No more so than Maaya Sakamoto does. I will say that in the first few episodes, her performance sounds a good bit forced. I did notice that she sounds better and better the more episodes I watch.
As for Sebastian. There were a few people I had in mind for his voice and I never thought of J. Michael Tatum. I have to say, I was a huge fan of his to begin with. From Kyouya to Komui, he always ended up voicing my favorite character of every series. However, I just couldn't picture his voice on Sebastian. Though, after listening to the commentary, I really don't think I'd want the role to go to anyone else. He is such a fan of Sebastian and Black Butler. He's done so much research and taken so much time to get Sebastian just right that I'm really glad he's voicing him. He sounds... Nothing like Daisuke Ono's deep velvet voice, but he's made his own Sebastian, and I find I'm falling in love with it.
I really suggest listening to the commentary. It answers a lot of questions and concerns fans had. Like with Bard and Lau's accents. More about Brina and her performance. It made me feel better about everything.

All in all, I'm really pleased and I really suggest buying it. Especially if you want to support the series.",1297814400,2,3003,4.42057761732852

It doesn't follow along the books so much, but it definitely keeps you interested and has a great different story line.

4309847,3,B004AJDEBE,"I love the Black Butler manga, and I was quite excited to see the anime. In short: it left me disappointed. I know, I know... the manga's the manga, and the anime is the anime, but still. It could have been much better.

My overall impression was that the manga is a little darker, a little more twisted... there are some scenes that are (in my mind) completely ruined in the anime by adding unnecessary comedy to them. Now, I do like the mischievous side of Black Butler, too, but farce in the wrong place really ruins the taste.

There's a depth in the characters in the manga that I don't think the anime quite reaches - Ciel is brooding and cynical, sure, but as his story slowly unfolds, the manga hints of an even deeper trauma (and certain kind of madness?) than what comes across in the anime. Sebastian, too, feels at times more scary, and... even Finnian managed to creep me out once in the manga - which he decidedly does not do in the anime.

Still, there are a few excellent episodes too, which make this first part... well, if not quite worth 50 dollars, almost. The series begins quite strongly. (The second part I most definitely won't be buying. I've seen it all, and I couldn't have been more disappointed with it. Three, or maybe three and a half stars for this first part, one star for the rest.)",1295395200,2,1316,4.407407407407407
4309848,5,B004AJDEBE,"I had recently bought this anime, and it had come in the mail yesterday. I opened it with a Grelle Sutcliffe smile and watched with absolute joy. I loved it, but some of the English voice actors were not a good cast. Here's my rating of the characters:

Sebastian - Excellent. J. Michael Tatum portrayed this hell of a butler spectacularly. The British accent flowed spectacularly, and he seemed bright in his lighter moments and grave in the darker ones. An excellent cast.

Ciel - Meh. Their choice of voice actress, Brina Palencia, was terrible. It sounded way too much like an emo girl and not enough like a 12-year-old British earl.

Bard, Finnian, Mey-Rin - WAY too forced on the British accents. What happened here?!

The Undertaker - The worst casting in the entire show. He sounds way too much like some creeper from a kid's show.

Madam Red - Wonderful. She sounded exactly as I had imagined her to.

Grelle - He was a great cast too! He pulled off the effeminate gay male thing extraordinarily well! Not to mention he sounded dark when he needed to be.

Lau - Better than I had expected. The combinations of a Chinese and British accent went along like peas and carrots.

Angela - Excellent. Haven't heard her male part though, but the female was great.

Overall good.",1295136000,2,1279,4.599118942731278
4309849,4,B004AJDEBE,"Okay, I gotta admit I watched the fansubs for this looong before it was announced for an American release and - I LOVE IT! The manga is awesome, the anime is awesome too! The plot is pretty good, the characters highly interesting, the art beautiful, the music great. All around well worth watching by any anime fan, especially if you're a fangirl (who can say no to Sebastian's demon grin?) So, even though I had already watched the entire series when it was released in the US I grabbed it up on pre-order (and got a dang good price here too!) But I gotta say the English version's voice acting drove me insane! As good as the translation and adaptation was the fake British accents were...well horribly grating on the ears. I can't actually watch it in English because of this! Funimation has a Youtube channel with a few episodes in English, I say try them on there first! I normally like British accents too but I can't take this! However, if you set it in Japanese with English subtitles, it's pretty good! The packaging is pretty too! Sebastian and Ciel on one side of the box and Grell and Madame Red on the other (plus Sebastian on the individual DVD covers and the covers are reversible with more art on the inside!), a nice and shiny black box will also be able to hold the second part of season one perhaps...there is definitely extra space in there for some reason! The only let down of the limited edittion seems to be well, what exactly is different? The limited edition comes with a pretty box...but the DVD's don't seem to have any extra's that aren't on the standard edition...no special goodies either like I was told on ANN. If you want a collector's box it's worth it, but if you want something more you will be disappointed. You could choose to get whichever version you want and you would probably be just as happy! But if you want to support the anime industry or just get this on DVD in a pretty box, the show itself is well worth it and highly recommended! Scoop it up and enjoy! (Just don't be disappointed with the lack of 'limited edition' goodies or grating fake accents, if you can stand that you'll be fine!)",1294790400,12,2139,4.4731457800511505
4309850,5,B004AJDEBE,"I love this anime a lot, though I have to agree with other reviewers and say the manga is better. But hey, what manga ISN'T better than the anime(other than ones that were written after the anime). I am not going to make this review very long, seeing how I personally hate reviews that pick at every little thing in the series, and are 5 pages long. (plus I am a bit lazy to make it very detailed)

Art/Animation:
I liked the art. I totally disagree with the other reviewer saying it was hard to recognize Sebastian in the anime. Seriously? What? Are you partially blind or something? Animation and drawings are completely different, so there obviously be some differences. I enjoyed both greatly.

Story:
I've read up to the most recent chapter releases of the manga, in Japan and I can't tell even begin to tell you how far way this anime strays from the plot of the manga. Though I suppose it'd be boring for both the anime and manga to be completely the same. Yes, there was some slight fillers in the first season, but nothing too bad that made me even begin to dislike the series. I wasn't a big fan of where the plot went at the ending of the series though, mainly because it got sort of dumb and freaky.

Characters:
The characters are amazing in BOTH the anime and manga. I love all the characters, (okay, all of them except Lizzy) and think their personalities are shown very well.

Overall:
I'd highly recommend this series. Especially if you are a fan of BL (there are some nice hints). I LOVE all of Yana Toboso works, and will be a fan for a very long time. While this series has it's -.- moments. I still very much enjoyed it.

Ps. I haven't purchased this product but I plan to. I just wanted to leave a review that this series was very good, since it got such a bad review.",1294358400,41,1790,4.33134328358209
4309851,5,B004AJDEBE,"This is an absolutely brilliant anime that I'd highly recommend. It has a well rounded story and very clever plot lines. The characters are very well made and unique, and the characters develop throughout the anime. And the art style is a perfect 5 star, I can't recall another anime with such elegant and unique art style.
There are a few questionable yaoi moments, but it doesn't overtake the anime and it's mostly noticeable only if you look into it. The 'yaoi' of this anime is probably over advertised and isn't used nearly as much in the actual anime. So it's just however you wan't to look at it.
I would recommend watching it in Japanese though, it sounds right and it's worth reading the subtitles.
Overall it is a must have.",1294099200,6,734,4.568181818181818
4309852,5,B004AJDEBE,"The first thing you'll notice about this anime is the art, which is beautiful.  Its Gothic and romantic and an overall feast for the eyes.  However, the story is in a league all its own.  I've seen tons of anime from all genres and Black Butler was refreshing and surprising to me.  The tale is a dark one of a young boy who has lost everything but his hate and desire for revenge.  Who can get this young noble what he wants?  Well, a demon of course.  And for the mere price of his soul.  The characters are fun and you find yourself liking almost all of them.  All of the characters have their role to play as well.  This series also has plenty of very pretty men to look at...you know, if that's your thing.  Its worth buying and worth watching, one hell of an anime.",1291507200,3,771,4.1768707482993195
4309853,1,B004AJDEBE,"I agree with a previous reviewer that this anime is only good if you haven't read the manga. And even then it's not great: you can see hints of intelligent, clever characters, and an over-arcing story line that wants to emerge but never fully develops.... then veers off completely into gibberish. And what exactly defines gibberish? Try gender-bending angels, people being sewn together, and plot details that directly contradict things that have been established in previous episodes. And then all that filler...

I personally don't think the characters stay true to their manga counterparts at all. Ciel only returns to avenge the murder of his parents and then it's meal time for his demon butler, Sebastian. This short circuits his character something fierce; the contract in the manga is binding until death and Ciel's goal is to live the life that was stolen from him at whatever cost. Just having him return for revenge turns him into a depressive case with motives so nihilistic one wonders why he didn't just stay dead in the first place. In the manga, Sebastian is shrewd, manipulative, and deadly -- and yet oddly likable, especially when baffled by human behavior or caught in a tender moment with the feline loves of his life. In the anime he's little more than a stoic Ken doll (and what is up with his vampiric complexion?) with almost no emotional range whatsoever. The narrative tension between Ciel and Sebastian, their mutual co-dependence despite disliking each other and the resulting power struggle between them, is barely established at all. There's a lot more to them than the typical master/servant relationship and the anime hardly scratches the surface of it. The secondary characters are dumbed down as well (which is saying a lot, especially when you realize the servants aren't supposed to be bright to begin with), or omitted entirely and replaced with disappointing caricatures that forward the incomprehensible filler plot.

There's also the historical accuracy issue. The series takes place in Victorian England, and with a few deliberate tongue-in-check exceptions, the manga is well-researched and the background details as well as most cultural references are accurate. This... is not the case in the anime. They didn't even try. It's sad to think all of Yana Toboso's research goes to waste in this slapdash adaptation.

Speaking of slapdash, I think it's funny that there is manga art on the cover of this box set. If you're looking for that beautiful, detailed artwork in the anime, you're going to be sorely disappointed. I have a difficult time even looking at the anime art after reading the manga. The backgrounds are lackluster and in a lot of cases, the character designs just don't look right. I know there's got to be some issues with rendering stuff for animation, but the proportions on Sebastian are SO off that I can't even recognize him as the same character.

To conclude, the Kuroshitsuji manga isn't about revenge; it's about living with the choices you'd made, for good or for evil... and that there can be redemption even in darkness and damnation from good intentions. It's a fantastic read with gorgeous artwork. The Kuroshitsuji anime is about... making money off the franchise without any regard for its vision or craft.

So please, please, if you are interested in the premise of this series, take the $50 you'd spend on this and buy the manga volumes instead.",1291420800,20,3424,5.0
