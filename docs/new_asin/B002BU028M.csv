8361906,5,B002BU028M,I've loved Betty since I originally received this video as little girl. Its funny and yhe quality of the copy I received was great,1368662400,,130,4.458333333333333
8361907,3,B002BU028M,"All of the Betty Boop cartoons are emphatically NOT in public domain. And no one can state that these cartoons will never receive an official release as most of the known Boop titles (two are considered ""lost"" films) were released in an authorized set during the heyday of VHS.

This set looks like an ""okay"" mix of early and later Betty cartoons, but nothing really remarkable here. All things considered, the price point seems high compared to other Boop DVDs also available here on Amazon (one set offers 42 titles for less than $11) - especially given that this is a DVD-R ""burn on demand"" product.",1295308800,2,602,4.679245283018868
8361908,4,B002BU028M,"There are not many official releases of these cartoons available because all of them are available in the Public Domain and so the profit margins are not enough to be worth putting them out.  I have seen several of these versions released through different companies over the last few years.  It seems that they get a bit better with each version.

It is important to realize that these specific cartoons are probably never going to be released by one of the big box companies like MGM or Universal so if you are a fan of Betty and you want these on DVD, then this is one of the better versions to have.  This version has alot of good material even if the sound and video quality is not the greatest.  You can watch these online for free but for a collector or fan, that is usually not the way they want to watch them.",1255305600,2,818,4.285714285714286
8361909,2,B002BU028M,"This is not an official release. For whatever reasons the 8-volume Betty Boop - The Definitive Collection [VHS] released 11 years ago on VHS & Laserdisc formats, the (so far) ultimate and remastered collection, remains unreleased by the copyright holder, Republic Pictures Home Video. People are reporting problems with these discs, hardly suprising, since they're buying them from pirates, and not the copyright holder.

Do yourself a favor-- buy the video box set, and if you really *must* have them on DVD transfer them to DVD yourself, most new computers with a DVD burner can do this with a minimum of fuss and effort.",1254441600,10,623,4.990384615384615
8361910,5,B002BU028M,"I have been a Betty Boop fan for a very long time and all her cartoons are absolute classic.  Betty has come a long way since her first appearance in 1932 in Stopping the Show.  She is still a sex symbol today.  Its amazing that animation almost supersceded the Stag Film for appeal to the male audience.

This collection has several awsome early episodes.  Betty Boop's Bamboo Isle is an absolute classic from 1932.  You get a great cross section of years and tales.  Minnie the Moocher is probably the most famous episode you will find on this DVD.  Starring Cab Calloway and his band.

There is also a great little Bonus Feature in Betty's Rise to Fame.",1253664000,,656,4.491525423728813
8361911,2,B002BU028M,"This inexpensive issue has a mixture of early and later Betty Boop cartoons, some with the TV releasing logos.
I searched in vain for some of my favorites, these really are some of the lesser Boops. A couple of the cartoons exhibit just the slightest blurring in the transfer to digital but generally they're just fine. The music (which was always outstanding) comes through very well.
For the price this collection would be serviceable to give today's children an idea of the inventiveness of past animation.",1193616000,,509,4.930232558139535
