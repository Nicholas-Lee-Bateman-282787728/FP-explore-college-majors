8694807,4,B00RC3WNE4,"An office comedy about two best friend finance grads who embark on a crazy mission to stop an investment bank from closing a crooked deal involving student loans. color me shocked, I really did like this movie. I did find that I laughed quite a few times. When these 2 best friends, Michael Seater and Joe Dinicol set out to stop Alan Thicke from screwing over ever student who holds a student loan things get funny and then threaten to split up these 2 best of friends. I say give this one a whirl, the cast of young people are quite fun and talented. Stereotypical characterizations aside it works and I really had a fine time with it.",1459209600,,637,4.406779661016949
