8024828,5,B00029UB8K,"As a teenager living in England, prior to living in Australia, my Parents used to accomodate Norwegian Students who attended Manchester University.  As they really enjoyed the support that my Parents provided to them, they invited My Parents and I to visit their Families in Norway, which was a very enjoyable experience.

This is the main reason I purchased the DVD of the Norway Tour, as I have very, very Fond Memories of my Visit to Norway.
I really found your Norway DVD to be really terrific, and it has brought many of those fond memories back to me about my travel experiences in Norway!!

It is a really Fascinating and Enjoyable DVD, and I am Delighted to have Purchased it!  Thank You, Brian Griffiths",1366416000,,712,4.672
8024829,1,B00029UB8K,"I am a Norwegian living in the US too. I bought this DVD to show it to friends and colleagues here in Oklahoma.
I was very disappointed after watching it. The photographer is obviously an amateur.
My grandma could have done it better!
Don't buy it! It is not worth the money.
You are much better off buying a book with nice pictures.",1262044800,,333,4.301587301587301
8024830,1,B00029UB8K,"I am a Norwegian living in the US. I bought this DVD to show it to visitors and friends here in the Memphis area. I was very disappointed after watching it the first time. The Norwegian classical music is great, but the quality of the filming is not very impressive. It is not even ""half way done"" I think. You are much better off buying a book with nice pictures and actual text in it since there is no commentary on this DVD.",1165795200,8,427,4.156626506024097
8024831,5,B00029UB8K,"This is a beautiful, artist video. Watching it is like walking thru a museum of wonderful photographs.  I'm going to Europe this summer and Norway will be my first stop.",1107993600,4,169,4.633333333333334
8024832,1,B00029UB8K,"I was so disappointed to receive this DVD. First it took 5 attempts to get my player to ""read"" it. Then when it finely did play, pixils were visable, the music was skipping and a full 2 minutes into it, it stopped dead. I never heard any narration - maybe there isn't supposed to be, which my husband and I thought strange for a travel DVD. He also thought what we did see didn't amount to much. There isn't much up to date tourist information about Norway out there. And apparently there still isn't !",1107820800,11,502,4.294736842105263
8024833,1,B00029UB8K,The DVD looked as though the person filming was an amateur. The camera angles were odd and the places of interest were questionable. I am planning a trip to Norway this spring and was hoping to gain some insight into a few destinations with this DVD but it didn't focus on any points of interest. The music was pretty but this is not a DVD I would recommend if you want to see Norway!,1107475200,17,384,4.202702702702703
