8684220,2,B00OMCKXL8,"Review of Green Grow the Rushes
Hot Toasty Rag, July 21, 2017

If it can happen to Richard Burton, it can happen to anyone. It was early on in his career, so thankfully, everyone was able to forget about this one after he made My Cousin Rachel the following year. Green Grow the Rushes is a very silly movie, one that you wouldnt expect a Shakespearean actor to make.

A group of men try to smuggle brandy in through old smuggling ships, but a young female reporter tries to get in their way by sort of pretending she doesnt know what they're up to, but then admitting she knows and is going to write a newspaper article about it, but then forgets her plan altogether because Richard Burton flirts with her. Its a little confusing, but then again, you won't really care about the plot enough to really try to figure it out. Its very silly, and I wouldnt really recommend it.",1500595200,,874,4.388888888888889

It seems to say a delivery has been attempted at my house 2 days ago, but it was the first attempt today.  I asked the person delivering item and he says that it arrived at Bridgend before it was delivered to him to deliver it to me.  So the problem was delivering it at Bridgend in Wales, not with me personally.  I don't know how to set that right.",1452729600,,451,4.174418604651163

Only four stars because the original editing seems a bit rough and abrupt. But very well worth a viewing if you like classic British comedy.",1418860800,,311,4.571428571428571
