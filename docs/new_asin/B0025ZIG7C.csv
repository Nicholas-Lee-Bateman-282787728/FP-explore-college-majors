8533172,2,B0025ZIG7C,"The disk I received (which matches the cover pictured) is that of the the 1942 Zoltan Korda film ""Jungle Book"".  It looks to be a well done film, but it is NOT animated, and has NOTHING to do with Disney. The video transfer of the movie appears to be taken from a well-worn print, with quite a few scratches and color aberrations.

The disk and cover case I received appear a little suspicious: the cover was printed with an inkjet or laser printer, there is no title on the spine, and the disk seems to be screen-printed by hand or with the same inkjet printer.  Also, the disk is a blue DVD-R (rather than the typical commercial silver), indicating a small duplication shop's efforts.  In short, the media's physical presentation is much like what we did for one of the first independent films I was involved in producing.

As long as you know that you're getting something other than the Disney animated movie, this is an interesting film that is more true to Rudyard Kipling's book of the same name.  The video quality is murky, but the cinematography is excellent, along with the acting.  Caveat emptor.",1292889600,4,1108,4.622448979591836

The film quality has been remastered very well.

Great Movie!",1271980800,,143,4.916666666666667
8533174,1,B0025ZIG7C,"Despite the references to ""Disney animation"" and the correct date and director of the Disney movie, this is NOT the 1967 Disney movie, but the 1942 live-action version, which you can find for less elsewhere.",1265068800,4,207,4.942857142857143
