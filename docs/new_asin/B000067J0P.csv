7962868,2,B000067J0P,"film. I cant say I was expecting too much from it. It doesnt have anyone known attached to it and it is clearly pretty low budget. It revolves around a wimpy office worker who inadvertently, boring story short, becomes an underground wrester. The wrestling gives him more confidence, but he is still kind of stupid. Even when he stands up for himself, its just awkward. His boss is a jerk and its kind of ridiculous how he gets away with physically abusing his employees. This type of violent slap-stick goofy humor is popular in Asian countries Ive noticed. Some of the wrestling scenes are kind of wacky and funny, but this was just a boring pointless movie in the end.",1415232000,,671,4.6
7962869,1,B000067J0P,"I ordered this movie and it is a Chinese dubbed version of the Korean movie.  Now that is great for someone who speaks Chinese, but if you are looking for the Korean version Amazon is defrauding you.  For those of you who like foreign films, you need to urge Amazon to do the right thing and tell us what we are getting.",1106092800,27,320,4.145161290322581
7962870,5,B000067J0P,"Being a huge admirer of Asian cinema and pro wrestling, I picked up ""The Foul King"" with few expectations; I was curious how a comedy about pro wrestling in South Korea would play out, especially years after South Korea's glory days of the pop-sport have come and gone.
For many of us Americanos who love Asian flicks are aware, comedy can get lost in translation and/or different cultural tastes. I found the comedy in The Foul King outright funny, with no humorous blockades or borders. The actors have a unique spontaneity, delivering physical humor that doesn't go too ""over the top."" The comedy is just shy of being typical sophomoric humor, but they pull in the reigns before they cross the line from comedic to buffoonery. Good dramatic performances are an effective contrast to the silliness, and these element make for one of my favorite DVD surprises in the past year.
We have seen similar premises since the silent movies: Dae-Ho is a mediocre performing office worker in a mediocre office, brow-beaten by an abusive supervisor, and pretty much a loser outside the office. He chances upon a pro wrestling gym, suffering in both the talent pool and the economic side, and whose owner is looking for potential students. Dae-Ho dreams of following in the footsteps of Korea's wrestling icons like Kim Il. The road to his fantasy has multiple snags & bumps, with organized crime and day-job conflicts jumping into the mix to keep this a fresh comic caper.
I recommend this DVD whole-heartedly. The protagonists are refreshing, the heels are loathsome. An age-old plot, yes...but an irresistible age-old plot!",1087776000,10,1615,4.96309963099631
7962871,5,B000067J0P,"The Foul King is an enjoyable movie whose main character (Dae-Ho)feels trapped in a job that he doesn't want. He may lack ambition, but this is do to he feeling of helplessness that many people feel in a profession they do not care for.
  Dae-Ho is assulted my his manager at work, and is pretty much a loser, but you can't help but feel sorry for him,...even his father feels he is pathetic. One day while heading home he spots a gym and sees a poster advertising wrestling. Thinking about how he can learn to defend himself (he can't even escape a feeble headlock) he thinks about becoming a wrestler,or at least, learning how to wrestle. We come to lean he loved wrestling growing up and even mentions some true life Korean pro wrestling legends, Kim Il and Ultra Tiger Mask (who came before the Japanese Tiger Mask). Dae-Ho also finds out that his trainer was the original Ultra Tiger Mask, and he develops a sense of respect and responsability he has not shown in the movie prior . He learns the silly theatrics of pro wrestling but also learns the true athleticism that pro wrestling can require(more commonly found in Korea and especally Japan). The lead actor even does most of his own stunts.

  The movie is serious about providing laughs but never takes itself too seriously, which is the secret to its humor. I've spoken to many who are not wrestling fans who but who have seen the movie and enjoy it for what it is, lighthearted, livley and most importantly...funny. And that is something that is missing from so many so-called comedies today.
  This movie went on to become the all time top grossing Korean comedy and the second highest grossing Korean film over all. It is also what the American film ""Joe Somebody"" starring Tim Allen, was loosely based on.
  If you can, rent it, and if you enjoy it half as much as I do, you may want to consider owning it. It gets better with each viewing.",1078185600,,1907,4.536443148688047
7962872,3,B000067J0P,"Ok, Kim Jee-Woon is no doubt talented and the film has a style and whimsy that seems to transcend cultural boundaries. Yet none of the film's plot strands coalesece into a coherent ending... well, because there is no ending! I find it interesting that not a SINGLE review mentions this, perhaps because the glossy exterior keeps us from pinpointing some of the glaring structural problems.  Still, before everything leads to the inevitable and cliched final battle, FOUL KING is a rarity-- a comedy that is actually funny.",1056412800,4,522,5.0
7962873,5,B000067J0P,"Foul King is a Korean comedy about a [guy] stuck in a dead end job. He constantly daydreams about becoming a professional wrestler and manages to fulfill his dreams. You don't need to be a wrestling fan or Korean (or both) to enjoy this film. Even with the subtitles, it's funnier than most Hollywood ""comedies"" of recent years. I consider myself very picky when it comes to films..very few I like..esp comedies. But this one had me laughing out loud.",1023580800,7,451,4.65
