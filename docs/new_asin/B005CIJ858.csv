8465498,5,B005CIJ858,"I had both hips replaced, and after physical therapy I wanted safe exercises to continue healing.  Since Maki, the instructor, had both her hips replaced, who better than her to instruct exercises for post hip surgery.  I just finished the work out, and was able to do most exercises. Of the lunge section,  I only did the easy lunge one, though, and did not attempt the side plank.  You can choose which exercises you want to do, and to do them the best of your ability.  If you want you can split the exercises up by days,between floor and standing ones.  She continues to remind you to breath and tighten your abs, which I appreciate.
  The music was fine for me. I didn't really notice it as I was concentrating on the movements. And when I did listen, I liked the music.
  I recommend the dvd if you have completed physical therapy, and go at your own pace. Happy healing.",1517184000,,877,4.425
8465499,3,B005CIJ858,"The exercises and direction are good, but the low-budget, stock ""music"" is so awful that I haven't been using it.",1425600000,2,113,4.7
8465500,4,B005CIJ858,"This is for POST-REHAB after hip surgery!  Of course, your surgeon doesn't approve. . .you would not do these exercises immediately after surgery!

Post-rehab, rehabilitation is desperately under emphasized, greatly needed!  If I had stopped with the surgeon's prescribed number of physical therapy visits after my total hip replacement, I would be crippled!

 I am so thankful I have an excellent personal trainer who, having been a high school coach, dedicated himself to learning about and training the human body to continually work toward well-ness through the discipline of diet, strength, and flexibility training.  As a nurse, I have watched too many people sit down and become home bound after hip and knee surgery.  Thank goodness for people who are motivated and willing to help others find exercises that will get them and keep them going!  After all, isn't that also the surgeon's goal?",1407369600,7,899,5.194444444444445
8465501,1,B005CIJ858,"My surgeon does not agree with anything in the video.  Dangerous for those with a new hip.
Should be dropped from Amazon",1397174400,2,120,4.454545454545454
8465502,4,B005CIJ858,"The workout is similar to my therapy exercises, but it goes to the next step which is good. I like how she goes carefully. I'm always worried about popping my hip out of socket.  And I like the fact that she's dressed conservatively and not in a skimpy outfit like some of the exercise gurus.",1391817600,5,292,4.3090909090909095
8465503,4,B005CIJ858,"After completing all my physical therapy, I was looking for more exercises to do at home.  This DVD has more advanced exercises than were given by my physical therapist.  At first I had trouble laying on the operated side to do some of the exercises, but if I added a towel to my mat I was able to do them.  I was a little sore 48 hours later, but this is a sign that the exercises will be helpful.  Maki is very enthusiastic.  I will be buying the second DVD.

My only criticism is that there is no option to play without the music.  My next viewing I'm going to have to run it on mute and just watch -- while playing my own music.  The DVD's sounds (not really even music) on the floor work is very repetitive and uninspiring.",1372896000,9,728,4.113475177304965
