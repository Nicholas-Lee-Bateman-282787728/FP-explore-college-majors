8307369,5,B001GXPFR8,"Elizabeth is a Pilates professional. She has taken all the medical guidelines, her Pilates and personal experience and created a great Pilates-based work-out for both pregnancy and postpartum. Elizabeth is a gifted teacher with wonderful attention to detail. She has all the knowledge and experience you would want in an instructor. She has created a safe and effective Pilates-based video.
Elizabeth was my first Pilates teacher and trained me over 30 years ago. I have taught prenatal/postpartum classes for 2 hospitals in Texas so I am familiar with all the medical guidelines and Pilates exercises that she has incorporated in creating this program. While watching (and doing!) the video I felt like I was in a session with her. So even being a Pilates teacher in my 50's I got that wonderful long, lengthened Pilates workout feeling from doing the video. Truly a program for pregnancy and beyond. I highly recommend this video.",1370131200,,932,5.098039215686274
8307370,4,B001GXPFR8,"I enjoyed using this dvd for research on working with pregnant clients very much. I am also a classically-trained Pilates teacher and I was certified by Romana Kryzanowska in 1994. This workout goes beyond the traditional method by modifying the work for the sake of safety and effective results. The cueing is excellent; her anatomy is sound; her use of props is creative and intelligent, and all Pilates teachers have something to learn from Elizabeth there. She herself is full of empathy, wisdom, kindness, positive support and above all she is engaged with the movement of her client in front of her. She is personally experienced with four pregnancies, so her wisdom is inherent. I did the workout not being pregnant myself, and did feel worked by applying her cues deeply. That's how you break a sweat.

Elizabeth Jones-Boswell gives clear and energized instruction with valuable imagery. The dvd is full of interesting details and beautiful, strong demonstrators. I appreciate her work and I recommend the dvd for pregnant exercisers and above all for Pilates teachers for their continuing education.",1318723200,,1108,5.155555555555556
8307371,2,B001GXPFR8,"I am a classically certified pilates instructor and I hunted high and low for a pilates pregnancy DVD which was vetted by medical professionals because so many DVDs out there have pregnant woman doing unadvisable exercises. While the exercises on this DVD are vetted and clearly explained, they are very simple and slow-moving, and none of them resemble any of Joseph Pilates original work. I think it's even a stretch calling it ""pilates-based"". It is much more yoga-based in my opinion (with cues on strange breathing and meditation portions). You will not break any sweat doing this video. I was looking for a more challenging video that has been vetted by medical professionals. Also, the fact that the video states that its 123 minutes is misleading as multiple sections of the DVD are repeated. If you are looking for something really really low impact or you're so out of shape you have issues with basic movements then maybe invest in this DVD...otherwise, I say pass and spend your $$$ on something else.",1301702400,4,1013,4.895348837209302
8307372,5,B001GXPFR8,"basic, easy, safe and to the point! Great in pregnancy...now just have to find time in my schedule to this! this video and regular walking would be a great way to stay in shape during pregnancy.",1232236800,,194,4.416666666666667
8307373,5,B001GXPFR8,"Elizabeth is a giften instructor.  Her talent and gentle spirit combine to provide effective, strengthening, yet soothing exercise.",1231459200,,131,6.277777777777778
8307374,5,B001GXPFR8,"This DVD is great for so many reasons: The instruction is clear and easy to follow, the music is not distracting, workouts are can be done in under an hour, and Elizabeth's voice is so calming. I feel reborn when I finish the exercises. I strongly recommend this video if you are looking for a workout that will make you feel strong and empowered both physically and mentally.",1228780800,2,376,4.544117647058823
8307375,5,B001GXPFR8,My back feels so much better after only one week! This DVD is excellent. The exercises are clearly introduced and then pieced together in a flowing class that ends in relaxation/meditation.,1228176000,2,189,5.129032258064516
