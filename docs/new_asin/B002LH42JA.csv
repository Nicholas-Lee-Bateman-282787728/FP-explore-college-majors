3948090,5,B002LH42JA,I thought this film was very interesting.  It presented evidence that I had not heard of before.  Now I too believe that the British govt. killed Diana.,1390867200,7,152,4.592592592592593

8373071,1,B002LH42JA,"Horrible. Don't waste your money. I thought this was a documentary. It's a cheap ""talk show""that looks like it was shot by high school kids. Just two men drooning on and on.",1457049600,,173,4.4375

8373074,5,B002LH42JA,It sure makes you think.  When Diana died the firm's problem was gone!!!!  Did they or did they not.  Brits version of the JFK mystery.,1412035200,,135,4.32
8373075,3,B002LH42JA,Interesting but unnerving to watch documentary. This is due to some of the dubious gore details and overall the paranoid tone. Enjoy is you must. Nuff Said!,1410825600,,156,4.814814814814815

8373078,3,B002LH42JA,I don't care whether she destroyed herself or whether an agency of the British Government did it.  She was an international embarrassment and disgraced her position (and I'm a libertarian).  Good riddance to bad rubbish!,1398038400,,220,5.257142857142857
8373079,5,B002LH42JA,"This is the first time I've heard of Boston Brakes.  It is a very interesting piece of information as is this whole interview.  Whether right or wrong, we will probably never know because of the amount of evidence that was destroyed or never looked at. I hope to read and hear more about this.",1392681600,6,293,4.407407407407407
