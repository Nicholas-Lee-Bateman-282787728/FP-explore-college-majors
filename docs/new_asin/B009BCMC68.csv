8539436,5,B009BCMC68,This is an excellent DVD to have in your collection if you are a B&B fan.  These episodes are 76-100.  It does play on a standard DVD region 1 player.  For US and Canada purchase the region 0 DVD only. There is also audio in English if you don't know German.  I had to use Google translator to find out what the episodes are about.  I am a big fan of old episodes and glad to see the episode of Brooke and Stephanie's first meeting.  I think it's on a previous box set.  Please Amazon order the 1st 2 boxes so I can watch them.,1431734400,,527,3.961904761904762
