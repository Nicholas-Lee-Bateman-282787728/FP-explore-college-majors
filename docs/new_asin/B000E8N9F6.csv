8107197,5,B000E8N9F6,"Joseph Lerner, almost a legend, delivers a tightly stylized noir in C-Man that brought him to the attention of Martin Scorsese,
who dedicated New York New York to Lerner. This print of C-Man is occasionally dodgy, but that only adds to the low-budget
joy. Complete with heavy voice-over, NYC locations and a juicy supporting role of John Carradine, C-Man is one of those
forgotten film noirs that shouldn't be forgotten. Loved every minute!",1392681600,2,440,5.041095890410959
