2936444,2,B000VDDDUU,"When Nietzsche Wept is a fun little movie, but not much more. The academic mind may gather interesting tidbits of allusive material, anecdotes that qualify in flesh a mode and a period, but little else in terms of insight or theoretical enlightenment. It is unfair to ask of so much from a movie, but there have been gems which have accomplished much more without pretending half as much, which is the main reason for my two stars. There are dream sequences that skirt the parodic while insinuating to be reminiscent strains of a therapeutic groundwork, but these are really a far cry from being of any import to anything but excessively  reductive commonplace assumptions popo culture has already adopted grand scale. The passion of Nietzsche is depicted with emotional farce, but the actor here cannot do justice to the gentle genius that trumpeted the death of God, a death knell poeticized and antagonized by a secularism in disguise and denial. Whatever the merits of Nietzsche may have been, the shortcomings the movie's depiction of Viennese physician Dr. Josef Breuer are extensive and irresponsible, if one wishes to here locate historical accurancy rather than artistic liberty. Infact Dr. Breuer is a man so comical and absurd here we end up pitying a mind who should command reverence and applause. I do not know why this motion picture ends up ridiculing, even mocking a man who has had so much influence on contemporary culture. It is really disturbing to see a legacy so belittled and denigrated. Perhaps I am being too rough on the script, and I must also here note that I have not read the novel by Irvin D. Yalom, who also has written a cute paraphrase on Shopenhauer.
Any vigor that may result from a revival of women who have influenced the course of history, yet had no claim in our paternalistic, phallocentric historical narrative, are debunked by its crass infusion of hysteria ironically presented without enough sensibility or attention to Bertha, who needless to say, deserves better treatment. Lou Salome is perhaps a positive presence in the movie, but she is also rendered without a modicum of wit or grace, and only her strength of character and presence of mind are evoked somewhat satisfactorily. Finaly the young Freud is but an aside and we are never offered an opportunity to understand his musings on the ""talking cure"" even slantwise.
Finally the filmography, the editing and the presentation of the philosophy of Nietzsche are so reductive one comes out of this viewing hoping these fools had better sense than its director.
It doesn't make you think and it doesn't make you question. Does it entertain? That depends on your taste, but if you enjoy zany productions you may come out of this with a laugh or two, otherwise any Hollywood movie has more to offer.",1200700800,41,2799,4.880252100840337
2936445,5,B000VDDDUU,"The story presumably takes place during the short timespan of friendship that gave birth to the new science of psychiatry. ""The Talking Cure"" as it was labeled by Dr. Josef Breuer, a general practitioner, agrees to help a troubled and suicidal philosopher named Friedrich Nietzsche. Dr. Breuer becomes the patient.

Both actors: Ben Cross and Armand Assante, deserve to share the best actor Oscar. Best screenplay (adapted from a novel of the same title by Irvin Yalom) of the year also belongs to this movie. Best director (Pinchas Perry), editing, sound, costume design and makeup, cinematography, all belong to this movie.

2936446,4,B000VDDDUU,"I watched this movie, because it was filmed in my hometown - Ruse, Bulgaria.
Ruse is a big Bulgarian city on the Danube river.
The movie producers found a great similarity betweem the architecture of Ruse and the architechture of Austria's capital Vienna.
The opening scene says that it happens in ""Cafe Rousse"", at the riverbank of the Danube river. Then they lead you to believe that the action continues in Vienna, but actually the filming continued in Ruse.
I really like the setting of the movie - it shows charming buildings and streets as if they were in the 19-th century. It shows also a lake which is neraby Ruse.
However, in the middle of the movie they show some mentally insane people. And they show how Nietzsche and his doctor gradually become crazy, and the nightmares they had. So this part with the madness was somewhat uncomfortable to watch and that is why I rate it 4 stars, not 5. But the overall environment of the movie was very natural and beautiful, so I recommend it for you to watch it. Furthermore, feel invited to visit Ruse, because it really is attractive for tourists. I grew up in Ruse and I plan to retire there as well, although in the middle of my life I live in other cities too.",1199404800,3,1217,4.486486486486487
2936447,4,B000VDDDUU,"WHEN NIETZSCHE WEPT gives us an insight into the beginnings of Psychology and particularly the Treatment of Talking as begun not by Sigmund Freud, but instead by the brilliant yet troubled mind of philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche and the Viennese physician Dr. Josef Breuer.  Pinchas Perry adapted the novel by the same name by Irvin D. Yalom and also directs this period piece.  The film works on many levels: the flavor of the period is well captured (though Vienna in the film is Bulgarian locations!), the ideas are fresh to some, and the pacing and use of moments of fine classical music tidbits add flavor.  If only more attention had been paid to the theories discussed...

1872 is the time and two men are haunted by demons, and the 'demons' happen to be failed love affairs with famous women.  Dr. Josef Breuer (Ben Cross) is a famous physician but is obsessed with an hysterical young woman Bertha (Michal Yannai).  Another beautiful lady enters Breuer's world in the form of Lou Salome (Katheryn Winnick) who has had a brief affair with the philosopher Nietzsche (Arman Assante) and feels he needs Breuer's help with his 'Talk Therapy'. The two men meet, share fears, and agree to a mutually beneficial relationship: Breuer will help Nietzsche with his migraines (due to his obsession with Lou Salome) and Nietzsche will share his philosophical approach to the world to help Breuer with is recurring nightmares.  The resulting experience is an introduction to psychoanalysis as a treatment, a treatment that fascinates the young Freud (Jamie Elman).

The action is a bit heavy on the dream and surreal sequences instead of being a learned exploration of a very important period of history.  The quality of acting is variable: Assante seems the only one to wholly grasp his role as Nietzsche.  The film has many flaws but in the end it is an interesting introduction to the history of an important movement in medicine.  It takes patience to watch but it is well worth the viewer's time.  Grady Harp, December 07",1197331200,35,2021,4.894428152492669
2936448,5,B000VDDDUU,"Many people associate the birth of psychoanalysis with Sigmund Freud; and to be sure, Freud was indeed the master to whom we owe this technique.  But what is not known is the degree to which Freud was indebted to the greatest philosopher, not only in the nineteenth century, but in the whole of human history, Friedrich Nietzsche.
This film is based on Irvin Yalom's excellent book of the same title (which I also recommend, along with Dr. Yalom's THE SCHOPENHAEUR CURE).  It captures, not only the spirit of the age (late nineteenth century Vienna), but also the essence of Nietszche, who is brilliantly portrayed by one of my favorite actors (see his GOTTI), Armand Assante.
Assante captures the dynamism of Nietzsche in his very first scene, when he is lecturing on his famous ""god is dead"" statement in the classroom.  While I will not go into the plotline, suffice it to say that this film deals with many themes that are universal, and presents the material in a way that is gripping and enlightening.  I very much doubt that many viewers over a certain age will not recognize in some of the experiences that they will see some of their own life events.
Yalom's book, and Nietzsche's philosophy, helped me in a very dark time in my own life, when I had to cope with many of the same issues that plague Nietzsche's character.  Then, as now, it is a healing experience to see this film show how our most enslaving obsessions can be endured, overcome and healed to make us stronger and free.
I cannot recommend this film enough.",1196899200,49,1531,4.655555555555556
2936449,4,B000VDDDUU,"First of all, I highly recommend reading the book first, as the film did not cover several key aspects of the plot, nor could it have explored all the nuances involved in the story without greatly adding to the film's length.  Second, I gave the film four out of five stars because, in picking and choosing the aspects of the book to incorporate in the film, I believe overlooking the significance of the doves, as well as totally leaving out Dr. Breuer's relationship with a former nurse, as well as his brother-in-law, both compelling aspects to the story, were poor choices to leave out.  Just the same, it is a great shame this film was not released in theaters in the U.S., as it is not just a great period piece, but an excellent study in human nature with terrific performances by both Assante and Cross.  Nietzsche is brought to life as a human being.  For those, me included, who studied his works whilst in college, Nietzsche can never again be viewed as an abstract personality, as both the book and the film are an amalgam of several of his works, and a fiction based upon fact biography of a great and complex man.  Not only is this a study of obsessions on multiple levels; it is a brilliant study of the frailties and inner workings of the male psyche.  The film was shot in Romania, a place which is generally not often observed by the average American, and that brings a greater richness to the film. Assante's character studies in such films as The Mambo Kings, Napoleon and Josephine, Looking For An Echo, On The Beach, Gotti, and the Odyssey are all worth viewing.  It has often been said, and it must be said again:  Armand Assante is an underrated actor, and that is a terrible shame.  It is often the quiet ones who shun the limelight who do the most profound work, and I am not just saying this because I have liked Assante since he portrayed Napoleon; but, because, Mr. Assante's multi-faceted portrayals of complicated personalities have always moved me greatly.  Take a good look at his works of this nature, and you may agree with me that Assante deserves all the accolades showered upon more prominant actors such as Anthony Hopkins and Tom Hanks.",1196899200,15,2176,4.585051546391752

2936475,3,B000VDDDUU,"Dr. Josef Breuer, acting as a patient on a couch to his migraine-ridden patient Nietzsche (Mr. God-is-Dead), finds relief when he confesses to the old professor of philosophy.

What does he confess?  Simply, that although he is a very successful doctor of medicine in 1882 Vienna, rich and famous, married with three children, he is obsessed with one of his patients, Bertha Pappenheim, who is called ""hysteric"" when she becomes paralyzed and speaking in tongues, when her father gets ill.

Bertha Pappenheim came from a respected but less-well-off Jewish family of Hungarian origin, with her father a teacher at a Jewish school.  His own daughter left school by 16 but her brother, Wilhelm, continued in the secular high school, about which she was intensely jealous.  Later in life she started an orphanage and fought for the right of women to receive an education.  Austria has issued a stamp in her honor; she lived to an old age with great community involvement.

However, when she is brought into the Freudian circle, she is a young woman in her 20's manifesting panic over her father's imminent death.  Her symptoms are now recognized as neurological, but in that time were considered - in a female - to be ""hysteria"".  She is recorded in literature as The Case of Anna O.  She has a mop of unruly bright red hair and seduces her grim and serious bearded Dr. Breuer after he attempts to hold down her thrashing body during an examination.  She fantasizes that she is pregnant with his child, including nausea and all such symptons.

 Dr. Breuer, lonely and desolate in his work and his marriage, falls like a ton of bedpans for this woman, and his inner spirit, his lust, overwhelms his conscious control, his decades of careful living and working to great success and acclaim.

So to summarize the film quickly for those in a hurry:  Even older Jewish men, married, superintelligent and very busy, can fall into sexual lust and be ruined by the torment of their awakened desires.  This is illustrated in the film through fantasies/dreams acted out by the stiff-limbed older doctor and young, carefree Bertha, dancing through parks in the sunlight.  Then the dreams are followed by nightmares as his unconscious realizes his impending peril, and so he falls into bottomless pits and drowns, etc.  Luckily he wakes up, next to his presumably faithful wife and mother of his three children.

Yet go he must... and break up his life, both his work and family.

I leave the rest of the film to the viewer, to see if you can relate to the overwhelming lust for love and adventure that overcomes our Dr. Breuer.  Young Siggy Freud, his acolyte so to speak, a newly minted physician himself, meets with him occasionally, and they discuss this odd treatment of ""chimney-sweeping"" or ""talk therapy"" (Pappenheim's own terms; Breuer called it ""cathartic therapy"") on the couch.  Naturally Freud takes up this idea for himself and becomes world famous.  Freud, a product of a similar background, also considered that ""hysteria"" was something to which women were prone to.

Still, those of us older and wiser - alas and alack! - can certainly see that these impulses, this lustful dreaming, is part and parcel of everyone's mind, and has obsessed the human race throughout its history.  It is built into our biology, part of our programming to make us reproduce.  Without too much effort, Freud could have consulted his Torah, or gone to the Catholic professors of theology at the University of Vienna, and found that there is thousands of years of counsel on these subjects.

It's true that it is usually concerning the yearnings and desires of heterosexual males only, as they age, regardless of their status.  Yet it is also in the souls of women and gay men and even very old people, that their minds are filled with these annoying thoughts.  Religious leaders around the world have discussed and written about these for hundreds of generations.

As for the filming in Romania, to evoke 1882 Vienna, the buildings and costumes and coaches seem to be realistic, but I am no expert.

The plot - as such - jumped here and there unevenly, possibly disturbing those who would like a straight old-fashioned BBC-type period drama.  Meanwhile, one can quickly realize that the main story is simply one older male Jew's sexual lust ruining his life, and the skidding forward and back in time doesn't matter at all.  It's the usual jumble of an obsessed male mind of his time, place and religious upbringing - forbidden fruit is his Bertha, for he is married, and she is half his age, and she is a patient.  When his wife hears that his patient is pregnant, regardless that it turned out not to be true, Dr. Breuer ended his contact with her.

Funny in one way:  if ""hysteria"" could be ascribed to anyone in this film, I think Dr. Breuer gets the prize.  Stifled lust was in Bertha, but in Dr. Breuer, could it be called something else to make it gender-specific?  ""Testosteronia""?  Obsession of the male type?  Mid-life crisis, seven-year itch, gonad control?",1387324800,,5048,4.817653890824623

Interesting interaction between Freud and Dr. Breuer

Then she opens her mouth and the fake accent is so bad we couldn't help laughing. Natasha Fatale was more convincing on the Rocky and Bullwinkle show. The laughs kept on coming. Cut to Nietzche, ranting about the death of God in a huge lecture hall filled with maybe 4 or 5 people. Once Nietzche starts visiting our uptight doctor, the Bro-mance really takes off. The kindergarten-feud dynamic between these two is the most engaging part of the film. Maybe it's because Armand Assante and Ben Cross could be the only trained actors in the entire production. Another highlight was when Nietzche was knocked over by a horse, and it looked like his giant mustache was going to fall off. There are short meetings between old doctor Breuer and a young Freud. These scenes allow Netflix to claim this is a film about ""Nietzche and Freud... and the women who shaped their lives."" Women? Oh yeah... in this film we call them ""manic pixie dream girls."" Neitzche's going-for-a-walk love scenes with the ""Russian"" blonde are shot with the same dolly-camera sensitivity we enjoyed in the courtship between Padme and Anakin in Episode II. Breuer's flame is Bertha. She is a fake-red (I think it's Clairol #44) and she's totally CRAZY. Like, institutionalized crazy. Most of his relationship with her exists in his surreal dreams, again full of 80's-vintage video effects.

Assante is not too bad in the role of Nietzsche but is let down by the supporting cast who are unconvincing; the plot which is meandering and directionless; and the absurd dream sequences which add nothing to the movie and only serve to distract you further.

This had the potential to be a great movie but instead it seems to drag on interminably. I never fall asleep during movies but actually felt compelled to have a snooze rather than persevere with such nonsense. Even as an introduction to the ideas of Nietzsche this movie does not make a convincing case. You would be much better investing the couple of hours into reading his Ecce Homo or some of Thus Spoke Zarathustra.

If they gave Assante a decent plot involving some of the more interesting aspects of Nietzsche's life such as his falling out with Wagner and Lou Salome, explored how his philosophy developed out of the many problems he faced and tracked his descent into insanity, it would be worth watching. As it stands, I wouldn't bother with the movie at all, unless you feel like boring yourself into a stupour.",1291161600,7,1140,4.666666666666667

2936489,5,B000VDDDUU,"This movie is excellent.  To me it is more about the friendship and bonding of 2 men who are huanted by their own demons--the prisons they built for thmeselves and how they dealt with them. One trapped by duty and convention (Dr. Brauer) played by Ben Cross and one trapped by his own desire to become ensnared Nietzsche (Armande Assante).  Brauer's dream sequences are fascinating in how they are used to weave life into his own psyche.  Brauer had to lose himself in order to find himself--and contentment with his place in the world.

I won't spoil it by discussing Nietzsche's end of it but it is worth buying. It is well acted and seeing Armande Assante and Ben Cross together has made for a combination that I feel will make this movie a classic in modern times.  The acting is powerful here, and it is more than enterntaining.  It explores depth of self that I have yet to see any film delve into.  This was somewhat of a daring project for the producer and director to undertake, and it worked.

On the back of the package it talks of love and redemption, but it is the friendship of these two men that makes this movie so powerful as Assante and Cross have portrayed them, and I would love to see this pair team up together again on screen. This movie is packed with wonderful acting and great production/directing. Andreas Beckett was also wonderful in this film and should get some recognition for it! It is well worth watching and I encourage you to get it. It does give a look into the beginnings of modern psychology, but it is much more than that. Anyone can enjoy this...If you liked the movie ""The Shift"" with Dr. Wayne Dyer, you'll like this one too simply for the questions it dares to explore.",1258243200,2,1713,4.485530546623794
2936494,3,B000VDDDUU,"fredric nietzchie is going to hell! there are a few people who just did something so bad that they are most likely going there no matter what.i'd say he is a canidate for that with guys like judas iscariot,charles darwin,john wayne gacey,henry the 8th and cleopatra.
trying to convince the world that god is an illusion?he is on his way for sure!
  anyway,fredric is working with this jewish dr guy to work through thier problems.fredric has debilitating headaches and the doc needs psycho-analyzed.so they work with eachother.
  there are some very weird but entertaining nightmares that go on.these bring the otherwise sleepy movie back into the fun side for a bit.sigmund frued gives fredric most of his ideas if you watch closer.fredric sums up the docs problem as ""he is obsessed with a woman who shreds him to pieces and then he eagerly licks her bloody fangs"".
  while on the subject of the sub-concious,frued says ""if the sub-concious could be liberated it would scream all during the daylight"".
  fredric comes up with some very interesting ways to help the doc with his problems through creative visualization and such.
  fredric is a genius but his odsession with not letting anything gain power over him got his butt sentenced to hell.
the movie is slow for a lot of it.the dreams and visualization really make it worth being a keeper though.",1252195200,,1354,4.873362445414847
2936495,5,B000VDDDUU,"The work of actor Armand Assante and renown psychotherapist/storyteller, Dr. Irvin Yalom, author of the book from which the film was adapted, make this DVD more than worth owning. In his entertaining style, Yalom speculates on what might have happened between the powerful thinker, Frederick Nietzsche, and noted physician, Dr. Breuer, at the dawn of psychotherapy as the two men confront challenges of life. While handling of the dream sequences and various other aspects of filming might have been a bit better, the opportunity to support such high quality, independent film-making offers additional incentive to invest in this DVD.

2936497,4,B000VDDDUU,"""When Nietzsche wept"" is a compelling and smart description about Dr. Joseph Bauer, Sigmund Freud, Lou Andrea Salome and the prolific philosopher. It focuses around the emotional universe of a fractured relationship between Nietzsche and Andrea Salome, according a well planned strategy of Dr. Bauer when he decides to invert the role of patient and doctor. The sharp points of view that happen along the film are worthy of interest all the way through. On the other hand, the admirable stages of Vienna and the custom design are also high peaks into the movie.

I laughed at the montage between Breur and Nietzche, rolled my eyes at the awful computer graphics when the dream sequences showed, and the consistent aghast look on Breur's face is kind of annoying. Nice flanger on the Wagner music. Anyway, I'll finish it and let it be.",1230768000,3,379,4.414285714285715
2936499,5,B000VDDDUU,"I was amazed that I'd never heard of this movie before.  It was recommended to me by my daughter's PhD professor, and it is a fascinating look at a man whose name is in the subconscious of many, but a man who is still an enigma to most.  I think I need to watch it about a half dozen more times because of all the little nuances in the film, but  I am really unhappy that this movie didn't grab for Armand Assante the Oscar he deserves.  He is a tremendous talent, and really absorbs the character of Nietzsche here.  I seem to remember one character in the movie who didn't seem to fit - maybe it was the actor who played Freud, who found it a bigger challenge than he could handle.  But this is on my must see again, must keep list.",1227916800,3,734,4.0625
2936500,4,B000VDDDUU,"At first I was confused why this movie has received so many negative reviews and upon contemplation see that it is a definite aquired taste.  It is an independant film in every sense of the word.  I love independant films when the director goes out on a limb and does not follow previously established formulas.  That is indeed what this film encompasses.

This is a daring interpretation of 2 people who came to become very important in the world and psychoanalysis as we know it.  The film expertly displays the period in which it takes place down to the scenery and lovely costumes.  The acting is unique but once it grabs you you see that the whole style of the film is done with an intent purpose.

The relationship that develops between Breur and Nietzsche is the basis of the film and I find the acting on both parts outstanding, especially Armand Assante.  He lights up the screen with a presence that makes you feel you are watching Nietsche himself.

The film incorporates actual events and the director's interpretation of dreams both characters had.  Some may find these silly but they are not.  They are displayed otherworldly as dreams are.  I must admit I loved seeing how psychoanalysis/therapy originated.  The history of mental health and how it is treated is fascinating.

For me this film had a totally engrossing story expertly told with emotion and originality.  The acting is excellent as well.  I highly recommend this film.  Even if after viewing you find it was not to your taste it is worth viewing for it is an expertly done independant film.  When done so well it will definitely be controversial in its impact as this is.

Watch and form your own opinion.",1218931200,6,1685,4.708904109589041
2936501,4,B000VDDDUU,"First of all, this movie was probably not meant as a deep study on Nietzsche, or psychoanalysis for that matter. It was probably not produced to vindicate any highly sophisticated theory about the meaning of Nietzsche's or Freud's ideas. (Note that I have not read Yalom's book, so I can't compare...) But it does a fairly good job at representing what one familiar with Nietzsche's biography and works easily imagines Nietzsche might have been like. On that account, Armand Assante does an incredible job--one that I would not have expected from him after his role in ""Strip-Tease"" (my last memory of him). His performance alone makes this movie worth watching at least once for anyone who has been intimate enough with the name of Nietzsche. 3 stars.

Second of all, this movie gets an extra star from me because this is the first ""serious"" fictional representation I have seen on film (and found, miraculously, at Blockbuster!) of the kind of topic it involves--let alone, the first ""serious"" english-speaking representation of Nietzsche as a central character. The movie makes a good faith attempt at really being about the feverish and even destabilizing intellectual-emotional encounters that (let's assume or pretend) gave rise to psychoanalysis, or that we associate with Nietzsche. Other than that, it is true that this movie often seems, in terms of cinematic nuts and bolts, poorly put together. But original, daring projects of its kind are still to be encouraged. Only then perhaps could they multiply, evolve, and ""progress."" Until then, we should not hold them to unrealistic standards.",1203638400,3,1601,5.157692307692308
