6963751,5,B00S7XCLI6,He is the embodiment of music.  You can see and feel his heart.  The music moved through him as much as the dancers he was with.  It was gorgeous and so very beautiful.,1441670400,,168,4.03030303030303
6963752,4,B00S7XCLI6,"Good idea to have a pianist on stage but there are times when the video focus on the pianist instead of the dancers at crucial parts which can be distracting. But those are, thankfully, few. They should instead place a picture-in-picture at a corner of the video, so we can have the best of both worlds. Dancers were great and well-executed.",1440892800,6,341,4.60655737704918
6963753,5,B00S7XCLI6,"A DVD/Blue Ray worth of collecting.  Lang Lang is wonderful here.  The dancers are excellent.  Some of the pieces are exquisitely beautiful, such  as ""Waltz No. 19 in A minor op. posth."" with Joseph Walsh, and the ""Ballade No. 1"" with Derek Dunn and other dancers, and also several other pieces.",1432857600,2,295,4.7254901960784315

Awesome performance by Katherine Precourt :)
A must to own by all HB patrons.",1510704000,,114,4.75
8697537,1,B00S7XCLI6,"The 1 Star is for the project. Lang Lang plays well, jovial as usual and deserves 5 stars. The Houston dancers are well choreographed, and danced generally well, and deserve at least 3 or 4 starts. But there isn't any purpose to put them together on the same stage, a total disaster. Those who want to listen to Lang Lang will be much better off if it was simply a piano concert without the dancers' distraction. Houston dancers would have been better off with recorded music, without Lang Lang's domination of the stage. There is no synergy to put them together on one stage. I would not dare discourage the experiment to have them a joint performance like this with live audience. But when it is quite obvious such an experiment is a failure, they should not put out a Blu-ray disappointing many fans.",1501977600,,803,4.583333333333333

8697542,3,B00S7XCLI6,"A mixed result.  The music is, of course, very nice.  The dancing was quite nice.  I would like to have a dvd of just the dance, unobstructed. All too often here the dancing was blocked by pictures of the piano and Lang Lang playing.  I expect he required that, but it could have been handled better to allow viewing of the dancing.",1457222400,5,332,4.306451612903226
