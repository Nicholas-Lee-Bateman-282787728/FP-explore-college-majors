2521102,5,B000EHSVIM,"Modern Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) is a hybrid sport where fighters train in both striking (usually a combination of techniques from boxing, Muay Thai, and Taekwondo) and grappling (Brazilian Jiujitsu and wrestling). A thick rulebook exists that prohibits such attacks as biting, hair pulling, eye gouging, hitting to the groan, kneeing/elbowing a ""downed"" opponent, etc... Even clothing is regulated, with padded gloves and mouthpieces required to minimize damage.

That, however, is not how it used to be. In the ""old days"" of ultimate fighting, martial artists from completely different spheres of combat would come together in no-holds barred battles of complete domination. There were no weight limits, You might see a huge sumo wrestler battle a karate master or a boxer trying to punch out a ninja. You couldn't be disqualified for biting (though you could be fined), hair-pulling was legal, and punching to the groin happened all the time. During this ""iron age"" of MMA, fighters battled to answer the age-old question of which martial arts style was the most powerful - and ""hybrid"" martial artists were almost non-existant.

UFC 3 is the epitomy of this age, and one of the best MMA tournaments you will ever watch. MMA legends like Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock are at the top of their games during this event, and matches that would NEVER happen in modern times (such as the legendary sumo vs. kenpo karate fight where the cage is broken during a sumo-slam) are common-place. While the very last match is a bit of a let-down, almost every single one before it is high-intensity combat that will make your jaw drop. If you want to see what true ultimate fighting is all about, this is THE DVD to purchase.",1171756800,2,1713,4.923875432525952
2521103,5,B000EHSVIM,"This DVD of UFC 3 is a historically great one because it marks the first UFC event to be won by someone other than Royce Gracie but also the only 8 man tournament to be won by an alternate. The matches are your classic old school UFC brawls for the most part, with the finesse of Ken Shamrock and Royce Gracie throw in there.

  The fights are all good, starting with Emmanuel Yarbrough (600 lbs) vs Keith Hackney (200 lbs). This event also debuts Kimo, the first man to expose Royce's weaknesses in the octagon by pounding him so much in his match that after Royce beat him and moved in, Royce could not continue in the tournament. You will also see many entertaining personalities, which the UFC always supplied back then. Aside from Kimo and his manager, Joe Son, we also get Roland Payne who breaks bricks on his shins and Harold Howard, a Canadian Karateka who is not all their in the head.

  Buy this UFC event if you are a fan of the old school UFC or just want to compare it to the events of today. They are not the most technical matches but they are still very exciting.",1170892800,,1081,4.300492610837439
2521104,4,B000EHSVIM,"Of the four ""UFC Classic"" dvd's released to date, this is the only one that I can't rate 5 stars. With the two biggest names out due to injury (Gracie & Shamrock) we are left with alternates. Yes, they do step in and fight, but they are not the caliber of those injured.

This is still an entertaining DVD, but without the big names, it isn't quite up to par with the others in the series.

Keith Hackney is a fun fighter to watch (whatever happened to him anyway?) and Kimo's fight with Royce was Gracie's toughest bout of the first 3 UFC's.

If you're a new fan, try one of the other DVD's first to appreciate the talent of Gracie and Shamrock. But if you're already a fan, this is well worth buying.",1153785600,6,702,4.223880597014926
2521105,5,B000EHSVIM,"One of the most underated toughest octagon fighters was Keith The Buzz Saw Hackney, this gives you a glimpse into his character and power with his first dismantling of a 400 pound beast from the east (n.y.)  He never won the whole thing, but ufc 3&4 which gives you a classic battle between him and the greasest ever Mr. Gracie is well worth the price of admission, i can't wait to get these classics on DVD.",1143590400,7,408,4.368421052631579

Charlotte, NC

The UFC got progressively more professional with each event.  UFC 3 - ""The American Dream"" was decent, but the main event was quite uninteresting, as an alternate had to step in for the final fight.  The true talent suffered injuries in victory that prevented them from meeting in the finals (Defending 2-time champion Royce Gracie & shoot-fighter Ken Shamrock).

We do, however, get our first look at Kimo Leopoldo.  He is indeed a strange and eccentric character - and he gives Gracie his best fight in UFC competition to that point.

Aside from this standout matchup, there is some decent action and some rather humorous characters.  It took some fighters a while to realize that they weren't in the WWF and that they didn't need a gimmick in order to compete - but as I've said, the UFC was still growing and taking form.

This DVD is worth owning for the history...",1143072000,8,904,4.707006369426751
2521107,5,B000EHSVIM,"For the first time I am writing a review of a DVD before its release. I am very excited about the release of this event on DVD because it was the first UFC event that I ever watched. Out of all of the classic UFC shows early on, this one is my favorite. The stage was set with 650+ pound Manny Yarborough (Sumo) taking on 200 pound Keith Hackney (Karate). Needless to say I was INSTANTLY hooked to this sport.

The entire card was interesting (with the exception of the main event). Royce Gracie had what was easily his most exciting fight in the octagon when he took on a rather spooky looking Kimo. Man, this is a wonderful bit of history to own. Buy this as soon as it hits the store shelves!!",1142553600,4,696,4.1940298507462686

8110281,5,B000EHSVIM,"Kimo is so silly. Had the fight been on the street, he'd be on the floor with -- at minimum -- a broken arm. Royse would have stumbled away, but been whole.

These old UFC events are just fun to watch. Clearly not the sophistication we see today in MMA, but fun nonetheless.",1501545600,,274,4.169811320754717

8110285,4,B000EHSVIM,"Ahh, UFC #3, the event that I will forever remember as ""The Fat Guy Beatdown.""
The glory days, the olden days, the pre-rule gladiatorial times when matches were made based upon the man and the heart, but not the skill and the weight class.  There was something romantic about it all back then, despite the burgeoning sport's relative lack of highly skilled talent.

Going into this competition, it was pretty clear that Ken Shamrock and Royce Gracie were the men to beat.  The most memorable fight, however, was Keith Hackney versus 600lb. Emmanuel Yarborough.  The disparity in size was ridiculous, and it was the great unknown in matchups like this that made the original UFC events so appealing.  In very short time viewers realized the old axiom, ""The bigger they are the harder they fall"" is quite true, as Hackney landed a shot that dropped Yarborough on his rotund behind.  After recovering, the quarter-ton fighter shoved Hackney through the octagon fence, something I'd never seen before.  Eventually, however, the man whose body resembled a giant M&M found out that one has to have SOME fighting skill to beat the early days toughmen of the UFC.

The only headliner fight was Royce Gracie taking on tattooed challenger Kimo Leopoldo.  Eventually succumbing to Gracie's superior BJJ, it was Leopoldo that fatigued Gracie enough that he later withdrew, and showed the world that there was, indeed, a chink in the Brazilian's armor.

Ultimately this was a very disappointing UFC because the top two fighters withdrew due to injury/fatigue, and the third best fighter (Leopoldo) got gypped by bracketing.  When a nobody like Steve Jennum can get gifted a late replacement into the FINALS, you know there is a problem.  When his opponent (Harold Howard) looks like an extra in a B-rated biker movie and attempts the most ridiculous move in fighting history - just picture someone doing a front flip and landing on their back without making contact with anything or anyone else - then you know the problems are huge.  This was still during the infancy of the UFC and they soon learned that balance was necessary in order for scheduling to combat fighter fatigue.",1282780800,2,2166,4.933884297520661
8110286,5,B000EHSVIM,"As I review this , I gain more respect for the men and UFC. that Being said  Kimo Leopoldo Debut impressive. Leopoldo  carrying the huge cross to ring side I admit was shocking...All so the Rematch between  Gracie and Shamrock fans had to wait for, both men couldn't continue after their one round matches.

Any UFC fan will enjoy this DVD and add it to their collection.",1249516800,,371,4.492537313432836
8110287,4,B000EHSVIM,"UFC 3 comes to us from Charlotte, North Carolina and features the return of Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock, and the debut of Kimo Leopoldo.  Everyone anticipated a return bout of Gracie vs Shamrock in the Final, but alas injuries would not allow this to happen.  UFC 3 also returns to the original format of 8 fighters in the 1st round, with the winners progressing onward.  Once again, there is an interesting mix of fighters squared off against each other with their respective martial arts disciplines on display.

  1st Round Matchups:

1. 6'8"" 616 pd Emmanuel Yarbrough (Sumo) vs Keith Hackney (Kempo Kung Fu)

2. Ken Shamrock (Shootfighting) vs Christophe Leininger (Judo)

3. Roland Payne (Muy Thai) vs Harold Howard (Karate)

4. Royce Gracie (Jiu-Jitsu) vs Kimo Leopoldo (Tae Kwon Do)

  The 1st round fights lasted a bit longer than some of the fights in the first 2 UFC's.  The best fight for me was Gracie vs Kimo.  Kimo was very tough, and Gracie's most difficult opponent to date.  Also, once again we have a huge Sumo fighter taking on a karate expert, and the outcome is to be expected.  As mentioned in other reviews, the Final is disappointing, as several fighters were injured in their fights, and unable to continue.

  Overall, this DVD does not have as great of fights as the 1st 2 UFC's, but it still provides plenty of knockouts and submissions for the UFC fan!",1220400000,,1383,4.707112970711297
8110288,5,B000EHSVIM,"UFC Classics, Vol. 3 is the UFC that changed my mind about the Gracies.  Watch and you'll see why.

It was another great addition, filled with testosterone and mismatches.  The first bout is scary, a 500 pound man vs. a 200 pound man.  'nuff said.

Kimo vs. Gracie... Kimo became my hero in this DVD.  I thought his ""religious martyr"" gimmick was risky, yet hilarious.  Kicking butt for the Lord.  Magic!

And it seemed to work, as he pushed Gracie hard, bringing about the most disgraceful ending to a match every.  It changed my mind about the Gracies.  Watch and you'll see why I was immensely disappointed in someone who I respected (and still respect).

Modern fans might not appreciate it with the evolution of the sport in the modern day.  But in its time, it was spectacular.",1181088000,,783,4.586956521739131
8110289,5,B000EHSVIM,"Buster Douglas knocking out Mike Tyson?

Red Sox and White Sox winning the World Series in consecutive years?

Phil Mickelson taking a third major?

The band out on the field?

Kids' stuff.  You want bizarre, you want unpredictable, you want oh-my-god-what-the-hell-is-going-on...take a look at UFC 3.

All the elements were in place for a titanic Royce Gracie/Ken Shamrock rematch in the final.  Opposite brackets, each with beatable, untested opponents.  Both principles rested and in good health.  Either they'd face each other, or one would get toppled in an incredible upset, and we've have a brand new rivalry on our hands.  It had to happen.  Right?

It starts out reasonably enough.  Keith Hackney, a scrappy little bulldog from the mean streets of Chicago, takes on the gargantuan but immobile and clumsy Emmanuel Yarborough, with predictable results.  Next, Shamrock grapples with veteran judo fighter Cristophe Leninger, who gives a valiant match.  Then Canadian trash-talking pummeller Harold Howard trades punches with hometown hero Roland Payne, an action-packed slugfest with a suitably spectacular conclusion.

And then things get weird.

No one could've predicted this.  But then, isn't that the beauty of sports?  Who would've thought that the script would go off the rails so suddenly.  And that Steve Jennum would have to step up to save the day.  (Steve who?  You'll see...)

UFC was pitched as a completely real contest.  In the third tournament, it was almost too much so.  That's what makes it a must-see.",1174780800,2,1529,5.2190082644628095
