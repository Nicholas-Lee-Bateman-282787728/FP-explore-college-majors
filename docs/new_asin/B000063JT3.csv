7959284,3,B000063JT3,"This is a very well done video questioning the moral values and ethics we live by in this country - the problem I had with it is was what was the purpose of this series? It left me feeling wrong, in despair and with a sense of apathy about making any kind of difference in the world. If the purpose of this series was to promote transformation, change or any shift in consciousness other than identifiying one way of viewing the world, it failed.",1119225600,2,446,4.321428571428571
7959285,5,B000063JT3,"I first saw A CRISIS OF FAITH on public access television.  I only caught part of the program but was completely captured by the obvious honesty of the message.  I immediately found and purchased the video. The visual effects, music, and trance-inducing commentary work together to provide a very pleasant viewing experience.  On a philosophical level, this is one of the most realistic films I have ever seen.  The theme of this film will touch you deep inside.  I did not see this film as a total condemnation of our society but rather a statement on the problems that our society tends to ignore.  It suggests that as a people, we at the very least change our social priorities.",1055203200,7,681,4.680672268907563
7959286,5,B000063JT3,"I just saw ""A Crisis Of Faith"" on the Manhattan Neighborhood Network public access channel. I sat riveted to the screen for the entire hour, not believing such an intelligent, honest program could be on television, let alone on public access. I heard what has been in my heart for such a long time, thoughts on our society and spirituality that I have everyday working and living in Manhattan. I have ordered the video, as I want my own copy of this exemplary documentary. Thank you for caring enough to tell the truth.",1040428800,6,519,4.591397849462366
7959287,5,B000063JT3,"""Crisis of Faith: An American Dilemma"" is both disturbing and exciting.  It touches the place inside me that has felt schizophrenic living as a person of faith in today's world.  This is a lonely time to know the possibility of spiritual transformation, to know the power of forgiveness and contemplation (both personally and globally) but to hear little alternative to ""God Bless America"" in my church and in society.  This video is beautiful and haunting, and speaks powerfully to both this crisis of faith and to the transformative power of the journey.
  I have watched this video with several groups.  It always stirs the pot and opens up sharing and questions.  In addition, for many of us, it speaks what we have felt and experienced but been unable to adequately express in words.",1018396800,3,788,4.879699248120301
