4607710,1,B0058YPIF0,"Dialogue paraphrase from parenthood season 3 Episode 11, ""Missing"" is missing a reality check.  This script is 100% Hollywood.

In this reviewer's humble opinion (ITRHO) the family's total self righteous over reaction when ""Max"" who is at least 13 or 14 years old by season 3 (he was 11 in season 1?) dares to go out on his very own by his own self on public transit without a BABYsitter.  (Barf, how is he supposed to GROW UP? OR IS HE?) In this televised melodrama for instant download and oooh....aaah....he's...AUTISTIC.  First of all, down one star for not having closed captions, amazon.com, shame, shame.

Okay, so back to ""Max.""  Max is ""AUTISTIC"" (the new catchall for does not fit in...used to be ADHD, before that it was ""geek,"" ""retard"" before that it was ""contaminated,"" See ""Glee"" for more....)

So, back to ""Max.""  Max the AUTISTIC nevertheless manages to get to downtown Oakland from somewhere in N. Berkeley Hills by himself on MUNI buses and BART.  He asks nothing, other than polite directions to the museum, looks like he was headed to the Exploratorium.

Dax (not his real name to protect privacy) went there when he was 4.  He got bored with it by the time he was 6, whereupon we began going to the San Jose version of the Exploratorium a slightly more high tech place...The Tech? I remember parking was easier in San Jose.

So, back to ""Max,"" the TV character, who at 14 wanted to go to The Exploratorium, a place where Dax, my son, (not his real name to protect his privacy) got bored when he was 6.  We are asked to believe that the yuppie parents freak out because this 14 year old boy goes missing for about 30 minutes in the middle of the day.  We are further asked to believe that Berkeley PD would do something about it within 30 minutes.  Then we are asked to believe that Oakland PD actually found a quiet unassuming independent tall Caucasian young man who looks to be about 18 with long hair, knows where he is going, is not bothering anyone and even has a map on him,somehow managed to communicate this to Berkeley PD in the same AFTERNOON and before dark that day brought him home to N. Berkeley just ""to protect and serve.""  This is total Hollyweird.  There is not a snowball's chance in hell of this actually happening in real life.

Then we are asked to listen to ""dad"" reassure all the female characters that their ""feelings"" are ""valid."" Barf and more barf.  Who appointed Berkeley men the curators of Berkeley womens' feelings? Who decided THE MEN would validate the WOMEN's emotion? And why is it the men always nervously tell the women calm down, even when the women always appear to be calmer than the men? What real Berkeley woman would tolerate such condescension? Who raised these people?!

I thought Jackie Gleason on The Honeymooners was more honest, actually.

Why do all the women cry and why do all the scenes confuse yelling with ""communication?""  Why is it ""autistic"" to ask, ""does she get in trouble for yelling?"" (if I get in trouble for sneaking out).  Who decided that someone has to be blamed for everything that happens? Who decided that all teenagers must be ""controlled"" ""labeled"" and ""accounted for?""  Where did ALL this GUILT come from? And what does it have to do with real life? Why should ""Max"" care? Why shouldn't he be self-centered? He's a teenager!  Why is big sister blaming him for her choice, which has been wheel spinning, worrying, nail biting and whining, which has nothing to do with Max? And why is his behavior considered to be ""autistic?!"" makes perfect sense to me, he wants to go to the museum, he's expressed it verbally, he's been ignored, he's got a map, he's a teenager, so what harm is there in GOING? It's initative! He was not hurt.  Yes, he could have sent a text or left a voicemail, but then, sister should be punished for yelling, I say.  Since when is focus, single-mindedness, independent problem solving and initiative to be punished?  Are the parents not more ""emotionally disturbed"" than the teen, here?

Do writers intend a twisted pun or is the whole premise...twisted? I thought not, when I lived in Berkeley, California, but five years after leaving, it seems pretty twisted...compared to anywhere else, USA. If you strongly identify with this script...MOVE!

so...i'm sure the writer of this episode never met the writer of this review..ahem formerly of Berkeley, with a son named Dax...who is not autstic but...i've been accused of autism...why, oh why does it have to be a dis-ease, when ""Max"" functions more sanely,more adaptively, less intrusively than anyone else?!",1323907200,,4575,4.718238993710692

I am not usually emotional when watching tv but this tugged at my heartstrings and rubbing away some tears on occasion.  Laughter is spread out throughout including sarcasm aplenty.  Esp Sarahs' relationship with her daughter Amber which was so realistic.  Also Craig T Nelson as patriarch of family is noteworthy.",1425081600,,417,5.17910447761194

I enjoyed watching seasons 1-4. However, because there was a week between watching when it originally aired I hadn't noticed that not a single episode plays without SOMEONE crying, lol! When I became aware of it I rolled my eyes, oh brother, here we go! Then made a game of it waiting for the tears. Sure enough, every episode!!
I was, however, bummed when I got to season 5 and found that Amazon Prime charges for each episode. So now seasons 5 & 6 are sitting in my watch list waiting for them to age into included in Amazon Prime status. Ugh!",1425081600,,720,4.340740740740741

the dialogue between characters is so stupid and unnatural. also - where do these unemployed, underemployed and foreclosed upon people get all their money for these lavish parties and everything their kids want? sorta strange - and again, unrealistic.",1404000000,,720,4.722222222222222

4610571,5,B0058YPIF0,"""Parenthood, Seasons 1-3""
. . . .

I had started watching ""Parenthood"" when it first broadcast in 2010, but got distracted by another show - ""The Wire,"" perhaps? - and it fell off my radar after the first few weeks. Recently while hitting a lull in my binge-watching, I heard a glowing review on NPR of the series, which praised the ensemble cast and mentioned that the series had been created by producer Jason Katims, who was also the creative force behind the ""Friday Night Lights"" series. That got my attention.  So, I decided to go for it, and delve into ""Parenthood"" as well.

Having just finished Season 1-3, I am definitely hooked, though there are a few minor details that keep getting in the way.

The show is generally pretty strong... Although new plot elements are sometimes introduced with a slightly forced feel (""Haddie will now have a black boyfriend. Amber will develop an Attitude Problem."") and are often dropped rather quickly (""Things are OK now."") Probably this is more a reflection of the difference between writing for a weekly TV audience, as opposed to viewers who binge-watch entire seasons on DVD - three weeks as opposed to three hours makes a big difference in how story arcs play out, and whether they ""feel real"" or not.

Overall, though, the show is remarkable for its depth and honesty in exploring an amazing range of topics, showing a frankness about the difficulties of parenting, of negotiating sexuality and romance at a variety of ages, and about mental health and disability issues such as substance abuse and autism, all dealt with with a frankness that is surprising for network TV.  Even with its occasional dramatic flaws, the show has a profound authenticity: like many viewers, my wife and I often found ourselves nodding and saying, ""yep! that happened to us!""

A universal theme among the large cast is of discovering and re-shaping one's identity, an issue that comes up at every age on a variety of fronts: teenagers test boundaries and take risks, parents set boundaries and often make mistakes, retired couples find that old issues still need to be ironed out, and can put even seemingly rock-solid relationships at risk. For each character new choices come up constantly, challenging established self-images and social roles. The ramifications of ""parenthood"" are explored in every generation, on a variety of levels: the youngest children innocently mirror their parents while teenage siblings are constantly in conflict with these same parents and struggle to establish their own autonomy, while the four grown-up siblings in the Braverman family are perpetually tested by parental responsibilities, and even by their relationships to their own parents. Meanwhile, Grandma and Grandpa have their own roles to play for all these children and grandchildren, and even their own issues with their own parents. (In one poignant episode, the family patriarch, played by Craig T. Nelson, agonizes about his need to connect emotionally with his own distant, disapproving 86-year old mother: it never stops, really.)

My criticisms mostly have to do with the show's choice of locale: supposedly this is all taking place in Berkeley, California, a city I am quite familiar with. Why Jason Katims decided to place the show there is a little mysterious, given his apparent lack of knowledge about the town. To start with, ""Parenthood"" is constantly geographically challenged when it comes to Berkeley and the Bay Area: one night the teenagers sneak out to go to a fraternity party ""across the Bay,"" which is ridiculous, since all the frat houses are here in Berkeley, not in SF or Marin. Likewise in another early episode, one kids' parents have to drive to Fremont (which is like fifteen miles away, all horrible freeway driving) to pick up a birthday cake, which is nuts since there are dozens of great bakeries in Berkeley itself, a town that is possibly the food snob capitol of America. (The long drive was just a plot device to get the parents out of the party scenes...) Visually it's all wrong as well: the show is not actually filmed in Berkeley, and characters frequently refer to locations that don't exist, such as ""the corner of College and 8th"" while exterior shots -- street scenes, houses -- almost always look like LA. (On occasion you can spot LA landmarks in the background, such as the Caioti pizza restaurant in Laurel Village... Likewise, there are frequent scenes of busy intersections with strip-mall backgrounds that you simply don't see in NIMBY-centric, no-growth Berkeley.)

Of course, that's all small-ball nitpicking to most viewers - the differences between urban planning in Northern California vs. Southern California don't mean much to viewers in Iowa, but the show also has a big problem thematically. ""Berkeley"" is often used as a pop-culture shorthand for something ""weird"" or alterna and totally out of the mainstream, for ethnic diversity and political activism.  But there is very little in ""Parenthood"" that merits such a distinction. Yeah, there are two interracial couples and one family has a kid with Aspergers, but it's not like that stuff isn't happening pretty much everywhere in America anyway.

Meanwhile, in supposedly wacky, alterna Berkeley, we see practically no people of color other than the two African-American love interests. A couple of Asian-Americans have cameos as teachers or school parents, one Latino guy who works in a warehouse semi-dates one of the Braverman sisters, but vanishes after a couple of episodes. In Season Three we finally have one Latina woman with depth emerge - a pregnant, working-class teenager who offers to let one of the couples adopt her baby -- but her character is semi-stereotyped and meanwhile no Latinos or Asian-American professionals seem to be in the Braverman orbit. Really? This big, hip Berkeley family and they don't have *any* friends who are people of color, other than the two black people they fall in love with? For real?

Of these two love interests, the character of Jasmine, played by Joy Bryant, is by far the strongest: she emerges as a fully-formed, multi-dimensional person, fluent and comfortable in both ""black"" and ""white"" culture, and seems like a completely authentic, realistic, contemporary Bay Area person. Jasmine exists as an unapologetic equal to the other characters in the predominantly white cast and she's never given any stupid, forced, stereotypical issues that revolve around her race -- she doesn't preach about race issues, she doesn't have a drug problem or a chip on her shoulder about anything, she doesn't go through any of the same-old tiresome motions of black-culture-as-seen-by-Hollywood.  It's very refreshing.

In contrast, the kid-from-the-hood Alex, as played by Michael B. Jordan (an alumnus of ""Friday Night Lights"") is disappointing. He dates the high-school aged Haddie, and while their courtship provides a foil for the questionable overreactions of Haddie's parents, the relationship goes nowhere. Alex is a big bundle of troubles -- though amazingly polite and a perfect gentleman, he is economically disadvantaged, a recovering alcoholic, and so morally pure and self-sacrificing that he finally breaks up with Haddie rather than drag her down with his own real-world worries, just as she's just starting out on her own life. Their relationship had glimmers of great potential - it would have been so cool if the writers just made it work out, rather than have it turn into some big over-the-top melodrama, but the show's producers weren't able to hit that particular note of restraint. Oh, well.

Finally, I have a big, big, big problem with the fact that, having finished the third season, we still haven't seen one single gay or lesbian character on the whole show, not even a random gay parent at any of the public and private schools the various Braverman kids attend. ""Oh, but this is a show about parenting,"" some may say. ""Why would you have gay characters on a show like that?""  Um, hello?  2014 calling. Not all parents are heterosexual. Your show is supposedly set in Berkeley. This is your big chance to ""be Berkeley"": there are nothing BUT gay parents in Berkeley, California. So where are they on ""Parenthood?"" Seriously: WTF?

Overall, though, this is an excellent series which explores a wide range of contemporary family issues, and though the orientation is pretty lily-white and upper-ish middle-class, many of the themes are fairly universal and may strike a chord with a wide range of viewers. In particular, the portrayal of Max, an adolescent boy with Asperger's syndrome, is a breakthrough for mainstream television, and may be a comfort to families coping with various kinds of autism or other behavioral spectrum disabilities. Max's diagnosis was a central focus of Season One, and slips in and out of focus in S2 and S3. While the writers could probably hammer it home a little bit more, they don't shy away from the very real and very difficult issues at hand.

Producer Jason Katim's child apparently has Aspergers, so there are scene here that will ring true because they are true: I think these may resonate mostly with families that have similar issues. While I understand the impulse to underplay some of the heartbreaking dysfunctions in order to make the show ""play"" better for a mainstream audience, I think ultimately it might be stronger dramatically to show even more of Max's problems. This is particularly true of his outbursts and tantrums, a problem that has more to do with neurology (wiring) than with ""bad parenting"" which is what folks on the outside often think is happening. Still, seeing these issues portrayed realistically on network TV is pretty profound, and remains one of the elements that makes ""Parenthood"" stand out. Also, there are lots of great performances, with my personal favorites being actors Joy Bryant, Bonnie Bedelia, Sam Jaeger, Mae Whitman, Tina Lifford, Max Burkholder and Jason Ritter, pretty much in that order. And Craig T. Russell's performance as the grandad is also a nice surprise. It's a good show - if you're on the fence, check it out.

This is the type of series designed for the whole family to watch together. It's a very realistic portrayal of a California family, along with all of the ups and downs of everyday life. It's very easy to relate to the situations that the characters find themselves in and it's emotional yet funny at the same time.

Recently unemployed, Adam and his wife Kristina (Monica Potter) have just learned they expecting a midlife pregnancy. Meanwhile, their teenage daughter Haddie is getting more serious with her first real boyfriend, Alex - who is not of their race and never finished high school - while adolescent Max, who has Asperger's syndrome, is struggling to mainstream in a regular school.

Unable to produce a biological sibling for their daughter Sydney, Julia and her husband Joel (Sam Jaeger) are looking into adoption, which becomes a much more difficult and stressful venture than either dreamed.

Single mom Sarah is struggling to deal with daughter Amber's newfound independence after graduating high school. She also continues to date Mark Cyr (Jason Ritter), who is her son Drew's English teacher, making for much awkwardness.

Finally, Crosby talks his brother Adam into starting a new business venture - something that, given his current life situation, Kristina is less than thrilled about. Also a single dad, Crosby works hard at keeping involved in his son Jabbar's life, even when his ex Jasmine has a new man who seems just about perfect.

As always, there is never a dull moment among the Bravermans. Yet whatever happens, one thing is always clear - along with their parents Zeek (Craig T. Nelson) and Camille (Bonnie Bedelia), they will also be there for one another, full of laughter, tears, hope and happiness.",1397433600,,1690,5.175824175824176

4610843,5,B0058YPIF0,"I grew up in a family that rarely saw cousins. Before Grandma died (when I was 11), we'd see that set of cousins twice a year, and though we lived closer to the other grandma, we spent about as little time with those cousins as the distant ones.

This family, though they have their problems, are there in each other's lives, and support each other. Yes, there are dysfunctions. Too many of the siblings depend on the oldest brother, Adam, to bail them out of their troubles, so much so that it affected his work in an earlier season.

We see growth in their lives, even as we see events that we have all seen in our lives. Sometimes, I feel as if the writers are looking over m shoulder. (Oh, there you are???)

Max (actor and character name) does such a great job of playing a boy with Asperger's, a type of high functioning autism. He is finally starting to come to grips with his different mind in Season Three.

Do the kids disappoint their parents? Yes, but that's true in life. The kids also make their parents proud. That's in life also.

There's so much I could say, but I do highly recommend this series. If I didn't get it free as part of Amazon Prime, I'd have had to try to find another way to catch up on all the episodes I missed when I had to share a tv with friends (and they didn't care as much for Parenthood as I did).

TEN STARS and worth every one hundred of them.

Only complain was after the baby was born, that episode. They didn't show how the baby affected Max's schedule. They just had everyone so busy. Then Christina went back to work. With the family dynamics why wasn't Camille or someone else in the family over helping after the birth. That would seem natural in that kind of family. But they had other story lines they pursued.

There were quite a few tear-jerkers this season. When a show can get me to cry, I know its good. The acting on this show is top-notch. The only negative comment I would like to make, is that I wish the show was kept a little cleaner. It seems like the sex life of each character was highlighted a bit too much and I really did NOT like the two teenagers having sex. Its better to just have it insinuated, rather than actually showing them rolling around in the sheets.",1390348800,,641,4.219512195121951

But it is a series everyone should watch for so, so many reasons.  One is entertainment value, second it leaves you with so much to think about and the rest are for those moments that are created between the writers, the actors and the directors that bring so many emotions to the surface.

Kudos to the producers for being so wise to keep material like this on television.  Too bad others are so quick to jump the gun and cancel other fine shows for not having time to develop an audience.  Studio 60 comes to mind as does Eli Stone.",1389398400,,710,4.222222222222222

4611213,2,B0058YPIF0,"Peter Krause appears to be having an influence over many of his fellow actors, writers, directors too. But it is, of course mutual. The arger reflex, strident tone and talking over seems like a stylistic choice by writers/directors. They're all finding their way and it's not really working for me. Highlights are Mae Whitman, Craig T Nelson, Bonnie Bedelia, Erika Christensen, Sam Jaeger, among many others. But there's this mutual influencing that took a bad turn out of the gate and went over the high side on the second lap or so. Season four is finally getting loose from the formula of reflex dishonesty, leading to painful reconciliation that became almost unbearable and unwatchable. Big Up the music supervisors, though. Great choices!",1388534400,,744,5.10655737704918

4611349,4,B0058YPIF0,"My wife and I really like Parenthood. It deals with real issues that upper middle class Americans with children face. It is serious and funny, and the Crosby (Dax Shepard) character is hilarious. The characters have good chemistry, and anyone who has kids from elementary school to college will relate to some aspect of the show. I would give it 5 stars, except I dislike how the writers drop plot lines whenever it is convienent. Zeke has financial troubles in season 1, dropped (funny thing on this one, the writers could have wrapped it up, but didn't). [SPOLILER ALERT] Haddie has an alcoholic boyfriend, dropped; she seems to forget all about him. I was shocked when season 4 started and Crosby wasn't back on the boat and Jasmine gone without explanation. This would be an amazing show if they just watched their plot lines a little closer.",1381104000,,846,4.761904761904762

4611358,5,B0058YPIF0,"I got this DVD via Amazon prime, which came more quickly than the regular two weeks. I began watching Parenthood during season three, this is when the writing and acting comes together forming a style of TV that's heartwarming, heart wrenching, relative, contemporary, and engaging. This is the best show on TV in family sitcoms because of all the talent and the culmination of writing and acting. I have seen a few earlier episodes in which the show is getting on its feet and isn't set in its way. I wrote a similar review of Season Four which just came off the air. It's a great TV show in the family genre, and better than past shows like Everybody Loves Raymond. Characters are relate able and engaging. All aspects of TV are found on this show. If you've seen any of the promos on NBC or anywhere else definitely check it out. Parenthood returns to NBC Thursdays September 26th at 8pm.",1378425600,,891,4.540372670807454

I am not sure how she makes any money by being a writer, and all about having a new baby was a bit too much.

4611440,5,B0058YPIF0,"Normally, I hesitate to rate TV shows, since everyone's tastes are different--what's great for one may be torture for another (don't get me started on the Great Grey's Anatomy Divide that exists in my home).  This show, however, is one that I just cannot say enough about, to everyone I meet.  I was somehow unaware of this show until a few months ago, when I started watching it on Prime.  Through three seasons, everything from the acting, to the story lines, down even to the soundtrack, have left me stunned. You know how every show seems to have one cast member that's just awful, and you cringe all through their scenes and just figure that they're related to someone in Production?  Yeah, this show doesn't have one of those.  The acting is stellar from every character, minor or major.  This season in particular brought the emotional heat--and as the parent of a child with autism, I can say that its depiction and portrayal are very accurate, which is not something that can be said for ANY other show I've seen (the vast majority of other shows, in fact, make me cringe).  This season made me laugh, cry and WORRY for the characters--sometimes all at once. While most television productions go downhill as seasons go by, that is not the case with Parenthood.  It just keeps getting better and better.",1373068800,,1311,4.6943231441048034

4611550,2,B0058YPIF0,"I really liked Season 1 and 2 of Parenthood -- the characters were interesting and unpredictable. The writers made some attempt to represent the diversity of life with story lines about homelessness, alcohol addiction, teenage sex, interracial heterosexual relationships, etc. But Season 3 just imploded into a traditional, right-wing ""stand by your man"" stance when Jasmine decides, for no apparent reason, to drop this gorgeous, successful, responsible doctor who loves her son, for Crosby, who has been unfaithful to her. Please. Don't we see enough bogus messages that men can screw around and women will be (should be?) tolerant and forgiving? The script is more a reflection of a male fantasy rather than a depiction of a decision made by a strong, independent woman like Jasmine. Then, rather than protect his niece and condemn dishonesty and deceit, Crosby blames Amber for sleeping with a musician who doesn't tell her he already has a girlfriend. It is, somehow Amber's fault that he lies. The whole season ended like a misogynistic cautionary tale. Really too bad.",1366934400,,1075,5.183908045977011
4611551,2,B0058YPIF0,"The music is awesome. The kids are always right, or at least have sane motives, while parents bumble around like idiots until you want to yell at them. I hope the screenwriters get paid double.  It must be a lot of work to have four people talking at once through the whole show. But like in a soap opera, you start caring about the characters and then you're hooked. My wife and I will probably be watching it (and yelling at it) for a long time to come.",1366761600,5,455,4.170454545454546

4611607,5,B0058YPIF0,"This show is so real that I get angry with some of the characters just like I would get mad at a real person.  And like real people, I like some of the characters very much and others not so much.  I of course love Adam and Crosby, but I think Amber is my favorite character.  Sara makes me so insane, I would go crazy if she were my sister.  She always expects others to do for her and doesn't give much back, just like life is in a real family!  Jasmine also gets me upset, and it makes me so mad that she never took any responsibility for how poorly she treated Crosby in the first season (or was that the 2nd season?)  I also get annoyed with what they let Max get away with.  I understand his issues, but it shouldn't give him license to act the way he does, but even that part of the plot is realistic, parents feeling like they need to over compensate for a child with issues.

I really like that the characters are so multi-dimensional and realistic. Most of them are very likable, but a few not so much. This group of characters seem so much like a real family I sometimes have to remind myself they're acting!",1365206400,,1119,4.148148148148148

4611610,5,B0058YPIF0,In the way of sitcoms/dramas this show has got it all. It's realistically unrealistic but has a nice presentation and a little something for every modern family. It's kind of addictive though - they always end the episode in such a way that you HAVE to watch the next one.,1365033600,,272,4.46
4611611,5,B0058YPIF0,"When I first started watching the series - I was a bit shocked at some of the content of the episodes, until I realized we are looking at real life.  Being 70, I've seen a bit of it myself.  The actors are fantastic - love each one of them.  I started watching the series because of Lauren Graham..................she was so good in ""The Gilmore Girls"" and is just as wonderful in this series.

4611639,5,B0058YPIF0,"Every character in this show has taught me something about life that I can apply to my own.  I love the family dynamics, although Zeke and Camille's relationship is kind of foggy to me.  Apparently they love each other and they are the foundation that allows their offspring and their offspring's extended families to stumble, fall and sometimes even totally lose their way.  At the core they are family.  For me it is inspirational.  And humorous - one of the funniest scenes for me was Adam walking down the street trying to look ""hip hop,""  sidesplitting for me!

I am looking forward to a fifth season for sure, and hopefully beyond that!

It is full of heartwarming moments as well as funny with witty dialogue and unbelievably well written. After seeing seasons one and two I couldn't wait to see season three and it was everything I thought it would be. You will recognize some of the actors from other shows (Six Feet Under, Coach, Gilmore Girls, etc) and they are cast perfectly. Do not hesitate to buy this season and the other two for they are well worth it.  If I like a show I often go back months later and watch it all over again and this was one of those series.

4611880,4,B0058YPIF0,"It is hard to like anyone (Character-wise) on this show with the exception of Joel and Kristina. Everybody is always lying, there is rampant infidelity, and people are generally too busy interjecting themselves into each other's business, that their own problems become neglected and boil over.  Yes, I realize these people are all characters in a television show, but it is the experience - the sense of being connected to the characters - that draws you in.  There are elements of a great show here, but they are so saturated; there are too many things happening at once.  If you took one characters problems and spread them out amongst the rest, it would still be too much.

Critique of the show aside, the actors are outstanding.  Lauren Graham and Peter Klause are so believable, and the dynamic between each individual family does not feel forced.  I think the actors do a great job telling the story and keep the show interesting.",1355097600,,937,4.788819875776397

4611907,5,B0058YPIF0,"I disagree with the other reviewer.  He/she is too harsh.  This series has many different characters and the writers obviously did a great deal of homework to develop characters and their reactions to situations such as a missing child or a hurt wrist, such as what happened in this episode.  I am enjoying the way these characters interact in 45 minutes.  Real?  Sort of.  In real life, it would take an extremely long time for someone to confess their feelings.  The writers make real feelings show in less than an hour.  Autism reality?  The autistic spectrum is a wide spectrum.  There are all types of Asperger's kids.  The show isn't just about Max and his asperger's, anyway.  It has it's place among other important parts.  The sibling reaction to having a brother or sister on the spectrum is also varied, but certainly stressful, such as what is shown and talked about in this episode.  This episode is also filled with other meaningful and interesting character interactions.  The writers also seem to bring in birth order among the brothers and sisters.  So far, I have enjoyed this series very much.  Thank you.",1350172800,,1124,4.801047120418848

4611910,3,B0058YPIF0,"While I basically enjoyed seasons 1 & 2, but by season 3 I've grown very tired of how the family CONSTANTLY talks over each other instead of to/with each other.

I'm also ticked at how Sarah became so stupid as to even consider making a baby with this guy she's only been dating for a few months. (Their relationship is boring and lacks chemistry.) Sarah isn't even thinking about marriage, just a baby. And to top it off she's contemplating picking up and moving to NY with this guy when her son graduates HS... like she's just going to up and leave him on his own at that point. She doesn't even know if he'll be going to college (and she certainly can't even afford to send him to community college). And she wouldn't ask her dad to take care of them while she flits away with this new guy... She's always been a mom whose kids were everything to her but in this season her son is seriously upset at the idea that his mom is even thinking about having another baby - another ""family"" etc. and it doesn't really seem to ""register"" with her. It's like she's taking the attitude of ""oh well, he's just a sensitive kid - but he's almost through HS so I don't need to care about him at this point, just me - which is not at all who her character is.

I don't know, it's like the writers took a big hit on the head and forgot who their characters are. (Fortunately, the writers come to their senses in the final episode of the season - but getting there was rough, and there's still the thing with them talking over each other going forward...hopefully that tones down some).

The acting is superior to most family dramas and the reality of the situations is one of its key strengths. It is a fresh break from all the sex and violence found on most shows and it is a nice way to spend some time with a strong realistic family each week. It is reminiscent of the best episodes of ""Brothers & Sisters,"" which also had some strong times as a show. Hurrah!",1347926400,,490,4.061855670103093

Met him yet, let alone allow you to go on a ... the cost of a trip because of the studio's expenses ... TO REMODEL YOUR STUPID STUDIO AGAIN ...

Was that an annoying mishmash of a paragraph containing interrupted parts of a conversation that vaguely seemed to be on the same topic and involving the same people? If that aggravated you, you will likely find Parenthood in general, and season 3 in particular, to be most annoying, for the same reason. You see, the producers in the first season thought it was clever to have the characters sometimes interrupt each other and by the third season, it seems that they decided that this style of dialog had to become a mainstay of the series.  Pretty much every conversation on this show devolves into a mess of interruptions and multiple characters talking at the same time, with everyone trying to speak over, under, and on top of everyone else. I find it ridiculous because while people do interrupt each other during normal casual conversations, they don't do it constantly and don't do it in such a nearly incomprehensible cacophony all at the same time, with no one paying attention to what anyone else is saying and everyone just talking at once. Clearly the director and/or producer thinks this is some sort of amazingly realistic and clever way to depict a family, but no family or group of people I've ever met does this on any sort of regular basis and if it does start to sound like this, someone shouts ""STOP!  We can't all talk at once.""

I know there are people who are huge fans of this show who absolutely love it and are inclined to dismiss any criticism of their favorite television program, but please - go watch 15 minutes of this show and I guarantee that if you are an honest person, you will concede that this point is accurate and these talking-all-over-each-other dialogs occur all the time on this show.  My spouse had the 9/18/12 episode on last night for about 15 minutes and I saw two examples of it in that timeframe.  Certainly there are some people out there who would not mind this sort of dialog, but I find it to be unrealistic and an annoying pseudo-creative affectation of the director/producer of the show.

OK, I could probably forgive the artificially scripted conversations where everyone talks at the same time, if only the various plots and subplots weren't so contrived.  I guess I saw this show quite a bit differently than all of the 5-star reviewers gushing about how ""realistic"" these series portrays families.  The stories here didn't strike me as realistic, they struck me as forced and artificial, the product of peppy, enthusiastic screenwriters gathered around a table, all babbling intently ""Guys, let's come up with some REALLY REALISTIC family issues for this show! [but let's not make it too gritty]""  Truly great television immerses you in the story, leaving you fascinated about what is coming next, with events following each other naturally and seamlessly.  The stories in this series drudge onward toward inevitably happy resolutions, always seeming as if they were scripted.  So we have the sort of middle-to-upper-middle-class households that we are all comfortable watching, we have some minor financial crises, but they all resolve without a problem. As the plots emerge, one can see the screenwriters all agreeing ""Of course we have to have a teenage daughter dating a seeming bad-boy.  Oh, we need to have a mid-life crisis, that's a must.  And let's not forget a jealous wife, plus you gotta have work demands pulling parents away from their families.  What other issues are there for parents?  Oh, I know, how about a couple who can't become parents - infertility!  And - oooh! Oooh! How about we have them planning to adopt an infant, but we'll have the birth mother changing her mind about giving up the kid after our protagonists paid thousands for her medical bills!  What's a parent's worst nightmare?  Right, a developmentally disabled child.  But let's not have a Down Syndrome kid, nothing messy or icky - we'll have it be a less severe mental disorder - I know, Asperger Syndrome!  That way we can still have the kid be cute and quirky and lovable!""  No teen pregnancies, no drug or alcohol problems (except with a very peripheral ex-husband who appears for a few episodes and then disappears), no bullying, very little that's not safe, sanitized and/or a minor hill to climb.  The ""bad boy"" character, Crosby, is just a youthful spirit who loves women, loves love, and is slow to grow up, but without a nasty thought in his head.

Great dialog develops the characters, sounds like what a real person would say (or should say) and advances the story.  Parenthood's dialog often sounds to me to be obviously written by a screenwriter.  When the characters aren't talking over each other, if they have more than a few words to say, they often come out sounding like soliloquies.

This isn't a horrible show.  The acting is, by-and-large, decent, the people are pleasant-looking, and they do have mostly distinct characters (the teen girls seem to be pretty much the same character, though). It's just that, with a suburban setting and no thrills, criminal syndicates, horrors, raunchy humor, etc..., it needs an edge and I just don't see one with this show.

Ultimately, this series is the television equivalent of Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill album or a chain Mexican restaurant.  It seems to be spicy, racy and cutting-edge, but really it's just safe, comfortable, digestible for the masses, more commercial than authentic.",1347753600,5,5825,4.7844311377245505

I really loved the relationship between Sarah and Mark and thought the return of Seth was handled perfectly.  Adam and Kristina's new addition to the family made for some warm and charming moments.  I'm a big fan of Jabbar, and was happy to see some great things happen for his family at the end of the season.  Julia and Joel's desire to have another child was a poignant (and sometimes heart-breaking) journey.  The Bravermans are perfectly flawed, and the amount of heart the possess make this show a must-see.  I have been a fan from day one!

4611992,4,B0058YPIF0,"This is a good series, as usual, good, plots (if a little bit didactic in spots), directing and acting. The last episode had lovely resolutions Except: the two brothers, in business together, refuse the $millions offered for the business. It makes no sense and, further, it is acted poorly, with little or no reactions from other family members and a saintly, self-satisfied look on the face of the older brother, who selflessly gives up the millions in favor of his baby brother's love and in aid of his dream -- even though older bro has three children, including a baby and whose wife has gotten a job when she should have been with her three-month old baby. (no one mentions the baby's needs, just that she has 'been put into day-care').
Giving up the money for a seemingly spoiled younger son, who, in fact, doesn't put much work into getting clients, when older bro needs it desperately, makes no sense and is irritating.

The role of Hattie is very limited this time and the actor sometimes seems to be relying on her own shtick. She knows how to be fresh and interesting but doesn't muster it much and her limited lines don't help her.

My original comment, while I was waiting forever for it to arrive:
It is unconscionable to hold dvds so long after tv presentation. One's enthusiasm turns from faded to outright antipathy.

And charging approximately double a reasonable rate is simply arrogant and greedy. Some families and individuals may love some series, including Parenthood, but simply cannot afford to buy it any more.

The value of a series' production is unrelated to the charge demanded for its dvds. Parenthood has worn out its welcome.",1336694400,3,1658,4.7665505226480835

4611994,5,B0058YPIF0,I love the characters in Parenthood.  I heard that it was not going to come back and I think the way they ended it was good in that case.  This was a great ensemble casting and I'm sorry to see it go!!  We definitely need more family-oriented shows like this.,1334534400,2,259,4.14
4611995,5,B0058YPIF0,"I only started watching Parenthood because Lauren Graham, one of my favorite TV actors (from her days on Gilmore Girls) was in it. The show's storyline which is based on the Braverman family, explores the dynamics of being part of a large extended family, single parenting, teen angst, and marital difficulties. Also, this is one of the few shows on television that explores what it is like to have a special needs child. The storyline each week is interesting, keeps viewers engaged, and the acting by the ensemble cast has grown from strength to strength.

Craig T. Nelson plays Zeke, the patriarch of the Braverman clan, who is married to sweet and gentle Camille (Bonnie Bedelia). The couple have four adult children - Adam (Peter Krause, one of my favorite actors in this show), Sarah (Lauren Graham), Erika Christensen (Julia), and Crosby (Dax Shepard). Adam is a senior executive at a shoe manufacturing company and is married to housewife Kristina (Monica Potter) and they have a teenage daughter and a young son. Sarah is the 'problem child' who married young, moved away, and then gets divorced and moves back into her parents' home with her two teenage children, Amber (Mae Whitman) and Drew. Sarah has her own set of problems - can't seem to find a job that really brings out her potential, isn't sure what exactly she's meant to do, and her teenage daughter Amber is quite a handful in this first season. Then there's high achiever Julia, who is a hot-shot attorney, married to a building contractor turned stay-at-home dad, Joel Graham (Sam Yaeger), and they have a precocious young daughter. Finally, the youngest in the family is carefree, wild child Crosby who matures through the series, from an irresponsible, anything goes guy to a caring, responsible father and hardworking entrepreneur.

In the third season of Parenthood, Sarah turns 40, and when her romance with a much younger guy takes off, she begins to ask herself some serious questions. Things get a bit complicated when her ex, Seth turns up, in bad shape and desperately in need of help. In the meantime, Amber moves out on her own and tries to make her own living, but finds that living in the real world is not as easy as she had envisioned. Drew finds romance but his grades also begin to suffer.

Adam and Kristina face many new challenges this season - their son Max is now attending a regular public school, but finds it difficult coping with the changes, and his social awkwardness affects his relationship with his peers; Haddie faces her own problems; and Adam and Kristina's marriage undergoes a rough patch.

Julia and Joel sign on to adopt the baby of a  pregnant girl who sells coffee at Julia's office, but inevitably complications arise with heartbreaking results. And Crosby becomes seriously concerned when Jasmine's romance with Jabbar's pediatrician takes off and he feels threatened that Jabbar will transfer his affections over to the new guy.

The stories play out well, and mostly don't come across as contrived. The ensemble cast does a wonderful job, especially Nelson, Bedelia, Krause, Graham, and Potter. It is such a refreshing change from all the trashy reality TV that passes off as TV programming these days. I'm still a fan after three seasons, and look forward to another great season with the Bravermans.",1325894400,6,3320,4.898576512455516
