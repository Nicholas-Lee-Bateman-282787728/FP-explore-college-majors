5528685,4,B00AYNG9B2,"This is actually a routine police procedural plot-wise, but inside is an outstanding motorcycle cop movie from the early 50's. Many of the actors were not doubled in the riding scenes and many (especialy Keenan Wynn) appear to really know what they're doing. This product arrived ahead of schedule and was a gift (which was great). Thanks Amazon.",1393718400,,346,4.982758620689655

5528688,3,B00AYNG9B2,"The scenes of motorcycles hurtling across the screen are fun.  The story, well, it is nothing to think about.  The big asset is  the appearance of Elaine Stewart.  No matter how minor her role, this beautiful actress knew how to make something out of nothing. Ralph Meeker is good, as is expected.  But the film relies on those motorcycles and the amazing loveliness of Elaine Stewart.  Too bad she was not given the kind of chances that could have catapulted her to major importance.  I met her once... as nice as she was lovely.  and who can forget her standing at the top of the stairs, glaring down at Lana and Kirk in 'The Bad and The Beautiful'. Even her bit in 'Sky Full of Moon' is worth seeking out, though the film solidly belongs to Carleton Carpenter and Jan Sterling. Where is 'Hajji Baba'?  Maybe it is a specious hunk of lush color and silly plot, but Elaine is right in the middle of it all.",1370563200,7,907,4.383233532934132

8559286,4,B00AYNG9B2,"I just saw this movie with my husband, on TCM for the first time, and I really enjoyed it.  Ralph Meeker was pretty funny in this movie with his bragging.  And, the parts were funny with his boss trying to cut his ego down to size.  I would recommended this movie as being very good.  And I would also recommended seeing Ralph Meeker and Carol Baker in 'Something Wild,' another good movie.",1505865600,,390,4.375

Trivia (IMDB):
The art on the cover of the Warner Brothers Archive Collection dvd shows Ralph Meeker laying next to Elaine Stewart in a bathing suit. In the movie, it is James Craig who is next to Stewart in this scene. Meeker is in a canoe with his girlfriend. This art may be from an original lobby card for this movie or maybe was created specifically for the dvd box art.",1420243200,,1249,4.985576923076923
