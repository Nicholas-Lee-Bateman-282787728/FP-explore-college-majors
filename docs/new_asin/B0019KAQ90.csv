8274269,5,B0019KAQ90,"This documentary holds back little.  The video is graphic.  It discusses the history and some of the causes as well as the politics within Rwanda, around Rwanda and at the UN and USA.  This puts the results of genocide right in front of you.",1391904000,,241,4.431818181818182
8274270,5,B0019KAQ90,"I have watched the video (DVD) no fewer than 3 times. This is not because of any pleasantries it holds, for surely nothing about those tragic events can be pleasant. Watching it more than once was to make sure any detail missed in one viewing would be caught in another viewing. The sheer evil of what took place in Rwanda, as retold by eye witnesses (and even perpetrators as well)is unspeakable beyond words. The narration is very good and compliments the scenes as you watch the video. The video capitulates and exposes the darkest most depraved side of human nature. This video is not for the faint of heart, because the graphic images (and accounts) are not from a fictional Hollywood script, but rather the real life images and accounts of a period in modern human history that MUST NEVER BE FORGOTTEN NOR REPEATED. Nevertheless, it is worth watching, not only for the educational aspect ...[because yes, there are lessons to be learned from this] ...but also to serve as a reminder and memorial of those who suffered.

8274271,4,B0019KAQ90,"""Do Scars Ever Fade?"" This film was very well done.  It helps to understand what it was like for the people who were divided into tribes.  Hutus and Tutsies",1353283200,2,156,4.344827586206897
8274272,5,B0019KAQ90,"I will be honest, this movie contains graphic images and material.  But it is something we should open our eyes and minds to it.  Again, I will not give away spoilers, because this is a must-see for audiences interested in world events, knowing they affect us in many ways we don't know about or understand.  I will say the message I got from the film was one of hope and forgiveness.  Hope for better futures and healing, and forgiveness to the suspected who have returned to the country.  Don't turn away from what you hear or see-all you have to do is watch it for a while and go on with your life.  For the people in the documentary, they can't turn away or turn it off.  They live it everyday.",1337126400,2,698,4.282442748091603
8274273,5,B0019KAQ90,"An excellent and thought provoking story.  18 years later, I still ask ""How could this happen""?  ""Why did the USA and other nations let it  happen""?  We need to be constantly reminded of the horror, but we also need to look for ways to help reconcile the differences.  We need to personally face evil and say ""NO"" this will not happen.",1335484800,2,335,4.426229508196721
8274274,5,B0019KAQ90,This documentary is powerful! It goes step by step explaining what led to the horrific actions in Rwanda. I had my thirteen year old watch this for a lesson on genocide I was giving him over the Summer... he was a little confused as a lot of information is given within 1 hr... but understood the basis and that was the most important for me.,1312848000,5,342,4.276923076923077
8274275,5,B0019KAQ90,"This video provides an awesome look at the genocide in Rwanda.  How can the survivors live with those that committed the atrocities?  This documentary is very well done, and it is gripping!",1273968000,5,189,4.875
8274276,5,B0019KAQ90,This product is a well documented view of the peoples involved in the most fervocious genocide known in history.,1168300800,9,112,4.947368421052632
