But I bought it anyways, and watched it with low expectations.  Sure enough, the movie swept me away.  The main character overwhelmed me with his beauty, and his desperate need to find his direction in life.  He was rejected, lost, alone, and trying to find meaning.  A lot of people are in the same mess.  I am very close to this state, so I can appreciate the movie.  Many people that gave this movie negative reviews, can't imagine the feeling, nor can they associate with this movie, and gave it a negative review.  So, in the end, what do they know?  The movie allowed me to associate myself with his past life and his feelings.  I felt for him.  The music, ""Barcelona"" by RLMDL, was so dreamy, and perfect for this movie.  It added to the movie, and I give the song writers and producers credit, for allowing the music to support the movie.  That is a positive star for the movie, and, as it should be.  It takes everything to make the movie what it is, not just good acting, or a good story line, but everything.  Don't go entirely by the negative reviews.  Watch it for yourself, and judge it accordingly.  The movie is worth giving it a chance.  I loved it, and rate it 6 out of 5 stars.  I related to this movie so deeply.  People that already have established lives, will find it hard to relate.  And thus, the negative reviews.  Simply because they don't understand what it is like to be so lost in this life.  pity, that they don't understand, and a deep lack of compassion and understanding.  Movie is highly recommended.",1495670400,,1670,4.432343234323432

8738382,2,B0178YSM78,"I am not sure whether it was the acting or the story that really made this movie drone on. First the lead character of Evan as played by Harry Hains came across as a pampered little puppy dog who felt the world owed him something and did not take any pleasure in life at all. He is living with his boyfriend Chris (Nicholas Macdonald) and truly does not appreciate the life his boyfriend is providing for him as he goes to school. He is really one very spoiled and vapid kid. he finds an 8 MM camera at a garage sale and buys it from the elderly man and the man says come back for the editing equipment. he goes back and the man has passed but his 42 year old son starts to spend time with him. Once again Evan puts himself above all and moves in with Peter. All and all, I was just not interested in Evan and just could not get into his whole, I didn't have parents and am looking for that now thing.",1484870400,,901,4.039106145251397

8738384,1,B0178YSM78,"Just finished watching ""The Surface"" released by Ariztical Entertainment.
""The Surface"" could have been a penetrating look at one young man's attempt to find himself after being kicked around from one foster home to another.  Instead Evan Jones, played by actor Harry Hains, is a rather self absorbed young man who is not happy with the hand life has dealt him.  Sure, he has a handsome boyfriend who just happens to be rich, and a great circle of friends; but he doesn't have a family he can call his own.  Growing up in one foster home after another has left a hole in his soul that nothing is filling.
So on the way to a party, to buy a gift for a friend, he stops at a yard sale and buys a home movie camera.  The  elderly gentleman who sells it to him offers to teach him how to use it, if he comes back.  When Evan does return, he's startled to find that the elderly man has passed away.  His son, Peter, offers Evan the film editor along with boxes of old 8mm film, and soon Evan becomes obsessed with images of a seemingly happy home life that he never experienced as a child.
Evan is soon hired as a gardener by Peter and the two eventually begin a romantic relationship with Evan breaking up with his boyfriend to move in.  Yet all is not well.  Evan, who finds solace in swimming alone in abandoned pools, is still not happy.
""The Surface"" could have been so much more - a great movie about a young man finding himself and his place in the world.  I suspect Evan is never going to be truly happy with someone as evidenced by the ending scene.
Sadly, I can't even say that this movie is an interesting failure.  It tries, but fails.
Not Recommend.

8738385,5,B0178YSM78,"This must be a movie you either love or hate, given the one star review I just saw. I personally thought the story-line was interesting and unusual: an orphan searching for a sense of family as he has no family history of his own whatsoever. It also focuses on relationships - some shallow, some with the prospect of becoming meaningful. I recommend you see the firm for yourself and form your own opinion. I'd certainly watch it again sometime.",1452297600,4,445,4.6455696202531644
