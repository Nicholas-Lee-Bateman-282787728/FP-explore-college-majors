8551683,5,B00AHM8KJO,"I just finished this series with my family.  It is outstanding--both intellectually rigorous and passionate.  Excellent arguments for the existence of God.  I first found out about Spitzer when David Bentley Hart referenced him in ""The Experience of God,"" and have not been let down.  Some of the lectures that are pure philosophy can be a bit dry (I don't know how they could have been otherwise), but they're still edifying.  I have just ordered his ""Emmanuel"" series on the divinity of Jesus.  By the way, I'm Presbyterian (OPC), so this isn't just for Catholics.  From my very humble level of understanding, there's nothing that goes against a reformed or protestant understanding of God.  But, you might want to get someone with a greater depth to verify that it doesn't violate your faith tradition.",1407369600,2,805,4.955223880597015
