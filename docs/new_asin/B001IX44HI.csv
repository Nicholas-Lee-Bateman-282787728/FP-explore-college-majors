8311473,5,B001IX44HI,Paul boils down the nuts and bolts of basic guitar in a simple/non-threatening way. He answers most of the basic questions AND you WILL be able to play the songs he reviews once you have practiced the lessons. He is a clear communicator and he anticipates the questions common to beginners better than most!,1374883200,,307,4.703703703703703
8311474,5,B001IX44HI,"Paul Baloche is a gifted and trained musician and teacher. I've been through most of his teaching DVDs (the ""Music Theory Made Simple"" is, simply, the best overview of musical theory I've ever watched, read, or heard about!).  This beginning guitar DVD starts absolutely on step one - parts and tuning - and leads the student through playing simple songs on through rhythm and alternative chords.

Paul's target audience is the modern worship player, but his presentation is non-sectarian and everyone who has an interest in learning guitar will enjoy his calm but enthusiastic teaching style.

Most highly recommended!",1334534400,,619,5.232323232323233
