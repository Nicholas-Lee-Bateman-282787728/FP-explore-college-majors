7563091,2,B0195N55WU,"<strong>Dead Tone</strong> (Brian Hooks and Deon Taylor, 2007)

Did I really just watch a horror movie introduced by Flavor Flav? I did. Which leads to the question: why did I keep watching it? This question is a lot more interesting, at least to me, and I'm not sure I can come up with a satisfactory answer--but if I do, rest assured that if you're a slasher film fan, you will probably find the answer as relevant as I do.

The movie opens with a bunch of kids whose parents are downstairs partying playing one of those prank-call games that (as all prank-call games do in the movies) ends very badly. Fast- forward a number of years and we have a bunch of college students in the same house deciding to play a prank-call game...

if you've seen half a dozen slasher flicks, that sentence-and-a-half synopsis will tell you everything you need to know about this movie, including the identity of the killer, all the major plot twists, and at least two aspects of the movie's ending. This is because Hooks and Taylor have made one of the most by-the-numbers slasher films I've seen in a very long time; I might as well have said ""if you've seen half a dozen slasher flicks, you've seen <em>Dead Tone</em>"". Which brings us to the ""interesting"" bit: why did I keep watching? Because the film's very derivativeness leads to us being able to define it as safe, in the same way a genre romance novel is safe. You know, going in, exactly what you're going to get. In the romance novel, within a page of a male being introduced, you can type him: he's the hero who will endlessly grate on the heroine's nerves, or he's a bad guy, or he's a supporting character, or he's the Gay Best Friend(TM). Such it is with the formulaic slasher movie. When a bimbo is introduced, she might as well have ""Plant axe here"" tattooed on her forehead. The stoners are going to die. The people who have premarital sex are going to die. (It's kind of amazing that Wes Craven laid out all the rules in <em>Scream</em> and still no one's thought to look to any sort of paradigm shift.) The final girl, whatever sex the ""final girl"" may have, is the first person in a present-day filmed sequence to get a lingering camera shot. Etc. There's an undeniable comfort in switching on a film and knowing exactly what you're going to get, even down to the endearingly terrible acting and barely-competent cinematography (two of the main reasons this flick seems like it could have come straight out of 1985).

In other words, if you're looking for a slasher movie with which to kill time, <em>Dead Tone</em> is just as good a choice as any of a hundred other films of its type. On the other hand, if you're looking for an active, entertaining experience that pushes boundaries and makes you think about slasher film in a new way, this one is best avoided. * ",1335484800,,2823,4.538310412573674
7563092,4,B0195N55WU,"i ordered this movie after seeing the beginning of it on tv, i wanted to see how it ended. it wasn't the greatest movie ive ever seen, but i do like it a lot. lots of silly teenagers doing dumb things, with a few good twists. all in all, i think its worth watching.",1333497600,,265,3.925925925925926

7563094,5,B0195N55WU,"Really, it won't serve you well to think too much about this movie. If you can think of it as a fun teen slasher, then you'll be happy.

There are a couple of inconsistencies, when you think too hard about it. 1) Why would you even want to play a game that killed your parents 10 years ago? 2) How did Sean and Karim get to be good friends? 3) What is the added value of Rutger Hauer in the movie? (none!!!) 4) How is it that the killer can kill a ton of kids at a party and never seemingly get tired?

There is a little bit of a plot twist that does make sense, so I give them kudos on that. But generally, just enjoy the kills. They are fun. And Brian Hooks gives a pretty good performance as Marcus. I am kinda bummed I didn't see Jodie's fictional death. I couldn't wait for her to die.

Happy viewing!",1320451200,,806,3.9937888198757765
7563095,3,B0195N55WU,"Dead Tone (2007) may not be particularly well-written or acted, but at least it mostly delivers in the kill department, as a hooded hatchet wielding killer with at burning desire to spill blood, butchers a group of stupid and annoying college students.  Over the top violence is the film's main attribute, unfortunately it takes nearly an hour for the mayhem to begin.

The story begins with a group of young kids at a sleepover, making prank calls.  Later that evening the phone rings, and a man wearing a mask, bursts into the house wielding an axe, and massacres all the parents.  Homicide detective John Criton (Rutger Hauer) is assigned to the case, which remains unsolved.  Moving forward ten years, a young man is found dead from a hatchet wound to the head.  Criton suspects that the same killer may have struck again, and along with his reluctant partner (Gwendoline Yeo), begins working the case.

We also meet a guy named Marcus (Brian Hooks), who was apparently one of the kids who survived the attack.  Marcus is the inventor of a game called ""Seventy-Five"", where the goal is to make a random call, and then try to keep whoever answers on the line for at least 75 seconds.  He is part of a group of college friends who tag along with a girl named Karina (Jud Taylor), when she is invited by her ex-boyfriend Brandon O'Connell (Jonathan Chase), to a party at a mansion owned by his father.

Despite the past tragedy, the motor-mouthed Marcus is still into playing Seventy-Five, and convinces those at the party to play.  Apparently against impossible odds, once again a psycho killer is prank called, becomes enraged, and threatens to kill everyone in the house.  As he will be reminded later, Marcus doesn't learn from his mistakes, and unconcerned he returns to partying with his girlfriend Anna (Denyce Lawton).  Later that night, a hooded figure (Kyle Turley) with an axe arrives at the house, and begins slicing and dicing party guests.  The carnage starts explosively, but thing come to a halt, when the killer traps Marcus, Katrina, and their friends in Brandon's bedroom.  The survivors are unable to call for help, and after arguing like idiots, they decide to make a break for freedom.  But no matter what they do, death awaits them.

Dead Tone features a few mean twists, and a surprise ending that seems quite appropriate.  The film stumbles by coming to a halt down the stretch, and having too many off-screen kills.  Fortunately the action does pick up, leaving few breathing at the end.  The action and kill scenes are competently executed, and are easily the best things about the film, which purposely avoids nudity.  Not intended to be much more than a slaughterfest, the film is padded with unnecessary scenes, and the plot has almost no credibility.  The dialog is terrible, and in general, the acting is laughably bad.  Few of the characters are likeable, and Rutger Hauer isn't present enough to make much of a difference.  For hardcore slasher fans, Dead Tone may be worth a look for the violent kills, but everyone else may want to pass.",1314921600,,3074,4.7893738140417454
7563096,4,B0195N55WU,"good slasher about a prank call gone wrong. the story starts with kids playing a game of prank calls and they call the wrong person who end up being a crazed psychopath and murders everyone except the kids, years later it starts all over again with the killings, could it be the same person bent on revenge or is it someone else bent on revenge. Its not a bad movie, good acting, good kills, and has a pretty good twist ending. Check it out.",1269734400,2,441,4.261904761904762
7563097,1,B0195N55WU,"Let's be clear about those rave reviews for this: either they're plant reviews or are by ten year olds. This is garbage, pure and simple. I love horror but ""Dead Tone"" is insulting. Someone took ""Scream"" and decided it would be much better if they took out all the humor and played it straight. There's not much actual gore in any sort of interesting or convincing way so you don't have that. There's no nudity so you don't have that. Not a single scene played for laughs but not a real scare either. What is it those people liked about it? Oh, yeah, they liked that someone paid them to give this a good review. Hell, the DVD isn't even anamorphic...in this day and age. A new dvd. WTF? And Flavor Flav's introduction? He shows up and says, ""I'm the Timekeeper"" and walks off. Literally, that's it. There's nothing about this that makes it worth any one's time.",1269561600,4,862,4.462025316455696
7563098,2,B0195N55WU,"This movie was actually a lot of fun, if poorly acted at times. If you're looking for something in the slasher genre, you could do a lot worse than this one. Great for killing a couple of hours on a lazy afternoon - especially if you have bills to pay or laundry to fold. It's a perfect brain-candy accompaniment to that kind of a day.",1269043200,,335,4.1692307692307695
7563099,4,B0195N55WU,"When I ordered this movie from Fios on Demand I had nothing to go on but blind faith.
It payed off. This was quite a suspenseful gory little Slasher with an interesting storyline.

Brian Hooks was the lead in the cast of good young twenty something actors. Rutger Hauer also stars as a detective on a mission.
I had seen Brian in several urban comedy's and liked them but was a bit skeptical when he was part of production on this slasher film.

What happens is years earlier some kids play a game called 75 where you have to keep a stranger on the phone for 75 seconds without them laughing or hanging up. You have to pitch something scary or stupid, anything to keep them on the line. Well a psycho intercepts one of the calls and comes to the home and murders all the adults during a party and one of the kids sees his parents butchered in front of him..now it's 10 years later and the kids are grown and having a party in a mansion so they decide to play 75 again.

One of the 20 somethings forget to dial *67 before one of the calls and mayhem and murder begin in the shape of an axe welding maniac wearing a parka. It was somewhat your usual slasher fare but there were elements of it that made it seem  fresh. I went ahead and bought it because It's one I will watch more than once. It's low budget but doesn't give you that cheap look,the effects are well done and the lighting is very effective. I say give it a go.",1266537600,3,1424,4.167272727272727
7563100,1,B0195N55WU,"The killer gatecrashes the house party, one of those mind-numbingly boring movie set-ups were no one really looks like they are having any fun at all, he is hardly what you would call stealth like. Smashing through glass, victims running screaming, axe thumping into walls, doors, furniture, you know the sort of thing, this guy seems to WANT people to know where he is. Either that or he has cottoned on to how stupid these kids really are. And boy are they stupid!

Considering all the commotion our anorak-wearing killer (anorak? Urban Legends anybody?) is making, the most you get out of those yet to meet their maker is an irritatingly dumb, `Did you hear that?' What you mean all that screaming and glass shattering, nah, didn't hear a thing !

Other plot details that irk are as follows...would you REALLY play a game of prank telephone calling if the last time you did you saw everyone's parents chopped up? Um, no! And just what are the chances of calling that very same number by chance again and failing to dial *67 prior to making the call AGAIN so the killer now knows your number? This all makes even less sense when the big reveal to who the killer(s) is come the movie's climax.

The plot absurdities pile up right to and including the shock twist, which isn't, and an open ending which just makes for a huge  groan. Rutger Hauer (as Detective John Criton), whom the movie is sold on, is only in it for like five teeny weenie minutes and looks like he just got off a three week bender . Dead Tone is definitely one phone call you'll wanna miss.",1265932800,5,1560,4.501766784452297
7563101,4,B0195N55WU,"Originally titled, SE7ENTY-5IVE, this film is part urban legend - part classic, slasher film.  The kill scenes are intense and full of great FX work.  The film actually has ""suspense"" if you can believe it.  Yes, suspense is finally used in good fashion as well as giving gorehounds what they want, too.  Now, as I have yet to see this re-titled form of the film (it may have a new edit) the only downside the film had when I watched it over a year ago was that I had to think harder about the ending twist than perhaps I should have.  Don't get me wrong...I love a psychological film that makes me think, but in this case it was just a lack of clear understanding in the first viewing.  I had to watch it a second time right away to catch what I missed because it was so quick.  Aside from that one detail, nothing can be said negatively about this film, and it is one I've been patiently waiting to add to my collection...and I am very, very picky.  I'm a filmmaker, author and FX tech, too...so being such a film study and one to focus on story structure, characters you care about, above average dialogue, editing, etc...I am probably pickier than I admit to.

One last thing - for whatever reasons per distribution the filmmakers have finally released this under the Flavor-Flav's Nite Tales moniker.  I think some people will be second-guessing taking a chance on it because that sounds a little out of leftfield.  Well, don't worry about it one bit.  That guy had nothing to do with the film getting made.  In fact, the film was wholly produced by known sports celebrities (seriously), and after researching this information, it was cool to find out they are such avid horror film fans.  They wanted a film to be proud of and made sure the script was worthy in the first place, of course.  I have to agree.  It is more a solid effort into worthy slasher film status than the poor remakes of F13, My Bloody Valentine or either Halloween film.

My name is Duane P. Craig - I don't promote crap - I don't like to waste my time or my money - this film is worthy.",1265587200,9,2065,4.377952755905512
