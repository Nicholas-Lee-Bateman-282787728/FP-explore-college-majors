8488367,5,B005X7HAA8,"I enjoyed the movie - and the gospel group with banjo (I'm searching for their name); I play the same repertoire on my banjo and I believe, the idea for the film-script was influenced by the aim to feature the feelings of ""how you feel if you are sold"" = the subtitle of the book which the little black boy was reading in his bed. ""Amazing Grace"" was in focus too with the lyrics: ""I was blind but now I see"" - I enjoyed the movie very much because the plot introduces various kinds of slavery: to be adopted (I was adopted too), to suffer under kids with sado-maso games; to live in a false marriage etc. - the gospel group, appearing like an ancient Greek chorus, was the frame of this statement of existentialism: ending in the decision to run away...",1411776000,,754,4.316901408450704
8488368,2,B005X7HAA8,Would say to others watch it but do not expect a very lively performance. Bit drab and slow. But will keep in my collection.,1379894400,,124,4.208333333333333
8488369,4,B005X7HAA8,"I agree with several of the other reviewers who expressed some confusion about the intent of this film.  Perhaps the problem comes somewhat with the translation of the title, which, in Norwegian, is more like ""Insanely Happy.""  Then there is the really strange presence of the barbershop quartet, four clean cut white guys in suits, singing American gospel type songs in a snappy way.  Maybe they are supposed to be a sort of Greek chrous, pointing out the irony of supposed happiness in an unhappy world?  Sort of a throwback to American tv shows of the 50's? Is that it?  Is the film making a comment about the futility of Kaja, the main character, to pretend to be happy, who smiles a lot, even when being abused by her nincompoop husband and bratty child?  Maybe that's what it's supposed to be telling us.

Anyway the scenery is beautiful if you like snow..(I do) and the actors are very good.  The plot is simple and effective: an educated Danish couple rents a house in rural Norway for awhile.  We learn, early on, that it's because the woman has had an affair and this is their way of getting away from that.  She is a lawyer, and they are obviously very liberal as they adopted a child from Africa.  They rent a house from a couple, their same age, with their own son, the same age as the African boy. They are not in the same league as the visitors, as Elisabeth makes plain at some point later in the film. Kaja, the local woman, is very impressed with Elisabeth, whom she sees as very beautiful and self confident and seems to have a perfect life with a perfect huband.  It's an interesting setup and the plot unfolds, a bit predictably but with enough surprises to keep you interested.  If it were not for the presence of the Barbershop Quartet, this would be a simple, effective, quiet drama.

As another reviewer said, this is best seen by fans of Indie films.  I think, personally, it might be most meaningful to Scandinavian audiences.  Something about living for so many months with no sun, gives a different perspective on things.",1344211200,2,2050,4.560109289617486
8488370,5,B005X7HAA8,"I really enjoyed this movie. It has a very original plot, in my opinion. I don't judge movies based on all of the technical aspects, I just rate it based on how much I enjoyed watching it. I loved this movie!",1333411200,,208,4.097560975609756
8488371,4,B005X7HAA8,"In backwoods Norway a young married couple with a son rent their adjoining house to another young family from the city. Everyone discovers something about themselves in this quirky independent entertaining film.

There are a lot of plots taking place at once.
The rural couple has an unhappy marriage and the perky wife Kaja is getting less perky and more horny.
The new couple have moved out to the country when the husband discovered his wife's affair and wanted a change of scenery. They have a black son, possibly adopted but it could also be the mother's from another man.
The rural white child is disturbed from the strained family dynamics and can be bullying and insulting.
The younger quiet black boy is just discovering what it means to be black in a white world.
The new couple and the perky wife join a church chorus as she has always wanted to sing but had been told she had a terrible voice.
There is a male quartet who does American standard musical interludes as a Greek chorus.  (Are they connected with the church choir?)
The two couples interact over dinners and games and secrets and passions are revealed.

The acting is great as is the photography.  There is a great soundtrack.  It almost becomes a quirky comedy but it also almost becomes a darker more unhappy film and this tension continues to the end.  There is a lot of love and finding yourself in this movie and most importantly it treats the audience as well as the screen couples as grown-ups.  The story is about problems but they might yet work out as life moves on.",1333324800,6,1550,4.594202898550725

8488373,4,B005X7HAA8,Enjoyed the story and loved the music.  It was a nice surprise.  It wasn't clear in the description that this was a foreign film with subtitles but it was worth the effort.,1332547200,,172,4.34375
8488374,4,B005X7HAA8,"Potpourri is a mix of stuff with little logical connection amongst the mix. This movie pot revolves around two married couples one of which has moved into a rental house (in isolated Norway) that is next door to it's owners - also a married couple. An incongruous assemblage. The couple that moved in are highly educated with an adopted young African son. The owning couple, less educated, has a son who mercilessly torments the other boy because he's black and withdrawn most likely because he's suddenly with white parents in snowy white Norway. The two couples each have their secrets which, predictably, concerns sex and compassionate understanding thus the movie's tension.  Resolution comes in some surreptitious sex (little is shown). There's no tele or radio but there is some wireless web access. They interact by a few shared dinners followed by awkward after-dinner guessing games.  Singing in the nearby town's choir is the only activity we see outside of the homes but plays an important role.

What's weird, almost comical, is how each person comes to grips with their personal secret - trust, sex, understanding, self-confidence. Even for the adopted boy reading for the first time about how slavery relates to him, then followed by the positive counterpoint of seeing President Obama on the web. Strange, but entertaining, are the frequent random scene breaks where a singing group that look like suited CIA/Matrix types belt out bluesy, gospel, rap songs in English; all the more strange in a Norwegian film.",1329436800,10,1525,5.092
