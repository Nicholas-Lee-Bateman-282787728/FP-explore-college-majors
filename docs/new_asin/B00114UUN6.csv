8311051,4,B00114UUN6,"With the first three episodes providing such slow pacing, there was genuine worry that the series had lost its steam and was finally starting to suffer from the hands of its own early momentum. When the final episode of the volume played out though and I saw how everything came together, my interest in this series instantly returned to its previous heights. With the stories finally starting to come together and the girls on the verge of learning some pretty huge truths, I can't imagine wanting to turn away now. A great way to really get the audience ready for the last few episodes, one can only hope that it does itself justice in the end. Recommended.",1213920000,3,659,4.641025641025641
