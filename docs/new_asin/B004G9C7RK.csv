4372628,5,B004G9C7RK,"On The Double, Wonderman and Court Jester are my 3 top favorites for Danny Kaye's hilarious comedy.  I had a VHS taped version of On The Double from the television that was about 20 years old (low quality and full of commercials and cutoff about halfway) so I am very pleased to get the DVD version.  The only things that would make the DVD release better is special features but I'm not complaining.  Danny Kaye at his best!  Look into his other films such as Five Pennies and White Christmas.  Great, clean entertainment for the whole family.",1304294400,17,544,4.56701030927835
4372629,5,B004G9C7RK,"After the success of his dramatic turn in ""The Five Pennies"", Danny Kaye returned to comedy at the tail end of his film career. Fortunately, ""On The Double"" is probably his last great film, a jaunty WWII intrigue-filled farce about a timid American soldier (Kaye) tapped by the military to serve as a decoy for a famous British Colonel (who's targeted for death by the Nazis) after it's discovered he's a dead ringer for the man. From there, poor Kaye fumbles through his role as the stakes get higher, involving himself in the Colonel's personal entanglements with his lovely but underappreciated wife (Dana Wynter) and amorous chauffeur (Diana Dors). As with Kaye's best films, this one relies on his special gifts for dialect, wordplay & rubber-faced timing. Just watch Kaye as he does his stuff in such hilarious comedy pieces as a military innoculation ceremony; a ""dignified"" ballroom complete with lost contact lenses, a wild Scottish dance, and food fight; and a climactic gag marathon of switching disguises to escape Germany.
Deftly helmed by notable director Mel Shavelson, its songs are supplied by Kaye's wife Sylvia Fine, and rounded out by a fine supporting cast (Wilfred Hyde-White and Jesse ""Lonely Maytag Repairman"" White). As with ""Knock On Wood"", Olive Films did a fine job of presenting this rare Kaye vehicle; the print is in good condition, and the colors vibrant.
Thanks for finally bringing this long-unseen movie to DVD!",1300060800,77,1446,5.054393305439331

4372728,5,B004G9C7RK,"On The Double

Danny Kaye had a long and varied career as an actor, singer, and dancer with stops on the Broadway stage (Lady In The Dark, Let's Face It), radio and television circuit, and Hollywood film (The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, The Court Jester).  At one point, he had his own TV show, The Danny Kaye show, airing on CBS from 1963 to 1967 that won both Emmy and Peabody awards.  He could perform songs with tongue twisting lyrics, many of which were written by his wife; his movie roles often contained plots featuring body doubles and cases of mistaken identity that induce gut busting laughter.  The film under review, On The Double, is one of these.

Kaye plays an enlisted military man with such a gift for impersonation, he's entered into a secret program to impersonate General Laurence McKenzie Smith, who we're told is busy planning the D-Day invasion.  Part of Kaye's comedy is his ability to deliver long lines in one breath: ""How many times have I told you I'm on a sorb free fat free high protein low calorie low cholesterol diet, now what's so difficult about that?""  Other times, in a pantomime routine he becomes, by turn, a German spy, a fighter pilot, a high society matriarch, and a Marlene Dietrich impersonator.

With his ranting, blathering, blustering, and knee jerk idiocy on display in this film, many people with time on their hands are likely to re-discover how good Danny Kaye was at providing slapdash entertainment.  As Cary Grant once said: ""Dying is easy, comedy is hard.""",1310342400,11,1513,4.722433460076045

Plot: Danny Kaye plays an American solider who is good at inpersonations. While playing the part of a well know Genral, he is assigned to continue to play the part to distrack the Nazi agents, who want the Genral for interigation.

Summery:Lots of black humor and Danny Kaye does inpersonations of Winstone Churchell and Hitler. Only one song is sung in this movie. I liked it a lot and I'm sure you will to.",1309910400,,462,4.488095238095238

8428542,3,B004G9C7RK,"One of Danny Kaye's last starring vehicles takes place during WW2 and features him as a double for an important American general targeted for assassination by the Nazis.  He's a cowardly hypochondriac who takes the job to avoid court martial for impersonating an officer, not realizing the danger the assignment will inevitably put him in.

This isn't terrible but it's far from one of Danny Kaye's best comedies.  Considering the WW2 setting and changing tastes by 1961 this movie feels like it was made at least 10 years too late.  Danny Kaye looks pretty old to be playing a soldier and the attempts at slightly racier but still pretty tame humor don't really mesh all that well with Kaye's squeaky clean comic persona.  Fans of the comic actor might find this movie reasonably entertaining but if you aren't already a fan On the Double definitely isn't the place to start.",1495843200,,876,4.8133333333333335
