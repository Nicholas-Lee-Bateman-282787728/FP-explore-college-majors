Whatever process they used to compile this from other DVD's was NOT a good process.  In short, if you are picky enough to demand quality video.  Keep shopping.  If you are simply a loyalist to the Gaither Homecoming genre and only care about the songs -- then you will be happy with this set.",1454889600,,457,4.195402298850575

8595779,5,B00DP7HJ4A,"My parents followed my lead and ditched satellite for a roof antenna.  The only thing that they miss are channels that have shows like The Gaithers.  I bought this for them for Christmas to pass some of the winter and they really enjoy watching them.  They've seen the live show, so they have high expectations - the discs in this set meets them.  I do think that it was price quite high, but at least there's a lot of content.",1394496000,,427,4.3
