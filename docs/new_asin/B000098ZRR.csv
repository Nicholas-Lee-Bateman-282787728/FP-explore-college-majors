1881313,4,B000098ZRR,Love Sherlock stories no matter the star. I especially love the old ones. The sound quality was not so good. My old ears had trouble with all the white noise in the sound track,1388534400,,176,4.205882352941177

1881315,4,B000098ZRR,As one of the very few screen adaptations of The Valley Of fear this is a must for Sherlock Holmes fans.  This movie is true to the original story and Wontner is one of the best early interpreters of the character Sherlock Holmes. The 1935 audio and video quality are pretty good.,1377734400,,280,4.384615384615385

1881318,3,B000098ZRR,"Despite playing a henchman in Arthur Wontner's previous Sherlock Holmes outing The Sign of Four, Roy Emerton turns up again as the principal villain in The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes, a fair adaptation of The Valley of Fear. Like most of the novels, it relies heavily on a prolonged backstory that takes up most of the drama - in this case a thinly disguised retelling of the Molly Maguires with the social politics removed and the melodrama upped - with Holmes absent from much of the drama, but it ticks over pleasantly enough and doesn't outstay its welcome. Leslie Hiscott's direction is more efficient than inspired, though Ian Fleming (no, a different one) makes a better fist of Watson than Hunter, but is still enough of a wolf to spruce himself up before going to console the widow. Sadly the public domain DVD takes a bit of effort: although decent prints do exist on UK TV, every expense has been spared for this DVD release, so don't be surprised if you have to rewind to catch the odd line of dialogue thanks to a noisy soundtrack.",1198886400,3,1044,4.618279569892473
1881319,1,B000098ZRR,"Well, maybe -- it would be difficult to tell, with this DVD transfer...

Any discussion of the artistic merits of ""The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes"" (a 70% faithful, 30% wildly unfaithful adaptation of Conan Doyle's ""The Valley of Fear"") is rendered irrelevant by the breathtakingly horrible picture and sound quality of this DVD.  The picture in some scenes looks like it has been recorded by a camera phone off a computer screen where the film was playing on YouTube, while the soundtrack sounds like a video game machine was in continuous use in the room where it was recorded.  Needless to say, there are no subtitles, nor any special features other than a catalog of other available DVDs.

If the DVD reflects the quality of the best print of ""The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes"" available to the manufacturers, then this important Sherlock Holmes film is in desperate need of a full restoration.  Otherwise, the DVD manufacturers ought to be ashamed of themselves for charging money for this.",1196121600,7,992,4.916167664670659
1881320,5,B000098ZRR,Wonter is my favorite Holmes. I'm very happy that I discovered his films thanks to DVD. Triumph is a classic!,1144972800,,109,4.5
1881321,4,B000098ZRR,"I""m sorry to hear that the transfer that the previous reviewer saw was of such poor quality.  I just finished watching it from the 50 Mystery Classics pack and did not have similar trouble.  I enjoyed the movie very much.  For some reason the people making it felt the need to insert Holmes old nemesis, Professor Moriarty into the plot.  With that exception, I found it to be a reasonably faithfull rendition of Conan Doyle's Valley of Fear, and had a lot of fun watching it.  I had not seen Arthur Wontner playing Holmes before, and find that I enjoy him more than Basil Rathbone.  I also much prefer the rendition of Dr Watson in this series.  As anyone who has read and re-read the stories as I have knows, Watson was not a genius, but he was also not the bumbling fool that was played opposite Rathbone.  Holmes depended on him and his gun to provide usefull service, even while complaining about that fact that Watson's ""little stories""  emphasized the dramatic rather than the deductive, as Holmes would have prefered.  I recomend getting the 50 movie mystery pack for these movies alone, not to mention others that I have found quite enjoyable.  A good time.",1113523200,4,1166,4.611650485436893
1881322,1,B000098ZRR,"This is a film adapation of The Valley Of Fear by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It stars Arthur Wontner as Sherlock Holmes and Ian Fleming as Dr. Watson. Wontner is a very laid back Holmes, which makes sense as it's established at the beginning of the film that he is retiring. It's not a very faithful retelling of the story, but it's watchable enough...well, it would be if the quality of the DVD was better.
Unfortunately the quality of the audio was so poor that it made watching the film almost impossible. This is the worst transfer I have ever seen on DVD. The sound is abysmal...there is a constant warbling noise that distorts the soundtrack all the way through the film. It sounds like the sound was recorded underwater! The picture isn't much better as the contrast is so high that certain scenes are completely washed out which makes following the story extremely difficult.
I have seen this film recently on television and the sound was much better on the print I saw. The picture was an improvement as well. It's also worth noting that there some brief opening establishing shots that are not on the DVD version.
It's a shame that more care wasn't taken with the presentation of this film. This film and others in the series are of great interest to many Sherlock Holmes fans and it would be wonderful if a company who cared what they were doing managed to present restored editions of the Arthur Wontner Sherlock Holmes films on DVD.
If you want to see restored versions of early Sherlock Holmes films, you'd be better off purchasing the Universal Basil Rathbone-Nigel Bruce films on DVD from MPI that are available to order from Amazon. They are available in box sets as well as individually.",1067299200,22,1702,4.657807308970099

1881327,4,B000098ZRR,"Fairly well done Sherlock Holmes movie. I've seen it before,, but under another name, I think. In this story, Sherlock retires to the country, but a note in code intrigues him and brings him out of retirement because he know it was sent by Moriarty. He goes to a castle where it appears the husband has been murdered. He has a brand on his arm and the wife tells quite a story about how he got it. With all the information in hand, Holmes is more excited about the deceased exercising regularly than anything else. Why? It has to do with a dumbbell.

The picture and sound quality of this movie is abysmal, as has been noted by others, though there are probably different prints floating around.  The film appears in different versions by different companies because it's public domain--it was made back when the law required renewing copyrights and they never renewed it.

Contrary to what someone said, the criminals did hire Moriarty in the original story, although it is only revealed in an epilogue (where Moriarty successfully kills Douglas as he flees England on a ship).  Also, his wife was killed and he remarried--his wife is not the same woman from the flashback.  Other than that, and the ending, it is pretty close to the original story.

I'll give this four stars as a movie and 1 for the sound and picture, though your mileage may vary since thie Amazon listing is for a different release.  Usually if one public domain version of a movie is bad quality most of them are.",1424736000,,984,4.719298245614035

7990160,5,B000098ZRR,"Reviewed on its merits and in the context of its time (83 years ago as I type), this film clearly deserves, at the very least, 4 stars.  The acting style and script are dated, of course (duh!), but suit the vehicle, as do the editing, cinematography and direction.  I'll grant you that the print is scratchy - which I personally prefer to the manicured and updated prints that erase all the history, especially those that have been --shudder-- colorized!!  The print quality does not detract from the enjoyment of the film and, in my opinion, the aspect ratio actually adds to it.

AS for some of the 1,2, and 3-star reviews:  this film was released in 1935 dear folks!!  Even if you have no liberal arts, theatre or film history background, the fact that it is now 2018 might encourage you to think about how uneducated you sound when you rate ANY old film by today's standards, even subtly. (You should age so well!)

If you LIKE old movies, this is an oldie and a goodie.  I enjoyed it, and you probably will as well.  If you are planning to review comparing it to filmed murder mysteries made in the last ten years, your opinion will be about as useful as a critique comparing woman's fashion from the 30's to today's super model favs.  Please spare us - and the films.

It is also not a particularly well-considered (or useful) rating to take away stars because the actor playing Sherlock is not Rathbone.  Are you rating the film or ringing in with a vote on the casting all these many years later?  Pay attention to the credits before you hit ""play now"" - it's not like they tricked you with a bait and switch.",1515024000,2,1617,4.459183673469388

7990163,5,B000098ZRR,"The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes, 1935 film

This is based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's ""The Valley of Fear"". Dr. Watson is moving in, Holmes is moving out for his retirement. Professor Moriarity visits to wish him ""a pleasant and permanent retirement"". Moriarity commands respect from his client, and is offered $50,000 for the job (about 10,000). The owner of a house goes downstairs to check the doors and windows. A letter to Holmes has a coded message. ""Something sinister is afoot."" Inspector Lestrade visits with news of a murder at Birlstone Castle. Holmes and Watson go there to investigate. The body of Mr. Douglas has a brand on the arm. The murderer took the wedding ring from Douglas. Lestrade questions the people there. [Does the wife seem sad?] That brand is the mark of the ""Scourers"", a secret society. Widow Douglas tells their history in America.

She met Jack Murdock in America. Ted Bolding didn't like him. Jack hears about the Ancient Order of Freemen, and how the local branch differs from every other town. Jack is there to see McGinty and make his acquaintance. A policeman warns Jack, this makes him acceptable to the others. They plan to work over the local newspaper editor. Councilman McGinty visits him just before the police arrest him. Murdock gets in tight with the Scourers, but he can't leave just yet. The arrival of a Pinkerton Detective causes Jack to leave town quickly. He warns the others and gathers them all into a room for a showdown. There is a big surprise! Birdy Edwards arrives with the police. The gang went to the gallows, Bolding alone got life but later escaped. So ""Mr. & Mrs. Douglas"" fled to another country. So is this case settled? What about the missing dumbbell?

Can an umbrella be used in fishing? Barker and Mrs. Douglas laugh over their behavior. [Suspicious?] Holmes looks into the moat. Watson explains his certainty that Mrs. Douglas and Barker did the murder. The missing dumbbell solves the mystery! The passage of time can be measured by a candle. Recreating the crime exposes the time element and the flaw in their story. At night Holmes resolves the crime by finding a missing person. [This was done better in the book!] Holmes explains his deduction. Then they wait for another visitor. Can Moriarity escape capture? There is a long drop to the moat.

The original story was changed in its details. [This is to attract the audience that read the book.] Doyle heard about this story by talking to the owner of the Pinkerton Detective Agency, and used it to create this long story. If you research the history of the 1876 Coal Wars in the Anthracite region you will learn the real history of this era and the Reading Railroad. This clever story points out how easy it is to jump to a wrong conclusion when you depend on circumstantial evidence. Holmes does not make such mistakes. [Do you wonder how a private detective amassed a great fortune so he could buy a castle in England? Was the hidden agenda of this story and ""A Study in Scarlet"" designed to discourage emigration to America?]",1492992000,,3057,4.7406015037593985
