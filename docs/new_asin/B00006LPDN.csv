7972039,4,B00006LPDN,"Tha Westside is dope!!  It really gives you a close up view of the history of West Coast Hip Hop. For those interested in using Hip Hop to reach and teach youth and young adults I also suggest checking out ""Live Above The Hype: A Hip Hop Life Skills Curriculum."" It includes 20 insightful lessons that initiate in depth self reflection in at risk youth and young adults, with a powerful foreword written by Dr. Michael Eric Dyson! Peace Tha Westside. Well done!",1400544000,,461,4.554216867469879

7972042,3,B00006LPDN,"Going back to the 90's when West Coast rap music ran the airwaves, ""Tha Westside"" takes a look at the days when Death Row and Ruthless were the hottest labels around. Covering many of the major events and turmoils during the rise of the West in the rap game, this movie doesn't have any actual interviews with the stars that it is discussing but it does have commentary from several of their peers as well as never-before-seen video footage of them. With an intro from DJ Quik and words from artists like Crooked I, Kokane, and Tupac's bro, Mopreme, there are a few noticeable names involved with this project. All in all, it's not quite up to par with the much longer and more detailed ""Welcome To Death Row"" documentary though if you liked that, you will probably find some worth in this DVD.",1082851200,7,794,4.520833333333333
7972043,5,B00006LPDN,"this is a real good dvd this is i think the only dvd where you get information about other great rappers like easy e ,nwa, but i also like the documantaire about 2pac,snoop and dre its a real good dvd thats why i give it 5 stars please buy the dvd its worth the money greetz from compton",1062633600,2,287,3.9655172413793105
7972044,3,B00006LPDN,"Look i am the biggest fan of gangsta rap and have all the best rap DVDs out there....(and this is probably the worst)
There is not one interview with the real rappers! There is about 15min worth the money the rest just bores you!

The only rapper that you might know that they interview is kokaine and that is it.......
There is though - about 15mins - of good live footage of tupac rapin outside his car rollin up a joint......
Plus you see some footage of Dre on the piano with the dogg pound and Snoop!
There are 10s of DVDs you should buy first, but if you really like Pac, add this to your collection!
PEACE YOU'll",1052697600,10,619,4.201680672268908
7972045,5,B00006LPDN,"i've rated this cd 5 stars becouse u get information about a couple of rappers and u c never before released material.
the piece of 2pac that u c in here is verry good and everybody say what he or she got to say and they are really realistic and that is what makes this dvd earn 5 stars.",1048636800,3,287,3.8813559322033897
