8515208,3,B007ECF20U,"The set consists of two DVDs, which arrive in paper sleeves, not in a plastic case.

DVD #1 contains 6 tracks:
1) A Family Photo Album {5m 14s}
2) As We Are Faithful {19m 23s}
3) Broadway {1m 11s}
4) From Milk Pail To Pulpit {32m 14s}
5) Historical Documentary {27m 7s}
6) Prohibition {1m 30s}

(The {XXm YYs} are the length of the track in minutes and seconds.)

  1) Still photos of Aimee's family, mostly of her son Rolf McPherson, set to old-timey music. There are no captions, so I had no idea who the photos were of and the image quality is very grainy. After you watch the rest of the DVD, you realize most of the photos shown are of Rolf and his wife, very few of Aimee.
  2) A documentary, mostly about Rolf and the survival of the Foursquare denomination (which Aimee founded) after her death. I'm guessing this segment was produced by the Foursquare denomination and was originally shown only at their churches.
  3) Black & white video and audio of Aimee speaking. This is a newsreel clip, like what used to be shown in movie theaters. Very brief.
  4) From Milk Pail To Pulpit is a recording of Aimee's totally unique voice telling her life story while hand drawn illustrations (still ones, not animation) and a few photos are shown. This was supposed to be over 32 minutes long but on my DVD it cuts off at about 27 minutes. But I doubt anything of much importance was cut off.
  5) Historical Documentary is an interesting and balanced biographic video that seems to have been produced by a local TV station.
  6) Same type of thing as #3, of Sister Aimee speaking on a different subject. Very brief.

DVD #2 contains a repeat of track #4, and nothing else. (Not sure this should be called a ""set"" since the 2nd DVD is a repeat of material in the 1st DVD.) I tried to play this to find out if it contained the entire 32 minutes, but unfortunately mine was cracked and wouldn't play. I'm assuming I cracked it when I stored it in the plastic case I moved it to since I didn't notice a crack when I received it.

The video and audio quality on the entire DVD are pretty poor. However, for me it was still worth the $15 + shipping that I paid. Would it be worth it for someone else? It depends on how much you value the contents (which include things I haven't seen anywhere else), despite the poor quality of the video and audio.",1360022400,,2342,4.334862385321101
