6224828,5,B00HUTB2RY,I have been a fan of fibber and molly since 1984. I first found them on the radio waiting for the cbs radio mystery theater to come on. I was sad to find the other show not on and then found this and was hooked. I have nearly all the fibber and molly's on cd from the radio and wanted the four movies they did. I found this and was so happy to get this. I have a copy of this on vhs from the tv and could not wait for this to come to dvd. I understand that this one is on dvd-r but this should last me a lifetime. I really love the movie here we go again. I has to be one of my favorites. In this it has a part with molly and gale Gordon dancing and let me tell you they dance like no other. One of the funniest parts in her is when Charlie McCarthy is in the ole station wagon and going down an hill backwards and asks the question  how do you signal for a particular turn. It is packed full of laughs and anyone who has someone that enjoyed this radio program should purchase this. I want to purchase this for my dad as he loves them and most of the rest of the older radio shows. This could be a great gift for an older person who was from this generation of time.,1396137600,11,1167,3.802469135802469

6224843,3,B00HUTB2RY,"Putting the First Couple of 79 Wistful Vista into feature films was a terrific idea. But this double feature set has one jewel and one that went a little too far over the top. Which might seem peculiar considering the over-the-top film, ""Here We Go Again,"" featured key players aboard the legendary radio show plus Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy, but the jewel, ""Heavenly Days,"" didn't.

""Here We Go Again"" (1942) could have been a gem but for several sequences and a finale that goes just too far overboard for foolishness, though you'll laugh appropriately at the customary Mr. and Mrs. McGee patter, the pool shooting sequence between Jim Jordan's Fibber McGee and Harold Peary's Gildersleeve, and a few Bergen-McCarthy dialogues. (You may also be slightly jarred at the sight of big, burly Bill Thompson as Wallace Wimple---whom you might have thought, hearing him on radio alone, to be a pint-sized, balding milquetoast.) The plot---in which McGee nemesis Otis Cadwallader (Gale Gordon) tries to work a swindle upon Bergen, selling a stake Wimple's accidental invention by way of McGee's gullibility---had possibilities, but the excessive sight gags (other than The Closet, of course) simply compound the film's awkwardness.

""Heavenly Days"" (1944), by contrast, is a gem even if Jim and Marian Jordan work without their radio cast. (The King's Men, regular singers on the show, have a pleasing cameo as singing soldiers aboard the McGee's train east, but that's the lone radio connection here.) It's a pleasant satire of the little-man-fights-City-Hall (or the U.S. Senate) premise, beginning when a politically well-connected cousin invites them to visit in Washington and picking up further steam when a) the McGees provide an accidental idea to pollster George Gallup and b) McGee dares to flap his yap in the Senate gallery. Most important, it allows the Jordans to do what they do best---their flawlessly-timed dialogue---without excessive sight gags wheeled in to atone for the periodic sound gags of their radio show.

Warner Archive might have served the McGees better to pair ""Heavenly Days"" with 1941's ""Look Who's Laughing,"" which also featured Bergen & McCarthy and much of the McGees' radio cast, but wasn't anywhere near as over-the-top as ""Here We Go Again.""",1419465600,2,2282,5.212534059945504
6224844,5,B00HUTB2RY,this brings back memories the 30's a good way  while away an evening,1417219200,,68,4.230769230769231

6224846,5,B00HUTB2RY,"it's only logical that in the couple decades or so before television, movies headlining radio stars would prove a lucrative subgenre. if nothing else, they provided listeners with faces and mannerisms to go with those ethereal voices. so they were practically guaranteed to turn a profit.
you might interpret from that that they didn't have to be particularly good, or at least particularly distinguished. well, they tended to be B-movies, so certainly there were no Casablancas or Godfathers in the lot. but that doesn't mean effort was never made to make a pleasant diversion out of a given production. first and foremost what any film must have is entertainment value, and B-movies have proven more than capable of that.
it's hard to imagine any film starring Fibber McGee & Molly entirely wasting one's time. Jim Jordan (blustery know-it-all Fibber) and real-life wife Marion (steadying voice-of-reason wife Molly) radiated chemistry, and their radio setting of small-town Wistful Vista - which appeared to be a Mayberry but could sometimes come off more like Monty Python's Flying Circus - was one of radio's most enchanting and alluring venues. their spirited radio sitcom was/is second only to Jack Benny's.
they co-starred twice with ventriloquist Edgar Bergen. to be honest, Bergen isn't quite up to the Jordans' standard. more than one person has pointed out the perversity of a world where someone becomes a successful ventriloquist on radio, but it was certainly an edge in Bergen's case. he was only so good at it, and his chin visible wobbles more than once. (indeed, by the '70s he'd given up even trying to keep his mouth shut.) that aside, Bergen does have a knack for imbuing his characters - wily conartist ""son"" Charlie McCarthy and nave hayseed Mortimer Snerd - with enough dimension to make them seem to be alive. and the brand of humor for which he demonstrated them is nicely interchangeable with the style of the McGees. so however overrated Edgar Bergen might be, the element he brings works out pretty well.
the one featured here is the second of their collaborations, Here We Go Again. (all the title really refers to is the fact that the film is a sequel.) the McGees are looking to celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary, but none of their friends or neighbors can come. they visit the now dilapidated lodge where they honeymooned, which turns out to be just across the river from the swanky soiree in favor of which everyone declined them. against his better judgment (but in line with his usual approach to life), McGee isn't gonna let his poverty keep him from muscling his way into the fancy lodge.
several of their radio ""gang"" join in the fun. Gal Gordon, who played a number of foils for McGee on radio (most famously Mayor LaTrivia), appears as Otis Cadwallader, McGee's former rival for Molly's hand. Bill Thompson, best remembered as the voice of Droopy Dog, plays the character for whom he originated the voice, Wallace Wimple. (interestingly, Wimple, who's always described as a little fella, turns out to be an inch or so taller than Fibber.) and Hal Peary's Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve, who'd recent graduated to his own series, The Great Gildersleeve, returns to the fold to resume his love/hate relationship with his ""little chum,"" McGee.
meanwhile, Bergen is pursuing his hobby of butterflies. the primary thrust of the plot is Bergen's search for a rare silk-spinning moth. his assistant/love interest is provided by a truly charming actress named Ginny Sims. the aforementioned Cadwallader, now a less than altogether scrupulous businessman, turns out to be the villain when he attempts to defraud Bergen.
the other film, Heavenly Days, takes it's title from Molly's second-best rememebered catchphrase. (just behind ""tain't funny, McGee."") it's not quite as delightful because it's basically a propaganda film, and it's preachiness tends to stumble over it's comedy. but it still has it's moments.
the plot finds McGees on their way to Washington, where McGee intends to address the Senate. the war is beginning to wind down, and he wonders just what the government is doing for ""our boys"" formerly ""over there."" the gist of his concern is that the ""average man"" has value, which isn't made any easier to get across by the film's running-gag: Fibber is only the first of a number of characters who take exception to that label, insisting that they are in fact ""well above average."" so much so, in fact, that when he is ultimately awarded a trophy for his representation of the ""average man,"" Fibber takes it as a insult...at least at first.
audiences and critics alike must of been put off by the film's tendency to leap-frog between comedy and ""the message,"" because a poor box-office performances made it the end of Fibber & Molly's brief tenure in the movies. but it should be noted that it's hardly out-of-character, because the McGee show was always rabidly patriotic. it's been said that when it came to spreading the word as to how we at home could do our part for the war effort, it was second only to The Bob Hope Show. so no one can accuse the film of insincerity.
of course it should be noted that radio was the Jordans' and/or McGees' true forte. these movies were intended as a companion piece to the radio series, so i beg you to look into it as well.
