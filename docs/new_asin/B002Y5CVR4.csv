8384076,4,B002Y5CVR4,"Both films are very interesting and very well acted.- Probably it is much more interesting Arizona in terms of the history of U.S.A..- Both films are very well acted and I distinguish Glen Ford in Texas and Jean Arthur in Arizona, but Edgard Buchanan it is superb in both.-",1379289600,2,273,4.591836734693878
8384077,5,B002Y5CVR4,"I thoroughly enjoyed ARIZONA.It has two wonderful and versatile actors, Jean Arthur and William Holden. They really compliment each other in ARIZONA.
Arizona had a lot of adventure and it kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next or if the greed and killing would be stopped. It showed how ""difficult"". times were. And,how they fought and died for what was right.
  I waited a long time for ARIZONA to come out on DVD.It was well worth the wait.",1344124800,4,467,4.5476190476190474
8384078,4,B002Y5CVR4,"I Enjoyed these two films thoroughly.
Quality is good even though B&W.
William Holden is a callow youth almost unrecognisable.
Not entirely Bs for Video Prospectors",1333497600,2,164,5.346153846153846
8384079,5,B002Y5CVR4,"These two movies are great with a very young William Holden in both and another young Glenn Ford in Texas. Texas stars William Holden, Glenn Ford, Claire Trevor, George Bancroft, Edgar Buchanan plus others and was released in '41. Arizona stars Jean Arthur, William Holden, Porter Hall, Edgar Buchanan and others and was released in '40. Both of these movies are in Full Screen format and are in B/W with a great transfer. Both of these movies have their own disk, but comes in a single case. Texas runs for about 93min (1hr 33min) and Arizona runs for about 125min (2hr 5min). This is a must have for any Western fan or fans of these actors. Also, I would recommend this to anyone.",1331251200,9,682,4.5528455284552845
