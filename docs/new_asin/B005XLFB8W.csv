8488677,3,B005XLFB8W,"This movie seemed a little illogical to me. The story lines with Marian Marsh as the nasty wife and the dynamics between the two brothers and the step daughter were interesting.

But the ""plantation"" was out of sorts. Every chance they got, the workers were singing and dancing as if they were on Broadway. There wasn't much work done on that plantation and no one said a word. The musical numbers seemed a little weird and illogical to the story.

The movie was ok, but there are better pre-code classics out there.",1521244800,,516,4.5978260869565215
8488678,5,B005XLFB8W,"GENTLEMEN FROM DIXIE IS BEAUTIFUL MARIAN MARSH'S 2ND TO LAST THEATRICAL MOVIE AND SHE AND HER WORK ARE MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER!  THIS TIME SHE PLAYS A SELFISH WOMAN TO PERFECTION, SOMETHING I HAVE NEVER SEEN HER DO IN ALL HER OTHER MOVIES CURRENTLY AVAILABLE (CIRCA 1/2015).  HER CHARACTER MEETS HER BROTHER IN LAW WHO RETURNS TO THE FAMILY RANCH AFTER HE HAS SERVED TIME IN PRISON FOR A CRIME HE DID NOT COMMIT,  MARIAN'S CHARACTER PRESUMES HIS GUILT AND SHOWS NO LOVE TOWARD HIM.  HER DAUGHTER IN LAW ALSO RECEIVES LITTLE AFFECTION AND MARIAN'S CHARACTER WANTS TO SELL THE GIRL'S FAVORITE HORSE AND ALMOST COMMITS ADULTERY.

POINTERS FOR ALL OF US:
FINDING THE RIGHT PERSON FOR MARRIAGE IS DIFFICULT UNDER IDEAL CIRCUMSTANCES SO BE SURE NOT TO PROPOSE UNTIL YOU FIND SOMEONE THAT IS EQUAL TO YOU IN FAITH AND MORALITY.
ASSUMING THINGS ABOUT OTHERS IS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE WE CAN MAKE.  WE SHOULD ALWAYS GENTLY COMMUNICATE IN PRIVATE WHENEVER WE HAVE ISSUE WITH ANOTHER THAT WE CAN'T DROP.  ALSO WE SHOULD TREAT OTHERS AS INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY WITH NO INTEREST IN DOING SO.  ONLY APPLY TOUGH LOVE OR SEPARATE FROM THEM IF AFTER GENTLE COMMUNICATION THEY WON'T STOP SINNING AGAINST US.  EVEN IF SOMEONE  COMES INTO OUR LIFE THAT WAS CONVICTED, PLEASE REMEMBER THAT THEY MAY BE WRONGFULLY CHARGED AS HER BROTHER IN LAW WAS, OR THEY MAY HAVE CHANGED FOR THE BETTER.  IT CONCERNS ME THAT PEOPLE DON'T GIVE THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN IN PRISON OR EVEN THOSE THAT ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE DONE SOMETHING WRONG A CHANCE TO REDEEM THEMSELVES.  THIS CRUEL BEHAVIOR OF ASSUMING THE WORST ABOUT OTHERS DOES MUCH HARM TO SOCIETY AND TAKES AWAY INCENTIVE FOR RELEASED CONVICTS TO MAKE A CLEAN LAW ABIDING START.

ANY STORY SOUNDS TRUE UNTIL SOMEONE SETS THE RECORD STRAIGHT.
