8695683,1,B00RPOPRIY,"What horrible execution at keeping a D'Amato film in play. This looks to be a home transfer of VHS to DVD-R. Digitally Remastered? Who's kidding whom? On top of that it's listed as one of the longer duration versions and, although it omits the HC inserts which are of little importance to the movie, it sadly is also the pared down version missing much of the more racy scenes by the primary actors.

Anyone want to buy my new dust collector before I place it where it belongs...in the trash bin! Sad, simply SAD!",1450310400,2,513,4.457446808510638
8695684,3,B00RPOPRIY,"Nothing to brag about. I have two more versions of this movie and they are transfers from VHS and they look as bad as this digitally remastered.
But this version is about 10 minutes longer and more explicit.",1433203200,3,207,4.473684210526316
8695685,1,B00RPOPRIY,"In addition  to terrible transfer from VHS this flick very standard on any account. I does show us New York, streets etc. It does have some chicks and sexual situations but nothing explicit, it does has a plot but terrible transfer ruin everything.",1392249600,3,248,4.767441860465116
