2523167,1,B000EMGJE0,"I cannot review this DVD as 10 minutes into the DVD it just stopped.  It didn't skip, it just stopped.  Because of this, I might not trust purchaing any more DVD's from Amazon.  A very disappointed customer.  Richard Leland",1217808000,2,223,4.641025641025641
2523168,3,B000EMGJE0,"I was tempted to purchase this product, in the hopes that they would be films of my taste. They weren't!

I found them too 'gung-ho'! by far. Facts were virtually non-existent, save in name of the event. For a movie to be called 'D Day 6th of June', and for it to be hugely a protracted episode of a 'soap-opera' - albeit a quality 'soap opera'- is not far from misrepresentation.

The other movies are more truthful in their titles, but their factual worth is low indeed. As pure dramas and as entertainment, their worth is in the minds of the individual viewers. I don't go for all the guts and glory, in movies - UNLESS it is factual history.",1215216000,3,645,4.366666666666666
2523169,4,B000EMGJE0,I felt that these movies were very good.  The war collection was a great collection to add to my library.  It was great seeing Richard Widmark in a war movie.  In fact he is still living and is over 90 years of age.,1170720000,9,215,3.953488372093023
