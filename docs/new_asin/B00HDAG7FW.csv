6153965,5,B00HDAG7FW,"My five year old daughter has nearly all the Barbie Movies (I think she is missing one) that she watches as often as allowed and on repeat! She was very anxiously awaiting the release of this one! I was very happy with this Barbie (as was she) movie as unlike the last few this one was not all about being boy crazy! Very cute movie, well put together and the graphics are beautiful. There is enough suspense and action that my son (although not his first choice) will tolerate watching with his sister.",1395273600,3,503,4.419354838709677
6153966,4,B00HDAG7FW,"Storyline and character discussions were appropriate for an elementary-aged child. The animation/graphics were well-done and quite beautiful. As a woman, I have hopes that someday the Barbie storylines won't always have to include a love or crush interest subplot. As a role model, Barbie and younger girl characters should wear more clothes. There is an entire spectrum of colors, less pink please.",1395273600,2,399,5.451612903225806

6153971,5,B00HDAG7FW,"This is a lovely Barbie movie. Here, Barbie (as Lumina) is a mermaid who dreams of being a princess, unaware of an incredible secret that can (and will) change her life.

When General Caligo, the villain of the movie, enlists Lumina's seemingly harmless aunt Scylla to poison the King in order to put his own son on the throne, the intrigue begins. And we soon learn that not all is as it seems.

When Lumina finds her aunt's invitation to the royal ball (where the deed is to be done), she embarks on her own journey to the kingdom to find her. Along the way she (and her best friend Kuda, a pink seahorse) make new friends like Spike, a dangerous Stone Fish whose menace is effectively diffused by Lumina's matter-of-fact refusal to accept him as a threat.

After facing many challenges on the journey, Lumina enters the kingdom where her fashion sense and magical abilities with pearls promptly lands her a job at a beauty salon, where she helps stylize ladies who will attend the kingdom's royal ball. When the entire staff is likewise invited, the stage is set.

At the ball, which is in honor of Fergis, the villainous General Caligo's unwitting son, Lumina's aunt reappears. But her participation in the General's plan is under duress and the evil plot starts to unravel. Fergis, an atypical figure who'd rather be a botanist than a prince, shows his mettle by helping Lumina and her friends defeat his father and save the day.

In the end, Lumina learns the great secret of her true lineage and her aunt is vindicated for her actions, past and present. Fergis is free to follow his own calling and pursue the girl of his dreams, one of Lumina's salon friends. And while Lumina herself does meet a handsome prince of her own, it's more of a subplot, showing that Barbie can share the limelight very effectively with the well-written supporting characters.

This is a highly enjoyable movie that never gets bogged down, heavy or overly serious. And there's plenty of good fun, catchy music and humorous characters with a talented cast of voice actors. I strongly recommend this movie for the entire family. Enjoy!",1394668800,15,2119,4.713513513513513
6153972,5,B00HDAG7FW,My grand daughter loved this movie .  It is a good story and how things can turn out for a princess.,1394668800,17,100,3.761904761904762
6153973,5,B00HDAG7FW,I liked it and it was the last barbie movie I need to complete the film series till the 2 new ones come out in 2014 and 2015,1394496000,,124,3.4642857142857144
6153974,2,B00HDAG7FW,"Not my favorite Barbie movie. It's basically a Rapunzel type story, and unfortunately the story doesn't develop all that well. The action doesn't interest me. I feel like it needed more of a journey. Some of it failed to suspend my disbelief. And I hate it when they throw a prince in at the tail end (no pun intended). I'd rather there be a full romance or no romance at all. It just wasn't that great compared to some of the other Barbie movies. The only ones I would say are worse are probably Thumbelina (my least favorite - hate that one), the Christmas one with the sisters (cute, but confusing), and Pink Shoes (bad moral, not enough ballet stories in the magical land). The Mariposa sequel was cute but had a stupid ending.",1394323200,13,731,4.462686567164179

So when she saw a preview for this on The Secret Door she literally went slack-jawed and started drooling. Needless to say, this was a favorite Christmas morning. And about a million times since then. It's got beautiful colors and vivid imagery, my only complaint is that as with all Barbie movies it seems to be a bit light on consequences. I'm all about girl power, even as hair and fashion-centric (I get it though, it's Barbie) as these movies are, but the endings are always so soft. It just jumps from ""Oh, no!

The movie is just over an hour long which was a good enough timeframe for my kids attention span.  The story is about friendship, problem solving, being yourself, self-confidence and is an easy enough storyline for kids to follow.",1397347200,,698,4.1716417910447765

6154198,4,B00HDAG7FW,Better than most Barbie movies. My 2 girls are obsessed with Mermaids so it was perfect for them and good for ages 3 and 6,1396828800,,122,3.92
6154199,3,B00HDAG7FW,"Too scary for a 3 year old. Fun for a 5 year old. I don't like buying these types of figues that depict females in a stereotypical role, but once Ariel made the scene -- mermaids are it.  Now every little girl wants to grow up to be a mermaid, for G-ds sake.  So we do what we can to give the granddaughters what they want (and then we buy them a doctor's lab coat and send them to science camp for the summer...)",1396656000,,413,3.9047619047619047

6154205,1,B00HDAG7FW,The sound came across really muffled and incocnsitent. We have a brand new tv and have never had this problem before with any other movie purchase or rental from iTunes or any netflix shows.,1396310400,3,190,4.617647058823529

6154207,3,B00HDAG7FW,Seems kind of long for a Barbie movie but perhaps I just wasn't into it. Most Barbie movies my 6 yr old daughter loves but she has not asked to watch this one over and over like the others. Watched it once. Barbie in a Pony Tale is much better.,1396137600,,244,3.9

6154211,2,B00HDAG7FW,Didnt hold my four year olds interest. She prefers more music in the movie. Boring at times. Dontreccomend it for the price.,1395705600,,124,4.681818181818182
6154212,3,B00HDAG7FW,"This is no disney movie, no under the cuff jokes, no visually pleasing graphics, and a lame plot.  But, my daughter loves it and because of that I would buy it again and again!",1395532800,,176,4.176470588235294
