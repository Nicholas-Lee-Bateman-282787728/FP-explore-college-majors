C'mon, even a limited run would be appreciated.",1220659200,3,168,3.6666666666666665
7975291,5,B00007DWO1,"And ""Adam 12"" this ain't. These cops never heard of the Miranda rule!

A terrific action-packed police series from the UK, but only available in Region 2 encoding, so you will need a multi-region DVD player to watch them. Hopefully, a DVD collection will be available in Region 1 encoding for us here in the USA.  Check [...] for ordering if interested.

Although the series was criticized for being too violent and somewhat sexist upon its release, The Professionals is both a gritty, tense, and realistic crime series.  These episodes are a refreshing antidote to the politically-correct police dramas that poliferate today's cable and regular broadcast networks with cops that are apparently more comfortable in the laboratory than fighting the bad guys.

Ex-soldier Bodie and former street cop Doyle (Lewis Collins and Martin Shaw), are the agents for CI5 with Scotsman George Cowley (Gordon Jackson)as their no-nonsense boss. All three characters are unconventional, tough, and uncompromising foes of international crime, corruption, terrorism and anarchy. Seriously, this is an enjoyable and entertaining crime drama--the action simply does not let up.

The interplay and the banter between the three characters is excellent and, at times, very amusing.  Bodie and Doyle are a couple of wiseasses who often take the law into their own hands and require Cowley keep them in line. The scripts and the stories around are interesting and hardly feel dated at all.

The transfers in this set are uncut and digtially remastered and look reasonably good for their age (circa 1977-80).

The series is an unconventional and refreshing combination of action and drama a la ""Starsky and Hutch"" and ""Lethal Weapon.""  Exciting viewing all the same..Enjoy!",1154822400,4,1748,5.277978339350181
7975292,5,B00007DWO1,"I think that this is one of the best British Television Series ever.  Exciting plots with suspense, drama and charasmatic characters.  This series had a cult following in England.

I believe that The Professionals was only shown on ""On TV"" the predecessor of Direct TV or Cable. In my opinion this series is far superior to The Avengers, The Saint and many other British TV shows that have made it to A&E and other american TV channels.

I am looking forward to a United States Release.",1137283200,3,486,4.616279069767442
