3969265,5,B002R0EIVI,I just want to say I saw it in the theater and i was amazing. I hope that it comes out to DVD soon so I can see it again and agian. R.I.P. MJ,1256688000,,141,3.176470588235294
3969266,5,B002R0EIVI,I just got back from watching the advance showing of This Is It.  It was wonderful.  The movie is really well done and it shows a side of Michael that most of us have never seen.  I was very pleased at the amount of footage there was.  It showed Michael performing his classics and interacting with his cast and crew.  His sets were amazing and the things he was going to do were unbelievable.  I cannot wait until this comes out on DVD.,1256601600,,437,4.204819277108434
3969267,5,B002R0EIVI,"Great to know that the KINGS' fans have an opportunity to obtain a copy of his last performance.  Even if it is just a rehearsal, someone like me, who didn't get the chance to see him perform live, I can cherish his talent in this way.  ""HE SHOULDN'T HAVE DIED!!!""",1256601600,,264,4.26
3969268,4,B002R0EIVI,"of course everyone will try to make a buck off of MJ.,as though he was still here and postumously he is even bigger than ever. i listen to his music at least once a day i can't wait until they release his movie, i look at all the news footage i can find on him and it is like he asked Allyah when he died to let part of his spirit live in his songs because they sound very soothing now. may Allyah grant you the peace you tried to give to us.",1256256000,4,442,3.763440860215054
3969269,5,B002R0EIVI,"So sad... the world thought his carreer was over and just when he was about to prove the whole world wrong it turned out that... well... This was it. And as with many stars Michael Jackson's popularity peeked after his death making him even bigger than ever. I guess that's what makes a ""Legacy"", popularity beyond belief.

Sure this (ia it) will all be milked out with compilation CD's, LP's, theatrical cut DVD, director's cut DVD, extended edition DVD, books, boxsets etc. but no one forces you to buy it.

The movie will only be in theatres for 2 weeks so I'm hoping for a DVD / Blu-Ray release in time for a Magical Michael Christmas.

I'm VERY looking forward to have this on blu-ray to let Michael's star shine again and again whenever I want to !",1256169600,11,754,4.449275362318841

3969272,5,B002R0EIVI,I have always known that Michael Jackson was the greatest entertainer of all time. It's been a long time coming for the world to acknowledge it.,1254528000,11,144,4.576923076923077

3969275,4,B002R0EIVI,"You can say what you want but Michael Jackson was a musical genius. He just had a tremendous gift and intuition in order to thrill and entertain his audiences. Michael Jackson sadly passed away by while preparing for a concert tour. By just watching the documentary, I got exhausted in imagining how he could do this concert fifty times. Michael was the star but he was surrounded by top dancers, musicians and concert production. His concert would have been a spectacular visual experience just like every concert or live production should be to the audience. His ""Smooth Criminal"" was always my favorite video of his. The crew were going to bring the memorable videos alive to the audience like ""Smooth Criminal;"" ""Thriller"" and other songs.

The cast and crew had tremendous respect and admiration for Michael Jackson. The press for years hounded him and his family without any care or regards for his privacy. Michael seemed very quiet and reserved but he was focused on the upcoming concert series in London, England. Sadly, we know about his sudden passing on June 25, 2008. The special features included ""memories of Michael."" I loved the scene where they do 3 dimensional thriller experience with Vincent Price's actual voice. The show would have been an amazing once in a lifetime event. Kenny Ortega, the director, understood and worked well with Michael Jackson.

The special features about the making of the documentary was also a fascinating look at the concert that never was to the world. An unforgettable concert experience with interaction; three dimensional; and audience reaction. Michael Jackson was always a pioneering figure in the music industry. Michael was always surprising and thrilling his audience of millions. No matter how much money you paid for the ticket, it wouldn't have been enough for the thrill of a lifetime.",1521590400,,1848,5.055737704918033

3969301,2,B002R0EIVI,"The content is as represented, footage from preparation for Michael Jackson's new world tour with rehearsals and stage trials and such. I very much enjoy Michael Jackson's music and wanted this album.

Unfortunately, Sony has decided to show their usual arrogant disdain for customers. The BluRay comes with a full minute of unskippable movie trailers for some crappy Adam Sandler movie. Since that happens every time you watch it, it ruins the experience because you start out annoyed before you even get to the actual content.

As long as Sony keeps this crap up, I can't in good conscience recommend buying this title.",1506729600,2,621,5.019417475728155

3969305,5,B002R0EIVI,"I was never really a fan before, but I enjoy documentaries and I have a whole new respect for Michael Jackson after watching this. His talent was mind blowing. Simply incredible. And sad, because he insisted on giving everything he had to his fans, in terms of energy and perfection, and he was afraid because he was now older he couldn't deliver the exacting and powerful performance he wanted. Besides Michael though, you get to see some amazing world-class musicians and the most talented dancers and back-up singers imaginable. He was the best at what he did and he surrounded himself with the highest quality talent.",1504310400,3,621,4.867924528301887

3969308,5,B002R0EIVI,"Well, since the great gloved one ain't alive no more to dominate tabloid news, this is really the only way to see him up close anymore. Unless you hold old magazine pictorials up to your face, but that's kinda weird. This vid is an odd combination of a dress rehearsal for a concert that never made it live, mixed with half done CGI footage, and a behind the scenes look at how truly one of a bazzillion this entertainer was. And just like french fries and ice cream mixed together, it somehow works. To best simulate the live experience, we would have the surround sound speakers turned way up, darken the room so we can only see our HDTV, and stand waaaay on the other side of our living room so that the screen looks waaaay small. Feels like going to a real show, because who has that kinda dough to buy front row seats to an MJ concert?!",1502668800,,841,4.29559748427673
3969309,5,B002R0EIVI,Footage of rehersals for This Is It tour right before Michael died. Outstanding live versions of his stuff. My personal favorites were Smooth Criminal & Thriller.

3969334,4,B002R0EIVI,"Look at MJ closely. He's skin and bones. His health is ailing and not many people knew. He's taking at least 3 different medications and he may have been addicted. He's out of breath and worried about saving his voice on many songs .MJ';s intentions were meant well,but as the date for his 50 London concerts(he only agreed to 10) got close he and his promoters knew that he would not be able to perform an entire show. MJ wanted to back out,but by now they gave him no choice. The nite of MJ's death the lights stayed on a fan had reported who was outside MJ's residence. What really happened? He was a virtual prisoner when he wasn't rehearsing. His father Joseph was prevented from seeing his son a few days before his death and had threatened to crash his car through the gates to get in. MJ was worth a lot more dead than alive. This DVD gives you an idea but only a small one as to what was going on in MJ's life as he rehearsed for the London concerts. The DVD would've be an entire show if they had actually finished an entire performance. I still recommend it though and mainly because of the new technology in film making that they were going to use in his show. I loved his music and the good person he was. I miss him still...",1489968000,,1238,4.227848101265823

accomplish this tour.  Felt so bad for him, of course, but also for all those young
people that got the chance to do this tour only to have it disappear along with

I'm not musically inclined, but every time I watch this movie, all I can think is what if I applied that much passion to what I do.

3969707,4,B002R0EIVI,"Ultimately a very tragic film for a number of reasons. You know from history that Michael was very near the end of his life, and watching this rehersal footage you can't help but pick up that he isn't completely well in this video. He seems slower, skips more lines in song and is cautious with conserving his voice. Showing up at rehersals he sometimes appears tired and yet you can't help but admire his love of the craft and passion put into his vocals and dancing. It's hard to know what to believe of the tabloids but I am led to believe that his energies spent at these concerts was likely fueled by medications and the combination with drugs, rehersal euphoria and exhaustion, combined with propofol sleeping narcotics, are likely what lead to his death.

The video footage is fantastic, and even at 50 Michael was an amazing entertainer and performer. The stage sets, costumes and dances were elaborate and very clever. So interesting is seeing Michael's perfectionistic control about all aspects of the production, getting the sound just right while at the same time being courteous and professional with those he works with. The video features many of Michael's big songs and they all sound fantastic. This was a fitting, and very tragic, tribute to the late artist.",1435622400,,1276,4.82648401826484

3969803,4,B002R0EIVI,"THIS IS IT provides a behind-the-scenes view of Michael Jackson's efforts to launch one last tour of fifty performances prior to retirement. MJ often used cameras during rehearsals to capture footage to view in his downtime in order to make last-minute improvements and corrections for his live performances. For this reason, viewers of this DVD have the extremely rare opportunity to view a perfectionist in the midst of perfecting.

While many dispute the appropriateness of sharing footage MJ never intended for the public, the amount of money generated from creating this feature-length documentary, among other projects, ensured that executors of MJ's estate (John Branca and John McClain) were able to preserve the financial wherewithal of MJ's children, which had become a major source of uncertainty and concern for their father prior to his death. To handle the business side of This is It, MJ reunited his old team of Branca and McClain with Frank Dileo along with Kenny Ortega, director of DANGEROUS and HISTORY tours, to handle the creative side.

Despite the shadow of prescription drug addiction and the lethal use of anesthesia, what cannot be denied from viewing the disc is the sheer magnetism, charisma, and command of stage that MJ always maintained from childhood. Whenever he is in the camera's frame, the viewer's eyes find him and then cannot leave him. Though soft of voice, MJ maintains control of music, sound, lighting, choreography, and yes, even direction. At the same time, he respectfully receives and offers constructive feedback to raise performance levels for himself and others, always ""with love,"" and ""God bless you,"" he says.

Because this is rehearsal footage, we do not see MJ singing or dancing at the top of his range. As he repeats several times, he is preserving his voice and energy for the show itself. Still, the audience witnesses his athletic body memory performing complex dance movements on several numbers. He also corrects the tone, pitch, and timing of his backing singers and music director.

The audience sees a genius who maintains a sense of humor and generosity towards fellow performers, musicians, crew, and director. He makes sure his female guitarist and duet partner have their time to shine and that his dancers have plenty of opportunities to showcase their own athleticism. While MJ appears tired during rehearsal for Thriller, for all other numbers, he appears alert, energetic, engaged, positive, and confident.

As for concerns about body weight, a repeat view of the Bad tour, Live at Wembley 1988 reveals a man with a dancer's body--slender with lean musculature and sufficient cardio ability to dance and sing for two hours. Other people who pop-locked in the 80s have since decided to give their joints rest.  Nineteen years later, however, we see MJ still lean of build, fifty-years-old, and strong enough to continue pop-locking at a time most other dancers either become teachers and choreographers or actors. Weak people cannot pop lock, fall to their knees, slide on the floor, then get back up, belt out a song, jump around, stomp the floor, then reprimand their music director ""with love"" for still not understanding who's actually in charge. ""That's why we rehearse,"" MJ says.

In-between rehearsal footage, the audience receives asides from the producers, film and concert director, dance and music directors, costume designer, etc on their thoughts of their experiences with MJ and This is It. Missing are thoughts or views from any member of MJ's family--mother, father, sisters, brothers, children. This leaves friends and acquaintances to tell the story of the last moments of MJ's life.

This is It, is also the title of an unfinished 80s demo, finally completed with backing vocals from the Jacksons that plays over end credits. The song sounds great and hopefully, such collaborations will continue with the vast collection of unreleased MJ demos, perhaps even with occasional assistance from sister Janet.

Disc includes two making-of documentaries and three featurettes on costumes, dance auditions, and interviewees sharing their memories of working with MJ.

Worth the price of purchase by both fans and non-fans to view the last rehearsal performances of the greatest pop star on the entire planet--Michael Jackson. Though North American media challenged and even mocked MJ's King of Pop designation, through sheer force of worldwide record and album sales, worldwide fan devotion, genius-level songwriting and storytelling ability, plus record-setting contributions to charitable causes, MJ's influence in the world of music entertainment can be denied only by the petty and the confused.
No longer just a man.
Michael Jackson is legend.
He is King of Pop.",1426118400,5,4752,5.24078947368421

This judgmental society doesn't heartily encourage individualism because they can't control those who know themselves well.  In fact, I believe many would say that his artistry was indeed channeled from a Heavenly Source as it is with so many talented people in every type of industry, be it the Arts, Sciences, Education or Philosophy.  We are a richer society because of stellar personalities who manifest and hone their life's purpose with excellence regardless of what the conditioned, mainstream minds think.

Excellent film footage of his work in progress and the L-O-V-E and respect he showed to others as well as garnered from them.",1425686400,,757,5.231404958677686

There is another DVD I do have with Michael Jackson performing live in Bucharest, and it's his 1992 Dangerous tour. I find that's a good live performance with Michael performing live in Bucharest, so I would pretend that's the  ""This Is It"" tour Michael was preparing for. I also find that live performance with Michael Jackslooks similar to this movie ""This Is It"", even though it's the rehearsal performances.",1425427200,,666,4.9375
3969823,1,B002R0EIVI,"I'm not the only Michael fan that thinks this movie should have never been made. It's nothing but an attempt for the Producer's of his final concert to recoup some of their investment (which I understand), but if you are a true fan of MJ you won't want anything to do with this mess. It's just a bunch of clips preparing for Michael's final tour, but it is NOT a movie that contains a finished production. Michael Jackson was an extreme perfectionist in everything he did and this video is just a bunch of sloppy, unfinished clips. I don't think MJ would have wanted anyone to see this as his last concert. It isn't. Long live MJ, but in ways other than this drivel. I sold my copy on eBay. It did look like ""This is it"" was going to be one heck of a show though. It's too bad it never happened.",1425340800,2,795,4.2026143790849675

To hear his normal speaking voice which isn't high. That was for the 'brand' and interviews. To see a man this age dance is amazing. Great sound track as well. Highly recommend.

Truely it was a masterpiece that never was. No matter what you may think of Michael's controversial personal life, the world has lost an incredible artist. I highly recommend this movie.

I enjoyed it as well. I will say it did make me sad to know that we will never get the chance to see Michael perform live because he is gone. But it is comforting to know that even though he is gone in body, he lives on through his music and his performances. I am 40 and my nephew is 14 and we both enjoyed this movie.

I was in the show trying to writed down the script with a pen light in my hand but couldn't do it for too long.

I was crying at the end.  This man put so much love into everything that he did.  All that he ever truly wanted was to love and be loved.
It truly was inspiring.
Also,  I usually do not recommend watching the DVD extras or bonus features but you won't be disappointed if you do,
At fifty years old it's clear that he could still sing and dance like any 20 year old could.  It was simply amazing and even my husband who isn't the biggest fan said that he really enjoyed it..

I liked some of his songs, but other than that, I did not pay much attention to all the news about him - a lot of that very unflattering. Allegations of child abuse, strange behavior, multiple plastic surgeries, obscene wealth, etc, etc. ""The Weirdo"", as he was often called. After watching this video I felt pangs of sadness that we lost a truly gifted artist, someone not only incredibly talented, but also hard working and... humble. The glimpses at his rehearsals, what other people working with him say about Michael, the way he perfects his moves, his songs - I can't imagine anyone would remain a hater of ""The Gloved One"" after watching this beautifully filmed documentary, with great music throughout. I watched it three times already, and it has a favorite spot in my collection.",1397347200,4,836,4.8125

3970231,5,B002R0EIVI,"I have never been a big Michael Jackson fan though found some of his songs entertaining, danceable and memorable. Happened upon this film while channel surfing one day and was mesmerized. This film oozes with musical artistry and exhibits the dedication of all involved. They could have done a separate movie just on the 11 dancers who made the cut out of several thousand who auditioned. This isn't canned music...all live vocals and music, every bit as good as the original recordings. Throw in the poignant shots, fades and special effects and I would imagine the true MJ fans would be left in tears.  DO NOT let this slip by if you're into music as its actually somewhat difficult to obtain (ordered a month ago from Best Buy and order was cancelled as they couldn't obtain a copy; I bought 2 copies, yeah, its that good).",1386806400,,826,4.657534246575342

3970234,5,B002R0EIVI,"I Have been a lifelong fan of this musical genius. First with the jackson five then as a solo artist. I related to his struggle with the child abuse he suffered at the hands of his father. Raised by the strap or belt, it made for a traumatic childhood. I have yet to forgive my father for the beatings but I read that Michael was able to forgive his. His music truly represented the man he was. I am very grateful this final footage of Michael was captured on film. It was fascinating to watch him back in action. My only regret is that I never had the chance to see him ""live"" in concert. And yes the man was very gracious and kind to all who worked with him on the process of ""this is it"". It is sad that the media would not let the man rest.",1385942400,,744,4.0

A group of 12 of us got together & went to the preview that first night. It was a night I'll forever remember. Best gift ever. Even people who weren't his fan's walked out saying what an excellent movie it was. Now that is a real compliment. (Especially if you knew these people.)He brought so much love, joy, happiness, wonder, beauty & true caring to this world. so much of what we lack now & have for so very long. this movie shows how much of himself he really put into his work & how important it was to impress his viewers & make them happy & get his messages across to the whole world. we should all continue to carry on Michael's message's. Even though we will never have another beautiful genius like him in our lifetime, we owe it to his memory to pass on his words & his loving messages to our friends and family. teach our children to love one another no matter what. it's the best way we can say thank you Michael for giving your life for your fans.

Some clips show MJ rehearsing with the other performers. While I did enjoy watching this film in theaters I was expecting a little more. It was somewhat rough and in need of a good polish. The performances were OK. There are no special features on this disc. This isn't the only way to remember MJ. Check out MJ's video collections to see him at his best as an artist. Also see Michael Jackson's Vision (sold separately) which isn't perfect but it is the most complete collection available.,1376697600,,668,4.483606557377049

Besides the main documentary, there are hours of many smaller ones each supporting one facet of the production.  There is much to be learned by seeing how the show's resourceful and effective executive producer Kenny Ortega gingerly worked with the creative and sensitive genius of Michael Jackson in developing the never-completed event.

As a commercial filmmaker myself it was impressive to see just how much work goes on in the background in preparing for a live show, but was disappointed that with all the money flowing around from MJ's promoter that they couldn't have used higher quality HD cameras and production rigs for this documentary.

I'm sure most people enjoy it because it's the last performance of MJ; I just wish they'd opted for a higher production value than what they gave it.",1373846400,3,718,4.465648854961832

That Imperialist doesn't quit.  He's burning down our country and wants us to worship him every chance we get.  Get off my DVD! ...and get out of my life!",1364774400,,429,4.435897435897436

3970399,5,B002R0EIVI,"I never saw Michael Jackson this way. I loved watching him explain his thoughts to the people that he was working with. He would go into his head and Jive to this internal concert that I so much wanted to be a part of. It made me realize, even more, how much we have lost and how strong that he was while never quite being understood. In this movie I saw people that loved him and tried so hard to be what he needed while he was teaching them to be the greatest that they could be.
This movie was so Great it will help you.

Michael's passion for his art comes through as well as his love for others. It is a wonderful presentationb to his life and art.  Had this documentary not been produced, I probably would have never known how much Michael was gifted in all areas of music and dance.",1363651200,,434,4.697368421052632

3970405,5,B002R0EIVI,"Given that this disc is stitched together from footage shot on many different days using different format cameras, I am amazed how well the entire thing turned out.

On most songs that are stitched together from different footage, you'll see the clothes of Michael, the dancers, the singers, and the band change in the middle of the song as new scenes are cut in. You'd think this would be distracting, but it isn't ... probably because the audio is seamless. All the scenes for a given song are synchronized to the audio track perfectly.

You'll also see for any given song that the cameras used are different. Some are high definition and fill the entire screen of an HDTV while others are lower-resolution - you can tell when there is a black border surrounding the scene. Still, I wasn't distracted by this at all. The audio tracks sound great on my home theater and its fun to see Michael interacting with his fellow performers.

The scenes with Jackson's lead guitarist, the Australian Orianthi, are just amazing. She is a standout musician. The duet with Judith Hill on ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"" was also one of my favorites. I wasn't too crazy to see so much of Kenny Ortega as it seemed he made a special effort to insert himself into some scenes, but that's Hollywood for you.

For anyone who grew up listening to Michael Jackson, this is a great disc to remember him by. Even though he didn't get the chance to take it on the road, I hope Michael's adult relatives are proud of what he accomplished on ""This is it"".",1362787200,2,1531,4.556363636363637

His humility, grace, compassion and love were certainly not brought out in any media coverage, but rather he was made to be a bizarre child molester and after seeing these, I'm certain NONE of the negative media reports were correct.

If you're as big a fan of MJ as I am, I would definitely recommend this to have in any Michael Jackson Collection.

Having spent 25 years as a DJ in nightclubs starting in the 70's I went through the whole MJ ritual of playing 'Billie Jean' over and over for the club crowd ... Now at the age of 60 I picked up this DVD per chance and was taken back immediately to a era of dance and feel good vibes ... this man at the age of 50 blows away any performer who has survived the era of dance and rhythm ... the fact that he could still produce the sounds and was particularly exacting about what the fans would hear brought a brand new respect for Michael as an artist ... forget the hoopla surrounding his offstage antics and become enthralled with a true artist ... believe me all you unbelievers out there, there's no one in this era of music that compares ...

3970545,2,B002R0EIVI,"I actually own this DVD as I think it gives valuable insight into who Michael Jackson was, particularly before his death.  There are a few things I found to be a BIT illuminating, given the idea we have of who he was. The movie was made after his death... however, the film starts with an endorsement for Obama - something that clearly was not possible. We have no idea if Michael would have endorsed Obama - and I find it disrespectful that the ad is in there in the first place.  (And it is a rather lengthy ad.)
The other thing, if you are truly a fan of Michael Jackson's work - you're not going to find much good work here.  He was a perfectionist, as is obvious by all his other work... I suspect he would not have liked to have his rehearsals shown.  Rehearsal is exactly that - re herse.
Having said that, I've watched it a few times.  Clearly there were those he truly loved working right along side him - and that's a lovely thing to see.  He also looks fragile and weak, disoriented at times - and like there is no way he could have withstood the pressures of the actual production had it gone that far.

3970549,5,B002R0EIVI,"Absolutely, beautifully done.  Fortunately ""This Is It"" DVD captures the essence & passion of Michael Jackson, performers, producers preparing for tour.  It is difficult not to be emotional in my review about how I am left after seeing this DVD and what MJ was creating.

After seeing this documentary the appreciation I feel for having been here while he was on this planet, now grows daily.  I was moved and inspired by what he created around himself and for others.  Wow.  This is a story about a pinnacle event for all in collaboration with Michael jackson for his tour and it makes me wonder what life is now like for those individuals.  Michael created team players and they all won.  'It', the tour, did not happen, (too bad) and 'it' did happen- the embodiment of Alan Watts novel ""This is it"".  ""This is it"" is unfortunately, it, the last time he would be filmed and I can not be anything but sad about that.",1331424000,,917,4.5426829268292686

3970555,4,B002R0EIVI,"As a Michael Jackson fan, he was and always will be a legend. If you're not a fan, you won't agree, and you certainly won't understand. His music, his dance style, and his unbeatable charitable contributions to many organizations, are all pieces of that creative Michael Jackson puzzle that we all craved to explore, that we all missed because we were too busy judging him, and that we all long for now, but all we can do now is cherish the memories and legacy of the music contributions he left behind. The ""This Is It"" film is entertaining enough if you just want to have one more glance of Michael in action before his untimely death. Many complain that this DVD is not a five star performance. Of course it's not. But it's not a failed attempt at immortalizing him either. This DVD gives us a peek inside his last rehearsal performances. We get to see the making of what I think was going to be one hell of a great tour had he lived to complete the tour he had planned. My reasons for liking and buying this DVD is simple. I like it because it is his last performance. I like it because I am a fan. I like it because it's Michael doing what Michael loved to do the most...perform....dance....sing...and to put it in an even more simple term...ENTERTAIN.

Michael Jackson was such a great dancer, singer, and showman. I found the dvd on amazon on sale very cheap on black friday and decided to add it to my order. To me, the dvd with the bonus features is a fascinating look into how he worked, as well as an enjoyable way to listen to his music. It's a shame he had problems and died young because This Is It looks like it would have been an incredible show to see.",1325376000,,527,4.0285714285714285
3970564,4,B002R0EIVI,"In a way, Kenny Ortega`s ""Michael Jackson's This is It"" is more interesting for what it ISN'T than for what it is.  What it ISN'T is a documentary account of the life, career and death of Mr. Jackson, inevitably colored by the personal viewpoints and biases of its maker.  In fact, but for the cruel hand of Fate, ""This is It"" shouldn't even exist as a movie at all.  The behind-the-scenes footage of Jackson and his crew mounting their elaborate, effects-laden worldwide tour scheduled for summer 2009 - his first in over ten years - was initially intended only for Jackson`s own personal library.  Instead, that footage has become a moving elegy for the self-proclaimed King of Pop, who died tragically on June 25, 2009, at the unripe young age of 50.  Wisely, there are no post-mortem interviews or commentary included in the film.  The performers all speak of him in the present tense, excited at the prospect of being a part of what is clearly an experience of a lifetime for any musician, dancer or singer fortunate enough to be a part of the show.  That their dreams never really came to fruition is what gives the film a depth and poignancy that goes beyond simply the loss of Jackson.  Indeed, watching this film is a bit like experiencing how the gods must feel, looking down upon us mere mortals as we go about our daily lives secure in the nave belief that we will live forever, blithely unaware of what the future actually has in store for us.

As to Jackson himself, he emerges as energetic and deeply engaged in the creative process, no more petulant or demanding than your average legendary superstar - one who actually had talent, by the way, celebrated for his songwriting and choreography as well as for his singing and dancing.  And, of course, the music itself is irresistible and timeless.

It's a bittersweet experience watching this film, not only because of what happened to Michael but because of all the time and energy displayed by these hardworking individuals that would eventually come to naught.  The small compensation is the existence of this film that captures not just for us but for generations yet unborn the creative and performing genius of Michael that will endure through time.

Who knows, but someday someone will make a warts-and-all biography of Michael Jackson that will attempt to knock the king off his throne.  But ""This is It"" ain't that movie.",1325376000,2,2394,4.751207729468599

3970570,5,B002R0EIVI,"I waited over two years to watch this movie, torn about whether or not Michael would want rehearsal footage to be seen by his fans (he was such a perfectionist with his work). Finally, after missing him so long, I broke down and watched.  It is an amazing look at the tour that would have been and the talent that still pulsed through Michael in his final days.  Seeing all the songs live was an instant mood enhancer, but then remembering that this brilliant artist will not be able to perform again put a tinge of sadness on everything.  Nonetheless, if you are a fan it's a must have for your collection.  It is something I will certainly pull out on rainy days to be moved by the brilliance of MJ.
Special features were a little lame, could have put together more tribute information, but for the price it's a steal!  Don't hesitate.",1323129600,,837,4.444444444444445
3970571,5,B002R0EIVI,"This movie is a must for any Michael Jackson fan. It shows a tiny bit of what Michael, the performer, was like off the stage. It doesn't got really in depth in his life because Michael was a very private person. Excellent movie overall!",1321747200,,236,4.386363636363637
3970572,5,B002R0EIVI,GREAT PERFORMER! STILL SOUNDED GREAT! I ACTUALLY QUESTIONED IF HE WAS SINGING OR IF THEY WERE PLAYING A RECORD OR CD! THE BOY WAS BAD!,1321574400,,134,4.4
3970573,4,B002R0EIVI,"The song entitled ""This Is It"" should not be in the music CD for This Is It.
Watch the clip for the rehearsal of  ""Earth Song"" and note that Michael Jackson refers to having only four years to save the Planet Earth; after that the harmful changes are irreversible as he states.  With respect to this subject he feels so strongly about, he clearly states: ""this is it"".  How could the producers, directors and estate administrators miss this salient point?  It is quite upsetting.  Hearing the unreleased song ""This Is It"" (two versions of same)seems so out of place.  Luckily, the DVD is just decent enough to distract from what appears me so obvious.  (12-01-11:  Kenny Ortega's trial testimony does imply that he was very aware of what MJ meant by ""This Is It""; he says that MJ wanted to promote his messages about the saving the Earth and helping children.  So, why confuse and include two versions of an old song that seems unrelated to MJ's intent?)

""Earth Song"" in the DVD was rehearsed on the day before Michael died, according to the manslaughter trial of his doctor.  It is priceless to watch him rehearsing ""Earth Song"" and ""Thriller"" on this day.  However, the pre-trial matters suggest that there is a lot more rehearsal to watch and more material of Michael's final days are going to be produced for us.

The DVD and the movie show how thin Michael was and his discomfort level of returning to the stage.  His talent and skill were so great that we cannot really comprehend his pain, suffering and his actual condition.

On the lighter side, watch Judith Hill and MJ rehearse ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"".
They sang well together.  I think MJ really enjoyed that gig.  Too bad she did not seem to perform with him--but their singing complemented each other.",1321401600,,1773,4.64951768488746

Highly recommend it.",1319673600,,164,4.32258064516129
3970579,5,B002R0EIVI,"I review this film now with a mixture of sorrow, elation, and wishful thinking of what could have been. I can remember the press conference he gave on CNN. At the time it seemed like no big deal. ""OK,"" I thought, ""Michael's making another comeback after another long hiatus away from the spotlight."" Little did I realize that that would be the last time I'd see him alive and thinking back it's so ironic that his last concert was dubbed ""This is It!""

Took me a good year to getting around to seeing it. In that time I couldn't even bring myself to hear any of his songs. Had all of his adult stuff (was too poor growing up to get any of his earlier stuff) but I don't consider myself a hardcore fan. Still, all of his songs are like a soundtrack for all my memories growing up and my nostalgia comes mainly from that, from losing an icon from my generation.

Anyway, on to the review. It's incredible. To think that this guy was 50 years old, had been doing this for over 40 years, had been through all the scandals he'd been through, you wouldn't be able to tell it watching and listening to him in this well-edited film by Kenny Ortega, truly a bittersweet farewell to the gloved one. That light, soft, often fragile voice of his still sounds as sweet, as beautifully alien and innocent it ever has on all of his songs and those which he performed with his brothers, especially their hit ""I'll be there,"" where he gets carried away at the end and warns his organist (Michael Bearden) not to let him get too carried away and jeopardize his voice. This film shows how dedicated and how obsessed Michael was, often softening his reprimands by saying in his light voice ""I love you.""  There are many great numbers throughout this film but the standout is saved for last, Billy Jean. He left himself, so to speak, and danced his ass off as the performers stood and watched with their mouths open, cheering him on and clapping. It was great.

Finally, there's a poignant retrospective of Michael by all the people he worked with in the film including various dancers, the musical director, former managers, etc. Say what you want about the man's personal life but there is no argument as to the fact that he is the greatest entertainer who ever lived. No one else even comes close. Thanks, Mike.",1319500800,,2293,4.478468899521531
3970580,1,B002R0EIVI,"Most of the scenes have a Michael impersonator and the singing does not sound like him at all to me. Like the recording his doctor made of Michael that they played in court, Michael could not make sense talking and he sure could not sing close to the end. By not making this video they could have left previous videos of Michael shine so that the terrible video This Is It! would not shatter anybody's great memory of Michael.",1318204800,2,426,4.405063291139241

3970584,5,B002R0EIVI,"Michael's career will never be over as long as there is one iota of a person who still loves and adores his work, as well as the human being. Michael is no prima donna by any means, and he appears like someone you could easily talk to as a friend if you are friends with him. His talent is second nature to him like breathing and eating, all he has to do is to present it in perfected mode for a dynamite act that will wow em in the audience.
The advantage here, although I wish he could have completed his tour as scheduled, is we as an audience not only get to see the rehearsals for his dynamite swan song concert, but the vibrations and chemistry of the inside look towards his backups, dancers, and studio technicians which might have been completely overlooked in the main event. What is the validity to this? Michael himself that this quote unquote ""This Is It"" mission is the final hour for his days of touring shows. On the brief other hand, we have aspiring new talent who have emulated Michael all their lives, and now have a chance to glow beside him. This is their hour as well, to glow on stage next to the master. It is this factor that makes this video a class all its own outside of another dress rehearsal of a major pop star. If you could eclipse the events that led to his accidental death just for a moment, we see the mega talent of yesterday colliding with the new world of today. Michael himself said his songs were possibly outdated since they are almost entirely devoid of any kind of rap labels of today. This should not concern him, however, since even the most rap star bros cannot do anything but see Michael as the ongoing mega star he is, and you can tell quite plainly by their reverence in talking to him while rehearsing through the numbers one at a time.
Excellent documentary video, and probably a better concert with vast chemistry other than a dynamic performance by all, and the technicians left in the dark.",1316908800,,1948,4.383977900552487

Coming into this release I was expecting a documentary with a lot of people talking about how sorry they feel and footage of the rehearsal but this ain't that at all. These are the actual compiled performances with dancers, back screen 3D footage, props and even newly recorded HD video segments that serve as intros to the songs. Of course these do not have the final look but they do feature live playing and singing. You can really see him gesture and dance as he was doing it in front of thousand people. As it turns out he did sang in front of us. So I'm happy he gave a 100% of him because now I'm able to see what he was like live and he was indeed great. Thus in a way I'm thankful that Ortega was able to do this film because the people who see it will realize that he wasn't just a crazy guy but an incredibly creative entertainer who left at his best.

3970605,4,B002R0EIVI,"I have never thought of myself as a Michael Jackson fan and watched this movie with built in reservations about even liking it. The truth of the matter is I consider myself a dedicated fan of classical music and doubted that there would be anything in this movie that would get me interested.

Boy was I wrong!

""This is It"" is a truly remarkable account of a dedicated professional performer who knew his art to perfection; although I was unfamiliar with his music, his professional competence in what he was doing shows through very clearly. I found myself becoming enthusiastic about his vision for the production and certainly admired his control of the various forces that would be required to bring it to fruition.

Another big plus was the level of professionalism demonstrated by those people he had gathered around him to fulfill this vision. It is indeed tragic that the only result of all of the huge effort put in by all of them was a single movie. It is true that some of the artists featured have used this as a springboard for their own careers, Jackson's lead guitarist; Orianthi Panagaris immediately comes to mind for example. It is hoped that others may also benefit from the gigantic effort that was put into the preparations for the stage presentations.

I can recommend this film not only for Michael Jackson fans, but for anyone who has a sincere regard for professionalism, especially in the field of performance. This movie is a showcase of professionalism and is worthy of appreciation on that level alone.",1297900800,5,1532,4.791666666666667

3970617,5,B002R0EIVI,"This Is It is a fascinating documentary-style behind-the-scenes video of what would have been Michael Jackson's final concert tour.

With multiple cameras and angles, you will watch Jackson rehearsing with the crew and then mixed together to the actual songs.

Say want you want about Michael: weird, bizarre, etc... the man had a great talent of dance and song. He made a huge impact on popular culture. If you have any doubt, just look at the number of awards he won throughout his career.

Outside of this being about Michael Jackson, the video itself is fascinating to watch how a would-have-been blockbuster concert event was put together.

The special featurettes show how they selected the 11 dancers out of hundreds of applicants, and how the concert would have ended with Jackson taking off in a jet. You get to see how every outfit was created for this concert and just how much he loved crystals.

My favorite part, of course, was the music. Nothing can stop you from moving (in some fashion) to songs like Bad, Beat It, Thriller, Billy Jean, etc...

3970621,5,B002R0EIVI,"I grew up listening to classical music and also playing classical music. Though I have also always liked pop music very much, I never imagined there would come a time when I would reach the point of literally *falling in love* with a pop artist. Never,... until I saw a Michael Jackson video (Dangerous) for the first time. I was in awe. That was about twenty years ago but his limitless talent and his unique charisma, his jaw-dropping performances, his admirable singing abilities were more than I would have ever expected from ANY performer. For different reasons, I never had the chance to see MJ live, but I had the hope that there would come a day when I would be one of the lucky ones standing in the audience at one of MJ's live concerts somewhere in the world. I had been hoping for Michael to return to the stage and, once more, awe the world with his rare talent. It could not happen. More than a year has passed since Michael's passing but I have not been able to come to terms with his death. He was too special.  I am so glad and so thankful to have been able to have this great video. As soon as ""This is it"" became available I got it on DVD. Just recently I also got another copy on blu-ray and I am thinking of getting a third one, just in case. Had Michael had the chance to go on his ""This is it"" tour, it would have been a wonderful show. It didn't happen, and this saddens me deeply. Michael was a very special human being and, as an artist, had a talent like no other. He was the best pop artist that ever lived, he is and will *always* be the best. This video comes to prove that, at almost 50 years of age, Michael was ready, once again, to charm and inspire the whole world. I will never find the words to describe my admiration for this phenomenal artist, for this special man. Love you always, Michael.",1287792000,3,1829,4.240687679083095

Then i waited to be on dvd i got the one disc when it came out and i notice they had two-disc i didn't know which one was good. i found out the two-disc was better.  so by the time i went back to the store it sold out.  so i keeped the one-disc and when i saw they had this it was cheap alot better what they charged which was $25.99. i am glad i got this one. And gave the one-disc to friend.  i love bonus features dirty diana and smooth criminal with the dancers in it.  i couldn't stop singing along through the whole movie.

I'm not a huge MJ fan but, I don't necessarily believe that fandom is required in order to enjoy a concert movie like this. Sadly, this is one that I simply didn't enjoy despite enjoying much of MJ's music.

The film seemed to drag at times and at many points I felt like watching it was more like a chore. And to be perfectly honest, I'm a little upset that I didn't enjoy it. It's a film I really wanted to like.",1286236800,3,526,4.0
3970625,5,B002R0EIVI,"I never liked MJ,never bought his records,CD's, thought he was 100% guilty of all charges.

But for some reason I went to see this movie. I was blown away!! From the dancer auditions at the beginning, the overwhelmed and crying winners of a world-wide search, to seeing them mastering the difficult performances and the joyous looks on their faces. From very talented Kenny Ortega's stage direction and visions to the extremely classy and grown-up renditions of those visions. What I thought would be a modern thuggy, rappish, gangster-like show, was clean, classy and happy. I'm 65, I'd have PAID to see this show!

Then there was Michael himself. Instead of the self-mutilated, adrogynous, over-drugged bi-racial""creature"" that he had become, I saw an extraordinarily talented artist with more vision than even Ortega. If the day had ever come when Michael could not perform, he'd have had a super back-up career as a stage director. It was fascinating to witness the artist doing it again and again until he had it perfect. Also with the constant gum chewing I will speculate that MJ was indeed on amphetamine during the day to the extent the only way ""down"" at night was a needle and anesthesia in the jugular. He basically went down the Judy Garland road which only dead ends.

Therefore I was forced to break MJ into 2 people: the good one and the other one. I fell in love with the good one, the artist, the creator of some terrific stick-in-your-head songs, dancer and visioner. I have watched this movie at least 14 times and I tear up at the beauty of most of the songs and acts.

I saw a cartoon in the paper after his death: Heaven and Hell flipping for his soul,
""Your call."" Don't know where he ended up, but I'm sure the Good Michael went to where he can look down and be very pleased with this excellent movie that the multi-talented Ortega directed.

Sorry you didn't value your kids and life over your career, Michael, but I understand. You WERE your career. You had no other identity. I cried also for the young dancers who worked so hard and saw only part of their dream realized. A great and beautiful movie! Buy it!!",1285891200,,2138,4.645502645502646

When Michael Jackson died on June 25th, the world stopped turning for 24 hours and a part of it died with him. This is by FAR the best DVD to ever come out of 2010 and I recommend it to anyone who loves Michael and i'm sure by now every single of of Michael Jacksons TRUE fans have this DVD.

In the This Is It DVD, Michael is not portrayed as a fragile, sick, old man the media made him out to be. You see him smiling, dancing, joking, having so much fun being back where he feels at home the most. You can tell he could not wait to show the entire world his greatest creation EVER! He is totally like a kid again, giddy with excitement and you can see that come out in every dance step that he takes.

It turned out to be a compilation of footage of rehearsal sessions, sound checks, dress rehearsals, etc. for the big London concert that was never to be.  Obviously they didn't know MJ was gonna die when they shot this.  The quality of the footage varies.  Were they intending to release this before he died, or was this footage meant until then for internal consumption only?

I admit it's an interesting, though sanitized, look at what goes on behind the scenes during the preparation for a show like this.

But what disappointed me was that Michael's voice was shot.  His dancing was also lackluster.  Even the most unremarkable of his back-up stage dancers, could have totally killed him.  The guy was about 50 when this was shot, and this film makes it obvious he shouldn't have been singing and dancing that way anymore (noticeable and repeated breakings of his voice).

Plus, the choreography for the songs themselves was a major let-down, with a couple of exceptions (e.g., ""Thriller"").  Was that really what they were doing to do with ""Billie Jean""?  Wow.  And for ""Beat It""?  That's all they could come up with?",1282348800,2,1168,4.775

But the combination of dance, supporting cast and production value make this a wildly successful DVD even if he had not died.

Michael had a unique ability to tap into and express the universal human condition, and he did it prolifically for decades.  As a result, for millions of us, his being and his art became an integral part of us.  When he died, an important part of us, and what connects us all, died with him.

It was hard to watch, but I felt compelled to watch it.  In other words, this DVD wasn't meant for entertainment.  It was crafted with love, for the purpose of reminding us who Michael was and what he meant to us.  And it was crafted for the purpose of revealing where Michael was about to take us and what he wanted to share with us.

Truly, this is it, in so many ways ...",1278892800,2,883,4.171597633136095
3970647,4,B002R0EIVI,"The 2000 decade proved to be very harsh physically and emotionally for Michael Jackson, with bad press from start to finish, until the very end of his life on June 25th, 2009. He accused his label Sony and executive Tommy Mattola of racism, after failing to fairly promote his final album Invincible back in 2001, which was his lowest-selling on the label only striking double platinum. He was also tested, accused of child molestation from a targeted sting, which lead to a 2005 trial that he would be later cleared from all charges, and his private affairs financially from being in debt and his personal life were made in public in a heartbreaking manor. Yet, he was in desperate need of aid. He was set to go back to the stage for one last time in London for what was suppose to be his final tour called, This Is It. While the tour didn't happen because of his death, a movie that was around the tour came around due to the demands of his music selling again, and people pondering on what could've been from the departed King Of Pop.

Michael Jackson's This Is It which wasn't suppose to be released this way, but released because of the buying from Sony for $60 Million, focused on how hard Michael Jackson was making the attempt to comeback to the music industry, after years of public targeting that affected his career. The documentary focused on the special effects strongly from mini-movies he was making which centered around his songs from Thriller and the somber Earth Song, all the way to going back to basics with simple standard performances from his biggest hits including Man In The Mirror and Billie Jean. It was so amazing how much he wanted to make that try at the brass ring which didn't happen in the tragic way it could've. Michael's vocals also seemed a bit rusty in the film, and not up to the kind of razzle-dazzle he had from before, largely due to the absence from singing and touring for a longtime, and his body looked really fraille from the abuse he had gone thorugh. Yet, he was trying to build it up all over again very steadily, but it didn't happen to be that way from what could've been that July at the O2 Arena in London.

All in all, I honestly found it very difficult to watch This Is It, even one year after he sadly lost his life in the uproar that it caused that June 25th. Still, it is a delightful treat for hard core fans of Michael Jackson from start to finish. This Is It is a gripping glimpse of what made Michael Jackson a perfectionist at making what was suppose to be his last shows so strong. Kenny Ortega did a enduring and tough job, at putting the pieces of this film together, and through it all remains a great buy for King Of Pop fans young and old.

When I watch this, it always makes me get up and dance.  I've bought so many other DVD's that were a waste of money and I regret buying since I only watch it once and that's it, but this one - I'm really glad that I bought it.  Some of my friends complained that all this movie had was MJ dancing and singing and that it was boring because of that. . . When I heard them say that, besides thinking in my mind how foolish of a comment that was, if anything that made me feel simply sorry for them that they felt that way.  Some folks just don't understand what kind of influence MJ had to myself and a lot of other people out there.  This is worth watching over and over.

3970649,5,B002R0EIVI,"I can tell they put alot of care in making this. Its a good thing I didn't see this in theatres because everytime Michael Jackson starts singing I will be singing and dancing in my seat. This movie basically consist of Michael Jackson and his crew preparing for his new kick*** tour This Is It. Its very interesting seeing how michael works. You can tell hes a true musical genious. He knows exactly how he wants to go about things and how he wants his music played. To add icing to the cake this movie consist of just about every fan favorite including his newest song This Is It (I have the album too). I absolutely loved the new videos they made for Earth song and Thriller. I also love seeing the visuals the planned to have throughout the show. I do wish You Rock My World, Will You Be There, and Don't stop till you get enough were part of the concert. My favorite Mike song is Human Nature.

 One thing about Mike that makes him such a great entertainer is that he does 100% more than any artist I've ever seen in my 18 years. He doesn't just sing and dance on stage in front of a microphone, but he always puts on a puts on a show. You don't know what to expect while in other concerts like Beatles or rap concerts its just peaple singing on stage rarely moving around (Sorry Beatles fans I'm just not into them like that). You couldn't really blame Michael for not moving the way he used to he isn't as young as he was after all.

 I heard that before his death peaple had lined up and bought tickets ahead of time. I don't blame them because this would have probably been the greatest concert in history sinse I think his Dangerous tour which happened before I was born. Its sad that this will never be. I would have loved to make this my first concert in general, but saddly I will never get to see the King of Pop on stage. RIP Mike.",1278720000,,1845,4.203389830508475

3970653,5,B002R0EIVI,"I am a fan of MJ's going all the way back to the music from the early days of the Jackson Five. After being incredibly saddened by his untimely passing, I put off seeing this on cable for months. Partly because I was still mourning the loss of one of my childhood heroes. And partly because I didn't want to watch it and see a frail shadow of the man we knew in the 80's, performing old hits in poor voice and with half-a*s dancing. After all, the media had made it out to seem like he was on his last legs preparing for this tour, in horrible condition physically and musically. Ha, was I ever wrong, and so were his critics.

I watched this from start to finish and despite it's long length, I could have watched much more. This is truly mesmerizing- the MJ of the eighties was still there, but a new intensity and sultry attitude made him seem more powerful and enigmatic than ever. His backing musicians and especially his backup dancers are the best I've ever seen, and their complete love and devotion for MJ and the tour they were sadly never to embark on was obvious. Love poured out of this whole film- I've never seen such a group of talented, focused, dedicated people come together. It was extraordinary. The old hits were there- ""Stop the Love"" and ""I Want You Back"" from the Jackson 5 heyday. ""Billie Jean"", ""Beat It"" and ""Thriller"" (which included a fabulously remastered version of the Vincent Price ""rap""- I swear, it sounded like Vincent had come back to life it my living room, it was so crystalline and vibrant). A spectacular rendition of ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"" (never one of my favorites) had Michael singing better than he did on the ""Bad"" album, from which the song originally came. I couldn't believe what a fifty-year-old man was accomplishing vocally and in his dancing. There were more songs, but the standouts, which I did not at all expect, were ""They Don't Really Care About Us"" and ""Earth Song"". ""Earth Song"", especially, just got me down to the core. I had to fight back tears watching the indescribable video which was shot as a backdrop to this song, with MJ's lovely tenor singing lyrics that tore into me like a knife. Even writing this review, I find it hard not to recall what I watched without tears coming forth. The wonderful part was they played virtually every song in it's entirety, not just little snippets like some annoying DVD's of other singers. It really was like watching a whole MJ concert.

Michael's voice was clear and the high notes were sung as well as he ever had as an adult, maybe better. And the dancing, my God- Michael was as lithe, fit and magical as ever on stage. His trademark precision and flexibility were on full display and he showed no signs of aging other than saving his voice for the actual concert. If he was not up to par here, I would say it. The MJ I saw in this movie was clear-headed, with the same phenomenal and futuristic vision that made us all stop and watch his ground-breaking videos in the 80's. He wasn't at all the foggy-minded, lost soul the media portrayed- he was a loving but strong and decisive man on this ill-fated tour. Let me tell you- all the skeptics, the naysayers and liars would be silenced after watching this. I feel incredibly sorry for the people who worked so hard on a tour that would never come to be, a tour they thought would be the highlight of their career.

I will be buying this because I loved it so much, and hope the money goes to his wonderful children. Thank you, MJ, wherever you are, for this final gift. I hope your murderer spends the rest of his life rotting in prison, as was said in ""The Green Mile"", knowing he killed one of God's true miracles. May people remember you forever.

3970655,5,B002R0EIVI,"For me this was Heart wrenching to watch yet I somehow found the strength to watch a master at his best! I never had the chance to see MJ in concert so to me this is the best next thing.
Michael was simply out of this world...I truly believe he belonged to another realm...he was so misunderstood here on earth.
This movie not only proved the purpose of his being here which was to entretain the world through his art but also showed us a glimpse of the man...a man that was a human being just like all of us. I love you Michael you will always have a special place in my heart....miss you everyday! Your music will live on for centuries to come.",1277164800,,646,4.176
3970656,5,B002R0EIVI,"With a warm, beautiful smile, and a benevolent spirit, Director Kenny Ortega shares with us the dynamic footage of rehearsals for Michael Jackson's last concert, which was intended for Jackson's eyes only, but has now, like the life of Jackson himself, become a gift to the world, and especially to his children, with whom he had hoped to share his final performances.
  Amid the footage of auditioning dancers expressing delight at being able to work with Michael, and technichians demonstrating their craft, we see the King of Pop in full creative process, revamping his old numbers with gentle perfectionism and humour,leading his chosen troupe members in spirited dance moves.
  As a Generation Xer around for his entire career, my thoughts have flown back over the innumerable images of Michael Jackson that I've seen onscreen and in print on and off over the years since his passing. When he was at the height of his fame in the 80s, I was going through a passionately retro phase in my tastes in music, declining to behave like a card-carrying member of the MTV Generation, but I knew what Michael was up to, as did anyone who paid attention to entertainment news.
 We are led through performances of ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'"", ""Jam"", and ""Bad"", during which we view notable details of the stage interpretations, as a counterpoint to the iconic videos of the '80s and '90s. Original music for the concert was produced by Michael Bearden.
 Other numbers include ""They Don't Care About Us"", which within days, would become a rallying song for election fraud protesters in Iran, but which here is performed with a digitalized army, followed by a performance of ""Human Nature"".
 A film noir feature of ""Smooth Criminal"",in which Michael is shown responding to clips featuring Rita Hayworth and Humphrey Bogart, as well as a scene of the original 1988 short film version follows. M.J. makes a spectacular exit in that number.
  He struts with Mekia Cox during, ""The Way You Make Me Feel"", and revisits the dance moves in an urban setting that were a part of the video of this 1987 release.
 There are a few slip-ups, but as he noted, ""That's why we rehearse.""
 Then we are entertained by the numbers from the days of the Jackson 5, some of which Michael and his back-up performers sing in a different key from the originals. That medley includes, ""I Want You Back"", ""The Love You Save"", ""I'll Be There"", and a very energetically performed, ""Shake Your Body Down to the Ground"".
 Judith Hill joins him for ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"".
 The recreation of ""Thriller"" was thrilling indeed, and it really would have been  something to see Michael emerge from that giant tarantula during that number. The dancing ghouls really hit the mark. The applause of the audience at the end of that number would have been deafening had the concert series come to fruition!
  In creating the costumes, and designing the sets, viewers receive an education about how associations with aerialsts (including acrobat Dreya Weber), jewelers, and a few scientists to create special effects in both the costumes and the sets.
 ""Beat It!"" also evokes memories of the original video from the 80s, but with choreography last seen in Jackson's 2001 CBS Special.
  The Greek-Australian guitarist, Orianthi has her moment to shine during the rehearsal for the song, ""Black or White"",and she does so alongside fellow guitarist, Tommy Organ.
  Little Jasmine Alveran has a dramatic role to play during the rehearsal for ""Earth Song"", followed by the commentary about the state of the planet by the founder of the Heal the World Foundation--rather solemn musings by the man who held the Guinness World Record as the Most Humanitarian Entertainer for the last nine years of his life.
 ""Billie Jean"" still has the same verve as it did in the 80s, although frankly, I was never much for the crotch grab that he claimed was a subliminal gesture.
 Although slight and frail looking, Jackson certainly didn't move like a man of 50.
  ""Man in the Mirror"" is the last number performed onstage. The rehearsal ends on a favorable note.
 Within hours of that final rehearsal, eternal life greeted Michael as he was making other plans, much to the dismay of the world for which he did so much. But the final triumph is still his because of the unity, reverence, and love expressed in the wake of his loss. Within a little more than a week, Mekia Cox,Tyne Stecklein, Timor Steffens, et al  would show the world how to go on like troupers in Michael's absence as they danced on the dais above his casket, while Jennifer Hudson took masterful command of his gospel song, ""Will You Be There?""
 More people will see this footage of the final exquisite gift Michael intended to present to the world than would have ever been able to see him perform live.
 He was sharp, and at the top of his game until the very end--a supernova still at his brightest. And our film ends with a final laugh and a dance from the beloved entertainer.
 The final lines of ""September Song"" are what come to mind in the final analysis of this film: ""...And these few precious days I'll spend with you...These precious days, I'll spend with you.""
 All my gratitude goes to those who shared this precious footage with us!",1277164800,,5254,4.791574279379158

3970659,5,B002R0EIVI,"Coming up on the one year anniversary of Michael Jackson's death, one of the things to be thankful for is this fantastic tribute to one of the worlds great performers.  I really didn't know what to expect when Ortega and AIG announced this venture, I mean everybody knew that Jackson didn't get to ever perform this show live in London.  I, like many, thought, uh is this going to be some cut and paste job not worthy of the King of Pop?  I should have known that with the singular Ortega and the brilliant Branca involved that this would be spectacular: I was not disappointed.  From the start you feel Jackson's energy and his genius, you get chills as he goes acapela or courtiously let's everybody involved know that HE is running this show and he knows exactly what he wants.  I think even if Michael had lived, the world would have loved to have seen this backstage, unvarnished look at musical genius in action.  The world lost an icon last June, but in this DVD, you at least get one last glimpse of this supernova before it fades to black.  Highly recommended.",1276732800,4,1069,4.507772020725389
3970660,4,B002R0EIVI,"THIS IS IT is now all there is. Watching this film in the DVD format in the home strikes many chords for almost every viewer.  Michael Jackson's life was made far too public and this brief recording of the preparations for his final tour sets much straight about why he was such a remarkable talent. It allows us to forget all the raucous press that hounded him during his life and simply watch Michael Jackson doing what he did best - perform. Some of his gifts can be listed. Creative body language that permanently influenced dance movements both popular and classical. Articulation of his sensitivity to even the minor details of his performances. Total involvement in whatever he performed.  His genuine kindness in dealing with both his troupe of musicians and dancers as well as his producers/stagehands/publicists.  A mind that could push the edges of entertainment like few others. A seemingly indefatigable energy level while rehearsing. A genuine love for his audience and yes, for life.  One could wish that the DVD showed the completed THIS IS IT show as there couldn't have been more than one more day of rehearsals before is tragic death.  But maybe that will come later.  What this DVD preserves is the quality of uniqueness that was Michael Jackson.  Grady Harp, June 10",1276387200,,1287,4.876146788990826
3970661,4,B002R0EIVI,"I've probably written two-dozen reviews of music DVDs here on Amazon, and of all the music DVDs that I've seen, none were really like Michael Jackson's This Is It. The major difference between This Is It and the other music DVDs that I've seen is that the others are all live concerts; This Is It is footage of rehearsals and preparation for the tour that Jackson was to perform starting in July 2009...which of course never got started due to his untimely and quite tragic death.

Odd as Michael was (and looked), he truly was a musical genius....So many great songs over a span of half a century. And over the past 25 years Michael's life became part of pop culture and he was a captive to whatever the tabloids wanted to portray the guy as at any given time. What this film does is give you the opportunity to see Michael Jackson the performer and also a first hand look at the man behind the performer. And it turns out that two things are indeed confirmed: he was a musical genius and he was eccentrically odd.

To set the record straight, this impromptu documentary/concert DVD was never meant to be; the cameras and crew were apparently on set rehearsing themselves for filming of the first few actual shows. So what you ultimately get are very real and unrehearsed rehearsal sessions. And I gotta say, I wish that all of the music DVDs that I own or have watched included a behind the scenes rehearsal session. It's a very cool perspective to watch from. You not only get full or close to full performances of most of the songs, you see the real prep work that goes into performing each song and you get a glimpse at the personalities and camaraderie of the band, the performers/dancers and of course MJ.

The film's director Kenny Ortega is probably best known for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-School-Musical/dp/B001N6FPRS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High School Musical</a>&nbsp;movies. Kenny comes across like Michael's therapist. You know that guy Ben Stein with the monotone delivery? Ortega has the same droning voice and throughout This Is It Ortega can be heard comically talking like a child therapist to Michael as if to prevent him from having a tantrum. It's really amusing.

But the real fun is watching Jackson perform the songs that you probably grew up with. The band is really on, and Michael at age 51 still sang like an angel when he needed to and could rock with the rest when he wanted to. There are very few low (or boring) moments on the DVD; when it was over I was looking for more. But alas there was no more; only the realization that it was really over and that The King of Pop has left fans with a nice parting gift in this DVD.

He deserved better than this end, and yet this end will remain some historic moment in popular music, maybe not the one he was dreaming of but one historic moment anyway.

I have been a fan of Michael Jackson all my life, from the age of three to an adult now. I never doubted him because I know his heart and I know his spirit. I didn't need to know him personally. His music told me who he was. He was a beautiful person, inside and out. I was not going to be one to judge about his appearance, when I didn't walk in his shoes. As watch this footage, I see what a hardworker, perfectionist and genius he was. He was more than just the greatest entertainer of the world. He was a humanitarian, that no one, not even the negative media, praise him for. The press coverage was about his personal life, his appearance and controveries.
The tragedy of his untimely death has made me realize how short life is. To me, most people told him for granted when he was alive and some still do now that he's gone. I hope Michael is finally at peace. I will miss him, but his legacy was always live from the heart of his fans. Rest In Peace to the King of Pop.

The film itself is more home movie than documentary; comments from the show staff come later in the extras.

I hadn't followed Jackson's life for years and assumed he was past his prime, but this film completely changed my opinion.  I was mesmerized by his energy and stamina, his gracefulness and power, and his absolute knowledge of what was right for the show.  He looked to be in the best shape of his life and happy to be mounting his last tour.

3970669,4,B002R0EIVI,"This DVD made me so sad that Michael Jackson died. What I noticed most about ""THIS IS IT"" is how thin and frail he looked. He pushed himself, obviously, but you could see he was struggling to offer the same amount of energy the much younger dancers had. In some dance sequences he barely dances (moves his arms and legs kind of half-heartedly, like afraid to do too much); sometimes he was robotic; and throughout he never sings, just lip syncs though all the songs. It's almost painful to watch, knowing that he was tricked into doing 50 shows when he was not up to it. He wasn't performing because he loved it and missed it, but because he had enormous debts. This was not a happy man, and now the company is trying to recoup their ticket losses by selling ""what might have been"". Well, judging by this video, what ""might have been"" might have been worse - suppose MJ had collapsed on stage during one the performances and died? He tries so hard in this video I can believe it happening - he didn't want to disappoint the fans. The other sad thing is the interviews with other dancers, all of whom are soooo enthusatic and excited about working with MJ. Sadly, they all lost their jobs when MJ died. After all those months of training, that was awful. That was hard to watch too. It was too sad. But as films go, this concert film feels raw and thrown together - it's the sight of seeing MJ in his final performance that is the focus. Years later, when the grief has subsided, I'm sure others will see this as a rushed concert film, not particularly well-made or well-edited.",1273708800,,1577,4.422680412371134

Not only is this an excellent concert performance, but it offers a look at just how much of a perfectionist Michael was, and shows that the man really did know his stuff when it came to music. He wasn't a performer who let everyone do their thing while he did his couple of tasks. No, Michael took part in every single aspect of the show. Music, lighting, effects, visuals, costumes, the guy made sure everything was perfect, and you have to admire that. Had he lived to do the performances he was rehearsing for on this disc, I think it very well could've been the greatest tour ever. All those people who flew across the world just to get tickets, and those who payed an ungodly amount for them...they definitely would've gotten their money's worth.

This Is It, in case you still didn't know, is almost an entire concert performance. It's rehearsals for what would've supposedly been Michael's final tour, and he was pulling out all the stops to make it the ultimate concert. It starts out with the main dancers being selected, out of hundreds, and we get to see how happy each and every person is to even have a chance to dance with the master himself. Each person that gets screen time to talk about how important MJ was to them is genuine, and you can't help but feel happy for these kids when they get selected. After that, it quickly gets into the main show, and you're treated to almost all of Michael's biggest hits. While the performances recorded aren't finished, since it's just rehearsals, they included a lot of the visuals that would've been shown on the big screen behind everyone, and work the lighting as well. Not every song goes through without interruption- there are times when Michael stops or re-does certain parts because he felt it could've been better, or if a light didn't go off at the right moment. I can't stress it enough- the guy wanted everything to be perfect for this show. There are also some semi-backstage bits where Michael works with the band and lets them know what the exact tone and rhythm is that he wants for x song at x point in time. You can tell when he gets frustrated, but MJ manages to keep his cool most of the time.

My only complaint is one that's pretty small, and something I understand, and it's that Michael doesn't perform much while singing, as far as his facial expressions and arm movements go. Watch his videos for Beat It, Bad and a few other classics, and then see him perform the songs here and you'll see what I mean. Regardless, I enjoyed every minute of this show. The little movie he made for Smooth Criminal was great, and I think I would've lost it if I were in attendance, had the show went on. What impressed me the most was the plan for Thriller, and how zombies would've been flying over the audience. How could you NOT want to be there for something like that? I know this review seems one-sided with how much praise I'm giving it, but this really is an excellent documentary/concert, and it deserves the high ratings it has. They never make this a MJ tribute, and focus on his death. In fact, they don't touch on it at all except a tiny bit at the end. I'm glad they did that.

Visually, it doesn't get much better. The show is presented in 1080p and looks spectacular. Even with 'just' footage from rehearsals, everything looks amazing, and it makes you wonder why more backstage footage doesn't look this good. The audio is a treat for the ears too- presented in 5.1 DTS-HD MA. There are subtitles in English and French, but 75% of this is songs that everyone getting it should know by now, even if they don't speak the same language.

The special features are minimal, but still great. The extras for both the blu-ray and dvd include 2 documentaries and 3 featurettes. One for finding the dancers, one- Memories of Michael that's pretty touching, and then another for the costumes used in the show. The blu-ray gets some exclusive extras though: Thriller and Smooth Criminal vignettes, the making of the Smooth Criminal vignette, and then the blu-ray live fare. I don't know if Kenny Ortega is one of those directors who chooses to let the film speak for itself, but I would've liked it if he had done a commentary track with stories from the set. But as it is, I'm happy with what's here.

Every Michael Jackson fan should see this at least once in their life. I bought it without seeing it prior, and it was a good choice. While not every one of his biggest hits is performed on here, you're still getting a lot of them. And to see MJ dance just as good as he did when he was younger, that's worth admission on its own right there. The man was amazing, and seeing how he is on here when talking to his dancers, stagehands, band members, and everyone else, you get the feeling that he could never hurt anyone, and wasn't bitter even after the media messes he was in. So don't be a smooth criminal, just buy This Is It today.",1273622400,3,5174,4.453586497890296

Knowing how much of a perfectionist MJ was, he would have not approved of some specifics in this documentary like the lighting, the sound quality,some of the shots of himself, etc. However, I look at this DVD as an autograph for my collection.

I am so pleased to have seen this video and to remember Michael how he really was instead of the warped and cynical picture painted by the press.,1272758400,,450,4.125

3970680,5,B002R0EIVI,"I have done a fair number of musical reviews in this space from old country blues tunes to Cole Porter to Billy Holiday to Bob Dylan and so on. All either reflected my personal interests or represented a segment of, mainly, American cultural expression that I thought was important to take note of. Some groups and individuals like the Beatles, most, but not all, hip-hop, Joan Baez and others have gotten short shrift in this space not because they are not important components of the modern cultural scene but out of sheer personal preference. The late performer, Michael Jackson, with or without the Five, fit very comfortably in that niche for me. No longer though after viewing the film documentary, although performance is a better term, """"This Is It"", based on rehearsals for what was to be Michael Jackson's last world tour.

I am not sure, and in any case it is not important to this review, whether the film footage here would have seen the light of day if Michael Jackson had not died in 2009. The core of the film is a series of rehearsals that Jackson and his cast of singers, dancers, and musicians went through in preparation for a ""This Is It"" last Jackson world tour that was planned to begin just after his untimely death. The concept, according to Jackson, was to give his fans one last extravagant chance to hear and see him perform his greatest hits.

Now these kinds of world tours, last ones or not, are all in a day's work in the entertainment business. As are behind-the scenes ""reality"" looks at how certain cultural events are put to together. What make this film extraordinary are the fire, the imagination, and the sheer stage presence that Michael Jackson brought to the whole enterprise.

Did you read that right? This reviewer, who has spend the last forty or some years happily ignoring Michael Jackson, his music, his dancing, his off-stage antics, and his legal difficulties  was totally transfixed, totally riveted by Jackson's work here. In rehearsal, of all places. Christ, as the headline indicates, he is probably one of few men who have ever lived who did not turn into a cartoonish character while wearing orange pants during some of his numbers. Although this film also demonstrates the very deferential way in which those who worked with him treated him, which may be a key to some of his off-stage problems going back to his childhood days, and I am positive I would not want to work with him this man, as singer, dancer and stage personality comes through. This kind of personality does not pass through this earth all that often. Watch what you missed. Watch what I missed.",1272153600,,2620,4.726477024070022

My only dislike about this is that as a MJ dvd especially being that this would be his last live footage before he died, the makers should of included an insert to make it memorable but there was not an insert. i would of appreciated a poster, or even a booklet like what is given in many cds but i guess I can't be too picky. either way it is a must have if you are a fan or a collector.",1272067200,,558,3.769230769230769

3970684,5,B002R0EIVI,"I watched The Jackson 5 when I was around 8 or 9 on TV. I recently became interested in his life.(After his death) I felt a lot like he did. Without all the details of my life, I really,really wanted to see this DVD,This Is It. I received the 2 disc version for my birthday. I am now 42 and I was totally taken aback with how honest,loving and just plain brilliant Michael was. I also purchased MOONWALK,with the new foreword and afterword. Loved that too.
  I ordered a few more things about him and was actually sad that I never got a chance to see him on one of his tours. Truthfully, I am not the type to ever think about any sort of a star in any capacity other than to comment on their work. So, I was stunned that I didn't watch anything about him.
  I really, really hope that everyone that liked or loved Michael Jackson buys This Is It and just watch all of the work that went into his shows. It trully is breathtaking!! Lynn",1271980800,,935,4.149171270718232

3970687,5,B002R0EIVI,"Maybe my three year old knows other songs but I don't think he currently cares about anyone else's songs other than Michael Jackson.

My wife has MJ's songs on her cell phone and quite frankly, he knows how to work her cell phone better than I do!  And to put this into perspective, when I was a little tike, I grew up with the Jackson Five and idolized MJ myself but I knew others that were popular as well.  The Yellow Submarine, Come On Baby Light My Fire, Bridge Over Troubled Water, It's a Family Affair come to mind along with Ben, ABC, Give Me One More Chance etc (Not necessarily the actual titles but what come to my mind when I think back on those days.

Maybe because it was music that was popular with older brothers and sisters or parents but my son again, is crazy about MJ and MJ only!  So we pick up this DVD at the local movie rental and my son is in his favorite place, watching and listening to MJ perform and low and behold, I'm feeling like I did when I watched him perform as a child myself!

Michael Jackson indeed was a talent the likes of which, the world hasn't ever seen and will not see again.  But this also shows you his technical side or better put, his ""Perfectionist"" side.  Something I didn't realize was how involved he was in every aspect of his performances from the dance moves, to singing, to how the music was played and his influence on making it ""JUST RIGHT"" for the benefit of his fans.

We rented this but I am adding it to my list of things to buy.  It's a keeper!  Not only for my three year old but for everyone in this home that loves Michael Jackson and that's all of us.  In my opinion anyone that is a true MJ fan who hasn't viewed this, is doing themselves a great disservice.  This certainly is it!

A fitting capture of the legends last performances even if he was just practicing and which displays how remarkably talented he truly was!  (Practice for Michael was like a boxer in a way, he would leave it all in the ring or on the punching bag so to speak meaning, when he practiced, it was like he was performing for the entire world.  I am sure there are those that were in attendance that were left feeling the same as untold millions were left feeling when he performed for live audiences, I was---

It was sort of disgusting to see all his dancers and the ""tour manager""? just bow down to his feet.  I guess that goes hand and hand in the entertainment field, the kissing of bootie, all about the $$$.  Most of the performances were gr8, but I had 2 fast forward some of the content towards the end, it just went on 4 2 long.  By they time they got 2 Beat It, I was sort of done, I got the picture.  I'm sure the dancers were completley devastated by his passing, knowing they went thru all that 4 nothing.  But they seemed super phony anywayz so I didn't care either way.  I still think Prince is a better overall entertainer than Michael jackson.  He never seems 2 garnish any respect like MIchael Jackson, even tho he's a MUSICIAN.",1271376000,,928,4.174157303370786

Having grown up with Michael's music from childhood, the songs are timeless and poignant. You remember them all, and each one can fill you with memories and emotion. They are still fresh and are magnificent pieces of art. Michael still had all of his talent and more... his voice and dancing were amazing. We are very fortunate that the rehearsals were filmed! The editing is also excellent as different rehearsals were mixed together to form a ""tapestry"" of a song. MJ's pursuit of perfection is seen throughout the film. His brilliance in picking his back-up band and dancers is obvious. All of them were 110% behind him and their talent, as well as enthusiasm, is evident and infectious to watch; they always seem to exude ""I can't believe I'm here with MJ"". The band nailed every song and they all sounded identical to the album work. In the end, there is a definite sadness at knowing we will not see his talent again. I am truly sorry he is gone. He came alive on stage and that's where he has always belonged.",1269302400,2,1153,4.495238095238095

Michael WAS in the PRIME of HIS LIFE and his death will forever be a tragedy but we THANK THE LORD for sharing Michael with all the World for 51 years! I will miss him more than my husband, who is 5 years younger than me. I am 6 months younger than Michael and grew up with the Jackson 5 and ALL OF THEIR GLORY. MICHAEL JACKSON WILL ALWAYS BE ALIVE IN MY HEART AND HE IS THE WORLD'S GREATEST ENTERTAINER THAT EVER LIVED. And thanks to modern technology, we have all those great years on tape, rather video or audio! GOD BLESS YOU MICHAEL, AND YOUR CHILDREN, BE PROUD, HE WAS A DECENT AND GOOD MAN! THE HEAVENS HAVE NEVER SOUNDED SWEETER THAN WITH MICHAEL, THE KING OF POP AND ELVIS PRESLEY, THE KING OF ROCK!",1269302400,,1101,4.314009661835748
3970714,5,B002R0EIVI,"I was a fan of Michael Jackson from the time he sang with his brothers.  I watched his career all my life.  ""This is it"" shows how brilliant Michael was and what a performer he was.  It amazed me to watch how much energy he put into each performance even though it was just ""dress rehearsal"".  His voice is not as strong as it was in years past but I feel that the reason was that this was just a rehearsal.  You can see what a perfectionist he was because he wanted to make sure every note and step showed what he wanted the audience to see.  I loved watching Michael doing what he did best--performing.

The reason I hated it is the fact that we will never see him do this again.  What a loss to the entertainment industry. Have tissues handy when watching the DVD because the realization comes to you that this really is it for Michael Jackson.",1269302400,,847,4.217391304347826
3970715,5,B002R0EIVI,"As usual, the purchase from Amazon was great with free shipping.  This DVD of Michael is FABULOUS.  I didn't expect the rehearsals to be so elaborate.  It was if it were a concert.  Michael had not lost a thing in the 10 years since he had last preformed.  He was excellent with his singing and dancing. It was also nice to see how a rehearsal for a tour is conducted and the many people that it takes to do a production like this.  It was also almost 2 hours long and it is so nice to have this DVD, watch it whenever I want in the convenience of my home as opposed to going to the movie theatre and seeing it once.  The DVD was the same price as going to the theatre.  A good purchase.  We will definitely miss Michael Jackson as he was without a doubt one of best entertainers of all time.  It is a shame that he was so misunderstood.",1269216000,,837,4.048780487804878
3970716,3,B002R0EIVI,"There's really only one song worth buying this cd for, otherwise just get his albums which are much better. I guess this is for people new to Michael, but I'm sure all his diehard fans that have everything he's ever made are buying this one as well when they don't really need it.",1269216000,,280,4.30188679245283

3970718,4,B002R0EIVI,"Even though it represents the name of the concert tour, the film's title is a bit of a misnomer because it's more accurate to say this could have been it. Nine months after his death, Michael Jackson is unlikely to move anywhere close to obscurity soon. As the first post-mortem tribute to his legacy, this 2009 documentary, filmed at the Staples Center in LA and directed by choreographer Kenny Ortega (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dirty-Dancing/dp/B0000DIXDR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dirty Dancing</a>), is testament to an idiosyncratic talent driven by an even more amazing level of dedication made up of equal parts anxiety and intuition. In fact, it is his perfectionism that will remain in your memory more than the quality of his performance here, which was never meant to be in a commercial film. For the most part, he sings half-heartedly in order to save his voice for the real shows, but what we do see is Jackson as the master orchestrator of the concert experience.

Throughout the 112-minute running time, Jackson never looks like he's taking any aspect of his performance for granted. Rather, he becomes a rather human presence who knows when the music is off a beat or when a dance move is not quite right. A particularly insightful scene occurs when he stands over the keyboard of the show's musical director and tries to coax a specific note out of him. If Barbra Streisand said ""I just want to hear it the way I wrote it"", she would have been accused of diva behavior, but Jackson manages to say it without malice in a way that shows how little it takes for him to make such a demand. There is no doubt who is in charge of the concert, and Ortega often seems to kowtow to Jackson like a personal assistant until the performer's enjoyment on a cherry-picker brings out the watchful parent in the director.

Judging from Jackson's clothing, the footage appears to capture him on three separate occasions during the rehearsals, and you can see him rethinking each familiar song with something new like a proposed fiery ending to ""Beat It"" a la Jimi Hendrix. Even though some of his performances are ragged, even unpolished, there are key highlights to savor such as Jackson's a capella version of ""Human Nature"", a genuinely edgy take on ""Black or White"" complete with a sharp guitar solo from Orianthi Panagaris, and the film noir treatment of ""Smooth Criminal"" with his fedora-wearing character melding into archival footage of Rita Hayworth (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gilda/dp/B00004XPPK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gilda</a>) and Humphrey Bogart (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Big-Sleep/dp/B000FFJYA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Big Sleep</a>). In fact, several of the numbers come with mini-movies like a Tim Burton-influenced take on ""Thriller"" and a bucolic fantasyland for ""Earth Song"". Interview snippets featuring musicians, singers, choreographers and costume designers are interspersed throughout.

In the end, the film feels like an elaborate home movie of a worshipped performer who refuses to rest on his laurels and instead wants to show his relevance for the next generation. Although painfully thin and with an overly reconstructed face, Jackson doesn't give any indication of his pending death in the footage, and I'm sure that was quite deliberate given his family had approval of the final cut. It's worth seeing for what could have been quite a sensational concert comeback. The 2010 DVD contains six featurettes that focus on various aspects of the production; showcase two of the mini-movies in their entirety, ""Thriller"" and ""Smooth Criminal""; and present a post-mortem tribute from those who worked with him in those final weeks.",1269216000,2,3804,5.465986394557823
3970719,5,B002R0EIVI,"I went to see ""This Is It"" in the movie the day it came out and another time after that. I will say that I loved every minute of it. I have been a Michael Jackson fan since day one. This man put his life in his music and what he was planning for his comeback concerts would of been amazing. His tours just kept getting better. I honestly believe that this tour would of made it to the United States and it would been my favorite of all his tours. My favorite tour by Michael is ""The Dangerous Tour"". These are rehearsal footages, he is not on point because it is rehearsal. In this movie, you can tell what kind of person Michael is, deep inside. He was so humble, loving, and caring. Looks like he never got angry with his employees, during certain songs, he would ask to ""let's try it one more time"", ""that's ok, thats why we have rehearsal"", and he was so funny at times ""putting more booty into it"". Michael has always been one of my favorites and he will always remain of my favorites.

1. Wanna Be Startin Somethin
This song was included on all of his solo tours and the Jacksons ""Victory Tour, opening the tours on the ""Victory Tour"" and ""Bad Tour"". It was the second song on setlist on the ""Dangerous Tour"" and fourth song on the ""History Tour"". Since there was no new album, this is the perfect way to start the show, ""with a bang"". You can tell how happy he is to be back on stage again, he enjoyed what he was doing. It's hard to believe this guy was 50 years old. During the break of the song, he sings an accapella version of ""Speechless"", from the 2001 album ""Invincible"". Here you can see how pure and beautiful Michael's voice is. After, you see dancer auditions and how Michael always wanted the best of the best and thats exactly what he recieved.

2. Jam
The last time Michael performed this was on the ""Dangerous Tour"". He puts alot of energy into this song, the rap part of the song is cut short but still the rehearsal was still great. Showing ideas of using ""the toaster"", from what he used on the ""Dangerous Tour"". I had heard that Michael was supposed to be play a montage of the ""Jam"" video on the big screens on the back. He even did the break of the song chreography correct, it was well on packed. He includes a snippet of ""Another Part Of Me"" in the song, during the break of the chereography.

3. They Don't Care About Us
This had to have been one of my favorite parts of the show, with the new video made of 100,000 army soliders, which was only 10 dancers multiplied. Michael put alot of energy into this song and this where you can see him behind the scences working with several producers, trying to get it perfect. I love how at the beginning of the song, he has the military chreography, which just brillant!! Towards the end of the performance, he includes a snippet of the songs ""Why You Wanna Trip On Me?"" & ""She Drives Me Wild"". Which I am glad he included a snippet of those songs.

4. Human Nature
This song is one of favorite Michael Jackson songs of all time. He used his vocals hard on this song and it would of came out great. He shows off newer dance moves, which you've never seen him do before. During the middle of the song, he goes into the silence of the song and comes back with ""until the night time"", and finshes the rest of the song.

5. Smooth Criminal
This was my favorite part of the show. Not only he digitally puts himself in the movie ""Gilda"" while Ray Hayworth sings ""Put the Blame On Me"", its in 3D as well. You can see how he was a true artist, because he would feel the video turn the city scence. You can still tell that Michael had it in him, after all he had been through. Even though the ""lean"" was not rehearsed, it was supposed to be in part of the actual show.

6. The Way You Make Me Feel
Right before the actual rehearsal of the song, you see Michael really at work. Telling the musical director, it has to sound ""like I wrote it, how the record plays and how the audience hears it"". Like ""your dragging yourself out of bed"". As the tone gets right, he makes sure the growl comes at his command, and not automatically. He wants it to ""let it simmer"" and let it bay in the moonlight"". As the song starts, his dancers climb down from a 3-D skyscraper and Michael comes out in his ""signature"" blue shirt, follows a girl around and ends it with the original chereography from the video, Michael still had it. I loved that part of the song.

7. I Want You Back/The Love You Save/I'll Be There
Michael goes back old school with the Jackson 5 hits and you can see that he loves it, because of the huge smile on his face. The only thing is that he ask if the sound can be brought down lower because of the inner ears, when Michael last toured, he was just used to of the human ear volume. When ""I'll Be There"" was sang, I believe just about everyone in theater got chills down there spine. Honestly, I would say it almost brought tears to my eyes. Michael was just so humble. At the end of the song, he named ""Jackie, Marlon, Tito, Jermaine,Randy"" and I love You. Joseph and Katherine, I Love You.

8. Shake Your Body (Down To The Ground)
Even though there was not any real vocals done here, the chereography was great. During the song, there was a snippet of ""Don't Stop Till You Get Enough"" included.

9. I Just Can't Stop Loving You
Michael was so humble and great person. He was so comical as well, towards the beginning of the song he started to sing it in Spanish. The song was a duet with one of the back up singers. The song came out great and he put so much passion into his performance. At the end of the song, he stated ""I have to save my voice"", and the band told him ""you better sing boy"". Makes you laugh.

10. Thriller
This was just an awesome part of the movie, the entire video was re-shot and was put in graphics ahead of it's time. Towards the end of the song, a black widow spider comes out on stage and what do you know, Michael pops out of it. It was brillant! He starts out with the main chereography from ""Thriller"". At the end of the song, it includes a snippet of the song ""Ghosts"" from the ""Blood On The Dance Floor"" album and also a snippet from the song ""Threatened"" from the album ""Invincible"".

11. Beat It
Another brillant part of the show! With the fire chasers, it was just amazing! The fire works at the beginning, it was just amazing. He performs the classic chereography to the song and it comes out great, he performs the second verse of the song. He ends it with. ""let it burn, lights out"". He was supposed to take off his jacket, set it on fire, and lights out. Michael was just pure genius!

12. Black Or White
I just loved this part, Michael looked like he was enjoying this part as well. Another part of the movie, where you know Michael was a true perfectionist. He started it all over, ""wanted to try it one more time"". On the back screens, you can see the original video playing and at the end of the song, it ends with a new hard rock encore.

13. Earth Song
This was amazing! A new 3D video was created and where you can hear Michael talk about the planet, it's really touching to hear him talk. Michael was so commited to healing the world, and he wasn't fake at all about it. The song was suppose to end with a large tractor coming on state and, in his words ""when that doors opens in silence, you start that piano"".

14. Billie Jean
Aww, what can I say what hasn't been said before. Pure genius! Michael was enjoying this song and at the end he told the dancers ""that's just a preview of what you'll get for now"" He did not do his signature moonwalk, he was saving it for the actual shows. Michael was full of energy on this song.

15. Man In The Mirror
The perfect song to end with, he ended his ""Bad & Dangerous Tours"" with this song. It was going to end perfectly, with the 3D ""MJ Air"" video, and it would of been just brillant show.

I recommend getting this movie, because it is just brillant and will make you want more and more. I hope they do release the rehearsal footage for the other songs that were rehearsed, such as ""Rock With You"", ""Dirty Diana"", ""You Rock My World"", ""Heal The World"", ""Dangerous"", ""You Are Not Alone"", & ""Will You Be There?"". You also get the bonus features, which includes interviews with all the cast and you can view all the costumes Michael was supposed to wear on the tour.

3970720,5,B002R0EIVI,"You don't have to be a Michael fan to realize the talent he had in everything that he did.  He had vision both on and off stage when it came to the creativity that made his shows and videos so fantastic.  This last performance was going to be completely brilliant.  One really interesting aspect was the black and white of Rita Hayworth and the gangster three-D of him sliding down the stairs.  How was that going to happen?  He was the ""Smooth Criminal"" :-).  He knew when to make songs ""simmer"" and to make his dancing ""sizzle"" to slow things down to make the crowd go wild.  We will never know just how fantastic these last concerts were going to be, unfortunately, but at least we got a glimpse into the perfectionist Michael was and how he became so popular and famous for his songs, his dancing, his shows and his complete talent.",1269043200,,836,4.42483660130719
3970721,5,B002R0EIVI,"This Is It is more than a concert.  It gives a feel for what his last concert might have been like, but it also takes you through a bit of the creative process for each performance that was being created.  It gets to the heart of what Michael was like at work.  You walk away with the feeling that you really know a little bit more about what Michael was like, not just what you've been blasted with by the media.  You meet some of the finest dancers in the world.  You see ground breaking special effects that have never been used in a concert before and it makes you wonder who will now be the first to incorporate these things into a live show since Michael didn't have the opportunity to share them while he was alive.  It is great to see Michael Jackson, not at the end of his career, but at the top of his game.  One of the great movies of 2009 even if the Academy didn't include it among their considerations as a nominee.",1269043200,,929,4.156424581005586

3970724,5,B002R0EIVI,"So glad that they released this DVD, even though it was only rehearsals.  Truly showed how he was & was totally in control of these concert/performances.  This DVD answered a lot of questions for a lot of people, Plus gave us some closure as well.  He was abused most of his life & never had a childhood. He was very good at performing & nobody could take his place. He was a wonderful man & a wonderful father.  That loved his children, life MUSIC, family, Earth, Trees, Animals and especially HIS true devoted FANS!

Thanks for releasing THIS IS IT ON DVD,
it was very well put together.

Thanks for the memories Michael, you are gone now,
but will NEVER BE FORGOTTEN!
You made a difference here and hope that will continue on.
You always gave, gave & gave.
and all you got was HURT, HURT, AND HURT!
You are finally at peace now.  We will all love & miss you.
Your are Forever In Our Hearts!
YOUR MUSIC & VIDEOS ARE STILL THE BEST & always will be!
Love you Michael!
Thanks to the Jackson Family & AEG for the release of ""THIS IS IT""!"" REMARKABLE!

Thanks to the Jackson Family for letting the fans be a part of his memorial service. It really gave us closure and was very well done. Thanks Jermaine for all that you are doing for Michael.
All is appreciated!
Jackson Family, So sorry for your loss.
The whole world grieves with you!
When Michael passed on, part of all of us went with him.
And it has almost been a year gone by already &
it just seems like it was yesterday.

THIS IS IT, ISN'T A RENTAL, BUT AS A PURCHASE.
10 GOLDEN STARS! TWO THUMBS UP!
That would have been some concert!  WOW!
GREAT JOB MICHAEL!",1268956800,,1617,4.272131147540984

I feel so sorry for the artists that rehearsed so long and hard then did not get to open the show. BUT  these artists will remember MJ and rehearsals for the rest of their lives, not just for the time spent with him but now they have this special DVD. Everyone (onstage with him) loved him it is obvious

IF you are thinking of buying this and cannot decide  Do  It!

Michael I had forgotten you before seeing this dvd, but your light NEVER dimmed... YOU are the best and no one can top you as far as talent, being a wonderful caring human being and loving the Planet :-)>

It will make you want to jump and shout and laugh and cry. It really shows that he was a perfectionist when it came to his work. It also showed what a wonderful humanitarian he was.

All I have to say is that May God Bless his children, family, and those that were close to him. If you do not like Michael, I guarantee it that you will end up loving him after watching this!!

You cannot ""BEAT IT"" because it is not that ""BAD"" because it is quite a ""THRILLER"" to have in your DVD collection to watch over and over.

I enjoyed it as I had never seen MJ in concert. He was a charismatic performer in the league of Mick Jagger and James Brown. I watched the DVD with the subtitles on because even though I knew MJ was a fantastic singer, I could never understand his lyrics. Oh My God they have got to be some of the worst lyrics I've ever heard! Not GENIUS material. He did allot of repeating a certain phrase over and over. ""Dance in the Round""  ""Annie Annie Annie"" . I never listened to him after he got way crazy with the plastic surgeries and other exploits. He was such a good looking guy. He really did not want to look like Papa Joe.

I was torn about going to see This Is It in the theatre.  I felt as if it was too soon and all about money, not quite the tribute  Michael deserved.  After all with all the tours Michael Jackson went on he never released a substantial amount of behind the scenes footage.  I think he always liked to keep the illusion alive. Anyway I gave in to my own curiousity and I must say I was mixed with emotion.  It was fascinating to see how much of a perfectionist he was and what dedication went into his perfomances. At the same time it saddened me that this really was it.  I would never have the priviledge again, to see him in his element, on stage.  I hold onto those great memories I have of seeing him on the Bad Tour and with the Jackson Five in the seventies.

3970744,5,B002R0EIVI,"NOW at least you have a High Definition Blu-Ray version of this extraordinary entertainer that is no longer with us. The amount of  attention Michael devotes to detail, color, moves, music, dance, story telling plus the bonus that this whole production was an out growth of his wanting to leave a legacy to his 3 children on his tour capabilities, will leave you absolutely breathless. He was indeed a ONE of a kind legend in his own time. There's lots of bonus materials on the life, hits, music videos and achievements of Michael Jackson including those that were not a part of the original 2009 movie theater performance on the BD format. Also last but not least, the 5.1 surround sound will give your entertainment center a real workout and then some.",1268006400,,755,4.71969696969697

3970746,5,B002R0EIVI,"What can you say but brilliant on every level. At six years old my mother gave me my first Jackson 5 album and it was pretty much a done deal after that and at 7 my sister took me to my first J5 concert. The man has been in my life ever since and fans of Mike know what thats like. I preorderd my tickets for This Is It and was at the first show the day it opened. I felt like I did at the end of every Michael concert happy free and that love is all around me, then I remembered he wasn't here any more and I was sad. In the same instance I got one more glimpse into his genius and I was happy again.
Even in rehersals he is still the man in control, knows what he wants
The behind the scene footage is good. Out of the five or so featurettes Remembering Michael is the best.
This Is It would have been one of the greatest concerts ever not because I am a fan of Michael's but a fan of music.
That even after all he has been through the man still manages to be generous with his craft and willing to still inspire others to be all they can in this life. He knew the opportunity that he had in his life normal folks couldn't get to but if you where in his life he made sure that you wouldn't give up on your dream. What an amazing man. What an amazing talent. You get to see both with This Is It. Even if your not a Michael fan. You should have it in your collection.",1268006400,,1367,3.833922261484099

The movie gives one a glimpse of the hard work behind the glorious shows that one sometimes take for granted. What the movie reveals is a magnificent MJ at his best (in full control & as nimble as ever despite being 51 years old) & his ernomous drive to deliver a performance of a lifetime! Sadly this was not to be, but this movie shows beyond any shadow of doubt how great MJ was as a live performer and dancer! A great must be DVD collection for all music lovers, young & old. A well made movie with unbelievable rehearsal performances by Michael Jackson!",1267920000,2,703,4.333333333333333
3970749,5,B002R0EIVI,"I loved this movie all 18 times I saw it at the cinema during its limited run, and I have seen the single disc edition of the DVD.  The advantage with this 2-disc edition is the additional behind the scenes extras you get on the second disc, which focus on the dancers and musicians that were a part of Michael Jackson's This Is It show.  The Unfinished Rehearsals segment is a real treat, as it provides our first glimpse of the staging for ""Dirty Diana"" which was never rehearsed to the same level as the songs that we see Michael performing in the movie.

For MJ fans, two discs are definitely better than one.  I just wish that the other extras that are only available on the Blu-Ray version [ASIN:B002UD56I6 Michael Jackson: This Is It [Blu-ray]]could have been included on this double DVD set as well.  So... I'll just have to invest in a Blu-Ray player!",1267920000,,860,4.487179487179487

I was heartbroken at his passing.
Kenny Ortega's brillant film brought me to tears in the theater.
the DVD did the same.
It was noted that MJ said
""At 50 I'm young enough to do This is It and my children are old
enough to see it.""
There is no greater tribute for his children and his fans.",1267747200,,333,3.985074626865672

3970757,5,B002R0EIVI,"We're so lucky someone had the foresight to tape these rehearsals, otherwise we would have had nothing.

The sound is terrific, the stage is second only in size and scope to Pink Floyd's stadium sets. This was truly an ambitious undertaking. MJ was using the largest 3-D screen in the world as his back drop. There was not a clunker song in the set. The musicians were incredible and so were the dancers and all the crew.

The songs we've heard before; his hits. MJ doesn't like to vary too much from the album versions but the musicians are allowed to embellish it a little and the songs truly sound fresh and vigorous.

MJ's moves are super natural. He was a god of entertainment, a most fully realized performer.

He got down. The band rocked. He's the funk master. He's hypnotic and mesmerizing to watch...crank this up on a good sound system and be prepared to be swept away.

Everybody else is just sloppy seconds. He was The Man!

If all you've ever seen of MJ are his music videos then you need to see this. I'm a musician and believe it or not was never too impressed with his music videos since they have to be lip-synched and you can stop and start the filming and edit out mistakes.

I truly became a fan of Michael when I saw him perform live in 2001 at the Madison Square Garden 30th anniversary of his solo career show. That was live so I could tell that he can really move like that and it's not just video magic.

This show is live rehearsal and they are pretty much ready to go. They are just fine tuning so you get to see the band and MJ in excellent form.

He does the robot dance, does a dance where it looks like he's driving a car.. He moves like liquid lightning.

Every song was a universe on to itself

During the song ""Human Nature"" he does these really squirrely moves that didn't seem to make sense to me at all but then all of sudden he kicks into this high note and it all makes sense...Wow!

He was on and he was ready to go but fate had other plans

Like Elvis before him Michael did it his way

The film actually shows the musicians playing behind Michael which I like so you know it's not a tape and they aren't lip-synching.

Michael grew up in the day when you really had to know how to sing and play an instrument.

The producers of this movie should have released the live songs from this performance on a CD. Instead they chose to rerelease the studio versions of the songs which everybody has already heard on CD.

The dance routines are stunning...what an artist!

You have to see it to believe it

He was truly in a different league

You have Michael and then there is everybody else

We love you MJ.",1267574400,3,2643,4.267068273092369

Never intending this for anyone but for his own use, this is a true picture of how Michael worked with people in preparation for his concerts. Maintaining a loving and calm atmosphere for artists to work with him. Of course it is not a finished concert, we get to look behind the scenes. I was amazed at what he had planned for leaving the stage at the end of the concert.  Using new technology on a concert stage, incorporating 3D into the concert.",1267574400,,621,4.594594594594595

Michael's dancing ability was wonderful.  He was ready for the world to see again...and it is tragic this did not happen.

No matter how eccentric he was, his musical and dancing genius will live on forever through ""This Is It"".

It also showed some sides of Michael Jackson that I don't think much of the public is aware of these days.  He was creative, a perfectionist, and but stern at times.

The DVD shows something that most MJ fans have never seen, and that is, the dedication, amount of time, and complexities in putting together a show of this magnitude!

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this DVD to fans of MJ (even the casual MJ listener/fan would dig this). Since age six (kindergarten), I was hooked to a man who brought TALENT AND INNOVATION to ""new heights."" As a kid, Michael was nothing but overwhelming to a six year old (with his dance moves, cool outfits/sunglasses, and his beautiful vocals-WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!). This music documentary shows exactly how much of a PERFECTIONIST MJ was and how one was to break (many people's)records. This movie was so informative that people like myself have only seen finished products of MJ's work such as audio tapes/records (back then prior to CDs), music videos, and live concerts. In other words, seeing behind the scenes footage at how he produced such GREAT work caught my attention.

You will not be disappointed with this movie, IT ROCKS!!! RIP to the BEST

Mr. Ortega sees him as we do, his fans, through the loyal loving eyes of a true friend, and shows Michael in all his magnificent self. I have been a fan for more than 20 years, yet this film revealed so much about Michael that I didn't know. How funny he is - this is captured on this film. How loving to all people around him on a casual regular basis - this is captured. How he sings all the time instead of talking, the metaphors he uses for regular things, how he sings every instrumental part better than any instrument can do - all this will make your jaws drop. How sweetly and funny he messes around with people, who all look at him with adoring eyes. How attentive and friendly to them. All smiles, all love, it's amazing. And his singing - I enjoyed so much hearing him without music, just his pure ethereal voice. I hope for a real soundtrack of this film, I think this is the most beautiful singling of Michael I ever heard. In all, it's a true transporting hypnotizing experience you won't be able to forget, and if you weren't a fan, you'll become one.",1267228800,,1155,4.376744186046512

This show was going to be hot, no doubt. Check out the stage props they were planning. The sad part is what Michael did to his beautiful face.

The only negative that I had about this DVD was the ""documentary"" on President Obama at the start of the DVD.  What ever your opinion of our President, I do not think it is appropriate to include a political add in a venue as non political as a Michael Jackson DVD.

This video is the concert without the costumes, but all of the performances are there and the special effects and introductions to the pieces are also included.  MJ is in almost every scene and you also get to see his interaction with the musicians, dancers and singers (i.e. his instructions to them, his feedback to them, his encouragement).

This seems to have been edited from the version that was shown in theaters.  There were a number of instances of MJ speaking where in the theater version he sounded positively weird.  The friend I went with and I both came out saying we thought he looked mildly handicapped, because of the odd way he spoke and moved.

In this version, all those sequences have been removed and what is left all looks very slick and normal.

Still, it's a great concert, even in rehearsals.

And it was great to meet the singers & dancers & see the elaborabe costumes and aerialists who were planned.

This DVD comes with its own strange software to play it on the computer.  There is a weird control panel that appears on the screen and you have to figure out which icon to click on to get the thing to play.  It's a little one just to the left of the circular thing, BTW.

One of my favorite moments of the film was the highlight on the badass blond bombshell who simply knows how to rule the guitar. Of course I'm speaking of Orianthi Pangaris. This movie-in my opinion-launched her career. Surely, for Orianthi this is NOT it...

Interaction with other stage crew and co entertainers, and their respect back for him was a thrill to watch. MJ performances on this video were also a thrill to watch. As for the talk of this just tossed together for fast cash sellout, NOT SO!!! This film is very well done, and something his family gave his fans to help calm the mourning. And that is exactly how MJ would have wanted it. Celebrate his life, not his death. This film let fans do just that. His family should be thanked for allowing this to come together so soon after his death. I was not easy, and it had to cost them a lot. No cashing in here. Just helping fans mourn in a good MJ way. What a nice gift to fans from the MJ family. My only regret is that I waited so long to buy this, and nixed seeing it in the theaters. DO NOT LISTEN to those nay-Sayers, they probably have not even seen this MJ film anyway. The film is 100% awesome, great, worth the purchase. And you will want to view this over and over, it is that good !!! And this review is coming from a luke-warm MJ fan. But I admit, when something is very good, actually great, one has to admit that. And I do. The film is totally awesome!!!

It felt like I'd have a little piece of magic...the magic of the last moments Michael spent dreaming, creating, and being himself. Instead, when I viewed THIS IS IT, I got something different. Michael was in TOP form, don't get me wrong...it just lacked when it came to moments with him. I wanted more. I guess it just wasn't ENOUGH to satisfy someone who grew up loving and watching him. I felt a little disappointed with THIS IS IT. However, I will say, Michael's vision for the concerts...SUPERB! He was so creative and talented.

3970852,5,B002R0EIVI,"There are rare occasions in life when the stars of fortune line up.  It happened when actor, singer and comedian Jamie Foxx took  on the role of Ray Charles in the movie ""Ray,"" and shortly before its release, Ray Charles dies leaving behind a hit CD, ""Genius Loves Company,"" along with the Oscar buzz surrounding Foxx's portrayal.  Foxx received the Oscar for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role.

The stars of fortune lined up again in ""This Is It,"" the last recognized documentary of the ""King of Pop."" Jackson's sold-out 50 show extravaganza was purported to raise the standard within the Entertainment Industry to yet, another level.  For Michael Jackson to die before a series of ""This Is It"" concerts while giving a last behind-the scenes look at his work ethic was not only departing on a high note, but prescient in many regards.  By providing a glimpse of the creativity of Michael Jackson, ""This Is It"" closes the chapter of the Jackson Odyssey, which actually comes full circle from the early Jackson Five to the pinnacle of solo success.  There will be many more tomes written on the inception, transformation and rebirth of Michael Jackson and ""This Is It"" begins the visual dialogue.

A must see for any student of peak performance development.  Jackson's example of dedication, work ethic and steel determination illustrates the essential ingredients for success within any industry.

3970853,3,B002R0EIVI,"I watched this on DVD this weekend and it appears that Michael was putting together an animated, special effect driven extravaganza to end all animated, special effect driven extravaganzas.  Although these are not the kinds of things that get me excited to see a concert, this looked pretty special.  A couple of observations:  It was reported that Michael was looking great and holding up well.  For the most part, that was true; however, while at times, it was apparent that Michael was holding back (he even says as so), it appeared, on occasion, that he lacked the wear-with-all to bring it 100%.  He also was frighteningly thin, he looked completely disheveled at the press conference announcing this tour.

I don't like him on the old J5 stuff.  He could no longer sing in that key (hasn't for years) and he does the Whitney-Houston-hurry-up-and-sing-the-lyrics-so i-don't-have-to-hit-the-notes-thing that is irritating.  Even when he was in chill mode, his moves out shined his dancers.  Make no mistake about it, even in slow-mo, Michael was the star of this production and deservedly so.

Speaking of dancers, there are a ton of male camel toe on display, with a scene which is solely devoted to the adjustment of said camel toe.  This in itself was a revelation and This Is It should have been nominated for an Oscar based upon this scene alone.

In conclusion, I have to say that once the special effects, animation and almost singing are stripped away Michael's main talents were his dancing, songwriting ability and his sense of the theatrical.",1265760000,6,1557,4.969111969111969

NOBODY WROTE FOR THEM. Save your money. These are old songs rehashed and not as cool as the old videos - maybe the ""producers"" should concentrate on a true remastered compilation of those on true HD picture and audio. Don't get me wrong he did a few good songs, but the amount was truly scanty compared to others in the same amount of time.",1265587200,8,661,4.426229508196721

I went to see it in the movie theater, then went home and bought the Soundtrack CD right after I got home and ordered the DVD the same night. Got my DVD 2 weeks ago and watched it again today.  This is It would have been the greatest concert of all time.  It's just too bad that MJ wasn't able to do even one night of this concert.  I was actually hoping after the first 50 concerts in UK, that he would decide to a few here in the US.  I am truly glad that they did this movie.

3970886,5,B002R0EIVI,"Okay I'm assuming you watched the movie, if not you can look at the other reviews. (It's spectacular to watch, and the music is so muuuucccchhhh better in a lot of ways than the album versions. It has more funk, especially WBSS in my opinion. I like that version the best.

Extras:

Okay it's so worth buying b/c there's an hour special which is pretty much a LOT MORE footage that you didn't get to see. There's a section specifically about how awesome the 3d effects would have been. And they give insight to Michael's notorious concert exits (post Bad tour) and how for this one, it needed to be topped. Here's a clue, it's in 3d!!!!

For those that love the iconic look of MJ there's a section that shows sketch designs of some of the major costumes (WHAT THE HECK NO BEAT IT!!!!). The Thriller costume would have been one of my favorite. IT's a slightly glittered red jacket, fully crystalized black pants (like the gold version on the trailer or in the movie, but black), and these ultra cool red with black matching loafers (matches the Thriller jacket in brightness). The designer says of course he has black versions (I guess in case it was too much red, I thought they were cool.) He didn't show the black versions. I wonder if they would have looked like the Michael Jackson shoes for the 80s doll (red strip across. Sorta like the We are teh World shoes he ahs but red instead of gold). The Billie Jean costume would have been BAD. No joke. I can't say the idea was original, b/c Michael used these ideas, but they were never shown really to the public. He wore these on a date or two of the Victory tour concert. (I'm trying not to give it away, but if you went to Comic Con last year, you know what kind of MJ item was on display. Well this version is updated and takes it to the EXTREME. Totally cool) I don't wanna give it away. It is pretty much the same Biliie Jean costume but a cool kick added. The Blakc and White costuem was aweseome and the intro costuem IS AWESOME. The designer explains like five or six costumes in total, (sorry he didn't mention Bad or Beat It costumes, I don't know why)

They say Thriller was extended and I know I saw the choreographer act in Michael's place and they did ""They Don't Care About Us"" which should still be online. It's FANTASTIC!!! But I didn't see that on here.

Earth Song- Huge explanation about the song and the look of it. You get to hear from the little girl.

They show what the intro woudl have been and Michael's entrance would have been like!! Wowwwww all I can say is wow, I wish artists would do this. If you've read ""On the Road with MJ"" then you'll know Mike did this to hype up the audience before the show started. Well this time, it's x 10 what he does to get the crowd hype.

They speak about the O2 Arena and how it got built and why (great enlightenment on this segment. They mentioned about how Michael had wanted to tour in 2001 but all major acts cancelled their shows b/c of Sept. 11th and they got Mike to come to O2 later. That was great!

Dancers auditions piece. (Personally, I didn't see the point of this. I guess since I'm a dancer I should care but, myeah I guess it helps the dancers get some fame.

Get the 2 disc b/c some of the stuff I heard about wasn't on here or I didn't notice it. (Extended songs)",1265241600,,3300,4.284109149277689
3970887,5,B002R0EIVI,"I loved this movie/documentary.  I was actually surprised it didn't get any Oscar nominations for sound, editing or just best picture at least.  RIP Michael!",1265241600,,157,5.24
3970888,5,B002R0EIVI,"After the tragic death of a pop icon, I was skeptical of the motives behind this DVD. Were they squeezing money out of a canceled concert? Taking advantage of a bad situation? And would the movie focus on the tragedy, with scant footage of the actual music and dancing? For these reasons, I had low hopes when my wife talked me into getting this. We both experienced the phenomenon of ""Thriller"" in the early 80s, as teens, but I doubted this could capture that same excitement.

""This is It"" was a wonderful surprise. We get a close up view of the planned tour in its final days of rehearsal. We hear the enthusiasm of the dancers, and marvel at their abilities. All of them, of course, are inspired by Michael himself, and the King of Pop delivers here, showing that he had lost none of his form even in the days before his death. He pops, locks, sings, squeals, with all the energy I remembered. There are a few stumbles, which is why they call it a rehearsal, but overall, I felt I was catching the vibe of the intended show.

Not only do we get an intimate look at the rehearsal process, with some incredible effects for ""Thriller"" and others, we hear some of Michael's creative process. Particularly impressive, in light of today's tendency toward pretaped sounds and music, the entire show is done with a cast of musicians on stage, producing tight sounds and heart-pounding beats.

If you're looking for insights into Michael Jackson's death, you'll find none of that here, but if you're looking for his passion, imagination, and musical skills, ""This is It.""",1265241600,3,1567,4.649819494584838

Ed. with one disc devoted to the dancers, the band, the singers, the aerialists and a bit more never seen footage, with two more songs, I had to watch it...It did not disappoint...If the 2 disc edition had been available at the store I would have purchased it but it was not ....The 2 disc set with bonus features was well worth the price...RIP MJ you are loved and missed",1265068800,9,677,4.512195121951219
3970891,5,B002R0EIVI,"It is a universal rule that to give an objective review, you must see the film at least twice. Well, I received my DVD last weekend & I've seen the film 3 times now.

Considering that these are only rehearsal footages, Michael Jackson's artistic & creative vision was evident and it was nothing short of brilliant. I am a very spiritual person and I believe that nothing here on earth happens without God's knowledge & control. I'm in awe that before He took Michael's life, He allowed the filming (that were so clear & so well captured) that has now enabled the world to see the musical gifts & the genius of this man. This is a man that has been so maligned by the media and it just makes me wonder - what if he died before the filming of those footages. If that happened, then he would go down history as a fallen superstar. And may I also add this - before he died he sold out the 50 concert dates, which is unprecedented. That's remarkable! Something historians will never overlook.

Now, with this movie, especially the DVD with extra features will ensure Michael Jackson's legacy will forever continue. The priceless interviews of all the top calibre production people (that were hired) will give viewers a true, clear understanding of how great & how good a person he is. This to me is a clear vindication for Michael.

I stronly recommend this DVD....the Special Features alone is worth the price - they will give you a clear picture of how awesome this concert could have been.",1265068800,,1487,4.541044776119403
3970892,5,B002R0EIVI,"Fun, fun, fun. Upbeat and highly entertaining. Note the people watching Michael perform and note their enthusiasm and their admiration and awe.
This was put together very well. We see Michael's professional awareness of his talent and we see how hard he worked to deliver a great performance.

Just an aside: If you decide to open this DVD at midnight, anxious to watch it, consider the kind of DVD it is. Blu Ray doesn't work in your computer! Then, if you email Amazon in the middle of the night pitifully complaining, be assured they will answer you (within a half hour tops in my case) and send another one your way immediately. And then, the next day, when your husband informs you of your technological shortcomings, you will have to humbly return the new, unopened copy back to Amazon and hope you haven't totally messed up the billing. Beware!",1265068800,,851,4.7114093959731544
3970893,5,B002R0EIVI,"Maybe it felt more intimate. Or maybe it was all the special features.  Whatever the case, I LOVED seeing this movie again and enjoyed it a thousand times more at home than when I saw it in the theater.  I loved it so much, I watched it 3 times over one weekend!

Michael Jackson is simply the best, bar none.  But his best talent wasn't his singing, or even his dancing -- its that he was such a wonderful human being.  MJ holds a Guinness record for giving to the most charities and even left a third of his estate to charity.  No one else comes close to his generosity, and his kind and gentle spirit is evident in This Is It.

It's the little things I loved seeing -- simple gestures, his reactions to something that was said, his laugh.  What a special man the world has lost.

When I saw the movie in the theater, the crowd laughed in certain spots and I didn't understand why.  Maybe they were just giddy at seeing this icon.  Or maybe MJ was just misunderstood right to the end.  One moment in particular happened when Michael gave a correction to a band member on how his music should be played.  After giving the correction MJ says, ""with love; l-o-v-e""  then he looks down and shuffles his feet like a gentle child and says ""we'll get there; we'll get there....""  It's a simple moment that offers a glimpse into the soul of this special man.  An egomaniacal superstar would've gotten angry or been more intense.  But not Michael.  Everything was done with gentle love and support -- L-O-V-E.  But since we live in a world dominated by anger, the crowd laughed at MJ's comment.  They didn't know how to process seeing a gentle spirit asking for what he needs without anger, animosity or being a ruthless dictator; just love -- L-O-V-E.  And when faced with that simple, gentle leadership, all the crowd could do was laugh.  In effect, they may have missed the real essence of who MJ was and how he goes about things -- that it's possible to lead yet still be kind.  But few can grasp the power of that simplicity in this partisan world.

Another favorite moment was seeing the dancers watch MJ dance and how much they appreciated it.  They cheered, jumped for joy and were in awe of this special man, decades their senior.  If it was thrilling for me just to watch, I can only imagine what it must have felt like in person.

A testament to MJ's greatness is how everyone across the board would say ""It's Michael"" -- meaning, to work with him is something very special, and they felt compelled to give their absolute best for him.  From dancers to musicians to corporations wanting to lend their technology -- everyone gave their best, and then some, because ""it's Michael.""

Person after person shared their own story of MJ coming to them with an idea for the show.  They were often worried and said, ""That's going to cost a lot of money and be a lot of work.  No one's ever done this before.""  Then they'd grin while recounting MJ's reply,  ""I know.  That's why we have to do it.""  And somehow, they'd find a way to give MJ what he wanted, because ""it's Michael"" and the show had to be special.  I suspect that's why MJ ran into trouble with prescription drugs, because ""it's Michael"" and everyone wanted to make him happy.  I think I would've had a hard time saying no to him too.  But it's important to remember MJ wasn't like the rest of us; he had special needs.  He was mortal, of course, but not ordinary.  I don't fault him for doing what he felt he needed to do.  But he just should have sought out better care and done things under the proper supervision.  But perhaps even MJ forgot how special he was and how much the world still needed him, and forgot to take care of himself so he could continue to go on.

The special features on the blu-ray also went on to explain and show some of the costumes made for the concert, and I truly regret not being able to see MJ in full regalia.  The costumes were stunning to say the least.  One outfit had so many crystals on it they said you needed sunglasses just to work on it.  I can just imagine how MJ would have glowed onstage in that; sparkling and twinkling like the mega-star he was.  And then there was the Billie Jean outfit that had pulsing lights running from his socks, up his pants and arm, up to his iconic glove -- it most certainly would have been a jaw-dropping show stopper.  Why?  Cuz it's Michael.  Cuz he was that special. Cuz it would have been a once in a lifetime experience.

I couldn't help but think that some of the blu-ray's special features should have been in the movie itself.  But Kenny Ortega made the choice to let the film be predominantly a concert movie; or a ""making of"" concert movie, so to speak.  And I understand that.  But the special features offer insight that the movie didn't.  The movie lets us be _with MJ as much as possible, while the special features let others _speak about what they thought and felt.  Combined, you get a much more complete picture of what the concert would have been and who MJ was.

It's evident, to me at least, that Michael was happy in his final days.  He looked so very proud of what he accomplished and what he was about to share with his audience.  In one of the clips shot on the last rehearsal before his death, MJ had the biggest smile on his face.  He was beaming while he sang, then flashed his child-like grin as the lights were going down after finishing the number.  His heart was happy, and I was happy for him.  There's no question in my mind that he was ready to blow the world away and that This Is It would have been the most spectacular concert in history.  Michael was the King right to the end.  His talent was intact and wasn't diluted in any way; as is fitting for any true King.

Here's my wish:
Cirque du Soliel should make a Vegas show about MJ.  It would be jaw-dropping!  Dear Guy Lalibert&eacute;:  Please make this happen!!!!

Bottom Line:  Buy this blu-ray.  You'll love it.  The interviews and background info alone make it well worth the purchase price.  You won't be disappointed.

The world feels your absence, Michael.  The world still needs you and your message; even those too daft or cynical to know better.  But the magic you created and your spirit remain.  Perhaps bigger and better than ever.  And why is that?  Because ""it's Michael"" and it's all for love -- L-O-V-E.

Thank you for enriching the world, Michael, even now that you're gone.",1265068800,9,6421,4.397446808510638
3970894,5,B002R0EIVI,"i've always been a fan of MJ...and was completly devastated when i learned of his death on 6/25/09, along with the rest of the world.  i was so looking forward to his come-back concerts in london, even though, i wasn't going.  i knew they would be a huge success, and was hoping he would decide to do something similar in the US so i could have a chance to watch true genius at work.

i just received the DVD for my b-day, and must say...the rumors that he was ill or didn't have it anymore just aren't true.  his voice sounds just like it does on the recordings, even when he holds back to warm up his voice, and his moves...still classic with some new ones thrown in there.  i mean, he really does keep up with dancers half his age!  yeah, there were times he might not have gone ""full-out"" in every rehearsal, but anyone who has performed knows that happens with rehearsals.  however, you can tell he was putting his entire heart and soul into this show.

i'm so thankful all the hours were shot, and it was edited into the final product.  many thanks to the jackson family, as well, for allowing this last bit of MJ to be shared with the world.  it not only solidifies his status as the ""king of pop"", and shows off how fantastic of an entertainer he was, but also provides a glimpse into MJ as a fellow man...a loving and talented man.

some of my favorite songs highlighted:  ""smooth criminal"", ""i just can't stop loving you"", ""thriller"", ""human nature"", ""earth song"", and ""billie jean"".  i haven't gotten through all of the special features, but ""memories of michael jackson"" and the one about the dance auditions were quite enjoyable and entertaining.",1265068800,,1659,4.49

At the age of 50 this man STILL had it.  He had the same moves as the young men and women beside him AT FIFTY!!!!  I don't give a damn what the media say, MJ could not have done the amount of drugs they allege he did.  Michael was SHARP!!! He heard every note, he knew the steps, his body performed like those of men half his age. Hearing him speak with such kindness and patience, knowing for certain that he believed in the messages of his songs, and that he did simply LOVE everyone, made me wish I had known him. It makes me so sad that the world has lost him because he truly was a gift.  I will love and miss him forever.  It's so nice that I can still see and hear him as if he was actually still here.

3970896,3,B002R0EIVI,"""This Is It"" was, of course, the name of what was to be Michael Jackson's comeback/farewell concert tour, fifty shows at London's O2 arena beginning in July 2009. Jackson's death on June 25th left his fans without a final act in his roller-coaster career and did nothing to quell speculation in the press about Jackson's health. ""Michael Jackson's This Is It"", the movie, is an attempt to give fans what little is available of the aborted concert extravaganza and to reassure the public that Jackson was fit and ready to put on some great shows at the age of 50. In these things, ""This Is It"" succeeds marginally, but the documentary does little to entertain.

Inexplicably, ""This Is It"" begins with a brief look at dance auditions in April 2009 then skips to late in the rehearsal schedule, when there is little left to do except decamp for London and full dress rehearsals there. I'm sure that the filmmakers wanted to give viewers as much of Michael Jackson's performance as they could while sparing us tedious early rehearsals, but they might have spared us the soundbites of overwrought dancers as well. What we get is an awkward combination of sub-standard performance footage and a behind-the-scenes look into creating the film footage that was to be used on a huge 3-D LED screen behind the stage.

There were to be at least four major pieces of film content for the LED screen, whose 3-D feature made it possible for characters to move from the screen to the live stage, an innovation that would have been seen for the first time onstage in London. We can't see that, but we do get much of the final film content that concertgoers would have seen. That is where ""This Is It"" excels: It gives the viewer a pretty good idea of what these concerts would have looked like. And they would have been a success. Though I'm not convinced Jackson could have done 50 shows, he clearly intended to give his fans their money's worth in glamour, pyrotechnics, dance, and multimedia.

But ""This Is It"" disappoints in its footage of Michael Jackson. We see rehearsals of the major musical performances, but Jackson is saving his voice and his body for the tour. Some of his vocals seem to be dubbed in from other recordings. He goes through the dance steps to get the blocking right, but he doesn't put much energy into it. Though he is fit and prepared, he's not really giving a performance in these clips, and he says very little between sets. Because ""This Is It"" has chosen to feature Jackson's performance as much as possible, we don't get any commentary on the concert preparations. For that, watch ""Staging the Return"" and ""The Gloved One"" in the DVD bonus features, which offer additional details on the concert's artistry.

The DVD (Sony 2010): ""Staging the Return"" (40 min) interviews the creative team and producers about planning and preparing for the concerts. Unlike the film, these interviews were recorded after Jackson's death, so they have more perspective. They're also a chance for these people to tell the world about all the spectacular stuff they created for the concerts that no one will ever get to see. ""The Gloved One"" (15 min) focuses on Jackson's costumes. Designer Zaldy shows us the 7 outfits he created for Jackson in some detail. In ""Memories of Michael"" (16 min), Jackson's creative and business partners share their memories of the man. ""Auditions: Searching for the World's Best Dancers"" (10 min) give us a peek at the dance auditions in Los Angeles. Subtitles for the film are available in English, English SDH, and French. The ""English"" subtitles are only of Jackson, as he tends to speak softly. For full English subtitles, use ""English SDH"".",1265068800,5,3675,4.782677165354331

Awesome is the only word that comes off the top of my head because words cannot really describe how wonderful it is!  MJ still had the moves, the voice and the sweet personality.  While I was watching the movie it was easy to forget that these performances were just rehearsal.  It didn't bother me that he performed at 80 percent what he usually does, it's understandable that he had to conserve his energy and his voice.  His energy though is just amazing and he's just so mesmerizing to watch!  I just got the movie two days ago and I've already watched it 3 times. So many momemts in the movie gave me chills, other momemts had me dancing and singing along with him.  I even felt myself blushing during some of the sexier moments in his songs. While it's fun to watch him dance and listen to him sing it is also interesting to get a glimpse of how he interacts with those around him.  He's so sweet and soft-spoken and I especially love his interaction with Kenny Ortega.

Finding videos from Google and You Tube searches of candid MJ interviews are few an far between.  There just isn't much out there that lets us see who he really was, outside of a formal interview.  This Is It does just that.  You get a peek of MJ at work, how he really is during this process, the level of detail he pays attention to and how happy creating made him.  Clearly, this is why he was as big as he was.

My only let down is that there just wasn't enough. I could have sat in that theater for another 2 hours without a thought.  I left wanting to see so much more and thinking about what a truly awesome show This Is It was destined to be, but will never be.  What a shame.

It's a shame this show never made it to the stage as it would've been the best in history.  If you even think you like MJ's music and have a decent DTS system, get this disc!  You won't be sorry.
2/1/10 After multiple views, I realize that he was a big-time prima donna.  Most geniuses are.  You can call the director's responses a$$ kissing.  BUT, did you notice when MJ changed something, it sounded much better?  He was right.
My only problem is the eco-song with the little girl in a film.  The song has a beautiful, haunting albeit repetitive tune.  But I am very disappointed that he was trying to convince us that in four years, earth will literally be a smoldering ruin because of mankind and shows the little girl in the middle of it.  Way over the top.
Still...what a concert that would've been.
He didn't seem all drugged out as the media would have had us believe at his death.  I don't know how he did all those rehearsals and be so seemingly energetic (for a 50YO), coherent and notice small details he wanted changed.
P.S. That tiny blonde Aussie female guitarist kicked some serious a$$ and looked gorgeous while doing so.  Heard MJ found her on YouTube.  I hope to see her again.",1264809600,2,1722,4.5
3970906,5,B002R0EIVI,"I didn't think too much about the tour preparation until Michael died. This DVD makes his death even sadder. Michael was a consummate entertainer and performer. After watching the DVD, I'm awed and just wondering what the concert would have been like. He was coming back in top form with new takes on classics, new steps and an awesome production. If you are an MJ fan, you MUST get this DVD!",1264809600,2,392,4.535211267605634
3970907,5,B002R0EIVI,"I have been a Michael fan for most of my life. I
have to admit that I started listening to more of
his music after his death. In doing so I discovered
that Michael was an artist with music that evolved
throughout his career. This is a very entertaining
film, and if you ever doubted Michael's genius you
won't after watching this. I could not take my eyes
off of the screen, and you will get chills more than
once. What a great talent we have lost.",1264809600,2,448,4.160919540229885

I can't tell you how many friends of mine have had their minds changed and negative opinions changed from seeing the real MJ and not following the media, tabloids, etc, over the past years that pushed MJ away from the USA. This incredible human being was a great gift to the world and I am so thankful we have this film showing him in his true light. I more than highly recommend it, and every single fan and pseudo-fan of The King of Pop should absolutely have this in their movie library.

It's a bitter sweet experience to watch because of my deep sorrow over the passing of precious Michael but I'm thankful to have this rehearsal footage.  The concerts would have been spectacular.  A big shout out to the entire team.  You were all great.,1264723200,2,359,4.634920634920635

3970911,4,B002R0EIVI,"Now that Michael is gone, these clips from the show that never was are precious.  The music and dancing are great, and some of the scenes are spectacular, but you're essentially watching a rehearsal.  In several places Michael acknowledges that he's saving his voice, so the power you would see in a real show is not quite there.

However, what is really compelling about this movie is the way it lets you inside Michael's world and into his heart.  You see Michael in odd moments when he is just being himself, and you see what a phenomenal person he was.  He does everything in love.  He never loses his temper.  He's down to earth and exceedingly humble.  He is always thinking about others.  Multiple times, he says, ""God bless you"" to various people.  It is the insight into Michael that I will always remember about this DVD.

The special features are a treasure too.  One of them is all about the costumes that Michael would have worn had the show come about, and they are completely amazing--a show all in themselves.  Another is about memories of Michael, and there again are tender moments and little glimpses of Michael.

Michael got what love is all about, and he incorporated it not only into his work but into every moment of his life.  He was a living legend and a living epitome of unconditional love.  He will always occupy a place of honor in my heart for who he was.  Michael was an extremely hard worker and a perfectionist, because he was creating a gift of love to give to his fans.  He was generous, caring, and iconic in his humanity.  My hat is off to Michael, and I'm inspired by his example of love and humility.  Love really does last forever.",1264636800,,1671,4.506666666666667

People claiming Michael Jackson was a life-changing force must consider looking at themselves first.  It doesn't help that people are so quick jump on the band wagon and deify him.

Michael Jackson was just a guy doing what he enjoyed.",1264636800,18,366,4.82258064516129

3970914,5,B002R0EIVI,"I thought I would feel sad watching this film. Having grown up listening to his music and watching his videos, his passing hit me hard. But this film was more of a celebration of his talent and I didn't feel sad at all. I saw it in the theater, and the running time seemed to be 5 minutes - I enjoyed it that much. The only thing I may have been sad about was when the film was over! Never a dull moment, it shows MJ putting this incredible show together. From auditioning the dancers, to the lights, the band rehearsals, filming all the video elements - he was the man in charge of it all. And what a wicked sense of humor he had! MJ loved to laugh! I know members of his family were concerned that the film shows Michael only operating at about 80%, and this rehearsal footage was never meant to be shown. I can understand the concern. During some of the musical numbers, Mike does seem to be saving his voice and conserving his energy. To me this is completely understandable. I believe he wanted to save everything he had for the actual live performance in front of an audience. There are not too many artists that would get away with this. Rehearsals are painstaking, tedious, and exhausting - but absolutely crucial so that every single member of the cast and crew knows exactly what they are doing and when. With MJ, when the lights go down - all you had to do was turn him loose. He was in complete and total control. To everyone who had concerns that this rehearsal footage would put Mike in a bad light, I will say this - even on a bad day, even on an ""80%"" day, MJ was light years above any other performer. This is true talent. Talent that cannot be learned or rehearsed. This is the talent that was given to him. This is the talent that he shared with us. This is why MJ will always be the King! ""It's all for love. L.O.V.E.""",1264636800,3,1838,4.239316239316239
3970915,5,B002R0EIVI,"nobody then or since is touching Michael Joe Jackson. the Man was a Musical Genius who made you step up your game.  if you watch Americna Idol then this is what ""this is it"" was all about. bringing it raw and real to the stage.  alot of these turkeys we got now have to use studio gimmicks or enhancements to cover there weak vocals,etc.. and on stage? forget about it.  you are talking a musical Icon in Michael Jackson who could stand behind a curtain and you knew who he was.  let some of these turkeys stand behind the curtain and watch them get yanked asap.

MJ the singer is well in display. he sounded really good and knew his timing.  he handled the music and he knew what went where and how to add the spice when it called for it. He was always a Pro's Pro. that is the thing missing something terrible nowadays the Professionalism. what happen to given people a show and being a class act?  MJ had that rare gift.

he kicked and pounded that Left foot and you knew he meant business. that is what taken it to the stage is all about.

it's so sad it took death to make some folks see what Greatness this Man truly had and how he touched so many lives all over the world.  he was more than a Song and dance man, he was a Professional Artist who took his craft seriously, however his work ethic and being a Perfectionist  made him make it all look so easy and that was the Magic.

straight up the Beatles,Sinatra and Elvis,etc.. aren't in the same universe as this Man musically. who else from the time they were a Kid til Middle Age could make you look and still be in Awe?  He did it all and made it all feel so magical.

this Story shows you what it takes to make it work on the stage with each Musician doing there thing, all the dancers, singers and the behind the scenes team all doing there work. at the center of it all though was the Creative Genius of Michael Jackson.

tears still run down my face as i remember how great of a talent he was and more important how much the Soul Brother broke barriers and knocked down doors for so many acts thereafter. he was a one of a Kind talent.a Great Humanitarian and Great Cretive Genius.  Props to all involved in this fantastic film that in truth I never wanted to see end.",1264550400,6,2234,4.184579439252336

This Blu-Ray This is It! DVD is a wonderful way to see Michael Jackson in his last days. At least we are shown a glimpse of what his concert would have been like. It shows you his caring, sweet, and humble side, which you never got to see in the media. I thought he was a beautiful person before, but this pushes him out of this world. This Is It! is an awesome Blu-Ray rehearsal! The Thriller portion was kid of creepy.

It was also nice the way they included his three kids(at the very end of all the credits)on the Blu-Ray DVD. It also thanked Mr & Mrs. Jackson (I guess for creating MJ). RIP MJ

I was also stupid enough to purchase the ""Kingston DataTraveler 2 GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive"" expecting to see the extra's on the go.

He was so respected and loved by all the people involved in this project and he gave them the same in return.  He was such a kind hearted soul and a true gift from God.  It breaks my heart how he left this world but now he is at peace and Kenny Ortega should be commended for making this movie.

This review is to highlight the awesome sights and sounds of the Blu-ray edition. The film flat out looks and sounds fabulous in 1080P High Definition!  Colors are bright and vibrant.  And the SOUND!  5.1 DTS that gave my speakers a workout from the opening bars of ""Wanna Be Startin Somethin"" till the end.  The sound was so hot, it made my 4 year old break forth in a series of frenzied dancing right in front of my 55 inch Sony!  That was PURE JOY!

If you're still on the fence about buying a Blu-ray, let this movie be the deciding factor.  You'll thank me later!",1264550400,2,672,4.362903225806452
3970921,5,B002R0EIVI,"Even if you saw the movie, the extras are worth buying the DVD for.  Can't speak for the blu ray--it may even have more.

It is amazing to see Michael Jackson work, his level of passion, care, gentleness.  Michael the performer is awesome, unmatched.  Michael as the person working with dancers and others in his concert is beautiful to see too.  He loved his craft, and he wanted others to as well.  And he was very willing to teach.

Despite what people said about this upcoming tour, he does not appear to be someone distressed about performing--no, he seems to be brought alive by it.  And he seems so comfortable in his body.

I am glad to own this DVD and piece of magic of Michael.  It is great to see behind the scenes things.  I just wish there was another version coming out that was the actual tour.  How sad that the tour will not happen.  And at least we have this.

My 10 year old is now a big Michael Jackson fan and although she doesn't sit still for long, she watched the whole dvd.",1264550400,3,999,4.2727272727272725

(Okay, so it's an unusual way to review a film. Please be gentle. lol)
-
-Finally, we get to see MJ work on his craft. Mesmerizing. Chills.
-The world lost someone very special.
-I wonder if he really and truly knew how he effected millions of people around the world with his humanity, music, dance and unmatched showmanship.
-Pleasantly surprised that he sounds so great.
-I'm struck by his professionalism, perfectionism, artistry, creativity, kindness...
-His dancers obviously adore him.
-Wow, what a show it would've been. *smile
-Michael Jackson, The Musical. Just a thought.
-His legs are really skinny. haha
-What a musical genius. Amazing.
-The backup singer rapping on the ""Black or White"" number is terrible. haha
-You really get a sense of who Michael is through these rehearsals - work ethic, professionalism, how he deals with and interacts with the people who work for him and so on.
-Genius, indeed.
-Still love that ""Billie Jean"" bassline. haha
-eee hee hee...ch'mon. :-)
-Yeah, MJ, the musical might be cool.
-I wonder what it was like to be Michael Jackson.
-He broke out some dance moves I hadn't seen him do before. Cool.
-I enjoy it when he freestyles on occasion.
-He says, ""God Bless You"" a lot.
-Wow, lot of people involved in this production. Look at that circle.
-Still surprised at how good he sounds.
-I miss him. *Tear
-Money well spent. Glad I got my copy of ""This Is It"" on the day it came out.
-It's a finger-snapping, toe-tapping experience. Love it.
-I'd recommend it to everybody. Even to the haters.
-I've heard every song on this disc at least a thousand times. I'd say I'm a fan. haha
-Don't think I've enjoyed watching someone working at his job so much in my life.
-The extras are nice - especially the ""Memories of Michael"". *Tears
-Mr. Ortega's story about his visit to Neverland - the elephant passing by the window - gave me a chuckle.
-I never believed the ugly rumors about MJ and never will.
-I will cherish this disc forever.

3970928,5,B002R0EIVI,"Watching this video will show you so many more sides of Michael than some people may have never known existed. From the visibly healthy 50-year-old singer, dancer, caring human being and overall genius, this movie is nothing short of phenomenal.

While viewing the rehearsal, you'll see that even at that age, he was still a fantastic dancer and a genuine singer. No studio sound-effects needed to enhance his naturally beautiful voice which, with the obvious exception of his prepubescent years, sound amazingly like the recorded versions we're accustomed to having heard. Even when the band wasn't quite in-sync with what he tried to accomplish, he never once raised his voice, instead, he presented his point of view clearly and gently.

There are no curse words throughout the video and can be viewed by all age groups. Throughout, he sends messages of love for mankind and for the future of the earth.

I highly recommend it for everyone that's ever been a fan of Michael's music.",1264464000,,985,4.957575757575758
3970929,5,B002R0EIVI,"I sat down to watch THIS IS IT, the concert film of Michael Jackson made of regular and dress rehearsal footage, I was skeptical. Yes, Jackson was a talented song writer and performer, but in the past year he'd achieved near sainthood from his fans. It was as if all the accusations concerning him had been pushed aside and forgotten.

I don't know if any of them were true. I don't know if people were paid off. For all any of us know, save for those directly involved, nothing ever happened. By the same token, knowing of all of these items, you have to reflect on them. And all of that comes rushing in while watching this film though indirectly.

While I enjoyed the music and the videos released over the years by Michael Jackson, I was never one of those die hard fans. I didn't rush out to buy each new CD or DVD. I never sat glued to the TV set when word leaked about a new video being released. All that changed after watching this release.

So what IS the film all about? Is it simply a concert on film? It's more than that. What we have here is a glimpse behind the scenes in snippets that culminate in a concert film. The movie shows hiring dancers for the show, has interviews with everyone from these dancers to the musicians and shows us Jackson in the midst of trying to make an experience for his fans to enjoy.

Had this show gone on to be performed, it would have been a spectacle to behold. Not an over the top one, but a total package of entertainment that combined dance, vocals and music unlike most concerts ever performed. The stage is there to be seen, the movements watched and the music floating from the speakers to immerse you in the experience that would have been.

Beginning with ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'"", the pulsing sound of the bass and drums kicks into full gear providing a beat that I challenge anyone not to start toe tapping to. Jackson does the usual animated moves he was known for, the somewhat herky jerky motions and glides across the floor that he created and a generation followed and copied. And while these moves seem a bit repetitive at times, to see a talent like Jackson who can make it seem to fluid, so easy, is a sight to behold. Had he chosen to do so, you wonder if he could have been the next major musical film star ala Gene Kelly.

The songs that follow are combined with the interview footage shot during the rehearsals. We get a glimpse of Jackson working with the musicians to get the tempos correct, the sound right and the music just the way he wanted it to be when he would perform. All the while he seems calm and cordial, thanking each person as they go, offering a ""God bless you"" here and there and commenting more than once ""This is why we rehearse.""

Songs included in this showcase include ""They Don't Really Care About Us"", ""Smooth Criminal"", ""The Way You Make Me Feel."", Jackson Five songs like ""I Want You Back"", ""The Love You Save"", and ""I'll Be There"". Also featured are ""Thriller"" (no way could this have been left out), ""Black or White"", ""Man In The Mirror"" and more.

Along with the concert footage is some of the film pieces that were to have played in the background on a giant screen during the show. The biggest of these pieces involve a black and white segment imposing Jackson in an old Bogart movie for ""Smooth Criminal"" and a newly formed opening featuring his dancers in complete make up for ""Thriller"" which ends with a giant spider crawling on stage from which Jackson would emerge.

As I said earlier, you watch this film and are filled with a wide range of emotions. The one that surfaces at once is the feeling that Jackson is sometimes hard to look at after the changes he made to himself. But that leads to the next, a feeling of sadness seeing a man who had no chance at a normal life, who was never allowed to grow like a normal child to an adult.

There is a caring side to Michael Jackson no matter how many documentaries captured the strange behaviors seen on occasion. There is a man inside the machine who could capture a crowd with ease. But most of all there is an incredible talent on view in this film that has to be seen to be believed.

I sat down expecting to see another lionization of Michael Jackson, placing him on a pedestal that no mere mortal should achieve. What I ended with was the chance to see an amazing talent who passed away without a chance to continue. I was moved by this film, enjoyed it from start to finish and walked away feeling that this was a more fitting tribute to the man than the media circus that was his funeral.

Looking here I noticed there were no negative reviews of this DVD. That's something quite rare for any review site. But it says a lot about this release.

THIS IS IT, is not just a film that should be rented. It is one that belongs in your collection. And if you are fortunate enough to have large screen and/or surround capabilities, sit back and hold on to your hats and try not to move to the beat.",1264464000,5,4963,4.358225108225108

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Michael Jackson's THIS IS IT"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  It's very important to emphasize that this was not a documentary that was planned and they had cameras for the sake of making a movie.  These are films that Michael Jackson had taped for his own personal video of the planning to the actual creation of his concerts and of course the rehearsals.

This film was put together within a few months of going through hours upon hours of raw footage and then editing the various film stock (the footage is a mix of High Definition and Standard Definition footage) from the rehearsals and other footage behind-the-scenes.

Fortunately, the majority of the footage used are from the high definition source and picture quality for those scenes are just awesome.  You get to see the detail of Michael Jackson's clothing, the various vibrant lighting during the rehearsals including the stage effects and even closeups of Michael Jackson clean shaven to a man with stubble.  Personally, with Michael Jackson having a talented crew, the coverage featured in this film is great and to watch on Blu-ray is very impressive.

But where this film shines on Blu-ray is its lossless audio presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  My first impression was ""Wow!"".  Granted, these are rehearsal footage but it's one thing to hear the crystal clear dialogue through the centers and the music from the front channels but to hear sound being utilized through the surround channels and nice, clean bass thumping from the subwoofer was very cool!

You can hear Jonathan Moffet's drums jamming while Michael Jackson starts dancing to ""Billy Jean"", Orianthi Panagris jamming on the electric guitar for ""Black and White"" and ""Beat It"" along with Tommy Morgan on guitar and of course, all the musicians and vocalists played a part in this film and it's awesome audio.  Music is just crystal clear and you can hear the nice separation at times with certain instruments on the surrounds but also hear the dancers and whoever is offstage just cheering on Michael Jackson as he's jamming on stage to the interaction with Michale and his backup vocalists or musicians.

""It Might Get Loud"" may be my favorite guitar-driven Blu-ray release for its soundtrack but ""Michael Jackson's THIS IS IT"" just sounds fantastic.  Blu-ray fans will not be disappointed.  This is one of the better sounding musical documentaries I have seen on Blu-ray and heard via lossless yet.

As for subtitles, ""Michael Jackson's THIS IS IT"" is featured in English, French and English SDH.

JUDGMENT CALL:

After watching ""Michael Jackson's THIS IS IT"", I have to agree...this was the great concert that never happened.  I have never seen production design this incredible in my life and I have watched and reviewed many concerts from artists worldwide and have seen expensive concerts with extravagant to jaw dropping effects.  But after seeing this film and what they had planned, I don't think anyone has come close to the amount of work that was done for ""Michael Jackson's THIS IS IT"".

Aside from the awesome vocals, music and choreography that you would expect from a Michael Jackson concert, just seeing the short films that were created for the concert was impressive, the props such as a giant motorized robotic-like spider to a bulldozer coming on stage was amazing to seeing fire going around stage and even a Kevlar jacket that Michael Jackson would wear that would catch on fire.

Michael Jackson and his entire team who were working on this concert definitely set the bar higher than anyone in the world has done for their concert and that is why it was so important to have this documentary to be seen.  This was a documentary that showed a man who was involved in the entire process of the creation of the concert, immersing himself in getting prepared and ready but most of all, making sure that because this was his final curtain call, these concerts were definitely his way of going out with a bang.

The concerts may not have happened but because of what we see in this film, although the main people watching him were the crew, dancers and technicians, now the entire world has a chance to see the greatest concert that never happened.  But most of all, a chance to see the King of Pop one final time and see how much sweat tears they put into this production.

The Blu-ray release of ""Michael Jackson's  THIS IS IT"" is fantastic.  A good number of special features that will make fans happy and again, this is one of the best music films/documentaries in HD for its incredible lossless audio.  Again, this was a film that was created by putting hours of footage together and editing it to make a film.  The footage was never intended to be used for a feature film or documentary.

The fact that director Kenny Ortega and crew not only had it ready for the theater, there was not one scene where I got bored, nor was there a scene which I felt could have been left out.

Overall, ""Michael Jackson's THIS IS IT"" is one Blu-ray release that fans of Michael Jackson and his music should own.  Absolutely fantastic and highly recommended!",1264464000,21,8215,4.877433309300649
3970936,4,B002R0EIVI,"I have always been a fan of Michael Jackson and of course got the dvd.  It was good to see him in action behind the scenes and to see how respectful as a leader in the rehearsals.  The only thing I wish for is that one day they would and had hoped with this dvd that his 3-D short films are released as 3-D.  When I went to the movie threatre to watch it I was like, ""Man that would have been so cool in 3-D!""  This dvd give you a rare glimpse of Michael and how involved he was with his concerts.",1264464000,,497,3.796116504854369
3970937,5,B002R0EIVI,"When I was in the movie theatre it was difficult for me because it hurt to know that I was not going to be able to see Michael perform again except for this last film. I am glad that there were cameras there though because I had always wanted to watch and see how he did put his shows together. I am one of the lucky gals the generation of girls that got to see the Jackson Five from 1969 on the Diana Ross special and watch them on every tv show that they would have been on if yet once a year in the 70's. Yes I screamed at the tv like everyone else when he danced. I got to see The Jackson Five in 1974,The Jacksons in 1981 and Michael during the Bad tour in 1987 all at Madison Square Garden in New York. Each and everytime he came to New York it was a thrill in the air. There was just no one like him and there never will be. For me it was just the norm to see him on tv or in concert and just love every bit of what he did. So what who cares about the negative crap those things don't matter now. It's all about the achievements he made and his heart for those he loved family,friends and fans. My daughter who is 13 now loves the memorabilia I've got all the albums I've lost the old pictures I collected as a teenager but his magic of entertainment drawing from the old dancers like Fred Astaire,Gene Kelly,James Brown,Jackie Wilson all culminate Michael Jackson. I will miss you Michael and I am thankful to have been a fan to see the magic. Rest in peace. To anyone who reads this review and gets this dvd I hope you enjoy this as part of your collectors item I know I am.",1264464000,,1583,3.996845425867508
3970938,5,B002R0EIVI,"I know that Michael never intended for this to be seen, BUT he was all about his fans and he would understand that his fans needed just a little bit more once he departed. Hey, there was a ""Making of Thriller"" video, too, so I don't think he'd really be too distraught.

This video is definitely a compilation of footage and so it clunkily transitions along. With that said, ""This Is It"" let's the viewer see some of the genius that was Michael Jackson. Seeing how he directs his staff I (with L-O-V-E, love, it's all about the love)and the few songs or song parts he sings really does make it all worth while. Mega-fan or music fan, a definite for any collection. This piece of HIStory brings him back if just for a short time.",1264291200,2,728,4.352941176470588
3970939,5,B002R0EIVI,"I  have loved Michael since seeing him on MTV and listening to my parents 70's recrds and 80's thriller, was the thing that set me off on the  jackson bandwagon. my  family and some friends may have harsh feelings about michael but, over all his music isn't involved in that, watching him dance and put his all into his shows is who he is.  if you ever see the live in bukerest tour of dangerous youll know what I mean.  Im 100% sure that this would have happened at this is it if the concerts happened. michael was/is a very influential talent in all forms. a true talent such as him is a perfectionist, not to bash heidi but, michael  would never fake sing no matter what. he pours his heart and soul in every porformance no matter if its practice or not. this is it shows you this. he shines on stage, and just draws you in... he was the man, who made the thing called the moonwalk  and  entertainers hold to a whole diffrent level. No one in history will ever be as good as Michael Jackson.

he was a man who was bred to perform. it was his life.  in interviews and even in home movies I saw on you tube, you can see michael is a performer, he sleeps, eats, drinks music,dancing,always full of energy.  as much bad press has polished his times later in life, this was it, shows us, that Michael will go down as a perfectionist, a loving friend, father and a outgoing person who when performing, becomes this amazing talent. just watching him, now will always make me shed a tear because  this is it is just that.. this is it, the final tme his fans will witness michael as a living, breathing human being who wanted to make his fans love him and for the world to know about the earth and that he shined a light in the room brighter then any star u see in the sky.. he was Michael Jackson, the man the myth the true music legend.",1264204800,2,1832,4.202857142857143
3970940,5,B002R0EIVI,"I know;it didn't seem as if he'd intended things to go this way for him obviously but this really was..........it. Our local movie rental store was having a special pre release weekend rental for the DVD so I rented it. Ever since this came out my aunt and my best friend have seen this in the theater and highly recommended it. For a reason I can't be 100% sure of it was Michael Jackson who indirectly started my own personal interest in music and especially the performance of it. That's one of the view things I can say I really do have in common with most of my generation and I'm very proud of that. So what does this show us?What's it's meaning"" Well Mike was about to do a comeback tour where he'd perform some of his best known tunes. This movie really does offer you a backstage pass to a group of happy and enthusiastic dancers and musicians all gearing up to work with their inspiration himself. As it turns out Michael Jackson is both a perfectionist and someone who understands the performers he's working with. His between rehersal chatting with these people is alternately constructive,humble and also easy going. He takes on the possition of a teacher/father figure to this band of dancers and players he later calls ""a family"". Along the way you get a look into the elaborate, modern multi media concepts he had for the show. On the final rehersals we find some the best live replications of his studio triumphs I've ever heard. Mike's respectful attitude really baught out the best in everyone involved and it would've been quite a show had it happened. The truth is it was also plainly obvious as,even while he was still outdoing some of the performers with his boundless energy there's a hint of resignation and sadness. Mike chose the songs in this performance for more than nostalgia;they all say something about his outlook on life. And he strongly emphasizes messages songs like ""Man In The Mirror"" and ""Earth Song"" which,while melodramatic are genuinely heartfelt pleas from Mike to actually feel empathy for others. And to those who think of this as gooey schmaltz......well Mike really meant the message in his music and his dialog brings that out. I was left with a strange mixture of delight and regret after watching this because I now firmly believe,with Michael Jackson not with us anymore in a musical context that a part of us are missing out on something we all need more of. I don't know exactly how to describe it fully but see this and you'lll probably catch onto the same idea too.",1264204800,,2521,4.654708520179372
3970941,5,B002R0EIVI,"For those of us that have never been fortunate to have attended a Michael Jackson concert, this gave us a very intimate and clear view of Michael's vision. Unlike most concert videos where sometimes the din of the crowd makes it hard to hear the artist, this movie is a documentary of the ""Man"" and his music. His kindness and gentleness are evident thoughout the rehearsals. Yet  Michael has a very concise way of expressing exactly what he wanted to provide the audience. This concert would have been one of the best concerts ever because of Michael's vision and love for performing. On June 25th 2009, the world lost a wonderful man whose love for humanity, the earth, and all that live on it is very profound and far reaching. This Is It is not only a visual reminder of his talent,kindness, laughter, and passion, but also a part of a legacy for future generations. This DVD shows only a small part of that humanity within him. So kudos to those that thought to capture these bits of Michael on film to now share with us.",1264118400,,1026,4.516129032258065
3970942,5,B002R0EIVI,"I saw this film at it's first showin at midnight and it was the biggest highlight of 2009 for me and really helped cheer me up from what happened on June 25, 2009(R.I.P. Michael) :..(  My b-day is June, 3 soo that was even more of a bummer because it happened a couple weeks after my b-day :( Even tho, this is just rehearsal footage it was soo amazin it was like watchin an actual concert!! =)  Michael is the first form of music I ever heard. I've had, all his albums and dvd's long before 2009. Michael is one of the biggest reason why I love music and dancing, as much as I do and the reason why I'm a singer, dancer, actor and songwritter!! =)  I love this film soo much, that I had to bring my mother and grandmother to see it again!!  I strongly suggested, everyone to go out and purchase this DVD Michael Jackson - This Is It the day it comes out!! June 25, 2009 is one of the saddest days in my whole life. I remember growin up, and truely believein that Michael was goin to live forever and ever!! No one will ever come close or compare, to the greatest entertainer of all time. One of my favorite things to do is, go for a ride and listen to all Michaels albums and just lose myself in the music!! =)  My favorite album of all time, is Dangerous!! I hope Michael Jackson - This Is It meant to everyone else what it meant too me and I hope Michael has done in all your lives what he's done for mine because he was such a wonderful person that was ontop of the whole world and cared soo much about people and was the must humble person I have ever seen!!  I watched soo many people that turned there back on Michael, acted like they've been a fan of his this whole time and it really breaks my heart that they could of had his back this whole time and he could of had a more peaceful life but had to live such a hard life because soo many people turned there backs on him :( I remember, havin to defend Michael for years and years to people. They would get on my case about, why do I still love him and why do I still defend him after all that he's done(which he didn't do, any of it).  Those same people, are now pretendin that they've had Michaels back all along :(  Well, what's done is done. The past is the past, now. I just hope that everyone will, forever and always remember Michael and let him live on forever and always and always be The King of Pop, Music, Dance, Grace, Love, and Peace!!!",1264118400,3,2409,4.078224101479916
3970943,5,B002R0EIVI,"it's a pity that michael never got a chance to do those concerts in london. it would have revive his career and put him back on the spot, but at least we get a chance to see a preview of what things would have been like. we see what a perfectionist michael was and he was 100% involved in everything he does. the film does have some funny moments. my favorite performances were the way you make me feel, billie jean, i just can't stop loving you, and earth song. Human Nature was the best one!! I love the way he sang it. It was different from all his other human nature performances. He dressed very nice throughout the film. I love his ed hardy pants. this film is MUST SEE for MJ fans. This film shows what a caring, unique person he was. Not many singers out there cared about the environment and children like he did. It was like he had that heavenly presence inside of him. No one COULD EVER be like him. he was one of a kind and gifted. this was the first film i heard people actually applauding...of course they would...it's michael!!!! it's been 6 months and it still feels like he's not really gone",1264118400,,1108,4.2559241706161135

Se puede ver el Michael exigente en su trabajo y perfeccionista.  Que pena que tan siquiera no dio ni el primer concierto. Este concierto iba a ser el mas grande y mejor en la historia de la musica.  Lo recomiendo a todos.",1263945600,,382,4.263888888888889
3970946,5,B002R0EIVI,"I absolutely LOVED this movie because i absolutely LOVED Michael. I think they were very successful in showing the true genius that was MJ. Just like other true geniuses, he is more appreciated in death than in life. This movie proves that the media stories about him and drugs, illness, etc were totally false. No one could have done the things he did under the influence of drugs. He was very much alive and in control. Showcasing his godlike talent, childlike personality and superhuman abilities and pure, uncontaminated capacity for PURE Love. Something the media whores will never understand. This DVD gives us all a part of Michael to love, cherish and pass on for generations because he is the best there is and the best there will EVER be!!!!!!!",1263859200,2,754,4.8076923076923075
3970947,5,B002R0EIVI,"As a huge fan i for sure love to see what Michael was up too the last weeks mths of his life, and was very much interested to see how much of a perfectionist he was with this, cause of all the fodder of him ""he doesnt do it unless its perfect to the last detail"" etc etc. Im so glad sony did this Cause i realized i would have to draw my own conclusion how MJ felt about THIS IS IT which is what im going to do here. i loved this basically instead of a few pics, you see MJ moving, dancing, singing, weeks before he is gone forever its surreal. i saw at the theater and when i get the DVD i will watch it over and over.
  My conclusion, Michael wasn't IN to it. Feeling forced, I think thats why he probably thought 'well Im doing this cause I have too might as well try to make it good.' This DVD is 2 HOURS!!! Sony states, ""its edited from over 100 HOURS of footage!"" No doubt they took the ABSOLUTE VERY BEST from every single aspect of the footage to look like MJ is on his game. One thing I know after MJ died there was no doubt that Randy Phillips was scared I believe. What better way to show ""oh look see we didn't force anyone to do anything, just look at him he wants to do it"" then to pick the Best EDITED footage and put it out there for everyone. I don't care what Concert Promoters say. not this is signifcant detail, its reported MJ was 5'10 (although his mugshot says 5'11) and when he died no doubt he was 112lbs or possibly under thats almost 30lbs UNDERweight. Why on earth was he allowed to do this! Phillips, Ortega, and Travis Payne not that this would be his concern, knew how hard MJ worked is one of the few ppl that does out of this world dance moves and sings LIVE while doing it, why was he allowed to perform when there were times weeks before his death he didn't even feel like walking and was pushed in a wheel chair!
  One strong point to this, anyone reading this is no doubt a fan of MJ so you know the last time he tourd, performed, had a concert, its been 12yrs i believe since a tour, 8yrs since an album was put out, and besides singing a song at an award show once or twice, it has been YEARS and YEARS since MJ was in Concert last. After ALL THIS TIME He finally, FINALLY decides to do a ""big show, 50 concerts"" he dies 7DAYS BEFORE leaving for this 50date series. No doubt ""THIS"" Affected him in way that I guess nobody knew.",1263859200,,2366,4.027659574468085
3970948,5,B002R0EIVI,"I view this movie-documentary as a tribute to Michael for thousands of his loving and adoring fans worldwide.  It is a beautiful legacy,  a splendid farewell 'eulogy' to a beautiful man who's heart was all about love/brotherhood, a man who truly tried to make a difference in his/our world. He danced his dream to make it a better place.  I am glad TII was NOT a `tissue-for-tears' work. In my opinion, a true documentary would have been less perky.  For me, it was uplifting (with funny moments sprinkled in).  My heart felt light and chipper, filled with the light and spirit of MJ's love.

Before TII, there was a new generation out there who had never heard of MJ before his passing. They were curious about this world-stopping icon.  They wanted to know who and what he was all about, who was this man who almost crashed the almighty Internet, who all but brought the world to a standstill...fans pausing at their various activities/occupations to mourn, to bring honor and tribute to MJ's passing.  People everywhere seemed to mourn him in some shape or form. This generation found themselves wanting to go with the flow, to climb aboard that seemingly 'universal' bandwagon... and they have.  For many, many of us who had stepped away from his career path and forgotten him for the moment, we reset our sails in an effort to renew our interest in the talents of this Man and his phenomenal Music.  Ortega's TII set out to do just that...to 'showcase', if you will,  this country's masterpiece...our King of Pop.  TII is showing us in this movie-work the makeup and musical depthness of Michael's genius... who and what The Man In The Mirror was all about.  We saw him at his art, at his final best--preparing, carving, chiseling, molding, sculpturing it for the Moment... a la Michael Jackson! This Michael Moment was not to be, however.

For the fair price of a ticket, we were able to see him at his work, to see him weave his tapestry of magic, to look into an integral part of his soul.  We readily see him in character and style, we  watch him perform (robbing himself of 100% now to give 200% later at O2), we see him (perhaps not at his best) at what he does best and probably better than any performer alive---happy, smiling catchingly, singing, dancing... executing his phenomenal talent and influence on stage right in front of our eyes. Counting my blessings that day, I likened the film to a 'live' concert!!!!!  Yes, yes, a warm and loving human being.  Outside of our dreamy state, all of us knew that we were watching his swan song-- those final `animated' days of his life. We knew that the stage-curtain would never again be lifted on him, not in our time and space.

In this movie, he appeared thin yet he went about every facet of his work joyously.  My thanks and appreciation go to Ortega for his fine footage-editing and 'displaying' MJ in a good light for millions to see.  And, I thank the producers for giving us Michael as Michael appeared in the last months or weeks of his life. Many say he was not health, but he did not appear frail. Thank God, I would have truly tear-flooded the theater.  Michael was 50, said not in his finest form, and a tad thinner than former times... yet, in loving eyes (his fans) he was beautiful and the man we knew and loved as Michael Jackson. As I write this my eyes are teary; I do not apologize for this emotion.

Btw, I took along a couple of my larger hankies to wipe away my tears, but had no need for them.  Each emotion of the moment (no sad moods) engrossed me throughout the movie--so much so that I forgot that MJ had left this same stage a mere 4 months earlier!

I walked out of this theater feeling greatly touched, inspired and entertained... enough to want to see this movie a second time.  And, I did... but this time without the hankies!

TII....no waste of my bucks!!!  Anxious to add the movie DVD tribute to my MJ trove of 'precious memories",1263254400,4,3928,4.525495750708215
3970949,5,B002R0EIVI,"I pre-ordered my movie ticket a month in advance and I eventually saw the movie four times in theaters.

I was riveted. I loved seeing a behind-the-scenes Michael Jackson who was very humble, understanding, yet totally in control and not one to accept any less than the best. My favorite part of the movie was when he was instructing Michael Bearden, the musical director on how to correctly play ""The Way You Make Me Feel"". He knew what he wanted from his dancers, musicians and singers and he got the results.

I am grateful to Kenny Ortega and all the others involved in the making of this film for allowing us once last glimpse of a man who should very much be alive today. What a tragedy June 25th, 2009 was......I don't care to relive that.

I have been a fan of MJ since 1988 and I felt that a piece of my childhood was literally ripped away from me when I found out he passed. It was lilke hearing about the death of a family member.

Michael Jackson was one of the greatest that ever did it and I pray that his critics and detractors come to learn it.",1263168000,2,1060,4.285

3970951,5,B002R0EIVI,"I was in awe as I watched this movie. It was amazing to see Michael do is thing again, but at the same time it was very sad to know that a musical giant, someone with such a big heart and soul and such amazing talent is actually gone. This Is It was everything I expected it to be and more. Michael's legacy will always live on and he will never be forgotten. I definitley plan to get this dvd when it comes out because this movie is a must have for all Michael Jackson fans.

I absolutely loved the movie and it broke my heart, but made me so proud at the same time. Michael was in charge of everything and he was indeed making a comeback. It was bittersweet. I will never get over his death. I was at the memorial with my brother and I cried and cried and cried. I thought I had some closure after we left, but I was wrong. It will hurt forever.

3970953,4,B002R0EIVI,"The director Kenny Ortega had over 100 hours of footage to work with.
They could have gone into two paths for this film, #1. Take the footage and edit it into what was MJ's vision and give us a concert, or #2.  Show the film as a progression of MJ's vision, how it started and how it progressed and show us a glimpse of what it ""couda been"".

They chose the latter, at first I was bummed, wishing they wouda tried to make it as the concert that shouda been and give us a show or all shows, using the best of the dress rehearsals and using the newly filmed video footage in it's completion.  But the path they chose isn't bad either.
They show us MJ the man and how he leads the rehearals, how he takes charges and knows what he wants and also shows how considerate he was to his cast of dancers and the band, no big ego coming off from him at all, but a perfedetionist wanting to get it right for the fans.

There was a lot of film shot and they use alot to show the progression from the start to the ending where you can just tatse the upcoming concert and how awesome it was going to be.

maybe they will go back into the film vaults and try to capture a complete concert as it was to be, no song breaks or talking on how to fix this or that but giving us a fel of a complete concert that never was, it can be done and it will blow your minds.
Rest in Peace MJ",1262476800,7,1362,3.938181818181818
3970954,5,B002R0EIVI,"Don't go in expecting a concert experience.  I admit the start was a bit slow..but I realized this is a rehearsal and seeing the REAL mike in person. Truly a perfectionist.  In the past, I never liked how the media portrays him so poorly and accusing him of all those charges..

Overall, a must see for Michael fans and allowing us to see he is just an ordinary man with BIG dreams and hopes.  He does it by strong emotion, with the love of his fans. Too bad there was no moon walk in the movie :(  the Earth song seems to be the only one complete in the movie. Some may think his a control freak but he is not!!

- Amazing film that showcases an amazingly talented and charitable human being.  I highly recommend this concert movie to anyone that grew up with or would like to discover Jackson's most famous compositions.",1262304000,,467,4.333333333333333
3970956,3,B002R0EIVI,"I first saw ""This Is It"" in a wonderful venue with state-of-the-art sound and picture quality. I saw it multiple times during its original theatrical run. Being a lifelong Michael Jackson devotee who not only loves the man and his music, I too am a professional singer/musician and have always deeply recognized and appreciated his creativity, his genius, his deep social conscience, his humanitarianism, his shy, humble, loving personality that also contained elements of extreme intensity, focus, determination, and powerful drive; his remarkable musical talents and abilities, his incredible dancing, his brilliant songwriting, his excellent record production (even when he collaborated with others, especially Quincy Jones and Teddy Riley), in short, from the Jackson Five onward, this man was/is? a ""Someone Like This Comes Around Once In Human History"". Period.

However, when I learned Michael ""clones"" or if you like, ""body doubles"" were extensively used in the film I was incredulous. Just as a ""double"" was used to announce the ten that soon became fifty concerts, by the same name, ""This Is It"", at London's 02 arena. You may ask ""How do we know that's true?"" I ask you to do your homework, launch your own investigation, and you will learn the truth. Michael's very frail state of health during the three-month rehearsal span for the ""concerts"" prevented him from being fully-present at rehearsals. As a result, he missed many rehearsals at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles. It has been said there are originally some 300+ hours of footage that director Kenny Ortega whittled down to roughly 112 minutes. Well, being a fellow musician/singer with a very keen ear, I actually heard pre-recorded vocal tracks Michael did AGES ago. These tracks were used in the film to give the impression ""Michael"" was actually singing. In reality, the tracks were used to boost the voice of the ""Clone du Jour"". I well-realize all feature films are ""looped"" in certain sequences. This is the process of re-recording the actors' dialogue and is typically done when the original sequence was filmed outdoors or where there was too much background noise. However, I'm not talking ""looping"" here. I'm talking deliberate deception. Giving the impression you were actually listening to Michael singing. I am convinced, in what if I recall correctly, was the well-publicized opening sequence that appeared in the trailers where ""Michael"" is wearing all-black with white embroidery (the same outfit ""he"" wore to make the 02 announcement), and you hear the voice-over ""There he is. The Man is here"", well, that was NOT ""The Man"". I firmly believe that was a ""double"" whose name I won't mention but you can easily find out. I am certainly not alone in this view. Joseph, as well as LaToya Jackson publicly stated ""doubles"" were used extensively in the film as well as pre-recorded vocals. There is an excellent Michael Jackson clone who lives in the UK and goes by the name of ""Navi"". He was contacted by the producers to appear in ""longshots"" and other sequences in this film. Navi declined to participate. If you research this you will find it to be fact.

Especially troubling was a sequence in which ""Michael"" was singing ""Human Nature"". His pitch was significantly ""flat"", which for him was a VERY rare event. Granted, if he couldn't hear himself well, if the volume in his headset wasn't sufficient, yes, his singing could easily be off-pitch. This is what I told myself when I watched and heard this sequence: ""OK, he's flat only because his headset is too low"". There were times I could tell he motioned for the headset to be amped up. However, ""he"" made the most curious body movements. Very unlike him, as anyone who has faithfully followed his career and performances would tell you. Michael Jackson's pitch was near-perfect...all his life. So much so it was uncanny. Even when he sang tight five-part harmony with his brothers. Even when he sang A Cappella. From his earliest solo vocals with the Jackson Five, Michael's pitch was incredible. His tone and timbre was pure, clean, and gorgeous. May I remind you, these were the ""pre-Pro Tools"" days. These were the days when a singer had to actually SING. Possess REAL talent. Sure ""reverb"" and other vocal enhancements were used, however, in those days one's pitch couldn't be ""corrected"" by the flip of a switch or the touch of the Pro Tools key. I found this pitch issue very disturbing and very unlike Michael. One could argue, ""Well, after all he's 50 years old now. Perhaps his voice isn't what it used to be"". No. I don't accept that. One does not lose one's innate gifts, sense of pitch, vibrato, phrasing, etc., unless one has not cared for one's voice. Heavy drinking, smoking, and other irritants will certainly adversely effect the voice. However, Michael was neither a drinker nor smoker. Michael often studied with world-renowned vocal coach Seth Riggs. For those of you who are singers/entertainers, surely you're aware of this brilliant coach. Michael knew how to care for his instrument. He knew how to access certain notes beyond his ""natural range"". He mastered phrasing, breathing for ""effect"", and pitch. Most singers tend to lose pitch and go flat as they sing a descending scale. However, I've listened to tapes of Michael on the phone with Seth, ""working out"", if you will, and he virtually nails each note in both the chromatic and diatonic scales; whether he was ascending them or descending them. You must always keep in mind: Michael was an innovator. A perfectionist. He was rarely satisfied with the finished product; even when it was off-the-chart brilliant. He was a stickler for detail. In the song ""Human Nature"" he must sing a challenging interval (""Ah-haa-hawaaaaah"") that's a bit of a ""jazz lick"". EVERY time I've heard him sing this passage, whether recorded or live, he consistently nails it. Without a ""lead note"" to give him his key/pitch. I know each and every musical nuance this man expressed in every song he sang. To be fair, in the ""Human Nature"" sequence, once Mr. Ortega cued the band to follow Michael, his pitch did seem to improve as the song progressed. The reader must understand my intent here. I'm not saying Michael was not in the film entirely. What I am saying is, there were edits, ""quick cuts"", ""longshots"", ""inserts"", that featured body doubles and were not shots of Michael. FACT. Of course, In the film, the various ""Michaels"" said they weren't going to sing full-out as this was a rehearsal, which is common procedure. Even during a final dress rehearsal and sound-check (which we never saw in ""This Is It"" because that would have happened at the venue where the concert was to take place, namely, the 02 in London), it's not necessary to go into ""performance-mode"" completely. However, it is important to vocalize at the level in which you intend to perform in order for the sound-check to be accurate. Even if you only sing ""scales"".

I question the sequence in which ""Michael"" was wearing a gold jacket (if I recall correctly) and orange pants. If you unemotionally, closely scrutinize this sequence you'll find the body language and movements of this person weren't typical of those of Michael. They were far more static. Exaggerated. ""Stiff"". I'm now rather convinced in every sequence in which ""Michael"" was wearing shades, that was not him. Michael Jackson's eyes have ALWAYS expressed his spirit/soul. There is NO clone who could ever duplicate that. You could always see Michael's intensity, humanity, spirit, playfulness, brilliance, intelligence, and his very essence as a human being in his eyes. There was no need for shades. The stage was, for the most part, dimly lit. The ""house lights"" weren't on. Interestingly in the film, there are indeed sequences where Michael did NOT wear shades and in those sequences that may have been Michael. He was extremely thin, shockingly so. When you see a ""healthy, robust Michael"" you may rest assured that was not him.

Why use body doubles? Why this deception? I have my own very well-grounded theories, however, this is not the forum in which to share them. But I do feel this film is a complete ""fantasia"". To call this a ""documentary"" is an insult to the intelligence and integrity of millions worldwide. If you watch this film realizing you're witnessing a ""fantasia on the work of Michael Jackson, played out in part by clones"", you may enjoy it. If you believe what you're watching is truth, I sadly say that simply is not the case, which actually broke my heart.

Finally: Michael Jackson did not want to do the 02 concerts. First off, he hated touring and has candidly said so several times. His exact words: ""I hate to tour; I go through Hell touring"". Fine. He did agree to the ten concerts and Tohme Tohme (I suggest you research him if you are unfamiliar with him) and AEG soon boosted the number to fifty concerts. Michael was in serious financial straits therefore he acquiesced to the original ten, which sadly was a more than ambitious thought on Michael's part. There is no possible way Michael could have performed fifty concerts, let alone ten, let alone two. This is FACT and if you research you will find several CREDIBLE media sources who shared this information with the world. He simply was not physically up to that. Yes, he had been physically training with Lou Ferrigno to get in shape for this extremely demanding tour; and in interviews with Mr. Ferrigno, you will hear beaming reports of how fit Michael was. How excited he was about this venture. This is the same rhetoric that was also said by Mr. Ortega in pre-release interviews and trailers. However, one thing Mr. Ortega said hit me like a ton of bricks: (Paraphrasing) ""We had to remind Michael to stay hydrated"". This was said after Mr. Ortega had been asked about Michael's state of mind and physical health, and he insisted Michael was raring-to-go, high-spirited, ebullient, and the perfect picture of health. Yet Michael needed ""reminding"" to stay hydrated? Think about that. One could argue Michael was so excited and ""into"" the work that he forgot to drink and eat? I think not. Nothing could be further from the truth. Michael had toured worldwide countless times and yes, he has said in the past he sometimes goes into serious work-mode and is so driven that he's locked in tunnel-vision. However this time, Michael's behavior was erratic regarding his dedication to the project. Missed rehearsals. He simply wanted to get ""this"" over with. Always the consummate professional, Michael certainly would have given this his very soul, as he always did. He NEVER did anything in half-measures. However, his state of mind and physical condition precluded his professional/personal dedication. The hype simply was and is NOT truth. Learn the backstory.

Even the title song chosen for the film, ""This Is It"" is an OLD song Michael wrote in collaboration with Paul Anka. I believe it was written circa 1991'ish. It was a demo that had never been ""sweetened"" until this film was in production. The surviving members of the Jackson Five sang the background vocals once sweetened. In my opinion, this song is certainly not one of Michael's best, not even close. The sweetened, final product (which Michael had NO part in the production thereof) is redundant, it lacks energy, feeling (not on the part of Michael's vocals, it's due to the constraints of the structure of the song, the key it's in which I feel was not the greatest key for Michael's voice/range, it's sterile and predictable in production, I certainly don't care for the horn arrangements nor the keyboard arrangement. The chorus does have redeeming value, the arrangement for background vocals/harmony is pleasing to the ear and does support/compliment the strings, lead vocal, and remaining instruments quite well; and the chorus, which also becomes the vamp/hook until the ""fade"", is my favorite section of the song). In short, had Michael been able to choose a title song for this film, I feel it most certainly would NOT have been ""This Is It"". I would think he would have composed a new song entirely, however, when he left Sony Music in 2002 under VERY difficult terms (putting it mildly) and became a free agent, he contractually owed them one box set and any two songs of his choosing. Hence ""This Is It"".

I gave this film three stars for the editing; for the cinematography (which also frankly disturbed me...why was  ""rehearsal footage"" filmed in such high quality?...as if it was INTENDED to be a feature film); for the few times I saw Michael in the film...I think...and for the glorious opportunity to revisit Michael's incredible voice,
music, and spirit, albeit via pre-recorded tracks of songs I already own.

I ask Sony Pictures, AEG, Kenny Ortega, and others who shall remain unmentioned, one simple and unfortunately rhetorical question to which I believe I already know the answer:

Why?

Why people like Bashir would make a scandalous documentary about MJ when he had the opportunity to  document a genius, living artist at work, is beyond comprehension.

3970962,4,B002R0EIVI,"In March of 2009, Michael Jackson announced a final 10 show concert run, This Is It, to be played at London's O2 Arena. Due to high demand for tickets, the concert was changed to 50 concerts to be played between July of 2009 and March of 2010. Sadly, Michael Jackson died on June 25, 2009, and the grand vision of This Is It was never completely carried. Thankfully though, the rehearsals were recorded for Jackson's personal use, and are now presented by Kenny Ortega (director of This Is It) and AEG Live to show the world Michael Jackson's vision for what could have been the biggest concert series of his career.

Michael Jackson was the consumate performer, forgetting about his personal troubles, he was known equally for his dancing and for his singing talent. From a young age he could imbue a song with emotion that even seasoned musicians had a hard time conveying. With his first solo album, Off The Wall, he sold over 20 million copies and the album was certified 8x platinum. But his true magnum opus, Thriller, spawned 7 singles (the album had 9 songs) has sold an estimated 65-110 million copies, making it the best selling album of all time. The video Billie Jean was the video that helped bring MTv into the limelight, and was also the first video by a black artist to be played on regular rotation by the network, while Thriller, is still considered by many to be the greatest music video of all time. And that's not even counting the millions of copies sold of his other albums after that. Even in death, Michael outsold the billboard charts for weeks after his death, and three weeks after his death, Thriller became the most sold album of the year to that point, surpassing Taylor Swift. With a legacy so prolific, does This Is It live up to the rest?

This Is It is not the morbid experience some people are going to expect. I'm sure some people are going to be watching for hints at his personal life, or for clues of his failing health looking for someone kind of explanation for his death. What you will get is the King of Pop in top form. He has never sounded better, and for 50, he keeps up well with his 20 something counterparts dancing on stage with him. His choreography is still top notch, and you see the genius behind the man. This is it truly is a celebration of the life and music of a genius entertainer and artist, and a perfectionist. Throughout the rehearsals you see him stop and telling people exactly how he wants to hear and see songs performed. This huge production was completely overseen by Michael Jackson, not created by a team for Michael, but created by Michael, and told to the team that he needed to create it for him.

And make no mistake, this was a huge production. Throughout, the movie you see some of what was planned for the visual conterparts to the stage performance, and it was just massive! Thriller included ghosts and a graveyard scene including zombies and a giant spider, all shot to be shown in 3D. Smooth Criminal had a video shot of Michael Jackson inserted into a Humphrey Bogart movie. On top of that were the pyrotechnics which had running fires and fireworks going off in the air over the stage. For purposes of the documentary, though, the focus is mainly on the performances, and besides Michael we get a look at the surrounding crew, and the true standout is Orianthi Panagaris who we see play guitar most notably on Black and White and Beat It. As a shredder she's definitely going to be someone to watch in the future.

But for all the praise that this doc deserves, it feels like it's missing something. Anytime we see Jackson on stage we hope to see him driving at 100%. Don't get me wrong, he sounds as good as he ever has, and even better at times, and he in no way looks or acts sick. But since he's taking in everything around him and still working on getting into shape to take on the full load of 50 shows, he's not exerting himself on the choreography to the point to where he really looks like it's flowing naturally, and seems somewhat lethargic when dancing and moving around stage. Also seeing bits and pieces of the finished project and never all at once as it would have been seen in the final show, this movie, for better or for worse, makes you want more. This could have very easily been a teaser for the This Is It tour, and, considering this is the last time we'll see Michael, that's something of a problem.

All in all, though, this is a great swan song for the King of Pop. It's a reminder that no matter what else, no matter what happened in his personal life, no matter what everyone thought of him or what public perception was, the public's eye really needed to remain focused on what mattered: the music, the performance, the genius. Whether you're a casual fan, or a die hard fan of Michael Jackson, I highly recommend you give this a try. If you were a fan, but dropped out when crap hit the fan in the 90's, you should still give it a try and put the artistry in perspective. This doc definitely doesn't disappoint!

It hit all the great songs Michael did and even some not so popular ones. This would have been a great concert to attend, the dancers were top notch as was the musical band behind him. While watching we realized that he was true perfectionist when it came to his sound, which was great because we see too many ""performers"" who don't care how they look on stage and can barely sing. Michael Jackson, despite how you feel about his personal life, he was a true musical artist with actual talent. He could still dance and move while singing without a hitch, it was wonderful to see him in such a positive light after so much negativity for so long.

3970964,3,B002R0EIVI,"This Is It (Kenny Ortega, 2009)

I think everyone knows this by now, but for the record, the footage that was compiled, edited, and released as This Is It was never meant to be seen by anyone but Michael Jackson (and, presumably, a handful of trusted advisors, as well as those working on the shows). Nothing about this is finished; this is not in any way a concert film. If you're not the kind of person who can listen to a third-generation bootleg tape and visualize the original concert, This Is It may not live up to your expectations. (This is, in fact, exactly the reaction my daughter, a Michael Jackson fanatic, had to the movie.) As a document of the creative process involved in the making of such a massive live show, however, it sheds light that very few people have seen, and in that way, it is quite valuable.

One does not put together a cast-of-hundreds live performance at the drop of a hat and simply allow everyone to do what they want. Michael Jackson has to ride herd on an incredible number of artists here, including a few full complements of dancers, a large number of musicians, a gaggle of lighting and video techs, and all the other people involved in order to pull something like this together. And while some of the management methods may seem a little on the odd side, whatever the man did, it held him in good stead for quite a number of years and quite a number of huge performances; from the looks of things here, it was going to work again. We only get to see, in many cases, the barest outlines of what would have been. In some cases, not even that. (The whole girls-in-cages thing, for example, gets a few mentions, and we see some early cage prototypes, but nothing of the actual routine.) In other instances, the routine is almost completely worked out, and we see, sans lights, big explosion effects, and most of Jackson's vocals (it's mentioned by a few people that he's preserving his voice), the finished product (""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'"" and ""Beat It"" being the two that seemed closest to done to me). Throughout it all, Jackson stops the action once in a while to tweak something, however small it may be. Control freak? Perhaps, but there are quite literally thousands of little details, and every last one of them has to be worked out, especially in songs with video accompaniment (""Thriller"" and ""Smooth Criminal"", for example); everyone's got to do everything right when it's supposed to be done. You can't pull that off without some control freak in you, I don't think.

It's not bad, but more than anything it's frustrating, seeing what might have been (and I say this as someone who's never been all that big a Michael Jackson fan). And, like most concerts, I found myself wondering why some songs had been included and others (""Rock with You"", ""Off the Wall"", ""P.Y.T."", all number one hits) had been left off the list. But what's here is kind of fun to watch. Instructional as well, not that any of us would ever be putting a show this big together, but you can always dream. ** ",1260489600,24,3036,4.565137614678899

3970968,5,B002R0EIVI,"When I learned of the death of Michael Jackson, I was shaken to my core, overcome with sadness and disbelief.  After all, I watched him growing and evolving for more than four decades. The happiest moments of my life were because of, or spent in the shadow of his music. As beautiful as his July memorial was, those of us who couldn't attend, were left to watch televisions and read news headlines, and it felt a little flat. It was for this reason that I felt I had to see This Is It, to say a final and personal goodbye to a man whose talent and benevolent nature did so much to change the music industry and the world at large.

I must say, though I knew that the movie was more of a commercial venture, than a tribute, I was surprised and pleased at how thoughtfully and respectfully the film was produced and presented.  The side of Michael that ordinary fans never got to see, the consummate professional who, although he always strove for perfection, never resorted to cruelty or temper to get get what he wanted or needed from his crew, was always present. Although he was thinner and showing signs of age, he was as graceful and light on his feet as he ever was and his voice was strong and sweetly clear, and he good-naturedly chided everyone for making him use it,as he was ""saving it for the actual concerts."" I fervently wish that the media had presented this side of him to the pubic, instead of portraying him as a drugged-out eccentric whose career was on the skids. Had these concerts come to fruition, Michael would've have at last known what we, his true and loyal fans have never doubted---that he was indeed, a kind loving man who gave so much of himself to the world, and was and will be for all time, the undisputed King of Pop.

So now I have bought, and watched so many times I lost count, his live performance in Bucharest, and I've seen the movie ""This Is It"" 4 times.  I've cried during it twice.  And I can't wait for it's release because I will surely have it in my collection and be glad to now know who was Michael Jackson.  And I have also purchased the music from the movie, ""This Is It"" on CD. And I LOVE  it!  Every single song is just fabulous!  I can't make myself listen to anything else! Over & over.  I only feel sorry that it took his death for me to pay any attention to MJ.  But just imagine, even in death, he is still gaining new fans!

3970972,5,B002R0EIVI,"I knew that I was going to see this movie from the moment I heard the conceptual idea of his rehearsals being made into a motion picture film. I saw it the first night on October 27th at 11pm and I've seen it 3 more times since then.

Michael was REMARKABLE and FANTASTIC! I just couldn't get enough of looking at him and feeling his soul up there on that screen. The dancers were on point and the band was jamming every note the way he wanted it; when they had it just right.

I read someone's critique of the movie and it said that Michael had on long sleeves during the rehearsals. I would like to say...THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE to me because I'm sure the AIR was on HIGH in the stadium and Michael didn't want to catch a chill and get sick with the flu or get hoarse in his singing voice. I don't know why people make such dumb observations and publish it without thinking through what they are saying.

During the 8 hours of my watching Michael upon that screen, I never once felt that he was not here anymore. I was so happy to see him at his most energetic self and showing his finesse and power at the same time. I was smiling and feeling blessed to be watching him make the attempt to bring his Mega-Talent back to the stage for everyone to see that nothing was tarnished about his skills. Throughout the whole movie, each time I watched it, I was totally engaged in every single movement that he made. The only time my eyes left him is, of course, when he wasn't on the screen.

My only beef is with one of the theaters where I went to see the movie. The first movie theater closest to my home has the BEST sound system and you can hear every single decible of what's on the screen. The music was rumbling inside of me like I was sitting right there in the stadium with them. But then I went to this other theater to check out a different atmosphere and I was SO NOT HAPPY because the sound system in the speakers seemed to be unbalanced. The music and the voices weren't the same level of pitch or something of that matter. I don't know why they would have a CONCERT MOVIE's sound system setup like that.

The 3rd time I went to see the movie was again at the theater nearest my home and I knew then for sure that the other theater's sound system was OFF. The 4th time, I had to go again to the other theater with the bad sound system because it wasn't showing near my home that weekend. I wasn't too happy about that because they actually charge $3 more than the one nearest my home, but I went there again anyway because I HAD TO SEE MICHAEL ONE MORE TIME before they took it from all the theaters. Even with the sound system still unbalanced, I focused on Michael and loved every minute of watching him do his thing, just loving him more and more every second.

Also, I never saw the film with more than 25 people in the theaters that I visited. I had wished that I could have seen it at least once with a full theater to feel the energy of everyone enjoying themselves. But then I thought, this was great that I didn't watch it with a lot of people, because I wasn't distracted or annoyed or disturbed by not hearing something being said on the movie because of excessive noise from a crowd. I accepted that as a blessing in disguise and didn't let it bother me because I know that in areas all over the world there were theaters that were filled up on more than one occasion with lots of happy fans.

I have a pair of nice wireless headphones that I know will give me great sound at home when I get this DVD in my hands. I'm going to watch Michael in this movie on a regular basis until I can see it in my dreams. LOL And the additional DVDs will be mine, as well. I CAN'T STOP THE LOVE and whatever lets me see him and hear him speaking, singing and dancing is what I have to have in my possession. LOL

I hope all the people who didn't take the time to go out and see this movie at the theaters will buy or rent this DVD like crazy because it's worth every single second and every single dime to witness the MASTER at his work.",1259712000,9,4042,4.140127388535032

3970974,3,B002R0EIVI,"I have never been a huge Michael Jackson fan, although I have always enjoyed his music.  Futher, I think his most lasting artistic contribution will not be in music, but in his collaborations with choreographers, most notably the brilliant Debbie Allen.  He represented a revolution in modern American dance not seen since Fosse and Tharp, and all with a competence that rivalled Charise, Astaire & Rogers, and Kelly.  (Please forgive me if I have mis-spelled some of the surnames of these greats).

In my opinion, his personal problems aside, Jackson the ""mega-talent"" deserved a better cinematic forum for a swan-song.

This is, essentially, a documentary shot in the style of a concert.  But no amount of glam and glitz can cover the fact that the enigmatic celebrity was in serious decline.  To me, he appeared rickety and ill, his voice enfeebled and incapable of the range once so effortless, and his dancing lacking in the serpentine, frenetic, sexual urgency that once made it so visually commanding.  It was, I thought, a picture of a man in serious physical trouble, a ghost of his former greatness.  And that is sad, sad indeed.  And for a documentary, the dearth of information about the comeback concert and the man himself was jarring.  Documentaries, I thought, aimed at delivery of information above all other things.  In this aspect, the film falls quite flat.  I came away knowing very little.

If one is available, I would purchase instead a video anthology of Jackson's video work from his salad days, when he soared at the height of his formidable abilities.  But not this.

Recommended only for the die-hard fan.  Otherwise, I would pass it up for a better offering.

There are so few words that even come close to describing the man who blessed us all with his amazing spirit and unmistakable, endless talent.  'This Is It' takes you inside the awe-inspiring and magical mind that is Michael Jackson.  It feels as though you have been invited, whole heartedly by Michael himself, to listen in on a secret meeting of something great.  Even now, I find it hard to express just how this movie makes me feel.  I can best liken it to the feeling I got when I was little and saw that Santa had brought me the best gift I had wished so hard for.  It's like feeling your heart literally swell up with love and excitement that you are that special to be included.

You quickly learn why Michael Jackson found it difficult to quiet his mind long enough to get some rest.  His talent just seems to pour out of every part of him.  It's hard to find where Michael Jackson ends and the music begins because they are so clearly one and the same.  He is music.  He is soul.  He is love.

You cannot watch this film and not marvel at the talent displayed not only by Michael Jackson but the extremely talented support staff of musicians and dancers.
The film shows Michael tenderly trying to tweak his upcoming concert to prefection without making anyone feel that he was being bossy. He always stressed that everything he did was with love.
The other thing we all realized was that Michael was 50 years old. I am sure that most of the people dancing with him were half his age or younger. That alone is amazing. And he had an ultra-talented female lead guitarist who was excellent.
The movie is absorbing and well worth seeing. I will be the first person in town to buy the DVD. My highest personal recommendation and that of my entire family.",1258502400,4,993,4.4316939890710385

3970985,5,B002R0EIVI,"It seems that Michael Jackson has been with me for my entire life.  I fondly remember him as a child sensation as part of the Jackson Five then quickly turning into a pre-teen idol who shortly after eclipsed his brothers with a string of solo hits like ""Rockin Robin"" and ""Got To Be There"".  We were still aware of Michael in his later teen years as he escorted Tatum O'Neil to award shows but at this point in his life, more famous for his celebrity, not his work.  Enter, the album ""Off The Wall, featuring a newly coiffed and buffed Michael which generated some memorable hits.  He was just coming into his own as a young adult, so perfect for the newly evolving music video format.  Luckily, he defeated the odds of becoming a has-been which was territory he could have easily descended into.

Shortly thereafter, came Thriller, the record breaking album, the phenomenal videos and the famous ""moonwalk"" dance that was premiered on the Motown TV special.  How did he do that?  How does a human being move like that?  How does any artist get to have every song from an album a hit?  How can one person be THAT talented?  Sadly, after the Thriller years, Michael became the face of ""weird"", easy tabloid fodder for many, many years to come until the time of his death (and surely for many years to follow - expect convenience store sightings soon).  Wanting to purchase the remains of the Elephant Man, marriage to Elvis' daughter, the plastic surgeries, the child molestation accusations, the mystery surrounding the birth of his children, the dangling of infant Blanket over the rail of a balcony, the infamous Martin Bashir interview, all but a few of the headlines we the public sampled over the years.  There was all this drama but no more real music.  It was hard to remember Michael the performer and not Michael, the owner of Bubbles the Chimp.

I thought his career was so over.  Too much bad publicity. Too many excesses. It was just too late.  What evidence was there that he was still relevent? To quote sister Janet's 90's hit, ""What Have You Done for Me Lately?"".

I honestly didn't want to see this film.  I went as a favor to my sister.  Being tired, I thought a little shut eye would get me through this film if it became unbearable.  The first 10 minutes, I got what I expected, some dull dancer interviews ""Oh my god, it's a life long dream to work with Michael"", ""He inspired me"" etc...dull, snooze, snooze.  Well I love being proved wrong; captivated I was. The man could still sing, he could still dance and still ""wow"" me.  Contrary to the snooze fest I was expecting, this was riveting.  I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen.  In addtion to the performing, there was a very human Michael who starred as being Michael the person, not the drug crazed, nose falling off freak that we read about. He seemed healthy, he had a good sense of humor was charming and very much in sync with the business of his production.  He won me back as a fan and I've no doubt that if not for his untimely death, this concert would have put him back on the map.  He still had it and then some.

It got a little tiresome at the end but despite that, I would have given it a 10 star rating if I could.  Michael, you will be missed.  You still had it.",1258329600,3,3255,4.440134907251265
3970986,5,B002R0EIVI,"I live in Australia and knew that the only way I was ever going to see this concert was when or if it was ever released on DVD. Having lost the great man himself I felt a very strong urge to see the concert footage, not because of his passing but because we will never get to see his working on another concert again. To say that it was worth the ticket price is an understatement. I just loved the way he held all of the stage crew, musicians, dancers and even the concert producer, Ken Ortega under his spell. Every so often you can hear Ken Ortega saying Yes Sir and sounding as if he worshipped all of Michael's talent and the way that unless it was not done to MJs' liking then it was not done at all. I also loved the way that MJ stood up to him and made sure that Ken knew that MJ was not there just to put on a show but to have it done the way it was to be done for the fans.
I have seen this movie twice and for as long as it is on I plan on trying to see it at least a few more times. Thanks to Michael for putting this concert together and for the past 45 years of entertaining us and showing that perfection on stage can be done so long as you believe in what you are doing and knowing that your fand will love you even more for it. We will miss you so very much and Thank God that we will always have your music to bring you back to us if only for a short time each day.

3970988,5,B002R0EIVI,"Michael Jackson's ""This is It"" is an inspiring and magical experience. You really have never seen Michael like this before!
It's as if you're actually there being talked to, experiencing the rehearsals and concerts and everything. It's a totally different Michael than the Michael we hear in our cars on CD's. This Michael is like Michael being himself. You get to see Michael change in his costumes, rehearse the songs, talk to the directors, practice dance moves and you get to see a side of him you never knew was there.
After seeing ""This is It"", each time I heard an M.J. song, it wasn't like just dancing to a cool song - it was more like there was something to the song - a meaning, a potential, a heart. Michael was born with a big heart and filled with soul ever since he was a kid and in ""This is It"" that shines. Michael's heart shines. His soul shines when he dances and sings and talks and rehearses. It's like Michael is more than just a pop singer - but your friend, your family. Each time Michael spoke, it was like he was speaking to you with as he called it, ""L.O.V.E."" and he's always sweet and kind with every word, every motion, every song, every person and he always adds a touch of Love, Soul, Heart and Fun to each and every one of his songs. If it's slow, fast, or in the middle, Michael shines and gives off something that makes you never think of him the same. Instead, you think of him as your family, someone who will always care about you.
Michael always cared about his fans and directors and producers and everyone he worked with and he always said that and respected them as well as they respected Michael.
Michael from the time he was little had soul, heart and charm and could always sing his heart out, not a key missed or sung wrong. Michael had a gift. His gift was singing and dancing, what Michael does best. Michael is a fabulous dancer as well as singer and that hasn't changed for 50 years.

The worst part was that the earth-known King of Pop was about to have this super great concert -but his sudden death interfered with the planned event. So many people to this day shed a tear or two about Michael's death, but in ""This is It"", they aren't as sad because ""This is It"" shares a side of Michael the fans have never seen before and when they do, it makes them think a whole different way about M.J.
What can I say? MJ has brought happiness in his music since he was little singing with the Jackson 5. Everyone knows Michael Jackson is a very talented singer - young and old. EVERYONE loves Michael Jackson. Whoever doesn't is a freako. and this movie is for all those major Mikey fans.
I went and saw This is It in the theaters and was dazzled. The whole thing was set out so nicely.
When MJ talked, it was as if he was talking to you and he was so honest and sweet with his workers, not at all mean and snotty like some other stars.
I loved the black and white ""Smooth Criminal"" scene and the ""Thriller"" scene.
All of this is basically just rehearsal footage of what was going to be the best MJ concert of all time, This is It. The whole time I was watching it, I was thinking, ""this could've been a killer concert!"", but all the song rehearsal and different scenes made you feel like you where at the concert, like you where actually there. And Michael is soooo talented. He sings great, dances great and he really shines in this movie.
The two weeks are probably up by now, so for anyone who hasn't seen this is in the theaters, buy this. It's a must-have even if you have already seen it. It's such a great film.

RIP Michael Jackson

3970989,5,B002R0EIVI,"Michael Jackson has fans all over the world.  So many people for years have endeared themselves to him.  The fans vary from young to old.  There are young kids today who are just beginning to become familiar with his music.  This film may help many to understand, at an even deeper level, why he's the iconic pop star whom many love and adore.

However, if anything can be said about Michael Jackson, it is that he transcended his music.  Oh, there is no doubt that he was a master entertainer, dancer, and composer of some of the most incredible songs written in the modern era.  Despite being all of these things, what is most amazing and enduring, is the man himself.  And ""This Is It"" gives us an incredible glimpse into who Michael Jackson really was.

Michael Jackson has often been described as a quiet, loving man who loved the planet and all those around him.  Some people, I'm sure, have scoffed at this notion.  Watch ""This Is It,"" and you just might change your perception.

I find it almost haunting and a bit of foreshadowing, when during a press conference, Michael tells everyone, ""This is my final curtain call.  This is it.""  On some level, I wonder if he might have known something.  Perhaps not.  Perhaps he was simply talking about his career as a performer.  However, a few people have told me that they found this statement of his a bit eerie.

There is no doubt that Michael felt right at home on stage, performing for thousands of people.  He is into every facet of the show, from lighting to sound to choreography, to musical play.  This is a true artist at work; an artist who is, without question, a master of his craft.  Like watching a composer, Michael orchestrates everything.  He knows when something isn't quite right, and there were a number of times during this film where he tells someone, ""That isn't quite right.""  I have a musical ear, but definitely not like Michael's, because half the time, I couldn't tell what was wrong.  But it doesn't matter what I think. He's the artist, and it's so much fun to watch this master artist at work.

It seemed that every time there was music playing, whether it was someone practicing on their keyboard or guitar, Michael's body immediately sprang into a series of dance movements.  Music was life to him.  It was like someone flipped a switch, and he would begin moving, even if it was just tapping his leg.

I think one aspect of Michael's character that was shown, was that he never got angry with anyone.  He never got upset or even so much as raised his voice at someone.  Instead we hear nothing but encouraging words, ""God bless you,"" he often said.  ""Don't worry, we'll get there.""  ""This is why we rehearse.  It will all work.""  I can see why people loved working for the man.  He was a perfectionist, to be sure, but then what artist isn't?  But instead of losing his cool or getting upset, he instead worked with everyone.  In many ways, this aspect really offered insight into the type of man that Michael Jackson was, a man who loved people and tried to always treat them with the utmost level of respect.

The film also offers insight into Michael's music.  I can't think of many other pop stars who have written such a body of work that actually has something to say.  Michael wanted his music to have more than a pleasurable impact.  He wanted people to think about the planet, other people, and ultimately, themselves.  I found it interesting that during his concert tours, he often ended his concerts with his most powerful songs...""Heal the World,"" and ""Man in the Mirror.""

Add to these two songs another provocative piece, ""Earth Song.""  There is a segment in this film where Michael has some new video footage to add to the piece.  I won't disclose the details here, for anyone who has not yet seen this film, because I feel it's important to experience it without knowing about it.  However, if this segment does not touch your heart, give you chills, and get your eyes watering, then perhaps you'd better check your pulse!

For many reasons, Michael Jackson will never be gone to us.  I'll lay odds that people will still be listening to his music 100 years from now, just as people still listen to Mozart or Bach or Beethoven, and they will wonder who this person is.  Those who really have some insight into the man that Michael Jackson was, will be able to tell others that Michael Jackson was a man who loved music, loved the planet, and loved people.

This isn't it, Michael, it's just the beginning!",1258070400,14,4508,4.566791510611735
3970990,5,B002R0EIVI,"Michael Jackson ushered in the 21 st century decades ago, with his shaping of our culture, music and values; Global culture, music and values.

Culture: Who would have thought a member of the Jacksons sitting in a tree one sunny day recalling the mischief, adventure and fantasy of the early Jackson 5 touring days would plant the seed for the greatest selling album of all time? Billie Jean was the song, and its performance showed the world that limitation was all in the mind, and that one man can express magic ubiquitously. Michael's legend ultimately saw music fulfill its destiny in the film ""This Is It"", as every movement of Michael was always an embodiment of the music. Michael's dance steps and passion spoke the language of music itself: a living expression of the human spirit.

Music: Michael conceptualized videos long before audiences saw the need for them. Videos meant that you could see a beat, you could see the singer in his anguish, joy or success, just as he/she felt at the moment of the music's cenception. This alone made a brand name out of MTV, and continued to make the energy and spirit of Rock n Roll a viable and relevant force in music throughout the 1980s and 90s.

Values: Michael showed the world what was important: love, the environment and our future. Michael showed us, even if subliminally, the great possibilities of Globalization, well before the politicians co-opted it in to their old-fashioned and mediocre ideas. For example in the Black Or White video his message of unity is delivered via dances of all different nationalities, which make up a larger, more elaborate dance sequence. Michael is depicted defying heavy artillery. Thus the wall of 'Fear of the Other' is broken down once and for all. Ironically or perhaps fittingly, it was in the same year George Bush Senior called for a New World Order. Together with his strong dedication and discipline, Michael brought the world together just by being in his child-like essence. Naturally, he showed the world that music is universal and eternal. It transcends even some of the harshest realities that we must endure in the trials and tribulations of life.

I heard it said, of Michael Jackson as an artist, in 1984, and I heard it said in 2009: ""There is Michael Jackson, and then there is everyone else"" (unknown).

We all owe a lot to the man; the life we have today. It took a modern visionary to bring this to us. A miracle has happened in our lifetime. And that miracle was Michael Jackson.",1257984000,3,2499,4.762124711316397

THAT'S WHY I'M BUYING THIS DVD (and also because it's Michael) I've actually heard Ortega say that 2-3 hours of rehearsal footage would be on the DVD, in addition to the movie...so hopefully ""Dirty Diana"" is on there!! MJ actually rehearse it before he died and he made some particular comments about the aerialist and a bed (make your guess). Seriously, that song is amazing! AND the video, AND the live performances in 1988!! OMG!! OMG!! OMG!! OMG!!! can you imagine MJ, all mature and so sexy, rehearsing this heck of a song?????????? I think I would die!!

I've never really been a big fan of M.J., and a few weeks ago I became interested in seeing this movie. It was really good. This movie is very colorful and has awesome visuals. It shows how much time, effort, and details goes into a concert. Some of my favorite songs were They Don't Care About Us, ""Shake Your Body Down to the Ground, I Just Can't Stop Loving You, Thriller, and Beat It! I loved the new version of Thriller, it looked creepy and awesome. Michael Jackson had an awesome singing voice, and will live on through his music.

3970997,3,B002R0EIVI,"There is no doubt that much money, talent, and skill went into the preparations for this show that never opened or toured, due to Michael Jackson's precipitate death at age 50.  The footage from films of rehearsals at various stages of preparation was assembled, providing continuity within constant changes of scenic assets, of costume and other garb, and so forth.  I saw this film in a cinema theatre when I had gone there and paid to see a different film, but the experience was not a total loss, although the inadvertent switch had me feeling pretty vexed!  As a trained musician myself (one who, among other things, played as bassist in a soul group that, long ago, had a lucky chance to tour the world) and a keenly observant fan of skilled dancing, I can savour the sheer expertise of this production's filmed rehearsals.

For a man (or perhaps, given his rather weird looks and manners, some kind of odd humanoid) of that age, Jackson comes across as surprisingly spry (but this may simply be due to deceptive appearances, i.e. to his boyishly slim physique). In this film, Jackson's voice seems too thin and worn to rise to the challenge of the music. I would characterise Michael Jackson's singing in ""This Is It"" as all chirp, twitter, whimper, and whine. Jackson does not hold phrases at much length, apparently no longer able to do that, as he did so admirably when younger.  More sustained phrasing would help to convey some of these songs' melodic curves (as Jackson could phrase them so very well, indeed, when he was younger). In ""This Is It"" the music comes from Jackson's throat in short jabs with very frequent breathing.  That is fine in a song that is more rhythmically (rather than melodically) based, which this sort of delivery would suit (which is the case with some of the material that he sings in ""This Is It"", but far from all of it.)  Michael Jackson really did know how to write some fine and melodically striking songs. All of these signs of decline make his delivery very uneven and unsustained. Since much of the material is far from recent, Jackson should have tried to vocalise songs, if he were capable of doing so, with greater melodic continuity, as he had done so, exceptionally well, earlier in life.

However, it may be that Jackson's state of health, undermined by his erratic and increasingly sefl-indulgent living and behaviour, rather than his sheer eccentricity, which well may be the primary reason for the decline in his singing and dancing, both being activities which require a performer to stay in good physical condition to achieve optimal results.  As William Alexander wrote (for Amazon.com), ""[N]o amount of glam and glitz can cover the fact that the enigmatic celebrity was in serious decline. To me, he appeared rickety and ill, his voice enfeebled and incapable of the range [that] once [had been] so effortless, and his dancing [was] lacking in the serpentine, frenetic, sexual urgency that once made it so visually commanding. It was, I thought, a picture of a man in serious physical trouble, a ghost of his former greatness. And that is sad, sad indeed.""  However, Jackson's sheer musicianship and sense of timing remain extraordinary, even in such a diminished state; he has the material, which is essencially all his own, mastered down to the last detail, for what he, the instrumentalists, back-up singers, and his group of dancers all do.

The best element of the production is the dancing. Jackson himself moves with quick but arbitrary motions, too reliant on gimics of hip-thrusting, crotch-grabbing (at least, on such occasions, his own), and some steps on which his stage movement long had relied rather formulaically.  Jackson's dancing consists mostly of pitty-pat and small gestures, without much the grander stepping and gestures, at high energy level, so evident in his earlier work, when the music and/or lyrics suggested (as they so often did) such displays of exuberance. This small scale of what Jackson's dancing in ""This Is It"" probably is due partly to the flagging strength of advancing age, but surely also to Jackson's increasing eccentricity, which made his dancing and gestures increasingly solipsistic and uncommunicative. Whatever it was that Jackson meant, in these dance movements in ""This Is It"", it does not come across clearly enough to convey very much what the songs  express in music and words, either at specific moments or in general.  It is even possible that look-alike stand-ins for Jackson do some of the dancing in the film, maybe some of the singing, too, rather than Jackson himself; if that be so, this could account for the disconnect that one feels in ""This Is It"" with the quality of what Jackson himself in the past had accomplished. In recent weeks I have been viewing some videos of Jackson's earlier work, which has helped to refresh my memory of just how good Jackson could be (and was) when the man was younger, healthier, and saner.

Too much of the choreography in ""This Is It"", both for Jackson himself to dance, and for the chorus-line of mostly male dancers to execute, amounts to mere wriggle-and-squirm, but the supporting dancers do acquit themselves excellently, given what they have to perform.  When the boys really have a chance to do some show-dancing worthy of the name, they cover themselves in glory; best of all were some touches here and there of very virtuosic (and impressively acrobatic) breakdancing which I enjoyed and admired immensely and I only wish that there were more of that!

The big production numbers are effective, too. Here, at least, some acting that he does distracts from Jackson's spasmodic dancing, and the routines are clever and imaginative. I liked best the sequence mimicking in a stylised way the glamour and antics of 1930s and 1940s gangster action films. Perhaps these production qualities and the excellent musicianship of it all make the extra features of a two-disc ""collector's"" edition (already available in the U.K. and in France), or the added quality of the Blu-Ray edition, worth it, but only, I would vouchsafe, for those who are unconditional Michael Jackson fans. For others, the single-disc DVD edition (or nothing of this at all) suffices.

If you like Jackson, you will love this one, I suppose. If you are not a True (and unconditional) Believer in Jackson and Jacksomania (as I cussedly am not, although I certainly do appreciate Michael Jackson's brilliant earlier work), at least there are a few striking things and some good moments in this film. Some of the songs rise melodically high above what can be the noisy hum-drum of the compositional quality of much of the other music, which, however, always is superbly arranged and executed.",1257811200,9,6726,4.926678445229682
3970998,5,B002R0EIVI,"""Michael Jackson's This Is It"" is a bittersweet experience. How can it not be? It's safe to say that the footage it contains is the last to show Michael Jackson alive. No, not merely alive - he practically surges with energy as he dances on stage in ways we've come to expect (save for the Moonwalk, shown ever so briefly at a disappointingly odd angle). We see not the frail fifty-year-old beaten down by years of legal battles, molestation allegations, financial woes, and drug abuse, but a seemingly tireless entertainer flawlessly keeping up with his much younger background dancers. Could he have been counteracting his nightly propofol injections with a daily dose of uppers? It's a reasonable possibility. Propofol is not meant to be used as a sleeping aid, but as the first stage of general anesthesia and only under the supervision of trained physicians.

Be that as it may, this film reveals that Jackson was still capable of putting on a good show even weeks before his death. Compiled from hours of footage shot during the rehearsals of his comeback concert tour, ""This Is It"" is astounding entertainment, assembled under the supervision of Kenny Ortega to play more or less as a real concert would have played. The only exceptions are the moments of backstage conversing, in which Jackson, Ortega, and numerous dancers and musicians discuss the direction of the show and ways in which to improve it. When a mistake is made, no one reacts badly; Jackson in particular shows remarkable compassion by saying, ""This is why we have rehearsals."" His fellow performers listen attentively, not only because they want to put on the best possible show for concertgoers, but also because ... well, because they're working with Michael Jackson.

Indeed, there is something powerful, if a little dramatic, about how devoted the background dancers are to the King of Pop. Just after the opening titles, we see footage of young men and women gushing over him, thanking him from the bottoms of their hearts for giving them this opportunity. Some are reduced to tears. Would they react this way in the presence of any other singer? More to the point, has any other singer instilled such deep feelings within his or her fan base? You watch them completely transfixed, and while you may not share their point of view, you almost certainly will feel the adoration coming off the screen.

The same can be said for the intensity of the concert footage. Every song is carefully orchestrated and masterfully combined with mesmerizing dance sequences. ""They Don't Care About Us"" combines live dancers with a screen full of futuristic soldiers moving to the rhythms (this effect was achieved by means of motion-capture technology). ""Thriller"" and ""Smooth Criminal"" are accompanied by elaborate filmed sequences; the former features a newly shot graveyard sequence while the latter features Jackson digitally combined with screen idols like Rita Hayworth and Humphrey Bogart. ""Black or White"" ends with a fantastic electric guitar duel that will have you applauding. ""Human Nature"" and ""Billie Jean"" rely less on special effects and more on Jackson's dancing abilities; this isn't as visually stunning, but it certainly feels more personal.

Where on earth did Jackson find the energy for this? Watching him in ""This Is It,"" you almost forget that he ended up dying of cardiac arrest brought on by a drug overdose. You also almost forget that the overdose was brought on by years of addiction; when you have to rely on potentially lethal medications like propofol, lorazepam, and midazolam for something as ordinary as sleep, it stands to reason that one would not be functional the next day, or any other day. And yet there's Jackson, up on stage moving his body with the speed and agility of a man half his age. Right up to the end, he still had it. But one wonders: Would he have been able to maintain that level of energy if he had lived to start his concert tour?

""This is my final curtain call,"" Jackson said when announcing his comeback tour at London's O2 arena back in March. ""This is it."" These words sounded ominous even then. I don't claim to be a diehard Michael Jackson fan, but all the same, I think it would have been interesting to see him try rebuilding his career. What other albums would have been released? Could there have been something even more successful than ""Thriller,"" which won eight Grammys and is currently the best-selling album of all time? What songs would we have heard on them? Would any of them be played on the radio? Even though we'll never hear anything new from the King of Pop, we can at least be grateful for the music he left us with. We can also be grateful for ""Michael Jackson's This Is It,"" which is not only a fine example of music, choreography, and staging, but is also one of the most entertaining documentaries I've ever seen.",1257811200,5,4867,4.844951923076923
3970999,5,B002R0EIVI,"For more than 30 years I have adored this genius of a man and entertainer.  From the firt time I saw him on TV and then seeing him live on stage, I knew he was special.  Not special like a friend, but special in a way that,  not until the day he died, did I realize he would not be a part of this world forever.  He was just that amazing to me, and when I saw this movie, I felt a sense of warmth over me, realizing at that moment, that although he is now in a peaceful place, his time on this earth was done, and ""This is It"" was really his last curtain call.  This is all we were suppose to see of Michael.  This is it!

For me it was the Michael I never got to see.  The Raw, Passionate, Emotional and Hard-working Michael!  I have always seen Michael if not on stage performing, in movies, doing interviews (the few that he did do) out and about with his kids, his entourage, and so on, but this was truly the real deal.  Maybe it was the movie theater, the seating, I don't know, but for almost 2 hours, I was apart of Michaels world and what gave him joy. The Stage snd entertaining.  He was so much apart of these rehearsals for what would have been a fantastic show, you knew this was Michael at his best, and the better of that was yet to come, but never will. But in all honesty its okay!

For more than 40 years he has touched so many lives through his music and his kind heart, and although his death was a tragedy, and should not have happened, the bottom line is he was truly a work of art. A masterpiece that will never ever be duplicated, and his work on this earth is done!

He will not see his kids grow up and become adults, and they will never get to see their father perform live onstage, but this movie will actually give them something that a live show could not, their genius Father at work as well as being a friend to his musical family.  He was gentle, kind and although strived for perfection in every rehearsal, you knew he cared for each and every person that was apart of that show.

See this movie and feel the Genius that graced the stage for his final curtain call.  No, you will not see the glitz and fireworks that would have been a part of his show, but thats the beauty of this movie, its without all of that, and you will just get to see Michael, Raw, doing what he did best!

Thank you Sony and Mr Ortega, job well done!",1257724800,3,2360,4.051724137931035

3971001,5,B002R0EIVI,"I've not been a real big MJ fan, but thoroughly loved this movie - every moment of it.  It documents the rehearsal for the THIS IS IT concert, and what a concert it would have been!

The movie was done in a very respectful way - very little talk but included many precious moments of how Michael worked with the entire crew down to the details to ensure things go perfectly.  Even if you don't know about MJ (if that's possible) or do not like him (unfortunately there are such people), go see him at work.  See the way he enjoys the whole experience and inspires other people.  Feel the talent and creativity of him at close to age 50.

Michael's dance moves and songs were great.  His quotes were even more precious.  One of my favorite lines from MJ as he explains to his team how the music should sound: ""Let it (the music) simmer.""  Another one: when asked how he would know a particular detail change on screen behind him as he faced the audience, he paused for a split second and said, ""I just got to FEEL it.""

As he controls virtually all aspects of the rehearsal (knowing every beat of every song so well), it really is a team effort and everyone put so much into it.  It would have been a great show, but I am so grateful for this movie.  It gives this close up look of great artists at work that most of us would otherwise never get to see.  Go watch the movie.

Michael's thrilling to watch even practicing his dancers and band. This Is It was going to be absolutely amazing and it's a huge loss to the world that we didn't get to see it. After watching this film, there's no doubt in my mind that Michael could have done the 50 shows in London...the master that he was. Can't wait to see what's in the DVD extras!",1257638400,4,525,4.655913978494624

3971004,3,B002R0EIVI,"""This Is It"" might be a perfect elegy, capable of quitting us of our longings after the dead, now happily sent along the way to a better existence.  Compiled of footage shot during the rehearsals leading up to Michael Jackson's planned comeback tour, this cinematic event is remarkable for its mundanity, slack composition, and candid view of a personage rarely - perhaps never - viewed with such mortal limitation.  Never have his moves snapped less, his voice been feebler, never the Neverland of fame more pitiable.  Run out and go see it right now.

Simone de Beauvoir said, ""One is not born a genius, one becomes a genius"", and here is firm confirmation of this truth, the implication of which is that genius is not essential but ephemeral, a coat which we wear.  MJ has many coats, but all of them are glam and unreal - he has no need for hours in wardrobe, because superstar garments are his street clothes.  When his dancers sweat down to their skivvies, Michael keeps cool in a brilliant silver, custom-made, double-breasted, over-sized sports jacket.  When his band shows up looking like its laundry day, for MJ it might as well be opening day.

You'd think that we jaded Americans would have developed a prudent resistance to unthinking hero-worship, but alas.  Michael could not shed his living-godliness if he decreed it so, a Midas-like fate thrust upon him even as he half-asses one dance sequence after another.  Do not expect to see a single moonwalk in ""This Is It"", the King of Pop is weary and conserves himself to much applaud.  As in all good cults, a glimmering embodiment is ritually upheld: Michael's vague, inarticulate band direction is greeted as masterly and perfectionist, the opening sequence is unified by teary fawning from dancers the world over, and the creative ""partnership"" of Kenny Ortega is dominated by obsequent deference.

""This Is It"" will save you from such fanaticism, and thus I highly recommend this movie.  It is the long sought cure for Thriller fever.  I guarantee that half way through this two-hour home movie, you will look deep inside yourself and know that Michael is truly gone.  This is because under no condition save remembrance of the deceased do we readily submit to such unpolished, rambling banality.  Go ahead, treat yourself to some good old-fashioned catharsis.  Idols are meant to be deposed, Michael would have wanted it this way.",1257552000,3,2399,4.898514851485149

All I could say was, ""Wow""! when I walked out of the theatre. I couldn't imagine they would put something together so smoothly using clips from backstage scenes. Much of it appeared just as it would on stage in full costumes. Jackson appeared so frail and yet, he moved pretty good for a 50 year old guy who hadn't performed in quite a few years. He still seemed to have what it takes. The whole thing was quite a pleasant surprise to me. It was so good that I had to go back the next week and watch it all over again.  The second time I saw it, I still said, ""Wow""! What more could one say? It was all very well done. Beautiful tribute to the man.",1257552000,,790,4.090322580645161

Michael himself was a child and in this film you see him smile, chew gum and suck on a lollipop.  He was truly looking forward to his comeback tour but just watching what he did to prepare for this endeavor, you can tell he was truly happy.  He wanted his children to watch him as a preformer and not just ""dad"".  That was the whole intention for this tour.  I use to feel very negative about Michael Jackson but after seeing this film and viewing how hard he worked and how gracious he was to those who were working with him, I feel he was truly unfairly accused of the charges that were brought against him.  I still believe it was not a good choice to have young boys sleep in his bed but I truly believe he never touched any of those kids.  Rest in peace Michael.",1257552000,,883,4.245508982035928
3971007,4,B002R0EIVI,"I really enjoyed this. I was surprised by how Michael Jackson danced and moved well, very impressive - for a 50 year old guy remember - and looked healthy which makes it even sadder he passed away.
He sure didn't look like a guy who was ""frail"" or ill (as some UK media described him) or that his heart wasn't in it. In fact he looked better than he had for some years.
Some productions look as if they could have been crackers - for the example the 'Smooth Criminal' sequence was brilliant, with some very clever splicing putting MJ in a 40's gangster film (Rita Hayworth's 1946 film 'Gilda'), an updated 'Thriller' video and the moving 'Earth Song'. Also there were some good rehersal performances of 'Billie Jean', 'Beat It' etc. He also seemed clued up enough and knew what he was doing to direct his dancers and keep rhythm. I also read some reports or rumours that a double was used for some sequences but I didn't spot any, if one was used I can't see the join!

It's an enjoyable yet frustrating (in the sense of ""What if?"") look at what his shows could have been like. It was interesting getting an insight into the production/videos. I'm sure the live shows would have been incredible!
In a curious way, this is one of the best and worst things. In presenting the MJ the fans/public want to see (understandably), it makes you think you never thought he'd die, but now he's gone - if that makes sense. In a sense, maybe the film fools us in the way Michael often fooled us.
But I think it was supposed to be celebrate him, and this is surely a must for fans to remember him by.
At the end, the audience in the cinema even applauded which isn't something you see very often.
I'm not even that big an MJ fan but can appreciate he was a pop legend and I enjoyed some of his music, he has made some very good music.
It would have been such a spectacle to see him in London.",1257552000,3,1878,4.290140845070423

No one will ever be like him. He will be missed by everyone who loved him and his legacy will live on forever. A true humanitarian. The movie gave me chills. Truely the best movie I have ever seen. We love you Michael.",1257465600,3,390,3.8875
3971013,5,B002R0EIVI,"I just saw this amazing movie yesterday and i was floored at how great it was!!  Even though it was rehearsal footage and not the actual performance, his youthful energy and charisma was so in your face!!  the dancers were also so crazy talented and everyone was so in synch. there is no doubt that the concerts would have been his best filmed concert!!  his love for us, his love for the orchestra, his love for the earth, his love for his dancers, and his love for his family are so obvious and gorgeous to see!! he was a wonderful human being and i was dancing in my chair in the theatre and boppin my head....there's just no way you can just sit there!! So, yes purchase the dvd because it is just so priceless and beautiful!!

i just want to add this....i am also a huge prince fan, and i've seen him live many times since 1990, but michael's performance surpasses that of prince because he doesn't have a diva attitude and didn't preach about god like prince did even in rehearsal!!  so there you go, michael was and still is the bomb!!",1257465600,2,1042,4.350515463917525

And to ""Editorial Reviewer"" Fenessey: MJ didn't ""claim his earpiece wasn't working"" which you say caused him to ""flubb"" J5 lyrics- gee I think he knows those pretty well ya think. He was saying that he was not raised using earpieces in performance and the sound level felt like a fist in his ears. He didn't miss any lyrics, he stopped the performance to comment on the effect that the earpieces were having on him and the difficulty he was having in adjusting to their use. Did you actually watch this  movie carefully before you reviewed it? (Or are you one of ""those""?) Please change this review to reflect what really happened in the movie that we can all SEE and HEAR.",1257465600,,926,4.4733727810650885

3971016,5,B002R0EIVI,"By the time Michael Jackson died, his life had become such a tawdry soap opera that it was hard to think of anything else about him.  I'm so glad to have seen this film because it is a vigorous reminder of just what a great entertainer he was, how talented, how detail oriented and determined to deliver eye-popping performances. It's really well done. I'm glad I'll be able to remember him this way.",1257379200,,400,4.47945205479452
3971017,5,B002R0EIVI,"I always enjoyed Michael's music through the years, but I never really understood that the man was a genius until I saw this movie. It really allowed me to see the behind the scenes creative process involved with his music and dance, and to get a sense of how much went in to his shows and each and every song. He put his entire self into the performance, and he clearly had an unbelievable gift. This movie really allowed me to get a glimpse of his genius at work.

I would definitely enjoy seeing many of the numbers in the movie again. I noticed somewhere that one reviewer didn't like the film because Michael wasn't singing at his full ability for some of the movie. Yes he was saving his voice for his tour. However even when he was using a small percentage vocally of what he had, it was  fantastic, and I was totally entertained. There were moments when he really broke out and put his all into it, and it was amazing.

The movie also gave you a good look at some of what would have been seen on his concert tour, such as the music videos that were to accompany the stage performers. They were simply fantastic. Michael had spared no expense and as always with him, there was some ground breaking stuff.

Of course you can't help but feel some sadness that his life was cut short as it was. Regardless, I'd totally recommend this video.",1257379200,3,1344,4.364
3971018,5,B002R0EIVI,"This is an edited review.  This is It, is a spectacular production worthy of numerous film and music awards.  This is one product that no one will forget.  The concert that almost was. I was fortunate to have seen the movie 8 times. Each time was an event and a discovery of something new.

I just finished watching 7 promotional release videos on YouTube. These videos show more of the creative genius involved than was seen during the theatrical release of the movie.

[...]

By now most should have seen the TII ""Light Man"" video, if not it is found on Amazon. There is no doubt in my mind after having viewed just the promotional videos, that had Michael Jackson lived, it would have been a very long time before he retired from concert performances.

Michael is so charming, so captivating, so whimsical. It is still hard to believe that this legend is gone. If you like MJ you will leave loving him. He is such a sweet human being and treats the other performers with great respect. His magic truly translates on to the big screen..so much so that you feel as if you are right there with him at the rehearsal. I for one will never recover from his loss. Indeed...Love does live forever! RIP MJ.",1257379200,3,581,4.243243243243243

3971023,5,B002R0EIVI,"I have seen ""This Is It"" twice so far.  I went to the sold-out opening night showing and came away so impacted by the sheer genius of Michael Jackson.  It was awe-inspiring, a music and dance masterpiece, and a truly emotional experience.  The new video of his ""Earth Song"" couldn't help but inspire us to do our part to save the planet and make the world a better place.  The second time I went to the IMAX version and felt like I was actually there.  I heard that Michael intended for ""Thriller"" to be seen in IMAX 3D.  Now I have to find that theater:-)

This is a must-see film for anyone who appreciates genius and amazing music, dance, staging and film.  Everyone involved in this movie is exceptional but Michael does stand alone in his brilliance.  I do not have enough superlatives for Michael and this film.  I will now pre-order the DVD and plan to purchase some for holiday gifts.",1257292800,2,892,4.450617283950617

If only the noise around him could stop and watch what he really was about!
this movie is a witness of it all!

In the end Michael won! So did the ones who witnessed his last few months! Cheers to you guys to give us back a part of it in a movie...and love to his kids who will without a question represent everything about this amazing man!!!!",1257292800,2,482,4.020833333333333
3971025,4,B002R0EIVI,"The thing about the movie is that there are not any real surprises- MJ probably wanted to play it ""safe"". He could be testing the waters to see the competition and have one last attempt at world domination,or just join the oldies, Vegas set and perform Billie Jean  ad nauseum and get paid handsomely for it. Oh how fate has other plans. This movie could be described as MJ ""unplugged"". There are no safety nets,he dances brilliantly, he sings soulfully and indeed looks at the top of his game. This portrait could be as honest as you could get of MJ. We are peeking into his rehearsals and he really makes his co-workers punch above their weight. Its great watching him communicate to the band what he wants-he is a font of music and emotion and it just oozes out of him. When he does Billie Jean you get goose bumps. This movie once and for all shows what a true genius he was, what an amazing performer, what a loss and we will probably not see another like him again.",1257292800,,971,4.3646408839779

3971027,5,B002R0EIVI,"I will always rmemeber that day when I heard the news of Michael Jacksons death I remember where I was ... when my son called me...Michael and I had a long relationship over 35 years of music and dancing I was a fan of his and will always be. His music was timeless and always made you smile no matter what, and it got you up to dance, to move your body, and listening to him always made you feel good. His talent was endless. His life unfortunatly was not. We kill our icons we kill them with overwhelming adoration and expect them to be perfect he became it and was miserable being so famous he was not a happy soul.,he had a dark side to him that no one expected.
We tend to put these celebrities on pedestals and than they fall however we could of helped him but we caged him forever to be the reclusive man that he became. Emotional pain can determine how one treats themselves, and he self medicated himself into oblivion because to be him in his shoes was too painful to even imagine, after the embarrassment of what he endured.
Thank you Randy Ortega for this last documentary of this icon, it was great and I really enjoyed it. It made you realize what a perfectionist Michael was about his craft you could see how over the years he was thinner and frailer than he was years ago. The sunglasses showed a man who wanted to disappear this was the other side to Michael. He worked long hours, was out of breath, during some vocal numbers and if you did not know what he had died from, maybe no one would of knowticed it. I saw him as a desperate man wanting this to work out so bad... but drugs had become his master and after rehersals he probably went home in pain wanting to sleep because of the stress of it all. He was not really hoping for a comeback take a look at the title it says it all...This is it go an see it ...a reminder of days gone by.. the magic ended but the last film will forever be etched in our minds.",1257206400,,1931,4.165775401069519
3971028,5,B002R0EIVI,"I breath that means I love,
I love that means I live...
For me Michael is like a meteorite.
Burned out but left bright light...
There will never be like him again. Genius and Love is a very rare combination.
MJ is all about Love to the planet Earth and all it's creations.

""This Is it"" is a true event. This is real. The effort - that's what counts the most.
Michael did show that his desire and dreams about come back were strong and real...for his children, for us, for the purpose. He overstepped his physical pain and public humiliation. He was ready to go.
It does show the creativity process and perfectionism of Michael' work on stage, his gentle and intelligent personality. You may like him or don't. But I belive everybody will learn about his message to the people: Love is important, love each other and our home-Earth, we are ""one"", make a change.

If you are going to see the movie, please, stay till the very end of ""This Is It""- there is a beautiful surprise after the credits. You will know that Michael loves and cares about us.
I saw it at the first day at the theatre. I could not leave at the end of ""This Is It"". All people already left. I just was there alone and listen his song and read the closing credits till the very end and what a surprise...here is Michael again alive with his sense of humor in creative mood and message to all of us: ""I Love You"". And next you see the future of our beautiful Planet Earth in hands of a smiling child!!!
I felt healing and not too sad anymore. He covers you with a blanket of love and gives hope.
SMILE!!! It is his favorite song. He does not want us to be sad. Live is going on.

I watch Michael at ""This Is It"" and listen his songs and think about how we make our own destiny. I can feel his pain...his innocence.
He can touch your soul with his lyrics. Personally, I do not like his ""Thriller"" era that was his blessing in a music industry and also a curse in his life. As he went through the tragedies, he developed very deep creative mind and sensitive soul.
I can relate to his more mature period.
""Black And White"", ""Man In The Mirror"",the inspiration behind ""We Are The World"", ""Earth Song"", ""They don't care about us"", ""Speechless"",etc.
He is a true Artist. He is a Human.

They say:""He was famous because he was not normal"" - this opinion is for the crowd. We all have two sides that are forever in conflict. But rare unique human as Michael Jackson with his philosophy of ""Heal the World with Love"" brings very strong moral message. His talent is able to touch the soul of people who are prepared to listen and open the mind of those who are able to think.

Many years ago I read novel ""The American tragedy"". It does remind me the line of personal tragedy in the society that based on materialism and stereotypes.

Allow yourself to know Michael Jackson in his deepest emotions.
So, understand his message, watch ""This Is It"" again and again, remember him and open your heart, feel it, make a change...",1257206400,,2981,4.342908438061041
3971029,5,B002R0EIVI,"Ah, what can I say?  Michael Jackson is no longer Peter Pan or pretending to be.  A great behind the scenes look at a mature, sexy come-into-his-mature-own musical genius weaving his magic.  For the fans who have only seen him perform in person or on video, or doing an interview he really didn't want to do, or appearing at an award show to mumble a few words, they (we) finally get to see Michael in his element, behind the scenes, doing his thing for his fans.

Ever humble, polite, and loving, Michael is truly in command. You don't want to displease Michael, you just want to achieve the very best and work as hard as he does as a performer.  To paraphrase Tommy Organ (guitarist), there is some serious genius stuff going on around here.  And indeed Michael knows his stuff - every lyric, every note, every rhythm, every cue, and every beat.  As he tells his keyboardist (Michael Bearden) when asked what does he want to hear, ""I want to hear it the way I wrote it.  I want the audience to hear it the way they hear it"" (ouch). In his own words, Michael ""sizzles"" and ""simmers"" and shows young, muscular dancers half his age how its *really* done.

Saving his voice and body for the upcoming 50 concerts, Michael still can't help but give his all.  At one point he exhorts his audience that they shouldn't do that to him (encouraging him to sing to his fullest - during a soulful rendition of ""The Way You Make Me Feel"") because he's saving his voice, a voice (Michael Bearden's) screen says, ""But Mike you were feeling it.  You can allow yourself this one time."" ""No, no"", he says, ""I can't [I have to save my voice].""  Michael's vocalizations during ""Human Nature"" will send chills down your spine.

Michael improvises a new version of ""Billie Jean"", at one point going into a slo-mo crouch grabbing hump with a ""nasty"" face that says this ""old"" man still has sex appeal and then some.  The young macho dancers go wild and he brings tears (and not a just little lust) to this fan's eyes.

See it more than once.  See it the first time and you can't take your eyes off Michael, and then see it the second time for all the things you missed because you were mesmerized. Then see it a third time to put it all together.

Michael still has the vocal chops and the dancing chops.  He is on point with a super-preternatural ability to hear, feel, and see in the music and the rhythm what no mere mortal can. Michael was doing this for us, the fans, and the show was going to be the biggest, the best, and the most spectacular performance the world as ever seen. Kenny Ortega treats the material and Michael with both intimate knowledge and respect.

Warning, stay until the very last credit rolls as there is a little surprise at the end and a tribute that will bring fresh tears to your eyes.  You'll find yourself smiling throughout though because Michael is having just too much fun.",1257206400,,2888,4.444022770398482
3971030,5,B002R0EIVI,"I saw the movie on November 1 and like others, I want to see it again and again.  Of course we all know Michael Jackson was unbelievably talented and I wanted to see his talent one more time and get a ""backstage"" look into the rehearsal.

As the minutes tick by you will be drawn further and further into the excitement, creative talent, and gentle kindness of Michael.  The dancing is beyond belief, the dancers are worth the price of admission.

There is a part of the movie and I have no idea what to call it, it is a new song with the video showing how horribly we are destroying the world in a way that makes you want to jump up and scream ""NO!""

You will not be able to sit through the entire movie without tapping your toes and moving in your seat.  In the end, however, there is overwhelming sadness for the loss of the greatest performer of all time.

It is very emotional on many levels; when I left the theatre I felt dazed, a sort of ""where I am?"" feeling because for 2 hours, you left your universe and became a part of something much greater.",1257206400,,1056,4.198019801980198
3971031,5,B002R0EIVI,"I just came home from that great movie and I was positively suprised in many ways. Michael seemed to be happy and it was nice to see that he put together a totally new crew with young musicians, dancers and so on. You can see that he wanted to give others a way to show their best. It was always clear to me that when it comes to music Michael new exactly what he wanted and the way he wanted it to sound. But to see how he discusses details with others is just a fine thing.

Furthermore his vocal qualities were as great as always. At the Dangerous tour I got the feeling that almost 50% of the show were playback but at these rehearsals you could listen to at least 90% live - Michael in high quality.

Maybe it was good that he died at the age of 50 so we remember him the way he was. He never grew old really...and that has always been his dream. He lived a life of Peter Pan of the Pop world and beyond.

A great musician without any doubt, one of the greatest.

This film (or concert) compared to his former shows would have been his best, I am really sure.",1257206400,,1064,4.028436018957346

Even though it was just rehearsals without a lot of costumes, the style, charisma, talent, and love you feel when you watch the magic in the making is impossible to describe. I believe MJ's early death was the greatest loss of music history but he will live on forever in his music through his fans for decades to come.  It about breaks your heart to know Michael didn't get to finish this incredible final concert run but even in death he has made an UNSTOPABLE COMEBACK! I am so pleased Kenny Ortega and the Jackson Estate continued on with the show as Michael would have wanted. If you are a true MJ fan, THIS IS IT will put a smile on your face, tears in your eyes and you will leave wanting more and that is what the show of a lifetime is all about. I wish more than anything he was still with us, but a small comfort to those who loved him as I do, is to know he passed on preparing for the show of all time doing what he loved most and deep down he knew his comeback was unstopable and he would again reign worldwide as the KING OF POP!",1257206400,2,1120,4.090909090909091
3971035,5,B002R0EIVI,"This movie is a monument to two things: one of the greatest entertainers in the music world, and what would have been one of the greatest concerts of all time.  Unfortunately, Mr. Jackson died before his dream ""final curtain call"" tour could become a reality.  But the concert director Kenny Ortega has pieced together 2 hours worth (from over 100 hours of rehearsal footage) of song, dance, interviews, and on-stage video from the concert.  The result is absolutely stunning.  In this movie you have two hours of pure entertainment.  You will want to sing and dance along with Jackson and his crew as they rehearse for an awe-inspiring curtain.  And how awe-inspiring it is!  Some of the highlights: Jackson cut into scenes from GILDA and other film noir classics leading into the toe-tapping SMOOTH CRIMINAL.  An on-stage ""toaster"" that pops dancers out from under floor boards.  A ""cherry-picker"" that lifts MJ out over the audience during the rockin' BEAT IT.  What about a new, goulish THRILLER?  All of these songs are familiar and appealing.  We love hearing them, and watching MJ rehearse them is a delight.  There are old favorites (all of the afore mentioned pieces) and some new ones I hadn't heard before (I JUST CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU, and a gut-wrenching EARTH SONG).  You want to get up and dance with him and his amazing crew.  However, in the back of your mind, you know that it was never to be.  MJ met his tragic end before he could see his dream concert through to reality.  In the rehearsal footage, he looks so healthy and energetic.  It's hard to look at him up on the stage, so intoxicated with the infectious music, with the knowledge that, in two months time, he will be dead.  The world will always mourn the loss of a talented star.  However, we will always have THIS IS IT, his labor of love.  Whatever demons haunted MJ behind the curtain, on-stage he was and always will be The King of Pop.  THIS IS IT shows us that.  It is outstanding.",1257206400,2,1967,4.621387283236994

Something we have never seen before.  He is such an amazing performer and a kind, caring person.  Parts will make you laugh and parts will leave you wishing it didn't all end on June 25th.  People had said that Michael would probably not approve of these sessions being shown because he was such a perfectionist, but Kenny Ortega would not have done it if he felt it was hurtful to Michael.  It was well put together and really showed a side of Michael that most people have never seen.  To see him create his vision was such a great gift he shared with us.  His passion for his work and dedication to his fans are very evident in this movie.  He cared so much for people -  its really a shame that the media couldn't let him be -  He is finally getting the recognition that he truly deserves.

3971038,5,B002R0EIVI,"I went to see the movie this past Friday afternoon. Within the first song that MJ sung I got sad as well as upset. Upset from the media who completley bashed him and saying he was unable to perform. If he were alive today I would pay top dollar to have gone to that concert if I could afford it.  MJ was AMAZING with the dancing and his singing. Everyone was. He was alive on the stage and showed what a serious performer he was. He showed how important it was to execute his craft.  It was nice to see a fun side of him as well as his smile.

I appreciate being able to see this video footage.  I am so happy the fans have come out to show support of MJ and to see this film. When the movie was done the audience applauded when the credits came on. As a fan it had been a dream of mine to see MJ perform.  For me it has always been about the music and dancing.  I had hoped that the ""This is it"" tour would have come to the US and that MJ would have changed his mind to come back here.

If this is the way I need to see him then I have only happy memories of one of the greatest entertainers of all time.",1257120000,,1105,3.8201754385964914
3971039,2,B002R0EIVI,"When the cardboard cutout of Michael appeared in front of the bulldozer, this film showed how boring it was.
A performer who begins to believe his own hype, who doesn't bother to really rehearse with his dancers or musicians, yet expects them to ""know"" his material and what he wants...who prances back and forth doing a few dance steps that had been done over and over for years, and has dancers doing all the work and when the voice wasn't singing in tune and songs had to be growled out...it goes to show  that this man would never have made it to the tour dates.  He wasn't up to par, hadn't really worked on anything and all the ""special effects"" were still on computer...costumes weren't made, nothing was ready.  These rehearsals were glued pieces obviously showing he never finished a full song, but had bits and chunks cobbled together.  It did not show any type of genius...just re-runs of better times that happened 25 years ago.
The film was hyped to take in the fans....succeeded in that...but as an art/documentary...it was not revealing or barely watchable.  They should have left it in the box.",1257120000,12,1110,4.701030927835052

I went into the Premiere that Tuesday Night in Los Angeles, Ca expecting to be sad.  To shed some tears and remember what a tragedy his death was.  TO my suprise I didn't cry much at all.
On the contrary...

I SMILED! :)
He looked amazingly upbeat, STRONG, smart, and oh so smooth!

I Laughed! :D
His humor and manner of speaking he used with his staff and co-workers gave me some insite as to who this reclusive man ""really"" was.  Not the harsh picture that media has published for years but of a kind, funny, and loving man!

I DANCED! (In my seat ofcourse) haha
The music and his voice were tremendously vibrant and haunting.  His new variations on old classics like ""The Way you Make me Feel"" and ""Human Nature"" truely touches you!

I was in ""Awe"" of his musical genius!
His perfectionism is displayed in this film.  Not in a snobbish or snotty fashion but in a wise and as a ""True Master of his Craft"" kinda WAY!

Yes, Michael did look a bit thin BUT when was he ever BIG??? He's always been a slinder man with a dancers body!  One thing I can tell you is this film definetely shows Mj in his area of expertise...DANCE!

The Dancers half his age or younger marveled in his shadow as the King of POP took to the stage in marvelous dance sequences.

In all this film is a great relief to grief stricken MJ FANS and a re-birth of Michael's image to those who never recognized his talent before.  Or failed to accept it! (Due to lackluster media lies) :(

I've been a fan since a little girl of 7 and will continue to be.  You do NOT have to be a fan of Michael Jackson's to appreciate this film.  You simply should be a person who appreciates the man's hard work, artistic expression, dedication and L.O.V.E for ones passion!

Go see it! It's great <3
Movie Tip:  Stay till the very end of the film.  After the credits and all...You won't regret it! ;)",1257120000,,2136,4.324937027707809
3971041,5,B002R0EIVI,I enjoyed seeing Michael Jackson dance and sing.  And what a bonus to see his musical/creative genuis as he worked with the musicians and performers.  I highly recommend this movie.  It would be hard for anybody to deny that he was an incredible performer and artist.,1257120000,,267,4.760869565217392
3971042,5,B002R0EIVI,I saw this movie on Oct. 31st and it was such a beatuiful moment.. I loved it and so did the rest of y family. I just bought it and im so glad that im one of the first that will own this amazing movie,1257120000,,200,3.466666666666667
3971043,2,B002R0EIVI,"This Is It shows Michael Jackson rehearsing for what would have been a series of concerts at the London's O2 Arena.

For me the most fascinating part of this film, was hearing Michael Jackson delivering incredible Live Vocals on Earth Song, Billie Jean, Man In The Mirror and made me what a great show MJ just singing live with reduced dancing and NO lip synching would have been, you would have had a Kick-ass LIVE ROCK CONCERT.

This wasn't really a documentary as much as Kenny Ortega would have you believe, because if it was, it would have documented the events of June 25 2009, which is the entire reason MJ isn't on stage - the film forgets to mention this.

It was also very poorly edited and cut.
To begin you should have had MJ announcing the O2 dates at the arena, you then go back in time to the LA STAPLES ARENA and show a stage being constructed for live rehearsals and then film Michael Jackson arriving for DAY 1 of rehearsals as well as overdubbs of MJ talking about how he envisioned the show etc.

To end the film, they should have shown an empty and derelict O2 arena on what would have been the opening night, with a poster outside saying ""Michael Jackson Concert Cancelled"" - because this would bring home to every person, that this is something you will never see Michael Jackson doing again ever !!!!

They need to re-edit this film big time !!!!",1257120000,15,1370,4.442231075697211
3971044,5,B002R0EIVI,"This movie was better than I expected filled with some sadness, lots of laughs. You leave learning a lot more about the man we call The King Of Pop.

If you can see this on the big screen in the theaters you should, because no dvd will capture all the energy coming throught the screen.

I love you Michael Jackson... and miss you with all my heart!",1257120000,,349,4.1940298507462686
3971045,5,B002R0EIVI,"I saw THIS IS IT in IMAX and it was an absolute thrilling experience. The huge screen and over 30 surround sound speakers made you feel as though you were at a live concert. Tickets were $12. but worth it. At the end of our showing, movie goers continued to sit in their seats. No one wanted to leave the theater because we all felt the sadness of never seeing Michael in live concert again. Michael showed his genius behind the scenes by fine tuning musical notes and his choreography. You left the theater thinking Michael couldn't have been 50 years old the way he danced with his 20+ year old back-up dancers, who clearly idolized him. And you also left knowing how special Michael was and thanking GOD for allowing Michael to briefly visit with us.",1257120000,,753,4.5036496350364965
3971046,5,B002R0EIVI,"Just saw it at a completely sold out show..although its just a documentary of various scenes put togeather by a great director from the Rehersal of a sold out concert that was to be held. the audience at the movie hall went crazy cheering & singing along with the songs. If this concert actually took place, it would have been someting none of us have experienced till date. The coreography, the dancers, the effects,, the costumes, the sets..in fact everything was to be a treat of a lifetime & its Extremely Sad that during the last years of his life 'MICHAEL JACKSON' was slaughtered by the press, his appearance, his acts were all made fun of..few remembered all great things he did, the love he spread, the world he tried to change thru his great voice & awesome music..Its Sad he's not here to see all this love now..I guess we only value things after they are gone........",1257120000,,879,4.569620253164557
3971047,5,B002R0EIVI,"I wholeheartedly concur with all the wonderful comments of the other posters.  I have seen THIS IS IT twice in the theater.  I was at the first midnight showing on October 27, 2009.  Being I am a long time Michael Jackson fan, I expected to leave the theater in tears.  I really do love him.  Surprise!  He made me laugh with his lovely sense of humour.  ""I'm sizzlin'.""  LOL!  You'll know what I mean when you see the film.  Once again, Michael Jackson gave me joy and laughter.  He delighted me.  It was a wonderful gift to see him up on the big screen, rehearsing, creating.  I LOVE his voice and I am crazy about his dancing.  I never tire of him.  He still had it.  He was a MASTER PERFORMER.  I am grateful that his fantastic dancers were there to cheer him on, what was to be, his final impromptu performance of Billy Jean.  I am excited about getting this film on DVD.  I hope they add a lot more rehearsal footage to the DVD.  I want to see more.  This DVD is  a definite ""must have"" purchase.  For long time MJ fans, your collection of his work is incomplete without it.  Much gratitude to Kenny Ortega and all that worked with Michael.  I love you, Michael.

3971049,5,B002R0EIVI,"I loved this film. The entire world reacted to Michael Jackson's death. There have been countless tributes, many tears shed, many books written and/or re-released, many Facebook groups and websites created in his honor and an inestimable amount of media time in the form of news articles, interviews and analyses about Michael Jackson and the Jackson family since he passed in June. The emotional grief reaction to his passing on a global scale, has been unprecedented.

I am so glad to see this final tribute to his life. As I watched, I could feel the love in the editing. Mr. Kenny Ortega did a wonderful job crafting together this beautiful quilt of a movie with love and devotion to his friend's spirit.

This movie has helped to clarify Michael's legacy and messages of love for each other and caring for the planet. This movie has raised the energetic vibration of the earth in a time when it is so needed. It was uplifting to see someone in the public eye behave so graciously and politely to others as he worked, as today, it seems to be accepted to be rude to others and to get one's point of view across at any cost.

It is so bittersweet, as Michael himself wanted to deliver this message, and of course, the live performances would've been spectacular.  But that was not to be, God had other plans. I was so glad to see this artist in full maturity, delivering entertainment, yet so much more in his final message of unity and conservation.",1257120000,,1453,4.598455598455598
3971050,5,B002R0EIVI,"As a life-long fan of the J5/Michael Jackson, my heart was overwhelmed by this production. I remember as a little girl watching Michael and his brothers perform on the Ed Sullivan and the Carol Burnett show. Many years later, I'm overwhelmed at what I see before me.

I haven't read through the other reviews, but I can rest assured that anyone that gaive this documentary a ""5"" star, I will cosign and concur. Michael was bigger than life. This movie had me laughing, crying, singing, and wanting to dance in the aisle. Everyone from the dancers to the musicians to Ortega worked together to make this a must-see. If you are a MJ fan, you can't miss it!

RIP, Michael. We miss you so much, but thank you for leaving your gift to those of us that love you!!!

EXCELLENT!!!",1257120000,,772,4.5

3971052,5,B002R0EIVI,"Cried my eyes out...
It could've been the most historical concert ever! He knew his music, he knew is key, his tempo, his songs, his moves, his cues... He knew all his stuff, he knew what he wanted. You thought all the songs were old and basically the same thing, but in deed he was creating a new version for every single one of them he was about to bring to the world and his fans. London doesn't know what it's missing. England doesn't know. The world doesn't know what it has missed...
Michael, we love you! We really do! RIP",1257033600,2,529,4.247524752475248
3971053,5,B002R0EIVI,I saw this movie yesterday. It is great and i would love to see it again and again. What an entertainer he was and still is to me. Great music! Great movie!,1257033600,,156,3.90625
3971054,5,B002R0EIVI,"This movie was truly a gift and a pleasure watching.  Even though it would've been phenomenal to see live in concert, if Michael was living, but it was so filled with intimacy and L-O-V-E. Intimacy with his music and LOVE with his fans and infamous talents being discovered with him on his tour.  Regardless of the tragic death of our beloved Michael, I think that this movie was wonderfully put together since it was only made originally for Michael's personal collection. It just really showed how serious and fun it was working with michael and his love for his fans and the emotional feel for music.  He was a perfectionist in the most humble and respectful way. NOT ONCE did Michael yell at anyone that didn't get the lighting right or if they came in too soon on the music. He was indeed a hands-on type artist and he truly inspired me even more as a singer/performer in the music industry. I loved this side to Michael and everyone he choose to be apart of ""This is it"" Tour were sincerely greatful and appreciative to this moment and opportunity in michael's life. It is a must see BUT ONLY if you ar a TRUE MJ FAN.  If you are a TRUE MJ FAN, it doesn't matter how the production of the movie was or if it was put together nicely or if Michael didn't seem to put out alot in singing/dancing or if they didn't run a full dress rehearsal...it just doesn't MATTER!!! Any time you SEE michael share himself WITH LOVE to you whether its on the stage or off the stage in VIDEO, is a moment to embrace and love on. Another incredible HISTORIC MOMENT OF THE LIFE OF MICHAEL J. JACKSON and HIS MUSIC.",1257033600,,1599,4.373737373737374
3971055,5,B002R0EIVI,"As we all know, just a short while before Michael Jackson and his incredibly talented group of dancers and musicians were to take off to London for his final series of concerts, Jackson lost his long battle with drug addiction and just like that, the candle that had burned for fifty years was snuffed out.  Michael Jackson was the entertainer of the century, maybe even the greatest entertainer of all times.  Hundreds of years from now, people will read passages about him in the history books: a man who revolutionized pop music, a man who furthered the progress of African Americans, and a man who danced his way into immortality.  However, sadly, he was not immortal.  He was a human being who struggled, hurt, and felt pain just like everybody else.  As you watch this movie, you see not the freak or wacko that people have made him out to be but instead the person who loved his fans and loved and supported the people he worked with.

The film opens up with dancers from all over the world sharing one thing in common: They are living the dream of working with the legend himself.  As the movie progresses we indeed see that Michael was a person just like everybody else.  Whether he has trouble hearing the music through his ear receiver, laughs at the jokes cracked by his sound producer, or encourages his musicians to play better, he constantly displays his strengths and vulnerabilities as a person.  Through out his career people either glorified him as a God or demonized him as a perfect embodiment of the overrated celebrity who craved attention more than love.  While Michael liked to show off his talent to his fans he really was a true artist at heart.  He was an artist in his innovations over what pop music was.  He was one of the first to really fuse pop music with visuals which gave us videos like, ""Thriller"" and, ""Billie Jean"".  Just as The Beatles revolutionized music in the 60s, Michael did the same thing for nearly three decades.

In the film, we see many classics performed during dress rehearsals.  Keep in mind that these are not always full songs and they often lack the energy of a full blown concert performance.  The purpose of this film is not to show a concert performance anyway.  One of its purposes is to show the behind the scenes aspect of the show.  You learn how the special effects team multiplies ten solders into ten hundred solders for the, ""They Don't Really Care About Us"" number.  You learn how makeup was applied to the dancers for the considerably updated performance of, ""Thriller"".  And much of the time you see Michael working tediously with musicians ,trying to get just the right sound for all his songs.  Another purpose for this film is of course to entertain movie-goers with the classic songs they've all come to know and love and to give them one final chance to see Michael himself perform them.  Classics like the 90s Hip-Hop style stompers, ""Jam"", and ""They Don't Really Care About Us"", are here, as are the tender ballads, ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"", and ""The Man In The Mirror"".  And what Jackson performance would be complete without the Jackson Five nostalgia of, ""I Want You Back"", and ""I'll Be There""?
There is a little something from every stage of his career, so all fans young and old will find something here to enjoy.

The main purpose of this film, however is really to give the fans a final farewell to a man who died too soon.  An obscured cut off of his, ""Dangerous"", album called, ""Gone Too Soon"", will take on a whole new meaning, especially since his death simply did not have to happen.  What this film ultimately succeeds in doing is putting a human face on an iconic legend and showing us that even the most immortal figures in history were just as vulnerable as the rest of us.  Indeed you don't have to be a God to make a difference in the world.  I hope people enjoy this film as much as I did.",1257033600,,3893,4.546628407460545
3971056,5,B002R0EIVI,"I have seen ""This Is It"" twice now and it is truly a beautiful sight to see this incredible talent!  I feel a great sadness that such a gentle soul has left this, often times, not so gentle world.

3971057,5,B002R0EIVI,"Using the word *comeback* would do Michael a disservice. He was always here, just awaiting his return. ""This Is It"" only reminds us of Michael Jackson's phenomenal talent and overpowering persona as a master musician, musical genius, showman, creative mastermind and genuinely humble, funny and loving person.

This is a remarkable movie, astounding sound and wonderfully edited. We are treated to dress rehearsals and song rehearsals for Michael's London shows, getting a peek at what would have truly been the greatest concert ever produced and performed. Michael re-imagined ""Thriller"" and ""Smooth Criminal"" while also giving us staples like ""Beat It"", ""Billie Jean"" ""Wanna be Startin' Somethin'"" and ""Human Nature"".

While Michael looks underweight in some scenes, he is still clearly in top form physically and mentally, never tiring and seemed ready to meet the challenges of touring. He is on top of his game, commanding the stage in a bossy yet endearing manner; he knows his songs inside and out and wants nothing less than perfection and his dancers and crew happily comply. Ortega is in control in his own right, but certainly never forgets who is the real boss. He is humble and respectful, but knows what he's doing and is Michael's excellent right hand man. He genuinely likes Michael and wants these to be the shows of shows. Over the top is not in his vocabulary.

As a reviewer noted, this was a prime opportunity to mess things up and mess up his legacy. If you are thinking 'how is that possible?' It's possible. It's all in the footage and editing and they did an excellent job. I know there are conspiracies that the footage chosen just masks many days of a frail, feeble Michael who would struggle through 10 shows, let alone 50. I believe Michael had bad days, but overall, OVERALL Michael was ready. ""This Is It"" is a sure testament that Michael was excited to be doing what he not only loved, but was born to do: Entertain. He owned the stage and it was home. There was an almost angelic glow around him when he was in his element; Michael practically had his own brand of musical hearing. I believed he could hear notes, key changes and beats that no one else did. The slightest chord off kilter would set him on fire. Remarkable and amazing to watch. When he said ""Let it sizzle"" you actually knew what he meant, it made his musicians better musicians.

We're told this footage was for his own personal library, and some people think Michael would not want us to see him being anything less than perfect--the thing is, even in practice he was, oddly, perfect. I think it was hard for him to do anything--musically anyway--so bad he wouldn't want us to see. He hit the melodies of Human Nature so perfectly you wondered if the record was playing.

The stage shows would have blown people away, from the Thriller 3D and ""Smooth Criminal"" video immersion alone, before we even got to the million man march of ""They Don't Really Care About Us"" and the ever remarkable ""Billie Jean"" number. Michael was not lying when he said he would get ""nourished"" from his audience. When the audience saw this concert live he would have absorbed so much love he might have imploded.

Speaking of Love, it is also a running theme. Michael loves everyone it seems, and is not afraid to say it. He scolds and corrects with L.O.V.E. and it is great. He is fun and funny, jokes and flirts and is always polite and sweet. Talk about a dream boss! Michael is the ultimate performer and a beautiful person inside and out.

Michael's loss to the world and music world still stings and it is sad that his tireless dancers and crew did not get to make history, but to grace the stage with the master has to mean something. Michael Jackson fans will drool over this movie--which steers clear of anything negative. We're here for his music legacy and we get it. Ortega gets a pat on the back. You can not watch just once, I hope the DVD gives more songs in their entirety. Excellent and a must see in theaters.

I still cannot believe he is gone. I lived in my own reality that he could never die. It is quite depressing that these are his last moments, but I am happy to have them. I am grateful that instead of remembering rumors of the propofol overdose and the rush to the hospital and the memorial as my last images, I have Michael being joyful and funny doing what he loved to do. It gives slight closure to the most remarkable, fascinating, ingenious, humble person who ever graced this earth. We will never get another one. His Legacy will never die.

I will love him forever.",1257033600,4,4580,4.616707616707616

The positive adjectives one needs to describe this film are limitless; amazing, awe inspiring, powerful, fantastic, and thrilling immediately come to mind.  Unfortunately, tragic and painful are also fitting and necessary.  When the knowledge sinks in that we are literally watching the last days of Michael's life, it is also a stunningly heartbreaking final encounter with the greatest performer who ever lived.

Michael's artistic talent and influence, his drive, vision, gentleness, courage, and devotion simply have no match in the world. Watching him interact with musicians and dancers is sheer joy. As usual, although there are many gorgeous and talented young people dancing and singing with him, it's simply impossible to take your eyes off of Michael himself when he is on camera.  He was pure magic, and true to form, he was planning the show of shows, a completely spectacular event. What a tragedy that all of those wonderfully talented people working with him will never fully realize their dream of a lifetime, to perform with the legendary Michael Jackson, and we will never see the finished product; the gift he wanted so much to give his fans and his children.

My only wish for this film is that it would never end. May Michael's urgent, lifelong message to Heal The World and nurture its children inspire each of us into immediate, positive action.",1257033600,2,1430,5.038135593220339

I just feel really sad for all the people that worked for him when they found out the bad news.  I cried a few times watching it, but it was still phenominal.  I love Michael forever.

3971065,5,B002R0EIVI,"I saw ""This Is It"" just last night, and, after being initially skeptical of the motivations of Sony for producing this film, I must say I'm quite pleased with the outcome and was joyous at its conclusion.

""This Is It"" honors and celebrates the final days of the preeminent uber performer of our time and captures his creative genius in a very poignant and heartfelt manner.

In these rehearsals are Michael's clear energy, focus, and perfectionism- even after being absent from the stage for over a decade.  But also are the expected marks of a performer more seasoned, and perhaps even, just a bit older.  Yes, sometimes the moves were not as sharp, the voice not as smooth as the man of two decades ago.  But one really doesn't see much of that, especially when looking at a man who out-does dancers and singers, some more than half his age.

It was said by some Sony execs that the world has missed one helluva concert.  After watching the movie, I can say I wholeheartedly agree.  But more, we miss the great souled talent who captivated us for forty-five years of his life, never stopping in his quest to entertain, enlighten, and heal our hurting world.

I'm looking forward to adding this movie to my personal MJ collection, and believe it will provide closure, particularly to those hearts still wide open with sorrow at Michael Jackson's untimely death.

It is indeed worthy.

MJ, you are missed.",1257033600,3,1406,4.697959183673469
3971066,5,B002R0EIVI,"This Is It shows that to the very end the King of Pop possessed all the elements that made him a superstar.  Here we see the preparation for his ill-fated London Comeback, but even though we all know how this story ends you can't help but smile when you see Michael in his home element and just having fun.  The most intriguing part about this documentary is the lack of actual Michael Jackson dialogue, but you can totally feel in his expressions the gears that work busily within; he was pouring every ounce of effort he could muster into this final effort to thrill the world.

This is Michael Jackson unlike he's been seen in years.  Here he sings all of his songs live, even fast-past ones such as Jam, They Don't Care About Us, and Smooth Criminal - this element also really shows the fans how truly exhausting it was for him to put give the crowds dancing and singing, and this footage makes it obvious why for the Dangerous and History tours he had to lip sync several faster numbers.

Many signature MJ dance moves are omitted, and I wish we could have seen some of the rehearsal footage without the occasional distraction of the 3-D short films (wish they had put it in a split screen so we could see that footage AND the stage performance at the same time).

Highlight performances of the rehearsal are definitely as follows:
They Don't Care About Us
I Just Can't Stop Loving You
I'll Be There
Thriller (totally new production than the one used in Dangerous and History tours!)
Beat It (first time in years I've seen him do the dance same as he did in 1982!)

The others are good as well, but none of them are nearly as crisp, or polished as those numbers of the rehearsal.  Key point of this rehearsal footage is getting to getting to hear him sing his hits live, and it would have been better if the This Is It album included those instead of the studio versions...Also, Michael's new female guitarist is great (on the eyes and on the ears).

Many signature MJ dance moves are omitted, and I wish we could have seen some of the rehearsal footage without the occasional distraction of the 3-D short films (wish they had put it in a split screen so we could see that footage AND the stage performance at the same time).  So in fairness it isn't at all an MJ concert experience, but it does have all the elements of one.

The tagline of ""Get to know the man you never knew"" isn't really accurate because there's very little of actual Michael Jackson dialogue outside of seeing him say ""God bless you"" to everyone in the production team and noting when he thinks something needs to be changed about the way something's being done.

All and all this is probably going to be remembered as being the greatest concert that never happened in the history of music.  From these few, vague snippets of what the actual This Is It concert we can see that Michael would have had a huge comeback through this concert series, and that once more he has proven that he was, and always will be the King of Pop.

It is a reminded, that even though tabloids tried to cast him in evil light, Michael Jackson's ONLY message was one of love.  L.O.V.E. plain and simple.",1257033600,3,3157,4.437716262975779

3971068,5,B002R0EIVI,I just saw the movie and like some have already said you leave the movie with happiness and sadness. Happiness because of the pure GENIUS MJ was and sadness because he didn't even make it to opening night! OH how I wish he could have it least performed it live  once!! You can tell the show was going to be SUPERB. All that hard work had to come to a screeching halt with MJ death. EVERY entertainer today should see this to see how a pure GENIUS plans a show. He put his hand on EVERY PART of this production. And how humble he was and nice he was to  the everyone he worked with. I CAN'T WAIT until this comes out on DVD!!,1257033600,2,624,4.024193548387097

Fantastic tribute to a fantastic superstar.

3971070,5,B002R0EIVI,"I saw this film last night, and it was truly outstanding and exciting!  It shows a side to Michael Jackson that we have not seen before.  The rehearsals were beautiful!  Michael was involved in every aspect of production, and he was very gracious, humble, and hard-working.  He still had his amazing talent at age 50... The music, dancing and singing were excellent!  I can't stop thinking about how beautiful and wonderful this movie was!  How well-made it was! I could watch it again and again! I wish I could have seen Michael perform the show live in London! I am so glad I was able to see this wonderful film and will miss Michael very much!  May God bless Michael and the wonderful Jackson family!",1257033600,2,703,4.576
3971071,5,B002R0EIVI,"I went to see ""This Is It"" Friday night. I thought it would be a sad film, but was only sad to see it end. The depth of perfectionism and care that Michael put into his projects is amazing. He always gave 100% and then some in everything he did. I grew up listening to Michael, and like many others, was never fortunate enough to see him in concert. But I feel that he is a part of each one of us, and his legacy will live on forever. Thanks to Kenny Ortega for stepping up and taking the reigns on this movie. It gave us all a small peek into Michael's heart and vision, and we all feel that we know him better now. What a beautiful person he was - inside and out. Every person who had the opportunity to work with him, learn from him, should feel privledges.

It left me wanting more, I didn't want to get up and leave the theatre. This is my only way to ever see him perform being that i was a kid when he did his last concerts, but i'll take this. man i cant wait for the DVD, so i can watch him all the time. I would pre order but i want my copy the day its availiable. everyone should go watch this and keep MJ alive in our hearts. now im addicted and have to go see it many more times before its out of theaters =]",1257033600,,628,3.952755905511811
3971073,5,B002R0EIVI,"This is by far an amazing production of his last performance. I was in such aw as I have always been whenever I saw him perform. He was so talented. He could sing and dance like no other. He was always such a kind and gentle person. He never pretended to be something he wasn't. He never seemed to act like he was better than anyone else. I also noticed that whenever you see him he never has jewelry on or very little. To me that show he's not trying to act like he is all that. He didn't need the bling. Some of the cloths he wore with the sparkle and glitter was all he needed. To me he was a real man who love to perform with the well chosen clothing for his performances. Even his outfits where classic. He was human nature.(And boy could he dance and sing) You usally see other famouse people always showing off with there bling, which to me is just not very tasteful. He was never all about that. He was just a GREAT performer. He didn't have to do all the yelling and cursing to become one of the best performers(and boy could he dance and sing) since Elvis. He was such a loving person.(And boy could he dance and sing) It is sad to know now how much he suffered in pain that he had to use pain killers and eventually became addicted to them. It saddens me to know how much pain he must have been in. Physically and mentally.  And how some people believed the false accusations made against him. It saddens me to this day to know that some of the people actually believed the accusations that were brought against him. I also still believe it was all about money, as it always is when someone doesn't want to work for themselves and wants a free ride in life. He loves people and he especially loved children. I  hope his children can carry on his legacy and know that they are one of the luckiest people in the world to have had a father who was such a great performer to share there lives with, and to have shared with us.
As I watched the performance I felt like I was at his concert. I felt the need to applaud as I watched. I also sang along with the songs. And at the same time I was choked up watching and knowing he is no longer with us and what a shame it is. I know I could have watched much more of it. I just didn't want it to end.  It is just such a shame  he had to leave us because of a fateful mistake. To me there is just no reason he should have had to go from us through the falt of the medication that was administered to him. I hope that the doctor has to face some kind of consiquence for his mistake. He being a physician should have know better. He administered to much different kinds of medicines in to short a period of time to Michael and he also should have know that what he was giving him  was to much especially for the weight that Michael was at. He didn't let enough hours pass between the medications administered. But poor Michael paid the ultimate price again. I pray he is resting in peace now.
But if you see no other movie this year. Let this be the one you make a point to go and see. I promise you you will not be sorry no matter what you even thought of him in the past.
""And Boy could he sing and dance.""
God Bless you all, as Michael would say.

3971074,5,B002R0EIVI,"Fantastic representation of who Michael Jackson was. I had heard and read of his perfectionism and inability to settle for anything less than his personal best; however, this film truly embodies and lives up to the hype. He was a kind soul whose work radiated love, faith, and hope. It's all about the ""L-O-V-E"". Truly a must see for any MJ fan.",1257033600,,345,4.580645161290323
3971075,5,B002R0EIVI,"I saw the movie on 10/29/09 although I had bought advance tickets for a later date. But I just had to see it sooner and I'm glad I did. The film was refreshingly wonderful and so engaging, although the theater audience was mostly quiet throughout. However, there were moments of laughter at some points as the audience experienced MJ's funny and playful side. But for the most part, everyone were quiet having their own personal experiences and individual emotions as they witnessed this momentous event. And at the end everyone applauded. The movie really was done with integrity to represent Michael Jackson in an honorable way. Kenny Ortega, Michael's long-time friend and creative partner, clearly must have really understood the real Michael Jackson. It has been a long time since Michael has been so respectfully represented by anyone.

You can clearly see that putting together the ""This is It"" concert series was indeed a labor of love for everyone involved and Michael was the one orchestrating and commanding the whole thing. His dedication, hard work, passion, loving encouragement and leadership were quite evident in the film. It's unfortunate that much of these traits and the real goodness of Michael Jackson as a person were so tarnished by ill-willed personal assaults while he was alive. I hope that we will see much more of these wonderful and truthful portrayals of the man who committed his whole life to giving and sharing his gift and talents even in the midst of much ridicule. He was beyond genius, he embodied music, dance, artistic vision; and always managed to bring us on the ride of our lives.

3971078,4,B002R0EIVI,"Going in, I hadn't really known what to expect, aside from his rehearsal footage. As it turns out, ""This Is It"" was what his concert would've been, if he had been alive to stage it. What stuck out most from the interviews was their dedication to their work, and it was because of Michael Jackson's direct and intimate touch with how he wanted his concert to be. Throughout the show, and since this was rehearsal footage, we got to see Jackson focus so strongly on his songs and choreography. The movie is a testament to his genius and poor substitute for what should have been the pinnacle moment of his career.

I'm a die-hard fan of Michael Jackson. this is a movie where you cheer, shed tears, clap along to the beat, get your grove on, and scream your lungs out. We are not allowed to do any of that in a theater are we? but trust me once this movie starts you cant get enough of his music. all your childhood dreams flows right in to you mind with his moves. you feel like get on your feet and dance along.

It's truly a pity he didn't live to perform this concert because the creativity that he poured into every minute aspect of the show from background video footage, to costume, choreography, selecting his dancers, etc. just had me in awe. Decades on, his lyrics are as timely today as they were then, and in fact, so much before their time even. The respect from people who worked with and around him was obvious in this movie.

3971087,5,B002R0EIVI,"FANTASTIC!!!  What a great movie.  I saw the This Is It Movie on Halloween afternoon, 10/31/09.  I can't say enough wonderful things about it.  I was in awe at the sheer talent and energy exhibited by Michael Jackson.  I saw a part of him that I might never have seen if he had lived, though I would much prefer he was alive.  He was so at ease with everyone involved and showed what a truly wonderful human being he was.  He showed so much compassion and love for the people he performed with and the human race in general.  I had no idea how much work, energy, effort and thought went into his performances.  I watched him fly through the rehearsals like the expert superstar that he was.  There will never, ever be another Michael Jackson - no one can come close to being at his level.  He knew exactly how everything should sound, when it should be heard, how loud or soft it should be, everything.  And he was the man in charge - the one who called the shots at all times.  I kept wondering how he could possibly know all this and be so good at it.  I was amazed at his fabulous dance steps and his incredible voice.  Then I realized - no wonder he is the King of Pop - he has been doing this since he was a little boy.  It is in his blood, every cell of his body, it was his whole life.  He was awesome in the rehearsals and I know he would have been even more amazing than anyone could imagine if he had lived to perform the London shows.  It would have been his life's greatest accomplishment.  But I am so pleased and profoundly grateful to his family and others who allowed This Is It the movie to be filmed.  I don't know if Michael would have liked it if he knew we would see him rehearsing rather than the live performance, but given the circumstances, I know he would be happy that his family left a great treasure for his fans around the world in this movie.  I can't wait to own the DVD.  Of all the Michael Jackson DVDs, this one will be the most special to me.  He had no idea that this would be the last show for him.  I pray that he is in heaven singing and dancing with the angels and waiting on the rest of the world to catch up to him!  God Bless you Michael - I will always love you and appreciate the gift of your life and talents that you gave to the world.  I'll see you again one day when I get to heaven - just be sure to have your dancing shoes on!",1257033600,3,2378,4.049356223175966
3971088,5,B002R0EIVI,"Sometimes the hype gets in the way of letting us really see things for what they are. A few minutes into Michael Jackson's ""This Is It"" proves that this does not apply here.

No question about it - Michael holds back throughout these two hours of footage; these are part and parcel rehearsals. The filming is non-deliberate and unexacting. However, these truths serve to make ""This Is It"" all the more affecting. Like reading a diary entry, to see Michael in rehearsal is to see him totally unscripted and in-the-moment, the consummate professional even in spite of an arena full of empty seats.

""Billie Jean"" is stark and lovely, with Michael taking center stage without the help of dancers or back-up vocalists, strutting and spinning like in days of old. The simplicity of how this particular song was supposed to work is perhaps the most deeply affecting moment of the film

The bombast is handled with edge and precision on other selections, though. ""Earth Song"" mixes an impressive short film with on-stage spectacle, and ""They Don't Care About Us"" hits like a ton of bricks with Jackson's powerhouse vocals (lip-synced though they may be, this was a rehearsal), universal lyrics and dazzling body control as he adheres to the challenging choreography.

Some of the most rewarding moments come where they are least expected, such as when Michael and a sound technician lightly bicker over specificities of a track playback. It's particularly cute - not to mention entertaining and moving - to see Michael serenade the lucky young woman to sing the female part on ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You."" Toward the conclusion of the song Jackson reaches for some high notes, leaving the young singer staring at him in admiration. He kindly reminds her with a gesture of his arm that the audience will be in front of the stage; she had better face them, not him.

The professionalism of all involved is consummate and beyond reproach. The utter investment and enthusiasm exuded by the dynamic back-up dancers, musicians and crew, including director Kenny Ortega, are as befitting of a Michael Jackson project as could be imagined. Their blood, sweat and tears all dripped into this show and ""This Is It"" makes this abundantly clear, and the unbridled joy they shared sculpting this project is endlessly palpable.

Those looking for a full-on Michael Jackson concert will be better served by purchasing a Hi-Def TV with booming surround sound and slipping in the ""Dangerous: Live in Bucharest"" DVD. ""This Is It"" does not suit this purpose but is rather a unique, (semi)-unfiltered snapshot of the greatest concert that might have been, starring the greatest entertainer of his generation, if not all time. In that light it is certainly a film that is one of a kind, not to mention one that will be viewed with fascination for generations to come.

Could Michael have pulled off performing this show 50 times in London's 02? We'll never know, but ""This Is It"" ably demonstrates that if he had the results would have been eye-popping, sweet on the ears and downright startling - an overwhelming combination of sights and sounds to blow the minds of millions. For a man who set the bar so startlingly high a title like the King of Pop is only getting started.",1256947200,9,3252,4.859205776173285
3971089,5,B002R0EIVI,"I saw it tonight on Halloween.  I bought my ticket over a month ago, and I must say that it was well worth the wait.  I thoroughly enjoyed the film from beginning to end.  The audience in the theater was quiet throughout the whole movie, except to break out in spontaneous applause after one of Mike's performances.  It's hard to believe how good he still was.  Most of us didn't leave the theater until after the song This Is It was finished.  I've been a Michael Jackson fan for 3 quarters of my life.  I never got to meet the man in person, but this provided me with an insight into the type of person I've always suspected that he was; sweet, kind and generous, but at the same time a man who knew what he wanted and who was thoroughly in control when he was on stage.  MJ was really in his element here; he was confident and authoritative without being loud or abusive.  And the crew really appreciated this; you could tell how anxious they were to please him. He inspired everyone around him to want to do better.  This was just a rehearsal, so he supposedly wasn't giving his all here; but you could hardly tell that most of the time.  At age 50 Mike still had the voice, and the moves.  It was funny how the crew would watch him, mesmerized, and break out into applause after his routines.  The young people he chose as his dancers realized they were in the presence of royalty; you could see how star struck they were, and who could blame them?  It's a shame that the concerts never happened, but at least they did get to spend some time with the King.  I'm sure those memories will stay with them.  I loved how Michael encouraged the young female guitarist to take full advantage of her moment in the spotlight.  He was so kind that he didn't mind sharing the spotlight.  I really enjoyed it, but at the same time it made me sad, because this would have definitely put Mike back on top where he belonged, and now he'll never get that chance.  So unfair.

In this movie you will again get to see his captivating power and beauty of his soul and his music that made so many people become his fans.  This movie was not made like a documentary.  It was made more like trying to develop a DVD out of the real concert that was to be ""This is It"".  The concert, unfortunately, never got to see the light of day, therefore, this is the next best thing.  And it is the best!  The movie follows song after song, just like songs would be sung in the concert, and Michael sings his songs fully, in their entirety, even though this was just rehearsal.  There are spectacular effects and so much energy generated by Michael and the dancers.  There are some small commentaries in between the songs, and a little bit of interviewing here and there.  There is funny discussion between Michael and the director or the musicians at times.  And for some of the songs, he doesn't sing a few words in a verse, but of course, it was only rehearsal.  And for only a rehearsal, this movie is actually great.  He sings his songs as if they are sung in the studio, not live.  He always aimed for perfection.  And it was this perfection that consumed him too soon and took him away in the end.  But he will always be remembered in our hearts!  And for those who were never hard-core fans, like me, but only appreciated him for the entertainer that he was, I think after seeing this movie you will regret you were never a fan.  But it's never too late.  He still lives, in our minds and hearts, and his music will live forever in this world and maybe beyond.  A lot of us will realize only now what great human being Michael Jackson was...

Watching this pre-concert rehearsing was interesting and poignant.  One really got to know pieces of MJ through his musical behind-the scenes.  The concert could not be filmed, as it to take place eight days after all filming.  The videos were never meant to be public, as they were to be for Michael's personal files.  However, the splicing and sequenced practice sessions were brilliantly placed.  It was as complete as it could be.  Watching MJ displaying his musical brilliance and his warmth was worth the price of the ticket to the IMAX.

He is thin, but by no means ""frail"" as the media rumored at the news of his untimely death.  He was putting his all into this production and his inspiration was clearly to give the FANS something special.

He gave precise instructions of what he wanted; he was extremely dedicated and focused - you see those tiny flickers of ""genius"" that set him apart. The film shows just how much Michael was respected and admired; but he never acted like the ""king"" he was... He had mutual respect for his cast and crew and labeled them all a ""family"".  He never once acted like a prima donna. When the cast wasn't performing, they went out in to join the production crew as an ""audience"" - and you could tell they were as giddy and excited as any ""fan"" experiencing this remarkable talent. When they would whoop and clap after one of his performances, he would humbly smile and say ""God bless you.""  One thing I noticed is that when he did have to correct one of them, or explain what he expected on a musical piece or special effect, many times he'd follow his statement (which was made in a firm but soft voice) by saying  ""with love"".  I took this to mean what I've heard MJ quote many times - ""do everything with love in your heart.""  It is painfully obvious to the viewer that this was actually a nice guy. Yes, there still remain those with  mixed feelings after all the bad things that have been said about him.  Watch this and tell me if you still believe them - before this we only saw the MJ that the largely critical media wanted us to see.  And critics have to be reminded - this was REHEARSAL footage for Michael's PRIVATE collection.  We were never supposed to see all this.  While this footage may not capture him at his best - his full-on adrenaline concert performances, his most incredible costumes -  it nonetheless has HUGE merit. This is MJ raw - his most honest portrayal.  He was not an ""actor"" in this film.  He was oblivious to the camera. I truly hope that ""This is It"" will weigh heavily on the consciences of the critics, media, false friends and greedy accusers and abusers of Michael. This man gave his all and lived a tortured life in return.  I hold those aforementioned traitors responsible in part - a large part -  for his untimely death.

It's inspiring, riveting , bittersweet and funny.  MJ looked happy, confident and exuberant.  I found myself awestruck that this 50 year old could out dance someone half his age, and his voice was still as pure and strong as in his youth.  I found myself smiling and moving with the rhythms one minute -  then I would be struck with  profound sadness and in tears the next.  Many will watch This is It"" and truly mourn the loss of this man - not just this performer - this MAN.  A humanitarian and a father, and a human being that despite fame and riches probably led more of a lonely, tortured  life than any of use could possibly fathom.  Not knowing who to trust - who is truly a friend and not some leech with an agenda. Having those closest to him, turn on him for profit.  No wonder he only trusted children - they don't have an ""agenda"" (unless of course their parents give them one for financial gain.) He reminds me of an ADULT child who was abused and confused at innocence lost and never got the help he needed to free those demons.  And turning to medication to numb himself and silence the critics in his mind is a sad, human fact for millions, not just MJ.  But most people could cry for help and be heard.  I think MJ was past that point and he just survived as long as he could.

I am not (nor ever was)  an ""obsessed"" fan, or MJ groupie.  I went to two concerts and loved his music.  However, there was a time in the mid 90's, I'm ashamed to admit, when the negative press on MJ was at an all-time high and I thought that just ""maybe"" he wasn't such a nice guy.  I, like many of us, was very quick to judge based on the damning media, not the least of which was the airing of a MOCKumentary by ABC's Martin Bashir (who was an UNKNOWN until he did this to further his career and subsequent hire by ABC).  Bashir  ""befriended"" Michael and convinced him to let him do a special series entitled ""Living with Michael Jackson""  that would show audiences the ""REAL Michael"".  He came to feed on him like so many others and any ""human"" portrayal of MJ was left on the editing floor, using only the most damaging footage for his crucifixion.  Michael being the trusting innocent and LONELY person he was thought that Bashir  was his savior - when in fact, he was Judas. I hope MJ's death haunts Mr. Bashir  the rest of his life.  Years later, I realized I was wrong to believe any of the massive propaganda designed to dethrone the king.  But, too little too late.  The damage sent him spiraling and into exile for a decade.  In a sense, I am one of the guilty, and yes, that will haunt me.  I don't pretend that MJ wasn't very different than the masses definition of ""normal"",  he had flaws like every human.  It's just that his were put under a microscope by those who get off on destroying others lives so that they don't have to look at their own damaged goods.

On a positive note - there are plenty of fans who never once waivered in their admiration and love of Michael Jackson.  The first ten minutes of this film show his impact on all the dancers and entertainers that idolize him and were inspired by him.  Some even brought to tears by the magnitude of emotion with just being in his presence.

I was born 13 days before MJ;  I understand the point he was at in his years and the resolution that comes with examining your life at the ""half way point"".  I have two young boys who never experienced the Jackson 5 or the years when the King of Pop reigned.  But they were right beside me at this movie and no doubt now appreciate and understand this legend that has, sadly, been lost forever.  Sadly, MJ's death also became a lesson in the cost of fame and fortune, and both the lightness and extreme darkness of the human soul.

I can only hope this production causes all of us to examine our lives, our part in this world and with each other.  Let his legacy leave a lasting - positive - mark on this world.  That's all we can hope for at this point.",1256947200,16,6325,4.3174872665534805
3971100,5,B002R0EIVI,"I've already seen this AWESOME movie twice & I've also pre-ordered it on Blu-Ray.  There will NEVER be another like MJ, NEVER, HE IS THE KING PERIOD!!!!!!",1256947200,2,154,4.703703703703703
3971101,5,B002R0EIVI,"Just those words spoken @ his last major press conference.  Did Michael know?  He said, ""This is it, y'all.  This IS the final curtain call.""  On the surface, we know he meant, no more touring, no more performing.  But prophetically speaking, did he know?  I have been fortunate, as a child, to have seen him and his brothers perform in Atlantic City, NJ's Steel Pier as the Jackson 5ive as well as been present for many of his concerts as a solo artist.  So I have to ask the question again, did Michael Jackson know?  Did he feel somehow that his work here was done and he was leaving us?  Because if what I witnessed last evening was simply 'rehearsal footage' then maybe we, who he left behind, would not have been able to absorb the final product for that concert is playing non-stop on a much greater stage than what we have down here.  That movie/rehearsal is a masterpiece and a most loving, fitting, testament to what happens when GOD touches and enhances a soul.  I don't believe ""This Is It"" was just 120 hours of rehearsal footage for his final concerts, I choose to believe, that Michael Jackson knew.  He was so far ahead of his time, of course he knew and what that movie was and is, is a love letter not only to his children, his family, his fans, friends but to everyone that his music touched and will continue to touch.  This is it to those of us who never had the chance to see him perform while he was here.  This is it to those that saved up and then waited in line to buy tickets to these sold out shows.  This is it to show how 300% goes not only for showtime but for everything leading up to it.  His songs transcended and his music coursed thru you.  Well, it did me.  I can't count how many times he said 'God Bless You' during the film.  I can still see that haunting smile he shone as Kenny Ortega, said 'fade to black' @ the end of the ""They Don't Really Care About Us"" spectacular.  Some will say that ""This Is It"" is the final chapter in the life of an extraordinary talent and humanitarian.  It will be nominated, speculated, win many awards, break world records and then they will make a space on the shelf in the archives, wipe their hands, and be done with it.  Well, the party's not over, I choose to believe it's the start of a whole new book. For as long as there are folks like y'all and me who love this man, his music, what he stood for and tried to do, the rest is not silent and the final curtain has not fallen.  I love this man so very much and I'm fixin' to cry so, thanks, for reading.  Just my 3cents.",1256947200,20,2550,4.199588477366255
3971102,5,B002R0EIVI,"Wow, what a movie! Having seen MJ perform twice live during the Dangerous and History World Tours, it's a real pity we didn't get to see his creative genius culminate in This is It!

The movie provides glimpses of what was to be and it would have been a multimedia spectacular! Only someone like MJ could have had the vision of combining song and dance with film, on stage, with aerialists, fireworks and 3D effects.

The movie takes us through the songs that MJ was to perform. We see how he works with the musicians, director and choreographer. We see him laugh, goof up (e.g. forgetting the lyrics), chide, encourage, and most importantly, as he puts it ""sizzle"" and ""simmer"".

There are moments in the movie you feel his joy as he performs songs from the Jackson 5 era. He breaks into a smile at the end of ""They Don't Really Care About Us"". He ""misses his cue"" as the set for ""Smooth Criminal"" begins, but firmly tells the Director that no he didn't miss his cue, he's just ""sizzling"" i.e. taking in the audience's adulation. You see the perfectionist at work, but you also see his playful innocence as he enjoys his ride on the cherry picker that was supposed to take him over the crowd.

Of course there were his trademark dance moves and his undeniable talent for singing. He doesn't go all out in every song, but when he does you realize he still had the performer in him.

The movie is bittersweet. You feel his joy as he steps through his rehearsals, but at the end you're left thinking what could have been. I can't wait for the DVD to be released. Until then, fans and non-fans will just have to go to the movie theaters and watch glimpses of the concert that never came to fruition.",1256947200,2,1696,4.440514469453376
3971103,5,B002R0EIVI,"I went to see this and I was in awstruck, speechless infact, in what a extra phenomenal performer he was. He brought a new style of entertaining at a whole new level. It was Amazing especially ""smooth criminal"" how he integrated an old movie into this song, brilliant! Just the 3D effects alone are mind blowing, ""Thriller"" for instance, that would have been great to watch in all of its entirety,along with the powerful ""Earth Song"" and so much more. Michael out did himself in this movie and you can see that in every song, new dance moves. He had a uniqueness and creativeness beyond, and you see it in this movie. And not to mention he sounded GREAT,The king of pop still had it. His true geniuness with his crew, and dancers everything was with LOVE, and inspiration. I loved how Michael said this is your turn to shine, and I will be right here with you to his crew. Michael Jackson transcended LOVE and,His passion for inspiring us to better ourselves and to help save the planet is the message that you walk away with in this film. Michael Jackson was a kind soul, plain and simple. I am so glad that I was able to go and see Michael Jackson last performance,a few of us in the movie theater sang to his songs, you could feel his presence right through the film. It was so warm to embrace all of those who love Michael Jackson and miss him. I cried just alittle bit, but all in all I walked away happy, being able to watch him one last time. There was even the young embracing Michael-I hope he is smiling about this. Now we can with this DVD watch him over and over again, how cool is that. This is must see film you can watch the magic from a man who changed the world on so many levels, who is a genius in the music industry, and a legend for all of his humatarian charities, who deserves to be called THE KING OF POP-MIchael Joseph Jackson- Thank you for all that you have done for us, and leaving your beautiful footprints behind.",1256947200,5,1943,4.311475409836065
3971104,5,B002R0EIVI,"Who ever said that MJ had lost it was dead wrong.  If anything he was better than ever.  I saw the movie on October 28, 2009.  I wasn't sure what I was going to see.  This film is respectful of Michael's memory and although we all know that this film was put together so the AEG could regain the cash that was intially laid out for the concert, I truly do not believe that it was exploitative.  I was able to see this film and for 2 hours, at least, forget that Michael was gone.  It's pretty much wall to wall music but it's also a look at the behind the scene, creative genius of the man himself.  That's a glimpse of MJ that is rarely seen by the public.  The voice is still there, the dance moves have not faded.  What you also see is MJ's gentle nature and love for his fans.  He wanted the fans to hear what they remembered.  He would gently correct the band if one note was missing by saying, ""I know my music.""  He was not harsh but did demand perfection because he was a perfectionist.  If someone did miss a cue, he could be heard to say, ""that's why we have rehearsal.""  There are some interviews with the dancers and the band but mostly, it's just MJ doing his thing.  Michael Jackson fans will treasure this film.",1256947200,8,1226,4.157446808510638

What you will see is a miracle, a man in his 50s outperforming everyone and same time a great teamwork player. His love,respect and patience for the people around him is very obvious and mutual.
I am praying to god everyday that MJ would be some where better, i will always love you.",1256947200,3,596,4.527777777777778

Most special moment for me was when he called out the names of his brothers one by one and then his mom and dad during the rehearsal of I'LL BE THERE.  It was like a premonition. He spoke special words and then faded out to black.  WOW!!! Kenny Ortega and his gang did a phenominal job!  Kudos to Kenny for his commitment and dedication to creating this moving tribute to Michael!!!!  (Ny only concern was for Paris, Prince and Blanket for what their emotions probably were watching the Thriller part. -- I hope someone talked to them about that after they saw it).

3971109,5,B002R0EIVI,"""Amazing"" is such an over-used word, but not when you speak of MJ. This is a film I would watch over and over again just to see him move and to see him dispell half the garbage that gets printed about him. All you really need to know is right here...the talent, the discipline,the creativity, the joy. Unfortunately, the Jacksons chose to add their back-up vocals to the song at the end, which he had recorded in 1991.  I doubt seriously he EVER wanted to record anything with them again and would be livid by this. However, that's a minute criticism of this great snapshot into what would have been THE shows of the decade.",1256860800,,624,4.426086956521739

Watching this movie brought tears to my eyes, made me smile, made me dance, made me sing, he rocked it all over again! MJ looked happy, healthy and exuberant. The scenery and dance moves were fantastic .Inspiring creative genius throughout the entire film. Sometimes you forget Michael is dead, because he's so alive in ""This Is It."" Other times, you're struck with a profound sadness when you remember that what is on screen really is the last piece of history from an artist who truly cared about his craft and excelled at executing it. And that we'll never see him again

Michael was astute, polite, compassionate ,a great leader and teacher  both as a performer and as a human being. The world lost a genius and great humanitarian. I am saddened by this great loss. I felt like I was at a concert and He was just rehearsing. Everybody at the theater were dancing and clapping after each song.  What a great concert this would have been? I did not want the movie to end. The energy of the concert stuck with me well after watching it .  I loved every minute and I am going to see it several more times. I cannot wait for the DVD.

""This Is It"" was simply tremendous. Although i have always been obsessed with Michael and I have always had a deep love for him and his music, many people have discriminated against him and haven't even bothered to look into who he was and what he stood for. If you see ""This Is It,"" you will leave without a doubt in your mind, that Michael Jackson was simply a pure, innocent, loving, kind, amazing, and so so generous man.

I wish the movie would have been longer and that they would have shown us the costumes.  They are on display in London.  I hope they eventually come to L.A. or at least show them in this DVD that is supposed to have extra footage.  I can't wait until it comes out.  It makes me sad that he died and the fans won't get to see the final show.  It would definitely be a fantastic sight to see.  It just goes to show the world that no one can even come close to comparing to MJ's talent and performance ability.  He's a true genius. I cried at the end because I miss him so very much.  MJ will live on in all the minds of his loving fans.

The only difference was that he had greater and extravagant stage presentations.  My personal favorites were ""Thriller"" and Smooth Criminal"" both were 3D. A must see for MJ fans and an opportunity for none fans to discover his legacy. He looked good and physically fit.  There is no doubt in my mind, knowing how much of a perfectionist the man was, that he would've been able to do all 50 concerts in London.

I never expected anything close to what he actualy had lined up!  This would have truely been one of the most memorable concerts/tours in music history.  The sets, songs, theatrics, dancing and Michael himself all compiled into 2 hours of pure music heaven!

As for the actual movie, it really isn't nearly as ""grainy"" or ""gritty"" as I have read in other reviews and I was actually quite pleased with both the sound and the picture quality.  As everyone probably knows by now, the auduence gets a behind the scenes look at Michael rehearsals for his then upcoming shows in London.  It feels much more like you are actually watching him in concert though, except for his pausing to give instruction in his gentle Michael-like way.  You would never guess he is close to 50, as he can still dance like he did 25 years ago and does not seem to have lost much on his voice either.

This was not a documentary, it was clips from the rehearsals for what promised to be the best MJ concert yet.  From the film clips presented it was on track to fulfill the promise.  Sadly, it was not to be.  I, as were my fellow moviegoers, was in the cross hairs of jubilation and sadness. We seemed to not know whether we wanted to treat the experience as a concert (which in many ways it was) and sing along or a memorial.  In that torn state I decided to just enjoy the moment.  And I look forward to enjoying it once again when I have my personal copy of the last rehearsal clips.

My husband viewed the movie in the Middle East where he said the packed theater audience erupted in spontaneous applause throughout the movie.  Michael Jackson was well loved.

This presentation gives a glimpse of the person that was Michael Jackson. Talented, compassionate, kind, gentle, caring, professional, human.  He is sorely missed.  I am grateful for the memories.

 I've seen it 5 times already in theather and twice in IMAX. YOU HAVE TO DO IMAX it feels like you are sucked in to the screen!!

 Every time, I noticed what a beautiful person he was and his cute comments and sexy expressions... the Man still had sex appeal... SEXY! SIZZLING ;)

It was enthralling from beginning to end - Michael's presence on stage and screen is so strong that you can't take your eyes off of him.  The movie is a great representation of what the concerts would have been like...and they would have blown everybody away.  You can't help singing and moving along to all the numbers, and the visuals are beautiful.  The other important part of the film is the candid look at Michael himself as he interacts with others, such as his fans have rarely seen.  He's dedicated, focused; an integral part of the process.  He's playful and fearless, and wants to get everything just right.  This Is It is a must-see/must-have for any fan...and anyone who wants to be inspired.

The only downside was what seemed to be an ""out of focus"" camera.  At the beginning of the film, there are several shots that appear ""blurry"" when compared to the rest.  This may be more noticable in IMAX than regular theaters because of the screen and other detail (or it might be due to some problem at the theater I was at).  It disappears after a little while.  This may be apparent in the Blu-ray or possibly even the DVD if it was part of the film and not because of an error.",1256860800,3,1244,4.384279475982533
3971127,5,B002R0EIVI,"I saw the movie last night and as usual, Michael Jackson took my breath away.  He sang and danced as good as ever like he was in his 20s...it is just unbelievable that he was 50 years old.  I laughed and cried throughout the movie and did not want it to end.  He is simply the GREATEST.  I just can't believe that he is gone...I don't know if I will ever get over his death.  It is just heartbreaking to realize that he is not here with us anymore.  I just can't wrap that around my head.  As Berry Gordy said, Michael Jackson ""was not an artist who comes along once in a decade, a generation, or a lifetime.  He was an artist who comes along only once, period.""  I truly believe that too.  We will never see another like him.  Michael, I love you and will love you as long as I live.  Our One and Only King.  I am going to preorder the DVD today.",1256860800,2,847,4.0
3971128,5,B002R0EIVI,"I saw this movie last night and it was fantastic!
MJ was in top form, sharp of mind, his voice was great
and that London 02 Arena would've gotten one hell of a show
(50 shows to be exact!) if fate had not stepped in and claimed his life.
As a fan who has loved his music & talent for 40 yrs now,
this to me was a great way for his fans to remember him!
Doing what he loved to do, what he dedicated his life to,
ultimately, what he was born to do in his eventful, unprecedented
& tumultous 50 yrs of life!
MJ changed the whole music game, bridged the gaps between racial lines
and geographic boundaries and was the first true global megastar!
He drew on the wisdom of the musical artists and expert dancers who had
went before him and designed it into a package that rocked the world!
They (the nay-sayers) can say what they want to say about him,
but MJ was THE TRUTH!!--Plain & Simple.
I like the interaction between he, the dancers and the band, who were all in
awe of MJ's gifts, how sharp he was, his professionalism, his humour, and his humanity.
He was not the ego-driven diva kind of entertainer that we see today who
doesn't even have a third of his talent, but so much attitude!
He was just cool, laid back, positive, humble and secure in his
skill, knowledge & talent.
It was a WE experience instead of an I experience with him!
I can't wait to own this DVD to add to my other MJ memorabilia!
There will never be another Michael Jackson, EVER!!---RIP MJ!!",1256860800,5,1465,4.235714285714286
3971129,5,B002R0EIVI,"This Is It shows Michael was in great shape and knew what he wanted for this show- a show that was going to be unlike anything before it. With the rehearsals being this good it is clear just how amazing these concerts were going to be. Not only was his singing and dancing the way we all know and were ready to see but the extras he put into the show are also pure Michael- scientists working on developing things for him to wear, 3D Thriller and everything else- we missed out on what could have been the greatest comeback of all time but at least we have this to give us an idea of what could have been.",1256860800,2,605,4.092436974789916

3971132,5,B002R0EIVI,"It was great to see the movie, yes, he was in control, always has been during all his rehearsals. But he was definitely not 100%, I have seen footages of previous concerts during his rehearsals and he never held back. Here, he was clearly pacing himself.
How many times did he say "" I am saving my throat"", he could not really hit the high notes, and when he did the Billie Jean dance, he could not replicate what he used to do, no moonwalk and just said "" at least you get a feel of it"".
We will never know if he was holding back to save his strength or because he knew he could not do it, as we were used to see him. I have a hard time to believe that after 120 hours of footage, the editors could not find a sequence where he was 100%. Nonetheless, he was in control and he is one of the very few who knew his music so well, each tempos, each keys...
I have seen him in concert live, twice, and to this day none can come close to the way he owned the stage, with such presence.
I will miss seeing him move and sing. ""This is it"" is a great DVD to own by all means...",1256860800,,1069,3.8858447488584473
3971133,5,B002R0EIVI,"I went to see this the second day of it's release. I was torn about going to see it because part of me felt Michael is being exploited but if I had been able to see his concert I would have so to me it was my own way of paying homage to a creative genius. It goes without saying I will purchase this DVD. It was really amazing to hear Michael sing live, and I hope at some point the soundtrack to the movie is made into a CD. To hear Michael singing live just added a totally different depth to him as an artist. I found myself finally coming to terms with his death while watching the movie and I realized we will never get to hear any new material from this man. That's what makes it bittersweet to me. Bitter because he is no more, and sweet because watching him preparing to grace the world with his performance was so mesmerizing. I always felt Michael was a sensitive human being, but after seeing and hearing him practicing, I can only imagine how wonderful it would have been if he had been able to complete this work. I know there will be tons of things released about and by Michael, and if you have been a true fan, you have all the great material anyway. At this point you will only be replacing things. Get this DVD though because this really is it...and just think..you had a rare opportunity to go behind the scenes to see a genius at work.

i saw this 3 times - the 1st was by myself at midnight on tues, then i took my oldest 3 kids to see it this morning (thursday) and my husband and i went tonight together. really the cutest part for me was when i took my 3 kids and my 5 yr old talked during a transition when it was all quiet in the theater - it was the part at the end of smooth criminal when mj jumps through the window and the glass breaks - she goes, ""is michael jackson okay??""

this truly would have been such a cool comeback! it wowed me and was a mix of emotions, too - i was really happy because i love his music and watching him dance, but at the same time i was sad because he never got to present what he was working on to the world. i think he was a really strong person to put together something like this after everything he went through at the hands of hurtful people. i could tell he was really enjoying every second of what he was doing - as i did watching it. what a ""thriller"" he was!",1256774400,3,1421,3.947735191637631
3971139,5,B002R0EIVI,"The movie captures the magic that Michael brought to his work from the very beginning.  I remember being mesmerized the firt time he and his brothers were on the Ed Sullivan Show way back when, and then in the 80's when I got to see him live I was impressed with the way he brought a huge stadium audience to its feet.  And so one of the great joys of this movie was seeing that for all that has happened to him in the intervening years, he had not lost his magic nor his desire to share his gifts and love with the world through music, dance, and pure spectacle.  As other reviewers have said, he was still clearly the star and a consummate professional in these rehearsals even when holding back (I was struck by how when he missed a line in the medley of early hits he could pick up right on cue).  The movie features some incredible performances, and I think it is so fitting that all of his fans get to see what he was planning--not just those who had tickets to the concerts in London.  And I would totally agree that the movie should be seen on the big screen first, if possible; Michael meant the show to be larger than life and it's the best way to see his last gift to his fans.  I'll defintiely see it again, though I am pre-ordering the DVD so I get it as soon as it comes out!",1256774400,2,1289,4.115537848605578

3971143,5,B002R0EIVI,"Michael Jackson's This Is It(commonly known as This Is It) is a 2009 American documentary?concert film directed by Kenny Ortega that documents Michael Jackson's rehearsals and preparation for the concert series of the same name scheduled to start on July 13, 2009, but canceled due to his death eighteen days prior on June 25. The film is now the highest grossing concert movie and documentary in the history of cinema.[6]The film consists of Jackson rehearsing musical numbers and directing his team, and additional behind the scenes footage including dancer auditions and costume design. The film's director Kenny Ortega confirmed that none of this footage was originally intended for release, but after Jackson's death it was agreed that the film be made for his fans. Ortega dedicated the film to Jackson's three children. The footage was filmed at both the Staples Center arena and The Forum in Los Angeles, California. Despite originally being set for October 30, the film's release date was rescheduled for October 28, 2009 due to a strong demand by Jackson's fans. The film was given a wide worldwide release and a limited two-week theatrical run from October 28, to November 12, 2009. Tickets went on sale a month early on September 27, 2009, to satisfy a high anticipated demand; to date, the film has broken numerous records via tickets both pre-sale and sales worldwide. Since the film's confirmation, AEG Live has faced criticism; mostly consisting of claims that they had only made the film to make a profit. Multiple members of Jackson's family had confirmed that they didn't support the film and some family members went as far as to try to stop the film agreement in August. The film has also been surrounded by multiple controversies, including allegations regarding the appearance of body doubles in place of Jackson; which Sony denied, and an outrage from Jackson fans; with some going as far as to start a protest against the film. On August 10, 2009, a judge approved a deal between Jackson's estate, concert promoter AEG Live concert promoter AEG Live, and Sony Pictures. The agreement allowed Sony to edit the hundreds of hours of rehearsal footage needed to create the film. Sony subsequently paid $60 million for the film rights.[7]The trailer premiered during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards on September 13, 2009, along with the simultaneous launching of the film's official website.[8]The film was released to mainly positive reviews from both critics and Jackson fans; the film's portrayal of Jackson and his performances were generally praised, while criticism mainly consisted of both critics and fans having felt that the film was made just to profit off Jackson's death and that Jackson wouldn't have wanted the film released because he was a ""perfectionist"". In the film's opening weekend it grossed over $23 million - in the United States alone - making the film number one at the box office[5]and making it the fifth highest-grossing Halloween debut.[6]The film's worldwide revenue gross was in total $259.3 million during its theatrical run making it the highest grossing documentary or concert movie of all time. The film begins with a short text introduction stating the purpose of the footage and its intent ""For the fans..."". After short dialogues from various dancers, Kenny Ortega is heard talking through the original concert opening sequence involving a body suit made from screens which display fast clips and images with bright intensity from which Jackson emerges on stage. Immediately after this, Jackson begins ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'"" first solo, which pauses half-way through and a small snippet of Jackson singing his song ""Speechless"" acapella is shown. Jackson is then joined by dancers and completes the first number. A short clip showing rehearsals of the ""toaster"" mechanism is shown before rehearsal footage of ""Jam"" is played. This plays directly into the green screen adaption of soldiers dancers for ""Bad"" which are also used for ""They Don't Care About Us"" which is shown next. From here, the film shows Michael directing Ortega and his band for his solo rehearsal performance of ""Human Nature"" which he performs acapella, then acoustic and finally with full band. Green screen rehearsals for the video vignette for ""Smooth Criminal"" come next (with scenes from the film Gildalike the one where Rita Hayworth sings ""Put the Blame on Mame""), with dress rehearsals of the song following, including parts of the vignette intertwined with the dancing. Jackson is seen next directing his musical team for the cues in his song ""The Way You Make Me Feel."" Jackson then performs a rehearsal with dancers which he alters and changes as he goes. A small animatic introducing the Jackson 5 is shown afterwards, and Michael then rehearses Jackson 5 songs: ""I Want You Back"", ""The Love You Save"", ""I'll Be There"" and ""Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)."" Before he concludes ""I'll Be There"", Jackson tells his brothers and his parents that he loves them. Jackson stops only to report problems with his earpiece. After this, Jackson sings with Judith Hill, one of his back up singers, on his duet song ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"" in which he sings at full strength, directing his partner as he goes. The filming for the ""Thriller"" vignette is then shown with Jackson and Ortega watching with 3D glasses. Jackson is then seen rehearsing ""Thriller"" with the vignette intertwined like that in ""Smooth Criminal."" Footage of the show's aerialists rehearsing to the instrumental of ""Who Is It"" is shown next. During the dance sequence, puppets are suspended in the audience aisles while Jackson emerges from a robotic spider originally seen in the vignette. Jackson and Ortega rehearsing the cherry-picker is seen next, along with Jackson rehearsing ""Beat It."" Jackson creates the ending he wants for the song, a long drum build up in which he tears off his jacket and burns it. Footage of Jackson and the band rehearsing ""Black Or White"" is shown next, in which he instructs his band to skip the second verse and later allows guitarist Orianthi Panagaris to take center stage to finish with a high guitar rift. The video-sequence for ""Earth Song"" is shown next, featuring a little girl who wanders through an abundant forest, falls asleep, and wakes up to find the forest destroyed by man. Jackson then performs the song both onstage and using the cherry-picker, with his voice being heard at the end telling of the dangers of Global Warming and the lack of reversible time left. Afterwards, Michael is seen conversing with Ortega, his dancers and band about the shows, trivial dance moves and his hopes for the concert series. He then performs a quick version of his song ""Billie Jean"" featuring an extra dance sequence. Michael is then seen talking to all crew members and wishing everyone the best for the London performances. At a sound check, Jackson performs ""Man In The Mirror"" with strong backing vocals. The movie concludes with Jackson's arms extended on stage and the message: ""Michael Jackson King of Pop, Love Lives Forever"". The credits are shown next, with a montage of rehearsal clips and ""This Is It"" being played in the background. After the show, a live recording of ""Heal The World"" was played. Then, the audio of ""Human Nature"" was played, with an exclusive clip of Michael rehearsing it on his last day. Then, a clip of what could have been a Dome Project video of ""Heal The World"" was shown, in which the girl that appeared in the ""Earth Song"" video was shown holding the world and a signed message, by Michael, saying ""I Love You"" followed by his own signature. Then, a message appeared, saying ""This film is dedicated to Michael's three children; Prince Michael Jackson, Jr., Paris Michael Katherine Jackson,& Prince Michael Jackson II (""Blanket"").""

To those who say Mike was drugged, skinny, sickly, get a life. Michael was making me tired just watching him. The only ones having trouble breathing and keeping up with him were the kids he was dancing with.
I remember one time in particular when they were doing a dance sequence, and when they were done, they all froze. Michael wasn't even breathing hard, but this kid next to him (in the green shirt) you all know who he is  for those who've seen the movie. Well, that kid was huffing and puffing like he just ran a hundred mile marathon. No, there was nothing wrong with Michael!
Watching the movie was very emotional for all those in the theater. Unlike some of the people who mentioned how they were clapping and whistling and such, our theater was quiet. And when the lights came up and everyone was leaving, there was not a dry eye in the house.

3971153,5,B002R0EIVI,"I saw This is it last night and I am simply speechless!  The music was awesome, the dancers INCREDIBLE, the female guitarist ROCKED!  It is bittersweet, because it left me wanting more and wanting to see the actual concert and we never will.  However, I did get to see Michael as a person - his sense of humor, his creativity, his KINDNESS! - it's all love!  I was moved to tears watching his dancers mesmerized as they watched him perform solo on stage - their applause and excitement was NOT gratuidous (sp?) I am just so moved, that I cannot even think of all the things to say in this review.
One thing I would like to say to others who have seen it and were disappointed and to people who have not seen it yet - this is NOT a concert film, it is a documentary pieced together from photographers filming his rehearsals and at time it is gritty, but I found it only added to the feeling of the film - it was like BEING there.  Try to keep that in mind and you will enjoy it.

3971155,5,B002R0EIVI,"""This Is It"" is likely one of the best concert films ever produced, and that's saying something considering that the actual concerts never happened, and the limited time available to shape the ample rehearsal footage into a polished final product.

While the film includes interviews with those associated with Michael Jackson's planned London concerts, many snippets of creative discussions, and other ""behind the scenes"" activities, director Kenny Ortega wisely focuses on performance in the film.  Serving that end, ""This Is It"" is chockful of energetic, heartfelt songs, meticulously-produced dance numbers, and other incredible elements that would have been included in the concerts, including some wonderful filmed sequences (one ""co-starring"" Humphrey Bogart and Rita Hayworth).

And when Ortega chooses to include footage of performances that are interrupted (usually by perfectionist Jackson) with creative banter on how this or that song should be tweaked, or how a musician should lengthen or highlight a chord or bar of music, it's all extremely fascinating.  We see from Michael Jackson's interaction with his musicians and producers that, despite his time away from the limelight, he was still sharp, engaged, and still very much touched by genius in the area of music and performance.  Oh, and he also repeatedly came off as a gentle, nice person.  And a generous one: a particularly touching scene shows Jackson urging his female back-up guitarist to step up and not be afraid to make the most of a solo moment (""this is your moment to shine!"").

It's also uplifting (and even a little funny) to see Jackson not being able to resist giving full-fledged, amazing rehearsal performances despite the many times he says, ""Now I'm going to hold back a little and save my voice for the shows"".  After one such performance (Jackson singing a wonderfully re-imagined ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"" with an enthusiastic but pretty outclassed duet partner), Jackson apologizes to the crew for again getting lost in the moment and not holding back. To which Ortega essentially tells him to not worry about it because, after all, how can Michael Jackson not help but be Michael Jackson?

""This Is It"" will be a wonderful DVD to own (I'm sure the extra features will be amazing), but I'm glad that I made the trip to see the movie on the big screen.  If you can, see it that way first to get all the more impact from this entertaining, illuminating, and bittersweet farewell to Michael Jackson, both the musical icon and, more importantly, the man.",1256774400,151,2551,5.08133971291866

This film made me feel happy after seeing it, not sad or even bittersweet - just happy.",1256774400,3,393,4.7101449275362315
3971158,3,B002R0EIVI,"This movie was definitely more hype than substance. The concert would've been awesome. The rehearsal was not.

While it's always interesting to watch Michael's rehearsals, we are watching this as a substitute for the real thing and it's terribly unsatisfying. The producers had touted this as a documentary but it isn't really. If this was a documentary, it lacked a narrative, point, or direction - essentially, what makes a documentary a documentary. It was just a mishmash of scenes slapped together. There was no flow between one scene to the next either and it all comes off as terribly disjointed. What might be called the 'documentary' part consists of a few instructions from Michael to the musicians and dancers, but apart from that, it was mostly about Michael performing on stage. And because this was a rehearsal, he wasn't performing full out. (Even so, his voice was pretty darn good.) But clearly this wasn't meant to be a concert film either, so it's neither here nor there.

I can't imagine that Michael would have been happy with the release of this film. If you're a fan, you would know that Michael would NEVER let anyone see him at anything less than perfect. Not excellent - perfect. And certainly half-measures need not apply.

This is just another act of blatant exploitation by AEG and Sony to make money off Michael. AEG had already recovered their costs more than twice over from the sale of the footage for $60m, and then they get the first $135m from the film (why?) before Michael's estate would even see a penny. If that's not obscene, I don't know what is.

If this movie had been made as a proper documentary (a fleshier, step-by-step 'making of' film), it might've been more acceptable, but this was presented as a pseudo-concert. I'm sure they did the best with what they had, but this did not do justice to Michael nor his fans. One song, the most beautiful song - Speechless - was incomplete (what a travesty!), and many songs from the original setlist were not included (Rock With You, Dangerous, Dirty Diana, Heal the World, We Are The World, and many more). The concert was supposed to be 2.5 hours - you do the math. Some fans from This Is NOT It (who watched the actual rehearsals) said that Michael was weak and flubbing his lines. I wonder if that was the reason those songs were edited out.

The movie tried to show what might have been, and yes, we're sad because we'll never get to see the real thing, but more than showing Mike's genius, this film revealed how unprepared AEG really was. Two weeks before the concert, major set pieces were still missing (they had to be created in CGI on the film), none of the dancers had their costumes and the backup singer and guitarist still didn't know their places on stage or how to move or when to play. Michael already knew all his songs and dance routines (I'm sure he could do them in his sleep) but the others didn't, and he had to instruct them step-by-step because these were not the singers and bandmates of old. It was a whole new cast and they had to learn how to perform with Michael. Many times, Michael had to slow down and wait for them to learn up, or notice that something was wrong but just bite his tongue. I'm not saying that those people are incompetent, I'm saying that they were all so hopelessly behind schedule! Michael had not even seen his costumes yet, much less rehearsed in them.

This is all we'll see of what would never be, but I wonder if it would never have been anyway because the whole production was still so un-ready, a mere two weeks before opening night. Michael would not have wanted anything less than perfect. Is that why he looked so stressed, tired and unhappy and had lost so much weight towards the end (in Human Nature)?

I don't want to sound ungrateful because this is a last look at the biggest genius of our time, and yet, after seeing this, I wish I hadn't because I would rather remember Michael in happier times, and Michael would not have wanted people to remember him giving anything less than 110%.

To think that people are making boatloads of money hawking something that Michael would never have approved of is rather unpalatable. If you don't care about all that, the movie itself is actually just rather mediocre. I might buy the live album if they made one, but the movie, no.",1256774400,21,4329,4.583979328165374
3971159,5,B002R0EIVI,"My boyfriend and I saw this in IMAX at Midnight Oct 27th. Being a huge fan of Michael since 1983, made me so happy to experience this moment. My boyfriend didn't really like Michael til he saw the movie. And loved it too and thought it was one of the best movies he ever seen. He's now a fan too.

The crowd clapped and screamed Michael's name at the end of every performance. There was also some clapping and whistling during some performaces. Michael's performance was just as excellent as the 80's, maybe better at some times. It so was wonderful to watch this. Throughout the movie, he tells how to do stuff and the beats of the keyboards and sounds. He tells/shows how wants the special affects and more. Thriller is the best performance I ever seen him do for this song. The whole thing is awesome with creepy zombies special affects. Earth Song was also the best ever, but sad at points. The whole movie was just excellent from beginning to end. I felt like I watching a him perform onstage and not on the screen. It felt so real, like he was right there in front of us. This is an experience I will never forget and always remember. It's sad, that None of us will ever see him perform onstage again. But watching this movie, makes me feel like I just walked away from watching him perfoprm in concert. If I could rate this above a 10, I would rate it way, way up. It deserves more than a 10. I definately recommend watching *This Is It*

Sadly after seeing the *This Is It*. It makes me a little depressed and sad. Cause of watching him for many, many years. Sadly he's gone. Watching *This Is It* made me so happy, like he was really there. Like I said in another post. It felt so real. In reality, he's gone forever. But his legacy, memories and music will always live on forever in my heart.",1256774400,2,1802,4.312684365781711

The band and dancers are better even than usual.  Second best to Michael performing is seeing his creative process and how he works with other people.

3971172,5,B002R0EIVI,"Wow, what a movie! Having seen MJ perform twice live during the Dangerous and History World Tours, it's a real pity we didn't get to see his creative genius culminate in This is It!

The movie provides glimpses of what was to be and it would have been a multimedia spectacular! Only someone like MJ could have had the vision of combining song and dance with film, on stage, with aerialists, fireworks and 3D effects.

The movie takes us through the songs that MJ was to perform. We see how he works with the musicians, director and choreographer. We see him laugh, goof up (e.g. forgetting the lyrics), chide, encourage, and most importantly, as he puts it ""sizzle"" and ""simmer"".

There are moments in the movie you feel his joy as he performs songs from the Jackson 5 era. He breaks into a smile at the end of ""They Don't Really Care About Us"". He ""misses his cue"" as the set for ""Smooth Criminal"" begins, but firmly tells the Director that no he didn't miss his cue, he's just ""sizzling"" i.e. taking in the audience's adulation. You see the perfectionist at work, but you also see his playful innocence as he enjoys his ride on the cherry picker that was supposed to take him over the crowd.

Of course there were his trademark dance moves and his undeniable talent for singing. He doesn't go all out in every song, but when he does you realize he still had the performer in him.

The movie is bittersweet. You feel his joy as he steps through his rehearsals, but at the end you're left thinking what could have been. I can't wait for the DVD to be released. Until then, fans and non-fans will just have to go to the movie theaters and watch glimpses of the concert that never came to fruition.",1256688000,4,1696,4.440514469453376

3971174,5,B002R0EIVI,"When Michael Jackson died on June 25th 2009 it seems a part of the world died with him. It made many people sad all over the world and it seems that for once everyone was being nice to this man who had always been abused by the Medias; journalists, interviewers and others. When I heard of the ""This Is It"" movie concert I didn't know what to think. I knew it was rehearsal footage from the 50 concerts he was to perform at the O2 arena but I didn't know what was going to come out of it or what they were going to do with it. When I saw the trailers I knew I had to see this and that ""This Is It"" was going to be something special like I've never seen. And that's precisely what I got, I even bought my ticket in advance for the movie and feel like it was much worth it.

It amazed me how good MJ still was, the dance moves were great and fascinating to me. He was clearly the one in charge of the whole thing. He gave precise instructions of what he wanted, made sure everything was right and did everything that needed to be done. The film shows just how much Michael was respected, there were parts of it where they asked him if he wanted anything or what he thought and if he liked something, it seems no one assumed anything at all. When he talked the crew would listen and he asked things in the nicest way, never to hurt anyone. There's not a part that doesn't make him look like the nice guy he always was. There are mixed feelings about him after all the bad things that have been said about him but after watching this I don't know one could possibly believe them.

To be honest I loved every minute of it, every song was special and was great to watch. Right from the beginning of ""Wanna Be Startin'Somethin'"" it was amazing. No matter how many people surround him he's always the one who does things better than anyone else and the one you're watching. This Is It was really a unique experience, I felt they chose the right footage parts for the movie and made him look great in every sense. They could truly have messed things up but they didn't and came out with an amazing documentary, it's sort of a testament to his fans, it's just very special. I really liked the Thriller 3D part, it was a 3D video shoot and afterwards you see MJ coming out onstage from a spider, the show would have looked awesome. They Don't Care About Us was amazing, The Smooth Criminal part was very interesting, so was the Earth Song which had a beautiful video of a little girl in a forest, waking up to see that all of it has been destroyed. I won't go further but every song had something about them.

The stage show would have been grandiose, the fireworks, the ""fireball"" (quite impressive I won't spoil anything), pyrotechnics, the videos that accompany the songs are all very impressive. This could very well have been the best show ever had he lived to perform them. In the end I was quite amazed by the 1: 48 minutes I watched, I can't wait to see it again and the message Michael gives at the end is very inspiring. From the auditions of the brilliant performers to the credits with the ""This Is It"" song I was captivated.

The said special features will feature more of the rehearsal and a two part documentary on Michael's history and his comeback along behind the scenes. I can't wait to see more of the rehearsal and hopefully the extras will be great and there will plenty to watch.

It's hard for me to describe what watching this movie was like and what I felt about it. I know this is rehearsal footage but it's truly brilliant and while it main not catch Michael at his best it certainly catches him at his most honest. I don't have anything bad to say about either this movie or the man himself, This Is It is a must see. It doesn't matter if you watch in its theatrical run or on DVD/Blue Ray when released, this is amazing and his fans just have to see this. I will certainly be amongst those who buy it and watch it over and over again. This man gave his life to music and his fans and I don't remember where I heard or read this but I do remember that someone said: ""He was a gift of god, he was a kind human being who's been mistreated by many opportunists, he's been taken advantage of but he was the nicest person and could never harm anyone"" or sometime like that.

Michaels live vocals are incredible. And watching him dance was like watching him 20 years ago, no kidding! It was a bit eerie. I kept wondering how could this man be 50 years old! He also surprised everyone with some mind boggling new moves. Obviously, this is just rehearsal footage. I can't imagine what a treat the live shows would have been. Unlike anything I have seen or even heard of on a music tour. With Michael Jackson, everything was big and This Is It would have been huge.

 It was fascinating to see the  process of putting the show together and the tremendous amount of work that went into it. Michaels live shows are so well rehearsed that we don't get to see a whole lot of the real Michael. It was refreshing to see him singing with no extras, just him, the band, the back up singers, sometimes with a minimum of accompaniment. And for the skeptics; there was no doubt that Michael was running the show, as always. This is the best concert/music documentary that I have ever seen and was an incredible piece of film making. Kenny Ortega and crew deserve a lot of credit for making such a stunning movie from the available footage.

3971189,5,B002R0EIVI,"Props to Kenny Ortega and the editing team for a really well constructed movie, made in a fraction of the time a feature normally takes to produce.  Nothing about this movie seemed ""thrown together"" or rushed.  It's a neat homage, concert film and documentary rolled into one.  An unintentional work of art, as the footage was never meant to see daylight.  Much better than I expected, and very moving in spots.  (Those who stay through the end of the credits will be rewarded with additional small treats.)

No question in my mind, this would have been the live show to end all shows.  It's almost difficult to comprehend so many mind-blowing production numbers in one two-hour concert.  MJ said in an interview that his intention was for fans to leave the shows unable to sleep all night, needing to stay up 'til dawn to talk about the experience with their friends, and I believe he would have achieved that.  He had many fresh ideas for what are now considered his classic works.  ""Smooth Criminal"" has never been a favorite of mine, but I liked it here a great deal.  After seeing this movie, I believe that Michael would have not only made it through all fifty shows at the O2, but would have been absolutely smashing, wowed his kids and his fans, and achieved the comeback and respect he so strongly desired.  As one reviewer noted, Michael Jackson wasn't about to just phone this one in for a payday, despite what some detractors have suggested.  In the collected footage we're privy to here, Michael looked to be in astonishingly good form as a singer and dancer considering he hadn't toured in over a decade.  If he was ""frail"" or otherwise compromised, there is no evidence of that here. Work obviously brought out the best in the man.

I would have liked a touch more of MJ speaking/instructing/interacting; it could have been a little longer of a film to accomplish that.  No one would have been fidgeting in their seats if the movie was 2:15 instead of 1:48.  To me, those were some of the best moments, a rare treat to see a master craftsman in unself-conscious work mode, oblivious to the cameras.  So one hopes that there will be lots of special features on a blu-ray edition (the whole videos, maybe?  More interviews with the dancers/crew/band?  More outtakes of MJ just being himself?) But a terrific film, a must-see for any Jackson fan, not only the die-hards. When this comes out in Blu-Ray, it will be in my library.",1256688000,24,2440,4.643356643356643

3971205,5,B002R0EIVI,This movie was awesome !! It was so sad though to see Michael in his last days and you could tell that at times he was dragging (and maybe even drugged). It was nice to see all of the back stage footage instead of just a concert. It showed Michael the man. He is a perfectionist and was involved in all aspects of his concert. The movie shows the kind and gentle soul that was MJ. It is too bad that people shunned him for the last 10 years of his life and vilified him now love him after he is gone. Rest in peace MJ !!,1256688000,2,520,3.869158878504673

3971208,5,B002R0EIVI,"I was in the movie theater and watched with awe the entire premiere of this phenomenal movie just after midnight October 28.

THIS IS IT the Movie is extraordinary. Rarely am I so gripped by a movie that I did not want to blink! I was hoping the movie would be made available in DVD - buying this DVD is a MAJOR GIFT!

During each rehearsal Michael Jackson was passionately hands on regarding every facet of the concert experience he was creating. The energy Michael and ALL who were involved in these rehearsals created an experience that is almost indefinable in words - it transports you with awe INTO the soul behind the creation of the music.

The movie Director, producers, special effects, make-up, costume, musicians, the dancers who performed with Michael during these final rehearsals before his passing are all PHENOMENAL.
I feel we owe a HUGE debt of gratitude to the special people who filmed the rehearsals that made this movie. What a GIFT you have given humanity!

Michael Jackson will forever be a gift to humanity. When you see this movie you will understand why.

{An Update} Tonight, December 3, 2009, I saw the final showing of this amazing film for the 5th time. I was just as glued to the screen as I was the first time. I never cried before for what I could only describe as a poignant ending, but I did tonight. THIS IS IT is so much more about the care Michael Jackson had for humanity, and our planet.

He said, ""I've always loved trees, I get upset at the mismanagement of our planet, that every minute trees the size of a football field is cut down in the Amazon rain forest... It's up to us to fix this and we only have four years left before it's irreversible. People say the government will fix this, ""they"" will fix this, ""they"", they who? It's up to us. This is it...That's why I write these songs, to inspire people, to give them hope, I'm so glad I can give that to the world.""

When he spoke to all of the people involved in the rehearsals he said, ""This is an adventure, a great adventure. To take people places they've never been before, to show them talent that they've never seen before.""

This precious soul named Michael Jackson leaves us with an awareness to take responsibility for the changes we must make. I feel one of the best ways we can pay tribute to him is to start planting trees in his name in honor of each person who wants to keep his memory alive.

Each of the five times I was glued to the screen watching the movie THIS IS IT moved my heart in ways I've never experienced before. The loss is HUGE, but I know he's watching, so I'd like to say, Thank You Michael Jackson for giving us a lifetime of your heart that will remain in our hearts forever.",1256688000,241,2708,4.4
3971209,5,B002R0EIVI,"It was midnight Oct. 27, 2009 and i saw this movie. It is great and i would love to see it again and again, so i'll be one-of-the first to buy the dvd. What an entertainer he was and still is to me.  Dianna Lynn Elmore",1256688000,67,218,3.739130434782609
3971210,5,B002R0EIVI,"Rarely am I so gripped by a movie that I did not want to blink! With all sincerity, this is by far the BEST film in all respects. I just returned from the Premiere and I can't wait to go back to the theater tomorrow to experience the magic again.

As this movie is from the footage of rehearsals for his 50 concert performances in London, Michael Jackson was extraordinarily ""hands on"" regarding every facet of the concert ""experience"" he was creating.

What I paid special attention to was Michael's appearance as far as health is concerned. I can ASSURE you this Gift to Humanity named Michael Jackson was at PEAK performance. He looked radiant, happy, he had a huge amount of energy, he was clearly in love with the process of creating something to make this world a better place - and he said so during rehearsals.
With such super high energy that went into the rehearsals, I think just about anyone would have difficulty winding down to go to sleep. It is my pure opinion that Michael accidentally too more medicine to help him sleep, without realizing it was too much.

The energy Michael and ALL who were involved in these rehearsals exuded that ""It"" quality - the kind that is almost indefinable in words - that transports you with awe INTO the experience.

The movie Director, producers, special effects, make-up, costume, musicians, the dancers who performed with Michael during these final rehearsals before his passing are all PHENOMENAL.

I feel we owe a HUGE debt of gratitude to the special souls who actually took the footage during the rehearsals. What a GIFT you have given humanity.

THIS IS IT is an extraordinary legacy that will remain with me forever, and I believe it will with you as well!
