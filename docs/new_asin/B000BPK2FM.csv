8090600,3,B000BPK2FM,The House At The Edge Of the Park was extremely stupid and hard to sit through. The others were so-so. Think I'll give this DVD to a friend of mine for keeps.,1360195200,,158,3.96875
8090601,4,B000BPK2FM,"In today's economy it's nice to find a great deal.  These three films have a retail of 15 dollars seperately, so getting all three for 15 is an amazing deal.

To clarify, this box set is a simple repacking of the three seperate DVDs, the original cover art, features, and inserts remain the same.

Lets talk about the films.

Beyond the Darkness AKA Buried Alive is the stand out of the three.  It's a very grim film with exceptional SFX that'll have you wondering if an actual corpse was used in the film.  It's about a taxidermist who loses his girlfriend, he decides to keep her memory alive buy digging her up and keeping her around the house.

Next is House on the Edge of the Park.  A lot of people say this is Italy's answer to Last House on the Left...The only real similarities between the two films is David Hess and the titles.

The film is about a pair of psychopaths (David Hess and Italy's whipping boy John Morghen) who make their way to a party populated by yuppies and take them all hostage.  Hess is very good at his role, playing a very unlikable guy, but even with his stellar performance the film falls a bit short.  Not the best in the set, certainly not Deodato's best film, but still a nice little exploitation flick.

And last we have Delirium, this film in my opinion is the weakest of the set.  It's a Lamberto Bavo film (a director who's probably best know for the Argento Produced Demons) The movie is about a woman who's in charge of a popular men's magazine and an obsessed stalker who's slowly killing everyone connected to her.  The sadistic murderer then sends her pictures of her slain model co-workers.

Overall this is a must buy for anyone interested in the exploitation genre!",1246838400,7,1715,4.487096774193549
8090602,4,B000BPK2FM,"This review is for The House at the Edge of the Park,i haven't seen the other two. This movie has David Hess(Last House on the Left,HitchHike)playing a sadistic,rapist with his dimwitted buddy(i forget his name but he's in Cannibal Ferox and City of the Living Dead)inviting themselves to a party for some rich kids who like to party. They play cards and then have a fight. There's a lot of nudity,sex and violence. Some really disturbing torture is done with a razor(fun right?)I enjoyed this low budget Italian grindhouse and recommend to anyone who's into sleaze. Oh yeah i like the disco songs here,also the one written for the movie.",1217030400,,638,4.8090909090909095
8090603,5,B000BPK2FM,"Shriek Show/Media Blasters has been graciously discounting their films lately by releasing 3 similar themed films in 1 box set. Out of all their box sets Psycho Killers is one of best.

The first film is Delirium. Delirium is a giallo (an Italian murder mystery). Italy had their giallo hey-day back in the last 60's and early 70's so Delirium comes very late to the genre by being released in 1988. Though hardly a good film, it does entertain. The films plot has a fashion magazine editor who's photo girls keep turning up dead. The killer disposes of them in unique manners including one by by bee stings. What makes this film interesting is that the killer has weird delusions before each killing and he sees his victems deformed in some way (one even has an eye-ball for a head!). The film is wonderfully cheezy and sleazy with some gore. Compared to other films in the giallo genre, this is VERY weak but it is entertaining in a more trashy sense. What's amazing is that this film was directed by Lamberto Bava, son of the late Mario Bava, who was the creator of the giallo genre to begin with!

The second film is House on the Edge of the Park (or as humerously titled in the trailer House on the Park on the Edge). This sadistic film was directed by ___ (Cannibal Holocaust) and stars David Hess (Last House on the Left) so you know your in for a disturbing, violent movie. The film has two working class auto-body repair guys who force themselves into a party of some young wealthy upper class citizens. It becomes a night of torture and mayhem as David Hess goes crazy. D___ actually keeps the filmmaking at an almost pedestrian level heightening the realistic nature fo the film. Though the film is shot in a pedestrian manner it still has a very high quality look to it that the film Last House on the Left lacked. The performances are good (perhapes too good) and there is a nice twist at the end. Though it can be a hard film to watch (like Cannibal Holocaust), it still comes out being a very good film and by far the best in this box set.

The third film is Beyond the Darkness directed by Joe D'Amato (Anthropophagus). I am a Italian film nut and in my opinion Joe D'Amato is a hackeyed director. He specializes more in porn/adult film industry and his actual real feature films are always poorly made. I have nothing against the man I just think he's a poor director...but then again he never claimed to be a great one. Like I expected the film is quit poorly directed and edited. The plot is simple as it has a young man who's girlfriend dies and he then exumes the body and makes here into a stuffed doll. The gore effects are graphic and realistic but sadily the rest fo the film is nothing to get overly excited over. It can actually be a chore to watch during some moments. Goblin, however, provides the score so all cannot be that bad.

Overall this box set is well worth the money. YOu get a good, disturbing, realistic movie in House by the Cemetery; a cheezy, sleazy giallo with Dilirium, and a gory albeit poorly made film with Beyond the Darknes. They all add up to interesting film experiences.",1163289600,7,3124,4.456293706293707
8090604,4,B000BPK2FM,"As I have stated in my other reviews right now Media-Blasters is the best place for cult horror movies and this set shows they the best out there now.

First up we have House on the Edge of the Park directed by Ruggero Deodato and starring David Hess of Last House on the Left.

House on the Edge of the Park is deeply twisted, but some scenes don't have the impact they should. Maybe that is due to the twist I suppose, which I won't spoil.

Though the scene with David Hess as Alex and Brigitte Petronio as Cindy is quite sadistic. Overall not a perfect movie and in my opinion not as good as Last House on the Left, but still a well-made twisted film.

Cult Italian actor Giovanni Lombardo Radice also stars.

Beyond the Darkness was directed by Joe D'Amato and this might be his finest film. Beyond the Darkness isn't as gory as people make it out to be, but when there is gore there are a lot. I mean a lot. It's not constant though, but very gory.

There were rumors once of real corpes being used that is how real the disembowelment scenes looked.

Beyond the Darkness is actually kind of slow paced and maybe even a bit boring, but the movie is just so sick and twisted it will hold your interest.

The score by Goblin is excellent, but isn't that always the case?

Finally we have Delirium: Photo of Gioia directed by Lamberto Bava and in my opinion this flick is pretty much a waste, while it has now built up a cult following I just found it boring and just bad.

Only reason to watch is for Serena Grandi who is quite the hottie. Cult Italian actor George Eastman stars as well.

Overall you get 2 really good flicks with one poor one. If you wanted to buy House on the Edge of the Park and or Beyond the Darkness the set is the way to go. Buying any of those movies on their own would cost you more than buying the set.

Now that is a great deal. Delirium: Photo of Gioia is cheaper than the set so if that is the only movie you wanted no need for the set.

Great set with some solid extras.",1160092800,5,2004,4.160621761658031
