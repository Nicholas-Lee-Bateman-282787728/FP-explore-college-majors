419740,4,6302048990,"I strongly urge all to experience this movie. At a time when silents were just about over in favor of talking Pictures, Garbo remained silent and ever so popular. This was one of the highest grossing films of the year 1929.
It would be Garbo's last silent. The story is full of romance and intrigue and tainted love. Beautifully photographed, with sets and costumes to compliment. This movie introduced Lew Ayers, who would become a matinee idol and lead actor throughout the coming decade. But again the movie belongs to Greta Garbo. The moods, the emotions, the kissing, the forced laughs, gestures. Its Garbo. The actress, the enigma and the legend. Experience, The Kiss.",1276819200,5,674,4.921052631578948
419741,5,6302048990,"This isn't the best Garbo silent ever made, but it was the last, and it was also the final silent film made by MGM. It's only a little over an hour long, and supposedly was originally 90 minutes long. What makes this film good is the combination of Garbo's acting and the cinematography here. Movies like this and Sunrise make me somewhat sad that the silent film era ended, because what could be done creatively with the camera was lost from this point until the early 30's once the problems of the static camera got worked out and the novelty of sound at the expense of everything else wore off. Garbo convincingly plays the sympathetic yet no-longer-in-love wife when in the presence of her husband (Anders Randolf), the longing lover who wishes to defy convention and just leave her marriage behind regardless of the consequences when with Andr Dubail (Conrad Nagel), and the knowledgable ""older"" woman who is enjoying the attention she is getting when with the very young and naive Pierre Lassalle (Lew Ayres). Whenever she is alone she has no trouble conveying which of these three moods she is in. The story is a very good tale of tortured romance with a little bit of mystery thrown in towards the end, but the main attraction is the romance and the beautiful and creative shots. The only thing really annoying is the original Vitaphone score that went along with the movie. With all of the other subtle expression going on in this film, the choice of the theme song from ""Romeo and Juliet"" to convey the feelings between Garbo and Nagel every time they shared a scene just seemed a bit over the top.

There are still quite a few Garbo silents such as this that are very worthwhile and are not yet on DVD. TCM should do a volume two of their ""Garbo Silents"" and at least include this film, ""The Single Standard"", ""A Woman of Affairs"", and ""Love"". ""Love"" is a very good film and isn't even on VHS.",1190160000,7,1904,4.567251461988304
419742,5,6302048990,"This movie is the last silent film MGM made.  I do not think it is a ""mediocre"" Garbo vehicle in anyway.  The cinematography in this film for it's time is very well done, intriguing concepts of ""flashbacks"" during the story and how they are expressed with this early film technology make it very worthwhile.  A classic example of how something extremely innocent one minute can turn into a crime the next.  Garbo's acting is very fine.",1136851200,14,435,4.684210526315789
419743,3,6302048990,"Sorry, but I can't figure out any other way to correct a mistake on Lawrence M. Burnabo's otherwise excellent National Film Registry lists. The title may be the same, but ""The Kiss"" that's on the NFR is Edison's 1896 kinetoscope film, not this Garbo silent.",1007251200,3,257,4.733333333333333

7820369,5,6302048990,"The Kiss amazes me! Despite its rather short length (a mere 62 minutes) there is plenty of action including romance, a murder mystery, character development and the plot never feels rushed! The sets display wonderful art deco which is something MGM liked at the time; and of course as people pointed out before me this film has historical significance as the last silent film MGM ever made as well as being the last silent film Greta Garbo ever made. I also like the idea that Garbo's kiss with the young man represents a kiss goodbye to the era of silent film. The cinematography is incredible; for example I loved how Garbo's character Irene was filmed from an angle looking up at her during the courtroom trial scenes. The choreography was well done, too! The musical score enhances the film overall but I agree with those who say that the theme from Romeo and Juliet is used one or two times too many. However, the rest of the film is just so well done that even this becomes a minor quibble.

When the film starts, we meet Irene Guarry (Greta Garbo) and her lover Andr (Conrad Nagel) who are meeting secretly at a museum in Lyons, France. Irene is trapped in a loveless marriage to her husband Charles Guarry (Anders Randolf) and while Irene wants to run off with Andr, Andr thinks she should end her marriage first to Charles so that she will not be a tainted woman. Andr even wants to tell Charles to his face that his marriage to Irene is over; but Irene feels so hopeless that Charles will ever let her go she refuses to let Andr do that. Andr sees Irene one last time at a dinner party but realizing he has little chance for a future with Irene Andr travels to Paris for a new life there.

Meanwhile, another man loves Irene--a young man who is her messenger and dog handler, Pierre (Lew Ayers). Pierre has an intense case of puppy love but he believes it's true love; Irene thinks it's cute but she doesn't love Pierre. Yet when she gives Pierre a playful kiss goodbye before he goes off to school, Charles spies them kissing and thinks it's a meaningful kiss--and that's what starts a huge physical fight that ends with Charles dead on the floor from a gunshot wound.

There's more to the plot than what I've mentioned so far; and of course the fight sets up the murder mystery I mentioned above. Who killed Charles--Pierre or Irene--or was it suicide? Suffice it to say that the rest of the film shows how all the issues play out including what happens between Pierre and Irene. Look for some great moments in the court trail where Andr defends Irene because he still loves her.

Look also for solid performances by Holmes Herbert as Lassalle, Pierre's wealthy father who tries to help Charles financially shortly before Charles dies; George Davis as Durant and Symona Boniface has a brief cameo as a gossipy old lady in the museum.

The Kiss is an excellent film for fans of the silent film era especially with its importance as the last silent film MGM ever made. People who admire the actors in this film would do well to add this to their collections and anyone who loves classic film with themes of romance and drama will not be disappointed.",1366502400,,3160,4.527145359019264
7820370,2,6302048990,"""The Kiss"" (1929) is notable as the last silent film made by Greta Garbo as well as the last made by her studio, MGM.  With the success of Warner Brothers' ""The Jazz Singer"" in 1927, film studios slowly transitioned to sound, although they had existed in various forms as early as 1896.

In 1927, ""The Jazz Singer"" was the #1 box office attraction. The rest of the top 10 (e.g., ""Wings"", ""It"", ""King of Kings"") were all silent. The next year, the top 3 were talkies (""The Singing Fool"", ""Lights of New York"", ""Street Angel"") and in 1929, when this film was released, the entire top 10 were talkies. Though a few silent films would still be made (e.g., Dali's ""Un Chien Andalou"", Murnau's ""City Girl"", Chaplin's ""City Lights"" and ""Modern Times""), the silent era was effectively over.

FWIW - ""The Kiss"" was the only silent film in the top 20 for 1929. But it was not completely silent - it had a synchronized sound track and sound effects including a gun shot and a ringing phone.

Garbo (1905-90) had been in nearly 20 silent films, starting as early as 1920. Her best known silent films were ""Flesh and the Devil"" (1926) and ""Love"" (1927). She was nominated 3 times for an Oscar (""Anna Christie"", ""Camille"", and ""Ninotchka"") but never won. She is listed #5 on the AFI's list of Greatest Actresses.

Conrad Nagel (1897-1970) plays a young man in love with Garbo. Nagel made a successful transition to talkies as the star in dozens of B films in the 30s and 40s, including ""One Million BC"" (1940).

This is the film debut of a very young Lew Ayres (1908-96), billed fifth after Garbo, Nagel, Anders Randolf, and Holmes Herbert. His success in ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" (1930) propelled him to early stardom and he was nominated for an Oscar for ""Johnny Belinda"" (1948) and for an Emmy for a guest appearance on ""Kung Fu"" (1972). He's probably best known from his portrayal as Dr. Kildare in a series of 40s films.

Belgian born Jacques Feyder (1885-1948) directs. He was well known in the early French cinema and this was his first US project, and he shortly returned to Europe. His forte was making films that dealt with love.

William Daniels (1901-70) is the cinematographer. Garbo insisted he shoot all her films, which he did, except for 2 (""Conquest"", ""Two-faced Woman"") which turned out to be flops at the box office. When not working with Garbo, Daniels was a favorite of Erich von Stroheim, who was Garbo's favorite director (even though she made 6 films with Clarence Brown). Daniels lensed more than 150 films. He was nominated 3 times (""Anna Christie"", ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", ""How the West was Won"") and won once (""Naked City"" in 1948).

1929 was the first year that the Oscars appeared. ""Broadway Melody"" won Best Picture, Warner Baxter (""In Old Arizona"") and George Arlis (""Disraeli"") shared the Best Actor award, and Mary Pickford won for ""Coquette"". The most popular films were ""Gold Diggers of Broadway"", ""Sunny Side Up"", ""The Cock Eyed World"", ""Welcome Danger"", and ""The Desert Song"". Other notable films that year include the Marx Brothers in ""Coconuts"", Lionel Barrymore's ""Madame X"", the first of the Ronald Coleman ""Bulldog Drummond"" flicks, and Salvador Dali's ""An Andalusian Dog"".

The film suffers not only from being a silent film, but also from the silent film style of acting and the music, instead of adding to the film, detracts, often overpowering the action on screen and sometimes setting a different mood than the visuals. If you're a big fan of Garbo you will probably find her acting compelling, but non-fans will find it less than stellar. The only really big hit is Lew Ayres who lights up the screen.

Bottom line - for hard core Garbo fans only.",1333324800,,3693,4.710077519379845
7820371,5,6302048990,"When I watch this film, I just completely turn off the soundtrack -- which is nothing more than a potboiler of mediocre recordings of classical warhorses -- and soak in the incredible images.  The visual compositions! The use of light and dark! The incredible portraiture!  Garbo's amazing use of eyes and gestures -- yes, somewhat exaggerated but perfectly suitable for the silent medium and for the zeitgeist!  The plot is fine, but if you're like me, in a really great movie, the plot is more of an excuse for visual poetry.  So many silent films, though made so relatively quickly, were so much more visually thoughtful than the average stuff we see today....not to mention the current spate of movies, both popular and artsy, that look like they were photographed by a six-year-old!  I assume the reason for that old-time general (though not universal) high quality was that many of the directors were simply more steeped in art and artistic principles than most (though not all) of today's mob.  If, like me, you just enjoy looking at film as an art, this is a movie for you!",1308873600,10,1081,4.754010695187166
7820372,5,6302048990,"I have had this picture for years; My original reason for getting it was to see a young Lew Ayres (he was indeed dashing!) but I have treasured it all this time because of its vintage, Garbo, the story and of course, Mr. Ayres. I love the look, the sound and the story of it. In fact, I can't find anything wrong wtih it at all. Of course, this is my taste, but if you are a devotee of any of the performers, the era or silent films, this one must be in your collection. Thoroughly recommended!",1296518400,3,494,4.103092783505154
7820373,5,6302048990,"According to the Barry Paris bio of Garbo, a line from this film is the first occurance on film or in writing of a phrase that has become a universally recognized and unending cliche.  It is spoken by her co-star, Conrad Nagel, near the beginning of the movie, when Conrad and Garbo first meet, he says, ""Irene, we must stop meeting like this"".  It started here.

Certainly this movie stands out in her stellar career as one of the best, most entertaining.  Garbo had this magical way of making the most mundane and uninteresting material fascinating - she usually overcame the inadequacies of her script just by her extraordinary looks and cinematic appeal.  Apparently one encounters such a being quite rarely as there aren't any of her sort around today.  I recommend this and most other Garbo movies.  Enjoy!",1296432000,2,812,4.798561151079137
