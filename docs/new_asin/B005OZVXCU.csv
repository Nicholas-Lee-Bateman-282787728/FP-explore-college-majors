4855465,5,B005OZVXCU,"I saw this movie in theatre-- really appreciated it.  This would have been an outstanding movie if it had a bigger budget.  This is not a Christian movie per se--it is a golf movie that has a message about golf, life and God.  Being from near where it was filmed makes it all the more real.  Small town Texas is really like the movie-- it just doesn't happen all in one week.",1322092800,10,375,4.166666666666667
4855466,5,B005OZVXCU,"Best family movie to come along in a Long time.
The advice given in the movie is the best.
Saw this movie twice and cannot wait to buy it.
The critics gave it a bad rap because there was no wild violance, cursing, sex content, ect.

A little unbelievable, but if you like warm fuzzy movies and are willing to over-look a few ""Yah, right!"" moments, you will find a charming little film.

4855489,5,B005OZVXCU,"I was pretty sure I wasn't going to like this film since I don't like golf but I took the chance on it because of the actors.  Robert Duvall has always been great although I liked his westerns the best.  He's definitely one of those guys who was good as a youth and has grown better as he ages.  Kind of like good wine.  I've liked Lucas Black since he was a boy and doing television and what male couldn't like Melissa.  It's seldom you see a faith movie with such a simple story line and such deep meaning.  See it, feel it, trust it has become my new way of looking at faith whether it's in God or in something you have to do in life.  I enjoyed this story immensely.",1495065600,,670,4.03030303030303

4855491,4,B005OZVXCU,"Dr. David L. Cook, Ph. D., who authored the best-selling book ""SEVEN DAYS IN UTOPIA"", is one of  the most experienced and sought-after sports psychologists, in the USA.  Dr. Cook works with individual sports (GOLF) and team sports.  It was not until the latter part of the 20th Century, that psychology was recognized as a key factor in athletic sports.  The mind is a wonderful thing.  I don't know who said it but, they hit the mark.  If YOU- THINK-YOU -CAN, YOU WILL or MAY;  if YOU-THINK-YOU-CAN'T, YOU WON'T!

He is 89 and I have to be careful of movie content because he is uncomfortable with some subject matters. (When Mom was alive she told me that he had gotten a little ""prudish"" in his old age. Lol...) He LOVED this movie.  Dad told me he couldn't stop thinking about it after he watched it.  He reads the Bible for an hour every night after he goes to bed and for the first time, he said he couldn't focus on what he was reading !

4855522,3,B005OZVXCU,"I love Robert Duvall and it's always fun to see him act, but I thought the script for this movie was pretty miserable. It starts out interestingly, but you can see it descend into a religious sales pitch pretty quickly. This film, from what I've read, was financed by some church related organization and while I have no bone to pick with them, I wish the movie was identified as a sponsored film and not a true Hollywood release--which it most certainly is not. Again, Duvall is great, a skilled and interesting actor, but no film can rely on good acting alone. The script is horrid.",1475971200,,584,4.518867924528302

4855599,5,B005OZVXCU,"Seven Days in Utopia is a movie that touched my heart, mind and soul in many ways. It was not as I expected; in fact it overcame my expectations. The movie has all the elements that make for a good story and movie. It is based on truths and experiences from the author of the book that this movie is based on. It has drama, failures, meltdowns, crashes, angst, fears, as well as joy, love, forgiveness, enlightenment, redemption and a great ending...that is not really an ending.

I appreciated all that and more, in that there were no times of using God's names in vain, nor cursing, nor sexual situations nor potty language.  Rare in a Hollywood movie. To the contrary, the characters showed honor, honesty, strength, teachability, and faith in God. The acting and directing and cinematography are beautiful. What more could you want from a movie? It is touching, but not sappy; dramatic but not overdone.

I guess you could say I really enjoyed this movie and plan to add it to my collection.  Thank you to all who made this happen.  It is a blessing.",1444953600,,1054,4.585106382978723

The scene where the lesson of balance was taught using a boat, and the shot of Johnny at the Texas Open giving Luke the encouraging, ""you can do it son."" nod were so similar to The Karate Kid that I wonder why there has not been a lawsuit.

4855771,1,B005OZVXCU,"Starts promising but ends up gag-inducing.  Quite possibly Duvall's worst movie.

It would probably help if you were big on golf.  Or religion (think 'family values').  Maybe rodeo, too :)

At least one other reviewer mentioned that it probably borrowed from Karate Kid.  That crossed my mind too while watching this; the story tracks similarly.  (Well, except that Karate Kid is watchable, interesting and well done.)

I can understand wanting to make it an uplifting story.  But not sure what exactly religion added.  Was there 'product placement' advertising for big clubs and putters...or the church?

I wish we'd skipped this and watched one of Duvall's better movies instead.  Perhaps Tender Mercies, or The Great Santini.",1404864000,5,728,5.234782608695652

4855783,5,B005OZVXCU,"One of the best crafted explanations for the fact that men and women have an innate desire to believe in a good that is greater than themselves.  Excellent movie, even though just a little corny at times. But the remarkable message in this story is transcendental for the viewer.  The experience is one of the best I've had in my lifetime.  Well worth the view.  I wish everyone had a chance to see this movie.  The best attribute is that even though the movie touches on Christianity, based on the setting for the story, the message is universal.

Loved the prayer at the dinner table:

To have food when so many go hungry.
To have faith when so many are afraid.
To have friends and family when so many are alone.
For these things we give thanks.",1402185600,,747,4.408759124087592

The man finds his instructions odd but does what he is told and finds himself a better man and a much better golfer.  Well acted and a lesson in never giving up.

I cant believe anybody actually liked it. This movie was a total loser. I have never seen anything so sappy. I don't know how I managed to watch the whole thing.

It was a movie about a lot of wierd stuff totally unrelated to golf. And, the part that was relatd to golf was totally off-base. I about gagged when they displayed the leader board at the Texas Open full of 9s with a scattering of 7s & 8s. The director obviously had never seen a golf match. There were several pro golfers with cameo appearances in the movie. I am surpeised they had no input on what was portrayed. It was a diservice to their sport.",1399334400,7,771,4.14

I didn't know who Lucas Black was but if he isn't a Texan then he is a master of the accent.  It never sounded fake at all.  All the supporting parts were well cast and very well played.

And this guy is a pro golfer, pro painter, he can chisel, he can fly an airplane (that doesn't nose dive after the single engine going out), he befriends the guy in town that hates him in like a day, the guy gives him his cowboy hat (which is gay and would never happen); it's full of cliche lines. There's more, but I don't need to type it all. Watch the movie. There was no redeemable value here. I lost respect for Robert Duvall here.",1394928000,6,558,4.224299065420561

We LOVE movies of faith, Christian values, etc. but this one tried to throw in fly fishing, easel painting, chiseling, flying an airplane, cowboy poker (bull-chasing cowboys), fireworks, fire fly catching, and more non-related ""stuff"" just to keep a viewer engaged while managing to do none of it well.  This was rather pathetic.  Why didn't respected actor Robert Duvall help 'em get it right?

4855827,4,B005OZVXCU,Our 8 year old grandson was captivated by this story. He is a young golfer. As a family we enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to those who appreciate thought provoking movies that promote healthy values.,1389916800,,209,4.675675675675675

4855830,4,B005OZVXCU,"If you are one of those who would watch Robert Duvall read the phone book then this is for you.  Not that he doesn't do his usuall stand up job, he does.  But it could be one that gets by you if you don't watch to see what he is starring in.  The religious undertones are not offensive and the personal growth story is nice. But the best part is watching Duvall..as usual.",1389139200,,372,4.068493150684931

4855862,1,B005OZVXCU,"Robert Duvall should have been the highlight of this movie, but the script was below par, and the directing did nothing to help.  Lucas Black was ""okay"" with his part.  Because of the actors, I expected a movie with a level of sophistication that comes from mainstream production (not often found in Christian movies)... but this was not the case. This movie is painfully awful.",1388620800,6,378,4.8

4855871,4,B005OZVXCU,"This movie is rated G and has a good message. Lucas Black, who is a golfer, swerves to miss a Texas cow in the road and damages his car and thus, stays in the small town of Utopia while repairs are made. (Cows in Texas have a reputation for sneaking out of fences.) Robert Duvall, who knows a thing or two about golf, helps the young golfer with his mental game and it isn't all about the course and greens. Duvall interjects faith and other mental life skills into his unique golf coaching. It is a clean, decent movie that the whole family can watch. People of faith will probably enjoy it.",1384560000,2,592,4.294642857142857

This is really a good heartfelt, inspiring movie. It really makes you think about life and how you should just slow down and enjoy each day to the fullest. We tend to get so wrapped up in life that our days become ""just days"". This movie will really open your eyes a bit.

4855966,4,B005OZVXCU,"I found it a great movie, right up until near the end where it goes all ""God."" Personally, I'm not a Bible-bender, and typically avoid any connotation beyond the mere mention of prayer and belief in the Almighty. However, I was able to accept it's inclusion in this film mainly because they at least wait until the end (after I was hooked on the great story) to start the Holy-Rolling! Actually really sort of blew me away - my first impression, ""Oh man, why ruin such a great movie?"" I never really got over that aspect, and then to actually see the end of the movie, it request you go on-line for the viewing of its conclusion - uh, no thanks. Robert Duvall plays a typical fatherly, well-admired, genuine character which adds a lot of high quality to this good film. And there are a lot of professional golfers in it too! With the exception of the emotional appeal to faith in God, and of course the prompting to go to some (inevitably Biblical-propagating) website to view the end of the show, I liked everything about this movie. If you believe in God, love golf, have ever had a blow-up hole during a game, and understand the value of emotional control when faced with difficult situations, but still lose it when you can't seem to stay on your A-game, then you'll probably love this movie.",1369180800,2,1296,4.519148936170213

4855973,1,B005OZVXCU,The movie makes it's point and the first time that you watch you wonder what will happen next. However it is unclear what lessons are learnt with each experience that the main character has throughout the movie. Therefore I still don't understand how he comes to his end belief. Many men do believe that sport is the religion of life and are so addicted that it becomes their life but this movie isn't going to solve the problem of them creating their own world to the disappointment of their wives.,1368576000,4,499,4.555555555555555

4856022,2,B005OZVXCU,"This movie attributes deep therapeutic purpose to perfecting a golf swing, so will please a golf enthusiast, but I could not care less, so the movie rings hollow for me from the start. It resembles other formulaic stories of athletic success, like ""Hoosiers"" or ""Bad News Bears"" or ""Karate Kid,"" but the plot sags. Basically, the 'hero' is in a rough patch, wants to perfect his game, please his daddy and get the girl. Enter Robert Duvall as golf's answer to Mr. Miyagi or Yoda. The more I realized the direction it was going, the less I cared. My family got bored and left before the ending, which is gimmicky and annoying. Robert Duvall is great, though.

4856038,4,B005OZVXCU,"Seven Days in Utopia is a film that does not contain any form of profanity and is a penetrating journey of a golfing prodigy's need to rebound from a personal meltdown after a flawed performance in a pivotal tournament, Stranded in Utopia, Texas after a car accident, Luke meets rancher, Johnny Crawford (played by the peerless Robert Duvall) who offers him special tips on not just how to reconstruct his golf game but his spiritual life as well. In order to recapture his swing, Luke is assigned to do other activities (like fishing ) which on the surface have nothing to do with golf (or do they?). These scenes may remind viewers of ""The Karate Kid"" when Pat Morita kept assigning Ralph Macchio tasks bordering on drudgery (like waxing cars) in order to educate him in the art of karate. This is a good movie but the only thing preventing a five star rating is that it needed to be energized by a few more sequences of excitement. But I still would recommend it highly.",1358899200,,973,4.565714285714286
4856039,5,B005OZVXCU,We're very happy with this purchase. It was exactly was we wanted and was a very good value. Thank you!,1358899200,,103,4.2
4856040,5,B005OZVXCU,"This is an awesome family movie, not just for golf lovers. Has a great message to everyone. Besides, Lucas Black is such a great actor and wish I could see more of him.",1358640000,,168,4.121212121212121
4856041,4,B005OZVXCU,"Though this is a ""golf movie"" and the lessons the main character learns are in that backdrop of golf, the lessons go far beyond golf and are applicable to any of us, whether you've played golf or not (I would be in the latter category). At the end of the day, this film has a strong message that it's good to examine your life and see what you're really living for. Is it to win a big tournament? Get in the record books? Be the next superstar? Have the world's wealth? This movie is all about causing us to put life in proper perspective.

This is a generally feel-good, ""down home"" southern-feeling (Texas) film with practically no swearing or objectionable content. The story itself, however, I felt left something to be desired. I knew I was in for a bit of a bumpy ride early on in the film when the golfer ends up in this small town after a big defeat, and everyone in town seemingly is watching the Golf sports channel and thus finds out about his defeat. What kind of realism is that??? I know some people watch golf and all, but that's really stretching it...Anyway, this kind of implausible-but-predictable type stuff happens throughout the film. When you come to the place where you start to understand that this movie isn't really about golf, or really even too much about the story, as it is about its main points regarding life, you realize you can cut it a bit of slack. Of course, I didn't really come to that understanding until the very end of the movie...

In fact, if it wasn't for the ending, I probably wouldn't recommend the movie. I won't give it away, but it honestly surprised me, especially because the rest of the movie was fairly predictable and full of clichs.

The film's message is pretty generic and while seen by some as a ""Christian movie"", you won't find any real mention of Jesus. The main character's supposed ""born again"" experience (including with a song playing that boldly uses such words) isn't even remotely representative of a true Biblical ""born again"" experience, but it's more of just a general letting go of the past and what you've been living for to move forward kind of thing. Very generalized and watered-down, etc. Yet, because of the way it was portrayed, it didn't grandly concern me (though I do wish they would have chosen a different song that didn't use the ""born again"" verbage). The movie did a similar thing with its ""see, feel, trust"" thing that is used throughout the movie. It's all kind of generic, vaguely religious type stuff, rather than any real substance. (sidenote: the website that the movie directs people to at the end does have a page that's more specific regarding Jesus and brings more Christian-specific clarity to the movie). The movie's core message of examining your life to see if what you're living for will really matter in the end, I believe is one of great value.

The acting and production quality were fine and sufficient and that's about all that can be said about that. Nothing stellar.

This movie could be a perfectly fine ""family night"" type of movie, but I'd definitely recommend follow-up discussion to really discuss what some people live for vs. what the Bible says really matters, how we need to ""see, feel, trust"" in what's true and what's true is Jesus who IS the Truth, what being ""born again"" REALLY entails (i.e. repentance, faith in Jesus to save us from our sins, etc.) - that it's a whole new life in Jesus, how we need to strive for excellence in life (do everything well) but not lose perspective, the value of having a Godly mentor-like figure in our lives, etc.

4856050,5,B005OZVXCU,"An excellent story that shows how golf & life are very similar. The story is not so much about swing mechanics, putting strokes, etc. as much as it is about life & the inner self. All of the instructions by the character Devall plays are revolutionary or unconventional seemingly to have nothing to do with golf itself. I first read the book before watching this video. Although I loved the video & Robert Duvall's character I do think the book was better.

Do not get me started on all the messages and preaching RE: ""tolerance,"" ""the environment,"" etc., in MANY movies of last 10-15 years!  What a bore....

Rant concluded.

The plot involves nothing new: young man in trouble is taken under wing of older sage and is redeemed.  Regardless of what happens, what you predict, etc., most cannot escape the good feelings it evokes.  Even I didn't.  And yes, there is a very obvious message that will ruffle some feathers and bully for the writer for doing so.  The acting is genuine and refreshing.  No pretense to see here.  That ending was brave and much needed today!!!  Nope, I didn't check to see what happened!  If you are curious, watch the show and find out.

In summary, soon into the show I quit trying to predict what would happen next, etc., and just enjoyed the story.  Take a break and try it yourself.",1350518400,,1064,4.560846560846561

I had gotten an invitation to a pre-release screening of the film (It didn't work out; I stood in line for an hour but the theatre filled up before I got in), and I have admired the work of the two principal actors, Robert Duvall and Lucas Black, for years, but my reservations stemmed from having learned that the book on which the movie was based, Golf's Sacred Journey: Seven Days at the Links of Utopia, was yet another rah-rah self-help mental-game-of-golf book, and one which had quite a healthy dose of self-promoting fundamentalist-Christian proselytizing thrown in. I will admit that, based on that knowledge, and because of my skepticism in regards to the whole business (and it is a business - a huge business...) of mental coaching for better golf, I was prepared to dislike the movie before I even sat down.

I had a suspicion that my worst fears were going to be realized when the movie opened with a Bible quote. From that opening, a quick segue into the Lucas Chisolm (Lucas Black) character's meltdown on the last hole of a qualifying tournament for the Texas Open PGA Tour golf tournament was followed by a contrived plot mechanism that resulted in his being stranded for a week in the small town of Utopia, Texas, and his delivery into the hands of Johnny Crawford (Robert Duvall), a former PGA Tour player who runs a golf course and driving range.

Most of the middle of the movie is taken up with young Lucas Chisolm's tutelage in golf by Johnny Crawford, who uses quaintly unorthodox means to develop Lucas' mental game, exhorting him to ""See It (the shot), Feel It, Trust It"". This portion of the film is actually sweet and kind of ""aw-shucks"" down-homeish, and not too heavy-handed on the ""higher power golf guidance"" stuff - I did rather enjoy the middle part of the film (my enjoyment was helped along by the handsome Texas Hill Country scenery). There is the obligatory small-town romance sub-plot thrown in, as well as a number of flashbacks which fill in the back story on Lucas Chisolm's tournament meltdown and his years of near-abusive training in the game of golf at the hands of his obsessive father (whose poor advice while caddying for Lucas led to the disastrous final hole in the recent tournament). We also learn a bit of Johnny Crawford's history, and how (and why) he left the PGA Tour and landed in a podunk backwater in the Texas Hill Country.

The movie starts to break down a bit from there, with a strong hit of Christian fundamentalist ""seek guidance from a higher power"" dogma climbing out of the subtext and coming to the fore, and the final portion of the film, in which young Lucas battles down to the wire with fictional powerhouse pro golfer T. K. Oh (played by real-life PGA Tour pro K.J Choi) at the Valero Texas Open PGA Tour event borders on the laughable. Much is made in the rather scanty special features on the DVD of the ""authenticity"" of the pro golf action in the film, as well as the participation of a number of actual PGA Tour pros--including Stewart Cink, Rich Beem, and Rickie Fowler--when all these guys do is make a few golf swings in some scene-setting shots that establish the fact that yes, we are watching a PGA Tour event. As the competition comes down to an eventual playoff between Lucas Chisolm and ""T.K. Oh"", the two players exchange meaningful glances which are more suggestive of a ""your-place-or-mine"" exchange than subtle ""respect between competitors"" eye contact.

There are some quite inexcusable technical glitches in the golf tournament sequences. When ""T.K. Oh"" must make a million-to-1 chip-in from a downhill lie, in thick rough, from above the hole, to a fast, down-sloping green, the ball hits the green and rebounds backwards like a child's rubber bouncy ball, checking its momentum and allowing it to roll down toward the hole in a manner that gives it a legitimate chance of dropping into the hole. It is totally unrealistic behavior for a golf ball; indeed, from that lie, to that green, it is extremely unlikely that even a PGA Tour player could have imparted enough spin to the ball to have it back up even a little bit--it is obviously a CG shot that had the ball added by computer manipulation. Moments later, as T.K is shown putting from below the hole (after the miraculous spinning ball shot didn't go in, but luckily also did not roll all the way off the green to the water), the hole is seen to have the usual white-painted inner rim that is common in Tour events, but the subsequent close-up shot of the ball approaching the hole shows a hole with an unpainted rim - a rather sloppy continuity error.

Probably the worst golf-related technical error in the film is the ""putting secret"" that Johnny Crawford shows Lucas Chisolm, and which Chisolm uses in the final seconds of the film. It involves the use of a long-handled putter, but utilized croquet-style, from a position astride the line of the putt, facing the hole. This is an illegal stroke, as defined by Rule 16-1e, which states:
e. Standing Astride or on Line of Putt
The player must not make a stroke on the putting green from a stance
astride, or with either foot touching, the line of putt or an extension of that
line behind the ball.

When Crawford teaches Chisolm this trick, he tells him that he will ""know when to use it."" Chisolm uses a conventional putter throughout early portion of the tournament, only turning to the broom handle at a crucial, concluding moment. Makes me wonder what club he took out of his bag in order to accommodate the extra putter, and why the Golf Channel talking heads weren't all over the odd equipment choice during the telecast...

Another distraction in the golf sequences is the blatant and egregious product placement for Callaway golf products. Balls, caps, bags, clubs--nearly everything in the film that is golf-equipment related is a Callaway product. In the Valero Open segment, which features real-life Golf Channel personalities Kelly Tilghman and Brandel Chamblee covering the tournament, Brandel goes so far as to comment on how well Lucas Chisolm has been driving the ball with his new Callaway Octane driver--an obvious product plug that would never be allowed on the air in a sports telecast.

Another, more subtle, Callaway plug is a kind of reverse plug--in the close-up of the T.K. Oh putt that doesn't fall, the logo on his ball is very clearly visible as it rolls to a stop at the edge of the hole--and the ball is seen to be a Titleist. Now, in real life K.J. Choi is a ""Titleist Brand Ambassador"", and perhaps the folks at Acushnet would have balked at him being shown using a competitor's ball, even in a fictitious context, but the character he portrays could have been shown to be using a fictitious ball. The fact that his missed putt is clearly shown to have been made not only with a competitor's ball, but with a ball manufactured by a competitor with whom the Callaway Company has wrangled in court over ball-technology patents (and lost...) is telling, and an obvious dig at Titleist.

All things considered, Seven Days in Utopia is only fair as a golf film. The story is, for the most part, clumsy and ill-constructed; it features blatant product placement for Callaway Golf (but don't think that I have a grudge against Callaway--I play a Callaway Big Bertha Titanium 454 driver and a Big Bertha 3-wood that I am very happy with), and it is, as a whole, rather heavy on the mental-game hoo-ha that I find tiresome. The film's saving graces, in my estimation (and the reason it got three stars instead of just two) are the middle portion, which is, as I mentioned above, rather sweet and down-homeish, which I liked; the Texas scenery, and the overall fine performances turned in by most of the actors involved.

  **********  SPOILER ALERT  **********

The following portion of my review contains a spoiler concerning the ending of the film. If you have not yet seen the film being reviewed, and do not wish to learn a vital fact about the end of the story which could spoil your enjoyment of the movie, read no further!

Don't say I didn't warn you...

The final moment of the film is a blatantly self-promoting gimmick for author David Cook's products related to this movie and the book on which it is based--a thinly-disguised fundamentalist Christian tract masquerading as a book of golf mental-game self-help tips.

You aren't shown whether or not Lucas Chisolm's final, potentially tournament-winning putt (made croquet-style, and thus illegal anyway...) drops. The screen fades to black, and you are exhorted to visit the website [...] to find out whether or not he made the putt. The website turns out to be a proselytizing site for David Cook's fundamentalist-Christian life-guidance teachings, as well as a merchandising site for products associated with the film where you are invited to buy balls, bags, etc. (all Callaway, of course...) with the film's ""SFT"" (See It, Feel It, Trust It) logo, and multiple copies of the DVD to give to your friends in order to pass along the message, just as the book encourages the reader to buy and pass along ten copies. And they never do tell you if Lucas made the putt...

4856126,2,B005OZVXCU,"Let me start by saying that I have not read the book upon which this movie is based, so this review is solely based on the quality of the movie from the perspective of an avid golfer and golf fan.

I don't have a problem with movies that try to teach a lesson or have some sort of societal commentary to them; after all, I loved the ""Star Wars"" saga.  My main issue is this: if a movie is trying to teach something, which this one clearly is, it must do so within the context of a good movie, and this missed the fairway by a wide margin.

Robert Duvall is his usual excellent self, while Lucas Black gives a solid performance as the young pro golfer.  His golf skills helped make the character believable.  Melissa Leo, Kathy Baker, and Deborah Ann Woll provide good background performances.  It's the script and the details which combine to derail their efforts.

Rather than re-hash the plot, I'll summarize what I see as the problems.  First, I was personally distracted by the extensive ads for Callaway golf.  I found it unbelievable that someone on a very low-level pro tour would be so well-sponsored by a major golf manufacturer; not only that, I found the excessive ads to be distracting.  (My wife, for the record, thought that it was a realistic portrayal of a pro golfer.)

Secondly, I had an issue with the golf announcers constantly referring to the Korean golfer by his full name.  I understand that this was to hear the constant ""T.K.O."" reminder that he was a great golfer with a very intimidating name to match his game, but most golf fans are used to hearing one-word references to the players at regular intervals, either by the first or the last name, but never by the full name.  So that was another distraction for me.

Finally, there's the ending.  Aside from the brutal cliffhanger, which left both my wife and me shaking our heads at the atrocity of not resolving the plot, I was already aghast at Oh's chip shot from a few moments before.  It's not that it hit the flagstick; that happens often enough in the golf world.  However, how many times in the golf world has a chip shot hit the green and hopped about six inches in the air, as well as about 4 inches backward?  I mean, come on.  There were numerous PGA pros that were in the cast; surely the movie-makers could have asked just one of them to do a bit of consulting, right?  Just to have someone mention that a golf ball not just defying, but virtually laughing at, the laws of physics would turn off some viewers who actually play golf from the message?  Surely someone could have said, ""Hey, if this ball lands in the rough just above the green, it could just trickle out onto the fringe and roll down to the hole, and it'll look much more realistic than this garbage we're actually doing,"" and then golf fans such as myself wouldn't think the ending so ridiculous.  (Note that I haven't even mentioned the absurdity of a player using his regular putter for an entire tournament while carrying around an extra putter instead of another club he could have actually used, only to decide in a playoff to bring out the extra putter.  Were the writers channeling Judge Smails in ""Caddyshack"" there?)

I had high hopes going in, but this movie was a bit of a shank.",1335052800,4,3248,4.48469387755102

When I got home, I ordered the book for me and the movie for my son from Amazon.com for Christmas, I knew he would enjoy the story line.
Had looked other places for them but to no avail. Thanks to Amazon.com I found them both. Had them in just a couple days. Service is great.

Had company on Christmas Day and we watched the movie. No one had seen it men were thinking this was going to be a ""chic flick"" but were much surprised. They enjoyed it as well as the women. There is something for all in this movie.

4856245,5,B005OZVXCU,"What a great movie! My husband and I were glued to the screen the entire movie. This movie doesn't have any big car or fight scenes, because it didn't need any. I am waiting for the blue ray version to come out. This is definitely one for the DVD library!",1322956800,20,255,4.12
4856246,2,B005OZVXCU,"I was really intrigued by this movie, being a cowboy that golfs. And, with Robert ""Augustus McCrae"" Duvall in the lead, I just had to see it. So let's start from there.

One star for a Great Cast! I think Robert Duvall could be in the next remake of the worst movie ever made and, at the very least, pull it out of the cellar. Not make it the best movie ever but at least give it a measure of respectability. In UTOPIA Duvall does just that. He's the sort of mentor that you'd like to have, regardless of the art or science, so why not golf? Made me proud to be a golfer AND a cowboy and taught me the legitimacy of where the two might meet.

Lucas Black does similarly well. Passionate and fiery. And the best golf swing among actors that I have seen of late.

Another star for the overall premise. Golf is a head game. True enough. So the whole schtick of seeing and feeling and trusting is absolutely right on. Never mind that there is nothing new here. It's a lesson that bears repeating again and again and again. And, like I already said, bringing golf to the big screen in a Western is truly enjoyable.

But that's where it all ended for me. I really tried to completely like this movie but continually ""missed the putt."" It felt like I was watching a weird-golfing-self-improvement-documentary instead of a movie. Mind you, there are places for the one and places for the other but I found the combination of the two more than a bit unsettling and, yes, hokey and predictable!

Yes, Luke would change his game in Utopia. Yes, he would catch the fish in Utopia. Yes, he would beat a supposed four-time Masters Champion in his first outing after a total golfing meltdown. But wait! Did he make the putt? The ending was so campy, cheesy and disappointing that I couldn't believe it. And then to have, as Ralphie from A CHRISTMAS STORY put it, ""a crummy commercial!"" at the end in the form of a self-help web site flashing on the screen was absolutely too much! The whole thing would make a great high-pressure infomercial!

And all of this goes without saying anything about the screenwriters' all too apparent naivet about the bigger picture -- about the grand game of golf itself! (Oh! and if you lack artistic talent and cannot paint realistic trees and landscapes, you might as well give up the game right now!)

Yeah. Go ahead and watch it but do it with your eyes open going into it.

THE (GOLFING) HORSEMAN",1322611200,8,2418,4.442437923250564
4856247,5,B005OZVXCU,"Every person I saw this movie with, and I saw it in the theater more than once with several different people, said the same thing, they loved it and wanted to own it on video. Recently, I talked to a woman whose son worked as a crew member. He said the crew didn't have high hopes for this modest-budgeted film at the time, and they were all surprised at just how good it turned out to be when it was released.

It's a feel-good movie about accomplishing dreams that makes a person want to see it again and again. They even make golf interesting. The faith aspect of it is sweet and comforting and never mushy. The scenery is beautiful; the characters are great; Duvall is the best! He rides his horse on the golf course! Have the Kleenex handy, it will touch your heart.",1322524800,88,771,4.317241379310345
4856248,4,B005OZVXCU,"""How can a game have such an affect on a man's soul? The way I see it, how can it not?""  When Luke Chisolm's (Black) big chance at a golf tournament ends in a disaster he drives away wanting to give up golf.  When an accident lands him in the town of Utopia he meets a rancher named Johnny Crawford (Duvall) who can teach him about golf, and much more.  I have to admit that many of the ""faith-based"" movies that I have seen start off good then end up being very cheesy where everything works out perfect without any consequences or obstacles to avoid.  This one was heading down that path but veered of sharply and ended up having one of the best endings I have seen in a movie.  All that aside, this is a fantastic family movie that everyone will love and is a rare G rated movie that is good.  While this is a golf movie, this is also so much more and Duvall plays a type of Mr. Myagi character in the way that only he can.  I can go on and on about this movie but I will simply say...this is a must watch.  Overall, one of the best sports movies to come out lately as well as one of the top ten of the year so far.  I highly recommend. I give it an A.
