8568604,5,B00BHLTJ1C,"I remember when Mill Creek was born for consumers. Do you remember seeing the T.V. ad hawking 50 Classic Horror films on 12 double sided DVD's......hurry now & get your order before Halloween? Yeah, I remember that. I remember thinking that it looked ultra cheap and incredibly interesting at the same time. They've moved on and up since then, and I've probably got most every public domain movie ever available through them. Now they're making deals with larger movie studios, putting out blu-rays and making better product. At some point a deal was made with a bunch of large studios to get lesser known films out on multi DVD packs. Mill Creek is best suited for this, and know what they're doing. In the past they put as many as 4-5 movies on single layer flipper discs. But now, with these larger studio releases, they've moved up quality wise and put 2 films each on a single sided dual layer disc. Now this may not be the uber high quality that you want, but this is probably the only DVD release some of these films are going to get now, so it's better than not having them at all. Time for some mini synopsis on this 8 Movie collection of Pulse-Pounding Flicks.

The Replacement Killers (Extended Cut):
Failing to kill anymore because of his conscience, a troubled hit-man seeks aid from a forger to help him get papers to China. However, the drug-lord has hired replacements to finish the job and kill the hit-man.

Truth or Consequences N.M.:
Keifer Sutherland stars in and directs this gritty and romantic story of a simple heist that ends in murder and kidnapping.

Love Lies Bleeding:
Duke and Amber, newlyweds, stumble onto a drug deal turned deadly and finds a duffel bag stuffed with dirty money. They hit the road to start the life they've always dreamed about until a corrupt DEA agent, Pollen, comes to reclaim the money. The chase begins with non-stop, hair-raising action as they are forced to outwit Pollen and fight for their lives.

The Point Men:
Tony Eckhardt (Christopher Lambert) is as an Israeli secret service agent assigned to track and assassinate Amar, a terrorist who is threatening the future of the Middle East peace process.

The Contractor:
Wesley Snipes is back in this explosive action-thriller about a deadly assassin who finds himself on the run when an attempt to kill a terrorist mastermind in London goes terribly wrong.

Face of Terror:
A hard-edged, American cop searches for his kidnapped sister in Spain and uncovers an explosive terrorist plot.

Blood Crime:
Hollywood legend James Caan (The Godfather, Mickey Blue Eyes) and explosive young actor Johnathon Schaech (Splendor, How To Make An American Quilt) team up for a gripping crime thriller about the darkest kind of revenge.

The Hunt for Eagle One: Crash Point:
The action-packed sequel to The Hunt for Eagle One. When terrorists take over a military base and steal an encoder that allows control over commercial airlines, The Strike Force team must find the terrorists before it is too late.

All the films look and sound great (especially for those of you who are used to the varying quality of Mill Creeks earlier movie packs). All of the films are in anamorphic widescreen with Dolby Digital sound. There's no way you can go wrong picking up this set. I've even seen it at stores for 5 bucks. Less than one dollar per movie for some great weekend entertainment. This is a must purchase item.",1371772800,2,3402,4.781942078364565
