1796007,5,B00006Z58L,"The ""Classical Pilates"" COMPLETE Universal Reformer Series DVD is the most accurate and purest example of the original Pilates Method as taught by Joseph H. Pilates. This is a beautifly exciting DVD and I am continually inspired by the excellent certified teachers as they perform the exercises with such grace and flowing beauty. I constantly hear new information as I listen to the insightful and in depth instructions on this DVD and learn a new appproach to intigrating the method into my mind and body. I use the DVD in addition to reformer lessons I take with excellent certified teachers and have my lessons strengthened and enhanced by the treasure chest of information and accurate visuals. As I begin to learn more advanced forms I am challenged and excited to see the forms I will be doing and I am confident in the master instructions on this DVD. I also have this series in VHS and I use the Classical Pilates Matt VHS. I can say my progression to more advanced reformer has been helped by these tapes. I recommed this DVD for anyone who wants to seriously learn how this incredible method can bring the mind and body to its full potential in strength, corrected posture, cardiovascular endurance, abundance energy and a wonderful sense of well being.",1036972800,15,1264,4.802752293577981
1796008,5,B00006Z58L,"It is wonderfully refreshing to see the Pilates method preserved the way Joseph H. Pilates meant it to be, and the best way to derive maximum benefit from his amazing body conditioning technique.  If you know about people in the business, master instructor Bob Liekens, commentator Alycea Ungaro, and director/soloist Peter Fiasca all studied extensively with master instructor Romana Kryzanowska, who is one of the foremost authorities of Joseph H. Pilates' original method.  This DVD is a true and thorough exposition of the Pilates Universal Reformer Series. In contrast to Classical Pilates' exemplary compilation of the Universal Reformer workouts, there are many celebrities and fitness professionals who have jumped on the Pilates bandwagon (without in-depth or comprehensive study of the method) and produced videos that are either technically derivative or piecemeal.  In the Pilates world, passion runs deep within those who truly care about preserving the method with historical accuracy.  I hope that Classical Pilates continues their fine work.",1036886400,15,1057,5.628930817610063
1796009,5,B00006Z58L,"I have been working with the Classical Pilates Reformer basic-advanced VHS to facilitate my progress in the lessons and classes I take with a private instructor.  Bob Liekens' masterful instruction, Alycea Ungaro's insight and wisdom of the method, and the clearness and exactness of the performances by such highly skilled Pilates professionals (Peter Fiasca, Junghee Kallender, Jamie Trout) have helped me to improve my Pilates workouts more rapidly than before I started working with the tape.  I bought this DVD because I prefer this format and because it included the super-advanced workout as well.  We all have dreams and aspirations.  At first viewing, I was so mesmerized by Peter Fiasca's super-advanced workout that I watched it all the way through to the end.  It was comparable to watching an athletic performance of dance.  Such incredible strength and beauty...I had no idea that the Pilates method was so developed, and that one's technique could be so finely honed as Fiasca's.  I am grateful to have discovered the Pilates technique, for it has made a dramatic improvement in my body and my life, and I am also indebted to Classical Pilates for producing such high quality technique videos which are educational, motivational and inspirational.",1035936000,13,1262,5.217821782178218
1796010,5,B00006Z58L,"This DVD is a must have for any Pilates person.  Two hours long, four levels of Reformer real-time workouts for only $... -- I have not seen a better value advertised.  And it is so easy to find the workout or exercise you are looking for on DVD.  Thank you Classical Pilates!",1035936000,8,276,4.269230769230769
1796011,5,B00006Z58L,"I love it!  It's better than the tape I got with my Performer from QVC.  I also bought their Mat tape.  When I workout along with their tapes, it's like I have my own private Pilates class at home.  Bob Liekens is a master instructor of the highest caliber, and the performers on the tape are excellent.  They are all very inspirational.  Classical Pilates is first class! I highly recommend their tapes and hope they produce more.",1033430400,12,431,4.532467532467533
1796012,5,B00006Z58L,"The Universal Reformer video Series are ""one of a kind"" accurate instructional tapes of the original Pilates Method as taught by Joseph H. Pilates, on apparatus he designed. I use these videos to compliment the lessons I take with certified instructors. I am constantly learning corrections to my form and movements as I can clearly observe the exercises and listen to the insightful and in-depth instructions. I recommend these videos for beginning students to those becoming instructors. The talented certified instructors who demonstrate these exercises are an inspiration to watch! I look foward to learning these exercises as my physical ability continually improves and expands into more advanced forms. These videos teach you exactly what Pilates is and how to perform the method safely and correctly.",1032134400,9,808,5.420634920634921
1796013,5,B00006Z58L,"I just finished watching Classical Pilates ""The Complete Mat Workout Series,"" and it is fabulous! I am thrilled there is such an excellent video devoted to the ORIGINAL Method as Joseph Pilates created it and all that it stands for. With so many variations on the Method out now, many people don't even know what true Pilates is -- well, this is it!! It is excellent for beginners, because of the clarity and detail of instruction, yet is also wonderful for advanced students, because it contains more advanced exercises than most other Pilates videos do. If you can't take class from a properly certified instructor, this is the next best thing.",1029283200,6,646,4.828828828828829
1796014,5,B00006Z58L,"Peter Fiasca's tape most clear and comprehensive tape I have seen. He understands that Pilates'is a centering and strengthing tool for your body and your well-being.  His experience, dedication, and expert influences, have led to an imaginative tape that I can recommend to those just starting their Pilates journey as well as those who are well on their way. His tape invites you into the Pilates world where your physical and mental health are gently coxed to perform their at their most efficient and most beautiful.",1023580800,5,519,5.034883720930233
1796015,5,B00006Z58L,"Like all Classical Pilates' videos, this one shows Pilates the way Joseph H. Pilates originally intended. This Classical Pilates video demonstrates the true and pure Pilates method at the highest levels of technical form: this video will be the ""the gold standard"" by which all other videos are measured.  This video is for everyone: beginners - instructors. It's great to see this kind of technical accomplishment, comprehensiveness, and clarity in a Pilates video.  It's also fantastic to to see how versatile and amazing the Pilates method is. I recommend this video, and all Classical Pilates videos to everyone I know.",1023580800,8,623,5.22
1796016,5,B00006Z58L,"I played college football and had to stop because of a knee injury.  This was seriously discouraging because I had hopes of going pro.  When you get an injury, other parts of the body try to compensate.  As a result, my good knee was beginning to hurt because I would shift too much weight there in order to avoid using my injured knee. Then my back started hurting.
After going through physical therapy to rehabilitate my knee, the PT recommended that the next step was Pilates.  I had never heard of Pilates, but I wanted to do everything I could to help myself.  After taking lessons twice each week for six months, my knee was feeling much stronger. Just as important, my whole body was more aligned, more flexible, and more strong.  Really, I never felt better.
My instructor suggested that I get this DVD to practice on my own and to see where Pilates goes.  I watched it and learned a lot.  My workouts in Pilates have improved because I saw timing and transitions that bring all the exercises to a better level.",1050019200,3,1019,4.5
1796017,5,B00006Z58L,"I am new to pilates and am having a hard time finding instructional DVD's for the reformer. Do you need the box that is pictured here to work out with this DVD? I just have a reformer and no box. Do I need that in order to follow this DVD?
Thanks",1049932800,,246,3.843137254901961
1796018,5,B00006Z58L,"As a college professor in exercise physiology, I know that life has many educational objectives because they keep us growing, changing, and evolving as individuals in valuable ways. This DVD offers a complete education regarding the ultimate aims of Pilates: the flow, the articulation of movement, the energy, and the style.
Educational objectives are the basis of all teaching, from kindergarten to esteemed universities of learning.  With Pilates, learning is no less than deep personal evolution, where someone can stay physically fit at the highest levels, in addition to experiencing renewal of one's mental and spiritual life.
I recommend this Pilates DVD because the performers are top notch, and they show what the educational objectives are.  Education is a foundation in our lives just as the Pilates method is a foundation for every other aspect of physical activity.",1049414400,3,879,5.36231884057971
1796019,5,B00006Z58L,"My wife bought one of those Performers from QVC two years back and devoured the instructional tape that came with the machine. I was skeptical but I tried it out myself.  The results of increased mobility and flexibility were almost immediate and I was impressed.  But we both had the sense that this was just an introduction to the diverse program Joseph Pilates invented.  In our search on the web for a more challenging workout, we discovered this DVD.  The numerous exercises in four different levels are quite compatible with the Performer and we have reached new heights with our little machine.  It is a program for those who take their Pilates sincerely yet it is a refreshing workout at the same time.  We were inspired to purchase the Classical Pilates Mat DVD to augment our home program and I encourage you to try either one of these terrific DVDs.",1048982400,6,860,4.7
1796020,5,B00006Z58L,"Pilates is the star of this show, brilliantly portrayed by a cast of certified instructors worthy of an award.  Master instructor Liekens guides you expertly through Pilates workouts from Modified Basic to the Super Advanced level and Commentator Ungaro eloquently directs your approach to the exercises.  Performers Fiasca, Kallander and Trout shine radiantly in their execution of movement.  This production is a stellar example of how it should be done.",1038528000,7,456,5.485714285714286
1796021,5,B00006Z58L,"I have been doing Pilates for 2 years and seemed to reach a plateau. I bought a reformer and did mat work as well, but stopped getting results. I bought the Classical reformer DVD as well as the Classical mat DVD and the results in just a couple weeks have been exponential! It really is the only DVD you will ever need. It includes everything from beginning to super advanced. Although for most the super advanced seems to be for entertainment purposes only. Those exercises are for those who are into fitness for a living like dancers, gymnasts and the like. But it gives you a goal and a example on the potential of the Pilates workout. All the exercises are well explained and well demonstrated. If you are a beginner or have been doing it a long time, you will benefit from this DVD greatly! The production is low budget, but you get a nuclear bang for your buck. No gloss, no unecessary frills, just Pilates in it's original intended form. There are no contemporaries to this series.",1038355200,50,989,4.5307262569832405

7973396,5,B00006Z58L,Order with caution!  I ordered this item last December and still haven't received it.  Amazon wants me to wait another 1-2 months for delivery (April-May).  Many others have the same problem.,1079308800,7,191,5.096774193548387
7973397,1,B00006Z58L,"Would like to give more stars but I can't because I haven't gotten it yet! I second the frustration with one reviewer who has been waiting since December to get this DVD.  I have received the mat workout and like it very much.  However, I got a reformer for Christmas and have been waiting, and waiting and waiting .....  I'm not sure what the problem is.  They shouldn't say delivery is 1-2 weeks when it isn't.  Looking forward to getting it one of these days.",1076198400,4,462,4.3882352941176475
7973398,3,B00006Z58L,"I haven't tried this dvd but do intend to buy it. I'm not buying based on any of the reviews here because I do view them as suspect. As a linguist working for law enforcement and security agencies, I was put off by the fact that close to all of the reviews here do actually seem to be written by the same person--even the ones purposely altered. The linguistic patterns, sentence structure and consistency in punctuation/spelling are too similar and wouldn't fool anyone who knows what to look for. NONETHELESS, I rarely let reviews influence me unless they're mostly negative or too consistently positive to be real. In this case, I'm going to try this pilates dvd and hope for the best. LOL! The reputation of the pilates method over the years is encouragement enough. I'll just stick to reviews elsewhere on the net which are completely independent and separate from money-making ventures such as Amazon or B&N...they don't insult my intelligence.",1075334400,5,950,4.87037037037037
7973399,5,B00006Z58L,"I would like to express my gratitude to the professionals who created this Classical Pilates DVD.  Bob Liekens, the master instructor who does all of the voiceover instruction, is exceptional at communicating the practice and principles of the Pilates method.  Alycea Ungaro, the commentator, who also wrote the best-selling book ""Pilates Body in Motion"" gives an intuitive approach to each of the workouts.  All of the soloists are both strong and graceful. It is obvious that they are truly experts of the Pilates method and not just models. Finally, since learning how to do exercises on equipment can be tricky, I appreciated the director's way of showing the entire body on the apparatus at all times and the transitions from one exercises to another. This is a wonderful DVD to learn about the Reformer workouts and the Pilates method.",1060214400,4,841,5.0359712230215825
7973400,5,B00006Z58L,"I was completely satisfied with this Classical Pilates Universal Reformer Series DVD.  It is devoted 100% to the demonstration of exercises that Mr. Pilates created for this apparatus.  I have enjoyed taking Pilates lessons so much that I purchased a collapsable Reformer for my home, although I have yet to fold it up and put it away.  Working out at home with this DVD is serving me well, even though I still take a weekly lesson with a certified instructor.  If you become as interested in the Pilates method, go for it! I highly recommend having your own Reformer and trying this DVD. It shows just how far you can take the Pilates method and it is the best compliment to the equipment. Out of the several manufacturers whose equipment I have tried at different studios, I highly recommend the Gratz Industries, which they use also on this DVD.  Enjoy!",1059868800,3,856,4.68
7973401,5,B00006Z58L,"The Performer I bought from QVC this winter has been given a new life, thanks to this DVD! I was getting tired of the same routine from the video that came with the equipment.  This DVD has four complete workouts, from beginner to really advanced. I enjoy working out again! I suggest this DVD to anyone who has a Performer like mine or the studio Reformer as well.",1057622400,8,365,4.367647058823529
7973402,1,B00006Z58L,Were do you get a thing like this work out had.  I believe it was called the reformer.  I wished I would have paid more attention to it when I bought it.  I was very disapointed with it.  I also plan to resell it because I have no use for it.,1056499200,2,242,3.6862745098039214
7973403,5,B00006Z58L,"This DVD inspired me to take my workout to the next level.  I train regularly with a local Pilates instructor and really enjoy my lessons.
The virtue of this DVD is that it demonstrates the full-range of workout levels, far beyond intermediate, and even beyond the advanced level.  The Reformer super advanced workout shown here is one for the history books; it is totally inspiring. Just to be aware of where the Pilates method can lead is truly exciting. Watching this DVD even makes me want to become an instructor so I can share the Pilates method with other people.
The other Reformer videos I've seen only show a single workout level for about the same price. So, for $...you can't beat it.  The production (lighting, sets) of this DVD could have been better, but what you get is real substance and real inspiration.  The other vidoes I've seen have slick production value, but lack the classical approach and thorough range of workout levels.",1050710400,12,949,4.7682926829268295
