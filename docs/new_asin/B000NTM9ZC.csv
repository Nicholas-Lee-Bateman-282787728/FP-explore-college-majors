8181402,4,B000NTM9ZC,"I am a huge theatre fan! Going to plays has always been an enjoyable experience for me, and I've always dreamed of participating in theatrical productions.

""The Best of the Tony Awards: The Plays"" contains several scenes from famous dramas and comedies.  All the scenes are superbly acted in a live setting.  This fact makes them extremely enjoyable.  A brief narration before each scene places the action in the appropriate context.  My favorite scenes are as follows:

1. ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."" Gary Senise portrays the inmate McMurphy, who pretends to be insane to escape a prison sentence.  His flamboyant atitude clashes with authoritative Nurse Ratchet.  In this scene, McMurphy tries to buoy the spirits of inmate Chief before they both undergo shock treatment therapy.
2. ""Lettice and Lovage."" Maggie Smith is hilareous in this comic scene about an eccentric tour guide at a British estate.
3. ""Fences."" James Erle Jones portrays Troy who confronts his son in this heartwrenching scene.

Please give this excellent compilation a chance.  God bless.",1279411200,2,1069,5.162790697674419
8181403,4,B000NTM9ZC,"The best way to think about this DVD is that it gives you snippets of
fantastic moments of Broadway plays...not musicals, but the plays. Just
to see James Earl Jones in ""Fences"" and Maggie Smith in ""Lettice and Lovage"" is worth the price of the disc.  The problem is that these
moments are so good, that we dearly want to see the whole play. Unfortunately, it appears that DVDs of the entire performance of some of these selections do not exist. Nevertheless, seeing some excellent shorts is better than none at all.",1184544000,6,516,4.608695652173913
8181404,4,B000NTM9ZC,"I always enjoy watching moments from the broadway shows. I believe this is the first DVD out that shows scenes from actual broadway plays. I have the other DVDs that show moments from the musicals which I still prefer as I am a musical buff. However, I still enjoyed watching scenes from the broadway plays. I only wish that the scenes were longer. I am sure that since this one has been released, there will be more magical momernts from Broadway to come out.",1181174400,5,460,4.488095238095238
