For some ill-begotten reason Funimation had decided to put two random episodes as the first two episodes on this DVD ""The Lesson"" & ""Hunted,"" which actually took place sometime AFTER the ""Space Invaders"" story arc NOT before it!

This is THE correct episode order for Season 3.

3-1  Michealangelo's Christmas Rescue

3-2  Space Invaders (part 1)

3-3  Space Invaders (part 2)

3-4  Space Invaders (part 3)

3-5  Worlds Collide (part 1)

3-6  Worlds Collide (part 2)

3-7  Worlds Collide (part 3)

3-8  Touch and Go

3-9  Hunted

3-10  H.A.T.E

3-11  Nobody's Fool

3-12  New Blood

3-13  The Lesson

3-14  Mission of Gravity

If Funimation can't follow this, then they are much worse than what people say they are.",1111708800,,1110,4.708108108108108
