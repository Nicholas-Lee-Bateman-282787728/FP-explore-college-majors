A very good movie feature Jack Wagner, Daphne Zuniga and Zack Ward.
The story is original and the movie is enough well made!

Howie, with the spirit of Hunter in him, helps Kyle in solving a dastardly plot. A police veterinarian, Amanda Morton (play by the actress Daphne Zuniga!!!!!!! from Melrose Place) will help Kyle and Howie for found the main guy...
Daphne Zuniga and Jack Wagner play again together after ""Melrose Place"" and ""Artificial Lies""
I recommend this movie.
Great and good comedy!",1052784000,3,693,4.688524590163935
