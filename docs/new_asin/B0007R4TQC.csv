I did feel, however, that the extras section of the DVD's was a last minute add-on, and that the content should have been included in the main feature, but this is a minor quibble and does not in any way detract from hunting with Peter!

And after Amazon saying that delivery could be up to 2 months, the DVD's arrived in 7 days!! Amazing service to New Zealand; thank you!",1151798400,11,521,4.262626262626263

8050701,3,B0007R4TQC,"What can you say about a collection of videos showing a series of hunts for the Big Five of Africa (lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo, and rhino)?

What attracted me to buy the videos was the chance to see how the Big Five were hunted after years of reading books about safaris and see the still pictures in them.  The videos were about what I expected: Capstick shares some anecdotes about his experiences as  PH (Professional Hunter, or guide), and occasionally throws in a trick or tip useful while hunting. The stalk is shown with the successful collection of a trophy animal from each of the Big Five, as well as many other herbivore species such as kudu, warthog, and zebra. Given that a license for each of the Big Five is nowadays upwards of $10,000 an animal, and a safari costs around $5,000 per person per day, I wonder what the series productions costs totaled.

What impressed me from the videos was the amount of effort to find a trophy-sized animal; for example, when hunting elephants, it took several days of walking anywhere from six to twelve miles per day under very hot and dry weather through very dense vegetation before a suitable one was located. I was further amazed at how hard it was to bring an animal down, even using large calibre rifles with correctly placed shots: up to five or more; in all cases. African game of any size is very much tougher than its equivalent North American animal.

What hurts the series from my rating it higher than three stars was that the sound on these videos leaves much to be desired.

Much of the time, the dialogue cannot be heard because of wind noise on the microphone, the low volume of the whispers during stalks (to be expected), or the accents of the PH's. Subtitles, of which there are none, would have helped with the dialogue, Perhaps the producers did not feel them warranted, as the hearing-impaired probably should not be going on safari <sarcasm>.

Additionally, the music background is unnecessary and overly loud. The composer included loud horn or drum sounds during some of the stalks, apparently to add ""drama"". The series would have been better off without background music of any kind, and there is already enough drama from getting with 10-15 yards of a very large animal that may charge and stomp the PH and his client into the ground.",1447286400,,2321,4.674019607843137

8050703,1,B0007R4TQC,"I replaced my old worn out videos w/ the  DVD's. Was thrilled to get them as Peter  Capstick is one of my favorite Adventure / outdoor writers.

 Delivery was fantastic.

Was not impressed w/ the very thin box that contains the set, could have been a little more substantial.

PROBLEM : they will not load or play in my computer.
  they will not load or play in my portable DVD player.
  they will not load or play in my Livingroom  DVD player.
  they will not load or play in my Bedroom DVD player.
  By "" they "" I mean all six discs.

I do not expect any difficulty in returning them to Amazon. Theyare ALWATS very good about that.

UPDATE: 2ND SHIPMENT ARRIVED IMMEDIATELY.  DVDs work in two out of five of my units... will not load in PC.
Rather than give up and send them back to  AMAZON I contacted the publisher directly to see if they had any such complaints in the past and how to rectify it.  I was surprised that on my first phone call to their office in Kerrvile Texas Ken Wilson answered the phone personally ( Co-start and producer ). Very nice and pleasant conversation w/ Ken. He asked that I send the package directly back to him and he himself would give me a refund.  I explained I was looking for answers to the problem not money back... I love these films.  He stated he wanted his team to check them out and see if there might be a problem on their end.  We agreed that I'll have my  techie friend check them out first to see if I am doing something wrong .

I AM VERY PLEASED w/ THE CUSTOMER SERVICE of both  Amazon  and Sportsmen on Film

Ken did state that they have never had this complaint and that they have been distributing these worldwide since Peter died.",1416700800,4,1687,4.236593059936909

8050708,2,B0007R4TQC,"Got this collection as I have read all the books and I collect african hunting literature and video. I thought I was on to a classic, and, in some way, I was. But, it is not what you expect: Capstick talking about hunting, whilst others do it. The hunts are not filmed well, there aren't enough of them and in most cases you may not even see the shot.
On the other hand, it was good to see what Capstick looked like and his style. Would I have bought this had I read this review? Probably not!",1319414400,4,493,4.092783505154639
