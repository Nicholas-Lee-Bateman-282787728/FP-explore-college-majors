8067640,3,B0009VS638,"(Spoiler Alert) Although it was a good idea to make a film about Lapu-Lapu, the film didn't quite meet my expectations. The set, location, cast and production team did a good job, but more research needed to be done, and the dearth in historical accuracy gravely affected the film's authenticity. Realistic means of communication were sacrificed for dramatic effects. For instance, the Spanish came in with cannons ablaze, causing natives on the beach to scatter in panic. Yet, in the next scene, they are shown calmly standing on the beach, waiting for the Spaniards to disembark, and readily accepting the latter's statement of friendly intentions, with no sign of outrage or hostility upon being fired upon with huge cannons. That being said, the film seemed well-intentioned, and is a good start for better future historical endeavors.",1219968000,,839,5.176470588235294
