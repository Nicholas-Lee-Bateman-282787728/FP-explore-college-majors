8212573,4,B000UAE7JK,"I read the book and I was curious on  how the movie was going to out shine the book. It was pretty good the way they brought it all together.  I love the scene's of the beautiful old house and the ocean. It kept my interest and it was one of the better movies where they made one of Mary's books into a movie.  She is one of my favorite authors, I love mysteries..",1407542400,,364,3.891891891891892

8212575,5,B000UAE7JK,"I love Mary Higgins Clark books, and this movie version of Remember Me did not disappoint.  It is true to the book, and the acting is on target.  The scenery is beautiful, and it is a movie I will watch over again.  A light mystery that is very enjoyable!",1362960000,,255,4.163265306122449
8212576,4,B000UAE7JK,"Menley Nichols (Kelly McGillis) is driving home with her young son and is distracted by him when she enters a level crossing just as a train passes through. The boy is killed and Menley is hurt but more mentally traumatized. She recovers to some extent within a couple of years and gets on with her career as a writer. Her husband Adam (Cotter Smith) buys a large house for them to move into - a house where there has allegedly been a tragedy of a woman throwing herself off a balcony after the loss of a child - a singularly inappropriate location one would have thought! The estate agent, Elaine Archer (Shanna Reed) who sold Adam the house is an old flame and she makes her continuing interest in him quite obvious. Menley starts hearing voices and having bad dreams and soon is veering towards another mental breakdown. Adam is a lawyer and is currently defending Scott Covey (Michael T. Weiss) on a murder charge as Scott is being investigated by local lawman Chief Nat Coogan (Stephen McHattie). Coogan is convinced of Covey's guilt but Adam gets him temporarily released on a technicality. It's quite a well-made film like others in the series from novels by Mary Higgins Clark. The director here is Michael Switzer.",1360800000,2,1223,4.693023255813953
8212577,4,B000UAE7JK,Such a good old movie. Tried looking for it everywhere in stores and online and this was where I found it. The disk was brand new and it was just an amazing movie,1337126400,,162,3.9393939393939394
8212578,5,B000UAE7JK,"Although I've read a few of MHC's thrillers I never knew her novels had been turned into movies. Saw this at the library and had a hunch it'd be good based on the pics on cover. And I was right. Menley and her new baby and husband spend the summer in a creepy old house in Cape Cod and her life begins to unravel shortly after they move in. In spite of a few awkwardly acted scenes it held my interest and I was reluctant to pause for a bathroom break. Much more exciting with higher quality acting than ""Transformers"" or ""Inception."" Definitely worth your time and $$$",1334793600,,569,4.277777777777778
8212579,5,B000UAE7JK,just the best in packaging and postage.  no worries there at all.  the disc and movie were also very good.  don't know what else to say,1327968000,,135,4.115384615384615
8212580,4,B000UAE7JK,"I watched this movie for the first time recently and was pleasantly surprised at how well-acted and well-plotted it was. Based upon Mary Higgin's Clark's novel of the same name, Remember Me stars Kelly McGillis as Menly, a well-known author who has also suffered a tragic loss - the death of her 2 year old son in an accident that she blames herself for. She suffers intense post-traumatic stress disorder and after two years is just trying to put her life back together and start afresh with her supportive husband and baby daughter. Menly's husband rents a beautiful Victorian house called Remember House on the New England coast which has a reputation for being haunted and carries a tragic history.

As the family settles in, Menly finds herself experiencing hallucinations that has to do with the accident such as hearing her son's voice as well as seeing visions of a 'ghost'. Menly also finds that her husband had a fling with a former girlfriend the past summer, a woman named Elaine who also happens to be the realtor that obtained the house for them. There are quite a few twists in this movie and those who love a good thriller will appreciate the well-developed plot. The thriller has a 'supernatural' bent which makes it all the more enjoyable. Kelly McGillis truly shines as the grieving mother and confused wife who tries to solve the mystery of Remember House whilst hanging on to her sanity. All in all, highly recommended!",1216080000,15,1440,4.783132530120482
