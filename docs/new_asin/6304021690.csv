767663,4,6304021690,"This is the forgotten Douglas Sirk film from his golden period in the 1950's when he made such classic Baroque-style women's pictures as ""Magnificent Obsession"", ""All That Heaven Allows"", ""Written on the Wind"" and ""Imitation of Life"". The black-and-white 1958 film doesn't have the saturated color palette of Sirk's frequent cinematographer, Russell Metty (who did lens those other films), nor does the story, based on William Faulkner's novel ""Pylon"", have as strong an orientation toward a female protagonist as the others. Yet, the film has many of the filmmaker's trademark melodramatic flourishes and some superb shot compositions, this time photographed by Irving Glassberg. The result is quite worthwhile and sadly not available yet on DVD.

Set in 1932 New Orleans (though you can hardly tell from the anachronistic 1950's-era wardrobe and sets), the plot focuses on Roger Shumann, a former WWI flying ace who has been relegated to racing around pylons in air shows for prize money. He's married to LaVerne, so in love with Roger that she became a parachute jumper to please him, while raising their son Jack, who worships the ground on which Roger walks. Speaking of hero worship, there is also the dim-witted Jiggs, Roger's loyal mechanic, who holds a torch for LaVerne. Into this dysfunctional band comes local newspaperman Burke Devlin, who smells a good story in reporting on this transient family living hand to mouth to fulfill Roger's intractable need to fly. A lot of emotional gut-punches are thrown among these characters, especially between Roger and LaVerne, until a late moment of clarity seems to arrive too late. The last fifteen minutes contain come far-fetched plot convolutions, but they are in the spirit of the piece.

Sirk reunited three of his stars from 1956's ""Written on the Wind"" - Rock Hudson, Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone - to play the three principals, so they know how to maintain conviction with more than a touch of Sirk's often maddening soap opera excess. Hudson, in particular, really shines in this sort of material as Devlin, even in a hilariously conceived drunken speech at the end. Stack is his typical jaw-clenching self though with a morbid sense of self-loathing only Sirk could serve up, and Malone is surprisingly sensual as LaVerne, whether fighting off her impulses about Devlin or hanging on to a trapeze bar as she floats off her parachute with her skirt billowing up (a classic shot). Jack Carson plays Jiggs as the pathetically smitten man he is, while Christopher Olsen has a heartbreaking scene where he is stuck on an amusement park ride watching fate deal its hand (trivia - Olsen is Cindy Brady's real-life brother). This isn't an out-and-out great film but still a very watchable entry in the Sirk canon.",1160784000,10,2773,5.0524017467248905
767664,4,6304021690,"""Tarnished Angels"" must have been a huge surprise to its 1957 audience, who were used to Douglas Sirk's lavish melodramas in brilliant Technicolor, especially since it followed the '56 ""Written on the Wind"" with the same three stars. Based on Faulkner's ""Pylon"", it is the desperate story of a WWI ace pilot, now barnstorming across the country, trying to scratch out a living for himself and his wife and young son, and the journalist who wants to write a story about them. It has a Depression Era feeling throughout, and also goes back to Sirk's European roots, and has much more in common with Fellini's ""La Strada"" than with Sirk's better known Hollywood work, and some believe ""Tarnished Angels"" to be one of his finest films.

Rock Hudson as Burke, the journalist who is looking for a story and falls for the pilot's wife, gives his best dramatic performance, in what would be his last of many films for Sirk (Hudson was Sirk's favorite star). Robert Stack is superb as Roger, the tormented pilot, whose only true love is his airplane, and Dorothy Malone is fabulous as LaVerne, Roger's devoted wife. She has a sensuality that makes the story line of having numerous men in lust or love with her understandable, and among these men is Jiggs, the mechanical whiz who works on Roger's airplanes, and is well played by Jack Carson.

Others in the cast include Christopher Olsen, effective as young Jack, Robert Middleton as the unsavory Matt Ord, William Schallert as Ted, and briefly in some early scenes as a pilot, one can see Troy Donahue, who was to become a bobbysoxer heartthrob a year later with ""A Summer Place"". The b&w cinematography by Irving Glassberg is excellent, and the Frank Skinner score adds to the atmosphere. This is an unusual '50s film, and a must for Hudson fans. Total running time is 91 minutes.",1122336000,17,1825,4.753943217665615
767665,4,6304021690,"It is said that William Faulkner liked this film the best of all the cinematic adaptations of his work. It is also said that its star, Rock Hudson, disliked this picture. I do not know if either is true. All I know that it is a grim story, perfectly directed by Douglas Sirk, and that it contains one of Rock Hudson's finest acting performances.
I realize that ""Rock Hudson"" and ""fine actor"" are not often used in the same breath, but he was better than many would care to acknowledge, and in this film he shines. By itself, his impassioned, inebriated soliloquy near the movie's end is worth the price of admission. In fact, it was written for the film as a substitute for a literary device used by Faulkner in PYLON that would have translated awkwardly to the screen.
The rest of the cast is also impressive: Sirk has reunited Hudson with Dorothy Malone and Robert Stack, fresh from their Oscar caliber (award and nomination respectively) turns in WRITTEN ON THE WIND. While the lush soap opera of the earlier film has received more critical kudos for its shameless style, THE TARNISHED ANGELS tells a similar story in an altogether different way.
The film is not always appealing, but there is a compulsive magnetism to its pessimistic outlook that holds the viewer.
Perhaps THE TARNISHED ANGELS is simply a dramatic curiosity or an interesting period piece (parts of it can certainly seem dated), but it features some of Hudson's best work (despite what he might have felt about it) and it is far more personal and provocative than some of Sirk's other efforts.

767666,3,6304021690,"Rock Hudson stars as a hard drinking newspaper man who wants to do a story on stunt flyers at a show, but finds himself drawn into the world of one flyer in particular.  The flyer is played by Robert Stack, a war hero with ice in his veins, whose wife does parachute stunts, and whose son worships him.  Dorothy Malone is his wife, while Jack Carson is his mechanic who is in love with Malone.  Before long, even Hudson finds himself in love with Malone as well, and he is also fascinated by the couple's compelling story.  With everyone in love with Malone, things of course get complicated.  This is another heated film from director Douglas Sirk, featuring several of his actors from his overheated classic ""Written on the Wind"".  Everyone gives charged performances as would be expected, although I found Hudson's character a little difficult to understand.  Hudson is fine, but I think the character was not written well enough, although he has a number of grandstanding speeches.  Carson is quite good in his smaller role.  The film certainly isn't boring, since Sirk knows how to keep your attention with music, photography, and drama.  But like so many of Sirk's other films, subtle it isn't.  If you're in the right mood, you will enjoy it.",1005350400,8,1249,4.736111111111111

767808,5,6304021690,"This movie reunites the key players from one of my all-time favorite films Written On the Wind in somewhat similar roles - Robert Stack as a selfish husband, Dorothy Malone as a sexy siren, and Rock Hudson as the understanding guy with a tender edge & fondness for another man's wife.  The story is centered around New Orleans air showmen during Mardi Gras, and it was filmed in B&W, but it is highly melodramatic like the former film right down to the passionate musical score by Frank Skinner.  There are two more cast members from the first film here, Robert Wilke (the bartender, here a competing pilot), and the always recognizable William Schallert as a reporter in both films, well known to all for playing Patty Duke's father.  Though the ending could have been written better as a certain issue regarding Stack is left mysteriously unresolved, the movie holds your interest throughout with the great Faulkner dialogue and fine performances.",1395792000,2,949,4.91875
767809,5,6304021690,"Starring Rock Hudson, Robert Stack, Dorothy Malone, the Gypsy Moth airplane used in the movie was my uncle  Ed Clark's plane, they crashed it in the filming, it shows the actual crash, he aqquirred another plane soon afterwards",1381017600,2,227,4.973684210526316
767810,3,6304021690,"There are three main reasons to see THE TARNISHED ANGELS - Rock Hudson, Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone. This dynamic trio is at the height of their beauty and sexiness in THE TARNISHED ANGELS. I had never seen a young and muscular Robert Stack and it was a surprise. Malone is dripping with sexiness and Hudson sure could play the handsome lady's man. They are at the top of their game and ooze with youthful sexiness.

Unfortunately, there is not much more to praise about THE TARNISHES ANGELS. Laverne (Malone) is madly in love with her stunt pilot husband Roger Shumann(Stack) a WWI fighter-pilot hero. Shumann is cold and stark leaving Laverne unfufilled but in total awe of her husband. Along with their son Jack, they travel to air shows with their friend and mechanic Jiggs (a fine Jack Carson). At a show in New Orleans, newspaper reporter Burke Devlin (Rock Hudson) befriends the group in hopes of getting a great story.

The story loses steam quickly as this becomes more a film about three men and assorted other characters in love with the same beautiful woman. Beauty seems to have its price and Laverne learned that a long time ago. A romance brews between her and Devlin as she fights for her husband's love an attention. The film is dark in its story and in its setting. Many scenes are indoors in a dark apartment or in a dark airplane hangar. Obviously, director Douglas Sirk was trying to get a mood created here. It would have worked had the story been better and stronger. The plot is predictable and the lives of these people are hopeless. Nothing can seem to save any of them.

There are several character actors in THE TARNISHED ANGELS who I have seen in countless other films. It's fun to see these actors even if I don't know their names. A young Troy Donahue has a small role in the film. Malone, Hudson and Stack are great but the film is just too weak to be enjoyable.",1368662400,3,1898,4.543859649122807

767812,3,6304021690,HAVING WATCHED  THIS FILM I CAN NOW SEE WHEY IT HAS NOT BEEN OFFERED FOR REGION 1 VIEWERS.  Mostly poor acting and not a story that holds the viewers attention.  Not recommended.,1357084800,,178,4.5
767813,4,6304021690,"This black and white film is surprising. The action takes place in the early 1930s, prohibition still going on, but even so the film is strangely nostalgic of a time that has fully disappeared at the time the film was made. What makes Douglas Sirk so nostalgic about that past he was so fascinated by? Of course it is planes, and flying, and doing all kinds of silly things with these flying machines to dare the devil and to challenge death as if it were possible to challenge that devilish reaper. The second thing that attracts Sirk is the hero this pilot is, a war hero who has reformed himself and retrained himself into being a pilot for fun, a pilot to entertain crowds by taking risks and flying them in mid air, till one day the plane breaks down and the choice is between a simple crash on the funfair next door and a crash into the sea. That's the kind if choice that only dying people, people doomed to die can face and a hero is the one ... but you know the answer to that, and rare are those who can do the right thing at such a moment. The third thing that attracts Sirk is the little boy who follows his father the daredevil that flies planes for the fun of others and his mother, the flying acrobat in the air with no net, no string to catch her, just her know how and courage to do what is to be done not to crash on the ground when she loses - on purpose of course - her parachute. The next thing that attracts Sirk is that immeasurable love between these two persons and the devotion a third person, an outsider, a man from the side feels and makes him play the gallant man not to break that couple but to serve the woman in that final drama of hers and to help the child cope with death and death and death again. A beautiful film with the end of a woman who finds the proper footing she needs to be up to raising her son in a treacherous world but in the memory of his father the flying hero.

767814,4,6304021690,"Dorothy Malone could really look hot in her day.  Man, sometimes he outdid Marilyn Monroe for sex appeal......sometimes.  One instance might be here in this movie.

This film also had some fascinating and dramatic flying scenes, things I have never seen before on film. Apparently, they had these 1930s air races in which planes few around pylons, almost like a horse race on land. This is the only film I've seen that pictured.

Another thing I enjoyed was Rock Hudson's dramatic story at the end of the movie which, at first, seemed ridiculously melodramatic but was said so well that I found in very compelling, and it tied the whole story together.

****possible spoilers****  I also appreciated Malone doing the right thing at the end, telling off Hudson for coming on to her, since she was a married woman. This is one of the few films - including those in the 1950s - in which adultery is NOT treated mater-of-factly.",1243555200,4,924,4.74375

767816,5,6304021690,"Finally!  Tarnished Angels on DVD!  It's from Brazil, with both a Portugese box cover and DVD menu, but the film is presented in a gorgeous black and white widescreen Cinemascope transfer.  Excellent quality, not a bootleg.  My only question is why hasn't Universal released this in North America???  ...and what about Magnificient Obsession?

Original review was July 2008, Update May 23, 2011:
Well this film is now readily available in North America via a DVD-R series from TCM of Universal owned pictures.  I have not seen this new release, but hopefully they have a good print as the Brazilian DVD was very good and Universal has a good reputation of putting out fairly good quality restorations. This has been the case with both Magnificient Obsession through Criterion and also Sirk`s two pictures starring Barbara Stanwyck on a boxset devoted to her lesser known pictures.  While it is good to have Tarnished Angels finally available it is too bad that they don`t feel the market is strong enough to put out a more lavish release of this film, or at least another Rock Hudson boxset with this and his other action pictures with Sirk.",1215993600,8,1141,4.875647668393782

Well, it uses same of the character names from the novel and there are airplane races in both the novel and the movie but little else. The power of the novel was in the moral ambiguity of the characters. The movie hints that there is something there but never reveals any. The relationship between the Jiggs, the Shuman and the Laverne characters is hinted at but never revealed The question of the paternity of the boy is talked about but never explained.

The movie is pure 1950s melodrama and morality imposed upon the complexity of Faulkner's novel.

After Roger's air crash death, Jiggs absents himself from the commemoration party and chooses to sit all by himself, well removed from the others. He can't imagine himself in a normal, flaccid, routine life. He can't imagine adjusting to normality.  ""Where the hell are you Roger?"" to no one at all. [In desperation he repeats:  Where the hell are you???""]. Without Roger's mania to hold them together, listlessness is set to drown the remaining team in futility.  Though it's rather muted in the film, the time is 1924 and combat ace Roger Schumann who shot down nine German fighters needs to reinvoke the dangers of WW1 air combat in the skies of France.  He needs the threat of death to find a justification for living.  Thus his desperare addiction to barnstorming.  Malone and Carson are swept up in his deadly mania and live at his compulsive, fevered pitch, too.

In the final scene, Hudson holds forth poetically on Stack trying to leave the clutches of a safe, boring life and challenge daily death instead.

The prize money, as Malone, says is ""bird seed"".  And as the WW1 pilot hero observes, ""We've slept in the best hotels and worst hangers, so don't go feeling sorry for us.""  These are desperate people, otherwise normal, who build their lives around seeking out brushes with death and think of nothing else.",1428796800,,1601,4.82051282051282
