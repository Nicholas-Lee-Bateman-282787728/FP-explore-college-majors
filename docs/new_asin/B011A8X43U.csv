8723950,5,B011A8X43U,"If your child is doodling at the kitchen table and showing to you their amazing creation, this series is perfect. They've drawn a fish. A happy fish. You look, and you love it. You can see the joy within them and know full well that their creative imagination is strong. You race to the store and buy them crayons and colored pencils and drawing paper. You want their imagination and creativity to soar.

What more can you do to foster and further develop your child's creativity?

Great learning activities for children are not always easy to find, especially on those days when your child is alone for whatever reason. School is out. Camp ended at 3 and they were home by 4. It's two hours until dinner and... it's raining outside. The thought of having them watch mindless television is not on the table. And... you have stuff to do for about an hour.

You need an idea! Well, here's one...

Recently, a former Disney illustrator named Mark Marderosian created this series of programs that represent a wonderful answer to short, inexpensive activities that will not only cultivate creativity, but also take your child on a series of learning journeys to wonderful and enlightening places. The coupling of fun excursions with creative learning has earned the series two Emmy nominations, a Parents' Choice 'fun stuff' award, the seal of approval from the National Parenting Center, a Creative Child Magazine award and an official approval from Kids First! The Coalition for Quality Children's Media.

The filmed series is both live action and animated and consists of 13 30-minute episodes that take children to such places as a science museum, an aquarium, a farm, zoo and more. In each, the child is introduced to fun facts and phenomena and then, on a return trip to host Marderosian's illustration studio, he or she is taught how to draw some of the things they've seen.

Critics far and wide have praised DRAWING WITH MARK. Below are just a few examples of what is being said about this multi-award winning series for children ages 5-9.
