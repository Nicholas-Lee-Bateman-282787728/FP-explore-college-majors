8029155,1,B0002M5TR0,I thought this was a documentry but it's people being mean to people.  I've tossed it in the trash and hope nobody buys any more copies,1371513600,2,135,4.1923076923076925
8029156,1,B0002M5TR0,"I couldn't even watch all of this.  And I couldn't imagine what kind of sadistic white trash would enjoy this, let alone own it.

This is for the people who thought DELIVERANCE was a comedy.  This is not anything like the Jesco White story.

Watching these cackling hillbillies utterly torment what was left of their ""uncle"" was like watching some depressing preview of what Dante's Inferno would look like--if it was in some holler in Kentucky instead of the infernal realm.

I wondered what kind of life this man must have had to end up like this.  Was he ever a human being?  Was there someone in his family who cared for him?  According to a website, he's dead now.  After watching his ""family"" mercilessly spraypaint his face, wrap his head in tape and pull it off, light him on fire several times and also brutally punch him in the genitals, he's obviously better off someplace else.  I hope.

Maybe there was some explanation as to why he deserved such wretched treatment in the film but I couldn't finish it.  I could barely stand watching what I saw.

To be trashed all the time, reduced to muttering curses and uselessly flailing at your tormentors, your brain dead and your soul gone: this is what damnation looks like.

Enjoy yourselves.",1202083200,10,1249,4.6438356164383565
8029157,1,B0002M5TR0,"I eagerly rented Uncle Goddamn after hearing all the hype.  Sadly disappointing stuff.  It's mildly amusing for about 10 minutes, but the quality is so poor it's sometimes hard to see or hear what's going on,  and you can only watch stupid rednecks set this poor drunken guy's crotch on fire so many times before it becomes really boring. Buy it at your own risk, and be prepared to fast forward through huge chunks of the boring sections.  If this is the kind of humor you're into, I'd recommend Jackass or even Tom Green. They're both funnier, the pranks are more diverse, and they're both of good audio & visual quality. ;-)  Or better yet, go visit your drunken neighbors in the trailer park down the street and tape THEM.  Probably more entertaining.",1197331200,6,755,4.639097744360902
8029158,5,B0002M5TR0,"Pee your pants funny. You will howl with laughter at this white trash endless party. Fans of classics such as ""Jesco The Dancing Outlaw"" and ""Heavy Metal Parking Lot"" will leap with joy upon the discovery of this trailer treasure.  The down side is these people also make up a big red chunk of George W's support base. Great, glaring, stumbling, drinking disasters, toothless tough guys and even Kiss's Gene Simmons as a trailer trash personal trainer. Goddamn! Goddamn, gentlemen, warm up your spray cans! Get this now! Goddamn!",1144886400,6,529,4.943820224719101
8029159,3,B0002M5TR0,"A look into the home of a white trash hillbilly family taken sometime in the mid 1980's. Most of the video contains clips of practicle jokes a family plays on their slobbenly drunk uncle, ""Uncle Goddamn"". Jokes like lighting his crotch on fire and taping his head up. Some of it is cruel and hilarious, almost to the point that you feel bad laughing at it. Especially funny are the extra clips of the other drunk members of the family like ""Pappy"". If you like Jackass, here is their inspiration!",1111104000,4,496,4.522222222222222
