8723793,5,B0118DSHH0,"This incredible cult classic has been sadly MIA on home video.  This 2014 Australian release is probably as close as we'll come in terms of physical media.  It's a Region 4 PAL DVD, so if you purchase the Umbrella DVD version, make sure your player is multi-region is region-free.

The film appears to be from a 16mm print and is presented in full-screen (cropped, not open matte). The color is excellent and the print is uncut.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this release.  As I stated earlier, I wouldn't expect to see a U.S. release of this movie (there are a bunch of songs in this film which have probably held up it's release here).  There is no menu.  The movie plays immediately after the company logo and ends with the DVD authoring credits.  Chapters stops are random and there are ten of them.

No need to recap the plot; it's been done more thoroughly and cleverly on other websites.  Just thought I'd give some tech specs for those who may be sitting on the fence.  If you want a copy of this rarity, but this one if you have the ability to play it!",1471392000,2,1065,4.410256410256411
