6019924,3,B00FPWWCCC,"Okay, let's be honest here.  There aren't really 20 movies here.  There are 16.  Two movies are multipart miniseries.  Should they count as a separate movie each?  No.  Also, I'm older.  (And likely part of the target audience since we Boomers were the ones to really understand science fiction.)  There are no subtitles.  That's a serious faux pas in my book.  I need them.  There's a lot of conversation I cannot hear.

The movie transfers are fair. Some of it is washed out looking.  The audio's good.  The selection is mediocre.  You're not going to find ""prime time"" Sci-Fi flicks here.  But you likely will find something, or several somethings, that you've not seen before.  Because of that, that's why it gets 3* instead of two.",1482969600,8,736,4.714285714285714

Some of them are pretty awesome and scary and leave us hanging at the edge of our seats but,  I have to say that some of these are quite ridiculously corny. We have fun making fun of a lot of them though so we don't mind at all. The quality of most of these pictures is awful but for 20 films for five dollars that's fine with us.

6019977,4,B00FPWWCCC,"Being a collector, I already owned all the films in this set except for the Invasion and HG Wells miniseries and the flic called ""They"".  The disc containing the two miniseries played fine, as did the disc containing ""They"" - which is an odd film which attracts your attention as a sort of slow-moving cinematic train wreck.  It is so obscure that I could not locate it on IMDB. The collection contains some gems among its B-movie chaff, notably Vincent Price's ""Last Man on Earth"", ""Counterblast"", and ""This is Not a Test"".  And if you find B-movie chaff amusing, as I often do, most of the chaff in this collection is not half bad.  Given the quantity and quality of this collection, I consider it a bargain.  I also appreciate that the Mill Creek case displays minature versions of the cover art for each movie.",1439078400,11,814,4.586206896551724

I won't try to rate all the movies as most people who get this probably have seen them and are after a nostalgic experience. I will say there were a few I had not seen, like 'The Infinite World Of HG Wells' . I had not seen this and was happily surprised.

6020003,2,B00FPWWCCC,"The only 3 good movies:

""The Last Man on Earth"" starring Vincent Price is a great movie.  It is haunting, gritty, and could probably be considered a classic. It is similar to the ""Omega Man"" with Charleton Heston, only it was made about a decade earlier, it's black and white, and it's better than the Heston film.  Moreover, it's a good example of a film that doesn't rely on gimmicks like special effects, creatures, costumes, spaceships, or other things needed to compensate for a lousy story. The acting and plot are front and center here. Vincent Price totally carries this movie. The result is a highly watchable film even by today's standards.

""End of the World"" starring Christopher Lee (Count Dooku from Star Wars; Man With the Golden Gun)is the second of three good movies. I would rate it three stars. However, compared to the other terrible films on this set it's nearly Shakespeare. Truly a weird, creepy movie. Another example of a good movie on a small budget.

""Invasion""  starring Luke Perry. This has the feel of a made-for-TV movie, but it's pretty good nonetheless. The acting here seems almost like Shakespeare compared to the rest of the junk on this collection.  I would rate it 3 and a half stars. Good special effects, interesting story, well acted, and suspenseful.

Now the Remaining 17 Bombs:

There are a number of absolutely terrible, and I mean terrible, Italian movies on here. Some are probably contenders for WORST FILMS EVER MADE. I'm not kidding either.

""Star Odyssey"" and ""War of the Robots"" are two unbelievably bad Italian flicks. Imagine Star Wars made for 50 bucks. Even worse than the ""The Creeping Terror"", which I thought was better, but which is widely considered one of the worst films of all time.

Another Italian piece of junk is ""Warriors of the Wasteland."" Now, this movie is probably the only funny movie on the set. And not intentionally funny either. Between the music (which is the cheesiest 80's crap ever) or the funny haircuts, or the white get-ups the bad guys wear, or the cars with bubbles, I can't decide what is more stupid. Maybe the beginning which looks like somebody filmed a shoebox and called it a city. Bad, but in a curious way that draws you into it's suckiness.

There are several black and white movies here that are absolutely terrible. They are BORING! They all seem to blur together. Here's the plot. Bunch of scientists sit around in their rocket control centers, surrounded by ""cool"" looking gizmos and dials from the 1950's, and they ooh and awe as a rocket launches into space. The stories suck, the acting sucks, the music sucks, everything about them sucks. Avoid the following movies, ""The Day the Sky Exploded,"" ""Battle of the Worlds,"" ""CounterBlast,"" ""This is not a test."" Abysmal. All of them.

""They"" is a completely worthless movie. A group of people in a cabin the woods, something about aliens, but I didn't see any while fast-forwarding through this dreck. The picture looked liked the most washed-out fuzzy VHS tape you've ever seen.

""Alien Species"" is a more modern (1990's) film. It's decent, for a bad movie that is. Better than all the black and white 50's movies, but that ain't saying much.

""The Doomsday Machine"" is the most interesting terrible movie here. It's about a manned-mission to Venus in 1972. The writers of this film must not have been aware that Venus is hot enough to melt lead. The entire feel and look of this movie is like something out of the 1950's, but it's 1972. Hard to believe that something this terrible and hokey could be made after 2001: A Space Odyssey. I mean, why try? Why bother making something that looks like this in the year 1972. It's mind boggling how out of date, and behind the times this movie seems. The ending was tacked on and meaningless... 3 minutes of looking at a starfield. Wow.

The rest are too mediocre to mention.",1406246400,27,3870,4.736607142857143
6020004,5,B00FPWWCCC,"What can one say about getting 20 movies for a low price? Not much really.  The only way it could get better is if you got them for free.  But a low price is the next best thing.  This 20 movie pack of low budget Sci-Fi Films is put out by Mill Creek Entertainment.  While there is some overlap between what I already have from them in other editions, there are quite a few movies on this edition that I don't have that made this a worthwhile buy for me.
  And Mill Creek Entertainment is consistantly putting out new multi-pack editions with different movies and/or new movies to suit me.  The great part of this particular edition, is that this includes newer B-Rate/Low Budget movies than other editions.  And I really enjoy having multi-pack around.  And I love the price almost as much as I enjoy the B-Rate Sci-Fi Films",1401235200,3,825,4.446666666666666
6020005,3,B00FPWWCCC,"As this title seems identical to the other 20 sci fi movie set -They Came From Space - I'll post my review for that here aswell:

""20 movies for $10 ( when it was actually available). They say ""If it sounds too good to be true it probably is"" and this release proves it . With 5 movies on a standard dual layer disc you have to expect quality compromises. I purchased for the HG Wells 3 parter and while it shows pixellation and noise that you would expect from a disc with 5 movies on it the quality is acceptable and the Invasion 2 parter is similar. Disc 2 is another story. Alien Contamination may be one of the better known movies on this release but if you're buying to see it then get the proper dvd from Blue Underground or others. Mill Creek could have used the same video master that was used for the 80's VHS release and it would have been better than what they've delivered which is clearly a direct transfer from a VHS tape . That's right - this is a dvd that is still VHS quality . The rest of Disc 2 is almost as disappointing so I've not ventured to the other 2 discs yet . Some of the films on this set have had releases elsewhere and of infinitely superior quality so you'd be advised to look for those . I don't know of any other dvd release for the ones I was interested in so I'm stuck with it . I actually expected 5 discs which would have been bad enough but 4 discs ? Mill Creek seem to aim their releases at the market who buy because its cheap then throw it away when they realise the quality is rubbish rather than people who buy because they actually want to see the films on the discs . This might keep the kids quiet but discerning customers won't be very happy . Good value ? Definitely . Good quality ? Not even close .""

Are there really people pretending to be film fans who won't watch B&W films ? Incredible - but it's their loss I guess.",1389744000,50,1874,4.1035422343324255
