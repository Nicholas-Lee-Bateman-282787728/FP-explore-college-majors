6779751,5,B00OZOIEVY,Hands down the best documentary I have ever seen and I have seen quite a few. It touches on so many different subjects and is very thoughtfully put together. Highly (No pun intended) recommend to anyone searching for truth.,1423526400,4,223,4.743589743589744
6779752,5,B00OZOIEVY,"I saw this doc in its theatrical run. It is packed with information about all sides of this controversial subject. Interviews are from high level academics, former police chiefs, billionaire entrepreneurs, parents of sick kids, and of course, Joe Rogan and Snoop Dogg. The pace moves along enough to keep it from getting boring, and it's not just a hippy diatribe on legalization, it's a well informed researched presentation.",1421193600,10,426,5.188405797101449
6779753,5,B00OZOIEVY,EVERYONE SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO WATCH THIS EXCELLENT DOCUMENTARY!!,1440633600,,65,6.333333333333333
6779754,5,B00OZOIEVY,"This book is more an indictment of American culture than a manifesto about pot, though pot is the vehicle for addressing certain deficiencies in how (we allow) things to be. This should be required viewing for everyone. After you view it, you'll may want to become an activist for some kind of change in our society. Whether it's legalization of pot or something else completely, don't be surprised if you feel energized to organize.",1440028800,,433,4.864864864864865
6779755,5,B00OZOIEVY,"Not as good and informative as his first documentary, but still very enjoyable and useful information. Plus the added benefit of having Joe Rogan as a host makes this a must watch.",1438473600,,180,4.65625
6779756,5,B00OZOIEVY,"It purports to be about marijuana use in the U.S., but is really about what is wrong in our country and how we can go about creating culture change that can get us back on the right track. It starts with believing science, establishing facts, and acting accordingly, together. Best movie I've seen in a long time.",1437350400,,313,4.508771929824562
6779757,5,B00OZOIEVY,"A great documentary with a humanitarian leaning. The suffering that has been caused by removing this medicinal (and sacramental) herb from the U.S. and much of the world market is gut-wrenching and infuriating to watch. The militarization of the U.S. police forces is an alarming result of banning this helpful herb with a perfect track record of safety. The fact that DEA and many police officers use it themselves, reveals a source of corruption of the American public-servant's soul.

This is a very important and fair documentary revealing the source of many of the social problems our society faces every day. Even those who choose not to partake, need to see the damage the War on (Some) Drugs has done to our society and to many other countries of the world where we have exerted our policies by threat and bribe.

Marijuana is not for everyone, but I believe everyone needs to see the real-life footage of the state violence that is done in the name of ""protecting us"" from this harmless -- and potentially, very helpful -- plant. Go see it or buy it and invite friends over to watch it.

Richard Branson, billionaire founder of the Virgin conglomerate had the courage to speak up, as did many others -- not just Joe ""F-Bomb"" Rogan.",1437091200,,1240,4.731481481481482

6779759,5,B00OZOIEVY,"This is the best documentary to come out yet to date.  It certainly puts things into a different, and better point of view.  I'm all for legalizing MJ for medical purposes nationwide, and immediate removal from Schedule 1 drug, to a 2 or 3 even.  Xanax is far more troublesome than MJ, and it kills people all the time.  Gobs of ER visits about Benzo's, or mixing Benzo's with alcohol (I don't drink myself).  But yet Xanax while being clearly the most addictive and abused Benzo, remaining in Schedule 4 status.  I currently take 3 does a day of 5mg Valium.  It took me 7 years to get off the Xanax.  I can and have many times went from a heavy MJ user, to cold turkey.  Your (in my case) a bit of psychological withdrawal for 2-3 days, and its over.  Less addicting than caffeine.  And certainly nicotine.
This clearly points out what is happening on both sides, the folks who NEED to watch this show, and how ignorant so many people about 10 to 15 years older than me, do not know or realize.  I'm 56.  There has been long periods of my life in which I had no need for MJ.  But as I age, it helps out for many things than when younger.
Especially good is when they film them drilling the DEA and Justice Department in Congress on this and more drug war issues.  And, the fact that it has all been political since Nixon, something even I did not realize.
I have already been caught, arrested, and convicted of manufacturing MJ inside my home.  With the size of my growing area, I could not grow enough, for my own needs, yet I was charged with ""for re-sale"" also.  I grew up on a farm, have been proficient with guns and safety of them since age 9.  I had a few guns, and a nice .45 Kimber 1911 series pistol.  So, they charged me with having firearms in the production of MJ, and took away my gun rights.  Charged with maintaining a dwelling where drugs are either used or sold (NEVER sold any), but shared a bit, and then stupidly picked a guy who I should of never let know, who got into some kind of trouble, and turned me in to help himself out.  I can no longer risk growing again, as on a second offense in my state, I'd be going to jail for 3-6 years.
My advice, if you do grow indoors, do not tell anyone.  Not even your best friend.  And never share any, it should be your secret!
I had to hire the best attorney I could get, and that cost me 10k.  They set my bail at 20k, so I had to pay 2k to get out of jail that evening.

They really messed up my house.  I answered their questions.  They busted my front door open as I was asleep on the couch, right near the door.  Grabbed me and threw me down, handcuffed me behind my back.  They had vests and all on, like they expected a ""gun battle"" over a few MJ plants LOL (CRAZY)  When I was taken out, there was 5 cruisers in my driveway.  Talk about overkill.  And, they went thru every drawer, cabinet, you name it, in the house and left it all messed up.  I had my Dad's WW2 Foot Locker all nicely packed, and they messed all that up.  Also, they took my entire computer system, not just the tower.  Keyboard/mouse, speakers, photo quality printer.  They also took a Nikon Coolpix 995 that was worth at least 500 bucks.  I had 20 bucks in my wallet, and they took that and gave me my wallet back.

It cost me 1100 to replace my complete system, but got an all in one printer/copy/fax one.  I need a new photo printer still.  Ended up, I was fined 4,450 bucks, and given 2 years of (not parole) but (corrective services) which I was drug tested randomly.  Got off that over 9 months early for passing them all and doing well.  So in all total, it cost me around 17k.  Well, as this show points out, the counties love this.  It brings in a lot of easy money for them, encouraging them to continue.
About 1 year after I was busted, the prosecutor was busted for offering females lighter sentences for sexual favors, the 2nd time he had been caught in 8 years.  This time, they took away his Bar license.  Then just a couple months later, the detective who had served the search warrant on me, was busted for stealing pills from the evidence room.  He took 500 Oxycodone 10mg pills, and 600 Methadone pills.  They had just built a new jail, and they didn't tell folks who had access to it that a video camera was in use.  Now, he is in jail or prison one.  And then, about a year ago, they busted my attorney, doing the same thing as the prosecutor had been doing, offering to get them off lighter for sexual favors.  Well, he was heavily reprimanded.  One more for him, and he will lose his license also.
So, you see just how corrupted it is here, and I'm sure statewide, and many other states.  I have chronic and severe PTSD, Severe and Chronic Anxiety Disorder, OCD, Major Depressive Disorder, and others.  But the proper use of MJ as medication, it treats all those issues very well.

I never did get back any of my stuff.  I wasn't even allowed to go down, and copy my documents, and pics, and my music from my hard drive.  I think that detective who was busted, stayed here after everyone else was gone, and then took my computer system in full, and the camera.  And likely sold them.  Who knows how many years he has been taking stuff from the evidence room.
This show also explains it from a world view, and goes into details about the cartels, how 60% of their income is from their TRASHY MJ.  It is called ""brick weed"" of ""skag"" on the black market, and it is terrible.  Take away their weed, then if busted for hard drugs, ie. Heroin and Methamphetamine, lock them up for good.  Make the punishment for those hard drugs much harsher than it is now.  And Quit ruining these 17-23 year old's life's.  First thing on a job application, have you ever been convicted of a felony.
Now, I just get very small amounts, and only have 1 pipe.

I would recommend this show to anyone, and esp. to folks who have never tried the drug, and are die hard prohibitionists!  You have so much to learn.",1433462400,4,5954,4.23932384341637

8685776,5,B00OZOIEVY,"I think it is sad to have to say this to validate my opinion, but I
will say right up front that I do not smoke marijuana. Despite that, I
believe it is CRITICAL for every thinking American to watch this film.
It is an excellent expose of our current drug policies, criminal
system, medical system, pharmaceutical system, legal system and last
but certainly not least it lays open our political system. Please watch
it, please share it. Knowledge is power. Overlook the characters and
strong language and listen to what is being said. It is important
information that needs to be disseminated throughout our country and it's people. This documentary is successful in in showing the hypocrisy and illogicality of our nations drug policies and specifically the prohibition of cannabis (marijuana). Take off your blinders and expand beyond your current mindset and allow yourself to listen, this film may just enlighten you to think a little differently. Don't be afraid to open yourself to information that may be contrary to what you've been led to believe, because you have been led. Think for yourself and make up your own mind.",1456531200,,1129,4.9162303664921465

8685778,5,B00OZOIEVY,"Truth about drug prohibition and the nasty , horrendous results of drugs being illegal.
People who might benefit from this enlightening info will not watch it and if they do will block out any notion of making drugs legal.
We know that many people are hard-headed and the results of the ignorance are often negative and evil.
Many children have gone to prison for drugs, and might have stolen in order to ""get more crack"".
They started with alcohol and went quickly to pot. It is a gateway thing, but of course, as this program illustrates, ""prison and simple marijuana use should not be connected.""
This is an excellent documentary, maybe a little too tilted towards unconditional acceptance of marijuana, but I am one who believes people should not ever be arrested for simple use of a substance like marijuana.
I am a ""conservative"", only because liberals have sold out to an evil Democrat party selling indulgences, but I really cannot abide the hypocrisy and basic illogic of the prohibition on drugs. The reasons alcohol was made legal again after prohibition apply to pot as well.
People need to get back to a reasonable respect for God and one another. We need not try to be like animals with faith only in scientists and the indulgent.
Pot can mess up a person's life.
So can a fool, little child, or senile adult behind the wheel of a vehicle.
How could anyone honestly support a person for President who was responsible for the wrongful deaths of Americans in Benghazi and since then has only lied about it,.??
Why would anyone in their right mind vote not only once but twice for a man who hates the country he is ruling?
Seems that ""The Beast"" is having its way. (See the Apocalypse of John). Chaos, Godlessness, and the worship of man for himself.",1447372800,,1761,4.665594855305466
