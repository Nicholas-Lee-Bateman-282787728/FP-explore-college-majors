7814600,5,6301723759,"This charmingly crafted story, though condensed for television, still retains the charm of the original text. The story features a wacky cast of characters that will delight, intrigue and often puzzle you. The songs and mise-en-scene are par for the period but enjoyable, nonetheless. I first saw this as a boy in the 1950's and even after watching it today, its sweet charm and innocence remain.
A classic.",1460764800,3,407,5.0

7814602,5,6301723759,"Shirley Temple's Storybook Theatre had a short two-season life at the end of the fifties but it was way ahead of its time (a clear forerunner of Shelly Duvall's star-studded series decades later). Both in the multi-racial casting and the marvelous adaptation by the author (Noel Langley of 'The Wizard of Oz' screenplay fame), this television version of the lovely book of the same name is still enchanting after all these years.

I first saw this as a very little boy, watching the show on a Sunday night and remembering the happy songs and the comedy years and years later.
The book is a great read-aloud (get the 1966 edition in Puffin Books) and, although greatly abridged for the one-hour series, Langley carefully adapted his gem of a story, keeping all the over-the-top formal language, the very silly and physical slapstick and the overall thrilling quality of the original tale.

Aladdin's son, Abu-Ali, is the hero in search of his own adventure. With the aid of Abdul, the original genie of the lamp, and a surprise appearance of _Abdul's_ son (with the outrageous name of Boomalaaka Wee), Abu-Ali gets much more than he bargained for. There are wicked princes, an over-sized mouse, a wise-acre dragon, the princess Silver Bud, a flying carpet (with a weight limit!) and, best of all, the marvelous flying Land of Green Ginger of the title.

It remains as engaging and striking today as ever, even in its grainy, vhs format (let's hope for a dvd upgrade). As proof, my son (12) and daughter (7) enjoy it at least as much as I did and still do.

It is a treasure. The others in this series are all well worth the investment. The second season is now available on dvd and in color. Part of the thrill of this show was seeing what kind of gown the adult Ms. Temple would wear for that week. She sings the show's unforgettable lullaby at the outset of each episode. The series was produced in a different time yet its magic retains all of its burnished strength and charm.

Happy watching and reading, in either order.",1180569600,15,2025,4.661064425770308

quite as funny as the Beef Project,

et, al. The others, but still enough

humour in it to warrent a look, if

you are a Red Green fan.",1149638400,,172,3.6944444444444446
