7921623,5,B00004RYVD,"The German sci-fi-series (7 episodes) about the crew on Raumschiff (spaceship) Orion was sent on TV the same week in 1966 as Star Trek was introduced. We all know how this went. But to a large number of Europeans, Orion was the first encounter with science fiction. Hopelessly outdated today, but groundbreaking, nerve-wrecking and with a glimpse of the future at that time. Even today, a lot of details are fascinating modern. Black and white of course, this was longbefore color-TV. The actors speak German, and there are no subtitles - so you need to speak that language, because most of the action takes place as a dialog. This is a real cult-series, in a world where there are no nations, only mankind, and where the crew on Orion saves the Earth more than one time. It is just at good today, as it was back then.",1287273600,,818,4.571428571428571

7921625,5,B00004RYVD,"I find it hard to believe this show escaped my notice (and, in fact, the notice of most of the anglosphere) for as long as it did. Do you enjoy the original ""Star Trek?"" Do you like the original black and white ""Outer Limits"" program? Have you ever listened to Kraftwerk? If you answer yes to any of these things, Raumpatrouille Orion is something which must be seen to be believed. It was done at around the same time as Star Trek; a time of world wide fascination with space travel, due to the triumphs of the american space program (led, needless to say, by Wernher von Braun).

The first time I watched it I thought to myself, ""oh, a German Star Trek, how cute!"" The parallels are huge; the ship is piloted by an Anglo (Cliff Allister McLane), with a Japanese navigator (Atan Shubashi), and a Russian officer (Tamara Jagellovsk). Mr. Scott is a swede in this show, and Uhura is French, but the whole multicultural federation idea is there, even though they speak german (think about that for a minute). There was even a sort of ""space, the final frontier""  voice over at the beginning. The funny thing is, this show aired only a few days after the first Star Trek show, so I'm guessing they didn't actually influence each other. They just fed off of the hopeful zeitgeist of the mid-1960s.

People make fun of the space ship set being made of ordinary industrial design objects, but, in fact, I found the sets to be among the most beautiful and evocative of any science fiction program, ever. They're artistic creations in themselves, and are certainly superior to the Enterprise set, which looked like the inside of a Howard Johnsons hotel. Similarly, the special effects are pretty well done for the era. Most special effects are cheesy, even today. This must have been spectacular stuff in those days. The repartee between the characters is very well developed: as charming as Star Trek, though ... very german indeed. The space travel is interesting, the wars with the ""Frogs"" exciting, and the hip 60s psychedelic disco dancing scenes at the end of every episode underneath the giant fishbowl .... veyl Deiter, now is the time on Schprockets vhen ve dance!

Only seven episodes were made, yet it apparently retains a european cult following, with numerous conventions and add-on books associated with it. It is a shame this is only periodically available in the US in DVD form; it has much to offer American science fiction fans.",1187136000,16,2438,4.715962441314554
