4518220,1,B0050UEVFU,"I would say stick to S1 and S2, that's the original Torchwood, the show that deserves being called a ""cult show"". S3 was not written for the show in the first place and this gives it a very weird feeling. The characters act totally out of character. And there are plot holes big enough to drive fly an A380 through. Pretty sure they will come cheaper without S3, too, really not worth the extra money.",1309824000,27,401,4.36
4518221,5,B0050UEVFU,"Seriously, what is wrong with you people. Children of Earth brings the series to new heights and is simply amazing television. Here's how it goes: Season 1 was alright, but not special. Season 2 was good, and became even greater as it went. Season 3 (the mini series Children of Earth) is absolutely awesome and the best the series offers.

Now Season 4 (Miracle Day) is starting on July 8... so I don't know why you'd want to buy a ""complete set"" of something that is not over, but oh well.

Torchwood, the series itself, gets a 5/5.",1308268800,19,534,4.438775510204081
4518222,5,B0050UEVFU,"Torchwood gets progressively better until the epic ""Children of Earth"".  The show takes more risks than any HBO series and delivers. Can't wait to own this edition on Blu Ray.",1307664000,6,175,4.833333333333333
4518223,5,B0050UEVFU,"My copy just arrived, and the presentation of the set is nicely done. The disc case is done up like a bound book. The 'pages' inside include full color screen shots on the sleeves, generally from an episode present on that particular disc, but not always so. Each sleeve holds a disk as well as a list of the episodes or content on the disc and which writer or cast member is doing the audio commentary. The BBC did a really nice job on this set.  The first series has commentary on every episode, but there are none on the second series episodes, so I was a little disappointed.  The Torchwood Declassified insider peeks and interviews are available for both series 1 and 2 however, as well as outtakes and deleted scenes.  The commentary and Declassifieds add snippets of backstory that were lost in the deleted scenes.

Torchwood is a spin-off series of the legendary Doctor Who, focusing instead on the adventures of a former companion of the Doctor, a time traveler from the future, Captain Jack Harkness. Captain Jack is a walking anachronism, born in the 51st century, dressed like the middle of the 20th, and living in the 21st. Jack also has a little problem - he can't die. A handy feature in the dangerous profession of leading a semi-secret organization (The Torchwood Institute) and taking on the responsibility of guarding the Earth from the effects of a huge rift in the space-time continuum that runs through Cardiff, Wales. But as the years pass, it becomes obvious that Jack often looks on immortality as a curse. He's outlived just about everyone he's ever known or loved. He sends his friends into danger knowing that they can be killed by things he can walk away from. So he does the only thing he can do: Live out loud, and try to make a difference.

The show is at times lighthearted and laugh out loud funny, but the topics and subplots are more adult in nature than those found in the majority of Doctor Who. The willingness to embrace the humor and occasional camp is needed though. When you take a break and wander into the kitchen between episodes to get a glass of water it'll occur to you that most of the episodes are rather grim stuff, and the show attempts not to get crushed under that weight. Like his friend The Doctor, Jack finds himself in the position of having to be the one who has to make crappy decisions in which the team often disagree with, where no one is the hero, the ending isn't always happy, and it's a matter of choice between the lesser of two (w)evils. Because he has knowledge of future events, and a certain amount of shame regarding his own very long history, he doesn't share some info with his team and the resulting friction is a major plot point in several episodes.

Torchwood is still very much an ensemble cast, and episodes will tend to focus on certain characters and their relationships to each other in a stressful job. Several stories are viewed from Gwen's perspective as an ""Everyman"" due to her newbie status on the team shaking up the business as usual routine. By maintaining 'normal' relationships outside of Torchwood, Cardiff her perspective challenges Jack to retain his humanity, a theme often seen in the parent series' Doctor Who and his companions. By no means does this indicate that the other team members are lacking in humanity - they triumph, make mistakes, get it totally wrong, or utterly right and are in the fight they signed up for. Owen is cynical, pragmatic and often a jerk with flashes of gold underneath, but their resident medic. Toshiko is the stereotypical quiet, shy computer whiz, but with definite personality of her own. Ianto is a gem of understated dry humor and wit, and hidden facets and provides a delightful contrast to Jack's larger than life personality. Rhys, Gwen's often bewildered boyfriend (""Aliens? In Cardiff?!?"") is also a gem and the show skirts sucking him into the weirdness of Torchwood while keeping him (and therefore Gwen) anchored in the real world.

The three series (seasons to us Yanks) are short; American seasons are 22 - 23 episodes long, whereas Torchwood runs 13 episodes in a series, with the exception of Series 3, which was the 5 episode miniseries Children of Earth. There is much muttering about CoE among fans because the feel and events differ sharply from the previous seasons, and without giving away many spoilers, contains a series of short, sharp shocks to viewers. I didn't watch Torchwood or read anything about it until I spent a week viewing all the episodes back to back.  I think that not spending three years as a fan gave me a little different perspective on the events of CoE. I love Torchwood, in spite of it's flaws. Characters sometimes acting outside of normal behavior, as many plot holes as twists, editing issues (really, how many bodies DO they keep in morgue drawer #6?), and an apparently endless stream of Welsh extras dying whenever something dangerous comes through the rift.  CoE tightened up on the writing, editing, themes and acting, making it a more seasoned Torchwood with a darker plot that acknowledged the outside world having a stake in the strange events that effect the Torchwood version of the world.

So if you're still upright after the end of Season 2, brace yourself, but go on and watch Children of Earth. It has the kind of darker grittiness that is similar to the Battlestar Galactica 'reboot'. Lest fans forget, this is the universe in which everyone in Torchwood, London *dies*, The Master condemns the last humans at the end of the universe to tortured existence as cyborg bots, and Abbadon wipes out hundreds in Cardiff when he walks the Earth. Torchwood, Cardiff keeps most of their former employees in their own morgue.

Now, let me annoy the fan-shippers on both sides a little bit as I end by noting the ongoing Gwen-Jack-Ianto issue. Captain Jack, who finds 21st century labels of sexuality 'quaint', would make Captain Kirk appear positively Victorian and prudish in comparison. It's established early on that his affection for Gwen is beyond casual yet mutual on a certain level, but kept at bay by his respect for her pre-existing relationship with Rhys and the fact that Jack is never going to be normal. He instead eventually starts a casual relationship with Ianto which develops over the series as Ianto himself grows as a character. Jack-Ianto become more established when Gwen withdraws to become more established with Rhys, but I was always left with the sense that while Ianto loves Jack, Captain Jack is not fully committed emotionally to Ianto. But when he's already outlived at least one wife and eventually everyone he's ever loved, you wonder how emotionally committed Jack can truly get and not be damaged.  The relationships only make you more interested in the characters, even the minor re-occurring ones (Martha, Andy, etc)

It's a thought provoking series, no doubt, and in spite of it's flaws will appeal to fans of Battlestar Galactica, Doctor Who, the Buffy-verse, Firefly and other dramedy science fiction.",1307404800,110,7032,4.792079207920792
4518224,2,B0050UEVFU,"as much as i loved the first two seasons of torchwood i had to give this dvd a low rank because of coe. i fell in love with torchwood despite the plotholes campy writing because of the characters. i love jack/ianto/tosh/owen/ myfanwy wanted to see more of swanson (hoped they would hire her) and andy. gwen i thought was boring and mary sueish to the extreme. coe was a 3rd rate political 'drama' in which the three remaining characters seemed to be acting as guest stars in their own show. the plot of coe was that the government feared torchwood despite the fact that couldn't secure their own car. if you have any doubts watch the first 2 seasons of torchwood and then compare coe. save your money and buy own the first 2 seasons. amazon i believe has them on the video feed.
so i ask will there a season of three of torchwood because of coe was not the torchwood i loved.

4518225,2,B0050UEVFU,"If you look on amazon and other sites, ""Childen of Earth"" is not a big seller and is often discounted far more than the first two series of Torchwood.  I have a feeling they are just trying to get rid of their CoE sets by packaging them with the series that do sell.
Series one and two are the best and Children of Earth (series three) is really terrible and a complete departure from what came before.  I recommend you just buying the first 2 series and not this or Children of Earth.
I would give series one 3 stars, series two 4 stars and CoE 1 star.",1306886400,30,553,4.111111111111111
4518226,1,B0050UEVFU,"Torchwood starts out as a refreshing, unique series and gradually goes downhill from there.  Buy series 1 and 2 and skip Children of Earth all together.  It's not Torchwood, it's not even entertaining, it's dreadful plotting and writing.  The holes in the COE plot are huge, it's 5 hours of your life that could be spent watching another program.",1306886400,40,346,4.830508474576271
4518227,2,B0050UEVFU,"This would get a much higher grade from me if the first two series weren't bundled together with the horrible ""Children of Earth.""  Series One and Two of Torchwood were fantastic; it was a quirky, often flawed show that wasn't afraid to laugh at itself.  I only had one issue with it, and that was the character of Gwen Cooper (they tried to make her the viewpoint character, but I never could identify with her) but the other characters were great, especially Captain Jack Harkness, the ex-Time Agent leader of Torchwood Cardiff, and his lover, my favorite Tea Boy, Ianto Jones.  I highly recommend both series.

As for ""Children of Earth""...it could have been great, but it wasn't.  It was a potboiler political thriller that had Torchwood stuck on.  The characters just sort of floated along in it, while the main bulk of time dealt with government officials willing to give up the planet's children to alien parasites.  I just have one question:  what happened to not negotiating with terrorists?  It just didn't make any sense to me.

The less said about the upcoming ""Miracle Day"", the better.",1306886400,39,1099,4.797872340425532
4518228,1,B0050UEVFU,"If this were an actual well done Torchwood: The Original Series set, I'd give it four stars. It isn't, and it loses three stars for the following reasons--

1) The guy to the left of the center on the cover, the one in the greatcoat, he should be the one in front. His name is Captain Jack Harkness. He's the Doctor Who character that was given the spin-off Torchwood. Jack is the leader of the Torchwood team. It's his voice viewers hear in the opening for every episode of the Original Series. That voice over is absent from the miniseries Children of Earth included here. It's his actor John Barrowman who's billed first in each episode of every season of every series. Each season of the Original Series was ultimately about him, even the mini-series was ultimately about him. Jack is rightly featured at the front of his team on the packaging for both seasons of the Original Series. The packaging for the mini-series shares this set's misplacement of him.

2) This isn't just the complete Original Series. It's the Original Series bundled together with the Children of Earth mini-series. For those unfamiliar with both series, there are profound differences between them. Those differences exist both in the production team behind the camera and in the storytelling.

Behind the scenes the show-runner for the Original Series, Chris Chibnall, who wrote eight episodes of the Original Series, did not work on the mini-series. The two writers from the Original Series who did work on the mini-series were responsible for only one episode each during the Original Series twenty-six episode run. Neither earned the only Hugo nomination of any Torchwood series. That was earned by Catherine Tregenna who, in contrast to the writers on Children of Earth, wrote four episodes of the Original Series. The director who worked on Children of Earth did not work on the Original Series. There were directors who worked on several episodes of the Original Series. Andy Goddard and Ashley Way each directed six episodes of the Original Series. That's just the differences behind the camera.

The Original Series was about a team, just like Star Trek with its bridge crews, or Stargate with its mission teams. As this cover picture does show, there were five people on the team. It consisted of leader Captain Jack Harkness, doctor Owen Harper, the ladies on the team Toshiko Sato and Gwen Cooper, and the man that kept everything running smoothly Ianto Jones. They worked out of a base, again like other popular sci-fi series. It wasn't a spaceship. The Hub bore more of a resemblance to the Bat Cave than to Stargate Command. It was however instantly recognizable by any fan. The show had re-occurring monsters in the form of the Weevils and the Blowfish. There was a familiar vehicle the team traveled in, the Torchwood SUV. The show even had a mascot of sorts in a pterodactyl known to cast and fans as Myfanwy. Most of all the team was there to keep its eye on the Rift. Part Stargate wormhole and part Buffy the Vampire Slayer Hellmouth anything could come through anytime. The working titled for the pilot episode, which would come to be called ""Everything Changes,"" was ""Flotsam and Jetsam."" That is the Original Series. Some people will tell you that the mini-series Children of Earth is much better than the Original Series. Others will tell you that it isn't Torchwood at all.

What I will tell you is that, at best, Children of Earth is only loosely connected to the Original series. In the series finale of the Original Series, the aptly titled ""Exit Wounds,"" written by departing show-runner Chris Chibnall, two of the five person team were killed. The Original Series ended there. Children of Earth featured the surviving team members, but it featured little else from the Original Series. There was no sign of the Blowfish, Weevils, or Myfanwy. While the Rift was mentioned in passing, its absence from the mini-series was so profoundly felt by fans of the Original Series that producer Russell T. Davies has offered multiple explanations for its absence. The SUV was ""lost"" in the first episode to be promptly auctioned off by the BBC for 18,000 pounds. The Hub was destroyed and the sets that made it up were recycled on Doctor Who. Eagle eyed viewers of the Original series and Doctor Who's fifth season will spot a familiar dragon in the TARDIS. After the loss of the SUV and destruction of the Hub all that was left from the Original Series was the surviving team members and one of them was killed before the end. Whatever one may think of the quality of Children of Earth, it is a distinctly different series.

3) The BBC and producer Russell T. Davies would like to sell all of the Torchwood series, including Miracle Day, as seasons of the same series. They can do it legally outside of the US. Here they gave Starz the right to call Miracle Day a Starz Original. While they might like to pretend all of the series are one, it's a shallow pretense. Miracle Day is a Starz Original. The Original Series and Children of Earth are different in all the ways I've outlined and more. Some people prefer one series to another. No one should buy this set without learning what they prefer. I prefer the Original Series and say save time and money. Buy the season sets for seasons One and Two. You'll have ""The Complete Original Series,"" and won't have rewarded the BBC and Russell T. Davies for their shallow attempt at selling you more.",1306454400,76,5445,4.762711864406779

Thank God, because we need more Torchwood!  The characters are endearing and the interpersonal relationships are very realistic in this sci-fi series.  This show is so popular that after the BBC finished it in  3 series (1, 2 and Children of Earth), Starz network added an additional series (Miracle Day) set in the US!  I am very perturbed by a review that I read condemning the fact that Capt. Jack is bisexual and eventually gets involved with male Torchwood team member Ianto as the series progresses.  It is very unfair to judge this wonderfully written and executed series based on fundamentalistic narrow mindedness.  This series shows the world we live in today, a world where we have same sex couples as well as bi-racial couples.  It's nice for everyone to feel included for once in a mainstream sci-fi series.

The discs should REALLY be packaged in disc sleeves if you're going to use this type of packaging.  A dvd packed in a stiff paper sleeve - which catches on the disc when you try to remove it - is an invitation to disaster.

I will be ordering dvd sleeves for these presently.

This would have been a 5* product had it not been for the packaging.  I think the book shape is brilliant.  However, there should be some sleeve liner or barrier between the disc and the cardboard used to make the ""book"".  My very first disc suffered two scratches because of it being taken out to play.  There is no protection for the disc.

As for the series... It's fantastic.  Although Torchwood is a spin-off from Dr. Who, you need not be familiar with that series to enjoy Torchwood.  As a stand alone series it does very well.

I really wish whoever had designed this had put just a little bit more thought in the conception.  It's great on paper, but when it comes down to real world application, they missed the mark.",1435968000,6,972,4.363128491620111

I had seen it on Netflix and could not resist having a hard copy for myself. The packaging is a unique concept, though I am not too fond of it. Putting it simply, I purchased the DVD set even though I have a Blu-ray player. I wanted the set to be playable on all devices so I went for the DVD version. BAD IDEA. Every time the DVDs leave their book-like sleeve, they gain an extra scratch or scuff. It took me back to the days when I bought the complete set of Charmed and had the same problem. The marks have not affected playing as of yet and I figured I could use them in the Blu-ray if the scratches get too problematic for my DVD player.

4518312,5,B0050UEVFU,"The concept of Torchwood is not entirely original: It is MEN IN BLACK turned somewhat inside-out and into a drama with some comedic overtones. That out of the way, the characters are generally appealing, though somewhat un-even at times; (this, positively, is due to the most realistic part of the series---that human beings are inconsistent---in their opinions, in their desires and in their choices).
My favorites are Captain Jack Harkness (who the show was built around after his 'preview' in DOCTOR WHO) and Gwen. Owen began as an annoying irritant, but over time could begin to grow on the audience as rationals, derived from his background and experiences, were developed to explain his general cynicism and acidity. Toshiko and Ianto, as characters, took much longer to develop. They had less to do and we knew little about them. As the story-lines develop, we find that they are, in fact, mirror images of one another, both filled with doubts and insecurities despite their talents and contributions to the Torchwood Team. Given time to have their characters more at center stage, we could come to know them and identify with them
The stories are generally very good. Each of the first two seasons have a couple of so-so plots and one or two clunkers, but overall, it had a good run.",1402876800,,1291,4.899543378995434

It gives you a more in depth look at the rogue Captain Jack and the rest of the Torchwood team. I was hooked on Torchwood after watching one episode of MD the 4th season. While the concept was interesting in the 4th season the first 3 seasons are a step above. It would be nice if American Sci Fi would reach the level of Torchwood.,1392422400,2,567,4.163636363636364

4518320,4,B0050UEVFU,"""Torchwood"" (an anagram for ""Doctor Who"") arrived courtesy of Russell T. Davies as a spin-off for the popular character of Captain Jack Harkness (a character introduced during the first season with the ninth Doctor). The first three seasons of the series appear here (athe fourth is not included as it was produced by Starz network in collaboration with the BBC and took place in the United States and United Kingdom).

I should warn you that if you haven't seen the show and are thinking about purchasing it that, if you are offended by characters that are homo or bisexual characters, activity, you won't enjoy the show as the main character of Harkness swings both ways. Some of the early episodes also have strong sexual themes (which led me to christen it ""The seX-Files"" during season one) although there are plenty of strong episodes that don't focus on that element. I mention all of this just in case it is offensive to you.

The first three seasons set up the premise--Torchwood was established by the British to deal with alien incursions as a result of the Doctor's interaction with and invasion of alien species on Earth. Captain Harkness is from the 34th century and leads the Torchwood team in the 21st century.

His team consists of Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles), Owen Wilson (Burn Gorman), Ianto Jones (Gareth David-Lloyd) and Tosh Sato (Naoko Mori) who are monitoring a rift in time and space in Cardiff caused by the Doctor's Tardis. Unfortunately the rift allows various aliens and alien technology to leak through to our time resulting in often disasterous results.

The first season of the series is a bit inconsistent and is more episodic than later seasons. The second season is more consistent than the first although there was a change in some members of the cast. Each of the first two seasons are 13 episodes each while the third season was much shorter due to a network change and budget cuts but is equally stellar with an overall story arc dominating the season for its five episodes.

The third season takes quite a departure focusing on a season long story arc involving aliens and a conspiracy involving abducted children. It reminded me more of a Quatermass series but still fit the characters from Torchwood very well.

The fourth season which (SPOILERS)

focuses on Harkness immortality and a story where everyone in the world becomes immortal while Harkness becomes mortal is the best of the series IMHO although many fans of the series are split between loving the first two seasons or the last (I like both).

(END OF SPOILERS)

Image quality is extremely good although the first and second seasons on Blu-ray are presented in 1080i instead of 1080p (identical to the original single season releases).

The third season subtitled ""Children of Earth"" is also presented in 1080i. As a result all three seasons might look just a tad bit softer than a 1080p presentation. That isn't to suggest they don't look exceptionally good--they do although I did find that the overuse of digital noise reduction to be a bit much on the first season compared to later ones for those who pay attention to such things. Detail for the entire series is still strong. Blacks are rock solid as well.

Audio sounds terrific with a nice, strong 5.1 mix for the show and English subtitles for the series.

This boxed set just consolidates the first three seasons in one place without any new extras that are notable. We do get a number of commentary tracks on the first season (for each episode) which are, sadly, missing from the second season. We do get deleted scenes as well as ""Torchwood Declassified"" for each episode. We also get an outtake reel for the first and second season.

The third season is, unfortunately, the lightest when it comes to special features. We only get a half hour featurette on the production of the show.

The packaging is kind of neat but also a pain at the same time. The series is presented in a book with each disc sliding out of the cardboard pages. While Blu-rays are resistent to scratches, I do get concerned about the wear and tear on them and do wish the series had come in a conventional blu-ray case. The book is housed in a larger than normal (for a blu-ray case) sturdy cardboard case.

If you're looking to get the series all in one place (except for season four), this is a very good bargain although be aware of the packaging issue I mentioned and the fact that none of the video has been remastered in 1080p. These minor issues aside, this is a very good show that found its footing with the second season and managed to expand on its premise during the third and fourth seasons very effectively.

4518325,4,B0050UEVFU,"This is a very interesting series. It does not take too long to notice that UK series are a heck of a lot better than the drivel we get here in the States. I purchased the entire series and the very first disk was unplayable. It kept stopping and would not re-start. I called Amazon  and they sent a replacement set even before I was able to return the malfunctioning set. Great service.
  I am now watching the series and I have been unable to watch three episodes because of the stoppages. I believe the disks, although super clear and crisp, were cheaply made. I loaned a friend of mine the set and he encountered the same problems while playing the set on his DVD player.
  The actors in this show are truly wonderful. The women are talented and beautiful, and the male stars are very accomplished actors. One can tell that the sets for the Torchwood headquarters must have cost a fortune. It is well lit, really cool to look at, and it has just enough clutter to make it interesting.
  The only part of the episodes I do not appreciate are the ones in which Captain Jack lip-locks other men. If I wanted to watch gay porno I would go and rent it. I am aware that this is just a television show, but I could never quite like Captain jack after his first homosexual encounter.

I would say that I enjoyed this show almost as much as Eureka and Warehouse 13. Of course, because I loved these two shows, they got cancelled.",1383350400,2,1561,4.392361111111111

4518337,5,B0050UEVFU,"I originally watched this series on Netflix a couple of years ago and found myself going back to it over and over again. Before I knew it, I had gone and ordered the series for my whole family.

First off, let me just say that this is the most brilliant British television series hands-down. Perhaps a bit crass in humor for some American audience members, this is sure to suit the tastes of true ""Whovians"" as well as newbies alike. The first series jumps head-over-heels straight into a fast-paced story opening jam packed with character development and a rock hard solid intro that will knock your socks off. If you're a sci-fi fan, this series is for YOU. If you're not, I recommend watching some Dr. Who first so that you aren't totally confused about certain elements.

Secondly, there is an American series continuing on with the Torchwood story but I must suggest getting this before you get too far into the U.S. side of things. The UK series really gives you a lot of insight into the characters of Gwen and Jack Harkness that are sure to hold you in awe. This series guarantees laughter, shock, tears, but most importantly a genuinely human look into the realm of the totally unreal.

4518353,5,B0050UEVFU,"Somehow we missed the second season of Torchwood when it finally was shown on American TV. We watched the first season and found it okay, and then were riveted by Children of Earth. But now having seen all three seasons of the BBC show (yes, I know there were 4 seasons but the 4th season was an American production), I can say we have a new appreciation for the show.

After watching the first season on TV, we weren't horribly impressed. None of the characters seemed particularly likable, not even the absolutely delicious John Barrowman as Captain Jack. The character of Gwen Cooper, played by the stunningly beautiful Eve Myles, who is supposed to be a sympathetic character, is cheating on her devoted boyfriend, Rhys, with the crotchety and just plain nasty Owen Harper. Ianto, who could be likable, is so busy pining for his girlfriend turned Cyberman that he abandons all of his normal good sense and quiet capability, and Toshiko could easily become one of the original ""Mean Girls."" Rather than working together as a team to try to catch the aliens who constantly pop into Cardiff due to the interspatial rift upon which the city is situated, the Torchwood group snipes at each other and careens from one incursion after another, often causing more problems than they solve.

The second season, however, brings them together as a team, working together to resolve the alien situations. The first episode of the second season shows them slogging along without Captain Jack, who has disappeared. Gwen Cooper is leading the team and seems to have resolved her problems with Rhys because she has accepted his marriage proposal. Tosh is no longer the little snitch, dripping with jealousy if anyone so much as talks to Owen, and Owen, himself, has become likable. He is still cynical and caustic, but has lost the nastiness he displayed in the first season. Ianto is steadier and more of a full member of the team, and when Jack finally makes his appearance, he finds that the group has moved beyond him. They are no longer willing to do whatever he says; they have become quite capable of making their own decisions, which don't always align with his.

The writing for the second season is very powerful, and just about every episode left me in tears. Particularly moving was the episode involving the World War I soldier who is brought out of cryogenic storage one day a year to see if it is time for him to play his extremely important, but completely mysterious role in saving the universe. Also moving was the episode in which Owen finally comes to terms with being dead, even though he is still able to walk and talk. While I found Freema Agyemang's Martha Jones character annoying on Doctor Who, she was a very welcome recurring character in this season of Torchwood.

In addition, the episode in which Gwen wakes up on the morning of her wedding only to find herself extremely pregnant with an alien's baby was very, very funny. The final two episodes of Season Two, in which they explore the back stories of how each of the characters came to Torchwood, were very, very moving and sad-- and ranked right up there in terms of quality with some of the very good Doctor Who episodes.

One of the things that is always especially fascinating about Torchwood is, of course, the character of Captain Jack, without whom there could be no Torchwood. Himself an alien, he often looks at things from a different moral standpoint than the humans who surround him. The first season episode in which he, without protest, allows a child to join the fairy-like aliens who have so viciously attacked her family and the people who have tried to protect her, is but one example of the different way in which he looks at things. The episode in which the airplane passengers arrive from the past is another example, as it is very difficult to imagine any of the human members of Torchwood assisting the older man in his suicide as does TJack. There are times when his character is so completely alien as to be totally incomprehensible, and other times when you can see that he, at times, understands humans more than we understand ourselves-- and to drop into philosophical mode for a moment, that is probably the most interesting thing about Torchwood, in that it explores the foibles of humanity in a way that Doctor Who has never been able to do.

I am very glad we decided to give this series another try, as the second season alone has made it very worthwhile. The third season, Children of Earth, is also an incredibly strong storyline, compelling, outrageous, and ultimately another unbearably sad ending. I hope that Torchwood will return again, preferably on the BBC but if we have to accept the American version, so be it.",1362182400,29,4727,4.730582524271845

I rented it through netflix on a whim, after the first episode I decided I had to buy it. I'm now watching it for the 3rd time though and it doesn't get old. I keep discovering new things. Another plus, is there are special features on each disc, and on season 1 disc 7 they give you a play-by-play and character/episode synopsis to give you another perspective watching it. Very reminiscent of ""Eureka"" from the sci-fi channel. More adult geared. Do not recommend for small children. A rating of ""R"" or ""NC17"" is appropriate.

4518371,5,B0050UEVFU,"""Torchwood"" is a rolicking British series about a group of agents who work for an underground agency called Torchwood. It's a spin-off of the beloved ""Dr. Who"" series, with Captain Jack Harkness(the superb John Barrowman) leading the charge. We learn that Captain Jack heads up Torchwood 3 (i.e. Torchwood: Cardiff). We learn that Torchwood 1 (London) was destroyed by the Cybermen in a Doctor Who episode in a battle known in the series mythology as The Battle of Canary Wharf. This episode has homage paid two it in the series' 3rd episode, ""Cyberwoman.""

""Torchwood"" is a kind of adult version of the X-Files, as the show is very violent and very sexual. Captain Jack is bisexual (or omnisexual as he puts it). He is also immortal for reasons explained over the course of the series due to events on ""Dr. Who."". This subplot drives some of the more interesting scenes. The team is filled out with wonderful actors and characters. Burn Gorman is winning as Dr. Owen Harper, Eve Myles is brilliant as former police officer Gwen Cooper. We see her recruitment to Torchwood in the first couple of episodes. Naoko Mori (Ab Fab) is incredibly likable as computer genius and mathematician, Toshiko ""Tosh"" Sato. Rounding out the group is Gareth David-Lloyd as Ianto Jones, the group's office manager who is promoted as the show proceeds.

This winning cast makes Torchwood a cut above the usual sci-fi fare. The stories are truly original, the dialogue is sharp, funny, and sometimes very moving. The first two shows play like any serial...1 hr. episodes as the group deals with things such as a sex-addicted alien, evil fairies, cyberwomen, and many other imaginative foes. The characters are so sincerely likable that we root for them even when they behave badly, which they do. Seasons 3 and 4 are miniseries style. ""Children of Earth"" being about an alien visiting Earth demanding that we give over ten percent of the child population. It is much darker than the season which preceded it, and there is some division among fans regarding this series.  It is the scariest sci-fi story I have ever seen.  It seems to be the dark and scary tone which put off fans.  There are moments which are truly stomach turning emotionally.  ""Miracle Day""(sold separately) is a truly original idea, where humans stop dying one day for some unknown reason and its about the impact on the workld. Torchwood springs back into action with some familiar faces and a largely new team.

This bluray package includes the first three seasons of the show. It must be said they look and sound incredible in HD. It was like seeing them anew, as the picture boasts incredible colors, fine detail, the soundtrack (DTS-HD 5.1) is awesome, fans have never heard the show sound this good. The package itself was a surprisingly strudy, hard cardboad and the discs are inserted in the pages which includes production stills. The special features are very cool. Fans will ""geek"" out for them. ""Children of Earth"" is a little light on features(although it contains a Torchwood Declassified documentary which is surprisingly comprehensive) but this is forgivable given how terrific the discs look and sound. The $90-100 price tag may seem a little stiff, but the discs would cost you almost twice as much to buy them separately and the quality of the set justifies the pricetag. I would highly recommend this set. Its a must own for fans, but newcomers will greatly enjoy the Torchwood universe and will likely be drooling for more.",1347926400,2,3493,4.88026981450253

Story: Cult classic. Theres alot of children of earth haters out there, and yes it is a very different style/storyline, but its still a torchwood worthy story. otherwise great stories, unique personalitites. Smoke sex alien....awesome...

Content: Pretty extensive for season one, tones of monster type files, behinds the scenes etc. Very few for season two and almost none for children of earth.

Packaging: Very sturdy packaging. thick cardboard casing. very convenient and sturdy book style for each disk. though getting the disk out of the sleeve can be a pain to grab ahold of.

Playability: Played great for me. my only issue was with blu-ray some of the scenes seemed a bit too bright and it seemed like some scenes were super sharp the other scenes were like standard definition. Also none of the special features were in high def.
