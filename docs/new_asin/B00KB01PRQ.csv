6411689,1,B00KB01PRQ,It was far beyond ridiculous and I enjoy that type of movie .,1412899200,,61,3.769230769230769
6411690,4,B00KB01PRQ,"There is something about a movie like this that makes one pause; is it the movie or is it ...me?  So IF I don't like the movie somewhere there is a notion floating around that it could have been done better.  If that notion is followed then there's the idea that perhaps I have better ideas for this movie!  If that idea is followed then there is an inkling that I would perhaps have an inkling that I would have the imagination to even conceive of a movie like this.  And if I can conceive of a movie like this........ well let's just say that's where the true horror begins! Next to the other frightening notion, of course, which is actually ""liking"" this flick!

So I don't know how to really ""rate"" this film but here goes:
Well Jack's transformation may be the one thing to apply some reasoning skills to if nothing else. (BTW: SPOILER ALERT(S)!!!!)
His wife was still pregnant by the end of the movie so in 9 months or less he went from nice normal Jack to the abominable boil man?
It just seems in one scene he was merely doused in crude oil skip one scene and back he is now basically a blistery-bubbled faced monster! Just  a little sudden even if it would happen in 9  months or less the editing made it appear to be virtually overnight!

From there? again, hey I'm the one who read the description AND WATCHED the preview out of how many other movies and previews
And from somewhere in the septic tank of my very soul made the coherent sober decision that I need to see.... more of this movie.....?

And now it is forever embedded in my subconscious!?.... start to finish minus the super-duper-dilly  gross parts that I could almost make out between my fingers while putting my hands in front off my eyes THANK YOU LORD!  I find a minimum of solace when my conscious asks me WHY? regarding movies like this; I seem to somewhat defensively answer with the somewhat worn reply.... BECAUSE I'M A GUY DAMMIT!!!
And that is my final answer and so YES I give this critically cinematically important FILM! 3 stars because... because.... we need to think about the toxins we put in the Earth more seriously!  that poor Jack turned into sewey-Louie in less time that it takes to flush a diarrhea dump!  it is SERIOUS when a grown man covers his eyes during a film like this WHY? Maybe just MAYBE the REALITY is much more troublesome!

I mean YES did Jack need to stand smack dab where Lord Auch's Neanderthal mentally challenged big little brother's blood and guts fell bulls-eye target into his mouth? NO! Was it the smartest to turn down a drink of water from the same oaf when in a brief moment of clarity and sanity he offered it? Hell NO! Though I GOT IT the FIRST time Jack devoured a dead rodent floating in the raw sewage..I REALLY DID! Did you have go the EXTRA mile and give me the buffet ""montage"" remix??? Hell to the NO!!!
But no you just needed me to see Jack lunge into a LIVE rodent huh? For good measure & despite the fact that even full GROWN RATS don't have BONES as such, you just had to add that disgustingly loud ""SNAP"" sound when in  his  feeding frenzy Jack just POPS the head clear off one particularly unfortunate rodent like popping the cap off a bottle of Pepsi didn't ya? And THEN Jack proceeds to throw his head back and DRINK the NO DOUBT disease ridden rabid BLOOD from this varmint ....as if tapping.... a bottle of Pepsi DIDN'T YA!

STILL NO ONE PUT A GUN TO MY HEAD AND FORCED ME TO ENTERTAIN ANY OF THIS...SO....to save some dignity on my behalf  and more importantly for the important underlying message regarding the ecology I give this film a strong...3 plus 1 extra for the laughs for a total of 4 stars.  Someone said this movie had NO humor? God forgive me but bewteen peaking through my fingers (which ironically for a grown man to HAVE to do is humorous enough) a few over the top gratuitous germs...er....gems I was busting some belly laughs during this movie..please don't ask where exactly but they (the belly laugh scenes) were DEFINITELY there I must confess.  So for the sake of the ecology and for at least one or two good belly laughs, I think this movie DID exactly what it's producers intended to do which is laugh & Totally gross me the F*** out!!

.... oh now I remember one particular belly laugh gem guys..... how about an opening scene of an otherwise fair looking chick in the most disgustingly bacteriatic bathroom you ever did see sitting on the feces glazed toilet, her toes curling in the feces muck and mire all over the floor.  Trying to take a diarrhetic dump ...but she can't sit long enough because of the incessant PUKING! What can a girl do? I'll tell you what how about get OFF the toilet for a more ladylike feminine puke session into I believe it was the fecal matter colored don't take no bath up in here ever again ...tub! All not well or good but the problem with that idea was she was still s***ing ..you see?

And what do our lovely no doubt male filmmakers do? But of course they spell it out for us quite graphically so we have our damsel in a mess on all fours like a sick or mad cow...""SHUKING""  (pronounced shoo-king)yes I needed to create a word for when one is simultaneously s***ing and puking! Hey if you have a better one...
So yes I did rewind multiple times as I had to be certain I wasn't just imagining what I thought I saw between laughing uncontrollably which appeared to be a brown liquid SHOOTING out her rooter as the more milky liquid was shooting out the tooter!!!full side view angle shot must be seen to believe NO CGI here folks!!! These guys spared very little for your imagination but my what a laugh!",1409011200,2,5608,4.401353965183753
6411691,1,B00KB01PRQ,"a lot of potential in this theme, but this just sucked. Plot totally fell apart. No continuity, nothing.",1408924800,,104,4.833333333333333
6411692,1,B00KB01PRQ,If I could give less then one star I would. Horrible movie.,1408752000,,59,4.0
6411693,1,B00KB01PRQ,Really disgusting not scary. Dialogue was a bunch of yelling. Didn't finish movie to the end. Very disappointed. Not interested in watching someone puke over and over again.,1408579200,,173,5.214285714285714
6411694,5,B00KB01PRQ,"Fun and enjoyable movie! If you are a fan of troma films via toxic avengers then you may notice that the Septic Man himself looks like Toxie from toxic avenger films. However, since this movie was shot with a low budget I was surprised the filmmakers did a good job into making this film worth watching. Don't expect alot of action or explosions since movie watchers these days get bored of films unless it has the michael bay treatment. I would NOT recommend buying this film but I would recommend renting this film since it is enjoyable to watch one time.",1408320000,,557,4.524752475247524
6411695,3,B00KB01PRQ,"I expected so much from this movie but it just didn't do it for me. What I saw was a boring story that takes place almost entirely in a sewer.

The beginning was promising as it was a gross out bathroom scene with a woman dying in a filthy bathroom spewing Evey body fluid possible .What has happened is the main water supply has been cantamiated by the sewer making everyone deathly sick.

Enter Jack/Septic Man who volunteers to go down in the sewer to try and fix the problem. What then happens is he slowly  transforms into a hideous creature very reminesant of the toxic avenger and just as cheesy.

The rest of the film centers on Jack trapped in the sewer transforming and being terrorized by Two insane characters, Giant and Lord Auch. Giant is controlled by Lord Auch ,Auch being a creepy rat looking man that's insane.

If your a fan of cheesy Troma type films you will probably like it but if you want serious horror this isn't for you.",1408233600,4,947,4.419540229885057
6411696,1,B00KB01PRQ,"Bad, dumb, stupid, made no sense. The main actors makeup looks like a bad mask. Don't waist your time.",1407628800,,102,4.421052631578948
6411697,4,B00KB01PRQ,"The movie is filmed in Canada  with a cast of only 9.
Everyone involved with the making of this film did a fantastic job making this movie make you feel totally disgusted,...i almost vomited twice ! The plot is simple,.Jack, the septic man is hired by a secrete society to find out whats causing the local water supply from being poisoned.
Then Jack finds himself trapped in a sewer in a duel with a vampire and morphing into the Toxic Avenger !
IT'S THE VISUALS THAT GET TO YOU IN THIS MOVIE !
CABIN FEVER HAS NOTHING ON SEPTIC MAN FOR JUST BEING SICK SILLY WITH THE NASTY !",1407196800,2,575,4.275229357798165
8657032,3,B00KB01PRQ,It was a decent movie,1492560000,,21,3.4
8657033,4,B00KB01PRQ,"Yeah, this one is pretty disgusting. Disease from a water supply that's been contaminated leads to a man being called in to source the infestation, while the rest of the town is evacuated. Not only does he trap himself in a septic hell, but also discovers that the source of the contamination is a grisly indication of fouler play. Interesting characters, great effects. Subject matter is not for the weak of stomach, you'll likely vomit. Not a joke. Enjoy!",1480896000,,457,4.7974683544303796
8657034,2,B00KB01PRQ,So many questions about this movie.  Like why did he wear his PPE for all of 2 minutes and then abandon it?  Why was his van covered in poop?  Why did his face turn the way it did?  And what was the thing eating all the people???... But my husband insisted I give it at least two stars...,1477785600,,288,3.913793103448276
8657035,5,B00KB01PRQ,Ultimate disgusting movie! Loved it. The two wachos one with the teeth and the other big dope. Normally I don't like these kinds of movies. But this one was unigue!!,1476662400,,165,4.533333333333333
8657036,3,B00KB01PRQ,"Valentines day is coming and if you are looking for a good ""date night"" film this will definitely take your relationship to a whole new level... A heartwarming love story about a man and his pregnant wife.... This is true family entertainment - IF YOURE THE MANSON FAMILY.

I don't even know how to begin to describe this. Uh, ""disturbing"" would be one way. Watch it drunk, or if your in a state where such a thing is legal watch it while smoking the skunk weed. Seriously - Im at a loss.

Basically we have a septic tank repairman, trying to stop some type of an outbreak of something. It opens up with a bathroom scene that makes the hunter in the bathroom of Dreamcatcher bathroom scene look like a royal wedding. As for the woman in the bathroom scene - no words. You couldn't get THAT effect in a  truck stop bathroom, at a Tijuana dog and pony show, after eating at a Taco truck in South Houston after drinking Lone Star beer. I mean this was worse than the video of the homeless heroin addict who dropped a clinker in the starbucks...

From here we learn that there is a disease outbreak in town, and that the town is being evacuated. Some of the footage - specifically soldiers shooting bloody stumbling infected - leads me to think the outbreak my be a zombie apocalypse. The town is being evacuated and a shadowy figure representing a mysterious ""consortium"" offers the local septic tank guy $200K to go in the sewers and find the source of the outbreak. Since he has a pregnant wife at home, he accepts.  From here things just turn to crap. Literally. Our hero takes a stumble into a fetid sewer filled with rotting corpses and other nastiness, and he is being held by two crazy homicidal maniac brothers who make the Texas Chainsaw massacre folks seem like the Brady Bunch. Think ""The Hills Have Eyes"" with feces.... Our hero is trapped in the sewer, right at the point of origin of the infection, and undergoes a metamorphosis into something not quite human. Think the rock guy from the Fantastic Four, but with pus and necrosis and feces.,,,

Overall - this is a ridiculous movie. Its COMPLETELY absurd in all respects. It relies entirely on gross out factor and campiness. Its a crap movie - both literally and figuratively. But strangely - it works. Mostly due to the ""oh no, they wont. They wouldn't go THERE"" factor Bet yes, they would and they do. This movie has more excrement in it than the Congress, and it makes about as much sense. But unlike that - this is actually entertaining if you want to see grossness for grossness sake. I got my $5 worth and I can safely say this is the weirdest thing now in my video library. Its definitely not Oscar material, but if you have a warped sense of humor and are in the right mood, its entertaining enough..",1452816000,,2771,4.477227722772278
8657037,1,B00KB01PRQ,"A very slow slog of a film with the only distraction being a certain level of gross- not gore, mind you, just a lot of nasty shots of sewers. Might have been a two star if it didn't criminally waste Stephen McHattie in a minor cameo.",1447545600,,233,4.086956521739131

8657040,5,B00KB01PRQ,"Some spoilers do follow.
The fact that this was created by the team that made Pontypool meant that I came in with very high expectations, and they were mostly met. Unlike Ponty Pool, a movie dense with dialogue, this is a film that is much more driven by powerful images and an almost mythic story with long spans of silence. It takes the same basic concept behind Toxic Avenger, of a man who gains superhuman abilities after an exposure to hazardous waste, but there is already something of the hero in Jason David Brown's Jackhe's a humble man, but apparently something of a wizard when it comes to sewage systems, and he's already single handedly bailed his unnamed Canadian city out of a jam once before. This time he is contacted by a mysterious government agent named Phil Prosser (a very fitting reference to Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, played here chillingly by Julian Richings) who offers Jack a LOT of money to defy a quarantine order and go down to find out what's really wrong with the sewer. Jack immediately thinks about what the money can do for his wife, Shelley (Molly Dunsworth doing some excellent work here) and the child she is expecting, and agrees to go down.
What Jack finds is that the system is being clogged by corpses, deposited there by a giant (Robert Maillet looking eerily like Andre the Giant) who kills at the whims of a sociopathic troglodyte named Lord Auch (Time Burd). There's something quite Lynchian in these two villainous characters. Up until their appearance, this seemed to be a story about man vs a society represented by a corrupt city government, but now it seems to be man vs some sort of pure evil located deep inside the self.
The song playing under the end credits caps the movie off perfectlyit's a folk anthem celebrating the Septic Man in the style of the great North American folk heroes such as Paul Bunyan, John Henry & Pecos Bill.
Don't go into this expecting any typical slasher style creature feature about a mutated man monster going berserk. It's a much more subtle and controlled plot, but I found it a very well realized piece.",1422576000,,2097,4.6702702702702705
