8053374,3,B0007XG0FY,"This is a film from my childhood.  I can still remember watching it one early Saturday afternoon on WOR out of New York.  The scene with the police officer being killed really got to me, and I have never forgotten it.

Seeing it now thanks to Code Red, I must say that I still like it, even if it is uneven and has a few plot holes.  Michael Berry gives a decent, if a bit bland, performance as Jodie, a man who meets and falls in love with the mysterious Melissa, played by Emby Mellay in a performance that is marginally better than Berry's, but still not great.  There is some nice atmosphere on display here and I thought the score was decent.  Though it falls short of other occult films of that decade (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Race-With-the-Devil/dp/B0007WQGRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Race With the Devil</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Simon-King-of-the-Witches/dp/B0015I2S0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Simon, King of the Witches</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devils-Rain/dp/B0031ZNGFM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devils Rain</a>), The Touch of Satan is not as horrible as people would lead you to believe.

8053375,4,B0007XG0FY,"Fun movie! The lead actress is obviously new to the ""craft"", but has a vulnerable face that is interesting. The support players are good. Ending is tidy and logical. The romance between the two young leads was believable.

  I believe many would give TOS a favorable grade. Mine? B for this memorable B-Movie. Worthwhile!",1342828800,,321,4.907407407407407
8053376,5,B0007XG0FY,"I first saw The Touch of Satan at the Dublin (Georgia) Drive-In Theater following the 1980 re-release under the title Night of the Demon. It was then released under the original title on VHS video. I have read that it was directed by none other than Tom Laughlin, Mr. Billy Jack himself, despite the director's name being Don Henderson. I am aware that some people do direct films and write books using a false name but I have not seen where this credit has ever been officially given, implied or acknowledged. I am well aware that this film has been laughed-at, low-rated, panned, condemned, damned, parodied, spoofed and razzed by many. many people, but I still like it. There is just a certain something that makes it enjoyable to me. Michael Berry (Jodie) seems to have gone on to a career working on film crews as an on-set medic, among other things. Lovely Emby Mellay (Melissa) seems to have simply just disappeared from the face of the earth after making this one movie. The location filming in Santa Ynez, California is one of the positives the film has. The scenery is lovely. The music was also quite good, too. The film also features some early makeup effects work by the talented Joe Blasco. I miss going to the drive-in and this is one film that transports me back to those days. I just wish that this DVD had been made from a better quality print of the film, if not remastered. It even looks a bit like a DVD that was ripped directly from a VHS video copy. That aspect makes me wonder just why the DVD is priced a bit higher than perhaps it warrants. Maybe it is also the fact that the film is so hard to find in other formats other than on MST3K. But I would much rather watch the film just as it was originally made and intended to be seen and relive the good old days of the drive-in. As for it being a ""bad"" or ""awful"" film, I have seen quite a few huge-budgeted films, featuring big-name casts that I enjoyed a lot less than The Touch of Satan.",1330473600,4,1965,4.371584699453552
8053377,5,B0007XG0FY,"Being released in 1971 The Touch of Satan apparently hasn't made too much progress being seen by the masses on it's own terms. Thankfully for us MST3K scooped this nightmare up to let the world know of yet another B masterpiece just wasting away in life's obsolete $5 bin. A bin so unknown that there isn't even a line full of Mexicans waiting to dive knee deep into discount B in hopes of scoring the prized film ""Banditos."" Just looking at the cover of this one screams that it could only be for sale in a very poor grade food store somewhere next to an expired can of manwich. However all these factors do nothing to deter the super Sid brothers on their unquenchable thirst for more B. We've got a disease and the only cure is more B, more B, more ------ B!

The Touch of Satan starts off with a real 70's flower power pansy named Jodie (this is a guy by the way) on a journey to the west. However he won't be meeting up with Tang and Bandji like you may be thinking, he's on his way to California hopefully to score himself some sweet medical grade norwegian wood. Along the way he stops off at a little hick town where he meets a stone cold fox, well not so much, named Melissa. He winds up falling for Melissa only to discover she's really 120 year old witch with a crazy sister that looks like a derange old grandma. This old lady goes apes--t pitchforking people to death in hilarious fashion. All that can be done is for Jodie to finally tame the beast and save the hick town from the families witch powers.

After an hour and a half of non stop laughter we yet again have found more proof to why MST3K needs to be brought back to life and show to the masses. They have spent years taking unwatchable movies and making them into something something hilarious. With that said what is the purpose for the show being finished off like the elf on the floor looking like a little baby? We need more! There has certainly been no drop off in the amount of B out there to watch so we must do something about this great injustice. The focus needs the shift off of economic recovery and strictly towards getting MST3K and Monstervision back on the airwaves. After that everything will fall in to place and we'll all be yelling ""That was weeks ago muth.... I'm partying!""",1284163200,,2270,4.326291079812207
