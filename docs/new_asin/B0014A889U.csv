8254770,5,B0014A889U,"Blue! My favorite color was red, but now, because of this masterpiece, it is blue. I watched in total astonishment as Smurfs danced before me! Riding their blue ponies! Skipping through blue meadows! Prancing across vast swaths of blue on blue vistas! Brilliant does not begin to describe this tribute to all things blue! The soundtrack -also blue- is so sophisticated and deep -like the ocean- as to call forth images of ancient faery bluesmen playing their blue instruments at the Blue Note! I sit here in my blue jeans, drinking my blue soda, dreaming of that other, esoteric film: THE BLUE LAGOON! All hail the new maestro of cinematic ecstasy! Hail! Hail!...",1390089600,,663,4.876106194690266
8254771,1,B0014A889U,"An absolutely pathetic/parasitic attempt to recreate the 'genius' of Jarman's ""Blue"" (blue screen)...for god's sake, at least demonstrate a modicum of creativity and incorporate a red & gold screen, the colors of the paperback's cover (But, what do I know? I'm certainly not an artist!)

I can understand one reason why it's described as 'absurdist'- it's a well-calculated and well-executed joke (well, that's a bit harsh, let's just say it's a film that works at playing with and testing the 'aesthetic patience' of its audience).

However, as I see things, one reason that it fails as a work of art is because it ultimately undermines its own aesthetic value, it reduces itself to 'kitsch':

(1) It makes sense as 'art' only in relation to an authentic work of art, which it (seemingly) seeks to be the mimetic equivalent of, namely, Jarman's ""Blue.""

(2) The film's description serves as an indictment on the aforementioned charge of 'kitsch,' because the copy goes out of its way to establish the film as a riveting, brilliant, and challenging work of 'high art' in the ""new absurdist' movement.

One meaning of 'kitsch' that comes to us via Greenberg refers to the form of pseudo art that attempts to duplicate the products of 'high culture.' Greenberg thought that the task of the avant-garde was to 'keep culture moving,' growing and striving out beyond itself. Kitsch stifles and retards such activity, for in art, kitsch is the practice of producing artifacts that represent the ""epitome of all that is spurious in the life of our times.""

That said, you people who took a hit on this film, might like Jarman's ""Blue"" - an absolute masterpiece of visual and sonic texture!

8254772,5,B0014A889U,"So three other reviewers bought this movie thinking that they or their children could watch the movie instead of reading the book for a school assignment.  The joke was on them as it is nothing but silent blue sceen.  Had they bothered to read the description, they would have known that it was 75 minutes and 6 seconds of blue screen.  Alas, people who try to circumvent reading assigned material are not so adept at reading.",1227657600,15,426,4.578947368421052
8254773,1,B0014A889U,This was a total rip off!  I wish I would of read the other comments and saw them before I bought it.  It is a blue screen with nothing on it and no audio.  I am so upset that I have to through returning it and my son is not able to watch it and enhance his book report.  Terrible to have on Amazon.  I have never had an issue or returned anything with Amazon.,1219881600,15,360,3.7466666666666666
8254774,1,B0014A889U,"What a joke this is.  I'm not sure who is trying to fool whom, but the video is nothing more than 75 minutes of blue screen.  If this is not the biggest rip-off on the internet, I don't know what could be worse.  Don't even bother.  Read the book and forget the video.",1217635200,14,268,4.0
