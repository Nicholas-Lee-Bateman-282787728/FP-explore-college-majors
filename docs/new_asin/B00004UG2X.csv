7924087,2,B00004UG2X,"Though mostly fluff, this History Channel special nevertheless just manages to be a primer of the history of drink in America.  But then again, it has to be.  There aren't a whole lot of competing works on the subject.  That's why it's particularly sad that HISTORY IN A GLASS doesn't take itself all that seriously.
Its chief shortcoming is its structure and its short run time.  It attempts to break up the entire history of drink into three categories:  spirits, beer, and non-alcoholic drinks.  The result is a temporally confusing narrative that fails, I think, to adequately trace the simultaneous development of the three types of drink.  Worse, the show starts with arguably the newest of the three--cocktails--and then works its way more or less backwards to beer.  It could easily leave the unsuspecting viewer with a confused sense of timing.  Plus, it leaves much of American drink unexplored.  It skims over the antebellum importance of cider and rum punch to the diet of early Americans.  Likewise, the place of the microbrewer, despite having a tradition as old as the country, is largely unmentioned.  American wines are woefully undiscovered.  And it seems to gloss over the non-alcoholic segment of the market as merely a war between the three major colas.  It does very little at all, for example, to document the explosion of non-alcoholic flavors in the past 20 years, nor to really explain the unique access the American market has had to genuine fruit juice.  Compared with most other countries, America has a steady supply of every kind of juice imaginable, and that's profoundly affected our diet.  But we learn nothing of that, here.
That said, there are some things it does well enough.  In particular, it explains, however briefly, the effects of Prohibition on the quality of liquor and the rise of the mixed drink.  It illuminates the origin of the great cola war, and chronicles how one giant got knocked-off by a company everyone thought had gone under.  And it does finally dispel the myth of Smirnoff as a Russian vodka, preferred by the literary James Bond.
However interesting these tidbits are, though, they aren't woven into a coherent whole.  There are virtually no primary sources put on display, and few historians are given their say.  Instead, an annoyingly comic narrator has been chosen to apparently give the storytelling added mirth.  Worse, people with clear biases, like bartenders and cola company representatives, are chosen to tell the story of their particular drinks, rather than genuine historians.  It's unfortunate that such a vital part of America's social history is treated as somehow unworthy of true scholarship.",984614400,2,2674,5.054794520547945
