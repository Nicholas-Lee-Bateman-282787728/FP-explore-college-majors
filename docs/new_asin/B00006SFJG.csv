1792219,5,B00006SFJG,"her workouts are awesome.  I got the DVD yesterday and used it last night.  The workout was very intense.  I was looking for something different to do besides the same old, same old.  And this DVD definately took me to a new level.  It's 45 minutes but the time flies because it's broken up into circuits.  It has a mixture of kickboxing, plyometrics, basketball drills, weight training, etc with a cool down/stretch consisting of yoga moves.  I felt very refreshed afterwards and feel pretty good today.  As I said people do think Denise is cheesy but if you stick with her workouts you will see results.  I also would recommend her Fat Burning Yoga DVD.",1081296000,6,655,4.626086956521739
1792220,4,B00006SFJG,"This is a good workout if you are in pretty good shape w/ no back or joint problems and new to group or video workouts.  The workouts are very effective which was my main focus in purchasing this video despite Denise's sometimes annoying voice or less than satisfactory cueing.  I like the mix of routines including plyometrics, sports conditioning, boxing.  This is probably her best tape yet.",1066262400,3,394,4.850746268656716
1792221,4,B00006SFJG,"I was not overweight (but could stand to lose a few vanity pounds) when I bought this DVD but I was also in very poor shape.  The first time I did this video I could not get through it.  Now I have been doing it a month and if you do stick with it three times a week for four weeks, YOU WILL SEE RESULTS.  I find that I am now easily able to do the entire routine.  I have lost twenty pounds, have energy that I never knew i had, and I have muscle tone...and the only program I followed was this DVD (with a healthy diet of course).  Though it is a little tough for beginners, just go slow at first, staying at intensity level one or two, and in a few weeks level three will be really easy.  The best part by far about the video is that it is not boring.  It is broken up into six sections with brief weight training segments between each one:  Boxing, downhill skiing, kickboxing, crosscountry skiing, and basketball drill.
Now the complaints:
Equipement is used, however, I don't think it is really needed.  In the beginning I didn't have a step or weights, but even without the items, you still get a really good workout.  I used soup cans for weights.
There are four other people on the video besides Denise who do the moves alongside her.  They seem somewhat bewildered on the video, as if they didn't go over what they were going to do before filming.  Denise often seems bewildered at times, as if she herself does not know what she is doing next and is waiting for someone off camera to show her.
Still, I think it was a great video to start off with because unlike other videos I have tried, I didn't lose interest right away.  It is 45 minutes long, but because it is broken up into sections, the time goes really really fast.",1060300800,18,1736,4.224242424242425
1792222,4,B00006SFJG,"This is the 1st DVD I bought from Denise Austin who has a show I watch regularly on Lifetime TV.  The Ultimate Fat Burner workout is frankly not a workout for everyone.  It's of my opinion that you need to be in pretty decent shape already to do this.  Here's why.
Denise incorporates a lot of material into this workout.  Not only are you do aerobics but you are also doing weight training (3 lb weights are recommended on the DVD!), step work (I don't own a step so this is a problem!), and some yoga and kickboxing moves.  She does a lot and a lot of it is very VERY high impact.  However, she does introduce each aerobic move with 3 levels so you can stick to lower levels if you need to.  Its a fun workout but challenging and by 1/2 way through I am usually pretty tired.  Lots of jumping and jaring on some moves, this is not low impact aerobics folks so for those with bad joint problems may want to look elsewhere.
Overall not a bad DVD but does require a lot of additional equipment and I think would be best served for those who have already done other step work and interval training. Lets hope Artisan will release some more aerobic DVDs from Denise as this is the only one available and it's not for everyone!",1057968000,58,1223,4.241379310344827
1792223,3,B00006SFJG,"This new workout from Denise Austin (2001) features circuit training, mixed with light weights. To do this workout, you need a step and dumbbells (3 pound weight are recommended on the DVD). This DVD uses seven 3.5 minute intervals of cardio vascular exercise mixed with 1.5 minute weight segments. The workout runs for a total of 45 minutes.
The cardio segments are broken down into three ""levels"": Level One is a light, low-impact move, Level Two includes upper body motion, Level Three is a high-impact cardio intensifier. For example, the first circuit is boxing. For Level One, you are punching. For Level Two, you are doing light jacks between punches, for Level Three, you are doing full jumping jacks between punches on alternating sides. If you have knee problems, you may lose some of the benefits of this workout because you will be limited to Level One or Level Two low-impact exercises.
The weight segments of this workout are very light, and suitable for beginners. Weight exercises include tricep kickbacks, bicep curls, and military presses overhead.
The cooldown has some very light stretching and features predominately Yoga moves. If you have done Yoga before, you will recognize the Exaulted Warrior, Downward Facing Dog, and Brave Warrior postures.
This is a great workout for beginners, but may not be beneficial for intermediate or advanced levels.",1048204800,47,1371,5.125

1792248,5,B00006SFJG,"A decent workout for women. For people who need more of a challenge, refer to Insanity or P90x DVD series. Denise Austin has the nice personality with not being too cheesy but ACTUALLY motivated me to push out more reps",1381536000,2,219,4.5
1792249,4,B00006SFJG,I am a huge fan of Denise Austin (so much so that although this is new to me I still find it to be repetitive) 2 workouts in one. You can feel comfortable doing at home. Depending on your level of fitness it can be challenging.,1356652800,,227,3.9565217391304346

You do need a step for this workout - I use my FIRM fanny lifter purple segment as my step.  I have maintained/lost many many pounds over the years with this workout.  I have tried other  Denise workouts and I don't like them nearly as much as this one, because they are not hard enough.  This one is hard enough for the advanced, yet she has modifications for beginners.  I love this workout and love the results it gives me!",1355097600,5,562,3.9642857142857144
1792251,5,B00006SFJG,"I really like this exercise video.  Some segments require a ""step,"" but you can do all the exercises without one.  Denise is cute & upbeat, and I can usually keep up with her.  I always get a great workout with this video!",1342137600,,222,4.238095238095238
1792252,4,B00006SFJG,"I've been using this DVD for a couple of weeks now, and I have to say that it's challenged me more than the workouts I'd been doing for the past year (walking/jogging DVDs). Most of the workout is pretty high impact, so if this type of workout isn't something you normally enjoy, then this probably isn't for you. That being said, it's really an intensive workout. I've been feeling it in all of my muscles and working up more of a sweat than with my other workouts. If you have 45 minutes at a time and 3-4 days a week (and can stand high impact exercises), I would recommend adding this one to your regular rotation.",1311811200,3,618,4.336206896551724

I like Denise Austin, but I hadn't done any of her tapes since the '80's...now I know why.  She can't cue to save her life.  She knows what she is doing but the cuing is sloppy, its a shame I really wanted to like this DVD.",1297814400,,372,3.792207792207792
1792254,5,B00006SFJG,A few years ago I used this DVD about 4 times a day for three months and was careful with my diet.  I lost 30 pounds.  I was totally shocked by how quickly the extra weight melted off.  Then the DVD got scratched and I set it aside.  I'm now getting back into it and decided to use other DVDs that I had in my stack from other fitness experts. It's been a painfully slow process.  I'm exercising regularly and eating right but I feel like my first month and a half has been a plateau!  I'm buying this DVD again...,1277424000,,514,4.03960396039604
1792255,5,B00006SFJG,"I've always struggled with my weight and years ago I used denise austin to drop from a size 10 to a 4 but then over the years I let myself go back to size 10 and I finally decided I needed to start denise again. I started this work out about a week ago and have done it everyday.

It is very comparable to the ones I used before when I lost a lot of weight. I'm sure in a few months I'll be looking good again. It is a very intense workout and if you're out of shape like I was you will be sore for many days but just push through its worth it in the end. You do need to buy a step if u don't have one. I bought mine at walmart for about $30. I really recommend this workout.",1270944000,,675,3.6875
1792266,5,B00006SFJG,"I started using this DVD in 2004 when I was overweight and barely in shape. It's tough-- the only way I could get through it was with willpower. You do have to have some level of fitness (I was a college student who walked around campus all the time) but it helped me lose some weight and tighten up. Ever since, whenever I get off track and need a quick, challenging workout to get started on my fitness again, I can always trust this DVD to deliver. Plus, the workouts with weights are customizable and you can use heavier weights as you progress. This will always be a staple in my collection.",1263254400,,596,4.330357142857143
1792267,5,B00006SFJG,"I have been doing Denise Austin excercise videos for years.  I still have VHS from her Hit the Spot series (wish they would put these on DVD also).  However this video is one of her best.

Normally her cueing is off but she does a good job in this one.  Also the excercise routines definately feel more intermediate as compared to others of hers that is considered intermediate.  She uses a step bench in this video, I do not own one and still get a good workout.

She does a good job with the interval training and plyometrics.  I especially like this DVD because it is one straight routine as opposed to breaking it up in sections.  The abs portion does have much to be desired but still a great workout.

Again I own quite a few of her DVD's and this one by far is one of her best.",1257120000,2,784,4.173333333333333

I, however, went from a size 14 to a 10 just doing this five times a week for three months. I didn't have a step bench and I used 3 pound weights. But I've always gone back to this workout because it's just that good if you stick with it.
I promise you'll see results with this one.",1186531200,3,380,4.0131578947368425
1792271,4,B00006SFJG,I've been using a video workout for years now. I like the level of this workout. Definitely challeging. I wish the instructions from move to move would be more clear it would be easier to stay with it. It seems at times Denise isn't really with the program. I pass on most of the jumping portions (third level of intensity) and just keep it at a lower level during those parts. I like the circuit training style. Good workout.,1182384000,,426,4.405063291139241

1792273,5,B00006SFJG,"I like this video because it gives you a good workout in just 45 minutes. Regarding other reviewers' comments about the intensity, I found as a beginning exerciser that the routine could be modified very easily (though Denise doesn't show you this). If I got too tired, I would drop the arm motion, or if jumping-type moves were involved, I didn't jump but did the moves on the ground. She was very motivating to me with her encouraging words. This is a video I can grow into as my fitness levels increase, and I should not have a problem fitting it into my routine a few days a week. I recommend it!",1174694400,3,600,4.366071428571429
1792274,5,B00006SFJG,"This DVD is perfect for when I want a total-body fat blasting workout in a fairly short amount of time. I love the fact the all of the aerobic excercises here are sports-oriented and easy to learn, varying between the use of the step bench and the floor. Sure, if you are unable to do high-impact aerobics, then this is certainly not for you, but if you are, then this DVD will deliver a fun total-body workout. The toning segments are also highly effective - you can simply increase the weight load if you want more of an upper body challenge. I love Denise Austin's upbeat and motivating personality which couldn't be more well-suited for a workout like this. There's also a bit of ab-work at the end and a nice cool down of wonderful yoga and stretching moves. Highly recommended.",1167350400,2,783,4.560283687943262

1792297,3,B00006SFJG,"As an avid home exerciser, I was excited to try one of Denise Austin's videos.  I typically do Tae-bo, but I love step as well so I gave this one a try.

On the plus side, this is a great workout for intermediates and really gets your heart pumping.  On the other hand, I don't think she stops talking for 5 seconds during the entire thing.  I actually turned it off in the middle, because I couldn't take her anymore!!  Don't get me wrong, I like when instructors encourage you, but she takes it way too far.  I will not use her tapes again!",1156723200,3,542,4.163461538461538
1792298,4,B00006SFJG,"I use this dvd to get my cardio workout in about 35 minutes but if its strength training you are looking for this is not the video for you. After I do my workout on the dvd it leaves me yearning for more weights which I then have to do. I then bring out my 5lb hand weights and lift for about 15 min then I do sit-ups for another 15 min. Since I always focus on my abs and this video fall short in that department. All and all it's a great video to get your heart pumping and I love her perkiness, it makes you want to keep moving.",1153699200,,531,3.7927927927927927
1792299,5,B00006SFJG,"Ok, harsh title. I generally love Denise Austin's workouts, but until I came across this DVD it seemed pretty hopeless that I'd find a good Denise cardio-centric workout. Anyway, let's get down to the critique. Denise Austin, if you're not familiar with her, is  known to be an extremely perky workout instructor, so if you don't mind energetic and sometimes lame cheers of encouragement, then Denise Austin will work fine for you.

More specifically to this DVD: This is a circuit interval training workout, where you alternate every few minutes between cardio and weight lifting. For this workout, you'll need a step bench and some weights. Denise recommends 3 lb weights, but I say if you're more advanced, or if you've been working out for a while, you can use whatever you feel comfortable with. I started out with 5 lbs but now, after a few months of using this DVD I keep a few different weights handy, 8 - 15 lbs, and use appropriately. That's one of the advantages of this workout, in that if it gets too easy, there are ways to adjust it w/ little inconvenience. In addition to changing your weights, you can also increase the height of your step, do the cardio workouts with ankle or wrist weights or bands (I use Billy bands - they're individual bands for each foot/hand with loopholes at the feet. they work great for the kickboxing segments of this dvd!).

In terms of difficulty: I've been working out regularly for 3 or 4 years now, and I found this to be relatively challenging when I first tried this DVD. Not challenging in the sense that it was hard to keep up with or had difficult moves, but challenging in that the cardio kept my heart rate up, and I felt my muscles getting stronger with the weight lifting. Denise is pretty easy to follow, although her queuing isn't the best. She sometimes says ""last one!"" when it really isn't, for example. But that's easy to overlook, and with a few goes at it, you fall into step with Denise and her background exercisers.

On the whole, this is one of Denise's better workouts, and definitely one of the better sources of cardio fitness out there, and definitely worth the money. Use it 3-4 times a week and I think you'll see a difference. :)",1152576000,22,2207,4.579746835443038
1792300,5,B00006SFJG,"I actually used to have this workout on VHS, and wore it out. I was relieved to find it here at Amazon.com, I couldn't find it still in stores.  It's my favorite workout--it targets every part you want to work on.",1152316800,3,213,4.195121951219512
1792301,5,B00006SFJG,"Firstly I must start by admitting I am not a fan of Denise's peppy, constantly chatty delivery but I don't let this get in the way of a good workout - and this is a good workout!  It is also not one of Denise's usually EASY workouts, you need to be fairly fit for this one so beginners go for one of her many other workouts.

I do all the cardio segments alone twice and this gives me an excellent interval workout that has knocked heaps of weight off me.  The 7 intervals are short enough to be do-able, but long enough to get the heart going.  What I love is that she has included lots of lateral (side to side) moves - so many aerobic tapes use the standard up/down vertical movement - the lateral stuff is great for your balance and lower body tone.

Yes there are plyo moves (high impact) but you don't have to do them although they really get results.  If you find the weights too easy, up them to 5 pounds.  Some of the ab work is tough yoga based (plank and the like) but again, do the bits you can and work up to the rest.  I personally don't like to buy a dvd that I can do easily the first time I pop it in - you need a challenge and something to work towards or you have wasted your money as boredom will quickly set in.

If you are looking for another great Denise workout - go for the 'Hit the Spot Pilates' - another great intermediate workout - these are the only 2 Denise workouts I use on a regular basis - all her others are too easy.",1147219200,8,1453,4.017361111111111

1792303,5,B00006SFJG,"I find most of Denise Austin's workouts to be geared to beginners but I have a feeling a beginner would have a hard time with this one.  The weight training segments are more beginner orientated but the cardio parts really get your heart pumping!  A couple of them (the plyo moves of cross country skiing and the downhill skiing section)have you anxious for the end of the intervals!  The weight traing segments are welcome breathers!  I really liked the warmup in this workout as it seemed to get you warmed up faster and was more to the point than a lot of other workouts.  Denise uses a step for some things, which I can't use as my knee hurts when I do , so I do everything on the floor and still get a great workout.  I would consider myself an advanced exerciser, running in the warmer months and working out to videos in colder weather and this is one of my favorite tapes for cardio.  It's not filled with a bunch of dance moves that I have a hard time following but just serious moves that get the heart going!",1139443200,9,1019,4.303664921465969

1792305,5,B00006SFJG,"I'm sure that other viewers will find flaws with this workout; generally associated with Denise's cueing and the not-being-synched to the music - but hey, its a cheap DVD, I'm not going to expect surround sound and throbbing bass.

I have been out of shape for a long time, and I know that a year ago I probably wouldn't have been able to complete this workout, but after doing Denise Austin's ""Power Yoga Plus"", ""Fat Blasting Yoga"", ""Personal Training System"" and ""The Ultimate Metabolism Boosting Workout"", I am able to complete this workout rather hap-hazardly.

What was the first thing that impressed me was Denise's attention to a proper warmup.  Secondly, it is also evident that she has put a lot of thought into how this workout was designed.  She took into consideration the optimal strategies for fat burning - interval training at differing intensities alternating with integrated weight training.

If you have been frustrated by Denise's personality and instruction in the past, don't expect her to transform herself in this workout.  She remains her bubbly, enthusiastic self, and does not cease with her catch-phrases that seem to annoy many people but I personally have a giggle to. 'Tight Tushies! No More Jigglies!'  The highlight is when Denise instructs one of the guys how to do a deltoid exercise, and she says, ""No more bra overhang! ...but not for you guys!""  The look on the guy's face was classic.

Only downsides for me is that I find it less fun than some of the other cardio workouts from Denise that I have, and 45 minutes is on the long side for a convenient workout that I can do every day of the week.  She recommends that you do the workout three times a week, but I will probably only be able to fit it in once a week due to its length.",1130630400,7,1771,4.647435897435898
1792326,3,B00006SFJG,"She's a good instructor.  No doubt about it.  She's always enthusiastic (if not often overly so), but one thing that's consistent with all the workouts of hers that I have ever seen, is that she is at one or more stages of the routines, off time to the beat.  It puts me off.  You follow her, and she's out of time so therefore it stuffs you up.  Also, she's not the best cue-er.  She doesn't always prepare you for what's coming up next.  This is where she loses a couple of stars with me, but the actual workout effectivness is excellent.  Good challenge.",1127088000,8,557,4.339805825242719
1792327,4,B00006SFJG,"This is one of the better Denise Austin videos in regards to a good cardio workout. The weight training in this video is weak but I don't use really use it for my strength training. THe cardio workout on the other hand is excellent and will get you sweating. Denise is Denise so if you can't stand her then don't buy one of her videos. However, if you are looking for a video to get your heart pumping and burn some fat this is a good one. The video focuses on interval training and relies heavily on movements found in sports, i.e. cross-country skiing, boxing, speed skating, basketball, etc. It does recommend a step bench and weights, although you can modify it if you don't have the bench. I consider myself an intermediate level- cardio 4 times a week, strength training three times a week, and pilates 3 times a week and I still break a sweat doing this video. As with all home videos though, you get out of it what you put in it. Overall, this is one of the better ones.

In regards to one of the below reviews I am not sure what she  means by the first and second workout. This video just has one long workout on it. Not sure if that review belongs to this workout.",1120780800,6,1174,4.260089686098655
1792328,5,B00006SFJG,"Denise Austin is super-motivating and makes you feel good about yourself. She always reminds you to ""do the best that YOU can"" and makes sure to point out how to correctly do the moves.

The DVD is composed of ~6 intervals that get your heart rate up and each is followed by an active recovery in which you tone the upper body.

You will need some form of hand weights (soup cans will do if you don't have weights) but I found the workout works without the step if you modify a few moves.

It is fairly challenging even if you have been working out for some time. There are ways you can modify it if you are a beginner or to make it more advanced, but Denise doesn't usually point this out, which is the only downside to this video I can think of.",1109289600,5,747,4.137931034482759

The first of the 2 workouts was very low impact and I didn't even break a sweat.  In the 2nd workout (I did them back to back), I found the weight segments useful.  Each aerobic interval was simple, repetitive, and useful for ""light"" days.  (She didn't do any of them long enough to really make me sweat.)  In general, this tape is okay for something to mix in on the days you don't really feel like doing too much.",1102723200,5,519,4.191919191919192

Reviewer: JewelMermaid (San Francisco, CA United States) - See all my reviews

I've been working out with DA for over two years. I love her workouts, they are sound, she is motivational and keeps you moving. If you're trying to lose weight this one will definitely do it. It's tough, it's got the best of both worlds, aerobics and strength training. I think she put all her tough moves into this one. I don't mind that she talks during the video. Yes, we all know Denise is perky so if you don't like perkiness then she is not for you. We also know that DA is not good with cueing. However, this workout uses basic steps and athletic moves so I don't mind that she doesn't cue well. Getting the moves down wasn't a major problem with me at all. A lot of people get hurt exercising because they don't know how to perform the moves correctly. DA makes sure you're doing them correctly. That makes the video more effective. I love interval workouts they are the best way to train.

I am really surprised why the negative reviews always focus on her perkiness - we all know she is perky. Most of these ""reviewers"" have been exercising for quite some time now so I am sure they know all about DA's perkiness and bad cueing. So why are they still doing Denise Austin's workouts knowing all these ""negative"" factors? Beats me :) Denise Austin has been around for decades and has helped a lot of people lose and maintain weight. She is an inspiration!",1098921600,2,1510,4.463768115942029
1792331,1,B00006SFJG,"This may be a good exercise tape - but I will never know because I can't get through it. Denise Austin is so annoying in her extreme peppiness that I had to turn it off after 10 minutes. Now I remember why I never liked her (I once rented one of her Pilates DVDs, and I ended up stopping it in the middle too). I know this is a particular style of exercise instruction where you try to motivate but I really don't understand the appeal when it gets so obvious and fake. Constant cheering doesn't really motivate me - I think it actually distracts me. Instead of giving useful tips about how to do a certain move or cueing for the next step, Denise Austin prefers giving this non-stop ""feel good"" talk. It feels like she considers keeping quiet for a few moments as ""weakness"", so she tries to chatter throughout the exercise. She has a husky voice, it is as if she has been yelling all day and about to lose her voice. I know she is trying to motivate, but it ends up getting on my nerves. At one point on this DVD, she is showing you the classic kickboxing stance where you hold both your fists in front of your face, and she keeps calling out ""protect that beautiful face!"" - so pretentious and annoying. She is trying to make you feel better, I guess, but I end up feeling like she is trying to suck up to me. It is extremely irritating. Currently, I am really digging the ""Kickboxing Workout"" by Kathy Smith - which is a lot less annoying (only a few of those fake cheers) and really kicks you(...) since it is less distracting. I also love Tamilee Webb's ""Abs of Steel"" and ""I want that body"" tapes - she is very much down to earth and doesn't blabber. I am looking for other exercise tapes along those lines - something  with good music, good instructions, and less ""ooh""s and ""yeah""s. Recommendations welcome.",1094688000,6,1816,4.341176470588235
1792332,1,B00006SFJG,"I own and use more than 40 exercise videos and this is currently my least favorite.

I just quit this exercise video in the middle of the first use because my biggest pet peeve is poor queuing. I have never quit a video before like I did this one. I always make it through to some degree depending upon my fitness level. In this one I lost motivation during it because I was constantly trying to catch up.

THE GOOD: she is perky, she is working hard. If you can get through this and memorize each next move, you will probably find this a challenge.

THE BAD: There is no ""level 1"". I have exercised all of my life and more recently needed to start over at level 1 and I had to make up my level one. She also started doing lunges off of the step with the weights inches away. Knee safety was also not mentioned at all during the warm-up. I want an instructor who can queue me for the next move. I don't want to stumble into it. To me good queuing is difference between an exercise instructor and an excellent fitness instructor. Plainly, this lack quality instruction.

Only buy this if you are already in excellent shape and need someone to torture you with poor queuing.

I recommend the FIRM Basics series especially FAT BURNING. This one is good for beginners and intermediate alike. From there you can move on to the tougher videos. Don't let Perky in Pink ruin your motivation to exercise. This one will definitly scare off the beginner or someone returning to the habit.!!!

If you want perky and well queued, try Tammy Lee Webb. At least you are comfortable that you are getting a safe yet challenging workout.",1092787200,5,1618,4.412751677852349
1792333,5,B00006SFJG,"AWESOME WORKOUT

I have to take back every negative thing I ever said or thought about Denise Austin. For some reason she has always kind of annoyed me (a little to perky I guess). I purchased one of her tapes in the past (cant even remember which one I disliked it so much) and I turned it off after 5 minutes. I was hesitant to buy another DA tape, but I really wanted a circuit tape that was more cardio intensive, so now Ill admit it I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS TAPE. I can see the opinions being a little negative because of the jumping, but you can always modify and pace yourself the first few times you do it. It provides an awesome cardio workout. The weight work is not great, but I have other tapes for that type of workout. I love Cathe tapes as well, but sometimes her cardio is so complex that I feel like I spent more time trying to pick up on what she is doing and less time really working hard. This tape solves that problem. The moves are VERY athletic, but also very basic. This was the perfect type of workout for me. Im not crazy about dancey workouts that spend most of the time doing mambos, grapevines, etc..This workout provided a strong cardio interval workout and I can definitely see myself doing it at least three times a week. It is absolutely fantastic. I had very little trouble with the cueing and I tend to focus more on the lead person and rarely pay any attention to the background crew, so if there were flubs, I didn't notice them. I highly recommend this workout.",1092441600,3,1497,4.308510638297872
1792334,5,B00006SFJG,"I have tried MANY workout DVD's and found this to be one of the best.  I really like Denise and she knows how to make you work.  This DVD switches between cardio and weight lifting intervals.  You will see the most results this way and you will definitely sweat during this video.  It requires that you have a step and some hand weights for the workout.  This is a top DVD, easy to follow and is effective.  Everything you could want from a workout DVD.",1087430400,3,453,4.270588235294118

For those of you who are not familiar, I recommend watching the video first to familiarize yourself with Denise's style and fast pace.  She gives a great workout, focusing on both cardio and strength training.  I am in pretty good shape, but was huffing and puffing 1/3 of the way through!  It's a great workout, easy to do in your home.  All you need is a step and some 2-3 pound weights.  It would STILL be a great workout without the step or weights though!  Denise is fast and changes moves quickly without a lot of advance notice.  But after a few workouts, you'll catch on.  This is a fun, fast-paced workout guaranteed to make you sweat!",1084320000,,725,4.473282442748092

It is a great workout and Denise's bubbly enthusiasm gets me through it.",1514419200,,383,4.536231884057971

It actually has some of the same moves from P90X but on a more intermediate level with the ability to modify for beginners. The strength training intervals were a nice way to take a small ""break"" while still burning.  I used 5lb weights only this time around but will probably be going a little heavier next time just because I felt like I had more to give during those intervals.  Highly recommend this HIIT !!",1496793600,,468,4.367816091954023
