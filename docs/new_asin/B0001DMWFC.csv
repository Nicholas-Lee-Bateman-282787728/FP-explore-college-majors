8010934,5,B0001DMWFC,"I have watched ALL eight Kiddy Grade DVDs! This is the first DVD (It also comes with a nice box to put future DVDs.)of a GREAT, anime series! Personaly, this is my FAVORITE anime...It takes place FAR, FAR, WAAAY FAR into the furture...Its about these two girls, Eclair and Lumiear. They work at The Galactic office of Trade and Tariffs, or GOTT. The series starts out with every eposode starting out with a new story, lator, the story starts to tie together.

This anime is so good, my MOM liked it! And It takes alot for her to like a show thats rated ""Teen!""! And my Dad was in the living room when me and my friend was watching it, and he he sat down and started watching it...He thought is was a bit intresting, And it take A WHOLE LOT for him to even watch a CARTOON!

The Animation is great.

As usual, the English acting sucks, but all anime is like that. The voices are good, But the acting is not.

Besides, watching Anime is more fun in the original format.",1160179200,,967,4.26775956284153
8010935,5,B0001DMWFC,Kiddy Grade is a great anime show it's like the female verion of gundam wing. Eclair and Lumiere are a great team that made up a group call GOTT. The girls act like girls at times but when theirs work to do they know when to ack serious.,1121040000,,237,3.9583333333333335
8010936,5,B0001DMWFC,"This is truly an Anime that carrys over the tradition and the spirit of Kei and Yuri, the Lovely Angels. or we know and love them, The Dirty Pair. Lumiere and Eclaire are well matched and well acted (Collen Clinkenbeard and Monica Rial) as the two members of GOTT who go out and mix it up with intersting levels of mayhem and adventure. The interaction and supporting players are excellent and the story gets better with each installment. I am only waiitng for the boxed set to come out so that I can have all the DVDs at one shot, possibly with extras.

 I heartily recommend it to any and all anime lovers.",1102982400,4,608,4.371681415929204
8010937,5,B0001DMWFC,"I would like to say that I have seen most of the shows in this series already and being an avid anime fan I do not think that I am exagerating when I say that this is quite possibly one of if not the best anime series I have seen.  The detail in the story is excellent and draws you right into the mix.  True, it is about young girls but they hold roles of a more mature stature and play them out quite elegantly.  It is a must for all anime fans in my opinion.  All I would suggest is do not stop watching after the first few DVD's cause your gonna miss a huge suprise!",1100649600,3,570,3.8461538461538463
8010938,5,B0001DMWFC,"Kiddy Grade is one of the best anime I've seen in awhile. The two main characters Eclair, and Lumiere work for the G.O.T.T. (Galactic Organization of Trade and Tariffs) as ES members. This show has it's share of comedy and action. I suggest that every anime fan watch this series. Even though it has a bit of a slow start it really is good.",1097625600,,340,4.328125
8010939,5,B0001DMWFC,"Kiddy Grade  is so good I love this show and so would any one else if you like anime you have to buy this show. Eclair and Lumiere are so cool. The box is so amazing I love the box it is good and sturdy, and has all the good characters on it. Everyone should buy this show. The episodes are really good too. Do not judge this show on the first disc though because the first disc is good, but not the best. It does get everything out there that you need to know though so the by the second disc it gets into all the good stuff. If you do buy this show you have to get it with the box you cannot be a kiddy grade fan without this amazing box.",1084752000,3,640,3.7761194029850746
8010940,5,B0001DMWFC,"this is a great anime! i shall review the episodes!
#1 Depth/Space- (A) very good 1st episode though a little bit of some strange cosplaying involved.
#2 Tight/Bind- (A+) excellent but annoying coincidences keep happening
#3 Prisoner/Escort- (B+) good but did not live up to its episode potential
Don't judge this series on the 1st disc. as with most 1st discs of series the 1st one isn't all amazing but i can gurantee you the 2nd is pure gold! so go an buy it!",1083456000,,462,4.511904761904762
