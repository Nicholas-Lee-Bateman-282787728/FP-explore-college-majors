8024192,5,B000297NNG,"Cindy is just great, period. Her Western Swing DVD is a must, even for people playing six string lapsteel. This is volume two of a 2-DVD set, and she demonstrates several alternate tunings, including a GBEGBD tuning for playing Panhandle Rag - surprisingly, I know of no one else who uses this tuning)  From what I've seen of other instruction videos, I think this one and it's companion hit all the high spots an then some.",1504051200,,424,4.578947368421052

8024196,5,B000297NNG,"Great material well taught by a master. However the customary Tab book was replaced with a PDF and since I have no printer
I called Homespun and they sent me the book",1439424000,,166,4.21875
8024197,5,B000297NNG,"This is the second (slightly more advanced) dobro lesson offered by Cindy Cashdollar.  She offers a very enjoyable song-oriented approach to learning theory and techniques, and will have you up and running with minors and alternate tunings very quickly. She makes an excellent teacher and seems to really care about your understanding all the little tricks and sharing her love of the dobro.  I also highly recommend her other (first) DVD for beginners to get up to speed quickly, but this one is an excellent follow-up. There is a lot of good material here to absorb and replay for months, at less than the cost of a single live lesson. I personally get more out of these DVDs than I would get from a live lesson, as you can work on difficult parts over and over and study each and every bar and finger movement until you nail it.  The digital download versions offered by Homespun are even more useful, as you can watch them on multiple devices (even cell phones) and loop them or slow them down without any pitch changes.  She breaks down each song and includes slow versions to play along with (though they are still sometimes a bit fast when you first start learning them).  The Panhandle Rag lesson is really fun. I sometimes find it annoying to go to the different tunings for certain song lessons- especially the E tuning for Rockabilly Blues- as I am unlikely to ever take the time and risk to tune to E at a jam or show-  but they are definitely worth knowing about and understanding. I've seen almost all the dobro lessons out there and I think she has the best pace and balance between work and fun.",1402876800,6,1611,4.537931034482758
8024198,5,B000297NNG,"Cindy Cashdollar is a marvelous teacher and all the tunes in this Dobro lesson are fun and interesting.  ""Panhandle Rag"" is in G6 tuning (DBDEBG), and is the number she played at the closing of her

""Beginning Dobro"" video.  ""Faded Love"" and ""Minor Swing"" are both in G tuning (DBGDBG), as is the segment on minor key progressions.  The remaining number, ""Rockabilly Blues"", is in E tuning (EBEG#BE). [This E tuning is mistakenly written backwards in the TAB booklet].

All pieces are performed and then played slowly.  The teaching is clear and the emphasis is on playing in minor keys.  All of these pieces are performance-worthy. Anyone interested in learning Dobro should get this lesson.",1124582400,18,692,4.965217391304348
