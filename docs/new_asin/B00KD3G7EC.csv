8657695,5,B00KD3G7EC,"This DVD of ""The Cure"" is superior to the North American 4:3 ""fullscreen"" DVD edition. It contains a very nice transfer of the film with its original 16:9 theatrical aspect ratio, the original stereo audio track in English and an optional dubbed audio track in Japanese. The Japanese subtitles are not burned in and may be turned off. I doubt there will ever be a Blu-ray of this film, so this is the best version fans of this film will likely ever have.

Keep in mind that this is a Region 2 dvd. A region-free player will be necessary to play the movie in North America.",1495843200,,572,4.39622641509434
