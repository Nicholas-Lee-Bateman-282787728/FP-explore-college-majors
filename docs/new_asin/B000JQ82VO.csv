I have many of the radio programs, but it's great to actually see the cast together onscreen.  The DVD I have is as clear as movies of that era could be.  Rochester was a revelation to me with his great rendition of My My, and although I knew of his background as a dancer, I had never seen him actually dance. I watched the film again this morning and thoroughly enjoyed seeing Jack, Phil, Don, Rochester and Dennis, and of course the infamous Maxwell.  I treasure it as a piece of America long-gone.",1421280000,2,593,4.324324324324325

8152627,5,B000JQ82VO,"of all the bygone luminaries who's glow has faded with the passage of time, the one it most saddens me to see gradually forgotten is Jack Benny. way back in what's known as the Golden Age Of Radio, Jack Benny pretty much invented the sitcom, and it was rewarded with a status of all-time greatest radio comedy that, to many, still stands today. it's good to know that there's a sect of fellow enthusiasts to whom Jack Benny remains as synonymous with comedy as, say, Henry Ford is with the automobile, or Jimi Hendrix is with the guitar, but still, there's no point in trying to deny that he no longer commands the limelight as he once did.
radio (and, to a lesser extent, television) proved Jack's true forte. his work in the movies was nowhere near as fulfilling. of the nearly thirty feature films he headlined in the '30s and '40s, he would ultimately declare only three worth the bother of making or seeing, and he was only completely satisfied with one of those. (namely, Ernst Lubitch's masterpiece TO BE OR NOT TO BE.)
it's somewhat ironic that BUCK BENNY RIDES AGAIN should rank as one of the three. one of his complaints about the movies he was being offered was a tendency to echo if not outright plaigarize elements of the radio program. and in this film, Benny plays his radio counterpart and is surrounded with much of his radio cast.
(such radio off-shoots were one of Hollywood's most prolific commodities at the time. they didn't even had to be particularly good, or at least particularly distinguished, since what audiences really wanted was faces and mannerisms to go with those ethereal voices.)
the action begins in New York. (a bit of a discrepancy, since Benny's program was in fact stationed in California, but oh well.) first, Jack becomes infatuated with a girl singer who comes form the West and as such prefers cowboys. then, he receives a challenge from his arch-nemesis, rival (and not nearly as talented) comedian Fred Allen. Allen questions just how qualified Benny is to play one of his occasional radio characters, cookie-cutter Western hero ""Buck"" Benny. so between the two, Jack heads West (well, ""B"" movie West, anyway) to prove himself, get the girl, and shut his detractor up. Hollywood-brand merry mix-ups ensue along the way.
so okay, the film isn't what you'd call groundbreaking, but it wasn't trying to. ""B"" movies, techically speaking, are deliberately formulaic films of lesser budget, and usually lesser running time, as helmed by less established actors, writers, directors, et al. (they were designed to be the bottom half of a double feature. the appetizer, if you will.) but ultimately, the film is exactly what a film of this sort (a film of any sort, really) most needs to be: entertaining. Benny oozes charm - why else would his listeners forgive him for underpaying his staff or clinging to the delusion that he was a violin virtuoso? - and his chemistry with such cohorts as Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson, Phil Harris, and Andy Devine doesn't miss a beat. there have been some pretty dismal examples of ""B"" movies (at least partly because the bar was never set very high), and BUCK BENNY RIDES AGAIN serves as a reassurance that they don't have to be.
i must also insist that you jump at any change you get to see TO BE OR NOT TO BE, in which Benny plays the star of a Polish theatrical troupe who pit themselves agains the Nazis when they invade. BUCK BENNY RIDES AGAIN showcases what Jack already was, what his audiences expected of him. TO BE OR NOT TO BE showcases what he could've been, how much more he was capable of. but alas, it wasn't a big hit because it was stigmatized when co-star Carole Lombard died in a plane crash. (i know, that sounds odd after, say, Heath Ledger's death shoved THE DARK KNIGHT into blockbuster status. to say nothing of Jimi Hendrix releasing four albums in life and about sixty posthumous albums. what can i say? it was a different world.)
and for You-Know-Who's sake, run like hell from THE HORN BLOWS AT MIDNIGHT. (not quite the ISHTAR of it's day you'd think from hearing Benny's radio series, but close enough.)
P.S.: i almost forgot: the third of those films that Jack Benny would himself recommend to you is GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT HERE.",1327449600,3,4234,4.715249662618084
8152628,4,B000JQ82VO,"First a word about privately manufactured DVDs--
Often, transfers are not of the highest quality. The movies themselves are unrestored and rarely pristine (but still watchable), extras are non-existent and inclusion of artwork or liner notes varies by manufacturer. These niche companies can however provide a valuable outlet for movies unavailable anywhere else.

BUCK BENNY RIDES AGAIN is one of only two motion pictures that feature the cast of the enormously popular ""Jack Benny Program."" They're all here (Mary Livingstone as a radio voice). Jack's ""rival,"" Fred Allen and his wife, Portland Hoffa cameo in voice only.

This motion picture has its origins in some 1930s ""Buck Benny"" radio episodes with guest star Andy Devine (who also appears). In keeping with his character, when citified Jack arrives in Nevada he's all decked out in western gear more lavishly spangled and satiny than anything Roy Rogers ever dared to appear in.

SYNOPSIS--
Phil Harris's girlfriend Brenda (Linaker) is in Nevada awaiting a divorce so Phil asks Jack to travel there with him. Jack refuses until he meets and falls for vocalist Joan Cameron (Drew), a gal who believes that the only --real-- men come from the West. To entice Jack to Nevada, Phil lies to Joan by telling her that 'Buck' Benny owns a ranch in that state. When Fred Allen's press agent publicizes this story all over Manhattan, to prove it's true Jack is forced to head west.

He enlists the aid of Andy Devine and some ranch hands. Joan and her sisters (Dale and Cornell) sing at a nearby spread, and Jack, pretending to be owner of Andy's place, tries to impress her by fighting the hired help, who pose as outlaws. This plan backfires when Jack challenges two real bad guys (Bond and Ankrum), and after Joan overhears Jack's butler, Rochester (Anderson) discussing his boss's trickery. 'Buck' later proves his manliness to Joan with some fancy ridin,' ropin' and twin six-gun shootin'.
