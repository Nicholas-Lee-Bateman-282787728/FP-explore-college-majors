8102156,5,B000CSUNQG,"I used to watch this all of the time in England.  I was super excited to see it on Amazon.  Yes, it's not the best animation or best acting but it is a fantastic childhood throw back & I'm so happy to have it!",1362960000,,209,3.727272727272727
8102157,5,B000CSUNQG,I bought this for my youngest son and it was well worth the purchase. Constant laughter comes from the room when it is being watched.,1286150400,,133,4.36
8102158,5,B000CSUNQG,"I used to watch Willo the Wisp years ago when it was on Australian TV.  Having already fallen in love with Mavis the 'fat' fairy and the Evil Edna the Television witch, there were no prerequisites to buying this delightful DVD.
The 26 short episodes are wonderful viewing.",1233273600,,272,4.666666666666667
8102159,5,B000CSUNQG,"I bought this to revisit one of my favorite shows from childhood, Willo the Wisp, and it is still as entertaining to me as an adult as it was as a child.  It's so charming and some of the facial expressions that Willo makes are just fantastic. It's hard to make a wisp look scared or concerned or content but somehow they made it so. I love this collection and I can't wait to show it to my future children.",1212364800,,407,4.0875
