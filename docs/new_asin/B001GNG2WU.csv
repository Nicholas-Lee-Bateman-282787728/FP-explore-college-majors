3616956,4,B001GNG2WU,"I especially like the silent pieces from the nineteen teens that the Fleischers produced. Also, the ""stereo optical"" technique they used quite a bit has always fascinated me. I had only known it from the early Popeye cartoons. Finally, these restorations are superb.",1364947200,5,266,5.209302325581396
3616957,5,B001GNG2WU,loved this item great if you like old cartoons spent the whole afternoon back in time so simple very relaxing,1356566400,2,109,4.5
3616958,4,B001GNG2WU,"I enjoy old cartoons, and i like how they made it possable to make these type of dvds...im very happy to have this collection",1351814400,4,125,4.25
3616959,5,B001GNG2WU,"OK, I'll admit it.  I am a cartoon collector and this program, despite being from Alpha Video, was something I had to have due to the titles it contains. Too many times I have been disappointed with products from Alpha Video as they often have poor video quality. In this case, however, these cartoons look quite good despite their age.

Being examples from the 1920s they were all, mostly, silent. In this program, however, musical accompaniment is included for all of them. Just know that the music you hear is probably not what theater audiences heard when these films played the local theaters. Notice I said ""mostly"" in that last sentence. Two of the films in this set are pioneering examples of adding sound to cartoons. There's even one where lip synced dialog is tried.

All of these cartoons were made well before the movie industry developed and enforced a self-censorship code so expect to see some ribald humor here and there and ethnic stereotyping that is no longer considered acceptable. This set makes it clear that during the early days of cartooning the intended audience was adults, not children.",1325203200,9,1115,4.8578947368421055
3616960,5,B001GNG2WU,"The earliest cartoon on this disk is from 1917! It has the first cartoon with actual spoken words made by Max Fleischer and Dr. Lee DeForest.  ""My Old Kentucky Home"" may appear a little racist, but it's all in good fun!  Early works of animator Walt Disney are featured here as well, ""Mechanical Cow"", (an Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoon), and ""The 4 Musicians of Bremen""...wonderful music here, but no dialogue...This disk delivers what it says - actual early cartoons from the twenties, uncensored, full of crazy characters not found anywhere anymore!",1290211200,16,553,5.0
3616961,5,B001GNG2WU,"This DVD has some amazing old classics on it. Many people reviewing these old cartoon collections give very detailed critiques of them. I just like these old cartoons. Yes, some are jerkey and/or dark etc., but that just makes them more realistic to me. That's what I expect from something that ole. Like listening to an old record. They remind me of my much younger years, and some have amazing imagery in them considering when they were made.",1288742400,7,444,4.705128205128205
3616962,5,B001GNG2WU,"While a few of these cartoons are available elsewhere on more expensive releases and in ""remastered"" quality, the variety is worth the price.

TANKS (1917) The earliest cartoon on this colection, created by animaton pioneer and inventor of the ""cell system,"" Earl Hurd.

MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME (1926) Quiet possibly the first ""sound cartoon"" produced by the Fleischer studio.

SWEET ADELINE (1926) This film was part of the Song Cartune series, produced by the New York based Max Fleischer studio. The Fleischers partnered with sound pioneer Dr. Lee Deforest for this one.

FOUR MUSICIANS OF BREMEN (1923) One of the first Disney cartoon shorts, produced by the newly formed ""Laugh O' Grams"" studio.

THE HUNT (1927) Starring Dinky Doodle, this short series was created by Walter Lantz while at the Bray Studio.

MECHANICAL COW (1927) An Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoon when Disney was working for the studio before he lost the rights to his cartoon character.

ALICE RATTLED BY RATS (1925) Live action Margie Gay in a cartoon world.

There are more cartoons on this volume but trust me when I say the price is superb for this colection.",1226880000,48,1135,4.936842105263158
3616963,5,B001GNG2WU,"I throw this on at parties where I expect no one to really pay attention to the TV, just as some background entertainment. The few people that actually start watching it are always either really into it, or creeped out by it. I love this DVD. It has some really great oldies, some of which can just be found on YouTube, but this is just one of those things I prefer to own.",1451001600,,373,4.123287671232877

8306312,5,B001GNG2WU,Some very bizarre cartoons on this DVD. Some were strange but others like Ko Ko the Clown in Toyland were very cool.,1514764800,,116,4.318181818181818
8306313,3,B001GNG2WU,"Alpha Video/Oldies.com, the maker of this dvd is never known to produce high quality transfers.  However, absent availability from other more capable and better sources, this will do. It's quality you can live if you don't mind transfers that are way under the threshold of being a decent transfer. The cartoons themselves are fun to watch and would have been nice to keep for archival purposes if they were cleaned up to high grade quality. 3 stars, I think is generous.",1509235200,,471,4.814814814814815
8306314,5,B001GNG2WU,"I give this 5 stars for historical value and it is a valuable collection.
Very decent quality DVD-R.
Cartoons are not really restored but very tolerable.
Sound quality is worse than video but is acceptable.
Onscreen menu is great. Very well done.

These ancient cartoons are beautiful, very stylish and artistic.
They are almost like cursive writing with superb penmanship. Very expressive.
Some are just animated comic strips with dialogue balloons which I think is fine. Reminds me of the old Mutt & Jeff series.
The Hunt is an early live film and animation hybrid masterpiece!
Excellent in every way, impressively so.
Direction, acting, design, cinematography are outstanding. Should have been Oscar nominated!
The liner notes state the toon My Old Kentucky Home (1926) could be the first sound cartoon. It may well be but it is very stereotyped unfortunately. Not very forward thinking.
Back in the day stereotypes were understood as silly and cartoonish but to see an actual cartoon be stereotyped to this extreme is disturbing. I find it quite foolish.
Despite 'My Old Kentucky Home' this is a very worthwhile collection overall.
Fun for all ages!",1488240000,,1153,5.1005291005291005

8306316,4,B001GNG2WU,Love it! Cartoons that are 90+ years old are pretty amazing. They are b & w and have old movie time soundtracks and I'm happy that these still exist.,1482624000,,149,4.172413793103448

8306318,3,B001GNG2WU,If you're a fan of classic animation this low-priced collection will give you a few moments of diversion. Most of these public domain cartoons from the 1920's are obscure...and deservedly so.,1466985600,,191,5.193548387096774
8306319,4,B001GNG2WU,"Good set of early animated shorts. I was surprised to find the technology existed in the 20's for the mixing of live action and animation
My one problem with this dvd collection was the song My Old Kentucky Home for the use of a certain term to describe blacks and I'm not a politically correct person. I rolled my eyes at a youtube posted 1932 cartoon My Merry Oldsmobile because someone way too sensitive described it as vulgar and sexist.",1458604800,,441,4.525
