8174913,5,0971560137,"Well, here's my review on all 3-tapes which I received last week - I am an intermediate/advance dancer - I found all the levels very useful - great patterns - every lesson is explained thoroughly, - not repetitive!
beginner level: shows basic steps/cross body leads - and pretty much all the steps for basic salsa dancing - men and females steps.
Intermediate video: my favorite one - lots of steps you see on the dance floors plus some new ones w/ their own variations - nice patterns (14)- I recommend it!
Advance video - a continuation of the intermediate tape - some moves are very leadable and don't require alot of practice - great tape - great patterns - i really liked it.",1015804800,2,680,4.536585365853658

The teachers show some of the best known steps & turn combinations with some new turns so to make it interesting. I have been impressed with all three videos.
My review of the Beginners Video
The most enjoyable fun Salsa teachers on the market. A lovely young couple who love to dance & teach. Diana is the most enjoyable female Salsa teacher on the market. Great sense of humor. Very enjoyable. The teachers have fun & enjoy what they are showing you.
Neal & his female partners No. 1 most enjoyable video to learn Salsa from.
I am going to review these videos as a couple of videos because if you are a beginner you will need to buy the beginners video first. In the Intermediate video they refer to step combinations taught in the first video. You can buy the intermediate video separately if you have done some training as they refer to common known Salsa terms.
Both videos are very good value, 52 & 45 min long , well produced good pause but they most importantly have a SLOW MOTION ON ALL COMPLEX MOVES as well as the normal speed , plus the breakdown of the steps. They give you both forward & back views plus both sides for cross body leads. They do not over detail the footwork but I feel it does not matter as you can rewind. They add several styling combinations to a move so you can choose what you like. They teach the women how to be sexy, dramatic, & romantic. They give the men tips on what behavior women find acceptable & what is not. These tips on how to avoid being slapped!!! are a must view for all male LA style dancers.
The teachers give you warnings on possible injuries on the turns to protect your partners.
Both the videos are full of useable steps & combinations. I enjoyed the fact they explained how to make the common combinations out ot the steps shown. They show steps in both videos that nobody else does but also give you the most common steps. I really enjoyed the Intermediate video. Very nice combinations.
Although there are some known NY steps. I feel these videos could also be used by LA style dancers as well.
I really have only one complaint about these videos. Cultural Explosion is a well known & liked performance dance company going by the Salsa message boards. I would of liked to have seen a small clip of one of their demo's in the back or front of these videos. The clips they do show are too short & just make me want to get my hands on any advanced videos they may make in the hope they will show some of their demo's. They have short clips of Salsatrio, etc.
New York Salsa - Advanced Vol. 1  Full of steps I like & use.
I was watching this video with a group of my Advanced social Lady dancers & within 2 minutes of this video playing Diana had all of us smiling & laughing. The interplay between Juan & Diana keep us smiling & laughing throughout this video. They are fun teachers who enjoy their Salsa dancing & teaching.
This couple are the first Salsa teachers I have seen on video that I would like to take classes with. Their Salsa classes must be fun.
Although this video is not called a Ladies Spin video I feel it is great for this. The video is full of double, triple & quadruple turns right up to the 20's + spins. Diana gives some great tips on Ladies spinning.
The video is also full of Ladies styling tips.
The step combinations are shown & taught on ONE  & on TWO so all dancers can learn the steps. The steps are danced to music on ONE & on TWO. This video teaches one of the most famous steps, the ""Coffee Grinder"". I have seen this step being taught in other Salsa videos but I like Juan & Diana version of teaching it the best.
As most of the steps in this video were being shown. The ladies with me were calling out, 'Neal's social'. Most of the steps in this video are what I like to use with my Advanced Social Ladies.
This video is full of steps I like to use. This video was like watching my favourite moves been shown. My styling is different than that used in this video so I was able to get some new endings or variations of the steps. As all the turn combinations are shown with several different styling & endings or versions you end up with some impressive steps.
The moves by Super Mario from England were nice.
The video is very good value for money. It is a good length & the picture quality is amazing.
This video is a great introduction to Advanced Salsa. I am looking forward to seeing their new videos they are producing this year 2002.",1012435200,5,4465,4.282840236686391
