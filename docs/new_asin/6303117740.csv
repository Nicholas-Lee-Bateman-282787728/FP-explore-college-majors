7838944,5,6303117740,"I first purchased this movie on VHS and I have played it so many times. I really enjoy listening to Bing Crosby's early voice when he was so much younger and also the songs he sang in this movie. Also there are George and Gracie (George Burns and Grace Allen, playing themselves). As many times as I have watched this movie I cannot tell if the bear is real or a human in a bear suit. I don't think the bear is listed in the credits. This is a great movie with an all star cast",1462838400,,477,3.9791666666666665

7838946,5,6303117740,"It is interesting to note that sound movies in 1929,i believe by wb was an innovation not unlike tv and at the time not all actors liked it. Some were making a very good living,the valentino and chaplin films were famous,and the whole industry revolved around the silent aspect of the film. But change was in the air,the change they thought would be good for film,bringing in music,many new actors and actresses, and make the stage like aspect to it something to look forward to. When sound was introduced many actors/actresses were given contracts of a few years,and if they didn't do well with the public,and prove to be stars were confined to 2 reelers and b movies,barely eking out a living. They weren't all millionaires,in hollywood many were not really making large salaries so in these contracts..they really had to prove to movie execs to give them a chance with 'sound'...and that's the way to look at these early films. Carole lombard was one of my favorite's in youth,her last film 'to be or not to be' should give her fame for that role alone,but in many film roles,which were not available on tv long ago,are making their way now. She was married to the famous clark gable,but she was just as renown. Their life was made into a tv film years later,which i saw and recall a good film. So this early film with bing crosby,'we're not dressing',was an early chance for both stars to prove to the film execs their value as stars. Bing sings many songs,the famous 'love thy neighbour' and their is the comic relief of burns and allen,however carole shines in this role and really proves why she became the big prewar star worldwide prior to ww2. She was not a comeddienne but actress she would say but a medium of 'screwball' comedies was built to make use of her talents,in which she gave unique expressions,physically,quirks,vanities putting the males leads off and they always come off second best to her. Her rapid fire delivery of lines and delivery and interactions won adulation and after her untimely death was sorely missed, and lucille ball probably was taught much comedic insights watching this actress, although not to the same effect,they say lucy was not in personal life funny. Of course we don't know. But the 6 movie retrospective of carol's films out now,too long delayed is one i surely will watch over and over,and it rekindles old memories and how often movies are often tailored and recreated around a personality...and showcases how those who made the transition from silent to sound performed this feat..and the many silent stars who couldnt...",1332460800,2,2577,4.806306306306307
7838947,4,6303117740,"WE'RE NOT DRESSING is a charming 1930s musical starring Bing Crosby, and is noteworthy for several songs, the legendary Broadway belter Ethel Merman and the comedic stylings of co-stars George Burns and Gracie Allen.
Bing Crosby plays Stephen Jones, a crooning deckhand of the yacht owned by charming society heiress Doris Worthington (Carole Lombard - MY MAN GODFREY, NOTHING SACRED).  Also on board are Doris' best friend Edith (Broadway's Ethel Merman) and the continually-sloshed Hubert (Leon Errol).  After Stephen and Doris clash several times during the voyage, he is fired, but not until a freak storm crashes the yacht and dumps all the occupants on a desert island. Also living on the island are George and Gracie (George Burns and Grace Allen, essentially playing themselves).
There are a few choice songs in this delightful musical, including ""Love Thy Neighbor"", ""May I?"", ""Once in a Blue Moon"" and ""She Reminds Me of You"".  Ethel Merman also impresses with her infectious number ""Spanish Custom"".
A lovely little movie indeed.",1052524800,8,1040,5.2155688622754495
7838948,5,6303117740,"MCA/Unicersal Clacssics have restored and re-released ""We're Not Dressing"" on home video.  This movie falls under the Bing Crosby Collection.
Early Crosby croons several catchy tunes in this semi-musical at sea comedy / love story.
Summary - Crosby a crooner deck hand on a millionairesses (Lombard) yacht.  Lombard (beautiful & funny) falls for Crosby but acts as the totally spoiled rich girl.  As all 1930's musical comedies we have a great supporting cast to include; comedians - Leon Errol, George Burns & Gracie Allen, a very young singing Ethel Merman.  A young Ray Milland trys to swoon Lombard.  This funny crew ship wrecks on an island & Crosby becomes the ""IN-Charge"" go to guy.  This is some funny stuff with catchy tunes to beat.
An original trailer is included.  Enjoy this 1935 Hollywood Film with Crosby & Lombard.",1048204800,2,830,4.971014492753623
7838949,4,6303117740,"The beautiful, multi-talented Lombard plays Doris Worthington, a beautiful but spoiled heiress, who is being courted by Princes Michael and Alexander Stofani on her private yacht. Bored with her aristocratic life, Doris begins a cheeky alliance with a poor singer named Stephen Jones - Bing, naturally. It's one of those comedy romances in which the two mis-matched parties fall in love and strive to mend their differences - for better or for worse. Charming and beautifully photographed, it shows the two stars at their most appealing. Some scenes were filmed on Catalina Island and reviews of the day widely compared this film's plot with a 1902 play by a Sir James M. Barrie entitled THE ADMIRABLE CRICHTON.",1043712000,,711,5.085470085470085
7838950,4,6303117740,"I remember first seeing this one as a kid and been on the prowl for it ever since.
For fans of Bing this is a must.
His voice is still new (1934), crisp and delightful.
Burns & Allen are up to thier usual madness.
An all around good film.
Basic plot: Carole is a spoiled rich girl with her posse on an ocean liner. Bing is a lowly cabin boy who runs into trouble with her (love that ""smacking"" scene). When the boat is shipwrecked they land on an island where Burns & Allen are horticulturists(!) and love blooms!
That's all I'll tell you!
Give it a try, you're sure to enjoy.",1002499200,15,576,4.151785714285714
