2088898,4,B0002F6B3I,I saw this movie that the Pan AFrican Movie Festival early this year at the Magic Johnson Theathre. I think younger adults  as well as older adults in  long term relationships will really enjoy this movie. Hill Harper is actor that doesn't stick to one type of acting genre so in this role he plays is very convincing. The movie points out that if you so caught up in looking at one thing it's hard to change the out look to something different. I hope alot of young adults buy this movie,1088985600,,488,4.293478260869565

2088910,5,B0002F6B3I,I watch this movie as often as I can.  I fell in love with the interaction between the two actors (the couple in the movie) back in 2006 when I used to watch it on the premium channels repeatedly.,1357948800,,196,4.0256410256410255

2088912,4,B0002F6B3I,The FIRST movie that's even come close to the way Love Jones made me feel when I first saw it.  Such a perfect movie for discussion. We make relationships so much more complicated than they should be; but we can't help it.,1311552000,,222,4.285714285714286

2088914,4,B0002F6B3I,"I really enjoyed this movie. It was funny and dealt with real issues. The jamaican friend is fine, and his accent it hot. He played on Seventeen Again with the Mowry twins. Watch it, you'll like it.",1206144000,,198,4.378378378378378
2088915,4,B0002F6B3I,Great film on a topic not explored enough....porn addiciton. Now it's not a heavy subject but gives you just enough.  It's film about a young woman (the lovely Marlyne Afflack) who meets a man and learns that he has an issue.  It depict's scenes where Harpers character cannot perform for a real woman but can get it up for his films.  You really get to see how much his life is affected by it when he sees an attractive woman pass by and automatically goes to 'rewind' her passing by again. The beginning is somewhat immature but it gets better as the film progresses.  Good laughs and some good diaglogue into how the 2 main characters deal with eachother. The supporting characters also do a great job as well as the subject matter outside of the 2 main characters. You also get to witness some Jamaican culture as seen with some characters and the dancehall club scene.,1189814400,2,873,4.54140127388535
2088916,4,B0002F6B3I,The title doesn't do this movie any justice.  It has a great plot that will carry you through the end.,1183248000,,102,4.1

2088918,5,B0002F6B3I,"I can honestly admit that at some point in my life I suffered from the same problem as Micheal, which made me buy the movie in the first place I was suprised at how well the movie was written, and how well it address the subject of  how detrimental porn can be to a healthy relationship. Kudos to the stars and Kudos to the director for making a film like this.  I suggest every man at some point in his life take a good hard look at this movie.",1124755200,19,445,3.9887640449438204
2088929,5,B0002F6B3I,"This movie is hilarious and will have you cracking up with each scene. It is funny, yet romantic at the same time.",1122854400,14,114,4.2272727272727275
2088930,4,B0002F6B3I,"As a fan of Barenaked Ladies and expecially Ed Robertson I decided to check out this film.  Since no one else has commented, I'd just like to say that Ed Robertson's performance was fun, and for any BNL fans out there, well worth checking out.  The rest of the film is not bad, if a little heavy handed at times.  It still has a message worth saying, and pokes lighthearted fun at people's hang ups.",1119830400,5,399,4.293333333333333
2088931,5,B0002F6B3I,"I have a Movie Pass that allows me to rent unlimited movies per month. With this freedom, I Find myself trying out obscure films that I would not have otherwise.

This was one film that does not deserve its obscure status. Its well-written, funny, and engaging. Plus ""Jasmine (maralyn afflack)"" just may be THE most beautiful woman on EARTH. My god.

It was also nice to see a sister that was willing to accept a brother for what he wants to become, not for what he is (a lowly security guard).

This movie has official displaced Love Jones as my favorite black romantic comedy.

Anyway.. its well worth your dime.",1119225600,12,614,4.554545454545455

The provocatively titled ""Love, Sex and Eating the Bones"" is a tale about sexual frustration involving a man addicted to porn and a woman with a decidedly more conservative view of making love.  The curious twist is that it is the woman who wants to get down-and-dirty in the sack and the man who finds himself unable to rise to the occasion.

Michael is an aspiring photographer who works as a security guard at a local parking garage.  Jasmine is a successful ad agency executive who has sworn off both men and sex since her last abortive relationship two years ago.  The two find themselves falling in love with one another but hit a rocky patch when Michael turns out to be impotent - at least when it comes to having to perform with a flesh-and-blood human being.

""Love, Sex and Eating the Bones"" starts off as a sub-par, utterly conventional romantic comedy, but just when you're about to give up on it, it takes a daring and much appreciated detour into some previously unexplored territory.  This is the first film I can remember to feature impotence as a major plot point and the first to acknowledge the detrimental effect that pornography can have on real-world relationships.  That the film does so in the context of a romantic comedy in no way diminishes its value and, in fact, makes the topics more palatable and approachable than they might otherwise be.  Moreover, the film is blessed with two extremely likable stars as its protagonists, Hill Harper and Marlyne Afflack, who tackle the tricky subject matter with charm and grace.  Some may see the humor in the film as vulgar and crude at times, but I tend to think of it as realistic, accurately capturing the ways in which couples talk and deal with one another in the modern world.  This turns out to be a better film than one might initially suspect.",1109289600,55,1831,4.65527950310559
2088935,5,B0002F6B3I,"I originally thought I would be somewhat disappointed in this movie, because of the movie title. However, I rented it because I am a fan of Hill Harper. I was wonderfully surprised! This is a great movie to watch. Hill Harper was outstanding as usual and so were the other actors. The storyline is good and entertaining right up to the very end. This movie is a must see and I do plan to purchase this movie for my personal movie library. Kudos to sexy Hill Harper and the rest of the cast!",1099267200,,490,4.279569892473118
2088936,5,B0002F6B3I,"This was a great movie about a guy who had lost touch with the world.  He lived on porno's and worked as a security guard while trying to get his photography off the ground.  This is another boy meets girl movie, except in this case the boy is a grown (...) man who gets a boost of reality with the help and care of a upper class exec woman.............................But no relationship is perfect without its bumps and bruises along the way..........................great movie good acting from Hill Harper who plays the (...) out of touch with reality lead.  Great supporting acting as well, the dude from Barenaked Ladies is in this movie too I believe, I like how this movie isn't over-acted with the usual top stars.  At the end of watching this, it feels very real and life mimicking.....................GREAT JOB!",1096502400,7,822,4.85

But it's very sweet, being a Haitian  woman I was super excited to see a gorgeous Haitian playing one of the leads. I also liked the Jamaican BFF, he was hilarious and gorgeous. This movie also taught a lesson and the dance scene was hot. I lost track of how many times I've seen this film.

8027480,5,B0002F6B3I,"What a couragous effort for Mr. Hill Harper. Many men would never think to speak about such a problem but here you have one of Black Hollywood's favorite actor/producers taking on a subject matter and does such a fantastic job at helping the director tell the story, its unbelieveable!!! Great co-star Marlyn Afflack helps make the two a perfect pair!!!",1386201600,,353,4.9
