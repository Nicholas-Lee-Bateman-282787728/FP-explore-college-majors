8620081,5,B00G1L6VXC,"This is just the sweetest thing ever. Both of them are adorable, and out standing, the only thing missing was Willie's sister. It certainly displyed Leon's ability and command of the piano. His signature trade mark.",1431907200,,215,5.0
8620082,1,B00G1L6VXC,"This isn't about the music, it's about the rip-off. Leon & Willie great.  The DVD says it's 5.1 but it's stereo only and bad stereo at that with really high backgound noise.  Sound pretty bad.  This is a crappy version of the DVD Willie Nelson & Leon Russell - One for the Road.  That has 5.1 sound and actually sounds pretty good.  Both have the same same song listing but the crap DVD with the last tune missing.  The video isn't as good either nor the editing.  I guess if you are absolutely desperate to see them and can't get One for the Road this might be sort of work.  But the other is wayyyyyyy better.  As I said crap because they're crapping on you with this release for a buck.  At least that's the way I feel about it and they didn't have to.",1414972800,6,755,4.144827586206897
8620083,5,B00G1L6VXC,"I love seeing old footage of Leon Russell performing and I love that this includes Willie, also. I don't know if this is a re-release, but that's just fine with me as I didn't get it when it originally came out so this is great for a new generation to be educated on the great Leon Russell.",1389657600,8,290,4.105263157894737
8620084,5,B00G1L6VXC,"This is a great assortment of songs sung and accompanied on piano by Leon Russell and Willie Nelson. I have not ever seen all of these songs available on one CD or vinyl and I have been a major Leon Russell fan for as far back as I care to remember! He is one of the all-time great pianists (Elton John agrees) and his concerts are a very special experience, especially since Leon is sick with some chronic condition that seems to deplete his energy by the time the concert's over. But there's no cheating his audience. He sings and plays and gives a full show, then afterwards, as he walks slowly towards his van, we knew he was completely given out, and respect and care about him way too much to start a conversation. Just walking near him, you can sense that this is not just any ordinary person, but someone who has given so much through his music to so many folks. By the way, when he climbed into his road van, his bass player told us that Leon would be glad to autograph something for us, but he wouldn't be coming out to talk. Talk about generosity! I would definitely recommend this CD to anyone who is a Leon or a Willie fan. It's a great selection of songs that may be on other CDs, but these are all on this one. For $6.99. Who else will sell a CD for that amount? He is all about giving and I, for one, am very grateful for the inspiration that he has provided through the years and for his desire to share his wonderful music with anyone who wants to listen. Put me in the front row, please!",1388707200,15,1506,4.196551724137931
8620085,1,B00G1L6VXC,"How many times can something get re-re-re-re-re-re-released?!?!?!?  This is a disgusting release titled The Early Days Leon Russell and Willie Nelson....giving the impression that it's a documentary.  There is a snapshot of Willie on the back playing to a large crowd, so maybe it's a concert of Leon and Willie.  This is false advertising, this product has been released various times throughout the years.  It's the Willie and Leon in studio concert jam where each one of them, more Willie than Leon, offer new live in the studio takes on their own classics, as well as other country classics and standards.  If you are a fan of either Willie and / or Leon you have seen this before....don't be fooled by deceptive marketing and false advertisement!",1388102400,25,751,4.928571428571429
