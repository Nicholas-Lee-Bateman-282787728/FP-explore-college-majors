8530546,5,B008UIARYI,"My favourite documentary subject is ""Military History"". This is a must for anyone interested in Military History. My collection begins with the Greeks, Romans and the Dark ages through to Medieval British history. Including the Boar war, Vietnam, WW1, WW2, The English Civil war in 1600's with the killing of a reigning English king Charles 1st. The American Civil war in the 1800's,the earlier conflict when the US fought with the British 100 years before in the 1700's. Of course General Custer and the Red Indians etc etc on and on. I now have trouble with storage and must purchase another DVD holder. The only war docu. i do not have is Korea, the forgotten war. I watch the MASH series daily and that is hilarious.
Warlords: the Generals is a very informative inclusion to my collection of War History. It is worth getting if you are interested in military history. I love it.",1356220800,,882,4.733766233766234
