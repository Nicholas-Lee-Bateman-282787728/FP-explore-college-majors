7857802,5,6303975720,This is the first video on playing the Bodhran I purchased.  It is the best one of 3 that I own.  I would rate the Tommy Hayes tape a close second and the Chris Caswell tape next to useless. If this tape becomes available on DVD I would purchase it again because I have about worn out my VHS copy.,1357603200,3,297,3.933333333333333
