8620865,2,B00G575P9S,"I have worked out with Gilad for over 25 years as a primary and supplement workout. He is great and his reputation precedes it's self.....with that said, I gave it two stars because these segments are from his first season, which you can buy on line for $1.99 each. Don't be deceived by the 2014 release date. These segments are not new!",1391644800,5,337,4.451612903225806
