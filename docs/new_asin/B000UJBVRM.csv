8213413,4,B000UJBVRM,"I love this movie, I even turned my kids on to it, its corny stupid the dub is horrible, the acting is subpar and the plot is borderline retarded. An instant classic!!!

 This particular DVD doesn't have any sound or subtitle options.  Picture quality is about a 4 out of 10.  The dub VHS copy I had looked better then this, until the lines of despair started to overtake the tape.  None the less, i still like this movie, hell it was only a buck!",1268870400,,447,4.211764705882353
