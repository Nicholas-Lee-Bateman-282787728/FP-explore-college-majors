3747616,5,B001PJRAT4,"I believe that this DVD has touched up on the where we are and where we can go. It gives us a view into a possible future beyond the face of our planet. I enjoyed how it was presented in content and also believe that we will likely take this type of path to the beyond in the years ahead. The key players in the DVD are cutting edge people. The industry needs more of them I think. This is a must have DVD. Thanks, Rick L.",1357862400,10,422,3.8620689655172415
3747617,5,B001PJRAT4,"This is a great collection of space history. I hope all elementary children get to see this. It is interesting to see how exciting exploration forcasts from just a few years ago are already foiled, coincidental to the greedy wall street housing crash that robbed the world economy of money. Of special note is the emotional love of space exploration expressed in the X prize Black Sky episode by the pilot's trust and his wife.",1331424000,3,427,4.706666666666667
3747618,4,B001PJRAT4,"The collection contains six presentations, including ""BLACK SKY"" an excellent documentary of Burt Rutan's development of Space Ship One, and ""BASE CAMP MOON"" which reviews future returns to the moon and development of a moon base. There are four other interesting Space Exploration presentations you may have missed from the Science Channel.",1322524800,9,341,5.576923076923077

8333469,3,B001PJRAT4,"Ugh. Sorry, Mr. Michener's heirs. I cut my teeth on Hawaii when I was ten. I think my biggest problem with Space is that I have already seen tons of documentaries about the space program. However, if I hadn't - this book would have brought me up to speed wonderfully and with terrific scientific and political fact. I am glad I read it, albeit skimming 100 of the last 150 pages, but admittedly, it was a chore to finish. I respect this author immensely, so I'll leave it at: Great Information on our space program and it's politics.",1482192000,,533,4.448979591836735
