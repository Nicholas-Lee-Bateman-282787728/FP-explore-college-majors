The previous reviewers are correct: unknown writers and musicians stating the obvious, or the obviously wrong, about the Stones' music. What's perhaps just as annoying are the grainy clips drawn almost solely from the Ed Sullivan Show, the legendary Stones in the Park show, and Gimme Shelter in its unrestored form. Who put this together? Why does this film exist? Why so much emphasis on ""Have You Seen Your Mother Baby"" and scarcely anything about ""Sympathy for the Devil""? Who decided ""Love in Vain"" and the Chuck Berry classics ""Little Queenie"" and ""Oh Carol"" are weak moments and ""filler""? Does anyone beside the mumbling talking heads in this film really believe that? And since when does ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" supposedly ""belong"" to the rhythm guitarist Mick Taylor, who wasn't even in the group until a year after the song was recorded? These and other knuckleheaded judgments can all be found on this mediocre DVD, which isn't even recommended for the most ardent Stones completist. Gack.",1303344000,4,1097,4.967391304347826

8129891,1,B000GAKP3G,"Rented this recently and thought I stumbled upon the actual 1969 MSG concerts as seen in the movie GIMME SHELTER. Not to be. Just a bunch of no name writers, musicians, and other critics commenting on partial videos from the 60's. Would love to see those concerts on DVD one day.

Save your money and stay away.",1175385600,9,311,4.456140350877193
