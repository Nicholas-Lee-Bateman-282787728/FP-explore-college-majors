2548079,5,B000F1IO3E,"""The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things"" is based on a novel by JT Leroy and is co-written and directed by Asia Argento, daughter of Dario Argento.

I'd never heard of the book, I've never heard of JT Leroy...But what I've gathered was, Leroy published this novel as a memoir only to reveal years later that it's fictional. Well, good things it's fictional because this movie is several kinds of screwed up. Very few times have I had a hard time watching a film, but this is one of those movies. It's very effective, very disturbing, very well acted, and, somehow, very entertaining. Asia Argento (who was Vin Diesel's love interest in ""XXX"") stars as Sarah, a drugged out cliche for the term ""white trash"". Sarah had a son when she was 15, the son has lived with foster parents and she finally gets custody of the child. The child is Jeremiah (who's played by Jimmy Bennet, Cole Sprouse, & Dylan Sprouse).

Jeremiah is quiet, his lack of dialogue is huge throughout the movie, but he is frequently subjected to abuse and neglect at both the hands of his mother and her various boyfriends. When he's molested by one of her boyfriends (Jeremy Renner, who played Jeffrey Dahmer in ""Dahmer""), he is sent to live with his grandparents. Turns out this little group of religious fanatics aren't much better than Sarah, in fact the abuse factor gets worse here. Grandfather is played by Peter Fonda who is marvelously sadistic. But, anyways, after living with the grandparents for three years...Sarah returns to get the boy back and she's not in much better shape than she was originally. There's not much more to say about the plot, except a makeup-less Marilyn Manson turns up as Jackson, another boyfriend, and is onscreen for only a few moments but actually proves his chops as an actor (something ""Party Monster"" hardly gave him the chance to do). The movie has a great cast that ranges from Michael Pitt (The Village, The Dreamers), Jeremy Sisto (May, Thirteen), Kip Pardue (Thirteen), and even at one point a chick I would swear is Winona Ryder but apparently isn't. Anyway, despite that this movie is fictional (as I said) it is extremely effective. The movie covers grounds on abuse that few books would go over. It's not for everybody, but if you're looking for an intense and dark film...It's right here.

2548080,5,B000F1IO3E,"I have never written a review on anything, but this move is so startling and unflinching- it totally captures the horror of the book. I am now a huge fan of Asia Argento.",1149984000,6,170,4.181818181818182
2548081,1,B000F1IO3E,I happened upon a theatrical trailer for this movie and must say that the Sprouse brothers parents are not very discerning.  Good parents would never allow their children to act in such a movie.  This is unfortunate for Dylan and Cole.,1149724800,6,235,4.7073170731707314
2548082,3,B000F1IO3E,"Asia Argenta's ""Heart"" is from the grand guignol school of film making.  She deserves credit for attempting to film J.T. LeRoy's cult novel, and her own performance, along with those of the boys who play Jeremiah, is indeed brave, but I am disappointed by the result.  To begin with, the story arc of the novel is lost.  We are simply thrust into Jeremiah's sick world without any sense of context.  Given the fact that this ""true"" story is anything but, perhaps Argenta was right to leave out the frame story of teenage Jeremiah's penchant for S&M, but others of the stories are missing as well.  That the focus has shifted from Jeremiah to Sarah is not so much an indictment of Argenta's own ego as it is a tribute to her failure to deal with some of the more unsavory aspects of the orginal story.  Finally, the packaging of the DVD demands some comment.  Apparently, a lot of celebrities and others who were duped by the LeRoy saga are now saying they were entertained by the hoax.  So be it.  But it's unconscionable of the producers to exploit that fact as a marketing ploy.  To sum up, this is not a bad movie, but it represents an opportunity lost.  A better movie might have moved JT or Speedy or whoever the author is a bit further down the road to redemption.",1149552000,20,1270,4.454545454545454
2548083,5,B000F1IO3E,"I will admit that I walked in a bit cautiously when i went to view this film because of all the negative criticisms it received. I loved Scarlet Diva but felt it techinically lacked the goods to be a really good underground movie. So I was cautious with Asia Argento's follow-up.
All I can say after viewing it is that the critics got it wrong because it is a good film. Asia Argento shows a lot of promise with this one as a director and i look forward to her next project.
This film is raw and gritty and without those elements it would've gone nowhere. This film will take you somewhere trust me...even if it's a bad place it'll still be a necessary trip!
Oh and yes, I now know for sure that Asia Argento would be the only chick I'd go str8 for. ;)",1147996800,9,752,4.157534246575342
2548084,5,B000F1IO3E,"It is not surprising to me that the critics couldn't handle this movie. This movie wears no gloves. This movies is only for the hard core, for those who don't shy away from the dirty truth. I must admit, this film isn't an easy watch. It isn't a movie you put on in the back ground during a fondue party. You don't put it on low in your kid's room after you put them to bed for the night. This isn't that type of movie. This movie challenges you, like a good book would, it leaves a scar, a lasting impression. So if you want to watch a great film and you're not a pansy, you should see this one, as soon as possible!",1147132800,14,617,3.9838709677419355
2548085,5,B000F1IO3E,"Asia Argento was the perfect pick to direct this film. The final product displays Argento's dedication to the spirit of the book. The film is raw and gritty, just like the work of Laura Albert. Unlike the Hollywood movies that the slumbering American audience has grown accustomed to, this film explores the dark crevices of human experience. Works like this one help people like you and me come to terms with life's less kind aspects, the things which we experience or know of that we aren't allowed to talk about. These things shouldn't be confined to the shrink's office, but should be explored in art. It is high time we stop feeling so ashamed of the things which give us depth, the things which complete the human experience. This work is heart breaking but it is also therapeutic. It is definitely one of my favorite movies of the year.",1147132800,16,843,4.6644295302013425
2548086,5,B000F1IO3E,"this film was trashed by many, but the truth is, it is truly one of a kind.  i've never seen anything like it before and because of the way this story was directed, i've never been affected by a film like this one before.

im sick and tired of films being typecasted into genres like action,drama, adventure.

 this film should be classified under ""truth"" because it's the reality of things.  asia argento didn't hold back her vision for the audience, the audience had to adjust to her, as every director should strive to do.",1146614400,12,525,4.542553191489362
2548087,5,B000F1IO3E,"this movie is awesome, i see it last week and I think that Asia Argento knows perfectly how to show the reality, this movie is so impressive  and the kids in the movie do a excellent work, Jimmy Bennet work is wonderful and the sprouse twins take the movie to a higher level. you should see it, but the movie is not recommended for kids because the movie is very realistic and very graphical, too much explicit",1146441600,14,410,4.324675324675325
2548088,5,B000F1IO3E,"Finally! Finally! Finally! After two years of knowing about this film I have so longed to see it!. However its already available on dvd in the foreign countries, what the hell? What attracted me to the film first off was Lydia Lunch, who has an appearance and/or few appearances in this film. Than the trailer of this film finally showed up on the net and it looks like a very dramatizing film. It sux that I live in a small college town that doesnt get such films like this (Indie). Another film that I'd like to see get a dvd distribution deal with ms. lunch in it is the documentary called, ""Kill Your Idols"" Ironically sounds like it was taken from the sonic youth song. Again there's archive footage of Lunch's no wave band ""Teenage Jesus And The Jerks"" as well as an appearance by Karen O. Of the ""Yeah Yeah Yeahs"" plus abunch of other 70's punk bands. Also made in 2004 I might add. Sux cuz I'm a film projectionist myself and yet all we get here in the small town of Lubbock, TX. is crappy hollywood duds, one right after the other. Also, when is hollywood gonna stop makin these rediculous RE-MAKES! I hope the book is as good as the film will be ""The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things"".",1144800000,10,1198,4.352678571428571

A survival story with a boy adjusting to each new circumstance all of which were crazy adult situations and environments he is subjected to. Trying his best to do what each adult required in their interpretation of what was right. I didn't find him to have gender confusion at all. He just did what his mother told him to do.  She played dressup & make up  with him, amusing herself rather than him, as a mother would a daughter. That was about her not him. It was his mothers game that she failed to explain to him. I would guess that she abused him and abandoned, much as she was, constantly. She wanted him to be her toy that she could leave behind without a thought and then drag out when she felt like it. He never really had any idea what normal was. No kid does.  I could see her in similar circumstances with her father, trying to please him in whatever scenario he required and then blaming  her for his creative parenting. Kids are just trying to survive as best they can and look to the parents for what is expected. It's all a play of no sense.",1478822400,7,1108,4.261904761904762

2548104,4,B000F1IO3E,"Powerful movie!! But the movie wasn't as horrific -to me-as other reviewers describe it. The mother doesn't physically beat him I think she is just truly messed up and mentally I'll drug addicted lost soul...she straight up tells him she didn't want the responsibility of raising a kid... On the other hand, she claims him as hers and always comes back for him. She has the chance to leave him to her crazy religious parents and goes looking for him right where they used to force her to stand and preach. To me I felt like she meant well but was just too screwed up to even know what that was. She has drug crazed psychotic fits and then another scene she is smiling and cuddling him... Other times she is giving him drugs and not noticing him being molested. But in the end, she always came back. I think there are more people than we think that really do grow up like this.

2548109,5,B000F1IO3E,"Nine Things About the Film ""The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things""

1. This is the film version of the super-depressing, controversial cult novel by J.T. Leroy (the bizarre story of the author is a completely different topic). While the book consists of 10 distinct but connected short stories, the movie sews them all together into a more-or-less coherent story.

2. This low-budget, independent movie follows the childhood of a boy named Jeremiah, and how he is repeatedly abused and dehumanized in just about every way, by just about every adult in his life, as his mentally unstable mother wrecks their world.

3. The movie should come with a trigger warning for child abuse.

4. It was directed by Asia Argento, the daughter of the super-famous Italian movie-maker Dario. Asia stars in the movie as the mother, Sarah (although for most of the movie I thought Uma Thurman was playing the role).

5. The acting in this movie is amazing. Argento is furiously effective as the crazy drug addict prostitute who is unable to stop emotionally abusing her son. And Jimmy Bennett gives a heart-stopping performance as the 7-year-old Jeremiah (Bennett has gone on to have a real acting career, but he deserves more recognition).

6. There are cameos and small roles by a number of actors who are famous in their own circles; Jeremy Sisto, Ben Foster, and Michael Pitt (more hardcore indie film fans will recognize Kip Pardue and John Robinson). Peter Fonda is notable as Jimmy's grandfather, the abusive head of a religious cult. Fans of Jeremy Renner may be surprised to know that way before he became a superhero, he was a child molester in this movie. Winona Ryder has a great few minutes playing an insensitive social worker.

7. The movie follows Jeremiah's mental confusion and developmental problems with more guts than most movies about child abuse. One of the emotional climaxes of the movie is a very disturbing encounter with trailer-park-trash Marilyn Manson.

8. By the time the movie spirals into a gender-bending, poison-filled psychological implosion, you see that Jeremiah's dehumanization is a symptom of a more wide-spread sickness of society in general (in a super-meta literary technique, Jeremiah himself is a symbol of the Bible verse that inspired the title of the book and movie).

9. The movie is hard to watch, but it's also almost impossible to turn away. An underground classic with a surprising cast, this is one of the best films I've seen about the mutilation of innocence, and the tragic ways that kids can adapt to almost anything.",1440806400,2,2562,4.953379953379954

2548114,5,B000F1IO3E,"I'm about twenty minutes into this movie and all I want to know is WHO DECIDED TO TURN MY CHILDHOOD INTO A MOVIE? And where are my royalties?
The main reason I am even writing a review on this movie (aside from the fact that it's an incredible movie of course) is because of a review from another customer. She spoke of how disturbed she was by the movie, how she was in tears as she wrote her review. She talked about how the things from the movie would haunt her 'for the rest of her life'. And I guess I can see how a delicate flower might wilt under the kind of issues this movie deals in...especially if that flower were nurtured from a high ivory tower as she must've been.
HOWEVER, she went a little bit further and spoke of how ""low income"" & ""low educated"" people shouldn't be parents...as the results would surely be horrendous. And warned people away from the movie. Well this is exactly how I grew up...I was on my own at 13....managed to finish school, get a job, go on to college to earn a degree in forensics.

This is a work of fiction. And it is incredible. And it scalds you with the truth that art can and often does exactly imitate life. But you don't have to weep for those poor kids or wail of the injustice of uneducated kids. Your tears won't feed them and a wail won't hug them, keep them warm...or educate them.
The movie has heart, and teeth...sharp ones. I recommend it to everyone because it doesn't hide behind some shiny veneer of the educated,  rich people who do their dirt in the dark",1425772800,6,1518,4.285714285714286

2548120,1,B000F1IO3E,Very dark film. Not my cup of tea. Read the book. Should have known better. Disturbing content viewer discretion is advised.,1403654400,3,124,4.9523809523809526
2548121,5,B000F1IO3E,This movie can anger you and confuse you all at the same time Asia Argento did a wonderful job on this movie,1403395200,,108,3.9545454545454546
2548122,3,B000F1IO3E,"There is a very noticeable continuance error about five minutes into the film, it is not really a big problem just very noticeable. Sarah is sitting on the couch wearing a tee-shirt and panties. When she first sits down the tail of her shirt stops at her waist and her legs are spread apart fully exposing her panties. The scene switched briefly to Jeremiah then back to Sarah, she has not changed the way she is sitting but her tee-shirt is now stretched out over her left knee. After another quick switch to Jeremiah and back to Sarah she is still sitting in the same position, but her shirt tail is back off of her knee, but she now has her hand pulling down the center of her shirt tail over the front of her panties. The camera zooms in a little each time it switches back to Sarah therefore showing less of her panties but I do not consider that a continuance error, only the moving shirt tail.

A bigger problem for me was that I could not understand all lines of dialog in the movie. I think it was intentional for Jeremiah to mumble from time to time, both while played by Bennett and by the Sprouse twins, but I would still like to know what he was saying. If the DVD had either closed captions or subtitles it would not be as big a problem, however, the DVD has neither closed captions nor subtitles.

But my biggest problem with this movie comes from a what I believe was a reliance by the screenplay writer and director (Asia Argento) on the audience having already read the books.
I never read the books, nor did I even read a summary or review of them before purchasing this DVD. I did hear the news stories of the hoax when it was discovered that J.T. LeRoy never existed, however, since I had never before then heard of him or his books, I quickly forgot about the story. I did not realize that this movie was related to that hoax and remember the news story until I watched the extras on the DVD.
The first part of the movie (while Jimmy Bennett is playing Jeremiah) is easy enough to follow, and to a large extent is the most emotional part of the movie. The emotion coming mainly from the empathy the viewers have for the innocent seven year old boy while watching what he is going through. From what I have read since watching the movie, this section of the movie covers about two years. The passage of that much time is not clear from just watching the movie.
After the Sprouse twins assume the role of Jeremiah the relationship between Jeremiah and his mother changes and this is where the movie does not get the full story across. I can not really explain it but somehow the new relationship does not come across on an emotional level. The commentary track on the DVD fills in some of the blanks, but that is not the same.

One other thing worth noting, despite the subject matter of the movie, no sex, abuse nor nudity by the actors is shown in the movie. There is a brief shot of a wall papered with cutouts from an adult magazines but even most of these pictures did not show full nudity. Asia Argento pushes the limit on how close she can come to being nude without technically being nude, but is never actually seen nude. When Jeremiah is being abused, both physically and sexually, and even when the doctors stitch up the damage from the sexual abuse, the movie switches to imagery of red crows to signify the abuse. I rather liked the red crow imagery, however, I felt that the movie may have used the imagery to be a little over conservative in what was actually shown.
There is also a sequence where Jeremiah (played by one of the Sprouse twins) dresses like his mother and pretends to be his mother. In the early part of this sequence when Jeremiah looks in the mirror he sees his mother (the reflection is Asia). This I considered good imagery, however as the sequence continues Asia takes over the roll of Jeremiah. I felt it would have been better to have one of the Sprouse twins continue with the sequence and just use Asia as the mirror image he sees.",1401840000,2,3991,4.376010781671159

It also makes me sad for humanity and I'm actually crying tears right now for all of the poor innocent kids that have to go through the wretched awful experiences like Jeremiah. I've read the book, it was sad and heartbreaking, but somehow watching the movie was just too much of a downer and too unbearable for me.

Afterwards you will be depressed and feel completely helplessly despondent like I am now. All of the unfit parents out there in our world today, like the wretched sorry excuse for a human being Sarah DO NOT deserve to have kids, low-income low-inteligence people that abuse drugs and are psycho crazy, again like Sarah, and even the nutcase grandparents just make me weep for society and all its problems with poor childrearing.

I probably wouldn't recommend that you watch this with your parents. A drug-addict/hooker named Sarah takes her son, Jeremiah back, but he doesn't like her, so he runs away. Sarah finds him and gets with an abusive guy that rapes and beats Jeremiah. Jeremiah is sent to live with Sarah's God-obsessed parents. After three years, Sarah is back and takes Jeremiah with her again. Sarah soon realizes that if she is going to keep her men, then she cannot say Jeremiah is her son, so she persuades him to cross dressing. It's too bad that Marilyn Manson only had a 5 minute cameo, because he was really good. Sarah and Jeremiah go into hiding because she thinks everyone is after them. She makes him think that certain foods are poisoned and makes him drink ipecac. Asia Argento, and the Sprouse brothers did an awesome job. Asia also did a great job at directing.

She becomes a prostitute, performs as a stripper, steals, does drugs and booze.  She gives him drugs, lies to him, abuses him, and dresses up up like a girl.  He's also whipped.  He's briefly taken by his Christian conservative grandparents, where the boy witnesses more whipping.

Long periods of boredom, punctuated by moments of intense distaste.

What's the rational for filming this story?  Well, it's based on a true story; how the boy eventually had a sex change ... oh wait, that's right.  The ""true story"" turned out to be a HOAX.  The author was born a female, and her book is a lie.

Which brings me to the funniest part in this DVD -- the special features, wherein director/star Asia Argento, when asked if she's bothered by filming a hoax (they discovered this two months into filming), says, ""Oh, no.  Everything's a lie.  What's truth?  I'm lying to you now.  We all lie.""

And all the other participants go on about how ""it's even better that it's based on a lie,"" yada, yada.

I don't believe them.  They sound like the clueless band on Spinal Tap.  Ian Smith comes out with the dreadful black album cover, and they're all saying, ""It's like a black mirror,"" and ""How much more black can it be, and the answer is, none.""

Only one band member has the brains to say, ""Is that good?  You all sound like you're rationalizing, like this is something you did on purpose.  I think we're stuck with a very dismal, stupid album cover.""

Likewise, I think the filmmakers found out, to their horror, that the basis for their film was a lie, but the money was spent; they were already filming.  So all the lawyers and agents and executives huddled, and after threats of lawsuits were bandied about, everyone came to a settlement about how they'd spin this to the public.  So now the lying author, and director Asia Argento, and everyone else is spinning from the same page, pretending that this is all wonderful and the film is ""even better"" that it's not true.

Excuse me, but much of the power of SCHINDLER'S LIST and GLORY is that they are based on truth.  If those stories were to be hoaxes, the films would lose much power.  So too this film.  That's how truth works.

Marilyn Manson fans have expressed disappointment over Manson's brief cameo.  I can empathize.  I only got this film because Winona Ryder is listed at the IMDB as being in it.  And she is -- for all of about two minutes.  Tellingly, while Ryder is in the DVD insert promo booklet, her name is not on the film's credits.

While some might disparage the film's lack of a ""central theme"" or ""story arc,"" the collaged images become both dissociative and fanciful, sparing The Heart is Deceitful from an emotional realism that would be excruciating for viewers, given the film's subject matter.  At times, the children's acting is uneven because of poor direction and the actors's probable ignorance of the film's true narrative, but Argento is convincing as a beautifully damaged Southern- trash drug addict from the first to the last frame.  Well-placed props tag several of Sarah's boyfriends as Vietnam vets, subtly weaving the theme of post traumatic stress disorder into a tale of trauma and abuse, and the film's score is a perfect counterpoint, never overwhelming and often provocative.

2548150,4,B000F1IO3E,"The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things (Asia Argento, 2004)

I've watched a lot of horror movies over the years. Most have all the horror of a dull toothache. Some are disturbing in various degrees. A select few have actually managed to scare me. As with all things, though, the truly scary films-- Johnny Got His Gun, for example-- are not traditional horror films. I say this by explanation of the statement that the opening scene of The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things, in all its banality, before we have any idea who these people are or any idea of their relationship beyond what we can infer from their sexes and ages, is arguably the most terrifying scene I have ever watched. In comparison, a couple of hours previously I'd watched Jenifer, a short film by Asia Argento's father Dario. In my Jenifer review, I was planning on calling it one of the most disturbing experiences I'd ever had with a movie. Then I watched the first five minutes of this flick, and that went out the window.

Argento (Asia, this time) shoots the scene with the documentarian feel of a Lindsay Anderson or an Errol Morris-- there's no camera trickery, no out-of-the-ordinary dialogue, no weird set design, there are just two people, whom we assume (rightly, we find out) are mother and son. The fear-- the pure, visceral ugliness that telegraphs in no uncertain terms that neither of these two characters will survive this movie in any real sense (and as I write this, to head off spoiler comments, I will say that I have not finished the movie; I was so affected by the first scene, and some of those that followed, I had to stop watching halfway through, and will finish it tonight)-- comes solely from the mundanity of the set, which could be any messy little house in any part of the country, and the raw power displayed by Asia Argento and Jimmy Bennett playing two people who loathe each other to depths that most of us can't begin to comprehend, and yet realize that they're supposed to love one another. And the movie gets worse from there.

Argento plays Sarah, mother to Jeremiah, played by Bennett as a boy and Dylan and Cole (The Suite Life of Zack and Cody-- and how traumatic is THAT?) Sprouse as an adolescent. Sarah is emotionally bereft, an alcoholic and drug addict who lives only to find the next boyfriend and the next score, who views Jeremiah as a weight around her neck but feels compelled to act as his mother because she knows it's what's expected of her. Even when Sarah's parents intervene after Jeremiah ends up in the hospital and keep him at their compound (a vastly disturbing experience in itself) for three years, Sarah comes back for him. Not that being in any one situation is worse than any other for Jeremiah; with the exception of one early scene when he runs away and is temporarily sheltered at a police station, there's no safe place; adults, on the whole, exist in this world for the sole purpose of abusing, exploiting, and destroying children. The movie is relentless in its nihilism; I can't remember seeing a movie this overwhelmingly dark since the first time I saw Guinea Pig 2: The Flower of Flesh and Blood.

This is not a movie you will enjoy. At all. In fact, you'll probably come to hate it on levels you weren't even aware you had. But there is no surer indication that a movie is doing its job, and doing it exceptionally well, when you hate the movie because the movie wants you to hate it. This is a scary, scary movie. ****",1173744000,16,3471,4.56661316211878
2548151,4,B000F1IO3E,"This was never dull. I was riveted (and maybe a little disgusted) throughout the entire movie. I actually thought Asia's directing of this movie was excellent. Far better than Scarlet Diva. I appreciated that the disturbing scenes were mostly left up to your imagination and there was very little violence or ""gore"". The subject matter was not pleasant, but neither is life sometimes. I got the feeling that if Angelina Jolie had starred in it (and don't get me wrong, I love her) the whole world would have been crowing about how courageous she was for telling such a story. The end was a little confusing, but I found it to be very ""real""-as in there aren't always happy endings in real life or neat conclusions.

2548163,2,B000F1IO3E,"I was very interested in viewing this indi film because of the previews I had seen, and although I like Marilyn Manson, his part in the movie was not the draw.  It seemed from the previews that it would be something in the area of Hedwig and the Angry Inch.  Hedwig was a bit edgy and off color, but  the overall movie was really great (if you haven't seen it, you should). However, much to my dismay, the story in The Heart is Deceitful was even more disturbing in ways that I personally couldn't get with. I do not like child molestation/rape; it makes me physically ill even to think about it.  I was not happy with being bombarded with it in this film. Marilyn Manson was in the flick for about 5 minutes.  He played a trailer park-type guy who also had a go at the child.  The child's mother is played by a Courtney Love-type character, who is the most dispicable excuse for a human being let alone a mother.

I guess if a film or music makes you feel - one way or another - it has accomplished its mission and has made you live through an experience whether it's good or bad.  This movie did make me feel.  I watched it once, and will not watch it again.  This is just one opinion, and there are probably many, many others that would be opposite of mine.

I had never heard of Asia Argento before seeing this film, but she is clearly a talented director and actress. As a director, she manages to make the tale of an abused and exploited young boy both disturbing and entertaining. She does this by keeping the tone of the film trippy and surreal, as opposed to gritty and realistic, which suits the bizarre life that Jeremiah's punk/hooker/stripper/drug-addict mother drags him into. As an actress, Argento is also impressive: she portrays Sarah as a wild, damaged, fearless mess, who occasionally, with her husky voice and brash sexuality, bears a creepy resemblance to Courtney Love.

Most of the scenes were short and independent, and it was sometimes difficult to make out the transition between the scenes. On top of that, most scenes were kinda cut in the end, unclear, as if incomplete or left me with ""huh?"" It took me two times of reviewing to figure out who was actually sitting on Manson's lap.

2548168,3,B000F1IO3E,"J.T. LeRoy or Laura Albert or whoever wrote the collection of stories that created Jeremiah would probably take umbrage with Screenwriter/Director Asia Argento for turning Jeremiah's life of abuse and angst into a biography of Sarah, the mother who gave birth to Jeremiah at age 14 only to relinquish him to foster homes while she lead her life as a truck stop lizard and drug addict.  While Asia Argento has impressive credentials as both actress and filmmaker in Italy, her on screen performance in this self-directed film is excessively focused on her and leaves the child of the stories as a mere sidebar.

Much of the story line that ran through the book has been abandoned, probably due to the fact that few child actors could be asked to enact the bizarre and distorted things that Jeremiah did.  Gone is the cross-dressing, the prostitution, and much of the other behavioral defects that peppered the pages of the novel.  Instead we see a child claimed from a satisfactory foster home by a mother who jumps from one abusive lover to the next, leaving Jeremiah to fend for himself by eating out of garbage cans, living in slums and being at the beck and call of Sarah's consistently disgusting paramours.  When Jeremiah is raped by one of Sarah's men he is sent to live with his crazed Bible belt grandparents where he is brainwashed into a zealot along with his cousins.  He eventually is 're-rescued' by Sarah and once again the pointless existence presses on.  There is no ending as there were/are further books to come.

Asia Argento creates a fairly one-dimensional portrait of Sarah, that of a wasted bit of scum obedient only to her libido and drug needs.  Yes, she fled from her parent's religious suffocation, but other than that we have no insight as to her behavior.  The boys who portray Jeremiah (Jimmy Bennett, Cole and Dylan Sprouse) are just a bit too scrubbed and proper for the role and again we see little in the way of depth of character as Argento adapted the book.  There are very brief bit parts by a number of fine actors (one wonders why they wanted to do this) such as Kip Pardue (as buff as you'll ever see him!), Winona Ryder, Michael Pitt, Peter Fonda, Marilyn Mason, Ben Foster, Jeremy Renner, and Jeremy Sisto but their appearances are strong despite the fleeting seconds in which they inhabit the screen.

The 'form follows function' rule certainly applies here: the story is shot is choppy, rancid colored, disorienting pieces that follow the style of the storytelling.  The music is, well, loud and for the most part covers the dialogue (not always a bad thing).  This is an 'art film' and one that takes patience to endure, but considering the great hoopla that accompanied the discovery of the 'J.T LeRoy' scandal, it probably merits watching.  For this viewer the film should have just been called 'Sarah - a tour de force for Asia Argento'. Incidental information: the opening of the DVD is a multi-actor plea for support for ONE.org, a group of actors speaking out against poverty.  It proves to be the most inspiring part of the disc!

2548169,5,B000F1IO3E,"Note to consumers:  The original release of this DVD contains an authoring error, resulting in an abrupt jump that bypasses the ""explosion"" scene (which can be seen in the previews).  Palm Pictures has been very responsive to email requests for replacement versions of the DVD, and if you purchased a defective item, you should contact them via their web site.

J.T. Leroy's ""true"" life tale about a teenaged truck stop prostitute and her son was first told in a collection of short stories by the same name.  The movie follows the early years of Jeremiah, a boy who experiences child rape, has gender confusion, lives as a scavenger, is brainwashed by evangelical Christians, and experiences a revolving door of his mother's boyfriends and tricks.  The big screen version follows the written version closely; however, I highly recommend that viewers also pick up a copy of the book (and Leroy's earlier work Sarah) to answer any questions about the backstory, the red bird metaphor, the story of Sarah's own youth, the inner strength of Jeremiah, and more.

Director/Actor Asia Argento is brilliant, pure and simple.  She portays child rape and the harrowing seduction of a grown man (Marilyn Manson) by a teenaged boy in drag with artistic genius.  Viewers don't need to see the ""monster"" in full light, and their imagination of the rest of the scene is far more disturbing.  As an actor, she portrays Sarah as a chameleon who shifts from a drop-dead looker to a trashy stripper to a drug-addicted junkie to a loving mother to a hateful creep in mere minutes (and then shifts back again).  She is both drop-dead gorgeous and completely hideous.  Three young actors portray Jeremiah as a stoic boy who grows up in this chaotic environment, and all of them are excellent.

Some reviewers find this movie depressing, and I couldn't disagree more.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  This movie is what you make of it.  Viewers can easily find a commentary of the child welfare system, insight into the results of a repressed childhood, social commentary on hypocrisy, and insight into the scarring effects of child abuse if they scratch beneath the surface.  It's no pick-me-up, but this is in no way the most horrific film I've ever seen (try Baise Moi or Irreversible for that).  It's also not an exploitation film by any means.  It is brutally honest about events and situations which go on every day in America.

Is the story a hoax?  Once again, the authenticity of the movie is open to interpretation.  J.T. Leroy has been exposed as the pen name for a woman who was never a truck-stop prostitute, which recasts the short story collection as a work of fiction instead of non-fiction.  Literary magazines and critics have engaged in a never-ending debate about the hoax (especially in the light of the James Frey controversy).  The primary criticism is that the story loses its authenticity--how can the reader/viewer trust the insight to such sensitive topics if the author never experienced them?  For a play-by-play of the backlash and controversy about Leroy's identity, refer to the Wikipedia article on the subject.

The Palm Pictures promotional web site has embraced the controversy in a fun way, which is how I encourage consumers to view it.  Yes, the story is larger-than-life.  On the other hand, it is far from the outrageous film every made.  I truly believe that the statement made by the film is a strong one that is undiluted by the author's credibility with personal experience.  (Hoaxes like Go Ask Alice, with its socio-political agenda, are far more dangerous than this story.)

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  Watch this movie with an open mind and look beneath the surface.  Develop your own opinions about the news that the story is actually a work of fiction.",1151366400,59,3799,4.8600311041990665
2548170,3,B000F1IO3E,"Asia Argento's adapation of super-fraud JT Leroy's book is a decent attempt yet it fails on so many levels.  While I thought Argento did a decent job as a director, I felt that the script and the acting was sub-par at best.  The pacing was somewhat weak and over all, the film felt somewhat disjointed and unrealistic.

The movie chronicles Jeremiah's descent into his mother's hellish lifestyle - rife with drugs, prostitution and abusive boyfriends.  Argento can act like a wickedly good skank - playing Sara as a cross between a tore up Courtney Love and crazy Baby Jane.  She was about the only decent actor in this film.  The child actors walk through the film in a slack jawed daze - while this may be an attempt to show them 'numbed' by the abuse they are coping with, I felt it made them uninteresting as characters.  I never got the feeling that we were able to 'feel' what Jeremiah was dealing with.  We get very little background info on Jeremiah - all we are to gather from the beginning is that Sara somehow gets him back from his cushy and loving foster care and then turns into a psycho as soon as the social workers are gone.  She instantly leaves her apartment and heads on the road, Jeremiah in tow.  We follow them on a zig zag course of drugs, drink and lots and lots of sex and abuse.  The squeamish will find some scenes disturbing - such as Jeremiah's rape by an angry abandoned boyfriend or the beating at the hands of another while Sara eggs the boyfriend on.

Soon, Jeremiah is 'rescued' briefly and stays with Sara's fundamentalist parents - with Peter Fonda in the role as the dad.  This whole set up was so phony and unrealistic - it bordered on lame.  The brother, the bath scene, Jeremiah singing the Sex Pistols.........blech. I won't bore you with the details except to say that this was probably the worst and most unbelievable part of the film.

Other celebrities make cameos here as well - Winona Ryder playing a neurotic therapist who tells Jeremiah that he will lose his priveleges if he doesn't say ""it wasn't my fault"".  This just seemed....well, wrong.  What therapist would threaten a child who has just been traumatized?  Marilyn Manson shows up as a creepy boyfriend who ends up being ""seduced"" by Jeremiah in his mother's nightie.....again, not great acting, didn't feel believable.

Argento throws in a few fantasy scenes but ultimately nothing seems to tie in together - or work in a convincing manner.  While I didn't feel that this was the worst movie I have ever seen, I certainly felt it lacked a lot.  That being said, Argento has so much potential as a director and actress - she was the only saving grace and interesting character in the film.  I found myself caring less about the child and hoping that she would find redemption and help instead.",1151193600,7,2801,4.593561368209255
2548171,4,B000F1IO3E,"I love this film. It's an excellent film that does not pull any punches...that being said, I wanted to know if anyone else noticed the missing scene near the end of the film. It is right after Jeremiah and Buddy are in the basement. (SPOILER) The house is supposed to explode in the next scene but instead Asia walks into the home with jeremy sisto and then it just cuts to the next scene. I don't know if I have a defective DVD or if Palm Pictures edited the film so it could have an R rating. Anyone else have the same experience?",1150675200,5,532,4.174757281553398
8116401,1,B000F1IO3E,I'm a big fan of Asia but... the story is horrible. Yeah there are some interesting moments and decent performances but it's too depressing.,1518825600,,140,4.875
8116402,1,B000F1IO3E,"This psychopath Laura Albert pretended to be a boy (J.T. LeRoy) who suffered an un-survivable childhood of verbal, mental, physical, sexual, and drug abuse. She used a therapist to help develop the manipulation. The movie is disgusting and makes you miserable. What is most upsetting is that when con artists like Laura Albert create hoaxes and false stories, it makes life so much more difficult for children/adults who experience/d abuse. I wish the movie and Laura's documentary could be pulled and never shown.",1504915200,,514,5.204819277108434

Feel like I have PTSD from watching it. I speed thru and still feel sick.

8116405,5,B000F1IO3E,"i think to appreciate this film you need to know the story behind the story's story. so , I liked it, but would have not if I didn't know the WHOLE story about JT LeRoy.",1492473600,6,169,3.857142857142857
8116406,1,B000F1IO3E,"I have no real objection to sleazy movies if they're well done.  This one was not.  Production values are dismal, acting is abysmal.  The characters portrayed are disgusting.  Dressing a boy as a girl and providing him as a toy for a pervert is revolting.  Thank goodness it is mostly only alluded to, not depicted. I am a stout advocate for freedom of speech but this video makes a good case for film censorship and subsequent burning..",1490140800,3,437,4.623376623376624
8116407,1,B000F1IO3E,"This movie is terrible, just awful and low budget.  Terrible values all the way around, at times reminded me of bad 70's porn, but not as good.  WHAT...was Peter Fonda doing in this?  What was he thinking?  The one effect is really bad and handmade, although it may have been meant to be that way.  Punk, ya know?  (Wasn't that in the 70s, too?)  Story is boring, script is boring, nothing much happens but bad things to this boy, as he is shuffled between his mother, her parents, and foster parents.  But these things are not so horrible that we haven't seen them before (we have just seen them done better).  Asia couldn't act nor could most of her boyfriends.  The boys who played Jeremiah could and are the only reason to watch this.  But not a good enough one to waste time on.  The worst movie I have seen in a long, long, long time.  How it could get some decent reviews is just beyond me.  I guess the celebrity mystique of ""JT"" still lives, and go figure on that one.",1488240000,5,977,4.2967032967032965

8116410,3,B000F1IO3E,"This was a very sad, and very realistic lifestyle of young Mom's and kids living in a drug lifestyle.  I watched it painfully hoping it would end well... it didn't.

If you are interested in how drug addicts raise their kids... this movie is for you.  Having worked in social services this is far too real for my liking, and very education for those who aren't oriented to that lifestyle.",1485820800,,388,4.514285714285714
