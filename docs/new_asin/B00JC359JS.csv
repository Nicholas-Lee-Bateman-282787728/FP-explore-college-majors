6354004,4,B00JC359JS,"This is an enjoyable 6 episode DVD of the Series Crimson Field. The story revolves around a group of nurses and their lives in war torn France. The setting is mostly the camp, with only a few jaunts to the wood, and nearby town. The story was engaging from the beginning. I liked most of the characters even the rotten ones. At times I felt the characters seemed a bit modern in their viewpoints and opinions, which was appealing, but perhaps not convincingly believable. There were a few episodes where new characters who I wasn't overly intrigued with hogged the limelight. I had a lot of unanswered questions and since the series was not renewed we may never find out what happened to these characters. At times I found the setting and the  bad behavior of the characters a bit of a downer.

Overall, this was a nice series with a lot of potential. I am disappointed it wasn't renewed.",1424217600,22,888,4.54375
6354005,5,B00JC359JS,"I'll never understand why the BBC opted not to continue this fantastic series. From the very first episode, I was hooked. It's so rare to see a show that centers on the females, and even more rare to see females in roles that are diverse and multi-faceted. I loved them all... everyone from Kitty to Flora to Rosalie. While they weren't always likable at times, I felt like I always related to them. It was also a very romantic series (perhaps this is why the BBC cancelled it... was it too ""soap opera"" for BBC One?) Nevertheless, the plot never centered on the romance. Each episode featured a few new characters dealing with different issues, and each one was thoroughly engaging. The sets & costumes evoked the period quite well, and you really get a sense of how horrible it would have been during this war-torn period of history. As for the male cast, Thomas was very handsome and Miles was utterly adorable. And the fact that we don't get to see more of this phenomenal cast of characters makes me feel very gutted.",1423180800,72,1022,4.559782608695652

6354009,5,B00JC359JS,"Fabulous. As a nurse I am always interested in Nursing history and this is superb. The actors are top tier, the plots are riveting, the scripts are tight and believable . I am hopeful that there will be more. Equals 'Call the Midwife' in my estimation",1406851200,26,251,4.478260869565218
6354010,5,B00JC359JS,"I have to say that I was underwhelmed after watching the first episode but soon became engrossed in the lives of the characters in this very well made series. Hence, I am now more than disappointed that the BBC have decided not to commission a second series. This means we will never get to see the the thoroughly nasty Quartermaster Sergeant, Reggie Soper, get his comeuppance nor the vile sister Quayle!

It could be argued, I suppose that it's not a great deal different from watching episodes of Holby City and the lives and loves of medical folk while they go about their business of healing the sick. However, one might have thought that this Centenary year would have prompted the BBC to do something a little bit out of the ordinary - particularly as this show's ratings are significantly better than Holby's recent showings!",1403049600,30,833,4.744827586206896
6354011,5,B00JC359JS,"I seriously fell in love with this series, like I can't put it into words. Some say that the story lines seem to weak or under-developed but I would vastly disagree. Only really special TV has made my stomach flip while watching, and this one did multiple times.

6354014,5,B00JC359JS,"An enthralling historical piece. After reading some reviews and finding out it was cancelled after one season, I thought I would be disappointed at the ending. I wish all movies ( I know this was a series) were this well written and given the time to tell a story about a minute in people's lives during interesting historical times. If it were meant to have a second season, that was hidden well, they must have known to end it the way it did. Great characters, super duper acting. I can feel the portrayals as if I too experienced the trials of war during this period. War seems so senseless and so apt to make people lose all sense of normalcy. How to adapt when this happens?

Definitely worth watching. I support sophisticated drama. Bravo to producers!!",1492387200,,759,4.580882352941177
6354015,3,B00JC359JS,"As my husband said as we were watching this, ""It's all feelings.""  Yes, feelings, drama and romance, and the obligatory homosexual.  No surprise, it was written by females.  So, it's fine if you like feelings, drama and romance with a little blood and gore and many superior women.",1491004800,,281,4.8125

6354018,5,B00JC359JS,"This short run series was one of the best I have seen.  Very well acted, and the sets/costuming was amazing.  I loved the medical aspect, and seeing how soldiers were treated during WW I.  I had signed a petition in order to try and save this show, but unfortunately, the BBC didn't see the ratings in the UK, so they cancelled it.  I'm amazed that ""Indian Summers"" which was mediocre at best could have gotten an additional series, but ""Crimson Field"" got cast aside after only one.  I can say there were many disappointed fans on social media.  The Blu-ray is superb. So glad I could at least purchase the one and only series to own.",1484870400,2,635,4.431034482758621

6354029,2,B00JC359JS,"Definitely watchable,but more of a soap opera than a period piece. In my opinion, Hermione Norris seems miscast, Kevin Doyle, Richard Rankin, Jodhi May, Adam James, and particularly Suranne Jones, overact. I loved Kerry Fox--she was perfect as the creepy Sister Quayle. I would have liked more of her scheming. What I didn't buy into: the love story between Kitty and Thomas. Who would like him? He's grumpy, judgmental, cold, and has that annoying Scottish accent. The love story between Sister Joan and the German man was overwrought and I really didn't care about it--who is this guy anyway? Just someone she supposedly loves, but we don't know anything about him, so it's hard to work up the emotion necessary to care about what happens. The two people who had the most chemistry were Peter and Flora, but sadly he was the token gay person and she didn't seem interested in romance. If I had been writing this series, I would have had Flora come from a privileged background (as Rosalie did) and fall for Peter, the rough, sometimes cruel, and definitely (in my story) heterosexual corporal. Also, I would have had the charismatic Miles take a shine to the uptight Rosalie. I also would have spent a little more time developing the main characters rather than focusing on a new group of side characters each episode. Silly plotlines: the going blind officer, the revelation that Matron had an affair with a Sikh (really? ok, either develop the character a little bit or don't even mention it. As with the German guy, it's hard to be interested or to have feeling for someone you know nothing about). Also, it was hard to understand Sister Quayle's frustration of being passed over in favor of Grace because we didn't see any of the back story. In summary, this series had potential, but settles for lazy characterization and plots and although I don't regret watching it, it's definitely not a keeper.",1469404800,,1905,4.810975609756097

6354041,5,B00JC359JS,"If you're a medical history buff (or a WWI buff) you will love ""The Crimson Field.""  The characters are developed subtly, in shades of grey.  The story of Joan Livesey and her German fiancee is particularly poignant, and will stick with you.  The medical advances made during WWI were astounding, particularly those involving wound care and cosmetic surgery. This series makes it clear that these advances were made to the benefit (or detriment, as the case may be) of real live human beings.  Another facet of this series that makes it different from many war-time historical dramas is that it highlights the fact that people were involved for many different reasons...i.e. because they had to, because they were afraid of being branded a coward, or because they were trying to escape a bad situation. The only real ""baddies"" in the series are those who appear to be there for the ""glory of war"" itself.  It's too bad that the BBC didn't continue this series....for ""Downton Abbey"" or Call the Midwife"" fans ""The Crimson Field"" was a quality series that showed great promise.",1448668800,,1076,4.8901098901098905
6354042,5,B00JC359JS,"I have been waiting 70 years for something to rish up to the level of Casablanca.  The Crimson Field did it, but why the story has not been continued at least until the end of The Great War is a disappointment and a loss to common sense.  The story is outstanding, but whether

It didn't feel like a story about the people though, just events. I didn't get really invested in who the people were, so I cared less than I felt I would had it rated 5 stars. It's good.

It does give one an idea of what was happening during this turbulant time.  The Great War was to be the one that ended all wars!!!  How ironic!!  More of a reality series that has a little intrigue, romance and unfinished business!!

The WWI setting is mostly incidental. There is NO war action whatsoever in Crimson Field. Although the technical details such as uniforms, equipment, vehicles, period attitudes etc are very well done and true to period - which is why I give this show two stars instead of one. The show is really about a bunch of nurses and their endless (!) relationship problems and their feeeeeeeeelings (woh, woh, woh). Adding to the annoyance are the modern BBC-mandatory subthemes of class warfare (upper class people - especially men - are usually depicted as either cowardly fools or jerks) and of course the modern BBC's infatuation with gays. Can the Beeb POSSIBLY make ANY series now without interjecting (for NO plot-related reason!) gay characters? Did Parliament pass a law or something?  I have gay friends who say ""What on earth is that gay orderly there for??"" Anyway if you have a Y chromosome you will probably find The Crimson Field tedious and rather dull.  The XX-chromosome-uber-allies crowd will savage this review (of course).  But the rest of you have been warned.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.",1440547200,7,1274,4.857142857142857

Crimson Field gives a good look at what it was like working on the medical side of things during WWI, especially  the part that women played.  The characters are interesting and have real life struggles, each with their own story to tell. If you enjoy historical dramas this is a great movie to watch.  You won't find a lot of unnecessary sex/violent scenes even though this is a series about war and love.  Yes, you do see the horrors of war and the damage it does to bodies and souls, but as I have come to expect from BBC,  this series is a balance of real life told tastefully and in a interesting way.",1439424000,,768,4.298611111111111

6354095,4,B00JC359JS,"It's WWI and a group of British nurses are treating the wounded on the front (France). We not only get to know them, but also the surgeons they work closely with, and with this group comes lots of secrets and tensions. A six-hour series, it comes on two DVDs.

There's the matron, with a soft heart for her patients, but not so much at times for her volunteers. There's a huge debate over how much the volunteers should be allowed to do. There's a secret engagement, secret babies, possible love affairs. Resentment, jealousy, fear. Each episode brings up something new to think about: the trials of nursing, how very difficult it can be for a young lady in those times to see a man's body. Cowardice. Should they be shot? Not every man is cut out for war...yet should they shot for their weakness?

There's Irish/British tensions, and even more fascinating to me was the experimental procedures the surgeons perform. I'm not a medical expert, but though brief, the side story involving a wounded patient being put through a painful routine every two hours rather than losing his leg was intriguing.

While the first episode was slow and I had my doubts the series would improve, by the third episode, I was hooked. I became engrossed in everyone's lives and scandals. I found myself shouting at people, especially the wife who tells her husband she doesn't want to hear his war stories. What a shocker of an episode. I dare not say what happens, but I will say it raised a lot of emotion in me.

The secret engagement turned into a shocker of epic proportions bringing the issues of treason. Right man, wrong time... I was happy with the way this resolved. It was realistic and yet could have been worse. I must say though, I am not pleased with one sidestory's resolution...Kitty. Fascinating woman with hints of a scandalous past...but yet we never get the full story. I wanted the full story there and I didn't care for her love interest. I'd have chosen the other guy.",1437868800,2,1973,4.644699140401146

I watch shows like I read books: for the characters. This show has a wonderful range of characters from all walks of life, with fascinating backstories and struggles and dreams. Except for the characters I'm obviously not supposed to like, I absolutely adored everyone and couldn't wait each week to gain more snippets of what makes them tick. Herein lies the problem with the BBC cancelling this show - they left the end of the season with such a cliffhanger that I am positive I will perish if I don't discover the answers to all the burning questions with which they left viewers.

I also enjoyed learning more about this fascinating time period. I am so glad they went somewhat against the grain for a show centered around the war and chose to focus more on social issues than the fighting, because so many times that is what is left out of history classes.

I don't watch many shows at all, but I am so glad I chose to give The Crimson Field a chance. I can't recommend it highly enough.",1437350400,2,1240,4.453744493392071

6354104,5,B00JC359JS,"Within the first minutes of watching this series I knew that I was hooked. It gives an honest representation of life in the war hospitals of Northern France during the First World War. While many depictions of war-time focus on the absolute patriotism of those involved, this series shows that lines do get blurred when individual, real people are involved. The impeccable production is what initially catches your attention, but then an outstanding cast brings the writing of Sarah Phelps to life. The dynamic relationships between the characters means that there is truly something for everyone to love in this show. In fact, I would argue that it has a lot in common with the massive hit show, Downton Abbey, as it explores many of the same themes though in a completely unique way. Where D.A. explores the realities of hierarchy in early 20th century British society, The Crimson Field does the same with the ranking within the army and hospital camps. Also present are complicated love stories, a discussion of homosexuality, loyalty and duty, one's honour, and so much more! Truly, this is one of the greatest television shows that I have seen of late. If you feel as I do, passionately about great TV, please head to ipetitions and sign to have the BBC recommission this show!",1437091200,2,1283,4.863013698630137

6354107,5,B00JC359JS,"**Possible Spoilers COULD be Deduced From This Review!**  I watched the series when it originally aired in the UK in 2014. BBC One needs to be much more attentive to highlighting the work that is being accomplished in this show, to draw in a much wider audience. I have thoroughly enjoyed watching The Crimson Field. It has been a delight to be introduced to so many actors and actresses who are so very talented. To be able to portray each story line, to actually get the underlying feelings and angst across in each episode in such a short time is difficult under the best of conditions. Some of the best stories from history are those of people who were not in the lime light, as that is how you get the best ""feel"" for how ""real"" people dealt with ""real"" life without boring the viewer to tears. The story line is quite believable, and the interaction between and amongst the principle characters is quite spot on. Modern viewers who are easily disappointed by ""not enough action"" or ""not enough gore"" or something equally compelling need to remember that, during this period, things were much simpler and people were still functioning around stereotypes and clichs. News from the rest of the world was *not* instantaneous as it is now, therefore watching a period piece with hindsight is really quite unfair to all involved in the production. To be able to portray so much within a short period of time requires all involved to be succinct and on-point ... which this series is. I am ecstatic that The Crimson Fied is now available in the US ... *but* we need to have at least another 3 seasons to be able to properly follow these story lines to their conclusions.",1435190400,4,1669,4.619528619528619

SOME BRIEF HISTORICAL CONTEXT  -- PLUS DVD AND BLU-RAY QUALITY

This 2014 TV mini series was written and produced by Sarah Phelps (also did 2011 Great Expectations with Gillan Anderson).  It was inspired by (but not based on) a Lyn McDonald book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roses-Of-No-Mans-Land/dp/014017866X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roses Of No Mans Land</a>&nbsp;about volunteer nurses who served on the Western Front during WWI.  Though the characters in this show are fictional, a great deal of effort and research was expended to insure a very historical setting.  They are set across a spectrum of social classes and backgrounds to, in Phelp's words, illustrate the mindset of the entire country.  As such, there is a heavy emphasis on social issues and personal dramas more than the war itself or combat.  As these brave women help piece soldiers back together, body and soul, their own lives are somewhat dissected.  There are just six episodes and the first half spends time introducing the characters while really going for the heart strings - depicting the terrible effects of war on individual soldiers.  Shell shock, gaping wounds, a few medical advances, personal fear, and patriotism are all explored as story lines.  Though I loved the whole series, I realize some viewers might get bogged down in the melodrama before the story arcs have a chance to set in.  The second half is where the payoffs begin as many characters battle their past and secrets come to light.

THE STORY (no spoilers):  It begins with three volunteer nurses in the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VADs) arriving at the port of Boulogne France 1915 as they head for a field hospital near the front.  One volunteer is shown in particular as the scene opens with her.  Kitty Trevelyan is on the ship rail and tosses a golden wedding ring into the water before disembarking.  It seems clear she is running away from something we don't yet understand.  She quickly meets up with two other volunteers, the prim Rosalie Berwick and youthful, wide eyed Flora Marshall.  The three travel to camp and are introduced to the spartan and militaristic lifestyle they will live.  Everyone is just coming to the realization this will not be a short war as previously thought.  At the heart of the camp is the Matron of nurses Grace Carter and her adjutant Sister Quayle who was passed over for matron by the hospital commander LT COL Roland Brett.  This camp politics will play a significant role as Matron Carter was once the protg and subordinate of the curmudgeonly but decorated military nurse Sister Quayle.  This dynamic is further strained by the arrival of highly skilled and rather modern Sister Joan Livesey who is Matron Carter's friend.  She rides into camp on her own motor bike sporting a bob hair-do, male officer's coat, and her own complicated past.  Volunteer Trevelyan is hiding her own secrets and has difficulty with a sour attitude as she learns to adjust to her new life.  The focus resides more on the three volunteers though quite a number of characters hide some sort of past they may be running from.  Though the first half focuses heavily on social issues, the latter half builds on that foundation and digs heavier into the individual lives as their past catches up with them and comes to a head.

OTHER THOUGHTS:  I enjoyed this program right from the start, but also waited to see if they would take it somewhere beyond the melodrama.  As a former soldier, I was affected by the stories of individual wounded and their plight.  I admit I had to choke down a little emotion at times.  I mentioned the first few episodes try to go straight for the heart strings and the drama can be heavy.  I realize there are some that will feel it's a bit too much, particularly if emotion is not your thing.  This was a particularly gruesome war to fight and the social changes it affected on Britain were profound.  Direction is realized more specifically in the second half as mentioned.  The performances were all outstanding.  From the opening scene, it's clear the cinematography will be stunning.

DVD & BLU RAY QUALITY:  The excellent filming of this production allows for stunning presentations.  The DVD is top quality for that medium.  But the clarity and stunning colors really have a chance to shine on the Blu Ray presentation.  The colors in the costumes, the hues of sky and countryside all really pop.  It's all just gorgeous!

NOTE ABOUT CONTENT:  There is some language and brief male nudity as they deal with realistic hospital and military environments.  This was edited in the broadcast version on PBS but is unedited on the discs and streaming versions.

NO SPECIAL FEATURES FROM U.K. RELEASE:  The modest special features originally included with the UK release are not on this U.S. release.  They included an interview with Sarah Phelps about the inspiration and making of the series.  They also include interviews with cast members.  If you are looking around at different sites, you may notice different run times listed.  However, the presentation of the program itself is identical on both U.S. and U.K. releases unedited.  Runtime of the program only on both U.S. and U.K. releases is just over 353 minutes.  If you are considering buying the U.K, release, it is region locked for 2 only and requires a player that will play region 2 discs.  The U,S, release is also region locked for region 1 only.

SOME INTERESTING HISTORICAL CONTEXT:  The Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) was established in 1909 with the help of the Red Cross.  Full fledged military nurses dressed as nuns and were not allowed to marry.  The VADs however, were civilian volunteers from middle and upper class families.  At the start of WWI, the Red Cross was reluctant to allow civilians to serve overseas and military officials in particular would not allow them near front lines.  They were not necessarily used to hard work given their background and were not used to military discipline.  However, this changed after Katherine Furse took the first two VADs to France in 1914 to serve as canteen workers and cooks.  They were unexpectedly caught in a battle and pressed into emergency service.  Having performed well, the VAD role was increased.  Over time, the volunteer worker's skill increased and fully trained nurses became more accepting.  During WWI alone, 38,000 volunteers participated and served throughout many theaters of war.  Some famous names of VADs you may recognize:  Enid Bagnold (author National Velvet), Mary Borden, Agatha Christie, and Amelia Earhart.",1429920000,89,6754,5.018901890189019
