8684215,5,B00OMCM4WO,"I watched it twice on PBS online earlier this year.  This is a story of love, family, diverse cultures, and connected world.  Watching this made me feel like the world is so large and diverse, but at the same time so small because of the love of people.  This is the same contrast as these two sisters who live in two different worlds, so far apart, yet are identical and love each other.  Must watch!  Consider buying the DVD to support the producer.",1443744000,,451,4.385542168674699
8684216,5,B00OMCM4WO,"I watched this excellent documentary when it was on PBS earlier this year. Having two Chinese adopted granddaughters, it really tugged at my heartstrings. Although it breaks my heart that the Chinese separated the girls, they both were adopted by wonderful families. Would love to see more about them as they get older.",1441497600,,319,5.037735849056604
8684217,5,B00OMCM4WO,"I don't watch foreign films....reading captions the whole way through is difficult for me.  And I very very rarely write reviews.  (Others write them so much better and throughly).

But if ANYTHING about this film has drawn your attention, I can't recommend it strongly enough. The acting is superb.  The storyline, while you may think you've seen something similar.....was really unique. The cinematography was excellent.

Personally, I don't like it when I read spoilers in a review, so I'm not writing much here.  I recommend you read the reviews online if you want those. If not...just go ahead and watch this.  You won't regret it.",1441411200,,636,5.0
8684218,5,B00OMCM4WO,I have two adopted granddaughters from China so I was very interested in seeing this.  My heart aches for these girls who should have (and probably could have) been adopted into one family. The picture of them as infants looking at each other made me cry. At least their adoptive families were able to bring them together at a young age. It is too bad that they live so far away from each other. I would love to see a sequel in about ten years. I hope they will stay in touch.,1429142400,,476,4.173913043478261
