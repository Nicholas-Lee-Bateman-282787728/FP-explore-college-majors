1753697,3,B00006G8I7,"After great success in the title roles of the AIP films Count Yorga, Vampire (1970), and The Return of Count Yorga (1971), Robert Quarry appeared yet again as a vampire in a non-AIP film, as Khorda, in Deathmaster (1972), which didn't sit well with AIP as they thought it too closely resembled the Count Yorga character, and they eventually secured the rights to the film, giving it a very limited release, subsequently banishing it to late night television limbo...until now...
The film, directed by actor, later turned director, Ray Danton, seems to attempt to capitalize on the success of the Yorga films, along with the notoriety stemming from the Manson family crimes of a few years earlier.  As the film's credits begin, displaying the title `eathmaste' (obviously the film was originally released in wide screen format, but is presented in full screen format here), we see an odd looking fellow (we later learn his name is Barbado) in the dunes on a beach, as he begins playing a flute (I think the movie is supposed to take place in California).  After a few moments of this, a coffin floats towards the beach, and is found by a surfer walking along the beach (leave it be, dude).  He pulls it further on shore, opens it (good idea), and gets attacked by Barbado, who snuck up behind him, which I thought was a pretty good trick as the guy's wearing a lot of jingly jangly jewelry around his neck, which tends to make a lot of noise.  Barbado dispatches the surfer, hoists the coffin, and lugs it back to his pick-up truck.
Cut to what appears to be some sort of hippie festival in its' final days.  Here we meet Pico (Bill Ewing), Rona (Brenda Dickson), and Pop, played by popular character actor John Fielder, who, among other roles, does the voice for Piglet on the Winnie the Pooh cartoons).  They have a run-in with a just arrived biker, Monk (William Jordan) and his old lady, Esslin (Betty Ann Rees).  Pico uses kung fu on Monk (which is the only time he uses it...I was looking forward to a kung fu fight with a vampire), but as the heat show up (a policeman), all four book it for a funky mansion in the hills where a whole group of hippies seem to have taken up residence.  It's peace, love, and a whole lot of smokin' of things probably not legal.  Around this time Khorda (Quarry) makes his appearance, and proceeds to blow these young bloods' minds, spewing a bunch of metaphysical mumbo-jumbo, but coming from Quarry, in his rich, aristocratic tones, it's pretty sweet to the ears, and he quickly enthralls the doped up hippies.  He soon departs, despite the young hippies pleas (always leave `em wanting more), but he'll be back, as we get a sense that he was just priming them for the big show.  And he does come back, encouraging them to clean the mansion, and clean their souls (whatever that means).  Monk, not buying into any of what he calls a `freak show', decides to go off to town for `whiskey and a steak', leaving his old lady Esslin in Khorda's clutches, which he soon reveals his true nature, attacking and turning her into a creature of the night.
The weirdness continues, and Pico decides it's time to split.  He tells Rona to get her stuff, but they get sidetracked and Pico gets chained up in some caves underneath the house, and Barbado captures Rona after she find the shackled Pico.  Pico manages to slip out of his bondage, as the chains were never really fastened or anything (good job Barbado) and finds Khorda's coffin in a cave within the catacombs, along with a bowl of leeches (!?).  Pico then manages to escape out to the beach, and makes his way back to Pop to relate his terror-filled tale.  Pop doesn't believe Pico's story, but then Pop's dog gets bitten by a vampire and dies (oh bruther) and now, as the Monkees put it, `I'm a believer'.  They do some research, infiltrate the mansion, and witness a black ceremony.  This sets up the final confrontation and the rather downbeat, yet oddly satisfying, ending more common with movies throughout the 70's.
Okay, the only real reason to watch this film is for Robert Quarry.  Despite the complete schlockiness of the production, Quarry puts on a great show, creating a suave, charismatic veneer that conceals a terrifying monster.  His dialogue comes across smoothly, entrancing the hippies like some kind of Svengali, as they willingly accept his `gift'.  The story is very loose, creating gigantic plot holes, and character development is virtually non-existent.  The dialog is pretty lame, and most of the other acting beside Quarry is bargain basement stuff, along with the extremely dated wardrobe (I swear the fabric that made up Quarry's robe was from my grandma's old couch).  The pacing throughout did slow noticeably at times, making me think the director was padding the film a bit, filling out the 88 minute run time.  Quarry's vampire makeup was actually better than I expected, presenting a pretty scary visage when in vampire mode.
Retromedia Entertainment presents a better than average quality of full screen print here, and a load of extras including a commentary track (pretty rare for a Retromedia release) by Fred Olin Ray and Robert Quarry, still galleries, trailers for this and some other Robert Quarry films, and television commercials and radio spots featuring Quarry.  The special features seem to present more of a homage to Quarry rather than focusing on the film, but given that Quarry more or less made the movie watchable, that's not a bad thing.  Fans of Quarry won't be disappointed.  I guess if I learned anything from this movie, it's that vampires like to keep a bowl of water full of leeches next to their coffin.  Why?  Kindred spirits, I guess...

1753698,5,B00006G8I7,"My experience with Retromedia DVDs has been pretty spotty, and I had never seen Deathmaster before buying this, so I'm glad to say I'm very pleased on both counts. Deathmaster was concocted as an indie production by Quarry and actor/first-time director Ray Danton to cash in on the huge success of AIP's Count Yorga: Vampire and make a subtle comment on the then-recent Manson family murders. AIP chief Sam Arkoff, angered by Quarry's swift and bold move, threatened a lawsuit, eventually buying the picture and giving it a very limited release. After a run on TV in the '70s it disappeared, never available on video.

The movie starts with a surfer finding the coffin of Khorda (Quarry) washed ashore, but he's soon dispatched by Khorda's creepy flute-playing henchman Barbado. We're then introduced to the main characters, a bunch of disaffected but 'lovable' guitar-strumming Hollywoodized 'hippies' squatting in a huge old mansion who smoke lots of weed, run from 'the heat,' sing dippy inspirational folk songs, and use lots of hilarious sixties jargon. (The main folksinging hippie is a nearly unrecognizable Bobby 'Boris' Pickett of Monster Mash fame.) Khorda just sort of shows up in their midst, spouting existentialist/cosmic mumbo-jumbo (some of it improvised by Quarry) that the simple-minded flower children instantly 'groove' to even though they have no idea what he's talking about. Only biker dude Monk (whose iron cross repels Khorda) is skeptical, and bolts in search of whiskey and steak, leaving girlfriend Esslin to be seduced/attacked later by the vampiric 'guru.' The other hippies are so inspired by Khorda's rhetoric that they clean up their pad and start digging lame muzak, co-written by Ray Conniff (!!) and Pickett. Despite their copious herbal consumption these hippies apparently don't believe in free love: the guys and gals retire to separate quarters at night! Monk returns, is promptly dispatched by Khorda, and, inexplicably, everyone except 'gung fu' practicing hero Pico (who's hair looks like a really fake wig but is apparently his own) and heroine Rona go into a mystical dance-trance while Barbado plays congas (unconvincingly) and Khorda mingles. Pico and Rona try to escape the house, but are captured by Barbado, though Pico eventually gets away to seek help from balding serape-wearing hippie entrepreneur Pop (John Fiedler, ubiquitous professional milquetoast character actor and voice of piglet in the Walt Disney Winnie the Pooh cartoons). Pop just happens to have one of those old occult books (in paperback!) that explains what's going on (with handy pictures of the amulets the newly-baptized vampire cult are wearing). They mount their assault on Khorda and his minions with mallets and broom-handle stakes, and the movie finishes with one of those typically '70s 'shock/twist' endings and the only moment of actual 'special effects' in the picture.

Amazingly, despite being surrounded by some really bad acting and dated dialogue, Quarry acquits himself quite admirably, creating a fairly menacing, believable character (ignoring of course all the psychobabble he's given to mouth). He looks great in an assortment of groovy custom-made robes, is occasionally introduced by sitar licks on the soundtrack, and has the same multi-pointed fangs as in Count Yorga (although everyone else is stuck with obvious dime-store 'goofy teeth'). There is no real nudity and minimal gore, even for 1972 (though the leeches are a nice, if unexplained, touch). The plot has its holes, and the relentless hippie-ness gives the film a goofy, campy aura, but Danton keeps the camera and the story moving so its quite enjoyable, never boring, and worth it for Quarry's magnetic performance and a few effectively creepy sequences. A little-seen treat for all Yorga/Quarry fans or anyone who loves the old AIP drive-in sleaze in general.

Fortunately, Fred Olen Ray/Retromedia have actually done a surprisingly decent job in rescuing this from rights-issues limbo. The print is very clean, with virtually no spotting or other damage, and matted to 1.85:1 (although it looks a little closer 1.75:1 or so to me). The color is not spectacular but quite serviceable, and isn't going to look any better since the transfer is from the original 35mm camera negative. The black level, brightness, contrast, and detail are all fine, and I didn't notice any artifacting or other weirdness that plagues other Retromedia discs I own (King Dinosaur, Faceless Monster). There are four still galleries: publicity, behind-the-scenes, Quarry portraits, Quarry on stage and screen; 30- and 60-second radio spots for Count Yorga; really scratchy TV promos for Count Yorga and Sugar Hill, a Lucky Strike commercial featuring Quarry, and a classic, funny Shasta orange soda commercial featuring Fiedler and Frankenstein's monster. While these extras are nice and generally well done, the real highlight of the set is Quarry's audio commentary (with Fred Olen Ray, who directed Quarry in dozens of low-budet indies in the 1980s and '90s), which is nearly as entertaining as the feature. Quarry is sophisticated and witty, as expected, providing much interesting behind-the-scenes production info and some amusing anecdotes, with little if any dead air. Finally a Retromedia disc worthy of my unqualified highest recommendation. Get it!",1055030400,10,5346,5.331753554502369

There was supposed to be a third sequel after Return of Count Yorga, but tragically it was never made.  In the movie posters, Count Yorga is referred to as the ""Deathmaster"".  Oddly, that's the title of Robert Quarry's unrelated vampire, hippie, kung-fu masterpiece, ""THE DEATHMASTER"".  I really liked this movie.  All possible faults aside, how can anyone not enjoy such a goofy film?  A strange voodoo hippie named Barbados is seen dragging a large wooden box across the beach.  Later, a charismatic Manson-like guru named Khorda is mesmerizing a group of young, drug addled hippies in an abandoned estate.  He turns out to be a vampire intent on spreading his evil.  The protagonist Pico is a ""Billy Jack"" like Native American who beats drunken biker bullies using kung-fu and is mentored by the local sage, played by squeaky voiced character actor John Fielder.  Pico makes it his job to fight Khorda and save his girlfriend.  I would definitely recommend this movie to all diehard horror aficionados.

1753805,5,B00006G8I7,"The Deathmaster is a new twist, on the old Vampire film genre. Robert Quarry stars as Khorda, a guru-like character, who happens to also be a Vampire. The film takes place in the early 70s, when hippies were still around, and on the fringes of society. The main setting for the movie is an old abandoned mansion, inhabited by a group of young hippies in southern California.

It begins with a mysterious, hulking black dude, who plays flute on the beach. He's adorned with lots of bone necklaces, and a colorful flowing robe. A coffin washes-up on the beach, and is intercepted by a young surfer. The black man chokes the surfer to death, then hauls the coffin to the mansion containing the hippies.

Meanwhile, two of the hippies, Pico and his girlfriend Rona, are hanging-out at the local knick-knack shop. It's owned by an eccentric older fellow, who is a kindly father-figure to Pico and the other hippies. A belligerent biker named Monk, arrives with his girl, who's named Esslin. Monk threatens the shop-owner, over the price of a bauble that Esslin is interested in. Pico intervenes, and has a scuffle with Monk. But Monk is no match for Pico, who uses martial arts on him. A cop comes to investigate, so they all flee.

Pico has no hard feelings towards Monk, and so he invites him and Esslin to the mansion for dinner. The large mansion is teeming with the dope-smoking, philosophizing hippies. Pico offers his guests a sumptuous meal of organic foods. The eerie black guy who killed the surfer, is a part of the group too. They call him Barbado. Barbado is a mute, who 'speaks' through his flute-playing and bongo-drumming.

Outside the mansion, the coffin that Barbado had brought there opens, and a large bearded man emerges. Beneath a spooky full-moon, he waves his hand, and a sudden storm blows-up. He enters the mansion, announcing himself as Khorda. The hippies think that this weirdly charismatic guy, is 'far-out'.

Khorda spends the evening regaling the enthralled hippies, with advice about 'life and love'. They are looking for ways to find meaning in their lives, and Khorda seems to have all the answers. Little do they know, Khorda is a Vampire. Soon, Khorda's influence over the hippies, results in horrifying consequences for them all.

Robert Quarry, is mesmerizing as Khorda. His piercing gaze alone, is enough to send chills up your spine. The supporting cast is mostly lackluster. The notable exception, is Betty Anne Rees, as Esslin. Esslin becomes a Vampire, after being ravished by Khorda. Betty Anne Rees infuses the character of Esslin with a scary, yet irresistibly hypnotic aura, as Khorda's newly converted Vampire mistress.

All in all, The Deathmaster is an intense, yet campy 70s horror flick. It's the kind of B movie classic, shown in the drive-in theaters back then. For fans of 70s B horror films, The Deathmaster is a must-see.",1257033600,,2874,4.865030674846626
1753806,3,B00006G8I7,"I first saw ""The Deathmaster"" on the late Saturday night t.v. program ""Shock Theater"" on WRDW-TV Channel 12 Augusta, Georgia many years ago. Although I had forgotten most of the film, I did remember mainly two things, the performance of the great Robert Quarry and the lovely presence of Brenda Dickson as ""Rona"", who later found success as ""Jill"" on ""The Young and the Restless"". I also remembered the fun character actor John Fiedler as ""Pop"" and how his character wound up in the movie. Absolutely nothing else. I had seen Robert Quarry in ""The Return of Count Yorga"" in it's first release in 1971. I had pretty much given up hope of ever seeing ""The Deathmaster"" again. Despite it being basically ok, I do find a few things a bit odd about this DVD release. It is advertised as a ""Deluxe Wide Screen Edition"". My t.v. is widescreen, but the video is fullscreen and the credits are partially cut off. While the bonus material is nice, it seems to be more a tribute to Robert Quarry than to this film. And I don't know about anyone else, but it only reads just over 84 minutes running time on my DVD player at the end of the credits, not the 88 ""Scary"" minutes as advertised on the back of the box. Everywhere I have looked lists the running time at 88 minutes. Other than that I enjoyed seeing the film again. It really captures the early 70's very well and is a welcome nostalgia trip if nothing else. And don't forget, there is Brenda Dickson to look at!!",1221609600,2,1460,4.451492537313433
1753807,4,B00006G8I7,"Remember the late 60s / early 70s? I sure do! Kids from upper class families were ""dropping out"", ""turning on"", and ""tuning in"" to whatever seemed new and exciting, especially if it meant torturing their ""uptight"" parents! Of course, there was the Viet Nam war and civil rights, but by 1972 a lot of folks had jumped on the bandwagon who were only interested in the fringe benefits of the movement. To them it was all about the long hair, the fringey clothes, the dope, and the ""free love"" (aka: sex w/ strangers on drugs). It all became empty catch-phrases like ""Don't trust anyone over 30"", ""Power to the people"", or ""Make love not war"" on bumper stickers, buttons, and t-shirts. The movement was dead, but the corpse kept right on grooving! Looking back, it all seems pretty silly, but at the time, it was a cultural phenomenon. THE DEATHMASTER takes full advantage of this time period, casting Robert Quarry (Count Yorga himself) as a seemingly benevolent guru-type named Khorda, talking about things that hippies wanted to hear. Pontificating ""deep"" platitudes, he soon has a band of kids at his feet, hanging on his every word. Sadly, many trips are bummed and many mellows harshed, as Khorda reveals his true self. Yep, there's a bloodsucking vampire under all those robes! Our hippies go from dippy desciples to undead plasma-addicts in short order! I really enjoyed this movie, both as a horror movie and a statement about our own willingness to follow...",1156464000,2,1464,4.836653386454183
1753808,4,B00006G8I7,"This movie is just good plain fun to watch.  It's every bit as good, if not better than COUNT YORGA.  It is for sure better than RETURN OF COUNT YORGA.  The premise is quite interesting, as Robert Quarry portrays a Charles Manson type of Vampire who heads a cult of hippies and turns them all, but one, into the Undead.  The ending has a nice twist and includes a very well done effect where the whole cult turns to dust when Quarry is defeated.

Robert Quarry brings class and believability to the role (as he does in the YORGA films).  After meeting him in person a  year or so ago, I came to have a new appreciation for the work of this very intelligent (and surprisingly funny in person) actor.

The cast also includes John Fiedler, who many would know from his numerous T.V. guest roles, and as the voice of Piglet in the many WINNIE THE POOH films.  Also on board is pretty Brenda Dickson, who would later have a several year run on YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS as Jill Foster.

The Retromedia DVD has good sound, good picture and nice extras. In particular, I liked the optional commentary by Robert Quarry. A must for any Vampire fan's collection.",1138060800,2,1149,4.428571428571429

Yeah, it's pretty low-budge.  But a fun low-budge passing of an hour and a half.

Plot: Assorted post-flower child hippies and stereotypical California drifters end up commune-like in a Topanga Canyon mansion, and a super-hip guru steps in to help lead them onto another path to immortality, by turning them into vampires.

You get the entire stock hippie rainbow here, the bearded dude in the bib overalls, the bard with the guitar, the flower girl, the flouncy Hispanic girl in a peasant blouse (non-speaking role), the pseudo-Beatnik in her shockingly tiny waist, midriff shirt and tight pants, the big-afro chick in a tight turtleneck with a big colorful scarf around it, no less, a fuzzy and sunglassed biker dude, and our ""hero"" with his modified hippie Prince Valiant haircut and as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frank-Zappa-famously-said-in-34-Who-Needs-the-Peace-Corps-34/dp/B00004WN7R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frank Zappa famously said in ""Who Needs the Peace Corps?,""</a>&nbsp;""a leather band to go around [his] head.""  All the ladies support the full palette of early 70s eye shadow, lots of seaform green and sky blue--far out, man.

The bad guy is bearded and smooth and well-dressed kind of like an Arabian sheik with some Indian pasha and Jesus robes thrown in, with a very heavy layer of Charlie Manson crazy eyes (and the beard).  This is Topanga Canyon, after all.  The vampire's trusted helper, his hippie Renfield, if you will, is a dashiki-wearing dude with his very own cool-70s theme percussion by the name of Barbado; it seems that Clarence Williams III was busy, or most likely too expensive, so they went with his smaller-fro'd, non-union counterpart.  There is a lot of laughable stock 70s terminology, delivered horribly, about where your head's at, goin' on your trip, getting' it together, man, etc.

You get the contemporary soft focus of waves and the sun and heartfelt folk music about life and spirituality and stuff.  You get a teeny-tiny bit of nudity in the form of a single female bare backside.  And when the vampires finally do their horror thing, you get the traditional 1950s/1960s ultra-schlocky white-face makeup and that stereotypical evil eyes and open-mouth-to-show-the-vampire-fangs gawping of the traditional movie-vampire menace.

The plot holes are massive and start right from the opening minutes, with vampires apparently unable to open doors or go down stairs...and able to go out during the day.  But it's all over and done in a mere 94 minutes, so you can get on to something more cinematically worthwhile.

The only real name star you're going to get is the nicely doomed Pop, played by John Fiedler (b. 1925, d. 2005).  You'll remember him as the similarly doomed Chief Hengist, unfortunately possessed by Redjac in the Star Trek TOS episode ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wolf-in-the-Fold-34/dp/6300213404/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wolf in the Fold""</a>&nbsp;(that's Episode 36, for those of you keeping score at home).  I guess you could cite the lead, Robert Quarry, as a name actor, but his star had risen and mostly fallen by the time this came out.

As an American International Pictures film, yes, you do get the traditional schlocky-horror dark-and-cloudy nighttime sky with the cheezy lightning bolts.  Kinda like a visual Wilhelm Scream.

Bottom line: This is prime B-list horror from the early 70s, updating the traditional vampire bit to the fading culture of Flower Power and the cult horrors of the Manson era.  It's not the worst film I've ever seen (Madonna's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Swept-Away/dp/B000PIM3LG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Swept Away</a>&nbsp;remake), but it's also not the best.",1435968000,,4212,5.5484375
