5128194,4,B0083V2VZK,"LONESOME, while containing a couple of sequences that contain dialogue, should really be considered a silent film.  The silent sequences, as well as the innovative camera work which evokes the experimental techniques employed in German cinema, is what makes this film work and elevates is above many of the films of the era.
The premise of the film centers on a lonesome man and an equally lonesome woman who meet at Coney Island and make a connection. What might be a blissful moment of discovery is interrupted by a roller coaster fire when the pair are separated. Interspersed with scenes from chaotic urban existence, dream sequences, and the momentary respite at the beach, are interesting camera angles. The film also includes color sequences.
Visually this film is a delight and it tells a story with minimal dialogue (I.e., dialogue cards). As interesting as Sunrise was visually, it pales in comparison to Lonesome. The camera work is not only interesting but really quite advanced for its time. For me, the photography is a large part of the story because it sets the mood and tone of the picture as it progresses. The only negative is the amateurish rendering of dialogue in the talking sequences. The inclusion of dialogue was no doubt a tip of the hat to the new technology which would quickly overtake the industry, but it was more irritating than constructive in terms of storytelling. I would have preferred it if they hadn't included the three talking sequences and just left the movie alone when it was remastered.
Also included in this set are director Paul Fejos' musical Broadway as well as The Last Performance with the awesome  Conrad Viedt and screen vixen Evelyn Brent. Both films are interesting, but I really view them as bonuses as Lonesome is the film to watch as it is the most interesting of the trio.",1347494400,2,1832,4.8498402555910545

I hope Criterion give us more and more the best of american cinema.

I cannot finish the operation because when I go to choose my credit card there's
an interruption with a shadow of download turning round eternally over the cards and it is impossible to continue.
Let me know, please, as a costumer, if I'm having any problem with  Amazon. What's wrong ?

5128196,4,B0083V2VZK,"Even though I have been a silent film enthusiast for 50 years now (I started very young) and have read a number of books on the subject as well as having amassed a rather large collection of silent movies on DVD, I can't remember ever having run across the name of Hungarian born director Paul Fejos. I'm sure there must have been something but I simply can't recall it. After watching this Criterion release, it seems unbelievable that his Hollywood films could have been lost for as long as they were. Two of the three films are welcome additions to the silent film catalog while one is a curious early sound offering. All 3 films on this disc were made for Universal so it's only fitting that they reappear in time for the company's 100th anniversary.

The true prize of the collection is LONESOME, a 1929 film that recalls both SUNRISE and 7th HEAVEN in its storyline and in its cinematic expression of that story. Glenn Tryon (who I knew from some Hal Roach comedy shorts) and Barbara Kent (the sister in FLESH & THE DEVIL) play a pair of lonely blue collar workers who discover each other during a visit to Coney Island. They meet, fall in love, and then are separated by a massive rainstorm without knowing their last names. A simple enough story but it's what Fejos does with the material that makes LONESOME so remarkable. Technically this film goes far beyond SUNRISE in its camerawork and editing resulting in an eye opening cinematic experience that the director called a ""Coney Island of the mind"".

The other two films on an additional DVD make for an interesting evening. THE LAST PERFORMANCE stars Conrad Veidt as a jealous stage magician whose love for his young assistant (Mary Philbin in her best performance) leads to tragedy. Imagine one of the Tod Browning Lon Chaney films as if it had been directed by F. W. Murnau and that will give you some idea of what it's like. The print used here was found in Denmark and still has Danish title cards. While that proves the universality of silent movies, it would have been nice if new title cards could have been made. The film has also not been restored and is occasionally contrasty and shows some print damage. It's not ideal but is quite serviceable and Conrad Veidt is amazing.

BROADWAY was one of Universal's early sound extravaganzas. It not only features dialogue and musical numbers but it also has an early Technicolor finale. Unless you are really into early sound musicals, BROADWAY is more of historical interest. There are some truly remarkable camera shots courtesy of the ""BROADWAY crane"" which revolutionized camera movement. The influence on later musicals and Busby Berkeley is obvious. Unfortunately the dialog is incredibly stiff (""Where-is-Steve? He's-in-the-next-room.) and slows down the action. Glenn Tryon is on hand once again as the male lead and it's always great to see Evelyn Brent in anything. This is what THE ARTIST would have been like had it been made in 1929. While this release is an absolute must for silent movie fans others will find it to be of limited interest.",1346544000,21,3070,4.7560975609756095
5128197,5,B0083V2VZK,"Fantastic film on Criterion blu-ray.... Great disc with 3 films by Fejos including The Last Performance and Broadway.... The main feature is the best of the the lot and well worth the price all by itself.... The only problem is that during the few dialogue scenes the main characters make it clear why they never became stars after the silent era....those scenes look like they were taken out of a high school play....nevertheless, this is a great film.... Great city scenes with fantasy elements thrown in here and there....hand-tinted color.... There is also original sound throughout the whole film, as it came out in 1928 when sound was available....it's just that part of the film was made as a silent, so there are title cards to cover the dialogue, but there is a soundtrack and some effects...Good stuff....plus an interesting short doc on the special crane made just for Fejos for some of his innovative camera work.... get it....",1346457600,11,939,4.911949685534591
5128198,4,B0083V2VZK,"Silent film enthusiasts ought to be thrilled with Criterion's release of LONESOME, a 1928 Universal feature from director Paul Fejos, a unique Hungarian who also, in addition to filmmaker, counted doctor and anthropologist among his many lifelong pursuits.

The film's subject matter isn't anything out of the ordinary for the genre - ""Lonesome"" tells the story of a lonely man (Glenn Tryon) and equally single woman (Barbara Kent) living in the urban chaos of New York City, who find one another while on an outing to Coney Island but then become separated when a fire breaks out on one of the rollercoasters. What makes ""Lonesome"" fascinating are the real locations matched with Fejos' ahead-of-its-time direction, which employs a moving, ""inquisitive"" camera, plus color-tinted sequences, unconventional editing and even several sound sequences that were added after the fact to appeal to Hollywood's transition out of the silent era.

Those dialogue sequences may be limp, but the film itself otherwise is one of the more unusual silent films I've ever seen: instead of being static and stilted, the picture has an energy that's a testament to Fejos' style, in addition to an interesting, overriding theme of individuals being lost in the day-to-day world of contemporary life -- something that gives the film a timelessness that holds true today.

A film festival favorite, ""Lonesome"" makes its home video debut with Criterion's Blu-Ray release (also on DVD). The 1080p B&W/color tinted 1.33 transfer is quite good given the extensive restoration performed on the picture, with a fascinating commentary from historian Richard Koszarski; a reconstructed sound version of Fejos' 1929 musical ""Broadway,"" with its all-color finale intact; Fejos' 1929 silent ""The Last Performance"" with Conrad Veidt; a 1963 visual essay on Fejos' life from Paul Falkenberg; an interview with Hal Mohr about the ""Broadway"" camera crane; and extensive booklet notes all included on the supplemental side.",1346025600,20,1987,5.382636655948553
5128209,5,B0083V2VZK,"Criterion is too modest - this is an amazing release not just for the main feature, Lonesome, a fascinating relic of a bygone era showing the unique talents of this forgotten director combined with the ambitious talent of young Carl Laemmle Jr.  But also the two bonus features are fascinating as well, especially Broadway, I suppose (see the nightclub set they built and watch what the amazing, custom-designed, custom-built Broadway crane could do.)  .  But also, The Last Performance, which plays exactly like one of Lon Chaney's unrequited love movies of which he was so fond  - but with Conrad Veidt bringing a more elegant dynamic as the master magician in love with his assistant. (Mary Philbin) who of course loves another.  So this is three full movies - rare, fascinating cinema gems.  The extras are like rare treasures from an archaeological dig.  A total winner.",1392681600,4,875,4.9520547945205475
5128210,4,B0083V2VZK,"I rarely watch any of the bonus features on Criterion discs or any DVDs, for that matter, so I only watched 'Lonesome' on a whim and didn't bother with the bonus. I've only seen two handfuls of silent movies in my life, and was attracted to this one by the reliably attractive Criterion artwork and the director's Hungarian nationality, although the movie is as American as apple-pie.

What a movie! Off the top of my head it's my new favorite romantic comedy, and you'd be hard-pressed to find so many innovative shots and natural acting, outside of three rather-stiff talking scenes, in any other film. You don't have to do that thing watching Lonesome as with some other classic films where you make relative judgments the whole time (""It must have been in the vanguard of its time!"") or desperately pan an otherwise-dull film for little nuggets of cinematic gold. Instead, Lonesome hooks you from the beginning with the humorously intertwined morning routine of two lonely people who are destined to fall in love (a virtuous pursuit and an elevation from the drudgery of working-class employment). The two protagonists have powerful chemistry and make everything and everyone else around them seem vulgar and unclean. Glenn Tryon as Jim is really funny, whether he's getting up late for work or making a stupid face in a photo booth, without venturing into slapstick. The end of the movie after the storm, which is foreshadowed very well at the time Jim and Mary get off of work, is frightening for how easily it could have been an unhappy ending.*

It seems to me that the quality of old film prints has little correlation with the merits of the film, although in this case it seems Criterion did the best job possible, and that most of the visual distractions originated with the film-makers themselves. The soundtrack seems to be original, and therefore spotty because of contemporary technical capabilities, but has very good music, clear, and thankfully, sparse dialogue, and some synchronized sound effects.

*When I mentally reconstructed the shots of the band in the back of the truck, it seemed to me that the physical relationship between their windows would be different than what was suggested at the end, but I'll have to go back and look.

Update: Not my favorite romantic comedy, after I remembered Woody Allen. And the shot of the truck does not conflict with the ending, after another viewing.",1373846400,,2414,4.894865525672372
5128211,5,B0083V2VZK,"It's always a pleasure to discover an unknown artist and his films to one that loves and appreciates the great art that came from the silent era of films. LONESOME is one of those delightful little gems with a director completely unknown to me before seeing this Criterion release. The director is Paul Fejos and LONESOME is a romantic story of two lonely people who meet and fall in love. The simplest of plot but like Murnau's SUNRISE, masterfully directed and photographed. Included in this DVD set are two other Fejos films: the silent LAST PERFORMANCE (1929) with Conrad Veidt and the sound version of the 1929 musical BROADWAY. Along with the notes are in the included booklet and the three feature films the viewer gets a fine early Hollywood history course delivered right to their TV set. Highly recommended.",1363996800,,817,4.8428571428571425
5128212,4,B0083V2VZK,"A victim of the times, this Sunrise-like silent with horribly stuffed in talking parts was unfairly forgotten.  Unfairly sure, but maybe not completely unjustifiably.  It basically seems to be a blend of Sunrise, The Crowd and Speedy.  But the problem is that it is not as visually stunning as Sunrise, lacks the gravity of The Crowd and like almost every other movie ever made - can't compare to the fun and heart of Llyod's Speedy.  Having said that - I did enjoy watching the film and the commentary was very informative.  I think, for me at least, the most effective result of this film was an increased appreciation of the difficulty in making large-budget films in early Hollywood.  So many cooks to spoil the brew, so many developments in technique to employ or avoid in the early stampede to gain an audience by appealing to technical development - something that still provides a challenge for the serious contemporary film fan.  I have a much greater understanding of the transition from silent to talkie as a result of this film.",1363651200,,1040,4.776536312849162

5128214,5,B0083V2VZK,I did not think that this classic and the talkie version of Broadway would ever be released. I've  seen the silent version. I had a half backed restored version. I'm glad criterion released this finally,1361404800,,202,4.771428571428571
5128215,5,B0083V2VZK,"It is known that over 90% of silent films created between the 1900s through the 1920s are lost.

From nitrate damage, decomposition and many being burned in fires caused by neglect, the fact is that back then, a lot of films were made and never preserved.  But a few were, especially those that were blockbuster hits starring Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, Arbuckle, Fairbanks, Pickford, Bow, Talmadge, Barrymore, Laurel & Hardy and also films by directed by Griffith, Murnau, Borzage, Fox, Ford, Capra, Lubitch, Lang, DeMille, to name a few.

And while many of these films have made it onto home video, there have been titles that have been restored but yet have only been seen during screenings.  And some that are looked at as rare gems that have yet to be released to the public after all these years.

One of those titles is ""Lonesome"", a 1928 film which is mostly silent but also a hybrid film with a few scenes with dialogue (an early experimentation of talkie utilization) by filmmaker Paul Fejos.

Fejos may not be a name as easily recognized like Murnau, Griffith or DeMille but that is because Fejos was a jack of all trades.  Born in Hungary, while he has directed films and may documentaries in the United States and other countries, he has held many jobs and is best known for his highly respected work as an anthropologist.  Teaching at Stanford, Yale and Columbia University.

But for a long time, many have wondered if ""Lonesome"" or Fejos's other films would be released on video.  Problem at the time was that the only surviving print that many people saw back in the '90s was the surviving print from Cinematheque francaise with no English titles, although the dialogue that was seen was in English.

But after years of restoration, ""Lonesome"" finally receives its release on Blu-ray and DVD in August 2012 courtesy of the Criterion Collection.  And in addition to ""Lonesome"", also included are the two films ""The Last Performance"" and ""Broadway"".

""Lonesome"" is a 1928 film hybrid film that is primarily silent but with a few scenes with English dialogue.  Possibly the most famous of Fejos's work in his entire oeuvre, the film takes place in New York and we are introduced to two people.  Mary (portrayed by Barbara Kent) is a woman who works as a telephone operator.  After a long day of work, all her female friends are going on dates with their boyfriends, while she has no one to love and is quite lonely.

We are then introduced to Jim (portrayed by Glenn Tryon), a man who works at a factory and after a hard day's work, his guy friends have dates with women and are having fun.  He has no one to love and is quite lonely.

These two individuals live at home alone and realize their life is quite boring and both see an advertisement promoting fun at the beach.  And sure enough, we see both of these individuals deciding to travel to the beach and from that moment, Jim is captivated by Mary.  While Mary flirts a little and plays a little hard to get, the two eventually hang out the beach and talk about their work and lives of being lonely.

But as they spend time with each other, they realize how much they love being together and the two have fun throughout the day at the beach and later at the various attractions, games and rides.

Knowing each other by their first name and realizing that they are probably destined to be each other, both are separated during a rollercoaster ride.  When Jim watches Mary from afar, he notices that her coaster ride's wheels start burning up and begin to catch on fire.  Through the melee, she faints and as he tries to get close to her, he is arrested by police for getting in a way of officers.  Jim tries to explain that he is there for Mary but the police will not listen.  Meanwhile, Mary awakes but Jim is nowhere to be found.

Now Jim and Mary are desperate to find each other.  Will these two lonesome individuals who have discovered their love for each other...lose it all that same day?

In the 1929 silent film, ""The Last Performance"", featuring the last American silent starring Conrad Veidt, the version presented is the silent version with music by Donald Sosin.

VIDEO:

""Lonesome"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:19:1 aspect ratio) and presented in black and white and color.  It's important to note that ""Lonesome"" does exhibit scratches but no major nitrate damage.  It's also important to note that as a silent film fan, when it comes to complete film releases of silent films, you're not going to get pristine copies of films that were made over 80-years-ago.  Some may look impressive on Blu-ray through extensive restoration but for many silent films, you can only hope for a good print source and be hopeful for its restoration.  With ""Lonesome"", the film looks very good considering its age and the fact that it's being release in HD is a major plus because it has been unavailable for along time and only a privileged few who have seen this film were fortunate to watch it at a screening.

A lot of work went to this restoration.  According to Dan Wagner, Head of Preservation at the George Eastman House, ""The restoration of ""Lonesome"" was made possible through a single nitrate print initially conserved by the Cinematheque francaise in Paris. Henry Langlois, the mythic head of the Cinematheque, gave this surviving print to the also legendary James Card at George Eastman House, in Rochester, New York in the mid-1960s. Shortly after arriving there, ""Lonesome"" went through its first preservation, with the gorgeous tinted and hand-colored film being transferred to black and white. ""

Wagner continued, ""The titles also received a dramatic facelift. Extensive research was done on Universal titles of the period. And a bit of good fortune came with a single frame of an English intertitle left behind when the translation to French was done in the late twenties. Thus, the Silentina Film Font was chosen for the intertitles. The main titles are a combination of the fonts Broadway and Ultramodern Classic.""

""The restoration lab Cinetech, in Valencia, California, brought together image, audio and intertitles, producing a new 35 mm preservation negative and prints - and a definitive restoration of Lonesome.""

According to the Criterion Collection, ""the new digital transfer was created in 2K resolution on a Spirit 4K Datacine from the 35 mm restoration black-and-white and color duplicate negatives, which were assembled digitally. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS and Pixel Farm's PFClean, while Image Systems' Phoenix was used for small, dirt, grain and noise reduction.""

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Lonesome"", ""Broadway"" and ""The Last Performance"" is presented in monaural (LPCM 2.0).  As much work that has been put to restore the video, a lot of work went into cleaning up the audio for its restoration.

According to Dan Wagner, Head of Preservation at the George Eastman House, ""In 2008, with the 1994 print long past its best days and the original nitrate print beginning to decompose, an effort was undertaken to finally complete the restoration of ""Lonesome"". The problem with the soundtrack had always been that modern playback equipment rendered it with brutal honesty. The hiss, pops, and crackles accrued over a long life blared with stunning clarity over these amplifiers and speakers. George Eastman House worked with the technicians at Chace Audio by Deluxe, in Burbank, California, to remove this white-noise wear and tear, while taking care to retain the quality of Hollywood's earliest experiment in sound. Now, instead of being ad in of often indistinguishable noise, the music and sound effects support the film with a cacophony of the clang and clatter of Coney Island's midway and dance halls.""

The original monaural soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from an optical track print. Clicks, thumps, hiss, and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD. Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated workstation.

Mason Jr.'s interview with Paul Fejos from 1962 as part of Columbia University's Oral History Research Program.

JUDGMENT CALL:

For many years, silent film fans have hoped to watch Paul Fejos's ""Lonesome"".  Most have heard comparisons of Fejos's film to F.W. Murnau's ""Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans"" and Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"", but the fact was that for many years, ""Lonesome"" was a rare film to see at a silent film screening.

Due to the fact that the only surviving print was a the French version at the time, that is what many people saw.  Regardless, despite no English intertitles, the film is simple and easy to follow.  The storyline is about two lonely individuals who meet at the beach and discover love for each other, but due to circumstances, among the huge crowd in what I presume is Coney Island, they are separated from each other and both fear they have lost each other.

And as a romance film, the storyline is touching and entertaining.  But what makes ""Lonesome"" so magnificent is its presentation for its time.  Using an experimental style, the cinematography not only captures the fun of these two individuals spending time together, but there are cool transitions, good and not clumsy use of double and triple exposures, tight and efficient editing and the fact that it is a hybrid film that is primarily silent but has moments where the cast is talking and dialogue can be heard, there are noticeable influences.

For one, we see the use of Fritz Lang style structures.  German Expressionism used in showcasing big structures and the feeling of a heavy storm in the city as dark thunder clouds move in and similar to F.W. Murnau's ""Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans"" where a huge storm starts to disrupt the large attendance at Coney Island.  Heavy showers hitting everyone and air of despair strikes our two main characters.

While ""Metropolis"" and ""Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans"" are much deeper films and with large production value, the fact is that filmmaker Paul Fejos was able to transform what could have been a banal film, to a film with an amazing visual style for its time.

Granted, early talkies were known for its cheesiness and some utilized sound well earlier on, other's didn't.  While the acting was not the best during the dialogue portions, this was typical for films that utilized sound during that time.  Possibly the only scene that felt unusual is hearing the long pause as Jim tries to tell a police officer off.  Corny in a Poverty Row type of way (for those familiar with those type of films) but as a person interested in early film and how technology or early sound was used in cinema, I found if fascinating and fun.

But both Glenn Tryon and Barbara Kent did a great job in their roles and making the audience feel these two are in love with each other, they belong with each other and you end up pulling for them to be together!  It's what I love about this early romantic film.

And with this Blu-ray release, while ""Lonesome"" is only 69-minutes long, the Criterion Collection demonstrates why fans love this company.  And they deliver by adding two more of Paul Fejos's films, ""The Last Performance"" and ""Broadway"" to this Blu-ray release.

""The Last Performance"" is a film about jealousy, while ""Broadway"" is an early talkie and gangster film.  While not great films, ""The Last Performance"" will interested silent film fans who enjoy the work of actor Conrad Veidt, as the film was his final silent film before returning to Germany.  And the film also starred actress Mary Philbin (""The Phantom of the Opera"" and ""The Man Who Laughs"").  It's a good ""Who done it?"" type of film but just not great.

""Broadway"" was interesting in the fact that it was Universal's first foray into Technicolor and also was the first film to utilize Tungsten lamps.  While the film was OK, filmwise, I was more interested in Hal Mohr's cinematography and his use of the crane.  There is a special feature included with this Blu-ray release in which Mohr goes into detail of how complex it was to utilize the crane for the film.

As for the Blu-ray release, video quality is subjective.  As mentioned, when it comes to silent films, I am not going to criticize a silent film for its picture quality knowing that a lot of films I have watched have scratches, nitrate decomposition or major damage.  Personally, whenever we are able to be given a complete silent film that is viewable and still looks good with no damage but scratches and occasional flickering, for me, that is a plus!  ""Lonesome"" is a wonderful film that has been out of public release for so long but now people get to experience it on Blu-ray thanks to the hard work that came to its restoration.

You're not going to get pristine quality, nor are many companies able to afford the kind of restoration that went to Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" or even Buster Keaton's ""The General"", let alone finding negative sources that are not damaged, so people should not be too picky of silent films for its picture quality.

""Lonesome"" looks very good, no major damage and is complete.  That's the best that we can hope for and very appreciative that the Criterion Collection released this wonderful romantic film, along with two other Paul Fejos films.

You also get special features which include audio commentary and a virtual essay featuring Paul Fejos produced by Paul Falkenberg and Fejos's wife Lita Binns Fejos and learn more about Paul Fejos's life and career.

Overall, ""Lonesome"" is a fantastic Blu-ray release.  If you are passionate about silent films, this Blu-ray release contains three rare films that were not accessible to many silent film fans for so long and now here we are with a Blu-ray and DVD release getting the Criterion Collection treatment.

Silent film and early Talkie fans are definitely in for a treat as ""Lonesome"" from the Criterion Collection is simply a must have and must own Blu-ray release!",1354320000,9,15030,4.877952755905512

I also collect 100+ year old Coney Island postcards. So imagine my delight when the  film Lonesome 1928 turned out to be a delightfully rewarding film that is set in the Coney Island that existed when it was one of the most amazing places on Earth.
The director Paul Fejos was a maveric visionary among Hollywood directors and this film displays his talents in abundance. He uses editing and design derived from his awareness of avante-garde and European cinema with exciting camera angles and impressive crowd scenes. The film was started as a silent film but three passages we're inserted with sound. The color tinting on the print used for this DVD are bright and fresh and thrilling. Lonesome is an exciting film with one foot in the silent era and one foot in the sound era.
There are two other films included here. Broadway is remarkable for it's extravagent Art Deco interiors and costumes (those skyscraper inspired dresses and head pieces are a hoot). The giant crane built to film within the cavernous nightclub set allows the audience to swoop around a multileveled Deco wonderland filled with partiers that are really having a ball. There are some fun two color technicolor sequences in this film.

Lonesome is as simple as can be, and a total heartbreaker, gorgeously directed and acted, about two sad urban dwellers who find enchantment out at Coney Island for the day.

8524838,3,B0083V2VZK,"This Blu-Ray release contains as main-movie: ""Lonesome"" starring Barbara Kent and handsome Glenn Tryon.
Both playing lonesome hearts in the big city of New York and deciding to go to Coney Island to celebrate the Fourth of July Weekend after having a long working day/week.

Fazit: its a nice lovestory with a surprising ending. Just a few scenes might be a little bit to ""long"" but otherwise it makes sense for a ""long""-working-day.
Jim's (Glenn Tryon) Friend is played by Andy Devine.
nteresting: the movies was meant to be silent but contains 3 short talking/dialogue scenes and also some color-scenes (at the carnival).
The Picture Quality: I would call it not perfect but good. The Dialogue scenes have better picture Quality than the silent scenes.

As bonus are added two more movies:

a musical called ""BROADWAY"" (104 MIN), the studios first talking movie (but also a silent version was released) which contains Technicolor-Sequences also starring Glenn Tryon.

The other by far more interesting, entertaining movie is ""The Last Performance"" which was believed to be lost but a danish copie survived and was used (incl. danish intertitels) for this Blu-Ray Release: optional English Subitles available (!)

Star of this movie is Conrad Veidt (""Casablanca"") as Erik the Great who is in love with is young assistant Julie. Erik catched a thief, Mark (played by handsome Fred MacKaye, his next movie was ""Our Dancing Daughters"") but is giving him a chance to work for him. Mark and Julie going to be in love which Erik don't like. He makes a evil decision.

The picture Quality is good.

One more ""true"" Bonus is a audio-record (optional english Subtitles available) by Paul Fejos who talks about his life and working on the movies - which might be interesting for movie goers/fans.

FAZIT: Criterion did it again - releasing some rare-seen titles. The Set contains also a 34-page-booklet.

8524839,5,B0083V2VZK,"Didn't know much about this film until I saw it listed by the Criterion Collection and as a student of silent film, it aroused my interest.  So glad it did because this 1928 film by Paul Fejos is a delightful revelation. Not entirely silent as it was released at the time of the beginning of talkies and some dialog scenes were added and although they are a little clumsy it won't spoil your appreciation of this beautiful work of art.  Only 69 minutes long but a truly enchanting time spent with the lovely Barbara  Kent and Glenn Tryon, two lonesome souls who discover each other, lose each other and then find each other again all in one day!  Brilliantly realized by Paul Fejos, stunningly lensed by Gilbert Warrenton and produced under the Carl Laemmle Jr. banner at Universal this a must for silent movie buffs.
As well, there are so many terrific extras on this two-disc set.  The audio commentary by noted film historian Richard Koszarski  is of the highest calibre; one of the most interesting and informative  I have heard accompanying a feature (I watched the film with the audio commentary  immediately after watching the feature by itself).  Also on disc one is a visual essay on the director by his wife, featuring Fejos narrating his life and career and that is quite a revelation as well.  Certainly a well-lived life in so many different fields!
Disc two has the 1929 Conrad Veidt silent, directed by Fejos, ""The Last Performance"" and a reconstructed sound version of the famous but incomplete ""Broadway"" with its innovative camera techniques (with audio interview with cinematographer Hal Mohr).  And if that is not enough, there is also a 32 page booklet loaded with articles and photos on Paul Fejos and his films.  And as to be expected, the Criterion restoration is superb. A great buy and more importantly, a treasure rediscovered.",1408060800,,1854,4.813880126182966
8524840,5,B0083V2VZK,"""Lonesome"" is a fantastic silent film that I'm so glad was fully restored and remastered; otherwise, I probably never would've heard of it. It's a story about a young man and a young woman who work hard all day and meet at a beach one day. They don't know it yet, but they are destined to be together and will soon find out. Unfortunately, fate intervenes and they are separated; will they find each other again? It seems impossible. The sound and color sequences, as well as the black and white, are excellent quality, as Criterion has a reputation for pristine quality films. The story is romantic and the characters are very likable; you root for them all the way through the movie. I highly recommend this one.",1404518400,,714,4.5859375
8524841,3,B0083V2VZK,"Being a fan of great silent films, I took a chance based on what I'd read from other viewers and went ahead and bought this Blu-ray.  It was charming alright, and the acting was surprisingly realistic and modern, but I was somewhat disappointed in what I felt were some belabored and overlong scenes - like the scene near the end when the two lovers lose each other.  This film led me finally to conclude there's a reason I'd never heard of ""Lonesome"" before - it just plain aint all that great.  It certainly is undeserving of the royal Criterion treatment it is given.  Another reviewer mentioned this compares favorably with Murnau's ""Sunrise"".  Any true connoisseur of silent films can tell you ""Lonesome"" doesn't hold a candle to Murnau's masterpiece.  Perhaps a descendant of Paul Fejos either co-owns or has pull at Criterion and insisted it be ""done"" because I can think of LOT of other films that ought to have been done before this one.",1394582400,,946,4.703030303030303
