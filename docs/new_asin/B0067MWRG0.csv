8494365,5,B0067MWRG0,"I highly recommend this concert blu-ray.  I don't know if Girls Generation will ever perform here in the midwest, but I am so glad I can experience them in top form on this concert Blu-ray.  If you like Girls Generation, you will love this concert Blu-ray.",1407369600,,256,4.543478260869565

Highly recommended for the kpop fan! SONE <3",1381536000,,122,5.15

8494368,5,B0067MWRG0,"I've been following KPOP for the last two years and have seen thousands of various kpop videos.  When I discovered this group>>SNSD (Girls Generation), I discovered the best group in the world.  When I saw THIS concert performance I was in heaven.  You will NOT see a better concert anywhere.

These girls could easily be headliners at a Las Vegas casino.  They are a Korean group who have mastered singing in Japanese and are working on their English.  Japan concerts are state of the art type stages with all the stops.  You will not want to miss these performances by Girls Generation.

If you have any doubt about this #1 KPOP group from Korea...just go on youtube and see for yourself.  Then buy this and enjoy it forever.  There is no doubt this is a top FIVE STAR DVD.",1352592000,2,775,4.510791366906475
8494369,5,B0067MWRG0,"This won't be a great review, I'm mainly trying to balance out the rating caused by the ludicrous 1-star review.

I've been watching this video over and over the past week or so. The biggest standout to me is Taeyeons' 2 minute Devils' Cry (which you can find on youtube). There'
s also two back to back segments that look like they're doing a kids show. I skipped over them at first, now I just keep watching them, the girls all look so happy doing it. They wear many outfits throughout the concert, and perform a lot of songs, including Gee, Genie, and Hoot.

I would say every fan would highly enjoy this concert video. You can, as of July 2012 (and April 2013), get these from Amazon.co.jp for significantly less than $100. On a lot of pages there's a ""see this page in English"" link, which definitely helps. Shipping charges are high. But the non-deluxe DVD is $35, the non-deluxe blu ray is about $42, the deluxe DVD is $65 and the deluxe blu ray is $82

******* Update Oct 7: I just keep watching this, absolutely love it. If you were only going to buy one SNSD item, this is it. If you're going to buy three, I'd get this,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Girls-Generation/dp/B004XK1EZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Girls' Generation</a>&nbsp;(search, there's at least four listings for their first Japanese album), and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twinkle/dp/B007XOOFXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twinkle</a>.

8494370,5,B0067MWRG0,"This one's probably going to go down in history as their best; I've been following the girls of SNSD (Korean name of Girls Generation) since their debut in 2007, and they just keep getting better. They've grown into their bodies and voices, and this is one incredible concert. To the other reviewer, no, they're not Japanese, but anyone who ever heard of them would already know that, so I can just assume you're one of those people who hate them for no reason and just want to lower their video's rating to kill sales. But you won't be able to. I had already downloaded and watched this concert on 'yootoob', and was so impressed that I immediately bought the blu ray edition. Now, I'm 55 years old; and have seen hundreds of concerts here in the states; but this is one of the best I've ever seen, by ANYBODY! In HD projected onto a 10 foot screen, and surround, it's just like being there, fantastic. You can find the region free versions of the blu ray and dvd via links on soshified dot com (where you can also find translations for the songs if you wish). But I have a region free player, so I got this as soon as it came out.
Buy it and watch. And watch again and again. It's that good. Oh, and did I fail to mention that they're all stunningly beautiful, besides being able to sing? (yes, it took years of training to figure out how to sing while dancing and getting into shape to do it, and they did change the choreography to allow the next singer to rest a bit before doing their solo vocal parts).
This concert is available as blu ray and dvd in both deluxe, and standard editions. The disks are the same.",1331596800,4,1617,4.322368421052632
