414471,3,6301967712,"This was fair as a movie, but an extremely poor adaptation of one of the finest novels ever written.  It would be comparable to a cartoon version of Hamlet.  Cobb is outstanding as Fyodor and Brynner is quite good as Dmitri, but they are hamstrung by a phenomenally flat script.  Shatner is a disaster as Alyosha and the other characters are not particularly memorable.  If you have not read the book, this is a decently enjoyable film.  The original story is pared down and the ending changed, but still OK for a light viewing.  If you have read the novel, however, this film will be neither entertaining not elucidating.",990835200,20,622,4.660550458715596
414472,4,6301967712,"One of my all-time favorite novels, and now one of my favorite videos.  Of course the book is better.  A movie could never approach the philosophical breadth that Dostoyevsky does in his classic novel, nor could it develop the characters as fully and as masterfully. Lament that the ""Grand Inquisitor"" does not make an appearance in the film, and that the character of Father Zossima (a very significant figure in the novel) is not developed at all.  But, for a movie, it's quite well done and worth the watch.  Even my kids enjoyed it (my 10 yr-old daughter figured out the murder mystery before it was revealed).  Yul Brynner is very concvincing and, I'm no ""trekie,"" but Shatner rules!  I liked it.",979689600,6,701,4.704918032786885
414473,2,6301967712,"A very interesting movie if you don't want to relate it to the book. However, if you have read the book prior to watching this movie you will know the obvious flaws. Movie emphasizes on Grushenka and Demitri, and the struggle between them and the father Karamazov. The book takes more philosophical approach and fulfills a purposeful debate about the existence of God. If I had to chose between the book and the movie- I would chose the book without thinking twice. I recommend the viewer to read the book before watching the book. This will help him see the shortcomings of the movie.",973209600,8,585,4.634615384615385

414545,5,6301967712,"The movie was good but after reading the book it became very obvious that due to the length of the novel that certain segments were left out of the film.  I first saw this film when I was in my teens and it made very little impact on me because I had not read the book.  I thought the scenery and the music were wonderful.  Yul Brynner, Albert Salmi, Maria Schell and Claire Bloom were excellent.  I have to admit that I have never cared for William Shatner or Lee J. Cobb so I see no need to comment on them.  Richard Basehart was ok.  I would recommend that anyone should spend time reading ""The Brothers"" before buying the disc.  Even though the film has been abridged it is still well done and worth viewing.  I loved the book and will undoubtedly reread it again in the future.",1491350400,,782,4.236486486486487

414732,5,6301967712,"A very good interpretation of an extremely complex novel. Brooks, the director, usually tears novels and plays to shreds (Lord Jim, Sweet Bird Of Youth, Cat On A Hot Tin Roof, to name a few). Here he sticks to the plot as well as he can. The ending of the novel is wide open, and so Brooks opts for solutions, closure etc. This is alright, for the film gets across the central themes: Dysfunctional family, parricide, guilt, fear, Godlessness, Nihilism, the Trial theme, exile..here avoided.. and the selfish nature of Romance.

Yul Brynner and Maria Sch-ell are excellent, as is Claire Bloom, William Shatner, and Richard Baseheart. Very moving performances, all of them deeply committed, all had read the book over and over, and Julius and Philip Epstein (Casablanca) wrote with great care the final adaptation. It has been sited as one of the better scripts out of Hollywood..even thought the actors are largely British, Russian or are from the legit. theatre.

Maria Schell's erotic dance, the the dance that entraps Dimitri (Yul Brynner) is famous. She is absolutely stunning.
Claire Bloom is magnificent, almost insane in her approach to Brynner and to his impending exile. She has that iciness that can turn florid in an instant..and it is very effective.
The rest of the cast is first rate, and the gypsy music is very alluring. Brynner supposedly came from the lands east of Moscow, Salatrin Island, way to the north. This is why he knows the mysterious songs so well, not just here but particularly in Anastasia with Ingrid Bergman.

William Shatner is a true actor. Too bad about Star Trek taking over everything . He had great potential. He gives a moving, truly religious performance here.

Buy it and see. Also too, the Russian 520 min version and the book. It all comes together.",1405987200,9,1794,4.852941176470588

414790,3,6301967712,"I'm a great fan of Dostoevsky and have read most of his works. ""The Brothers Karamazov"" is his last masterpiece, after a string of other wonderful books from ""Crime and Punishment"", ""The Idiot"", ""The Possessed"" and tons of short stories / novellas (""White Nights"", ""Notes from the Underground"", ""The Double""...).. I could go on and on, but a writer like Dostoevsky comes along once every few centuries. It's a challenging task to film any of his books, as his writing is so personal, getting deep within the character, exposing their innermost thoughts to the point where you become uncomfortable, as we identify the darkness within ourselves, something that is part of every human being.. There is no black and white with Dostoevsky, everything is gray and the human soul is presented for what it is - an imperfect, conflicted, complex thing that we work on daily, every hour, every minute and every second, as there is an abyss that could open at any minute. However, the ""good"" strive to better themselves, to overcome their flaws after recognizing them for what it is, with deep honesty. This is true of Dmitri, a very complex character, full of life, determination, courage, honor but ultimately, very flawed in many ways. This dangerous ground is what Dostoevsky makes his characters tread, it is what makes them human and we're able to identify ourselves in each of them. That honesty is rare and cannot be easily translated onto the screen.

In this film, there is a simplistic focus on just one character, Dmitri Karamazov and his relationship with his father, his mistress and his betrothed. However, all of these other characters are secondary, including the greatest character in the book, Ivan Karamazov, whose tormented soul is but barely glimpsed in this novel, as also Alyosha / Father Zossima (another conflicted mystic) / Smerdayakov (the illegitimate son). As some reviewers have pointed out, forget about the book and watch it just as a movie and it's fine, with a great performance by Yul Brynner. In every scene he's in, he dominates the landscape and you can't take your eyes away from him. Yul does a fantastic job of presenting Dmitri to the audience and in many respects, he is true to the book and makes him come alive. I couldn't really identify with any of the other characters, including the father (I had a slightly different image in my mind when I read the book). Most of the other characters are mere cardboard cutouts, with zero depth.",1377561600,2,2470,4.866983372921615
414791,5,6301967712,"Here is the straight story, stripped of much of the psychological hand-wringing of the book.  The book will stay with you for the long term.  But there is no topping this for a great story beautifully told.  This movie is worth the price of admission simply to see Yul Brynner, Lee J. Cobb and a very young Captain Kirk tangling over two beautiful women.  The whodunnit and the family drama are icing on the cake.  This movie still packs a punch 55 years after it was made.

414870,5,6301967712,"I am glad to have watched this, although I certainly can't say it was a lot of fun. Doestoyevsky was just so Russian! The weather and the lighting matched the weight of the subject. The various actors gave great performances. William Shatner in his film debut, with barely a hint of the Captain who was to come. Lee J. Cobb was thoroughly dissolute, the character you would love to hate. William Basehart was somewhat less compelling but his character was nonetheless important to the story. Yul Brynner was at his best as his character developed. You could see his fascination with Grushenka turn to obsession. There is a wonderful scene as he speaks with his brother, the Shatner character, and reveals his understanding that he is obsessed and his inability to do anything about it. Albert Salmi was particularly effective in the character of the bastard son who finally strikes back. I did find the total turnaround of Maria Schell's character (Grushenko) to be somewhat less than credible. She was beautiful and vitally alive, but her character's continual smirk and inability to remain consistent from moment to moment did not lend themselves to the abrupt change that was presented toward the end of the film. If you simply want to be entertained, this may not be what you're looking for, but I found it well worth viewing.",1362614400,4,1330,4.863436123348017
414871,3,6301967712,"This movie seems to go through most of the main actions of the novel, but practical limitation of screen time prevents development of some of the characters which is so much a part of the novel's appeal.  Yul Brynner does a pretty fair job portraying the flamboyant Dmitri, Lee Cobb a good job with the selfish and glutenous father. The actor doing the illegitimate half brother is suitably evil and scheming - maybe a little too much so.  However, the character of brother Ivan (the complex intellectual) seems to me poorly developed and brother Alexey seems little more than an errand boy.  Many of the sub plots which make the novel so rich are omitted, undoubtedly due to time constraints",1361750400,2,692,4.75

I thought that the book was too loosely plotted and wanted to get a better feel of the narrative.  The acting was excellent, including a very young William Shattner.  Unfortunately, except for Yul Brynner, the actors did not seem Russian.  Also,  Dostoyevsky is a philosopher, as are all Russian novelists, and his novels do not translate easily into film.  I am glad that I saw the movie because it helped me to understand the story better.

I have been looking for a VHS or a DVD of this movie ever since and when I ordered it from Amazon, I could not wait to receive it, but in the bottom of my heart I was worried that it may have been a little dated and that maybe my memory of it, over glamorised it, BUT it was just as exciting and sensual as I had remembered it and DEFINITELY NOT DATED IN ANY WAY. Even the soundtrack is brilliant.
The late Yul Brynner, Maria Schell, Claire Bloom and Lee J.Cobb had such a wonderful electrifying chemistry between them that I doubt if ever this movie is going to be outdated.  There are not too many films today that have such an impact on the powerhouse performances of the real Hollywood of yesteryear.
If anybody has not seen this movie I absolutely recommend it in every way.  We miss you Mr. Brynner as you were a true artist in all the roles and all the films you represented the many varied characters in all genres.

414911,4,6301967712,Brothers Karamazov is one of the best DVD s and this DVD has excellent acting and cinematography.  I wish the resolution of the DVD had been better.,1320451200,2,148,4.481481481481482
414912,5,6301967712,"Actually, the script is a fairly bare-bones version of Dostoevsky's sweeping epic about a family of sharply delineated characters, but the casting and acting along with a fair amount of cinematic action and heated romance (Maria Schell's Grushenka is ravishing) is more than enough to capture a young male spectator's fancy, leading him to the original literary source, with its famed ""Grand Inquisitor"" chapter (omitted from the film version).

You know that this family of a lecherous, drunken father (Cobb) and four equally individualistic and independent sons is not exactly representative of your ""normal"" 19th century Victorian family when the most sane and sober, composed and rational member of the group is William Shatner, the young monk!

The film might even hold up--at least in several of its characterizations and in the electricity generated by Brynner and Schell-- after reading the novel, but I wouldn't count on it.  It's the perfect preliminary to a reading of Dostoevsky's great novel (though I have little doubt that ""Crime and Punishment"" would have seemed at least a little less boring, mono-thematic and interminable had I read it before, rather than after, ""Brothers Karamazov"").  On the other hand, after ""C & P"" many readers may not have sufficient motivation to take on ""Brothers Karamazov,"" a far stronger story (or, if the reader insists, ""C & P"" is Dostoesvsky's ""Iliad"" whereas ""Brothers"" is his ""Odyssey"").

This film has a warm heart, and there's an unmistakable fiery glow to many of the indoor scenes, as if the director relied primarily on the natural light from a fire place to portray the heated passion of characters whose ardor cannot be cooled by the deep Russian winter.  Whereas film versions of of ""War and Peace"" and ""Dr. Zhivago"" emphasize the the crystalline and icy, coldly beautiful and frigidly repelling landscape of the Russian countryside, seeming rather static in their representation of frozen if dangerous beauty, ""The Brothers Karamazov"" concentrates squarely on its unforgettable (even after 50 years) seven main characters, each of whom delivers beyond expectations.  Just as I'd spend extra on Blu Ray for a film like ""Picnic,"" the better to experience the sparks thrown off by Holden and Novak, the encounters between Bryner and Schell are every bit as heated, practically calling for not just a Blu Ray remastered print but, if you can find one, an asbestos suit!

Even though Maria Schell's and Brynner's chemistry in the foreground of the frame is likely to make either the love of any impressionable viewer's life, there are enough implicit theological themes in the margins of the frame for the reader's later discovery of the life of love that is the author's primary concern. In the film, selfish desires and Eros rule (Schell is irresistible) ; in the novel, Agape wins the day.",1311120000,3,2848,5.109677419354838

414954,5,6301967712,"While no Hollywood production could do justice to Dostoevsky's Brothers Karamazov (without running to a 10 hour marathon flick), this rendition does better than could be expected. The screenplay, while necessarily incomplete, is relatively faithful to the classic it is based on. The direction and the cast assembled for this ambitious project are stellar.  I saw it years ago as a teenager, when it was a new movie, and all these years have wanted to see it again. The impetus to search for it came in connection with the new translation of the book just out, which I am reading with a Christian classics book-discussion group.",1301270400,10,628,4.9245283018867925
414955,3,6301967712,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. For one side, I find it awful; a complete oversimplification of one of the all time literary masterpieces, too focused on just one of the three main characters. But in the other side, one must understand that it's impossible to visually encase -not even in a 9 hours long miniseries, much less in a two hours movie- all the religious, philosophic and melodramatic issues of such pivotal book.
Given that, I appreciate the excellent production values and the few, short scenes that are almost carbon copied from the book. It also has a very fluid pacing and great narrative string. And the cast is near perfection:  I can't imagine anybody else playing Father Karamazov than Lee C. Jacobs; also perfect as Dimitri is macho man par excellence Yul Brynner . And although I would like to see Richard Basehart looking 10 years younger, he is Ivan Karamazov. There was no better actor to portray the layers of complexity of this character; cold and intellectual in the surface but at the same time conflicted with both the sensual instincts of Dimitri and the mystical concerns of younger Alexsei.  William Shatner and Albert Sami are very good also; my only cast quibble is Maria Schell as Grushenka, I find her simply annoying!
And that's my ultimate content about this movie: it has such an excellent cast that it's a pity its main focus is Dimitri's and that we don't get to see much of the others  ... just imagine what an extra five minutes scene showing Ivan's delirium with his devil would had added to the movie ...
In the end, it's still good to own it. But please, oh please, powers to be, give us a proper DVD release. This item is a Spanish DVD release with the original English and also Spanish dubbed soundtrack. Neither the quality of the sound or the image is very good, but watchable enough. Despite falling short on almost everything but the great cast, this movie deserves wider availability.",1296172800,11,1946,4.700879765395895

414960,5,6301967712,"It practically goes without saying that this Hollywood production is inadequate as an adaptation of a monumental novel.  On the other hand, even when judged as an adaptation, ""Brothers Karamazov"" strikes me as superior to efforts to film similar weighty Russian novels such as ""War and Peace"" and ""Dr. Zhivago.""  The elder Karamazov (Lee J. Cobb) and his four sons, including Yul Brynner, Richard Basehart, and William Shattner,  are so sharply realized they have remained vivid in my memory for over four decades.  The same goes for Maria Schell (whose alluring, enigmatic magnetism must have had the same effect on me as Garbo's persona is said to have had on audiences in the '30's) and Claire Bloom, the two women vying for Brynner's affections.  Finally, credit the evocative score of Bronislaw Kaper (""On Green Dolphin Street"") and the efficient yet imaginative direction of Richard Brooks (responsible for the equally underrated ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar"").

Were it not for this movie, I would never have nursed a life-long crush on Maria Schell (the vital and resonant Grushenka) or become devoted to Dostoesky's fiction.  Worse, I might never have met the Grand Inquisitor and become engaged in a theological quest that continues unabated.",1123200000,67,1248,5.17910447761194

It is one of my favorite ""old movies"", you see multi-dimensional sides of the charactors as they deal with love, greed,family conflicts and jealousies.

It is about four brothers, their relationship with each other and with their father, sexual depravity, love and love betrayed, and about a murder and a trial.
One brother, the main character played by Yul Brynner, is a compulsive gambler with an incipient conscience that he does not recognize. He is constantly in debt and in no hurry to repay what he owes. Another son is a priest, totally unlike his siblings. He is very pious. No wrong is evident. Another is an atheist. He believes that people can do what they like because there is no god and no accounting for misdeeds, except by human courts. Yet we do not see him do anything wrong. To the contrary, he is very kind and considerate. The fourth son is illegitimate. His father refuses to acknowledge him as his son and uses him to perform menial tasks. He likes his brother who is an atheist and believes there is no god as he does. Their father is a mean drunk and womanizer. He is infatuated by a woman to whom he offers large sums of money for intercourse. She agrees, but also has sex with many others. The son played by Brynner falls in love with her, creating a problem with his father. She is in love with neither, but in love with a Polish man she hasn't seen in five years.
Complicating their lives further is a rich woman who falls in love with Brynner. She wants to marry him and offers him lots of money. She knows about Brynners love of the other woman and does not like what he feels and what he is doing. The atheist brother falls in love with her, but he is rejected.",1492473600,,1729,4.474683544303797
