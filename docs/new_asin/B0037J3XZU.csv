8390607,4,B0037J3XZU,"This is the 2006 final episode (titled ""The Last War"") of the TV Train Man series that was shown in 2005 covering 12 episodes.  The TV show was originally shown in 11 episodes with a following special episode 12 titled ""Train Man vs. Guitar Man"".  The first 11 episodes developed the storyline from the beginning encounter between Train Man and Hermes and their developing relationship.  Episode 12 followed the storyline of the original 11 episodes, but diverted the focus to two other characters (one of the Train Man's friends and a chat forum member).  The final episode 13 picked up about a year from the previous episodes and continued with the relationship between Train Man and Hermes.  The plot of this episode focuses on Hermes' grandfather financial problems which then brings about an attempt to marry off Hermes to a man who has big financial assets that can help Hermes' grandfather's company from bankruptcy.  Train Man becomes ambivalent about continuing his relationship with Hermes and then seeks to find a black pearl in Tahiti that will provide a future answer on his relationship with Hermes.  Train Man's rival tries to manipulate himself into the position of marrying Hermes and to expose the identity of Train Man in public by offering a large reward.  The chat forum members come to the aid of Train Man when the identity of the Train Man is set to be broadcast on the air.  Many of the characters from the previous 12 episodes return for this final episode (one notable absence is Hermes' brother character).  This episode isn't as funny as the previous ones and the diversion to Tahiti may be a bit tedious (the scenery of Tahiti though is gorgeous), but the reunion of nearly everyone in the TV series after one year was welcome and enjoyable.  Please watch the TV series from the beginning (episodes 1 through 11, episode 12 being optional) because the plot development makes more sense than just watching this episode alone.",1297296000,,1954,4.855421686746988
