3060597,5,B001165BG0,"I almost let this one go as the description talked of a girl jabbering on and on and him having to rescue her. This sounded potentially irritating. As it had got good star ratings I decided to try it.
For its genre it was actually quite satisfying. The girl only blabbers early on in the movie when the boy and girl meet on a train and it then goes on to look at the effects of the encounter of these two opposite personalities on each other. For him it literally saves his life and turns his life round. She in turn finds more balance and ends up bubbly rather than blubbery.
As so many Indian movies this started off with the superficial and then ended up somewhere else with a warmer deeper look into the protagonists.
I wasn't familiar with Shahid Kapoor the leading man. He looks like Clark Kent (as played by Dean Cain) and is very watchable. He doesnt dance much which is a pity as his background is in dance and he is very watchable. The girl Kareena Kapoor (no relation) is good too and is doing a natural bubbly.
One of those movies that is lightweight but an enjoyable spending of time with some nice people learning about life. While compared to other deeper movies I have seen it may not be 5 stars. I found its music OK but no catchy tune to take away with me. It is lightweight but for its genre it was a pleasant experience and perhaps star ratings are about a genre and to draw others attention to specific buys.",1225497600,,1429,4.296296296296297
3060598,2,B001165BG0,"Upon reading all of these reviews about ""Jab We Met"" and being a Bollywood fan myself, I went out and brought the movie.

I was imagining this film would be pleasantly light, simplistically beautiful, and a rare new find in the sea of predictable hindi films...

If you are a fan but want a movie to sweep you off of your feet, Jab We Met is not the movie! I was so dissappointed. My expectations were not high at all. The only thing that sticks out in my brain from this movie is Kareena Kapoor's excessive TALKING! She does not keep her mouth shut for the first 30 minutes of the film. Now I'm sure the writer thought he was making a lovable character, which audience's would find her mindless banter appealing and adorable...this was not the case. Instead, her shallow conversations usually between herself could have been filled with a better story line or other cinematic ventures.

I would sincerely not recommend this movie to anyone who even wants to see a shallow, expedient romantic comedy. Spend your money and most importantly, TIME on other ones...Kal Ho Naa Ho, Chup Ke Chup Ke (I really Liked Kareena in this movie, I'm not a Kareena hater), Kuch Naa Kaho...those are very good cute films that at least leave you feeling satisfied, which this movie in my case, did not leave me feeling.",1225238400,4,1301,4.599137931034483
3060599,5,B001165BG0,"""Jab We Met"" was a delightful bollywood, heartfelt and entertaining.  As a viewer only recently discovering the joys of bollywood films, I am learning the differences each film has to offer.  In this film, as with most, music plays a key role; however, in ""Jab We Met"" the music is more of a background player, with less choreographed dance numbers.  This allows the acting, story line, and especially the character development to shine through.
Kareena Kapoor does a fabulous job as Geet, an outspoken, independent, and spontaneous girl.  The journey her character takes, and the breadth of her acting through was the highlight of the film in my eyes.
This film is a shining example of what a romantic comedy should be, and demonstrates what American Rom-Coms are lacking.",1215993600,4,773,4.9689922480620154
3060600,5,B001165BG0,"JAB WE MET became one of the biggest hits in Bollywood cinema in 2007, and it's quite easy to see why. This is a very watchable romantic comedy and the two leads, Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor, dazzle in this, their best acting performances yet. After having seen this one just now, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dilwale-Dulhania-Le-Jayenge-2DISC-SET/dp/B000Z9PWKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (2DISC SET)</a>&nbsp;recently, I am this close to buying a train ticket to wherever. There've been other cinematic romances on the rails, yeah, but surely they couldn't have been more fun than the time spent on and off the tracks by Aditya and Geet in JAB WE MET.

Aditya (Shahid Kapoor) hasn't had a good time of it of late. His father had passed away a year ago, leaving him the reins to his corporate empire. But now business is on the skids. Too, the girl he loves has just gotten married. Despondent beyond belief, Aditya just simply wanders away. He somehow ends up on a train, and this is where he runs into Geet (Kareena Kapoor), who will change his life. Geet is a cute Punjabi girl who just will not stop talking. She exudes this vitality and exuberance which at first grates on Aditya's nerves; he actually implores her to leave him alone. But she keeps talking.

So it sucks for Aditya that, when he dispiritedly disembarks from the train, the girl follows him (to tell him the train is leaving) and is herself stranded. Aditya is left with no choice but to do the right thing, which is to escort Geet to her Punjabi home, from where, she cheerfully tells him, she plans to promptly run away and elope with her boyfriend (some guy named Anshuman). Aditya's irritation at Geet gradually turns to affection and then to something more. But, after a travelogue of adventures with her, he finds himself parting ways near Anshuman's doorstep as she goes to meet her lover. And yet the plans of mice and men and Geets don't always pan out. Because, nine months later...

JAB WE MET is a marvelous feel good movie, although you can't tell it by the opening scenes, which are depressing (the world falls apart for Aditya) but will intrigue you enough that you'll keep tuned in. Things perk up once Geet makes her appearance, and then get even better as Kareena and Shahid meet and instantly spark up the screen. JAB WE MET is the fourth teaming of these two (after&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fida-2004/dp/B000EQ5URI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fida (2004)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chup-Chup-ke/dp/B000HX87NC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chup Chup ke</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/36-China-Town/dp/B000G1KSXW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">36 China Town</a>, with 2008's MILENGE MILENGE being the fifth), and they've obviously managed to perfect that chemistry thing. There might be something to be said for these two having dated for several years in the past in real life (although they've since broken up).

In fact, this is the best I've seen of Shahid and of Kareena, whether together or in separate films. It's weird, because Aditya and Geet do end up in some pretty off-the-wall scenarios, but, although you know there are plenty of manipulative moments here, they never feel that contrived. The film unfolds in a graceful, natural way. All credit again to Shahid and Kareena (and, I guess, to the writing and directing). Shahid's Aditya, suffering from heartbreak and from pressures at the job. Kareena's Geet, feisty, carefree, and a constant chatterbox. Both actors put in beautiful, nuanced performances, never quite going over the top, to that point where credibility is lost. Kareena goes away from her vacuous ""beauty princess"" roles, and this is a good thing. Geet is so vibrant for most of the picture that it's a semi-shock to see her metamorphose into a sad, dejected girl in the film's second half. Your heart will go out to her. Kareena, for this role, won for Best Actress in various 2007 Bollywood award shows. She's so engaging in this picture that even her character's mile-a-minute prattle never gets annoying.

Meanwhile, Shahid has the tougher role. His part calls for a lack of showboating. Note that he doesn't scream or yell out or overdramatize his anguish to the world. Shahid is so good here, in the little things that he does - whether it's a look or a certain posture or maybe a quiet delivery of a line - that his pain is clearly conveyed. He makes a perfect foil for Kareena's flighty, optimistic character. Like Kareena, he's never been better.

JAB WE MET is set against a backdrop of eye-catching landscapes (from Mumbai to Bhatinda to Manali), and, this picturesque flavor enhances the film, trust me. The musical interludes are lively and colorful and catchy (especially the very upbeat ""Mauja Hi Mauja"" and ""Nagada Nagada Nagada Baja""). JAB WE MET is a warmhearted romantic romp. And it's funny. Some of the film's plot complications involve the usual screwball suspects: misunderstandings, mistaken identities, false pretenses... But it's all executed with such charm and good timing. JAB WE MET deserves to be seen, and seen by a lot of people. So, if you haven't yet, do give this one a try. Much as Geet did for Aditya, let Kareena and Shahid put color in your drab world.

I am serious about getting that train ticket...",1207699200,21,5486,5.277205040091638
3060601,5,B001165BG0,"Well she didn't miss the train this time. Jab We Met fell into my lap from Amazon ad and I proceeded to read online reviews which had something to the effect of:
- boy meets girl
- boy helps ""damsel in distress""
- boy takes girl home
- family mistakes him for her finance
- boy and girl try to prove them wrong
- finally boy and girl realize they are in love and the rest as they say ""is history""

If you're familiar with Bollywood productions, I bet you can name quite a few movies with the same premise of which Dhaai Akshar Prem Ke is one.  Maybe then you can relate with my initial cynicism about Jab We Met. But I got to see the movie, and I was smitten then I got hooked and the rest again ""is history"".

Okay so I'll try to move into the movie review.  Well ""Jab We Met"" does have the above mentioned plot to it and seriously there's nothing original or suspenseful about it.  You know where the story is going 15mins into the movie, but what keeps you glued to your seat really is how we get to the ""last train stop"". And yes, metaphorically, catching trains is the theme of this movie; a shade of meaning for not missing out on love.

Here it is: Aditya Kashyap (Shahid Kapoor) is a very rich young man who has just inherited his father's shares in a large Indian corporation. A number of things missing in his life (can't say coz u won't have fun watching the movie) cause him to walk out on a very important boardroom meeting. He mindlessly roams the streets and eventually gets on a train. In comes Miss Motormouth aka Geet (Kareena Kapoor).  She just can't seem to shut up. She even talks about shoe-shopping in her sleep! One thing leads to the other and Aditya gets stuck with Geet and he has to take her home. Then they go their separate ways, but somehow it seems they'd never stop meeting by chance, and then the climax. Unfortunately this is where I ""shut-up"" so you can have fun watching this movie.

Cons:
- Nothing new about the plot
- Nothing monumental about the script

Pros:

- Believable chemistry between Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor (one of the movie's biggest driving machine)
- This is my first view of Shahid Kapoor and I must say he's quite talented.  His interpretation of this guy is very mature especially in the nuances. For instance the first time Geet misses her train and she chose to shift the blame, you can't help but feel sorry for the perpetrator instead of the victim (according to Geet's judgement book). Kareena is yelling at the top of her lungs and this guy's response wasn't in kind. In fact, he was so calm that I went ""This man is going places if he chooses to remain an actor"". And I must confess I usually skip through opening credits in a movie, but Shahid is quite engaging as a man in despair as he walks the streets of Mumbai that I just couldn't get myself to skip the opening.

- Hum...almost forgot the songs. Yes the songs! I thought they were good. My favorite is Nagada. If your ears are tuned to heavy percussion instruments in music then I bet you'll like it too. Besides the choreography isn't too bad. Plus the dancers are not stiff especially Shahid. He dances well enough that one can safely say ""Watch out Hrithik Roshan, looks like you have a competition in Shahid""

- Finally, if you are reading this review then I know you most likely have some interest in Bollywood, so check out this movie. This movie in one word is CUTE. If you like cute, then I bet you'll like this movie too. If not just check it out anyway; no harm done.",1206662400,16,3507,4.327743902439025

3060611,4,B001165BG0,"I have been on a 'discovering India' journey for the past one and a half years; since coming across an India soap (Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Dom) on youtube, quite by accident. Ordering this movie was part of the journey.

In this movie, the two lead characters meet on a train from Mumbai to Dehli and after getting out of the train on a station along the way, they continue the journey by several means of transport. While the plot didn't particularly excited me, I loved the journey itself, through Rajasthan and Punjabi and later Manali and Shimla. We get a glimpse of the various landscapes, the diverse clothing styles and the different climatic zones. I had never seen many of those regions, on an Indian movie before; and while it should not come as a surprise, as Manali is not far from China, the clothes and faces, immediately made me think of Nepal.

For the journey alone, I would recommend this movie. The love story, is sweet, but easily forgotten.",1462406400,3,959,4.569767441860465

3060638,5,B001165BG0,"Okay so I have a love for Bollywood but hey I see I'm not alone. (Thank you world) so I came across this movie a while back and I didn't know what to think of it at first yeah she missed the train yeah it may, may not have been his fault. But I kept watching it, Andi found it funny and I just loved it more both leads are good in my book seen them together in a fee other movies. Love how they are together.
It started to make me want to ""miss my train"" now yes she's high energy and funny and just that person  we all know. Loud kind funny makes us all watch her. And him low energy always looking like if I could pitch her off this train.
Then the journey they go on, I'm sorry once again I'll say this I WANT AN ADVENTURE NEXT. It does have the singing and dancing that makes us all kind of want to get up and try.  it does ask a question thought. ""If your on a journey for yourself and to get away from everything and something changes and you don't see it coming. Do you still go forward or do you try something you never saw coming. If when you get there and it breaks your heart do you turn around and find your happiness again or keep going the road your on?"" He wanted to get away from what happened to him she was looking forward to meeting someone. They met they had an adventure together. But at the end for them both after it was over two things happened. One for each of them. (Not just love but two other things. Pay attention to understand)
it is loveable and funny.
I have seen this six times and I'm glad i found it on here.
Now don't judge just cause I don't have the dvd. Like I said I've seen it already. But if you want a good movie to pass time and grow to love get it. You will love it.",1453939200,,1711,3.8997134670487106
3060639,5,B001165BG0,"This is one of my favorite Bollywood movies, with really good acting, great songs that truly fit the plot and move the story line along rather than jarringly inserted. As with many romance Bollywood movies, there are some very wild premises that the story is built on---here, Geet, the heroine, is a meddling charmer who is always 'almost' missing her trains, usually due to her huge amounts of luggage, presents for her family, and pictures, plants and other items she simply cannot travel without.  She meets a dejected Aditya, who is the heir to a huge company, but his girlfriend has just married someone else, his dad has died and no one in the company thinks he has the mettle to run it, there are all sorts of failed projects and the stock is at an all-time low. Geet decides to help Aditya and in the process of distracting him from committing suicide (of which she is completely unaware), she gets off the train to find her latest 'project' and misses her train.  A 'roadtrip' sort of adventure ensues, complete with an indifferent boyfriend Geet is running away to marry(to escape her family's proposed suitor), lots of fun songs and great Bollywood dancing, and Aditya turning his company around, and discovering he is falling in love with Geet.

All the characters are well-developed, rather than the cardboard cut-outs common in so many films today, regardless of which country they get made in.  Sahid Kapoor (Aditya) is one of Bollywood's most highly regarded dancers, not to mention a finely nuanced actor. Kareena Kapoor (Geet) is a beauty and completely believable as an irrepressible free spirit who longs for love and romance in her fantasy world.

If you don't speak Hindi or Urdu or whatever languages the Bollywood movies are filmed in, a caveat:  'subtitles' is a very loose term.  Jab We Met is better than some I've seen, but figure every 10th sentence is translated. Add to this the common lapsing into 'Hindish', a mix of English and Hindi slang. I had to watch this movie 3 times before I understood all the plot.  It wasn't a hard task watching such delightful froth, but others I've seen are soooo frustrating because of the scarcity of English subtitles.

This is a great intro to the delights of Bollywood, and I highly recommend it.

Jab is kind of a take on Sense and Sensibility--a very loose take--but delightfully entertaining at every scene.",1453161600,,2380,4.797066014669927

I don't like to keep a lot of material possessions that add up to be a major headache when it comes time to move (like books and movies) but there is a permanent spot on my keeper shelf for this film. Every time I watch it I'm left with such a great feeling. It gives me all the feel-good movie tingles and the love story between Aditya and Geet makes my romantic heart sigh every time.

This review may make this movie seem like a soppy romance, but I promise it's not. That's why I love it so much. There is plenty of adventure (and misadventure) to go around. Every time I watch this movie I get sucked in. Kareena Kapoor absolutely shines in her role as the irrepressible, chatty Geet. Her chemistry with Shahid Kapoor's character, Aditya, is undeniable. I loved watching these two get each other into and out of trouble. The setting in Punjab was so colorful and detailed. This is definitely a family film as well.

The songs and dances in this movie were great. I love them all, but my favorites are definitely Nagada Nagada and Yeh Ishq Hai. However, beware: Mauja Hi Mauja may get stuck in your head for a day or two.

I recommend this to anyone looking for a fun, pick-me-up film or who can't resist a romance. You will love this one :)",1409270400,2,1295,4.320987654320987

By bad I mean it one of those disc that doesn't allow you to scan backward or forward to replay a section. It only allows you to skip chapters. It is one of those disc that force you to sit through all the front matter before getting to the main menu. Sadly, it is also one of those disc with BAD sound quality; scratchy and distant at times giving it a bootleg quality.

She talks too much and he can't get a word in.  Kareena's role early in the film is like watching old Lucille Ball skits - she has great comic timing.  Shahid is really an excellent dancer and his music scenes are more convincing than most Bollywood offerings.

3060740,5,B001165BG0,"I was searching for a Bollywood movie one night and Jab We Met was a recommendation I decided to take a chance on- and boy am I glad I did.  I have watched it so many times now that I have parts of the dialog memorized (In Hindi even) and I have made some of my non-Bollywood watching friends and family watch and they also have enjoyed it.  This is also the movie that changed my feelings for Kareena Kapoor.  Prior to Jab We Met I was not a fan and only tolerated her, but as Geet she won me over.  And Shahid Kapoor was so wonderful as Aditya that I immediatly watched the rest of his movies.

Jab We Met starts off with Aditya's (Shahid Kapoor) life crumbling around him.  We watch him walk through the city slowly leaving his life behind him.  He cluelessly boards a train and soon meets Geet (Kareena Kapoor).  Geet is so joyful she literally can not keep it too herself.  She talks endlessly- even in her sleep!  Aditya gets off the train only to be joined by Geet warning him that the train is leaving.  They are both left on the platform and from there the adventure truly begins with Geet informing Aditya that he must accompany her to her home.

Of course you know what is going to happen.  We have all seen variations on this movie but getting there is so enjoyable that I didn't mind.  Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor have such wonderful chemistry and both do such a marvelous job with their character.  The music is great, as soon as the movie was over I was downloading Mauja Hi Mauja and Nagada Nagada. I highly recommend this, especially if you feel down.

Aditya (Sahid Kappor) is at a crisis point in his life, the woman he loves has just married another and he only wants to escape with his own thoughts. Enter Geet (Kareena Kapoor), a chatterbox who is as naive as she is well intentioned. When their paths cross on a train she wants to talk and he wants silence. Persistent, she is determined to get him to open up and when she finds he has left the train she follows him. What follows is a series of misadventures centered around a girl who just can't seem to stay out of trouble and man who feels obliged to look out for her. By the time they finally reach their destination, his annoyance has turned to fondness, but wait, this is Bollywood! She is determined to elope with her love (we've not yet met him) and pulls Aditya into her crazy plot sending them off across the country on another journey. He sees her, he thinks, safely into the arms of her love before returning to his life as a changed man. When he learns that she is missing and no one has heard from her, he sets out to find her and it is now he who is needed to cheer.

3060757,5,B001165BG0,"Very enjoyable movie, with great natural acting/story.  The theme music is beautiful (really) and used well at several story points.

Unfortunately the expensive Blu-ray disc has no bonus material (just the movie).
The DVD main ""menu"" concept/look is better than the Blu-ray main menu (but that is a nit-pick).

I own both Blu-ray and the best version of the DVD (Dec 2007 release, anamorphic, highest bit-rate, front cover has them back-to-back and she is wearing a red dress), so I was able to compare them.  Both the DVD and Blu-ray have an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 (1920x1080) with Blu-ray at 24p.

The DVD has a good picture quality (but the factory burn method or disc blank is not the best), so the Blu-ray is only a slight improvement in sharpness/detail.
The color seems slightly better (more realistic) on the Blu-ray disc.  The optional subtitles are 95% the same between the DVD and the Blu-ray, but there are small differences (go figure).

When FAST FORWARDING (or freeze frame) the Blu-ray has a significantly improved picture quality (no jaggies) compared to those type actions with the DVD.

The Blu-ray audio is DTS capable, while the DVD audio is only Dolby Digital capable.

If you can afford the Blu-ray and don't already have the DVD (which is pretty good quality for a DVD), then I think it is reasonable to buy the
Blu-ray for the slight improvements (just really bummed there are NO BONUS items at all, since this movie SCREAMS for the fun/interesting extras they could have included).",1281139200,,1508,4.859375

3060761,5,B001165BG0,"JAB WE MET (HOW WE MET, I believe) is a totally endearing, sprightly screwball Bollywood comedy romance which may remind you of BRINGING UP BABY, with Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn or WHAT'S UP, DOC, with Ryan O'Neil and Barbra Streisand. In all three of these movies, the slightly (or very) nutty girl tries to get the guy by doing anything that comes into her adorable head. The only difference in this Bollywood film is that the girl seems unaware of the reasons for her behavior, at least we can look at it this way. The important thing is that Aditya (ably played by appealing male lead Shahid Kapoor) and Geet (excellently played by the exquisite Kareen Kapoor) have met, and that, one way or another, they do finally marry. They make a great couple; she's full of manic energy and life, and he's a melancholy millionaire who needs her influence so he can come back to life. The entire movie is a flashback relating to their children how they met.

  The stars apparently have not been married, though they were dating for a few years before this movie, after which they seperated! That's almost the opposite of this movie's plot.  Kareen Kapoor won Filfare's Best Actress Award for '07 for her energetic and fine-tuned performance as the nutty girl who gets the level-headed guy and inspires him to take back his life and then to excel. She is also the main influence in this excellent movie which makes it excel.

The good: The acting by Shahid Kapur and Kareena Kapoor and just about every one else in the film. The sets and locations. The dance sequences. Shahid is an excellent dancer.

The not so good: there is nothing original about the story. You do not get a real sense of how or why Aditya falls for Geet. Kareena is a weak dancer.

These two characters are attractive and fun to watch.

The story a bit drawn out, mistaken identities and a not very believable love story included, and a few cheesy effects that made me laugh (model trains and autos -- perhaps they were placed tongue in cheek? it didn't strike me as a low budget flick to me) but it retained it's charm.

It's a cute film, light, with an obligatory dance sequence.  But not nearly on the same level of a ""Bride and Prejudice"".  If you approach this film with an open heart and no expectations, you'll be sure to enjoy the ride.

3060776,5,B001165BG0,"Outstanding performances and a splendid story make Jab We Met one of the best romantic comedies in years. Deeply depressed Aditya (played by Shahid Kapoor) meets vivacious Geet (Kareena Kapoor) on a train. He finds her annoying at first--and audiences will likely, too--but a series of mishaps brought on by Geet force them to travel together. Geet's infectious joie de vivre eventually inspires Aditya to embrace life with the same enthusiasm and optimism, and he finds himself falling for her, even though her heart belongs to another. When Geet is rejected by the man she wants to marry and her spirit is crushed, Aditya must do for her what she did for him--and he sacrifices his own happiness for hers, the truest measure of love. The two actors, who were romantically involved in real life during the making of the film, are perfect compliments to one another. Their amusing interplay and magnetic attraction are a pleasure to watch, and their misadventures, particularly the ones involving her boisterous family, are quite funny. This heartwarming tale about the meaning of life and the power of love can't be missed. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bollywood-Ticket/dp/B002Q0WPWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bollywood Ticket</a>)",1254009600,,1359,5.699507389162561

It's difficult for us to stay in our chairs during Nagada Nagada and you know what? We don't.

The screen play is clever and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny both in what is said and what is seen. Directing and acting combine to produce many delightful scenes. You must be able to keep up completely with the subtitles, the expressions on the actor's faces and the flow of the story to fully appreciate the high quality of this film.  There are no cheesy moments and no unnecessary scenes. There are no thunderclaps or lighting bolts to provide emphasis. There is no slap-stick, there is no silliness and there are no negatives.

Most of the film's appeal for me came from Kareena Kapoor's energetic portrayal of the scatterbrained but plucky and utterly charming Geet.

Movies like this aren't made in America anymore, and I'm sorry we've become too sophisticated for our own good. Scenes that are natural and sweet in ""Jab We Met"" could only be played with irony here, and that's too bad.

I remember when ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Tiger"" was such a hit here in the U.S. It was as if no one in American filmmaking had ever thought of showing, without explanation or apology, warriors who could leap to the treetops, as if such a thing were naturally within human power and capable of being filmed in real time. Some scenes in ""Jab We Met"" will strike some Americans as corny, and that is too bad. I loved it.

I haven't seen many Bollywood films, but the ones I've seen have all touched my heart *and* entertained me. There haven't been many U.S. films made in the last 30 years that have such unabashed romantic appeal for me.",1238889600,2,1112,4.57286432160804
3060780,4,B001165BG0,"""Jab We Met"" is a likable romantic comedy that stars Shahid Kapur and Kareena Kapoor as a pair of opposites brought together by a quirk of fate. Aditya [Shahid Kapur] is a young industrialist who is facing failure whilst at the helm of a company inherited from his father. To add insult to injury, he has also been jilted by his ex-girlfriend for another man. Feeling desperate and disillusioned, he abandons everything and boards a train at random. On the train, he meets a hyper-talkative young lass, Geet [Kareena Kapoor] who won't stop jabbering, annoying him immensely. The pair find themselves being thrown together despite Aditya's best efforts to shake Geet off, and he finds himself acting as Geet's escort as she finds her way home to Punjab. Along the way, both learn more about one another, Aditya finding Geet's optimistic and 'facing problems head on' attitude refreshing. Ironically, Geet later finds herself being consoled by Aditya as she faces her own personal crisis. The story is basically about two opposite souls who find that they actually share incredible chemistry with one another and bring out the best in each other.

The acting in this production was top-notch, especially by the two leads. In fact, I have watched Kareena in many other Bollywood movies and would rank this as one of her best performances. Initially, her performance in this movie comes across as annoying, with her incessant and inconsequential chit-chat, but over time, her  character is credibly developed to portray an emotionally vulnerable character that elicits one's sympathy. Shahid Kapur is also credible in his performance as the emotionally tormented soul who eventually learns to let go of his pain and make his peace with his past.

The songs were not really catchy or memorable, but the storyline and acting kept this movie fresh and interesting.",1238112000,,1857,5.062091503267974

There've been other cinematic romances on the rails, yeah, but surely they couldn't have been more fun than the time spent on and off the tracks by Aditya and Geet in JAB WE MET.

Aditya (Shahid Kapoor) hasn't had a good time of it of late. His father had passed away a year ago, leaving him the reins to his corporate empire. But now business is on the skids. Too, the girl he loves has just gotten married. Despondent beyond belief, Aditya just simply wanders away. He somehow ends up on a train, and this is where he runs into Geet (Kareena Kapoor), who will change his life. Geet is a cute Punjabi girl who just will not stop talking. She exudes this vitality and exuberance which at first grates on Aditya's nerves; he actually implores her to leave him alone. But she keeps talking.

So it sucks for Aditya that, when he dispiritedly disembarks from the train, the girl follows him (to tell him the train is leaving) and is herself stranded. Aditya is left with no choice but to do the right thing, which is to escort Geet to her Punjabi home, from where, she cheerfully tells him, she plans to promptly run away and elope with her boyfriend (some guy named Anshuman). Aditya's irritation at Geet gradually turns to affection and then to something more. But, after a travelogue of adventures with her, he finds himself parting ways near Anshuman's doorstep as she goes to meet her lover. And yet the plans of mice and men and Geets don't always pan out. Because, nine months later...

JAB WE MET is a marvelous feel good movie, although you can't tell it by the opening scenes, which are depressing (the world falls apart for Aditya) but will intrigue you enough that you'll keep tuned in. Things perk up once Geet makes her appearance, and then get even better as Kareena and Shahid meet and instantly spark up the screen. JAB WE MET is the fourth teaming of these two (after&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fida-2004/dp/B000EQ5URI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fida (2004)</a>, CHUP CHUP KE, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/36-China-Town/dp/B000I0RVQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">36 China Town</a>, with 2008's MILENGE MILENGE being the fifth), and they've obviously managed to perfect that chemistry thing. There might be something to be said for these two having dated for several years in the past in real life (although they've since broken up).

In fact, this is the best I've seen of Shahid and of Kareena, whether together or in separate films. It's weird, because Aditya and Geet do end up in some pretty off-the-wall scenarios, but, although you know there are plenty of manipulative moments here, they never feel that contrived. The film unfolds in a graceful, natural way. All credit again to Shahid and Kareena (and, I guess, to the writing and directing). Shahid's Aditya, suffering from heartbreak and from pressures at the job. Kareena's Geet, feisty, carefree, and a constant chatterbox. Both actors put in beautiful, nuanced performances, never quite going over the top, to that point where credibility is lost. Kareena goes away from her vacuous ""beauty princess"" roles, and this is a good thing. Geet is so vibrant for most of the picture that it's a semi-shock to see her metamorphose into a sad, dejected girl in the film's second half. Your heart will go out to her. Kareena, for this role, won for Best Actress in various 2007 Bollywood award shows. She's so engaging in this picture that even her character's mile-a-minute prattle never gets annoying.

Meanwhile, Shahid has the tougher role. His part calls for a lack of showboating. Note that he doesn't scream or yell out or overdramatize his anguish to the world. Shahid is so good here, in the little things that he does - whether it's a look or a certain posture or maybe a quiet delivery of a line - that his pain is clearly conveyed. He makes a perfect foil for Kareena's flighty, optimistic character. Like Kareena, he's never been better.

JAB WE MET is set against a backdrop of eye-catching landscapes (from Mumbai to Bhatinda to Manali), and, this picturesque flavor enhances the film, trust me. The musical interludes are lively and colorful and catchy (especially the very upbeat ""Mauja Hi Mauja"" and ""Nagada Nagada Nagada Baja""). JAB WE MET is a warmhearted romantic romp. And it's funny. Some of the film's plot complications involve the usual screwball suspects: misunderstandings, mistaken identities, false pretenses... But it's all executed with such charm and good timing. JAB WE MET deserves to be seen, and seen by a lot of people. So, if you haven't yet, do give this one a try. Much as Geet did for Aditya, let Kareena and Shahid put color in your drab world.

3295094,5,B001165BG0,"I almost let this one go as the description talked of a girl jabbering on and on and him having to rescue her. This sounded potentially irritating. As it had got good star ratings I decided to try it.
For its genre it was actually quite satisfying. The girl only blabbers early on in the movie when the boy and girl meet on a train and it then goes on to look at the effects of the encounter of these two opposite personalities on each other. For him it literally saves his life and turns his life round. She in turn finds more balance and ends up bubbly rather than blubbery.
As so many Indian movies this started off with the superficial and then ended up somewhere else with a warmer deeper look into the protagonists.
I wasn't familiar with Shahid Kapoor the leading man. He looks like Clark Kent (as played by Dean Cain) and is very watchable. He doesnt dance much which is a pity as his background is in dance and he is very watchable. The girl Kareena Kapoor (no relation) is good too and is doing a natural bubbly.
One of those movies that is lightweight but an enjoyable spending of time with some nice people learning about life. While compared to other deeper movies I have seen it may not be 5 stars. I found its music OK but no catchy tune to take away with me. It is lightweight but for its genre it was a pleasant experience and perhaps star ratings are about a genre and to draw others attention to specific buys.",1225497600,,1429,4.296296296296297

I was imagining this film would be pleasantly light, simplistically beautiful, and a rare new find in the sea of predictable hindi films...

If you are a fan but want a movie to sweep you off of your feet, Jab We Met is not the movie! I was so dissappointed. My expectations were not high at all. The only thing that sticks out in my brain from this movie is Kareena Kapoor's excessive TALKING! She does not keep her mouth shut for the first 30 minutes of the film. Now I'm sure the writer thought he was making a lovable character, which audience's would find her mindless banter appealing and adorable...this was not the case. Instead, her shallow conversations usually between herself could have been filled with a better story line or other cinematic ventures.

I would sincerely not recommend this movie to anyone who even wants to see a shallow, expedient romantic comedy. Spend your money and most importantly, TIME on other ones...Kal Ho Naa Ho, Chup Ke Chup Ke (I really Liked Kareena in this movie, I'm not a Kareena hater), Kuch Naa Kaho...those are very good cute films that at least leave you feeling satisfied, which this movie in my case, did not leave me feeling.",1225238400,4,1301,4.599137931034483
3295096,5,B001165BG0,"""Jab We Met"" was a delightful bollywood, heartfelt and entertaining.  As a viewer only recently discovering the joys of bollywood films, I am learning the differences each film has to offer.  In this film, as with most, music plays a key role; however, in ""Jab We Met"" the music is more of a background player, with less choreographed dance numbers.  This allows the acting, story line, and especially the character development to shine through.
Kareena Kapoor does a fabulous job as Geet, an outspoken, independent, and spontaneous girl.  The journey her character takes, and the breadth of her acting through was the highlight of the film in my eyes.
This film is a shining example of what a romantic comedy should be, and demonstrates what American Rom-Coms are lacking.",1215993600,4,773,4.9689922480620154

3295098,5,B001165BG0,"Well she didn't miss the train this time. Jab We Met fell into my lap from Amazon ad and I proceeded to read online reviews which had something to the effect of:
- boy meets girl
- boy helps ""damsel in distress""
- boy takes girl home
- family mistakes him for her finance
- boy and girl try to prove them wrong
- finally boy and girl realize they are in love and the rest as they say ""is history""

If you're familiar with Bollywood productions, I bet you can name quite a few movies with the same premise of which Dhaai Akshar Prem Ke is one.  Maybe then you can relate with my initial cynicism about Jab We Met. But I got to see the movie, and I was smitten then I got hooked and the rest again ""is history"".

Okay so I'll try to move into the movie review.  Well ""Jab We Met"" does have the above mentioned plot to it and seriously there's nothing original or suspenseful about it.  You know where the story is going 15mins into the movie, but what keeps you glued to your seat really is how we get to the ""last train stop"". And yes, metaphorically, catching trains is the theme of this movie; a shade of meaning for not missing out on love.

Here it is: Aditya Kashyap (Shahid Kapoor) is a very rich young man who has just inherited his father's shares in a large Indian corporation. A number of things missing in his life (can't say coz u won't have fun watching the movie) cause him to walk out on a very important boardroom meeting. He mindlessly roams the streets and eventually gets on a train. In comes Miss Motormouth aka Geet (Kareena Kapoor).  She just can't seem to shut up. She even talks about shoe-shopping in her sleep! One thing leads to the other and Aditya gets stuck with Geet and he has to take her home. Then they go their separate ways, but somehow it seems they'd never stop meeting by chance, and then the climax. Unfortunately this is where I ""shut-up"" so you can have fun watching this movie.

Cons:
- Nothing new about the plot
- Nothing monumental about the script

Pros:

- Believable chemistry between Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor (one of the movie's biggest driving machine)
- This is my first view of Shahid Kapoor and I must say he's quite talented.  His interpretation of this guy is very mature especially in the nuances. For instance the first time Geet misses her train and she chose to shift the blame, you can't help but feel sorry for the perpetrator instead of the victim (according to Geet's judgement book). Kareena is yelling at the top of her lungs and this guy's response wasn't in kind. In fact, he was so calm that I went ""This man is going places if he chooses to remain an actor"". And I must confess I usually skip through opening credits in a movie, but Shahid is quite engaging as a man in despair as he walks the streets of Mumbai that I just couldn't get myself to skip the opening.

- Hum...almost forgot the songs. Yes the songs! I thought they were good. My favorite is Nagada. If your ears are tuned to heavy percussion instruments in music then I bet you'll like it too. Besides the choreography isn't too bad. Plus the dancers are not stiff especially Shahid. He dances well enough that one can safely say ""Watch out Hrithik Roshan, looks like you have a competition in Shahid""

- Finally, if you are reading this review then I know you most likely have some interest in Bollywood, so check out this movie. This movie in one word is CUTE. If you like cute, then I bet you'll like this movie too. If not just check it out anyway; no harm done.",1206662400,16,3507,4.327743902439025

In this movie, the two lead characters meet on a train from Mumbai to Dehli and after getting out of the train on a station along the way, they continue the journey by several means of transport. While the plot didn't particularly excited me, I loved the journey itself, through Rajasthan and Punjabi and later Manali and Shimla. We get a glimpse of the various landscapes, the diverse clothing styles and the different climatic zones. I had never seen many of those regions, on an Indian movie before; and while it should not come as a surprise, as Manali is not far from China, the clothes and faces, immediately made me think of Nepal.

But I kept watching it, Andi found it funny and I just loved it more both leads are good in my book seen them together in a fee other movies. Love how they are together.
It started to make me want to ""miss my train"" now yes she's high energy and funny and just that person  we all know. Loud kind funny makes us all watch her. And him low energy always looking like if I could pitch her off this train.
Then the journey they go on, I'm sorry once again I'll say this I WANT AN ADVENTURE NEXT. It does have the singing and dancing that makes us all kind of want to get up and try.  it does ask a question thought. ""If your on a journey for yourself and to get away from everything and something changes and you don't see it coming. Do you still go forward or do you try something you never saw coming. If when you get there and it breaks your heart do you turn around and find your happiness again or keep going the road your on?""

But at the end for them both after it was over two things happened. One for each of them. (Not just love but two other things. Pay attention to understand)
it is loveable and funny.
I have seen this six times and I'm glad i found it on here.

3295136,5,B001165BG0,"This is one of my favorite Bollywood movies, with really good acting, great songs that truly fit the plot and move the story line along rather than jarringly inserted. As with many romance Bollywood movies, there are some very wild premises that the story is built on---here, Geet, the heroine, is a meddling charmer who is always 'almost' missing her trains, usually due to her huge amounts of luggage, presents for her family, and pictures, plants and other items she simply cannot travel without.  She meets a dejected Aditya, who is the heir to a huge company, but his girlfriend has just married someone else, his dad has died and no one in the company thinks he has the mettle to run it, there are all sorts of failed projects and the stock is at an all-time low. Geet decides to help Aditya and in the process of distracting him from committing suicide (of which she is completely unaware), she gets off the train to find her latest 'project' and misses her train.  A 'roadtrip' sort of adventure ensues, complete with an indifferent boyfriend Geet is running away to marry(to escape her family's proposed suitor), lots of fun songs and great Bollywood dancing, and Aditya turning his company around, and discovering he is falling in love with Geet.

All the characters are well-developed, rather than the cardboard cut-outs common in so many films today, regardless of which country they get made in.  Sahid Kapoor (Aditya) is one of Bollywood's most highly regarded dancers, not to mention a finely nuanced actor. Kareena Kapoor (Geet) is a beauty and completely believable as an irrepressible free spirit who longs for love and romance in her fantasy world.

If you don't speak Hindi or Urdu or whatever languages the Bollywood movies are filmed in, a caveat:  'subtitles' is a very loose term.  Jab We Met is better than some I've seen, but figure every 10th sentence is translated. Add to this the common lapsing into 'Hindish', a mix of English and Hindi slang. I had to watch this movie 3 times before I understood all the plot.  It wasn't a hard task watching such delightful froth, but others I've seen are soooo frustrating because of the scarcity of English subtitles.

This is a great intro to the delights of Bollywood, and I highly recommend it.

I don't like to keep a lot of material possessions that add up to be a major headache when it comes time to move (like books and movies) but there is a permanent spot on my keeper shelf for this film. Every time I watch it I'm left with such a great feeling. It gives me all the feel-good movie tingles and the love story between Aditya and Geet makes my romantic heart sigh every time.

This review may make this movie seem like a soppy romance, but I promise it's not. That's why I love it so much. There is plenty of adventure (and misadventure) to go around. Every time I watch this movie I get sucked in. Kareena Kapoor absolutely shines in her role as the irrepressible, chatty Geet. Her chemistry with Shahid Kapoor's character, Aditya, is undeniable. I loved watching these two get each other into and out of trouble. The setting in Punjab was so colorful and detailed. This is definitely a family film as well.

The songs and dances in this movie were great. I love them all, but my favorites are definitely Nagada Nagada and Yeh Ishq Hai. However, beware: Mauja Hi Mauja may get stuck in your head for a day or two.

I recommend this to anyone looking for a fun, pick-me-up film or who can't resist a romance. You will love this one :)",1409270400,2,1295,4.320987654320987

She talks too much and he can't get a word in.  Kareena's role early in the film is like watching old Lucille Ball skits - she has great comic timing.  Shahid is really an excellent dancer and his music scenes are more convincing than most Bollywood offerings.
The scenery in this film is breathtaking, with lots of views of the countryside and mountains rather than the crowded cities.  Places mentioned are Manali, Bhatinda, and Shimla.

3295237,5,B001165BG0,"I was searching for a Bollywood movie one night and Jab We Met was a recommendation I decided to take a chance on- and boy am I glad I did.  I have watched it so many times now that I have parts of the dialog memorized (In Hindi even) and I have made some of my non-Bollywood watching friends and family watch and they also have enjoyed it.  This is also the movie that changed my feelings for Kareena Kapoor.  Prior to Jab We Met I was not a fan and only tolerated her, but as Geet she won me over.  And Shahid Kapoor was so wonderful as Aditya that I immediatly watched the rest of his movies.

Jab We Met starts off with Aditya's (Shahid Kapoor) life crumbling around him.  We watch him walk through the city slowly leaving his life behind him.  He cluelessly boards a train and soon meets Geet (Kareena Kapoor).  Geet is so joyful she literally can not keep it too herself.  She talks endlessly- even in her sleep!  Aditya gets off the train only to be joined by Geet warning him that the train is leaving.  They are both left on the platform and from there the adventure truly begins with Geet informing Aditya that he must accompany her to her home.

Of course you know what is going to happen.  We have all seen variations on this movie but getting there is so enjoyable that I didn't mind.  Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor have such wonderful chemistry and both do such a marvelous job with their character.  The music is great, as soon as the movie was over I was downloading Mauja Hi Mauja and Nagada Nagada. I highly recommend this, especially if you feel down.

Aditya (Sahid Kappor) is at a crisis point in his life, the woman he loves has just married another and he only wants to escape with his own thoughts. Enter Geet (Kareena Kapoor), a chatterbox who is as naive as she is well intentioned. When their paths cross on a train she wants to talk and he wants silence. Persistent, she is determined to get him to open up and when she finds he has left the train she follows him. What follows is a series of misadventures centered around a girl who just can't seem to stay out of trouble and man who feels obliged to look out for her. By the time they finally reach their destination, his annoyance has turned to fondness, but wait, this is Bollywood! She is determined to elope with her love (we've not yet met him) and pulls Aditya into her crazy plot sending them off across the country on another journey. He sees her, he thinks, safely into the arms of her love before returning to his life as a changed man. When he learns that she is missing and no one has heard from her, he sets out to find her and it is now he who is needed to cheer.

3295254,5,B001165BG0,"Very enjoyable movie, with great natural acting/story.  The theme music is beautiful (really) and used well at several story points.

Unfortunately the expensive Blu-ray disc has no bonus material (just the movie).
The DVD main ""menu"" concept/look is better than the Blu-ray main menu (but that is a nit-pick).

I own both Blu-ray and the best version of the DVD (Dec 2007 release, anamorphic, highest bit-rate, front cover has them back-to-back and she is wearing a red dress), so I was able to compare them.  Both the DVD and Blu-ray have an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 (1920x1080) with Blu-ray at 24p.

The DVD has a good picture quality (but the factory burn method or disc blank is not the best), so the Blu-ray is only a slight improvement in sharpness/detail.
The color seems slightly better (more realistic) on the Blu-ray disc.  The optional subtitles are 95% the same between the DVD and the Blu-ray, but there are small differences (go figure).

When FAST FORWARDING (or freeze frame) the Blu-ray has a significantly improved picture quality (no jaggies) compared to those type actions with the DVD.

The Blu-ray audio is DTS capable, while the DVD audio is only Dolby Digital capable.

If you can afford the Blu-ray and don't already have the DVD (which is pretty good quality for a DVD), then I think it is reasonable to buy the
Blu-ray for the slight improvements (just really bummed there are NO BONUS items at all, since this movie SCREAMS for the fun/interesting extras they could have included).",1281139200,,1508,4.859375

3295258,5,B001165BG0,"JAB WE MET (HOW WE MET, I believe) is a totally endearing, sprightly screwball Bollywood comedy romance which may remind you of BRINGING UP BABY, with Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn or WHAT'S UP, DOC, with Ryan O'Neil and Barbra Streisand. In all three of these movies, the slightly (or very) nutty girl tries to get the guy by doing anything that comes into her adorable head. The only difference in this Bollywood film is that the girl seems unaware of the reasons for her behavior, at least we can look at it this way. The important thing is that Aditya (ably played by appealing male lead Shahid Kapoor) and Geet (excellently played by the exquisite Kareen Kapoor) have met, and that, one way or another, they do finally marry. They make a great couple; she's full of manic energy and life, and he's a melancholy millionaire who needs her influence so he can come back to life. The entire movie is a flashback relating to their children how they met.

  The stars apparently have not been married, though they were dating for a few years before this movie, after which they seperated! That's almost the opposite of this movie's plot.  Kareen Kapoor won Filfare's Best Actress Award for '07 for her energetic and fine-tuned performance as the nutty girl who gets the level-headed guy and inspires him to take back his life and then to excel. She is also the main influence in this excellent movie which makes it excel.

The good: The acting by Shahid Kapur and Kareena Kapoor and just about every one else in the film. The sets and locations. The dance sequences. Shahid is an excellent dancer.

The not so good: there is nothing original about the story. You do not get a real sense of how or why Aditya falls for Geet. Kareena is a weak dancer.

There is an unfolding of their stories as the film progresses, and the lessons she teaches him, he ends up teaching her when her life and her spirit falls apart.  These two characters are attractive and fun to watch.

The story a bit drawn out, mistaken identities and a not very believable love story included, and a few cheesy effects that made me laugh (model trains and autos -- perhaps they were placed tongue in cheek? it didn't strike me as a low budget flick to me) but it retained it's charm.

It's a cute film, light, with an obligatory dance sequence.  But not nearly on the same level of a ""Bride and Prejudice"".  If you approach this film with an open heart and no expectations, you'll be sure to enjoy the ride.

3295273,5,B001165BG0,"Outstanding performances and a splendid story make Jab We Met one of the best romantic comedies in years. Deeply depressed Aditya (played by Shahid Kapoor) meets vivacious Geet (Kareena Kapoor) on a train. He finds her annoying at first--and audiences will likely, too--but a series of mishaps brought on by Geet force them to travel together. Geet's infectious joie de vivre eventually inspires Aditya to embrace life with the same enthusiasm and optimism, and he finds himself falling for her, even though her heart belongs to another. When Geet is rejected by the man she wants to marry and her spirit is crushed, Aditya must do for her what she did for him--and he sacrifices his own happiness for hers, the truest measure of love. The two actors, who were romantically involved in real life during the making of the film, are perfect compliments to one another. Their amusing interplay and magnetic attraction are a pleasure to watch, and their misadventures, particularly the ones involving her boisterous family, are quite funny. This heartwarming tale about the meaning of life and the power of love can't be missed. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bollywood-Ticket/dp/B002Q0WPWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bollywood Ticket</a>)",1254009600,,1359,5.699507389162561
3295274,5,B001165BG0,"Playback singing in Jab We Met is superb. The female vocalist in the Ye Ishq Hai is wonderful.  The background score is marvelous and unobtrusive with some occasional virtuoso flute music. The middle of the movie is a great song and dance fest that actually flows with the movie and seems completely unspoiled by western influence.  It's difficult for us to stay in our chairs during Nagada Nagada and you know what? We don't.

The screen play is clever and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny both in what is said and what is seen. Directing and acting combine to produce many delightful scenes. You must be able to keep up completely with the subtitles, the expressions on the actor's faces and the flow of the story to fully appreciate the high quality of this film.  There are no cheesy moments and no unnecessary scenes. There are no thunderclaps or lighting bolts to provide emphasis. There is no slap-stick, there is no silliness and there are no negatives.

Kareena turns in a performance that (in my opinion) is on par with Rani in the movie Black.  Shahid is right there with just the right expressions on his face.  A very good film.",1252108800,9,1139,4.693467336683417

3295276,5,B001165BG0,"As most everyone else has already said, ""Jab We Met""'s plot is unoriginal. But so was ""It Happened One Night""'s.

Most of the film's appeal for me came from Kareena Kapoor's energetic portrayal of the scatterbrained but plucky and utterly charming Geet.

Movies like this aren't made in America anymore, and I'm sorry we've become too sophisticated for our own good. Scenes that are natural and sweet in ""Jab We Met"" could only be played with irony here, and that's too bad.

I remember when ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Tiger"" was such a hit here in the U.S. It was as if no one in American filmmaking had ever thought of showing, without explanation or apology, warriors who could leap to the treetops, as if such a thing were naturally within human power and capable of being filmed in real time. Some scenes in ""Jab We Met"" will strike some Americans as corny, and that is too bad. I loved it.

I haven't seen many Bollywood films, but the ones I've seen have all touched my heart *and* entertained me. There haven't been many U.S. films made in the last 30 years that have such unabashed romantic appeal for me.",1238889600,2,1112,4.57286432160804
3295277,4,B001165BG0,"""Jab We Met"" is a likable romantic comedy that stars Shahid Kapur and Kareena Kapoor as a pair of opposites brought together by a quirk of fate. Aditya [Shahid Kapur] is a young industrialist who is facing failure whilst at the helm of a company inherited from his father. To add insult to injury, he has also been jilted by his ex-girlfriend for another man. Feeling desperate and disillusioned, he abandons everything and boards a train at random. On the train, he meets a hyper-talkative young lass, Geet [Kareena Kapoor] who won't stop jabbering, annoying him immensely. The pair find themselves being thrown together despite Aditya's best efforts to shake Geet off, and he finds himself acting as Geet's escort as she finds her way home to Punjab. Along the way, both learn more about one another, Aditya finding Geet's optimistic and 'facing problems head on' attitude refreshing. Ironically, Geet later finds herself being consoled by Aditya as she faces her own personal crisis. The story is basically about two opposite souls who find that they actually share incredible chemistry with one another and bring out the best in each other.

The acting in this production was top-notch, especially by the two leads. In fact, I have watched Kareena in many other Bollywood movies and would rank this as one of her best performances. Initially, her performance in this movie comes across as annoying, with her incessant and inconsequential chit-chat, but over time, her  character is credibly developed to portray an emotionally vulnerable character that elicits one's sympathy. Shahid Kapur is also credible in his performance as the emotionally tormented soul who eventually learns to let go of his pain and make his peace with his past.

The songs were not really catchy or memorable, but the storyline and acting kept this movie fresh and interesting.",1238112000,,1857,5.062091503267974
3295278,5,B001165BG0,"JAB WE MET became one of the biggest hits in Bollywood cinema in 2007, and it's quite easy to see why. This is a very watchable romantic comedy and the two leads, Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor, dazzle in this, their best acting performances yet. After having seen this one just now, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dilwale-Dulhania-Le-Jayenge-2DISC-SET/dp/B000Z9PWKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (2DISC SET)</a>&nbsp;recently, I am this close to buying a train ticket to wherever. There've been other cinematic romances on the rails, yeah, but surely they couldn't have been more fun than the time spent on and off the tracks by Aditya and Geet in JAB WE MET.

Aditya (Shahid Kapoor) hasn't had a good time of it of late. His father had passed away a year ago, leaving him the reins to his corporate empire. But now business is on the skids. Too, the girl he loves has just gotten married. Despondent beyond belief, Aditya just simply wanders away. He somehow ends up on a train, and this is where he runs into Geet (Kareena Kapoor), who will change his life. Geet is a cute Punjabi girl who just will not stop talking. She exudes this vitality and exuberance which at first grates on Aditya's nerves; he actually implores her to leave him alone. But she keeps talking.

So it sucks for Aditya that, when he dispiritedly disembarks from the train, the girl follows him (to tell him the train is leaving) and is herself stranded. Aditya is left with no choice but to do the right thing, which is to escort Geet to her Punjabi home, from where, she cheerfully tells him, she plans to promptly run away and elope with her boyfriend (some guy named Anshuman). Aditya's irritation at Geet gradually turns to affection and then to something more. But, after a travelogue of adventures with her, he finds himself parting ways near Anshuman's doorstep as she goes to meet her lover. And yet the plans of mice and men and Geets don't always pan out. Because, nine months later...

JAB WE MET is a marvelous feel good movie, although you can't tell it by the opening scenes, which are depressing (the world falls apart for Aditya) but will intrigue you enough that you'll keep tuned in. Things perk up once Geet makes her appearance, and then get even better as Kareena and Shahid meet and instantly spark up the screen. JAB WE MET is the fourth teaming of these two (after&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fida-2004/dp/B000EQ5URI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fida (2004)</a>, CHUP CHUP KE, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/36-China-Town/dp/B000I0RVQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">36 China Town</a>, with 2008's MILENGE MILENGE being the fifth), and they've obviously managed to perfect that chemistry thing. There might be something to be said for these two having dated for several years in the past in real life (although they've since broken up).

In fact, this is the best I've seen of Shahid and of Kareena, whether together or in separate films. It's weird, because Aditya and Geet do end up in some pretty off-the-wall scenarios, but, although you know there are plenty of manipulative moments here, they never feel that contrived. The film unfolds in a graceful, natural way. All credit again to Shahid and Kareena (and, I guess, to the writing and directing). Shahid's Aditya, suffering from heartbreak and from pressures at the job. Kareena's Geet, feisty, carefree, and a constant chatterbox. Both actors put in beautiful, nuanced performances, never quite going over the top, to that point where credibility is lost. Kareena goes away from her vacuous ""beauty princess"" roles, and this is a good thing. Geet is so vibrant for most of the picture that it's a semi-shock to see her metamorphose into a sad, dejected girl in the film's second half. Your heart will go out to her. Kareena, for this role, won for Best Actress in various 2007 Bollywood award shows. She's so engaging in this picture that even her character's mile-a-minute prattle never gets annoying.

Meanwhile, Shahid has the tougher role. His part calls for a lack of showboating. Note that he doesn't scream or yell out or overdramatize his anguish to the world. Shahid is so good here, in the little things that he does - whether it's a look or a certain posture or maybe a quiet delivery of a line - that his pain is clearly conveyed. He makes a perfect foil for Kareena's flighty, optimistic character. Like Kareena, he's never been better.

JAB WE MET is set against a backdrop of eye-catching landscapes (from Mumbai to Bhatinda to Manali), and, this picturesque flavor enhances the film, trust me. The musical interludes are lively and colorful and catchy (especially the very upbeat ""Mauja Hi Mauja"" and ""Nagada Nagada Nagada Baja""). JAB WE MET is a warmhearted romantic romp. And it's funny. Some of the film's plot complications involve the usual screwball suspects: misunderstandings, mistaken identities, false pretenses... But it's all executed with such charm and good timing. JAB WE MET deserves to be seen, and seen by a lot of people. So, if you haven't yet, do give this one a try. Much as Geet did for Aditya, let Kareena and Shahid put color in your drab world.

I am serious about getting that train ticket...",1234310400,3,5359,5.145809414466131
8240657,4,B001165BG0,"Wealthy businessman Aditya (Shahid Kapoor), depressed over a broken relationship, walks out of his job and gets on the first train he sees, not caring where he goes.  Here he meets feisty Geet (Kareena Kapoor), who tries to chatter with him, despite his brush-off attempts.  When he walks off the train, she tries to retrieve him, and in the end the train leaves without them.  Aditya helps her return home, and finds himself attracted to Geet's childish enthusiasm.  Geet, however, already has a boyfriend with whom she plans to elope.

This comedy-drama is a delight.  The plot is both lighthearted and serious, and at times the viewer wonders how there will be a happy ending.  Kareena excels at her vivacious role, and Shahid is convincing throughout Aditya's gradual changes and emotions.  With the exception of the last one, which I actively disliked both song and dance, the music and choreography were good.  This romance is one that I would universally recommend.",1524355200,,972,4.987577639751553
