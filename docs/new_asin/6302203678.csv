434827,5,6302203678,Kathleen Turner is wonderful as the private eye in this very different murder/mystery movie!,1171152000,,92,5.642857142857143
434828,4,6302203678,"I REALLY LIKED IT.  IT HAS HUMOR, DRAMA AND SUSPENSE.  ONE OF KATHLEEN TURNER'S GREAT MOVIES !",1152489600,,94,4.470588235294118
434829,1,6302203678,"Kathleen Turner has gorgeous legs--and that is what this movie is about.  This movie purports to be a feminist movie and constantly manifests that men are vastly inferior to women.  Yet the movie includes gratuitous closeup after closeup of Turner's legs.  They wouldn't have made this film if Turner had to wear pants.  This movie suggests that men are led by their libido and consider women to be sex objects, yet the film itself treats Turner as nothing more than a sex object.",1137110400,,480,4.746987951807229
434830,5,6302203678,"What eles can I say...
This movie made me a Kathleen Turner fan.
In fact I watched my VHS tape so many times I wore the bloody thing out...",1097539200,,139,3.8275862068965516
434831,5,6302203678,"Fans of Sara Paretsky's heroine, V.I. Warshawski will enjoy the clever one-liners tossed off so well by Kathleen Turner. The character's wise-girl bravura is sometimes at odds with Turner's soft beauty, but the actor does some very convincing martial arts moves not usually associated with her past performances. It's fascinating to watch how fast and furious Ms. Turner can be in these scenes!

The plot features a 13 old kid whose father is murdered. Warshawski reluctantly allows the girl to accompany her on the investigation. The young actress playing the daughter wins over Warshwaski, and the hunt begins in earnest to discover who killed her daddy.

Readers of the detective series will spot many of the recurring characters from Paretsky's books, most notably Lottie and Murray. There is the disappointing exception of Mr. Contreras, who is given a tiny role and bears no resemblance to the character in the novels. His usual paternal advice and counsel is handled instead by Charles Durning as the police investigator who grudgingly helps V.I.

I liked this movie and highly recommend that you get yourself a copy -- mostly for Turner's shining screen presence. She may not be the most obvious choice for portraying V.I., but she keeps you enthralled in every scene with her great sense of humor and tough tenacity. It would have been wonderful if this movie had been turned into a series. After the movie ended, I wanted to see more!

The video quality is excellent and was taken from an outstanding print, so you get your money's worth with the DVD version.",1046908800,8,1569,4.9543726235741445
434832,3,6302203678,"This likeable, harmless Kathleen Turner vehicle is one of those films that most ""name"" critics have viciously attacked for no  logical reasons (critics seem to be as frequently susceptible amongst themselves to ""herd mentality"" as the rest of us po' ignorant movin' pitcher watchin' folk). Turner's ""V.I. Warshawski"" is a very credible ""tough broad"" character,treading the fine line between sexiness and surliness with skill and style. Granted, the predictable, standard-issue plot of this detective thriller is a minus, but the appealing cast and Turner's charisma carry the day. If you are a fan of the Warshawski books (or J.A. Jance and Sue Grafton's female detective stories)you'll find the mood and atmosphere of the film quite true to the genre. If your name is Leonard Maltin, take a pill and just relax.",980208000,14,812,5.198473282442748

434875,3,6302203678,I always watch a kathleen turner movie. I really like this turner and sanders are great together. The story could be better. The reason i give it three stars is the kid. She is obnoxious. She curses like an 80 yr. old. She brings the movie way down. If you replace her with another character i would have given it five stars.

435014,4,6302203678,"Funny and intriguing film about a keen private detective who uses underestimation to her advantage. When V.I. meets an ex hockey player who is under pressure from his brothers to sell his business, he ends up hiring her to watch his smart mouthed 13 year old daughter while he goes to take care of business. But she 'escapes' and they both end up heading for the docks to find her dad. But when they find out there was an explosion and he is now dead, the now orphan wants to hire her to help her find out who killed her dad and why. And there's a few suspects- including a Mother who is in a perpetual state of recovery, a edgy, high strung, power mad father in law who happens to be the recently deceased's brother, and his other brother, a seemingly unflappable, all business man. But with the help of a philandering but well meaning and very resourceful reporter, who is V.I.'s on again, off again boyfriend, the two of them pull out all the stops to find out who did it and why. A fun, comedy filled romp that features Jay O. Sanders, Angela Goethals, Charles Durning and a fabulous Kathleen Turner in the title role.",1421884800,3,1122,4.399038461538462
435015,1,6302203678,"Hated this film from the get go. And I was reminded of the fact when we watched it again last year. I've read enough Sara Paretsky novels to know that the glamorpuss that Kathleen Turner portrays here is nothing like the character in the book--who is down-and-dirty and rough-and-tumble. I have nothing against Turner in the right role (adore Romancing the Stone), but this ain't it. (My dream V.I. would have been Cher, then in the prime of her acting career. Imagine a tough, rumpled, streetwise Loretta Castorini. ) Many people here seem to like the film, and that's fine. But notice this: The film killed any potential V.I. Warshawski franchise dead as a doornail, to this day. Just a dreadful adaptation of the first big-time female P.I. protagonist.",1421712000,,755,4.8604651162790695

Then I recently saw it for sale for $5 in bluray format, so I quickly snapped it up.

I tend to agree with those who say the video quality of this disk is probably no greater than that of a DVD, but it is still an upgrade from my old VHS tape.

On the downside, there are no extras on this disc. No subtitles, no closed-captions of course. No real menu, no surround soundtrack, just plain old stereo.

This is just a bare-bones disk, but it is a dandy murder mystery set in Chicago with memorable characters, including Jay O. Sanders playing sleazy, but loveable journalist Murray Ryerson, Wayne Knight as Earl 'Bonehead' Smeissen, and Charles Durning as Det. Lt. Bobby Mallory.

The story is light and breezy, the pace is fast and the dialogue is sharp and funny. This is one of my favorite movies.

435138,1,6302203678,"This review is short and sweet and has to to do with the quality of the blu-ray treatment or lack there-of. Sadly most reviews seen at the Amazon forum are about the movie's story and rarely about the disc quality itself. Countless takes on the story with everyone having their own opinion. But lets face it, its truly in the eye of the beholder and not left to others to decide how good a movie is.
 Now about the quality of this Blu-ray disc. be warned it's atrocious thus the 1 star rating. Not for the movie since I just loved Kathleen Turner in this title. In my humble opnion she was at her sexiest and at her peak in looks. Its not a great movie but totally acceptable because of Kathleen's presence. The classic film goddess comes to mind. Any way I had the first standard dvd offered and decided to upgrade for a better picture to Blu-ray. Well it appears sharper but odd that the same white specs and garbage that littered the DVD version is very much apparent here,.. and even in the same places as that earlier version. I do know a little about compression and know that it is possible to re-process the same mpeg2 files used for the first DVD release to a larger different compression scheme such as the 1080p format. The quality would not improve but you can do it. Not saying they did that but it sure appears that way from the print used here. Its identical and since it is highly unlikely for these white specs to repeat themselves exactly where they appeared before on the first issue of the standard DVD. Very sad they didn't use a much better print this time around or just use a print period intead of re-processing the earlier files. Again just my observation here on this Blu-ray treatment of this title. In my opinion not worth upgrading to, since the overall appearance of this movie will just leave you highly disappointed in how some of these companies view the buying public.",1334275200,31,1903,4.468390804597701
435179,5,6302203678,"I had this on VHS, so I am very glad to have on DVD. Great movie to watch, also if you want to see a really great movie, check out Undercover Blues, also a very good movie if you like Kathleen Turner movies",1330473600,3,206,3.813953488372093
435180,4,6302203678,"I love this movie and when I saw it on Blu-ray for 4.99 I figured what the heck I'd upgrade from my DVD to the Blu-ray version.  I never knew you could downgrade with a Blu-ray.  My DVD offers more than this does including better sound and closed captioning.  I had not read the reviews before ordering; I wish I had done so otherwise I would not have gotten this.  In this day and age I would think that closed captioning would be standard.

The movie itself is great.  No, it would never win an Oscar but it is great mindless fun that can be enjoyed at any time.  The actors are great in it and I always enjoy Charles Durning who is perfect as the police detective.",1330214400,5,667,4.1640625
435181,5,6302203678,"Alota action, very good print, audio, scripting (funny!) and action. So many films and actors don't stand up over the years; not so this funny, raunchy action flick and ageless woman. Like all of Mz Turner's films her unqiue humor and physicality make her legend. And too, there's her choice of rare, over-the-edge scripts. My favorites: ROMANCING THE STONE, SERIAL MOM, UDERCOVER BLUES, PRIZZI'S HONOR (of course!), WAR OF THE ROSES, and the edgiest of all, CRIMES OF PASSSION. I noted her movies' prices have held up over the years, evidence alota viewers appreciate her work and taste in scripts. (CRIME OF PASSION, new, $34.95! Used, $9.24; classic prices)

I can't speak for DVDs, but my BluRay version had a fine picture; sound too.

I've just talked myself into ordering a flick of hers I'd missed. As most are, it's a 4-star+ title.  (Oops! At $20.95, SWITCHING CHANNELS goes on my wish list. See? $20 for a 1988 Hollywood film? What's that say?)",1314576000,4,954,4.840490797546012
435182,5,6302203678,"Great movie with Kathleen Turner bringing a tough, smart-ass private detective to life protecting a young girl. I hadn't seen this in years and it was excellent in blu-ray.",1311638400,6,172,4.9655172413793105
435183,4,6302203678,"V.I. Warshawski is a dated picture. It come from a time when being coarse and raw was ""new.""  But in this case it works because the raw and coarse woman is interesting. A private eye more interested in a case than in the bucks it can bring her. A woman who lives life on her own terms. A woman who accepts her femininity without letting it limit her. Kathleen Turner is perfect for this role.

The story is nothing new, but does have its own spin. More important are the characters, the way they are revealed, and the growth they display over the course of the story.

V.I. Warshawski is one of several movies that have been released in low-priced Blu Rays where the only ""feature"" is the feature. Small films that otherwise might be missed. Good entertainment for the money. As such V.I. Warshawski, in the eyes of this film lover, works just fine.",1310169600,17,849,4.464516129032258

I never thought it would take so little time to start getting craby material on Blu-Ray

The quality of the image is alright but you don't get a single extra. They give you the movie and that's that!
No subtitles for any language (not even for the hearing impaired), no extras of any kind, not even the theatrical trailer! Pretty soon the disc itself won't be labeled.",1309824000,5,454,4.524390243902439

No wonder why there were no other movie versions of Sara Paretsky Heroin, after this insulting and some what misogynistic attempt at a movie.

435186,5,6302203678,"Kathleen Turner is just great as a private investigator, hard nosed and hard boiled but with a soft inner heart. This video hearkens back to those old private investigators like sam spade. There's plenty of action especially a great section where she is chased on the waterfront. Kathleen is a great beauty especially for her fondness for those red high heeled shoes. Very entertaining and one of the great Turner flicks. She even has an ongoing relationship with her ex.

Also, I had just watched Body Heat, starring Kathleen Turner, for maybe the 10th time, Turner's signature film. Unfortunately the content is weak, lacks drama, conclusion is telegraphed miles in advance and Turner tries to hard to be the tough ""ballsy"" cop with a heart of gold. Compared to her best work, this one is a limp noodle and not worth the feminist attention it has received. If you're looking for a good female cop movie, try Silence of the Lambs or Black Widow.
