392315,5,6301971914,"This is one of my ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIES!  It's in the top five on my favorite movie list and it's been at the top of that list since they day I saw it. Fabulous acting by all the cast members. This movie is not about being a Gene Hackman fan or Henry Thomas fan, although I am a fan of both.  It's about human emotion and family relationships, namely father and son. It's a story that really draws you in so that you relate to the characters. I cry every time I see this film so you might want to have some tissues on hand. If you like a good drama, then you'll definitely like this movie. ENJOY THE SHOW!  Eagerly awaiting the DVD version!",1087776000,9,643,4.087301587301587

I walked out of the theater after thirty minutes.  The ONLY time I've ever done that.  Half the audience left before me.  I don't understand how the brilliant Gene Hackman got into this.  Maybe he wanted a challenge.  If you are a true Hackman enthusiast and must see everything he's ever made, I suggest you rent this first and think hard before shelling out and buying it.",1055980800,,523,4.222222222222222
392397,5,6301971914,"The sadest thing about this movie is that although it is beyond excellent, it was apparently released in 2003 on VHS, but has yet to be released on DVD, in spite of many customers begging for it.

Yes, it is a tearjerker, as life often is, but it is never maudlin, like many tearjerkers often are.  The plot is tight, story rings true, and the acting, as mentioned by others, is outstanding.

I have long had it connected with another outstanding, but unavilable movie, staring Robert Duvall, in which he played a man living alone in a winter, sheep herder's mountain cabin.  A pregnant woman about to deliver her baby, and freezing to death, knocked on his door, and the story unfolds.  Can't even recall the name of that one (saw it on TV years ago), and as far as I've been able to discover, it's not even available on VHS, much less DVD.  It's not a tearjerker, per se, but the two are connected in my head because they both present sensitive dramas with outstanding performances by a limited cast.  They both fit Aristotle's ""prescription"" for good plays:  few characters, (none unessential to the story), and story taking place in one location, over a limited amount of time. They both leave one contemplating moral values, especially kindness.  As someone said, ""We pass this way but once.""  It is human to fail in our travels, but more importantly, it is equally (or more) human to strive to suceed.

I'd also like to know, while on the missing movie subject, why Ayn Rand's ""We the Living"" has never been released in English.  Is it being politically supressed?",1354838400,2,1570,4.648550724637682
392398,5,6301971914,"I saw the sneak preview for ""Misunderstood"" in St. Louis.  This is one of my all time drama film picks. The realistic depiction of a family tragedy and the misunderstandings between adults and children.  Every older child blamed or held accountable for a younger siblings actions will understand this film! The story was very well acted, the connection with the audience was apparent. One could hear men sobbing as their own experiences were brought to mind.  There was a family with three teen-aged boys in front of us, at the end of the film one of the boys commented that there wasn't a dry eye in the house.  I think he was right.

The released film had some of the emotional scenes removed, I would like to see the sneak preview version again.  Hopefully will be released in more current format soon.",1302825600,4,805,4.633802816901408

392401,4,6301971914,"(This review contains some spoilers.)

Filmed in Tunisia in the early 80s, Misunderstood is the story of a father and his two sons who are trying to cope with the sudden, recent death of their wife and mother. Gene Hackman plays the father, a wealthy businessman, who is so wrapped up in his own grief that he doesn't realize that his oldest son, played by Henry Thomas (of ET), is also hurting. Huckleberry Fox (Terms of Endearment) plays the babyish, loving and aggravating younger brother.

The movie opens with the mother's funeral. The boys are conspicuously absent because they haven't been told that their mother is dead. When she first became ill, the father sent them away to stay with friends, so they didn't even know she was sick. After the funeral, the father informs the oldest boy, 12-year-old Alexander, about the situation, but cautions him against telling his younger brother because he feels the boy is too young and fragile to handle the news.

Alexander then has to deal with his grief on his own, angry at his father for keeping him in the dark and unable to draw upon his brother for comfort. His situation is made worse by his having to field questions from his baby brother about ""when is mom coming back?"" Bewildered and confused, Andrew finds himself grieving at the funeral of a stranger. It gives him a chance for closure that he missed by not being able to attend his mother's funeral. The stranger's son invites Alexander to attend the reception, where the boy learns that the dead go to a wonderful place where there are ginger waters and platters of dates. It's a comforting vision that he later shares, when his brother finally learns that their mother is never coming back.

The story is centered around the relationship of the father and eldest son. The father tries to do what is best for his kids, but it's painfully apparent that his wife was the primary caregiver who held the family together. She read them to sleep, cut up their food and attended school events. The father does what he can, trying to balance work and family, but his actions often come out wrong, such as when he hires a horrible governess or comes late to a judo tournament.

Andrew understands that his father is grieving and he tries to be supportive and take on more responsibilities, but although his father thinks of him as a grownup, his father still treats him like a child, so Andrew is caught between two roles, getting the short end of each. Ever eager to please, Andrew keeps trying to win his father's approval, but his actions get misunderstood, causing his father to be disappointed and angry. As events unfold, so does Andrew's sense of alienation and frustration.

Just as the father views Andrew as an adult, he views the younger son as a baby. As a result, the younger son gets bedtime stories and hugs and the older son gets handshakes.

As the boys' uncle observed, ""You treat Alexander like a cold you don't want to catch.""

The cast is good and solid. Gene Hackman is superb as usual, giving a strong, understated performance. Rip Torn, who plays his business partner and brother-in-law, gives an equally strong performance as the perceptive and caring uncle. Both men are believable as former blackmarketeers who became legitimate businessmen. Huckleberry Fox, with his big eyes and moppet looks, is the typical little brother: sometimes a lovable charmer and sometimes a bratty stinker.

Much of the story focuses on Thomas, who gives a simple, moving performance as a sad and lonely, little boy, hungry for his father's trust and love. With a child's perspective, he struggles to make sense of the way his world has changed and to try to figure out a way to make things like they were. The script relies heavily on Thomas' expressions and actions to convey what is going on. The hungry, wistful look on Alexander's face as he watches his father hug his younger brother is far more eloquent than if he said ""I wish you loved me too."" The only unrealistic thing is that he is far more loving to his often annoying younger brother than his brother deserves.

The movie also brings up the type of questions that might run through a child's mind. What happened to mom? Where did she go? Why can't I see her? What is death? If dad gets remarried will that makes things like they were before?

The story is quietly told. It features some beautiful scenic shots of the white clay Arabian buildings and the surrounding desert. There are no explosions or action scenes, though there are a few tense heart-stopping moments. There is a climax where the son finally has his say and the father faces a terrible price for his mistakes, but I won't give away more than that. If you can watch that scene with dry eyes, you are far tougher than I am.

(I'd really prefer to give the movie 4-1/2 stars, but that wasn't an option. )",1280275200,6,4847,4.662763466042154
392402,5,6301971914,"This movie seems to be banned eveywhere. Banned from being sold in stores, shown on television and so forth and I can't understand why. It's very sad, no doubt but still deserves to be shown equally like any other film.
Anyway, to get to the point, in spite of the fact Gene Hackman and Henry Thomas's characters are the essence of the story, I believe Henry Thomas and Huckleberry Fox hold this film together. The love between them; especially the hugging, always touches my heart. Their relationship is the kind of relationship all siblings across the world should have. As for the rest of the film, I get pissed off at Gene Hackman's character. Not allowing his sons to be with their mother when she's ill, not allowing them to go to their own mother's funeral, telling Andrew not to tell Miles his mother is gone, treating Andrew like someone who doesn't need nurturing when Andrew obviously does need it,
taking the word of that selfish, inconsiderate, lying, unfair old hag Mrs. Paley against the word of his own children,
. . . the man obviously has his head screwed on wrong. I believe he's totally dispicable!!
Thank God for those two beautiful boys. Without them, there wouldn't be any film. Henry and Huckleberry, Andrew and Miles are two of a kind. I wish they'd done more films together.",1277769600,3,1300,4.681222707423581
392403,5,6301971914,"I first saw this movie as a child...1984 certainly doesn't seem right.  I believe it may have been earlier.  Anyho, one of my favorite movies.  Makes me cry everytime.  I purchased this and transferred it onto DVD.  Sadly, my VHS tape wasn't the best quality, so my DVD didn't come out too well.  My wife makes fun of me because I cry like a sissy mary girl throughout this movie.",1277164800,,380,4.357142857142857
392404,5,6301971914,"This is one of my all time top-ten favorite movies.  As far from a Hollywood film as it is possible to get.  Every member of the cast is phenomenal, but Henry Thomas hit home like a sledge hammer.  How a kid could play that role the way he did is absolutely beyond my comprehension.",1267228800,,282,4.185185185185185
392405,5,6301971914,"if you have ever struggled with a strained relationship with a parent or a rivalry with a sibling, please watch this film. the father of the two boys, gene hackman, is at his best, looking slim and elegant as a wealthy workaholic businessman exported to oversee his company's travails in Tunsia. he is  silently, secretively mourning the the death of his beloved  wife. unable to properly grieve, he instead turns all his energies towards his work, and virtually abandons his role as the surviving  parent, displaying little concern or compassion for his children, especially his oldest child (played by henry thomas, of E.T. fame.)

sadly, except for moments when he's upbraiding, threatening,  or harshly criticizing him, promising to have him sent  away to a military school, or comparing him unfavourable to his youngest brother, hackman's character has no use for that of thomas's. as the oldest boy, the crushing look of rejection and fear and the overwhelming feeling of failure his fatehr instills in him is written starkly all over the young actor's face. it is an outstanding, brutal, realistic, and nuanced performance.

hackman's ""dad"" character unconsciously alienates that of  thomas's ""son,""  further and further increasing their estrangement as he falls deeper and deeper into his own rage and depression, the rage and depression of a repressed and stifled, unacknowledged and unexpressed grief. he  adds further injury to his children by  sometimes stopping to fawn over his cutest, youngest, still ""good"" child, played by the darling huckleberry fox, in the presence of thomas, who has usually just received another verbal tirade,  unfeeling  glare, or snickering punishment.

one assumes that one of the children must remind hackman more of his dead wife.

perhaps, too, he is  still capable of handling the simple interaction  w/  the  *littlest boy*, the virtual babe, a child  barely past toddling, who is  still too young to  dwell upon and truly understand the finality of death, than he is able to console the older (though quite still young himself, 9 or 10 at the most) son, who is, obviously much savvier and  more aware of such things.

 despite the older boy's many heartfelt attempts, outright tender pleas, and  desperate endeavors to please his dad, the father scarcely pays attention to him. he never communicates any warmth or concern towards him, or even bestows upon him the slightest amount of love.  his ignorance is summarized best in a wrenching monologue young thomas gives  after being horrible injured in a stunt gone awry: ""you never  talk to me, you never hold me, you never tell me stories, you never take my hand, you never... understand...""  this scene will pull your heart out.

hackman refuses to answer the more difficult questions thomas has:  how did his mom die? why did  she have to pass away? why did they get married and have him? how  should they remember her? WILL they remember her?  unfortunately, he also  makes no attempts  to attend to thomas's  increasingly  cavalier  behavior. instead, he is gruff and indifferent, showing shameless favourtism to his youngest boy (fox), and in the process breaking thomas's spirit and heart.

 the tears of an older child who knew well  and still grieves for his lost  mom are devastating to view alas, go largely unseen and unacknowledged, by his condemned and  conflicted father,  until a tragedy near the end of the film at last pulls the older man and his forgotten boy together one last time.

this is magnificent acting of the highest caliber from both leading men. hackman is particularly restrained and dignified, creating an amazing amount  sympathy for an antagonistic, at times cruel, man.

get out your kleenex, 'cause there won't be a dry eye in the house when this one's on.

if you have  ever felt abandoned or alienated  by a parent, looked over in favor of a younger or older sibling, or, indeed, simply  felt ""misunderstood,"" will love this movie.

In the original story the father was a politician. He hated his older son and loved his second son.
Why?

The answer would have been obvious for anyone who knows anything about illegitimacy.

It is clear that the father (and the second son, whose hatred of his older half-brother is not well disguised in the original book which is now available in pdf) hate the older son with guts since the older son, not deserving the position, would inherit everything.

And, the father and the real son do get their wish. It appears tragic, but not really so.

I do think it actually happened to someone in the author's circle, somebody important, and that made thats book quietly go out of print for so long.",1435881600,,864,4.733333333333333

Gene Hackman & Rip Torn play well against each other as brothers-in-law, and Henry Thomas (Elliott from ""E.T."" fame) plays his role as Andrew Rawley brilliantly, with much feeling and genuine attachment to the role he plays.

A heartwarming film, albeit with a sad ending. Brilliant!",1364601600,2,736,5.024590163934426
