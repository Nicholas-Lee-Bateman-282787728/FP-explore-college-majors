537894,1,630299988X,"This video is very slow and repetitive, so I give this 1 point. I think to hold any attention for long it has to be better.  At least for me this was a bad experience. Try real yoga of those who know how to teach it for beginners. Try ""Back Care Yoga for Beginners"".

537895,5,630299988X,"This is by far the best beginners yoga tape I have seen.  She is very descriptive of every move and breath, and shows how to get from one postion to the next if you are not yet Gumby.  Very relaxing way to work up a sweat!  This is a great stepping stone to get you accustomed to basic positions and breathing, with out getting overwelmed.  I'm sending this on to my Mom, who purchased a Denise Austin yoga video and couldn't keep up with it.  I'm sure she'll enjoy this one, as will you!",997315200,9,488,4.148936170212766
537896,4,630299988X,"I do not consider myself an expert on yoga, I've learned what I can and try to do what's best  for my own body and limitations.  Ms. Fonda's yoga  tape, although the moves are very basic, still made me work up a good  sweat.
The movements she does here can be found on pretty much any good,  basic yoga tape.  I have other yoga tapes in my library, and the movements  here have been modified for the ""non-yoga"" practicioner. Still,  Ms. Fonda's soothing alto voice, clear instruction, and encouragement to  ""do your best""  make this video worthwhile.  It's actually a nice  contrast to doing something like Bryan Kest's Power Yoga 1.  You can still  get the intensity and benefits of a good workout without the rapidity.  There is also a section of deep breathing exercises, followed by a  relaxation section.  The relaxation section of this video is very soothing  and made me feel alive, loose, and energized.  You may want to use a pillow  for your head during this portion.
I alternate this tape along with Mr.  Kest's, as well as Dixie Carter's ""Unworkout 1 and 2"".  I take  one day off a week, but even on that day off, I do the evening portion of  ""Unworkout 2"".
I recommend this tape for anyone who wants a  gentle, but still beneficial, yoga workout.",966211200,24,1259,4.538116591928251
537897,5,630299988X,This tape allows you to get the feel of yoga and is somewhat challenging if you aren't in great physical condition.  I'm currently using this tape as a tool to get in shape for more difficult yoga.  It is great for  beginners!,961027200,8,226,4.333333333333333
537898,1,630299988X,"This video may be very good for someone who has never done yoga before but after working with yoga even a little while I found that this video didn't hold my interest. And I only used it a few times before shelving it for  good. I didn't get the challenge or the feeling of serenity that I get from  other tapes, especially the Living Arts tapes. If you're looking for a  beginning video try Yoga Practice for Beginners.",948758400,21,420,4.358974358974359
537899,5,630299988X,"I had tried other yoga exercises in the past, and felt intimidated and uncertain of the postures. Jane gives excellent explanations and demonstrations of the positions, and her encouragement is helpful. The  video is easy to follow, and excellent for a beginning to intermediate yoga  practitioner. Recommended!",944611200,2,311,5.595744680851064
537900,5,630299988X,"This is the best video I've seen for a beginner to use for a great yoga-style workout.  I cured my chronic lower back pain doing this workout 3 times a week! Jane is a wonderful teacher; she really pays attention to  the all important details.  It's not traditional yoga, but that's part of  the charm for me.  This workout goes much quicker than more traditional  yoga tapes, which is great for those with limited time to work out!",942710400,42,432,4.4743589743589745
538126,5,630299988X,"I absolutely love this workout.  This is not a power yoga tape, if you want that try ""crunch fitness fat burning yoga."" This is the best yoga workout that I've seen for beginners.  I've been doing yoga for 13 years and I always come back to this one whenever I've taken a lengthy break from working out.  It helps me with my flexibility and is especially good after a very hard workout with weights or running.  I wish they had this on DVD, I'd love to give this as a gift, but most people don't have VCR's anymore.

538127,5,630299988X,"What can I say?  Jane Fonda has been my ""personal trainer"" since I bought my first VHS tape in 1995. I wanted to look like Kathie Lee Gifford on our first Carnival Cruise.  I rented the Yoga tape from my library to see if I was cut out for this type of exercise and loved it.  I've purchased other tapes for a variety of moves.  This tape only addresses the poses surrounding the sun salutation, but it is a perfect warm up, stretch and work out for every level of fitness.  I feel like a rubberband when I am finished. I do this tape 3-4 times a week still.  The seated breath awareness portion is very calming and her soothing voice ( as I said I am used to her!) is relaxing.  I had ACL replacement 2 years ago at age 48 and this is what got my knee back in shape, even more so than physical therapy.  In fact, my PT gave his approval once learning of the tape and is recommending it to his other patients.  Thank you Jane!",1287360000,,926,4.071823204419889
538128,5,630299988X,I have liked Jane Fonda's tapes since the first one.  I can't do as much of her other tapes anymore (getting too old)so I thought I would try her Yoga tape.  It is very good.  Takes you nice and slow.  Some other yoga tapes I have are just too difficult to do.  They require more balance than I used to have.  I can do this one and feel good when I am done.  It has short segments to it so that you can just do it in a few minutes instead of feeling guilty if you don't finish a 40-60 minute tape.,1251763200,,497,3.8137254901960786
538129,2,630299988X,It's a fair video as Jane tends to move the poses faster than I am used to. Okay for beginners.,1249084800,,95,3.8
538130,5,630299988X,"This is the best yoga exercise tape I have ever done.  It is good for beginners, older exercisers and people who like to tone up and stretch without getting into the difficult, weird positions.  Very calming and relaxing.  I recommend it to anyone.",1239235200,,248,4.72093023255814

538132,5,630299988X,"I got this tape as a present for my birthday. I think it is a really good yoga tape. Jane Fonda really makes yoga fun and easy. This tape is ideal for experienced yoga people as it is for non-yoga people.

  Jane Fonda goes through every move very carefully. I felt really realxed and stretched out after this tape. It is real good stress reducing tape. It is really good for flexibility. Jane`s Sun Salutation routine really gets the flexibility going. After you are none with this tape you will feel great. It is actually one of my favorite yoga tapes. Really good for people who don`t know about yoga and want to start doing it. It is also good for people who do alot of stregth training and aerobics. I guarantee you`ll love this yoga routine.",1152230400,,747,4.437956204379562
538133,5,630299988X,"""Jane Fonda's Yoga Exercise Workout"" is one of the first exercise videos I bought, and it's still one of my favorites!

Jane starts out with a 20-minute stretching/toning routine that consists of a number of different poses.  Next, she focuses on the Sun Salutation and leads you through a 15-minute segment based on the one sequence.  She starts with the easiest variation of the routine, and gradually increases the intensity.  Experienced yoga practitioners can repeat Level 3 (the most difficult level) three times, while beginners can stick to Level 1 (the easiest level).  Throughout the segment, she repeats her demonstration of the lower levels for newbies.  Jane finishes with a 15-minute relaxation routine.  While some people might enjoy this section the most, I generally skip it.

Since beginning yoga, I've bought a number of other yoga instructionals, all on DVD; ""Jane Fonda's Yoga Exercise Workout"" is the only VHS tape I own.  As much as I like the workout, as well as Jane's easygoing teaching style, I don't use the tape as much as I should.  I just don't find the VHS tape as convenient as the DVDs, which usually have short segments that you can easily navigate through (many even let you customize your own workout).  It would be great if they released ""Jane Fonda's Yoga Exercise Workout"" on a DVD format (hint, hint, guys!).  Other than this minor complaint, though, I'd definitely recommend ""Jane Fonda's Yoga Exercise Workout"" to beginners and intermediates alike (advanced users might want to stick to some of Rodney Yee's more difficult workouts).",1117670400,4,1576,5.042471042471043
538134,5,630299988X,"In this tape, Jane Fonda gives a basic introduction to each of the difficult yoga poses in the Sun Salutation before going into the full Salutation. The tape offers three levels, thus bringing this particular series of poses into the range of even the beginning student. It is one of the best tutorials I have come across for this demanding but rewarding exercise.",1090886400,5,364,4.7936507936507935

7835094,1,630299988X,"I bought and used this VHS years ago and it's the very BEST yoga workout I've ever purchased.  That's saying something because I've purchased many since trying to find something comparable in DVD.  Why oh why won't they release it in DVD?!  I've even taken my old tape to have it converted but that's not an option since its a commercial video.  It's a 5 star video that can't be used unless you have a VCR and old TV that will play the outdated sound format.  Now, I'm hoping to find an individual that can transfer for me but that's my only hope to use it again.
