Visually, Curse of the Golden Flower actually rivaled Memoirs and Daggers but all 4 are stunning movies that suck you into the story with the breath taking imagery and high production values. I cannot recommend ANY collection of movies I have purchased more than I recommend these. If this type of movie appeals to you I promise you will not be dissappointed!",1313884800,2,440,4.7272727272727275
8260717,3,B00162OF2A,Only Crouching Tiger is worth it.  The rest is very average with a bad plot and just a pain to watch.,1216512000,,101,3.8095238095238093
8260718,5,B00162OF2A,"I was sitting actually watching ""Daggers"" when I received an email notification from Amazon to leave a review on this 4-pack.  The irony!

I immediately hopped on this purchase when I saw it was available through a Gold Box offer for $28.  I already owned ""Geisha"", but still felt it was worth the value.

Daggers has excellent cinematic scenes and an easy to follow plot.  The DVDs have English, Chinese, and French languages for your listening pleasure, although you can also read the subtitles.  The DVD also has some excellent bonus features including commentaries.

Again, I'd already seen Geisha (and read the book).  I thought it was an excellent movie loosely based on the author's version.

I'd also seen Crouching Tiger long ago when it was first released on DVD , but I've never owned it.

Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li, and Chow Yun Fat are the main stars in these four movies.  I've always been a fan, so ordering these was a no-brainer.

What I mean to say is for the price, no one skimped on this 4-pack.  They're all shown in widescreen with excellent DVD quality. Now my main television is not flat screen, HDTV 1080i/p/g/r/c (or whatever), it's just a good movie with no graininess or film skipping.  That's my amateur opinion!  :-)

Bottom line, add this to your collection asap!

What I wouldn't do, is pay the $60 premium some of these folks are trying to sell them.  Wait for another Gold Box or buy them used to add to your library.  You'll come out on top and have an excellent collection in your hands.",1216512000,6,1517,4.593283582089552
8260719,3,B00162OF2A,My family liked the Flying Daggers and Crouching Dragon movies the best of the four pack.  More action in the aforementioned - Memoirs of a Geisha was a good story but I like the other movies much better.,1215129600,,204,4.368421052631579
