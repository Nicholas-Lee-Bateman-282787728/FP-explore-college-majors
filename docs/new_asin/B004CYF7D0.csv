4329905,4,B004CYF7D0,I enjoyed my DVD Castle: Cast & Creators Live at the Paley Center. I wish the cast had been able to talk more than they did but the comments from everybody were fun.,1323734400,,165,4.03030303030303
4329906,5,B004CYF7D0,"The Tom Bergeron hosts in his usual zaney, comedic fashion paying careful attention not only to the cast and procuders but the audience members who asked questions.  Having seen other interviews, I was surprised and very pleased to see that Susan Sullivan was included here.

This DVD arrived in a package with the complete first 3 seasons of Castle.  The package arrived in excellent shape and in a timely manner.  The content of the program is great.  The sound and video quality are excellent as well.  I recommend this DVD to anyone who is a Castle fan.  It is as much fun as any of their shows.",1323648000,,599,4.542056074766355
4329907,4,B004CYF7D0,"As a fan of the show Castle this video really changed my mind about one of the main actors in the series.  I won't reveal which one - watch it and you decide.  Even with that I really enjoyed the little bit of inside access this DVD gives.  It's a nice way to ""meet"" all of the main players in what is a terrific show that I can't wait to see each week.",1313971200,,353,3.808219178082192
4329908,5,B004CYF7D0,"I wasn't sure about spending $20 on the Paley Center DVD, but I'm glad I did! It's so fun and entertaining to see the cast interact. It's something you can watch multiple times and still be entertained. I love it when Stana says, ""There's nothing sexier than sword play!"" She is such a tease even off camera haha! I would definitely recommend this to any Castle fan!",1313971200,4,366,4.477611940298507
4329909,5,B004CYF7D0,"We found it very interesting to learn more about the actors, actresses, producers, directors, etc. involved in the show. The writer and director gave very worthwhile insight in what is involved in putting on the show...the story line, rehearsals, input from the actors, and preparation necessary. The ""espirit de corps"" between all is very impressive. They seem to really be enjoying what they are doing, and are anxious to create a top notch, outstanding, enjoyable and intriguing show. BTW, we have been long time fans of Susan Sullivan ever since she was a star, ""Lenore"", in a soap opera.

We have been great and loyal fans of ""Castle"" since its' inception, and this just solidifies our interest in the performing artists of the show.

Long may it endure!!!",1304208000,17,761,4.9375
4329910,5,B004CYF7D0,"If you love Castle, you'll love this...if you haven't seen Castle, find out what you are missing!  The cast chemistry and writing is great.",1301270400,4,139,4.791666666666667
4329911,4,B004CYF7D0,"Not sure what I was expecting at $18, but the show itself was as advertised. Just thought there might be some extras at that price. Still, overall happy.",1291507200,16,153,4.5
4329912,5,B004CYF7D0,"This was an event held at the Paley Center for Media in Beverly Hills, CA and I was able to be there. :) To give you a perspective of when in the series this happened, we saw an advance screening of the episode ""Tick, Tick, Tick"" which, I believe, aired the following Monday night on ABC. Unlike some events that I've attended at the Paley, this one was only for those who had tickets to the panel held in the theater, so it was a small group of people. Most of the cast was present before the screening began, being interviewed and photographed by various media. Every one looked wonderful...and, yes, Nathan Fillion wore jeans and that bright blue shirt! (He still looked good. <g>)

Looks like only the panel itself will be included on the DVD but, if you're a big CASTLE fan, it will be a treasure. I was disappointed that this wasn't included on the show's Season 2 DVD set, as I already have that, but perhaps this bodes well for the show to be included in PaleyFest 2011, which is held at a much bigger venue here in L.A.

Lots of good stories were told by every member of the cast and by creator Andrew Marlowe and exec producer, Rob Bowman (X-Files). Stana's reaction when she found out for the first time that the 2nd Castle novel would be titled ""Naked Heat"" was priceless. Tom Bergeron was a great host/moderator, with his own story of being a guest murder victim on the show.

If you like Castle or know someone who does, order this DVD and show your support for the show and for The Paley Center. A friend of mine who attends Comic-Con in San Diego every year told me that getting anywhere near Nathan Fillion there is impossible but I was standing only a few feet from all the cast and producers as they came out after the panel, stopping for a moment for pictures and autographs for fans.",1290729600,71,1804,4.37910447761194
4329913,5,B004CYF7D0,"this dvd was recorded in march 2010, so it was probably the 1st one, Stana seemed to be a little bit shy which made her cutter than ever, it was really fun to watch, the rest of the cast were great ( as usual ), great entertainment. Thank you.",1448064000,,243,3.979591836734694

4329924,5,B004CYF7D0,"We know these people as the characters they portrait, so it is very nice to see them as themselves.  Nathan Fillion is even funnier than Richard Castle.",1428537600,,152,4.62962962962963

4329931,5,B004CYF7D0,Great to see the cast in this casual setting.  Even better to see this while watching season 7 as this special filmed during season 2.,1419379200,,134,4.36
4329932,5,B004CYF7D0,"I really enjoyed this ""inside"" look at the people both in front of and behind the scenes of this great television show.  Seeing them as they are makes me enjoy the show more.",1417564800,,174,4.2727272727272725

4329936,5,B004CYF7D0,"This video is a MUST Watch for any true Castle fans, it was interesting, hilarious, and insightful, and really allows fans to see the productive minds behind one of the greatest shows on television. Talk of everything from the fight scenes from the Blue Butterfly to the Richard Castle books, to future episodes, this video was definitely worth watching.",1413244800,,354,5.016949152542373

4329940,4,B004CYF7D0,"This is the first Paley Center for Media event featuring the cast of Castle. As a Castle Fan, I loved getting to know TV's best dramedy cast outside of character. Taped early in the run of the series the actors were somewhat unfamiliar with one another yet quite friendly. Its a nice introduction to the actors who at the time of this review are now in their seventh season.",1410393600,,374,4.434782608695652

4329944,1,B004CYF7D0,"We were expecting some conversations with the cast, anecdotes, insights, background. Gave up hope about quarter in as it never rose above a fanboy moderator giddly attempting to tease out secret spoilers of next season. Had the feeling of a phony publicity stunt and not a panel discussion. And what's with havnig the cast walk out one at a time to be seated and then clumsily fitted with microphones? We know them, that's why we're watching, It's the ""Paley Center,"" show a little technical expertise.",1402963200,,502,4.91764705882353
4329945,4,B004CYF7D0,"ALL involved with Castle should be proud for creating a perfect series.  Writing, direction and actors all make it happen , plus all the rest of the unseen staff.",1402012800,,162,4.586206896551724
4329946,5,B004CYF7D0,"Upon watching this for the first time, I can understand previous comments regarding sound and quality etc. It is a little disappointing that it is not more professional - especially since this is from a media centre!  True, it's maybe difficult to pick up some of the background banter but fun just the same.  Don't expect any more than it is - it's a chat with the cast where some members of the audience got to ask questions.  Don't expect any add ons or extras.  I'm doubtful about whether it's worth the money or not, but hey if you're a fan you'll want to see it no matter what any review says (am I right?).",1399852800,,613,4.304347826086956
4329947,3,B004CYF7D0,Stana seemed in left field poor posture and little attention others were somewhat involved Nathon was the one most involved,1398988800,,123,5.2

leads in a long, long time!",1388793600,,151,5.08
4329953,4,B004CYF7D0,They all seem just a little nervous being under the microscope... not all used to being in the spotlight.  The other show is more entertaining and fun to watch,1388534400,,159,4.482758620689655
4329954,4,B004CYF7D0,"As a fan I wanted to have this in my shelf, it's much better quality than catching the videos separately on YouTube, and there are some sweet moments during the fairly long event. However I doubt there is any interest from anyone except a hardcore Castle fan, and even entitling myself as one of them, I found the part where they act out a compilation of the script of the episode The Blue Butterfly to be a waste of time.",1388361600,,422,4.2875

4329957,5,B004CYF7D0,"this dvd met my expectations and beyound.
It was clear.
I had tried to see the Castle group on you tube but I missed so much.
this gave me everything.
I am so glad I ordered it and will order more from you.",1383868800,,206,3.813953488372093

4329959,5,B004CYF7D0,"As an uber fan of the show, I of course watched the hell out of this show.  The 2nd best of the 3 panel vids out there. Lots of fun hearing all the cast.  A must see for Castle Super fans (like myself!)

4329962,5,B004CYF7D0,"I love the inter actions between the cast and creator with the audience.  I would love to be able to buy their Comicons on dvd, but I don't think they are available. I love the show, and everything about Castle.",1376611200,,211,4.275

4329981,4,B004CYF7D0,"enjoyed the program but lost the last 20 minutes,( machine went offline and stopped running the show) but they gave some great information on what CASTLE is about and how the show is setup and why it is successful .",1372896000,,215,4.4

4329983,5,B004CYF7D0,Nothing makes me happier than spending moments with the cast of 'CASTLE'.  Cast seems to get along so well together and they must have a ball working together one set.  I know a lady that has worked as an extra on the set of 'CASTLE' and she too remarked on how well everyone gets along and have loads of fun together.  Imagine what a joy it must be to come to work each day.,1372032000,,375,4.04054054054054

4329985,3,B004CYF7D0,Nice to get acquainted with this amazing cast but maybe the session was too soon in light of the next several seasons that sent it into orbit.  An interesting introduction.,1370044800,,172,4.733333333333333
4329986,3,B004CYF7D0,The information in this documentary was interesting and good if you are a real fan of Castle. The unfortunate part is that the production quality is poor. And it was done after the second season so some of the cast members are now different. Fun to watch and see the cast as themselves rather than the shows characters.,1370044800,,319,4.517241379310345
4329987,4,B004CYF7D0,"It's a nice way to get to know the initiation of the series and how it came to be. A series of this nature is usually all about the lead stars, but I would have liked a little more from the supporting cast. There's a great chemistry among the players - I hope the next interview with the entire cast would highlight each one. All in all, however, this is a great insight into the series creation.",1369699200,,396,4.1558441558441555

It is fun to watch.",1369008000,,104,3.772727272727273
4329989,4,B004CYF7D0,"As a fan of the show ""Castle"", I was delighted to see the interview with the major cast members.  I enjoyed both their banter and their candid comments about their characters.  I am hoping that another opportunity will arise for an updated interview, since this one took place following season two, with the actors discussing the changes in their characters through season 5.  As ever, this is  a quality ensemble and I hope that the show continues for many years",1368835200,,463,4.75
4329990,3,B004CYF7D0,"It was nice to see them all but no one said anything of any intrest.  I had rather lukewarm interest in it
after about 15 minutes and, naturally, I haven't recommended it to others.",1368057600,,181,4.323529411764706
4329991,4,B004CYF7D0,"It was interesting to see and hear the cast of Castle.
The dialogue flowed freely and the audience asked perceptive questions.
The remarks from the creators added to the insight of this show.",1367625600,,191,4.818181818181818
4329992,3,B004CYF7D0,I am a big Castle fan and this Live interview session with the cast and crew was a neat switch from seeing the main characters on a talk show. One problem with having so many individuals from the show in one place being interviewed and taking questions from the audience is the fact that some cast and crew members get left behind. Good time with some interesting behind the scenes stories. The interview took place at the end of Season 2.,1367366400,,439,4.432098765432099
4329993,5,B004CYF7D0,It is a good peak on how the Castle stars interact with each other off camera. I really enjoyed it!,1365811200,,99,4.0
4329994,5,B004CYF7D0,"Was a great overview of the show through the second season. Only problem that I found is, now we are in the 5th season, and do not have more information about show, except that Kate and Rick are now a couple. I have noticed that there is more humor, and inter play between the 2 main characters. Would like to see in season 6, if the relationship goes further.",1365638400,,360,4.231884057971015
4329995,2,B004CYF7D0,"I think all Castle fans want to find out what the actors are like behind the scenes, but this kind of a venue does not really promote that type of exchange very well.  The actors are all sitting in chairs on a stage, which did not appear to be that comfortable. Answering off-the-cuff questions is a bit awkward and not that enlightening about what the actors are really like.  I would rather see a session where the actors, writer, and producer had the reins instead of the audience and were not lined up in chairs like puppets, so that they could just relax and improvise--maybe come up with their own way of showing us who they are.  I watched the whole video but for me it never really took off.  Moreover, while I often pay $1.99 to watch a two-hour movie on Amazon Instant Video, the same price for one that is under an hour and not really very entertaining seems like less than a bargain to me.  Overall, I would not recommend this to any of my friends that are major Castle fans like I am.  I love the show, but this was rather tedious to watch.  Actors are real people; they are not necessarily always ""on,"" and putting them in this kind of awkward situation does not bring out their natural exuberance or wit.  Even Nathan Fillion couldn't rescue it despite his megawatt charm.  Susan Sullivan told a cute anecdote that I enjoyed, but it was not enough to make up for the rest of the footage.  I would say go ahead and see it if you just can't pass up the chance, but be prepared that it isn't too scintillating.  I would rather spend my money buying Castle episodes, which I have already done, and I watch those over and over and enjoy them every time.  I imagine it was exciting for the people who were actually in the studio audience at the time this was shot and who had the opportunity to ask questions, but viewing it was sort of academic.  I think every actor on the show is far, FAR more interesting than this video made them out to be.",1364515200,2,1954,4.32054794520548
4329996,5,B004CYF7D0,"This is a very entertaining video with all the cast members, writer and director.  The cast looks like they enjoy each others company.",1363219200,,134,4.826086956521739

4330019,4,B004CYF7D0,"As a devout Firefly, Serenity, Dr. Horrible, Waitress fan, I like Nathan Fillion.  I could see him in anything....except that horror comedy Slither which I watched but didn't like the subject matter. Seeing him without a scrip and wisecracking and genuinely smiling in this Castle Q and A reveals that he is the real deal. Stana not so much.",1361145600,,341,4.779661016949152

I wish they would do another one.",1360713600,,187,4.875
4330021,4,B004CYF7D0,"A well-matched cast of characters, though ""Firefly"" had the best.
Nathan is the heart of this group. Didn't know Katic was so shy.
Input from producers and cast had substance,
explaining why the series is such a success",1360454400,,219,4.7894736842105265
4330022,5,B004CYF7D0,The cast of Castle are brilliant when they are all together because they embarrass each other or they tell the audience stories from behind the scenes which is good.,1359504000,,165,4.724137931034483
4330023,5,B004CYF7D0,"It was fun to see how the cast was so close even in the early stages of the show. The chemistry was wonderful between Molly Quinn  and Nathan Fillion. I was surprised to see how shy Stana Katic was then, she has grown into her role as a real star, since then. Interesting to hear all the back stories about casting the roles for the show.",1354492800,,338,4.121212121212121
4330024,2,B004CYF7D0,"Quality was terrible.  The video was hard to watch.  What kind of camera did they use?
It was waste of money.  Still love the castle series.",1340409600,2,140,4.3076923076923075
4330025,1,B004CYF7D0,"As a huge Castle fan, I was excited to purchase this dvd. After only seeing one negative review on the quality, I purchased the dvd. I should have listened! The show hurt my eyes from the beginning. The picture was grainy and distorted. It was better when they zoomed in for close-ups but otherwise, it is a truly terrible recording. Funny thing was, after the panel discussion was over, actors came on toting the virtues of the Paley Center and that quality was crystal clear!!!! Wish the dvd I paid $20 for was half as good. Very disappointing.",1332288000,23,546,4.581632653061225
4330026,1,B004CYF7D0,"Having seen tidbits of this panel online I was intrigued and wanted to see the whole thing, upon finding it available for purchase I was beyond thrilled, even though I didn't particularly care for the price tag. The panel didn't disappoint, but I was utterly appalled by the quality of the footage.

It was heavily pixilated and completely awkward to watch - I've seen home videos dating back to the 80's with better quality - so to be expected to pay 20$ for this and get such crap quality in return is utterly appalling to me.

I can only hope the contribution from me and others who have purchased this DVD will go towards updating the Paley Center's camera equipment so that future panels will be filmed on equipment dating from THIS century. Until that happens I will not be purchasing anymore DVDs from them - it's NOT worth the money.",1329523200,13,841,4.562913907284768
4330027,5,B004CYF7D0,This DVD is full of fun facts about the series and was filmed during the second series.  Well worth getting if you want to know how the series began.,1327968000,,149,4.137931034482759
4330028,5,B004CYF7D0,"Can't get enough of CASTLE? Even though there are Nikki Heat novels out there now? And even a Derrick Storm comic book? Well, how about an onstage panel discussion featuring the cast & creator of CASTLE, courtesy of the Paley Center for Media? This very entertaining talkfest took place on March 16, 2010, sometime around CASTLE's second season, and here's the roll call: actors Nathan Fillion, Stana Katic, Molly Quinn, Jon Huertas, Tamala Jones, Ruben Santiago-Hudson, Susan Sullivan, and Seamus Dever, with producer & series creator Andrew W. Marlowe and executive producer Rob Bowman. If you're not a fan of CASTLE, I don't know that you'll want to plonk down $19 for this DVD. But if you ARE a fan, oboy... For 55 minutes, these folks regale you with their good group chemistry and their behind the scenes anecdotes. Turns out, Nathan Fillion really is that impish. Stana Katic in real life is just as lovely (and a bit shy). Molly Quinn, she's adorable.

Tom Bergeron from DANCING WITH THE STARS makes for a consummate moderator (he also plays a corpse in the CASTLE episode ""The Late Shaft""). Bergeron effortlessly goes with the flow and is adept at asking insightful questions. He engages the panel for the first 14 minutes of the DVD and then turns the Q & A over to the audience (not that he ever does stop engaging the cast, but, as mentioned, he does it in the flow). I'm a big fan of CASTLE and so was very curious about the cast & crew's observations and responses to the questions posed them. That they answered them with humor and playfulness and with frankness and good detail only made me a bigger fan.

One of the funniest and most touching sequences concerns then 16-year-old Molly Quinn who talks about her real-life father-daughter relationship with Nathan Fillion, except first she hilariously shoots herself in the foot when describing her first impression of the first script: ""I thought the script was great... I thought it was good... but it was, you know, it was TV."" The reaction from the rest of the cast is priceless.

I really enjoyed the Stana Katic-oriented moments, Stana who may or may not have been trying to hide behind her hair. Naturally, there was gonna be mention of the show's primary engine, namely the tension between Castle and Beckett and the importance of milking that for as long as possible. At some point during this topic, Stana unexpectedly purrs: ""I think there's nothing sexier than swordplay."" (And then you need to check out Fillion's reaction). Later, Stana is asked to share her thoughts on her fans who call themselves the ""Stanatics."" Some time after that, to Stana's shock, Fillion breezily divulges some of the sly methods employed by the cast to memorize their lines. Fillion, straight-faced, pointedly mentions the folders which Stana seems to carry all the time.

Still, for my money, the best reveal is Fillion's smug confession: ""Castle twitters -- and he follows ME!""",1326499200,2,2936,4.842629482071713
