But that's what creators of the British TV show GOODNIGHT SWEETHEART did.

I have only seen the first couple seasons which were broadcast on my local PBS station. (Like many British TV series, there are about 6 to 10  episodes per season.)

I was won over by the funny and heart-felt moments, the acting, the constant references to America like some Shangri-La, and the guy's goofy exploitation of modern cultural icons -- eg, the man fibs to his 1940 girlfriend about his troubled marriage to Marilyn Monroe who had been involved with a couple oversexed brothers called the Kennedys. But, ultimately, it was winsome Dervla Kirwan, with her soulful brown eyes, as the barmaid married to a soldier at the front, who entrapped me.

Sadly, Dervla played the barmaid for only the first 3 of the 6 seasons. And, as his 1990s wife, brassy Michelle Holmes would too only appear in the first 3 seasons. However, Nicholas Lyndhurst as the conscious-stricken time-traveller would remain for the entire run.

The show's 6 seasons followed a strict timeline -- matching the 6 years from 1993 to 1999 in the modern setting to the war years 1940 to 1945.

While set among the working-class, the accents were generally understandable to me with very few exceptions.

What I've seen of this show was not quite perfect. Still it remains one of my favorite romantic comedy-dramas. So much so that I recently acquired thru Amazon.co. UK a Region 2 DVD of the 1st season of this show (I have a multi-region DVD player). I cannot testify to the VHS package of this show.",1165968000,3,1757,4.703583061889251
