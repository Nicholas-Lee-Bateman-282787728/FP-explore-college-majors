8082248,2,B000B66GVU,"A little while ago, I reviewed a movie by the name of Aussie Park Boyz, which I wasn't very kind to because it was only about as valuable as a home video made to watch during drinking parties with the director's friends and frat-houses.  This movie has basically the same technology, video that's around the quality of a camcorder and sound that you can't hear, but this movie at least has its charms.

First of all, it helps that, despite the really poor audio, I get snippets of the dialog.  Some of the dialog even is interesting!  The sound is really what ruins the film, though, as even though the imagery is very grainy and poor, the director of this feature seems to actually know how to move and use the camera.  In fact, having written, filmed, and edited it himself, I have to say that he has potential.  It's unrealized at this point, but it's there.

A defunct ""between-jobs"" man takes the place of a coach who's suspended, basically, for farting all the time, and he tries to lead the pitiful urban basketball team into the championship.  Along the way, he experiences the poor state of the local schools and becomes attracted to a fellow teacher who actually really cares about the education of the children.  Then the movie breaks every form of storytelling rules by making him give up and replacing him with the farting coach, who succeeds where the character we've been following for 45 minutes failed.  So really, I guess we're not supposed to care afterall.

Thus, this movie is certainly not the greatest, and it could have used a little more work, and man if these directors can get their stuff out on the video market, why can't they afford a good mic?  But I don't know, it's a simple and charming movie and if anything, I appreciate that the director really understood that he was working with poor-quality video and did what he could to make it interesting and make it work.  So it's not a complete loss.
