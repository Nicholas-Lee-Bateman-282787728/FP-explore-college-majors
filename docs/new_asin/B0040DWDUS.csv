8544810,4,B0040DWDUS,"ATTENTION 3D ENTHUSIASTS! This DVD does NOT require a SENSIO processor or special software to enjoy! While it can be viewed on a computer with software such as PowerDVD, it will play PERFECTLY on current 3D HDTV's such as my Mitsubishi DLP and other name brands without a problem. Tired of the red/blue paper glasses headaches? Looking for more great 3D material? Here's a classic, true 3D shutter glasses movie no 3-D movie collection should be without. Originally made for IMAX, it's a nostalgic matinee-style ""StarTrek"" type movie you saw as a kid, but still a 3D classic that you will certainly want to watch if you bought a new 3D HDTV. Brings back memories of Saturday afternoon matinees and popcorn. PLEASE NOTE: This DVD does NOT require a ""SENSIO"" processor as mentioned in  Amazon's description. ""SENSIO 3D"" is the trademark name for the company which holds the original patent on the now CURRENT 3D standard more commonly known as ""SIDE BY SIDE"" or sometimes known as ""Cross-Eyed"" 3-D format, where the horizontal resolution of the image is reduced by half in order to display both left eye and right eye images on a single frame. In fact, side-by-side is EXACTLY the same format used by DIRECTV to encode THEIR new 3-D channels. Today's DVD players, personal computers with programs such as PowerDVD, and current 3D HDTV's decode and play it without a problem. See my photos of screen-shots playing the DVD, using my SONY PS3, a Mitsubishi WD-82838 3D DLP HDTV with the 3D-A1 adapter. Simply select ""Side by Side"" mode, and you have TRUE sequential glasses 3D! No red/blue junk here. The DVD has some great 3D special effect such as roller coaster type rides which may nauseate those with weak stomachs, underwater fish, sharks and more. Perhaps not on par with the latest Disney 3D releases, but none-the-less, a true 3D collector's DVD. Certainly worth watching!",1288656000,,1876,4.8808777429467085
