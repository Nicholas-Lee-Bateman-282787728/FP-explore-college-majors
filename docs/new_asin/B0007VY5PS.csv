8052384,2,B0007VY5PS,"I can't believe that I had spent one Saturday evening watching this boring British comedy! I was expecting a Boudica-type rebel movie about how one woman stood against the invading Romans. Alas, all I got was to sit through an what seems like an awfully boring and crude comedy with thick accents about 3 village sisters who were united after the more humbler one was sent by her village to go rescue the red-dead warrior sis was captured by the Romans during a raid. The captured red-head sister was found and rescued through odd chances of luck. All ends well with the lucky young heroine drove the invading Romans out from a second invasion with her bee-power.

You can probably get the full synopsis at Bucketmovies dot com.

I'm giving the show 2 stars for the 2 scenes of the unnamed sexy brunette Goddess of Victory whom I don't recall even being mentioned in the credits.

8052385,1,B0007VY5PS,"I just want to say gladiatress is the only movie I went to see at the cinema that I have ever walked out of before the end, it was just that bad. I knew I was in for a bad movie when I was the only person in the cinema.

I normally enjoy british comdey but the jokes were just aweful and embarassingly bad, woeful acting, inane script. Don't even get the DVD.

I had to give this at least 1 star to post but it deserves 0",1191110400,,421,3.772727272727273
8052386,2,B0007VY5PS,"Being a minor fan of the tv series Smack The Pony I thought this movie might be worth watching, but the comedy here is sparser and less offbeat, mostly just in service of a conceptual plot which turns out to be remarkably dull. I guess the subject matter is intended to capitalize on the success of the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, which would be fine if they had any jokes or ideas to back it up, but this movie seems to be lacking both.",1142640000,,436,4.141176470588236
8052387,3,B0007VY5PS,"The other bloke summed up the plot well enough. So no point in me writing another one.

This movie might appeal to the fans of Mel Brooks or Monty Python. Tho, not quite as good as one of there films, still good for a zaney laugh or two.",1131494400,,237,3.9375
8052388,4,B0007VY5PS,"Essentially a buddy movie, this grubby but good take on the Roman invasion of England, three sisters shine. Or glow. Or look pretty hot under all that muck.

C'mon, the cover image is a picture worth a thousand words.

And speaking of worths...

Worthaboutapig is the downtrodden ""unlucky"" sister, forever optimistically bouncing about grateful for whatever falls in her path. The only think she is remotely prickly about is her status in the tribe, ergo, her name. With a slightly inane portrayl of the manically smiling character the actress does a great job.

Dwyfuc is the proud princess and on the prowl for a sperm donor. All of which is revealed within first few minutes of tape.
When Dwyfuc is captured in a Roman foray, Worthaboutapig finds herself sent to retrieve Dwyfuc, or die in the attempt.

After very little thought, she decides to seek the aid of her fiercesome older sister, a warrior more terrifying than any man.

Unfortunately between the two elder sisters a family feud made them bitter enemies.

How many more cliches can I squeeze into this review? Not as many as were in the movie, that's for sure.

But the thing is, it's a spoof, and as such, cliche is the fodder for the storyline. With a full folder of imaginative, incredible, and just downright silliness, Gladiatress entertains.

I happily compare it to two of my favorite lame but brilliant spoofs, Mel Brooks ""Men in Tights"" & ""the Princess Bride"" which are both universally adored (as well as reviled by equal numbers).

I had a great time watching this film.
