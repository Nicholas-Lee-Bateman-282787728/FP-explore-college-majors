5451060,5,B00AMHFODE,"It is hard to accept that Michael Jackson is gone. He could have had a longer, healthier career, but it was not meant to be. But, like the Beatles, he will live forever--there is no other way, really. His recorded and filmed music is there for us to enjoy until the end of time. One of such documents is the remarkable and engaging ""Michael Jackson Moscow Case 1993,"" a documentary directed by Egor Trubnikoff.

The film was put together with footage that Emmy Award nominee Yuri Burak shot during Michael Jackson's historical concert in Moscow, on September 15, 1993. It begins at the Red Square, with Jackson posing for the camera, with St. Basil's Cathedral on the background. He was on the way to the airport. The film then takes us to the days preceding the concert, and all the preparations that took place. For this purpose, the filmmakers interviewed some key personnel to the event, like Ruslan Miroshnick (producer and technical director) and promoter Ilya Bachvrin. Their accounts were aided by Sergey Chaplygin (office assistant), DJ Kate Kandalina, and music guru Art Troitsky. All of them bring their unique views and perspectives about the concert.

Michael Jackson's trip to the USRR coincided with big changes taking place in the region, with an incipient democracy providing for hard days. We are taken to the promoters' office five days before the concert, where we see the staff trying to organize what appeared to be a chaotic event. We are told that the tickets were expensive and only 10,000 of 55,000 seats were sold, and in the hours prior to the concert, some tickets were given away to the military to fill seats. Sadly, too, the presentation took place on a rainy, cold night. In addition, competing promoters tried to sabotage the event, by throwing cement in the air during the rain, to make it harder, and the media didn't help promoting it. Furthermore, paratroopers had to be brought, so that the stage could be built on time. The stage, due the rain, was flooded, and Jackson had to sing and dance while some assistants were constantly drying the floor with towels. Despite all, however, Jackson gave his 100% and the concert was a success, a historic event at that important, transitional time in Moscow.

""Michael Jackson Moscow Case 1993"" is document of our times. Even though the Russians were not prepared for such a show - it was apparently a first --, the promoters' vision prevailed and they made history. We see plenty of Jackson, in the days preceding and after the concert. It is a must have for any Michael Jackson fan. (2011, color, 60 min)

5451067,4,B00AMHFODE,"This is a Russian documentary (dubbed in English) about Michael Jacksons concert in Moscow in 1993 and the surrounding events. I actually first watched it online and I found it so fascinating that I bought it. I don't think it's everyone's cup of tea, but I like the fact it's not your usual pop/rock documentary. It's at least as much about Russia'93 as about Michael Jackson. It's more about West meets East than about anything else. I too grew up in an Eastern Block country, so maybe that's why I'm so fascinated with this aspect.

The documentary itself is pretty simple - basically Russian people (organizers, journalists, Russian pop stars, fans) talking about Jackson's 1993 visit, concert and the surrounding events. There is also some footage of Michael from that visit, but not very much. Also the documentary doesn't have Jackson's music in it - obviously because of legal reasons. It's not an official MJ release.

1993 was a time of big political, economical changes in poor and depressed Russia. This was around the time when the former Communist country started to open up for Western culture. Michael Jackson was a kind of mythical figure from that point of view, an almost surreal being. There was a certain kind of wonderment with that Russian people looked at him.

The concert itself was doomed from the very beginning for many reasons:

1) Russia was a very poor country at the time and there simply weren't many people who could afford buying tickets. It's said in the film that the cheapest ticket cost a full monthly salary of a person. Reflective of the poverty is also the fact that when soliders helped with the building of the stage, they did that just for food and cigarettes.

2) The concert was organized by basically amateurs. At the time there weren't yet professional concert promoters in Russia. They were just learing Western style concert promotion. They did not even know how to welcome a big superstar, how to behave with him etc.

3) There were certain forces (rivaling Russian ""promoters"", maybe certain political circles) which tried to sabotage the show. This included spreading rumours that the concert would be cancelled - actually this ""news"" even was published in Russia's most read newspaper at the time, but it was completely false -, or that it's not Jackson himself, but an impersonator who would perform. There were even attempts to artificially provoke rain for the time of the concert (ie. cloud seeding).

4) Whether it's because of that or not, but it eventually DID heavily rain during the concert. The organizers did not want to disappoint Jackson that they could not fill the stadium, so at the end they gave away tickets for free to the army. So most of the audience was made of soliders.

The organizers were worried that Jackson would cancel the show under those circumstances but he did not. Despite of the circumstances and the rain, the slippery stage and everything he did perform the show. But I guess if Jackson was a surreal figure to Russians at the time, Russia must have been just as surreal to him.

The highlight of the documentary to me was Michael's visit at an orphanage for handicapped children. That footage is a treasure. On the down side I have to mention one of the talking heads in the documentary called Art Trotsky. He is described as a ""music guru"" whatever that means. His commentary is just judgemental and narrow-minded and most of the time absolutely unnecessary and it doesn't add anything to the narrative of the story. For example, who cares that Trotsky thinks that Jackson died as a virgin? Or who cares about Trotsky's amateur psycho-analysis of Jackson? The guy was so full of himself, he was really annoying. Trotsky's comments are basically why I could not give 5 stars to this docu, despite of the fact I liked most of the film.",1373932800,12,3829,4.798179059180576
5451068,3,B00AMHFODE,"The video footage was interesting, though I thought there would be more to see. I wanted to see the footage of Michael in the black and silver jacket with the mirrored shades, at least I thought I would see something of that. I'm not sure, but I thought that was in Moscow where he made that video and was walking in front of hundreds of soldiers, looking beautiful and shiny in silver and black. I've always wanted to see more of that footage. Well, it's not on this DVD. This seems more like a home video that a fan made. There was full video footage that I had only seen clips of on TV and it was nice to see more of those scenes. Overall, I was happy to be able to see the video of him with the sick children and how nice people were to him, though on the video it says that the city didn't do enough to properly accommodate such a HUGE STAR and that more should have been done to advertise his visit there.",1367798400,5,911,4.094972067039106
5451069,4,B00AMHFODE,"This video lets the public see Michael's Humanitarian efforts and his concern for the welfare of disadvantaged children. It is a nice addition to anyone's library of information on Micheal and it shows what a kind person he truly was, which was often the very opposite of how the media attempted to portray him.",1366934400,2,311,4.777777777777778
5451070,5,B00AMHFODE,found this video interesting differerent people were telling what they exspirenced when Michael came to do his concert in Moscow and what happened to him while he was there  i belive any fan of Michael's would want this for there collection there also are clips of Michael,1366243200,,272,4.787234042553192
5451071,2,B00AMHFODE,Save your money.  Some of the history behind how unprepared the Russians were to stage Michael's concert is interesting but other than that one time through and I'll probably never watch it again.  There is no concert footage and minimal Michael footage.  I own dozens of MJ videos but this was lame.  I should have known when there was NO information available on Amazon's product description but as a huge MJ fan - hope springs eternal.  This time it was misplaced.,1365638400,8,467,4.716049382716049
