8756594,5,B01DPLS8ZO,"For the price, you can't really beat this collection.  ""Baba Yaga"" (Here called ""Devil Witch,"" though the cover of the blu-ray shows the original title) is a particularly interesting standout and is worth the price by itself.",1492560000,,225,5.081081081081081
8756595,4,B01DPLS8ZO,I already have several of Blue Underground's Blu-Rays.  This 3-pack of low budget Italian Giallo films are great to have.  From the Occult Baba Yaga to the Last House On The Left inspired Night Train Murders to the sexy Strip Naked for Your Killer.  These 3 films have something for the B-Rate movie buff,1490918400,,304,4.592592592592593
