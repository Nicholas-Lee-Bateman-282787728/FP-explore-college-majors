Since then I have done extensive reading on the Apaches and came to realise that the film did not really do the incident nor the Indians any great justice...However after reading about Mangas and Cochise in several books, the portrayal of Jeff Chandler in the nominal role of Cochise was most fitting. I hope that one day this film will be re released to the world. The film along with Broken Arrow opened up some of the tribal and religious issues which had never really been attempted in previous films dealing with the Indians.",1313452800,,648,4.594827586206897
8449106,5,B004Z0P73Q,"Cochise, .....ah for most of my life he has been my ideal.  And the Cochise whom I imagine is Jeff Chandler acting the part as if he were a Native American rather than a boy from Brooklyn. This movie was made after Broken Arrow. It is not as perfect a movie in any way.  But Jeff Chandler IS Cochise.  And that makes the movie better than it would otherwise be. Men will enjoy this movie for the ""action"".  But women may fall in love with the actor, Jeff Chandler, all the while thinking they are swooning for Cochise.",1308614400,2,518,4.255102040816326
