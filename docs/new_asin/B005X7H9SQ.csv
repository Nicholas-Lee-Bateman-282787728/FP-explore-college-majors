4902234,2,B005X7H9SQ,"I bought this DVD and after watching about 1 hour, was very disappointed. First the picture quality is not good at all. I was expecting an HD quality DVD but it is really not. Second, it bored me a lot. I was also expecting real footage of the Titanic but so far none of that. They just filmed old pictures and talked about them. So not interesting. I had to stop the DVD because I couldn't find anything interesting. Very very disappointed :(",1328313600,4,443,4.349397590361446
4902235,4,B005X7H9SQ,"Very informative documentary on the Titanic. Nice length at 4 hrs and 28 minutes! Most other Titanic documentaries clock in at 90 minutes max. I wish the producers would have spent a few extra bucks and close captioned the DVDs. Sometimes it's hard to understand what's being said. Other than this glaring omission, I'd definitely recommend this to a Titanic collector.",1327104000,37,369,5.065573770491803
4902236,5,B005X7H9SQ,"I wasn't sure what I was ordering, but I'm glad I did because I like surprise material I haven't seen before.  It should have been labeled ""The Definitive UK Documentary Collection + Bonus.""  They were filmed in the early 80's and 90's, and contain little tidbits of information that I find fascinating on an historical and personal level.  Its very nostalgic.

The first DVD is about 4 hours.  The first two programmes are somewhat repetitive, and a little sleepy, with interviews of survivor Eva Hart, but each have different information that is worth the watch.  The third is a brief history of Captain Smith.  The last programme ""End of an Era"" includes a short history of liners up to the tragedy.  I found this to be the most interesting of the four.  Also included is a show and tell of artifacts from a shop in England that deals primarily with ship collectables.

The second DVD is about 40 minutes of interviews of the survivors at a Titanic convention during the 71st anniversary giving their heart felt detailed accounts of the tragedy.  This is followed by a short 1912 nickelodeon film with footage of what is supposed to be Titanic, but on the previous DVD is revealed to be that of Olympic.

Although the transfer seems a tiny bit fuzzy to me, I'm sure its decent, but I'm used to high def.  I like the intro menu and the music it plays with the illustrations and retouched photo background.  Its nice to hear when getting up between programme breaks. This won't please everyone, but for the price it will please many liner buffs.  One's disappointments are only as great as one's expectations.",1326931200,79,1610,4.679715302491103

Disk 1: 1) Titanic Remembered, 2) The Story of Captain Smith and the Titanic, 3) Echoes of the Titanic, 4) End of an Era
Disk 2: Titanic Survivors

The documentaries all come from the same production company and offer none of the more recent reconstruction of the damage and sinking. I was hoping that a collection advertising itself as ""definitive"" would have included ""Birth of a Legend"".  At the time of purchase the listing did not specifically mention which documentaries were included but I expected a compilation of the more recent television broadcast productions. These are very dry and academic as if one was sitting in a history class. Somebody who takes a scholarly interest in historical minutiae however might be delighted.

To watch the last of an era die before your very eyes is a tragedy in itself.

Closed captioning helps me understand what is said. Especially when it comes to people I can't understand otherwise, such as the elderly Titanic survivor interviews? Closed Captioning makes it easier for the hard of hearing and the deaf.

The discussions from historians and survivors go on and on to the point of boredom. We're shown hundreds of old drawings, newspaper headlines, photos and illustrations of the Titanic while a slightly-out-of-tune ""Charlie Chaplin type"" music box tinkles maddeningly in the background. Within the first 45-minutes the only thing of interest to me was the photo and story of the pig.

It's as if somebody threw everything they knew about the Titanic into this DVD, but then failed to edit out all the useless unmemorable details. Do we really need to see how many newspaper publishers, in their haste to get out the news of the sinking, repeatedly printed the wrong information about the number of dead? This DVD shows us dozens of newspaper headlines, one after another. After that came the ""special addition"" newspapers that still got the information wrong.

It just isn't very good. There are plenty of other Titanic DVDs more respectful of our time.",1376956800,2,1050,5.028735632183908
4902284,3,B005X7H9SQ,"I didn't purchase this set on Amazon, but I do have it, so figured I'd give some input for future buyers:

First of all, these are EXCELLENT programs.. A lot of really cool information that I had never seen in other Titanic documentaries (and as a person whose researched the great liner since I was 5 (now 26)I've seen A LOT of Titanic documentaries, books, etc.

The problem lies in the dvds themselves. I saw another review mention they were a poor vhs to dvd dubbing job. While I don't know if this program was ever released on vhs, I can completely confirm the poor dvd dubbing. On mine Disk 1 part 4 would freeze up and crash my media player halfway through the program, other areas had little skips and whatnot in them. The second disk wouldn't play at all!

Angered I contacted the producer of the documentary and demanded a replacement which I got quite quickly. The replacement I watched through completely with a fine eye and its perfect, but be aware, you may have to go through the 'angry call for a replacement' when you order this product....

The 1 other nice thing I will say is that I bought the version of this that comes in the metal tin, and the tin is way cool!",1374883200,2,1183,4.3881278538812785

4902288,3,B005X7H9SQ,"This video collection was unfortunately not as promising as I had hoped. It was taken from a television documentary series and when put on disc,it was not edited,so therefore,there was quite a bit of repetition;same scenes played over again,same people giving same reviews. It would of been much better I believe if a lot of this excess which wasn't needed was cut out.",1366243200,3,369,4.873015873015873
4902294,5,B005X7H9SQ,"Although the DVD does not contains an 100 anniversay stuff. IT DOES contains Things taken at the 100th anniversay - like why the memorial is so important to so many, which wasn't taken as much before, in the media. In the year 2012 it was more evident than ever that the memorial is important. I feel those films in this DVD have emphasize on the importance of it. In that, the DVD has succed and did a great job!
Another thing - many  who saw it felt it's a bit tiresome to watch. But this is the British version of the disaster. Mind you - the workers of the Titanic was all British and the film taken in Biritan - it refelct that. For example my Irish penfriend has said in her county(Mayo) there was few Titanic fatalties. but 2 survivied. 3rd class passengers.
. The DVD contained MANY details on films Germany did on Titanic, and on a film done the same year Titanic sank. Those were thigns not many know of. They even say the names of those films and in soem cases who directed them. Than you can see the violin belongs to Titanic. You  can see Olympic's interior at the hotel. I haven't seen  it in many American documentaries of the Titanic, and I do have a few.

The DVD has a lot of details and nice interviews with young Titanic enthusiasts and a tour to places Titanic workers  saw before etc etc.. Again, it's a British Version. but, at least you see it from their point of view and that is a great contribution, to be able to look at it from their point of view. I love the DVD.

All of the documentary's were  clearly filmed for a UK audience and never intended for international release. And clearly never intended to be lumped into one large collection, as many of them share the same footage. So if you watch one after another you will see the same scenes over and over again. All the documentary's were shot in and around the 1980's and as such the information is VERY dated. There are some interesting bits of minutia, but nothing that justified the purchase unless you are a total Titanic junkie.

I was very disappointed with the poor dubbing from the VHS standard format. Even ignoring the standard formating, the coloration of the DVD's is VERY washed out, giving the video a old & dried out look. Not what I expected from a ""Definitive"" documentary at all. The fake velvet lining on the inside of the case also left a layer of fuzz on the data side of the DVD that had to be wiped out before playing, else it would have surely ruined my player.

Leave it to the Brits to give us something no one in this country thought to pull together: information on memorials erected, the fact that Captain Lord, of the ""Californian,"" was EXACTLY where he thought he was in relation to the ship (and could not have made it to the ""Titanic"" before the ""Carpathia"" even if he'd had a perfectly clear path), and even a sheet that shows the Morse dashes and dots for both CQD and SOS ... and explains the word each letter represents.

I was expecting some formal talk about how the sinking actually occured based on new found evidence at the wreck site such as the large section of the bottom hull.  There was none of that.  A Night to Remember is one of my favorite films and they do talk about that film.  However there is no mention of James Cameron's Titanic movie because this documentary was made BEFORE, some 10 to 15 years before, the movie came out.  It has nothing to do with the fact that this is a British documentary and the movie was an American release.  Overall I give it a 3 star rating because it is a nice set to have for a collection and some of the survivors talking about the incident is great considering that sadly all survivors are now deceased.  You can tell this was transfered from older video stock.  The price is well worth it but just don't expect to much.  This is an okay dvd but far from definitive.",1334707200,,1016,4.137755102040816

The 100th anniversary of the sinking has brought out a new wave of material.

This set had some mixed reviews and because it was so inexpensive, I leaped in and bought a set.  Although there are always new tidbits to hear about and a few new pictures to see, this set is the dryest of the dry in terms of Titanic documentaries.  I watched it and subsequently filed it away with others, likely never to watch it again.

As far as I am concerned, the gold standard Titanic documentary is the one done by A&E a number of years ago.  I had it on vhs and then bought it again on dvd.  I never tire of it.

I didn't think the story of the Titanic could ever be made so agonizingly boring, but this set proved me wrong. The only reason I gave it two stars was for the photos.

Yikes. First of all ,the negative comments given in reviews here are correct.  It IS from the same British production company. I thought the various catagories on Disc One seemed interesting and would be diverse, but, as one plays each category, a lot of footage from the previous one is there on the next. It is one boringly long disc.

They show LOTS of pictures of various Titanic period artwork, pictures of sheet music and era songs, etc., but it is all repetitive and a bit boring. All of the categories are on Disc One. Disc Two (the BONUS) contains interviews with survivors, which, I suppose, is good to have. Trouble is, they are mostly the same interviews, with a few differences, shown in bits on Disc One!  In all, the whole thing is kind of dull and a bit boring. Nothing ""Definitive"" and certainly no ""Collection"". They show (much too long) clips from early German films (of all things!) of Titanic, referenced the British made 1958 movie ""A Night to Remember"" and its producer William MacQuitty, discussing the proguction, and clips of the movie,which were good, mentioned ""Titanic"" the American made 1953 film briefly by showing some movie posters, but no mention was made of the 1997 blockbuster Titanic movie (maybe because it WAS an American, not British, blockbuster?) and of course no mention made of the documentaries of  recent dives to the site, although they showed the appalling Titanic traveling exhibition and interviews with Eaton and Haas, and the various items brought up to be displayed (for money).

 I firmly believe that this was grave-robbing, that the site should have been left untouched, and it left a bad taste in my mouth to see the ""show"" of the traveling exhibits.  I was wondering where in the world Ed Kamuda and the Titanic Historical Society were, one of the first Titanic societies established as Titanic Enthusiasts of America in 1963. I have been a member of that organization for many years. Mr. Kamuda should have been included and interviewed, as well as Bob Ballard. Both of them are true historians intent on preserving the memory of Titanic, and were adamant and vehement about not disturbing the wreck. Oh well. As I already have a sizable library accrued over many years on Titanic, and this is the centennial year, I am adding it to my collection. It is a shame, though, that this ""Definitive Documentary Collection"" could not have been a real ""collection"" video  to pay tribute to this centennial of the horrendous tragedy, not just a fast knock-off to cash in on it.",1333152000,,2680,4.758620689655173
4902313,5,B005X7H9SQ,"I suppose of all the things written about the Titanic, this one DVD tells the story as best it can. It follows all the important information from first sailing on April 10 1912 to the sinking four days later. It also has an excellent commentary from survivors of the sinking.  They go into great detail of exactly what happened to them. I myself, can only imagine what they all went through. I have been on several ships of all sizes and can say it is a great adventure.  To be on a maiden voyage is even better. I have been on three such voyage's. Anyway, if you are at all interested in the Titanic as I am, then get this DVD. You will not be disapointed.",1332460800,11,657,4.2063492063492065
8488317,5,B005X7H9SQ,"The interest in the Titanic was sparked hugely by the success of James Cameron's film, ""Titanic."" This DVD was compiled after the film to include clippings and interviews with survivors. The Legend of the Titanic includes five Titanic documentaries such as ""Echoes of the Titanic;"" ""Titanic Remembered;"" ""The Story of Captain Smith and the Titanic;"" ""End of an Era"" and the bonus documentary ""Titanic Survivors"" with rare footage of the original ship including Captain E.J. Smith.

The four hours of Titanic included interviews with Eva Hart MBE who was a child aboard the ship on its maiden voyage. Her mother had a terrible premonition about going aboard the Titanic. She spent her days sleeping and nights awake waiting for the disaster. Eva recalls her mother begging her husband, Benjamin, not to board the ship one last time. The story of Titanic seemed doomed from the beginning. The documentary examines Wallace Hartley, the ship's musician, and visit his grave in Colne, Lancashire, England. The documentary about Captain E.J. Smith brought us to his birthplace and to his memorial.

If you're a Titanic enthusiast, you will be enthralled with this two DVD set and want more. The Titanic was built to be unsinkable and then on the mid-April night was brought down by a drifting iceberg. There were warnings about icebergs and worse not enough lifeboats to save them all. As the survivors recall the screaming followed by the silence afterwards. Over 1500 lives were lost, 700 lives were saved. There are no living survivors now more than a hundred years later.",1520640000,,1569,5.030769230769231

8488324,4,B005X7H9SQ,"Mill Creek has put together 5 documentary style programs all about the TITANIC. They are well done in my opinion with the quality being of vintage material, black and white with some color.
Disc 1 ~
* ECHOES OF TITANIC
* TITANIC REMEMBERED
* THE STORY OF CAPTAIN SMITH AND THE TITANIC
* TITANIC, END OF AN ERA
Disc 2 ~
* SURVIVORS (This is a really good one, mostly focusing on the survivors of that fateful night on April 14, 1912.)
It's good, but I wouldn't expect UHD 4K quality with this set. I know most of us, by now, are getting used to UHD quality on the TVs. The quality was fairly decent for DVD and the time it was initially shot, which I believe was in the '80s to early '90s, primarily on the anniversaries.
I don't believe there are any survivor's alive now as of 2017.",1488412800,,783,4.226666666666667

Instead many thousands of people died and for  no reason than carelessness. Acting is very very well done. Music is so sweet.,1486857600,3,259,4.354166666666667
