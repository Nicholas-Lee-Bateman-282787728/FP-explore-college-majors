2456652,1,B000CCD0GM,I was really disappointed. There must be more and better AB/SNL material to choose from. One very funny sketch (recording the outgoing message) and the rest range from fair to just lame. Next time I'll read the reviews and details more closely.,1419206400,,244,4.833333333333333

2456657,5,B000CCD0GM,Our family was headed off to a summer reunion vacation and I bought a bunch of these SNL classics for down time at the beach.  Well they were a total hit because young nieces and nephews and older family members were howling at the SNL comedy.  These were great vacation entertainment.,1390262400,,285,4.568627450980392
2456658,4,B000CCD0GM,"Along with Steve Martin, Christopher Walken, Tom Hanks and John Goodman (the latter of whom has inexplicably not received his own 'Best of' special as of this date), Alec Baldwin is part of a handful of frequent ""Saturday Night Live"" hosts frequently asked back at any given time, thanks to his chemistry with the (ever changing) cast and crew, his easiness to work with, and his talent and versatility. Over the years, Baldwin's many appearances have resulted in some of ""SNL's"" most memorable and hilarious sketches.

""The Best of Alec Baldwin"" doesn't quite scratch the surface of Baldwin's contributions to the show, but contains most if not all of his most memorable sketches. Some of the sketches, such as the unforgettable ""Schweddy Balls"" and the borderline disturbing (but still very funny) ""Canteen Boy and the Scoutmaster,"" have already been on three or four previous ""Best Of"" dvds, but they still hold up on repeated viewings, and deserve to be included because they perfectly exemplify Baldwin's talent and his willingness to do anything for a laugh. Other classics include an uproarious send-up of Tony Bennett (Chris Kataan almost steals this one from him, though), a dead-on Robert De Niro abusing celebrity guests alongside Joe Pesci (Jim Bruer), the brilliant ""French Teacher"" who obnoxiously tests his students until they match his overly enthusiastic inflections, and the hapless gubernatorial candidate who unleashes an escalating series of events that bring him unprecedented hatred, beginning with the killing of Lassie. Some underrated gems such as ""Soap Opera Digest"" (a simple premise that Baldwin executes wonderfully) and ""Mickey Ross's Pyramid of Pain"" also make it on here and are welcome additions.

As with all ""SNL"" best-of's, a few duds found their way onto here, and some truly worthy stuff got left off. Of the weaker sketches here, I didn't enjoy the cold opening with the Prince Charles jokes, which is an example of a one joke premise that cannot sustain itself for a full sketch. The sketch in the Chinese POW camp towards the end also isn't particularly amusing. How either of these was put on here over ""The Mimic,"" (really, Baldwin's entire 1993 episode alone could be his 'best of') is baffling. Also, the bonus sketches leave much to be desired, although Baldwin's commentary is very entertaining.

""The Best of Alec Baldwin"" isn't perfect, but is a worthy addition for ""SNL"" fans.",1383177600,,2427,5.10831234256927
2456659,2,B000CCD0GM,"I'm a BIG fan of Alec Baldwin, think he (along with Christopher Walken) was the best host ever of SNL.  I found his skits absolutely hilarious when I watched them live.  In my case I haven't seen many repeats.  When I found this DVD, I thought, wouldn't it be great to see those marvelous skits again.

For me, they didn't stand up to repeat viewing, in other words, surprise was a big element in the comic experience.  Although it is still plain how VERY talented and versatile Baldwin is, how clever the skits are, I didn't find many of them funny, the second time around.  I'm not sure why, everybody's different of course.  In my case, I've seen This is Spinal Tap, A Mighty Wind, The Bird Cage, The Wedding Singer, A New Leaf, and certain other movies dozens of times and found them funny, even funnier, each time.  Ditto with certain shows/skits/bits- Taxi, Carol Burnett, In Living Color, Seinfeld, Roseanne, the King of Queens, the Big Bang Theory, etc.

NOTE: SPOILERS FOLLOW [In fact, I talk about how these spoilers ruin the comic effect, so...]  Upon reflection, it might be that most of Baldwin's skits here involve slightly shocking, ""randy"" elements, for example, the one about Prince Charles being gay, the one about the would-be child molesting scoutmaster, etc.  I conclude that the initial surprise over that which was VERY close to the bone, fueled the humor, and didn't work (for me anyway) the second time around, absent that element of surprise.

I wasn't analytical while watching the DVD, just watched it.  But in retrospect I realize, that how funny I found each skit did tend to be related to how dirty (initially surprising) they were.  For example, I enjoyed the Tony Bennett sketch the most, the Prince Charles and scoutmaster ones the least.

But that's just me.  Humor is a very individual thing, others loved it.  I offer this to those who may have similar sensibilities.  I won't be watching this again, and wish I hadn't spent the money (although I did learn something about myself, so... maybe it was a wash).",1380326400,,2045,4.728813559322034
2456660,5,B000CCD0GM,"The Alec Baldwin compilation of his gigs as SNL guest host is absolutely the best of all the guest host DVDs.  Yes, it has Canteen Boy. Yes, it has Schweaty Balls. My absolute favorite is of him as a French teacher. He takes his skits seriously and immerses himself into each character, no matter how silly or uncomfortable.  We know Alec for his machismo in handling Papparazzi but he seems to be a genuinely nice guy and very talented actor as evident by his commitment to these skits. Whether a Southern drawl, effeminate lisp, French accent, DeNiro impersonator -- he is pitch perfect.

You will really like this -- but watch out, Alec! Justin Timberlake is about to pass you up in the #1 spot of best SNL guest hosts!",1379289600,,722,4.538461538461538

2456672,5,B000CCD0GM,Alec Baldwin is so funny...turn this on when you really need a belly-laugh.  He's really talented and it's an inexpensive way to crack up.,1374019200,,138,4.75
2456673,2,B000CCD0GM,I used to be a fan of Saturday nite live but have since stopped wathing because the show has become stupid. I do not recommend this cd.  Highly recommend seller.,1359158400,,161,4.366666666666666
2456674,3,B000CCD0GM,"I was disappointed that a lot of what I considered ""Best Of"" wasn't there.

2456676,5,B000CCD0GM,"Alec Baldwin can do everything,from Charles Nelson Ryley to Tony Bennet,and the Season Greatings skit is a classic,but the show that tears me up is the voice mail scene. This DVD cheers me up everytime I'm sad.",1295136000,,210,4.702702702702703
2456677,3,B000CCD0GM,"I have been showing ""The French Teacher"" to my high school classes for over a decade.  They LOVE it!  So, when I saw this was the only way to get the DVD copy I purchased it.  He has totally captured Robert de Niro's essence.  Other gems include the candidate for governor, the gay phone message maker, and the marine captured in China.  Seeing the old gang makes this DVD fun to watch.",1285545600,,386,4.305555555555555
2456678,5,B000CCD0GM,This is my favorite DVD to watch when I need a little pick me up. Cherry picks some of Baldwins greatest moments. God that dude used to be thin.,1279152000,,144,4.0

2456680,5,B000CCD0GM,"My husband was not a regular viewer of SNL, so I wanted him to see some of Baldwin's best work.  We were very pleased with the selections on the DVD.  However, I had hoped to see one of the skits where he portrayed a vamapire and would ""float"" into the dining room of a spooky old castle.  It was a hilarious skit that he played wonderfully.",1266364800,,341,4.136363636363637
2456691,5,B000CCD0GM,"Underneath the cool, handsome leading man exterior of Alec Baldwin lies a true comedy performer. It should be no surprise that Baldwin is one of the most talented & longest-running hosts of SNL (tied with Steve Martin for the number of times hosted). He's practically an additional cast member, because he can do so many things & be genuinely funny at them.
This collection is packed with great Baldwin moments: The hysterical cold opening of marathon gay jokes about Prince Charles; ""Green Hilly"", a hokey sendup of high-class drama & romance; his off-color impersonation of Tony Bennett; his wacky impersonation of the late Charles Nelson Reilly (Baldwin gets a run for his money here against Will Ferrell's weirdly funny James Lipton); the bully of a diet motivational guru; and the scandalous Canteen Boy sketch, with Baldwin as a randy scoutmaster.
The moment that I felt was so-so was the opening monologue with Baldwin tossing money to everyone backstage (THIS deserves to be in the collection?? Probably because it features Lorne Michaels & Paul McCartney at the end).
Definitely one of the best from the SNL collections!",1261094400,,1129,5.075268817204301
2456692,3,B000CCD0GM,"At last, SNL's most consistently funny performer, Alec Baldwin, has a DVD of his past performances.  Most of his best skits are here: the prissy French teacher, the soap opera star, the hapless gubernatorial candidate, and many others.  There's less filler here than on other SNL collections. My only complaint is that his silliest skit - ""The Mimic - is missing. Nevertheless, I think that this DVD is worth watching.",1243123200,,418,4.957142857142857
2456693,2,B000CCD0GM,"I bought this dvd solely for the skit called ""Francais,"" about the obnoxious French teacher.  That is one of the funniest skits imaginable.  The rest are so-so.",1238112000,,160,4.888888888888889

2456696,5,B000CCD0GM,"Many of these skits are gay-themed in one way or another--be forewarned if that type of humor offends you.  If it doesn't, the entire DVD, with one exception, is a riot. The exception:  I found the Canteen Boy/Scoutmaster skit disturbing and creepy and far from funny.",1221696000,,268,4.804347826086956

2456698,3,B000CCD0GM,"What's not to like about Alec Baldwin?  I hunted this dvd down after seeing a couple of old SNL episodes with him in them, specifically, The French Teacher skit and the cooking show with Pete Schweddy (and his schweddy balls!)  Not all the skits are that funny to me, but these two have me laughing to tears, so it's worth it.  (I just play the same ones over and over!)",1216080000,,370,4.257142857142857
2456699,5,B000CCD0GM,"Great DVD to add to your probably growing collection of SNL ""Best of..."". Baldwin is one of the best and funniest guest hosts they ever had - nearly every sketch is a ""classic"" and as funny as you remember it (think ""Pete Schweady"").",1199836800,,233,4.441860465116279
2456700,5,B000CCD0GM,"There are so many hillarious sketches here and they are a testament to the range of this extraordinary actor.  Almost every sketch is superb; the funniest of them, for me, was the Tony Bennett Show piece.  I have shared it with several friends and all have been similarly blown away by how brilliant his performance is.  I could watch an hour of Baldwin being Bennett...it just works!",1198627200,,384,4.701492537313433
2456711,4,B000CCD0GM,"4.5 stars

This is worth it just to watch Baldwin as Tony Bennett singing I Like Things That Are Great. I've seen it a dozen times and it just keeps getting better. Baldwin gets deeper into his characters than most hosts (he is indeed a good actor), and tends to rely less on cue cards than even much of the cast, which lets him really be the character (hello, cast of snl: learn a line or two; you've only got a few dozen a week!). Best of all, Baldwin is always willing to laugh at himself and his public personas, and goes the extra mile to get the laugh most every time.

  Schwetty Balls is still funny, as is Greenhilly (Jan Hooks shines here, as does Hartman, as always), and the Pesci skit has some nice bits. Not all of this dvd is great, but most of it is. Interesting that Baldwin did so many poofy characters, and they're all pretty funny. Canteen Boy is almost too much, but Sandler somehow keeps it light.

  I hope Baldwin rolls with the answering machine scandal; still waiting for it to come up next time he hosts. That would be ballsy.",1190505600,,1053,4.287878787878788
2456712,5,B000CCD0GM,"This DVD is HILARIOUS with the Canteen Boy skit, and the skit where Alec Baldwin is Charles Nelson Riley is priceless and there are so many more.

This is a must own DVD.  You will not be disappointed.",1181865600,,201,4.2631578947368425
2456713,4,B000CCD0GM,"Really funny skits that are not dated, as many SNL skits become. A. Baldwin is a truly talented man.",1168992000,,100,4.315789473684211
2456714,5,B000CCD0GM,"This was hilarious. I enjoyed every sketch. Truly, Alec Baldwin is an unofficial cast member.",1163030400,,93,5.266666666666667
2456715,5,B000CCD0GM,"I remember Alec Baldwin's first SNL show very fondly, which included Greenhilly. Easily one of his funniest skits ever, I was extremely pleased when I saw it was the first skit on his best of DVD. Alec needs at least 2 DVDs of his own to really capture it all, but Greenhilly, the skit where he's a stranger blowing through a diner and it's almost all in innuendo, Schwetty Balls and one of the priceless Bill Brasky skits makes it more than worth the money right there. His impersonations are great. The writers love playing with his leading-man good looks to comedic advantage. And while I'm a fan of Fallon and Ferrell (and the Carol Burnett show) when they break character to laugh, I laugh just as hard because Baldwin *never* breaks character when he's got every right to.

I've only seen about 7-8 of the SNL best of's, but Alec's is by far the best of them all. There's a good reason that this is the hardest SNL DVD to find.",1143331200,,933,4.424418604651163
2456716,4,B000CCD0GM,"There is no more manly man, chiseled of jaw and steely of glance, than Alec Baldwin at his peak. This DVD is thus a double delight: we see him act well and handsomely in these sketches, and we get to watch him, time and again, play against type. There is a fair amount of homo-humor (Alec as the British prince's press secretary using every possible elaborate metaphor for buggery in a skit that Baldwin co-wrote; Alec as a predator to Adam Sandler's Canteen Boy), and a fair amount of silliness (Alec as an exacting high school french teacher, a PG-rated skit, has been a favorite of my family's since it aired). Alec hawking Pete Schwette's Balls on NPR is probably the best known skit ever to challenge the SNL actors to maintain their composure, and he pulls it off. The only Baldwin masterpiece not on the DVD is Alec as ""The Mimic,"" another utterly silly piece that should not have been omitted. The DVD follows the typical format of others in this series and indeed of the show itself, beginning with a vintage monologue before moving into skits. Baldwin's excellent preparation (you never see him glance at cue cards), his swooning masculinity, and his penchant for the goofiest material that never causes him to break character make this DVD special in the Saturday Night Live retro series.",1141257600,,1299,4.726872246696035
2456717,5,B000CCD0GM,"Considering that the SNL 'Best of' DVD's can often be very hit or miss with their selections, the majority of the selected sketches on the Baldwin DVD are indeed very funny.  As someone who has hosted the show so many times over the years, there is a lot of solid material to choose from.  Some highlights include one where he gets a promotion at his job, but is unable to record a voicemail without it sounding less than manly when he does the playback.  A zinger vs. burn skit between him and Seth Meyers is a riot, and it ends with a 'Bill Braksy' bar scene that also features Will Farrell and John Goodman that is absolutely hysterical.  While there are a few sketches that are not quite as good and you'll probably want to skip over once you've seen them, the majority of the material on this DVD makes it well worth buying for any SNL fan.",1138838400,,845,4.329113924050633
2456718,5,B000CCD0GM,"Alec Baldwin has always been the best host of SNL (along with Walken and Spacey) and this makes a pretty good case why.

The opening sketch with the press conference about Prince Charles is priceless.  And what could be more demented than ""Canteen Boy.""  Baldwin is so over-the-top in that that what is a really, really sick joke is actually funny.

But the home runs come with three of the funniest sketches of all time: The Tony Bennet Show (I was seizing during this one), The Joe Pesci Show (with Baldwin doing DeNiro) and the ""Zinger"" sketch, which just got funnier as it went along.  Even better was the voicemail sketch where he keep re-recording his greeting, only to listen back to it and hear a gay man.

There are a couple of clunkers: ""Planet Truth"" was just not that funny and maybe two others didn't need to be here.  Including one so-so opening monologue that probably was only included because it included Paul McCartney.

The bonus features include one great sketch that never made it on-air, and a great audio track by Baldwin and the Producer of SNL which provides lots of really, really entertaining stories about the cast and the sketches themselves.

Absolutely hilarious.",1138579200,,1194,4.757281553398058
2456719,5,B000CCD0GM,"Alec Baldwin is tied with John Goodman for the second highest appearing host of all time.  So it's only natural that he now has a best of DVD.  This is not the best SNL DVD, but it is still a VERY good one.  If you already have the best of Dana Carvey, Mike Myers, Steve Martin, and Tom Hanks... get this one next.  This DVD has a couple of not-so-good skits, but it makes up for every one.  There are a lot of hilarious skits on the DVD.  I'm not going to list them, but just trust me.  Anyone who gives this less than four stars is OUT OF THEIR MIND.  When I first saw that the Best of Alec Baldwin was out I didn;t have to give it a second thought.
