7813975,4,6301589416,"Never heard of Kay Kyser, - He was a band leader, Radio, Film and Early TV comedian and actor. (The College of Musical Knowledge) The subject matter is dated, however it's good CLEAN entertainment that you don't have to cover your kids eyes and ears or stay up late to watch it.  If you like clean comedy, swing music and are a fan of nostalgia. Get this VHS or DVD, what ever you can find, sit back and see what was happening in the 30's and 40's.  This one is especially aimed at war time troop entertainment.  Like I said, sit back, watch it and enjoy the personalities and comedy and MUSIC!!  Thanks, Amazon.com, and if you really love us, you'll try to locate the 5 movies that aren't in print.",1255132800,2,699,4.312977099236641
7813976,4,6301589416,"This was the fifth and final RKO film for bandleader Kay Kyser. After a very successful run he went to MGM, who released the pretty bad film SWING FEVER. After that he went to Columbia, who did even worse with him on CAROLINA BLUES. But the first 5 RKO entries are fun to watch, particularly if you're a fan of big band/swing  music and/or radio shows of that era. There's a lot of corny humor, which was big in those days.

In this, Kyser and band (w/ vocalists Harry Babbitt, Ish Kabibble, Sully Mason and new singer Georgia Carroll-later to become Mrs. Kyser) are seen performing in several countries to bring music and silliness to our service personnel during WW2. A great undiscovered swing tune, ROODLE-EE-DOO lifts one's spirits, as does the comic song, I'VE GOT A SECRET WEAPON, featuring Harry Babbitt's 'Little Audrey' falsetto voice, along w/ several cartoon character impersonations. Babbitt and Carroll duet beautifully on CANDLELIGHT AND WINE and Mischa Auer provides comic relief. Marcy McGuire is a teenage spitfire and kind of a female Andy Hardy type. The surprise ending is effective, too. Catch this with the previous 4 Kyser films- THAT'S RIGHT, YOU'RE WRONG, YOU'LL FIND OUT, PLAYMATES, and MY FAVORITE SPY (NOT the Bob Hope movie of the same name)and have a Kyser weekend! C'mon chillen-Yess Dance!",1113955200,3,1322,4.923766816143497
