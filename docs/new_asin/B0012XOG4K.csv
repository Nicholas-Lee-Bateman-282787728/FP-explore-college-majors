8248141,1,B0012XOG4K,"This DVD, although hosted by an expert, is so badly produced and written as to make it mostly a waste of time.  He sits in front of the camera and rambles on and on about various subjects (which have nothing to do with FCP and the HVX200) until he FINALLY starts showing you how to get footage from the P2 into FCP about an hour into the DVD.

Don't waste your money on this information that could be easily found online or in the HVX200 manual.",1217116800,3,445,4.162790697674419
