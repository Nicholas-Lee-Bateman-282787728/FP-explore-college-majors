It's like the director became confused about what sort of movie he was making. It is episodic, which is fine, but the episodes go by without real impact, as if the photography or the general theme, or something shocking, is supposed to carry the weight of the story or character development. What story? Whose?  What development?  At times it veers in the direction of fantasy, then veers back into what is supposed to be realism. Most scenes are just thrown away to get on to the next.  Situations are resolved with a cut. It's a mess, and the ending is ridiculous: is the director going for symbolism, realism, some message, what? I suspect that people who like this film bring more to it than they get from it. (Then again, I probably do that with Tarkovsky.) Given all the glowing reviews here, if you watch it, there is a decent chance you may like it, or not dislike it, for  one reason or another---the actors if nothing else. You will just need to suspend more disbelief, or critical perception, than I thought this movie deserved.",1535587200,,1185,4.5754716981132075
8765560,5,B01HJ6R77G,"This DVD movie was produced in countries of Georgia and Germany.  It had a twofold value.  First of all the contents
were proliferated with the Georgian culture and gave views of the countryside and the people of all ages.  It was most
enlightening to see a Dictatorship and the consequences presented by Mohsen Makhmalbaf.  One of the true-to-life portrayals was how the Military carried out the draconian rule of the Dictator, but in the alternative pursued the massacre of the former Dictator's supporters and the Dictator himself?!  Very well done and worth a five star rating.",1534377600,,581,5.010416666666667

8765562,5,B01HJ6R77G,Makhmalbaf is at his finest and weaves a story of regret over the abuse of power in masterful yet subtle strokes.,1512777600,,113,4.428571428571429
8765563,5,B01HJ6R77G,"Set in a non existent country we meet El Presidente, or your Majesty as he likes to be called. He is a nasty, self obsessed man who has surrounded himself with the trappings of any self respecting tyrant. His children are spoilt, he out corrupts the most corrupt and most of his fawning subjects hate his twisted guts.

Then the people just crack over his latest outrage and a revolution kicks off; as he has been detached from reality for so long he is unaware quite how bad things are and elects to stay to sort out the kerfuffle. His grandson  a mere boy- also wants to stay with him, and grandpops relents. Soon they are on their own and having to survive by their wits.

Now this is a film made in Georgian and the sub titles could have been better, but it has a momentum right from the start that just grips you and makes you want to go for the ride. The performances are excellent, the action sequences realistic and often brutal. The fi.th and detritus that we see as the plot unfolds can be quite moving too. Add to al of that a very humanist story and you get a well made, conceived and presented original piece of cinema.

The fact that this is a fictional country means, that it is not penned in by the constraints of history and so is free to concentrate on the human side of the story. This also means that we avoid political dogma and just see what extremism can do to people. Well worth a punt even if you are half curious as I strongly feel you will not be disappointed.",1491955200,,1487,4.26241134751773
8765564,4,B01HJ6R77G,"This 2014 film is just being released on DVD in the US from Corinth Films. It is co-production of Georgia (former part of the Soviet Union, not the US state), France, and Germany. The language is Georgian and  to make it more international  the director is from Iran! As the words (in English) say at the beginning this film takes place in Some Country We learn quickly that the President is a Dictator who lives in the Palace with his daughter and son-in-law and their two young children.  Within the first five minutes there is a coup and the President is overthrown. He sends his family away  all except for his grandson (Im guessing he is 8 years old, though we are not told). He then must hide (along with the Grandson) to stay alive.
I don't like spoilers (I point that out in all my Amazon reviews) but I haven't given away any info you won't learn in the first 5 minutes of this 115-minute film. Ill leave you to discover the rest for yourself.

The film is supposed to be a satire of Dictators but I found nothing to even remotely laugh it.  There is LOTS of graphic violence here. The ending will leave some satisfied and others not. Its that kind of film. It was filmed in Georgia with a huge group of extras. The two leads (the President and his grandson  I cant remember the young actors name) are both excellent. How the young boy remembers that much dialogue still amazes me.

The film won a lot of film festival awards including the best film at the Chicago International Film Festival in 2015.

The DVD has English subtitles which are generally easy to read. It has four bonus features. Two are deleted scenes, one is the theatrical trailer and the last is a 20-minute Making of The President featurette. Usually these Making of extras feature the cast and the production team being interviewed. Not this time. This is literally footage of the director instructing his Cast and extras in major scenes. He speaks in English and has a translator to turn it in to Georgian. There are no English subtitles here so you only hear the Directors words in English. And none of the cast members are identified with captions. Its sort of interesting, but no essential.

The DVD will not be released until September 27, 2016 but I was provided with an advance screening copy in exchange for an impartial and honest review.

Ive reviewed two other Corinth Films in the last two weeks. While I liked this film, I did not lovbe it as I did the others. But everything cant get five stars. It is worth checking out though.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
