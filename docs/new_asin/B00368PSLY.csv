4075175,3,B00368PSLY,I enjoyed this movie; it kept me on the edge of my seat and the twist at the end was neat.,1282003200,2,90,3.3333333333333335
4075176,2,B00368PSLY,"There was something satisfying about the way the main character kept offing those who had killed his heart donor. But most of the time it was difficult to figure the story, and we were painfully aware that all the actors (but most particularly the female doctor who was the love interest), kept swallowing their words so that none of us could hear what was said. Regarding the confusing plot, one of the people with whom I was watching is a cardiologist - well, all of us are certified to be quite intelligent and experienced watchers of art flicks.... I think by the end we understood where the story was headed but were definitely underwhelmed.

BTW, this Blu-ray DVD apparently lacks subtitles. We looked for those, as they might have helped us understand the mumbled lines.",1276905600,,777,4.7555555555555555
4075177,5,B00368PSLY,"I knew that Tell Tale wouldn't be a remake of the Poe classic, but I certainly wasn't disappointed in this film. I thought I had the ending figured out, but was fooled! (Glad it ended the way it did).

I always enjoy watching Josh Lucas work, this was another nice performance. (He always looks so worried!) The other actors in the film were quite good. My only complaint is that there was absolutely NO reason to have use of the tobacco drug in the film. C'mon, no decent restaurant allows smoking. (When will the filmmakers learn!)",1271635200,4,533,4.552083333333333
4075178,3,B00368PSLY,"Let me first make something clear: ""Tell Tale"" actually has nothing to do with ""The Tell-Tale Heart"" by Edgar Allan Poe.  In Poe's short story, a murderer is haunted by the sounds of his victim's beating heart.  In the film, the recipient of a heart transplant shares a supernatural connection with his deceased donor, and seeks to unravel the mystery of his murder.  The film only emphasizes the heartbeat when single father Terry sees someone that the victim did.

The film is directed by Michael Cuesta, who previously directed episodes of Dexter and Six Feet Under.  It's produced by Tony and Ridley Scott, and even though they aren't listed as directors, I found it interesting that the film borrows direction techniques from Man on Fire (A Tony Scott film).

I've enjoyed work by Josh Lucas in the past (Glory Road, Sweet Home Alabama), but he simply doesn't stand out in this role.  On the other hand, Brian Cox (Bourne Identity, Braveheart) absolutely steals the show as Van Doren, the detective following every move Josh's character makes.  Michael K. Williams (Omar Little from The Wire) seemed a promising inclusion in the film, but has virtually no screen time.

The downside to the film is that it's not incredibly original.  Return to Me was a 2000 movie that deals with the bond between a heart transplant recipient, and the man who loved the deceased donor.  1995's Jeff Goldblum film Hideaway also explored supernatural connections between accident victims.  Beyond the concept issues, the twist that occurs during the film serves only to point out a major plothole (the most I can say without spoiling it).

This movie is worth renting, though I wouldn't consider buying it until after you've watched it once.  Light on originality, but with some solid acting by Brian Cox, this makes for a decent weekend rental.",1266019200,20,1831,4.921824104234528
8389658,3,B00368PSLY,"A man receives a heart in a transplant, and the donor's heart possesses the man at certain moments, forcing him to track down and kill the donor's murderers. This is not an original idea. Donor organs possessing their recipients have been done before in horror (e.g., the ""Spare Parts"" episode of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-Story-aka-Circle-of-Fear/dp/B007Q0JJD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost Story aka Circle of Fear</a>). And the dark side of organ transplants have likewise been done in horror, the most famous example being&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coma/dp/B0045HCJ8A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coma</a>, though there are others.

We never find out how the heart donor is possessing the man. Is it the donor's ghost? Or is it cellular memory? (An as-yet-unproven paranormal theory that every cell in the human body retains memory, not just the brain.) The film doesn't even try to explore the cause, though it would have made for an interesting angle.

So the man goes about killing his heart donor's murderers. The murders are not too gory. They mostly occur unseen. A man is stabbed, we see him grimace, but don't actually see the knife penetrate. Another man is pushed ahead of an oncoming train. We don't actually see him torn and splattered. That might disappoint gorehounds, but I found the events interesting enough, the characters and their reactions fully-fleshed enough, not to be bothered by the lack of gore. (Well, there are scenes from the heart transplant surgery, which some might find pretty unsettling.)

An interesting subplot is this man's daughter, who has a rare genetic disorder. It causes the bones to fuse together. I found that more horrifying than the other events in this story.

Lena Headey plays the love interest. She reveals some shocking secrets toward the end. Headey starred in one of the 5 Best horror films of this century's first decade (2000-2009) --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Broken/dp/B001P9N944/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Broken</a>&nbsp;-- a creepy film about doppelgangers.

The police detective is played by Brian Cox, who you might remember as Samara's father in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ring/dp/B00AEFYYH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ring</a>, another one of my 5 Best horror films of the aughts (as the first decade of any century is known).

By contrast, Tell Tale is a so-so film. No, it doesn't have anything to do with the Poe story. It's foundation concepts are not entirely original. But it made for an entertaining way to pass the time. Professional production values -- photography, sound, acting, editing. Good editing in that this is a short film, no padding, the story doesn't drag.",1441411200,2,2866,6.0294840294840295
8389659,3,B00368PSLY,"Didn't know what to expect watching this film for the first time.  Here's what to expect:  1) Characters you wish the producers had spent more time developing, but were sacrificed to the plot.  I liked Brian Cox, Lena Headey and Beatrice Miller, but they weren't in enough of the scenes they were in, let alone being in enough scenes;  2) A lot of heart palpitations and a few violent reactions to same as portrayed by Josh Lucas.  3) Some hand waving about why a donor heart would a) give Lucas visions about the murder of his donor, b) let him finger the murderers, c) be able to rewire his immune system, and d) be able to survive the next to last scene (trying to avoid spoilers); 3) bad parenting of a sweet child with a genetic defect; and 4) a plot that ties itself into a knot if not a bow in the last scene.  Still enjoyable if you like the actors involved, but again, their performances were mostly treated as plot devices and not given enough screen time or attention to show who they are and why.",1418860800,,1008,4.335106382978723
8389660,4,B00368PSLY,"I am prejudiced about this movie because I am a big fan of Josh Lucas.  Lucas plays a great father (loving, attentive) even though at least once he neglects his daughter while he is obsessed with finding the killers of the man whose heart he gets as a transplant.
As usual Brian Cox gives a solid performance.
It has been too many years since I read Edgar Allan Poe's The Tell-Tale Heart so I am not qualified to compare that story with this movie.
Regardless, this movie stands on its own.",1374796800,,490,4.384615384615385
8389661,3,B00368PSLY,"Viewers expecting this film to be an adaptation of Poe's immortal ""Tell-Tale Heart"" might well be disappointed.  This is a reimagining of the tale in which a hardworking father has a new lease of life, having recovered from a heart transplant, and by chance meets a beautiful woman.  However things start to go wrong when he is haunted by his own heartbeat, and understands that he must find out the shady past of the donor who gave him his new heart.  Produced by the Scott brothers, this is a fascinating study of psychological disturbance, if a little grisly for squeamish viewers.",1353801600,,584,4.762376237623762
8389662,1,B00368PSLY,"Product was damaged. I had to purchase it again.  I was about to show it to the class, and when I opened it, it was cracked.  I was stuck and had to scramble.  We had just finished reading Poe's story and they had written their own adaptation of the Tell Tale Heart.  I purchased it again.",1350604800,,289,4.107142857142857
8389663,3,B00368PSLY,"Good spin off of Edgar Allan Poe's ""Tell Tale Heart"", a semi-original movie that is not like many others. This was a decent suspense movie that was interesting throughout with a twist at the end. Not one of the best movies I have ever seen, but not terrible either.",1328745600,,265,4.428571428571429
8389664,4,B00368PSLY,"Tell Tale (Michael Cuesta, 2009)

This is another of those pleasant-surprise films that simply disappeared into the ether. It showed at Tribeca, failed to find an American distributor, and went straight to DVD a year later. On the other hand, successful festival runs in other parts of the world led to theatrical releases in France, Singapore, Greece, Mexico, Brazil, Russia, South Africa, Australia... and the list goes on. Why is it that other countries are so able to recognize the worth of smaller American films, while those of us who like to see things on the big screen are so often spoon-fed the lowest common denominator? (I already think I know the answer to that question, but I'm hoping if I keep asking it, the studios who refuse to take chances on intelligent, low-budget movies like this will get the hint.)

This is, in fact, an adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's ""The Tell-Tale Heart"", but it's not one you're likely to recognize. Scriptwriter Dave Callaham (The Expendables) turned the story on its head; in this case, we have a heart transplant patient who has also gained some of the memories of the donor, who was murdered. Terry (Poseidon's Josh Lucas), said patient, becomes obsessed with solving the donor's murder. Problem is, he's becoming somewhat divorced from his own reality, which places a strain on his relationship with Elizabeth (300's Lena Headey, currently filming the Game of Thrones adaptation for HBO), his daughter Angela (Toy Story 3's Beatrice Miller)'s doctor. It's not enough Terry's got a bad ticker, his kid has a nasty, and incredibly rare, genetic defect. Not a lucky family by any means, right? So maybe it's not all that bad a thing when Terry starts gaining not only the donor's memories, but also his personality. (Here's a great example of possession for you: his blood type changes to the donor's. According to the doctor in the film, it's rare, but does happen; I have yet to be able to substantiate this with my own research.) Certainly not in the eyes of Sergeant van Doren (Red's Brian Cox), the lead detective on the case. Why not let the inspired amateur do all the work for him? Problem is, the donor doesn't just want answers, he wants revenge.

I've only touched on the cast here, which also includes Michael K. Williams (The Road) Ulrich Thomsen (Adam's Apples), Jamie Herrold (Natural Born Killers), Dallas Roberts (Walk the Line), and a host of other luminaries you'll probably recognize just enough to say ""hey, I know that guy, but can't place him..."". They're all good actors, and they all turn in solid performances here. Well, almost all. Headey stretches probability a few times, though that is less a function of her acting ability than it is the script needing her to not kick this guy to the curb. She does the best she can with the movie's main weakness. The mystery angle is solid, and while you probably won't be terribly surprised by it (it's a common enough urban legend that I can think of at least three films off the top of my head that use it), it matches up with everything that comes before it. Callaham knows how to write a mystery. Which kind of surprises me given his other output; this is by far the best work he's ever produced. Cuesta, on the other hand, is solid through and through, having turned in the movie L. I. E. and long, successful stints on both Six Feet Under and Dexter. You probably missed this one the first time around, unless you live on the Lower East Side. It's worth discovering now. *** ",1295395200,6,3498,4.720130932896891
8389665,2,B00368PSLY,"This movie is bad, and the blu-ray video quality sometimes is bad too. It looks like an excellent DVD in a few scenes and a so so DVD in most parts of it. I can't understand the people who make this things! I think they need a doctor!",1292803200,,234,3.8958333333333335
8389666,5,B00368PSLY,"This film has some interesting twists to it, and Josh Lucas's character is both a hero and an anti-hero. I thought he did a good job with the role. I missed that emotional depth that he can portray so well, but this picture didn't call for that. Still, I saw a side of his acting range I hadn't seen before, and he did as well with the character as anyone else could have. I adored the little girl who played his daughter, and it was great to see a story  featuring a relationship between the male and female lead that lasted longer than about two minutes of an entire movie.",1290643200,4,575,4.2272727272727275
8389667,5,B00368PSLY,"Well I read all the customer reviews and wasn't sure what to expect but Tell Tale was a pleasent surprise.  The movie is very good.  The plot is suspensful at times and has a few surprising twists.

If you like suspensful movies with a plot that doesn't totally tie together until your almost done watching this is the type of movie for you.

I really have no complaints about it not relating to the actual edgar allen poe tale and after watching the movie the title ""Tell Tale"", as it relates to this man's transplanted donar heart, is more than fitting.",1282262400,,555,4.465346534653466
