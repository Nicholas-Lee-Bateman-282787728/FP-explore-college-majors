5657053,5,B00BN3DZZA,"This Blu ray bundle contain some of Woody Allen's best films.  I'll review each film and it's Blu ray aspects:

SLEEPER (1973): 4.5 stars

Woody Allen stars, directs and co-wrote (with Marshall Brickman) this hilarious film.  Perhaps not his funniest, but if not, it's close.  Allen plays Miles Monroe who, in 1973, went in the hospital for routine surgery for an ulcer and when things didn't go well, he was placed in a cryogenic state.  Two hundred years later he is found by a couple of scientists who bring him out of his coma.  This entails unwrapping Miles from the aluminum foil that encased his head (complete with glasses) and his extremities.

It takes Miles a while to acclimate himself to his situation but the one-liners never stop, and I never stopped laughing or at least broadly grinning.  Some viewers may miss out on some of the inside jokes unless you're familiar with the culture of New York in the 1970's.  It turns out Miles's rescuers are part of an underground movement to overthrow a supreme leader who has instituted a police state mostly devoid of feelings and emotion.  For example when a couple or individual want to have pleasurable sex they just go into a cylindrical closet called an orgasmatron and after a few seconds...satisfaction.  Miles, of course would prefer sex the old fashion way.

When the police arrest Miles's scientist rescuers he escapes, but must take on the guise of a domestic robot.  This sequence really shows Allen's ability at physical comedy.  The entire film has many slapstick routines and this is one of the best examples as Allen channels Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and others from the silent era.  When Miles is sent to work for a beautiful but propagandized woman named Luna (Diane Keaton, Allen's off-screen paramour at the time) the fun begins anew.  Keaton is excellent and the repartee between the couple is wonderful to watch.  The film is a hoot to watch.  Certainly one of Allen's best.

The Blu ray transfer is in 1080p and has a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  For a film this old, the transfer looks very good.  The film grain is clearly visible but I'm not surprised.  It is not distracting unless you are expecting a smooth background consistent with more digital forms used today.  The clarity is so good you'll be able to see goofs in the film not otherwise noticeable.  Once sequence in particular is when Luna jumps on top of Miles who is inside an inflated rubber suit on the water.  A gunshot releases air from the suit and it is propelled across a lake.  You can easily see that Luna is wearing different shoes on the water than when she started.  And you can see the tow line attached to the suit.  No biggie.  Excellent transfer.  The audio comes in DTS-HD Master Audio Mono.  Allen isn't big on surround or even stereo but this mono track is very good.  The film contains a lot of music recorded with Allen and the famous Preservation Hall Jazz Band.  The only extra is a trailer for the film.

ANNIE HALL (1977): 5.0 stars

To put it bluntly, this is my favorite Woody Allen film as well as my favorite comedy of all time so I would have a hard time being terribly objective as I believe the film holds up well today.  By this stage of Allen's career he had become more sophisticated in his comedy and less reliant of the slapstick, as good as it was, of his earlier films.  Diane Keaton returns as a romantic foil for Allen once again.  Allen plays Alvy Singer, a comedy writer and two time loser at marriage.  His relationship with Keaton's waspish Annie allows Allen to make this film personal and almost autobiographical in nature.

Woody Allen and Diane Keaton are great together. Chasing lobsters and spiders. Keaton also started a whole new trend in women's clothing that lasted years.  This great film has lost little even if the mores of the times are different. Allen is at the top of his game as a director and actor and Diane Keaton shows what a great actress she is...as well as a pretty good singer. Keep your eyes peeled for small roles for Christopher Walken, Shelley Duvall, Sigourney Weaver, Truman Capote and Jeff Goldblum.

The Blu ray version, while a step up from the DVD isn't going to wow the viewer like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" but it is very good and has very little video noise.  As noted above in ""Sleeper"" the film has plenty of course grain, even during daylight scenes.  The transfer is in 1080p and has a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  The audio comes from a mono master and is converted to a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 (Mono).  This is a dialog driven movie, so little should be expected from surrounds in any case.  The audio is clear and concise.  Woody's not big on special features, so don't look for any.

MANHATTAN (1979): 4.5 Stars

Following up on his smash ""Annie Hall,"" Woody Allen displays his love for the city of New York in all her black and white glory. Woody plays Isaac Davis, an unhappy writer for TV sitcoms. He has a good life with a nice apartment, good friends and is unashamedly dating a 17 year old high school student (Mariel Hemingway).

Finally fed up with the crap he has to write, he quits his job to pursue his quest of writing a novel. Now financially strapped, he must move and cut back on expenses including money he sends to his parents. He bemoans the fact that they won't have as good a seat in the synagogue. That they will be far away from God...away from the action. Little gems like that are sprinkled throughout the film.

Isaac realizes that while the sex with Tracy (Hemingway) is great, their age difference (25 years) will be an on-going problem. Eventually he dumps her in favor of an opinionated feminist from Philadelphia (a radiant Diane Keaton). She herself recently ended an affair with Isaac's married best friend (Michael Murphy). There is a tangential story line involving Isaac's second ex-wife (Meryl Streep). She divorced Isaac because she finally realized she was a lesbian. In another scene, Jill (Streep) argues with Isaac that surely he must have known she wasn't straight. Isaac quips something about his analyst suggested as much, so he changed analysts.

Jill is now writing a ""tell all"" book much to Isaac's consternation. This theme runs throughout the film. Ultimately as funny as it is, this is a more expansive vision of love, art and relationships. It could be argued that it is Woody Allen's greatest film. I would put it a click behind ""Annie Hall.""

The Blu ray transfer again is in 1080p resolution with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  It looks very good in its black and white glory.  If anything it seems a bit darker than I recall, but I could be wrong.  In any case it is sharp and consistently clear throughout most of the run.  Like others in the collection, this disc is in DTS-HD Master Audio Mono (2 channels) and is fine.  The film has a Gershwinesqe musical theme and it sounds very good.

HANNAH AND HER SISTERS (1986): 4.5 Stars

What's not to like in this Woody Allen masterpiece? His screenplay won the Oscar for this story, essentially about 3 much different adult sisters that come from artistic parentage (Lloyd Nolan as the father and Maureen O'Sullivan as the mother who is also the real mother of co-star Mia Farrow). Mickey (Allen) was once married to Hannah (Farrow) and maintains a friendly relationship. Close enough that Hannah sets up Mickey on a disastrous date with her younger scatter-brained sister, Holly (Dianne Wiest, Oscar winner for this film).

Hannah is now married to financial advisor Elliott (Michael Caine who also won an Oscar). Elliott, while he still loves Hannah, lusts over her other sister, Lee (a luscious Barbara Hershey). Lee cohabitates with an older artist (Max von Sydow). Allen, as usual, spends a great amount of time showing off New York. In one scene, Holly and her best friend April (Carrie Fisher, ""Star Wars"") meet a cruising architect (an uncredited Sam Waterston) at a party. While he tries to chose who he will go home with, he gives the ladies a tour of his favorite buildings in the city.

Allen manages to incorporate the right mix of humor (much of which comes from Mickey's hypochondria), drama and sentiment to make one of his best films. His music ranges from punk rockers ""39 steps"" performing ""Slip into the Crowd"" at CBGB's to jazz legend Bobby Short's ""I'm In Love Again."" Both live pieces performed while Mickey and Holly go on their first date.

Some other trivia artifacts include a screen credit for ""apprentice film editor"" Nicole Holofcener who went on to direct ""Please Give"" and ""Friends With Money"" among other films. There are blink-and-you'll-miss-them walk-ons by Julia Louis-Dreyfus and comedian Lewis Black. You can also see some of Farrow and Allen's adoptive children including a pre-teen Soon-Yi Previn who went on to become Mrs. Allen.

The Blu ray transfer looks good most of the time.  Seasoned viewers may notice some video noise here and there, but I'm not sure if that is the original film or the transfer.  In any case, it is occasionally noticeable but not terrible distracting.  The audio is another mono track in DTS-HD Master Audio.  Clear, centered and understandable dialog throughout.

I will leave it up to you as how to own this bundle of Woody Allen's best films.  As I write this, the Amazon price seems a bit steep ($81) especially since individual prices are collectively less.  But prices change.  This looks like one of those Gold Box deals surely to come.",1372982400,9,9456,4.707420924574209
