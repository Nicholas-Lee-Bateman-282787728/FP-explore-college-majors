8250371,5,B0013DPUYY,"Parfenov somehow distilled each year (40-45 min episode in the series) to the most memorable events, fashion styles, emotions, etc of each year. The series is a perfect mix of video clips and clever commentary with an occasional quote from soviet-times folklore. Even though all episodes in the series can be found on youtube, I felt compelled to buy the DVD set in hopes that the creators of this series will benefit from the sales, they deserve highest praise for their work. Buy this set as a present for a Russian in your life - you will not disappoint!",1396483200,3,557,4.636363636363637
