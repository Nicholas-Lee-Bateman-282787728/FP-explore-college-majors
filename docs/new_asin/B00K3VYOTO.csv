What the producers of this documentary Cool Spaces have accomplished is the same and some more by interviewing and analyzing architectural masterpieces with their creators. A rare opportunity not only to understand their creative approach but more importantly to witness these geniuses at work by having them discuss and analyze their approach to the art of architecture at its best while being a business person in establishing a reputable architectural firms that has to compete with many other architects internationally for a single worthy public as well as private project regardless of the location of such project on the globe. A rare window to the soul of architects and architecture that we may possibly have the opportunity to experience through many writings and publications available in many arenas but certainly never with so many talents describing their creations personally and emotionally. Educational documentary that is a pleasure and joy to watch and listen to in a profession that requires so many years of hard work with so many individuals with so many ethnicity, cultures, agendas and beliefs who need to come together and find common grounds to create environments that are monumental in its strength and simplicity. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1403568000,4,1893,5.716312056737588
