1970236,5,B00014E9IO,"I guess these days it sort of goes without saying that with Wes Skiles involved this should be among the very best projects on the subject of cave diving and conservation, and in my opinion it is. Extremely well written, well narrated and unbelievably well shot. Thanks for another amazing Karst Production. Cant wait for the next one!!",1259020800,,336,4.810344827586207
1970237,5,B00014E9IO,"I originally watched this on PBS, and immediately ordered the DVD so I could watch it repeatedly and keep it in my permanent reference library.  The filming is stunning, and the concept is incredible ... follow an aquifer underneath fields, cities, roads, pristine woods and trash dumps.  For those who have only experienced water resources coming from a tap inside the house, this video dramatically expands consciousness of this miraculous and fragile resource.  Seeing ""first-hand"" how groundwater moves, and how the ""terra firma"" literally floats above the aquifer is a rare and awe-inspiring experience.",1163030400,2,608,5.446808510638298
1970238,5,B00014E9IO,Water's journey explores the important connection between man and the very water that keeps us thriving.  This is an important film and one that I wish was required in schools.,1142208000,,176,4.866666666666666
1970239,5,B00014E9IO,"""Water's Journey, The Hidden Rivers of Florida"" is an outstanding environmental film, devoid of the usual propaganda, distortion, and fear-mongering typical of most nature documentaries of late.

  Through a fascinating divers' journey underground, tracked above ground across town and country, the film examines sources of pollution in the hydrologic cycle, specifically in the aquifer beneath north Florida's many sinkholes and springs.

  Without minimizing the seriousness of its topic, the production WISELY STAYS AWAY FROM:

--- gaseous overgeneralizations,

--- pseudoscience,

--- demonizing suburban living, modern agriculture and businesses,

--- implying that all we need is more federal regulations to stop already-illegal and senseless pollution.

INSTEAD, through sheer beauty, thoughtful narration, and dramatic demonstrations of how various pollutants are entering the aquifer, the film instills a desire to protect and take responsibility for the aquifer.

  I can only hope that the same editorial care is used in the sequel (""Water's Journey, The River Returns""), which I have not yet seen.",1139961600,,1109,5.936708860759493
1970240,5,B00014E9IO,"Ever since I was a kid, I have been for ever fascinated with Florida's fresh water springs. There is just something about them, so clear, cool and inviting. I have always wanted to learn to scuba dive, so I could actually see what was under the water in these jewels as they are called. I finally grew up an took scuba lessons, and have had the pleasure of diving many of Florida's springs. They never stop amazing me. Im in AWH everytime I dive one of them. Wes Skiles has been a long time cave diver, camera man, and adventurer. He has made lots of documentaries, and The Hidden Rivers OF Florida is one of his best. It really makes you aware that there is more to springs that meet the eye. Springs are actually underground rivers that flow beneath Florida, and Florida's drinking water is derived from them. So pollution is a main factor here. The cave shots are spectacular, but disturbing. You see first hand how pollution is taking its toll on the underground rivers, and eventually comes bubbling up in the springs themselves. We all need to be aware and we all need to do our part to protect theses jewels of the earth. I highly recommend this dvd to any scuba diver, nature person, or anyone interested in knowing how and where Florida's freshwater sprngs are formed....Great documentary, very educational.....",1136332800,2,1320,4.645299145299146
1970241,5,B00014E9IO,"This is a terrific film.  It has a very basic premise-what you discard today may be what you drink tomorrow.  The video has illustrated the point in the best way I've ever seen it done.  There can be no mistake about the connection between the aquifer (underground) water and activities on the surface.
Two particular things are great about the video.  It's got a touch of humor.  No dry, boring science here!  The other is that the purpose of the video is conservation.  But it's imminently practical.  There's no suggestion we should go back to living in the stone age.  The show gives several examples of what farmers and homeowners can do in their own lives to really make a difference-without sacrificing our modern lifestyle!
I highly recommend this DVD.  It's fun to watch all the beautifully filmed cave diving, too!",1076976000,10,824,4.780141843971631
1970242,5,B00014E9IO,I accidentally came across this film on pbs.  It immediately caught my attention.  It was exactly the type of film I could use in my classroom or share with an adult.  It makes clear the importance of protecting the aquifer from pollutants.  It's amazing to see the two divers swim past a 50 gallon oil drum and a large tractor tire.  The filming is beautifully done and the dialogue well scripted.  The film nears its end with the divers emerging into a sink hole that is polluted and smells.  Outstanding video!!,1074902400,8,514,4.582417582417582
1970243,5,B00014E9IO,"As a teacher and a cave diver seeing Water's Journey on PBS in October motivated me to write a unit for my classroom using Water's Journey as the outline.  Making aquifers, discussing the plight of our water, testing water and becoming aware of our wonderful resource that is being misused by all of us.
The classroom discussions that this movie prompted were both energizing and powerful.  This movie brings out what is known as ""A Teachable Moment"".  These moments are the moments that teachers look forward to.  Be prepared to watch this movie more than once.",1073606400,6,562,4.822916666666667
1970244,5,B00014E9IO,"Water's Journey is an amazing documentary about the most common of all elements: tap water. Well, it' s really about the earth and our eco-systems, but the way the filmmakers tell the tale of how water flows through hidden rivers and soaring caves grabs the viewer's attention and entertains us along the way. Made me feel like grabbing a wet suit and digging under my own house to explore the hidden world's deep below. Gorgeous photography, fun stunts, stunningly daring dives and information every family should know. DRINK THIS UP!",1073520000,,535,4.955555555555556
1970245,5,B00014E9IO,"This film will amaze you.  It follows 2 divers as they swim underground through tunnels and rock formations of the underwater river systems of Florida, and allows you to actually see where the water that we drink travels before it comes out of our faucets.  It is educational and timely...but more than that, it is an exciting and breathtaking visual adventure as you watch the divers swim underneath Florida in the maze-like tunnels of the aquifer.  Among other places, their journey actually takes them under a bowling alley, a golf course, and a restaurant!
If you are a scuba diver you will be able to appreciate the skills and training these cave divers have...if you are not a scuba diver, you might just think they are crazy! But in any case, you will be awed by the beauty of the ""hidden rivers"", amazed by the journey of the divers and the water, and inspired to conserve and protect the natural wonders that are Florida springs.
This film is a must-have for divers and non-divers alike, and more than anything, teaches us all about what we can do to make sure we have pure, clean water for future generations. I highly recommend it!",1073433600,4,1142,4.643564356435643

8006232,5,B00014E9IO,"I teach a college level physical geography class in Central Florida. This video can be used to point out how valuable a resource is the Floridan Aquifer, and also the hydrologic cycle and the importance of water conservation.",1424390400,,225,4.947368421052632
8006233,5,B00014E9IO,This is a movie everyone should watch to show people what really goes into our water. I watched this in college and now have it for my personal collection.,1416355200,,155,4.379310344827586

8006235,5,B00014E9IO,"Every Floridian should see this documentary.  Actually, everyone should see this documentary.  I saw this film on PBS when it was first released and it had such an impact on me that I still tell everyone about it years later.",1401321600,,225,4.6
8006236,5,B00014E9IO,The water in Florida is much more subversive than in other places. Our rivers tend to be quieter and often underground. Wes Skiles has documented our water so well in this and other DVDs. I would recommend this to anyone.,1392508800,,221,4.55
8006237,5,B00014E9IO,"A team of cave divers explore a portion of an underground river in Florida.
They are followed on the surface by a survey team in real time.
What is serious is what the cave divers find down below.
What is lighthearted is where the survey team goes as they follow the cave divers.
What the film makers accomplish is to raise awareness about the degradation of underground water quality and some some strategies to improve water quality.
Like using slow release fertilizers to minimize nitrates in storm water runoff.
I would not be surprised if the video was not used in grade school science classes.",1362441600,,599,4.714285714285714
8006238,5,B00014E9IO,"Loved this DVD.  I saw this on TV, back in 2000.  It shows how beautiful and delicate, Florida's water system really is.  If you are a concerned conservationist, you will truly enjoy this DVD.  I highly recommend this, to all Floridians.",1306540800,,237,4.7073170731707314
8006239,5,B00014E9IO,Fantastic video to show students the Florida Aquifer and that we need to care for it. Divers actually swim through the aquifer and people above follow them. They even go though building to follow the dive team. I use it with both my public school and Palm Beach State College classes.,1274832000,,284,4.588235294117647
8006240,5,B00014E9IO,"This is the DVD of a lifetime. You will be shocked at where our drinking water comes from. This should be a required dvd in all schools to show children AND adults not to throw trash out and pollute the earth.
Get this video, you will not regret it and you will most likely share it.",1267833600,,283,4.071428571428571
