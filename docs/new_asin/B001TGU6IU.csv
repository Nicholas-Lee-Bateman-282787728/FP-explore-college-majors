8341167,5,B001TGU6IU,"I adored this episode of Nature. Aside from stunning cinematography, when  the leader of a troop of toque macaques is killed, the troop all huddle on a branch above his body, eyes averted, holding each other and clearly grieving their loss. Even his old rivals now seem to show their deference, tenderly touching their fallen leader. I think monkeys grieve better than we do. This is television at its finest.",1297036800,11,409,4.8428571428571425
