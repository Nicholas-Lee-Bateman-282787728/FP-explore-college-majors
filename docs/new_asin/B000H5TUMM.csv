This video slows down some of the movements and makes it real. John Hammond made a life learning the blues styles of many players and plays and preserves their heritage. Thank you, John, for your gifts.",1370908800,2,347,4.40625

He's full of passion, excitement and lives on the edge. his blues are so raw, it's like he might crash and burn at any moment, but never does. he'll stir your soul. I highly recommend you get his live in France DVD too....",1235692800,3,247,4.276595744680851
8136744,5,B000H5TUMM,"I almost passed out when I saw this. There is almost no available video of John Hammond. All I've been able to compile over the years is 2- half hour Austin City Limits shows and an older instructional video he did many years ago. Now there is this and an amazing new Paris concert DVD. I found out about them on the same day and ordered them both immediately. I was not disappointed. John is so humble and gracious when interviewed which contrasts with his power and emotion when playing. His voice and playing are in the best shape of his career and I'm so glad that both have been captured for ever on this (and the Paris) DVD.

Specifics: This is not a DVD that will teach beginners how to play the blues although there is a lot they can still absorb and take away from it. Even non guitar playing fans of John will love this for the stories and the close up playing and as I said because there is so little available video of John. The Tablature that comes with it is very useful but does not always match perfectly what John plays. Only small sections of what John plays shows up in the Tab booklet that comes with it. Although the title mentions harmonica playing there is basically no instruction on harp playing other than a broad discussion of what keys he uses. I have some harp playing experience and wasn't able to add to it from this video. The split screens are nice and the DVD is nice and long at about 2 hours so it doesn't feel rushed.  Note, he covers both standard tuned acoustic guitar and open tuned resonator guitar.

I love this DVD but feel it is more about being up close with John while he does his thing than about learning to do what he does. That's why I think it has wider appeal than just guitar players.",1162252800,21,1737,4.289634146341464
