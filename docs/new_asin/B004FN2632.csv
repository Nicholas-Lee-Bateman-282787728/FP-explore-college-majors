8427955,4,B004FN2632,"Having lived in Mississippi as a child I became acutely familiar with fire ants. I'd never seen a group of inscts defend their home as feircly as these creatures, and every year more and more mounds would pop up on our two and a half acre front yard.

This documentary covers the species warfare study by a scientist to use the fire ants natural predator against them. Tiny insects not afraid of my foot suddenly become terrified of flies smaller than grains of sand. It's an approach we've seen elsewhere where an invasive species is targeted using the natural enemy of that species against it, but in this case the flies cannot survive without the ants and naturally would die out once the ant populations were eradicated.

I enjoyed watching it through the first time but it is not a documentary I would sit through repete viewings of, hence the four stars. It is informative but not really entertaining or revealing of the two species on display. These creatures effect on man's domain is simply a backdrop to the story, but you don't feel as though these ants pose any real threat (which they certianly do, to livestock, agriculture and infrastructure). The documentary seems like its covering a kids science experiment as opposed to a dedicated eradication plan.

The quality of the sound and picture are great, no complaints there.",1369440000,,1338,4.808695652173913
