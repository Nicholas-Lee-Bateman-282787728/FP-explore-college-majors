7696364,4,B01D2KFA5Y,"I really enjoyed this film. At first, I was a little worried that there would be no animals. I hate when movies advertise animals and there aren't any in the film. I was wrong! There are tons of animals and it was really fun to see them in their natural habitats. We see lions, elephants, snakes, monkeys, giraffes and so many more. I learned a lot too. I actually had no idea that lions and hyenas are afraid of fire. All of these majestic, friendly and not so friendly animals were my favorite part of this film.

This film revolves about a brother and sister, Ryan (John Paul Ruttan) and Emma (Ella Ballentine). They take an airplane to see their father and their plane gets shot down over the Serengeti. With the pilot injured and no one else to help them except a Malamute dog called Chinook, they have to rely on each other for survival.

My favorite character in this film is Emma because she is upbeat and tries her hardest to be positive, even though it is difficult. She is also a little scared and I could definitely relate to that.  Emma and Ryan desperately want to go home to mom and dad. She portrays the character well and shows a bit of girl power, humor, wit and courage.

My favorite scene is when we see an aerial view of zebras, wildebeest and giraffes from the plane. This was an incredible scene because we got to learn more about the animals
.
Some things about this movie bothered me. Emma had a cut on her face which moved from scene to scene. In one shot, it was on her left cheek and then, it was on the right. Continuity is a big deal on a film and this was a goof. Also, I found some of the fire scenes and, there are many, a little worrisome. I kept thinking, Please, stop and clear all the grass away so you do not start a brush fire. I thought more could have been done with content of the kids backpacks and what could help them. It lacked teaching and educational moments, to me. But, overall, I loved the film and seeing the cool animals.

This film is suitable for ages 6 to 18. My mom and dad liked it so, I think other adults would enjoy it as well. Younger children might find the lions, crocodiles and hyenas frightening because they all are all real and scary looking. I rate this film 4.5 out of 5 stars as it felt as if I was on a safari in the Serengeti in Africa.

7696365,5,B01D2KFA5Y,"This is an adorable movie that while it is the 2nd movie in the Against The Wild series, you do not have to have seen the first movie. This movie uses a whole new family but the story features the same family dog who is being delivered to the family from the first movie via plane. The plane crashes with the dog and the two new kids and the kids go to find help for the pilot who is injured. Set in the jungle and savannah, the kids face some adventures with weather and animals. It is a great family movie and it teaches some great lessons such as working together and surviving outdoors. My whole family enjoyed it, which doesn't happen often since the range goes from 4 to 35 years old!

I received this movie to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.",1462060800,,766,4.2465753424657535

8754752,3,B01D2KFA5Y,"Pretty much the same scenario as the first film, only instead of the Canadian wilderness these two kids and a dog have survived a light plane crash in Africa.  Like the brother and sister in the first film these siblings abandon their adult pilot who isn't conscious much, so they decide to abandon him, travel away from the wreckage on foot to their dad's mine to get themselves and him help.  Although the script with some animal behaviour, but especially the dialogue is still really poor, it doesn't quite have anything as bad as the holding fish scene from the first one, and the flying in the plane scenes looked somewhat more believable, the decision to concentrate on the views of the animals they are flying over was probably a good one.

The dog in this one seems older and less energetic than the one in the original film. There are times when the kids are fighting for their lives against hyenas or a lion when it's just sitting there panting contentedly as if nothing is happening. Obviously the kids are just stabbing fire on poles at the camera and there is no actual predator in the same space as them, (this is something they couldn't make look real in the first film with a bear and other animals either), but you'd think a dog trainer would have been behind the camera man prompting the dog to react or something.  The camera as the predator is also fairly obvious when its supposedly stalking through long grass.

At times you expected the kids to go up in flames when they're lighting fires in long dry grass, these sort of scenes were usually shortly followed by the parents telling the army guy that their kids are really smart kids. The boy telling his sister lions can't climb trees was another proving their parents were lying memorable moment. I don't agree with other reviewers that the kids are bad actors, it's just as I said the script for these kid's dialogue was a bit unnatural.  The girl constantly says Ryan at the start of sentences which becomes annoying after a while when who else would he think she'd be talking to?  There's a water bottle that is filled up with realistic not clear water that in the next shot looks like it is newly bought from a store. I did like how the kids realistically looked sunburnt, most films with people wandering around the wilderness seem to forget this or the actors don't want to look like that or whatever.

The target market is obviously young kids, but I think even they would know a large predatory cat is faster than a dog. Not to mention a lion that should have caught humans  They might believe that a crocodile would attack it's prey on the bank by swimming on top of the water towards it, instead of stealthily underwater positioning itself in front of them and leaping out and grabbing before they even knew it was there.  Also we have a scene of a croc leaping at the dangling legs well within its strike zone but it's never explained or shown why it missed.  At least they didn't use blow dried fur and dirt free captive animals like they did in the first film, these ones although looking at ease with humans at least look like they live in a wildlife sanctuary or something close to how they would if in the wild.

The region 4 DVD has some out takes, and one on one interviews with the cast. You don't need to have seen the first film to watch this as it's a completely separate family.",1488931200,,3375,4.478827361563518
