Despite No 1's bad reception on its release in the seventies, causing Norman Wisdom to desert film making for more than twenty years, I found it highly amusing and very sweet, in Sally Geeson's charmingly sexy way, portraying the kind of mini dresses that thrilled more than a generation, so clingingly, so intriguingly superior to the kind of looser minis we see today that seem designed by people who never experienced the c1965-1970 heydays of the mini skirt!  Oh bliss!!!!  By comparison, I reckon the makers of British TV's Heartbeat serial, set in that period, ought to be sued for misrepresentation of the thrilling female clothing so popular from the mid-1960s to the early 1970s -- unfortunately popular even with those ladies not blessed with the requisite shape for wearing them.  Oh shame!!!!

I found No 2 very good indeed, with some actors and actresses familiar from TV shows of various kinds over many years, including those of Benny Hill, notably Suzy Mandel.

No 3 wasn't bad, but nowhere nearly so enjoyable as the two previous DVDs.",1208390400,6,1198,4.87192118226601

Bad news: Proof they can slap together slipshod material.
Good news: Our opportunity to feel superior to the Brits.",1190592000,2,135,5.181818181818182
