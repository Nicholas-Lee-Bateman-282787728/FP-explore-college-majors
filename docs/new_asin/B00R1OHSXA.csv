Do your self a favor, if you have any interest in the found footage genre, then you need to buy this and buy it hard.

 **EXTREME SPOILER ALERT** It is about a giant child-eating goat demon up under a church. **END OF EXTREME SPOILERS**

Yes, the tech geek is annoying, especially the first time around. But he knows his stuff, he does his job, and actually makes the ""found footage"" aspect more believable, as how often has anyone been put in a situation with more than two people where everyone gets along all the time? Set in rural Britain, the scenery is breathtaking, and the church where the film is centered has so much mystique that it could almost be considered as its own character. The tension builds throughout the film to a fever-pitch, and the finale is downright terrifying. It's only a matter of time before ""Final Prayer"" will be considered a classic in the Horror genre and ends up on Blu-Ray. You watch.",1477180800,,802,4.615384615384615
6897858,4,B00R1OHSXA,"Released to strong reviews in the UK under the original title of ""The Borderlands,"" this is one of the most effective stories about demons, possessions and other freakish forms of quasi-religious horror I've seen in years.
Gordon Kennedy is sensational as a hard-drinking Vatican investigator who is sent around the world to assess claims by local parishes that a holy or demonic event  or phenomenon is taking place.

While there's very little here about church politics, there is a subtle bit of authoritarian anxiety that adds to the paranoia: The investigator's bosses naturally want him to debunk everything he looks into.

What's more, he's an outspoken, passionate sort actively struggling with his faith and vocation so he's accompanied by a trusted Vatican lackey who is supposed to report on his behavior.

With this going on in the background, the investigator, his cameraman -- oh did I not say this is a found footage film -- and the Vatican lackey enter a medieval parish church in an isolated Irish village to encounter what seems like a classic hoax.

But it's not. As they peel away the layers of the onion, it becomes clear there's something deeply and darkly supernatural going on at this church.
The film takes us into some familiar horror movie terrain but does it so effectively that by the time the stunning twist ending takes p lace you're ready to tear your  hair out and seek shelter with your mommy.

I hate, I mean it, I loathe found footage films. But this one is done so well, with such forethought that it works brilliantly.. Some fans may dismiss the film as another rehearsal of well-known tropes well known from the Exorcist on. But I think the film is so much more.",1473984000,2,1700,4.7815699658703075

6897862,4,B00R1OHSXA,"It's a really good supernatural movie. The suspense was taunt and most of the occurrences were believable. Some of the film was even rooted in fact. In Europe some Catholic Churches were built on sites that pagan's used for their own religious purposes. When excavation work was done sometimes they would actually find objects and such that were used by the previous religious practitioners. In the movie Final Prayer the church was built on a special site and there was basically hell to pay when the Catholic Church had worked on it and reopened it as a functioning Parish Church after being shut down for almost 100 years. I really liked the movie, except for the very ending which I consider as ""far fetched."" So, I rated it a four.

6897864,5,B00R1OHSXA,"No, this movie is not better than sex. It is one helluva horror flick though. Genuinely scary and well-acted found footage flick about a team of Vatican-hired investigators who try to disprove a miracle claim in an old Scottish church in the countryside. No spoilers here, but what they find is worlds away from holiness or miracles. I won't delve into the marrow of the plot, but file Final Prayer away with films like The Last Exorcist and Paranormal Activity. This one has enough frightening moments, creepy locations, and strange characters to satisfy the appetite of any found footage fan. That old, creaky floored, stone-structured church in the Scottish countryside makes for one super effective horror movie locations. This unholy stone-and-wood realm is dripping with wicked vibes and demonic atmosphere.

What ""shaky cam"" fans love so much about this genre is how the really good entries (REC, The Tunnel, Trollhunter) make you feel like you're right there in the middle of all the terrifying action. Final Prayer does exactly that. You come to care about the leads Mark and Deacon because you feel like you're stuck in that haunted church with them. There is a heavy sense of dread that permeates the church scenes. I won't spoil anything here, but there's a tinge of surrealism in the final scenea literal portrayal of the phrase ""belly of the beast"". Claustrophobes beware!

Like all good FF films, Final Prayer is far from perfect. There's the typical slow-moving middle section where the story and drama builds a bit, and there's some recycled tropes that any POV horror get will recognize immediately. That said, none of this ever drags the movie down to tedium or awfulness. For me, the sign of a good film is one I can watch over and over again through the years. This is one of those. It's definitely one of my favorite found footage films, and if you appreciate the subgenre like I do, you'll dig it too.

6897880,4,B00R1OHSXA,"I'm a sucker for found footage horror, though I will freely admit it is an overused gimmick and has resulted in some pretty terrible movies. I had heard about The Borderlands (released in North America as Final Prayer, I assume to avoid confusion with the Borderlands video game) from British film critic Mark Kermode, who said his disdain for found footage horror did not stop the film from scaring him. I was intrigued, but a delayed US release kept my options limited, outside of paying $$$ for a region 2 DVD.

As they say, all good things to those who wait. Final Prayer is a creepy and often genuinely frightening horror movie. It is technically found footage, but is shot in a clever way so as to downplay that aspect, so people who are sick to death of that subgenre can still enjoy it just as a straight horror movie.

With less of a reliance on jump scares and more effort put into creating atmosphere through sound design, strong performances and a solid screenplay, this is the rare horror film that takes its time developing and creates an atmosphere of malevolence and dread that builds and builds until the intense finale. There are multiple surprises along the way and plenty of effective scares.

Highly recommended. It has its clunky moments, but works well for most of its running time. Warning to people with claustrophobia: the last few minutes may freak you out.",1445126400,3,1384,4.710743801652892

Although it occasionally falls back on tired old jump-scares, it makes up for it  with characters who are actually interesting, and an ending which I didn't see coming, and as an HP Lovecraft fan, left me with a huge smile on my face.
I'm a bit puzzled why this gets so many negative ratings, while stuff like Paranormal Activities go on the become hits. I guess this film needed more CGI ghosts. But if you're the sort who's frightened just thinking about the notion of being alone on the woods at night, or strange sounds in an old deserted house, or are just a fan of HPL who doesn't require rubber monsters tapdancing across the screen to be frightened, then this is one for you.",1444348800,,822,4.48

6897898,4,B00R1OHSXA,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I first heard about FINAL PRAYER (aka The Borderlands) a couple of months ago while perusing the Internet for horror lists; yes, Im one of those geeky folks who like to hear what others think, and Best/Worst Lists are a great place to hear about obscure film titles.  The particular list this film occupied was 10 Goriest Film Scenes Ever.  FINAL PRAYER made it to #9 because of its ending scenes, which DO make your cringealthough Im not sure I would classify them as part of the 10 Goriest Film Scenes Ever.  Still, they pack a punch, and when combined with the rest of the film, they offer a chilling end to a creepy and haunting movie.

I know the found footage sub-genre of horror is saturated with titles, both good and bad.  But this film definitely deserves to be on the Good list.  Granted, its not perfect, but its close.

FINAL PRAYER is shot fairly well for a found footage film and looks good overall.  I particularly like the church location.  This foreboding structure exudes an air of menace at first sight, and it is the perfect place for unholy events to unfold.

The acting is pretty good, with Gordon Kennedy and Robin Hill portraying the main characters.  Both give decent performances, however I cannot say they are outstanding.  Hills character (Gray) is a little over the top, while Kennedys Deacon is almost too stoic to be believable.  Still, they are both passable as damaged characters who experience a terrifying situation.

The storyline in FINAL PRAYER is intense and horrifying.  After a bit of a slow start, the movie picks up about halfway in and takes the viewer on a heck of trip into terror.  The resulting climax is satisfying for the most part, however I will say it is a bit rushed.  The viewer also has to read into previous implications to completely grasp what is happening.  I sorta knew what was going on because of the list I mentioned earlier, however I can see where confusion might creep in for someone not paying attention.

I really enjoyed FINAL PRAYER, though, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a decent found footage flick.  The film is available now in a variety of media forms if you decide to give it a look.",1434412800,2,2245,4.576441102756892

The set dressing leaves a lot to be desired.  It is supposed to be a Catholic Church yet there are no crucifixes, the alter is not a proper high alter, and there is one portion of a wall filled with books.  Pretty lame.
The special effects are almost comical EXCEPT one quick moment, blink and you miss it, where the name on a tombstone changes to one of the characters then back again.

After I rented the movie, I purchased it as well. I looked for a movie called The Borderlands, or Borderlands. There is nothing I can find that shows the same cover art as this movie, or is even close to this movie in description. From what I read I also wanted to watch that one.
The end without saying anything to spoil it was something I hope to God I never encounter, nor would I wish my fellow humans including clergy will never have to experience. I was chilled to the bone.
If Im going to watch these types of movies, I like good ones, not the normal garbage cult stuff that is out there. Besides this one, the Exorcist and the Exorcism of Emily Rose were the best I've seen. I usually write things when I don't like something.

It's not anything Id go out of my way to recommend, but it was worth the rental. There are a few fun thrills, and overall the sense of realism was quite good (thanks in no small part to the very decent acting performances).

I think one of the reasons why the movie works is becasue you get major character development between the two protagnonists in the movie, atomosphere and timing. Everything plays out convincingly. There are places you just shouldn't be which leads me to say the movie is scary as hell. And I don't say that about horror movies so know this is worth you time, that's if you go for the whole paranoral, found-footage, horror type stuff.",1424736000,5,652,4.873873873873874

Not bad starts slow at first, an entire crew who went to investigate an old church disappear without a trace. Then some Portuguese people go to the church looking to see what they can find, while the others are searching one guy finds a small camcorder hidden behind bricks in a wall other stuff is also discovered. Later on a new crew is sent to the same church to investigate both the disappearance of the previous group and the supernatural goings on, while there really scary events and things begin to manifest. After hearing a baby crying one guy pulls down a bookcase behind it finds a hidden door and opens it

Okay the short dude with the glasses annoyed the hell out of me, why? Because he's a jerk giving the other guys a hard time and making false accusations,against them. An older priest from the Vatican in Rome is sent there after more drastic events take place, during the priests prayers there;s a violent supernatural reaction proving sir Mouthalot as I call the short guy wrong. This leads to them going under the church to find the missing priest where they make an epically horrible discovery leading to the grand finally which will make you say oh my God",1424304000,12,1429,4.471264367816092

8693713,3,B00R1OHSXA,"This could have been a great contribution to the found footage genre if only the screenwriter had any inkling how to carry a story to its logical conclusion. Everything but the last 10-15 minutes was great: solid acting, good scares, an incredibly creepy premise. And then that last few minutes happened and I thought, ""Wait; what? Am I even watching the same movie? Did someone splice the end of a cheesy YouTube Blair Witch ripoff onto a film that held such promise even five minutes ago?"" By the time it was over, the gaping hole in the plot (how was the footage recovered?) didn't even matter. I simply stopped caring.

I got some Descent and As Above So Below vibes from it. The movie never really tells you what was haunting the church and I appreciate that. It makes it creepier and intriguing. They did a good job at being creepy without using any cheap jump scares and loud sounds.

I decided to give this movie a chance, and the way the movie was shot did not bother me like most found footage films do. So I will at least say it was done reasonably well. The film was fairly interesting at the beginning, but after a while the story felt like it wasn't really going anywhere. By the end, I felt like it had been a waste of time. I think this film had potential, but the meandering middle and ending that left a lot to be desired ruined it for me.",1510358400,,546,4.11214953271028
8693716,5,B00R1OHSXA,"I really liked the movie.
It's not fancy. It's not a super fast moving action/horror flick.
It's a story about some priests and a tech guy who are sent to check out the report of a miracle at a backwoods church. The suspense builds up slowly and the ""horror"" comes in bits and pieces as the story unfolds. The friendship that develops between the men includes some pretty good humor too.
The ending sure took me by surprise. I was yelped out loud and found myself, literally, cringing and pushing away from the tele screen with my feet.
The acting was great. Not one flawed performance. They all did a great job.
If you're the kind of movie goer that needs constant special effects and action, you won't like this movie.
The pace of Final Prayer reminds me of the 1963 classic, ""The Haunting"" (with Julie Harris, written by Shirley Jackson).
It might move slow but it winds up blowing your mind.",1503100800,,895,4.530864197530864

God and satan are real, and even non-believers have their day of reckoning. This movie may disturb you and it is definitely not for a younger audience. Highly recommended!",1491523200,,441,4.95945945945946
