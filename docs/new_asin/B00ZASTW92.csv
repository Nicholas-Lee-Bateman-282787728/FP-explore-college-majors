7274996,5,B00ZASTW92,One of the best new shows from 2014/2015 TV season,1441324800,,50,4.1
7274997,5,B00ZASTW92,Couldn't wait for this to come out.  It's my new favorite show!!,1441324800,,64,4.333333333333333
7274998,5,B00ZASTW92,Great show.  It and Big Bang Theory have been my mainstays.  It is so enjoyable watching Intelligent people being portrayed and celebrated.  It is my personal opinion that violent dummies get way too much time on TV and in movies.,1441324800,17,230,4.7
7274999,5,B00ZASTW92,"Thanks Amazon For The BluRay, Arrived 2 days after release date 2/9/15 to me in the uk :) love the tv show and bluray :)",1441152000,,120,3.84
7275000,5,B00ZASTW92,"Love, love, love this show!  Sooo ready for season 2 to start!  Lightning fast shipping too!  The only thing that could've made this DVD set better would've been a play all function on the episode selection!
Update:  I don't know about anyone else, but my ultraviolet copy doesn't work, in spite of several emails to paramount.",1441065600,3,327,4.785714285714286
7275001,5,B00ZASTW92,"I love this show.  I don't know if I could legitimately say that any one particular thing about it is fantastic.  The writing, acting, directing, characters, plot, etc are all very good in my opinion, but when added all together it makes for a show that is better than the sum of it's parts.  At least that's my opinion.  It was by far my favorite new show this season and immediately became one of my favorite shows period.  Which is saying a lot for a person who watches and enjoys as much television as I do.  I hope anyone reading this review that might not have seen it decides to watch, and then if you do, I hope that you like it as much as I do.  In a time where quality shows keep cycling through CBS, and even to a smaller extent ABC and FOX, when those shows are great and would no doubt have multi year runs, on NBC, but just don't quite pull in the right numbers, it is nice that one of the shows I like seems to have really caught some traction.  It really is too bad sometimes though that the fate of a show can depend on what network it lands on.  A bit off topic, but the point is, this show is strong enough to make it anywhere.  Enjoy.",1440633600,,1154,4.066371681415929
7275002,5,B00ZASTW92,"My husband really pressed for us to watch this show when it first came out.  I wasn't sold on the idea until I watched the first episode.  Each show is action-packed and the cast is both believable and work well together.

Each of the members of Scorpion (the group of geniuses who work together on various missions throughout the show), have been friends for a while and each has their own area of expertise and their own set of quirks.  By the end of the first show, the government has asked the group to assist them on special tasks and the group Scorpion is born.

Walter O'Brien (Elyes Gabel) is the head of the group and has an extremely high IQ.  He seems to have expertise in most fields but especially computers and programming.  Toby Curtis (Eddie Kaye Thomas) is a psychiatrist who helps get inside the mind and emotions of both the victims and the villains.  Happy Quinn (Jadyn Wong) is a mechanical genius and Toby has real feelings for her but she is has trust issues.  Sylvester Dodd (Ari Stidham) is a human calculator.  He can put together odds, probabilities, can access various angles and other issues to come up with solutions time and time again.  Joining this group is Paige and Ralph Dineen (Katherine McPhee and Riley B. Smith) a mother and son group who stumbles across this eclectic team.  Paige is the person who helps them communicate with real people (an issue they all have except maybe Toby) and Ralph is her son who is also a boy genius like Walter was at the same age.  Cabe Gallow (Robert Patrick) is the group's government liaison.

It has been fun watching the characters develop throughout the first season - finding out more about their past and their personal lives.  I'm looking forward to seeing more in the future but this first season is one that I highly recommend so you can get a good introduction to each of the characters.",1439856000,26,1870,4.573573573573573

7275012,5,B00ZASTW92,"We've fallen in love with this series which is sort of a McGyver-ish with multiple McGyvers.  A couple of the main characters wear on my patience at times. Particularly in Season 2, the far-fetched 'science' & action scenes should come with a disclaimer in case some idiot should try any of these stunts themselves (like running around in sub-zero temps without gloves, unzipped jackets etc). But overall, the shows are entertaining & a great alternative to the current group of horror, reality, thug and drama shows.",1510272000,,517,5.011627906976744

7275016,3,B00ZASTW92,I bought this because I love Scorpion.  It also says that it comes with a ultra violet digital copy which it does.  However the ultra violet copy is not tied what so ever with vudu or any other service that will allow you to easily watch it via a tv.  No instead you must either log into the Ultra violet website or use the dvd's to watch.  So annoyed I would have just bought it from a service if I had known this.,1508198400,,415,3.963855421686747

7275022,5,B00ZASTW92,"I think the point of these reviews for physical copies of films or TV shows is really for packaging and possibly the different (special) features that may come with different ""prints"" of said movies or shows.

7275070,5,B00ZASTW92,"Having watched Seasons 1 and 2 multiple times and watched the Season 3 episodes to date, Season 1 is significantly better.  Better, tighter writing.  A clear plan as to how to introduce and develop the main characters plus one-timer characters who help provide backstory.  In other words, they knew it could be be a one-and-done series and were willing to take risks that paid off.  One risk they wisely avoided was relying on the young geniuses plus one young ""norm"" to carry the series.  Bringing in Robert Patrick was excellent casting.  Unfortunately, his authority figure/wise man role has largely been reduced to quips.",1479340800,6,625,5.019417475728155

7275080,4,B00ZASTW92,"I found out about the show in an article in the Atlantic (i don't have a TV). The article argues that our society glorifies high IQ. It may be partially true but there are actually very few shows about smart people. The idea here is not super original. It's MacGyver (improvising) meets Numb3rs (math genius plus the Feds) meets Big Bang Theory (nerds plus a ""normal"" person), meets The Bridge (protagonists with psychological issues).

As a chemical engineer with computer experience and borderline Aspergers, once accepted to a PhD program in mathematics, i can relate to the characters. It's fun to be able figure out if the ideas presented in the show would actually work. Many probably wouldn't but it's OK if the show encourages young people to pursue STEM subjects. The show could probably benefit from having a science a consultant (like Big Bang Theory) or from crows-sourcing ideas (like MacGyver and The Martian). I will be wiling to contribute. There are some story gaps filled in by razzle-dazzle editing. Oh, quoting IQ as 197, at the end of the tail value, is a bit silly. In 180-200 range, or as a percentile, would make more sense. For those interested in improvising solutions, i recommend my book Become an Inventor:

7275099,5,B00ZASTW92,"Scorpion is a series loosely based on the life of real life genius Walter O'Brien and his think tank of prodigies.  It is, at its core a case of the week procedural, much like many other shows, but in ways very different.  It is action heavy, but it is based around a group whose minds are their skill set.  The cast, for the most part is made up of relatively unknown actors, with Robert Patrick and Eddie Kaye Thomas being the most recognizable, followed by Katherine McPhee.  Patrick plays Homeland Security agent Cabe Gallo, who has a history with Walter from when Walter was a child.  The government ends up hiring Walter's company, Scorpion, to help with cases that only they can figure out.

The other characters are a Psychologist, Toby (played by Eddie Kaye Thomas) a Mathematical prodigy with OCD named Sylvester, and an engineering marvel named Happy (who is anything but).  By a series of events set up in the pilot, they are joined by a waitress (McPhee) who is raising a genius son.  She helps them interact with normal people, and they help her understand her son.  The larger story arcs of the season deal with character development and character relationships.  I think it does really well balancing the larger arcs with the story of the week aspect, to keep it from getting too formulaic, or giving away too much.

The show prides itself on being scientifically accurate, while taking some liberties to make it exciting.  The real Walter O'Brien is a producer on the show, and if you watch the DVD extras, the show runners detail how they lean on him and other experts to get as much right as they can.  It is easily the kind of material that could make a show way too boring if not done right, and they definitely toe that line well.

As for the extras for those who do get the DVD set, there are commentary tracks on a couple episodes and deleted scenes for a handful of episodes. Then there are numerous behind the scenes and making of features, a gag reel, and a short cast thank you to the fans for supporting the show.  All in all, probably a good couple hours worth of extras if you like going through the material.  If you are generally a fan of the procedural shows like Bones, Hawaii Five-0, NCIS etc, then this is definitely worth checking out.",1464998400,4,2273,4.534313725490196

7275120,4,B00ZASTW92,"Ok, so this is a show developed by a megalomaniac con artist. It is full of nerd stereotypes, all while providing completely implausible solutions that don't have any basis in reality. In other words, it's  condescending to the intelligent while clearly having been written by sub-genius writers. Nerds HATE it. Many of the horrible reviews have some boast about their own IQ and how they felt they were insulted. Sure, you can tell right away that the 'based on true events' is rubbish....doesn't take a genius to figure that out, much less a quick Google search on Walter O'Brian. Just the sense to know that's always the case with that claim.

Not what the show is. It's explosions. Terribly underdeveloped references to science, tech, physics. Adequate enough acting to be watchable, and completely unrealistic in every way. And the mechanic lady's voice cracks me up. Super-fun mindless nonsense. What's not to love? If you want to be mentally challenged, you are looking in the wrong place in prime time tv.

7275138,4,B00ZASTW92,"This is a fun action/humor/romance/problem-solving show to watch. It's family-friendly down to about 12 years of age (very, very little language, no nudity, and fights are ""clean"" rather than ultra-realistic (i.e. gory)). I have a ""nerdy"" background in math and physics, so I love the little ""in"" jokes, though you don't need a background in anything in particular to enjoy it.

I like to watch it to decompress. The actors are very good at making you believe in their characters, and I like the way the characters emphasize friendship and loyalty. It's not at the overall quality level of ""Major Crimes"" or ""Inspector Lewis"" - those shows are 5-star examples of perfection - but ""Scorpion"" doesn't have a lot of angst, or brutality, sordidness, or other things found in more ""realistic"" shows.

7275167,5,B00ZASTW92,"This is a series about a team of geniuses solving challenging crime, investigation, or rescue cases/missions. Each person has their own unique expertise, yet personal flaws and struggles. In the back plot, they struggle connecting to mainstream society. The cases are given through a government agent with a personal, paternal, connection to the leading main character. However, Scorpion is an independent group, who importantly support each other throughout the show. Right at the beginning, a ""mainstream"" female character is added to provide further help and the understanding of normal society. Also, she has a young genius son that team is helping her understand him. As the show evolves, relationships (and the related issues) develop between certain characters.

I would rated the show at PG. Scorpion is a mix of drama, some comedy, and action. Intellectually, this is designed for adults and older children. I don't think children would full grasp what is going on. (Either way, you won't have to run to the TV in dismay if your child accidently flips to the show.) The casting and scrip is excellent. The show and plot lines are smooth and not chopped up. Each episode has its own story, twists and upcoming parts you could only vaguely guess. The dramatic scenes are performed cleanly and with some reality. The main characters are more realist than many shows, such as their looks and personalities. Foul language is not used. What excellence all in one package. Originally, I missed out on some of the original airings of the episodes. Later I was binge watching and enjoying each episode of the series.",1447718400,2,1616,5.052434456928839

These characters really grow on you, and they're not all perfect, they're not even all pretty, which is extremely refreshing on a TV show. I myself get tired of the shows where pretty people have problems. You also learn tons(!!!!) of information within each episode and being a person who struggles with math and science, lets just say that if they had taught me the way this series does I would have grown to love science and math. You even learn about human behavior from Toby, how to fight from Cabe, and how to be a ""normal"" human being from Paige.

7275193,4,B00ZASTW92,"For a bunch of nerds, these folks get into a lot of fights.
And the fact that they do makes ""Scorpion, Season 1"" highly entertaining as its genius-level characters get thrown into some very intriguing - and dangerous - situations. One can only hope that the powers that be decide to let the writers of this show get a chance to really develop the characters further in a second and - hopefully - third season.
The series revolves around some super-smart geeks who have banded together to form a company that works with businesses that have run into some serious problems. Despite the fact that Team Scorpion - the name of the company - never fails to solve those problems it is barely surviving financially because most of the businesses it works with are small and can't afford to pay very much for its services. That's about to change when the government steps in and offers it a lucrative contract to solve problems so big and so complex that they are all but unsolvable, at least by ordinary people. The problem is that the government's point man is not someone company president Walter O'Brien trusts. He has good reason not to: Years before Agent Cabe Gallo, who works for the Department of Homeland Security, betrayed O'Brien by using technology that he invented for purposes it was not intended. The result: 2,000 Iraqi civilians died. Because of that O'Brien wants to refuse to work with Gallo or the federal government but comes around when his team of misfits - including a woman with serious anger management issues and a compulsive gambler - point out that the business is on the verge of collapse. O'Brien reluctantly agrees to accept the contract and that leads him and his team into a series of global adventures.
The ensemble cast is first rate and includes Elyes Gabel as O'Brien, Robert Patrick as Gallo and singer Katharine McPhee as a former waitress recruited by the team of socially inept geniuses to ""interface"" with the general public. The writing is crisp and the narrative has just enough angst in it to keep the show's episodes moving along without going overboard.
All in all, an excellent start to what I, for one, hope will be a long-running series about smart people doing important work.",1445126400,6,2220,4.753886010362694

Unlike it's fellow CBS show CSI:Cyber it's not too smart for it's own good.  The science doesn't go over your head and because Paige is there a lot of the science is explained in a very good way.  There's a lot of comedy that makes it hugely enjoyable to watch.  The characters are awesome.  And there's a crossover episode where Hetty from NCISLA helps them out and that's one of the best episodes.
This is just about the best new show to come out of CBS in a long, long time.  This is a fantastic show and I highly recommend it to, well, everyone.",1444176000,2,702,4.403100775193798

7275215,5,B00ZASTW92,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

While I love the whole ensemble concept in series these days Im concerned that at some point it will seem to standard to work. That hasn't happened yet but it could easily become that way with the number of shows working that formula. That being said at the moment Im still happy with several series in that mode and this is one of them.

Walter OBrien (Elyes Gabel) is an eccentric genius, devoid of emotion but able to think things through faster and in more depth than any normal person. His current line of work is solving problems for people with a team of other genius outcasts like himself. The team includes Toby Curtis (Eddie Kaye Thomas), a brilliant psychiatric specialist who is a behaviorist but with a gambling addiction hes in the midst of conquering. Then there is Happy Quinn (Jadyn Wong), an engineering prodigy who also happens to have an anger issue she tends to solve with physical confrontation. Lastly in this group is Sylvester Dodd (Ari Stidham), a mathematical and computer whiz who has social skills problems. The team isn't doing well when the show starts but their fortunes soon change.

Thats because into their life walks Agent Cabe Gallo (Robert Patrick) who works for Homeland Security. Gallo and Walter have a past together. It was Gallo who arrested Walter when he was a young child and had hacked NASA. He became a father figure to Walter helping him through those troubled times and keeping him out of prison. But something happened that brought about a rift in their relationship, something that works its way out before the end of season one. When the show begins though, Gallo walks into the teams headquarters and offers them a job working as consultants for Homeland Security. It pays well, offers them a chance to work with great equipment and stay solvent, but Walter is hesitant.

The team votes and agrees to the job and each week following is called upon to stop some crime or catastrophic event from happening. The types of aid the team offers to Homeland Security more often than not involves some technical situation that require knowledge only their expertise can handle. These items range from communications being shut down on all airplanes in the Los Angeles area to the internet infrastructure being attacked with the intent of collapsing it to a mole within the CIA. Each week the team takes on a different task.

Another item it tossed into the mix which is the fact that this group of socially awkward geniuses have trouble relating to people out in the field. A chance encounter at the local diner where Walter has fixed the internet for the owner finds him discovering that a waitress there named Paige Dineen (Katherine McPhee) has a young son named Ralph (Riley B. Smith) who reminds Walter of himself at that age, a child genius misdiagnosed as having problems when the truth is he is brilliant. It doesnt hurt that Walter just might also find himself attracted to Paige but having never been in touch with his emotions hes not quite sure of what is going on. When the time comes to get someone to take on the liaison task, Walter gets Cabe to recruit Paige. The healthy jump in pay coupled with allowing her son to be around others like himself makes her acceptance of the job a no brainer.

With all of the characters in place and numerous reasons to save the world set in motion the series kicks off. Everyone should be happy, including the critics right? Well maybe not. Many found this show to over the top and unbelievable to accept. Moments seemed cartoonish to them. For those critics I say hogwash. The show was made not to be a blueprint on how to set up Homeland Security. It was made to have fun, to offer adventure coupled with brains instead of a team that just opens fire at the first sign of trouble.
The show harkens back to another well received series that the critics were never overly fond of either, MACGUYVER. That show lasted for some time and then went into movie of the week mode. It was a fan favorite. And SCORPION seems to be following in its footsteps with better than average ratings for a new series. Season two is already being filmed.

If you find that the elements mentioned in this review peek your interest, if you think that a show that has fun and heart is one that you might like to watch then I highly recommend this one. Not only do we get to see the development of characters from week to week, we get to see a group of people that have grown into a family of their own as well as grow accustomed to the newer members with each episode. And while they're saving the world the odds are that something along the way will be new to you as well, a method used to save the world might teach you something too. With the wasteful number of shows on TV these days this becomes a good thing. Who knows, you might find yourself watching season two the day it begins airing after watching this one.",1443484800,3,4949,4.566441441441442

8719695,3,B00ZASTW92,"While I am fascinated by the characters and the interactions, the absurdity of the plots is too much.  I had hoped for something that involved scientific accuracy and believability.  This does not.  I suppose the effects are good for those who want that.  And the characters really are enjoyable.  I just hate that they feel the need to take storylines that are only barely feasible to start with to such absurd extremes.  Especially ridiculous is the time limit factor.  They are ALWAYS on a tight deadline and yet manage to win at the last minute.  Nevermind that you can't actually travel that quickly or that computers don't always process that quickly.  It's just too much for someone like me.  Get a better group of science advisors to keep it on track and this would be a really good show.",1528416000,,796,4.661870503597123

8719697,5,B00ZASTW92,"I love this show its soooo good and there are so many things you could do with it. The writing is creative and fun. The relationships are deep and complex. The characters are always evolving and have complex feelings towards one another. The Walter and Paige relationship in particular is fascinating. They love each other but the don't satisfy each other. Toby and Happy are modern and have a relationship that is real. They fight but also work together to figure out solutions to their problems.
This show is entertaining and fun. Its is very unrealistic and contains plenty of incorrect information, but is is always interesting to see how they get out of their sticky situations.

This show is fantastic and has plenty of potential for it to evolve into anything. Im incredibly surprised that it is being canceled by CBS. I only how another network picks it up. (HINT. HINT. WINK. WINK.)  Im looking at you Amazon and Netflix!
You have a diverse cast and a group of characters whos stories aren't finished yet.

Please help Scorpion.",1527724800,,1037,4.782122905027933
