8055117,5,B00080Z68I,"I thought this was a cute murder mystery that was very enjoyable to watch.  Loved seeing George Hamilton in it and of course Justine Bateman.  If you are looking for something that is just fun to watch, I recommend The Hollywood Mom's Mystery.  Wish this had been the start of a new series.",1469232000,,290,4.433962264150943

8055119,5,B00080Z68I,I actually love this movie. I love everything I've seen Justine Bateman in. It's not an award winning movie but it's casual with a fun mystery kind of story and Justine is great as the main character.,1429747200,,200,4.4324324324324325

8055122,3,B00080Z68I,"Good light tv mystery. It was nice to see Justine Bateman again, This is not a movie to go to theatre for but it is a good TV movie. A littlle predictable but a good view.",1366588800,,171,3.7777777777777777
8055123,1,B00080Z68I,"I have 3 words for those who are thinking of buying this movie: save your money!

  Justine Bateman, who was so good and so cute as Mallory Keaton in ""Family Ties"" made a bad choice when she agreed to star in this bomb. It is badly written, amateurishly directed, choppy and disconnected. It goes from slow all the way to boring! The plot is thin, the dialogue worse.

  Andrew McCarthy has almost a bit part in this waste of film, as Bateman's husband. Actually, he provides the best single scene in the whole sloppy thing, when Bateman dreams that her husband (McCarthy) is trying to kill her. He is fully menacing and intense, and this is the only good scene to be found anywhere in this nonsense.

  The beginning is not so good, the ending is predictable and, well - boring!

  I repeat: Save your money.",1155427200,4,809,4.465753424657534
