8074076,5,B000A3DGHQ,"Anchor Bay made Fright Packs containing six movies looking like beer. The different packs are Devil Made Me Do It(The Antichrist, The Church, Hell Night, Fear No Evil, Curse of the Devil, To the Devil a Daughter), Man's Worst Friends(Rats, Zoltan, Cat O' Nine Tails, Slugs, The Black Cat, Parasite), Campy Classics(Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, Return of the Killer Tomatoes, Transylvania 6-5000, Return to Horror High, Sleepaway Camp, Vamp) and Walking Dead(City of the Living Dead, Nightmare City, House by the Cemetery, Hell of the Living Dead, Let Sleeping Corpses Lie, Dead Heat). The only pack in print as of now is Campy Classics. The other packs have some films now either on Blue Underground, other distributors, or thoroughly discontinued as of now.

I purchased a used Walking Dead Fright Pack since the price was right and the opportunity was rare. Again the Walking Dead pack is out of print but only five out of the six movies or beers contained are discontinued by Anchor Bay. The only loss from the pack was House by the Cemetery because I already have House by the Cemetery. However, the gain is the other House by the Cemetery I have is a public domain version by Diamond Entertainment. That version is inferior to Anchor Bay's House by the Cemetery. I'll explain more later.

I'll review the six beers in this pack. Some were very intoxicating by the gore content by volume. Anchor Bay does say on the pack ""Enjoy responsibly..."" Note that gore is not always the merrier to enjoy each beer.

The Beers:

CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD: Brewed by master Lucio Fulci. A medium(Catriona MacColl) channels a priest who hangs himself in a isolated New England town. The medium dies by sheer fright. A reporter(Christopher George) is writing on the story for the paper but when he visits the medium's partially buried grave, the buried medium mysteriously gains consciousness. After the reporter opens the coffin and releases the medium, she reveals the suicidal priest opened the gates of hell and he's back from the dead. The priest is killing the living by his deadly psychokinetic stares or one-handed scalpings thus recruiting them as demonic zombies with similar telepathy. Others in the film are Giovanni Lombardo Radice as the town's ill-fated pervert, Janet Agren as a psychiatric client, and Carlo De Mejo as the town psychiatrist. CITY was the weakest in Fulci's Gates of Hell trilogy but not necessarily in a bad way. CITY's plot and literary elements were too unclear. The ending style was a first for me and I hated it. CITY is one of those open to interpretation films that doesn't have enough clues for an interpretation. However, the scares and shocks are good and the movie is worth watching again to search for more clues. The gore is over the top and nauseating. The purge scene was hard to watch. I had to mute it halfway so I'd stop gagging. Beware because gorehounds only. 3 and a half stars/Five! 75 percent gore content by volume, goes down quezzy.

NIGHTMARE CITY: Umberto Lenzi made this zombie movie though he denies the creatures were zombies but whatever. A military plane does an emergency landing at an airport and the passengers from the plane start killing people. A reporter(Hugo Stiglitz) catches the shock on camera but is barred from reporting it. The reporter and his wife are on the run after it's too late for the living to be aware of the dead on time. The movie is blamed as being a Dawn of the Dead(1978) ripoff but actually not at all or very little. Where is the mall? Where is the SWAT team? Since when did DotD zombies run, jump, and hide? Since when did DotD zombies use bladed instruments with surgical precision and shoot with dead-aim? NIGHTMARE CITY may have Dawn of the Dead inspirations but it shouldn't be labeled as a strong and direct ripoff. NIGHTMARE CITY is a fun, energenic, and under-rated movie with some flaws. The gore was plentiful but overfaked mostly. The gore looked cheap as if comical and the blood in some scenes looked worthy of ridicule. The gore scene in the basement was very brutal and realistic. The makeup was awful. The masks were cheap and improperly concealed. Do I recommend it? Yes, but for gorehounds, Lenzi lovers, and zombiholics. 3.8 stars/5! 70 percent gore content by volume, goes down smooth.

HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY: Again with another Fulci brew. A family moves into a New England fixer-upper. The patriarch(Paolo Malco) is a researcher and the wife(Catriona MacColl) is a housewife. Though we know the house hides an unseen murderer, the son(Giovanni Frezza) begins a friendship with a girl's friendly spirit who tells him to leave at once but his parents are skeptical. HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY is better than CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD and about as good as The Beyond. HOUSE is not all too clear as well and hard to interpret but the clues are the easiest to understand compared to The Beyond and CITY. The movie is clearly a ripoff or homage to The Shining and The Amityville Horror because of the writing guy, his housewife, telepathic son, and previous owner who committed homicide/suicide. Not as gory as CITY and The Beyond but still one of Fulci's goriest films. Not for everyone. The Anchor Bay and Blue Underground versions of HOUSE are better than the Diamond Entertainment version. The Diamond version is missing the extras and the graphics are less restored. The Diamond version is decently restored and uncut/uncensored but the Anchor Bay and Blue Underground versions are better in extras and graphics. Four and a half/Five! 70 percent gore content by volume, goes down in-between.

DEAD HEAT: A horror-comedy cop buddy beer with Treat Williams and Joe Piscopo. Roger Mortis(Treat Williams) and Doug Bigelow(Joe Piscopo) are a team of loose cannon detectives. Roger plays by the book but resorts to vigilantism when the book isn't working and Doug is a wiseguy who has his own book. Roger and Doug go against orders and eccentrically stop an armed robbery. The robbers turn out to be previously dead, even had past autopsies before the robbery. The detectives go to a chemical company that manufacture a suspect chemical found in the robbers. The two find and are attacked by a creature. Roger is hit and falls in a activated decompression chamber thus killed. Doug and Roger's ex-girlfriend coroner reanimate Roger back to life. Roger denies being dead but realizes he's decomposing. Roger and Doug must find the creator of the machine before he completely decomposes. DEAD HEAT is a very funny movie. Joe Piscopo's sarcastic humor is endless. Darren McGavin plays a lead, aged Vicent Price has a small but over-publicized role, and short appearence by Toru Tanaka. Good movie to watch with friends. Four/Five! 6 percent gore content by volume, goes down flat and watered down(not in bad way).

LET SLEEPING CORPSES LIE(The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue): A Spanish brew inspired by Night of the Living Dead. Two travellers George and Edna(Ray Lovelock and Christine Galbo) are passing through rural England. George finds a prototype machine being used to kill insects using invisible waves. George wonders what it could do to humans. The dead are coming to life and killing people. George and Edna are suspects to the killings and are being pursued by a detective(Arthur Kennedy) who'll stop at nothing. LET SLEEPING CORPSES LIE is very atmospheric. Very dark and spooky. Don't look for a total zombie armageddon with social policy thrown out. Not much zombies compared to other zombie movies because throughout the movie, it's only the beginning and only localized. Four and (3/4)/5 stars! 40 percent gore content by volume, goes down in-between.

HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD: Bruno Mattei's brew that tastes too much like Dawn of the Dead. A chemical leak at a plant kills the workers but the workers get back up and kill. Meanwhile, a SWAT team infiltrates a building with hostages being held by environmental extremists. The SWAT team eliminate the threat and are put on a new mission. The SWAT team go to Papa New Guinea and encounter a woman and a cameraman being attacked by zombies at a Christian mission. The woman is an anthropologist and goes to a tribe but zombies attack. The group are looking for the chemical plant for answers and survivers. This movie was ridiculous. It was one of the cheesiest and most unoriginal stuff. The movie is a ripoff of Dawn of the Dead. A woman and her cameraman boyfriend. The SWAT team wear blue suits(same ones). A daredevil SWAT member(sound familiar?). Same exact score from Dawn of the Dead(not kidding). Aside from ripoff, HELL has stock footage from mondo films. Showing animals and gruesome footage like field dressing and strange burial rites. The gore is way over the top. The gore was carefully crafted and well done. The last gore set piece is shocking and graphic. Is the movie bad? YES, it is but the movie wasn't meant to be good and it is still fun to watch. Bruno Mattei will remind you as if he's an Italian Ed Wood. Three and three-quarters/Five stars! 85 percent gore content by volume, goes down quezzy and potent.

I love my Fright Pack and the beers, I mean movies. I was glad to get six movies in the box set because the price is half what the movies would cost in total seperately.",1276732800,,9262,4.826826196473552
8074077,3,B000A3DGHQ,"All right movies for the money, nothing special. I like Zombie movies, so the six pack was pretty good deal.",1216857600,,108,4.45
8074078,5,B000A3DGHQ,"These are my ratings for the following six (6) movies out of five (5) stars: HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD, City of the Living Dead, The House By The Cemetery, Nightmare City, Let the Sleeping Corpses Lie, and Dead Heat. All God save me please.......from these flesh-eating zombies!!!!

HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD (1984)- 3.5 -Directed by Bruno Mattei, After a chemical leak at the Hope Centre in Papua New Guinea (an organisation devoted to feeding underdeveloped countries) turns its staff into flesh-eating zombies, a four-man commando squad led by Mike London are sent to investigate. They run into a TV news crew led by celebrity reporter Lea, who are after the same story, but when they discover that the entire country has been overrun by zombies, what are the chances of them getting the message across? Unlike most zombie films, this actually tries to make a serious point - that if we don't feed the Third World, they'll come and feed on us!

City of the Living Dead (1983)- 4.0 -Directed by Lucio Fulci, In the small New England town of Dunwich, a priest commits suicide by hanging himself in the church cemetary which somehow opens the gates of hell allowing the dead to rise. Peter, a New York City reporter, teams up with a young psychic, named Mary, to travel to the town where they team up with another couple, psychiatrist Jerry and patient Sandra, to find a way to close the gates before All Saints Day or the dead all over the world will rise up and kill the living.

The House By The Cemetery (1984)- 3.5 -Directed by Lucio Fulci, A deranged killer lives in the basement of an old mansion and pops out occasionally to commit grisly murders that include be-headings, ripped throats, and stabbings with a fireplace poker. The killer needs fresh body parts to rejuvenate his cells. He also has maggots for blood.

Nightmare City (1983)- 3.5 -Director: Umberto Lenzi, Airplane exposed to radiation crash lands. Out of the wreckage, blood drinking zombies emerge armed with knives, guns and teeth! They go on a rampage slicing, dicing, and biting thier way across the italian countryside.

Let the Sleeping Corpses Lie (1975)- 3.5 -Directed by Jorge Grau, A cop chases two young people visiting the English countryside, suspecting them of a local murder; unbeknownst to him, the real culprits are the living dead, brought to life with a thirst for human flesh by radiation being used by area farmers as a pesticide alternative. Is one of the best zombie shockers of the 1970s, this Spanish-Italian coproduction (also known as The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue and Don't Open the Window, among other titles) is a real international affair. Inspired by George Romero's genre-shattering American hit Night of the Living Dead, it was shot in England by a Spanish director with a largely British cast, and supplemented by Spanish zombies and American character actor Arthur Kennedy as a bitter Irish police detective (with only a hint of a brogue). He's investigating a sudden rash of violent murders (the work of Satanists, he's convinced) and closes in on a pair of newcomers to the sleepy Northern England town, longhaired antique dealer Ray Lovelock and his nervous traveling companion Christine Galb. Only they know the real culprits: newly deceased corpses, revived by agricultural experiments in ultrasonic radiation that are also turning newborns into vicious little monsters. Director Jorge Grau delivers all the stumbling zombies and gory flesh feasts you could hope for in a 1974 movie, but more importantly he creates the rare zombie thriller that manages to be both scary and smartly done. Some of the twists are a bit more far-fetched than others (why does dabbing blood on the eyes of long-dead cadavers magically bring them to life, and how would a zombie even know to try?), but it's a minor quibble in the face of the startling blood frenzy and Grau's satisfying dark dramatic twists. The DVD also features an introduction and a 20-minute interview with Grau (""I hope you will suffer profoundly,"" he jokes in the opening), as well as a gallery of posters and stills, TV ads, and radio spots. -Sean Axmaker

Dead Heat (1988)- 1 -Directed by Mark Goldblatt, Roger Mortis and Doug Bigelow are cops that are chasing crooks that are dead serious about crime. Or should I say they are chasing dead crooks perpetrating serious crimes? Seems some nutcase has learned how to bring back the dead and is sending them on crime sprees. Now these indestructable goons are in the way of officers Mortis and Bigelow. To even things up, when Mortis is killed (in the line of duty, of course) he gets a jump start from the Resurrection machine and takes the fight to the zombie bad guys.

Four (4) of the movies that I just named off for you and rated are 100% completely Uncut, Uncensored and Unrated in Remastered Anamorphic Widescreen (for the best picture quality) and they are HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD, City of the Living Dead, The House By The Cemetery, and Nightmare City.

These movies are a great collection to anyone's horror collection and to any fan of Euro-Horror movies. This is the best deal for all of these movies together in a walking dead bear case design, that also includes a walking strap for you can take your movies with you were ever you go. This one deal that you cannot pass up.",1158019200,6,5308,4.806133625410734
8074079,4,B000A3DGHQ,"You get 6 movies,Hell of the Living Dead,Dead Heat,Let Sleeping Corpses Lie, House by the Cemetary, City of the Living Dead and Nightmare city.

The reason I brought this set is because I didn't have ""Let Sleeping Corpses Lie"", plus I didn't have Dead Heat. I figured If i was to buy both on DVD it would be about the same price as the set so I did, I will just have to seel the doubles I have of  the rest no big deal.

Anyway I won't go into great detail about every movie but If you are to buy each one individually It will probably run you close $80 or so and for the price of this set its a must to get and I cant believe the price, they could have released ""Let Sleeping Corpses Lie"" for $20-$25 its self.

If anything just buy this set for City of the living dead, Let Sleeping Corpses Lie and Hell of the Living Dead ( which is good not great but a decent Zombie flick with a nice amount of gore). As for House by the cemetary is good as well,not great but an ok addition to this collection of discs, but I didn't like Dead Heat at all and I don't like Nightamre city, they both suck, IMO.

Let sleeping corpses lie its the best out of them all it drags and gets slow a bit but be patient the zombies are great and the gore is there and it actaully gives you a very creepy feeling and does bring a nice feel of horror, a well done flick. Get this box set its worth it as a die hard fan of Zombie Cinema and NYR Hockey : ), its worth having.",1127001600,17,1448,3.9283276450511946
