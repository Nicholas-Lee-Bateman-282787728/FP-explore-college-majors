2473059,4,B000CSTKFG,"All of these shorts are five minutes long. It became a challenge for each producer/director/writer team to try to create scares inside a five minute block of time. Many are not scary, although they are usually moody enough to keep you in that right frame of mind waiting for a good scare. Then there are the few very good ones that you wished would go further or at least get picked up, fleshed out and made into a 2 hour movie because the premise was so intriguing and had so much potential. This would be a great place to look for fresh, new ideas for upcoming Japanese horror films.
Overall I did enjoy it, maybe even because they were shorts. Those of us that have gotten hooked on Asian horror and their style of mood and story-telling over blood and gore will enjoy this because it's more of the same. There are some long haired female ghosts but most of the shorts dealt with nothing like that at all. I enjoyed the ones that dealt with folklore and urban legend and what I liked most was that I could watch a handful of them inside a half hour and then go do something else. I'd watch a few before bedtime just to give myself a chill. And it was easy to do because you didn't have to spend 90 minutes or more waiting for the build up. These shorts built the tension inside four minutes!
It was fun, some of it was scary and overall, it was enjoyable. If you like Asian horror, I think it's worth the price. As the previous reviewer wrote, the whole darn TV anthology is here for the same price as individual ones (4 for the price of 1) so why not get the whole thing? Then you can enjoy it over time. Also, the previous reviewer had problems with 2 of 4 discs playback but I can report I had no issues at all, so it isn't a transfer or region issue.",1206316800,3,1757,4.201183431952662
2473060,3,B000CSTKFG,"Tales of Terror from Tokyo is a horror anthology. These are made-for-TV shorts, based on supposedly ""true"" stories collected from all over Japan. I bought it mostly because I had seen a few of the pieces before and enjoyed them.  This boxset contains volume 1, volume 2, volume 3 part 1, and volume 3 part 2, which to my knowledge are all volumes available. So far as I can tell, there is no difference between the loose DVDs and this box set. Do note that this is the TV SERIES, and does not include the movie. I highly suggest that if you want any of the made-for-TV Tales of Terror, you go ahead and purchase the entire set rather than the loose DVDs- the box set is the same price as one volume here on Amazon, so it's like getting 4 for 1. That's a pretty good value, considering the true boast of over 60 short films.

The quality isn't bad. The case all four are in is one of those flimsy, thin cardboard ones, but that doesn't really matter. I do have some problems getting two separate DVD players to read the first disc. Eventually, though, they will read it. I have had no problems with any of the others. As for how they play, I don't know anything technical about picture quality, but to me, it looked really nice and clear.

As for content, honestly, it varies wildly from short to short. A lot of them are nothing special, perhaps not even entertaining. In order to enjoy this, you just have to enjoy and be familiar with Japanese horror. I do, so for me, this was a worthwhile purchase. Still, quite a few of these shorts are basically empty, and nearly all of them are open-ended. In my experience, you see that a lot in Japanese horror shorts, but it's still a little frustrating sometimes. Many of these feel like the beginning of a story and have no resolution. Sometimes that's a good effect, cutting off at just the right second and leaving you tense and anxious, but to watch it over and over again can get old. Many times you'll be left saying, ""What was that? What even happened? What?!"" If you understand some of the motifs you'll have less questions about certain things, but it's not much help. The tales are exactly the type of urban legend gossip Japan is inundated in, and honestly, they'd probably be better whispered in a low voice than as a film.

However, as mediocre as the majority happen to be, there are some definite gems in this collection. Like I said before, if you enjoy Japanese horror, I would encourage you to buy this, just for the few that are really good. You probably will not be scared, but some of them are genuinely creepy, and some are rather amusing. Of the amusing ones, some are trying to be funny; others are an attempt at seriousness that are giggle-worthy instead. Others, if not creepy, are just cool to look at. And most of them, despite their plotlessness, are filmed very well. There are occasionally some stupid effects that ruin an otherwise well-filmed piece, however. I tend to enjoy the ones with children the best. Also, some of them are longer or in two or three parts, and those tend to be better as well. I think if the five-minute pieces were given more time, they could be a lot better than they are.

I'll end with my favorite pieces from this set: The Visitor; Covering the 100 Tales; The Woman Next Door (which, mind you, falls into the trying-to-be-serious-but-is-funny category); Copy Machine, The Promise, Please Don't/No More, Please/Come If You Dare! (these three are a series); Let's Play; Don't Ever Open It; Getting Closer; The Men in Black (this one surprised me, as the MIB are more of a Western paranormal phenomena, and for me, a local one; it was also pretty funny, but I think intentionally); Tell Me; Another One; Overtime/Overtime 2 (series of 2)",1199577600,8,3741,4.52810650887574
2473061,5,B000CSTKFG,"I love this movie! If you love Japanese Horror, then you'll enjoy this DVD. Like the series, the Tales of Terror from Tokyo: the movie has some really good, creepy, and down right mindbending stories. You'll be happy that you added it to your creepy, crawly collection~",1186790400,7,269,4.74468085106383
8101915,5,B000CSTKFG,"These are my favorite short stories. It is actually hard to watch alone sometimes. The folk lore sometimes gets lost in translation, so if you think something was just silly or didn't make sense. It would be easy enough to google it, then you dan really grasp the weight of the short. Like the backwards suit, there is a darker meaning if you look deeper.",1458345600,,355,4.476923076923077

8101917,3,B000CSTKFG,It's worth watching.  Only for hardcore J-Horror fans only.  Other wise it has a low budget feel to it.  Stories range from bizarre to very crazy.  I recommend it for filmmakers trying to get ideas for short horror...this is not for everyone.,1422057600,2,242,4.690476190476191
8101918,3,B000CSTKFG,"In a collection full of seperate and unrelated horror tales, none of which (save a tiny handful of two-or-three parters) ever exceed 5 minute in length, it's almost impossible to build any kind of meaningful atmosphere or tension.  I spent most of my time with this set wondering if it was ever going to justify itself in any way beyond being mildly interesting.  The stories finish so quickly that the audience has no time to build any kind of connection to them.  The idea, I supppose, is similar to a series of ""campfire tales"". Several of these shorts, though, end so abruptly that they don't even satisfy on any level.

That said, the collection is pretty addictive, with that ""just one more"" quality that pushes you to continue, waiting for that great moment of horror you feel certain must be just around the corner. No doubt some viewers will be chilled by some of these bite-sized tales.  For myself, I had to wait until the very last story on the final disc (""The Music Box"") to finally feel that jolt of dread I'd been hoping for all along.  A good last impression, but a little too late.

Ultimately, this micro-budget collection of shorts will alternately entertain, bore or (if you're not not familiar with certain aspects of Japanese mythology) confuse, but very rarely does it chill.  2 1/2 stars, rounded up for Amazon's rating system.",1313452800,,1352,4.723404255319149
8101919,4,B000CSTKFG,"Like all compilations, this is uneven.  There are stories present which are too abrupt or jarring (two guilty parties here), too unthreatening, or are completely uneventful and uninteresting (""Gloves"" for instance).

That said there are gems here.  ""Night Watchman"" is a strange way to open a series purporting to be about terror ... it's more amusing than anything.  It is, however, quite entertaining, and you might get a chill or two along the way.  The real standout, in my eyes, is ""The Promise"", which is both eerie and strangely touching and might have made a good full length film to allow for expanded character motivations.  ""Line of Sight"", while perhaps too reminiscent of Ringu, also managed to give me a shiver or two.

In any case, this collection is worth checking out.  You'll probably have your own idea as to which are worthwhile and which are not, but if you enjoy japanese ghost stories, you'll certainly get something out of it.  If, however, you've never enjoyed films like Ringu and Ju-On, there's nothing here which will change your mind.",1308700800,4,1063,4.893854748603352
8101920,5,B000CSTKFG,"Tales of Terror From Tokyo and All Over Japan: The Movie is one of the best j-horror movies I have ever seen.  Every short has something scary to offer (some also extremely funny if you find this kind of things funny), and extremely entertaining.  I have watched and rewatched this thousands of times with my friends.  If you're new to J-Horror GET IT, if you love J-Horror and haven't seen it yet, GET IT as well.  Definitely a good movie to buy!",1282435200,5,447,4.414634146341464
8101921,5,B000CSTKFG,"Normally I would never buy a subtitled film.  I don't like reading subtitles and I always feel that there is something lost in the translation.  However, this one is different.

 This is not a set of feature movies. Tales Of Terror is an anthology of short horror films and vignettes, some as short as merely 5 or 6 minutes, some as long as 20 minutes. The location and language is Japanese, but there is very little need to read subtitles in this.  The eeriness of these short sagas is gripping and requires little dialog to relate.

The stories range from stark horror, to merely strange, and a few are even humorous. Most of these tales center around strange apparitions or hauntings, and many of them involve doors and what might be lurking on the other side.  The film director Takashi Shimizu ( director of hit movie The Grudge ) among several other directors make very effective use of hidden horror in these films. The buildup of tension as to what it is making that noise just on the other side of the door, rattling the door handle, rasping in a hoarse voice to be let in..., it does send shivers down your spine. These are not blood-soaked films, though there is plenty of implied violence occuring. Things happen, like elevator doors opening to reveal strange somber people asking a young girl if she's going down, but she's already on the lowest floor of the building. Or a child hearing a knock at the door that neither her mother or sister seems to hear, and a strange voice on the other side claiming to be a relative asking to be let in, but instinct tells the child this person at the door is not who she claims to be. Or a teenager goes for a job interview at a retail clothing store, only to discover that the place is empty of customers and staff, but there is an ominous ""dripping"" sound coming from somewhere, and small drops of blood seem to be falling from somehwere. I suppose these stories fall mostly into the category of ghost stories, or stories of demonic possession. Some of the short stories are better than others, but overall it's worth buying if you like horror movies and would like to see how they do horror in Japan.

8101922,5,B000CSTKFG,"I enjoyed this ""movie"" and the tales of terror that came before it, but someone not knowing what they are getting could easily be disappointed.  Imagine asking someone on the street to mention a scary story that happened to them.  Now imagine you took that story and put it to video, along with similar stories, without embellishing it to follow some standard of dramatic storytelling.  The endings can seem abrupt at times, and some jaded people may even say that the stories are not scary. If you were living the story, however, you would need a diaper and sprinter's shoes, much like if you decided to tag along with the Ghost Hunters and you heard or saw something unexplainable.  I enjoy this for its insight into the modern folklore of the Japanese, and for sheer entertainment.  If you want an actual dramatic horror film, look for Ringu or numerous other feature films.  I you want an anthology of tales that might be told around a Japanese campfire, this is a great choice.",1255046400,6,982,4.680232558139535
8101923,5,B000CSTKFG,"Is it possible to scare a person within five minutes? Well...is it? I say yes after viewing this dvd. This dvd is packed with 66 short stories, 33 on the first two discs and 33 on the last two discs. IMO the last disc which is the second half of vol. 3 is the best if I were to rank them I'd say...Vol 3.2(20 stories)>Vol. 1(15 Stories)>Vol3.1(13 Stories)>Vol. 2(18 Stories) I watched them in order but you don't have to of course.

Each story is a gives you a quick plot and a few jolts of scares but not every one of them actually pulls it off. Some stories just do not hold up BUT the ones that do are worth the price of admission(aka worth buying!) Which is currently $26.99(which is what I payed for it) Like I said yes there are a few stories that don't hold up well but all of them are worth the watch at least once, if you're a fan of asian horror films like Ju-On, Ringu, One Missed Call, etc. Then you will be entertained by a good chunk of the stories here.

Now on to my favorites on the dvds...

Vol. 1
The School Excursion
Kengo
The Visitor
Covering the 100 Tales

Vol. 2
Getting Closer
The Garden
Please Don't/No More Please/Come If You Dare(3 part story, I liked the first one the best of the 3 but you need to watch all 3 of course)
The Garden(worth it for the ending)

Vol. 3.1
The Breath of Mononoko
The Bride
The Men in Black(the ending will remind you of a famous older film)
Another One(kind of funny but I like it)

Vol. 3.2
Only Two of Us
A Woman Next Door
Three People Are Coming
Blue Trench Coat
Unbroadcast Footage
The Visitor
Sleepy Head
Greetings
Animal Odor
The Music Box(ends the set with a GREAT note)

Now just because these are my favorites doesn't mean you will like them but that's why you should give the entire collection a chance to see for yourself which ones you prefer.

The DVD themselves are barebones besides a few trailers but I honestly didn't care these shorts were enough to satisfy me. If you love asian horror, or just short horror stories in general then I suggest that you go out and buy this now! Stop reading my review and get these dvds!!!",1255046400,5,2095,4.2462311557788945
