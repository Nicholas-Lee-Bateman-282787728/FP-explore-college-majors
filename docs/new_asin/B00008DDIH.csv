1835207,5,B00008DDIH,"Blue Sunshine (Jeff Lieberman, 1976)...Originally released in 1976, Blue Sunshine was directed by Jeff Lieberman. In the same year, Lieberman also made the creepy `killer worm' movie Squirm, and in the 1980s he was responsible for the killer-in-the-woods flick Just Before Dawn (1981) and the science-fiction comedy Remote Control (1987). His last input into a movie released to theatres was as the screenwriter for The Neverending Story III (Peter MacDonald, 1994).Lieberman's second film, Blue Sunshine is a patchwork quilt of elements borrowed from horror, satire, science-fiction, Sixties drug movies, counterculture myths, urban legend and conspiracy theories. Like Wes Craven's The Last House on the Left (1973), Don Siegel's Dirty Harry (1971) and Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs (1972) and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973), Blue Sunshine is a reaction against the counterculture of the 1960s, detailing the decline of the youthful idealism associated with the late 60s as it exploded into the raw reality of the 1970s: the cumulative effect of the disastrous Stones concert at Altamont Speedway, the failure of American forces in Vietnam, the shootings at Kent State University and finally Watergate was to add to an increased sense of alienation and despair within American society. This despair suggested that the counterculture `project' had failed: love, peace and happiness had no place in the society of the early 1970s. The most memorable films made during this period are characterized by a sense of lethargy, an `energylessness' that tapped into the zeitgeist within American society. Blue Sunshine is no exception, and for Nathanael Thompson (2003) the film `now feels prophetic in its depiction of a post-1960s culture ripping apart at the seams as it tries to dissolve back into normal, capitalist society': like many genre/exploitation films, Blue Sunshine appears to be a way of `working through' and coming to terms with the problems faced by the society in which it was produced. In a nod to one of Hitchcock's favourite plot devices, Blue Sunshine stars Zalman King as a man wrongly accused of murder. In the 1980s, King developed a reputation as a maker of erotic dramas: he was responsible for Two Moon Junction (1988), Nine and a Half Weeks (1986), Lake Consequence (1993) and the HBO television series Red Shoe Diaries (1992-2001). Here, he certainly does not prove his skills as an actor, but he gives a suitably hysterical, paranoid performance as a man embroiled in a mystery: a group of apparently respectable, upstanding Stanford graduates are losing their hair and turning into psychotic killers. The source of their psychosis appears to be a form of Lysergic Acid called `Blue Sunshine' that they took ten years earlier, and which releases a `chomosomal aberration' in their biological makeup. Around the basic premise, Lieberman constructs an increasingly paranoid, edgy satire, the targets of which are the idealistic baby-boomer hippies who `sold out' and became the money-driven yuppies who allowed the New Right to seize power in the late 1970s. This narrative forms the basis for an extremely paranoid film that transgresses taboos as easily as it crosses traditional genre distinctions: for example, in one of the most memorable setpieces, a babysitter attacks her charges with a knife, and in the combative opening sequence a clown (Richard Crystal, Billy Crystal's brother) murders guests at a party by forcing them into an open fireplace. Within this apparently exploitative narrative, Lieberman includes some bizarre twists to rival those found in Larry Cohen's similarly perverse horror/SF thriller God Told Me To (also known as Demon, and released the same year as Blue Sunshine). Lieberman also executes some satirical setpieces: for example, a massacre in a discotheque and a sequence in which one of the `infected' stalks a shopping mall (two years before Romero's consumerist satire Dawn of the Dead). Blue Sunshine had a strong impact on many of the young people who became involved in the Punk scene of the late 1970s and early 1980s: it spoke to their nihilistic instinct, hatred of hippies, and in its exploration of the boundaries of taste it shared its ironic stance with the early Punks. Consequently, in the late 1970s and early 1980s the film developed a strong cult following among young people, and in 1983, working with Steve Severin (Siouxsie and the Banshees) The Cure's Robert Smith produced an album named after the film. Often described as `Cronenberg-esque', Blue Sunshine was released before the films that went on to define the style of David Cronenberg (The Brood, 1978; Scanners, 1981; Videodrome, 1982), and consequently pre-dates Cronenberg's preoccupation with viruses that affect both human biology and psychology. Thompson claims that, like Cronenberg's movies, in Blue sunshine `there isn't much aggressive shock material on display; the unease of [the film] lies instead in its queasy sense of the mind and body breaking down without any control' (op cit). The lack of `shock material may deter some viewers, and in his otherwise enthusiastic review Thompson admits that `[f]or horror fans raised during the slasher glut of the '80s and afterwards, adapting to the socially twisted terrors of the 1970s can be an uphill battle' (op cit). However, like most Seventies horror movies (Saul Bass' Phase IV, 1974; Jerrold Freedman's made-for-television The Chill Factor/A Cold Night's Death, 1973), Blue Sunshine rewards patient viewers with a glimpse into a society (and a physiology) on the brink of collapse...",1055462400,7,5589,5.295045045045045
1835258,4,B00008DDIH,"After being falsely accused of murder, Jerry begins investigating the cause of his friend's violent attacks, which he links to an experimental psychedelic drug that was taken by a group of college students a decade earlier. Like in the Roger Corman classic THE TRIP, BLUE SUNSHINE explores the darker side of recreational drug use through the guise of a Horror film. While director Jeff Lieberman does not attempt to show the psychedelic effects of the drug from the user's perspective (as we have seen in EASY RIDER and others), he does paint a terrifying image of the drug-addled mind from a exterior vantage. The tension mounts as we begin to see signs of the characters slipping away into delusion, never knowing quite when they will strike. Zalman King competently plays the inquisitive Jerry Zipkin as he presses people for answers in an attempt to clear his name, and Mark Goddard is great as the crooked politician, Edward Flemming. Save for a few gaping plot holes and sluggish moments in the script, BLUE SUNSHINE is a strangely entertaining and frightful thriller that speaks strongly to the anti-drug hysteria of the time.

1835261,4,B00008DDIH,"In the late 60s, a bunch of students at Stanford University dropped a powerful dose of LSD known as ""Blue Sunshine.""  Now, ten years later, these students are having the world's worst acid flashback.  They're losing their hair, they can't stand loud noises, and they're all turning into homicidal maniacs.  After his best friend goes crazy and murders an innocent women, Jerry Zipkin (Zalman King) launches his own investigation into both Blue Sunshine and into the people who are now literally time bombs waiting to explode.  His investigation eventually leads him to a murderous babysitter, a crazed former football star, a man who is on the verge of being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, and a violent rampage that, not surprisingly considering this film is from the 70s, ends in a discotheque.

B-movie director Jeff Lieberman made some of the most underappreciated films of the 70s and Blue Sunshine is one of his best.  While the film contains plenty of action, Lieberman emphasizes character and plot over mindless mayhem and the end result is an unusually intelligent and nuanced exploitation film.  Lieberman's direction is at its best in the creepy scene where Zalman King investigates a fresh crime scene and finds himself visualizing what must have happened.  King will never be mistaken for a great actor but he's well-cast here and he makes Jerry Zipkin into one of the more interesting heroes of 70s cinema.  While it's obvious that most of the film's ""monsters"" are simply wearing rubber bald caps, they're still undeniably creepy and Lieberman creates a sense of genuine unease and paranoia as King is forced to question the motives of every bald person he sees.  Are they about to attack him or are they just bald?

1835262,4,B00008DDIH,"<strong>Blue Sunshine</strong> (Jeff Lieberman, 1976)

Jeff Lieberman, it turns out, was quite the busy little beaver during 1976. First off, he released <em>Squirm</em>, a fun, intelligent ecohorror/monster movie in the vein of <em>Frogs</em> or <em>It Happened at Lakewood Manor</em>, but that doesn't play it anywhere near that straight. It was featured on the final season of <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em>, and has been unjustly maligned ever since; it's actually a pretty good little flick. And then he turned around and finished <em>Blue Sunshine</em>, a movie that plays it a lot straighter than <em>Squirm</em>. It faded into obscurity almost immediately in America, then went overseas in '78, playing in a handful of European and South American countries before once again disappearing beneath the waves.

Thank god for the Catalans.

<em>Blue Sunshine</em> was rediscovered early this century and screened--for what may have been the first time in a quarter-century--at the Sitges Film Festival in Catalonia, Spain, in 2003. It was a smash with the festivalgoers, and the Sitges screening led to the movie getting a proper DVD release for the first time ever. It's not terribly surprising that someone noticed, given that a number of folks in the cast have since gone on to bigger and better things.

Plot: Jerry (Zalman King, the guy behind <em>The Red Shoe Diaries</em> in one of his final appearances in front of the camera) is at a party with his kinda-new girlfriend, Alicia (<em>Tarantulas: The Deadly Cargo</em>'s Deborah Winters) and some old friends. One of those friends, in the middle of a song-and-dance routine, suddenly goes nuts and runs out the door. Jerry goes after him, but while Jerry and Alicia are out driving around, the friend backtracks to the house and kills the three women who remained behind. He also attacks Jerry, which leads to a foot chase back to the highway, where Jerry throws him in front of a truck. Needless to say, he's accused of murder and goes on the run. While hiding out, he sees a newspaper article about a Navy man who suddenly went crazy and started killing people. The two had one thing in common: they suddenly started losing their hair, and right before they went homicidal, they went almost totally bald in one fell swoop. Jerry and Alicia start digging around, with the help of David Blume (<em>All the President's Men</em>'s Robert Walden), a half-burnt-out doctor and one of Jerry's oldest friends... who happens to be losing his hair.

Trust me, I'm only scratching the surface of the awesome cast here. Mark Goddard (<em>Lost in Space</em>) and Ann Cooper (<em>Seems Like Old Times</em>) play a husband-and-wife team. Ray Young (<em>Bagdad Cafe</em>) is a bodyguard. The late, great Brion James (<em>Bladerunner</em>) turns up in a minor role. Bill Adler. Barbara Quinn. Stefan Gierasch. Alice Ghostley! And it's in no small part because of the stellar cast that the mystery plays here, even when you already know what's causing these people to go nuts (and if you've even heard of this movie, you probably know what it is).

Jeff Lieberman, to date, has directed just five big-screen features. Of them, I have now seen four (the 1981 thriller <em>Just Before Dawn</em> is waiting for me at home), and I've found all four quite enjoyable. This is not deathless cinema by any means, but Lieberman is a whole lot better than he's given credit for. This one gets a solid recommend. *** ",1307664000,,3458,5.056140350877193
1835263,3,B00008DDIH,"When dealing in underground/indie classics, there are some movies you need to have patience with and clemency for. They require a sense of humor, an understanding of context and a willingness to forgive a film's many transgressions against logic and the senses because of its place in history. In spite of my willingness and eagerness to do these things, I was not exactly bowled over by Blue Sunshine. The pacing was awkward, the characters confusing and I felt it could have been more psychedelic and weird. If you're looking for something really psychedelic and strange, this might not be the right movie for you. Still, this film, reminiscent of and contemporary to early Cronenberg has a lot of similar elements and combines science fiction, biopunk and thriller elements in a way few films do. And for some, the tragedy of hippie becoming yuppie and rock giving way to disco will be something you feel keenly, and your heart will go out to members of an idealistic and imaginative generation turning into zombies. If this were better, I could call it a cross between Taxi Driver and I Drink Your Blood. But it's not quite that good, which is a shame, because if Blue Sunshine were the movie it could have been, it would have been a trippy, fantastic film deserving of its iconic status. But it wasn't.

1835265,3,B00008DDIH,"The second of director Jeff Lieberman's trilogy of perfect B thrillers, the others being Squirm (1976) and Just Before Dawn (1981), is a clever shocker given some interesting spins.

A young man stands accused of murder when one of his friends goes crazy during a party. He flees the police, discovers that other similar killings have taken place and that a brand of LSD is behind it. But what can he do to stop the power of 'Blue Sunshine'?

Highly stylish, off-beat psychological thriller may just be the best testament to Lieberman's film making talents. Lieberman gives this film a haunting atmosphere, moments pure strangeness, and startling violence. Lieberman's story is a weird tale, tense with mystery and powered by an original concept. Charles Gross provides a beautiful and truly odd musical score that complements the mood of the film perfectly.

The cast is quite good as well. Zalman King is the best as the film's rather unlikely hero.

1835267,4,B00008DDIH,"Jeff Liberman, directing his second film, seems to resemble a David Cronenberg, in delivering his material with a dead-on seriousness interlaced with a sense of humor at times. A case-in-point is the opening party sequence where a partygoer imitating Sinatra goes beserk--a preview of things to come.

The premise of this film traces a form of LSD that leaves those who took it with a delayed chromosonal imbalance triggered by sudden hair loss and then psychosis marked by violent, homicidal impulses.

With the bad LSD linked to a Stanford ex-professor to local campaigning politician, unlikely hero Zalman King must find the answers to the mystery behind a rash of murders amidst the normalcy of respectable suburban types of middle America.

Shocking as it was on its original release, this once hard-to-find film in this DVD set offers an exemplary transfer from the original print, a full-length commentary by the director, trailers, and some of Liberman's earlier satirical film shorts.

1835279,3,B00008DDIH,"Although I'm far too young to have experienced the heady joys of the Woodstock Generation (I was born in 1970, just in time to enjoy the wonderful fashions of the Nixon/Ford/Carter decade), I've eagerly watched the selfish, egotistical cads otherwise known as the Baby Boomers make total fools of themselves. Think I'm being a bit harsh? Go watch the movie ""Woodstock"" for proof of this assertion. Come on, could we expect anything other than total idiocy from a bunch of people who thought getting hopped up on brown blotter and rolling around in the mud was the end all be all of human existence? It'll be worth kicking an extra ten percent of the paycheck into Social Security for a few years if it means we won't have to listen to these dolts any longer. Prepare to meet your maker, Baby Boomers, and don't let the door hit you in the you know what on the way out! Of course, we all could have been spared the nightmare that is the Baby Boomers had Jeff Lieberman's nightmarish vision encapsulated in ""Blue Sunshine"" become reality. He thought of an excellent way to rid the world of these buffoons. Too bad it's only a movie--OR IS IT?!?!

The opening sequences of ""Blue Sunshine"" tell us rather quickly that something is amiss. We see a cop, a babysitter, and a couple of other members of the Boomer generation going about their business. Oddly, they all seem to suffer from extreme headaches and, even more disturbing, hair loss. Maybe it's the full moon that keeps popping up in these scenes that's causing these problems? They wish. No, it's something far more sinister and personal than that. We first learn exactly what's going on when we see Jerry Zipkin (Zalman King) and his girlfriend Alicia Sweeny (Deborah Winters) laughing it up with their friends at a party. They're just sitting back to enjoy the antics of his bestest pal Frannie (Richard Crystal), who is preparing to sing a song for the crowd, when a shocking revelation rears its ugly head (pun intended). Someone bumps Frannie the wrong way, revealing the fact that he wears a wig over his nearly bald pate. Funny thing is, no one can remember male pattern baldness in Frannie's family. Not that they have the time to ask, unfortunately, as our hairless friend suddenly flips out and starts killing people. Jerry tries to stop him, leading to a confrontation outside that results in a vehicle crushing the nearly rabid Frannie. Now Jerry's on the run, hunted by the cops and haunted by the vision of his pal going nutso.

What's going on? Good question, and one that Zipkin plans on getting to the bottom of as soon as possible. He quickly enlists the assistance of a doctor friend, David Blume (Robert Waldron), to help put the pieces together. It turns out that a guy named Edward Flemming (Mark Goddard), now attempting to run for a seat in Congress, sold some bad blotter called Blue Sunshine ten years ago in college. Frannie bought some, and so did the people we saw in the opening sequences of the film. Yep, that's right. We're talking about the ultimate flashback, one that turns the people who dropped the tabs into bald, raving psychotics. While Jerry goes about his mission to expose the madness, the movie cuts away from time to time so we can see these nuts killing their families, strangers, and generally anyone who gets in the way. It's not pretty, not in the least. Zipkin's going to have a tough time proving his theory, however, especially since Flemming isn't about to admit publicly that he once sold drugs. Fortunately, Flemming's beefy henchman Wayne Mulligan (Ray Young) goes of his rocker in a very public way. The message of the film? Nancy Reagan was right--JUST SAY NO!

I wasn't sure what Lieberman tried to accomplish with ""Blue Sunshine."" Is it a comedy or a serious message film about the dangers of drug use? As many times as I busted a gut over the ridiculous shenanigans unfolding every couple of minutes, I'm strongly thinking it's the former. How can we take bald psychos on a rampage seriously? How about the scene where Wayne rampages through a disco? Should I take that seriously as well? Heck, the fact that Jerry Zipkin uses a pellet pistol to bring down a Blue Sunshine nut is enough to elicit guffaws for a week and a half! Throw in some seriously over the top acting, television movie of the week production values, and a score that sounds like Edvard Munch's ""The Scream"" set to music and you've all the trimmings for a laughfest of epic proportions. Every time I saw Jerry Zipkin I had to roar. He sweats, twitches incessantly, and looks like he slept in his clothes for a year. This guy looks worse than Kate Moss on a two-week nose candy binge. I guess I shouldn't be too hard on the movie--I thought the opening sequences were incredibly well done, and the idea behind the madness is a bit intriguing. The execution is a laugh riot, though.

The DVD contains a boatload of extras. We get a Lieberman short film called ""The Ringer"" that's nearly more enjoyable than ""Blue Sunshine,"" a lengthy interview with the man himself, a trailer, a still gallery, a commentary track, and a restoration comparison that shows us just how bad of shape the film was in (and how good the transfer looks). I'm not the biggest Jeff Lieberman fan out there--I witnessed first hand the horror that is ""Squirm""--so I can't say I would watch ""Blue Sunshine"" again. I do recommend watching it once, though, if for no other reason than to marvel at its abject weirdness. Good luck!",1129680000,,5482,4.671842650103519

1835281,3,B00008DDIH,"During the peak of the popularity of psychedelics (i.e., hallucinogens) in the 1960s and 1970s, there circulated various urban legends about the frightening, wildly unpredictable, and sometimes fatal side effects of sub-standard LSD that was purportedly cooked up by amateur chemists in makeshift underground labs.  In his 1978 opus BLUE SUNSHINE, low-budget auteur Jeff Lieberman exploits these legends to create a far-out and funky counter-culture thriller.

The story revolves around a loose-knit group of young professionals who have all outgrown the rebellious and reckless atmosphere of the 1960s and are now trying to establish careers and families.  When several among them start to inexplicably lose their hair, foam at the mouth, and go on murderous rampages, one man wastes no time in seeking to uncover the reason behind his friends' bizarre behavior and physical transformation.  He soon discovers that the only element common to all those who have flipped out is their experimentation ten years earlier with a form of LSD known on the street as Blue Sunshine.  But when he tries to go public with this information, he finds himself in the middle of a dangerous political cover-up.

(SF fans will recognize actor Mark Goddard from his role as Major Don West on TV's original LOST IN SPACE.  Here he plays the slimy, smarmy up-and-coming politician with something to hide.)

BLUE SUNSHINE is to LSD what 1938's REEFER MADNESS (a.k.a. TELL YOUR CHILDREN) is to marijuana, the one difference being that BLUE SUNSHINE is intentionally ludicrous.  So BLUE SUNSHINE is actually a horror comedy.  Unfortunately, many critics of the era interpreted the film as a modern cautionary tale meant to warn ladder-climbing yuppies--many of whom were formerly drug-taking hippies--that their past and present actions may have long-term consequences.  But it's hard to imagine that any moviegoer would view the outrageous plot, the histrionic acting, and the ultra-cheap FX as anything other than the elements of a tongue-in-cheek spoof, especially considering the times in which it was made.  Indeed, in the film's credits, Jeff Lieberman and crew even offer a clue to their true intentions--they drolly thank Dr. Timothy Leary for popularizing LSD thereby making BLUE SUNSHINE possible!

It requires a certain kind of cinematic taste to understand and enjoy BLUE SUNSHINE, and those who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s are likely to appreciate it most, as a certain level of familiarity with the counter-culture of the era is required to get all of the ""jokes.""  Of course, aficionados of trash pics and cult flicks will probably want to take a gander, too.  As for everybody else, it's sort of a toss-up.

The limited-edition DVD from Synapse offers the flick in its original 1.78:1 aspect ratio and provides the option for sound in either a new Dolby Digital 5.1 Remix or the original mono.  There are a few bonus features on the DVD itself, and the package also includes a CD featuring the film's original musical soundtrack.  Well worth the price of admission, at least for those who enjoy basking in BLUE SUNSHINE.",1107820800,,3116,5.136633663366337
1835282,5,B00008DDIH,"Most of the film reviews I've read of ""Blue Sunshine"" knock it to no end, citing ""bad acting"", an ""absurd plot"", et al.  That's bull.  This movie has the angsty flavor of a Hitchcock film with some time period-commentary thrown in.  The mood of surreality and displacement is astounding.

Admittedly, not all of it makes sense, but I hardly think that's a viable complaint considering the way mainstream movies usually deal with plot.  The film starts out innocently enough, with a group of (old college buddies) having a party.  When a particularly goofy, Frank Sinatra looking character bends over to kiss someone else's girlfriend, he is accosted and his hair is pulled off.  We see that he is completely bald, and his eyes bug out of their sockets.  This a really chilling scene.  He then proceeds to go completely bonzo and massacre his friends, looking like a character from Planet 9 From Outer Space on acid (no pun intended).  The hero of the film chases him and he is run over by a truck.  From here, things start to get really, really trippy.

Perhaps the most truly scary scene is when our hero is trying to get to the bottom of the ""Blue Sunshine"" phenomenon, speaking to a pill popping housewife who he believes was given the LSD by her former husband who is now a politican.  After she throws him it out, believing his motives to be other than they are, her children start screaming for ice cream.  It is difficult to forget this scene: her eyes get wide, she removes her hair, and comes close to butchering them with a knife.  Again, this poor bastard saves the kids, and ends up looking like the villain.

The last few scenes are unforgettable, with some 70's humor thrown in.  For all the occasionally bad dialogue and plot holes, I would not at all call this a ""B"" grade movie.  It creates an undeniable atmosphere of dread and paranoia.  ""The Ringer"", a short film dealing with the illusions of pop culture and marketing, is almost better than the movie itself.

Blue Sunshine (1976) tells a story that involves the physical and psychological effect of a particular kind of drug many years after its' initial use.  The film starts out at a party, a real groovy happening, that soon evolves into a massacre as a guy, who looks a lot like actor John Cryer but isn't, becomes unglued and goes on a psychotic killing spree.  Jerry Zipkin, played by Zalman King, who was at the party, soon finds himself in the position of being falsely accused of the crimes and on the run from the police.
Jerry, unable to fathom why his friend went completely bonkers and killed those people and then attacked him, is searching for answers in a desperate attempt to not only clear his name, but also learn exactly what happened.  As Jerry delves deeper and deeper into the mystery, more unusual killings occur.  The nature of the attackers is similar, right down to certain physical characteristics, alopecia (a loss of hair), glassy-eyed stare, super human strength, and homicidal tendencies.  It's soon found that all the people who went schizoid have a common denominator in that they all attended the same university at the same time and all have a link to a politician currently running for congress.  Will Jerry learn the meaning of Blue Sunshine before any more killings take place, and before the police capture him?
Blue Sunshine, written and directed by Jeff Lieberman, does have Hitchcockian elements with the whole `falsely accused man trying to clear his name' theme, but also adds horror elements, giving the film a nice slant and a sense of originality.  Lieberman also wrote and directed the creepy crawler Squirm (1976), a horror pic about flesh-eating earthworms.  Blue Sunshine also stars Deborah Winters as Jerry's girlfriend Alicia Sweeney, Mark Goddard, who many, including myself, remember as Major Don West in the 60's television sci-fi show Lost in Space, as politician Edward Flemming, and character actor Charles Siebert as Detective Clay.  Siebert's name may not ring any bells, but if you've watched television in the 70's, you will most likely recognize his face as he appeared on show like All in the Family, The Rockford Files, Police Woman, Barnaby Jones, Good Times, and a slew of others.
While the film does contain some plot holes, they are easy to overlook, especially as the story tends to move pretty quickly, and the instances where the psychosis sets in, causing various individuals to lose it and go on a murderous rampage are exceptionally creepy.  This is especially true of the scene with the woman babysitting the two, highly annoying children and her chasing them around with a large knife.  Surprisingly, there is very little gore involved, much less than I had expected.  Zalman King's performance is fairly odd and discordant, along with the delivery of a lot of his dialogue.  It's hard to describe, but I had the feeling he seemed always just of out sync with the film, creating a bizarre element that would normally work against a picture, but here, it seemed to complement the plot as it unraveled.  The film did seem to end rather abruptly, hinting at the chilling notion that the instances of violence may only be the tip of the iceberg, so to speak.
The film, which has been out of circulation on home video for about a decade, looks really clean and clear in this anamorphic wide screen (1:78:1) release.  Some very minor speckling and damaged to the print is evident, but one of the special features shows a comparison to the original print and this cleaned up print, exhibiting the amazing restorative work done, supervised by the director himself, on the film for this release, which entailed about 17 hours of intensive labor.  Other special features include a new Dolby Digital created especially for home video environments, the original mono soundtrack, a full commentary by director Jeff Lieberman, an original short film directed by Lieberman, a still gallery, the original theatrical trailer for the film, comprehensive liner notes, and a 30 minute video interview with the director.  This is a two disc set, with the film and special features on the first disc, the second disc being a never before released original sound track CD.  All in all, an excellent release of a creepy, rarely seen film that looks at the possible residual effects of the free love generation.

1835284,5,B00008DDIH,"Jeff Lieberman's BLUE SUNSHINE is the ultimate anti-drug message and a fine horror movie. It's all about an LSD-type drug made in 1967 made in Stanford University that causes the user to spontaneously go berserk (and bald) ten years later to the date of its ingestion. Now a friend (RED SHOE DIARIES Zalman King) of one of the users must get to the bottom of this tangled web. The best thing about BLUE SUNSHINE is that Lieberman evokes Alfred Hitchcock almost without trying; one of his inspirations was Brian DePalma (who made CARRIE the same year this was made) and Lieberman lays on the style much like DePalma did. BLUE SUNSHINE is also a brilliant commentary on the transition of the social climate from the 1960's to the 1970's and the consequences of the '60s movements, mainly drug-related, and it's just as relevant today (especially after 28 DAYS LATER) as it was in 1976! The music is also creepy and creates the perfect atmosphere of tension and paranoia necessary for the subject matter at hand (the soundtrack is included in this fine DVD limited edition). BLUE SUNSHINE is a movie that is definetly worth discovery, especially with remakes of '70s gems THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and DAWN OF THE DEAD! Definetly check this one out; your life may depend on it!",1081036800,3,1276,4.778280542986425
1835285,3,B00008DDIH,"Fun, if you don't take productions values, etc too seriously.  Anyone saying that the movie stinks because of ""bungled direction"", etc, either wasn't old enough in the 60's and 70's to appreciate what this movie is, which is pure, unvarnished B grade fodder.  I admit I'm biased, I love this kind of schlock.
However, the premise is an interesting one, and Jeff did a halfway credible job (In B horror flicks this is high praise)directing it.  What amazes me is seeing it again after all these years and realizing that the cast is chock full of yet_to_be's and used_to_be's...something I wouldn't have realized while watching it for the first time in a German Student Art-Film House.  Speaking of which, I first saw Assault on Precinct 13 there, another nifty lil low budge worth checking out.",1071792000,2,793,4.851851851851852
1835286,2,B00008DDIH,"I bought this movie sight unseen based soley on its concept and reputation. My bad.
This movie takes an interesting concept and sinks it with pedestrian direction and a reluctance to see its story through. It is a shame because they could have made a truly interesting film without maxing out the budget.
The director, Lieberman, seems reluctant and unwilling to truly deal with the dark/silly idea at the core of his story. 60's college radicals drop some acid called Blue Sunshine. Ten years later it catches up with them-their hair falls out and they become kill crazy lunatics. This is a great jumping off point for either incisive social satire and/or over the top horror thrills. This film provides neither. It is much too timid to deliver on the horror(the kids survive the attack by their babysitter?!) and it does not follow through on the satire either(so yesterday's drug dealers can become tomorrow's politician...And?...). Oh, and its true, Zalman King is godawful in the lead.
Somewhere on the disk they make mention of the fact that a network TV station wanted to buy this film and air it as a TV movie of the week. It makes sense. In fact, if it were a TV movie of the week I would have been more impressed. But no, this is supposed to be a lost gem of an exploitation film and let me tell you it is not. It takes a great concept and renders it impotent by running it through the hack-Hitchcock treadmill. Boring.
Worth a rental maybe but do not buy it unless you are a Fan.",1063843200,5,1490,4.5427509293680295
1835287,1,B00008DDIH,"This film deserves at least one star for one reason and one reason only:  the cameraman did manage to keep it in focus.  I don't believe I've ever seen a concept with such strong potential so completely bungled.  Ex-hippies turned yuppies turned crazed baldheaded killing machines who don't like disco?  Who wouldn't want to see this story told?  It's no mystery why Zalman King gave up his acting career to become a softcore director.  What is a mystery is how Robert Walden managed to be in this atrocity and ""All the President's Men"" in the same year!",1058227200,4,554,4.65979381443299

7981643,4,B00008DDIH,"A group of people who used Acid (Blue Sunshine) in previous years all of a sudden loose hair and go psycho. There is a loose plot line about a  local government cover up and a bad politician but that can be ignored and just focus on the few great freak out moments of victims being tossed off balconies and thrown in fireplaces. Blue Sunshine, at times, is more like a mild trip but definitely worth checking out if you are a 70's horror aficionado. Zalman King overacts as protagonist and arms himself with a tranquilizer gun to hunt down the murderous acid heads. Look out for the legendary disco scene where an Acid Head loses his mind at a disco and covers his ears to block the music and destroys the studio, apparently the Ramones used to play that footage over them at CBGB's in protest to the popular dance fad. More weird than horror, but a good break from the regular rotation of 70's thrillers.",1399593600,,905,4.451807228915663

7981645,3,B00008DDIH,"""Uh, it's some kind of disease, it's kind of hard to explain"" - how about the victims of home invasions/concentration camps were gaslit successfully as the perpetrators always intended (but FAILED).  To explain away murders committed at home, the blame was placed on the patriarch.  To explain the shaved heads on the corpses in the camps of extermination by labor, they must have been drug addict prisoners whose self-poisoning finally came home to roost.

What a wild theory!  But those shaved heads and wigs on Jewish women and the bad name given to bald people ... what else could it be about other than Drugs are Bad, Mmkay?

This movie is incredibly creepy and sinister in feel.  The Seventies which seems to be based on Bavarian style with its dark woods (murders in tudor homes), macrame and general gracelessness are already creepy in its own right.  I find Seventies movies just visually frightening and disturbing.  The only product that made the Seventies bearable that I can remember is Charlie's Angels.
