I bought the item ""used"" to save money and the movie was brand new, still in the shrink wrap as promised by the seller!  I received the movie within 3 days and was very happy with my purchase!!",1313280000,2,317,4.096774193548387
2196148,5,B0006U5V9E,"Well, I've been on a documentary binge lately. Broadcast TV has littler value than ever. I grew up in the 1950's and there was a girl on my block who suffered from Polio, so that's why I had interest in watching this. Wow, because I was so young then, I never realized the story of the mystery and fear surrounding this disease. I remember standing in a long line for vaccinations, and as a child I did not realize what a miracle it was that this came along just in time for my generation. Let's hope the anti-vaccination crowd doesn't help this disease creep back in.",1463529600,,568,4.367924528301887

2196150,5,B0006U5V9E,"A great informative documentary.  My mother had polio as a child, and it left her disabled later in life.  I remember the vaccine and going to the doctor to take it, not a shot, it was orally.",1461024000,,192,4.162162162162162
2196151,4,B0006U5V9E,"Having grown up in the fifties, I remember seeing children in their braces and that my parents were afraid we might get polio. There was so much relief when the vaccine came out. I didn't know that the first vaccine had caused polio and even death of some children. This is timely in that there is so much controversy over the safety of today's vaccines.",1461024000,,354,4.461538461538462

2196168,5,B0006U5V9E,"A fantastic exploration of this horrible time in history. Seeing survivors of the ordeal talk about the fear, dread and horrors polio did, is truly an eye opening experience. This is one of those films that should be used in history classes, medical teaching. It gives a personal side to a medical horror. So many people read or learn about viruses and diseases and go through it, like it's just another part to learn, without ever stepping into, or realizing that real people where stricken with this problem, and went through many horrors and situations that we can only have nightmares about, but these persons in this video showcases the pain, fear, dread and suffering they went through. This is a remarkable program that I highly Recommend. Truly educational and emotional.",1454976000,,779,4.9541984732824424

2196173,5,B0006U5V9E,"A timely reminder about a truly terrible disease.  Quite interesting too, that its victims and its cure was totally financed by ordinary Americans through the March of Dimes, and not the federal government.  Intense fear certainly made this possible -",1449619200,,251,5.25
2196174,5,B0006U5V9E,I was a child when this occurred and remember lining up in school to receive the oral version. This film traced the history and the nations response to it. I thought it did a very thorough and informative job of the history of polio. It contained a lot of information that I was unaware of including FDR and Warm Springs. I would recommend this.,1449014400,,345,4.40625
2196175,5,B0006U5V9E,"I am a ""polio"" (infected February 1952, Alice, TX), and I learned a lot by watching this documentary. I did not realize Roosevelt indirectly was responsible for the initial research done for a vaccine. Fascinating!

2196179,5,B0006U5V9E,"Great movie.  I showed it to my sophomore health class during our disease unit.  It opened up a lot of discussion about infectious diseases,  vaccines,  and the fear and panic that people faced that my students have never experienced.",1445644800,,234,4.923076923076923
2196180,5,B0006U5V9E,"Well presented program that displays how lucky we are to be living in a post inoculation time. Frightening disease that I only heard about as a child, but now understand the fear that my parents must have held during those epidemic summers.

2196181,5,B0006U5V9E,"Being 71 I remember the horrible  summers and the polio ""epidemics"".  No idea what caused it or how it was transmitted. My cousin got it after I had spent 2 weeks with him on a farm. 1-2 weeks after he came down with it I developed the same symptoms. I actually had strep throat  but I remember seeing him in an iron long on his 10th birthday and he almost died 3 times. I was signed up to be a ""polio pioneer"" to be in the test group but I got strep again and not able to do it. It was a frightening time. I thought the movie really brought out how horrible it was and how it effected everyone's life,not just those who got the disease. Very good film.",1444867200,3,653,4.007692307692308

2196187,4,B0006U5V9E,"A mind altering expose. If you think you have troubles, this film will put them in perspective. I remember standing in line at school for a polio vaccination in the 1950""s, and now realize how close this disease was to our lives then. But for a few good men we would still be battling polio and it's devastating effects. Brave young children star in this film, which tells the story of a crippling disease during an age when we all believed it was the best of times. If you're in your sixties, this film will make you feel lucky not to have contacted polio in your youth, and to appreciate the medical advances made in our lifetime.",1443139200,,632,4.410256410256411

2196190,5,B0006U5V9E,"I am a polio 'cripple.' The word is painful, but it has described me for 64 of my 66 years. When the virus struck my 18 month old body, I was placed in the first iron lung available in Utah, the state I lived in at the time. The iron lung saved my life. I made an 'excellent' recovery from polio. I went from the iron lung, through numerous operations during many summers when other young people were at home, playing and being children. I was in a hospital 400 miles from my parents and family who came to see me once a month. I learned quickly to hide pain, to not complain, to be a happy cripple. It would be great to see a video or hear a story of that part of the polio epidemic. Polio survivors married at the same rate as the 'normal' population, succeeded beyond the norm. Most went on to college, got good jobs, worked hard and contributed. We had no choice. We were taught from the beginning that if we wanted to be 'normal' we had to push ourselves to the extreme. Post Polio Syndrome was our reward. Now, I am back in the wheelchair or using canes and braces, and living with pain. But, the lessons of childhood remain. Do not complain. I 'unlearned' that lesson, and I complain. For those out there who are living with PPS, there are answers to pain. Find a doctor who is certified to deal with pain management. Your family doctor is not the one. Ignore the literature from the supposed experts on post polio who say the pain is no so bad and does not need to be treated with narcotics. Ignore them when they tell you a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory will work. It will not. It will kill your liver and damage your kidneys. The quality of your life is more important that satisfying the ego of a doctor who knows nothing of polio or what you are going through. See a pain specialist (a certified pain specialist) and get help. For those who watch this video and think the epidemic is part of the past, know this, because of the propaganda of the anti-immunization crowd and the Islamic fundamentalists, polio is back. It was never gone. The polio virus is all around us. Immunize your children and make sure your grandchildren receive the gift of immunization. All the non-immunized children who are now refugees are potential victims. Soon, doctors and the public will again be familiar with the polio epidemic. AGAIN.",1441152000,2,2333,4.466042154566745
2196191,5,B0006U5V9E,This was an interesting series that showed the history of polio.  The old pictures and videos were great to see.  I loved the interviews/commentary with survivors of the disease that took place during the show.,1441152000,,210,4.9714285714285715
2196192,5,B0006U5V9E,"I am a child of the 70s with a mother from the 50s. We had a relative who had polio as a child, she was an Aunt of my grandparents. I didn't realize that there were pretty much three strains of polio, and that there were two vaccine types. I have children of my own and I made sure they were vaccinated, but only because I was vaccinated. I will have them watch this (it's not overly frightening) with me soon... I'm so glad I watched this. It was an eye opener - and it included interviews with people who had polio, or had family members with polio...",1440892800,2,553,4.12962962962963

I grew up in Protection, KS, the first 100% polio vaccinated town in the US, so one would think I would have picked the significance along the way. This video walked me through why the disease increased in the numbers it attacked, the history behind the disease, the race for a vaccine, and why we live pretty much worry-free today.  I didn't need a PhD to understand it due to it being very viewer friendly.  I found it a great comprehensive step before I dove deeper into researching for a project I'm working on.

8043357,4,B0006U5V9E,"I am old enough that I remember seeing adults with paralyzed limbs, people had the big immunization scar and I got the got the polio vaccine on the sugar cube.

It was very interesting to see the immensity - and terror - of the epidemic, the stories of people who lived through it and how society united against this killer.

One thing they didn't mention, that I thought of.  They talked about children not getting the immunities because we were 'too clean'.  What they didn't mention was that it was against popular trend to nurse infants -- formula was in!  It was considered very gauche to breastfeed.  I would like to see a comparison of the polio rates between formula and breastfed children.",1464566400,,698,4.634146341463414
8043358,4,B0006U5V9E,A well done over view of a time I can barely remember but do remember the fear of the unknown.  Also remember the relief that the introduction of the vaccine brought and the over whelming participation in the national immunization effort.,1464566400,,238,4.804878048780488

8043360,5,B0006U5V9E,"This is a fascinating, well-done documentary from the late nineteen nineties on the history of polio and its rise in the United States to epidemic proportions from 1916 to the  mid 1950s, when the first successful vaccine was introduced. Of course, in the United States poliomyelitis, or the infantile paralysis disease, as it was often called, is now virtually a thing of the past. There was a time in this country, however, when this disease was ever prevalent, affecting and old alike, as adults also got it. In fact, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt got this disease as an adult, before he became president. Indirectly thanks to him, the March of Dimes organization was born. This organization initially raised money to fund reasearch against polio.

This documentary is filled with interviews with quite a number of  persons who contracted polio as a child and were still alive at the time of the filming of  this documentary. Amazingly, one of these persons has lived encased in an iron lung most of her life. Their reflections and reminiscences are interesting in terms of the impact that polio has had on their lives. There are also interviews with health care professionals who worked with those who had contracted the disease and what it was like to do so at a time when there was nothing that one could do to prevent anyone from contracting this disease.  Moreover, the archival film footage contained in this documentary bespeaks volumes of  the scourge that was polio.

Young people today do not have a clue what life was like in the days before the polio vaccine. Beginning in 1955, which marked the end of the reign of polio,  inoculation against this disease became the standard. Eventually, the discoveries of Doctors Salk and Sabin would virtually eradicate polio from our national consciousness. As a 1951 baby, I remember getting shots against polio (Salk), followed by a lollipop, and also getting it orally  in a sugar cube (Sabin). Yet, I also  remember seeing older children, for whom these  discoveries came too late,  weighed down by  heavy metal and leather braces or in wheelchairs. I was one of the lucky ones.

This is an informative and immensely interesting documentary. I was riveted from start to finish. Those who are against innoculations should view this film to see what life was like in a world without inoculation against the stark reality of polio.",1463702400,,2392,4.932668329177058
