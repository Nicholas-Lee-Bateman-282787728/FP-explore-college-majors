8143444,3,B000I2J722,The trama of the soap is the problem.  I think that this particular soap is realistic.  There were a lot of parts that had a chance to be realistic and it wasn't.  The actors were ok but they looked like nobates.  There is nothing wrong but it shoes on the acting.  There were ggod things also.  That's why I rated as a 3 not good but no terrible.,1252800000,,347,4.029411764705882
