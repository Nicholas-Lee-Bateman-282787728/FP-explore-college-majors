The MUSIC is great - I play it all the time!!!",1150848000,8,265,4.3
2429385,5,B000BNC3GK,"I bought this DVD with the intention of trying something a little different

than the yoga classes offered at my local gym.  Being intermediate, at best,

at yoga and a true beginner at meditating, I found the workshop to be a

great place for me to start out.  I thought that I would never be one to

meditate (as many others may feel), because my mind races with a million

thoughts at once- how can I possibly clear my mind in this day in age?

Well, with the aid of this DVD, I learned that meditation is something I can

do- in fact; its the perfect cure if Im stressed.

I like that the yoga and meditation sections, although separate, work with

one another under the same principle of each chapter. Although it is not

explicitly stated, the principles of meditation explained in the beginning

of the chapter are used later on to center ones self mentally in the yoga

section.  Breathing is stressed throughout both the yoga and meditation

sections in order to keep the body and mind centered with one another.

Ordinarily I lack proper breathing techniques when practicing yoga, but by

using the meditation exercises from the chapter, I found that my yoga

definitely improved and the fluid-like movements that Cyndi executed seemed

to become a lot smoother for me.

This DVD is less of a how-to set of instructions for meditation and yoga,

and more of a guided journey that expands beyond the length of the teaching.

David even says in the very first chapter that the DVD is meant to be

watched as a guide through the principles of yoga and meditation and can be

referred back to in order to gain more perspective or as the framework of

your own experience. I watched the DVD through twice before I attempted

meditating on my own.  Eventually as I got the hang of it, I only used it as

a reference point for when I got stuck.

All-in-all, I loved the DVD.  It's definately worth checking out.",1150761600,18,1914,4.524926686217009
8089267,3,B000BNC3GK,"I was interested in this set for a couple of reasons.  First, it includes a CD of yoga music.  I'm a yoga instructor, and I'm always looking for new music to play in my classes.  Second, although I've practiced yoga for over 15 years, I've struggled to adopt a regular meditation practice, and so I had hoped that the the practices on the included DVD would be helpful with this.  This ""workshop"" includes the music CD, the DVD with the meditation and yoga practices, and a detailed information booklet, all in eco-friendly cardboard packaging (I liked this!).

I'll start with the CD, which is my favorite part of this set.  It offers a mix of vocal and instrumental tunes.  Prior to acquiring this set, I could not find a list of the tracks anywhere, so I'll put them here as the appear in the included booklet.
1. ""Memories of Summer as a Child"" - David Nichtern (9:10)
2. ""Wondrous Skies"" - Emilia Sosa (4:33)
3. ""Phoenix Rising"" - David Nichtern (8:26)
4. ""Tuesday"" - tj Rehmi (4:19)
5. ""Blues for Baba"" - Krishna Das (9:10)
6. ""The Sunrise"" - tj Rehmi (6:11)
7. ""Mesa Mocha Grande"" - David Nichtern (6:49)
8. ""Don't Run Away"" - Sultan Khan/Rare Elements (5:22)
9. ""Cassiopia"" - Michael Hewett/Ally (4:17)
10. ""Breeze of Delight"" - Steve Gorn/Jamie Lawrence (6:40)

I was significantly less enamoured with the DVD.  First, I do not feel that it is described accurately, either in the product description or on the product case.  The case states that there are 4 yoga and 5 meditation sessions.  It is true that there are 4 short yoga segments, but there are actually only 2 meditation sessions--the other three segments are meditation ""talks"" (see below for more details).  Furthermore, the product case states that the yoga sequences are appropriate for beginners/intermediates, but I would absolutely NOT recommend the yoga practices on this DVD for beginners!

Below are the sequences as described on the DVD Main Menu.  Following this, I will provide more descriptive information.

1. Making Friends with Yourself
--Meditation Instruction

2. Dynamic Equilibrium
--Meditation Talk

3.  Obstacles as Path

4.  Opening Your Heart

MAKING FRIENDS WITH YOURSELF starts with a 12:54 introduction to meditation lead by David Nichtern, who leads all of the meditation segments.  Nichtern is in front of a small class of students who are sometimes seen by the viewer.  The video quality is poor--as if someone sent up a home camera in the back of the room--and the some is sometimes out-of-sync as well.  He talks about the basic shamatha meditation from Tibetan Buddhism, which he translates as ""calm abiding.""  The last few minutes of this intro are a brief practice.  All of the yoga sequences are led by instructor Cyndi Lee, who cues via voiceover with two students present.  The first routine is 14:17 minutes and starts with a seated vinyasa (cat-cow, twist, lateral stretch) that moves fairly quickly.  Lee then goes through two rounds of sun salutations, chair pose, a reclined twist, plow, shoulderstand, and an extremely brief relaxation pose.

DYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM is supposed to be focused on finding balance.  Nichtern's lecture here is short (6:37).  He talks about how are expectations are ""traps,"" and he describes use of a ""touch and go"" technique.  For the yoga practice (14:01), Lee starts with a balanced breathing exercise.  Rocking on the spine, she comes into boat pose, table, and a simple twist.  From downward facing dog, she moves through crescent lunge, warrior 1, warrior 2, and half moon.  She finishes with the balance poses tree and eagle, and again offers a very brief relaxation.

OBSTACLES AS PATH again features a meditation talk by Nichtern (10:45).  He maintains that while practice is actually simple, meditation can require bravery and courage to stay with it.  For the yoga practice (14:04), Lee states that the focus will be on standing hip openers.  She starts seated in hero's pose but quickly comes to standing for warrior 1, warrior 2, side angle, triangle, and lizard lunge.  Returning to the floor, she performs a seated side saddle twist, wide angle lateral stretch with twist, forward bend, and brief relaxation.

OPENING YOUR HEART is the final segment, and it includes both meditation instruction and practice.  Nichtern starts (10:52) by talking about the idea of moving from practicing for oneself to practicing for others by direction one's thoughts in meditation.  He introduces maitri practice, which is another name for metta or lovingkindness meditation.  Nichtern describes the four slogans of goodwill used as part of this practice as well as how to send the loving thoughts towards a benefactor, self, and a neutral person.  A 10:14 minute practice of this technique then follows.  Lee begins the 14:23-minute yoga session lying over a blanket roll.  She then moves into down dog and a lunge series, including lunge with a lateral side stretch.  Next, she comes seated for a full cow-face pose (no modifications show).  This is followed by half-wheel (aka bridge pose) and then two repetitions of full wheel pose.  Lee concludes with supported shoulderstand using a block (aka L-pose).

I was disappointed to find that I did not like the instruction of either Nichtern OR Lee.  Nichtern comes across as VERY dry, not really connecting with the audience at all.  Although I actually LOVE lovingkindness meditation (please read Sharon Salzberg's wonderful book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lovingkindness-The-Revolutionary-Art-of-Happiness/dp/157062903X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lovingkindness: The Revolutionary Art of Happiness </a>&nbsp;for more on this), I did not enjoy this sequence from Nichtern AT ALL.  As noted above, I definitely did not find Lee's practices appropriate for beginners, as she includes poses that are intermediate and above, offers no modifications, and moves extremely quickly.  Even though I have many years of yoga experience and teach as well, these factors made Lee's routines much less enjoyable for me, also.

In the end, I am glad to have this set for the music, but I am guessing that most people will not want to purchase it for that reason alone.  I certainly can't recommend it for the meditation and yoga segments.",1492387200,,6402,5.188109161793372

It DVD is divided into 4 sections - each with a 15 minute meditation lesson and a 15 minute complete yoga practice.  The final section also contains a guided meditation by David, which is a neat way to tie everything together you learn in the earlier sections.  There is also a music CD in the box for your own personalized practice.  Both David and Cyndi are amazing, warm teachers who make yoga and meditation approachable and fun.

8089275,5,B000BNC3GK,"I have purchased several yoga DVDs in the past, but always found myself bored after only a few viewings. This yoga routine is much different than the others in that it consistently engages you in your movement and thoughts at an effective pace. The meditation segments are great on those days that I need to relax but am feeling a little too lazy to go through the whole yoga routine. David Nichtern is great at explaining the history of each exercise and puts in simple words the difficult concepts that are usually associated with deep meditation. Aside from these positives, the music CD that comes inside the DVD is nice to have around, even in the car, to take a mental break whenever it's convenient. It helps me to remember the methods David teaches in his segment and get right back into the swing of things. I'm very pleased with my purchase and feel this is one of the best meditation/yoga combination DVDs ive seen.",1151280000,12,926,4.618181818181818
