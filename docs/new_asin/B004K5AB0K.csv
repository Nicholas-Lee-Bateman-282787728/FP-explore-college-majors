8432409,5,B004K5AB0K,"This is a great Korean Drama. It's interesting and keeps you wondering for the next episode. You grow to cheer on the characters as the movie progresses.  It's sad, funny and keeps you in suspense.  Great choice!!",1369008000,,213,4.72972972972973
8432410,5,B004K5AB0K,"I have not purchased this exact DVD set, but I've watched the entire series twice now and must say it is one of my favorite stories of all time.  It's full of great characters and lessons that are wonderful for adults as well as children.  You just can't keep the smile off your face as you watch, although there are a few tear-jerker moments as it really does cover the full spectrum of life's emotions.  I nicknamed this show ""The Food Angel"" because the main character Sung-Chan spends a lot of the series solving people's problems with food; like a Guardian Angel Chef. This may sound corny but it is pulled off in a very realistic and moving way, and is not at all ""Hallmark"" in it's resolutions.

GREAT FOR KIDS
I'm currently watching the full subtitled season with an 11-year-old and she can't get enough of it.  After over an hour of reading subtitles she begs me to put on the next episode.  It's a great way to get young kids to read AND learn about forgiveness, living-in-the-moment, kindness, talent and the dangers of over-ambition.  It also has very good female characters of all ages -- not just the ""love interest"" that most western stories are stuck on -- which I find very helpful for young girls growing up in our culture.  The male characters also cover a wide range, from rich businessmen to a happy-go-lucky vagabond.

THEMES AND OVERALL FEEL
The lesson of the series is to show the dangers of over-ambition and the joys of living-in-the-moment and being true to yourself; as well as showing the heroic value of sacrifice and forgiveness.  It is very relaxing and a lot of the show is shot in the Korean countryside which is just beautiful.  That isn't to say there aren't a few tense moments, and the plot definitely moves along.  It does have a love story, but it is not as prominent as in a lot of Korean dramas and it definitely isn't as hard on your heart-strings.  All in all you will meet a lot of characters that you will grow to love and you will be sad when it is over.

If you liked this series I would strongly recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kimchi-Family-Fermented-Family-Korean-Drama-with-English-Sub-All-Region-DVD-6DVD-Set-Complete-Series-1-24/dp/6165001874/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kimchi Family / Fermented Family (Korean Drama with English Sub, All Region DVD, 6DVD Set, Complete Series 1-24)</a>.",1368403200,,2394,5.0585241730279895
8432411,5,B004K5AB0K,"I was sick with fever/chills and severe stomach pains. I couldn't do anything but rest for days, no heavy work, and definitely no food. But I had this around from an earlier purchase.

Normally, Korean Drama, while interesting, is something I watch slowly. I get busy, and I forget about it, being that I have several things I could be doing. Well, um, it's been three days, and I've already finished almost all of volume 1! Not only that, but my appetite definitely has returned, even if my stomach isn't 100% yet.",1367366400,,515,4.5978260869565215
8432412,5,B004K5AB0K,"As a foodie the series definitely delivers. Even though there is a link between the episodes, they are in themselves complete as individual instalments. The acting, the content and the food photography are all excellent.",1363824000,,220,5.314285714285714
8432413,5,B004K5AB0K,"This is a very interesting series. It teaches a great deal about Korean cooking and business in a huge Korean restaurant. Rivalry abounds. Sinister plots take place. Love blooms and love challenges. Love between a step parent and an adopted son is beautiful. Between stepbrothers turns into painful jealousy and spite. When I received word that Ya Entertainment is shutting down, I decided to purchase as many of their series as I am able. Amazon does a good job with availability and prices. This is the best production company. It is sad to see it go. I hope the other companies improve their translations. I always felt safe buying from Ya and Amazon. I would recommend this series. It keeps one intersted for many hours of enjoyment and don't be surprised if you don't get hungry for Korean beef and seafood dishes.",1352937600,,819,4.774647887323944
8432414,5,B004K5AB0K,"I enjoyed the series when it was first broadcast on PBS, so felt I would also enjoy a second viewing.  It makes the many characters more recognizeable; the food presentations are awsome and the scenery shot on location was very nice. I had the atlas in hand to follow some of the mentioned locations.  It makes me want to visit Korea.  I find it nice to view a series where emotions are toned down and some things are left to the viewer's imagination.  The disc about how the series was made I also enjoyed very much.",1319673600,,517,4.354166666666667
8432415,5,B004K5AB0K,Loved this movie. Great story with good principles and character build. I will enjoy watching it again and sharing it with family.,1313971200,2,130,4.954545454545454
8432416,5,B004K5AB0K,"After watching the Dae Jang Geum, the Chosun Dynasty Korean Cooking Drama, I thought that this would be fun to watch. I watched The Grand Chef Part II on Netflix first. Netflix did not have Part I, so I bought the whole thing here on Amazon. My wife & I really enjoyed seeing the entire series. Afterwards we bought The Grand Chef movies that came out before and after this Drama. Note: The Grand Chef movie #1 is hard to find and only available in Region 3 DVD (Korea), you need a Region Free DVD player to watch it here in the USA. The Second movie is available in Region 1 DVD (USA). Enjoy the drama and the cooking.",1304726400,3,619,4.2100840336134455
8432417,5,B004K5AB0K,"I watched Grand Chef with my whole family. Our three kids (ages 5, 10, 12) all loved it. The story was gripping. Every episode was full of surprises. The cooking sequences were absolutely amazing. Wow, we learned A LOT about Korean food. The acting was wonderful. Just the facial expressions of some of the actors in certain comedic situations were so memorable. We replayed many scenes over and over, enjoying them again and again. We even purchased the musical soundtrack to this series. So many good songs!

If you love good stories, good acting, and love learning about new cultures, this TV series is definitely for you. It's a really good time. We are all sad it's over.",1296172800,6,676,4.728813559322034
