7799318,3,1580022642,ORDERED THIS FOR MY MOTHER-IN-LAW'S 96TH BIRTHDAY AS HER FAVORITE SAINT IS ST. ANTHONY OF PADUA.  WITH THE SUBTITLES IT WAS TOO HARD FOR HER TO KEEP UP EVEN WITH THE HELP OF A SON AND DAUGHTER.  PROBABLY NOT A GOOD IDEA AFTER ALL.  I SHOULD GET THIS BACK AND WATCH IT MYSELF AS I LOVE THE TUSCAN COUNTRYSIDE AND HAVE VISITED ASSISSI.,1404259200,,333,4.253968253968254
