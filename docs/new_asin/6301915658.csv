7816750,3,6301915658,"It's a shame that Richard Lynch so often plays a  ruthless killer - but he does it so damn good !. And he's especially nasty in this low-budget production. -I haven't seen him this cruel since ""Invasion  U.S.A."". There's not much of a story, but who cares; if you're a Lynch  fan you'll want it no matter what, ofcourse. It's a crazy price, hopefully  it'll go down soon.",935452800,7,371,4.411764705882353
