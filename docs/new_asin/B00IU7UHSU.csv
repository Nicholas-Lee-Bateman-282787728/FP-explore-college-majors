6297342,5,B00IU7UHSU,"wow i really cant say enough good things about this film, the acting is really superb for a gay erotic pornography. me and pals watched this together and we could barley get through the whole thing it was getting us so hot. beefcake has made me a believer! i am a fan for life!",1010275200,11,277,4.148148148148148
6297343,4,B00IU7UHSU,"Beefcake is a documentary and a gem of a movie all rolled into one.  Its focal point is the physique magazines of the 40's and 50's.  The director shows the steamier and more homoerotic side (as if it needed more of one) of these magazines.  It also covers how they came to be and why they dissappeared off of magazine shelves.  Before watching the movie i knew very little about it except that it was gay themed and discussed muscle boys.  Even though i really couldn't care less for muscle boys, i still watched the movie and i am glad i did..  It's colors are very visually stimulating and the images are great..  The documentary moments are amusing and the film moments are even funnier.  I would reccomend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh and just enjoy a good movie.",991008000,26,779,4.436619718309859
6297344,5,B00IU7UHSU,Well what can I say? This movie pleasantly surprised me and is a nostalgic and very revealing look at the 1950's Physique models. Gee these guys had great bodies and not the bulging muscles u see in todays magazines. If u are offended by male nudity steer clear of this one as it leaves nothing to the imagination. The soundtrack is great the acting above average and the crossovers to real interviews and back to the storyline is very good. Joe Dellesandro is featured in the interviews and in the bonus section of the DVD is a very revealing what u could call screen test of a very young and well endowed Joe. 10 out of 10,989971200,17,624,4.3418803418803416
6297345,3,B00IU7UHSU,"Countless people will watch this DVD just for the...well, beefcake. And they'll find an abundance of that. But Beefcake is surprisingly funny. It also provides an interesting study into human desire, as well as attempts to destroy those desires, or disguise them as something else.",983059200,11,281,5.266666666666667
6297346,2,B00IU7UHSU,"Four stars for the film, no stars for the DVD. What I absolutely do not get is why this film is presented in 1.33:1 aspect ratio.

6297349,5,B00IU7UHSU,"This was an interesting film as it was based on a true story and involved commentary from people who knew the man--Bob Mizer. Presented in a story telling format but with nice visuals. Good nudity, not vulgar.",1377043200,,209,4.675675675675675
6297350,5,B00IU7UHSU,"While the movie side is corny,the out takes and feature's are worth the price. The models are steroid free and look natural.",1360627200,,124,4.681818181818182
6297351,5,B00IU7UHSU,"This product, half documentary, half movie was enlightening.  It is both funny and nostalgic, which is a decent combination especially for the time the film was made, a time that included narration, which carries over in both movie genres.  Initially, the viewer is greeted with an array of photography in black and white, one after the other accompanied by two kinds of real nice music, first an upbeat tune and then a sentimental classical piece.

The movie starts with an interview that was a bit offsetting because I was expecting a full movie like ""The Notorious Betty Page""  There were sections of the film that reminded me of that, but the cinematography was even prettier, more velvety and lush.  The actress playing Mr. Mizer's mother didn't pull heartstrings even near the end, but she was really fun to watch, see, and hear. The potentially controversial aspect of this film, for some, was what looked like a  ""child actor"" playing Mr. Mizer in 1934 when he began taking physique photos. The actor did a good job, funny also, like his liberal mother, and cast Mizer in a very focussed role early on, who nevertheless seemed to retain that character all of his life.

Overall, one is left  with a trip down memory lane during a period that beautiful bodies were almost too good to be true.  It can also be recommended for those who just want to enjoy that ""thing of beauty"" that is wonderful to some, and best left alone to others.  Bob Mizer left a record of physical culture that has made my life more enjoyable and my understanding of ""bello"" far more complete.

Finally, there are five or six short films at the end offered as a bonus; they alone could be worth the price of the DVD.",1356480000,,1697,4.623333333333333

6297353,5,B00IU7UHSU,"This movie was very interesting to me, as it addressed gay pornography before my time and when I was too young to view it. It was part documentary, part re-enactment, and a visual masterpiece. It was interesting to learn about the Athletic Model Guild, and its daringness for the times. It took major balls to have pursued the photographing of bare-assed men in a g-string or guys that were fully nude. There was an innocence to the photographs and to the models, too.  As a kid, I had not known that there were photos of naked men before Playgirl came along. The first Playgirl that I had seen was the March 1975 issue. The gloriously hairy Al Cavuoto was the centerfold and was a source of amazement for me. After watching Beefcake, I can see what went on before the mainstream male erotica came forth.",1354406400,,804,4.544827586206897
6297354,5,B00IU7UHSU,"So, this comes across as a mockumentary, but it is suppose to be 100% true. It certainly doesn't have widespread interest, but I really enjoyed it, in its own silly way.",1343865600,2,169,4.483870967741935
6297355,5,B00IU7UHSU,"Just purchased this film and have watched it several times - I LOVED IT.  The film intersperses actual footage from AMG with dramatizations of
  Bob Mizer's life AND his lifetime pursuit of capturing male beauty, beginning with the ""photo sessions"" he staged as a child in his own attic,
  when he recreated scenes of naked ""Romans"", lounging on his mother's wedding gown.  The film is well-acted - and there is definitely an
  innocence and simplicity that is prevalent in the earnestness of all performances. In particular, the actress portraying Bob's mother reveals many
  conflicting emotions.  She is both heartbreaking and hilarious.
Many of the actual models / films / and photo sessions have been re-enacted with current look-alike actors, in a very clever mix of past and present.  Plus, there is much double-entendre humor, which gay audiences will appreciate.  The script is well-written, and successfully captures the ambiance
  of 1950's southern California and the ""world"" of Bob Mizer.
As added surprise, the interviews with models such as Joe D'Allessandro and Jack LaLanne helped to present the history of beefcake photography, even
  giving this production a documentary feel.  The men reminisce about their youth, sharing honest memories about the time period, while reflecting
  upon their own experiences in Mizer's studio.  It was somewhat touching, in fact, to see these men in the present--still physical and beautiful--
  in recent footage that is aligned with photos taken of them for AMG and Physique Pictorial in their younger days.
At the same time, while lighthearted, amusing, and thoroughly entertaining throughout - (and WHAT'S not to like, all these gorgeous nude men??!!??)-
  the movie does not sugar-coat the more sordid aspects of what may have really transpired behind what was being marketed as ""fitness"" on display.
  Mizer's own secret ""codes"" for his models suggests that his ""business"" was apparently a cover for illegal prostitution.  Both the trial and its
  sad outcome are presented for your consideration.  The actor portraying the young teen on the witness stand gives another stand-out performance,
  truthful and authentic; in fact, the boy's actual trial testimony forms the basis of this segment of the screenplay.
Therefore - I felt this narration was balanced and informative - and without doubt, one of the most interesting movies I've watched.  Some of the
  AMG models are re-created by actors who portray adorable, playful, country-boy innocents - while other actors present the more hardened, the
  less likeable, the druggie, the darker side of porn.  I think the use of these two contrasting ""character"" types serves as a metaphor for the feel
  of this entire film, and as ""description,"" those character types are certainly inclusive of the whole historical AMG phenomenon.
A film history - but VERY cleverly done, and so entertaining.  (Yummy, too, from start to finish!)",1328659200,3,2937,5.268398268398268
6297356,5,B00IU7UHSU,Beefcake gave a perspective on the male porn industry I was unaware of.  It showed friendships and diversity.  It was not a porn flick but is more of a testimonial.  Anyone would benefit by watching this because it shows a different side of a industry.  The conceptions you may have of gay porn and its history will be dispelled after watching this movie.  Be ready for not only a eye opening experience but also a soul awakening when you watch this movie!,1296518400,,456,4.512195121951219
6297357,5,B00IU7UHSU,"Interesting and informative docu/drama of the pioneering male nude photographer and short film maker Bob Mizer, told by some of the actual models including Joe Dellasandro of Andy Warhol fame.  Great acting but some shaky production values due to the budget limitations of the film makers.  They audio commentary adds a lot too.",1280102400,,328,5.169811320754717
6297358,5,B00IU7UHSU,"How did I miss this movie when it came out?  I happened upon it in Amazon, and since the price was right, I thought I'd take a chance on it.  It is part documentary/part recreation of the career of Bob Mizer who created and published Physique Pictorial in the 1950's and 1960's.  The movie is very funny and not at all insulting to its subject.  Since I was not there I cannot say how accurate it is, and the ex-models they interview are clearly trying to gloss over their shady pasts, but as far as I can tell it gives a lot of insight into a world once scandalous, and now old fashioned and unnecessary.  It kind of makes you nostalgic for the old days.  If you are interested in the subject or the way things were before the sexual revolution, it will not disappoint you.",1226793600,,774,4.267123287671233
6297359,4,B00IU7UHSU,This is a great documentary slash story. All of us who've browsed the muscle mags at the supermarket with embarrassed discretion when the grocery moms wheelled down the aisle now know we were not alone. Fabulously presented.,1199577600,2,224,5.081081081081081
6297360,5,B00IU7UHSU,"Outstanding. Superior dramatization of the life and works of Bob Mizer. There are not enough accolades to describe this extraordinary look back at the fifties/early sixties. Particularly noteworthy is the actual glimpse of film footage of Dick Dubouis - one of his most incredible models. Surprisingly enough, there are no actual film flashbacks of Ed Fury and Bud Counts who also were some of his more featured models. It is extremely hard to believe that Mr. Mizer did not take advantage of all those opportunities with the many models available on his property 24/7 and only had an encounter with the single model. As illuded to in the film, many models where in need of additional cash. It would probably be factual to believe that higher prices were offered for more revealing shots. In addition, it is curious that other photographers such as Douglas of Detroit, Pat Milo and others of the same era featured many more full frontal shots of their model where as Mizer seemed to favor posing straps. Again, extremely hard to believe that there are not similar photographs available by him. From a collector of vintage beefcake prespective you become aware of this fact as you view other books by various other photographers.  Any collector who possesses Mizer frontal photographs is sitting on a gold mine - this treasure trove is out there somewhere and should be shared. Should a collection be gathered and produced for publication it would be impossible to keep in stock due to the enormous demand. This is a must have DVD for any collector of vintage athletic models. Spectacular. A true find!",1191715200,3,1601,4.907749077490775
6297361,4,B00IU7UHSU,"Beefcake is a bright fun movie, that looks at the beginings of the modern

gay porn era.

 The movie focuses on Bob Mizer and his Athletic Model Guild Studio.

Started at first as a modeling agency for male physique models.

The enterprizing Mizer soon discover that his photos of the handsome semi-nude men were more in demand than the models themselves!

 Thus began an industry based the (gay) erotisim of physical male beauty.

You might say that Mizer is the father of the modern gay male magazine. and that Physique Pictorial (his magazine) is the precusor of such modern 'zines as Unzipped, XY, DNA, Blue, Advocate Men (and its various off-shoots)and many others.

 The movie begins in a courtroom with Mizer on trial on charges of disseminating obscene material through the US mail. As well as charges that his bussiness was engaged in male prostition as well. (While convicted of the former. He is aquited of the latter.)

 The rest of the film is played out through the eyes of a young man named Neil O'Hara (ie. Neely O'Hara from Valley of The Dolls) who becomes one of Mizer's models.

 He is there at the begining of AMG. And is there as Mizer and his

studio begins its slide downward from tasteful male nude photogaphy, to  distateful lewd pictures,(ie full-frontal nudity).

 Beefcake is not to be taken as a serious documentry or bio on Bob Mizer.

For that, read the book on which the movie is taken from ""Beefcake"" by Valintine F. Hooven.

 It is a humorous look at how the modern gay male magazine began.",1160784000,4,1524,4.654135338345864
6297362,4,B00IU7UHSU,"Wow I was born 35 years late - the 50's look so ""innocent"" compared to the 00's ""in your face"" flagrance. I liked this movie - Tons of Hot Guys basking poolside or posing for the camera, campy `50's intros & jingles with interesting commentaries from the people who were there and an interesting story of the male physique, how to flaunt it and the Dangers of Obsessing Over It.

Campy, Fun, Hot & Sweaty! Some Like it Hot!",1153008000,8,423,4.3544303797468356
6297363,4,B00IU7UHSU,"First of all, for those of you out who like straight-forward plot lines with twists and turns throughout, object to male nudity and get bored if something doesn't blow up in the first 15 minutes - then do not watch this movie.
As for the rest of us, who can appreciate intelligent mock-u-mentory styled films, ""BeefCake"" is a fabulous way to spend a Sunday evening.  Through flashback sequences, photo clips and interiews with ex-hustlers/models from the 1950's, we receive the story of Robert Henry Mizer and his Athletic Model Guild. The movie jumps around a bit between Mizer's history with his pulp art magazine, his legal troubles for running escorts as well as the interviews, which makes one wonder how scatterbrained director Thom Fitzgerald really is.  But the acting is good, the scenes are funny/interesting and there's plenty of male nudity to go around.  Where can you go wrong?",1063411200,29,891,4.966442953020135
6297364,3,B00IU7UHSU,"An interesting film, respectful and with a touch of humour. Not a ""must see"" material but nothing I felt sorry  after buying it.",1043539200,8,128,4.565217391304348
6297365,4,B00IU7UHSU,"Beefcake is a light-hearted, semi-documentary about the life and times of a muscle-magazine, Physique pictorial. Published during the puritanical 1950ies, it made quite a stir.
PP was the original hunk-o-rama, with hundreds of smiling, tanned and muscled young men flashing their goods at you. Of course, it was not strictly a nude-mag (the models wore small pouches in front of you know what..) but the gay readers had a field time anyway! The publishers also made short films featuring their hunky stars. It was all marketed as ""promoting health and physical fitness in young minds""
Looking back at those ""innocent"" times from this liberal day and age, we can only smile at the cunning and bravery that went into it. The brains behind PP, Bob Mizer, was actually jailed and fined several times on charges of renting out his models as escorts to rich men. Still, the mag continued into the 60's and 70's.
Watching Beefcake is like flipping through those pages of PP, stopping occasionally for some reconstructed dramatic scenes. But the best parts are watching the guys modelling, doing some amateur acting in front of Mizer's camera and generally horsing around. Great fun!
There are several interviews with the guys who posed for the mag, one of them, Joe Dallesandro, apparently did his posing mostly nude! There is, in fact, copious nudity in Beefcake, and the men are all fabulous looking.

There are some great contemporary songs on the soundtrack, as well. A good time movie for the (mostly) gay crowd.",1025568000,69,1510,4.968379446640316
