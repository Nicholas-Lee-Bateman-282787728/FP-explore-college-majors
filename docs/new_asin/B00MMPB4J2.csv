8672983,5,B00MMPB4J2,"One of the best old time baseball movies.  Real Americana  My grandfather played semi-pro ball with Joey Brown.  Joey was a very good ball player and we have a federation ball field named after him in North Toledo.  You will enjoy the start of the movie with Sterling Hayden answering the phone, when the big leagues call for Joey",1435017600,3,330,4.5423728813559325
