7867044,2,6304290845,"Chuck Norris' not very talented son stars as a disgraced police officer turned nightclub hypnotist who is paid a thousand dollars cash after closing time to hypnotise a man who thinks he is the reincarnation of Jack the Ripper.  Coincidentally, there are also a series of ripper like murders occurring in the city.  Unfortunately, the former cop's colleagues don't take his suspicions seriously, leading to a cat and mouse game that would have worked a lot better if Mike Norris could act.

Timothy Bottoms, at least, holds up his end with a flamboyant turn as the Jack the Ripper wannabe, giving a performance that is alternately amusing and menacing, but Ripper Man never works when he isn't onscreen which is, unfortunately, much of the time.  Mike Norris simply lacks the acting chops, looks, screen presence or anything else that would make him a suitable motion picture lead.  Sofia Shinas is likable as the nightclub waitress who takes a liking to the hero for reasons that are a bigger mystery to the audience than anything in the plot.  She's so far out of Mike Norris' league in terms of looks and acting ability that the actress ultimately just ends up making him look worse.

A smarter movie would have played more with the possibility that Timothy Bottoms was simply a fruitcake and had some fun making the audience wonder if he was or wasn't the real killer--but Ripper Man never goes down that road, remaining frustratingly twist free from beginning to end.

This might have been a halfway decent B-movie with a better lead or if Timothy Bottoms had been given a whole lot more screen time--but as is Ripper Man is pretty hard to sit through and definitely not worth the effort.",1458172800,,1693,4.773972602739726
7867045,2,6304290845,"This turned out to be a continuation of an OLD STORY and it is a modern day ""Jack The Ripper"" gore-fest type sick-flick . I only watched the first 30 minutes and that was all that I could take of it. There are so many great classic films out there and I was mad at myself for wasting time on this one. It has action, it has gore, it has shock factor and if you like those elemements then this film might be for you. I gave it two stars because it does have action that might appeal to some folks.",1368316800,,496,3.9207920792079207
