4107916,3,B003CI2G6S,"The major character in this large-scale film, ""Agora"" (2009) is Hypatia of Alexandria (350? - 415 A.D.), a beautiful and brilliant philosopher and mathematician performed by Rachel Weisz.  Set in Alexandria, Egypt, this film is an expensive, lavish production, a throwback in many ways to other extravagant epics set in ancient Greece or Rome.  The film is Spanish in origin and directed by Alejandro Amenebar. The movie is serious in intent. It portrays Hypatia as a scholar without religious belief intent only upon free disinterested scientific inquiry.  She is caught in the turbulence of 4th Century Alexandria in the decaying Roman Empire in the violence among pagans, Jews, and Christians.  The violence results in the destruction of the storied Library of Alexandria, a treasure house of wisdom in the ancient world.  Religious fanaticism and sectarianism also leads to Hypatia's death at the hands of a Christian mob.

Other than Weisz' portrayal of the heroine, the acting in this movie tends to be wooden and the dialogue stilted. The most effective scenes are those of Hypatia in her study.  She is a renowned teacher whose students include individual from all creeds and status united only by the desire to learn. She is a geometer who has studied the properties of cones. A student of Ptolemy, Hypatia becomes skeptical of his geocentric model of the solar system in which the earth is at the center. She becomes interested in the theory that the planets revolve around the sun. The difficulties she finds in this theory result from, among other things, the teleological view of reality she inherits from Plato and Aristotle which teaches that movement of astronomical bodies in their orbits must be circular because the circle is the most perfect shape. The movie shows Hypatia working away from this theory towards a more modern understanding.

Much of the movie consists of the mob scenes and violence common to epic films of the ancient world.  There is large-scale, brutal fighting between Christians and pagans and between Christians and Jews as the Christians are shown as mindlessly and violently destroying what was best in the ancient world.  In the film, Hypatia is shown as having at least three suitors, one a former slave, and another a highly placed prefect who tries to bring a balance between the claims of the Church and the competing voices of paganism.  Hypatia rejects romantic love in scenes that are muffled in their purpose and mostly confused.

The problem I found with the movie was that its format does not work to convey the complexity of the issues that it tries to raise.  Instead, it offers what on its face is a garish, expensive production which, whatever its virtues as entertainment, does not encourage reflection. ""Agora"" has its heart in the right place in its skepticism and commitment to free inquiry, but the cost is great oversimplification of philosophical and historical issues and anachronism. While this movie has been praised for its portrayal of free inquiry and for its critique of religious exclusivism, it doesn't grapple in any depth with its themes. A rather free-wheeling historical epic seems to me to contrast with the quiet, independent spirit and thought that the movie tries properly to attribute to Hypatia. I was frustrated by the movie and unconvinced that it left me wiser than I had been before about Alexandria, Hypatia, or religion and science.  It seems to me that the movie substitutes one set of oversimplified platitudes for another.

4107917,5,B003CI2G6S,"1500 years later, the story of Hypatia continues to rouse furious controversy. I recently came across a religious blog decrying AGORA which began: ""I have not actually seen the movie, and have no intention of doing so...All I know about it is what I have read in an article in the New York Times...""and then proceeded to ""debunk"" the movie. Thus making precisely the point that Amenbar is making in AGORA, about the pernicious nature of dogma. Bow down before my holy book, or die!

This is a magnificent movie, perhaps the best film ever made about the Ancient World, and visually one of the most beautiful films you'll ever seen. The soundtrack is as haunting as the visuals; the scene in which Orestes plays the pipes before a crowd of theater-goers in an attempt to woo Hyapatia could have become kitsch in lesser hands, but Amenbar imbues the moment with an unforgettable poignancy. This is also one of the scenes in which the camera rises high above the earth, establishing a cosmic viewpoint that informs the whole movie. There is true genius in the making of AGORA.",1280275200,131,1073,4.707446808510638
4107918,5,B003CI2G6S,"""Agora"", starring the luminous Rachel Weisz as Hypatia, a brilliant mathematician and academic, set in the amazingly rendered Alexandria of Egypt in 415 C.E., shows us the events leading up to her murder by what we would call a blue-collar Christian fundamentalist mob egged on by a Christian fundamentalist Regent of the church in competition with a more secular Christian Roman governor.

You can imagine a red state televangelist running for President against a Democratic senator from a blue state. Imagine the red states televangelist whipping up a frenzy of anger against a female college professor who had written a popular book about evolution who also happen to be a good friend of the Democratic senator. Now imagine that woman is assassinated by a crazy from a group of fundamentalists who were protesting that Senator.

This movie is part dramatic juggernaut and part clockwork examination of the battle between irrationality and all its power to compel with the luminance of reason and a transcendent love of knowledge for its own sake.

One thing might be a stumbling block. Hypatia in real life never discovered the heliocentric universe. However, the discovery of the sun centered solar system was a powerful choice as a literary device. You see, traditionally we have been taught a Earth centered view of the cosmos. By making the central metaphor a struggle to raise our view from a man-centered earth centered model of the universe to a impersonal Sun centered view of the universe we are seeing a metaphor for the struggle to displace irrationality with reason.

The great tragedy represented beautifully and heartfeltly in this movie is that the struggle for power is an appeal to the rationality and all of the good things that reason can give us can be burned up and turned to smoke.",1280275200,9,1806,4.990033222591362
4107919,5,B003CI2G6S,"I agree with the other reviewers in giving this movie five stars. It's a beautiful, thought-provoking and exciting film. But it doesn't need any sort of conspiracy to get a narrow distribution in the USA. It's just not a particularly commercial film, and that's a good thing! If one is going to suggest conspiracies, you could just as easily say there was some sort of ""Jewish conspiracy"" against the movie, as the film deplores bigotry of any kind, not just Christian fundamentalism.

You come away from the film with a great admiration for the heroine, and compassion for all people who try to forge a path of reason in a world of mindless hatred. ""Agora"" is well worth checking out. It's one of my two favorite films so far this year. The other is ""How to Train Your Dragon"" so I'm not an elitist!",1279497600,31,800,4.555555555555555
4107920,4,B003CI2G6S,"I watched the film earlier this year and am both touched and driven into anger.
Religions, or rather, organized religions, are a source of violence and tragedy, sometimes even more than a relief to human kind.  It is sometimes even worse than purely political violence as all religious fanatics believe God to be on their side and hence have a free license to destroy everything which is ""impure"".

Agora depicted a time when the old religions were swept aside in self-righteousness during the early rise of Christianity.  In the centureis to follow, matters would grow worse, culmulating in the horrifying Inquisition.

It is a good film, though short of making ""great"".  The director is in sympathy of the oppressed, both for the ones with alternative beliefs and the female gender.  It is a shame that one of the greatest female minds in history met such a sorrowful end.  The lesson should never be forgotten, though, sadly, it is repeatedly pushed aside admist the heat of religious hot-heads.",1278288000,13,998,4.940119760479042
4107921,5,B003CI2G6S,"Is it right to question?  Is it proper to doubt?  Is it the question itself, or the questioner, who offends in asking?  These are some of the issues presented in ""Agora"", the compelling film by Alejandro Amenabar starring Rachel Weisz.

The film presents the fascinating life of the Roman philosopher/mathematician/scientist Hypatia, a neo-Platonist philosopher of 4th century Alexandria.  Very little is known of her scientific or philosophical discoveries, as none of her writings survived the fall of Rome and the rise of Christianity.  What we do know of her comes from other writers of the period, who tell us she was widely regarded as the bright jewel of the empire for her wisdom, virtue and brilliant erudition.  The broader outlines of her life are known, as are the larger historical and cultural context in which she lived.

As the film opens, Hypatia is laboring to develop a theory that explains the orbits of the planets in contradiction to the accepted Ptolemaic model of the time.  Amenabar and his writer take a few artistic liberties in his presentation, as he imagines Hypatia's train of thought along these lines in the absence of any documentary evidence.  We just don't know if this was in fact the case. But never mind that, as Art is well served here.

Do the planets travel around the earth, or the sun?  Hypatia struggles relentlessly with this question against the backdrop of abrupt and shocking changes in Roman culture.  The early Christians have gained a political foothold with imperial favor, and begin to challenge the Pagans and Jews in the provincial capital.  The confrontations become violent.  As the Christians gain power, they repress any differences of belief and insist on agreement with their faith, often at the point of a sword.  Fascinated with this emerging model of the universe, Hypatia persists in her inquiries in the face of growing danger.

Amenabar has created a very convincing Alexandria.  The sets and costumes are wonderful, and the writing is quick and idiomatic.  Rachel Weisz gives another stand-out performance as a genius completely taken up with the creative process of thought.  Weisz's Hypatia is a woman of great perspicacity, intellectual honesty, personal warmth and moral courage.  She gives us the convincing internal struggle with a Really Big Idea, a feat of acting that requires great artistic restraint.  She succeeds admirably.  Hypatia's simple scientific experiments are mesmerizing and charged with drama.  Her intellectual struggles are at the same time rigorous and intuitive, deeply moving, yet not cold or distant. She cares about the people around her as much as her Really Big Idea.  The rest of the cast performs at the same superb level.

Much has been said elsewhere about the romantic interests in the film.  Fortunately, these are entirely secondary to the larger contrasts of the emerging cosmological model and the ultimate closing of the Roman mind.  And it is highly refreshing to see a plot driven by a conflict other than the typical Hollywood-formula ""love interest"".

In life, we know that Hypatia died a martyr to her beliefs.  We also know that this moment in European history marked the beginning of the end of the free-thinking philosophy peculiar to Classical, Hellenistic culture.  Which makes Hypatia's problems quite contemporary, as people everywhere face the same challenge today.  Is it good or right to question?  If history is any judge then it certainly is, because that is the only way one will arrive at the truth.",1277164800,389,3530,5.0834782608695654
4107922,5,B003CI2G6S,"The film received good review by New York Times.
I saw the film last night and was greatly touched
by the historical background which remains relevant
till today.
Why do mankind take religions into his/her own hand
to satisfy his/her own greed?
In the name of religion slaughtered hundreds and thousands
of human if not millions.",1277078400,12,329,4.892857142857143
4107923,5,B003CI2G6S,"The review by  Sarakani covers most of the bases, so I won't duplicate them here.  I will point out that the casting and acting were phenomenal.  The direction was very good, save for the fact that transitions from one scene to the next were sometimes to abrupt and tended to break the mood.  I will disagree with Sarakani on one thing.  This film is a much better film than Elizabeth Taylor's 'Cleopatra'.

I agree that there was a conspiracy to keep this film from wide distribution in the US.  The reason is quite simple.  Those who would distribute the film fear the right wing Chrisianity much as the pagans feared the Christian thugs in the time the film portrayed.

George Santayana said it best.  ""Those that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.""  Learn, people.",1275782400,184,785,4.615942028985507
4107924,5,B003CI2G6S,"Alexandria was one of the most glorious cities of Eurasia, a hybrid of three sets of cultures, European, Nubian and Asian created by Alexander and the Ptolemy dynasty around 320BCE.  Its heyday was probably around 200BCE and it lasted well over a millennium.  Alexandria was eclipsed by the dark ages around 415 when the whole of Egyptian history in the classical mould came to an end as Theodosius, the Emperor of a dying Rome imposed Christianity on Egypt.  Most temples, their gods and writings were destroyed or defaced, from Zeus in Olympia to the temple of Artemis at Ephesus in modern Turkey.  In Egypt the Seraphium was destroyed, a daughter library to the famous library of Alexandria that was probably largely destroyed around 50BCE when Julius Caesar took over Alexandria and Egypt fell under Roman sway.  This film is very much an encapsulation of the Christianisation of Alexandria and the destruction of its ancient ways, making it ripe for ruin and decay.  The one structure that did survive that forms a backdrop to this film is the Pharos lighthouse, created in 250BCE that survived all the way into around 1280 by which time Alexandria was part of the Islamic Empire.

As a satellite city of Rome, Alexandria still enjoyed a cultural and educational reputation at the time of Hypatia, a neoplatonist philosopher who had studied in Athens and Italy.  She taught at the Seraphaeum representing a sort of University/Library scholastic complex dedicated to learning.  Hypatia was part scientist and mathematician but also and no less importantly a philosopher.  She probably believed in transcendental modes of consciousness as taught by Plotinus.  She worked with her farther Theon and together they edited several works, clarified various mathematical books added their own contributions, none of which have survived (though some of Hypatias editing may be present in Greek mathematics that she helped transmit).  Hypatia invented or devised several scientific instruments.  She was obviously a person of importance, not merely a noted academic.  Towards 415AD there was a power struggle between the Roman prefect Orestes and the Roman Archbishop Cyril of Alexandria.  Orestes was allied with Hypatia and Cyril probably engineered her elimination as a symbol of paganism and witchcraft.

What facts we have come from the letters of her students among other works, including clergymen and the historian Socrates Scholasticus.  We know very little about whether the Serapheum had a large book collection and how much of the library of Alexandria had survived there into the time of Hypatia.

This film encapsulates the facts available in the context of a triangle of rivalry between Judaism, Christianity and Paganism and also a struggle between the Church and State.  It objectifies Alexandria seen from space.  The restoration of the city is very good but perhaps does not do justice to the glories of the city that once was that probably possessed more colour, rather than the dusty restoration the film presents.  I was disappointed that there were so many candles shown.  They did not use candles.  They used lamps of olive oil and we know much about these lamps from surviving examples.  So much more could have been shown about Hypatia herself, even as a semi fictitious character.  Maybe a vignette of her writing with a quill pen in lamp light, and how she travelled around in a carriage rather than on foot.  Here we do get glimpses of her with her students and a famous incident of her rebuffing one of them who declared his love for her.  This incident did take place.  More is shown of Hypatia the astronomer and scientist and less of her as a spiritual being, a philosopher though some indication is given.  My favourite line is concerns Hypatia stating that her father would have celebrated a conjunction between Mars and perhaps Jupiter in Aquarius.  Hypatia was no atheist secularist though she would have been a rational thinker who questioned dogma as the film tries to show.

I believe that given the limited resources the film commanded they have done the best they could.  Indeed certain details of the script reveal a depth of reading and research that is new to me to deserve exploration.  They concentrate on Hypatia formulating a heliocentric view of the Earth's rotation as stated by Aristarchus from one of his books.  We hear about this book from the ""mother library"" that once was in Alexandria of which the Serapheum, associated with Hypatia was a satellite.

In this film they indicate bloody conflicts arising between the pagans and the Christians.  I think that most of the aggression came from the Christians given they were supported by Rome and there isn't much evidence for the pagans attacking Christians in cold blood as indicated (though blood was probably spilt one way or another).  We are aware that the Serapheum was destroyed and the film recreates this incident on the basis of a precedent which is questionable.  Later we see another scene where the Jews rouse the ire of the Christians.  What is clear from history is that the Jews of Alexandria were attacked and dispersed, again rendered in unholy detail in this film.  The ancient anti semitism is portrayed very realistically and may arouse emotion.

The conflict between Orestes and St Cyril is dramatized extremely well leading to a rather tragic climax.  Rachel Weisz gives a good performance where Hypatia stands out like an English heroine.  The real Hypatia may have been a bit more tanned (and theoretically a lot older when she died) but Weisz is believable.  If only the props were a bit better, with lamps and a carriage for her.  Her face looks pained and haunted as she is lead to her death, dealt with rather sensitively if a touch unconvincingly given Hypatia's slave who softens the blow.

Dramatic license is acceptable and much of the context is very powerfully served up.  I could have watched a film an hour longer if necessary if more history was introduced.  We see the theatre and overall the city comes alive, about as close as a film could ever take you to classical Alexandria.  The fanaticism of emergent Christianity is I believe faithful enough though this film is not an attack on religion per se.  Indeed, it always tries to create a precedent to indicate why the Christians became hostile, precedents not always contained in history though the hostility was clear.  Overall, the film does a good job.

The greatest tragedy of this film is that despite covering its costs it has had a poor audience in the USA and the UK.  As far as I'm aware the film was only largely shown in London in two cinemas and rather tentatively at that.  I get the impression there is a conspiracy to suppress this film that mirrors the conspiracy to suppress Hypatia.  Far more deserves to be shown of Alexandria as a centre of learning and humanity at its finest.  Egypt was far more glorious then than it even aspires to today.  However the glories of Alexandria continue to emerge from the sea.  Above all the Egyptians could learn from this film, though the bulk of them will probably remain unconvinced.

The flavor and power of this film is sufficiently strong and convincing for it to be considered very significant.  At least as significant as the old Cleopatra film (with Elizabeth Taylor) that happened to be a cinematic flop.  I just hope this film helps to keep the lamps and the light alive for civilisation to continue without getting bogged down in dogma.",1275436800,336,7496,4.925099601593626
4107925,5,B003CI2G6S,"I give this movie 5 stars because I love ancient history, love stories of women who were amazing enough to get into the historic record and I could watch Rachel Weisz read the phone book.",1520812800,,187,4.371428571428571
4107926,5,B003CI2G6S,"Finally, a movie has been made that shows the loss of freedom of inquiry and of religious belief that took place in the late 4th Century early 5th Century C.E. (Common Era) as Christian fundamentalists took political power. We see how these fanatics ruthlessly attacked pagans, Jews, and secular philosophers who didn't follow the ""true religion."" The movie focuses well on the historical events that occurred in Alexandria, Egypt, at that time with brief mentions of what's going on in the rest of the Roman world, such as the edicts from the emperor. Rachel Weisz is brilliant as Hypatia.

The movie is also a great reminder of what happens when religious fundamentalists have their way. No freedom of religious belief or inquiry existed for hundreds of years in Europe while Christian clerics were in control. But we need only look at events today in Saudi Arabia and anywhere else in the Islamic world where Sharia law has been imposed to see the barbarism that unfolds. In areas of Afghanistan where the Taliban are in control today (2010), women are beaten or even executed for being outside alone or for getting an education. When the Taliban ruled the country in the 1990s, they also suppressed the teaching of math and science, and tried to wipe out the country's history through the destruction of records, films, and monuments. In Saudi Arabia, rape victims are whipped.

I'm sure there are some Christians who are uncomfortable with this movie's reminder about Christianity's early history. Fundamentalist leaders like Pat Robertson and Franklin Graham denounce the spread of Islam through conquest in the 7th and 8th centuries. Yet they turn a blind eye to the tyranny and loss of freedom that occurred when Christians gained political power in the late Roman era.

Agora is quite a change from the old movies from the 1950s that had a religious overtone. Several of them, such as The Robe, Quo Vadis, and Samson and Delilah, depicted all pagans or anybody who isn't a Jew or Christian as morally depraved and decadent. Christians were always portrayed as good and pure. The focus was only on biblical-related stories that ignored the world outside the Bible. As far as they were concerned, nothing good came from pagan Egypt, Greece or Rome. Fortunately, movies of that nature aren't being made much anymore or are bombs at the box office.

It's a shame that Agora didn't get much advertisement in the United States. In the Washington, DC area, it was shown at only two theaters. I only found out about it from an email list I'm on.",1518566400,,2546,4.8729792147806

4107928,4,B003CI2G6S,"Overall, I found this to be an interesting movie although I wish they had concentrated on the highlights of Hypatia's real life story.  Hypatia was born sometime between 350370 and died in 415.  The Library of Alexandra burned before Hypatia was even born, so I wish this had been excluded from the film.  Hypatia was a Hellenistic Neoplatonist philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician.  Hypatia had many achievements in life and continued to influence others after her death.  These achievements and influences include:
She was the head of the Neoplatonic school at Alexandria.
She was a teacher of both Philosophy and Astronomy.
She was one of the first notable female mathematicians known.
She was considered a wise counselor and advisor to many including Orestes, the Roman prefect of Alexandria.
Unfortunately no direct writings from Hypatia survive.
She may have edited the surviving texts of Euclid's Elements and Ptolemy's Almagest.
She might have co-written some of the commentaries attributed to her father, Theon of Alexandria.
She is known to have written a 13 volume commentary on Diophantus's Arithmetica.
She is known to have written an 8 volume popularization of Apollonius of Perga's treatise on conic sections.
She constructed astrolabes and hydrometers, She however did not by any means invent them.
She taught various pagans and people of faith, including Synesius, bishop of Ptolemais.
She was murdered by a mob of Christian monks known as the parabalani under the leadership of a lector named Peter.
Her murder transformed her into a ""martyr for philosophy"".
After her death she inspired future Neo-Platonists such as Damascius to oppose Christianity.
She might be the basis for the legend of Saint Catherine of Alexandria in the Middle Ages.
Charles Kingsley's 1853 anti-Catholicism novel Hypatia, romanticized her.

4107950,5,B003CI2G6S,"AGORA is a type of movie that tells the story of Hypatia, thus it's not a huge action type movie. If someone is interested in comparative religions or this time period, then they probably would like watching AGORA. Making-up new ""gods"" was very common in that region for thousands of years from the ancient Mesopotamian/Sumerian ""gods"" such as Enki/Ea versus Enlil, to the Egyptians, and MANY others, so it was a surprise to see another made-up ""god"" Serapis mentioned because most people don't know about Serapis. The film takes place some years after the Roman Emperor Constantine I (who ""took out"" his wife Fausta and son Crispus), set-up the debate of the First Council of Nicaea in 325 AD where they debated then decided on the nature of their god, and used religion for military/political reasons. A scene while not getting into how there were many different ""gospels"" not included in the NT canon or explaining the contradictions in the ones that were (or the possible roles of the Greeks/Roman Empire in making/promoting the new religion such as 1 Peter 2:13-17 in original Koine Greek to submit to the Emperor as the supreme authority), does show how the text can be twisted and used for various agendas. The film takes place around when the Roman Emperor Theodosius I made Nicene Christianity the State church of the Roman Empire in 380 AD, thus opening the floodgates for the spread of Christianity from the region shown in AGORA then thoughout Europe and beyond for over the next 1500 years. The word Fornication is used once, but the original Koine Greek word would have been Porneia that was ""paid relations with a SLAVE"" or pederasty treating the boy as a SLAVE (the original word Porneia in the original context was not ""regular or upper class paid relations"" and it was NOT ""pre-marital relations"" because that was NOT even an issue back then), as evidenced by the Latin translation of Porneia to Fornicatio for ""Lower Class paid relations"" under an archway, then even the modern English word Fornication was ""Lower Class paid relations"" until the Puritans incorrectly changed the MEANING to ""pre-marital relations"" in the 1600's for their Theocracy. For over 1500 years there were popes/priests who had mistresses or married (plus had children including while unmarried). Augustine of Hippo who was around the years and region of AGORA had mistresses/""pre-marital relations"" for MANY years and had a son while not married before he became ""anti-relations."" The trend of what happened to Hypatia went on to Galileo and others, and after the Enlightenment modern science has proven who was correct. It sounded like the characters said the name Jesus, when in early AD the Hebrew name Yeshua would have been in Greek Iesous, and in Latin Iesu, as the letter ""J"" was not used in modern English until the 1600's AD. It was sad what was brought upon Hypatia, but it is also sad that similar things as shown in AGORA continue on in many ways to this day.",1483920000,5,2965,4.873267326732673

4107959,4,B003CI2G6S,"I rented it.  I didn't buy it, though I'm sure the actual physical product is great too (although I was a little dismayed to see there was no director's cut or collector's edition, as I really enjoyed this movie).  Here is my informal review of the film itself.

  There are not enough well-crafted tales being told about ancient Rome and the other civilizations of the Mediterranean.  What does exist, and I'm sorry to point the finger, are too many slash 'em up action films that are about as deep as a shallow puddle.  Whether most people realize it ever or not, these such civilizations are our ancestry for many of us and they formed the basis for Western Civilization as we know it.  Films like this, The Passion of the Christ, and Kingdom of Heaven to name a few, are not shy about showing us the ugly-but-important moments in our past.  That being said, I'll dive in...

  One of the things most impressive about 'Agora' is its glossy, polished feel.  This movie had a healthy-enough budget, you can tell, and that sort of financial backing goes far in making the ancient world being portrayed seem realistic to the audience.  I'd say as a whole it looks more believable to me than many moments of Ridley Scott's 'Gladiator,' for example.  While both movies use CGI (as is the norm nowadays), it doesn't take away from the authenticity in 'Agora.'  Its dusty streets and ancient buildings all have a look showing that great love was put into this project.  And it indeed shows, and we the audience appreciate it.  The set really never falters either, nor do the costumes.  Again, this is where a good budget matters.  You want your Roman soldiers to look like Roman soldiers if they are to be believable Roman soldiers.  The cinematography is great too.  Cinematographer Xavi Gimnez follows the chaos and action while managing to show the glimpses of beauty wherever they might hide.  Nothing special and not too much out of the box with the cinematography, but it works.  'Agora' is easy on the eyes, in every way it counts.

  As I've said, you can tell just by looking at 'Agora' that some money was put into this (approx. 70 million, a 2010 movie) despite not having a big-name cast.  Other than Weisz, the names here aren't exactly household names.  Yet these actors deliver great performances (particularly Oscar Isaac, playing the staunch nobleman).  Max Minghella is notable, playing Hypatia's loyal slave with a haunted face that hides much more.  Ashraf Barhom and Sami Samir add to the supporting cast as fiery preachers and men of God.  Its messages and beauty wouldn't have saved 'Agora' had its small cast been subpar.  Luckily that is not an issue here.  Aside from their talent, the smaller cast delivers in another way also:  it's much more believable that this story unfolds in the ancient world without George Clooney or Morgan Freeman stomping around.  'Agora' got lucky in a way few other such small-but-ambitious films do - its sleepy cast did well and did so authentically in a way a big, star-studded cast probably wouldn't have.

  The plot of 'Agora' is relatively simple, its scope big.  Most reviews will have touched on this, so I shan't waste much time.  We know Weisz plays Hypatia, a strong-minded woman with a heart for discovery.  The audience meets Hypatia as a mathematics/ philosophy teacher, instructing her students on mathematical concepts predating many of these we take for granted today (calculus what?).  Those that surround her (mostly her students and slaves) play as big a role in the story as Hypatia, with some of them turning into important politicians, theologians, and thugs over the course of the film.  These characters carry us through the turmoil of the times, their different careers and paths all ending up following the same road.  There isn't much romance, which is refreshing for a change.  Strong-minded Hypatia refuses to renounce her religious beliefs, a ruse that would serve as an attempt to pacify the fervorous Christian majority now ruling Alexandria.  This refusal and her dedication to science and philosophy has cruel consequences in the ancient, intolerant world in which 'Agora' takes place.  You probably know the rest;  if not, I won't tell you.

  The messages here, though, are the film's best qualities.  I believe this most of all is what makes 'Agora' an important film, not just another sleepy box-office would-be that gets put in the bargain bin.  Others have dissected some of its most obvious messages to quite an extent, and I'll let those explanations stand.  Instead I'll focus on something else, a message within the film's subtext that is possibly more important in our day and age.  'Agora' tells a tale about a civilization struggling to accept a major identity change (sound familiar?) and a changing world.  One side fights for its ancient beliefs, traditions, and long-standing way of life.  The other fights out of anger of centuries of persecution and not being listened to or accepted (sound familiar yet?).  Except for the fact that we all know the outcome of Western Rome and its hold on the Mediterranean, this films inserts us directly into frightening, uncertain times of great change and civil unrest.  The people here fight over religious identity and rights, we today over ethnic identity and rights (yet!?  yet!?).  'Agora' is not shy about showing the terror and bloodshed often accompanying times of such change, anger, and bitterness, and I feel the audience should be grateful for that.  We today could stand to know more about this important, long-forgotten time in our history and behold its parallels to our world today.  I am proud that a director would make a movie like 'Agora,' and I feel it was an important movie to make.

  My complaints here are few.  The ending (no spoilers) was a little too abrupt and anticlimactic for my taste, considering the magnitude of the events unfolding all around these characters.  The acting was amazing as I've said, and I'm a little disappointed 'Agora' wasn't long enough (or written accordingly) to give many of the members of its cast enough time to shine.  As others have said, the structure is a bit loose and the film sometime seems as if it doesn't know which way it's headed.  Too many characters and not enough time to do with them.  Beautiful Weisz is great as always, but playing the 'strong-minded' woman she feels like a supporting character in her own movie at times.  Also, a bit of a Hollywood cliche.  The characters struggling and willing to fight over their identity, faith, and ones they love are those that stand out most in this film.  Weisz's Hypatia is meaningful, just not as much in comparison to the others.  That being said, I simply don't hand out five star reviews to every film I like, even one as great as this.  There cannot be too many 'Citizen Kane's or 'Apocalypse Now's.  We must keep the bar high and hope aspiring directors rise to meet the challenge.

  I highly recommend 'Agora,' despite its lack of commercial success.  That doesn't make it a dud.  It's a moving film that needs to be seen.  This director deserves credit for making such a beautiful, original film in a genre rife with copycats.  If you aren't gonna buy it, please rent it.  Be you a Weisz fan, or heck even a math lover...  but especially if you're a history-nut because as I've said, there are not enough other films regarding this period that are made this well.  Most importantly, though, you should see it if you are someone concerned and moved by the events unfolding in Western Civilization today.  You will see such times of change and civil unrest are ugly but necessary, and that in the end it will play itself out.  The Romans and their constituents - ancestors to nearly all of us - went through it as 'Agora' shows us, and we shall too.",1480982400,2,7823,4.788922155688622

Scary to think, but today's anti-intellectual movement combined with the fear mongering we see in the press and from extreme political points of view, paralell this film to a frightening degree. Sadly, the people for whom this would be the most valuable would probably not watch it, and even if they did, they would be completely unable to recognize themselves in it. If you appreciate intellectual stories, you should find this interesting and worth the time.

Because it is about a historical event that does not end well, the movie does not have a happy ending, but it is the only movie I've ever seen that accurately depicts how the Christians rose to power. It also shows the freedoms and respect that women lost. It is a timely movie. No documents from this teacher/philosopher are said to survive, and there were conflicting theories about how the planets behaved, but they understood gravity well, and educated people knew that no one was falling off the side of the earth. We have archaeological evidence to show that these ""pagan"" people had a knowledge base far exceeding what is shown in this movie. It was the only major disappointment in the film.

This movie has great imagery, and scenes that will cause you to think, but I didn't feel connected to the characters, nor a sense of depth, and I was left questioning the motivation for Davus.

The biography of Hypatia, as little that is known about her, can be read in a half hour. I suggest skipping the movie and going to Wiki, Britannica and other sources.
The other part of the movie is clearly about the violence of Pagans, Christians and Jews. Any even half well-educated individual already knows that all humans are capable of such regardless of what religion they claim to support.

And, as per usual, they assume the audience cannot identify with natives playing the roles, and have to have everything filtered through a white, British gaze, for that psuedo-historical icing on the cake. They should have just made a movie and not tried to laughingly tie it to people and time periods and places that really existed. The film industry should just keep its grubby hands off of history.

This was a very fascinating movie and made me think, how much knowledge has been lost because of religious zealots have destroyed and even killed teachers, scientist, and what they label as witches all in the name of their God, or because of fear of what they don't understand or believe.

Made me think, how much of this is going on today! Those that don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Just saying...

Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie and it did spark some interest in me going to check out and research some of the characters in the movie, such as Hypatia.

I really enjoy movie that make me think.

It shows a place where a woman can be considered the most brilliant scientific philosopher of her time in the midst of the cruel religious wars of early Christianity.

4108136,4,B003CI2G6S,I have watched this movie twice.  Certainly not  the populist view of things and not really sure this happened historically the way it was presented.  Certainly Christianity in that day and age was just rising and after the Romans edict to make it the state religion I am sure there many ways these events could have happened.  Violence against Pagans and Jews is not unheard of by Christians and the destruction of the Library at Alexandria is one of the most tragic things to have ever happened.  That is an inescapable fact and the position of the Roman commanders portrayed in this film has got to be pretty accurate.  The sadness of the loss so much human knowledge is very poignant against the stubbornness of the Christian dogma that would haunt the Mediterranean and Europe for the next century and half.  Very well directed and acted.  Something that should be watched and thought about.,1464998400,,896,4.7727272727272725

A lot of my Christian friends didn't like the way the movie portrayed the Christians but I have to disagree, I think the writers got it right! it's so easy to see the faults of others but extremely difficult for most people to be able to take an honest look at themselves & admit when they are wrong. The first Christians were Jewish, one of the things that Jesus did before He went to the cross was to teach & point out to His Jewish brothers that their religious ways would lead them astray, He was showing them by example how we as followers ought to conduct ourselves. The Apostles got it right & the ones who kept to the Apostles teaching stayed in the truth of Christianity & was killed by the Holy Roman Church for it but most Christians over the centuries stayed away from the pure truth of the gospel & were led away by religious zealots who were no different from the Pharisees that Jesus rebuked.

I don't know why I'm bothering to write this review as I've never reviewed a movie before but I'm hoping everyone will steer clear of this movie for it's sheer absurdity... It says she's fighting to protect the ancient wisdom which is predicated on her pointless pondering  about space and the earth being a globe... What? So she's fighting to protect ancient wisdom by postulating new theories about the cosmos...? That seems likes she's fighting against ancient wisdom to me... Not to mention the clearly anti-Christian message embedded here... They clearly are trying to make the viewer think Christians are a bunch of Taliban wannabes demonstrated by one guy shouting I'm a Christian right before he starts beating a guy to death... as if Christianity has anything in common with barbarous acts of violence. Just stupid and obvious propaganda here to reinforce a false perception of believers and try to make science look like some infallible authority on reality...

My Christian husband was muttering and complaining about the stupid, evil Christians as the movie went on.  As a woman who has left patriarchal monotheism, the ending was no surprise.

Christians did not destroy the Library of Alexandria, Hypatia did not discover heliocentricity, nor did she make any significant contributions to her area of expertise. The film portrays Christians as if they were members of ISIS, destroying any local culture as they seize a new city.

Hypatia was murdered because she had chosen sides in Alexandrian politics. She supported the upper class Christians around the Prefect Orestes as opposed to the proletarian Christian masses represented by Patriarch Cyril. Her murder did not not have anything to do with Hypatia's interest in astrology or numerology or even her neo-Platonic mysticism, or because she was a woman who ""did not understand her role in life"", but of course this is the narrative that suits the director's bias and was therefore used for this film.",1463875200,5,968,5.1265822784810124

Now I have added her to the top of my list of ""People I would love to meet"". The move was very well made, but moreover, it opened my mind to an infinite list of questions. There has been so much death in the name of God over the ages. I love history and this depicts a time during the Byzantine Empire and the struggles they had with having too many hypocritical religious zealots in charge. To be a woman at this time and as intelligent as Hypatia was, it must have been such a trying time and this movie shows that.  I hope someone else finds this as amazing as I did.",1462665600,,670,3.962962962962963

The first major movie on my  heroine Hypatia, and what a bunch of nonesense:

Hypatia was a scientist. Those that wrote no next to nothing about science. Almost every lecture and experiment portrayed are full of errors. ALL EXPLANATIONS USE MISCONCEPTION AND ANACHRONISM INSTEAD OF TRUTHS. A 700 model of the solar system is ""invented"" by Davus to aplause - but is used wrongly. Her ""elliptical orbit"" model is supposedly based on the ""FACT"" that the earth is closer to the sun in the summer and appears bigger - complete nonsense since at that time it is winter in New Zealand of course.

Again this was a city that was conquered by Alexander, who was on the scale of the Romans, the Persians, the Ottoman empire all the way to Hitler as homicidal manics, whose quest for power, transformed into taking land by force resulting in millions dead.

I won't go into the numerous poor historical aspects of ""Agora"", except to say warn that this movie should not be utilized to learn about the events surrounding the life and death of Hyapatia. I wished they had shown St. Cyril to be more involved with the plan to take over Alexandria, which he is credited with doing just before the closing credits.

If you're looking for an anti-Christian, anti-historical, agenda-ridden rant... this is your movie.
Complete BS. A modern-day science-fiction dream, presenting Christianity as the enemy of critical thought (granted, there are idiots in every sector, the church is not completely safe from stupidity).
The portrayal of Christians are basically a satanic cult carrying out everything Jesus taught against. Stoning, flaying, waging war, forcing conversions, denying forgiveness... the Jews were presented as modern-day politicians instead of steadfast believers.
Moving target Not sure who the hero was supposed to be, the only likable character was Hypatia the main character who is 13 centuries ahead of her time in celestial theory.

4108484,5,B003CI2G6S,"This movie has such contemporary resonance. The story of dogmatic religion in the pursuit of absolute power over men and in search of total subjugation over women, the killing of the spirit of inquiry and rationality in the name of belief, all this is continuing to this day--in ISIS, the Taliban, and in fundamentalists of all stripes.

Native cultures, sciences, arts, languages, learning are still being plundered and destroyed today. As it was in Alexandria 1900 years ago, so it is today in Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and India today.

At a more subtle level, evangelism and colonialism continues to attack India's ancient ""pagan"" culture and Sanskrit learning 60 years after the British left India, in the form of the Pollocks, Witzels, and Wendy Donigers of the world, with their orientalist prejudices, misappropriations, misreadings, and self-serving perspectives. The confused communists of India, with their belief in violent methods and media control, are in cahoots with their orientalist western brothers to destroy what's left of ancient India's culture.

This movie made me cry for alternative perspectives, ""other""ed traditions, native histories--especially Indic ones, which have been brutally suppressed for over a 1000 years. It is an old civilization, contemporaneous to Alexandria shown in this movie, the last ""pagan"" culture left standing, today struggling to survive, fighting to be whole and well again.",1458432000,3,1439,5.502262443438914

4108491,4,B003CI2G6S,"The screenplay brings together several diverse strands deftly - the philosophy of Plato and Plotinus, the mathematics of conic sections, the question of the center of the universe (whether the sun revolved around the earth or the planets around the sun), and the issue of the authority and power of the state religion (Christianity). As the central figure Hypatia was in the middle of all these strands. Rachel Weisz did an excellent job. Some time ago I read some radical feminist who claimed that Hypatia was the victim of discrimination against women. The movie prompted me to read more about her and her times. My recent reading and the movie demonstrate that she was not victimized by sexism but by religious orthodoxy. I used to be a Roman Catholic, but am now an apostate. I still have enormous affection for the teachings of Jesus, but now hold that the worst thing that ever happened to Christianity was when Constantine made Christianity the state religion for the Roman Empire. Within years, the Christians changed from being persecuted believers in universal love and tolerance to being persecutors who were intolerant of all religions but their own. As Lord Acton has said, ""Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."" How true! The abuse and manner of death of Hypatia is the reverse of the abuse and manner of death of the early apostles - and the reversal is not a step forward, it is merely turning the tables.",1458345600,23,1448,4.866396761133603

She was another genius whose work was so far ahead of it's time that the rabble couldn't catch up. The movie also clearly exposed the futility of wars fought over differences of opinion so polarized that people refused to debate and chose to go to war instead.  What did they achieve?  They burned down the library of Alexandria and cast out important advances in science that could have benefited them all.  The same scenario is playing out worldwide today, so as a world, we haven't learned much at all over the last few thousand years.

4108517,4,B003CI2G6S,"Historical accuracy aside, the underlying truth of our shared human history is represented here correctly enough.

The reminder here, for me, was a lament for all that could have been without the destructive fervor of religion.  I am not referring to faith, which is an internal relationship with God; I mean the outward demonstration of faith, which is both unnecessary and disparaging.  While it is certainly true that there has always been oppression and subversion, it reaches a whole new plateau when such is imposed by those who feel they speak with self-proclaimed divinity.

So many aspects of our human history are irrevocably lost; intellectual development, shared compassion and understanding, a sense that we are no different from one another.  All that was gained was a deep-rooted, illogical hatred for any with a belief that is perceived to be different than our own.

The acting was quite good, and the sets were very realistic. However, what was disturbing to me is that, while some of the dialogue of the Christians seemed to be correct and in agreement with Scripture, the movie portrayed the Christians as murderers and completely disobedient to lawful rule. In one scene of the movie, they trapped some Jewish Rabbis and citizens in a confined area and threw stones down upon them to kill them because they did not believe in Jesus and would not be converted, claiming they were the ones that crucified Jesus, the Savior. That, my friends, is what we all have done, each and every one of us, with our sins, but Jesus removes that sin from us so we can be saved. Also, at the end of the movie, the ""Christians"" condemn the star of the movie, the Philosopher, played by Rachael Weitz, as a witch and stone her because she would not convert.

4108570,4,B003CI2G6S,"This was a good movie and the acting and setting well portrayed the overall sense of conflict that occurred at a time of great change that was motivated by religious fervor and political expediency which relates to our world today.  I liked how the  story focused on that change and the  philosopher/mathematician Hypatia and her wrestling with her own change. It also highlighted the destruction of the library of Alexandria though some may say what was left of it.

There has been years of debate about the library's destruction, how and when it occurred and by whom. A movie like this will not give the definitive answer, But it prompted my inquiry and that was enough for the four stars. There were inaccurate depictions, par for the course for Hollywood. But for me the point of the movie was that atrocities are committed in the past and nowadays by religious and political zealots, mostly against innocents, and particularly against women and children. There are apologists who somehow minimize these facts in their retelling of this history. But for me the movie shined a small, although imperfect, spotlight on the tragedy of absolutes and rigid thinking. Also, Rachel Weisz was superb in her portrayal of Hypatia.  Well worth the viewing if only to see her.",1457913600,7,1267,4.901869158878505

Much of the story is undoubtedly done with artistic license since none of her works survive and attribution to her of a theory of gravity is a stretch.  But it is beautifully rendered and Rachel Weisz comes across as classical, smart and credible.  I'm not clear on why the title of Agora was chosen because there was little background given on the Hellenic nature of the culture and her Neoplatonist teaching did not take place in the open market.  But given how little philosophical fodder we get from Hollywood this was pretty good stuff.  Some current Catholic scholars are critical of the hostile portrayal of early Christians but among the questions surrounding Hupatia's life there is little doubt that she was murdered for her pagan/philosophical beliefs and the sway she held on the political rulers of Alexandria at the time.",1457308800,,1024,5.144578313253012

Fantastic, beautiful film with many insights into human nature and history (his-story) and ""herstory"" (her-story): ""belief"" perverted from scriptures of ""love, tolerance, mercy"" into ""edicts"" of ""hate, power, condemn,"" whether we're talking religions, classes or genders. I saw this movie for free through Amazon Prime; not only would I rent it for a few bucks, but this is a film I'd spend $20-25 to own, so I can watch it with others and have great conversations afterwards.",1457049600,,764,5.112
4108719,1,B003CI2G6S,"The creator of this film would like you to believe it is historical.  Sadly, it is neither hysterical nor historical.

The film is pretty, and catches the eye.  That's about all I can say for it.  What are some of the many problems?

1) Fake historical quotes.  The film starts off with one from Hypatia that she never said.
2) Supposedly, Alexandria was in its death throes as the Roman Empire fell.  The Western Roman Empire would fall, but the Eastern Roman Empire, including Alexandria, would not fall for over 1000 years after Hypatia's death.
3) Apparently, Christian leaders hated science, learning, and philosophy.  Except this is exactly wrong.  Augustine, one of the most prominent of Christianity's theologians, wrote not long after the fictitious events in this film.  His writing is full of philosophy and history, and it is clear he was by no means unique in his high regard for philosophy and history.  If it were not for Muslims in Andalusia, Jewish people like Maimonides, and Christian Monks actively seeking to preserve knowledge, writings, and philosophy, the renaissance wouldn't have had much source material to go on, and the knowledge and learning of the Ancient Greeks would have been nothing more than a distant memory.
4) Hypatia did not discover heliocentrism as seems to be asserted.
5) She was not killed because of her faith (and wasn't an Atheist).
6) Christians did not destroy the Library of Alexandria.  It had been gone for almost 400 years earlier than the events in this film depicted.  Oops.",1457049600,7,1530,4.9296875

This film did a fantastic job of showing the conflicts between the political, religious, and scientific communities. Great actors, beautifully shot.

Viewers need to recognize that this is the secular humanist's version of ""the Passion"" except that it defends its faith by making theists of any form appear to be the source of all hate, brutality and ignorance in the world.

4108865,3,B003CI2G6S,"As much as the story of Agora is a fascinating, important story and the this is reasonably well executed film, is not a great film. Agora is a film about the inherent human desire for purpose, our common need to search for reason in the universe, and our natural tendency towards chaos. This is an ambitious scope to cover, and ultimately this movie falls a bit short.

Perspective is key to Agora, and also a key aspect where the movie fails. The camera often finds its way to a representative viewpoint - during scenes of rioting the camera swings high above the mob until each individual actor is just part of a swirling pattern of chaos, during moments of faith, be it in science or religion, the camera is close to the characters, at a very human level. Unfortunately there is not enough thought paid to transitions between the perspectives of this film. As a result cuts are often discombobulating, and while occasionally this may have been done intentionally, the majority of the time it does a disservice to the storytelling and pulls the viewer out.

This is a case of too much style, not enough substance. While the locations are beautifully executed (it's some of the best CG I've seen in years) and the acting is rather good, the story of Agora is swallowed up in what becomes a gimmick of perspective. There is also a fair amount of melodrama in this movie, although a degree of that can be ascribed to most actors, writers and directors being unfamiliar with the classical world and more familiar with, well, love stories. The Greco-Romans of this film are decidedly those of romantic, Victorian revisionism, not the living, breathing type that has only recently found a voice in modern translations of classical works. This can all seem a bit ridiculous, and I can't help feeling that what this movie needed was a dose of what made ""Rome"" great - that is a nice layer of period-appropriate grit and grime.

All in all, this is a film worth watching, but it will lose some viewers in its romanticism and in its spatially experimental editing style.",1455840000,,2062,4.69060773480663

4108891,5,B003CI2G6S,"As the tagline says, this is an amazing movie.  First, on the superficial level, it's quite an elaborate spectacle at times, which I found surprising since I had never heard of it before.  Perhaps CG kept the costs down so that it wasn't a major a production as it appears; I'm not quite sure about that.

What makes the movie great, though, is its portrayal of Hypatia (played by Rachel Weisz), the principal character.  As you may know, Hypatia was a famous philosopher and scientist associated with the library of Alexandria.  Her continuing fame is somewhat unfounded, since apparently not a single work of hers survives, and her memory is kept alive primarily by the circumstances of her death.  Perhaps she was great, perhaps not; perhaps she was amazingly smart, perhaps not; perhaps she was very beautiful, perhaps not; there's no way for anybody to know any longer.

Of course, Rachel Weisz herself is extraordinarily beautiful, but any physical beauty Hypatia may or may not have had plays essentially no role in the story, other than the fact that a couple of other characters are incidentally smitten with her.  And Hypatia's character in the movie displays no interest whatever in physicality or matters of love.  She has friends, but her friendships are literally Platonic, depending almost entirely on the intellectual interactions she has with those people.  In other words, to a large extent she is interested in the people only to the degree that they say interesting things about the problems she is interested in.  She is seemingly interested in nature, and science, and philosophy, and nothing else except in rare moments of tragedy.  She has little interest, for example, in taking the actions or making the behavioral changes in herself that she needs to make in order to save herself when her world is crumbling around her.  To the very end, she is worrying about the shapes of the planetary orbits, rather than the fact that those in control of the city are (literally) trying to get their hands on her to kill her.  This may be partly due to the fact that she has lived a somewhat privileged life and probably can't really comprehend that she is now reviled and hated rather than loved and respected, in addition to the fact that trying to kill people for merely seeking the truth seems surreal except to the people who are doing it.

And my description, I'm afraid, doesn't really do justice to the oddity of this portrayal, nor to the way it rings completely true, nor to the fact that Hypatia ends up being so appealing.  In a way, what Agora reminds me of Barefoot in Athens, in which Socrates is in a similar situation to Hypatia's in Agora ... a philosopher of whose merits we are today uncertain, seeking only the truth, hounded by the powers that be, unwilling to compromise his integrity, and ending up dead as a result, ensuring his everlasting fame in a way that his actual work (if we had direct access to it) might not.  One difference is that there's no humor whatever in Agora.  Unfortunately, I know that comparison is of little use, since very few people these days are familiar with the marvelous Hallmark Hall of Fame production of Barefoot in Athens from the 1960's (starting Peter Ustinov, Geraldine Page, and many other great actors), and it's not available anywhere, as far as I know, although the play by Maxwell Anderson is still available in print and is quite good.  If only someone would release Barefoot in Athens on DVD!  Another pleasing moving along these lines that I'd recommend is Tenchi: The Samurai Astronomer, though thankfully somewhat less dismal in income.  But I digress.

In summary, I highly recommend Agora to anyone who might have any interest in a bio-pic about an ancient philosopher, which I'm aware may be a select demographic.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1455580800,2,3842,4.814307458143075

4108949,4,B003CI2G6S,"""Agora"" (2009) is directed by Alejandro Amenabar (Open Your Eyes). The film is about Hypatia (Rachel Weisz) a Roman mathematician, astronomer, philosopher from the late 4th century who was open to challenging ideas of her time. She was a historical figure who lived from 350(370)-415 AD and was the head of the Neoplatonic school in Alexandria, Egypt. She lived in a time of religious, and social unrest and sought to save the knowledge of antiquity from destruction. The film has a large scope as it probes the lives of the people of that time in a way that seems timeless and relevant for us today. Hypathia is seen in the movie as someone who was passionate about humanity and ideas, and sought the inclusion of all people despite their differences of ideology. The film reveals her strength of character and dignity as she made it her life's goal to search out the truth. This is a magnificent film that attests to the value of living a life with honour and integrity. It's intriguing the way the director revealed the scope of the ideas in the film with aerial shots of the earth backdropped by deep space. We are constantly reminded in the film about how small and fragile people's lives are living on this globe in the middle of space. It's a film that challenges one to not lose sight of a bigger picture even though we perhaps tend to do the opposite.",1439596800,,1360,4.600823045267489

Most Christians in this film are given personalities reminiscent of the modern day Islamic State. This may be unfair but is consistent with the facts of the case. On the other hand, the historical record is thin, so the filmmakers had leeway to make Hypatia and her entourage of friends and enemies more interesting.

4108955,5,B003CI2G6S,"Truly, how wonderful that nowadays create such authentic, vibrant films that are meant to praise science and to denounce the bigotry of the religion itself. In my opinion, Hypatia in this film is a symbol of those who suffered for the truth. The dramatic events shown in this film, taking place in Alexandria in 391 A. D. But first, we have the opportunity to learn about life of the famed astronomer women named Hypatia. As a true scientist, she doubted in many ways, including she doubted the authenticity of the system of Ptolemy. And though about her life and the discoveries we, unfortunately, were knows very little, I believe that Hypatia was the greatest scientist. But she lived in a terrible bloody era, when came to power Christian fanatics. These bigots, seeking revenge for his past humiliation, decided to destroy the library and kill people under the guise of the name of their God. Hypatia became a victim of these obscurantist, and she is experiencing betrayal by people close to her. But after a Millennium, her name is known to us as the symbol the of steadfastness women, and as the symbol of a true scientist. This is an outstanding drama movie!",1434672000,2,1166,4.7772277227722775
4108956,5,B003CI2G6S,"The death of the Classical World and its replacement by the Judeo-Christian one was rife with excess and destruction.  Hypatia has the misfortune of being a sort of focus or symbol of this transformation.  The destruction of the Serapaeum (think that's what it was called) and the Great Library of Alexandria within is an event that, hopefully, would never be celebrated by any man of thought or conscience.

Kyril, the corrupt (arch?)-bishop of Alexandria, is jealous of Hypatia because she retains influence with the aristocracy, both Christian and non... and is popular and beloved.  She refuses marriage, preferring her studies.  She was one of those ""driven"" people who are pulled forward by a more lofty goal or calling than mere human existence - her science.  Kyril, hungry for power and envious of those loved for their own sake, hates her; not only because she isn't a believer, but because she is pure of heart.  One is reminded of the scene in ""Dr. Zhivago"" where the corrupt lawyer, Komarovsky, takes Laura to task for loving Pasha:  ""He's high minded, pure; the kind of man the world pretends to look up to and in fact despises!""

I think Mr. Pasternak hit the nail on the head, when it comes to Hypatia and Kyril; even though he wasn't writing about them, of course.

Naturally, Kyril wins; Hypatia is eventually deemed to be a witch; her popularity isn't because she has a noble soul; it's because she has bewitched people.  Think I've encountered that frame of mind in numerous other locations in the Time continuum...

Anyway, She's murdered of course; in a church no less, (some of) the extant records say.  The movie takes a ""merciful liberty"" and lets a servant who loves her smother her before she can be stoned.  In fact, the historical records say her skin was peeled off while she was yet alive.

Before that, though; and even though no one (who is not a believer) can doubt that their world is coming to a dreadful end, she sticks to her studies and follows her Muse.  The movie concludes with the statement that she anticipated Copernicus by 1500 years.

This is an incredible, if dark and foreboding picture.  Hypatia shines throughout as an ""eye"" of self-directed inspiration amidst the collapse of her world and all she valued and treasured.  There is an interesting psychological aspect to this movie too.  Everyone else in the picture seems to be either reactive in nature or purely base in motivation and instinct (a couple exceptions but don't want to write a book!)  Only she seems to be guided and motivated by an inspiration to reach for The Infinite... call it God or whatever you want to.  In this, she resembles the famous Pharos Lighthouse, which is portrayed in the film, and which lasted until the 1400's or so I believe, when it was destroyed by an earthquake.

Of note; the Great Library of Alexandria suffered serious damage when Julius Caesar invaded Egypt about 50 BC; though it was unintentional.  Kyril and his hordes destroyed almost everything left, as portrayed in the film.  A paltry remainder was maintained by the Copts until Egypt was conquered by the Muslims about 650 AD, and they made sure that every remaining scrap was reduced to carbon.

Thus perished almost all the knowledge of the Ancient World.

That's what this movie is really about, and I can not rate it highly enough.  Ms. Weisz was wonderful and believable in her performance; as alluded to earlier, the only ""3-D living individual with a mind and heart"" in the entire film.",1434412800,2,3497,4.783333333333333
4108957,4,B003CI2G6S,"I've been a fan of the Greek philosopher Hypatia -- the heroine of the movie -- for years. ""Agora,"" a biopic about her life, is a good movie, but it has major strengths and some serious problems.

Background:  Hypatia was a Greek woman who lived in Alexandria, Egypt, the capital of Egypt during the Roman Empire. Because of prejudice against women, there were few female philosophers and other teachers in that era. Hypatia, a pagan, was killed by a Christian mob in 415 A.D., during a period of civil conflict between the Christians, Jews and pagans in Alexandria.

In the modern era, Hypatia has been adopted as a hero of feminism, women's right to become scholars, freedom of religion, freedom of scientific inquiry, etc.

The movie's strengths:

The movie itself is visually very striking, with camera angles that put the watcher right in the center of the action, seeing riots, murders, science classes and shopping at eye level with the actors.

The movie has many dramatic moments -- riots in which Christians, Jews and pagans try to kill or injure each other, plays and dances performed in a small arena, an attack on the Temple of Serapis which may have destroyed the last remnants of the ancient Library of Alexandria, angry quarrels in Roman government council chambers, love scenes, Hypatia performing scientific experiments, and so on.

The movie tries to stick to the historical facts, including the fact that Hypatia was a close friend of the Roman governor of the city, may have been killed at the command of the city's Archbishop, St. Cyril of Alexandria, and was a likeable and brilliant woman.

The movie's weaknesses:

In a fiction apparently created for the modern viewer, Hypatia is shown as being courted both by Orestes, the governor of the city, and by a fictional slave, Davus. When she's not fending off both men -- she is depicted as completely devoted to science and philosophy and uninterested in marriage -- she's sitting on the roof of her house, watching the stars, trying to determine if the earth revolves around the sun and, if so, what orbit it follows.

I have a science background and could follow what Hypatia's research was attempting to prove, but the average watcher will likely find those parts of the movie very dull, as the science is not adequately explained.

I had trouble sometimes following the dialogue between various characters -- either they were mumbling, or the sound quality of the movie is a bit sketchy in parts.

The movie has a rather simplistic viewpoint -- religion (pagan, Christian and Jewish): bad -- science and philosophy: good. This viewpoint ignores the fact that we owe a lot of our knowledge of Hypatia to a friendly Christian bishop who corresponded with her about science.

The movie covers events that occurred throughout Hypatia's lifetime, but no one -- including Hypatia  and her two love interests -- ever seems to age. Everyone is young for a period that would have lasted decades. Hypatia should have been middle-aged or even elderly near the end of the movie, but is shown as still young and beautiful.

I enjoyed the movie -- riots, killings and religious confrontations are thrown in whenever the science and philosophy become too technical or too dull -- but its depiction of Hypatia is basically that of a beautiful, saintly scientist who seems somehow transported from the 21st century back into an environment full of religious crazies. The reality was a bit more complicated.

The movie will definitely appeal to fans of Roman Empire history, students of Latin and Greek culture, feminists, philosophers, scientists, and pagans, Christians and Jews who are interested in the history of all three faiths during the Roman Empire.",1434240000,,3718,4.943820224719101

They do so and think they're living in peace and harmony. Then, Vol commands them to kill the Enterprise crew because they might enlighten them.  This is perfect for what religions are generaly, and this show gives a dramatization of a certain historical event of these types of things.- something that led to the dark ages after the fall of the Roman empire.

This movie unfortunately in my opinion mixes up the whole Galileo and Kepler discovery of the Solar system.  Hypatia knew much Diophantine analyses.  It would have been better to show these great number theory things instead. Also, they don't show how grewsome was the murder of Hypatia - a skinning by abalone shells and then dismemberment of joints, and finally burning of the pieces in a fire.",1429315200,,1201,4.852941176470588

It was the foreshadowing template of what was to come for the rest of the world as the new redeemer/savior cult swept, first the Middle East, and then the rest of the western world with one act of brutality after another, in the name of their Savior, ""The Prince of Peace.""

I just felt that the manner in which this one act, against a strong and learned woman, could have been treated with more depth about who Hypatia actually was and the level of the violence that was perpetrated against her.

Every movie Ive ever seen her in has not really credited or addressed her abilities as an actress.

The production of Agora is fantastic, someone spent a great deal of money producing this movie, but the rhythm of the movie Agora somehow misses its mark.  I really think the movie would have made a better television series, in that the movie itself Agora misses so much in history concerning this era in the manifestation of the early Christian History that is very interesting, that the director of Agora attempted to condense in a simple film.  The actors in Agora where wonderful, in particular Rachel Weis, but the film needed a greater financial budget, that would have been worth investing in as a television series, since Christian Rome in its Early history is extremely interesting  this particular history in Christianity during the Byzantine Empire: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire",1417996800,,1292,4.872146118721461

4109011,4,B003CI2G6S,"Last night I went to see the movie Agora at the Kendall Square cinema in Cambridge. The film starred Rachel Weisz who happens to be quite possibly my favorite leading lady. While she may not be the most drop dead gorgeous of the Hollywood stars there is something about her looks, acting ability, and big brown eyes that do it for me. That said, she was not dressed up as a sex symbol in this film so if you are looking for eye candy then you should go see the film for the scenery of Alexandria circa 390AD instead. This film was written and directed by Alejandro Amenabar and produced in Spain. The initial strangeness of the Romans and Egyptians having British accents eventually goes away and you settle into the movie. First, a brief somewhat spoiler free description of the film...

Set in Roman occupied Egypt in the city of Alexandria the primary character is the teacher/philosopher/librarian at the famous Library of Alexandria. Not to be taken lightly this character (Hypatia) is a strong woman that believes in science and not in religion. Religion plays the other central role in the film. Clearly this was a chaotic time in the history of western civilization in that the pagan gods (Roman gods), Christian beliefs, and Judaism are all in a sort of tug of war with the populace as well as the politics. Christianity is clearly spreading and with its acceptance it is getting more and more powerful, repressive, and less accepting of other religions. Hypatia is interested more in solving why the stars and planets (the wanderers as she calls them) move through the heavens the way the do than she is in love. That doesn't stop her from having her admirers which include one of her students Orestes who would grow up to be the Roman prefect in the second half of the film and her loyal slave Davus who would later join the militant Christian movement. The fall of the Roman Empire can be felt in the movie although it is never really explicitly referred to. However the seeming lack of troops to keep the religious violence under control and the fact that the prefect agrees to certain things to keep the peace that he may not have otherwise are good indicators that in far away Egypt you do what you have to for the ""good"" of the Empire because Rome is too far away to help and it has its own problems.

The central theme of the film is quite obviously science vs. faith. None of the religions are painted favorably in the film, particularly the Christians who are clearly the strongest force and the most brutal. The destruction of the Library (this can't be considered a spoiler if you have ever picked up a history book) and loss of all its knowledge is just painful to watch for someone like me who works in the science field. There are plenty of battle scenes with a few gore filled shots but overall the director was restrained in his depiction of what the violence almost certainly was like. Science vs. religion comes up time and time again finally making its final impression as you watch the last 10 minutes of the movie through tears. The musical score of the film was also excellent. Never interfering with the action or drama being presented but creating a backdrop of both classical composition and middle eastern themes. Special effects were great and set design perfect to the point that you wonder how it was that they recreated such a (seemingly) faithful Egyptian city. Acting was also pretty good although the actor that played Orestes couldn't fake crying to save his life. Still, he played the cocky young guy well in the first half and the conflicted prefect in the second half pretty well. The actor that played Davus was quite good, sneaking longing glances at Hypatia convincingly early on and expressing his conflicted soul well in the second half...join the Christians or stay loyal to his love? It all played out on his face as he prety much had no lines of dialog save a few. The only person not truly conflicted in the film is Hypatia. As she searches for the ""center"" of the heavens to explain astronomy she is truly the center of the film that everyone else moves around. As her enlightenment increases, the darkness and repression of religion also increases around her until like a flood she (or science) can't hold it back. Even as the overwhelmingly stressful atmosphere in Alexandria builds the director periodically pulls you out of the city and up into space to view the Earth from the stars, a reminder that as important as it all seems on the ground to the ant-like people shown running around in some scenes, really we are just minor players in the universe and we understand so little whether we are on the side of science or religion.

How does one classify this film? Action? Drama? Romance? Politics? Most likely it can just be summed up as historical fiction. It is all there and all done well so if you are a fan of any of those styles of movie check this one out. Another comment that I want to make is that I have never been to a film where the majority of the viewers stayed seated during the credits. I have to believe (since that is why I did it) that the ending was powerful enough that the viewers were just taking the extra time to soak it in. I won't say that the ending was shocking, in fact you saw it coming a long way off, it was just done well enough that you needed that extra minute to settle yourself before wandering out into the night under the stars and the wandering planets. It leaves you with the question of whether it is in fact the planets wandering or the people looking at them wandering as they search for meaning either through science or faith.",1412035200,,5637,4.562685093780849

4109027,5,B003CI2G6S,"This is a Spanish made film, filmed in Malta, with a chiefly English cast. I saw the R rated version, there apparently exists a PG version. A tense film, in which the Christian no-nothings thugs are compared to the Taliban. It is the end of civilization and the beginning of the Dark Ages. Hypatia was apparently too much of an intellectual and too unworldly to see when she was in danger, even when politically powerful Christians were willing to defend her against the evil St. Cyril. The film is repeatedly anti-Christian. First they persecute the pagans, then the Jews, then Hypatia the philosopher. There is no universal unconditional brotherly love among these terrorists. No doubt they eventually killed every intellectual in Alexandria. The problem with this film is it does not show the pagans fighting back. The home Roman Government by that time had become Christian, so the emperor decreed the Christians be allowed to enter the library -- a crime against civilization as the Christians destroyed everything, much like the Nazis destroyed everything in Germany that they didn't like. I wonder what did the emperor think would happen? This is never shown in the film. What was the emperor thinking? The mob became the rulers and persecuted anyone who did not think precisely like they did. They made everyone as stupid as sheep-- for a thousand years  and more. Somewhat like Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution -- pull all the intellectuals down to the level of peasants.
  Some of the Christians were a puzzle. Davus, the former slave, was obviously a brilliant man, what with his model of the solar system, but he smashes it when he becomes a Christian and anger at Hypatia rejecting his amorous advances. He joins the anti-intellectual mob and rejects science. Also, Orestes, the Prefect, who later became a Christian, did not challenge Cyril when he had the power to arrest him--he lacked the courage to do so. Also Orestes did not aggressively defend Hypatia enough. He was in a position to protect her, but failed. I see that as major flaw in the script.  He could have challenged the sexism in the scriptures (Cyril quotes Timothy about how women should be silent), but he is forbidden to do so by the Bishop of Cyrene, who insisted that what Cyril was voice of God, even though it is well-known that the bible contradicts itself on many levels. St. Paul viciously hated women, as did St, Ambrose, St. Timothy, and many others. The Bible is terribly sexist, this also is well-known.
  Cyril calls Hypatia a whore and witch, when its seems Hypatia had zero interest in having sex with anybody. She was obsessed with science, astronomy, philosophy--no time for sex. So Cyril calling her a whore is a deliberate lie and slander. He simply found the idea of a female intellectual revolting. The misogyny of Christianity is perversive and how could any woman call themselves a Christian is beyond me. It is all absurd.
  And of course priests have used Scripture to justify any atrocity, abomination, obscenity, perpetuated by the infallible Christians as the word of God. The primitive Christians were illiterate peasants, often slaves, with no culture, comparable to today's Taliban. This makes sense. The original Christians were fanatics among the poorest of the poor. They could comprehend the richness and color of the pagans, which they saw as decadent, so they destroyed what was foreign, alien, upper class, pagan. Oh, my! Yet for all that by 391 A.D. when this takes place many well-educated persons were Christians and were continually fighting among each other, creating numerous schisms and accusing each other as heretics. Thus invalidating any worth the Christian theology ever had.
  Hypatia was portrayed as a peacemaker and a detached intellectual obsessed with the solar system even when Alexandria was falling into Christain tyranny. St. Cyril, like many Christians in power, suppressed factions he did not like. He closed churches he declared heretical, and was opposed to the Nestorians, the Arians, and other schismatics. He railed against Julian, the last pagan Roman emperor, a virtuous man according to Edward Gibbon. Cyril was interested in power, conformity, dogma, and made those under him obeyed. In short, a rotten excuse for a Christian. Christianity became powerful through brute force, not from its codes, morality, theology, or being nice. A cult of no-nothing peasants willfully destroyed the intellectuals.
  The destruction of the library of Alexandria is well-known to students of history, but not to the general public. The general public are only fed propaganda that somehow Christianity is benign and enlightened, when it is the opposite. The destruction of the library in the film is the most upsetting part, as it is a horror cast upon knowledge and wisdom thrust on by the no-nothing Christians.  Christianity here is ignorance, violence, run by terrorists.
  The film is beautifully photographed though much is actually computer generated images; also it has impressive gigantic sets. The film on the whole is marvelous and breathtaking. It is a violent drama of the war between science and religion, a war that will never end until religion is erased from the Earth -- then we shall have peace.",1404259200,2,5254,5.057803468208093

4109033,5,B003CI2G6S,"This refreshingly counter-cultural movie is a dramatization of the Christian conquest of paganism, and the Christians' earliest attempts to convert the Jews by brute force and by law, in Alexandria, Egypt during the 4th-5th centuries AD in the reigns of Emperors Theodosius I and II. For historical context missing or unclear in the movie, in 380, Emperor Theodosius I decreed Nicene Christianity (Catholicism) to be the official state religion of the Roman Empire and outlawed all other religions (Cunctos populos; Edict of Thessalonica); Christian violence, destruction of temples, pogroms and civil war(s) ensued. Amazingly, Theodosius I (a.k.a. Theodosius the Great) is virtually unknown to most moderns and is barely mentioned, if at all, in historical accounts about that era. Alexandria is reported to have been the empire's most cosmopolitan and liberal city at that time, with people of various religions living there, and this did not sit well with the fanatically Christian Bishop, Cyril. Cyril and his gang of Christian monks, dressed in black and some with masks, are portrayed, probably accurately, as brutish, anti-intellectual authoritarian zealots prone to extreme violence, and this is shown in graphic, bloody detail (realistically severed heads and limbs, etc.). Their portrayals foretell the coming of medieval inquisitorial torturers, the Crusades, the forcible conversions and enslavement of the ""heathen"" Indians in the New World, the religious wars of reformation-era Europe, book-burnings, and 20th-21st century fascist terror. According to their version of logic, holy scripture is the only legitimate authority and there is no alternative; therefore, the pagan gods and icons have no authority, so the pagans must either convert to Christianity or be put to death. Cyril commands the pagans to kneel at his feet, renounce paganism and convert to Christianity. In contrast to the raging Christian mob, mobilized by religious fervor, the doomed pagans (dressed in white) and Jews are portrayed as non-violent, rational and cultured; however, a group of disrespectful Jews are shown razzing Cyril with the taunt, Jesus was a Jew (around this time, Cyril expelled the Jews from the city and confiscated their property). It's important to understand that paganism, the religion of classical antiquity, is polytheistic and relatively liberal, but Christianity is monotheistic and militantly intolerant of beliefs in any god other than THE ONE Christian God, as indicated by the Biblical commandment Thou shall have no other gods before me; this is evident in the movie to viewers who already know about Christianity's primal enmity toward paganism. Paganism was the religion of all the historically prominent thinkers of classical antiquity, such as the famous philosophers Plato, Aristotle, Thales of Miletus, Archimedes, and Cicero, but this fact is rarely acknowledged in today's Christian-dominated world, although it is known to educated religious authorities. The movie's central character is Hypatia, head of the Platonist school of Alexandria; however, all that's known about Hypatia is that she was a Hellenistic pagan philosopher and mathematician who was hacked to death by a mob of Coptic (Christian) monks about 415 AD; however, in the movie, Cyril, the thuggish Christian leader of the rampaging monks (he was subsequently sainted by the church as St. Cyril of Alexandria), labels her a witch, thereby inciting the monks to strip her naked and stone her to death, all as punishment for her resistance to conversion, and the implication that she's a woman and a philosopher/scientist/ intellectual. Not enough facts are known about Hypatia to fill a two-hour movie, so it can be surmised that most of the story's details about her personal life, such as her suspiciously stoic responses to mens' sexual advances and single-minded devotion to scientific study, are fictionalized. Hypatia is a historical anomaly due to the fact that a woman's place in ancient societies was to produce children, not to spend her time intellectualizing, and there is no evidence that Hypatia conformed to that imperative. The tragedy of the movie's Hypatia character and the portrayal of the Christian vandalism of the Serapeum at Alexandria effectively symbolize the subjugation of culture, learning and science by the marauding Christians, leading western civilization into the Dark Ages (Christianity's golden age). Thus, Christianity grew powerful, not just by means of non-violent persuasion (proselytizing) that moderns are conditioned to believe, but from violent, often bloody suppression against heretics and infidels. Even though the movie is about one of the most significant eras in history, it doesn't appear to have done well at the box office. Needless to say, it presents early Christianity in a very unfavorable way, unlike the usual religious-themed Hollywood movies which almost invariably present Christianity in a positive light, as if Christianity is the state religion.
To help understand the historical era and events that this movie is about, I recommend the following college-level history courses, which are available online for private study: The Fall of the Pagans and the Origins of Medieval Christianity, and Late Antiquity: Crisis and Transformation. Hypatia and this movie are mentioned in both of these courses, which is how I found out about the movie.",1400198400,4,5403,5.4951923076923075

I saw Pompeii when it was released because I was expecting brilliant historical accuracy. I swallow hype as much as everyone else I'm afraid. The film was just Gladiator with a lot of computer graphics thrown in and completely predictable.

This film in contrast exuded quality and class from every scene. The detail is remarkable - particularly in the clothes of that period and the Egyptian buildings which were transformed into churches. I know it was filmed in Malta but you'd never know it. I assumed that the young actors playing the main roles were just cast for their pulling power but when I checked it out I found out that the main protagonists were in fact quite young by our standards.

4109042,5,B003CI2G6S,"I would like to first address a couple of common points I often see brought up in reviews (by users and professional critics alike) for this film:

1) Despite what the American critics claim (almost all of whom completely missed the point of this film), and what the hideous American version of the DVD cover may indicate, this film is NOT about religious conflicts. It is a theme of the film, yes, but not the point of the film at all.

2) This film is actually fairly historically accurate. Yes, some artistic licenses were taken, and Christian apologists in particular were very quick to rip the film apart for it (while they completely overlook the issues in all the ridiculous Bible movies). But compared to most historical films, this is actually one of the more truthful ones. Many of the events in the film were from actual witness accounts (look up Hypatia on Wikipedia) - including Hypatia's rejection of a suitor by handing him a rag with her menstrual blood, and Orestes refusing to kneel before Cyril. If anything, the one major thing the film did alter was the way Hypatia died - it softened it a lot.

Now, about the film: To fully understand the message and philosophy of this film, you will have to have seen Carl Sagan's ""Cosmos: A Personal Voyage"" beforehand. I happened to have seen Cosmos only weeks before finding out about Agora (which I came across on RottenTomato by completely, though uncanny, coincidence) - Carl Sagan had a particular fascination with the Library of Alexandria as well as Hypatia. So when I found out ""Agora"" was a story about Hypatia, I was very excited to check it out - but I thought the film wasn't going to be anything out of the ordinary.

I was completely wrong. Not only was this film one of the most intense, artistic, well-acted and well-edited masterpiece I've ever seen (and I am VERY picky with films), the way Hypatia was depicted as well as all the aerial (or even outer space) shots during scenes of human conflict were all very strongly reminiscent of the message presented in Cosmos. The resemblance in terms of message/philosophy between ""Agora"" and ""Cosmos"" had me very curious, so I looked up the film's production notes.

So it turned out that the film's director, Alejandro Amenbar, was stargazing with his friend one night, and they discussed the possibility of existence of extraterrestrial life. His friend used the opportunity to introduce Alejandro to Carl Sagan's ""Cosmos"". Not only did ""Cosmos"" make a profound impact on Alejandro, Sagan's account of Hypatia's story inspired him to make this film. So seriously, if you haven't seen Cosmos yet, go watch it (it's full of poetic awesomeness), THEN watch Agora (again if you have to - trust me you will pick up a lot more things about the film you likely missed the first time around).

Hypatia is the focal point of the entire story - the conflicts between the various religions (Christians, Jews, and Pagans) only serve as a background to her story. Hypatia is wholly consumed by her desire for knowledge - to know the truth behind the cosmos is to know perfection itself. For this reason she was uninterested in romance (she views herself as imperfect), or taking part in religion or politics (she regards political and religious strife as something petty and trivial). Time and time again, during scenes of riots and battles, the camera zooms out and looks down upon humanity from far away - this is meant to depict how small, insignificant, and alone we are in the vastness of the universe - yet we fight each other over these superficial differences such as religious belief and ethnicity. There were also several scenes where humans were compared to ants (When the Christians were camping outside the Library, and the Roman soldiers came to intervene - there was a shot that focused on a bunch of ants fighting one another in the foreground, before zooming onto the Roman soldiers in the background. Likewise, when the Library was sacked, a time-lapsed aerial camera showed the Christians - dressed in black robes - skittering around like ants to collect books and burn them in smoking piles). This is a commentary on humans' mob mentality - our tendency to follow a leader or ideology blindly without question.

Hypatia is the lone voice of reason in the story. She repeatedly tells her bickering disciples that ""More things unite us than divide us"".  And, quite dishearteningly, we see some of her key disciples abandon compassion and reason due to politics or religious faith (Orestes abandons his inquisitive nature in favor of ""pragmatism"" in politics. Synesius abandons his compassion when Hypatia refuses to be baptized, telling him ""You do not question what you believe. You cannot. I must."" Likewise, Davus lost his ability to forgive as he became more and more deeply involved in his newfound Christian faith).

Now, a lot of religious folks (especially Christians) have blasted this film for its ""unfair treatment of the Christian faith"". This is in all seriousness an extremely stupid accusation to make. The film, in fact, depicted both the good sides and bad sides of each religion contained within. For example, Orestes - a pagan at the start of the film, viciously defended his fellow Christian disciples when the other pagans tried to imprison them (after the Library was surrounded by Christians). Ammonius, a devout Christian, convinced Davus to give up the bread he bought for his master and give them to the poor. All the characters in the film (aside from Cyril) are arguably ""good people"" - but they were drawn into conflicts against one another because of their faith. The message here is quite simple: Religion is detrimental to human progress and unity.

""Agora"" is a story about the fall of a civilization from injustice (slavery and poverty plagued Rome), the fall of humanity from reason, and a brilliant woman who was unfortunately born in the wrong century and so was caught up in the middle of all of this. Even with how much the film softened the manner of her death, you will still likely walk away from the film feeling sick to the stomach and depressed for a week afterward.

Despite that, this film is a must-watch for rational thinkers everywhere. It's a stark reminder of why ""we must not let this happen again"".",1395964800,2,6281,4.833488372093023

My only reason for not giving it five stars relates to problems with the hardware on which we viewed it: a generally very good PC monitor on which the superimposed text near the end was illegible, not a problem on the Kindle Fire, but on the latter, only the full-screen view was tolerable, but otherwise (for example, if you want to scroll rapidly through the film) it was marred by the apparently inescapable IMDB cast information panel, and I may be able to figure out how to close that without losing it or other options.",1394582400,,868,4.606451612903226

They are challenged by the followers of the new sect of Judaism that is becoming a religion of its own, Christianity. The conflict is not over theology alone, but also power, and these Christians are not gentle. The Jews, followers of their own scriptures without the messianic revisionism of the Christians, are drawn into the struggle, while the declining Roman empire tries to mediate between the parties and control the unrest.

Agora is set during the tumultuous decades at the end of the 4th and early 5th century AD. It centers around the riots in the Egyptian city of Alexandria between various sects and factions. Between government and mob. Between pragmatists and fundamentalists. Sound familiar? It should. The same sort of thing is occurring today, 1600 years later. The period in the film, known as late antiquity, is an important one, because the order of the modern word was forged in these fires. Yet, most people, including a fair sprinkling of my Ivy League friends, know almost nothing about it. The average American would be lucky to know this is the same Alexandria that hosted the affairs of Cleopatra -- over 400 years earlier. They might not distinguish these sandal wearers from the spear toting Spartans of 300 -- but that battle occurred 900 years before this one! The ancient world is not one moment, but a vast progression of political and social evolution -- all informing our own world.

Back to 400 AD and Alexandria. The city was a peculiar and important experiment. Founded by Alexander the Great in 331 BC on the shores of the Mediterranean at the Nile delta, it was one of the most cosmopolitan in the world, being the poster child for the very idea of Hellenism and the its questioning and philosophic spirit. Perfect, no, but this is the city that housed the Great Library (which desired to obtain a copy of every work written by man) and taught and nurtured 700 years worth of scholars of all faiths. The Hebrew bible was translated here from Aramaic into Greek.

Agora is not a perfect movie by any stretch, but it does an impressive job of bringing to life the grandeur, sadness, and dust of this ancient place. With superb costumes and by combining grand and detailed sets with judicious CG / Model aerial shots it's one of the best looking depictions of the ancient world I've  seen. It also does a great job with the substance, if not the detail of the history. The central figure is the female philosopher Hypatia, about whom relatively little is known. Her scientific role is a bit extrapolated, but the political situation is fairly faithful. In just a couple of decades Christianity goes from being a minor (and illegal) cult to the one and only state religion of the aging Roman Empire. It is at the hands of men like Saint Cyril of Alexandria (the villain of the film) that established the theological/political principle of religious intolerance that poisons our world today.

Prior to this, men of all nations did their fair (and more) share of killing, usually over political and economic objectives. But in the polyglot world of antiquity, variation of belief was usually taken as a given, separate and outside the world of pragmatic gain (which generally took precedence).

People constantly ask me (knowing I'm a Roman history buff) ""how did Rome fall?"" Well, when you watch how Cyril maneuvers the liberal Imperial Prefect Orestes you find one of the answers to this complex question. This moment, which appears roughly fairly faithful to historical sources , is about as brilliant a bit of political manipulation as the world has ever witnessed. Cyril, preaching from his pulpit, reads to assembled politicians from the bible, outlining his fundamentalist agenda, and then segueing into a question of faith, forces his opponents -- in front of the mob -- to kneel and declare their faith to the book (held aloft by him!). But what are they kneeling to? The power of God or the ambition of man?

The division of the Roman Empire into two parts, the rise of Christianity, the destruction of the Pagan religions and sad to state, the added destruction of long established Greek Science and Philosophy all through ignorance and superstition. The Christian Leaders destroyed the Library of Alexandria and murdered a Teacher of Science and Astronomy, Hypathia.  There is no doubt that at that period, Christianity was recently an accepted faith and at the same time, Converts were very emotionally involved so the destruction of the past which had fought against the growth of Christianity - even the past which included the great Scholars was to be destroyed as an established pattern of re-affirming the new religion of Christianity.

In Agora, we see this conflagration aligned with a degree by the Coptic Pope Theophilus; a plausible though not highly-competitive theory. Rachel Weisz plays the role of Hypatia, a beloved and intelligent mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher. In a patriarchal society, she encounters her share of friction, but she cannot overcome the strong pulls from the diametrically opposed political factions: the occupying Romans, the expanding population of over zealous Christians, and even her own local government administration led by a would-be-jilted former childhood associate. Toss in an unrequited love, and you have enough sexual tension and political upheaval to rival any modern day story of consternation. I enjoyed the epic-quality of the movie, which showcased large panoramic views of ancient Alexandria, and the Great Library itself can legitimately be considered its own character.

The recreation, however much it may have been based on speculation (almost all of the ancient city is under water), the recreation of the city of Alexandria draws you in, with a level of detail I have not seen since the city of Minas Tirith in ""Lord of the Rings."" You can almost feed the grit and the heat of the fires and the decay of old buildings. Even if most of it is done with blue screen and CGI, it must have kept lots of effects artists up for long hours.

The historical story (much of which I checked after watching the movie) is more accurate than one may have presumed. All the principal characters, such as Hypatia, Cyril, and Orestes are real, mentioned in the Church History of Socrates Scholasticus. In fact, even the events of the last 20 minutes are described in that history. The further one goes back in history, the more speculative the story becomes. There is a later history which accuses Hypatia of using pagan wiles with music and other devious methods. The movie may use what sound like facts from both, but the tone is from the more moderate Socrates.

Aside from Rachel Weisz, none of the actors are well known, except that the French character actor, Michael Lonsdale who has a familiar face from dozens of appearances (the Abbot in ""The Name of the Rose""). All actors, both adult and adolescent versions of the characters, do well. There is nothing to fault there.

I hope that people who see the movie realize this is real history (at least there is about two paragraphs of real history on which the story is based.)

What might be hard to discern is ""What was the point?"" The title, ""Agora"", a Greek word for what we might call a mini-mall, has nothing to do with the story, except that a lot of action takes place in the streets of Alexandria. Of the three factions, early on, the pagans, then the Jews and the Christians, it is hard to identify any one as the villain, although it seemed the writer / director seemed to be a bit hard on the Christians and bishop of Alexandria, Cyril. Why, for example, were the pagans in white, the Jews in brown, and the Christians in black?

As I sat through the movie, I could not help thinking that all this exposition must be leading somewhere. The somewhere doesn't really arrive until the last 20 minutes of the movie.

However, this movie was recommended by a professor in a video course I am taking on the transition from Paganism to Christianity.

The scenes, clothing and attitudes seem to present an excellent portrayal of Alexandria at the end of the Roman Empire. It does not clean up the brutality of the period by making the emerging Christian movement appear to be one of kindness, love and understanding towards their fellow humans who might not agree with their religious beliefs.  It reveals that the early Christians of the 5th century behaved very much like the Taliban of the Islamic culture - intolerant and politically motivated, rather than guided by ""God"".  ""Convert or Die"" was as prevalent then as it is now.

Some of the dialog was difficult to hear as people spoke in whispers and low voices since, just as in modern radical Islamic settings, your words could condemn you to death. Those who only understand the evolution of Christianity through Bible Study groups might feel that this film was unduly harsh on the Christians; those who understand History as what it really was, will find this to be a realistic look at a world that has been romanticized to conceal the unpleasant, ugly facts  of 'how the West was won' in the late Roman Empire.

Not a pleasant 'feel-good' movie; it is one that can be disturbing in its honesty and historical significance. It is no surprise that it was never released in the USA to the general movie audience.

4109079,5,B003CI2G6S,"This film is about last days of the Roman Empire and it is set in Alexandria, Egypt.  I picked it for several reasons:  Agora in Alexandria was one of the first public libraries where young, noble men had their lessons thought to them and where they freely exchanged their ideas.  It was a breeding ground for raising new leaders for the future generations.  But this is also a story about Hypatia, one of the first female philosophers from the ancient times known to mankind.  Although none of her written work remains today, she was well known figure and her unfortunate demise is just one of the facts that grants her immortality.

Hypatia devoted her entire life to teaching, writing and questioning the world around her.  As a philosopher, she raised questions related to mankind as well as God and Universe.  During her life, religion was depply divided between pagans, who worshiped Egyptian Gods, Jews who believed in a single God and Christinas fairly new religion who accepted teachings of Jesus and were waiting for their salvation.  There was little tolerance between these three fractions and with Roman Empire loosing its grip in that part of the world, it was a place destined for uprising between old world and the new one; between aristocracy and their slaves.

I liked the fact that director choose to portray Hypatia as a woman devoted to her profession and able to separate herself from men she was teaching, in spite of the fact that many of them fell in love with her for her brilliant mind and her compassionate spirit.  Her beauty from the inside out, transcends the social order of the time which is both her strenght and her fall.  Being unmarried woman, she has no protector.  Her profession requires of her to constantly question and challenge the world around her which does not sit  well with men in power.  Her brutal death makes her a martyr that makes her immortal for eternity.

Great movie, with story well told.  Director did not attempt to appease any of the religious groups which some audiences may find difficult to accept.

You do not watch this film because it has cool fighting scenes. You watch this film if you are interested in ideas, like the role of religion at the time, and even more generally. Many of the Christians behave like today's Islamists, for instance by burning books and attacking women.

Historically, the movie is fairly accurate, even though some of the events in the movie did not happen simultaneously at all. Clearly the film is critical towards religion. At one point the bishop says the following: ""I also want women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God. A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent.""

She lived during a period of religious and political turmoil.  Christian mobs destroyed the great library in Alexandria.  Dogmatism replaced reason.  Fundamentalism was replacing philosophy.  Hypatia struggled to maintain her rationality and independence of thought as her country degenerated into theocracy.  She would be brutally killed and mutilated by a mob of fanatics, partly as a result of local political conflicts, but also because the religious views of the day did not tolerate educated women in positions of intellectual leadership.",1368316800,,851,5.550387596899225
4109083,4,B003CI2G6S,"I rented this after doing some late night reading which made mention of Hypatia's painful end at the hands of Alexandria's Christian ruler (I believe it was Augustus)

I've wanted to see this film ever since the previews years ago but I'm glad I waited until I had some solid historical context from my reading, otherwise this would have been just some sword & sandal drama with ancient guys in robes jews and Christians all going at it. My hat's off the director for taking on such a richly complicated story set in an era most people know little about or do not grasp the significance of. I enjoyed the speed and depth of emotion carved out by different characters and the actors. I particularly enjoyed the quietly powerful and dashing Orestes character, without whom I believe Rachel Wesz's Hypatia would have been less intriguing and flat. some criticisms; I found the music to be a tad repetitive. not sure whether the filmmaker's budget in this area was restrained but the same track of a woman's wailing voice played over and over through so many scenes it became aggravating and cliche. some simple instrumental score or even more modern electronic mixing would have done the film more justice. secondly, I found the portrayal of jews & christians in this film sloppy. I would not go so far as anti-semitic because I think that's too severe. but the older jews who address Orestes could have come off a sketch comedy set. the Christianized jews were no better, with their middle eastern & Israeli accents, these were the most semitic looking of the bunch. it was a tad too caricatured and simplistic for my taste (yes I'm jewish) the 'new' jews vs the 'old' jews. casting and dialogue should have taken a different tone. lastly, the Davus slave character literally had the same mute expression on his face the entire time. I liked his face, I think most people would agree his performance was moving in its own right. but again, from an acting point of view it got tedious to see that sad scowl every time the camera panned over. lastly, the character of Hypatia was a mixed bag for me. I loved the lack of pretense (no makeup, no bulging cleavage or sexist feminine seductive stances) and yet at times the character looked and sounded like a simple schoolgirl. reaching up to the stars while laying on a pillow and confessing she'd never loved. I found this character diminished by the writer & director. her story, stature and role in the film was watered down to say the least. if anything she was a vehicle to summarize the cosmological and philosophical questions of the day, rather than a prominent mathematician and philosopher of great talent and renown who posed a serious threat to the new republic.

Although fictionalized, I liked how they filmed her death. in reality she was taken by a group of men, dragged to a church and 'skinned alive' as one of the men in the movie suggests. no naked suffocation by a lifelong friend and would be lover. Hypatia's skin was scraped off bit by bit while she was fully conscious. if anything, the strength of this film is in showing how the roots of Christianity and the transfer of power from one civilization to another was rooted in mob mentality. the teachings of Jesus the healer/prophet vs the religion of his followers hundreds of years later could not have been more different. equating brutality with the word of god and his magnificence made the Christian faith one of brute force and violence, especially towards the jews who presented a constant problem theologically and culturally having been the 'chosen' ones who closely followed the word of god in their own book which far predated Christ. that many if not most were forced and brainwashed into converting, or had to trade spiritual guidance for unethical behavior shows the power hungry nature of this small sect turned world religion. lastly, what it shows so clearly and painfully is the Church's backwater thinking as well as disregard for the rule of law, science and freedom, not to mention its deep hatred of women. of course Hypatia was nothing more than a filthy pagan whore witch. like so many after her she was killed and tortured for holding steadfast to thousands of years worth of human exploration, medicine philosophy and a belief system rooted in the magic of nature and the universe - not some resurrected dead guy nailed to a cross.",1368316800,5,4377,4.742782152230971

I saw the movie for that reason as i am interested in philosophy , science and especially the historical religious views that are due for exposure and adaptation /change from what was originally taught by teachers and to reveal how their teachings were distorted to enslave the populace and keep them UN-empowered. I do think this movie did a fine representation of that but it was worth viewing for much more that it encompassed and regardless of your interest or personal views of science or religion. It has much to offer in its storyline, its characters, and its portrayal of the times and humanity itself then and now and always.  The portrayal of a beautiful and powerful woman who was greatly deeply and truly loved and was a magnificent teacher with a extra-ordinary mind and a lot of compassion and wisdom...also a powerful leader  (great for both men and women to see this example)....These as well as the themes within the main theme...of science vs religion...and religions against one another..the portrayal of love, loyalty, betrayal, human emotions and fears, truth and education, passion for what is right, and so on....encompassing a wide range of representations and varying view points of these in an interesting and well done performance and visually well-accomplished work. Finally the kind of prejudice woman historically have withstood and conquered or succumbed to, is also nicely portrayed in this film and gives a really powerful representation of how a woman can stand in her own power and how truth and knowledge and a keen and inquiring mind is a power and a strength that may not easily succumb to the intimidation of those who use  even the most vile means of physical abuse and such qualities and kind of power may lead others in victory even under such oppressive circumstances. And finally that victory may be defined in many different ways and that is a personal choice not one that someone should rely on anyone else;s criteria for or they will suffer the consequences of a life chosen for and not by them which is really never a victory at all even if it appears to be in view of the populace (or popular opinion).",1366588800,,2294,4.8295165394402035

4109098,4,B003CI2G6S,"This is a good movie that could have been great were it not for two major flaws. Since I think there's much of value here I'll focus on what the film did right before getting to what it did wrong.

First off, and most obviously, comes the sets and costumes. The sets here are truly amazing. This film's Alexandria is possibly the most realistic portrayal of an ancient city on film. It's run down, populous, and colorful. The costumes are likewise realistic using a much heavier cloth than we're used to seeing in film. When this is combined with some excellent cinematography and visual themes (including a recurring satellite view) it makes for a visually stunning film. I don't know how they did this on such a small budget but it stands proudly as one of the most beautiful historical dramas put to film.

The second thing I loved about this movie is simply it's choice of time and subject. The Roman Empire seems to end with the death of Commodus judging from Hollywood productions. It's very nice to see a film that takes place in Rome's final century. The choice of philosophers for a theme is also excellent. Rachel Weisz makes a wonderful Hypatia and the scenes with her working to understand the nature of the universe are the best in the film. In fact, if the film had consisted entirely of this plot line it'd have been simply perfect. The love of knowledge and culture really comes through in a big way. They pay strict attention to what science was known at the time and how it was taught, and although they do have some rather implausible speculation about what she knew it manages to make it seem believable.

Now we get to the problems. First and most obvious is the fact that the film is basically several films in one. And you can take that in several ways. To deal with the most obvious example the film tells a complete narrative that ends around the halfway point only to start up again several decades later. You can also see two separate movies within the plot. One half is Hypatia's quest to understand the physical world, the other is based around the rise of Christianity. Both of these plots are intertwined throughout the film but they are never interconnected. The two stories happen in pretty much complete isolation to each other, particularly in the second half. The Christian scenes are boring too and every scene not dealing with Hypatia seems like a distraction. Really, the film needed to pick one of these themes and make them the subtext because they do not combine well together.

Secondly the film has some terrible character choices. Hypatia herself is great, her father likewise, and the prefect Orestes alternates between being great and incomprehensible. The real problem comes in the slave character Davus, who is madly in love with Hypatia and so turns to Christianity to get some relief. The slave in love with his master is about as tired a plot as you can get in Roman films and the way they do it doesn't help here. Hypatia's part in it is quite good revealing a sheer indifference that was hidden beneath her earlier compassion, but Davus' part in the story generally feels phony and tacked on. The ending in particular is unspectacular and out of the blue. The Christian characters in general are without nuance or personality except for fanaticism. The only exception to this is her former student who has some positive qualities. In general it is the reduction of all Christian characters to crude stereotypes that is annoying. The various debates of the period have been simplified into religious conflicts with extremely simplified issues. For example the whole issue with Cyrus wasn't about whether pagans could still have a role in the city (they would continue to do so for over a century) but a power struggle between a prefect and a bishop. Whether the changes made are fair or not they make the film uninteresting. While I do get what he's saying about religious fundamentalism he could have done so more interestingly and more subtly if it had been the subtext of the film and not part of a joint focus.

I have other minor complaints about the film from a historical angle, such as the fact that Hypatia is presented as secular when in fact she was a pagan, but none of them take away from the fun of it. I just wish that all the Hypatia scenes could be excised from the religious fundamentalist scenes and put into a movie of their own. Honestly, Hypatia isn't even driving the plot in her own film. At no point does she have any influence on outside events.

I don't think that Hypatia herself would be very happy (looking down from one of Plotinus' upper celestial realms?) if viewers didn't ask some questions and research the truth behind these historical characters and places (what really happened to the Great Library of Alexandria? Was Christianity in the 4th century best characterized as a violent mob of intolerant fanatics? Was Hypatia really that young and good-looking?

4109107,2,B003CI2G6S,"I  gave this two stars because the production value is amazing, however, it is historically inaccurate. The movie demonizes Christians, namely Cyril of Alexandria. The movie makes it seem as if Cyril called Hypatia out by referring to her as a ""witch"", conjuring up stories of the salem witch trials in the minds of the viewer. This word would have been completely foreign to the people of Egypt and if Cyril would have been referring to her as a pagan or priestess, well, that was not all that uncommon and certainly would not have incited mob violence against Hypatia, in fact, Cyril was trying to make amends with Orestes who was without a doubt influenced by Hypatia, as Socrates Scholasticus makes clear. The mob violence against Hypatia was due to her influencing Orestes against the Christians.

What actually happened was that the jews had Orestes publicly torture and kill Hirax because he was an alleged spy. The jews blamed him and Cyril for the closing of their theater, which caused all sorts of public drunkeness and violence in itself. Cyril, knowing that the people of Alexandria would react swiftly against the jews, personally had the majority of them removed before any massacre could happen, despite what the movie shows, Cyrils intentions were undoubtedly to protect the jews from massacre and yet appease the masses who were tired of being persecuted and plotted against by the jews. For instance, the incident in the movie where the jews lured the Christians to the church to kill them is actually true.

It is sad that Cyril is portrayed as some religious fanatic hell bent on murder and destruction, none of which can be proven with valid historical sources, and none of this is seen in his letters. Even when writing to his opponents he shows the utmost respect and love towards them. This movie could have been so much better, however, it is an offense to any student of history, let alone Christians. These are not typical mistakes, which happen sometimes, many of these are blatant falsehoods used to lead the viewer to a specific conclusion. That conclusion? Religion is opposed to science and reason. For instance, there is a part in the movie where the Parabolani are speaking about the earth MUST be flat, this is another blatant lie contrived to make Christians look like backwards simple minded fools. This ""flat earth"" was last believed before Christ!!! It is a foolish movie full of lies to try and make Christianity look bad.

4109133,1,B003CI2G6S,"Agora was the marketplace in Alexandria where religious debates took place.  Agora, the movie, is a fallacy.

Alejandro Amenabar's portrayal of Christians as a hysterical, filthy, violent crowd of disheveled animals is not surprising since the overwhelming majority of film-makers and novel-writers are either atheists or leftists. His choice of Miss Weisz was a bad one: at the time the story takes place, Hypathia would be on her 50's. The main argument of the movie seems to be that Cyril (the Christian Patriarch of Alexandria) declared Hypatia to be a witch, therefore inciting Christian zealots to murder her. She is portrayed desperately gathering scrolls from the library before the hysterical Christian mob can get to it, and nobly dies, defending reason and science against the ignoramus Christians! Yes, Cyril's uncle (Theophilus) destroyed pagan statues in the pagan temple area of Alexandria, but it was Julius Caesar who it seems accidentally burned down the library. Some sources believe Muslim conquerors in the seventh century A.D. are the responsible party. Accounts of that day, both Christian and pagan, so much as hint at the destruction of any large collection of books. Not even the pagan Eunapius of Sardis (who despised Christians) ever suggested such a thing happened. And pagan historian Ammianus Marcellinus, describing the Serapeum not long before its demolition, spoke of its libraries as no longer in existence.

Amenabar's film has an arresting resemblance to Carl Sagan's TV program ""Cosmos"" (""The Mysterious Fate of the Great Library of Alexandria""), where Hypatia is shown as a scientist and philosopher who became a victim of the wicked Cyril. According to Sagan ""the supreme tragedy was that when the Christians came to burn down the great library of Alexandria, there was no one to stop them."" Sagan based his account upon Edward Gibbon's anti-Christian ""The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire."" Gibbon (who misread a sentence from the Christian historian Orosius) was the first to link Hypatia's murder with the burning of the Alexandrian library. Yet, there is no evidence connecting Hypatia to any library in Alexandria at all. The Sarapeum was sacked by angry Christians in her time, as a result to pagan defilements of Christian houses of worship.

In Socrates Scholasticus' Historia Ecclesiastica there is an interesting description of the destruction of the Serapeum temple complex: ""The pagans of Alexandria, and especially the professors of philosophy, were unable to repress their rage at this exposure, and exceeded in revengeful ferocity their outrages on a former occasion: for with one accord, at a preconcerted signal, they rushed impetuously upon the Christians, and murdered every one they could lay hands on. The Christians also made an attempt to resist the assailants, and so the mischief was the more augmented. This desperate affray was prolonged until satiety of bloodshed put an end to it. Then it was discovered that very few of the heathens had been killed, but a great number of Christians; while the number of wounded on each side was almost innumerable.""  It seems Hypatia was caught in the struggle between Orestes (the civil authority) and Cyril (the bishop), and was killed in retaliation for the murder of some of Cyril's supporters by agents of Orestes (it seems by the ""parabalani,"" a fraternity originally founded to care for Alexandria's poor).

The film portrays Hypatia as an astronomer (clearly in order to draw comparison with Galileo), but she was best known as a follower of Plato and Plotinus. There were Christians in Hypatia's classes, Christian bishops among her circle of friends, Christian theologians--like Augustine, Ambrose, and Origen--enthusiastic advocates of neo-Platonism. (One of her most ardent students, Bishop Synesius, wrote several letters to her, calling her ""mother, sister, teacher, and withal benefactress, and whatsoever is honored in name and deed."") So her portrayal as the noble champion of reason against a bunch of disheveled half-crazed Christian is more than ridiculous: it is insidious! (Incidentally, she was not the inventor of either the astrolabe or the hydrometer. The hydrometer was mentioned in a letter to her by her friend Synesius of Cyrene, where he explained how the device was made, so she could arrange to have one built for him!)

But Mr. Amenabar's tricks are also aesthetic. In one scene the camera is on a high point of vantage overlooking the Alexandria library while vandalized by the Christian mob: it is clearly intentional that it makes the Christians look like cockroaches. (Incidentally, and according to historical records, the Jews also took part in the fighting that often occurred among the religious factions in Alexandria.) Another even more perverse scene shows a group of scruffy Christians carting away bodies of Jews they had just killed, a clear parallel to the bodies of the Jews seen in photographs of concentration camps. Had Mel Gibson made a movie depicting muslims the way this movie depicts Christians, he would not have long to live! Yes, Cyril was a harsh ruler; he did expel the Jews from Alexandria against the wishes of Orestes; but there is no concrete evidence that he led a murderous crusade against the Jews nor that he had a role in the murder of Hypatia. It seems her murder was instigated by Peter, a minor layman in Cyril's church. Apparently, Peter and his followers believed Hypatia was somehow preventing Orestes and Cyril's reconciling. And Socratis Scholasticus condemns the deed: ""This affair brought not the least opprobrium, not only upon Cyril, but also upon the whole Alexandrian church. And surely nothing can be farther from the spirit of Christianity than the allowance of massacres, fights, and transactions of that sort."" (It reminds me of a certain religion that actually encourages ""massacres""!) Finally, the movie portrays Christians as being opposed to scientific investigations, as if only atheists--or pagans--honored science!

4109135,2,B003CI2G6S,"Apparently, the point of this movie was to warn against the dangers of unfettered religious fanaticism and not to convey an historically accurate tale of the philosopher Hypatia.  The setting is in the early years following the edict of Milan that would eventually lead to the acceptance of Christianity as the Roman state religion.  However, the Christian bishops of this movie are not portrayed as the neo-Platonic philosophers they tended to be but as something more akin to modern Fundamentalist extremists.  Such anachronisms are expected from the movie business but then to build subtle error into outright inaccuracy, the script writers decided to pin the blame for burning the great library at Alexandria on these same proto-Charismatics.  Never mind that at the time of the movie setting the library had already been burned centuries before by Roman armies.  No, once again there seems to be an underlying agenda that must force the past to fit the modern bias toward faith as opposed to enlightened and morally superior reason and science.  History has many examples of injustice on the part of Christians (or any group for that matter).  But perpetuating the anti-faith myths such as the Hypatia incident and Galileo without an honest treatment of the historical context is becoming a modern film clich.  It is unfortunate because the cinematography is original in recreating ancient Alexandria in the context of the entire world.

As a Deist (a Deist believes in God based on the application of their reason and the laws and designs in Nature and rejects the man-made ""revealed""/hearsay religions like Christianity, Judaism and Islam) it was a moving account of a woman's search for reality and truth via her reason. Hypatia, the real life thoughtful and courageous teacher and philosopher was murdered by the Christians. One of the methods used by the Christian clergy to rile up the Christian mob against her was 1 Timothy 2:11-12 which teaches this ignorant and ungodly teaching: ""Let the women learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence."" The clergyman then accused Hypatia of being a witch which really got the faithful angry! We all know what the Bible teaches at Exodus 22:18 - ""Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live."" Since the Christian scriptures were clear on what the non-thinking faithful had to do, they killed her.

4109139,5,B003CI2G6S,"The film Agora explores, without sentiment or melodrama, a time period and a subject that I have often overlooked; the violent and tragic end of the Pagan Classical World and the beginning of the Christian Dominated West, which also launched the Dark Ages. Watching this film I cannot help but ask myself, would we have been better off if the worshippers of Serapes and Isis had won the day.

The movie was divided into two historic parts: the sheltered pagan world of wealth and status-quo where Christianity was no more than an annoying cult; and the Christian world under Emperor Theodosius with all of its early Patriarchs and Saints. The film's main character, Hypatia, was a sheltered, brilliant, upper class Pagan: a mathematician and philosopher living in a liberal world of free thought. Before her, all the ancient knowledge of Rome, Greece, and the Near East lay in scrolls in the Great Library of Alexandria: a treasure that only the pagans seemed to comprehend. This pagan world felt a little bit like our own, with its freedom of thought and its blind belief in the universal search for knowledge and understanding. One of my favorite things about the pagan world was that the elite Patricians and the wealthy Jews all enjoyed the theater.

The pagan world presented in the film had a dark side as well. The slaves although treated somewhat warmly still had to wear a collar and they were also whipped. Another problem was in the established pagan cult religion of Serapes and its high priest who was an ass. But aren't so many ""high priests"" and people in authority asses, even today. It was a world in decline but Hypatia and the other privileged Pagans didn't know it. She dwelt in the realm of the mind, protected by the serapium and walls of the Great Library. Yet down below in the Agora the growing number of discontented Christians were about to rise up and smash the pagan world to bits. And that's exactly what they did, by tearing down the statues, taking over the city, and burning all of the scrolls in the library to ash, thus casting a darkness over the mind of the world which wouldn't lift until the Renaissance.

In the second half of the film we see Christianized Alexandria some years later. Here the freedom of the mind that was so prevalent in the beginning has been crushed. Most members of the pagan Patrician class have by now converted to Christianity whether they believed in Christ or not. Hypatia is the last holdout, huddled in her mansion working on her brilliant theory of a heliocentric universe while the world around her slips into intolerant religious darkness based on faith and scripture alone. As the Bishop held the Bible over his head proclaiming that the scriptures say that women should be seen but not heard a chill went down my spine. The Christians had traded in all books and all knowledge for that one book: the Holy Bible. And we today are still suffering under the yoke of that mindset whenever evolution is disputed or someone thumps their Bible proclaiming it to be the indefatigable word of God.",1345075200,5,3062,4.730337078651686

The violins would have come out, minorities would have held tearful candlelit vigils outside movie theatres, the film would have been banned and the director would have been forced into Hollywood exile.

As it turns out, the punch went to the solar-plexus of Christianity, which meant a few Catholic feathers were ruffled, and everyone apart from evangelistic atheists and myself fell alseep mid-way through the movie. While it is, of course, unacceptable to denigrate, insult and marginalise any world religion, Christianity inexplicably enjoys exemption from this rule.

That's not saying that individuals acting in the name of Christianity have not done some dreadful things - there is no question of this. They destroyed the cultures of meso-America as best they could, they attempted the same in South America, they conducted the inquisition and they burned thousands of innocent women alive at the stake. The list is long and various legitimate films could have been made based on these events.

What they dind't do is single-handedly destroy the library at Alexandria. At worst Christians acting under the edict of Theodosius are thought to have destroyed pagan religious artifacts once the library had already been burned down in 48BC and then looted during an attack by the Emperor Aurelian on the city of Alexandria in the 3rd century BC.

Naturally, you wouldn't realise this watching the movie, which makes it appear as Theodosious single handedly and deliberately destroyed the world's ancient teachings in the name of Christianity. If this type of allegation had been  made against a living person it would have resulted in a fairly meaty libel case, but since Alejandro Amenbar's adversaries can't speak for themselves by dint of being dead, he gets to grind his axe against Christianity without any interference.

The result is that Amenabar gets to:
1. Falsely portray the destruction of the literary contents of the library as a Christian act
2. Falsely portray the murder of Hypatia as a Christian act (it is only known that she was murdered by a mob)

In amongst all this you have a love story that doesn't quite work, lots of hacking people to bits and Hypatia being falsely credited with finding a scientific rational for the heliocentric view of the universe.

In other words, what you have is a work of anti-Christian fiction loosely based on historical events and personalities.

The film we'll never see is how direct anti-Christian policies in the gloriously atheistic Soviet Union led to some of the worst atrocities in modern history - for instance the boiling alive of the Bishop of Voronezh in a cauldron of boiling tar (just one of the 20 odd million unluckly eggs that were broken in the making of the delectable socialist omelette of the Soviet Union).

4109142,4,B003CI2G6S,"You know, it's factual that the Alexandrian library was destroyed several times, historically.  And as a proponent of logic and reason it's been a pet peeve of mine that knowledge and wisdom of the previous cultures were despised, whether for monetary gain or out of religious zeal.  I don't really know whether the Bishop Cyril was anywhere as political or violent as the character who incites violence in this film.

Alas, these violent episodes were concurrent with the suppression of Arian Christianity, concurrent with the poisoning of Arius, when a Roman emperor Theodosius dictated the doctrine of the Christian church for the tangible political motive of preventing civil war.

Whatever shortcomings are inherent to this fictional, historical drama, it's portrayal of the influences of theocratic rule are not sugar coated.

4109143,5,B003CI2G6S,"If there was ever a such a thing as an atheist saint, Hypatia would be it.  This movie is a dramatization of historical events. The city of Alexandria was a center for learning. It was said that the philosophical and religious discourse among the merchants and general population in the agora were on a very educated level, that which rivaled the scholars. With the onset of Christianity, the religious discussion changed. Religion was primarily based upon cosmic myths, most of which had lost their original meaning due to the Pythagorean concepts which fused with the old religion creating multiple paradoxes as to generate such debate. Is God anthropomorphic or is God light?

Hypatia was a scientist and philosopher, she is portrayed as an atheist in this film, although her religious belief is uncertain. She may very well had been a pagan. The menstrual cloth she presented to a would-be suitor is recorded in history. The movie is long and at times doesn't move along fast enough.  I thought it needed better editing.

Apart from the dramatization, the movie sticks to history. The documentary commentary writing on the screen is white on a predominately white background which made it difficult for me to read with old eyes and an analog TV. I had to pause it.

4109144,5,B003CI2G6S,"The movie Agora centres around of the great figures in the history- the female philosopher Hypatia of Alexandria.
The events of the movie take place from the years 391-415 CE, and show the rise of Christianity and the fall of the old religion of the Classical World, as well as the fall of science and reason.

Hypatia (Rachel Weisz) is a philosopher teaching science to both pagan and Christian students. She is particularly focused on one perplexing issue- the problems with Ptolemy's geocentric model of the solar system. One of her students, the future prefect Orestes (Oscar Isaac), proclaims his love for Hypatia but to his dismay she rejects him (which has much to do with the fact that her Classical Greek upbringing means she will lose her freedom if she gets married). Another who loves Hypatia is one of her family's slaves, Davus (Max Minghella), who converts to Christianity very early in the film.

Tension rises on the streets of Alexandria as Christians constantly provoke the pagans, eventually leading to the pagans starting a massive riot in the city, in an attempt to rid it of the offending Christians. The Christians, however, are too numerous to get rid of, and the pagans must barricade themselves within the Alexandria Serapeum. Rome's Christian emperor Theodosius sends a message to Alexandria that he will pardon the pagans, on the condition that they allow the Christians to enter the Serapeum and destroy its contents. This leads to the infamous destruction of the Serapeum's vast amounts of scientific and historical knowledge and to the banning of all pagan religious practices.

Years later, things only get worse as the monk-turned-bishop Cyril (Sami Samir) extends discrimination to not only pagans, but to Jews as well. When the murder of a group of Jews in a theatre goes unpunished by the Christian authorities, a group of Jews take the law into their own hands by killing some Christians. In retaliation, Christian mobs slaughter Jews in the streets, and the authorities do nothing to stop this.

As well as showing the increasing intolerance created by religious fundamentalist attitudes, another important part of the plot is Hypatia coming closer and closer to solving the riddles of planetary orbits, going from rejecting Ptolemy's geocentric model in favour of Aristarchus' heliocentric one, to eventually figuring out that orbits are not perfect circles. Her support of heliocentrism (considered blasphemous to the Church at the time) and her refusal to convert to Christianity brand her a heathen and a ""witch"", and her influence on the prefect Orestes brand her a threat, eventually leading to her death.

Overall, this was an excellently done movie. It was good to see a film that wasn't afraid to show historical Christian bigotry (as opposed to the usual portrayals of Christians holding some sort of moral high ground). Many Christians were apparently offended by the movie, but the fact of the matter is that Christian history is indeed very violent, and in any case the movie was criticising fundamentalism in general rather than any specific faith.
The characters are for the most part real historical figures, with some exceptions. The character of Davus is not a historical figure, but the way the movie is done makes this character fit into the plot quite well.
The film does take some liberties with historical accuracy. For instance, there is no evidence that Hypatia ever dabbled in helicentrism, let alone figured out that orbits were not perfect circles. However, seeing as very little remains of Hypatia's work, we can't rule out the possibility that she may well have made these discoveries but just never managed to publicise them. Also, Hypatia's death at the end of the film is portrayed as occurring by far less gruesome means than official accounts state (I won't give away the exact manner of her death in the film though, as I don't wish to spoil the ending for those who haven't seen the film).

Agora is a film I would recommend to anyone with an interest in history, especially the history of religion and the history of science.",1340409600,3,4102,5.007331378299121
4109145,4,B003CI2G6S,"Agora is a sweeping epic covering the fall of Alexandria and all it represents: religious freedom, women's rights, and critical thinking. At two hours long, it's an intriguing take on a pivotal moment in history that says as much about our modern society as it does about the past.

The film starts out with a God's-eye view of the world, slowly zooming in until we see it's 391 AD.  Greek Philosopher Hypatia (Rachel Weisz, revealing her full acting range here) teaches the future leaders of Rome at the Platonic school of Alexandria. Her father is the tolerant Theon (Michael Lonsdale) and director of the Musaeum of Alexandria. A love triangle of sorts swirls around Hypatia: Theon's slave Davus (Max Minghella) whom she could never love due to his social status and one of her pupils Orestes (Oscar Isaac) whom she doesn't love because of his inevitable dominance as her husband. This delicate balance of learning and freedom is not to last.

Christianity is on the rise in Rome and the Library of the Serapeum becomes a symbolic representation of all things pagan. When a conflict over the worship of the gods turns violent, a full-blown riot causes the pagans to retreat to the Library.  The Christian Emperor eventually settles the conflict by allowing the pagans to escape with their lives, leaving the library to the Christians. End of Act One.

Act Two picks up years later.  Many of Hypatia's students have gone on to become leaders of Rome. Orestes, still in love with her, is a prefect of Alexandria. Synesius (Rupert Evans), another former pupil, is now the Bishop of Cyrene. Davus has been freed and joined the Christians extremists. Hypatia has been toiling diligently away at developing a heliocentric model of the solar system and elliptical orbits of the planets. But the Christian leader Cyril (Sami Samir) is not content with just expelling the pagans.  The Jews are at risk too, and it's not long before a similar conflict erupts in the streets.

It's clear the Christians are ascending in power, leaving civil authorities at risk of losing their secular objectivity.  Cyril uses Orestes' affection for Hypatia to attack his authority.  If Hypatia will not convert, the Christian mobs will kill her; if she does convert to Christianity, Cyril's authority over the city is complete. Orestes refuses to force the issue publicly but pleads with her in private to convert.  For those viewers who know their history, Hypatia is already doomed.  It is just a question of who will stand by her in the end.

Agora occasionally reaches to connect with a modern audience beyond what history has told us - director Alejandro Amenabar heaps scientific theories in her lap so that we can understand just how much was lost. The inverted roles of fanatical extremism and the literal interpretation of scriptures is likely to be a sore point with some, but Agora makes a compelling case: Hypatia WAS killed by a Christian mob for being a witch.

Unfortunately the film drags as it slowly unspools an inevitable downward spiral of learning, freedom, and human decency. As a history lesson it's thought-provoking and more than a little controversial.  As a film, it's about twenty minutes too long.",1338940800,2,3202,4.925650557620818

She was a highly respected philosopher, mathematician and teacher. The 2010 Seattle Film Festival audience, sitting smugly in possession of 20/20 hindsight, smile as she struggles to ascertain if Earth is round, is the universe heliocentric and what the devil is gravity? Her experiments are creative and interesting.

We see the brutal persecution of early Christians in Roman Egypt. Then, when the Roman Emperor converts and the Christians prevail, their enthusiastic persecution of the Jews. After the Jews are driven from Alexandria, the Christians quickly turn on the pagans and continue their blood-letting. Religious fervor is NOT pretty!

Hypatia, played by Rachel Weisz (""The Lovely Bones""), is the central character, but her slave Davus, later freed, has the most interesting story arc. As depicted by Max Minghella (""Art School Confidential""), Davus evolves from callow youth with a crush on his mistress, to smoldering adulthood, still in love with her. Oh yeah...and a pretty good Prefect, as played by Oscar Isaac (Prince John in the latest ""Robin Hood"").

Of course we might expect lots of Computer Generated Imaging, swordplay, floggings and incinerations (as we already know, the library at Alexandria is burned for containing heresy), plus a few bits of artistic license.

4109151,2,B003CI2G6S,"Hollywood has a long history of misrepresenting historical events -- altering timelines and characters, changing motivations, and injecting an alarming amount of anti-Christian prejudice. Agora is no different, a film that approaches a fascinating historical figure without a shred of respect for what actually happened.

The Library of Alexandria holds the most precious philosophical works in the world, and among its many admirers and protectors is the beautiful philosopher Hypatia (Rachel Weisz). A student of progressive thought, an instructor in philosophy and science, and obsessed with circles and their relation to the movement of the earth, Hypatia is much loved by her students and colleagues alike. One of her most ardent admirers is Orestes (Oscar Isaac), who hopes to inspire her to marry him -- but in doing so she would lose her independence and fall beneath his influence, meaning she would be forced to fall silent and no longer teach. Hypatia is convinced he does not love her for her mind as much as for her body and rejects him, not realizing as she does so that her world is about to be torn apart. Christianity has spread throughout Alexandria now that it is no longer illegal and in the wake of slaughtering Christians defacing Pagan statues in the central square, a mob descends upon the great Library with the intention of burning its contents.

Caught up in the midst of this religious fervor is Hypatia's slave Davus (Max Minghella), who is also in love with her -- but cannot tell her as much, for it is forbidden and inappropriate. A Pagan who has converted recently to the new faith, Davus abandons her and joins the mob, finding his calling while at the same time questioning the motives of the Christians that surround him. In later years, the violence between the Pagans and Christians and also the Jews will escalate into inescapable pandemonium, resulting in a bloodbath. Where the film succeeds is in the strength of its characters -- each of them are interesting and likable in some sense, even though some make poor decisions. Our heart goes out to Davus when he offers to take a flogging for a female servant who admits to professing the Christian faith. He is not religious then, but becomes more so later on. Hypatia is a spunky heroine and in some sense easy to identify with, both in her yearning to discover truth and her resistance toward submitting to the men around her. Orestes appears at first to be something of a jerk but eventually we discover that his love for her is genuine -- and he risks his life in defending her honor. Another figure, this one first a student and then later a Bishop in the Church, comes across as adhering to the teachings of Christ at least -- compassionate, forgiving, and respectful to Hypatia.

On a purely cinematic level this film works in a lot of ways and fails in others -- minor characters are not well developed and many of them look so much alike that for awhile I didn't know who anyone was; the story likewise seems to have no internal focus, since it cannot decide what its story is really about -- or what it wants to say about its characters. It is part romance (that never goes anywhere), part historical fiction (rather than fact), part adventure, and partly a push for science and philosophy while at the same time denouncing religion. Its underlining message is that philosophy unites and inspires whereas faith divides and incites violence. Furthermore, it throws Christians to the forefront of controversy and depicts them poorly, while disregarding the actual historical events. In the film, they intend to burn the library, presumably to put a stop to free thought and philosophy -- in reality, the Library of Alexandria did not exist in that time period; it had fallen into disrepair and been destroyed years earlier. In its place was a Pagan temple that a Christian mob sacked in return for their Churches having been defaced by Pagans.

The film paints Hypatia as an atheist or agnostic, her fundamental faith only in philosophy -- in truth, she was a Pagan. It misrepresents her friendship with a Bishop -- implying he abandons and speaks ill of her, when in reality she ceased corresponding with him and never told him why, although he continued to speak highly of her and admire her tremendous mind. It also claims her death was religious, when in fact it had everything to do with politics. The director makes very conscious decisions to imply that Christians of Alexandria were actually comparable to the Nazis.

The costumes and acting are without a doubt marvelous, but that it so deliberately maligns the facts in an attempt to misrepresent actual events and place blame where it is unwarranted displeases me very much -- and I am not the only one to be offended by it, as various atheists have also proclaimed their disappointment as well.",1332374400,9,4855,4.830528846153846
4109152,4,B003CI2G6S,"SPOILER ALERT! I find it particularly disturbing that the unjust demise of Hypatia at the hands of an angry mob of Christians took place during Lent of 415 A.D.!

And to anyone who wants a crash course on the differences between the teachings OF Jesus and the teachings ABOUT Jesus, there is always the distant echo of Hypatia's screams to cut through the clouds of chaos as just one of many examples that emerges through the thread of time and the needle of space to remind us how differently Jesus would have reacted to Hypatia and the angry mob compared to the worst of what can happen when the name of Jesus becomes merely an outside thing worn like a fancy logo on a uniform for a local sports team.

Whether based on the 77 Urantia Papers devoted exclusively to the unabridged version of Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Jesus or the Bible's Gospel accounts, the Jesus I know would have undoubtedly rescued Hypatia from this dire situation had He been incarnated on the temporal stage of tragedy depicted in this film where all tangible traces of her slaughtered innocence slowly slipped away from her mutilated femininity with the final few breaths that passed across her fading lips into the winter darkness of a silent abyss. How quickly Hypatia would have embraced Jesus and become a true believer had His facial expression of unconditional love been the last image she saw at the very end of her mortal journey.

If the eyes are the windows to the Soul, then just imagine how Light from Paradise reflected through the eyes of Jesus could have reduced that crime scene to a tiny speck of cosmic dust.",1332115200,3,2003,4.76657060518732
4109153,4,B003CI2G6S,"The film depicts Roman Egypt in late antiquity and tries to tackle all of the most important developments in that era: the collapse of decadent Pagan society, the growing and unsustainable inequality between the rich and poor, the rise of Christianity, the rejection of religious pluralism, the decay of the Roman Empire, and the decline of Greco-Roman science and learning. Obviously it would be a miracle that any 2 hour film could tackle so many topics succesfully without employing cheesy dialogue so I knew this film would be cheesy before I watched it and it certainly was.

On the plus side the film does an incredible job of depicting the various competing factions in a fair light. Both the Christians and the Pagans are depicted with their merits and flaws. The viewer gets a real glympse of how so many people became attracted to Christianity amongst the back-drop of the decadent Pagan society. The Christians are shown as just as zealous in their destruction of learning and science as they are in ridding the city of hunger and disease, whilst the Pagans are shown as obsessed with pursuing pleasure of the body and mind and having no regard for the poor or their slaves.

The film is incredibly careful with facts which is quite rare in the genre of historical epics. It is careful in that it does not show St. Cyril as directly responsible for the murder of Hypatia though a connection can be inferred. It also clearly explains that Hypatia's writings are lost so that we can only speculate on what exactly she wrote about. Every scene has been carefully weighed to insure historical accuracy for the sacrifice of entertainment. Thus there is a scene in the film where Hypatia's father discusses his daughter with other elder men as not a typical ""woman"" who will never marry a man and lead the normal life of a woman. The only reason this scene is included in the film is to insure that the viewer is not led into thinking that Pagan society was inclusive of women in the academic field and that Hypatia was the exception rather than the rule. The scene is educational but does nothing to add to it's entertainment value.

In summary the film is incredibly cheesy and not very entertaining but as an educational tool it gets 5 stars. I would recommend it to any teacher or parent for shedding light on an era all too often ignored by both Hollywood and the Western school system. To anybody who has never heard of Hypatia or has little knowledge of how and why Paganism was replaced by Christianity this film is also a great launching pad for further research.",1326758400,3,2577,4.684326710816777
4109154,4,B003CI2G6S,"This film does take liberty with the historical record.  It's tempting to imagine the burning of the library and the lynching of Hypatia as the culture performing an intellectual suicide, moving the world from the wisdom of antiquity to the fear and ignorance of the dark ages, not to be dispelled until the Renaissance.  In one of his books, Carl Sagan described it in just this way.  It would seem that the library was so monumental as to require a cataclysmic explanation for its disappearance.

The first accusation, barely remembered now, was to blame Julius Caesar for burning the library.  Apparently Caesar was trapped in Alexandria, and fired the harbor to excape, resulting in the accidental burning of a few books when the flames spread.  But the library obviously was still around for centuries after this.

There is also no evidence that the early Christians burned the library, either, as evidence clearly shows many books surviving after this period as well.  What happened is that as tastes and interests changed, many of the works considered ""pagan"" were deemed not worth the effort of copying, so as the ink faded and the papyrus disintegrated, these works were lost.  Later, when Alexandria was under Moslem control, the Christian works suffered the same fate, with the result that the library gradually succumbed to the ravages of time, its contents gradually disappearing.  Yet many works did survive, there and in other places, in copies and translations by Christian and Moslem scholars.  If they had not, the Renaissance itself - a rediscovery and reapplication of the art and science of antiquity - may never have happened.

The film's ending seems to imply that had Hypatia been allowed to live and continue her work, science would have been advanced 1,200 years, and the so-called ""Dark Ages"" (more properly, the Early Middle Ages) might possibly have been avoided.  I have wondered the same thing about Archimedes, who was reportedly on the verge of discovering Calculus when he was mistakenly killed by a soldier who was only supposed to capture him.  Had he been allowed to live, maybe we would already be in the world of Star Trek by now.  This thinking suggests that history is advanced by intelligent, powerful, or charismatic individuals with big ideas.

We tend to accept this explanation because history does seem to be advanced by such individuals, who tend to take center stage.  After all, if George Washington and King George III had never lived, would the United States still be a colony of Great Britain today?  But this ignores the zeitgeist, where the masses of a particular time make a collective decision to move in a certain direction.  In Hypatia's time, her brand of inquiry was on the wane - it had no place in the new society that was developing, where knowledge was based on personal revelation rather than objective observation.  Even if she had survived and published her supposed discoveries, they really would have been a thousand years ahead of their time.  There was no audience for them, in other words, so they would have been ignored, or at best a mere curiosity.  And one benefit of this is that atomic weapons were developed in the 1940s, not the 740s.

Science is not a disparate collection of facts - it is more like a jigsaw puzzle.  New pieces must fit into the existing ones, which can be modified or even discarded, but the entire picture is difficult to erase.  This may be why research into psychic phenomena seems so crackpot - it doesn't fit into the existing paradigm.  It may also be why great discoveries are sometimes made by completely separate and disconnected people at the same time - they are not sui generis, but are logical developments of the current scientific culture.  Hypatia's ""discoveries"" in this film were not the beginning of anything; they were the tail end.  It is fun to speculate, ""what would have happened, if...""  But we would still be in the same place we are now.

i researched and found that the french warner bros. blu-ray version of this movie is closest to the english version presented in this DVD, it is full english TrueHD audio as well as 1080p video and english text displayed throughout sections of the film. i bought it from amazon.fr.

concerning the movie itself, it is a very well made film that i enjoyed. the story and cinematography are done quite well, the acting is very good, you will not find a single scene in the film that is pointless or just there for filler. the props and settings of the film were believable and authentic looking, i like how the director used a zoom in/out from scenes on the surface to being out in space looking at the earth, while also fading audio in/out of these transitions nicely.

it's really a shame this movie hasn't been presented in the US on blu-ray, it is an incredible story and a superbly done film. not like much of the fictitious hollywood garbage that's been eroding the minds of movie-goers over the past several years.

the blu-ray transfer of this movie is stunning: color, lighting, details, audio are all right on the money. blu-ray.com reviewed this release and rated it nearly at the top, 4.5 out of 5. not many blu-ray transfers are rated that good for overall quality and reproduction of the film onto blu-ray format.

4109159,5,B003CI2G6S,"Set in the 4th century city of Alexandria, in the Roman Empire just before its split in to two separate Empires. The narrative revolves around the Greek philosopher Hypatia (a teacher at the Platonic school) where the future elite are educated. Her story is told against the back ground of a Roman Empire running out of `steam', and is turning rapidly from Paganism to the early form of Christianity .The metamorphosis of the relatively new religion is neither pain less or consequence free. Religious tolerance seems non-existent, from this new faith. In turn the Pagans either convert on mass and the few who remain try to keep a low profile. The Christians then turn their attention to the Jews, and soon they come into conflict, committing violent acts against each other. The majority soon prevail, with the Christians ultimately wresting power from the only other religious group remaining. During this time of change - which at times are punctuated by a years of peace our philosopher Hypatia, continues with her single minded quest for knowledge. However, her study of heliocentrism, is not permitted by the new faith and soon she has to focus on working privately on her theories and experiments.

Heliocentrism is the study of `astronomical model' in which the Earth and planets revolve around a stationary Sun at the centre of the solar system. This type of study was at odds with the accepted theory that all heavenly bodies, including the Sun, revolved around the Earth, the Earth was the centre of all things. While film is based on key main events in the Historical record, the narrative, the characterizations are fictional. The colour and iconography are rich and sumptuous, and remind me of such classic films as Ben-Hur or the Ten Commandments.

This review does not wish to give away plot themes and the narrative that encompasses this rather fictionalized view of a rather extraordinary person who was ahead of her time by nearly 500 years plus, both as an accomplished scientist and women who was not abashed in speaking her mind in the company of men, these men being the elite of Alexandria in their own home patch. This then brings Hypatia into conflict as it is believed that she is the cause of strained relations between Orestes (a former pupil who loves her and values her intellect), the Imperial Roman Prefect, and the Patriarch Cyril, thus she attracted the hatred of the Christians of Alexandria, who wanted the politician and the priest to reconcile. One day, in March AD 415, during Lent, a Christian mob of Nitrian monks, way lay, attack and finally kill what they perceive is a Witch of the worst kind.

I do not believe this film is anti Christian and for that matter nor is it anti religion. As one reviewer has puts it, the film is about `fanaticism and unreason'. Well I see the threads here that may lead to this inclination. However, for me I felt it was more about power play and influence, the religious conflict etc are the tools of the conflict, at the end of the day it was about power and who has it. The same is true in today's world. That said it's a film worth seeing, a beautiful but sad story worth 5 stars",1320710400,2,3160,4.731397459165154
4109160,5,B003CI2G6S,"This version of the Hypatia story isn't historically accurate in some respects, but it quite accurately displays the horror of Christianity during the 5th century, the legacy of Diocletian, eagerly adopted by the brutal 'catholic' brand of Christian apostasy which, after fighting with other Christians for three centuries, finally got control via Constantine, in the fourth.  It is a very hard movie to watch.  We have a sordid and disgusting history, yet claim as ""Lord"", someone who DIED rather than be brutal to others.  Thus we spit on His Name.

The plot is based on history.  Problem is, the movie adds subplots of romance which are not true.  Basically, a pagan woman mathematician and philosopher who defended freedom of faith, ends up brutally raped and murdered by monks.  The movie version does not accurately portray her age when it happens (she was elderly), nor the monks who did it, probably to avoid ratings problems.  But it does nonetheless, in Cecille B. DeMille style, show the crowd frenzy.  Christians, egged on by a maniacal leader, just as much a mob as the one storming in the French or Russian or Chinese revolutions.  Shame on us.

Our 'Church Fathers' were absolute JERKS.  And if you read what they write, you'll see that, soon enough.  They whitewashed our evil past, and persecuted anyone who properly wrote about it, with the result that we have NO idea what the Bible really says, or what our history, really was.  This movie, therefore, will likely be denounced by some, thinking it is anti-Christian.  No, it's pro-Christian, for the real Christian would never have engaged in that sordid past.  Some of the subplot elements do show this fact (I don't want to give away any details).  The dilemma of being a Christian yet giving into a crowd ABUSING the Bible, in the name of Christ!  That was our history, and it ought to be admitted.  But it has not been. Since those responsible, laud the disgusting 'church fathers' who were unabashedly apostate, anti-semitic, power-mad and just plain wacko.

So all of us Christians need to see this movie.  It captures the time, well.  Constantine and his ilk were pawns of the evil that began in 96AD and has continued ever since.  The production is lavish, in Biblical style, and everyone associated with this movie should get a million dollar reward for the courage to make it.

I am a Christian.  I make exegetical videos in Youtube, 'brainouty' channel, showing how Paul predicted this apostasy year by year, starting when Christ would have been age 56, in his meter of Ephesians 1:3-14.  So you see the brutal history plotted out in a kind of satire, showing how God's Plan will be achieved DESPITE our tawdry fake faith.  Extensive links to internet scholarly sources of the time are in the 'Chrono Chart' showing Paul's satire syllable (year) by syllable, at [...] .  I'm currently making videos to demonstrate how Paul's satire, works.  Will take well over a year to finish making them.",1320364800,5,2971,4.850894632206759
4109161,4,B003CI2G6S,"These facts about Hypatia are true: she was a brilliant astronomer, a mathematician, philosopher, scholar, and atheist, who studied the cosmos and charted planetoids, invented the graduated hydrometer, the plane astrolabe, and the hydroscope. We would all have learned about her in school, just as students have been taught about Plato, Socrates, Copernicus, and Kepler, EXCEPT that she was female and relegated to the dustbins of history -- and as a fiercely independent and intellectual woman she became the target of weak and philistine men who feared her influence and genius. And as an uppity woman she became a victim of the hatred towards free thinking and self-governing women that lay at the heart of Middle Eastern-based religions of her time (Islam the only one left that continues to recoil from and revile the notion.) Her death was at the hands of Christians, probably fanatical monks, who intercepted her on the road while returning to Alexandria from a trip, they dragged her to a church, stoned her to death, flayed her with shards of pottery and tile, dragged her carcass through the streets of Alexandria, cut her up, then burned her remains. They also destroyed all her works that they could get their hands on -- it wasn't enough to murder her, she had to be annihilated. What we know today about her, and her fate, is based on letters and memoirs of her contemporaries. This film is fact-based entertainment, after all, and takes liberties with alleged relationships with former students and slaves; and in an era of few or no budgets for grand-scale historical movies with huge casts and lushness of scope, Agora manages to make computer-generated backgrounds, settings, and crowds believable. It also offers a small lesson in the turbulent and brutal early stages of Christianity, when those who began their history as abused, hunted, and executed believers, gradually became the abusers, hunters, and executioners of other beliefs.",1319068800,3,1956,5.115625

Christianity was a religious upstart in the 5th century. Imagine the religious zealots of our day: the end justifies the mean; Machiavelli never said a more crystalline clear phrase. And, so, it is in Agora, the religious zealots are set against reason in the guise of Hypatia. The collapsing world of Rome is divided between true-believers, appeasers and philosophers. Have times really changed that much? Or, is it that the human mind, limited in its capacity, is doomed to repeat mistakes?

4109166,5,B003CI2G6S,"Historical epics about the Roman Empire tend to fall into 3 categories.  First are the grand action flicks featuring some sort of power struggle atop the empire as the context of the personal dramas.  These films include Cleopatra, Gladiator, and Spartacus.  Then there are the movies that take place at the peripheries of the empire, and usually involve wild tribes, foreign powers, and long dangerous hikes through forests.  Examples of this sub-genre include Last Legion, The Eagle, King Arthur, and Centurion.  The third category, and the most rare, are films that examine the transformation of the people and culture within the Empire, usually by religion.  The best-known example is probably Ben-Hur, which at heart, is an examination of the Jewish experience within the Empire.  Now we have Agora, which looks at the rise of Christianity within the Empire, and how it supplants both the older pagan beliefs, and its predecessor Jewish faith.  Within this context is the story of Hypatia, one of the most notable female philosophers with the ancient world.  This movie recreates her life and intellectual pursuits, which she can pursue due to her aristocratic and privileged life, and shows how it is drowned out by growing Christian faith, a faith built on those excluded from the aristocracy and privilege.  This movie, probably better than any other I have ever seen, shows how the Dark Ages came about as a direct result of the structure of the Roman empire.

4109174,5,B003CI2G6S,"I absolutely loved this movie - prior to watching it (and doing a little research of my own about Hypatia)I had only briefly heard about Hypatia. After watching the movie I got so fascinated with the time period that I ended up ordering a book abot Neoplatonism to learn more about the philosophical and mystical ideas that she must have grown up and been educated with. A female scholar in 4th century Alexandria, she lived at the end of era - the end of the pagan world and the beginning of the christian era. While I am certain that in any movie there must be certain artistic liberties taken (for example, it seems that Hypatia was actually much older when she died than is depicted in the movie), the story is movingly told, brilliantly acted, and the sets are just amazing. But most of all, this movie sheds light on a little known figure in history, her life and accomplishments as well as tragic death. It also brings back to awareness the tragic final destruction of the remnants of the ancient library of Alexandria. What knowledge has been lost there is inconceivable (originally the library housed about 1/2 million volumes of books, of which only a small fraction has been saved), and it was lost due to human ingnorance and intolerance. The lessons that derive from her story can well be applied today, as once again we have to remind ourselves that - as exactly the Platonists believed - it is education that is crucial to eradicate hatred and intolerance.

4109176,2,B003CI2G6S,"`Agora' is one of those films that tries to do so much and yet fails miserably to do much of anything.  It is essentially two stories running perpendicular that are supposed to become interwoven and yet neither story really feels whole and one aspect of the film feels like a poorly conceived side-plot that never gets the attention it deserved, for it was probably the film's more interesting feature.

Taking place in Roman occupied Egypt, `Agora' tells the story of religious unrest amongst the turn of Christianity and the displaced values of the pagan populous.  With so many turning to Christianity, the ideals of those with `other' ways of thinking (or believing) become distained and despised, and effectively illegal.  Spanning a breadth of time, `Agora' begins by following a young slave named Davus who has fallen in love with a female philosopher, Hypatia, during the birthing pains of Christianity.  His feelings continue with him, even after he converts to Christianity and violently takes his freedom.  As the years progress, the tension between religious factions grows and soon Hypatia herself is being questioned and condemned despite her prestigious connections.

The violence contained within `Agora' is not merely that of a physical nature, but the film's core themes and mood created reek of aggression.  This is one of the film's commendable traits, for it understands the mood it is trying to convey and it does so expertly.  I also loved the production design here, because it was so crisp and so clean, depicting the religious `purity' being toted and yet it always appeared so dirty, so dusty; great way to contrast their values with their actions.

But that is about all I have for praise.

The astrology aspect of the film could have lent itself in a more eventful manner, but the film tries to be almost too realistic for its own good and it loses any true grandeur.  The religious side of things can become hammy and overly theatrical, and while I understand that that is much the way of these `swords and sandals' epics, there is something about `Agora' that feels so; un-epic.  The acting is hit and miss, with Rachel Weisz delivering one of her most boring performances to date (where is the depth).  She has two scenes where she shines, and both involve a form of violation that attacks her emotions.  Max Minghella gives a standard (expected) performance, but his final scene (thanks to some heavy cinematic manipulations) is very effective.  The real flaws here are seen in the way that director Alejandro Amenabar painted his canvas.  The film just feels so underwhelming.  Amenabar tries to give provocative moments, but most of his directorial flourishes come across unnecessary.  The scroll throwing sequence in particular is a ridiculous use of CGI and takes away from what could have been a signature scene in the film (for the upside down ending shot was surprisingly superb).  Juggling the two focuses was not done well, and the astrology section underperforms and becomes pointless (unless you want to say it was there for authentic merit), a waste of time and essentially takes you out of the film.  Had Amenabar woven in a supernatural currency, then maybe that aspect of the film would have proved substantial, but in the end it is just a wasted focal point.  At times the film feels like a television production (think HBO's `Rome' or something of that nature) and at other times it feels like a halfhearted video game (that upwards glance at Davus's bloodstained sword and the ominous hoodies read video game to a T).

It just doesn't come together like it was supposed to and winds up being yet another attempt to capitalize on a genre that ended when Russell Crowe's hand swept the glistening fields of wheat for the very last time.",1307404800,5,3785,4.9073783359497645

On the contrary, if you adhere to Hollywood's amoral anything-goes platitudes, you belong among the wise, learned, tolerant and heroic. Not to mention young and beautiful.

Yeah, sure..!

For the record, no direct evidence relates Hypatia's death to either religious dogma or Cyril in particular. It is mostly agreed she died an old woman murdered in a political riot among Christian sects. No actual writings of her own remain, although she is credited with inventing the hydrometer. Her astronomical achievements are unknown, but to claim that she surpassed Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler is mere preposterous hogwash. So is the film's portrayal of Roman society as a tolerant agora of gender, race and creed tolerance, or Ancient Alexandria being a city built in Pharaonic architecture. It's like imagining XX Century Manhattan as a metropolis of tepees! As for Christian obtuseness -the movie's bottom line- St. Augustine (Hypatia's contemporary) believed time was born along with space, and Thomas Aquinas believed all natural knowledge should engage both mathematics and experimentation. Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler and Newton were devoted Christians, formed, shaped, and trained by Christian Universities. In fact, everything we know about the ancients we owe to the thousands of unknown Christian scholars that salvaged, preserved, copied and divulged their knowledge! Mr Amenbar, on the other hand, is a product of the hate-mongering Spanish Left that burned churches, killed priests, raped nuns much in the same fashion his movie depicts, only those atrocities were committed only 80 years ago.

4109181,5,B003CI2G6S,"Agora is an intelligently beautiful movie of historical fiction demonstrating the clash of three distinct cultures battling for control and influence in the 4th century city of Alexandria in Roman-controlled Egypt.  The Jews, long removed from their slave history, are generally portrayed as rich and influential merchants of the period, though they play a minor role in the movie.  The Pagans, a polytheistic culture grounded in philosophy, mathematics and observational science to seek divine comprehension play a dominant role.  The Christians of the time are acknowledged as the hopeless seeking hope and they are shown as the emerging influence.  As the three cultures of wealth, knowledge and hope converge, the winner will be rewarded with both political and legal control of the people's hearts, minds, and pocketbooks.  It should be no surprise or movie spoiler to anyone who has studied history to watch the Christians win the battle in the movie.

Agora impressively demostrates the science and mathematics of the 4th century, encapsulating the Pagan knowledge in Hypatia, a real-life philosopher, mathematician, and astronomer of the time.  Anyone who has studied the history of astronomy will appreciate the detail to which ancient beliefs were demonstrated by Hypatia in the movie.

Finally, anyone who has studied Christian church history will recognize some cultural details of the origins of the modern Christian church, especially Catholicism.

There was only one significant historical inaccuracy that I noted, and that was the manner of Hypatia's murder. The movie sanitized it by having the fanatics stone her already dead body. In fact, the historical record is that they dragged her from her chariot into the street and flayed her alive with clam shells, tearing her skin from her body. This at the order of Cyril, bishop of Alexandria, who was later canonized by the Catholic Church as a saint.

4109184,4,B003CI2G6S,"AGORA is a strange film one that attempts to explore the history of changing philosophies in Egypt during Roman occupation while attempting to present a biography of the great Egyptian astronomer Hypatia, probably one of the first great women of science.  It succeeds on spectacle but stumbles a bit on chronology and script.  Written by Mateo Gil and Writer/Director Chilean born Alejandro Amenbar (honored for 'the Sea Inside' with Javier Bardem, 'The Others', 'Open Your Eyes', etc), and populated with a handsome and smart cast, the film succeed on many levels and frustrates on others.

Set in Alexandria, Egypt in the year 391AD, Hypatia (Rachel Weisz) teaches her students in philosophy, mathematics and astronomy: her rapt students include Orestes (Oscar David), Theon (Rupert Evans) and Hypatia's loyal and adoring slave Davus (Max Minghella).  Alexandria is in the throes of upheaval as the ancient culture becomes challenged by Christians who gradually gain influence and power in the city, eventually leading to hostilities with the Jews and with women who are not Christians.  By the end of the film Hypatia has remained a scientist and philosopher, concerned about the movement of the planets and the need for unifying all men in a universal brotherhood and is uninfluenced by the current religions and is condemned to being stoned to death, but an act of real love prevents the agony of the end of Hypatia: her benevolent freeing of her slave, the loving Davus, provides an ending that is bearable.

The sets and costumes are dramatically beautiful and the moments when the film concentrates on individual character development instead of focusing on fights and brawls it is quite successful.  The long film simply sinks under its own weight despite the radiant Rachel Weisz' performance as the brilliant and enlightened philosopher and astronomer.

This film is a slander of St. Cyril of Alexandria, a Father of the Church and acknowledged as such by Catholics, Orthodox, and Coptic Christians. In his time, the Jews were much more powerful and wealthy than the generally poor Christians and had more of an in with the civil authorities. They organized persecutions and pogroms against the Christians of Alexandria. Cyril the Bishop spoke against such behavior, but he never advocated pogroms against the Jews. He did preach against what the Jews were doing to the Christians. But this was defensive rather than offensive. Slowly the Christian faith became the faith of most of the inhabitants of Alexandria. The Jews continued to invoke the power of the state against the Christians. Finally, they were ordered to leave Alexandria by the prefect, who had himself become a convert to Christianity. I frequently attend Mass at St. Cyril of Alexandria Church in Houston and plan to continue to do so. Sorry to bring up the truth, which may offend some Jews including Ms. Weisz.

4109187,2,B003CI2G6S,"Alejandro Amenabar's Agora is a classic example of Litmus test cinema. If you're an atheist, its unchallenging affirmation of your non-belief will probably endear it to you mightily and guarantee you'll give this review a 'not useful' vote without reading further. If you're a Christian, the film's unequivocal belief that your faith is not only destructive and irrational but the root of all evil and ignorance for the past 1500 years will make you hate it and give this review a 'useful' vote without reading further. If you're an agnostic or simply objective, you'll just wonder not only why it's all so simplistic and ineffectual but also so remarkably dull with it. Because for all the cries of brilliance from one school of thought and damnation from the other, Agora is nothing more than a technically impressive but emotionally unengaging Christians versus pagans epic that aspires to be a thoughtful allegory of scientific inquiry versus religious fundamentalism but instead tends to be very vague and confused when it comes to religion, which is a real problem considering the subject matter, and increasingly dull, which is an even bigger problem.

It does offer novelty value in reversing the traditional Biblical epic and having Christians metaphorically throwing pagans and Jews to the lions with sadistic abandon in 4th Century AD Alexandria as the Roman Empire starts to fall to pieces, but it's all a little half-baked and woolly-headed to pass muster as a thinking man or woman's epic and too relentlessly so-so to work as entertainment.

Stuck in the middle and supposedly standing for reason is the idealised figure of Hypatia (Rachel Weisz, the actress you call when Kate Winslett is busy), a philosopher-astronomer-teacher whose words of wisdom fall on increasingly deaf ears because, as a woman, she's despised by the bloodthirsty radical Christians and, as an atheist, is regarded as unsuitable for public office by the pagans (well, at least in the cut that premiered at Cannes in 2009, though that scene is notably missing from the shorter version that was eventually released to theatres).

Although the film doesn't try to entirely impose 20th century values on its rather one-dimensional heroine - she takes slavery for granted and the science is appropriately 2000 years out of date - it does have a rather confused attitude to what she stands for and why we should admire her. She espouses brotherhood but has no empathy, responds to shows of affection with humiliation, uses others merely as a sounding board for her own brilliance while ironically, and presumably unintentionally, being portrayed as something of a second-rate thinker. With her actual works long destroyed (by Muslims rather than Christians a couple of centuries after the events in the film), her quest to unravel if or how the Earth orbits around the sun may even be a misrepresentation of her work in an attempt to present her as an earlier Galileo and further the myth that science and religion are completely incompatible. The film certainly misrepresents her as an atheist when it seems she was a pagan to simplify the story's central conflict into one of empirical evidence versus blind faith - having her worship graven images might have taken some of the shine off her credibility for modern audiences, and it would never do to have a flawed heroine.

Instead, it paints her as an atheist Christ dying for the sins of Deists, and one whose wisdom all reasonable men (there are no other female characters) bow before. And how ""How nave I was. How nave I was,"" laments one former suitor-turned-prefect when she points out the errors in his let-the-Christians-kill-the-Jews-and-that'll-be-an-end-to-it policy. Even her father's final scene is an ""I should have listened to you"" mea culpa after his ill-advised response to a Christian act of provocation results in the besieging of the Alexandria Library. If only they'd have listened to her, the film seems to be saying, all of this could have been avoided.

It's a role and a film that desperately needs an exceptionally charismatic and inspiring star performance to compensate for the many flaws, but it doesn't get it. With little real dramatic meat to work with, Weisz generally chooses to play the part by alternating between two expressions, her serious look and the head girl enthusiastically giving the school lecture on prize day, and a two-note performance in a one-dimensional role that never develops makes her a weak centre for the film to revolve around (Amenabar is big on revolutions and circles in the film's visual scheme). We're only introduced to her emotional dilemma - that to give herself to a man means the loss of her freedom to think and to teach - through her father (Michel Lonsdale), and it really doesn't seem to bother her until one brief scene near the film's end. She's far too in love with her own intellect and the heavenly spheres.

Unfortunately her character seems to be made all the weaker by the one-note villainy the film extends to the evil kill-crazy Christians. Ideologically and spiritually these black-clad crazies stand for nothing - they could just as well be Indians or Zulus or insects from Starship Troopers (and boy, does Amenabar love his sped-up aerial shots making them look like busy ants). They're simply empty-headed black-hearted villains out to kill everyone, with Saint Cyril portrayed as such a Satanic figure that all that's missing is the forked tail and pitchfork. Even a Christian lifelong friend and devotee like Synsesius is inaccurately turned into an enemy opposing her ideas or right to offer counsel to men. It's those kind of broad brushstrokes and lack of historical context that perhaps hurts the film the most, with the film offering no idea of how an empire that had previously been tolerant of most religions changed so violently any more than it shows how a religion built on turning the other cheek and forgiving your enemies became so violently militant as it abandoned pacifism with a vengeance once it became Romanised. One early scene does briefly address the appeal Christianity had to the poor and the under class - a religion that you didn't have to be born into, that favored the weak over the powerful and which found joy in giving rather than receiving - but it's a brief moment that's never pursued in the final cut. Instead it's a conflict between the nasty black togas and the good white togas, with little explanation of what either faction really stands for. Only in the final scenes does it threaten to address the conflict between constantly questioning science and unquestioning religion, by which time it's too late to summon up much interest.

(The longer version that premiered at Cannes in 2009 to such a poor response was a little bit more balanced: you saw the Parabalanos acting as intermediaries in street disputes, feeding the poor and burying the dead rather than just acting like Christ's stormtroopers, the Christians were themselves more firmly divided into two opposing camps, the pagans more aware of the coming storm and, crucially, Max Minghella's slave was seen as being as interested in being seen as an equal of his mistress as her lover, if not more. Unfortunately none of those scenes - included on the Spanish DVD and BluRay - were enough to add more than the most superficial of window dressing to the film.)

The digitally recreated Alexandria and the massive sets filled with thousands of extras are often impressive even if used more as scenery and the occasional battleground than a centre point for the film, and after the first half the film conveys no sense of the world around its few characters. It doesn't help that these characters seem to be made out of cardboard, not least the men who are either weak-willed or evil, a problem magnified by a number of poor performances from some weak actors. Max Minghella's once-loyal slave briefly threatens to become more interesting than his dull performance as he realises that he has no value to Hypatia beyond what practical use she can make of him, but that simply manifests itself as turning in a Christian-Bale-in-a-bit-of-a-moody impersonation as he becomes a Christian stormtrooper on gaining his freedom. Oscar Isaac's performance as the equally ineffectual suitor and prefect seems to be driven by thoughts of what Rufus Sewell would do in his place and Rupert Evans' Bishop Synesius cuts a particularly pitifully unconvincing figure. Only Ashraf Barhom's Christian martyr offers a genuinely charismatic performance as a man whose joyous belief exceeds his understanding and leads him to do terrible things in the name of divine love. As for the other female characters - there aren't any. Weisz and the odd extra with a non-speaking walk-on in the odd street scene is yer lot.

Even as a purely visceral spectacle, the film feels curiously soft even in the midst of all the bloodletting. Rather than get in the thick of it, Amenabar would rather seem to be above it all, quite literally. Massacre of innocents? Cue celestial overhead shot accompanied by contractually obligatory wailing woman on the soundtrack courtesy of Dario Marinelli's surprisingly clichd and dreary score. Suitor pouring out his heart through music? Cut to the slowly turning Earth seen from space. Rise of fundamentalism? Cosmic zoom ahoy, Cap'n! As yet another shot pointing out the cosmic insignificance of it all appeared, I just found myself wondering if he'd bought a job lot of outtakes from Carl Sagan's Cosmos. But no - the credits reveal he'd actually bought a job lot of stock footage from NASA, which presumably explains the presence of the Suez Canal and the Assuan Dam in Fourth Century AD Egypt, which the FX boys forgot to paint out. But then, in a film that takes as many liberties with history as this does (the film not only ignores the esteem she was held in by many contemporary Christians but even portrays Synesius, who defended her intellectual achievements, attacking her `blasphemous' scientific theories as if in a bad school production of Galileo), maybe they thought it didn't matter?

In one of the film's better lines, Hypatia tells a Christian that his new religion has yet to prove it is any better than the old ones. Sadly, this is one peplum that, for all its technical window dressing, really isn't any better or more clearly thought through than the average confused and superficial Italian fight-for-Christ peplum of the 50s.

This is not an easy movie for Christians to watch.  Unfortunately for us Christians, the film tells basically a true history.

Especially disturbing is the way Egyptian actor Sammy Samir portrayed Cyril, bishop of Alexandria, as creepily villainous.  Samir's performance will make you hate Cyril, but the harsh reality is that Cyril, now ""Saint Cyril,"" was one of the worst men of his age.  He persecuted the harmless Christian Novation sect, and he persecuted the Jews, destroying their synagogues and exiling 40,000 of them from Alexandria.  He challenged the civil authority of the Roman prefect Orestes.  In one historical incident depicted in the movie, Cyril's Nitrian monk thugs assault the prefect, and despite Orestes' plea that he was a Christian just like them, a monk named Ammonius threw a stone at him, striking him in the head and covering his face with blood.  After Orestes had the man killed, Cyril honored Ammonius as a Christian martyr and renamed him St. Thaumasius the Wonderful.  But this was going to far even for the mobs of Alexandria, and Cyril backpedaled.

Mercifully, what ""Saint"" Cyril's Parabalani and Nitrian monks did to Hypatia is not fully depicted in the film.  We are spared the gory and gruesome details.

4109200,4,B003CI2G6S,"In ""Agora,"" a film depicting the Roman Empire in circa 415 AD, director Alejandro Amenabar presents his audience with screen-filling photo segments of the earth peacefully spinning in the blackness of space to the music of its sphere.  Who would believe that such serenity would reveal, as the camera pans closer and moves through the layers of the earth's atmosphere, a great din of unrest. Cross-wearing mobs have amassed near the Great Library of Alexandria to uphold the Emperor Theodosius's call for the ultimate removal of all things pagan from the face of the Empire he rules.  Turn-the-other-cheek Christians with cudgels and swords will insure the icons of the pagan world fall without but preferably with bloodshed.  As marble statues topple and priceless scrolls of learning burn in a fire inflamed with fear and ignorance, the pagan denizens of the Library realize that the seclusion of their academic lives is forever to change.

Most influenced by this is the mathematician, philosopher and cosmologist Hypatia (check out Brian Trent's novel ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Remembering-Hypatia-A-Novel-of-Ancient-Egypt/dp/0595342523/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Remembering Hypatia: A Novel of Ancient Egypt</a>""), who is willing to forego romantic love and a domestic life for her desire to unravel the unknown--she happily spends her time teaching a philosophy of the brotherhood of learning while extensively pondering the mathematics of the earth's trajectory around the sun.  Unfortunately, her egalitarian ideas of understanding through knowledge and gender equality threaten those politically positioned to grab the reigns of power and plunge the world into a dark age of domination without the light of free thought.

Rachel Weisz plays Hypatia with a gravitas that brings to life not only her legendary beauty but, her philosopher's love of the truth. Her eyes gaze at a point only she sees bringing an ethereal aura to the otherwise befuddled academic forever preoccupied with theoretical questions the world of science even today has yet to answer. As she fends off three different suitors from three different factions of the city, Weisz, as Hypatia, does a fine job of giving the role a sense of innocence, urgency and impending doom.  Amenabar and Mateo Gil's script allows her to pontificate her idea of a Republic worthy of that of Plato in speeches that underline the seclusion and otherworldliness of her academic life and yet maintain her credibility with a luminous mixture of serenity and dread.

As one of her admirers, the slave Davus (Max Minghella) violently embraces the ascendancy of Christian rule over Alexandria, becoming one of the black-robed `parabolani' who patrol the streets armed with crude weapons, sharp tongues and little mercy for the once aristocratic pagans.  Archbishop Cyril (Sami Samir) wants nothing less than the eradication of all paganism and is willing to preach insurgence.  When he targets Hypatia while sermonizing one of Paul's letters to the Corinthians, former students and rationalists Orestes (Oscar Isaac), the Roman Prefect and Synesius (Rupert Evans) Bishop of Cyrene (this is historically incorrect as Synesius actually was the Bishop of Ptolemais) cringe at what they presage as the unavoidable fate of those who choose not to bend the knee to a faith that is swift in gaining governmental control.

In his scenes of chaos where the once underdog Christians (think arena with lions) fight for control, Amenabar speeds up the action, giving the audience a buzzard's eye view of the warring participants who scurry along and cluster like ants fighting for crumbs of food and annihilating anything in sight.  Papyrus scrolls dance through the air in a macabre sacrilege across an oculus framing an otherwise bright blue sky; harsher, darker fabrics, black beards and the gleam of knives reflecting sneering eyes portray marauding Christians as fanatical equalizers extinguishing the lantern of learning. The point?  All fundamentalists, no matter what the religious or political persuasion, halt humanity's understanding of the world in which it lives and is content to seize control at the expense of the overall common good.  Perhaps Amenabar as an acknowledged atheist uses his film to make a statement against religion as one of the opiates anesthetizing the masses while control is seized by an elite corps--but history tells us that despots will use religion, politics, racial supremacy, various interpretations of the rights of man or anything else to get ultimate access to power and materialistic gain.

Unfortunately, his depiction of Hypatia as an atheist does not ring true.  As a Neo-Platonist, she most likely sought some Gnostic union with the One.  Like many New Agers that profess gnosis of God through meditation, Hypatia probably reveled in her ability to privatize her knowledge of God and attempted to teach her students her ""path"" to that understanding.  History records that Cyril was jealous of her popularity and if she was advocating knowledge of God without the communal help and guidance of the Church, it is little wonder that Cyril affixed a target to her being.  Amenabar, being fully aware that most audiences love beauty and put it well before age, takes another liberty: at the time of her death, Hypatia would have been nearing sixty rather than the 30-something that Weisz's fresher visage suggests.  Artistic license allows that which aesthetically pleases and that which will further the theme of the medium.  From the same standpoint, Amenabar's version of the destruction of the Serapeum shows the mob burning books to intensify the end of illuminated thinking.  However the actual event in 391 did not actually involve the burning of books as the Serapeum was used primarily as a temple rather than a library.

Bottom line?  Despite some historical inaccuracies, Alejandro Amenabar uses his film ""Agora"" to remind us that history does indeed repeat itself with the machinations of the heavy-handed using fear and ignorance to move their cause. Perhaps Amenabar's point as an atheist is that all religion manipulates the masses. Whether it be with a fear of the unknown or unfamiliar or an argument over whose god is better, the fanatical fundamentalist armies championing intolerance destroy progressive thought and stall the overall evolution of mankind in favor of their specific agenda. A stirring musical score by Dario Marianelli thrusts the film towards its grisly conclusion while Rachel Weisz as the philosopher Hypatia quietly spouts rhetoric on the side of the truth and the absolute quest for knowledge. No one in the supporting cast listens and the world goes mad. Recommended with warnings of much violence and a brutal ending.

It takes place in the early Christian years of the 4th century in Alexandria, Egypt, governed by the Eastern Roman Empiror Theodosius. The tumultous years of early Christianity are well depicted as Christianity, Paganism and Judaism vie for predominance. Among that strife, Hypatia, a Greek scholar and caretaker of the library of Alexandria faces the fanaticism of Pagans, Jews and Early Christians, amidst her struggle to solve the mystery of the motion of planets. Being a woman, she is viciously discriminated by Early Christian dogma. Finally, both her life and the library fall victims to Christian fanatics.

Timelines are greatly compressed, Robert Dudley (Earl of Leicester) is turned into a naive pretty boy (which he was not) and it's spiced up with some dramatic episodes that didn't happen (like Walsingham murdering Mary of Guise). But the story, cinematography, and portrayal of life in the Elizabethan court (especially the politics) are absorbing and completely credible.

Agora lost me when the young woman protagonist used a proposition of Euclid to ""prove"" that ""we are all brothers"".

4109204,5,B003CI2G6S,"There is a great deal of background information that the viewer should be aware of < watching this film.  First off, Alexander of Macedon dreamed of an intellectual sanctuary where philosophers / scientists / acadamecians could come together and collaborate on their mutual quests to discover the truth about how the universe operates.  Alexander did not live to see his dream fulfilled, but one of his top generals, Ptolemy, set the groundwork for the tangible manifestation of Alexander's vision:  the library of Alexandria.

After the demise of Athens in the Peloponnesian war, Alexandria would become the most cosmopolitan city of the ancient world.  It was a Greek city on Egyptian soil;  the architecture was mostly Greek and the denizens (in the beginning) were Greek as well.  Myriad intellectuals either visited the library or had their works stored at the library (Euclid, Archimedes, Hero, Aristarchus of Samos & Eritosthenes ~ just to name a few).  The entire literary canon of antiquity was stored at the library as well.

The concept of the university is a product of the Middle Ages.  While this is an indisputable fact, one could easily argue that the Library of Alexandria was a predecessor to the university.  No less an authority than the late Carl Sagan described the Library as the first scientific institute.  Yes, it was that big of a deal!

In 313CE Constantine the Great signed the Edict of Milan, which legalized Christianity throughout the Roman Empire.  Within a century, Christianity went from a religion known for having its members persecuted to being a religion that routinely persecuted persons who were either areligious or followed other religions.

That brings us to the crux of the current film:  the life & times of Hypatia of Alexandria.  She was an astronomer, philosopher, physicist, literary critic and quite simply one of the most remarkable minds of the ancient world.  She lived in the waning days of the Roman Empire, when the early Christians incited a war against science and philosophy.

Rachel Weisz is fabulous as Hypatia.  It is said that Hypatia had the form of Aphrodite and the spirit of Plato;  Weisz is credible in her portrayal of Hypatia on both of these fronts.  Weisz takes us by the hand and shows us how Hypatia grappled with issues that would be hammered out by Copernicus, Keppler, Galileo and Einstein > 1,000 years later.

Hypatia's story is a tragic one ~ mirrored by the fate of the library of Alexandria itself.  She lived in a time when friction rose between the separation of church and state as well as the animosity between science and religion.  Misogyny also reigned supreme.  A Christian mob eventually  destroyed the library and sent western civilization plunging into the Dark Ages.  The story of both Hypatia & the library is told in this film.

4109211,5,B003CI2G6S,"This is one of those rare movies that brings history to life in a way that moves the mind of today. I also think it is much misunderstood by some of the critical reviewers; both in the science and in the art of it. I'd like to try to clear some of that up and encourage more movie lovers to give this one a view.

Before I begin, I would request that those who click ""Helpful"" or ""Not Helpful"" not make their decision by deciding they don't like my description of their religion. I'm reviewing a movie, not anyone's religious beliefs and would ask that you decide based on that.

Our main character is Hypatia of Alexandria. Most people aren't even familiar with that name anymore, which is a sad statement on our public education system, but that is another story altogether. As an introduction, Hypatia was a somewhat mysterious scholar and lecturer in Alexandria during the second half of the 4th century. To put it into context, her skills in mathematics joined with her deep knowledge of philosophy (she was a student of Ptolemy) and ability to speak made her not just a brilliant scientist but one capable of transmitting that knowledge in an engaging way to students. Needless to say, she was popular and her students traveled from all over the known world to hear her and study under her.

Why she remains mysterious is entwined with her death and the rise of the Christian church at this time. Much of what she did was destroyed and, in fact, most of the knowledge of the time was purposefully destroyed by Christians as they rose to power. Most of what survives of Hypatia is third person in the form of letters about her and her discoveries and a few remaining scraps from her lifetime.

In the movie, we follow Hypatia and the larger city of Alexandria through a time of tumult and change. Christianity is on the rise and in Rome, the Emporer has become a Christian (though retrospective analysis indicates it was a political move to capitolize on the violent action of early Christians in suppressing a populace that questioned rule by Emporers and wanted a return to the Republic). In effect, now all those in government must also convert...even at the point of a spear. Some, however, are genuine believers. It is the ignorance of the uneducated combined with the justification that no matter what you do, if you *can* do it then it must be this god's will that helped to set the ancient world ablaze in our story.

In order to not spoil the movie for others, I'll not get into too many details that unfold during the movie. The general progression is that Hypatia, who lives to learn and discover as scientists across time have always done, continues her work under an increasingly tight net until the inevitable happens and the Christians demand that she, as a woman, must be silent...and she must convert. When she refuses it is only a matter of time until they wreak a terrible vengeance upon her.

Because so much of her life is unknown but hinted at, the writers in this movie have much leeway in depicting her life amongst the men who surrounded her as students, admirers or implacable enemies. The addition of the story of her slave, Davus, is compelling and allows them to deal with her death in a more senstive manner than it happened in real life. In real history she was butchered with sharp shells while alive and then hung and burned while still alive directly afterward. And it is an accepted fact that she was, in fact, a virgin and no ones lover. Dedicated to science and learning, she had no interest in purely physical relationships by all accounts. The story of the handkerchief and this attitude is dealt with delicately.

I found the acting well done with Rachel Weisz stunning as the mentally absorbed and physically pared down Hypatia. What other reviewers have called wooden in some of the performances are reflective, I think, of the manner and style of the time and suit the scenes and language exceptionally well. The director has allowed others to be a little muted so that those who have the passion to move mobs or minds stand head and shoulders above the rest. Stunning work.

The imagery is, in a word, brilliant. The perspective, recreation of Ancient Alexandria and even the turning of the camera to reflect a world turned backward by the wanton destruction of the sum total of it's knowledge is breathtaking.

There is also clearly a misunderstanding of her experiments in the movie and one even remarked that this wasn't discovered until Kepler. That is the point. We'll never know what was discovered or codified mathematically by her, her students or even thousands of others who work resided in Alexandria (think of Alexandria as repository of all work done in the universities and research facilities of today and you'll get the idea). It was purposefully destroyed and we entered a dark age that pushed back such discoveries, whether for the first time or rediscoveries of lost knowledge, a thousand years. The experiment on conic shapes and planetary movement was entirely logical given her sphere of work but the movie shows how such knowledge is lost by using a bit of information that is approachable and undestandable to the movie audience. I found it compelling.

While Hypatia was a renowned scholar of conic shapes (and this knowledge plays a huge role in the early discovery of planetary movement) and a passionate student of astronomy, there remains no proof that she unraveled the dichotomy between planetary movement and the paradigm of circles. It would be nice to think she had solved such a thing and at least had that before she died.",1294704000,12,5607,4.723926380368098

4109213,4,B003CI2G6S,"""Agora"" has much to recommend it. The recreations of ancient Alexandria, with the camera sweeping past the great lighthouse, are quite magnificent, and the costumes, the details of which have been based upon the Roman-Egyptian Fayum portraits, are equally spectacular. Rachel Weisz portrays a believable Hypatia, the unique philosopher-scientist, who was associated with Alexandria's center of learning, the Great Library, the Temple of Sarapis and its ancillary school of medicine.

As one with a profound interest in ancient history but with a complete ignorance of all things mathematical, I found the most fascinating parts of the film to be the explanations (criticised by reviewers more knowledgeable than I) of parabolas and ellipses. It had not occurred to me previously that such geometrical shapes could be sliced out of a cone. I found myself wishing that geometry had been made so interesting when I was forced to struggle through its complexities during high school.

The film is heavy-handed with its undeniable message that religious fanaticism engenders the destruction of both humanism and humanity. I found the least interesting parts of the film to be its depiction of the social, political, and religious conflicts, which, because the film is not a documentary, were oversimplified, sometimes to the point of absurdity (The Christian fanatics picking up stones reminded me not of the Taliban but of the zealots in Monty Python's ""Life of Brian;"" I therefore found myself giggling when I should have been horrified). Because of this oversimplification, in which the filmmakers ""tell"" with terse and difficult-to-read white-on-white subtitles instead of ""showing"" with about 20 minutes of expository development, one gets the impression that the turmoil which brought about Hypatia's downfall was sudden, when violent ethnic conflicts in Alexandria had been ongoing since the days of the first-century emperor Claudius. This sense of suddenness was also apparent in the portrayal of Hypatia's ""discoveries,"" which were part of a continuum of intellectualism in connection with the great library (where Eratosthenes, who knew the world was round, had calculated the circumference of the earth). One had no sense that Alexandria had been the hub of the intellectual world for the previous six hundred years.

Since the film focuses upon such an extraordinary woman of learning, I can't think why it was not entitled ""Hypatia,"" especially since the word ""Agora"" has little meaning to those unfamiliar with Greek, or Alexandria's history as a Hellenistic city. And Hypatia's history as a respected professor in a man's world is fascinating. Indeed, the part that rang truest for me were the charges of witchcraft brought against her, since the word ""docta"", meaning an educated woman, was synonymous with a female practitioner of witchcraft in the ancient world. Such charges, which were almost impossible to refute, were constantly brought against women of prominence in Ancient Rome.

Despite the above reservations, the merits of ""Agora"" outweigh its faults. It is worth watching if only to whet your interest about Hypatia and Alexandria, the multicultural center of learning in the ancient world.",1294272000,2,3215,5.424

4109222,5,B003CI2G6S,"Okay, it's not a perfect movie but I would give this an ABSOLUTE A for Effort because it's so boldly going where no film has gone before - into subject matter that is vital to our understanding of history (and our current situation) as well as into ideas and a world view that have never been presented in film. Agora fills in a huge missing chapter in two ways - first the literal one - the telling of a tale placed in 5th century Alexandria. Second, the subject matter and worldview level...Much of what we have in ancient history films (war movies: Spartacus, Oliver Stone's Alexander the Great; soap operas: HBO's Rome series; or boxing pix: Gladiator, etc.) is from the point of view of let's say a contemporary General Patton or a Muhammad Ali  - i.e. a military history or a boxing/wrestling match (gladiator movies). Think what a distorted view of modern history you would have if that is all you learned of our own times.

Agora is audacious in going into other topics from ancient history - philosophers, the history of astronomy, a famous woman professor of mathematics, contemporary pagan subjugation by Christian zealots - that we never see on the screen. And not only do we see them but in glorious computer graphics. Alexandria comes to life in this film - a life we can no longer experience in Alexandria or anywhere on earth. Even the selection of the actors is based on portraits from the times.

If the characters and the plot sometimes try to do a little too much, it's forgiveable, to me, because the overall value is incredible. I only wish the director was assigned to do more of these over his lifetime; we'd have better and better narratives, and equally stunning visuals.

This is richly imagined, beautifully executed and highly recommended!

I especially like the DVD extras - loving the interview with the director, writer, producer, and production design team.

I know the story of Hypatia.  While there are minor inaccuracies, the film is honest and tells the true story.  About her personal life, the film is imaginative, obviously.  It is a movie after all.

One detail that has been promulgated about Hypatia is certainly not true; she was not an atheist.  Hypatia was a mathematician and a Neoplatonist philosopher.  The Neoplatonists most certainly believed in and understood Divinity, and at a very sophisticated level.  When such wisdom is properly perceived, it is conceivable that it could be accepted by a scientific atheist....conceivable, but a bit of a stretch.

I also never thought about the rise of Christianity once it was no longer under persecution by the Romans.

Hypatia (the Rachel Weisz character) was a real historical figure. She taught philosophy, mathematics and astronomy, and tried to figure out the movements of the heavenly bodies. This was happening at a time when the Christians were gaining in their numbers. The differences between the Pagan, Christian and Jewish religions heat up to boiling point. This causes rifts in Hypatia's class, as well as local society in general, to the point where large numbers of people die violent deaths.

I don't know how much historical accuracy suffers for the need of a good script here, but it's fascinating to see it all unravel. The prime characters become a cross section of society in general and it's not pretty to watch. Christian viewers beware. This paints Christians of that time as a violent, ugly people. Some of them even wear pouches filled with rocks in case they need to stone someone at a moment's notice. They are shown as having no tolerance. If you are not a Christian, your life is forfeit.

This film is good on the eyes. The sets and costumes are great to look at. The performances are very good as well. If there is anything I thought could have been better it's that certain ideas the writer/ director was trying to convey could have been a bit more subtle. A particular scene when, in the craziness of the events, Hypatia's slave comes to see her and begins with his attempting to rape her and ends with his crying on her as though she were his mother was a bit ""too."" But this is a minor quibble. This is a rich movie with a great revealing of what was happening in this time and place. If you're at all a fan of historical epics, this should well be worth your time.",1291248000,,2067,4.551075268817204

4109229,5,B003CI2G6S,"Agora was a Cinema Masterpiece, no less.  It showed the evils of religion in whatever form it takes.  The film focuses on the Christians but it shows the Hubris and self importance of all religions, ""Pagan"", Jew, and Christian.  They all felt that they were the chosen ones, that the others were misguided children who did not really understand the true word of God or the Gods and in this sanctimonious self righteosness they brought about a long slow slide into a Dark Age that lasted for a Millenium and destroyed almost all of the light and knowledge that man had created.  The ironic thing was that some of the ""Pagan"" writings were saved by the Christian Church not because they valued the widom and knowledge but because they used them to show how much more enlightened they were and how ignorant and un-enlightend the ""Pagans"" were.  Well at least they saved those great works for a more enlightend time.

The most dire and horrifying effect this film has is to show the shadows of our world today.  Once again our world is sliding into the darkness of religous extremism and ignorance.....this time Islam.  Once again anything that does not fit into what they feel is the ""True Way"" must be destroyed and once again our leadership and our societs are a bunch of spineless cowards giving in to the ignorance and darkness and masking it as ""compassion"", ""tolerance"", and that it is ""inevevitable"".

The movie was often hard to follow and required a solid base of historical knowledge before even watching it. Hypatia was a fascinating woman and it is always good to see a movie made about a powerful woman in the ancient world other than Cleopatra or Livia. The movie failed to hold my attention, though - not properly introducing characters, having the explanatory text flash on the screen for at most 5 seconds with the writing in white against a pale background, and having the story be very fragmented. The acting was a mixed bag, as well, with Rachel Weisz as Hypatia, Ashraf Barhom as Ammonius, and Michael Lonsdale as Theon doing a particularly good job, but I think that the script was partially to blame for the rest. There were also strange moments like at the very end between Davus and Hypatia which are really hard to decipher.

Because of these perquisites its audience is probably going to be very, very small, probably in the dozens.  That said, if historical drama and intellectual stimulation is your cup of tea, this movie is for you.  Be forewarned, this movie is a tragedy unless religious repression and violence is also your cup of tea.

One thing, although I am confident the movie makers did a reasonable portrayal of the power politics of the time, I question whether anyone can be certain of the fate of Hypathia.  History is at best a lie agreed upon.  I read another interpretation Hypathia's death that has her dying at an old age.

This movie did not get much hype as far as I can tell as I hadn't heard of it before I saw it on Amazon's enticement list.  This is not an action film by any means, but it does highlight a very important era in history, especially in women's history.  Hypatia, female--the worst thing to be in that world at that time, had an indulgent father who educated her.  She led a free life, did not marry and thus was not protected.  She was a wise woman in a time when women did not exist but to bear young but her freedom disturbed the male society, and her religious inclinations, if they were anything, were based in the pagan religion at a time when Christianity was struggling against the pagan world to gain power and hegemony.  Too often the Christians were led by zealots and, of course, early Christians, much like too many religions today, are not wonderfully happy when a woman shows strength, courage, and exercizes power.  Hypatia's power was of the mind.  She had no political inclinations but she knew powerful people.  Every era has its own form of inquisition.  This one was no exception. I appreciated this film.",1289865600,3,1204,4.558139534883721
4109234,3,B003CI2G6S,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

With Agora, Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar has taken on a subject that has not been done before in the movies: the story of Hypatia, 4th century Alexandrian astronomer-philosopher, a woman way ahead of her time. Little is known about the historical Hypatia so Amenabar also depicts the political situation in Alexandria: the internecine struggle between a besieged Roman pagan culture and ascendant Christians. A fantastic set was constructed on the island of Malta along with digital effects added later on that recreates ancient Alexandria. Coupled with some excellent work on the part of the film's costume designer, the result is an impressive verisimilitude. Quibblers might object to the use of candles and glass windows but as the director points out in a special features DVD interview, there is considerable disagreement amongst historians as to whether those and other materials were in use at that particular period in history.

Amenabar's main problem is that his protagonist is for the most part not an active agent in the external arc of the story. It's established early on that she rejects the love interests of both Davus, her soon to be freed slave and convert to Christianity and Orestes, the pagan nobleman who later becomes the prefect of Alexandria. In a scene based on a true story, she hands Orestes (at the beginning of the film, a student of Hypatia), a handkerchief soaked with blood from her menstrual cycle and makes it clear that she has no interest in future sexual relationships. Her interest is furthering her career in philosophy and astronomy. The focus thus is on Hypatia's internal arc, as she struggles to replace Ptolemy's erroneous geocentric conception of the universe with a heliocentric model. Amenabar informs us that he wanted 'Agora' to be, in part, a tribute to astronomy and physics. This is unfortunate because the many scenes that focus on Hypatia totally lack suspense. We KNOW basically that she'll come up with the right answer in regards to her astronomical quandaries, so no matter how many circles are drawn in the sand, the viewer is reminded more of a History Channel documentary than scenes from a flesh and blood drama.

In contrast to most Biblical epics, Amendabar turns his Christians into the bad guys and now the Pagans, represented by the rational and humanistic Hypatia, are the enlightened. The Christians become stand-ins for today's fundamentalists. We learn from the DVD documentary that the costume designer based the costumes of the Parabalani (the Christian Brotherhood who are depicted here as bad guy enforcers for the local Patriarch) on the Taliban. Amendabar intentionally has the Christians all dressed in a dark gray and the pagans in white.

Amendabar claims that the film is not meant to be anti-Christian and he emphasizes that the violence in the opening scenes is clearly instigated by the pagans. On the other hand, the Christians' rising militancy is ably depicted in the character of Ammonius who challenges a pagan to walk over some burning coals (this supposedly was based on a true story). When the pagan hesitates, the crowd throws him into the fire and he's almost burned to death. Amendabar then awkwardly inserts a scene that's designed to depict the 'good' side of the Christian mission--the soldiers are directed to give bread to the poor. But it's not enough--before you know it, the 'fundamentalist' Christians are throwing Jews out the windows of their apartments (a la Schindler's List) and stoning poor Hypatia to death much in the manner of today's Tablian. Despite his claims to the contrary, Amendabar appears to take some satisfaction in having his Christians get their comeuppance. He even has ""Saint"" Cyril, the bad guy Alexandrian Patriarch, read an misogynistic passage from the Book of Timothy as a prelude to his order that Hypatia renounce her 'faith'.

Given all the sappy pro-Christian Biblical epics we've had to endure over the years, a corrective in the other direction might not be such a bad thing after all. Amendabar has provided a service in depicting true historical events where once oppressed Christians now attain power and become as bad as their former pagan oppressors. But that's really all Amendabar has provided: a history lesson! I think what's missing is some basic character development. Somehow I have the feeling that Cyril was a little more complicated than the sinister Fundamentalist stand-in depicted here.

Amendabar fails to rise above hagiography in his telling of the Hypatia story. The short scene where she reminds Davus that he's still a slave during the pagan evacuation of the city is not enough to humanize his protagonist. Amendabar ends up being just as guilty as the Christians he derides when he turns Hypatia into a martyr of western rationalism. Even the 'good' Christians are ineffectual or downright hypocritical. Spineless Orestes falls to his knees in front of Synesius, symbolizing the complete capitulation of the pagan world to Christianity and Synesius can only mumble platitudes about God as he basically condones Hypatia's death sentence.

In the end, science and 'reason' are Amendabar's good guys and promoters of 'faith' are the bad guys. The virtually all virtuous Hypatia stands in stark relief to the world's religions which are blamed for the spread of fundamentalism. 4th Century Christians are not only stand-ins for modern day Islamic fundamentalists but the basic tenets of Christianity, based on an anti-Semitic creed, is linked to the horrors of the Holocaust. Even the Jews (albeit seen less culpable here than the Christians and the Muslims) commit atrocities in the name of religion.

Amendabar still manages to show restraint in some scenes. Particularly admirable is that he protects his audience from experiencing the full horror of Hypatia's execution (in history she's skinned alive; here, Davus, her former slave, suffocates her in order to prevent her further suffering).

Agora is good as a basic history lesson. But its simplistic depiction of the supremacy of reason over religious fundamentalism doesn't ring quite true.",1289692800,7,6162,5.166332665330661
4109235,5,B003CI2G6S,I am not going to write a 10 page review because I actually have a life. If you like great films this one is a must see. Two thumps way up!,1289692800,3,139,3.5161290322580645
4109236,4,B003CI2G6S,"There are very few works of fiction that deal with the brief and very interesting period in which the Greco Roman classical world was rapidly and sometimes violently replaced by Christianity: if you ask me quickly I can recall only some of the poems of Constantin Cavafy. Agora, directed by the Spanish Chilean director Alejandro Amenabar (who also cowrote it) tells the real life story of the Alexandrian philosopher Hypatia, one of the last platonic philosophers, who was brutally murdered in 415 at the hand of Christian monks followers of bishop (later Saint) Cyril.
Her story has always been almost too neat a metaphor of freedom and scientific inquiry being crushed by obscurantist theology, and as such it has been espoused by writers critical of religion (the first time I heard about Hypatia was when I watch Carl Sagan's Cosmos when I was 12 years old and reportedly director Alejandro Amenabar also first heard about her there).
Agora is certainly not subtle, but at least it does not underestimate its audience and is not afraid of being about ideas, refusing to water them down. I read negative comments by some classicists about the movie, and most of their criticisms are really nit picking (like, Roman soldiers are using uniforms of the 1st century instead of the fifth). Other common criticism is in the movie's imagining Hypatia as a precursor of the Keplerian system of planetary movement, but given that a lot of the science and philosophy of this period was lost with the burning of the library of Alexandria, and that geometry and astronomy of that era was quite advanced for the time, this scene doesn't seem such a terrible slip. If you read any biography of Hypatia, it is clear that the movie got the big details about her life (and the ideas she was espousing) right.
The acting is generally good: Rachel Weisz is good as the philosopher, but some of the supporting players like Oscar Isaac as Orestes (the prefect of Egypt and a former student and admirer of her that try to protect her) and Sami Samir as Cyril particularly excel.",1289260800,2,2060,4.805633802816901

4109239,5,B003CI2G6S,"I walk into the theater not really knowing about the movie, but knowing about the history behind it.

Note:
At the moment that I am writing this note, 2 individuals have not liked the review! Why? Because it is against their religion! The truth is the truth! History can be adorned but not changed. Please have the guts and the honesty to accept whatever is real and live in peace!",1288569600,4,728,4.392592592592592
4109240,4,B003CI2G6S,"Positives:
It's good to see a bit of honesty with regard to Christianity's darker moments; not that other religions are immune from similar indiscretions. Sadly, institutionalized religion's quest for numbers, power and control has not abated and still deceptively couches desires in misdirected terminology and goals.

Negatives:
(1.) Can't studios find it in their vast budgets to hire appropriate consultants -  in this case teachers and scientists. During Hypatia's time the methods of Socratic discourse and teaching to encourage reasoned thought were well known. Hypatia failed to query her students in order to elicit creative responses to questions; did not encourage return creative questioning; did not redirect or build upon responses...
(2.) As a scientist Hypatia did not behave as any scientists I've known both in terms of her emotional responses and the thought processes she used for problem solving. These characteristics don't change with time - they are timelessly inherent to the inquiry process.
(3.) Throughout the film the use of contemporary language such as ""optical illusion"" and ""heliocentric model"" distracted from understanding that period.",1288569600,3,1170,5.642045454545454
4109241,1,B003CI2G6S,"This movie was a great disappointment! I was anxiously awaiting its release on DVD because this period in history (Byzantine Era/Late Antiquity) is almost never dealt with in movies. I titled my review ""lost opportunity"" because making a movie about Byzantine Egypt with characters such as Hypatia and St. Cyril was a golden opportunity to show both ancient science and religion in a positive light and show the relevance of both to our modern world. It is true that these two didn't always get along in the 4th and 5th centuries but this was not due to anything intrinsic to either Science or Christianity.

Moving away from paganism and the worship of statues and nature was just as much an advance of human reason as Aristarchus' heliocentric theory.  Unfortunately, by watching this movie one would get the impression that those who believed in mythology and in twelve gods living on Mount Olympus were the rational ones and those who condemned such beliefs as foolish and outdated were just uneducated fanatics. Rather than making an intelligent statement about science and religion this movie is just a hatchet job on St. Cyril and the Orthodox Church. The early Church was never against science, anyone who has read the works of Clement of Alexandria or St. Basil the Great would know this. The Church was against paganism and the worship of false gods and idols.
This movie however did not only get the religion side of the story wrong but it also got the science side of the story wrong. Some examples:

1) The movie implies that Hypatia came up with the idea of eccentric orbits. This is totally false. Ptolemy's whole system was based on eccentric orbits.
2) The movie claims Hypatia discovered the First Law of Planetary Motion. There is absolutely no evidence for this. Also, how did she arrive at an elliptical orbit based solely on the need for an eccentric orbit? On what basis does she reject the eccentric orbits of Ptolemy? This is why the movie hides the fact that Ptolemy's system was based on eccentric orbits in the first place.
3) The movie dismisses the objection to heliocentrism which states that objects would be displaced by the motion of the Earth. This objection is not entirely wrong. Hypatia's experiment of dropping a sack from the mast of a moving ship would not result in its falling straight down as the movie suggests but it would be displaced by a very tiny amount due to the Earth's rotation, this is known as the ""Coriolis Force"". Whether the sack would be displaced towards the East or towards the West would depend on whether the ship was traveling north from Alexandria or south towards Alexandria. The problem is in being able to notice and measure such a tiny displacement.

But the most glaring offense of the movie is its portrayal of St. Cyril and his followers. It is obvious that the makers of this film did not read any of the writings of St. Cyril who was an intellectual of the highest order. The actual St. Cyril of history, the St. Cyril that we can discern from his own writings, the St. Cyril that was the champion of Orthodoxy at the Council of Ephesus bears no resemblance to the evil uneducated murderous thug of the movie.  If St. Cyril was an anti-science thug why has the International Astronomical Union endorsed the naming of a lunar crater in his honor?
It is unfortunate that this movie was an agenda driven hatchet job rather than an honest portrayal of history.",1288569600,90,3431,4.730769230769231

4109243,4,B003CI2G6S,"Agora is a dramatic depiction of what happened to Hypatia, the highly intelligent non-Christian Greek scholar from Alexandria, Egypt who was considered the first notable woman in mathematics.

An agora was an open place of assembly in ancient Greek city-states. This movie focuses on the agora in the area of the Serapeum in Alexandria, Egypt around 391 CE. The Serapeum, as presented in this movie, is incredibly well done. It's as though you were actually stepping back in time to see how it actually looked. The actors, the sets, and the entire production come together well and give the movie an authentic feel. This film truly has the feel of going back into time.

By NO MEANS am I stating that the movie ""Agora"" is 100% realistic. I am well aware that this is a typical Hollywood movie and I am also aware that NO movie is going to be 100% historically accurate. That being said, the movie ""Agora"" does get the big picture right and some details wrong. It's a movie. It was made to make money. I know that dramatic liberties were taken and I expect that. But, as long as the general story is told correctly then I don't mind some historical inaccuracies.

The Serapeum in Alexandria was destroyed by a Christian crowd in 391. The Serapeum housed part of the Great Library. The Serapeum in Alexandria did house a collection of writings that were a part of the Great Library. Now, the movie ""Agora"" shows Christian mobs destroying the Great Library at Alexandria. This, in truth, was most likely just a smaller housing of writings instead of the actual Great Library. There was a fire near the library in 47 BCE when Julius Caesar and the Roman armies conquered Egypt but there is no evidence that this destroyed the entire library and Caesar certainly never mentioned anything about completely burning down the greatest library in ancient history. A fire in the harbor most likely wouldn't have reached and burned down the entire library.

Suetonius, writing around 125 CE, says that the Emperor Domitian (reigning from 81 to 96 CE) used Alexandrian scholars to replace texts from Augustus' library at Palatine after a fire. It is entirely plausible that some portion of the Great Library continued to exist for many years and that there was a sister library of writings located at the Serapeum in Alexandria where the movie ""Agora"" takes place. Regardless of whether or not it was the actual Great Library or just a smaller collection of writings, it is sad to watch. All those philosophical, scientific, mathematical, and other literature destroyed by an ignorant mob who considered anything against their god to be pagan and therefore in need of being destroyed.

Hypatia taught philosophy and astronomy. Her contributions to science are reputed to include the charting of celestial bodies and the invention of the hydrometer which is used to determine the relative density and gravity of liquids. In the movie, she is shown with an incessant quest for knowledge concerning the world around her and not accepting any god for an answer. The real Hypatia was not an atheist and she was not a pagan either in the sense of worshipping many different gods. She devoted her entire life to the study of great thinkers such as Aristotle, Plato, Aristarchus, etc. In the movie she is shown as investigating the heliocentric model of the solar system proposed by Aristarchus of Samos. This might not have been historically accurate but was most likely used as part of the movie to make it more interesting. There was no evidence that she actually studied the heliocentric model of the solar system. But, the movie does get it right that she was an avid astronomer and she had many students who would come from all over to be taught by her.

The movie Agora focuses on Hypatia's final years. Hypatia is played extremely well by actress Rachel Weisz. One thing that must be said is that Rachel Weisz is much too young to have played Hypatia at this stage in her life. In reality, she was around 60 years old. But, Rachel Weisz is much nicer to look at than perhaps a 60 year old actress so I can see why she was chosen to play the part. My favorite two lines from her in this movie are where, at one point, one of her inquisitors says that Hypatia does not believe in anything concerning religion and she states: ""I believe in philosophy. "" Later on when a Christian demands that she must be baptized and that she must consider herself among the Christians, she says to this Christian, ""You don't question what you believe, I must.."" You have to admire this woman for defying the ignorant piety of the times to stand up for what scientific knowledge she had.

The movie does a really good job of creating the contentious condition surrounding Orestes and Cryil, who were played brilliantly by the actors in this movie. All the actors in Agora are really talented. Hypatia was believed to have been the reason for the strained relationship between the governor of Alexandria, Orestes and the bishop of Alexandria, Cyril. Orestes and Cyril clashed. Both of these men were Christians but Orestes would allow the support of pagans and Jews. Cyril detested pagans and Jews. Problems occurred when Cyril and the church interfered with the secular authority of Orestes but this is really not developed too deeply in the movie. There are a few different spins on how events developed between Orestes and Cyril in the movie but nothing far fetched at all. In fact, everything appears extremely realistic at all times. History records that Orestes was angered with Cyril for interfering with secular issues and Cryil was angered that Orestes did not accept reconciliatory attempts made by him. There were other issues involving the Jews and pagans as well. Several Christians thought that Hypatia's influence had caused Orestes to reject all reconciliatory offerings by Cyril. Modern historians think that Orestes had cultivated his relationship with Hypatia to strengthen a bond with the pagan community of Alexandria, as he had done with the Jewish one, to handle better the difficult political life of the Egyptian capital. This is really not explained well before the Christian mob takes her to be killed.

That brings me to the death of Hypatia. There is no denying that she was brutally murdered and that Christians did it. That absolutely remains a black spot on the record of early Christianity. The film Agora presents her death in a lot more subtle manner than what actually transpired. In this film, her former slave does her the honorable duty of suffocating her before the mob gets to her. In actuality, she was stripped naked, brutally sliced up with shards of shell, cut into pieces, and then burned. That would have made for an extremely gruesome scene indeed in this movie. But we get a toned down version. We have accounts on what truly happened to her. This is truly one of the most awful historical atrocities committed by ancient Christians. This woman, Hypatia, was a beautiful scientific mind that was ruthlessly wiped out by the fervent religious ignorance of that time. Socrates Scholasticus writes in the 400s CE;

""Some of them therefore, hurried away by a fierce and bigoted zeal, whose ringleader was a reader named Peter, waylaid her returning home, and dragging her from her carriage, they took her to the church called Caesareum, where they completely stripped her, and then murdered her by scraping her skin off with tiles and bits of shell. After tearing her body in pieces, they took her mangled limbs to a place called Cinaron, and there burnt them.""

Agora is truly a remarkable film that I would highly recommend. It's like stepping back into time and experiencing a piece of history that should not be ignored. Although it is not completely accurate in regards to history (NO film is) it still gets the big picture right in the fact that Hypatia was a brilliant mind, she taught many students in Alexandria, she was believed to be the cause of strained relations between Orestes and Cyril, and she was brutally murdered by Christians in 415 CE. The dark age of ignorance would soon follow this atrocity and would again repeat itself with the likes of Giordano Bruno and Galileo during the Italian (Roman) Inquisition.",1288310400,2,8243,4.827317763623496

Hypatia living in the middle of yet another of the infinite religious, political struggles of this world. She is only interested in knowledge, science and astronomy and is murdered for politics, religion and her gender.

This movie is a success in that it brought Hypatia and the world she lived in to life in a way that had not been done before. It may not be what exactly happened, but it held enough truth to keep me interested and emotionally move me.

4109247,5,B003CI2G6S,"I was quite astonished at the sophistication of this film.  It has all the prerequisites of overblown melodrama:  a beautiful proto-feminist heroine, two men in love with her (a slave and an aristocrat), and a reconstituted repository of ancient rational knowledge, in a backdrop of fanatical Christians taking over from declining pagans.  I assumed, wrongly, it was going to be another Prince-of-Persia type reconstruction of hyperbole, muddled facts, and overlooked nuance.  Instead, the film is a wonderfully stimulating portrayal of an intellectual and the end of a tradition - of rationalist philosophy - of nearly 1000 years, to make way for monotheism and soon the collapse of the Roman civilization.

The intellectual themes of the film are rather recondite.  On the one hand, Hypatia (who actually is an historical figure) is seeking to explore the validity of the core assumptions in the cosmology of Ptolemy:  that the Earth is the stationary center of the universe around which everything revolves; that circles, the most perfect expression of the principles of Euclidean geometry, must be the form that the motions take.  She starts from the premise that real-life observation should be connected to philosophic ideals (a precursor of modern scientific experimentation).  On the other hand, there are the fundamentalists, that is, the early Christians who are following their consciences and the dictates of the Emperor Constantine to accept Christianity as the religion of the Empire;  their universe is not rational, but based on faith, what is the word of God as written in the Book, and lastly revelation in which God directly offers guidance to the self-appointed leaders of the faithful.  It is simply amazing to me that this clash of world views can be presented with the level of subtlety and sophistication that it is.

The plot that frames the story is somewhat less subtle, but the script, the direction, and the acting are so fine that, in my view, none of the characters (save perhaps the brutal, angry, and arrogant Christian leader Cyril) fall into stereotypes.  Hypatia is the daughter of an old-style aristocratic philosopher, who is open-minded enough not to push her into marriage and nurtured her mind to the point that she is a masterful teacher and intellectual.  They maintain what is left of the Alexandrian library, a treasury of ancient knowledge accumulated from the time of Alexander the Great.  Outside their walls, there is a fight for the soul of the city, led by a fanatical Christian, Cyril, about whom I know nothing as to his historical basis.  The pagans feel besieged, the Christians on the ascendant, as backed by the Emperors of West and East Rome.

Hypatia is loved by both an aristocratic upstart and one of her slaves.  These two men embody what is happening to the city and indeed to the empire.  Fortunately, the evolution of their characters and their later actions - in spite of Hyaptia's rejection of both of their advances - is completely believable and nuanced.  I do not want to play the spoiler here as it is a big part of the film's value and dramatic tension.  Suffice to say that the Christians win, their appetite for power and domination ever expanding and sweeping away anything and everyone in its wake:  as fundamentalists with a monopoly on the truth, they are portrayed as nascent totalitarians though not as simple brutes.

As a history buff who has long studied the elucidation of the motion of the planets - the greatest early achievement of what became modern science - I did feel that too much license was taken with what Hypatia did and thought.  Indeed, she is portrayed as first discovering what Johannes Kepler finally proved in the late Renaissance:  that the Earth moved in an elliptical orbit around the sun, which occupied one of its foci.  There is no evidence that she did, so far as I know.  Nonetheless, that the film brings these issues to a popular audience with the sophistication that it does, and without  2-dimensional characters, is a first-rate achievement.

Recommended with enthusiasm.  If  Christian fundamentalists denounce the existential perspective of the film, this would be a regrettable missed chance for dialogue.  No one, save the brilliant Hypatia, looks good in this rich film.",1288051200,2,4290,5.03257790368272
4109248,5,B003CI2G6S,"I would have liked to have seen Agora in a theater; but the film played in such a limited number of theaters and for such a short time that it was not possible to see it.  I read about Hypatia some years ago and thought that her story would make a good drama. When I learned about this film, I was excited to see it.

Alexandria had a turbulent history under the Romans with the Greeks, Jews and Christians at each other's throats.  The culmination of the violence came when the emperor Theodosius I declared Christianity as the official state religion.  Pagan faiths that had been tolerated before were now subjected the same persecution that the Christians had endured in earlier centuries.

(There are minor spoilers in the next two paragraphs)
The film opens with a scene where Hypatia is teaching her students about the movement of the planets. This is the focus for Hypatia's teaching although as a neo-Platonist her subjects would have been more diverse.  Orestes, very well played by Oscar Issac, is one of Hypatia's students and openly declares her love for her but is rebuffed by her.  Hypatia class holds Christians and pagans, and she stresses that with her they are all brothers, not members of different religious faiths.

Hypatia has an interesting relationship with a slave named Davus (played with sensitivity by Max Minghella).  When Davus declares himself a Christian Hypatia's father (a high official in the cult of Seraphis) punishes Davus. However, Hypatia looks after Davus and presents him to her class when he creates a model of the universe. Symbolically, when the Christian's storm the Seraphium Hypatia frees Davus. The film departs from the facts of Hypatia's life in presenting her death, poetically, at the hands of Davus instead of a mob of Christians. I liked the change for the loving kindness that Hypatia's former slave has for her in order to spare her a painful death.

Rachael Weisz succeeds in brining Hypatia to life. She is passionate about her teaching and learning and sticking to her principles as the world she has known is being destroyed. The scenes that come to mind are those where she is with her students and where she puzzles over the precise movements of the planets. Michael Lonsdale is very good as Hypatia's father.

Alejandro Amenabar is to be congratulated for this powerful film. The production is very good particularly with the re-creation of the Serapeum. The riot scenes are nicely staged and the costumes very nicely designed with the period in mind. Agora is a film covering a period of time that is rarely portrayed in film.  Hypatia is one of the rare women of antiquity who steps beyond the bounds that men set for women. Being able to see a film celebrating her life is an event in itself.",1287964800,2,2759,4.7974683544303796
4109249,5,B003CI2G6S,"I admit to copious tears at the end of this movie and it was not just because the ending was so sad with everyone who was loving and honorable being destroyed by religion. What saddened me the most is that we haven't changed much in 1700 years.  At least Hypatia has finally gotten her due and the Bishop of Alexandria, ""St. Cyril"" his. I wouldn't be surprised if a few Catholic churches dedicated to him don't change their name if this film gets much attention.

How can you possibly talk about this film without discussing the history behind it?? I don't think you can because that is its beauty. Its true.  Amenabar recreates the city and the violence that surrounded the Library of Alexandria in the 400's with a broad but honest brush. It was a complex time of religious intolerance born partially of the political manipulations of rulers who were being forced to deal with the social and economic crumbling of the Roman Empire.

At this point in time, Christianity had taken on a kind of ""social welfare"" role that was attracting many adherents. Amenabar concentrates more on Christianities philosophical influence which given the level of violence and intolerance, was at best poorly understood by the people. As the Christian segment grows in power, he shows us how the discord between it and the city's Jewish and Pagan factions explode in the form of murderous encounters.

We meet the beautiful Hypatia teaching a group of obviously well-off young men as the film opens. When the violence starts she is the voice of logic and peace, but with the exception of the actual sacking of the library, she remains concerned almost solely with her science throughout the film and is an innocent victim of intolerance. Hers is the rational mind with no will to power. It is a mind dedicated to ideals rather than the dogma of any faith. Most of the  dramatic content comes from the struggle of those around her to maintain their honor and loyalty in the face of increasingly deadly threats from the Christian mobs.

Her ability to immerse herself in her science is dramatized by her devotion to experiments and breaks from the movie in which the camera pulls out and views the earth from space give us a feel for the scope of her mind. These interludes not only give us an interesting perspective on the difference between her thinking and that of zealots like Cyril, they are also used to provide written historical information about what is about to take place in the next segment.

Amenabar keeps us hooked on the action as one side and then the other exacts its revenge. As the movie draws to its end we focus on the inner moral dilemma of Orestes, the Roman civil authority who supported Hypatia and the cities Pagan intellectuals. Cyril bates him into refusing to submit to ""Gods"" (Cyril's) authority in front of a crowd and turns the mob against him. Narrowly escaping with his life, Amenabar cuts between his internal struggle and that of Hypatia's former slave, as he renounces his new found Christianity in a last ditch attempt to save his former owner.

The movie ends with Hypatia's death amid a group of ignorant, filthy, men who call her a witch and a whore. Their hooded faces remind us that we stand on the verge of hundreds of years of intellectual darkness that may not have ended yet.",1287878400,,3304,4.70242214532872
4109250,5,B003CI2G6S,"If there was ever a such a thing as an atheist saint, Hypatia would be it. Each year atheists flock to Lake Hypatia (Alabama) for their annual meeting and softball game of atheists vs. agnostics. This movie is a dramatization of historical events. The city of Alexandria was a center for learning. It was said that the philosophical and religious discourse among the merchants and general population in the agora were on a very educated level, that which rivaled the scholars. With the onset of Christianity, the religious discussion changed. Religion was primarily based upon cosmic myths, most of which had lost their original meaning due to the Pythagorean concepts which fused with the old religion creating multiple paradoxes as to generate such debate. Is God anthropomorphic or is God light?

Hypatia was a scientist and philosopher, she is portrayed as an atheist in this film, although her religious belief is uncertain. She may very well had been a pagan. The menstrual cloth she presented to a would-be suitor is recorded in history. The movie is long and at times doesn't move along fast enough. For that reason I downgraded from five stars to four. I thought it needed better editing. Apart from the dramatization, the movie sticks to history. The documentary commentary writing on the screen is white on a predominately white background which made it difficult for me to read with old eyes and an analog TV. I had to pause it.

For those of you who loved watching Rachel Weisz's nude hind parts in ""The Brothers Bloom"", she once again flaunts her fanny for the screen. Did it get bigger or did they use a body double? Agora is a common word used in crossword puzzles with the clue ""Greek Marketplace.""",1287878400,2,1715,4.829931972789115
4109251,5,B003CI2G6S,"I can't believe I never heard of this movie until it popped up as a recommended title on a movie rental site I subscribe to. This is a beautifully-made period/ historical drama which is set in the 4th century A.D. in Alexandria. The central character in this story is Hypatia (played by Rachel Weisz) a renowned female scholar who taught philosophy, astronomy, and mathematics. Though Hypatia is beautiful and desirable to males (having many male admirers), she is quite oblivious to this effect she has on men, preferring to immerse herself in scholarly pursuits.

Some of her male admirers are Davus (Max Minghella), who happens to be her slave; there's the Christian student, Synesius (Rupert Evans); and finally, the openly admiring Orestes (Oscar Isaac) who declares his love for Hypatia during a public gathering - her reaction to this? By offering him a 'token' in the form of a rag smeared with her menstrual blood, a blatant and obvious message of rejection. There are more serious things explored in this drama than romantic pursuits. Alexandria is in the midst of a serious conflict between the pagan aristocracy to which Hypatia and her father belong, and the rising Christian militant movement called the Parabolani. The Jews are sort of caught in the middle, and the divisions between the upper and lower classes, as well as slaves, further exacerbates the situation.

Fast forward a couple of years, and the library at Alexandria is now a holding pen for animals - a man named Cyril is the Patriarch of Alexandria, i.e. the leader of the Church; Orestes has converted to Christianity and is the Imperial Prefect of Alexandria, he is also dependent on Hypatia for her advice and appears to have set aside her rejection of him in the past; Synesius has risen to the position of Bishop; and Davus has joined the Parabolani. Hypatia continues to teach, though in a much diminished capacity - she also continues to fervently study the planets and their movement. Little does she realize the very real threat posed to her by the increasingly militant Christians who perceive her as a threat both because of her paganism and the influence she wields over the Prefect Orestes who is frequently at odds with Cyril.

I'm not sure as to how much of this movie is period authentic, but I was impressed by the quality of the sets, and the direction. The acting was also above average - Rachel Weisz was incredible in her role as the strong-willed scholar who was way ahead of her time in terms of being a respected female scholar, and in the way she thought not only about astronomy but also about faith ( in one insightful dialogue between Hypatia and Synesius, she says, ""You do not question your beliefs, but I must."").

Is this movie anti-Christian? I do not believe so - I think it portrays the events (based on whatever sources are still available) as they occurred during that period. Both the militant Christians, the black-robed Parabolani, and the Jews are depicted as being in conflict with each other -acts of stoning abound in this movie (must have been the favorite method of retaliation at the time?). More interestingly, I looked at this movie as depicting the conflict between religion and science, an age-old conflict that persists to this day. How much do we take on faith, and how much of science can truly explain all there is to be explained? Hypatia's theories about the movement of the planets was considered blasphemous, against Church teachings, yet time proved her theories had merit. I prefer to think of this movie as a thought-provoking drama that makes one ponder about the relationship between man, faith, and science.",1287792000,3,3652,4.857142857142857
4109252,5,B003CI2G6S,"A brilliant and beautiful film that goes in unexpected ways to move the viewer. Fine performances by all but Rachel Weiss stands as tall as the great lighthouse of Alexandria in a nuanced, deeply felt performance as Hypatia. the screenplay too is a star here and shows great insight and an unbiased look at religious intolerance by the three religious groups in Alexandria at the end of the Roman Empire.
 The realization of a gorgeous if slightly faded Alexandria is stunningly achieved in this film. Bringing to mind and even surpassing the sets of Joseph L Mankiewicz' 1963 'Cleopatra'. This city that stood as a beacon of learning, art, architecture and wonders seems to breath and move as if sixteen centuries were blown away by a magical wind from the desert.
  The film will raise a lot of questions in the minds of viewers who may have very fundamental beliefs in Judaism or Christianity and could be construed by the less astute as anti Christian. It is not. the film simply shows true events of the clash of belief at the end of the classical age. Many were guilty of barbarism in the name of their gods then, just as some are today.
  Finally the tragic end of the film is heart rending for not only the obvious reasons but for the fact that had men been more enlightened towards the wonders of the minds and brilliance of women we might be a lot further along in our evolution as a species than we are today.",1287619200,4,1420,4.53125
4109253,4,B003CI2G6S,"At the close of the 4th century AD, the Roman Empire turned on itself in a very fundamental way. For thousands of years, the ancient peoples of the Mediterranean world worshiped a multitude of deities, and participated in a variety of religious cults.  Religious violence was practically unknown.  A system of free inquiry, fostered in Classical Greece, continued unabated into at least the 3rd century of the Roman Empire.  With the conversion of the early 4th century Emperor Constantine, however, and the declaration that Christianity was the official religion of the Empire by his successor Theodosius at the end of the century, the ancient temples and shrines of the gods were overturned and destroyed, their priests killed or scattered, and , as Charles Freedman shows in his groundbreaking book ""The Closing of the Western Mind"", the Hellenic spirit of rational thought and free inquiry was snuffed out.  The last astronomical observation in antiquity was  made in the city of Alexandria in 476 AD. . .not until the 16th century would progress again move forward.  But even by the 5th century, inquiry was dead.  This film follows this destruction with some dramatic license, but , on the whole, stays faithful to the few facts we have.
  Hypatia (Rachel Weisz) is a philosopher who teaches in the Serapeion, the chief pagan temple in Alexandria and the location of the remaining library.  Two of her students, her slave, Davus (Max Minghella) and the aristocratic Roman Orestes (Oscar Isaac) are in love with her, but despondent, knowing that she has vowed herself to virginity, as she is of the Platonic view that the body is corrupt and that only the soul is of value.  As she ponders the true nature of the cosmos, beginning to doubt taht the earth is at it's center at a time when such a thought was deemed ridiculous, she fails to see the wholesale destruction of her world even as it comes hurtling at her headlong.  In the streets of Alexandria, more and more people are converting to the new state religion of Christianity, while it's leaders begin to exhort them to ""smash the idols of the heathens"", the same temples their ancestors had worshipped in for generations.  As the Serapeion is besieged and Hypatia's family and household become unglued, she clings to her beloved principles and tries to carry on.  Soon enough, though, such a thing becomes impossible.
  The film is a bit heavy handed in it's raison d'etre. . .but it is never saccharine, nor nostalgic for a ""better time"".  The pagan world, as is shown, is completely at home with slavery and reactionary cruelty ; there is no ""good guy"" here, other than Hypatia, though her flaws are laid plain as well. The notion that the early Christians were all about lions laying down with lambs, turning the other cheek, and loving their neighbor is also firmly quashed. The only thing these people seem to imagine Christianity demands is blind faith that Jesus, the rabbi who lived and died almost four hundred years before the film opens, is their savior.  The destruction of pagan shrines, and non-believers themselves, does not bother them in the slightest.  The movie makes it plain that the world did not necessarily become a better place after Constantine, a man who's own behavior was hardly Christian in our modern sense of the word. It has been stated that Hypatia died because of a political struggle between the city governor and the Christian Bishop, not for a religious reason.  This misses the essential point.  There was no separation of Church and State (or temple and state) in the ancient world.  The Bishop feared the continuing influence of a non-Christian on a nominally Christian politician.  The crowds were roused to believe that to be unconverted was to be in the thrall of Satan.  Thus, she had to go.  The strongest point the film drives home is that as soon as monotheism becomes compulsory, the logical conclusion is that all dissenters are offensive to God, and must be removed.",1287532800,2,3981,4.870919881305638

Overall I think this film is fantastic.

Alexandria was the physical terrain where truly the debate between devotional faith and logical reason consolidated.

Logical science belonged to the Hellenic descendants and faithful religion to the emerging Christians. It was as rebellion against the ruling mind.

This movie is about the place in history where religion and science started to struggle.

The killings was done by those who immediately beneficiated from them.  The powers that became never got physically stained with Hypatia's blood so nothing can be proved. Maybe a, lost in time, discreet absolution behind a wall or two would be the link.

The acting is wonderful, very believable, the actors draw you in. I'm curious to find out if Rachel Weisz won any awards for her performance, would be very well deserved.

4109257,5,B003CI2G6S,"This movie impressed me -- It explores the conflict between science and fanaticism and takes the theme that we are all more similar than different yet our differences in perspective lead us to hate each other. There's action and violence, but unlike so many other Roman Empire films, the violence is an expression of the issues, rather than the point of the movie. Romance is present too, as unfulfilled longings that drives several characters. It's refreshing to see life in the ancient world presented with accuracy and enough detail to really feel yourself there.

It makes unobtrusive use of cgi to recreate a sense of gritty street life in ancient Alexandria and also some cosmic metaphors. My two favorites are the zoom in from space that contrasts the vast calm of cosmos with the tiny, intense conflict between the Alexandrians and the view of the dome that shows how an ""imperfect"" ellipse is really just a perfect circle from a different perspective.

I was surprised to read so many reviews that seemed to think the movie made the Christians out to be the bad guys. What I saw happening was what was going historically at the time and with which, in one introductory line, the movie began: (paraphrased)""Jews and Christians came into town and the trouble began.""

The history is so interesting and so relevant to what we are seeing today. It's a shame so many seem to have missed this in the movie and saw the problem as being with ""the Christians"" or with Christianity--there was after all a brutal massacre of the Christians by the Jews depicted in the film as well. A better conclusion might be that if there is a problem with religion perhaps it is more specifically with Middle Eastern/Abrahamic religion--Judaism, Christianity, Islam. Isn't it these three that have been at root of the most religious strife in history (starting all the way back with the occupation and genocide of and in Canaan, if you believe the Tanack/Old Testament stories?)

There is so much historically of interest in this film to the history buffs out there, but much is no doubt lost to the average viewer who probably just buys into(or argues against) the ""Christians is bad"", or ""religion is bad, in general"" perceived storyline. My hope is that perhaps interest has been sparked among individuals who have seen the movie and who will then go on to want to learn more, and that more films like ""Agora"" will be made. This is a movie I know I will want to see again and again to mine the depths of the historical record portrayed. Left me wanting more.",1282003200,14,1723,4.627450980392157

The storyline, of which there are several from which scholars may choose, is one that in every possible instance condemns the Alexandrian Christians of the time. There's no settled agreement on exactly what was done and by whom in this historical episode -- although most modern scholars agree that Cyril was unfairly impugned by a later writer who not only wasn't there, but was unfriendly to Christianity generally and Cyril in particular. Indeed the events themselves may not have occurred, at least as we see them here. (A scene in which Cyril rehearses some of the weakest possible modern arguments against women priests, for example, is laughable.) But people believe what they need to believe. For those inclined against historical Christianity, the storyline will be reassuring. For those interested in knowing more about Cyril and his thoughtful contributions to theology, there is nothing to see in this film.
