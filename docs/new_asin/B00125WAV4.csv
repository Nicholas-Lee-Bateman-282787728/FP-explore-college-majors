3076983,5,B00125WAV4,BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 3 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER AND SHE LOVES IT. THERE ARE SOME CHARACTERS THAT JUST GO ON FROM ONE GENERATION TO THE NEXT. GUMBY IS ONE OF THEM. HAPPY TO SEE THAT GUMBY AND POKEY ARE ALIVE AND WELL IN DVD TO ENJOY FOR MANY YEARS TO COME. MAYBE ONE DAY HER CHILDREN WILL GET JOY FROM THIS AS I DID WHEN I WAS YOUNG AND MY DAUGHTERS DID AND NOW OUR GRANCHILDREN DO. GOOD WHOLESOME FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT!,1336953600,,414,4.1234567901234565
3076984,5,B00125WAV4,"This movie was suggested to me by Amazon & after reading the great reviews I rented it from my library. Since that day my 21, now 22 month old daughter has watched it every day! Usually more than once a day too, just not all at once. I didn't grow up watching Gumby so I had no clue what to expect & can't compare it to anything but I do know that I like it.

Good morals:
Gumby is a nice guy, and so are his friends. They go out of their way to help people in need. They also seem to be vegetarians. Outside the barn where Gumby & The Clayboys practice their band, they have their own vegetable garden. Someone even mentions a ""carrot, cucumber, tomato"" sandwich at one point, which is awesome, because we eat sandwiches like that in our home! My little family doesn't eat animal flesh or anything derived from animals, so I think this aspect of the movie is especially great! So many times I see animated characters munching on a chicken leg or something equally offensive and it just makes me cringe. Not this movie! My daughter eats a lot of vegetables; so do the cool characters on Gumby. Win, win for everyone! This healthy food message is in the background, but it's still a big deal to me.

Sword fights, a band (and the music is a great break from ""kid"" music which can get annoying) evil robots, dancing, books & more. This show is unique and there are a lot of things I and my toddler like about it. Here is an excellent excerpt about this movie from Wikipedia's page on Gumby, ""In it, the villainous Blockheads replace Gumby and his band with robots and kidnap their dog, Lowbelly. The movie featured in-joke homages to such sci-fi classics as Star Wars, The Terminator, and 2001: A Space Odyssey.""

I don't think this movie is too scary, violent or emotional for young viewers if you explain to them several of the scenes and if they understand what pretend is. Every kid is different though of course. My almost-two-year-old runs from the TV sometimes to find me saying she's scared, takes my hand, and wants to watch the movie while sitting on my lap. She enjoys the spookier aspect of things though normally, and Gumby is no exception. She holds on to me tightly & screams with a smile on her face. For those who don't like a little scary/dark you may have a problem with some of it. I know MY mom would say some parts are ""icky.""

I'm looking forward to seeing more Gumby. Now I've got to go out & buy a few DVDs because once this one goes back to the library I know I'm not going to hear the end of it until another one is my daughter's hands! Thanks Gumby for being a great polite guy without being an annoying little prick. Bravo!",1298505600,,2650,4.336693548387097
3076985,5,B00125WAV4,We got this movie on VHS about 15? years ago--the kids were mesmerized.  I actually loved watching it with them.  The we lost it--anyway--I was so happy when I found it on Amazon--I bought it for Christmas--Nieces and kids range from 12-20--and everyone's been watching it--it is the wildest thing--who knows what they were on when they made this movie--lol.  Would recommend for any age.,1294790400,,388,4.938461538461539
3076986,4,B00125WAV4,"I remember this movie when it came out. I originally owned this movie on VHS. I was in elementary school at the time and loved Gumby, so I had my parents buy it the moment I found it. Now, even as a young child, I was more partial to the 1950's and 1960's episodes and did not care so much for the 1980's episodes. However, this movie, while a continuation from the 1980's formula, is just great in many ways I just can't describe. It is too bad that those 1980's episodes had to be made when they were. Perhaps they would've made a better impression if those episodes were made after a feature film such as this one was produced.

As for the movie, Gumby has a new band, ""The Clayboys"". The mascot of the band is a dog named Lowbelly, not to be confused with Gumby's original dog Nopey, who only says ""no"". While giving a concert in the park, the Blockheads discover that Lowbelly cries pearls when Gumby and his band performs. So, the troublesome duo plot to kidnap Lowbelly, Gumby and the Clayboys and try to get rich quick off of pearl sales. Of course, Gumby prevails with help from his friends Pokey, Prickle, Goo and a new friend (romantic interest) named Tara.

The only reason I did not give this movie 5 stars is because it is not exactly as I remember seeing it. This is supposedly the Director's Cut. If that is really the case, then why wasn't this version the one originally released. I do agree that some of the scenes cut were not significant, but some of the cuts do take away plot elements that will only leave the viewer asking questions if they had not seen the version originally released on VHS.

As for the special features, all the deleted scenes from the original are present, plus one scene that never made it to the original. There are also 4 episodes from the TV series, being ""Tree Trouble"" from the 1950's, in which Gumby and Pokey go searching for buried treasure, but instead learn a lesson through a fable told by a wise old owl. The other three episodes are from the 1980's, being ""Melon Felons"", ""As the Worm Turns"" and ""Robot Farm"", which I honestly don't think are all that great. They certainly could've made better choices in selecting bonus episodes.",1292630400,,2190,4.456359102244389
3076987,4,B00125WAV4,"This was really cute. I bought it for my grandchilren. I had bought them Gumby and Pokey figures and this helps them put a personality to them. They were totally entertained. Don't expect this to be up to todays standards of animation, though. The story line and action are perfect for little ones and those of us who remember the original series, whether you watched it in the 50's, 60's or 80's. My grandson loves the Clayboys music video.",1285545600,,441,4.594936708860759
3076988,2,B00125WAV4,"The movie arrived when it was supposed to.
My son enjoys the movie although I don't think that the soundtrack is very child friendly as it's overly loud with screaming rock guitars. We have the gumby essentials dvd which contains episodes from the 1950's- 1980's and that's a better purchase in my opinion.",1285545600,,306,4.7924528301886795
3076989,5,B00125WAV4,Great movie quality picture and most entertaining movie. Shipping was fast and nicely packed. Thank you *****,1218585600,,109,5.470588235294118
3076990,5,B00125WAV4,"It's great to see ""Gumby: The Movie"" finally released on DVD.  This director's cut doesn't appear to have any new scenes.  Instead, several scenes have been edited out (though they are still available as extras).  Some of these edits actually remove minor plot points, so I wish they would have just released the original version.

Also, watch out for that Gumby figure that comes in the package.  Mine was starting to 'melt' and there was some oily plastic inside the case.  I ended up just throwing the figure away.

Overall I prefer the original movie, but I'm glad to have this on DVD regardless.  Bring on the next Gumby movie in 2010!",1214438400,2,640,4.651785714285714
3076991,4,B00125WAV4,"I bought this DVD as a little treat for my birthday. I was unsure about what the director's cut would do to this movie and, despite not seeing it for a while, I knew what was going to be in it.
For the most part, the Director's Cut was a an improvement over the original. Art Clokey and the editor that helped him knew what to cut and how to do it without calling attention to itself. There were a few cuts that felt abrupt and, knowing what was supposed to come next made it obvious for me what was cut. Also, a few continuity bloopers came about due to the cutting. However, these new bloopers are not more noticable than the bloopers that were present. Most importantly, this new cut gets rid of scenes that, quite frankely, just bogged the film down and were never needed. This film works without the cut scenes and is more enjoyable than the first cut, which I enjoyed very much as well. My only big complaint was that it cut out No Buckle's (the yellow Clayboy with white hair) first big scene and he doesn't get a line until the middle of the film. For the most part, however, this film rocked (and to be fair, most fans of Gumby are tuning in for Gumby, Goo, Pokey, and Prickle, not the new characters).
If you're reading this and sweating that you're favorite scenes were cut, never fear, because they are all included in a deleted scenes section. Between the movie and the deleted scenes section, the first cut is included on the DVD. There's an added treat, as a scene that was never a scene in the movie is included (it's a scene with Minga and Gumba, right before Gumby is seen cleaning the fire truck).
The greatest special feature are the four Gumby episodes. It includes one from the 50s and three 80s ones. They're were all enjoyable, and two of the 80s ones included Denali the mastadon and Tilly the Chicken. Very good episodes.
If you're a Gumby fan, you'll want this DVD. I absolutly love this movie and this DVD is a great tribute to Gumby. Buy it.
I almost forgot...it includes a little Gumby toy. How much better can it get? (That was rhetorical, don't answer that :) ).",1209081600,14,2094,4.371794871794871
3076992,5,B00125WAV4,"I was lucky enough to see Gumby the Movie in the theater when it was released. I liked it so much I saw it three times! This is a wonderful film for parents to share with their children. Gumby does not try to be ""edgy"" or include adult humor meant to fly over kid's heads and make their parents laugh. It is a sincere, non-cynical story with great imagination and a clear sense of what is right and what it wrong. It is also very cute! You will get to meet Gumby's dog named Lowbelly. Lowbelly's belly is so low to the ground he rolls around on a skateboard! You also meet Gumby's bandmates Fatbuckle, Thinbuckle, and No Buckle. This movie will put a smile on your face and a song in your heart. If you are an adult, it will make you feel young again. If you are a kid, this will be the movie that makes you fall in love with Gumby and his friends. With so much entertainment aimed at children that is not really appropriate for them out there now, it is great to have a movie like this. You can feel safe showing it to your kids and you will also enjoy it yourself.",1206921600,7,1066,4.105263157894737

3077039,3,B00125WAV4,"I bought this film unaware that it was the directors cut. I still have the original release on VHS tape and I thought I could upgrade to DVD. I started to watch the DVD and felt that the film was rushed and was missing some important parts. I then realized it was the Directors Cut, and that is why it was shorter and missing scenes! After finding this out I stopped the DVD and put the VHS in. I didn't want to miss out on anything and I wanted the full experience I had as a child. I will continue to use the VHS and will not put the DVD back in, as there was NO NEED TO CUT THE SCENES.

It kind of drove me crazy but not as much as when it disappeared from our queue. We searched everywhere for an instant alternative but could find none... finally decided it would be best to just buy the DVD. She simply has to have it. I think I'll invest in some headphones too. At least then she'll be happy and I don't have to listen to it twice a day. Not that it's a bad movie; it's clever and all...",1383436800,,509,4.151515151515151

3311536,3,B00125WAV4,"I bought this film unaware that it was the directors cut. I still have the original release on VHS tape and I thought I could upgrade to DVD. I started to watch the DVD and felt that the film was rushed and was missing some important parts. I then realized it was the Directors Cut, and that is why it was shorter and missing scenes! After finding this out I stopped the DVD and put the VHS in. I didn't want to miss out on anything and I wanted the full experience I had as a child. I will continue to use the VHS and will not put the DVD back in, as there was NO NEED TO CUT THE SCENES. Even though they are in the Bonus Features, its not the same when they aren't part of the movie.",1343088000,14,685,3.9

8244075,4,B00125WAV4,"This is the youngest of the Gumby series and is far from the best. However, even though there are some moments that could be improved on, The Gumby Movie still delivers the timeless entertaining charm that the earlier decades of the Gumby series are so famous for.

This film follows the trend of the show by concentrating on Gumbys adventures. There are some light action scenes to keep these adventures exciting as well as a few jokes that the whole family can enjoy.

The Gumby Movies plot is about Gumby and his friends attempting to stage a concert. During the concert, two investors in the audience accidentally find out that Gumbys dog (Lowbelly) cries pearls when he listens to their music. They come up with a scheme to steal the dog and make thousands of dollars, but get discovered and Gumby and his friends have to save Lowbelly in one epic and complex adventure.

For the most part, this film really has a lot of great perks. The detail in the stop-motion clay animation really looks spectacular and mostly natural. The plot has lots of fun twists as well as quite a few references (i.e. one fighting scene contains light sabers in a ship that looks like it belongs in Star Wars) to other series that allows for a good laugh. The background soundtrack by Jerry Gerber fits the tune of the quirky cartoon well and adds a little spice to the movie as a whole. There are a few technical hiccups that can be improved on to make this film perfect. One example is the visible and obvious wires holding up some of the characters. Even though this film was made in 1995, wire removal editing tools have existed since the late 80s. At times, the animation lags quite a bit and could be sped up to make more fluid motions. Nevertheless, none of these little things ruin the watching experience, as The Gumby Movie still is a great film to watch with the family.

There are some filler scenes that don't do much to further the plot nor add any reoccurring elements to the story. Even though they sound bad, they are enjoyable and make it feel like several separate episodes, each with a unique adventure. My favorite scene takes place towards the beginning of the runtime when Pokey looks for Gumby everywhere. On his way, he passes by a slide. At the same time, two of Pokeys friends come out of the slide and run into him. The three turn into a big clay ball and need to go to the hospital to get un-separated. The scene has quite a few made up procedures that are both funny and realistic looking, which adds to the humor. Even though this has no purpose to the story, it still provides a few good laughs and, in general, is a fun mini-story.

The Gumby Movie can be a family movie but its main purpose is being a kids movie. For that reason, I recommend it for ages 8 to 18. I give The Gumby Movie 4.5 out of 5 stars because it has a few technical faults here and there, but still really provides a good quality Gumby feature film.
