5893484,5,B00E6FN0SY,The sound is very good.  The performance is very good.  Mariss  Jansons is enthusiastic.  The parts are easy to access.,1400889600,2,119,4.8
5893485,5,B00E6FN0SY,"This is a terrific Blue Ray set.  The picture and sound qualities are very good.  The orchestra is solid as a rock.  It is not listed on the top 20 orchestras of the world, but it could easily be - it is made up of truly first-rate musicians and they play as one.  Good orchestra.  There is a little surprise following the fifth symphony that could be missed if you don't allow the disc to play to the end - be sure to stick around.  Can't say anything bad about the discs.  But wish the notes accompanying each of the three discs had just a bit more information - like something about Jansons and the orchestra, but it's not really a disappointment in a terrific set of discs.",1399334400,5,677,4.2421875
5893486,5,B00E6FN0SY,Every aspect of these recordings is immensely satisfying.  From the meticulous care given to all technical aspects of the recording to the extremely tight ensemble and the high quality musicianship.  Just be sure to run your Blu-ray player's HDMI connection through a suitably equipped A/V receiver to fully realize the power and clarity of the audio.  Japan's Suntory Hall never sounded better.  Highly recommended.,1397001600,5,416,5.453125
5893487,5,B00E6FN0SY,"First, here I am refering only to video/audio recordings and not audio recordings; and second, I am refering only to complete sets and not to a particular individual symphony.
I own the Herbert von Karajan set (recorded between 1967 and 1972) and the Claudio Abbado set, both are very good and have their differences. I have no preference for a particular set other than the video quality favors the Abbados set and I like some symphonies with Karajan and others with Abbado. The Mariss Jansons set is much better in terms of video and sound quality and also has better subtitles for the ninth symphony.
Mariss Jansons is a superb conductor, very detailed and great sensitivity, with Russian and Austrian training. He was born in Latvia (part of the former Soviet Union, in a family of musicians, his father a conductor taught him play violin, his mother a singer). He started studies in conducting at the Leningrad Conservatory, and then continued in Vienna and in Salzburg with Herbert von Karajan. Karajan had invited Jansons to be his assistant with the Berlin Philharmonic, but the Soviet authorities blocked Jansons.
Jansons was appointed Associate Conductor of the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra (now the Saint Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra). Later, he was appointed music director of the Oslo Philharmonic. In 1992, Jansons was named principal guest conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1997, Jansons became the music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. Since 2003, Jansons began his tenure as chief conductor of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra.
In this set is like you are doing a good mixing of Karajan and Abbado. If you are going to have only one set, choose this one. But, if you can have the three, that is much better because you will get a full experience of these fantastic symphonies, and more important you will not get too much habituated to only one way of listening. That is why is so important always to listen to live performances and to remember how actual music sounds.",1396742400,21,2032,5.014792899408284
5893488,5,B00E6FN0SY,"In comparison with his earlier Beethoven, it is quite evident that Mariss Jansons has radically re-thought his approach to this symphonic cosmos. The results, captured live in brilliant audio and video (with excellent camera work) in Tokyos Suntory Hall in 2012, are magnificent. Jansons combines the best of two worlds in todays Beethoven interpretation: the transparency, crispness of detail and fleet tempi of the authentic school  without the flavor of period instruments which may not be pleasing (yet) to every ear  with the overwhelming big band splendor of the traditionalists. My benchmarks of cutting-edge readings are Norrington (CD, 2002) and Paavo J&auml;rvi (DVD, 2010). Among the recent predominantly traditional recordings, Thielemann (DVD 2010) has many good points. Jansons clearly bridges these extremes, and he does so with outstanding musicianship.

The Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, rejuvenated in the past decade or two, rightly uses divided (divisi) violins, and excels both in ensemble and in solo/group work: this is a world-class team of musicians, joyfully in tune with their music director and with each other. They are heard/seen in increasing or decreasing complements, perfectly balanced according to the different demands of each symphony. For example, there are four basses in the First and Second, six in the Eroica and so on. The different sound stages thus remain transparent throughout the set and the respective dynamic shades from ppp to fff are strikingly provided. During some pianissimo parts, you could hear the proverbial pin drop in Suntory Hall.

Both the First and Second are played as genuine Beethoven: the young lion roars in every bar, with sharp rhythmic accents and great detail in the orchestral voices: listen to the various interplays between strings and woodwinds. Jansons, by giving full weight to the early symphonies, contradicts the common mistake of underplaying them (Thielemann) and makes them, especially the Second, powerful companion pieces to the Eroica. The latter  listen to the bonus, an intense and revealing rehearsal of Jansons favorite symphony  is perhaps the best performance I have ever heard of this work. Everything is great, from the graceful yet grandiose first movement through the Marcia Funebre with piercing brass and percussion  the spiritual centerpiece of the symphony  and the martial, brassy Scherzo to the glorious finale, taken fairly fast, but with gravitas and grandeur. Upon repeated listening, I am spellbound from beginning to end.

The Fourth is fleet, but by no means a lightweight, songful with crisp accents  exquisite solos in the woodwinds  and a tender Adagio. Here and in the other symphonies Jansons finds some new details seldom heard before. The final perpetuum mobile is taken very fast, bordering on presto: a virtuosi showpiece for the musicians. The Fifth, again not dragging its feet, highlights the inner voices  listen to the minor key passages in the second movement and some particularly pleasing string cantilenas  and has a breathtaking transition from the eerie pizzicato in the third movement to the unabashed bombast of the finale. In the Sixth, the strings and woodwind figurations shine out again. It is joyful, not plodding and quite triumphant at the end. I find only the second movement  Scene at the Brook  a bit too lovingly slow, but this is a matter of taste.

There is plenty of energy and dance-like spring in the Seventh. Maestro Jansons actually becomes airborne here and elsewhere -- reminiscent of Leonard Bernsteins heyday -- though he always remains focused on the music. With sharp accents in the first movement, I still wished for a little more power in the brass against the wall of seven basses. The second movement is a gem. The contrast between darkness and light is amazing, lots of tragic undertones emerge, and, surprisingly, this becomes the monumental axis of the symphony. The Scherzo with its chiseled Trio could not be better, and the finale stays in tempo with the third movement. Toward the end, Jansons accelerates and pushes his musicians toward their limits. The Eighth, once again, is no lightweight. Sheer power and elegance are in balance, the brass and timpani rightly prominent. After the graceful middle movements, the Allegro Vivace finale is taken at breakneck speed, leaving the listener breathless.

In the Ninth, we have the full complement of the orchestra joined by the excellent Chor des Bayerischen Rundfunks. It becomes clear that this is the cycles crowning glory already in the first movement with strident accents in the strings, plangent interjections by the woodwinds and brass, and cataclysmic moments in the recapitulation. There is a strong overtone of pain, and I never heard the final bars equally devastating. The second movement, an eerie presto (taken literally), has a stunning dialog between strings and timpani, only the horns are not quite on the same exalted level. The slow movement has the perfect tempo, it never drags despite the many variations and projects sheer serenity and peace. Surprisingly, Jansons does not pause before he launches into the finale. When the strings, from the basses up to the violins, gradually intone the Freude motif, ascending from ppp to fff, you know that this is a highly significant moment for all involved: everything sounds absolutely right. The soloists are very good, perhaps not stellar  but who is, given Beethovens merciless demands. The final minutes are overwhelming.

My fellow-reviewer S. Swellander is right: there is no definitive Beethoven symphonies set, and there never will be. Performance trends are constantly in flux, and so are our own, much more personal perceptions of music. For the foreseeable future, though, Maestro Jansons has given us a set to treasure.",1393027200,24,5818,5.2770562770562774
5893489,5,B00E6FN0SY,"Best sound I've heard yet. 192k sound is better even than Brahms #2,
Schumann 4 symphonies or Dausgard and the National Danish
Orchestra, all 48K.  Performances are excellent, and wide
dynamic range makes whisper-soft pppp possible, in fact my
only criticism is the exaggerated pppp first statement of the
""Ode To Joy"" on the 9th.  Video is also great---want to see the
broken fuzz on the string bows?  The Orchestra traveled all the
way to Japan to record in this hall, and it was worth it. You won't
need a millionaire's sound system to appreciate this set, plus it's
a price per minute bargain. Great confluence of hall, engineering
and superb orchestra.",1384560000,18,657,4.848214285714286
5893490,5,B00E6FN0SY,"I had about sworn off buying any more Beethoven symphony sets. Box sets have become so cheap and downloads even cheaper that I have assembled an embarrassingly large collection on my shelf and hard drive. How many cycles does one need? For video I have the Karajan DVD sets as well as Abbado. Paavo Jarvi with his Bremen orchestra on DVD intrigues me, but enough!

Then came Mariss Jansons on blu-ray. I had considered replacing my Claudio Abbado DVD Beethoven box on Medici Arts with the newly issued blu-ray edition, and then there's Christian Thielemann, whose blu-ray cycle I have seen and was not that moved by. But Jansons--I had never heard him conduct Beethoven, but I do admire many of his recordings. The Jansons/Beethoven blu-ray box was sitting there in the meager classical bin at a Saturn electronics store in Germany, and I had read some of the promotional ads about these concerts being a landmark to celebrate Janson's 70th birthday, yada, yada. I owned no Beethoven symphonies on blu-ray! Tragic, right? I had to break out a wad of euros and spring for it.

How happy I am that I did. These are really marvelous performances and a treat to hear and watch in HD. Christian Thielemann's set with the Vienna Philharmonic was marred by some erratic tempo changes and just structural oddities that did not make sense to me. I think he might have done well to wait until his seventieth birthday to commit his Beethoven cycle to posterity. Beethoven's symphonies require considerable maturity in a conductor. Claudio Abbado, the other blu-ray candidate, has recorded these symphonies many times, and his video traversal was a real departure from his previous cycles, a rethinking of the works in light of new scholarship. The Berlin Philharmonic plays beautifully, and the whole set was a wonderful welcome back for the conductor following his battle with cancer. It is a fascinating, well considered set, yet for me not a go-to set. It leaves me a tad cold. I only listen to it to watch it.

So, to Mariss Janson and the Bavarian Radio Orchestra. There are so many ways to approach Beethoven's symphonies, and I could never live with just one set. I don't subscribe to a particular school--authentic performance, grand gesture Furtwangler style, text-faithful Toscanini, middle European or whatever. I like certain recordings from all of these ""isms."" They all add to our understanding and appreciation of this great composer. What Mariss Jansons brings is a bit of nearly all of them. The BRO, of course, plays on modern instruments, and plays incredibly well on this recording. These are all just splendid live performances. There is a silky warmth of tone in these performances that reminds me of the best of Rafael Kubelik's recordings with this ensemble (though with different players). Like Abbado, Jansons generally adopts fairly swift tempos, which is becoming a new standard based on modern scholarship, and they are well judged throughout. As was Kubelik's practice with the same orchestra, Jansons has divided the strings so that counter melodies are more clearly defined. Depending on the symphony, his orchestra tends to be a more traditional in size, so he has made judicious choices between authentic practice and later performing traditions. Rather than taking sides in the authentic vs traditional debate, he seeks what he thinks is best for the music. The orchestra and chorus for the 9th symphony is grandly proportioned.

There is a real sense of occasion in these performances, especially the 9th. His Japanese audience at the spacious Suntory Auditorium are ecstatically enthusiastic at the end of each work and quiet when the music calls for it. The HD sound is simply gorgeous in PCM stereo and DTS surround. It is full, warm and spacious with almost perfect balance, except for occasional blasts of the brass in the 9th, a difficult work to mike live. The Suntory acoustics are captured beautifully.

I'm a classical listener, not a trained musician who can follow scores and vouch for fidelity to the composer's intentions, but I can tell basically if a performance makes sense on its own terms. In performance after performance in this set, I kept feeling that Jansons' tempos and dynamics just worked. Often he starts movements more briskly than I am accustomed to, but he then proceeds to convince me. The orchestra follows him like a dream, and the players convey a palpable sense of joy in performing--a sincere connection with and trust in their director. Also, Mariss Jansons, unlike many conductors, is telegenic, the smiling music director you would love to perform with. Of course, the sound of the music is most important, but if you are committing yourself to viewing a conductor for hours through nine symphonies, it's nice to have someone who is fun to watch rather than a visual distraction.

Mariss Janson's recordings of the Beethoven symphonies with the Bavarian Radio Orchestra may not be definitive--the scope and breadth of the alternatives is so vast that the word ""definitive"" is really useless, but it is immensely satisfying, and to my eyes and ears the best available in high definition video. The cumulative experience of these beautifully recorded live performances is a special event. Don't miss it. Happy Birthday, Maestro Jansons!",1384387200,63,5299,5.022753128555176

8602058,3,B00E6FN0SY,I own over 44 Beethoven Symphony cycles on audio cd and 4 on DVDs. My favorite of the 9 symphonies is #9. My first experience listening to the symphony was back in 1968 when I heard Eugene Ormandy conduct the BSO at Tanglewood. I purchased this current cycle because of the ravings of the Ninth Symphony by others. I thought the performance was a 5 out of a possible 10. To date I'm partial to Leonard Bernsteins performance in Berlin in 1989 of the symphony. It showed passion and power. Karajan's 1963 and Solti's 1980 performances are also excellent. Mariss Janson is without equal when comes to his Tchaikovsky Cycle.,1441584000,,621,4.654545454545454

But what really makes this Blu Ray DVD outstanding is the sound (and video of course). It's the best I've ever heard on any music DVD (and of course better than any CD). I have an older Blu Ray player, a $2,000 amp/preamp, and $3,000 stereo speakers. I think it's worth its high price for the joy it delivers listening to it (and watching it).",1434326400,,436,4.602564102564102
8602061,5,B00E6FN0SY,"Background:  I am a non-professional principal clarinet player who has participated several years in a mediocre community orchestra.  I do not claim to be a music critic.  I have personally played Beethoven Symphonies 1, 3, 5, and 6.  My favorites are 3 and 6.
Jansons is an amazing conductor.  His conducting style is almost always musically intuitive to me.  (I might change that to ""always"" if I had actually been been there for his rehearsals.)
For me, it would be awesome and inspiring to have the experience of sitting under his direction.
I normally do not watch bonus features, but I found the documentation of the rehearsal of the 3rd symphony to be as interesting as the actual symphonies themselves.  I watched it twice.  Also, look for the encore following the 5th.
I have viewed numerous Beethoven symphonies on DVD.  The Blu-Ray video and audio are far superior.  An amazing experience!",1432857600,8,900,4.900662251655629

You feel the joy they bring to making the music, the videography is just as impressive as the sound quality. In the blue ray format with the high res sound and video, you truly are there on stage and in the audience.

In my review of Fischer's recording I list Jansons, Jaervi and Fischer, among the top three best recordings of Beethoven's Nine Symphonies. Jansons is helped by the Bavarian Radio orchestra and singers to produce a seamless interpretation of a very demanding and sophisticated score. Also the cameras do an outstanding job in capturing and consistently delivering to the viewer the relevant moments of the entire performance from the Tokyo Suntory Hall, one of the best acoustics venues.",1430006400,4,581,5.258064516129032
