After Cheryll went clothes shopping (which I fast forwarded through), she stopped by Dufflet Pastries. The cupcakes looked tasty (though it was only rated a 3.5 out of 5 on Yelp). She also visited the Steam Whistle Brewery and the Chinese Lantern Festival (Toronto has a large Chinese population).

She passed by the posh neighborhood of Yorkville, which reminded me of New York's Upper East Side. She also stopped by Yonge-Dundas Square, which is like Times Square and London's Piccadilly Circus. She later visited the Eaton Center Mall, which is the third largest mall in Canada (Yelp: 3.5).

Her last stop was the Hockey Hall of Fame. Canadians are crazy about hockey, but I don't know anything about it. She mentioned Wayne Gretzky, Bobby Orr, and Gordie Howe. I know who Wayne Gretzky is, only because he's hockey's version of Michael Jordan and because he played for my hometown team (NY Rangers). I never heard of the other two guys. My favorite sports are baseball, basketball, and football. They had a display of the Stanley Cup and some interactive exhibits.

Toronto isn't London, Paris, or Tokyo, but it's an interesting city.",1409011200,,1406,4.845833333333333
