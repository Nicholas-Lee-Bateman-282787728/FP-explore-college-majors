3152812,5,B00166M8K2,"On this DVD, instructor Jules Benson offers a routine in which she puts a unique spin on many traditional Pilates mat exercises.  The Main Main offers options for Play All, Introduction (a short overview by Benson), The Workout, Stretch, and Credits.  The workout itself roughly breaks down into sections, as Benson moves through a warm-up, abs work, a legs series, back work, and the final stretches; although these are not specific menu chapters, I have used these breakdowns to describe each section below.  Benson teaches live with two background exercisers, Kristin and Lisa, who shows some modifications.

WARM-UP (5 minutes)
For the warm-up, Benson has you started seated with the legs apart in a slight ""V.""  She does simple stretches in this position, including side bends and variations on Pilates moves (e.g., ""this is like the saw"").

ABS SERIES (17 minutes)
Benson starts here with a half roll-down, adding in a twist and a reach behind.  Moving very slowing, she performs simple knee-ins, adding in the arms, bridges, and toe dips.  Although the pace is never rushed, Benson flows from move to move for the hundred variation, criss-cross, roll-ups, scissors, one-leg teaser, and v-sit/roll-down combo.  The final moves include a reverse plank with knee in, rolling like a ball, knee drops/circles, leg pushes, rollover, and half-teaser.

LEG SERIES (15 minutes)
For the side lying work, Benson begins with leg up-down, adding in a double pulse at the top.  Next comes small circles, pointing to the front, flexing to the rear, and completing three total sets.  Additional moves including big circles, a version of hot potato, bicycles, and a knee dive/lift back.  Next, Benson works the inner thigh with lifts, hamstring curls, and pulses; the entire series is then repeated on the second side.

BACK SERIES (16 minutes)
Benson starts this segment with plank (option of keeping the knees on the floor), adding in a side tap.  Lying on the stomach, she performs alternate arm/leg raises and a superman variation.  On all fours, she raises one leg, adding in a triceps push-up, and then returns to lying prone for single leg kicks.  Coming back to all fours, she performs a bird-dog variation with a knee/elbow tuck.  Finally, she moves to kneeling for a side stretch, side plank with scoop/twist, and kneeling side crunch.

STRETCHES (4.5 minutes)
Benson starts in s seated wide-legged position, one leg in; she starts by bending over the straight leg for a hamstring stretch, then moves into a side stretch, quad stretch, inner thigh stretch, and twist to stretch the outer hip before repeating everything on the other side.  She finishes with a seated butterfly stretch.

This is a nice workout that is probably appropriate for advanced beginner to intermediate level Pilates practitioners.  Although the routine starts out slow, once Benson gets going, she does NOT pause to teach the moves at all, and she really does not provide much information on HOW to do the exercises, so a good pre-existing knowledge of Pilates is essential.  Otherwise, Benson is a down-to-earth, likeable instructor who cues well and is easy-to-follow.  Overall, I would give this DVD 4 1/2 stars.

P.S.--The music here is very similarly to Jari Love's original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Get-Ripped/dp/B000BTGY82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Get Ripped!</a>.

It's a deep, solid work-out, and very calming-- much like an hour at the ballet barre.  This has already toned me in about a week.  I found the routine on-demand, fell in love, and when it was no longer on tv I was frantic to find the DVD.

Jules's choreography is better than most Pilates workouts because each move works more than just one muscle group at a time, which helps to enhance the effect of the exercise. I like the twist on some of the classic Pilates moves.. It keeps me from getting bored. I have been doing this workout (alternating with Zumba and combined with a healthy diet) several times a week for the past few weeks and my body is becoming more toned all around... And I have lost a few pounds (wasn't trying to lose weight... was just trying to tone up and build muscle).
