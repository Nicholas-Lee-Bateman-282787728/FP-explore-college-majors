8258194,5,B0015FJYZQ,"wonderful synopsis of the development and creation of this beautiful place. A must for any FL Wright afficianado. There are essentially two parts: a history of FL Wright and then, part 2, the history of Taliesin West. Audio and video well done.",1498521600,,244,4.833333333333333
8258195,4,B0015FJYZQ,The documentary on cd is good with archival footage.  The panoramas are not compatible with newer operating systems and HD so it seems overpriced now.,1434499200,,150,5.0
8258196,4,B0015FJYZQ,"This DVD is good but not great.  I was somewhat disappointed.  The DVD has two segments:  52 minutes about Frank Lloyd Wright's life and architecture, and 30 minutes about Taliesin West (not including about 15 minutes of Taliesin West photos).  So although it's titled ""Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin West,"" it's mostly about Wright's life.

Narration is by Bruce Brooks Pfeiffer, who is certainly an expert on the topics covered here, but his enunciation is sometimes difficult to understand.  I also experienced some sound distortion when Mr. Pfeiffer spoke certain words, played at moderate volume.

The content is generally good.  I've read dozens of books about Wright's life, but still learned a thing or two from Mr. Pfeiffer.  He does a good job of covering the highlights (and lowlights) of Wright's almost 92-year life in 52 minutes.  The segment on Taliesin West focuses on the years when it was built, the living conditions in the desert, and activities of the apprentices.  It doesn't contain much information about current activities there, such as number of visitors, etc.",1325808000,5,1086,5.148571428571429
