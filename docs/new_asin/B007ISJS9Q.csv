5089568,5,B007ISJS9Q,"since I love every edition of foyle's war, of course if would love these (even though I already have them all in the sets I have).  I have written of my enjoyment of this series.  now all I want is to go to hastings and see Christopher foyle walking down the street in his long coat and the hat he wears as only he can wear it.  I can't review every episode/set of foyle's war because it just becomes redundant.  but never have I been so engaged in such a delightful, clever, suspenseful series.  and all written and directed by the same man.  I had hoped it was based on a book, but no.  so I just watch the dvd's over and over and over and....",1400544000,3,645,4.071428571428571
5089569,5,B007ISJS9Q,"FOYLES WAR, the WWII-era police drama starring the great Michael Kitchen continues to offer viewers superb drama in a period setting. The show has been rightfully lauded for its historical accuracy and high production values. It remains popular for many reasons, including its intelligence, literate scripts and thought-provoking performances. And lets not forget the air of melancholy about Christopher Foyle, which is central to Michael Kitchens performance, and which is subtly conveyed in the shows main theme played on that most melancholy-sounding of instruments, the oboe.

THE BEST OF FOYLES WAR is special, not the least because the episodes were selected by the series star, Michael Kitchen. As a producer of the show, Kitchen has a vested interest in the series success and there is no question his choices were thoughtfully made.

Perhaps to fully appreciate the artistry of Michael Kitchen  and hence the obvious care he took in compiling this collection  it is helpful to note that even as a boy, Kitchen stood out as an artist. He was head chorister (and thus a frequent soloist) in the Church of the Martyrs choir. After gaining acting experience with such distinguished organizations as the National Youth Theatre, Kitchen trained at the prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, where he not only won an award for outstanding talent and aptitude for the professional theatre, he was also discovered by a top talent agent. His professional career, therefore, began when he was in his early 20s, and his achievements since 1971 to the present have been considerable.

Kitchen is the kind of actor who can hold his own with anyone, yet he isn't a big star, at least in Hollywood terms. It is doubtful he wants to be, for he values his privacy and rarely gives interviews. His performing range is considerable and he packs every close-up in FOYLES WAR with a world-weariness and subtlety of thought that not only envelops the viewer, but also leaves critics grasping for superlatives.

With a new series of FOYLES WAR rumoured to begin filming in September of 2012, it is wonderful to have this Best of collection to remind us just how outstanding this show really is and why we should want to revisit it.

The six mysteries in this collection include numerous extras, including historical background (its amazing how the series writer/creator, Anthony Horowitz, has intertwined fact with fiction) and cast reflections.

One might not have the opportunity to sit down and have a chat with Michael Kitchen, but having his favourites episodes from a series so close to his heart is almost as good.  And heres hoping the rumour of further episodes is true!",1397433600,3,2668,5.031746031746032

5089572,5,B007ISJS9Q,I love the Foyle's War mysteries. This is the best show on TV/ I have watched them over and over again and never get tired. Foyle's War has to be the most authentic reproduction of the 40's and Michael Kitchen plays him to a British Tee. Can't get enough of Foyls's War.  I can't wait on 2013 to be released. I have already pre-ordered it.,1364860800,4,339,4.2153846153846155

5089575,5,B007ISJS9Q,"How did Foyle pick 6 `best' when all episodes are 6-star perfection? It's a good way to get initiated into Foyle's War, but let me warn you, the real deal is the 19 episode ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Foyle-s-War-Series-1-5-From-Dunkirk-to-VE-Day/dp/B0024OW1QQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Foyle's War: Series 1-5 - From Dunkirk to VE-Day</a>"" collection. Episodes are like eating chocolate covered peanuts, eat one after another and always want more.
This set is Foyle's (Michael Kitchen) favorites, all commendable. Episodes are packed with guest stars, too many to cite all. It's southern England WW2 home front history. DCS Foyle wants to do more for the war effort. Solving local murder is not enough in his mind. 1940s period-perfect sets, costumes flawless, as are the abundant threads of plot that tell of wartime civilian life like it's never been told before. Factual & often little known points. A drama-documentary almost.

This set includes the premier and introduces 3 other main characters close to Foyle. `SAM'antha (Honeysuckle Weeks) is his driver. You'll fall in love with her facial expressions, as good as Kitchen's. Milner (Anthony Howell) does copper leg-work for Foyle, after losing a leg in the war. Andrew (Julian Overden) is Foyle's RAF pilot son.
Remember, there also is the 19 episode set, a Set 6 1945 post-war era, and GOOD JOLLY-GOOD NEWS, new episodes are in the works for 2013.

Closed Captioning provides for the hearing impaired. All 6 discs have bonus material.
