8004753,3,B0000ZBONC,"This series is a Tenchi series in name only. The series should be called Seina Yamada GXP. Seina is a boy that is knida lame. His family enrolls him in the galaxy police academy. This show is about the crazy life he has at the academy. He is yet another wimpy boy that gets the attention of some major babes. He is not a very compelling character though. He tries hard, but all the powers that be are out to get him. I like the female characters in this series, and there are some pretty funny situations, but this series falls way short of greatness. There are  few old characters that get a little time. Mainly Mihoshi, who cleans the toilets and hallways at the academy. If you are a completest and won't be satisfied unless you own all the Tenchi entries, then go on and buy this show. If you are interested in this series b/c you expect more Tenchi and his harem, then you aren't missing anything. Personally I don't think this series good or bad. It's not memorable, and has already been forgotten by most.",1353024000,,1012,4.382978723404255
8004754,3,B0000ZBONC,"I watched this series and I have to say I cannot like the main male character lead (who's name is Siena) at all.  He is even more whiny, nerdy and annoying then tenchi was.  At least tenchi wasn't such a bad character and he definitely grew on you as you watched the series but the new hero you spend the entire GXP series with is quite a bit of a let down, it's difficult to imagine the women in GXP liking such badly written, badly voice acted and ugly looking character (Drawn well, but drawn purposely ugly), not to mention the the main Hero Siena in the original Japanese soundtrack was just the wrong voice actor to choose to play Siena, it really breaks the suspension of disbelief whenever you hear Siena speak when comparing to the other decent-to-excellent voice actors they enlisted to act the other girls who all love him.

The new girl characters that fawn all over the new hero are alright but much of the  charm, humor and character in the new women leave a lot to be desired when comparing it to the original Tenchi OVA and Tenchi Universe, which had better scripts/writing for how the women act when the women fawn all over the hero over (like they do in all tenchi series).  In Tenchi GXP the relationships between Siena and most of the women he meets feels jarring and unnatural, except the girl kiriko (his childhood friend/caretaker).  One character who's love/attachment to Siena sticks out as fake especially is the ""new"" space pirate ryoko, the way it was written there was just not enough ""new"" ryoko time on the screen to develop any kind of meaningful attachment to Siena which feels weird while you're watching the series.  The ""New"" ryoko is named after the original space pirate, who she is not related to and the blonde girl Siena meets in the first episode who leaves a brochure so he can choose to join the Galaxy Police.

The series starts out pretty slow and many of the characters are just plain immature as the relationships between the women and the hero (Seina) are dumbed down over the more subtle and complex characters in former Tenchi series like the older orgiinal OVA and Tenchi universe.  For hardcore anime fans who always listen to Japanese soundtrack and turn on the subtitles, the voice acting in this series is below that of the prior Tenchi series (Tenchi Universe and Tenchi Muyo OVA).

The animation is pretty hit and miss, most of the characters are well drawn but the animation quality is all over the map throughout the episodes, lots of stills and cheap animation tricks like still frames with only easy things to animate like laser blasts that just appear.  Overall the animation effort only gets grade C- from me.",1123027200,,2673,4.630021141649048
8004755,5,B0000ZBONC,"Seina Yamada is a geek who is also a classmate of Tenchi and he's living in Tenchi's home town of Okayama, Japan. He wanted to become a Galaxy Police but the joke's on him when he finds out he was training for space force with two familiar faces, Mihoshi and Kiyoni from Tenchi Universe $ Tenchi in Tokyo. Tenchi Muyo GXP isn't like the series that was shown on Toonami. This show has no romantic comady and sci-fi adventure but the anime is good coming from Funimation.",1118448000,,470,4.413793103448276
8004756,5,B0000ZBONC,"Seina Yamada is from Earth, but through a series of accidents and strange events, he ends up joining the Galaxy Police.  He'll meet Pirates and Princesses, sexy Police Detectives and weird aliens (some of which are also sexy).  Will he survive space travel?  Will he survive having so many females trying to help him?  Will he survive dorm life?
While he might be unlucky, he does have a few good points.  He has a good heart and REALLY wants to explore space and learn about life off the planet Earth.  So it looks like he plans to stay with the Galaxy Police, no matter what happens.
This first DVD has five episodes, a few extras and a lot of fun.  The GXP TV series is linked to the Tenchi Muyo! OVAs by using some of the same settings and some characters related to the OVA characters.  We get a glimpse of Ryoko, we meet Mihoshi's mom, it seems that the dorm security system was designed by Dr. Clay, and we learn that the Jurai Family Tree is more of a over-cooked bowl of spaghetti.  The artwork is great, with heavy use of computer graphics for the ships and many of the combat scenes.  I just loved the pirate Rats and the marks that could not be shown on TV.  Warning: The subtitles for the Japanese version IS different from the English version (which I believe is meant to help the hearing impaired).  So if you want a direct translation listen to the Japanese audio with the subtitles - it does seem to make more sense too.  Keep the pause button ready.
125 minutes of life off the planet Earth - keeping the peace was never so wild!",1087689600,6,1547,4.348432055749129
8004757,4,B0000ZBONC,"Tenchi muyo gxp is a very good show it is very funny especiall when Tenchi's grandmother is around. It is very good, but does not get the five star rating because it has a few slow spots. It gets boring sometimes. The first disk does introduce you to all the characters, and gets the show going so by the second and third disk its all good. This show has very good dubbing which surprised me though because they also made Dragonball Z which had horrible dubbing. Overall this show is good and everyone should buy it. Its very funny and has great characters.",1084838400,,557,4.41747572815534
8004758,5,B0000ZBONC,"The unluckiest human on Earth is Seina Yamada, a schoolmate of Tenchi Muyo.  Awnings fall on him, his bike falls apart every time he rides it, he falls constantly and things fall on him, and so on; his luck also rubs off on people he passes, so most people avoid him.  Through a ""random"" encounter, he meets a member of the Galaxy Police who has come to earth to deliver a message to Tenchi and who rescues him from drowning after her ship crashes into Tenchi's lake and floods the surrounding area.  She gives him an application for admission to the Galaxy Police Academy and vanishes, literally.  His mother and sister, thinking that it's a sweepstakes entry (they can't read the alien language), force him to fill it out and thumbprint it.  That night while he's asleep, he's beamed up into a GP transport ship.  He awakes on ship to find a blond woman named Mitoto (Mihoshi's mother) and the captain of the ship standing over him, and he's informed that he's on the way to the GP academy.  His bad luck causes the ship to be attacked by an entire fleet of pirates, which causes him to later meet the Devil Princess of Jurai, the woman detective who recruited him, the girl who took care of him when he was small, Yosho's wife, Mihoshi's grandparents and more characters related to the Tenchi universe.  He enters the academy, undergoes transformations, fights pirates, captains his own ship, returns to Earth for a visit, pilots a giant robot, and this is just in his first year of training!
This is even more of a slapstick roller coaster ride than the rest of the Tenchi series.  The wonder of the Tenchi universe is here with its alien civilizations, unbelievable technology, complicated relationships, and deep backstory.  There's not as much of the seriousness that occasionally pervaded Tenchi; it's subordinated to the comedy, and, being Tenchi, the comedy is often crude, seriously lewd, and brash, but it's just flat-out fun.  This is definitely not for children in places.  Also, check out track two of the English subtitles; it's a more literal translation from the Japanese than the dub, and sometimes the differences are so huge that you have to wonder what story Funimation was watching when they wrote the script.

8004759,5,B0000ZBONC,"Although i've only seen this as a fan sub, it has always been my favarite out of the three (Tenchi Muyo, Universe + GXP)All of the characters from the origional Tenchi Muyo appear ( also watch out for Mihoshis mother who appears frequently, if you though  Mihoshi was a bubble head you aint seen nothing yet. In usual tenchi stylee all the women fall for one man, in this case the man is Yamato Seina, Tenchis Lower classman. Ryo-oki, will be delighted at the appearance of a sister cabbit, namely FU (so sayeth the fansubbing) the one character people will be suprised with is the return of ol pink hair Serio Tennan (the bloke Ayeka almost had to marry in the end of Muyo). A little warning before you start watching be careful who you call Grandma, people who have seen the fan sub will know what I mean.",1075075200,2,807,4.416107382550336
8004760,5,B0000ZBONC,"It took two years, but it's finally here! Tenchi Muyo! GXP. GXP takes place in the Tenchi OAV timeline, after the period of the as of yet unreleased (state-side)3rd OAV series. I don't know much about it in the story department (as I wish to remained unspoiled), but I've heard only positive things from those who have viewed the Japanese episodes. Add to that, these FUNI dvds contain the Home video version and not the TV version, what we get is uncut entertainment. A must for any Tenchi fan!!! If there's any negative, it's the possibility of bad dubbing. FUNI is known for it's ""over-the-top"" Dragon Ball/Z/GT dub, but I had no problem with the Blue Gender dub, so let's hope GXP continues this. These next two months will feel like the last two year wait all over again. Hurry up March 9th, 2004!!!",1073260800,9,804,4.590277777777778
