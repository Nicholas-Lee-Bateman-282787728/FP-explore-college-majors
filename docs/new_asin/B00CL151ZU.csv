5725264,5,B00CL151ZU,Gunsmoke ANY season is awesome.  A simpler time in regards to less complicated.  Hard work was rewarded and crime was actually punished. The characters are real. The good ole Old West.  The longest running series ever.  Keeping an eye out for the next one available.,1377993600,6,266,4.844444444444444
5725265,5,B00CL151ZU,"Just simply the best in any series. If they keep putting them out I will keep buying them. I would like have all 20 seasons. Chester is good in all of them that he was in. But it is a pleasant change to have some new faces. Ken Curtis,,,,aka,,, Festus Hagan is really the best, and always country. Keep them coming.",1374796800,8,315,4.180327868852459

5725267,5,B00CL151ZU,"For me the first 9 years of the TV version are the best.  The original cast, and B&W.  Within that, the first 6 years are the very best. Most, if not all, episodes are transcribed versions of the radio versions.  Unfortunately the scripts had to be mellowed some for the more restrictive TV venue. e.g., on the radio version Kitty is well known to be a prostitute, which many saloon girls were at the time, in remote areas of the West. In the TV version she is made a co-owner of the Longbranch, becoming a business woman. Otherwise, the program is a classic in every way. I intend to get seasons 1 to 9. After season 9, Chester leaves the show, and Dillon is on maybe 3 minutes in many episode - long enough to say ""I've got to go up to Hayes City for a week,"" never to be seen again.  That left Kitty and Doc to carry the show, along with an endless stream of new and mostly temporary characters. It's really a different program, and is in color. Another minor problem is that in going to a 60 minute format, starting in season 7, the plots often get stretched pretty thin, still basically being the 30 minute radio version plots. The 30 minute episodes in seasons 1 to 6 are better in my opinion, if not dramatically so. Still, I'll get all the seasons up through 9. It's still one of the best programs to ever appear on TV.",1371772800,49,1327,4.253968253968254

5725274,5,B00CL151ZU,"Here's the deal with Gunsmoke.  If you like westerns, you'll love Gunsmoke.  I love them all, but my most favorite ones were Season's 1 - 6.  It's been so long since I've seen the 1st seasons of Gunsmoke, so it was like watching them for the very first time.  I believe these were 30 min.  But Matt Dillon was at his meanest.  Some of the episodes were written by Sam Peckinpah, the director of the movie, ""The Wild Bunch..!""  My son loves this, so I buy him a Season each Christmas...  So, it looks like I'm up to Season 9, and Christmas will be coming up again, so I'll be ordering more.  And my 7 year old Granddaughter told me the other day (Nov. 11, 2016 Election Year), that we can all say, ""Merry Christmas Again...!""  So, Merry Christmas...!",1478995200,,749,4.323741007194244

5725276,5,B00CL151ZU,"Gunsmoke provides western-lovers with a family-friendly great show that emphasizes character, law & order, and good plain common sense. This half-season, as well as all previous episodes, provide a breath of fresh air in an age when many of the most entertaining movies have drifted from such character-building values. It is amazing to me that the writers were successful in making the plot and storyline consistently excellent and among the best of the classic Westerns from season to season for so many consecutive seasons. I cannot think of one episode to date that felt weak or that let me down.

Definitely a great addition for the video library of anyone who likes the Western genre, or who likes solid character and good role models in the primary characters, and a strengthening of the ideas of justice, fair play, the rule of law, and even compassion and wisdom throughout.",1471564800,,883,4.966216216216216

PS.  Which season was it when, during the opening credits, the camera zooms into James Arness from the right-front as he draws his gun and his vest swings because of the speed of his actions?  Also, which season was it when they began filming him riding on his horse?  Does anyone know which season it was when Milburn Stone began trimming his eyebrows?  I noticed this on an episode on the Western's Channel that didn't give any information about which season it was in.

5725313,3,B00CL151ZU,"Chester leaves and the show goes downhill. What makes it worst is that the majority of the stories is about someone else and not Matt Dillon and the gang! They're basically background characters. The show should always be about Matt Dillon, Kitty, Doc, Chester, Festus, and people who are part of the stories are second banana. So many are focused on other people that we lose our interest because why do we watch Gunsmoke?? Is to see Matt Dillon in action! Who cares about 40 mins of ""Mr. Smith and his dying wife??"" They're not GUNSMOKE that the fans want to see! If you check the Nielson ratings when chester left, it just started to go downhill. I think it did comeback strong for a season or two, but it never gain it's top 4 rating since Chester and the half hour seasons. The hour long episodes were weak, with terrible endings. Sometime you're watching it, and you're waiting for a climatic ending, it just ends! And you're left wondering, ""is that it?? What happen to him/her??"" Yes, a lot of episodes came about like that. It was never the same again after chester left.",1415923200,2,1080,4.543589743589743

My dad loved watching it when he was growing up and I just can't get enough of Matt, Chester, Kitty, Doc, Festus... I have all 9 seasons and never tire of it.

I just read, shortly before posting this, that Gunsmoke will be releasing Season 10, Volumes 1& 2 , on August 12th **2014**!!! :) I read it on Gunsmoke, the tv show, Wikipedia page and when you go to dvd releases, it has a release date of 8/12/2014. I'm not saying that means it's 100% true, but it sure sounds promising. I know many were wondering, like myself. Why Amazon hasn't listed it yet, I'm not sure.

5725341,5,B00CL151ZU,"Gunsmoke was one of the great classic TV westerns. This volume you can see a definite change in the format. Chester is being ""phased out"" and Festus is being ""phased in"". (Dennis Weaver left the show after season 9.) Also, you can see where Matt Dillon also started being on the show less and less. In many of these episodes it's almost just a walk on.  (I'm sorry Gunsmoke just isn't the same without Matt Dillon.)

I'm still debating on whether I will purchase season 10. I may get season 10 and then stop. I do like the character of Festus (but I preferred Chester). But season 10 is still in B/W, and as the show progressed through the years, Matt Dillon is barely on the show.

This volume has English subtitles for the hearing impaired. (But it's just not the same without Matt Dillon and Chester.  Several episodes in this volume really focus on Festus, and Chester and Matt just aren't around.)",1388275200,9,902,4.515337423312883

8582920,5,B00CL151ZU,"If you are a fan of the Western genre, this is an absolute must. Great cast, and great guest stars along with fantastic storylines explains just why Gunsmoke lasted for 20 seasons! Originally cast for the role of US Marshall Matt Dillon, John Wayne thankfully turned it down letting us have the 6'7 James Arness of Minnesota fill the role of Matt Dillon, and now, I couldn't see anyone else play that role. Amanda Blake, Milburn Stone, Ken Curtis and Burt Reynolds do wonderfully in this timeless series-you have to see it!",1517875200,,523,4.695652173913044
