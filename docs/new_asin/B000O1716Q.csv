It allowed me to purchase two movies I thoroughly enjoy (The Lake House/Youve Got Mail) and familiarized me with one I had not seen (The Phantom of the Opera).  All three at at an afforable price.

8182641,5,B000O1716Q,"My favorite thing about this three movies set is that each one is on a separate dvd disk in its own protective sleeve made to hold a dvd disk. The whole package is compact and takes up less room for storage than 3 separate dvd cases would. Also the price  is fabulous! 3 movies for the price of one! Last but not least, is the variety that spans some years of movie making and it's not a boring set. Ro",1294185600,,402,4.025
