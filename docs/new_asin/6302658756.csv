495475,4,6302658756,"""The Atomic City"" made in 1952, is an interesting tale about what can happen
in real life and no doubt was a controversial issue in its day.

The story takes place in Los Alamos, New Mexico, at the maximum-security
nuclear-weapons research centre and involves top atomic scientist Dr. Frank
Addison (Gene Barry), his wife Martha (Lydia Clarke) and his young son
Tommy (Lee Aaker).

Disaster strikes when Tommy is kidnapped and is held in exchange for atomic
secrets by enemy agents. It shows the anguish that the parents are put
through and the devious methods that the kidnappers use to obtain these
secrets, including killing the boy if they fail to get what they want.

The parents reluctantly hand the case over to the FBI but to them National
Security is top priority. Apprehending the extortionists comes first and saving
the boy is further down the list. To the parents, it is saving the boy first and
apprehending the extortionists next.

The FBI spend considerable time following up every clue but time is fast
running out. The useless formula handed to the extortionists to stall for more
time is confirmed as useless and the boy's life is now in peril.

The climax to the movie comes when the FBI find out by accident where the
boy is being held and they converge on the site - the Puye Indian cliff
dwellings.

Everything is now going wrong for the kidnappers, so they decide to destroy
all evidence and flee. The master-mind of the plot kills his accomplices and
then prepares to kill the boy as he would be able to identify him.

Tommy of course is a bright and resourceful little boy and he knows what is
about to happen to him. So, he decides to save himself even though he
knows that there is no way off the plateau where he is being held, with a
shere drop to his death on all sides.

Young Lee Aaker, the veteran of numerous movies and TV shows as a
child actor, turns in another good performance as Tommy. His role in the
movie is totally believeable.

Good, absorbing entertainment.",1353628800,4,2003,4.588235294117647
495476,5,6302658756,"""The Atomic City"" (starring Gene Barry, who also starred in ""The War of the Worlds"" (1953)), is an excellent nail-biter that blends the fears of the Cold War with the best traditions of 1930's/1940s gangster/film noir films.  One could swear that this film is an Atomic age gangster film that replaces the Mafia with ""the enemy"" (euphemistically referring to the communists of Russia and China.)  If you like a sort of ""revisionist"" gangster film with Atomic Age/Cold War drama, then this might be for you.",1344038400,3,506,4.9411764705882355
495477,5,6302658756,"One of the joys of watching old movies particularly those shot on location is that the viewer sees a place, an environment as it was. Such is the case with ""Atomic City"" starring Gene Barry and Lee Aaker and directed by Jerry Hopper. It was made in 1952 and largely filmed in New Mexico's Santa Fe and Los Alamos regions. It hit the screens while America was still reeling from the shock that the Cold War was real and Communist spies had actually infiltrated the labs at Los Alamos. In fact two American civilians, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were awaiting execution the following year after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage during a time of war. Writer Sydney Boehm's story is simple. The young son of a Los Alamos nuclear scientist is kidnapped and the ransom demand is the design of the H-bomb. The 85 minute production is entertaining but its real quality lies in the actual locations such as the famous La Fonda hotel in Santa Fe, the shops of that period and of course Los Alamos known as ""Atomic City,"" a name that still lingers today on the town's bus service. In the longish finale the viewer is treated to scenes filmed at the Bandelier National Monument with its famous  Frijoles Canyon and the unique cliff dwellings of the Indian ancestors. The movie is now sixty years old and for lovers of visual history it provides a great treat.",1332806400,11,1363,4.632231404958677
495478,5,6302658756,"I purchased Atomic City [VHS] for my dad's 54th birthday. He'd put it on his Amazon Wish List, and it frankly was one of the nice movie things I could afford. I queued him in on it, he said he'd love to get it, and I ordered. I received it within a week of online purchase, and dad has watched it several times since his birthday. It had a few small wear-and-tear signs of being an older video cassette, but it was in pretty good shape for its age, and had a reasonably set price like so. I've also recently purchased a 15-year-old car off CraigsList, which exhibits like age-related signs of wear-and-tear, but is a great car with only 88,000 original miles and I LOVE it like dad loves the movie. Both have served the purchaser very well.",1299196800,,740,4.330935251798561
495479,4,6302658756,"Here is a much lesser known 50's sci-fi with a little different twist. An atomic researchers son is kidnapped and held for a ransom of the the Father's atomic secrets.

This is a tightly knit atomic sci-fi thriller with great production values and above average acting, even from the kid. The Atomic City actually has a movie feel to it unlike a lot of other 50's sci-fi of this time which which came off more like an episode of a TV show.

The Atomic City was also actually nominated for an Academy Award for Best Screenplay - how many other 50's sci-fi can tout an Academy Award Nomination?

Great pacing, tight direction and some superb location filming in the 'real' Atomic City of Los Alamos, New Mexico make this one worth hunting down. The collectors print in circulation is an above average transfer and makes for a great double feature with the Atomic Man!!

7829512,3,6302658756,"This review is for the blu-ray version of 'The Atomic City' released by Olive Films in September, 2013

I purchased this movie because I am a fan of classic science fiction films. However this is not a science fiction film. it is a cold war espionage film. While it might be perceived to be science fiction by the title, it is not, at least by the standards of the day.

This is not exactly a budget release as it is priced at approximately $20.00. There isn't much in the way of extra's. It's strictly for fans of cold war drama.

BLU-RAY: The picture quality is very good. As good as can be expected.

PLOT: Dr. Frank Addison (Gene Barry from War of the Worlds) is a nuclear scientist. He lives with his wife Martha (Lydia Clarke) and their son Tommy (Lee Aaker) in Los Alamos (the atomic city of the title). Dr. Addison is working on the top secret H-Bomb. Tommy is kidnapped by the commies and Dr. Addison is told that he will be killed if he does not turn over to them the secret of the H-Bomb. Dr. Addison tries to keep it a secret as he tries to figure out how to get Tommy back without committing treason. His wife and the government find out what is going on. The remainder of the movie focuses on how to get Tommy back alive.

THOUGHTS/CONCLUSIONS: The movie poses an interesting moral dilemma for Gene Barry's character. He can turn over the H-Bomb plans and save his son but in the process he would be committing treason and jeopardizing the country.

The movie is shot in 1:37:1 ratio.
It has a lot of good outdoor shots and uses real-life locations in and around Los Angeles and historic sites in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

Overall, this is a decent cold war paranoia film (if there is such a genre). It is worth a watch. If you are on a budget and want the movie I'd probably wait and try and buy a used copy at a lower price

I feel like this should be a $9.99 blu-ray or at most $14.99. Even the cover is basically in black and white and not for artistic reasons.
But at least it is available. Afterall, nobody is twisting your arm to purchase it at the higher price!

Thanks to Olive films for releasing it.
I give the movie 3 stars for plot, 5 stars for picture quality for an average of 4 stars. I drop one star off the rating for the price and lack of extra's.

Recommended for fans of cold war drama and science fiction fans who have to have every movie that can claim to be science fiction even if it's not.",1487635200,,2426,4.24295010845987
