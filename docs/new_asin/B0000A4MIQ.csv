7995794,2,B0000A4MIQ,"Although the video is well recorded and has excellent sound, I found the video to have little value beyond the rhythm notation that I can already find for free on the internet.  There is no verbal instruction or description of techniques used to produce the bass, tone, and slap on a djembe.  The examples are good, but strangely there are no ensembles that combine the djembe and dunun drums.  These rhythms are supposed to be played with both instruments, but the only option is to listen to the djembes together or the dununs together!  Thione Diop's video is better and has the djembe and dununs together on ensembles.  However, it also has no real instructional value aside from notation of rhythms that can be freely obtained from the internet.

I am still trying to find any video on the djembe that is really well put together and worth the money...$30.00 for 5 rhythms and no instruction is a pretty steep price to pay in my opinion.  For $30 there should be more instructional value from these very talented Master Drummers. Michael Taylor's Remembering How to Drum is the only video that I think is worth the money for an introduction to djembe techniques...although the ensembles on that video are just plain freaky (but they are entertaining). There are many good exercises on Michael's video that would benefit anyone.",1173916800,4,1332,4.815789473684211
7995795,1,B0000A4MIQ,"I bought this DVD for my wife as a Christmas gift along with a Drum to begin learning on. Although someone beyond beginner status might find this video usefull, we did not and I don't recommend it for beginners. The DVD has no instuctional value for people just starting out.",1172966400,2,275,4.52
7995796,3,B0000A4MIQ,It is not exactly what we were thinking it would be.  There are no verbal instructions or explanations of the beats--he just does it really slow or really fast.,1140220800,7,160,4.517241379310345
7995797,5,B0000A4MIQ,"I have found John Yost's CDs, CDV's and DVDs uniformly excellent. The videos are clearly photographed and sound is well produced. Neophytes can see exactly what his is doing and the excellent sound of his strokes gives them something at which to aim. More advanced players can learn new rhythms or slightly different versions of familiar ones while observing the intricacy of the timing. Both the individual sections and the ensemble playing are very clear. Individual sections especially, both those played very slowly and those played up to tempo,are long enough for a viewer to play one part while listening to and watching another. Experienced players will enjoy soloing against the ensemble playing. John not only knows the West African rhythms perfectly, but demonstrates excellent, relaxed technique.",1105401600,6,807,5.362204724409449
7995798,2,B0000A4MIQ,"I bought this book as a gift for someone learning the djembe drum. This book is not for someone brand new to the drum. There is no basic instruction on how to slap, beat, or use the drum, just instruction on some various rhythms for songs. It is not useful for someone who needs to understand the various touches and sounds that can be produced on the djembe. It simply jumps into videos of hands hitting specific rhythms. This is not what was expected.",1082937600,9,453,4.404761904761905
