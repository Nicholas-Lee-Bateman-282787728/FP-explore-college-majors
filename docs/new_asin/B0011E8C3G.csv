( You Know )Those to reviewers i respect is M. Beckford & Mr. Morgoth. if you are new to karate movies i suggest you review those two, before purchase.i know a lot of titles and own quite a few, but here's one that may be interesting for i have not reviewed it yet, however from the looks of the back of the cover it seems to be a sleeper. when i watch it i will surely stamp my approval or disapproval. however i found it in the grocery store video section where most vaule price kung fu movies can be found. it's called the Platinum Classic Collection and it's called The Cavalier the characters on back looks like Ghost Face Killer from Mystery Of Chess Boxing aka as Nija Checkmate. the video is by ground zero some of their dvd's are okay to watch haven't had a bad one yet...so when i finish i will surely inform the fight fans of this possible hidden Gem.. Keep up the good work of review M. Beckford/Mr Morgoth, Peace In The East... Yea! E! Yea!... Also the cover art work is different from this one showing.",1201910400,,1451,4.148936170212766
