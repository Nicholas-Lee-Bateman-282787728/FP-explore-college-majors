2684963,5,B000K8O27O,"Garth has without a doubt gave country music a new boost to a new International horizon.

I have officially became a country music fan after buying ""Ropin' The Wind"" in 1991. I quickly became interested in Garth's work, and his influences George Jones & George Strait.

Yes, Garth is not a traditional (classic) country singer. His music is a mixture of country / rock / pop. But today who isn't.

After all, many country artist's in the 70's were also mixing different geners.

Garth has proven time and time again that he is a wonderful artist for the following reasons:

1. Great songwriter.
2. Great Performer & and good singing voice. The DVDs will testify to that.
3. He is a huge fan of the fans, since he:
A. Spent 23 hours in a one of the fan fairs for signing autographs for his fans.
B. Does not over charge people for his concert tickets.
C. Watch the New York concert ""Live at Central Park"".
D. The Entertainer boxset is only worth $ 20. who does that???

4. Sold over 100 Million Albums in one decade. No one was able to do that.
5. And finally has respect for the legends of country music. Saluted:

A. George Jones.
B. George Strait.
C. Chris LeDoux.
D. Charlie Daniels.
E. Keith Whitley.

At the end, thank you Garth for taking the time in putting a smile on our face and for giving tunes that we are still enjoying till this very day.

We only hope Walmart will come out with new projects such as this boxset.

2684964,5,B000K8O27O,"First of all, BUY it at Walmart for $20.00.....$39.00 here, c'mon.

I was NOT a fan of Garth's in his heyday, but, recently have purchased some of his work and grown to appreciate his music.

 The NYC AND Ireland shows are the BEST here, with side interviews and an acoustic song or two. The packaging alone should get your attention. Go out and buy this, you can't go wrong.",1162771200,18,375,4.405797101449275

2684985,5,B000K8O27O,"All concerts on this edition are great, Garth is really an entertainer. The Central Park concert with an audience of close to a million people is stunning.
Sound and camera of these recordings are well done. What I like about this edition is that these recordings still have a real life-touch, they were not overly studio ""remastered"" as common practice for so many life recordings these days.
Excellent value for money and a must have for anyone that enjoys a good life concert recording.",1435104000,2,489,4.833333333333333

2685040,5,B000K8O27O,"I should start this review by explaining that I'm a MAJOR Garth fan. So, this may be skewed a bit, due to that fact. I recently was able to go to Las Vegas to see Garth's shows there, and after the first trip there, I came back just ""itching"" for the good old days of watching him run around the stage, and shaking up bottles of water.
Unfortunately, my VHS versions of some of his older shows have seen better days, so it was time to step up to this collection. I was VERY happy by all the discs included. It has all of the music videos. If you're a big Garth fan, I would STRONGLY suggest that you should own this. I keep it in a special place in my room because I don't want my kids to mess with these ""old fashioned"" DVDs.",1403568000,3,726,4.0137931034482754

2685055,5,B000K8O27O,"One of the best entertainers I have ever seen. A brilliant mix of great shows but being Irish the concert in Croke Park, Dublin is by far the best. Don't understand why people are giving out about the quality as these things were recorded many years ago...

I owned this on VHS and I am now delighted I own it on DVD.",1391126400,,317,4.112903225806452

2685062,2,B000K8O27O,"Don't bother. The recording quality of the second concert is atrocious, lot of his comments on stage go unheard. It sounds like someone set up a cell phone somewhere in the audience and then tried using online software to fix it. First concert is OK, kinda cute with Garth being his boyish self talking about his music and drive. But honestly, if this is 'country music' at it's finest....I can actually even get past the musical monotony, but why would anybody allow something this poorly produced be sold for real $$?",1384473600,3,519,4.714285714285714

2685077,5,B000K8O27O,"Definitely not your usual country. This man rocks.
Superb production, top backing, amazing crowd interaction.. Garth's energy - unsurpassed even by ACDC s Angus
This is entertainment of an incredible standard. One Artist, one decade, one hundred million albums sold, It says it all.
The concerts may have some of the same songs but every one is different. Watch Billy Joel, Don McLean get into a totally new world of music.
I had to tweak my sound system a bit to get the best out of Garth's vocals in some parts, but its a sound engineers nightmare with a screaming singing crowd of tens of thousands.
If you want to be entertained by a truly professional artist with probably the best backing band I have ever had the pleasure to watch and listen to- go for it. I promise you won't be disappointed, not matter what musical genre you are into.
This is class",1368489600,4,858,4.577922077922078

2685081,3,B000K8O27O,"The Central Park concert was terribly edited.  They edited out the band intros, a lot of cheering, and put several songs as bonus.  They weren't bonus songs, they were in the original concert.  If you want this strictly for Central park, do yourself a favor, dust off the VCR and buy it on tape.",1363219200,,295,4.425925925925926

A fantastic collection of his live performances, no other product can or has compared before or since.

Was awesome to replace my worn out VCR copy of his earlier interview and video collection, but quite disappointed they had edited to exclude all the footage of Sandy - what's up with that?

That aside, would highly recommend this to all Garth fans. It has been played, and replayed time and time again.",1360195200,,466,4.458823529411765

This collection of DVDs of some of his biggest concerts is awesome...am so happy with it.have watched them over an over since they arrived...there is no other than GARTH...buy this if you are a fan..you will love it...I do,1345852800,,263,4.739130434782608
2685098,5,B000K8O27O,It was neat to watch Garth change and mature during the span of his career.  We got to see him in concert during the Nashville flood recovery show. WONDERFUL!,1330214400,,158,4.448275862068965
2685099,3,B000K8O27O,"FIVE DVDs is really kinda too much.
Only one of them that I would play again and again.
The rest are just so-so. Some re-dos, etc.
I was disappointed with the sound quality.
Maybe I'm just spoiled by some others being so good.
But, some of the solo artist's performances
on guitars, horns, pianos, etc. was just disappointing.
It just doesn't stand out and hit you.
Sorta sounds like they are playing in another room.
Again, the performances are excellent.
But, if you are really INTO the ""music"",
you might also be just a little disappointed.",1311292800,7,543,4.666666666666667
2685100,1,B000K8O27O,"What a total let down. Whoever was responsible for post production editing is hopefully no longer working. The video footage is great. The audio is awful.
You have to crank the volume to make out the music/lyrics over the crowd noise.
Of the complete set the last disk was the only one with decent audio quality due to the fact that the videos were produced in a studio. As a Garth Brooks fan I was very disappointed with the quality of this product.",1306022400,4,450,4.433734939759036

Also, original price of product should be noted so it easy to calculate profit being made. Cannot tell how much DVD was played, like miles driven on a car would like opportunity to purchase the least used DVD. Concerts are great, never got to see Garth live and this helps. On albums by Garth would like to be able to click on and get listing of songs on Album. Is seller responsible for re-packaging DVDs?

Have been using DVDs to pass time while exercising, the pace helps me complete my hour a day quickly and with a smile on my face. Especially enjoyed Garth doing curtain calls after leaving the stage.",1305676800,2,799,4.510344827586207
2685102,5,B000K8O27O,"I have loved Garth Brooks since I was 9 years old!  Though I am almost 30 now and have migrated to punk/rock/pop music, Garth will always be my first love.  This box set has all the major concert events he's done in the past.  A couple of them I used to have on VHS when I was a kid, and the tapes had lots of personal stuff and interviews with Garth and his band/family.  The only thing that disappointed me was that this box set did not have that kind of material.  Other than that, it was great!  Compact, comprehensive, and a great price!  Definitely recommend. :)",1305417600,2,568,4.252336448598131
2685103,3,B000K8O27O,"All aspects of this video compilation are outstanding except for one important quality; GARTH'S VOCALS AUDIO!

The music videos are fine; however, the vocal audio for live footage is very low. It is hard to hear Garth on several songs, but some improvement is noticed as the concerts progress. It's so sad that such an excellent prodction was ruined because of a few errant audio settings. It's hard to fathom such a debacle in this day and age of production quality control.

If you love Garth, you'll still enjoy this set regardless of the audio issues...still very entertaining. A long long time will pass before we see another entertainer who will appeal to such a broad fan base and cause such a frenzy at Garth has accomplished.",1298160000,6,734,4.771653543307087

2685115,4,B000K8O27O,"I had purchased the Garth Brooks DVD set for my husband. He was really wanting the Garth Brooks in Central Park. I was excited to see that this set had 5 different concerts to offer. The only dissapointment was the the Central Park is not the whole concert. So we will be purchasing that separately. It would be great if the description describes that they are not full concerts on the DVD's.
We will be purchasing from this site again. :)",1293753600,5,439,4.432098765432099
2685116,5,B000K8O27O,"This set contains four of Garth's most popular televised concerts, as well as a disc devoted to his collection of music videos at that time.  Some quick thoughts about each portion of the collection:

This Is Garth Brooks (*****): An incredibly high-energy show that establishes Brooks as the new wave of country music.

This Is Garth Brooks Too (*****): Probably the best all-around concert in this set, as Garth is still electric and has even a bigger repetoire to choose from.

Garth Live From Dublin, Ireland (*****): An incredible all-around show that hits all the right notes, both sentimental and rockin'.

Garth Live From Central Park (*****): The biggest Garth concert of all-time.  Vocals start to decline a bit, but the energy is still high.",1288656000,,752,4.976

Being an Aussie, I found the Central Park concert filmed in 1997 very poignant with the New York skyline still having the twin towers and the ""Freedom"" banner between them. I had seen the Dublin concert on CMT some years ago and was thrilled to see it available on DVD.  The rest has been a bonus, and great value, even with the postage cost from the US.

Well what can I say, this is a fantastic collection of DVD's, and as it is not available in the UK, when I saw it on Amazon.com I ordered it straight away. You have got four live concerts from the US and Ireland ranging from 1991 to 1997 and a disc of music videos from 1989-2005 with extras. If you are a true fan of Garth then this is a must buy to have in your collection, especially the music videos DVD.

Many CD/DVD/Box Sets releases by Garth have remained unreleased in the UK so I am so grateful to be able to purchase them through Amazon.",1169337600,35,729,3.9863013698630136

Dispite there is 7 hours of entertainment in this box-set, it is disapointing that none of these 4 concert is full-length. On the DVD with the Ireland-concert there are two bonus-tracks from a more intimate(smaller audience) concert with GB,these tracks have a much better sound than the present stadium-concerts, could hope this concert could end up with a new DVD-release.",1168214400,5,498,5.085365853658536
