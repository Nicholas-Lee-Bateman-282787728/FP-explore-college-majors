8468679,4,B005ELVCES,I am a fan of the History Channel and have written reviews on a number of their individual films. This is a collection of some of those films some of which I have already seen. If I had looked at the product description more closely I would have passed on buying this DVD as I was looking at some of these disks a second time. Overall this is still a very good collection of historical information and if you have not already purchased some of the individual disks purchase this set and save some money.,1397692800,,503,4.3052631578947365
8468680,1,B005ELVCES,"This is unbelievably worthless. You won't get history, you won't get anything watchable, you won't even get a single well put together thought. TV junk at its worst.",1386288000,,165,4.928571428571429
8468681,1,B005ELVCES,"I only watched 2 of these and i just decided that i did not want to watch anymore. I may have watched the worst one...and maybe the rest are great..but ""Ancients Behaving Badly""..has to be about the worst of any of the History Channel documentaries I have ever seen. (I will admit that i am not at all a fan or regular viewer of History Channel documentaries however, and i did leave a review on this particular documentary on its specific display on amazon.. But will just say that i was disappointed with this ""Collection""...due to that particular DVD. And nowhere does it mention on this website advertisement for this collection of DVDs  that it is a ""collection"" of different documentaries by the History Channel. it is kind of a false or tricky advertisment.

I will just summarise a few things that i didn't like about ""Ancients Behaving Badly"".

1. very dumbed down content which will show an ancient site..and then switch the camera to maybe some scientists dressed up in white coats viewing DNA in a labratory at some university or research center in the USA? or might show a cartoon getting his head chopped off..or might show an ""Expert"" talking very excitedly ,like a used car salesman, about some topic,,etc. (all in 3 minutes)..so you are feeling kind of irritated they ever turned the camera away from the ancient site during that 3 minutes of time.? The problem is this continues on throughout and feels like you are on a roller coaster for people with ADHD.

2. Cartoons or ""Anime""? are used throughout the documentary. I didn't want to watch a documentary that seemed to be co-produced by ""the Cartoon Channel""

3. American Foot ball players in a foot ball stadium are used in one segment to dress up as gladiators..(one example of ""Very dumbed down content"")

4. An old van is used as target practice of an ancient weapon...kind of not what i was hoping for with such a nice cover for this documentary. (another example of ""dumbed down content"".)

5. Ironically, an extremely narcissistic seeming ""psychiatry expert""..from "" The University of Maryland""..who seems to be one of the main ""hosts"" for this documentary (I really did not like this aspect of this documentary) discusses and rates each of the ""ancient conquerors"" as being either (forget exactly the titles..but something similar to as follows)..1. ""Psychotic ruler""..2. ""Narcissistic ruler"".. or a 3. ""A Goal driven Ruler"".. (maybe had a few other titles too..but...what right this ""psychiatry"" expert had to judge men from such a far away time ,,i don't know. It is not really what i consider ""scholarship"" and just seems to maybe have an ulterior motive? ..(i am not sure reason why this was included). Maybe to help sell pscyhotic medications for drug companies? help promote this field of ""psychiatric"" health"" at ""The University of Maryland "" or other universities? I am not sure. Besides that,, the producers could have at least picked someone who was not as seemingly as distasteful as this narrator's personality seemed to be like.

Again, I might have just picked the worse DVD out of the box ""collection""..but , despite this,,,it should have mentioned on the advertisment that this was consisting of different History Channel documentaries and not a ""complete series or documentary""..and didn't seem to be anything like what i was expecting from the description.",1346025600,11,3353,4.932624113475177
8468682,5,B005ELVCES,"The boxset is great, it has a lot of content concerning Rome. As both a history buff and someone who studies warfare I was greatly pleased with the in depth and detailed look at the life of history's greatest generals. Not only was the their a lot of info, but it was unbiased for the most part. Most documentaries rely on myth when talking about ancient figures, but the history channel did it's research and challenged traditional belief with hard evidence. The best example of this is with their analysis of Nero; many consider him one of the most vile emperors in history, but the historians were careful to only rely on facts and not bias accounts left by history and gave an extremely credible and fair analysis of Nero as not just some madman but as an artist and a victim of fate while not completely dismissing his evil acts. If you love history and want a fair and unbiased documentary that is fun to watch and very reliable, look no further. This is by far the best source you can find on ancient leaders on video. The only downside is the heavy Rome related content, at least 80% of the boxset deals with Rome or Roman enemies so it's less of a ""Rulers of the Ancient World"" and more of a ""Rulers of Rome and their enemies"", that isn't a bad thing but it may mislead some people (although their is an entire disc dedicated to Alexander the Great).",1325548800,11,1359,4.418326693227091
8468683,4,B005ELVCES,"History gives its audience a nice overview of good and really bad rulers of Antiquity.  The series of eight rulers behaving badly stands out because of the in-depth analysis of their respective psychological profile in addition to the narrative of their deeds.  The documentaries ""Herod the Great,"" ""Constantine the Great,"" ""The Soldiers' Emperor,"" and ""The Queen Pharaoh"" are also noteworthy for their content.  In conclusion, History gives its viewers the opportunity to get a better appreciation of what these rulers accomplished or failed to accomplish during their lifetime.",1324252800,8,579,5.556818181818182
