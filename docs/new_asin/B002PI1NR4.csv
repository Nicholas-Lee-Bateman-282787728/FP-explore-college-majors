3964587,2,B002PI1NR4,"Directed by Anne Fontaine, from a screenplay by Fontaine and Benot Graffin, The Girl from Monaco suffers from an identity crisis. It could have been a great romantic comedy on the back of the masterful performance by Fabrice Luchini, playing the part of professionally successful but personally hapless attorney Bertrand Beauvois. Parisian Beauvois takes a high profile murder case in the principality of Monaco, only to land in the crosshairs of ambitious weathergirl Audrey Varella, played by the lovely and perhaps talented Louise Bourgoin. I say perhaps because the only role in this film with more than one dimension to it went to Luchini. It's hard to see an actor's range when they aren't given more than one or two emotions to portray, and Bourgoin is reduced to giggling and pouting her way throughout the film. Audrey sees stardom in her future, and Beauvois is the rocket ship on which she'll arrive. Coming between the two is the bodyguard Christophe Abadi (Roschdy Zem, who is only allowed to scowl in the film), hired by the family of the widowed accused murderer to protect Beauvois from the Russian mafia.
I mentioned that this film would have made a fine romantic comedy only because that is the direction it was heading in the first act of the movie. In subsequent acts it also had the potential to be a drama or a courtroom thriller, but it seems that Fontaine reached a bit too far and went for all three. It could be that the mistakes were made in the editing room by Maryline Monthieux (whoever edited the televised version of French Kiss hacked it up so badly that Kevin Kline's character went from being a romantic to looking like a rapist), but with Fontaine's role as director and screenwriter the final responsibility for this movie must rest on her shoulders.
The Girl from Monaco has its charms. The location shots were beautiful, the pacing of the film was superb, and the casting was dead on. My biggest overall problem with this movie was that it ended on such a false note. Luchini's performance was wonderfully nuanced and elevated the material, but as the closing credits rolled I felt disappointment and a little sadness for the film that could have been.",1281830400,,2191,4.798941798941799
3964588,3,B002PI1NR4,I saw ads for this on youtube and decided to get it. It is at its advertised; a lawyer working on a case in monaco meets this attractive nympho who is a weathergirl and gets involved with her. It kept my interest and I was interested but it did not knock my socks off. I will not give away the ending but it was subtle and a letdown. I had wanted a more conventional ending than the one this movie has. If you like light comedies/romances you might like this.,1272412800,3,459,4.111111111111111

8377028,3,B002PI1NR4,"Fabrice Luchini is of course marvelous as the repressed lawyer who can't quite believe in his good luck when Audrey, the drop-dead gorgeous weather girl, takes a romantic interest in him. She's completely out of his league, and in fact had a fling with the lawyer's bodyguard some years back. Ok, Audrey really, really likes sex, with all kinds of men. So, despite the fact that this film was directed by a woman, Anne Fontaine, it's ultimately going to be about male bonding, and Audrey must be sacrificed. There's only one problem. Audrey, brilliantly acted by Louise Bourgoin, is so much more than a gorgeous woman, though she is that. Tall in stature, she manages to tower above the repressed lawyer in more ways than one. She's loving in a sincere way, she's creative (like the director of the film, she makes a moviein this case about the eminent visiting lawyer). Audrey is the main, and indeed only source of liveliness, spontaneity, color, generosityin the film. In short, she represents the life force. And rule #1 of making a film about love is YOU CAN'T KILL OFF THE LIFE FORCE! If you do, you'll have nothing left but two sadsack, rather pallid men. Sure, they bond, and there is an interesting twist to the court case subplot.

But if Audrey is no longer there, we don't care anymore about the rival lovers, the court case, the plot, or indeed Monaco, a place that Audrey so beautifully represented and brought to life,

Too bad: ""The Girl from Monaco"" had the potential to be a truly great film. But after allowing Louise Bourgoin to create Audrey as larger-than-life, a kind of goddess, the director entombs this spectacular character, and with it the film  itself, in a blandly conventional storyline, the moral of which no longer resonates with our 21st century values.",1398124800,,1787,4.776699029126213

8377031,1,B002PI1NR4,"Everything and everyone and every word is superficial; the plot is worthy of a dime novel; good scenery, boring plot and music to go with it.",1333929600,,141,4.461538461538462
8377032,3,B002PI1NR4,"Pure junk. The scenes of Monaco are great and the bodyguard in the movie is superb. The rest of the cast and story are beyond lame. The girl is cute but hardly a Brigitte Bardot or Catherine Denevue. The lawyer is a cartoon really. The acting is just too cool for school at times and at other times like a bad Peter Sellers.

I really don't know why this film was made. It tried to be a comedy and ends up really a tragedy. It's like they attempted an American comedy (you know where violence has to be thrown in for no apparent reason) but fail on all accounts.",1311984000,3,562,4.155963302752293
8377033,3,B002PI1NR4,"The French can do comedy very well indeed- as anyone who has seen THE VALET can attest. And it is good that when the French do comedy that the come from a uniquely French standpoint: In THE VALET our hero does not get 'the girl' - but he does get the girl he really always wanted- which is actually better than a Hollywood ending (and along the way we get some extremely funny moments).

This could have been one of those movies.  It was not.  But it did have some good moments when it was a pleasure to watch. Other moments- not so much. Still, with a beautiful actress and great location scenery it was not a total waste of time.  It just could have been better.",1301702400,,664,4.2047244094488185
