8224634,5,B000WOSB2S,I really enjoyed the storyline of how engineers were involved in the development of the latest and greatest weapon; the catapult,1453161600,,128,5.142857142857143
8224635,5,B000WOSB2S,"Having snoozed through Oliver Stones lengthy Alexander and coming away with not much understanding of what made Alexander great, this short documentary (running less than an hour) gave me a much better understanding of how Alexander accomplished what he did in such a short lifetime. Focusing on one year in Alexanders long campaign and on one weapon of war, the documentary gave insight into Alexanders tenacity and strategic genius, and also his ability to lead and make tactical decisions, such as bringing engineers along on his military campaign. Paired with the History Channels other, longer, documentary, I was much more entertained and informed than I was with the fictionalized big-screen epic, in which it was painful to suffer through Angelina Jolies bad accent, Colin Farrells beach-bum hair, and Jared Letos passive, doe-eyed portrayal of a man who was a general, not just a pretty companion in eyeliner. Our whole family enjoyed this documentary.",1395273600,,961,5.287581699346405
8224636,4,B000WOSB2S,This contains the how of Alexanders operations as well as through the rest of his life.  While I'm quite sure that much detail is left out enough is included so that one gets a good idea of just what happened.,1366416000,,209,4.225
8224637,5,B000WOSB2S,A good story.  The parts about the catapult were fascinating.  I had not been aware of the twisted rope bundles storing the energy in those first catapults.  It fleshed out my understanding about Alexander.  The DVD depicts the building of the causeway and Alexanders subsequent adaptation to his original plans in response to the Tyrians responses to his initiatives.  Good show.,1363824000,,380,5.163934426229508
8224638,5,B000WOSB2S,"""Alexander the Great and the Catapult: Man, Moment, Machine"" is a very in depth and enjoyable documentary!  The History Channel did a great job on this documentary.  The catapult, which the Greeks called a ballista, is explained in depth and demonstrated with a modern reproduction.  The siege of Tyre is explained in detail yet was never boring.  It explains how Alexander the Great had an excellent group of engineers with his army and he used them to the fullest.  That and Alexander's  tactical brillance and persistence made possible the capture of the city of Tyre which was considered an impossibility. As the documentary stated, in a previous century, Nebuchadnezzer had laid siege to the city of Tyre for 16 years in succession and failed.  Only Alexander the Great would have had the confidence and the audacity to announce that he would make the island city of Tyre part of the mainland and then have his engineers construct a mole which did just that!  As the documentary states Alexander's mole was enlarged over the centuries and has permanently altered the currents of the Mediterranean Sea. It is still there to this day and, as Alexander boasted, the island city of Tyre was forever after connected to the mainland.  This DVD is well worth the money whether your interest is in ancient machines, ancient warfare, or Alexander the Great.",1326240000,6,1353,4.92511013215859
8224639,5,B000WOSB2S,What made Alexander the greatest of the military commanders?  Part was his advanced technology in the form of the catpults he used.  This DVD goes into detail and explains why the Macedonian catapults were better than those that were in use by others at the time.  Quite worth the time if you like Alexander or are interested in ancient war machines.,1249084800,5,350,4.704918032786885
