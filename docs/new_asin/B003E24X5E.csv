8395246,5,B003E24X5E,"I have the honor of supporting five families now who have now, for the first time, been able to communicate with their children with the aid of FC. It is wonderful beyond words to hear the voices of these previously frustrated and misunderstood children, who now have a direct way to tell people what they most want to say. I have found that FC greatly helps people to begin to see these children as people first, and then second, as a son or a daughter with the diagnosis of autism. I know that all of these families were inspired and motivated by Kayla's Voice. This dvd is a great and convincing way to introduce people to FC. I cannot recommend it enough!",1277337600,,659,4.409836065573771

Thanks for sharing it with us. Phyllis"". Phyllis was VP at Save The Children for many years. It's amazing that people doubt facilitated communication. If you have any doubt, this piece will prove it's an amazing break through for the autism community. It's an inspiring story.
