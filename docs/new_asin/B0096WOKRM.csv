8537066,1,B0096WOKRM,"Disappointed.  First, why $70 for one DVD with 3 short routines?  Also, her teaching style is loud and too fast.  True buyers remorse.",1459036800,,134,4.739130434782608
8537067,1,B0096WOKRM,this is a bootleg of her actual videos available at the Strala studio shop online!,1430611200,4,82,4.533333333333333

8537069,2,B0096WOKRM,This yoga DVD was described as a beginner DVD.  I bought it to loan to clients to introduce them to yoga.  I felt the descriptions of poses was not specific enough for true beginners and was disappointed.,1360281600,3,204,4.486486486486487
8537070,3,B0096WOKRM,"i bought this based on a review on FitSugar.com. i didn't love this dvd but i didn't hate it either. i'm an intermediate level yogi and i'd say that quite a few of the postures here were advanced. especially the inversions, for which there is a whole section. tara is a good instructor, but this dvd didn't leave me dying to do it again. I'm not sure what the other 2 or 3 DVDs in the series are like but I was happy that i didn't spend my money on the whole set based on this one.",1354147200,9,481,3.9690721649484537
