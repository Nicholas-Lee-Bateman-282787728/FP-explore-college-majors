3121191,5,B00140PK6O,Watched three episodes of the Miniseries last year while visiting Ireland. Wonderful movie; cannot wait to see the last two episodes.,1210636800,5,133,5.380952380952381
3121192,5,B00140PK6O,"2008's ""Cranford"" is an outstanding Masterpiece Theater presentation, featuring a superb cast of actors set in a small village in the Midlands of 1840 England.  At the center of the story is a group of single females led by the aging spinster sisters Miss Deborah and Miss Mattie, their younger niece Mary Smith, and Miss Pole, who collectively contribute both wisdom and humor to the story.

Cranford manages to contain considerable human interest despite its small size, or perhaps because of it.  Rumors run wild, normally well ahead of the well-intentions efforts of villagers to get things done.  Several themes thread through the series.  One theme is the influence over village affairs exercised by the spinsters.  A second is the assimilation of the young Doctor Harrison, who causes quite a stir by his unorthodox medical methods and by his good looks.  A third is the pending disruption to the insular ways of Cranford by the advent of a railroad across the lands of the wealthy Lady Ludlow.

A number of charming subplots enliven each episode, which pull no punches when it comes to matters of love and death.  Small romances thrive or fail.  A estate steward teaches a gypsy boy how to read.  The village enjoys an annual party on the estate of Lady Ludlow.  A bank failure threatens a woman with sudden destitution.  A couple in love are kept apart by her family obligations.  Valentine's Day becomes a source of confusion as mysterious cards arrive at varous homes in the village.  Even prominent characters are not immune from disappointment, although there is hope from episode to episode that fate will be kind to most.  Period costumes, customs and furnishings are spot-on.  The direction keeps the story moving from family to family as the various themes are advanced.  The final episode is absolutely thrilling, as a variety of plot threads are finally tied up and surprising heroes save the day.

""Cranford"" is very highly recommended as excellent entertainment to fans of Elizabeth Gaskell's novels and of Masterpiece Theater.",1210550400,16,2048,5.005917159763314
3121193,5,B00140PK6O,"Cranford aka the Cranford Chronicles, based on Elizabeth Gaskell's story is a stellar production. It is a lush period drama and is very authentic in its portrayal of people living in a little hamlet called Cranford. The sets are beautiful as are the costumes, and of course the production is elevated to a level of excellence by its impeccable casting.

Writer Heidi Thomas does a wonderful job of adapting Elizabeth Gaskell's story [purportedly based on Gaskell's own hometown] and though liberties are taken, the stellar cast more than makes up for whatever deficiencies there may be in the faithfulness of the adaptation. Dame Eileen Atkins [Miss Deborah Jenkins] and Dame Judi Dench [Miss Matty Jenkins] portray two spinster sisters in 1842 who live in the little town of Cranford. Far from being a quiet little hamlet, this little town hums with activity and village gossips, especially a Miss Pole [Imelda Staunton]who flits around from one hearsay to another, avidly passing on any little nuggets of gossip to the other inhabitants.

Cranford is set aflutter by the arrival of a new doctor, Dr Harrison [Simon Woods] who is young, handsome, single and very much into trying new methods of treatment, to the initial consternation of the townspeople. Dr Harrison finds himself attracted to a beautiful local lass, Sophy [Kimberly Nixon] though he inadvertently attracts the romantic affections of other single women in Cranford.

But the story does not merely focus on romance, as there are other more serious themes underlying the series. For one, there is talk of a railroad being built that would go through Cranford, and disrupt the idyllic life in the village, giving rise to the inevitable battle between modernization and the desire for things to remain unchanged. The local rich lady, Lady Ludlow portrayed by Francesca Annis is very much opposed to change, and not only opposes the railroad but also any form of societal change, such as literacy amongst the lower classes [she refuses to hire a maid who is literate, saying the girl's parents did her a disservice by teaching her to read].

There is also the theme of lost love, death and grief. Miss Matty Jenkins[ Judi Dench] finds herself recounting the tale of her lost love [played by Michael Gambon]. This is what makes Cranford such an engaging viewing experience - the absurd [the story of the cat swallowing an anitque lace and how the lace is retrieved] is interlaced with tales of poignancy and everything unfolds leisurely. It is a tale that we wish will never end, and hope to revisit again and again.",1210032000,24,2578,4.960648148148148
3121194,5,B00140PK6O,"I really was beginning to despair, watching the new seemingly paired-down-for-Yankee-taste version of the old Masterpiece Theatre. ""Cranford,"" however, adapted from Elizabeth Gaskill's novel, has restored my faith.

By turns comic,  poignant, tragic, and romantic, this series has everything that not only makes one feel awfully good but also keeps one wanting more. With its host of Dames and Baronets--e.g., Judy Dench, Eileen Atkins, Michael Gambon--the cast can hardly be termed 'peerless', but it is, nevertheless, faultless. Ensemble acting at its best!

""Cranford"" is a scrumptious feast for the eyes, the mind, and the spirit.",1209945600,24,634,5.652631578947369
3121195,5,B00140PK6O,"Finally, a period drama that's neither the same old story nor lost in translation.

I thought Cranford would be a subdued drawn out dramatization but I was pleasantly surprised to find it so engaging at every moment. The adaptation had managed to make every character useful and meaningful in a drama where everyone's a hero at the end of the day. And the actors - please don't make me choose between them. They were all plucked out of Cranford itself, I'm sure.

One theme stood out for me. The danger of conjecturing, the gossip it perpetuates and the lives they can destory. Even so, it was impossible to truly fault the culprits as Gaskell shows that a person should be judged as a whole and not by a single deed alone.

I won't dwell into the details as it is too colorful and summarizing would do it injustice but suffice it to say Cranford was very well written with much thought placed into the evolution of characters and the seamless integration of plots. It has everything a little old town can manage.

Do not hesitate. Watch it!",1207699200,12,1041,4.550802139037433
3121196,5,B00140PK6O,"""Cranford"" is at once a delightful and winning BBC adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's literary works. While lacking the narrative focus of ""Wives and Daughters"" and ""North and South,"" ""Cranford"" still comes out to top crest owing largely to a collection of likeable characters played by veteran and other well-known British actors, and also owing to a masterful interweaving of several storylines taken from Mrs. Gaskell's novel ""Cranford,"" and her other smaller works (novellas,) such as ""My Lady Ludlow"" and ""Mr. Harrison's Confessions."" What could have been a trite exercise comes out fresh because of these qualities.

At the onset, the bucolic and fictional town of Cranford seems quiet and trapped in a former century. But nothing is ever quiet especially where gossiping ladies are concerned; and no ""backward"" town can forever stay asleep, not when a proposed railway which will connect it with other busier counties (such as Manchester) is about to disturb the peace and change town life forever. This is the foundation with which the storylines of ""Cranford"" are set, told in an era where change has been steadily making headways, and the social strata seem to be balancing out.

It should be noted, however, that while ""Cranford"" imparts to its viewers a sense of things on the verge of change, romance and social satire are still the order of the day. Making up the romantic aspect of ""Cranford"" are pairs of lovers who are kept apart either by mischief of fate, familial obligations, or class difference. Complementing these are subplots about a sister's longing for a long-lost brother, a mother's longing for an absent son, and silly feminine passions that explode to embarrassing proportions on two occasions. ""Cranford"" is also replete with satire, as evidenced by its comedy of manners. It spends an amount of its time poking fun at cackling and gossiping ladies. Ultimately, these gossips harm not only their victims, but also the perpetrators themselves, in more ways than one. Other themes of the period are the upper-class bigotry against the education of the lower-class, and also the clinging on to traditions that do no good in the end (as evidenced by Lady Ludlow's decision with regards to a part of her land.) Comparison is also made between the professional attitudes (and aptitudes) of the elder Dr. Morgan and the younger Dr. Harrison.

The descriptions I gave above may mislead you readers to think of ""Cranford"" as dismal and small. On the contrary, ""Cranford"" has a big heart, in the way its inhabitants show charity, neighborliness and compassion when called for. ""Nothing like this is ever done in London,"" comments our young Dr. Harrison on the ladies' generosity. Even the prejudiced Lady Ludlow (played by Francesca Annis) takes a good turn when she spoke to the magistrate on behalf of a poacher who was also wrongly accused of assaulting someone in the night. Amidst all these, Dame Judi Dench plays the younger Jenkyn sister and she somewhat embodies Cranford, which is now on the brink of breaking out to the wave of social changes happening in other places. She had lived under the shadow of her loving but stern sister for most of her life, and we always sense in her some wild undercurrent ready to break out of the mold.

Dames Eileen and Judi, playing the two Jenkyn sisters who never married, are truly a joy to watch. It's so nice to see them in bonnets and in more congenial surroundings. See veteran performances in action (I wished that Dame Maggie Smith were also here, I so much adore her as I do Dames Eileen and Judi.) These two formidable actresses aside, who can beat this roster of veteran actors and other well-knowns who took part in the production: Sir Michael Gambon, Francesca Annis, Imelda Staunton, Lesley Manville, Julia McKenzie, Barbara Flynn, Deborah Findlay, Julia Sawalha, and others. The cast is top rate and so are the production values, which have always been the hallmark of the BBC television series enterprise. Fans of BBC's ""Wives and Daughters"" will not be disappointed with this one.

A point of interest: Hardcore literature buffs may not take kindly to the creative liberties that the filmmakers took with Mrs. Gaskell's works. In the Bonus Features Interview, they admit to changing the fates of certain characters: some died who were supposed to live, and some lived who were supposed to die. And yes, as with ""Wives and Daughters"" and ""North and South,"" ""Cranford"" has its own lot of untimely and diseased deaths, in an era where modern medicine was just making early breakthroughs. One particular death scene near the end (where a leg needed to be amputated) might disturb younger viewers.

Speaking during the interview, producer Sue Birtwistle mentioned the possibility of a sequel should ""Cranford"" do very well. I'd be bold enough to speak in behalf of fans: We certainly hope that a follow-up comes soon. At five episodes, ""Cranford"" feels like a joyous ride that ended too soon. Fans certainly like to be ""BBC-spoiled"" now and then. If this were to come true, I hope to see more British veteran actors (particularly Dame Maggie) taking part in Mrs. Gaskell's insightful stories.

3121197,5,B00140PK6O,"I ordered this from Amazon UK to be able to view this prior to its release date.  I was not disappointed! Sadly, I had to watch it by myself because my husband didn't think he'd like it.  He would have been wrong, by the way. It was exquisite in every way.

I watched it over 2 nights. It's a 5 hour miniseries and it is broken up into five 1 hour-long episodes.

The first 3 hours were very very good. Excellent, even.  But the last 2 hours were absolutely perfect.

In Cranford, we meet many of its residents with most of the focus on 2 spinster sisters and their surrounding friends and relatives.  Everyone is kind here and look out for their neighbors and generally want to live correctly and do the right thing.  Their village has been like this for ages and the citizens have all known eachother since birth. It is an idyllic place and a happy place.  They welcome new residents, too, with every bit of friendliness.

Cranford has existed in the same way for years, even though times are changing. A railroad may come through the town and most residents are against this type of change. For with the positive changes-- such as information, goods, and knowledge, there would also be negative changes-- more transients, less safety, etc.

The intertwined story lines here involve the two sisters, class distinctions, entitlements and expectations, a very funny love triangle, and accepting change and modernity.

One of the best stories involves the young son of a poacher (one who kills animals on others' land).  The manager of the aristocrat's large estate takes the young boy under his wing and wants to teach him to read and write.  The aristocratic Lady finds out and believes that those of this underclass should not attempt to learn skills outside their ""class"".  Maybe worse, the boy's father finds out of the boy's desire to read and also disapproves.  We find out later that the Lady isn't cold-hearted. On the contrary.  She's kind-hearted and full of pain, yet it's difficult for her to recognize the times are changing and that some of her ways must change, too.

When a new handsome doctor moves to town, he immediately falls for Sophy.  Sophy returns his admiration, yet so do 2 others who misunderstand his general kindness for more romantic intentions.  This culminates in expected confusion, but the outcome is happy at the end.

Those watching Cranford from the beginning may take it to be an old-fashioned chick-flick.  It's really not, though.  It does focus on the women of Cranford more than the men, but the stories depicted cross gender lines.  Change-- industrialization-- is the antagonist here, along with fear of change.  However, as new medical practices save several lives, and a member of the trade class saves a member of the Upper class, it's also obvious that change, by itself, isn't bad.  It can be positive for everyone involved.

This is a fantastic series.  The only disappointment was that it was only five hours! I definitely could have watched another few episodes with the same interest these five held.  Beautifully acted, filmed, and scored.  The entire film was thoroughly enjoyable.",1205452800,263,3136,4.818352059925093

While this film has not been shown on American TV as yet I was lucky enough to stumble across the entire film on youtube where it was  shown in 9 minute segments. Its a quiet film with rich and wonderful characters long remembered. I was afraid that Judi Dench would overpower her role but nothing like it. She was perfect in her poignantly sad but joyfully rising role. It's about the town Cranford, that is fearful of changes being brought by the arrival of the railway. No one of course wants the charm of Old English ways to change and one gets very attached to the warm and sad and silly and funny characters in  Cranford. Cranford really is a place one wishes to live and to never leave nor have change. I loved it, anglophile that I am, so this is a creation made just for me and I can't wait to own it when it is released.

3121239,4,B00140PK6O,"""All around us England shifts and changes but Cranford stands fast. Its women are like Amazons, and to those who live here it is the world entire.""

But change is inevitable. And in ""Cranford,"" the changes to their little village have massive repercussions -- social, technological, personal and sometimes involving a cow wearing pajamas. As the miniseries is based on novellas by Elizabeth Gaskell, it balances out the romance and personal hijinks of Cranford's ladies with some wickedly pointed social satire.

Most of the well-off people in Cranford are middle-aged ladies (mostly widows and spinsters), who spread any interesting gossip faster than twitter. Over the course of the story there are some tragic deaths, some romances, a scandal or two, a rash of thefts and the looming approach of the railway. Yep, the railroad is approaching Cranford, though the people there are doing their best to ignore and/or avoid it.

Mary Smith (Lisa Dillon) comes to live with the Jenkyns sisters, Deborah (Eileen Atkins) and Matty (Judi Dench). Unfortunately, problems soon begin cropping up -- Matty is hit by two tragic personal losses and a financial disaster, forcing her to change the way she lives her life. At the same time, young Dr. Harrison brings new medical advances to Cranford... but he ends up the target of several ladies' affections, which threatens him with scandal.

Meanwhile, haughty, wealthy Lady Ludlow (Francesca Annis) is risking bankruptcy to finance her ne'er-do-well son Septimus. Her land agent Mr. Carter (Philip Glenister) becomes determined to educate a bright but illiterate poacher's son, Harry (Alex Etel). But Lady Ludlow begins fighting him over this, since she loathes the idea of lower-class people being even somewhat educated.

... and various other stories involving dead dogs, cows in pajamas, a cat that swallows some antique lace, a risky operation to save a carpenter's arm, bank failure, some poaching, and Matty's long-lost brother.

""Cranford"" gives the feeling of a country on the brink of great changes -- changes in social strata, women's rights, technology and society -- and these are mirrored in the smaller changes in the village itself. But the heart of Cranford is the people who live there -- and the romances, the tragedies, the friendships and kindness they show each other.

And that is what makes it such an enjoyable experience. It can elicit tears (Mrs. Forrester confessing why she cares so much for Matty) as easily as laughter (the cow pajamas), and the mingling of romance, comedy and tragedy ends up feeling very... well, real. The dialogue is witty and clever (""My father was a man. I think I understand the sex!"") and it moves from one subplot to another with nimble grace.

And since this is based on a book by Elizabeth Gaskell, there's a hefty dose of social satire mixed in -- partly for the gossipy Cranford ladies and the inadvertent harm they do, and partly for the class snobbery of Lady Ludlow. If there's a problem, it's that you can get mood whiplash from how quickly they go from light to dark, dark to light -- within an episode, we go from wacky misadventures to two characters dying. That's pretty tough.

The cast is also top-notch here, especially Judi Dench as the angelically sweet, somewhat timid Miss Matty (""I never liked the notion that the world is round. Makes me feel so giddy""). She's backed by the excellent Julia McKenzie, Imelda Staunton, Dillon, Jim Carter, Etel, Annis, Woods and Julia Sawalha, among others -- we have outspoken spinsters, naive young men, clever young boys, haughty nobility and women who may have lost their only chance at love.

And all the characters are beautifully fleshed out, often without being too obvious or explicit. Even when they're in the wrong -- Lady Ludlow's class snobbery, or Deborah's dislike of Mr. Holbrook -- they are not necessarily bad people, just incorrect.

""Cranford"" is a tragic, comic, dramatic and fascinating little series, studying the inevitable changes that are marching toward Cranford -- but which can never change the fast friendships among its citizens.",1403568000,,4111,5.048672566371682

The gossip in the close knit little town often leads to humorous situations, while the sweetness of the characters leads to compassion through their sorrows. Overall, I found Cranford to be ""family friendly"" with the possible exceptions of an incident with a broken arm (protruding bone) and another that insinuates a child using a large rock to finish killing a rabbit caught in a trap (although it only shows a rabbit lying on the ground & the child raising the rock). By today's standards those scenes are very mild (I've seen much worse on TV, but wanted to mention them should anyone with small children be concerned).

In my favorite English dramas, there is either a great, passionate romance to be consumated, or a deep, dark secret to be revealed, or a complex mystery to be solved.  Cranford didn't have any of these.  What Cranford did offer was an interesting slice of life from the 1840s.  However, for my tastes, it included too many unconnected small stories, entertaining as they may have been (some were quite entertaining).  And I was hoping for one great story.

3121265,5,B00140PK6O,"If you are a fan of British historical dramas, then you could enjoy ""Cranford.""  It may be a bit slower for some who might expect it to be something like ""Downton Abbey,"" but for those who enter into the backwater self-enclosed (or so it may seem at first) world of Cranford, you might well be charmed by it.

Set in a small town in the 1840's England, the story of Cranford is based on the interactions of a finely-knit ensemble of characters--including the marvelous Judi Dench and other actors you will easily recognize if you have watched much British television or even the Harry Potter movies--as they either fight to hold on to the past or to bring in the future.  The stories range from poor squatters who must poach to bring food to the table to the lonely Lady of the Manor who seems cold at first, until you realize she is a woman in pain.  The town gossip with a feather in her cap is absolutely hilarious and you will never forget the incident with the cat and the buttermilk.

Many of the main characters are women, including spinsters and widows, and they gossip about any and everything and are shocked (oh my!) by the idea of new muslins from Paris or who might have given new gloves to someone else and consult their book about what a bunch of flowers might mean when received.  Let alone all of the trouble that a single Valentine's Day card can cause.

This is the story of a gentle age, when men and women still bowed to each other and people of a certain class all strived to adhere to an understood moral compass.  Yet, the story also addresses the trials of being poor and hungry at that time, of lost loves and opportunities, the misfortunes and grief of death, and how that same compass might be wrong when it comes to who deserved an education or to open a business of their very own.

The storyline was based off of several novellas, with some additions, but it retains the witty commentary of the times by the author.  If you open your heart to Cranford, it won't disappoint.",1370908800,,2004,4.435967302452316

3121286,5,B00140PK6O,"This production of CRANFORD caps off the BBC's initiative to dramatise the works of Mrs Elizabeth Gaskell, which began in 1999 with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wives-and-Daughters/dp/B000GIXLUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wives and Daughters</a>&nbsp;and continued with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/North-South/dp/B000AYEL6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">North & South</a>.  Arguably the most popular and beloved of all Mrs Elizabeth Gaskell's works, CRANFORD was partially based on Gaskell's memories of a real Cheshire village in which she had lived for a time, called Knutsford.  This quiet, uncomplicated novel is really a series of vignettes - some comical, some romantic and others deeply moving - when woven together create the rich tapestry of life in a tight-knit village which is teetering on the edge of change.  For this 5-part miniseries of CRANFORD, screenwriter Heidi  Thomas has combined the original ""Cranford"" with two additional Gaskell manuscripts - ""My Lady Ludlow"" and ""Mr Harrison's Confessions"".

We arrive in Cranford with Mary Smith (Lisa Dillon), who has graciously been accepted to stay with the Jenkyns sisters.  With a tiresome, matchmaking stepmother (Finty Williams) and an ever-increasing brood of stepsiblings back in Manchester, Mary is hoping for rest and respite... what she gets however is anything but!

To her amusement, Mary discovers Cranford to be a community governed by it's unusually high percentage of older female residents.  One particular small circle holds more influence than the others - Cranford's ""Amazons"" are the formidable Miss Pole (Imelda Staunton), Mrs Forrester (Julia McKenzie), Mrs Jamieson (Barbara Flynn), Miss Tomkinson (Deborah Findlay), Miss Deborah Jenkyns (Dame Eileen Atkins) and her sister, Miss Matty (Dame Judi Dench).  Together, these ladies are Cranford's very lifeblood, the bastion of decency and a support system of mutual friendship.

Mary's arrival in Cranford coincides with the posting of a new, young doctor, Frank Harrison (Simon Woods), who quickly becomes caught up in a scheme of matchmaking with several residents.  Also newly-arrived in town is the impoverished Captain Brown (Jim Gordon) and his daughter Jessie (Julia Sawalha).  At the nearby estate of Hanbury Court, the ageing Lady Ludlow (Francesca Annis) keeps things running smoothly for the county, clinging to the safety of past traditions, but finds herself in a losing battle with the looming prospect of a railway line cutting into her land, bringing with it that dreaded thing called ""progress"".  Progress is already much closer than she thinks, in the small body of Harry Gregson (Alex Etel), a gypsy boy whose hunger for knowledge is recognised by Lady Ludlow's overseer Edmund Carter (Philip Glenister), and Miss Galindo (Emma Fielding), Lady Ludlow's milliner.

CRANFORD is an ensemble piece, but the bulk of the action emanates from the house of the Jenkyns sisters.  Most of what happens unfolds through the eyes of Mary Smith (the book's narrator) and if there's a ""lead"" character it's most definitely Miss Matty, who is one of the most delightful figures in all literature.  Screenwriter Heidi Thomas (""Madame Bovary"", ""Lillies"", ""Upstairs Downstairs"") is one of my favourites and somehow always manages to distill all the best dialogue from the original source but make it fresh again for the screen.

The performances are sublime.  The BBC always furnishes their costume dramas with first-rate talents, but the cast in CRANFORD is simply extraordinary.  With Dames Atkins and Dench leading the way as the Jenkyns sisters, all is well with the world.  In particular I adore Judi Dench's Miss Matty; she brings out a lovely child-like quality to the character.  There's also a few ""Gaskell veterans"" reunited here in CRANFORD (Francesca Annis, Michael Gambon, Barbara Flynn and Deborah Findlay all appeared in the BBC's earlier adaptation of Gaskell's ""Wives and Daughters"").

I cannot recommend this highly enough.",1333584000,2,4067,5.765886287625418

3121297,5,B00140PK6O,"Judi Dench does a fantastic job of headlining the BBC miniseries Cranford.  Cranford is a small, rural, English town, and the miniseries follows the lives and times of people who live there.  The main storyline centers on a group of elderly unmarried women, including Dench.  There is also the Lady who lives in the manor house and who is the local member of the house of Lords.

Life in rural 1800s England is a happy and tragic thing.  Though the town has a doctor, there was little that doctors could do at the time to deal with disease or serious injury, and death was a common part of life.  At the same time, people found joy in each other's company and the small and simple things of life.

This series has a sort of Dickinsonian/Austenesque quality to it.

The sets are fantastic, the costuming is amazing, and the storylines and acting are top-notch.  I found myself gaining an increased understanding of and appreciation for England and the English experience through watching this miniseries.

Of course, this series is not for everyone.  If you are guy looking for an action-adventure flick, keep on walking, you won't find what you are looking for here.  If, however, you are a viewer who enjoys history, period films, drama, and BBC-style work, then welcome home!

My wife and I watched Cranford together and just could not get enough.  The script is perfection, the set decoration is superb, the acting top notch and the music score is well done.  Like some of the others commented; the only disappointment was that it was only five hours long! I definitely could have watched more episodes had they stretched this out. Beautifully acted, filmed, and scored. The entire production was thoroughly enjoyable and wholesome, albeit a little gruesome at some points for young children.  The only thing I didn't like is the name of the village; 'Cranford'.  The village name makes it sound like a clunky American soap opera - which it is not.  The writing is just superb, the cast and acting even better.  It is hard to say who my favorite character was, but easy to pick the best actor.... the little boy (son of the poacher)who was taught at the manor was exceptionally brilliant - as are all the others.  Not a lemon in the bunch!  I was disappointed each time credits began to roll signafying the end of an episode.  I just did not want this to end.  By the way, use the captions if you have a hard time understanding any of the heavier British accents as I occasionally did.  Clears things right up.  I can't wait for some time to pass so that I can watch this series again in freshness someday, (I often watch good movies as many as 20 or more times; e.g. Key Largo, etc.).",1290297600,2,1567,4.4491228070175435

I found this series while browsing and decided to try it.  While Upstairs Downstairs lives are conducted against a background of early 20th century transitions, including class discord, woman's rights, World War I and technological changes like the radio, telephone, automobile, and weapons of mass destruction, those of the Cranford characters are lived against one of equal change and social disruption.

Here again massive differences in the well being of the different social classes, the acceptable behavior of women, the introduction of new techniques in medicine, the introduction of mass transport in the form of the railroads, all challenge the status quo, making the everyday events of the lives of these characters--at least from our own perspective--a drama of considerable proportion.  The fact that every generation, including our own, is faced with such changes allows us to understand the sense of threat felt by the elders in the series and the sense of expectation and hope felt by the younger people.

That the fear of the older generation is not necessarily justified as much as they think it is is also apparent, as again it is in Upstairs Downstairs, with each episode.  Just as is the unwarranted expectation by the younger members of society that change will necessarily improve everything.  The episodes show us, in fact, that the more things change, the more they stay the same.  Mostly it's just the technology that changes.  This is an important bit of knowledge for us and should moderate our own expectations, as we rush into an even more technology driven age in the 21st century and to globalization.

For those to whom this type of fiction is unfamiliar, the period is roughly that of the American Civil War in the United States and midway through the long Reign of Queen Victoria in England.  The elderly ladies would have been the Miss Dashwoods (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sense-And-Sensibility/dp/1440469563/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sense And Sensibility</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sense-Sensibility-Special-Edition/dp/0800141660/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sense & Sensibility (Special Edition)</a>) and Miss Bennets (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pride-And-Prejudice/dp/1453693319/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pride And Prejudice</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pride-and-Prejudice-The-Special-Edition-A-E-1996/dp/B00005MP58/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E, 1996)</a>), those of Jane Austin's pen, in their own neighborhood in earlier days and whose fortunes had landed them in the various social and financial positions we find them at the beginning of the series.  Society, just as in earlier times, rigidly enforces its expectations and no one is left untouched by it.  The elder generation especially, having paid its dues, perpetuates and enforces the code with ferocity. Lady Ludlow angrily refuses a lower class girl looking to enter her service for being educated ""above her station"" and insists that these orders of society need no education because it gives them ""dangerous ideas"" and results in the violence of the French revolution.  Just as assuredly that change is in the air is reflected by the activities and attitudes of her land agent Edmund Carter who encourages the boy Harry Greigson, who has become the defacto head of his houseold by virtue of an inconstant father.

The cinematography of the work is lovely, as it usually is in a BBC series.  The village and the housing in it are very realistically presented and thematically evocative.  The character of each home clearly reflects the social status and financial wherewithal of the people living in them. There is no doubt, for instance, that the widowed doctor's wife has enjoyed some degree of comfort and social standing in the past, but that she has fallen on hard times since her husband died.  The walls are dark with peeling paint, the woodwork is also in need of repair, and little of the gracious life is left except a few pieces of good furniture looking marooned in the large rooms.  The presence of affluence but the absence of a woman's influence, reflected in the fine house and furnishings with noticeable dust of farmer Thomas Holbrook, tells of an elderly bachelor whose disappointment in love left him with nothing but money to keep him company.  The respectable, well kept household of the Jenkyns sisters reflects their status as spinsters left with the last of a family's fortune and their own respectable characters with which to live out their lives.  While the meager lodgings of Captain Brown and his family reveals their status of dependency on the good will of Major Gordon.

The costumes are quite intriguing.  Unlike the more loosely fitting and occasionally provocative empire-waist dresses of the earlier part of the century enjoyed by the Jane Austin characters--and Empress Josephine--the gowns of the period are more confining, figure disguising, and ""proper.""  Their yards and yards of material mean that few but the more affluent can afford them--thus making a less financially well endowed individual more conspicuous and avoidable in the marriage market.  More importantly they reflect a society less sure of itself and more inclined to harken back to the grandure of the 18th century than to the youthful enthusiasm of the earlier part of the 19th.

Though the series is definitely a drama, it has frequent comedic events that are quite funny.  The social climbing Mrs. Jameison in her little sedan chair being run about by over worked footmen in pursuit of the most recent gossip is quite amusing as is the outrageous tale of ""the fate of the vintage lace.""  Although she drops out early in the series, my favorite character is Deborah Jenkyns, played with great skill by Eileen Atkins.  She is a wonderful blend of rigidly upright elder with a heart of gold and a will of iron.  Her sister Matilda, played by Judi Dench, has less to say for herself until almost half way through the first series, when it becomes apparent that she, like the younger character of Miss Brown, had given up her chance of happiness in marriage out of a sense of duty to her family.  The dnouement of the final act of her lovestory, while very predictable, was none the less poignant in its impact and very meaningful in the context of Miss Brown's more recent and ill-considered sacrifice.  The viewer is left in no doubt as to the likely fate of Miss Brown.

3121305,5,B00140PK6O,"Feeling sorry for myself after multiple lung problems requiring me to take load of meds and time off from work (but NOT in the fun way), my darling Brit husband and I watched this wonderful BBC series featuring one of my favorite actresses, Judi Dench.  Anything Dame Judi touches is pure gold in my Anglophile eyes and this was no exception.

A period British costume 5 part BBC series told in one hour increments, each one topped the other.  Beautifully acted, staged and set, kudos must go to Eileen Atkins, Judi Dench, Lisa Dillon and Imeda Staunton along with Simon Woods, John Bowe and Francecsa Annis that make this quaint 19th century British village come to life.

Manners matter.  Visitors may call upon you after 3 o'clock but not a moment before.  The introduction of a new, young village doctor gets the ladies bosom's heaving, imaginations going into overdrive with misunderstandings making it only more delightful.

It is not acted in broad strokes but in small intricate ones that compose the moral compass of the entire village afraid of change whether involving a new neighbor or the imposing railroad linking them to Manchester.

I know its the middle of the summer, but I am putting this on my Christmas list.  My husband is going out to pick up its sequel.  He enjoyed it as much as I did.

While North and South is my favorite of her books and her adaptations, this one is so different it is hard to compare with anything else and you have to love it as one of a kind.  It is a story about a little world all its own and I really enjoyed this adaptation of 3 stories into one because it was done very well.",1275955200,2,415,3.9285714285714284
3121307,5,B00140PK6O,"This is a masterpiece of historical dramatization.  While faithful to the novel, it translates the action and emotion into a format for modern viewers.  My family has watched this several times with increasing delight at the subtle personalities, the social issues that are evoked, and the lives as they go forward.  The great accomplishment of the series is that, while often funny to the point of absurdity, it never falls into the territory of sitcom or burlesque.  Instead, it retains both its realism and social relevancy in the most exquisite of dramas.  The milieu, while superficially familiar, is in fact quite alien.  Isolated, it is in the thick of victorian era, which can only be described as extremely rarified, full of rules, customs, and traditions that shape decisions that are astonishingly personal, cause mortal worries about the most banal concerns, and lead to intricate misunderstandings.  It is always believable and emotionally accurate, never parody.

The cast of characters appears normal, at least for their time. There is Matty, whose elder sister Deborah is the arbiter of ""the proper"" in town.  They look out the windows, judging people they see in the street and discussing what course of action would be best.  They take in a niece, who becomes an intimate part of their household because she wishes  to aviod a hasty (or perhaps any) marriage.  A young doctor also comes to town, brimming with ideals and ready to work.  Finally, the gameskeeper for a local aristocrat takes on the welfare of a wonderful child, whose family is part gypsy and dirt poor.  As these characters interact and adapt to the changing world, more and more is revealed, to the point that their cares and hopes become beautifully, painfully poignant.

For example, as the young doctor establishes himself as innovative and competent, he is noticed as the most eligible bachelor in a town of gossipy spinsters.  Though he is in love with a local beauty, two older women become convinced he is about to propose to them, in part because of his own kindness but also by a bad practical joke.  When the situation is discovered, he is nearly ruined by the many assumptions people make about his motives.  Another episode involves the sad resolution of an old love:  the beau reappears, after perhaps 40 years, to the woman who refused him because her family needed her due to a personal tragedy.  They loved each other the whole time.  It brought tears to my eyes.

The overwhelming impression, at the end, is one of grace.  You come to admire these people, hope for them, and even question your own behavior.  Indeed, according to my wife, a principal purpose of the novels is to pose social dilemmas to the reader.  Very powerful stuff.  Also, unlike the all's-well-that-ends-well stuff that makes many Dickens' endings so sickeningly unbelievable, these novels often end in pain and loss, though the decent society of the town makes up for a lot of it.  There are no deus ex machina solutions.

3121320,4,B00140PK6O,"I should begin by saying that I came to this BBC DVD full of curiosity as to how the producers would choose to adapt Mrs Gaskell's novel. Ever since discovering her novels some three decades ago, I've been a fan of her writing.  Unlike Thackeray, who is charming but somewhat distant (at least for me) or Dickens, who is (in my opinion) too often over-blown and given over to sentimentality, or George Eliot, who intrudes too much with her use of Authorial Voice, Mrs Gaskell is a minimalist. Working on a very small canvas - in this case the small village of Knutsford, here transformed into the fictionalized Cranford - she delicately and incisively picks out many themes that are otherwise almost entirely neglected by her contemporaries. Subjects such as the emancipation of women and their suitability to take larger roles in society are exquisitely touched upon, but unlike Dickens or Eliot Mrs Gaskell never hectors, never lectures, and never sets her art in second place to her desire for social reform.  In my mind this makes her more effective than her peers and certainly a more enjoyable read. I've often re-read North and South for pleasure whereas I've read Hard Times just once. Mrs Gaskell's book is balanced and thoughtful whereas Dickens' work is strident, crude and highly polar.

So how did the BBC fare with their adaptation?  In one word: magnificently. Not only did the writer stay close to the spirit of the book (strictly, a book-in-three-parts, as was typical of the day), but also the director and crew did a superb job of trying to whisk us back in time. Most period dramas are too obviously modern-day actors and actresses in period dress; in Cranford we capture a much more authentic feeling of being back in the 1850s. Of course the actors still have teeth (which the real inhabitants of Cranford would too often have lacked) and they have nice skin that is free of flea-bites, rashes, and the other thousand-and-one inevitable blemishes that were the norm back then, and no one has any trace of pox-mark (again very common even in the well-to-do of the period) but we can overlook these things because they would shock a modern audience and detract from the story.  Instead, the producers cast older actresses for the lead roles which achieves nearly the same effect (in other words, modern-day actresses in their 50s and 60s made up to look very old and wrinkled are cast as characters who are chronologically a decade or more younger than the people who portray them). While with a good diet and healthy lifestyle one can be a very vital and youthful 60-year-old today, back in the 1850s women were nearly worn-out by their late 30s. Cranford captures this reality in a way that is not over-stressed but which creates the right undertone for the stories that unfold.

Cranford is about life. About the women who missed out on it (all the many genteel spinsters who for one reason or another never married, raised families, or were able to go out into the world and contribute), about the younger generation who have more chances to move beyond the home and hearth, and about great loss of all kinds. Although the stories are generally light-hearted there is a great deal of death in Cranford, reflecting actual mortality rates of the day. There are broken dreams, hopes withered, and years lost to the river of time.  Most of all there is the dramatic tension between the old women who wish everything to remain static (because then, pace Miss Haversham in Dickens' later work Great Expectations, one can pretend that life has also stood still instead of raced on and passed one by) and those who accept and even embrace change as the mechanism by means of which life can, to some degree, improve.  Whereas Dickens would have taken sides, Mrs Gaskell allows us to see both sides as human, humane, and vulnerable.  Our sympathies are engaged while at the same time we see how there are no simple rights or wrongs. This BBC production is admirable for retaining this multi-faceted aspect of Cranford and for being so delicate with the core themes. A glance from Miss Matty, now an ancient spinster whose own dreams of marriage turned to dust decades earlier, at the young and beautiful Sophie Hutton as she rides away in her wedding carriage, speaks more about loss and generosity of spirit than any monologue or dialogue ever could.

The series thus contains nearly all the treasures of the book but also its only failing. Mrs Gaskell was temperamentally suited to working in miniatures, rather like Vermeer. In consequence she could not incorporate other elements of life. If Dickens was Titian working with great dramatic sweeps and violent movements and Hardy was Rembrant dealing with darkness and light, Gaskell could touch out the finest corners and gentlest details but at the cost of missing most of mankind's less amiable characteristics. Her characters are uniformly well-intentioned with hearts of gold (sometimes hidden for a while behind gossip or affected coldness or brusqueness, but always golden within). This makes for delightful and often poignant viewing but ultimately provides a very limited, dare one say ""spinsteresque"" view of the world which can only work in a highly circumscribed setting such as Cranford. Her women are wonderfully resourceful, funny, clever and interesting but her men are essentially little more than stereotypes. Mrs Gaskell was, ultimately, as constrained as her characters by the rules of the society in which she lived. She too could not go out into the ""wider world"" and experience its terrors and elations; she had to sit at home by the parlor embroidering wonderfully enchanting tales of women who likewise lived their lives at home by the parlor.  Thus her characters and her themes are always sotto voce. This is her great charm and her great limitation.  This wonderful BBC series is faithful to her milieu.",1251417600,3,5897,4.891891891891892

For Americans who saw this on PBS, a pleasant surprise is that there are speeches and brief scenes on the BBC DVD sold on Amazon that were never aired on PBS!  Some of those are relevant; for example, Mary asks Ms. Pole what her cousin (the Michael Gambon character) did after Miss Mattie refused  him. We learn on the DVD he avoided Cranford for 30 years. I'm sure that section of the scene was deleted on PBS's version.  There are numerous other scenes like that throughout this set.  If you are NOT the type of person to like period dramas set in 1800's England villages, this is not the series for you.

Now the bad news:  I should have purchased it through [...].  Why?  It comes in 2 discs and EACH time you view EACH disc you have to sit through 5-10 minutes of commercials from the BBC.  On any other DVD that I've purchased, you can fast forward to get to the Menu.  With this one you cannot do that.

Honestly, here I am paying for a DVD and I still have to watch advertisements.

The other thing I found frustrating with the actual viewing is the sound editing.  Very poor!  I had to go back on more than one occasion to try and hear what the actors were saying.  It's a combination of the actors talking way too fast and the microphone not catching everything they say.

3121343,5,B00140PK6O,I really enjoyed this film. It started out different than I had expected compared to the other Elizabeth Gaskell films that BBC has put out. I also own Wives & Daughters and North & South. I LOVE them both and was expecting Cranford to be somewhat the same. What I realized is that Cranford is character driven while the other two are more plot driven. The first hour was a little slow but it got more and more entertaining as I went and by the time it was over I had laughed and cried and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Now I think I will go back and watch it again and I am sure the first hour will be even more interesting to me. Judi Dench was amazing in this film. She played such a simple women and she did it powerfully. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys clean well made period films.,1236902400,,804,4.193548387096774

I truly enjoyed this and the most wonderful part was to see how the women were actually so in command of the town and daily life.  As a hobbyist costumer I roared over Imelda Staunton's lace dilemma.  that woman is SO funny. .. .even when she's serious.  Judi Dench is absolutely marvelous as the weaker of the two sisters (can you believe it of strong Judi Dench?) and on the whole, the cast is brilliant--and followers of BBC costume dramas will recognize more than one or two familiar faces.  That might be a turnoff for some but welcome for others.  I received this DVD as a Valentine gift from my husband and will watch it again and again.",1236816000,,702,4.4453125
3121345,5,B00140PK6O,"""Oh,"" you say, ""This just looks like yet another British costume drama they show on PBS.""

Well, yes it is.  But don't write ""Cranford"" off.  Heck, for that matter, don't write any costume drama off.  But ""Cranford"" in particular is great TV.  Based upon three books, the story ingeniously weaves in the tales of the denizens of the small village.  The uniformly excellent cast and production values makes this one of the best television miniseries in some time.

Special mention must go to the screenwriters who took the original source material - which is funny and entertaining - and managing to make a tale that has real dramatic heft.  It's no easy feat, especially if you're familiar with the book.  ""Cranford"" is one of the most satisfying five hours of television you'll ever watch.",1236643200,,790,4.835820895522388

I watched them all and now I'm starting again. If you like that period in time - you will love these DVDs, if I were you I would purchase the collection so you have all 3 stories.

I have a large collection of BBC period/historical DVDs and after passing over this title several times, I recieved it for Christmas. This is a story written and produced by women about women and the loving touch is evident everywhere. I especially enjoyed seeing Simon Woods (you'll recognize him from Pride and Prejudice, 2005 as Mr. Bingley) and Imelda Stanton (Dolores Umbridge, Harry Potter and O of P) sans pink suite. And of course, there's Judi Dench. She's just wonderful as the younger sister: Touching, sad, lively and ever hopeful. I wonder if Dame Judi  needs an extra granddaughter? I'd like to be invited over for tea sometime.

Anyway, make yourself a nice cup of tea (not the green stuff, it's bad for your liver and you'll find out who thinks so), make some time for yourself and watch this beautiful and loving and funny story about the Ladies of Cranford.

3121351,5,B00140PK6O,"One of the glories of recent television history, ""Cranford"" is thoroughly delightful.  A story with overlapping plot points hinging on petty small-town customs, it has deeper undercurrents and themes, which underscore the universality of how tradition, the individual, and the larger world intersect.  The universally flawless performances (something nearly unheard of in Hollywood productions) of the British cast, some very familiar, some much less so, with an exceptional screenplay cobbled together from several novels make for an experience that surpasses most period pieces.  What at first seems to be a superficial satire of an isolated village overseen by a variety of small-minded elder women ruled by meaningless conventions and intentionally oblivious to the larger world becomes a story of how people adapt as a result of the personal and social forces around them, and how all this can bring out the inherent goodness in most people.  This last quality is what is ultimately so rewarding.  An optimistic and rosy-hued perspective to be sure, but it manages to be very, very sweet without making your teeth hurt.  In other hands it could have been a silly, treacly, manipulative farce, as it incorporates elements of camp, comedy, and social satire as well as social realism and tragedy, but here it makes you weep and wish for more.",1234396800,3,1345,5.232558139534884

3121360,5,B00140PK6O,"The BBC never does anything half-way, and so goes CRANFORD, the story of a mid-19th century British town created by Elizabeth Gaskell and brought to life by screenwriter Heidi Thomas. Already nominated for ten BAFTA awards, eight Emmys, and three Golden Globes, this five episode miniseries is masterfully done in all aspects, including content, design and acting.

Taking place over one year -- from the summer of 1842 to the summer of 1843 -- the miniseries chronicles the struggles of one township and its unflagging residents as they battle rumors, financial ruin, educational boundaries, medical plights, and the threat of change brought by an unwelcome railroad line.

With a stunning 25 member prime cast, the BBC pulled out all the stops to make this a star-studded affair. They include Dame Judi Dench (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casino-Royale/dp/B000MRA5NS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casino Royale</a>), Simon Woods (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pride-Prejudice/dp/B000E1ZBGS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pride & Prejudice</a>), Imelda Staunton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freedom-Writers/dp/B000OONQ8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freedom Writers</a>), Jim Carter (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Compass/dp/B00139XZF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Compass</a>), Alex Jenkins (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Queen/dp/B000NTPDK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Queen</a>), and Francesca Annis (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Libertine/dp/B000F7CECK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Libertine</a>) ...just to name a few.

Funny, compassionate, and often heart-wrenching, Cranford is a town the audience dives into and submerges themselves. We become intimate witnesses to everything, and most of this is accomplished through the eyes of Mary Smith played by Lisa Dillon (whom I gave top billing to rather than Dame Judi Dench). Upon Mary's arrival in Cranford at the very beginning of the first episode we witness the trials, successes and failures of just about everyone within Cranford's fold. Overseeing most of Cranford's wealth is Lady Ludlow (Francesca Annis) who often delivers swift and hard decisions on the town but softens as time goes by. Helping her (and in her employ) is Mr. Carter (Philip Glenister,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kingdom-of-Heaven/dp/B000AARKOO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kingdom of Heaven</a>) who helps oversee her business and tries to keep Ms. Ludlow from destroying her wealth. Helping Mr. Carter is Harry (Alex Etel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Water-Horse/dp/B0012IWRDM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Water Horse</a>), the child of squatters and battling a life of education versus hard labor.

But I would be seriously remiss if I didn't mention the main ladies of Cranford for whom everything encircles. Mainly this is Matty Jenkyns (Dench) and -- initially -- her sister Deborah (Eileen Atkins), whom Mary Smith comes to live with during the first episode. Deborah (Atkins) is the somewhat overbearing but incredibly hospitable sister who fears change more than anything but grudgingly accepts it (this is shown during an early funeral scene when she walks behind the carriage). Matty (Dench) is the more accepting sister who learns that love never really dies, it sometimes just takes a lot longer to blossom (via friendship, old romances, or a simple child).

The other two women that I MUST mention are the comedic relief within the series (and the heaviest gossipers), Miss Pole (Imelda Staunton) and Mrs. Forrester (Julia McKenzie). These two trouble-making but vitally important characters were the glue that helped hold Cranford together ...and sometimes threatened to tear it apart (for instance, when the new doctor was thought to have been engaged to three different women, much of the blame could be placed on these two women's shoulders for the misunderstanding).

There is, of course, much more going on in this series than I would want to write about (mainly for fear of boring you or causing cramps from typing too much ...or both). Rest assured you should see this. It is quaint, fun, and simply brilliant. Enjoy another Masterpiece Theater spectacle.",1231027200,3,4478,6.712068965517242

Where the movie is clean I would not recommend it for children under 10.  There is a broken arm where you see the bone protruding, an amputation where you don't actually see it but you see the big saw and you hear it.  There are many sad deaths in the movie...sad because you have come to love them and want their story line to keep going.

There are many funny parts that had me rolling and I have to say some I did not catch until the second time I watched it.

3121382,4,B00140PK6O,"A wonderfully engaging translation of several of Mrs. Gaskell's novellas to the screen.  While the knitting together of the stories isn't as perfect as the the knitting of the residents of Cranford, it does very well.

The central characters of the story, set in mid-nineteenth century England, are two spinster daughters of a clergyman, Dorothea and Mathilda Jenkyns (Miss Jenkyns and Miss Matty to you!)  Even though Miss Jenkyns is of a forceful nature (and beautifully portrayed by Eileen Atkins), it is dear shy Miss Matty  (Dame Judi Dench) who dominates events because of the respect everyone feels for her sweet nature. They and their neighbors must contend with the changes associated with the disconcerting transformation of rural Britain by the Industrial Revolution, as well as with the inherent challenges of life.  The ladies face poverty, death, servant problems, love, wandering cows, evil stepmothers, and questions of attire with aplomb, assisted by a few brave men:  the frank and winning Captain Brown; Mr. Morgan, the doctor, and Mr. Harrison, the doctor's new young partner, who has recently set the hearts of all the village maidens aflutter.  At a distance reigns the aging but elegant Lady Ludlow and her steward Mr. Carter, who must decide how to deal with a local poacher and his bright and capable young son, and how to pay the mortgage on the estate.

This series is wonderfully acted and beautifully produced--really a living window on a vanished life.  Each character grows and develops, sometimes in unexpected ways--sometimes funny and sometimes poignant.  The most winning thing was the way in which, as much as they contended and struggled with each other at times, the ladies always faced real emergencies with utter kindness.

3121384,4,B00140PK6O,"""Cranford,""a recently-made, typically lush British Broadcasting Company comic costume drama, is based on the classic works of Mrs. Elizabeth Gaskell, a celebrated British Victorian-era novelist.  The Emmy-nominated production, in five episodes, uses Gaskell's ""Cranford,""with added material from two of her short stories, one about Lady Ludlow, and one about young Dr. Harrison. It is set in 1842-3 in a small rural Cheshire town, based by the author on the real town of Knutsford.  The gorgeous location filming was done in Hertfordshire; with Ashridge Park, Little Godesden, modeling for Lady Ludlow's estate, Hanbury. It boasts a large cast of top-rank British actors, and more stars than there are in Heaven, as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer used to like to boast.

The story, clearly aimed at the demographic of an older female audience, who love Public Broadcasting Systems ""Masterpiece Theatre,"" and the filmed work of Merchant/Ivory -- just like me, of course, as charged --centers on the women of Cranford, most of them no longer young, robbed of any chance at marriage by the Napoleonic wars.  They face unprecedented change, as outsiders start moving into their lovely village, and the railroad approaches. They are also forced to live lives limited by their finances and their social positions in the patriarchal society of the time.  Most prominent among them are the acclaimed stage actress Eileen Atkins(&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cold-Mountain/dp/B0001MDP3G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cold Mountain</a>), as Deborah Jenkyns, local social arbiter, and the Oscar-winning Dame Judi Dench ( ""M"" in the new James Bond movies;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/As-Time-Goes-By-Complete-Original-Series/dp/B0009S2SOY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">As Time Goes By - Complete Original Series</a>) as her younger warmer sister, Miss Matty.

We also get distinguished performances from several more women: Lisa Dillon as Mary Smith; Rosy Byrne as Lizzie Hutton; Kimberley Nixon as Sophy Hutton; Julia Sawalha (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Absolutely-Fabulous-Absolutely-Everything/dp/B000UNYPGM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Absolutely Fabulous - Absolutely Everything</a>); as Jessie Brown, and Emma Fielding, as Miss Galindo, who seems to utter a lot of thoughts, on the subject of women's difficult lives,  that may well have been the author's. As the Tomkinson sisters, Selina Griffiths and Deborah Findlay provide sweet comic relief.

There are also men in Cranford of course, and some very heavy-weight male actors playing them, though their parts are generally lighter than the women's.  Chief among them must be the acclaimed Michael Gambon (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Singing-Detective/dp/B00007HGIJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Singing Detective</a>),as Mr. Holbrook, a former suitor of Miss Matty's.

James: Death in Holy Orders/The Murder Room</a>), shows up briefly as Peter Jenkyns, brother to the Jenkyns women.  Jim Carter is a sturdy Captain Brown.  Simon Woods is handsome, and  light of touch, as young Dr. Harrison, who comes to town bearing new medical techniques, and somehow gets himself into trouble with the local womenfolk. Philip Glenister as Mr. Carter appears in every episode and may have the strongest, most dramatic individual scenes in the production.  And playing right with him, to the hilt, as young Harry Gregson, a poacher's son, is young Alex Etel, who shone so brightly as the little boy in Neil Jordan's film ""Millions.""

The Cheshire locals, of course, will have their own strong country accent, with which Americans will not be comfortable.  And, while looking elsewhere on the Internet, I found a comment about this production: ""If you don't know what they're saying, turn on the subtitles.""  So here comes the subtitle report: if only we could.  It is fiddly work indeed trying to turn on those subtitles, and we failed at it in this house.

3121390,5,B00140PK6O,"This show was just plain perfection. The acting was wonderful (as was the casting) and the seamless story (a compilation of 3 of Gaskell's stories) was just impecably done.

This was such a pleasure to watch. I cannot rave enough about how well done this production was. There is just not a lot more to say about this fabulous show....",1219017600,2,335,4.583333333333333
3121391,5,B00140PK6O,"Let me make something perfectly clear, OK? I'm a guy. Like most guys, my favorite kind of movie has plenty of action, with fights, car chases, explosions, hot babes, and violence, with a little blood or gore sprinkled in. So why did I give this one five stars? Let me try to explain.

Going in, your typical red-blooded American male might be put off a bit; judging by it's cover, Cranford appears to be just another in a long line of boring English bonnet romances, full of people in wigs and weird clothes sitting around in parlours talking to each other. If you're looking for a testosterone-fueled trip through hell, a la Tarantino, Peckinpah or Woo, you might be disappointed. I waited and waited, but I could find not one fist fight, stabbing, shooting, rape, steamy sex scene, unexposed nipple or horrible murder in the whole dang thing!

But gents, don't automatically dismiss this one: if you look, you will find a surprising amount of death, gore and violence: in one scene, a kid smashes in the skull of a defenseless rabbit. In another, a cat pukes up some hand-knit lace. And then a cow falls into a lime pit and gets all it's hide burned off. So I guess you could say that animals have a tough time in this miniseries.

But the people have some rough patches as well. In the first twenty minutes the young carpenter Jem falls from a ladder and suffers a compound fracture of his right forearm, which is pretty gruesome. You wouldn't think that there would be many deaths in this one either, but it seems like people are keeling over every other minute. A very young kid dies of croup, a crippled young woman dies of who knows what, one of the main characters, Deborah Jenkyns (Eileen Atkins), strokes out, and the great Michael Gambon's character, the lovelorn Mr. Holbrook, contracts pneumonia and bites it before he has a chance to marry his long lost love, Mattie Jenkyns ((there is nothin' like a DAME) Judy Dench). The local shopkeeper Mr. Johnson is clubbed on the back of his head and robbed. A family of squatters is forced to live in abject squalor while the father must poach game to keep his family from starvation.

There is a top-notch ""babe"" in the series too. Kimberly Nixon plays the young daughter of the local parson. She is a ""pretty as a picture"" actress, first-rate eye candy, a perfect rosy-cheeked beauty seemingly born for this type of film, who will have a long and very bright future in the many inevitable English period romances to be produced over the next ten years. I hoped and prayed for a scene of her swimming naked in a sylvan lake or even a brief glimpse of her in the boudoir, but alas it never happened. I guess you will have to use your imagination.

Another huge negative: it appeared there were no ""pavement princesses"" or brothels in the town of Cranford. Or they chose not to show us. Damn!

Nor were there coach chases, bloody shootouts, pub brawls, adulterers, adulteresses or dispicable villains in Cranford.

However, you do get a lot of humor, color, poignancy, romance, emotion, beauty, magnificent costumes, fabulous photography, and wonderful character development and acting. With all that, I guess I can overlook the absence of fist fights and sex. I hate to admit that; it's not very manly of me, but it's true. Cranford did not suck.",1219017600,10,3302,4.653516295025729

3121395,5,B00140PK6O,"I just finished watching the BBC's Cranford miniseries and it was wonderful.  The series is set in a small town in 1840s England.  Cranford is a town full of unmarried women (very common at the time with all of the men who had died in the Napoleonic wars and those who had gone to the colonies--India, etc) where social decorum and gossip are equally important.  Change is afoot in Cranford as the railroad comes into the area and small town life threatens to change forever.  The miniseries aptly captures the mood of the age, showing the emotion of the townspeople in a memorable way.

This is a wonderful ensemble piece, even though Judi Dench really does steal just about every scene she's in.  All of the main characters are well developed, and as you learn their back-stories you like them even more.  When the miniseries was over I wanted more--so I will definitely be renting the other BBC Elizabeth Gaskell movies.

I had never seen any series based on Elizabeth Gaskell novels before, so if you are in doubt, I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys Jane Austen, Louisa May Alcott, or even the recent BBC version of Bleak House.  The miniseries is done with all of the usual BBC taste so be ready to enjoy some quality period fun!",1217721600,2,1250,4.594594594594595

3121397,5,B00140PK6O,"I have not read the book, so I do not know how closely it is followed, but I loved this 2 DVD series. The characters draw you into their 19th Century lives.  The absence of eligible men in the town of Cranford is the underlying cause of the story.  The most heart wrenching scenes involve misunderstandings and class distinction-which I suppose is still prevalent in Britain today.  Judi Dench is superb and I enjoyed seeing so many of the actors I have come to love from other BBC series.",1217203200,,489,4.47191011235955
3121398,5,B00140PK6O,I love BBC productions.  This one is no exception.  It is delightfully written and exceptionally well acted.  High quality viewing.,1217030400,,131,5.45
3121399,5,B00140PK6O,"Cranford is an 1840s rural English village where nothing ever really changes and everything obeys an archaic social code of social calling, gossip and mild xenophobia. Thrown into this heady mix of social convention and small-town principles are Mary Smith (Lisa Dillon), the young friend of the Jenkyns sisters (Judi Dench, Eileen Atkins) and Dr. Harrison (Simon Woods), protoge of the more established and more conventional Dr. Morgan (John Bowe).

The cast list reads like a Who's Who and Who's Left of A-List British acting talent: in addition to the players already named above (all of them giving excellent performances),  we have Francesca Annis, Imelda Staunton, Philip Glenister, Deborah Findlay, Julia McKenzie, Michael Gambon, Julia Sawalha - the list goes on and on. I'll just say that the calibre of acting in ""Cranford"" represents some of the best work of all its principle actors, and make special mention of Judi Dench (the woman can do no wrong, it seems: her beautiful, heart-rending portrayal of Matty Jenkyns is engaging and extremely rewarding), Julia Sawalha (her Spinster-on-the-shelf is one of the series' high points) and Imelda Staunton and Julia McKenzie (roles to match that of Dench: we don;t see enough of either actress, though).

Production design and direction are every bit the equal of the eponymous Firth/Ehle ""Pride and Prejudice"" or the Gillian Anderson ""Bleak House"", and Sue Birtwhistle's witty, cleverly adapted script keeps everything moving forward at a gently progressive pace. It's unashamedly feel-good, but don't let the superficial triteness of parts of the plot put you off: ""Cranford"" contains a wealth of top-drawer acting talent and buckets enough of the feel-good factor, along with hefty dashes of black comedy and romantic drama, and makes the cheese factor a necessary and enjoyable facet of this wonderful series.

I can't tell you much more about ""Cranford"" without revealing plot spoilers, so I will not: but please don't take the shortness of this review as a reflection of the series' quality: ""Cranford"", everything about it and everyone in it, is absolutely excellent. If it has a flaw, it's that there's not enough of it to go round. You'll definitely be left wanting more, and in this case, that's a very, very good thing indeed.

Wholly recommended.",1216944000,,2315,5.195710455764075
3121400,5,B00140PK6O,"The BBC has truly outdone itself with the wonderful production of ""Cranford"".  The triumverate of Judi Dench, Eileen Atkins, and Imelda Staunton makes the series a sheer force of cinematic strength.  All three of these leading lights prove incandescent, but their luminous brilliance does not vie for favor--rather, each actress perfectly coplements the other.

Nor is the skill limited to this trio.  The supporting cast is also well-matched, with legends Michael Gambon and Francesca Annis lending their assistance, as well as Simon Woods (whom I recognized from ""Rome""), the lovely Lesley Manville (""The Cazalets"", ""North & South""--the 2nd being another Mrs. Gaskell adaptation), and the darling Claudie Blakely (""Gosford Park"", as well as 2005's ""Pride & Prejudice""), to name but a few.

Purists may squirm that this film is not a verbatim reproduction of Elizabeth Gaskell's novel of the same name, but incorporates much of that book's plotline while adding in those of two other books by her, namely, ""Mr. Harrison's Confessions"" and ""My Lady Ludlow"".  I found the result to be thoroughly enjoyable.

Cranford's society is dominated by a cadre of thoroughly proper ladies, domineered by the righteous Miss Deborah Jenkyns (Atkins).  Her sister, Miss Mathilda (popularly known as Matty) Jenkyns, is softer-hearted; while Deborah is generally unyielding and stern, her sense of compassion and duty does ingratiate her character to the audience eventually.  Miss Pole (Staunton) is easily the grande-dame of the village's gossip circuit and her near-hysterical antics in making certain she is ""THE FIRST"" to pass along juicy tidbits makes for several laugh-out-loud incidents.

While often light-hearted and amusing, ""Cranford"" does address more sobering issues, such as the rigorous class structure's inherent refusal to allow a person to better himself.  This is best played out by Lady Ludlow's (Annis) disgust at learning her head clerk, Mr. Carter, has taught young Harry Gregson (the son of a local squatter/poacher) to read and write.  Literacy, according to Lady Ludlow, is a privilege solely reserved for the upper classes; if the lower orders were to attain it, they would not remember their place.

The imminent arrival of the railway in Cranford is another focal point of the storyline.  The majority of the village's citizenry loathe the idea and are terrified of the great changes it will surely herald for them all.
Romances, demises, losses of fortune, family squabbles, the bleaching of lace collars, and the manner in which to consume an orange with the greatest degree of propriety [quite seriously--and the results are most amusing!]:  ""Cranford"" affords all this and much more, and will assuredly leave the viewer with gleeful smile and a full heart.",1216857600,,2774,5.330275229357798

I first learned of Elizabeth Gaskell while reading Phyllis McGinley's Sixpence in Her Shoe, when I was newly married. Years later while visiting a London bookstore, I found several of the Gaskell novels and added them to my library. I couldn't resist rereading Cranford the week after seeing the final episode.

I liked the blending of three of Gaskell's novels into this telling of the story. My Lady Ludlow and Mr. Harrison's Confessions give the village a larger context and paint a more complete picture of England at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. However, nothing of the charm of the perfect English village is lost in this delightful retelling of the story.

Needless to say, Judi Dench  is nothing short of perfection in her role as Miss Matty, but the rest of the cast are brilliant  as well.

3121437,5,B00140PK6O,"For those who have not tried watching British miniseries, books turned to movies or BBC television; this is the place to start. Cranford is not to long (not long enough, also) being just 5 hour-long episodes. It is a comedy/drama that will delight any new fan. It is an ice cream sundae for those already loving the British Victorian stories. Beautiful costumes and sets. Plus an insane Victorian milk cow (I'll not ""spoil"" this portion with an explanation).

Cranford has it all. The cast is headed by Judi Dench, being a guarantee of enjoyment for any movie.  She is the star in every episode with her superb acting of the character Miss Matty.  Like the other ladies of this small British Village, she specializes in knowing the right thing to do and say in every social engagement. It is a laugh-out-loud experience to watch the town's old spinsters interact--especially when the new young doctor arrives in town.  It seems young and old alike decide he is their chance for love and living.  What a hilarious set of events caused by a prank by the young doctor's friend. If it's not marrying hopefuls wagging their tongues then it's the anti-railroad ladies trying to preserve the perfectness of the small community. You will side with those against the new railroad intrusion.

The ladies will have you laughing one moment and then genuinely moved by their situation the next. What an amazing story, the book written by Elizabeth Gaskill.  The British accents are delightful but for those unaccustomed to the dialects, the DVD offers subtitles in English, often a help, yet not distracting when not needed as they are place outside the widescreen box.

The young boy Harry Gregson is played by Alex Etel and is a young, poor chap you will fall in love with. You will want to contribute yourself to his livelihood, this thirst for education, and his dedication to assist his family in survival. The list of fine acting is endless, as the entire cast seems destined for an award for their work.

Yes, Cranford is the DVD to buy to get a taste of British drama/comedy. Be prepared: it is addictive and this particular DVD set is right up at the top. The story is so small-village comfortable and ends so feel-good delightfully that we should all be so lucky as to live in Cranford.

3121439,5,B00140PK6O,"Help, I'm stuck in a small, Victorian town being pleasantly spied on by a bunch of sweet, proper, opinionated, gossipy, nosey, and at times, crazy Cranford women!  I'm due for a timely visit from two elderly sisters who know everything about everyone.

This is not Jane Austen, although there are similarities.  There are groups of women, lots of relationships, humor and romance; however,  death, disease and disaster also rear up and are more prevalent, and exposed here.

The author, Elizabeth Gaskell (1810-1865) lived after Austen, and wrote the great novels to PBS movies of 'North and South', Wives and Daughters' and was friends with Charlotte 'don't call me Jane Ayre' Bronte.  Gaskell penned Bronte's Biography after her demise, and it was in Charles Dicken's mag, 'Household Words' that Cranford appeared in 1853.

Bringing this enchanting place to a 5-hour period piece is an immense undertaking, and BBC does a great job at it.  After the recent downpour of Jane Austen/Jane Ayre re-do's, one wonders if there are any towns left to film in England not seen, any English actors not used, any costumes, music, directors, etc., etc., not indulged.  Well, it's a different time period than Austen's, and one can't ever get enough English countryside or actors, such as Judi Dench and Eileen Atkins, who portray the sisters and are simply marvelous.  Their characters compliment and confront each other perfectly.  Atkins plays the crusty one but with a good heart.  Dench is sweet and knowing, and through their eyes, Cranford unfolds.  On the higher, social spectrum, Lady Ludlow(Francesca Annis) reigns solo, gripping tightly onto her fading world and aplomb.

It's not just a world of older matriarchs, but of young love and misunderstandings, professional clashes between generations, and the ever dominating class struggles.  The movie hops and interacts between all the storylines in potpourri fashion, sometimes outrageously funny, other times sad but not morose.  Amazing that the editing flows so well.

Although it's not as light and frisky as the BBC/A&E 'Pride and Prejudice' (a tough comparison!), it merits it own applause as a very fine, very 'proper' comedy/drama.  And apparently a sequel is planned.  I guess I'll never get out of this town.  Enjoy.",1212019200,6,2276,5.183561643835616

Depending upon which edition of Cranford you purchase, these stories may or may not be included. So much for comparing below the plot of the film to the books.

This adaptation is one of the best ever done and ever shown on the BBC or on PBS here in the States.  The acting is beyond first-rate; these actors are so believable, their acting so subtle and yet strong, that one forgets completely that each of the older ladies is an actor of quite a bit of renown.  The Victorian essentials of thwarted romance, disappointed hopes, bonnets and shawls, legacies and runaway brothers, country towns and grand estates, are enriched with priceless moments of poignancy and laugh-out-loud humor.  If I were to say which actresses run away with the show, they are Judi Dench (quite different here from the feisty woman she often plays) and Imelda Staunton, who apparently can take absolutely any role and make it her own.  Lavish  scenes shot on location, plenty of outdoors to breathe in, wonderful costumes and details.

stupidity, violence and sexuality. Most times it is hardly worth turning
on. Thank God for BBC. Cranford is a little masterpiece of charm, wit
and warmth. The soap opera of the 1800's. Two secrets to British movies
and television---characters always look like real people. They are engaging to watch because they look so interesting and different. The
U.S. market continually hires the same look of a thirty year old, beautiful mannequin or an elderly woman who has had plastic surgery to
look like a thirty year old. Everyone is so homogenized in the L.A. look
that it is akin to watching science fiction. Add gratuitous sex and a
poorly written plot and you have our ""made for TV"" movies and most sitcoms. Brit actors are a rich tapestry of the human face and it pays off. Secondly, Cranford is filmed and costumed in a sort of ""sepia"" tone
which fits the time and place. The gray, green, brown of most--the interior dingy atmosphere is true to homes of the period. Contrast is
scarce (the wealthy, the color of imported silks, a May Day celebration) but
very effective. I will watch this series over and over and visit my new
friends in Cranford. I have read in British newspapers online that the
actors have all signed on to do a Christmas (in Cranford) special to

3355689,5,B00140PK6O,"2008's ""Cranford"" is an outstanding Masterpiece Theater presentation, featuring a superb cast of actors set in a small village in the Midlands of 1840 England.  At the center of the story is a group of single females led by the aging spinster sisters Miss Deborah and Miss Mattie, their younger niece Mary Smith, and Miss Pole, who collectively contribute both wisdom and humor to the story.

Cranford manages to contain considerable human interest despite its small size, or perhaps because of it.  Rumors run wild, normally well ahead of the well-intentions efforts of villagers to get things done.  Several themes thread through the series.  One theme is the influence over village affairs exercised by the spinsters.  A second is the assimilation of the young Doctor Harrison, who causes quite a stir by his unorthodox medical methods and by his good looks.  A third is the pending disruption to the insular ways of Cranford by the advent of a railroad across the lands of the wealthy Lady Ludlow.

A number of charming subplots enliven each episode, which pull no punches when it comes to matters of love and death.  Small romances thrive or fail.  A estate steward teaches a gypsy boy how to read.  The village enjoys an annual party on the estate of Lady Ludlow.  A bank failure threatens a woman with sudden destitution.  A couple in love are kept apart by her family obligations.  Valentine's Day becomes a source of confusion as mysterious cards arrive at varous homes in the village.  Even prominent characters are not immune from disappointment, although there is hope from episode to episode that fate will be kind to most.  Period costumes, customs and furnishings are spot-on.  The direction keeps the story moving from family to family as the various themes are advanced.  The final episode is absolutely thrilling, as a variety of plot threads are finally tied up and surprising heroes save the day.

""Cranford"" is very highly recommended as excellent entertainment to fans of Elizabeth Gaskell's novels and of Masterpiece Theater.",1210550400,16,2048,5.005917159763314
3355690,5,B00140PK6O,"Cranford aka the Cranford Chronicles, based on Elizabeth Gaskell's story is a stellar production. It is a lush period drama and is very authentic in its portrayal of people living in a little hamlet called Cranford. The sets are beautiful as are the costumes, and of course the production is elevated to a level of excellence by its impeccable casting.

Writer Heidi Thomas does a wonderful job of adapting Elizabeth Gaskell's story [purportedly based on Gaskell's own hometown] and though liberties are taken, the stellar cast more than makes up for whatever deficiencies there may be in the faithfulness of the adaptation. Dame Eileen Atkins [Miss Deborah Jenkins] and Dame Judi Dench [Miss Matty Jenkins] portray two spinster sisters in 1842 who live in the little town of Cranford. Far from being a quiet little hamlet, this little town hums with activity and village gossips, especially a Miss Pole [Imelda Staunton]who flits around from one hearsay to another, avidly passing on any little nuggets of gossip to the other inhabitants.

Cranford is set aflutter by the arrival of a new doctor, Dr Harrison [Simon Woods] who is young, handsome, single and very much into trying new methods of treatment, to the initial consternation of the townspeople. Dr Harrison finds himself attracted to a beautiful local lass, Sophy [Kimberly Nixon] though he inadvertently attracts the romantic affections of other single women in Cranford.

But the story does not merely focus on romance, as there are other more serious themes underlying the series. For one, there is talk of a railroad being built that would go through Cranford, and disrupt the idyllic life in the village, giving rise to the inevitable battle between modernization and the desire for things to remain unchanged. The local rich lady, Lady Ludlow portrayed by Francesca Annis is very much opposed to change, and not only opposes the railroad but also any form of societal change, such as literacy amongst the lower classes [she refuses to hire a maid who is literate, saying the girl's parents did her a disservice by teaching her to read].

There is also the theme of lost love, death and grief. Miss Matty Jenkins[ Judi Dench] finds herself recounting the tale of her lost love [played by Michael Gambon]. This is what makes Cranford such an engaging viewing experience - the absurd [the story of the cat swallowing an anitque lace and how the lace is retrieved] is interlaced with tales of poignancy and everything unfolds leisurely. It is a tale that we wish will never end, and hope to revisit again and again.",1210032000,24,2578,4.960648148148148

By turns comic,  poignant, tragic, and romantic, this series has everything that not only makes one feel awfully good but also keeps one wanting more.

I thought Cranford would be a subdued drawn out dramatization but I was pleasantly surprised to find it so engaging at every moment. The adaptation had managed to make every character useful and meaningful in a drama where everyone's a hero at the end of the day. And the actors - please don't make me choose between them. They were all plucked out of Cranford itself, I'm sure.

One theme stood out for me. The danger of conjecturing, the gossip it perpetuates and the lives they can destory. Even so, it was impossible to truly fault the culprits as Gaskell shows that a person should be judged as a whole and not by a single deed alone.

I won't dwell into the details as it is too colorful and summarizing would do it injustice but suffice it to say Cranford was very well written with much thought placed into the evolution of characters and the seamless integration of plots. It has everything a little old town can manage.

While lacking the narrative focus of ""Wives and Daughters"" and ""North and South,"" ""Cranford"" still comes out to top crest owing largely to a collection of likeable characters played by veteran and other well-known British actors, and also owing to a masterful interweaving of several storylines taken from Mrs. Gaskell's novel ""Cranford,"" and her other smaller works (novellas,) such as ""My Lady Ludlow"" and ""Mr. Harrison's Confessions."" What could have been a trite exercise comes out fresh because of these qualities.

At the onset, the bucolic and fictional town of Cranford seems quiet and trapped in a former century. But nothing is ever quiet especially where gossiping ladies are concerned; and no ""backward"" town can forever stay asleep, not when a proposed railway which will connect it with other busier counties (such as Manchester) is about to disturb the peace and change town life forever. This is the foundation with which the storylines of ""Cranford"" are set, told in an era where change has been steadily making headways, and the social strata seem to be balancing out.

It should be noted, however, that while ""Cranford"" imparts to its viewers a sense of things on the verge of change, romance and social satire are still the order of the day. Making up the romantic aspect of ""Cranford"" are pairs of lovers who are kept apart either by mischief of fate, familial obligations, or class difference. Complementing these are subplots about a sister's longing for a long-lost brother, a mother's longing for an absent son, and silly feminine passions that explode to embarrassing proportions on two occasions. ""Cranford"" is also replete with satire, as evidenced by its comedy of manners. It spends an amount of its time poking fun at cackling and gossiping ladies. Ultimately, these gossips harm not only their victims, but also the perpetrators themselves, in more ways than one. Other themes of the period are the upper-class bigotry against the education of the lower-class, and also the clinging on to traditions that do no good in the end (as evidenced by Lady Ludlow's decision with regards to a part of her land.) Comparison is also made between the professional attitudes (and aptitudes) of the elder Dr. Morgan and the younger Dr. Harrison.

The descriptions I gave above may mislead you readers to think of ""Cranford"" as dismal and small. On the contrary, ""Cranford"" has a big heart, in the way its inhabitants show charity, neighborliness and compassion when called for. ""Nothing like this is ever done in London,"" comments our young Dr. Harrison on the ladies' generosity. Even the prejudiced Lady Ludlow (played by Francesca Annis) takes a good turn when she spoke to the magistrate on behalf of a poacher who was also wrongly accused of assaulting someone in the night. Amidst all these, Dame Judi Dench plays the younger Jenkyn sister and she somewhat embodies Cranford, which is now on the brink of breaking out to the wave of social changes happening in other places. She had lived under the shadow of her loving but stern sister for most of her life, and we always sense in her some wild undercurrent ready to break out of the mold.

Dames Eileen and Judi, playing the two Jenkyn sisters who never married, are truly a joy to watch. It's so nice to see them in bonnets and in more congenial surroundings. See veteran performances in action (I wished that Dame Maggie Smith were also here, I so much adore her as I do Dames Eileen and Judi.) These two formidable actresses aside, who can beat this roster of veteran actors and other well-knowns who took part in the production: Sir Michael Gambon, Francesca Annis, Imelda Staunton, Lesley Manville, Julia McKenzie, Barbara Flynn, Deborah Findlay, Julia Sawalha, and others. The cast is top rate and so are the production values, which have always been the hallmark of the BBC television series enterprise. Fans of BBC's ""Wives and Daughters"" will not be disappointed with this one.

A point of interest: Hardcore literature buffs may not take kindly to the creative liberties that the filmmakers took with Mrs. Gaskell's works. In the Bonus Features Interview, they admit to changing the fates of certain characters: some died who were supposed to live, and some lived who were supposed to die. And yes, as with ""Wives and Daughters"" and ""North and South,"" ""Cranford"" has its own lot of untimely and diseased deaths, in an era where modern medicine was just making early breakthroughs. One particular death scene near the end (where a leg needed to be amputated) might disturb younger viewers.

Speaking during the interview, producer Sue Birtwistle mentioned the possibility of a sequel should ""Cranford"" do very well. I'd be bold enough to speak in behalf of fans: We certainly hope that a follow-up comes soon. At five episodes, ""Cranford"" feels like a joyous ride that ended too soon. Fans certainly like to be ""BBC-spoiled"" now and then. If this were to come true, I hope to see more British veteran actors (particularly Dame Maggie) taking part in Mrs. Gaskell's insightful stories.

3355694,5,B00140PK6O,"I ordered this from Amazon UK to be able to view this prior to its release date.  I was not disappointed! Sadly, I had to watch it by myself because my husband didn't think he'd like it.  He would have been wrong, by the way. It was exquisite in every way.

I watched it over 2 nights. It's a 5 hour miniseries and it is broken up into five 1 hour-long episodes.

The first 3 hours were very very good. Excellent, even.  But the last 2 hours were absolutely perfect.

In Cranford, we meet many of its residents with most of the focus on 2 spinster sisters and their surrounding friends and relatives.  Everyone is kind here and look out for their neighbors and generally want to live correctly and do the right thing.  Their village has been like this for ages and the citizens have all known eachother since birth. It is an idyllic place and a happy place.  They welcome new residents, too, with every bit of friendliness.

Cranford has existed in the same way for years, even though times are changing. A railroad may come through the town and most residents are against this type of change. For with the positive changes-- such as information, goods, and knowledge, there would also be negative changes-- more transients, less safety, etc.

The intertwined story lines here involve the two sisters, class distinctions, entitlements and expectations, a very funny love triangle, and accepting change and modernity.

One of the best stories involves the young son of a poacher (one who kills animals on others' land).  The manager of the aristocrat's large estate takes the young boy under his wing and wants to teach him to read and write.  The aristocratic Lady finds out and believes that those of this underclass should not attempt to learn skills outside their ""class"".  Maybe worse, the boy's father finds out of the boy's desire to read and also disapproves.  We find out later that the Lady isn't cold-hearted. On the contrary.  She's kind-hearted and full of pain, yet it's difficult for her to recognize the times are changing and that some of her ways must change, too.

When a new handsome doctor moves to town, he immediately falls for Sophy.  Sophy returns his admiration, yet so do 2 others who misunderstand his general kindness for more romantic intentions.  This culminates in expected confusion, but the outcome is happy at the end.

Those watching Cranford from the beginning may take it to be an old-fashioned chick-flick.  It's really not, though.  It does focus on the women of Cranford more than the men, but the stories depicted cross gender lines.  Change-- industrialization-- is the antagonist here, along with fear of change.  However, as new medical practices save several lives, and a member of the trade class saves a member of the Upper class, it's also obvious that change, by itself, isn't bad.  It can be positive for everyone involved.

This is a fantastic series.  The only disappointment was that it was only five hours! I definitely could have watched another few episodes with the same interest these five held.  Beautifully acted, filmed, and scored.  The entire film was thoroughly enjoyable.",1205452800,263,3136,4.818352059925093

While this film has not been shown on American TV as yet I was lucky enough to stumble across the entire film on youtube where it was  shown in 9 minute segments. Its a quiet film with rich and wonderful characters long remembered. I was afraid that Judi Dench would overpower her role but nothing like it. She was perfect in her poignantly sad but joyfully rising role. It's about the town Cranford, that is fearful of changes being brought by the arrival of the railway. No one of course wants the charm of Old English ways to change and one gets very attached to the warm and sad and silly and funny characters in  Cranford. Cranford really is a place one wishes to live and to never leave nor have change.

3355736,4,B00140PK6O,"""All around us England shifts and changes but Cranford stands fast. Its women are like Amazons, and to those who live here it is the world entire.""

But change is inevitable. And in ""Cranford,"" the changes to their little village have massive repercussions -- social, technological, personal and sometimes involving a cow wearing pajamas. As the miniseries is based on novellas by Elizabeth Gaskell, it balances out the romance and personal hijinks of Cranford's ladies with some wickedly pointed social satire.

Most of the well-off people in Cranford are middle-aged ladies (mostly widows and spinsters), who spread any interesting gossip faster than twitter. Over the course of the story there are some tragic deaths, some romances, a scandal or two, a rash of thefts and the looming approach of the railway. Yep, the railroad is approaching Cranford, though the people there are doing their best to ignore and/or avoid it.

Mary Smith (Lisa Dillon) comes to live with the Jenkyns sisters, Deborah (Eileen Atkins) and Matty (Judi Dench). Unfortunately, problems soon begin cropping up -- Matty is hit by two tragic personal losses and a financial disaster, forcing her to change the way she lives her life. At the same time, young Dr. Harrison brings new medical advances to Cranford... but he ends up the target of several ladies' affections, which threatens him with scandal.

Meanwhile, haughty, wealthy Lady Ludlow (Francesca Annis) is risking bankruptcy to finance her ne'er-do-well son Septimus. Her land agent Mr. Carter (Philip Glenister) becomes determined to educate a bright but illiterate poacher's son, Harry (Alex Etel). But Lady Ludlow begins fighting him over this, since she loathes the idea of lower-class people being even somewhat educated.

... and various other stories involving dead dogs, cows in pajamas, a cat that swallows some antique lace, a risky operation to save a carpenter's arm, bank failure, some poaching, and Matty's long-lost brother.

""Cranford"" gives the feeling of a country on the brink of great changes -- changes in social strata, women's rights, technology and society -- and these are mirrored in the smaller changes in the village itself. But the heart of Cranford is the people who live there -- and the romances, the tragedies, the friendships and kindness they show each other.

And that is what makes it such an enjoyable experience. It can elicit tears (Mrs. Forrester confessing why she cares so much for Matty) as easily as laughter (the cow pajamas), and the mingling of romance, comedy and tragedy ends up feeling very... well, real. The dialogue is witty and clever (""My father was a man. I think I understand the sex!"") and it moves from one subplot to another with nimble grace.

And since this is based on a book by Elizabeth Gaskell, there's a hefty dose of social satire mixed in -- partly for the gossipy Cranford ladies and the inadvertent harm they do, and partly for the class snobbery of Lady Ludlow. If there's a problem, it's that you can get mood whiplash from how quickly they go from light to dark, dark to light -- within an episode, we go from wacky misadventures to two characters dying. That's pretty tough.

The cast is also top-notch here, especially Judi Dench as the angelically sweet, somewhat timid Miss Matty (""I never liked the notion that the world is round. Makes me feel so giddy""). She's backed by the excellent Julia McKenzie, Imelda Staunton, Dillon, Jim Carter, Etel, Annis, Woods and Julia Sawalha, among others -- we have outspoken spinsters, naive young men, clever young boys, haughty nobility and women who may have lost their only chance at love.

And all the characters are beautifully fleshed out, often without being too obvious or explicit. Even when they're in the wrong -- Lady Ludlow's class snobbery, or Deborah's dislike of Mr. Holbrook -- they are not necessarily bad people, just incorrect.

""Cranford"" is a tragic, comic, dramatic and fascinating little series, studying the inevitable changes that are marching toward Cranford -- but which can never change the fast friendships among its citizens.",1403568000,,4111,5.048672566371682

In my favorite English dramas, there is either a great, passionate romance to be consumated, or a deep, dark secret to be revealed, or a complex mystery to be solved.  Cranford didn't have any of these.  What Cranford did offer was an interesting slice of life from the 1840s.  However, for my tastes, it included too many unconnected small stories, entertaining as they may have been (some were quite entertaining).  And I was hoping for one great story.

3355762,5,B00140PK6O,"If you are a fan of British historical dramas, then you could enjoy ""Cranford.""  It may be a bit slower for some who might expect it to be something like ""Downton Abbey,"" but for those who enter into the backwater self-enclosed (or so it may seem at first) world of Cranford, you might well be charmed by it.

Set in a small town in the 1840's England, the story of Cranford is based on the interactions of a finely-knit ensemble of characters--including the marvelous Judi Dench and other actors you will easily recognize if you have watched much British television or even the Harry Potter movies--as they either fight to hold on to the past or to bring in the future.  The stories range from poor squatters who must poach to bring food to the table to the lonely Lady of the Manor who seems cold at first, until you realize she is a woman in pain.  The town gossip with a feather in her cap is absolutely hilarious and you will never forget the incident with the cat and the buttermilk.

Many of the main characters are women, including spinsters and widows, and they gossip about any and everything and are shocked (oh my!) by the idea of new muslins from Paris or who might have given new gloves to someone else and consult their book about what a bunch of flowers might mean when received.  Let alone all of the trouble that a single Valentine's Day card can cause.

This is the story of a gentle age, when men and women still bowed to each other and people of a certain class all strived to adhere to an understood moral compass.  Yet, the story also addresses the trials of being poor and hungry at that time, of lost loves and opportunities, the misfortunes and grief of death, and how that same compass might be wrong when it comes to who deserved an education or to open a business of their very own.

The storyline was based off of several novellas, with some additions, but it retains the witty commentary of the times by the author.  If you open your heart to Cranford, it won't disappoint.",1370908800,,2004,4.435967302452316

3355783,5,B00140PK6O,"This production of CRANFORD caps off the BBC's initiative to dramatise the works of Mrs Elizabeth Gaskell, which began in 1999 with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wives-and-Daughters/dp/B000GIXLUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wives and Daughters</a>&nbsp;and continued with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/North-South/dp/B000AYEL6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">North & South</a>.  Arguably the most popular and beloved of all Mrs Elizabeth Gaskell's works, CRANFORD was partially based on Gaskell's memories of a real Cheshire village in which she had lived for a time, called Knutsford.  This quiet, uncomplicated novel is really a series of vignettes - some comical, some romantic and others deeply moving - when woven together create the rich tapestry of life in a tight-knit village which is teetering on the edge of change.  For this 5-part miniseries of CRANFORD, screenwriter Heidi  Thomas has combined the original ""Cranford"" with two additional Gaskell manuscripts - ""My Lady Ludlow"" and ""Mr Harrison's Confessions"".

We arrive in Cranford with Mary Smith (Lisa Dillon), who has graciously been accepted to stay with the Jenkyns sisters.  With a tiresome, matchmaking stepmother (Finty Williams) and an ever-increasing brood of stepsiblings back in Manchester, Mary is hoping for rest and respite... what she gets however is anything but!

To her amusement, Mary discovers Cranford to be a community governed by it's unusually high percentage of older female residents.  One particular small circle holds more influence than the others - Cranford's ""Amazons"" are the formidable Miss Pole (Imelda Staunton), Mrs Forrester (Julia McKenzie), Mrs Jamieson (Barbara Flynn), Miss Tomkinson (Deborah Findlay), Miss Deborah Jenkyns (Dame Eileen Atkins) and her sister, Miss Matty (Dame Judi Dench).  Together, these ladies are Cranford's very lifeblood, the bastion of decency and a support system of mutual friendship.

Mary's arrival in Cranford coincides with the posting of a new, young doctor, Frank Harrison (Simon Woods), who quickly becomes caught up in a scheme of matchmaking with several residents.  Also newly-arrived in town is the impoverished Captain Brown (Jim Gordon) and his daughter Jessie (Julia Sawalha).  At the nearby estate of Hanbury Court, the ageing Lady Ludlow (Francesca Annis) keeps things running smoothly for the county, clinging to the safety of past traditions, but finds herself in a losing battle with the looming prospect of a railway line cutting into her land, bringing with it that dreaded thing called ""progress"".  Progress is already much closer than she thinks, in the small body of Harry Gregson (Alex Etel), a gypsy boy whose hunger for knowledge is recognised by Lady Ludlow's overseer Edmund Carter (Philip Glenister), and Miss Galindo (Emma Fielding), Lady Ludlow's milliner.

CRANFORD is an ensemble piece, but the bulk of the action emanates from the house of the Jenkyns sisters.  Most of what happens unfolds through the eyes of Mary Smith (the book's narrator) and if there's a ""lead"" character it's most definitely Miss Matty, who is one of the most delightful figures in all literature.  Screenwriter Heidi Thomas (""Madame Bovary"", ""Lillies"", ""Upstairs Downstairs"") is one of my favourites and somehow always manages to distill all the best dialogue from the original source but make it fresh again for the screen.

The performances are sublime.  The BBC always furnishes their costume dramas with first-rate talents, but the cast in CRANFORD is simply extraordinary.  With Dames Atkins and Dench leading the way as the Jenkyns sisters, all is well with the world.  In particular I adore Judi Dench's Miss Matty; she brings out a lovely child-like quality to the character.  There's also a few ""Gaskell veterans"" reunited here in CRANFORD (Francesca Annis, Michael Gambon, Barbara Flynn and Deborah Findlay all appeared in the BBC's earlier adaptation of Gaskell's ""Wives and Daughters"").

I cannot recommend this highly enough.",1333584000,2,4067,5.765886287625418

3355794,5,B00140PK6O,"Judi Dench does a fantastic job of headlining the BBC miniseries Cranford.  Cranford is a small, rural, English town, and the miniseries follows the lives and times of people who live there.  The main storyline centers on a group of elderly unmarried women, including Dench.  There is also the Lady who lives in the manor house and who is the local member of the house of Lords.

Life in rural 1800s England is a happy and tragic thing.  Though the town has a doctor, there was little that doctors could do at the time to deal with disease or serious injury, and death was a common part of life.  At the same time, people found joy in each other's company and the small and simple things of life.

This series has a sort of Dickinsonian/Austenesque quality to it.

The sets are fantastic, the costuming is amazing, and the storylines and acting are top-notch.  I found myself gaining an increased understanding of and appreciation for England and the English experience through watching this miniseries.

Of course, this series is not for everyone.  If you are guy looking for an action-adventure flick, keep on walking, you won't find what you are looking for here.  If, however, you are a viewer who enjoys history, period films, drama, and BBC-style work, then welcome home!

3355799,5,B00140PK6O,"What a surprise this film was.  I found it at the library and decided to give it a try.  Normally I watch American classics from the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s.  My wife and I watched Cranford together and just could not get enough.  The script is perfection, the set decoration is superb, the acting top notch and the music score is well done.  Like some of the others commented; the only disappointment was that it was only five hours long! I definitely could have watched more episodes had they stretched this out. Beautifully acted, filmed, and scored. The entire production was thoroughly enjoyable and wholesome, albeit a little gruesome at some points for young children.  The only thing I didn't like is the name of the village; 'Cranford'.  The village name makes it sound like a clunky American soap opera - which it is not.  The writing is just superb, the cast and acting even better.  It is hard to say who my favorite character was, but easy to pick the best actor.... the little boy (son of the poacher)who was taught at the manor was exceptionally brilliant - as are all the others.  Not a lemon in the bunch!  I was disappointed each time credits began to roll signafying the end of an episode.  I just did not want this to end.  By the way, use the captions if you have a hard time understanding any of the heavier British accents as I occasionally did.  Clears things right up.  I can't wait for some time to pass so that I can watch this series again in freshness someday, (I often watch good movies as many as 20 or more times; e.g. Key Largo, etc.).",1290297600,2,1567,4.4491228070175435

I found this series while browsing and decided to try it.  While Upstairs Downstairs lives are conducted against a background of early 20th century transitions, including class discord, woman's rights, World War I and technological changes like the radio, telephone, automobile, and weapons of mass destruction, those of the Cranford characters are lived against one of equal change and social disruption.

Here again massive differences in the well being of the different social classes, the acceptable behavior of women, the introduction of new techniques in medicine, the introduction of mass transport in the form of the railroads, all challenge the status quo, making the everyday events of the lives of these characters--at least from our own perspective--a drama of considerable proportion.  The fact that every generation, including our own, is faced with such changes allows us to understand the sense of threat felt by the elders in the series and the sense of expectation and hope felt by the younger people.

That the fear of the older generation is not necessarily justified as much as they think it is is also apparent, as again it is in Upstairs Downstairs, with each episode.  Just as is the unwarranted expectation by the younger members of society that change will necessarily improve everything.  The episodes show us, in fact, that the more things change, the more they stay the same.  Mostly it's just the technology that changes.  This is an important bit of knowledge for us and should moderate our own expectations, as we rush into an even more technology driven age in the 21st century and to globalization.

For those to whom this type of fiction is unfamiliar, the period is roughly that of the American Civil War in the United States and midway through the long Reign of Queen Victoria in England.

Society, just as in earlier times, rigidly enforces its expectations and no one is left untouched by it.  The elder generation especially, having paid its dues, perpetuates and enforces the code with ferocity. Lady Ludlow angrily refuses a lower class girl looking to enter her service for being educated ""above her station"" and insists that these orders of society need no education because it gives them ""dangerous ideas"" and results in the violence of the French revolution.  Just as assuredly that change is in the air is reflected by the activities and attitudes of her land agent Edmund Carter who encourages the boy Harry Greigson, who has become the defacto head of his houseold by virtue of an inconstant father.

The cinematography of the work is lovely, as it usually is in a BBC series.  The village and the housing in it are very realistically presented and thematically evocative.  The character of each home clearly reflects the social status and financial wherewithal of the people living in them. There is no doubt, for instance, that the widowed doctor's wife has enjoyed some degree of comfort and social standing in the past, but that she has fallen on hard times since her husband died.  The walls are dark with peeling paint, the woodwork is also in need of repair, and little of the gracious life is left except a few pieces of good furniture looking marooned in the large rooms.  The presence of affluence but the absence of a woman's influence, reflected in the fine house and furnishings with noticeable dust of farmer Thomas Holbrook, tells of an elderly bachelor whose disappointment in love left him with nothing but money to keep him company.  The respectable, well kept household of the Jenkyns sisters reflects their status as spinsters left with the last of a family's fortune and their own respectable characters with which to live out their lives.  While the meager lodgings of Captain Brown and his family reveals their status of dependency on the good will of Major Gordon.

The costumes are quite intriguing.  Unlike the more loosely fitting and occasionally provocative empire-waist dresses of the earlier part of the century enjoyed by the Jane Austin characters--and Empress Josephine--the gowns of the period are more confining, figure disguising, and ""proper.""  Their yards and yards of material mean that few but the more affluent can afford them--thus making a less financially well endowed individual more conspicuous and avoidable in the marriage market.  More importantly they reflect a society less sure of itself and more inclined to harken back to the grandure of the 18th century than to the youthful enthusiasm of the earlier part of the 19th.

Though the series is definitely a drama, it has frequent comedic events that are quite funny.  The social climbing Mrs. Jameison in her little sedan chair being run about by over worked footmen in pursuit of the most recent gossip is quite amusing as is the outrageous tale of ""the fate of the vintage lace.""  Although she drops out early in the series, my favorite character is Deborah Jenkyns, played with great skill by Eileen Atkins.  She is a wonderful blend of rigidly upright elder with a heart of gold and a will of iron.  Her sister Matilda, played by Judi Dench, has less to say for herself until almost half way through the first series, when it becomes apparent that she, like the younger character of Miss Brown, had given up her chance of happiness in marriage out of a sense of duty to her family.  The dnouement of the final act of her lovestory, while very predictable, was none the less poignant in its impact and very meaningful in the context of Miss Brown's more recent and ill-considered sacrifice.  The viewer is left in no doubt as to the likely fate of Miss Brown.

A lovely series.",1283644800,2,7081,5.662570888468809

3355802,5,B00140PK6O,"Feeling sorry for myself after multiple lung problems requiring me to take load of meds and time off from work (but NOT in the fun way), my darling Brit husband and I watched this wonderful BBC series featuring one of my favorite actresses, Judi Dench.  Anything Dame Judi touches is pure gold in my Anglophile eyes and this was no exception.

A period British costume 5 part BBC series told in one hour increments, each one topped the other.  Beautifully acted, staged and set, kudos must go to Eileen Atkins, Judi Dench, Lisa Dillon and Imeda Staunton along with Simon Woods, John Bowe and Francecsa Annis that make this quaint 19th century British village come to life.

Manners matter.  Visitors may call upon you after 3 o'clock but not a moment before.  The introduction of a new, young village doctor gets the ladies bosom's heaving, imaginations going into overdrive with misunderstandings making it only more delightful.

It is not acted in broad strokes but in small intricate ones that compose the moral compass of the entire village afraid of change whether involving a new neighbor or the imposing railroad linking them to Manchester.

I know its the middle of the summer, but I am putting this on my Christmas list.  My husband is going out to pick up its sequel.  He enjoyed it as much as I did.

My husband and this DVD are both British keepers.

3355803,4,B00140PK6O,"I am a fan of Elizabeth Gaskell whose books are of wider variety than an author like Jane Austen.  While North and South is my favorite of her books and her adaptations, this one is so different it is hard to compare with anything else and you have to love it as one of a kind.  It is a story about a little world all its own and I really enjoyed this adaptation of 3 stories into one because it was done very well.",1275955200,2,415,3.9285714285714284
3355804,5,B00140PK6O,"This is a masterpiece of historical dramatization.  While faithful to the novel, it translates the action and emotion into a format for modern viewers.  My family has watched this several times with increasing delight at the subtle personalities, the social issues that are evoked, and the lives as they go forward.  The great accomplishment of the series is that, while often funny to the point of absurdity, it never falls into the territory of sitcom or burlesque.  Instead, it retains both its realism and social relevancy in the most exquisite of dramas.  The milieu, while superficially familiar, is in fact quite alien.  Isolated, it is in the thick of victorian era, which can only be described as extremely rarified, full of rules, customs, and traditions that shape decisions that are astonishingly personal, cause mortal worries about the most banal concerns, and lead to intricate misunderstandings.  It is always believable and emotionally accurate, never parody.

The cast of characters appears normal, at least for their time. There is Matty, whose elder sister Deborah is the arbiter of ""the proper"" in town.  They look out the windows, judging people they see in the street and discussing what course of action would be best.  They take in a niece, who becomes an intimate part of their household because she wishes  to aviod a hasty (or perhaps any) marriage.  A young doctor also comes to town, brimming with ideals and ready to work.  Finally, the gameskeeper for a local aristocrat takes on the welfare of a wonderful child, whose family is part gypsy and dirt poor.  As these characters interact and adapt to the changing world, more and more is revealed, to the point that their cares and hopes become beautifully, painfully poignant.

For example, as the young doctor establishes himself as innovative and competent, he is noticed as the most eligible bachelor in a town of gossipy spinsters.  Though he is in love with a local beauty, two older women become convinced he is about to propose to them, in part because of his own kindness but also by a bad practical joke.  When the situation is discovered, he is nearly ruined by the many assumptions people make about his motives.  Another episode involves the sad resolution of an old love:  the beau reappears, after perhaps 40 years, to the woman who refused him because her family needed her due to a personal tragedy.  They loved each other the whole time.  It brought tears to my eyes.

The overwhelming impression, at the end, is one of grace.  You come to admire these people, hope for them, and even question your own behavior.  Indeed, according to my wife, a principal purpose of the novels is to pose social dilemmas to the reader.  Very powerful stuff.  Also, unlike the all's-well-that-ends-well stuff that makes many Dickens' endings so sickeningly unbelievable, these novels often end in pain and loss, though the decent society of the town makes up for a lot of it.  There are no deus ex machina solutions.

Warmly recommended.  This will become a staple in our family's entertainment.",1268006400,3,3076,4.929961089494164

3355817,4,B00140PK6O,"I should begin by saying that I came to this BBC DVD full of curiosity as to how the producers would choose to adapt Mrs Gaskell's novel. Ever since discovering her novels some three decades ago, I've been a fan of her writing.  Unlike Thackeray, who is charming but somewhat distant (at least for me) or Dickens, who is (in my opinion) too often over-blown and given over to sentimentality, or George Eliot, who intrudes too much with her use of Authorial Voice, Mrs Gaskell is a minimalist. Working on a very small canvas - in this case the small village of Knutsford, here transformed into the fictionalized Cranford - she delicately and incisively picks out many themes that are otherwise almost entirely neglected by her contemporaries. Subjects such as the emancipation of women and their suitability to take larger roles in society are exquisitely touched upon, but unlike Dickens or Eliot Mrs Gaskell never hectors, never lectures, and never sets her art in second place to her desire for social reform.  In my mind this makes her more effective than her peers and certainly a more enjoyable read. I've often re-read North and South for pleasure whereas I've read Hard Times just once. Mrs Gaskell's book is balanced and thoughtful whereas Dickens' work is strident, crude and highly polar.

So how did the BBC fare with their adaptation?  In one word: magnificently. Not only did the writer stay close to the spirit of the book (strictly, a book-in-three-parts, as was typical of the day), but also the director and crew did a superb job of trying to whisk us back in time. Most period dramas are too obviously modern-day actors and actresses in period dress; in Cranford we capture a much more authentic feeling of being back in the 1850s. Of course the actors still have teeth (which the real inhabitants of Cranford would too often have lacked) and they have nice skin that is free of flea-bites, rashes, and the other thousand-and-one inevitable blemishes that were the norm back then, and no one has any trace of pox-mark (again very common even in the well-to-do of the period) but we can overlook these things because they would shock a modern audience and detract from the story.  Instead, the producers cast older actresses for the lead roles which achieves nearly the same effect (in other words, modern-day actresses in their 50s and 60s made up to look very old and wrinkled are cast as characters who are chronologically a decade or more younger than the people who portray them). While with a good diet and healthy lifestyle one can be a very vital and youthful 60-year-old today, back in the 1850s women were nearly worn-out by their late 30s. Cranford captures this reality in a way that is not over-stressed but which creates the right undertone for the stories that unfold.

Cranford is about life. About the women who missed out on it (all the many genteel spinsters who for one reason or another never married, raised families, or were able to go out into the world and contribute), about the younger generation who have more chances to move beyond the home and hearth, and about great loss of all kinds. Although the stories are generally light-hearted there is a great deal of death in Cranford, reflecting actual mortality rates of the day. There are broken dreams, hopes withered, and years lost to the river of time.  Most of all there is the dramatic tension between the old women who wish everything to remain static (because then, pace Miss Haversham in Dickens' later work Great Expectations, one can pretend that life has also stood still instead of raced on and passed one by) and those who accept and even embrace change as the mechanism by means of which life can, to some degree, improve.  Whereas Dickens would have taken sides, Mrs Gaskell allows us to see both sides as human, humane, and vulnerable.  Our sympathies are engaged while at the same time we see how there are no simple rights or wrongs. This BBC production is admirable for retaining this multi-faceted aspect of Cranford and for being so delicate with the core themes. A glance from Miss Matty, now an ancient spinster whose own dreams of marriage turned to dust decades earlier, at the young and beautiful Sophie Hutton as she rides away in her wedding carriage, speaks more about loss and generosity of spirit than any monologue or dialogue ever could.

The series thus contains nearly all the treasures of the book but also its only failing. Mrs Gaskell was temperamentally suited to working in miniatures, rather like Vermeer. In consequence she could not incorporate other elements of life. If Dickens was Titian working with great dramatic sweeps and violent movements and Hardy was Rembrant dealing with darkness and light, Gaskell could touch out the finest corners and gentlest details but at the cost of missing most of mankind's less amiable characteristics. Her characters are uniformly well-intentioned with hearts of gold (sometimes hidden for a while behind gossip or affected coldness or brusqueness, but always golden within). This makes for delightful and often poignant viewing but ultimately provides a very limited, dare one say ""spinsteresque"" view of the world which can only work in a highly circumscribed setting such as Cranford. Her women are wonderfully resourceful, funny, clever and interesting but her men are essentially little more than stereotypes. Mrs Gaskell was, ultimately, as constrained as her characters by the rules of the society in which she lived. She too could not go out into the ""wider world"" and experience its terrors and elations; she had to sit at home by the parlor embroidering wonderfully enchanting tales of women who likewise lived their lives at home by the parlor.  Thus her characters and her themes are always sotto voce. This is her great charm and her great limitation.  This wonderful BBC series is faithful to her milieu.",1251417600,3,5897,4.891891891891892

3355821,5,B00140PK6O,"I love this program, and I have often watched it, both on videotape (mine was starting to flip from wear, so I purchased the DVD) and on DVD.  For Americans who saw this on PBS, a pleasant surprise is that there are speeches and brief scenes on the BBC DVD sold on Amazon that were never aired on PBS!  Some of those are relevant; for example, Mary asks Ms. Pole what her cousin (the Michael Gambon character) did after Miss Mattie refused  him. We learn on the DVD he avoided Cranford for 30 years. I'm sure that section of the scene was deleted on PBS's version.  There are numerous other scenes like that throughout this set.  If you are NOT the type of person to like period dramas set in 1800's England villages, this is not the series for you.  But while I admit I doubt I'd enjoy Gaskell's books upon which the series is based (I was not too excited by Doctor Harrison's romance, for example), this series is SO well-acted, paced, scored, and written that it is an absolute delight!

What I realized is that Cranford is character driven while the other two are more plot driven. The first hour was a little slow but it got more and more entertaining as I went and by the time it was over I had laughed and cried and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Now I think I will go back and watch it again and I am sure the first hour will be even more interesting to me. Judi Dench was amazing in this film. She played such a simple women and she did it powerfully. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys clean well made period films.,1236902400,,804,4.193548387096774
3355841,5,B00140PK6O,"This is a very engaging portrayal of the Gaskell novels.  I truly enjoyed this and the most wonderful part was to see how the women were actually so in command of the town and daily life.  As a hobbyist costumer I roared over Imelda Staunton's lace dilemma.  that woman is SO funny. .. .even when she's serious.  Judi Dench is absolutely marvelous as the weaker of the two sisters (can you believe it of strong Judi Dench?) and on the whole, the cast is brilliant--and followers of BBC costume dramas will recognize more than one or two familiar faces.  That might be a turnoff for some but welcome for others.  I received this DVD as a Valentine gift from my husband and will watch it again and again.",1236816000,,702,4.4453125
3355842,5,B00140PK6O,"""Oh,"" you say, ""This just looks like yet another British costume drama they show on PBS.""

Well, yes it is.  But don't write ""Cranford"" off.  Heck, for that matter, don't write any costume drama off.  But ""Cranford"" in particular is great TV.  Based upon three books, the story ingeniously weaves in the tales of the denizens of the small village.  The uniformly excellent cast and production values makes this one of the best television miniseries in some time.

Special mention must go to the screenwriters who took the original source material - which is funny and entertaining - and managing to make a tale that has real dramatic heft.  It's no easy feat, especially if you're familiar with the book.  ""Cranford"" is one of the most satisfying five hours of television you'll ever watch.",1236643200,,790,4.835820895522388
3355843,5,B00140PK6O,"I first purchased Cranford DVDs and watched them - it was so beautiful. The clothing, the way the setting was created, the actors were wonderful you truly felt as if you are taken back in time and you were there. I enjoyed it so much that 10 days later I purchased the Elizabeth Gaskell library collection - I didn't even care that the collection contained Cranford in it again, so now I have 2 Cranford DVDs. I watched them all and now I'm starting again. If you like that period in time - you will love these DVDs, if I were you I would purchase the collection so you have all 3 stories.

Enjoy, Sandi",1236556800,,603,4.243478260869566
3355844,5,B00140PK6O,"No need to restate the plot, others have done it before this review. I have a large collection of BBC period/historical DVDs and after passing over this title several times, I recieved it for Christmas. This is a story written and produced by women about women and the loving touch is evident everywhere. I especially enjoyed seeing Simon Woods (you'll recognize him from Pride and Prejudice, 2005 as Mr. Bingley) and Imelda Stanton (Dolores Umbridge, Harry Potter and O of P) sans pink suite. And of course, there's Judi Dench. She's just wonderful as the younger sister: Touching, sad, lively and ever hopeful. I wonder if Dame Judi  needs an extra granddaughter? I'd like to be invited over for tea sometime.

Anyway, make yourself a nice cup of tea (not the green stuff, it's bad for your liver and you'll find out who thinks so), make some time for yourself and watch this beautiful and loving and funny story about the Ladies of Cranford. In addition and just in case you haven't already discovered this gem. Please check out ""Ladies in Lavender"", with Judi Dench and Maggie Smith.",1235865600,,1087,4.776595744680851

3355848,5,B00140PK6O,"One of the glories of recent television history, ""Cranford"" is thoroughly delightful.  A story with overlapping plot points hinging on petty small-town customs, it has deeper undercurrents and themes, which underscore the universality of how tradition, the individual, and the larger world intersect.  The universally flawless performances (something nearly unheard of in Hollywood productions) of the British cast, some very familiar, some much less so, with an exceptional screenplay cobbled together from several novels make for an experience that surpasses most period pieces.  What at first seems to be a superficial satire of an isolated village overseen by a variety of small-minded elder women ruled by meaningless conventions and intentionally oblivious to the larger world becomes a story of how people adapt as a result of the personal and social forces around them, and how all this can bring out the inherent goodness in most people.  This last quality is what is ultimately so rewarding.  An optimistic and rosy-hued perspective to be sure, but it manages to be very, very sweet without making your teeth hurt.  In other hands it could have been a silly, treacly, manipulative farce, as it incorporates elements of camp, comedy, and social satire as well as social realism and tragedy, but here it makes you weep and wish for more.",1234396800,3,1345,5.232558139534884

I can't believe John Adams beat this out at the Golden Globes - Cranford is 100 times more thoughtful, touching, and engaging than that dry old lump of a miniseries.

3355857,5,B00140PK6O,"The BBC never does anything half-way, and so goes CRANFORD, the story of a mid-19th century British town created by Elizabeth Gaskell and brought to life by screenwriter Heidi Thomas. Already nominated for ten BAFTA awards, eight Emmys, and three Golden Globes, this five episode miniseries is masterfully done in all aspects, including content, design and acting.

Taking place over one year -- from the summer of 1842 to the summer of 1843 -- the miniseries chronicles the struggles of one township and its unflagging residents as they battle rumors, financial ruin, educational boundaries, medical plights, and the threat of change brought by an unwelcome railroad line.

With a stunning 25 member prime cast, the BBC pulled out all the stops to make this a star-studded affair. They include Dame Judi Dench (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casino-Royale/dp/B000MRA5NS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casino Royale</a>), Simon Woods (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pride-Prejudice/dp/B000E1ZBGS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pride & Prejudice</a>), Imelda Staunton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freedom-Writers/dp/B000OONQ8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freedom Writers</a>), Jim Carter (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Compass/dp/B00139XZF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Compass</a>), Alex Jenkins (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Queen/dp/B000NTPDK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Queen</a>), and Francesca Annis (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Libertine/dp/B000F7CECK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Libertine</a>) ...just to name a few.

Funny, compassionate, and often heart-wrenching, Cranford is a town the audience dives into and submerges themselves. We become intimate witnesses to everything, and most of this is accomplished through the eyes of Mary Smith played by Lisa Dillon (whom I gave top billing to rather than Dame Judi Dench). Upon Mary's arrival in Cranford at the very beginning of the first episode we witness the trials, successes and failures of just about everyone within Cranford's fold. Overseeing most of Cranford's wealth is Lady Ludlow (Francesca Annis) who often delivers swift and hard decisions on the town but softens as time goes by. Helping her (and in her employ) is Mr. Carter (Philip Glenister,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kingdom-of-Heaven/dp/B000AARKOO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kingdom of Heaven</a>) who helps oversee her business and tries to keep Ms. Ludlow from destroying her wealth. Helping Mr. Carter is Harry (Alex Etel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Water-Horse/dp/B0012IWRDM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Water Horse</a>), the child of squatters and battling a life of education versus hard labor.

But I would be seriously remiss if I didn't mention the main ladies of Cranford for whom everything encircles. Mainly this is Matty Jenkyns (Dench) and -- initially -- her sister Deborah (Eileen Atkins), whom Mary Smith comes to live with during the first episode. Deborah (Atkins) is the somewhat overbearing but incredibly hospitable sister who fears change more than anything but grudgingly accepts it (this is shown during an early funeral scene when she walks behind the carriage). Matty (Dench) is the more accepting sister who learns that love never really dies, it sometimes just takes a lot longer to blossom (via friendship, old romances, or a simple child).

The other two women that I MUST mention are the comedic relief within the series (and the heaviest gossipers), Miss Pole (Imelda Staunton) and Mrs. Forrester (Julia McKenzie). These two trouble-making but vitally important characters were the glue that helped hold Cranford together ...and sometimes threatened to tear it apart (for instance, when the new doctor was thought to have been engaged to three different women, much of the blame could be placed on these two women's shoulders for the misunderstanding).

There is, of course, much more going on in this series than I would want to write about (mainly for fear of boring you or causing cramps from typing too much ...or both). Rest assured you should see this. It is quaint, fun, and simply brilliant. Enjoy another Masterpiece Theater spectacle.",1231027200,3,4478,6.712068965517242

Spoiler alert: One of the story lines is a new Doctor coming to town to help the already established town Doctor. He is new, has new medical techniques and ideas. So there are many medical scenes. Where the movie is clean I would not recommend it for children under 10.  There is a broken arm where you see the bone protruding, an amputation where you don't actually see it but you see the big saw and you hear it.  There are many sad deaths in the movie...sad because you have come to love them and want their story line to keep going.

There are many funny parts that had me rolling and I have to say some I did not catch until the second time I watched it.

The central characters of the story, set in mid-nineteenth century England, are two spinster daughters of a clergyman, Dorothea and Mathilda Jenkyns (Miss Jenkyns and Miss Matty to you!)  Even though Miss Jenkyns is of a forceful nature (and beautifully portrayed by Eileen Atkins), it is dear shy Miss Matty  (Dame Judi Dench) who dominates events because of the respect everyone feels for her sweet nature. They and their neighbors must contend with the changes associated with the disconcerting transformation of rural Britain by the Industrial Revolution, as well as with the inherent challenges of life.  The ladies face poverty, death, servant problems, love, wandering cows, evil stepmothers, and questions of attire with aplomb, assisted by a few brave men:  the frank and winning Captain Brown; Mr. Morgan, the doctor, and Mr. Harrison, the doctor's new young partner, who has recently set the hearts of all the village maidens aflutter.  At a distance reigns the aging but elegant Lady Ludlow and her steward Mr. Carter, who must decide how to deal with a local poacher and his bright and capable young son, and how to pay the mortgage on the estate.

This series is wonderfully acted and beautifully produced--really a living window on a vanished life.  Each character grows and develops, sometimes in unexpected ways--sometimes funny and sometimes poignant.  The most winning thing was the way in which, as much as they contended and struggled with each other at times, the ladies always faced real emergencies with utter kindness.

3355881,4,B00140PK6O,"""Cranford,""a recently-made, typically lush British Broadcasting Company comic costume drama, is based on the classic works of Mrs. Elizabeth Gaskell, a celebrated British Victorian-era novelist.  The Emmy-nominated production, in five episodes, uses Gaskell's ""Cranford,""with added material from two of her short stories, one about Lady Ludlow, and one about young Dr. Harrison. It is set in 1842-3 in a small rural Cheshire town, based by the author on the real town of Knutsford.  The gorgeous location filming was done in Hertfordshire; with Ashridge Park, Little Godesden, modeling for Lady Ludlow's estate, Hanbury. It boasts a large cast of top-rank British actors, and more stars than there are in Heaven, as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer used to like to boast.

The story, clearly aimed at the demographic of an older female audience, who love Public Broadcasting Systems ""Masterpiece Theatre,"" and the filmed work of Merchant/Ivory -- just like me, of course, as charged --centers on the women of Cranford, most of them no longer young, robbed of any chance at marriage by the Napoleonic wars.

As the Tomkinson sisters, Selina Griffiths and Deborah Findlay provide sweet comic relief.

There are also men in Cranford of course, and some very heavy-weight male actors playing them, though their parts are generally lighter than the women's.  Chief among them must be the acclaimed Michael Gambon (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Singing-Detective/dp/B00007HGIJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Singing Detective</a>),as Mr. Holbrook, a former suitor of Miss Matty's.

James: Death in Holy Orders/The Murder Room</a>), shows up briefly as Peter Jenkyns, brother to the Jenkyns women.  Jim Carter is a sturdy Captain Brown.  Simon Woods is handsome, and  light of touch, as young Dr. Harrison, who comes to town bearing new medical techniques, and somehow gets himself into trouble with the local womenfolk. Philip Glenister as Mr. Carter appears in every episode and may have the strongest, most dramatic individual scenes in the production.  And playing right with him, to the hilt, as young Harry Gregson, a poacher's son, is young Alex Etel, who shone so brightly as the little boy in Neil Jordan's film ""Millions.""

The Cheshire locals, of course, will have their own strong country accent, with which Americans will not be comfortable.  And, while looking elsewhere on the Internet, I found a comment about this production: ""If you don't know what they're saying, turn on the subtitles.""  So here comes the subtitle report: if only we could.  It is fiddly work indeed trying to turn on those subtitles, and we failed at it in this house.  Can't the BBC do better for this blue-ribbon production?",1220400000,6,5135,7.029827315541601

Then I bought this and it was TOTALLY worth it. It was wonderful and I enjoyed every minute of it. Lots of different story lines intertwined and most come to a happy ending. I'm very glad I bought this movie and listened to the good reviews!",1219104000,,598,4.396396396396397
3355887,5,B00140PK6O,"This show was just plain perfection. The acting was wonderful (as was the casting) and the seamless story (a compilation of 3 of Gaskell's stories) was just impecably done.

This was such a pleasure to watch. I cannot rave enough about how well done this production was. There is just not a lot more to say about this fabulous show....",1219017600,2,335,4.583333333333333
3355888,5,B00140PK6O,"Let me make something perfectly clear, OK? I'm a guy. Like most guys, my favorite kind of movie has plenty of action, with fights, car chases, explosions, hot babes, and violence, with a little blood or gore sprinkled in. So why did I give this one five stars? Let me try to explain.

Going in, your typical red-blooded American male might be put off a bit; judging by it's cover, Cranford appears to be just another in a long line of boring English bonnet romances, full of people in wigs and weird clothes sitting around in parlours talking to each other. If you're looking for a testosterone-fueled trip through hell, a la Tarantino, Peckinpah or Woo, you might be disappointed. I waited and waited, but I could find not one fist fight, stabbing, shooting, rape, steamy sex scene, unexposed nipple or horrible murder in the whole dang thing!

But gents, don't automatically dismiss this one: if you look, you will find a surprising amount of death, gore and violence: in one scene, a kid smashes in the skull of a defenseless rabbit. In another, a cat pukes up some hand-knit lace. And then a cow falls into a lime pit and gets all it's hide burned off. So I guess you could say that animals have a tough time in this miniseries.

But the people have some rough patches as well. In the first twenty minutes the young carpenter Jem falls from a ladder and suffers a compound fracture of his right forearm, which is pretty gruesome. You wouldn't think that there would be many deaths in this one either, but it seems like people are keeling over every other minute. A very young kid dies of croup, a crippled young woman dies of who knows what, one of the main characters, Deborah Jenkyns (Eileen Atkins), strokes out, and the great Michael Gambon's character, the lovelorn Mr. Holbrook, contracts pneumonia and bites it before he has a chance to marry his long lost love, Mattie Jenkyns ((there is nothin' like a DAME) Judy Dench). The local shopkeeper Mr. Johnson is clubbed on the back of his head and robbed. A family of squatters is forced to live in abject squalor while the father must poach game to keep his family from starvation.

There is a top-notch ""babe"" in the series too. Kimberly Nixon plays the young daughter of the local parson. She is a ""pretty as a picture"" actress, first-rate eye candy, a perfect rosy-cheeked beauty seemingly born for this type of film, who will have a long and very bright future in the many inevitable English period romances to be produced over the next ten years. I hoped and prayed for a scene of her swimming naked in a sylvan lake or even a brief glimpse of her in the boudoir, but alas it never happened. I guess you will have to use your imagination.

Another huge negative: it appeared there were no ""pavement princesses"" or brothels in the town of Cranford. Or they chose not to show us. Damn!

Nor were there coach chases, bloody shootouts, pub brawls, adulterers, adulteresses or dispicable villains in Cranford.

However, you do get a lot of humor, color, poignancy, romance, emotion, beauty, magnificent costumes, fabulous photography, and wonderful character development and acting. With all that, I guess I can overlook the absence of fist fights and sex. I hate to admit that; it's not very manly of me, but it's true. Cranford did not suck.",1219017600,10,3302,4.653516295025729

3355892,5,B00140PK6O,"I just finished watching the BBC's Cranford miniseries and it was wonderful.  The series is set in a small town in 1840s England.  Cranford is a town full of unmarried women (very common at the time with all of the men who had died in the Napoleonic wars and those who had gone to the colonies--India, etc) where social decorum and gossip are equally important.  Change is afoot in Cranford as the railroad comes into the area and small town life threatens to change forever.  The miniseries aptly captures the mood of the age, showing the emotion of the townspeople in a memorable way.

This is a wonderful ensemble piece, even though Judi Dench really does steal just about every scene she's in.  All of the main characters are well developed, and as you learn their back-stories you like them even more.  When the miniseries was over I wanted more--so I will definitely be renting the other BBC Elizabeth Gaskell movies.

I had never seen any series based on Elizabeth Gaskell novels before, so if you are in doubt, I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys Jane Austen, Louisa May Alcott, or even the recent BBC version of Bleak House.  The miniseries is done with all of the usual BBC taste so be ready to enjoy some quality period fun!",1217721600,2,1250,4.594594594594595
3355893,5,B00140PK6O,"Cranford, a thought provoking commentary on societal change, is beautifully written and produced, with fascinating characters and excellent acting.  It is extremely well done.  We will watch it again and again, I'm sure.",1217203200,,220,5.636363636363637
3355894,5,B00140PK6O,"I have not read the book, so I do not know how closely it is followed, but I loved this 2 DVD series. The characters draw you into their 19th Century lives.  The absence of eligible men in the town of Cranford is the underlying cause of the story.  The most heart wrenching scenes involve misunderstandings and class distinction-which I suppose is still prevalent in Britain today.  Judi Dench is superb and I enjoyed seeing so many of the actors I have come to love from other BBC series.",1217203200,,489,4.47191011235955
3355895,5,B00140PK6O,I love BBC productions.  This one is no exception.  It is delightfully written and exceptionally well acted.  High quality viewing.,1217030400,,131,5.45
3355896,5,B00140PK6O,"Cranford is an 1840s rural English village where nothing ever really changes and everything obeys an archaic social code of social calling, gossip and mild xenophobia. Thrown into this heady mix of social convention and small-town principles are Mary Smith (Lisa Dillon), the young friend of the Jenkyns sisters (Judi Dench, Eileen Atkins) and Dr. Harrison (Simon Woods), protoge of the more established and more conventional Dr. Morgan (John Bowe).

The cast list reads like a Who's Who and Who's Left of A-List British acting talent: in addition to the players already named above (all of them giving excellent performances),  we have Francesca Annis, Imelda Staunton, Philip Glenister, Deborah Findlay, Julia McKenzie, Michael Gambon, Julia Sawalha - the list goes on and on. I'll just say that the calibre of acting in ""Cranford"" represents some of the best work of all its principle actors, and make special mention of Judi Dench (the woman can do no wrong, it seems: her beautiful, heart-rending portrayal of Matty Jenkyns is engaging and extremely rewarding), Julia Sawalha (her Spinster-on-the-shelf is one of the series' high points) and Imelda Staunton and Julia McKenzie (roles to match that of Dench: we don;t see enough of either actress, though).

Production design and direction are every bit the equal of the eponymous Firth/Ehle ""Pride and Prejudice"" or the Gillian Anderson ""Bleak House"", and Sue Birtwhistle's witty, cleverly adapted script keeps everything moving forward at a gently progressive pace. It's unashamedly feel-good, but don't let the superficial triteness of parts of the plot put you off: ""Cranford"" contains a wealth of top-drawer acting talent and buckets enough of the feel-good factor, along with hefty dashes of black comedy and romantic drama, and makes the cheese factor a necessary and enjoyable facet of this wonderful series.

I can't tell you much more about ""Cranford"" without revealing plot spoilers, so I will not: but please don't take the shortness of this review as a reflection of the series' quality: ""Cranford"", everything about it and everyone in it, is absolutely excellent. If it has a flaw, it's that there's not enough of it to go round. You'll definitely be left wanting more, and in this case, that's a very, very good thing indeed.

Wholly recommended.",1216944000,,2315,5.195710455764075
3355897,5,B00140PK6O,"The BBC has truly outdone itself with the wonderful production of ""Cranford"".  The triumverate of Judi Dench, Eileen Atkins, and Imelda Staunton makes the series a sheer force of cinematic strength.  All three of these leading lights prove incandescent, but their luminous brilliance does not vie for favor--rather, each actress perfectly coplements the other.

Nor is the skill limited to this trio.  The supporting cast is also well-matched, with legends Michael Gambon and Francesca Annis lending their assistance, as well as Simon Woods (whom I recognized from ""Rome""), the lovely Lesley Manville (""The Cazalets"", ""North & South""--the 2nd being another Mrs. Gaskell adaptation), and the darling Claudie Blakely (""Gosford Park"", as well as 2005's ""Pride & Prejudice""), to name but a few.

Purists may squirm that this film is not a verbatim reproduction of Elizabeth Gaskell's novel of the same name, but incorporates much of that book's plotline while adding in those of two other books by her, namely, ""Mr. Harrison's Confessions"" and ""My Lady Ludlow"".  I found the result to be thoroughly enjoyable.

Cranford's society is dominated by a cadre of thoroughly proper ladies, domineered by the righteous Miss Deborah Jenkyns (Atkins).  Her sister, Miss Mathilda (popularly known as Matty) Jenkyns, is softer-hearted; while Deborah is generally unyielding and stern, her sense of compassion and duty does ingratiate her character to the audience eventually.  Miss Pole (Staunton) is easily the grande-dame of the village's gossip circuit and her near-hysterical antics in making certain she is ""THE FIRST"" to pass along juicy tidbits makes for several laugh-out-loud incidents.

While often light-hearted and amusing, ""Cranford"" does address more sobering issues, such as the rigorous class structure's inherent refusal to allow a person to better himself.  This is best played out by Lady Ludlow's (Annis) disgust at learning her head clerk, Mr. Carter, has taught young Harry Gregson (the son of a local squatter/poacher) to read and write.  Literacy, according to Lady Ludlow, is a privilege solely reserved for the upper classes; if the lower orders were to attain it, they would not remember their place.

The imminent arrival of the railway in Cranford is another focal point of the storyline.  The majority of the village's citizenry loathe the idea and are terrified of the great changes it will surely herald for them all.
Romances, demises, losses of fortune, family squabbles, the bleaching of lace collars, and the manner in which to consume an orange with the greatest degree of propriety [quite seriously--and the results are most amusing!]:  ""Cranford"" affords all this and much more, and will assuredly leave the viewer with gleeful smile and a full heart.",1216857600,,2774,5.330275229357798

3355900,5,B00140PK6O,"We had planned to watch the Cranford episodes as they unfolded on PBS, but because we had a houseguest, I taped them. When we finished viewing the series, my husband had found them so interesting and engaging that he asked to view them a second time. Consequently, I ordered the DVD and we thoroughly enjoyed watching the ""Making of Cranford"".

I first learned of Elizabeth Gaskell while reading Phyllis McGinley's Sixpence in Her Shoe, when I was newly married. Years later while visiting a London bookstore, I found several of the Gaskell novels and added them to my library. I couldn't resist rereading Cranford the week after seeing the final episode.

I liked the blending of three of Gaskell's novels into this telling of the story. My Lady Ludlow and Mr. Harrison's Confessions give the village a larger context and paint a more complete picture of England at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. However, nothing of the charm of the perfect English village is lost in this delightful retelling of the story. Each actor seems to catch his character's virtues and foibles perfectly.",1215993600,2,1095,4.945652173913044

3355923,3,B00140PK6O,"To sum it up, I had trouble with the story itself, not really with the video. This item was in the well-acted BBC fashion. The scenes took you away, back to that simple time. The costumes were good and the charm was definitely there. The story, however, was flawed. Not to give too much away, but the angst became predictable and troubling. Opportunities for happiness were snuffed out almost methodically. The upturn during the last hour of the series doesn't quite make up for number of disappointments. It left me feeling completely unfulfilled.",1213747200,5,548,4.903225806451613
3355924,5,B00140PK6O,"This was a delightful movie and has become one of my new favorites.  For the Jane Austen DVD viewer and reader, this will be a joy!

3355925,5,B00140PK6O,"Every aspect of 1840's British Village life seemed to be  represented in this BBC ""Little-House-on-the-Prairie-meets-Dame-Judith"" masterpiece. It is tender, romantic, tragic, charming, hilarious, thoughtful - and all with that outstanding cast. I didn't want the series to end, even though the ending was satisfying on many levels. Elizabeth Gaskell is new to me, but I know Cranford will become part of my regular rotation along with the BBC Jane Austens and Charles Dickens' to be savored - like going home - again and again.",1213747200,,527,5.273809523809524
3355926,5,B00140PK6O,"I read Cranford several years ago and found it to be a quiet book, about ordinary people who exhibited extraodinary kindness.  I was touched by the love and commitment the circle of women friends, in this small town, shared with each other.  The movie is fleshed out by the addition of two other of Elizabeth Gaskells' book into the story line, but remains consistent to the theme of the book by reminding us  that friendship is priceless.  Needless to say, Judi Dench  is nothing short of perfection in her role as Miss Matty, but the rest of the cast are brilliant  as well.  I started to watch this on a rented netflix dvd and before the first episode was over had ordered my own copy.",1213660800,,688,4.456

(By the way, there is an Elizabeth Gaskell Collection boxset with all three of these). I was not disappointed at all! It is truly a ""Masterpiece"". I laughed and cried my way through each episode. My only complaint is that it was much too short! I was thrilled to see the producers were contemplating additional episodes. Enough gushing, go watch it for yourselves!",1213315200,,499,4.747126436781609
3355930,5,B00140PK6O,What's not to like!  This is exceptional film making of the highest caliber.  A cast of some of the best of British acting aristocracy do their thing; transporting us to the village of Cranford and making us care for its citizenry.

3355934,5,B00140PK6O,"For those who have not tried watching British miniseries, books turned to movies or BBC television; this is the place to start. Cranford is not to long (not long enough, also) being just 5 hour-long episodes. It is a comedy/drama that will delight any new fan. It is an ice cream sundae for those already loving the British Victorian stories. Beautiful costumes and sets. Plus an insane Victorian milk cow (I'll not ""spoil"" this portion with an explanation).

Cranford has it all. The cast is headed by Judi Dench, being a guarantee of enjoyment for any movie.  She is the star in every episode with her superb acting of the character Miss Matty.  Like the other ladies of this small British Village, she specializes in knowing the right thing to do and say in every social engagement. It is a laugh-out-loud experience to watch the town's old spinsters interact--especially when the new young doctor arrives in town.  It seems young and old alike decide he is their chance for love and living.  What a hilarious set of events caused by a prank by the young doctor's friend. If it's not marrying hopefuls wagging their tongues then it's the anti-railroad ladies trying to preserve the perfectness of the small community. You will side with those against the new railroad intrusion.

The ladies will have you laughing one moment and then genuinely moved by their situation the next. What an amazing story, the book written by Elizabeth Gaskill.  The British accents are delightful but for those unaccustomed to the dialects, the DVD offers subtitles in English, often a help, yet not distracting when not needed as they are place outside the widescreen box.

The young boy Harry Gregson is played by Alex Etel and is a young, poor chap you will fall in love with. You will want to contribute yourself to his livelihood, this thirst for education, and his dedication to assist his family in survival. The list of fine acting is endless, as the entire cast seems destined for an award for their work.

Yes, Cranford is the DVD to buy to get a taste of British drama/comedy. Be prepared: it is addictive and this particular DVD set is right up at the top. The story is so small-village comfortable and ends so feel-good delightfully that we should all be so lucky as to live in Cranford. Next best idea: replay the story beginning with disc one.",1212624000,3,2341,4.732186732186732
3355935,5,B00140PK6O,"This is one of the lastest and greatest from the BBC. Long overdue.
Each character has their own story line which is interwoven with the others in a compelling saga.
If you like this, also check out Larkrise to Candleford, another excellent period drama from the BBC.",1212105600,2,267,4.702127659574468
3355936,5,B00140PK6O,"Help, I'm stuck in a small, Victorian town being pleasantly spied on by a bunch of sweet, proper, opinionated, gossipy, nosey, and at times, crazy Cranford women!  I'm due for a timely visit from two elderly sisters who know everything about everyone.

This is not Jane Austen, although there are similarities.  There are groups of women, lots of relationships, humor and romance; however,  death, disease and disaster also rear up and are more prevalent, and exposed here.

The author, Elizabeth Gaskell (1810-1865) lived after Austen, and wrote the great novels to PBS movies of 'North and South', Wives and Daughters' and was friends with Charlotte 'don't call me Jane Ayre' Bronte.  Gaskell penned Bronte's Biography after her demise, and it was in Charles Dicken's mag, 'Household Words' that Cranford appeared in 1853.

Bringing this enchanting place to a 5-hour period piece is an immense undertaking, and BBC does a great job at it.  After the recent downpour of Jane Austen/Jane Ayre re-do's, one wonders if there are any towns left to film in England not seen, any English actors not used, any costumes, music, directors, etc., etc., not indulged.  Well, it's a different time period than Austen's, and one can't ever get enough English countryside or actors, such as Judi Dench and Eileen Atkins, who portray the sisters and are simply marvelous.  Their characters compliment and confront each other perfectly.  Atkins plays the crusty one but with a good heart.  Dench is sweet and knowing, and through their eyes, Cranford unfolds.  On the higher, social spectrum, Lady Ludlow(Francesca Annis) reigns solo, gripping tightly onto her fading world and aplomb.

It's not just a world of older matriarchs, but of young love and misunderstandings, professional clashes between generations, and the ever dominating class struggles.  The movie hops and interacts between all the storylines in potpourri fashion, sometimes outrageously funny, other times sad but not morose.  Amazing that the editing flows so well.

Although it's not as light and frisky as the BBC/A&E 'Pride and Prejudice' (a tough comparison!), it merits it own applause as a very fine, very 'proper' comedy/drama.  And apparently a sequel is planned.  I guess I'll never get out of this town.  Enjoy.",1212019200,6,2276,5.183561643835616
3355937,3,B00140PK6O,"Admittedly, a great series.  On the other hand, I resent having to sit through fifteen minutes of BBC commercials to get to the program.  I do not mind this being on the disc, as a matter of fact, I like it there but I would like to access it at my and not the BBC's leisure.  If I wanted to watch commercial TV I would do so.",1211500800,9,326,3.8358208955223883
3355938,4,B00140PK6O,"This movie is beautifully filmed, extremely well acted (it's fun to see some favorite English actors in very minor roles) and nicely entertaining.  It's one that you'll want to pull out every so often and watch again.",1211500800,2,217,4.864864864864865
3355939,5,B00140PK6O,I enjoyed watching this series so much that I had to buy it to add to my collection! This is definitely going to be the next 'girl's night' movie that we watch!,1211414400,5,160,4.03125
3355940,5,B00140PK6O,"This marvelous film is based on ""Cranford"" AND two novellas by Gaskell - ""My Lady Ludlow"" and ""Mr Harrison's Confession"". Depending upon which edition of Cranford you purchase, these stories may or may not be included. So much for comparing below the plot of the film to the books.

This adaptation is one of the best ever done and ever shown on the BBC or on PBS here in the States.  The acting is beyond first-rate; these actors are so believable, their acting so subtle and yet strong, that one forgets completely that each of the older ladies is an actor of quite a bit of renown.  The Victorian essentials of thwarted romance, disappointed hopes, bonnets and shawls, legacies and runaway brothers, country towns and grand estates, are enriched with priceless moments of poignancy and laugh-out-loud humor.  If I were to say which actresses run away with the show, they are Judi Dench (quite different here from the feisty woman she often plays) and Imelda Staunton, who apparently can take absolutely any role and make it her own.  Lavish  scenes shot on location, plenty of outdoors to breathe in, wonderful costumes and details.  This is well-worth the buying--I was moved to tears, and can't wait to watch it again.",1211155200,10,1223,4.822966507177034
3355941,5,B00140PK6O,"A series worth watching. Great period drama with great performances and all without steaming sex scenes.

Finally a great play where we finally can enjoy a story about a ""little village"" with all their problems, difficulties, death - but also triumph and change.

At last there is a movie where mature actresses/actors, like Judi Dench,Eileen Atkins and Michael Gambon can shine !!!

3355942,5,B00140PK6O,"Cranford strikes just the right balance between absurdity and heart.  The cast is first class.  The combined talent of this ensemble will astonish you, and they all act with incredible restraint.
The screenplay is very well crafted--seeming to draw equally the fleshing out of the strange characters, and the fleshing out of the various plots.  Anyone who has lived in a small town will certainly appreciate the idiosyncrasies of such a community, and see parallels to their own life in the lives of the Cranford residents.
I highly highly recommend this series.  I could watch it over and over.",1211155200,12,595,4.97979797979798
3355943,5,B00140PK6O,"U.S. television programming is at an all time low of mindless, degrading
stupidity, violence and sexuality. Most times it is hardly worth turning
on. Thank God for BBC. Cranford is a little masterpiece of charm, wit
and warmth. The soap opera of the 1800's. Two secrets to British movies
and television---characters always look like real people. They are engaging to watch because they look so interesting and different. The
U.S. market continually hires the same look of a thirty year old, beautiful mannequin or an elderly woman who has had plastic surgery to
look like a thirty year old. Everyone is so homogenized in the L.A. look
that it is akin to watching science fiction. Add gratuitous sex and a
poorly written plot and you have our ""made for TV"" movies and most sitcoms. Brit actors are a rich tapestry of the human face and it pays off. Secondly, Cranford is filmed and costumed in a sort of ""sepia"" tone
which fits the time and place. The gray, green, brown of most--the interior dingy atmosphere is true to homes of the period. Contrast is
scarce (the wealthy, the color of imported silks, a May Day celebration) but
very effective. I will watch this series over and over and visit my new
friends in Cranford. I have read in British newspapers online that the
actors have all signed on to do a Christmas (in Cranford) special to
reprise the characters so we have something to look forward to.",1211155200,30,1405,4.6923076923076925

Even the minor characters have fully developed personalities and I was completing drawn into their world.  I laughed over and over and cried more than once.

In the beginning, it feels as though Cranford is full of busy-bodies as they all strive to know each others' business.  But by the end it seemed that nearly every single character had been given a chance to do something special for a neighbor, and relished the opportunity.
