I wasted mine and I am trying to sell it on EBAY so I can recover at least the shipping charges. This one can never be compared to any slasher movie even the worst one you have ever watched. Save your hard earned money for better movies!!!  I wonder if there is a rate lower than 1...",1373846400,5,425,4.3125
5636226,5,B00BKUO21W,"I've been following the production since it was just an idea in Steve's head, and the result is something quite extraordinary. Unlike most indie horror films, or hell, most major studio horror films, EMD manages to deliver a unique concept, good kills, and interesting characters all while making sure to not skimp on the nudity and blood. This is not a PG-13 slasher film, and thank god for that. Follow the tale of a town hopping slasher and the man set on revenge for one of the most memorable 71 minutes you are probably going to experience this year. I cannot say enough good things about this film and its creator Steve Rudzinski.",1371513600,3,636,4.6371681415929205
5636227,5,B00BKUO21W,"I was looking for Everyone Poops and stumbled across this, it looked interesting enough so I decided to pick it up. I was very surprised! Prob one of the best indy horror comedy films I have seen. The cast works really well together and Nicole Beattie is very easy on the eyes.

Do yourself a favour and check it out.  I mean, aren't you already desperately in suspense to find out whether or not the title has any shred of irony to it?

5636233,3,B00BKUO21W,"Its easy to complain about the bad acting shot on video look, also the fact that the bulk of the film takes place in the middle of the day in a backyard on what looks like a bus street; but i wont. I spend allot of time watching these shot on video ""lets get the gang together and make a move today"" films and compared to most this is very good. Its a fun ride one with a good amount of humor and it has a twist ending...well not so much twist but its a surprise . My only complaint is there was to many boobs and not enough blood, i just wish this film was allot bloodier; like if we are going to ""Kill Them All"" make it a blood bath. Thats all; other then that i would have to say its not a bad film its fun there is a good silly amount of humor and suspense overall i enjoyed it.",1443139200,2,782,3.803680981595092

5636236,2,B00BKUO21W,"I've been gorging on micro budget indie horror on Amazon Prime lately and there have been some amazing revelations like An American Terror and Carver. This is not one of those revelations. It's an amateurishly shot and acted no budget affair with lots of self-referential humor that I'm sure the filmmakers thought was very witty. It's certainly not terrible but it's EXACTLY the kind of thing that people catch on Prime, squirm their way through half an of hour before giving up, and are then put off anytime they start a movie and find out its shot on video. If you love ALL indie horror, you will love this too, and it has a certain charm, but for diehard DIY buffs, not casual viewers.",1428969600,,689,4.564516129032258
5636237,5,B00BKUO21W,"I had fun watching this.  It really was a LOW BUDGET film with just enough cheese to make it fun.  I do have a question for the director, why so much nudity from such below average looking girls?",1427846400,,195,4.105263157894737

5636247,5,B00BKUO21W,"I thought it was great! The editing and line delivery was a little out of timing and awkward but for a low-budget indie film, it was awesome! As far as the characters go, the lead guy Kyle was terrible and shouldn't give up his day job. The girl that played Jennie was really cute but that's pretty much all she had going for her. (I looked her up, she should stick to modeling) My favorite characters were killed off too quickly. My faves were the rapper guy (funny as hell), and the long haired blond with the attitude problem. Those two were obviously the only ones who had any acting ability. The goth chick was just awful and the character was pretty extraneous, but the 'class president' and the football dude were hilarious. Loved the lawnmower part.  Ok, onto the story without giving too much away. The story line is genius. There is a really funny twist in the beginning, didn't see THAT one coming. And the killer is unique, you don't know what the heck is going on. I personally think that's awesome for horror films. And if you don't like the film itself, there are plenty of boobs to ogle.

It is pretty much a movie made by some kids because they were bored and found a bottle of costume blood.

5636255,2,B00BKUO21W,"..I would call them actors, I did try.

I don't know whether or not to give it 2 or 3 stars. The acting was, gesh, I don't know what to call it, terrible, weak, sad, humorous, trying... trying on my part to get through it. The script is below B Horror. I believe it's a black comedy.

I seriously do not know how it got up to the stars it has in reviews... with that being said, [spoiler; but hell, risk it] it's about a serial killer (or killers) going around from town to town killing people. And those that are about to be killed with a machete or whatever, seemed to have forgotten their phone right outside - wow. shocker. There seems to be more time seeing t&a than killing (only about 6 people die - more people die in a Jason movie). So, that's about it. Seems worse than an old 'USA up all night' movie.

5636259,4,B00BKUO21W,"This is a fun low budget slasher. The killer (s) is dressed in black ninja style outfits and freely walk anywhere unnoticed. The movie introduces characters long enough for us to not like them and then they are killed off.

In the one outdoor scene, the sound is noticeably horrible. It was a windy day when they filmed and you had a constant background wind noise, except when they cut off the sound and kept the film going at which time it suddenly goes silent. Some of the dialogue was humorous, even though trite.

If you like low budget pointless campy slashers, this one fits the bill.

Note: If you run over someone's head with a cheap lawn mower, the blade will stop. I can't keep mine going over kittens.

8570019,5,B00BKUO21W,"I saw Pia Lindstrm review the movie ""Natural Born Killers"" when it came out in '94. Bear with me, this is a short story, and it's probably more interesting than this movie anyway. Pia Lindsrom was on that style news show from long ago when the evening news included a movie critic, and everyone sitting around at their broadcast desks. Pia, after sitting there in front of the whole news team and saying how much she hated Natural Born Killers, how utterly stupid it was, how it was ridiculous, and grotesque, and pointless - she threw her hands up in the air and said, ""And I give it 5 stars.""
Surprised, everyone in the newsroom cracked up and asked where the heck that came from. Pia was laughing too, as she explained her criteria for her star ratings. She said, as a critic she watches movies for a living, several a day, every single day. There are so many she has to get through and critique that it is very rare she will ever watch one a second time. It's work. And, if a movie stays with her, so much so that she makes time to watch it a second time, she felt compelled to give it 5 stars, whether she liked the movie or not, because it obviously accomplished something beyond the realm of ""I liked it"" or ""It was good.""

I'm not comparing ""Everyone Must Die!"" with ""Natural Born Killers"". I'm comparing myself to Pia Lindstrom.

I watched this yesterday afternoon, thinking how horrible the acting was and how stupid the dialogue is. I laughed at how the camera is tight to each actor when they speak, and then cuts away to another person for their line, and then cuts away to another person, as if no one was actually in the room together when any scene was shot. I couldn't believe how long the scenes were that had no plot advancement, and then realized there was no plot to advance. I laughed when they're all kicking the killer with their flip flops on, slowly, one at a time, but he's writhing around on the ground like he's being stomped while having a seizure. I couldn't believe how terrible this thing was, like no one involved  even cared to try.

And then last night when everyone here got home, I said, ""You guys have got to watch this stupid movie,"" and I put it on again.

So like Pia Lindstrom, I have to give it that same reluctant acknowledgment. It's not good, it's not that I liked it, but I was compelled to sit through it twice, and force others to watch it. 5 stars.",1480636800,2,2399,4.357941834451902
