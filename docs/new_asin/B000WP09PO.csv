8224726,4,B000WP09PO,"A subject about which I only vaguely knew is well covered in this documentary.  I thought stigmata just referred to blood pools in one's palms, but here they say similar pools on the feet and around the forehead are the same thing.  The work speaks about side issues: invisible stigmata and evil-based stigmata.  An accompanying concern, ecstasy, also comes up.  This work is intended for both believers and skeptics.
This work has very few interviewees, especially for the cable channel that produced it.  One interviewee is a priest, but the other two are just called authors.  It is never stated if they are academics or clergy members.  I had no idea what their credentials were.  Though the interviewees were all male, the narrator said most stigmata carriers are female.
The work does not speak about cultural productions dealing with stigmata.  It says nothing about the Hollywood film of that title circa 1999.  I believe both Madonna and Britney Spears have shown stigmata in music videos.  A VH-1 documentary, if I remember correctly, said Bob and Rita Marley saw Selassie with stigmata.  Still, it's never brought up.",1210896000,,1128,5.005376344086022
