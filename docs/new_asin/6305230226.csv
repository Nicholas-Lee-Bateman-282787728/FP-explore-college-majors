1003047,5,6305230226,"Classic DePalma mixed with new age cage and sinese makes Snake Eyes a film that was totally under-rated by critics and movie-goers.  Set in an Atlantic City arena during a boxing match, with a huge tropical storm  ripping up the coast, the secretary of defence is assassinated.  The rest  of the film is set in a who-done-it atmosphere.  The whole film takes place  in real time and is one you shouldn't miss.

1003190,2,6305230226,"I used to love those old animal character cartoons where the evil character (cat, coyote, Elmer Fudd) would set over-complicated, gimmicky, sure to fail traps for the good character (roadrunner, Tweetie Bird, Bugs Bunny).  The assassination plan in ""Snake Eyes"" is another such rickety contraption. It's hard to imagine a scheme with less chance of working smoothly than the one the plotters come up with in this film.

Unfortunately the cute animals are nowhere to be seen, and their human substitutes just aren't funny, not intentionally at any rate.

Can Nicholas Cage over-act, or what?",1508025600,,590,5.189473684210526

1003559,2,6305230226,"2/5 stars because the first 20-40% of the movie is decent.

It opens with an incredible 18-minute tracking shot loaded with over-the-top Nic Cage moments, then backtracks to show the same scene from other points of view (like De Palma's Classic ""Blow Out"") before settling into a frightfully mundane, unrelatable, cookie-cutter 2nd and 3rd act. It just kind of gets boring and bad and weird right when it should be amping up the excitement. The ending is laughably awful, and was apparently a compromise from De Palma's original idea of having the entire arena wiped out by a tidal wave (might have helped?).

The giant opening sequence was ""instant classic"" material, but like Roger Ebert said about the  movie;  De Palma is a much better technical director than he is a storyteller. It's worth watching if you want a cheesy popcorn flick, or if you forgot how bad it is, or if you don't mind turning it off after twenty minutes.",1470700800,2,930,4.75776397515528

1003879,4,6305230226,"I used to love this one. I was in the middle of my movie geek phase as a teenager and absolutely adored Brian DePalma's style. That whole first shot is still something to behold, trick edits or not. The first 12 minutes looks like one long continuous take, and it's very impressive to watch. Birdman pretty much made Snake Eyes its bish in editing technique, but it's still an impressive series of scenes. To this day, I can't spot the cuts. Snake Eyes is at least worth watching up until the assassination part, at which point we're suddenly thrust into conventional cutting. But if you're a movie nerd, you have to see this at least once just for the opening. It's fantastic.

The rest of the movie doesn't quite live up to the grace of its opening, but it still has a nice elegant style going for it. The story/script is nothing amazing, but DePalma rescues it with his visual panache, and it remains one of Nicolas Cage's most over the top, entertaining performances. Gary Sinise is also fun as the villain. And for the kind of plot they were going for, it's easy to understand and not complicated at all. Just a nice easy to watch political thriller confined to an arena in Atlantic City. This kind of movie would never be greenlit these days on account that it's not a superhero movie or reboot/sequel.",1451088000,,1308,4.5423728813559325

1003934,4,6305230226,"Brian De Palma's ""Snake Eyes"" (1998) is about a fast-talking shady Atlantic City detective, Rick Santoro (Nicolas Cage), who becomes involved with a murder conspiracy at a heavyweight boxing match in an Atlantic City casino while a hurricane hits. Gary Sinise plays Naval officer Commander Dunne, Santoro's best friend, and Carla Gugino plays a mysterious woman in white.

This is a top-of-the-line crime thriller that cost a bundle. The opening 13-minute sequence is an amazing continuous shot, but some say it actually consists of several seamless cuts. Regardless, it's filmmaking of the highest order. The score by Ryichi Sakamoto is unique and a highlight. Gugino is a cutie and Jayne Heitmeyer is stunning as the lady in red. Interestingly, practically the entire movie takes place in the extravagant casino/hotel.

Some complain about the contrivances of the ending, but all these types of thrillers contain contrivances; besides, it's not as bad as people say if you reflect on it. Speaking of the ending, as good as the opening is I actually enjoyed the second half more, which is when the real villain manifests. What I like about the antagonist is that he or she has a good -- almost noble -- motive. But does the end justify the means?

Like the excellent ""Training Day,"" ""Snake Eyes"" is about a corrupt authority figure but, unlike that movie, redemption might still be possible. Unfortunately, the chickens must first come home to roost, as they say.

On the downside, as great as the two women are, they coulda done more with 'em, but this is a minor cavil.

The film is lean at 98 minutes and was shot in Atlantic City and Montreal.

Personally, I think this just adds to the suspense and helps build to an expected climax, which had unexpected results for everyone involved. Nicholas Cage plays Rick Santoro perfectly, its a role that at the time seemed as thou it could be a bit of a stretch for him, but as always he is terrific. This film is defiantly a throwback, that many people didn't seem to go for, but I think it's something different and well worth seeing.",1361664000,,745,4.485294117647059

1004019,4,6305230226,"Rick Santoro (Nicolas Cage) is a police detective in Atlantic City and he drops into a world championship boxing match to place some bets and watch the action.  Rick has a busy evening.  He shakes down criminals for money and places bets with a bookie.  He is also meeting his best friend who is a Navy Commander Kevin Dunne (Gary Sinise).  Kevin is escorting the US Secretary of Defense to the fight.

During the fight the Secretary of Defense is killed and multiple shots ring out as the fight crowd all run for the exits.  Everyone had been distracted and Kevin who was out of position shoots the assassin dead. They have 14,000 spectators that are now potential witnesses to the crime....

This movie has a lot of potential but for me it starts off strangely with Nicolas Cage's acting just being over the top.  I also thought that the last ten minutes of the film where just peculiarly done.  It really looked like filler movie just put into the film to extend the ending and make the movie longer.

1004021,4,6305230226,"The theme is simple and some will say already seen over and over again. A new version of Big Brother. Micro spying cameras set in the concrete of buildings, millions of eyes that are seeing and transmitting and telling who knows who and no one wants to know though it would be better not to have these spying eyes.

What's different is the setting: in a boxing arena, one night when a fight is supposed to take place to which the Secretary of Defense will attend. The arena is part of a bigger complex with casino and hotel and quite a few other things of the same type. So we have crowds, crowded places, and dozens of miles of crowded corridors and dozens of illuminated floors. Brilliant.

Then the security is important for that aforesaid Secretary of Defense and yet the objective is to assassinate him because he is going to get rid of the financing for this spying system we have already mentioned. You can imagine there are plenty of people who are against it, in the industrial complex, in the military and in the military industrial complex. Yet there are some people inside the new system who see the danger and try to let the Secretary of Defense know.

And during that boxing fight the assassination is of course attempted and  a local honest, way of speaking, cop who believes in some fundamental principles and refuses violence as a means to solve any problem, will put his two bitts in the machine and the storm outside, close to a hurricane, will be the mirror image of the tempest inside the arena and gambling complex. You add to that what is always suspicious in such films, the long friendship between two people who happen to be in the two opposed camps and you have the recipe for a dense, rapid and thrilling action film.

The rest is only detail and you will have to get them by yourselves because I have forgotten them. Have a good adventure.

1004022,5,6305230226,"A fine suspense/drama concerns the story of a young police officer who, just wanting to live out his unethical, though perhaps eccentrically fun life, finds himself thrust suddenly onto national stage because of a complication during a televized championship boxing match in Atlantic City, NJ. Superbly done, in the Hitchcock vein, and though the latter is best known in this genre, Brian DePalma, the director, and part writer, for ""Snake Eyes"", can easily match the quality of the master, and really deserves to be better known (As witnessed by former movies ""Sisters"", 1973, and ""Body Double"", 1984.)  Additionally, an intelligently directed movie, nicely layered with symbolism. A story of morality and fidelity; one which we find ourselfes in everyday. Highly recommended.",1305417600,,777,5.421487603305785
1004045,5,6305230226,"Personally I think ""Snake Eyes"" is a superior film! Sorry that most just don't ""get"" De Palma. He doesn't make films for the Academy worshipping crowds. He makes actual works of art. De Palma doesn't make movies for critics either. Oh, sure, De Palma is 'flawed', but so are most, if not all, true artists. But, his 'flaws' mostly only show when he is working for major studio ""Hollywood"" films. But even then he is so far superior to anything general generic Hollywood can dish out, in my opinion. He is one of the last of a rare dying breed of filmmaker, in the same vein, style, and category of the likes of Godard, Felini, Antonioni, Lelouch, Kubrick, Hitchcock, Welles, Wilder, Bergman, and such. To truly ""get"" him and appreciate him, one must realize that his films go far beyond mere ""storytelling"" in the conventional sense, not making the typical plot-driven drivel, but visual feasts, that stun the senses, and tells stories visually, with his camera movement and style. And, ""Snake Eyes"" is one of those type of films, where the 'story' is in the camera movements, not necessarily the script.

Keeping in check with so many common themes that have run consistently throughout De Palma's career (the trouble with the double, betrayal, conspiracy, etc), De Palma wastes no time taking viewers inside his noirish conspiracy thriller set in Atlantic City during a hurricane. His opening shot flows for over 15 minutes, uninterrupted, introducing every character you need to know in that short time frame. He interweaves between TV point of view to the actual casino in record breaking time, and in breathtaking fashion.

Between the very first shot of the politician and his entourage, including two powerful characters in the film played by Gary Sinise as Kevin Dunne, a political figure played by John Heard, Nicolas Cage as Rick Santoro, perfectly cast as an over the top cop on the make, a sleazy news reporter (played by Kevin Dunn), a bookie that owes Santoro a dept (played by Louis Guzman), the boxer Lincoln Tyler (played by Stan Shaw), his promoter, and everybody else involved in the 'conspiracy', as well as everything you need to know about the story, whether seen or heard, are all shown to the viewer in that short time span.

And, De Palma employs so many terrific camera angles and devices and tricks, that the film should be kept in a film school vault and studied every year for the next couple of decades.

From a mysterious redheaded woman to a blonde who is revealed to be a brunette with a wig on (played by Carla Gugino), from following a bloody hundred dollar bill to a ruby red ring, De Palma sets us on the coarse, working from a great script by David Koep (who scripted ""Mission: Impossibe"" and ""Carlito's Way""), putting things right before your very eyes, and/or in your ears, just to have you questioning everything and everyone you see on screen.

And, the dark humor/irony is delicious! Especially when Rick receives a phone call from a show girl, saying she's his lucky number seven right as the assasination takes place.

The slogan ""Believe everything except your eyes"" was a perfect tag line for this 1998 classic psychological mystery, noirish conspiracy thriller from the Master of Suspense. Because, after the film is over, and you know the way the plot turned out, then go back and view it again, you see that De Palma shows everything you need to see in the first 15 minutes of the film, and it's all right in front of your very eyes!

And, be sure to watch this film all the way until you see the words ""The End"" pop up to know just how sinister this story really is. Hint: A ruby red ring in stone.?.?.

And, when De Palma returns his camera back outside the arena, and the storm is raging, thus is the build up to a very awesome climatic scene in what is already established as a VERY noirish story/film.

Awesome! I would rate it a LOT higher than just 5 stars if possible.
Brian De Palma really hit a solid homerun for his fans with this classic, exposing just how evil, ugly, and sinister the world of Atlantic City really is.
And, the song at the end of the film By Mercedes Brooks, called ""Sin City"" is awesome, and the lyrics recap the story of the film.

Definitely the best film Nicolas Cage has EVER been lucky enough to be cast in, and his best performance by far!
Highly recommended! Thank you.",1298505600,,4357,4.654096228868661
1004046,2,6305230226,"The first 50 minutes of this film is some of the best work De Palma has done. It is Kurasawa's RASHAMON meets Hitchcock. The different points-of-view are put together with hypnotic precision that I was glued to the screen. The last 30 minutes were an absolute rip-off. The ending is extremely anti-climatic and unbelievable. Cage on the boardwalk referred to how he got out of that tunnel filled with water. There was no such ending. Apparently there was a huge CGI set-piece to finish the film that the studio forced De Palma to remove it to that lame ending. Anything would have been better then the ending we got. Also De Palma's original cut had a higher sex and violence quotient that the studio forced him to delete a lot of scenes. One goes to a De Palma film for organic violence. Hopefully a director's cut might be released with the missing CGI climax and all the sex and violence put back in the film. I will be the first customer to buy the original censored version by De Palma's original cut. Studios don't tell Scorsese or Spielberg to delete the violence in films like THE DEPARTED or MUNICH.

However, I found this a very fast-moving, involving story with Nicholas Cage playing an extremely interesting person: ""Rick Santoro,"" a guy who acts like a complete crazy man at the beginning but slowly gets it together as the film goes on.

Gary Sinise plays his normal corrupt role. (This was before his good-guy CSI: New York days.) Brian DePalma directed this, so you know it's going to be stylishly shot, too, a bit sleazy. The film looks very good on DVD.

All the characters are interesting, actually. One complaint: the ending was a bit weak and detracts from the story. It's an edgy story and one that will keep your interest all he way.

It's the perfect fusion of layered exposition and sheer style.  You also get your money's worth from Nicholas Cage playing to the rafters as a slimeball cop in a bright yellow shirt.  The opening sequence ends with a political assassination, and clues to the killers' identity emerge in multiple flashbacks that cover the same situation from different angles.  It's a great gimmick, but unfortunately De Palma doesn't stick with it.  About midway through the conspiracy is unmasked, the flashbacks are abandoned, and ""Snake Eyes"" settles into a conventional thriller with Cage racing to save the life of a pretty young woman who Knows Too Much.  Like so many movies based around a great premise, the premise can't stretch to fill the whole running time.

1004053,3,6305230226,"Brian De Palma has always been one of my favorite directors; he has an extraordinary way to bring his ideas to screen. Like his other films he brings in the awesome camera angles that are of course his trademark. But here the angles seem useless, they are well brought out and at times a bit overused but definitely pointless.

The film story which is a bit far-fetched commences with a police detective attending a championship boxing match (played by Nicolas Cage). In the match we witness from many deferent angles an assassination during the match. The question now lies as to who is responsible for the assassination and why. Little by little we are revealed what happened and how it happened from many points of view. Now even though the angles and different views are quite enticing and boggles the mind a bit it all seems pointless. Why should you confuse the audience over and over again when we know in the first 15 minutes who is responsible for the assassination. And not to mention the ending which is so dumb and it cheats its way out. It feels like the writers had a great idea for a movie but just didn't know how to develop it or end it. The movie is entertaining and it's okay just don't expect a huge twist or surprise in the end because all you're goanna get is disappointment.

1004054,5,6305230226,"Brian DePalma wastes no time taking viewers inside his noirish conspiracy thriller set in Atlantic City during a hurricane. His opening shot flows for over 15 minutes, uninterupted, introducing every character you need to know in that short time frame. He interweaves between TV point of view to the actual casino in record breaking time, and in breathtaking fashion.
Nicolas Cage as Rick Santoro is so perfectly cast as an over the top cop on the make, that it's so easy from the very beginning of the film to forget it's only a movie.
Between the very first shot of the politician and his entourage, including two powerful characters in the film played by Gary Sinise as Kevin Dunne (a friend of Rick's), a political figure played by John Heard, the female newscaster, Rick Santoro, a sleazy news reporter (played by Kevin Dunn), a bookie that owes Santoro a dept (played by Louis Guzman), the boxer Lincoln Tyler (played by Stan Shaw), his promoter, and everybody else involved in the 'conspiracy', as well as everything you need to know about the story, whether seen or heard, are all shown to the viewer in that short time span.
After the assasination takes place and all h*ll breaks loose in the casino, we are then taken on a journey of trying to solve the crime in a very Agatha Christie/Karasowa's ""Rashomon"" style that is utterly breathtaking in every scene, every flasback, and every version of what you see or what you are told. Everyone's story is slightly different, so no one knows who is telling the truth until the end of the film.
And, DePalma employs so many terrific camera angles and devices and tricks, that the film should be kept in a film school vault and studied every year for the next couple of decades.
From a mysterious redheaded woman to a blonde who is revealed to be a brunette with a wig on (played by Carla Gugino), from following a bloody hundred dollar bill to a ruby red ring, DePalma sets us on the coarse, working from a great script by David Koep (who scripted ""Mission: Impossibe"" and ""Carlito's Way""), putting things right before your very eyes, and/or in your ears, just to have you questioning everything and everyone you see on screen.
And, the dark humor/irony is delicious! Especially when Rick recieves a phone call from a show girl, saying she's his lucky number seven right as the assasination takes place.
The slogan ""Believe everything except your eyes"" was a perfect tag line for this 1998 classic psychological mystery, noirish conspiracy thriller from the Master of Suspense. Because, after the film is over, and you know the way the plot turned out, then go back and view it again, you see that DePalma shows everything you need to see in the first 15 minutes of the film, and it's all right in front of your very eyes!
And, be sure to watch this film all the way until you see the words ""The End"" pop up to know just how sinister this story really is. Hint: A ruby red ring in stone.?.?.
And, when DePalma returns his camera back outside the arena, and the storm is raging, thus is the build up to a very awesome climatic scene in what is already established as a VERY noirish story/film.
Awesome! I would rate it a LOT higher than just 5 stars if possible.
Brian DePalma really hit a solid homerun for his fans with this classic, exposing just how evil, ugly, and sinister the world of Atlantic City really is.
And, the song at the end of the film By Mercedes Brooks, called ""Sin City"" is awesome, and the lyrics recap the story of the film.
Definetly the best film Nicolas Cage has EVER been lucky enough to be cast in, and his best performance by far!
Highly recommended! Thank you.",1181779200,3,3643,4.597542242703533

1004089,4,6305230226,"Snake Eyes is a great thriller in so many ways.  The story is genuinely interesting.  The characters are easy to love or hate.  The pacing is fast and keeps you interested.  The director puts all of his greatest trademarks into full effect.  The only problem with the movie is the ending.  No matter how much I love the first hour and 15 minutes of the film, that climactic showdown really hurts the movies overall credibility.  However, I try not to judge an entire film based on 15 minutes that I didn't really like, so I am still a huge fan of Snake Eyes.

Snake Eyes' story revolves around Rick Santoro, an Atlantic City police officer who is a corrupt, mean, uncaring individual.  We are introduced to Rick at a big boxing match taking place at a casino in Atlantic City during a hurricane no less.  The film's opening shot is simply amazing, and it shows why I love Brian De Palma so much as a director.  The opening shot is one of his classic ""long-takes.""  It lasts for about 15 minutes with no cuts, and it introduces us to Cage, his friend Kevin (Gary Sinise), and takes us all over the boxing arena.  It is simply an amazing shot, and it could only have been done with a great actor like Nicolas Cage, who keeps his character alive, vibrant, and funny throughout the entire shot.  Just totally amazing stuff.  Anyway, the plot then gets really complicated, as an assassination takes place during the fight, and Cage starts his investigation into the events of the night.  This is also why this movie fits De Palma so well.  He is the best director that I know of when it comes to telling a single story from multiple, different points of view.  The flashbacks in Snake Eyes are very well done, and only help to move the story along quicker, as the viewer gets more and more interested in what actually happened during the fight.

Sure, the ending could have been better, but I refuse to let it ruin the great moments of the film all the way up until that last 15 minutes.  Oh, and make sure you fast forward through the credits for the one final shot of the film.",1157068800,2,2074,4.422163588390501
1004090,4,6305230226,"Brian DePalma's ""Snake Eyes"" is an original and complicated crime film that requires much attention and patience from the viewer. The movie is only 90 minutes, but occasionally feels longer than that and the final payoff isn't what you'd expect; but, overall, it's not to bad. Nicolas Cage owns the movie, however, as Rick Santoro, a flamboyant detective who's attending a boxing match in Atlantic City when the U.S. Secretary of Defense is gunned down right behind him. Instead of opting for a typical ""crime happens, crime is solved"" formula, DePalma does the perspective thing. We see the crime and then we see it from several other perspectives; when the pieces click in, the mystery is solved and now it just has to be dealt with. As far as twists and surprises, this movie doesn't have a lot to offer...But it is pretty interesting. Anyway, Santoro (who happens to be a crooked cop) is now head of a murder investigation with 14,000 eyewitnesses; So, the arena the fight is at, is closed down while Santoro searches for the people involved. Among the many suspects are one of the fighters, a mysterious woman in white (Carla Gugino, 'Sin City'), and Santoro's best friend (Gary Sinise); A high ranking officer. Believe me, this is a complicated movie. But, it's also got some very interesting dialogue and a hilariously over-the-top performance by Nicolas Cage. DePalma's directing is as good as it's ever been here (and yes, I know this movie came out in '98). I'd like to say that it's a great and very entertaining film, because it's definitely inventive...But, it's not. It's entertaining, for sure, but there are times where you wish it would just cut to the chase.

Nicolas Cage stars as Rick Santoro, the aforementioned cop, who happens to be at a prizefight in the Atlantic City arena when the Secretary of Defense is assassinated.  The conspiracy plot is easily identified, and the main culprit's identity is no real surprise.

Brian DePalma, who has helmed such interesting films as BLOW UP, BODY DOUBLE and DRESSED TO KILL, uses his patented camera style to establish some splendid scenes, and his use of different points of view is likewise compelling.  However, with such a weak and sometimes incoherent plot, all the visuals do is reinforce how empty the rest of the film is.  Gary Sinise is his usual professional self; Carla Gugino is an attractive damsel in distress, and it's nice to see Stan Shaw in a sizeable role.  Cage is hopelessly melodramatic at times, but does well in some of his quieter scenes.  Not one of DePalma's best, but good for a rental.",1101686400,5,1190,4.770731707317073

1004096,3,6305230226,"This movie was so pointless and ordinary that I finished watching it just fifteen minutes ago, and I've already begun to forget its plot.  Frankly, I was expecting much more from this movie.  I figured that when you have a great director, an Academy Award winner, and an Academy Award nominee working together on a movie, it might be worth watching.  For this particular movie, I was wrong.
This movie takes place in Atlantic City, where there is a big boxing match at which the Secretary of Defense of the United States is in attendance.  He's assassinated as the match commences, and at first this murder seems like a textbook case of a political fanatic who kills a politician in order to raise awareness about his cause, but soon the plot thickens.  Nicholas Cage plays the detective in charge of uncovering this plot, and Gary Sinise is his friend and fellow law enforcement official who is really the brains behind the assassination.  The rest of the movie involves some hackneyed cat and mouse scenes, but nothing incredibly memorable.
There are two very talented actors in this movie, and they weren't able to display their talents here.  This type of movie is really too simplistic for actors of this caliber.  The truth is that you'll be entertained for the duration of the movie, but if you're looking for something that's Oscar worthy, this isn't it.",1041984000,3,1362,4.7905982905982905

The conspiracy cover-up (""hush, hush, wink, wink) story isn't that good, but the pairing of Nicholas Cage and Gary Sinise helps the film's credibility. Especially Cage, who does the Castor Troy eccentic weirdo shtick from FACE OFF. And extra kudos goes for not doing the tired Hollywood ending, but going for a more downbeat finale.

1004138,3,6305230226,"Brian De Palma is one of our most visual directors. In fact, he's obsessed by vision. He believes that the truth of what we see is always a combination of several people's observations. One individual either doesn't see all of an event, or his mind plays tricks on him. He showed this to us in a taunt thriller called Blow Out in the 1980s. In Snake Eyes he returns to the subject.
Nicholas Cage plays Detective Ricky Santoro, a likable but corrupt Atlantic City cop. He appears to think that being on the take is just part of the job. Otherwise, he is a pretty decent guy. He has his loyalties and his limits.
Most of the movie takes place inside a large old arena on the Boardwalk during a hurricane. A major boxing match is taking place, the last event before the arena is torn down. Ricky is there at the invitation of his old friend Kevin [Gary Sinise], a Naval officer there to protect one of the patrons, the Secretary of Defense.
The fight begins. Various characters appear, while others disappear for a while. Then shots ring out. The Secretary is shot, and a mysterious woman talking to him is wounded. She gets out of the auditorium during the ensuing melee, but the exits are sealed before she can escape.
This attempted assassination takes place very quickly, and now Ricky must try to piece together the event through various eyewitnesses. Who was where and when? Who is telling the truth? This takes up much of the movie, and when the truth comes out, it turns into a suspenseful cat and mouse game. The result is a fairly good movie.
De Palma uses many of his trademark shots, which involve complex camera moves. The best is one which begins in a hotel hallway, then moves up and travels over several of the hotel's rooms, as we look down into them, like flying peeping toms.
There is a lot of talent here. Nicholas Cage won an Oscar for Best Actor in 1996, and has parlayed that into four hit movies in three years. Gary Sinise is not only an Oscar winner, but also received an Emmy for his portrayal of Harry S. Truman. In Snake Eyes they give fine performances, but the material is a piece of cake for them.
...While certainly an entertaining effort, Snake Eyes suggests that currently the director excels in projects which he did not conceive. ...",1017187200,2,2267,4.518248175182482
1004139,1,6305230226,"Obviously an endangered plot convicted and deceived by a fabulous director such as Brian De Palma (Mission: Impossible, Carrie), an experimentally creative and enjoyable writer like David Koepp (Jurassic Park), and two superior actors that could easily make the top ""20"" best actors of the 20th Century List (Nicolas Cage, Gary Sinise), would be quite a pull-off for Hollywood these days.  This film takes a slick beginning featuring Cage in some of the longest film shots ever created (thankfully De Palma's work).  Cage is there the whole time, taking his collective and explotive character to a snoopy and dog driven edge which will raise a thought- ""Is he a pain in the neck that won't go away?, or, Is he just a very easily-ammused, outgoing being who's climax and philosophies of life revolve around the world's attentivness towards him?""  However, the traditional bad boy cop character starts kicking in when he starts flerting with a white-blonded female who happens to sit right next to him (taking his best friend's seat).  And may I add that his flertation begins right after finishing a conversation with his wife, whom he is apparently ""happily"" married to.  His excuse is that he cannot seem to bare sleeping with the same woman for twenty years.  Does it sound happy to you?
Then, following is a serious assassination involving the killing of the Secretary of Defense at this Boxing Match in which there are numerous suspects and possibilites.  De Palma sets it up so strategically and annoyingly blaze, that the audience can't seem to follow.  There are many stories through the several different characters Cage interacts with to get his investigative story.  However, a few of the stories don't seem to cope with reality.  Cage pieces it together in a way we don't seem to understand, which makes us wonder if he really solved anything at all, or is just leaving us to believe that somehow the film has such a confusing conclusion to the madness, that an everyday audience wouldn't be able to understand easily.  Then, maybe we're just supposed to accept that theory and pretend that this movie is very intelligent, with a mind-bending craft even Einstein couldn't comprehend in two-hundred years.  The film is such a disastrous jigsaw puzzle that seems to lead us in a direction where we can finally say ""OK, I get it now"", but then it totally dismantles it all, creating more lies and scandals for us to realize, until we are sucked into the ruthless truth of who is really truthful and an ally to Cage, and who is not.  Seriously, Cage's character seems more of a villain as well.  One scene following the assassination pits him (AS A COP) telling his best friend (Sinise), who is the Secretary of Defense's bodyguard to lie to the other agents and officers to prevent his deserved imprisonment.  We think we understand that Sinise's hormones detured him from being at his post with the Secretary of Defense by scoping out a red headed beauty queen, and then we are lured into the backdoors of plot working in which we might as well give up and surrender to its actual stupidity.  It completely sets a point to make the audience disturbed with its constant character and story manipulations.  By the time we are introduced to the actual ""real"" bad guy scenario, we don't even care.  So many people could actually guess who the villain(s) turned out to be.  The ending is more of a relief than an actual ending.  So many good performances, so many interesting techniques, but so little excitment and creativity, and no sense of reality.  Snake Eyes is more of a blood bath mystery with no desire to entertain, but to rather convince its audience that it is more mature than any other plausible film to date.  Don't be shocked when you realize that the film ends after 100 minutes, and you realize that if there weren't so many scandelous scenes and obscure plot tugs that rip you in the wrong direction the whole way through, the film could've ended with a beginning that delivers, and a simple ending in which we could easily understand.
QUOTE: ""Snake Eyes is a maze of annoyance, and simply that.  It tries to be smarter than the audience, with emphasis on TRIES.  The manuevers it plays with don't entertain, but simply create more plot problems than thought possible.  This film is like a ""snake"", slithering in so many directions that we can't keep up with its abnormality and constant shifts of the underminded.  Maybe that was the original visualization from De Palma's mind, but doesn't it seem he might have explored the imagination a little bit much?  My point is- if this would've been De Palma's last film, would he have been proud of it, or ashamed?  I think the answer is obvious.""",1012003200,,4715,4.787654320987654

I find this movie enjoyable because the camera work is superb, the plot keeps you interested, and Cage plays his role as a weak, corrupted cop very well.

1004144,2,6305230226,"I saw ""Snake Eyes"" in the theaters a few ago because I am somewhat of a fan of Brian DePalma.  Unfortunately, this movie is one of DePalma's worst.
The United States Secretary of Defense is assassinated at a major boxing match and corrupt cop Nicholas Cage later uncovers the conspiracy.
""Snake Eyes"" is one of DePalma's worst movies.  The film has one of the worst time-credibility problems that I have ever seen in a movie.  The viewer witnesses the opening of the film, the introduction of the major characters, the assassination sequence, and Cage's lone unraveling of the mystery.  All of these events take place over a period of time less than twenty-four hours.  I couldn't believe that all of these events could take place in such a short period of time and that one lone corrupt cop could uncover an intricate conspiracy so quickly.  In ""Blow Out,"" another Brian DePalma film which also focused on a political assassination, movie soundman John Travolta uncovers a similar conspiracy over several weeks(A much more credible period of time).  The post-climax extension of the story involving Cage's law enforcement career seemed as if it were added on at the last minute and was completely unnecessary.  The viewer doesn't develop any real concern for DePalma's characters in this movie. Cage's sudden transition from cop-on-the-take to do-gooder was also unconvincing.
Something happened to Brian DePalma after the 1970s.  After his masterpiece ""Dressed To Kill,""  DePalma has failed to make one genuinely good thriller.  Only ""Blow Out"" and ""The Untouchables"" come close to his original work.  Since ""Dressed To Kill,"" DePalma has largely wandered through forgettable thrillers(""Body Double,"" ""Raising Cain""), plastic Hollywood blockbusters(""Mission: Impossible""), and outright disasters(""Bonfire of the Vanities"").  Perhaps DePalma will make a comeback one day.

1004145,3,6305230226,"Brian De Palma has been known to make a weak script very strong with his daring Hitchcockian inspired visuals and camera angles. This story on the surface is a blatant rip-off of Akira Kurosawa's much more brilliant ""Rashomon"".
A story of a corrupt cop at a boxing match where a senior govt official is assasinated, this has so many loose ends in the last half that it made me shudder. The start and early half of the movie was spectacular and it showed so much promise but in the mediocre middle, something starts to go terribly wrong when the characterization lingers on one character too much.
If this is supposed to be a modern day rip off of ""Rashomon"" then people should have been careful not to just put in some elements, but all. one little whisk does not make a proper broth.
Don't get me wrong,I love my film directors and Mr. De Palma is up there with the much better ""Mission Impossible"" but this one just fails ticking.

1004186,4,6305230226,"Snake Eyes is a better movie than some have concluded; noteworthy is how in the first half of the movie it shows you the view points of the witnesses which is how it is in real life when trying to construct what rreally happened in a complex event. DePalma employs some OUTSTANDING camera work; particularly the camera view replicating from the prize fighter's eyes that then turns into the mirror and you see the fighter, shadow boxing, and the scene in the upper hotel rooms where the camera looks down and glides over several adjacent rooms to show how people really behave behind closed doors. On a tactical note when the Gary Sinese character shoots THROUGH the adjacent material to hit the alleged assasin that is very well done since in real gunfights you shoot through to the enemy (if your bullets will penetrate) not waltz into a line-of-sight like a Hollywood gunfight. The movie's failure is that it revealed that Gary Sinese's character is the mastermind/villain in the movie middle, the film should have lead us to believe he was a good guy longer, until the near end, have the betrayal and beating of the Nicholas Cage character. The rationale behind Sinese's character that he was fed up that the Navy didn't have an effective close-range missile defense system rings true, but I doubt such a person would resort to evil to get a good result, but the servicemen's frustration was well portrayed. The girl's desire to not waste billions on a defense system that can't work makes both viewpoints very timely in light of recent current events. These revelations should have come as a shock just at the end as DePalma did in Body Double. Then have the weak, bleeding and battered Cage returns to the girl in hiding and get at the truth just as Sinese arrives to finish them both off.
Here is where DePalma succeeds with the Hitchcock ethos of suspense; a weakened hero, a tainted hero, in over his head, forces all around him converging to destroy him...dragging himself nevertheless to rescue the girl, a marvelous scene. The ending would have been better if the two had made a run for it, the girl shot and Cage and Sinese scuffling and then Sinese pumping bullets into Cage who refuses to die as but he fails to reach the FBI agents in the auditoreum Sinese runs out of bullets, and Cage makes it. The FBI agents turn on Sinese and open fire when he refuses to drop his silencer-equipped gun (not a virtuous law enforcement lay-out). Have Cage in the hospital on life support for days waking up, with a hand holding his---the girl played elegantly by Carla Gugino who demurs when his wife/son enter to greet him.
Baring a better ending to the danger, I like how the film showed how Cage was a hero for a brief time until his past caught up with him and we as we are fond to do in America decided to knock our icon off its pedestal. There is perhaps truth to the idea that good people who get caught up in a bad web of circumstances just need a fresh start to reshape their lives. Show Cage in prison in despair, his life shattered, and then have him visited by Carla Gugino who says she'll wait for him, have him roll the dice and get two sixes; ""No more snake eyes"".",974851200,12,3182,4.535652173913044

1004188,1,6305230226,"Snake Eyes is a film that begins in such a grand fashion that it's almost unbearable to watch how bad it ends.  It's a film that reaches it's climax  way too early, and then relies on camera tricks and nifty angles to sustain  the viewer's interest.
Rick Santoro (Nicolas Cage) is taking a vacation,  watching a boxing match in Atlantic City with his best friend, Commander  Kevin Dunne (Gary Sinise).  However, not long into the fight, a the  secretary of defense is shot and the entire arena is closed off, sealing in  14,000 people.  Santoro takes charge of the investigation but heads closer  to a truth that he doesn't want to face.
With a plot like that you would  expect some interesting twists.  Well, there's none at all, which is a  surprise in itself since De Palma helmed the superior erotic thrillers  Dressed to Kill and Body Double (the latter of which featured three  unpredictable plot twists).  De Palma doesn't even try to conceal the  villain's identitiy, which is revealed halfway through the film (and isn't  the least bit surprising, either).
Well, you might wonder if it has any  action sequences or anything of the sort.  The answer is not really.  This  is a film in which you can actually keep count of all the gunshots fired.  The film certainly could have used a lot more adrenaline-pumping moments.  There's one barely decent suspense sequence that uses some interesting  camera angles, making each room in a hotel look intertwined, at least from  a top view.  Actually, now that I think of it, that's really the only  film's suspense sequence,  or at least the only one that's not artificial  in its payoff.
I can't really say much for the acting.  Nicolas Cage can  be fun, and he almost pulls it off here, but his character change is so  sudden that it could put a viewer off-guard and that's not a good thing.  Gary Sinise fares better with his less overdone performance and keeps a  consistent tone.  As with the recent Reindeer Games (a thriller far better  than this one), Sinise in danger of being typecast in these sort of roles  so he'd best be careful.  He's far too excellent an actor to spend his time  playing these sort of characters.
For a while, the film has some things  going for it.  There are some dazzling camera angles and the employment of  the different point-of-view stories reminisces of Akira Kurosawa's  Rashomon, but there's too much off track in the film and the conclusion is  absolutely horrendous, turning what might have been a fairly bad movie into  an awful mess.",965865600,,2530,4.6995412844036695

An  amazing story with several plot twists, Snake Eyes centers around the same  event from several character's point of views, a task in which only De  Palma could have pulled off.  Snake Eyes is clearly De Palma at his  directing best.  If you want to see a first rate thriller with all of De  Palma's original directing beauty, see Snake Eyes.",965520000,2,637,4.539823008849558
1004190,4,6305230226,"Maybe the plot has been used, but if it is well played out (as in this  movie) it has permission to be reuesd.  I haven't seen an action mystery  before, so I found it enjoyable.  The camerawork was VERY good, and the  style of presentation was also very good.
  People have been trashing  the ending, and it has been said that it was bad, far-fetched, predictable,  etc.  Well, I did find it predictable, but that did not spoil it for me.  I  didn't even notice the criticism until people brought it up.  This movie  seems to play on your emotion and your eyes.  Anyone can take it apart and  compare the plot or criticize the ending, but great actors like Cage and  Sinise give it emotion.  To really enjoy this movie, don't analyze the  movie making (""oh, I've seen stuff like this before, it's him, the  movie is pointless now""), put yourself in the characters shoes and  really ride with it.  As the back cover says, the movie is really about  ""the shocking truth that Santoro doesn't want to believe"".
  My point:  If you are a movie analyzer watching the movie from the outside,  seeking to take apart the plot and the directing and whatever.  This won't  produce the satisfaction that you are looking for, and you probably won't  like it.  If you are the type that gets with the characters, feels their  emotion with them, and basically watches the movie from the inside, you  will love it like I did.  I give this movie four stars for a great ride  from the inside, but in all fairness a predictable and perhaps far-fetched  (not by any means bad) ending* cost it a star.

1004191,1,6305230226,The only good point about this movie is Cage's excellent performance. Almost everything else is under average. The movie repeats some familiar twists of a generic thriller/murder mystery without any ingeniuty. I would  say that I could figure out the whole story from the first 20 minutes.  Everything after that was mere filling the gaps. I felt disappointed with  this movie in general.,964224000,,388,5.126984126984127
1004192,5,6305230226,"I think Brian DePalma is very underrated, I think that most of his films are very good, and he has a very good eye. Using great camera angles, a good plot, this movie delivers everything you want in a film. I especially like DePalmas trademark of using a split screen to tell the story (as he  did in Carrie). Nicholas Cage is a very talented actor playing a crooked  cop that is caught in a trap after a senator is assassinated by a foriegn  terrorist hired by Powell aircraft to kill a traitor in the company who was  to blow the cover of a faulty missles system to be approved by the senator.  I very good plot, and I don't think that people should criticise a movie for  being unbelievable, well what is it people? Does it lack plot? Is too  complicated for fragile minds? And now I heard that it is too unbelievable?  Does this make a movie a bad one? It's just a movie! Snake Eyes is rated R  but should be rated PG-13 due to mild language, no nudity, some violence,  and adult situations. I guess thats why the MPAA took such a long time to  rate this movie. I Highly Recommend this one along with watching  Mission:Impossible (dont see MI:2 it's a waste of time and money, the first  one is way better).",961977600,2,1211,4.28193832599119
1004193,3,6305230226,"Snake Eyes has a terrific idea which is to have a murder at a live boxing  match in Atlantic Cit. The arena is the crime scene and the movie never  leaves the building. All this is excellent. The one night idea works well  and so does the giant storm outside, but these are all minor details. The  story is about a conspiracy and it's good up until we meet the villain who  is presented as merely a cliche with unrealistic and often ridiculous  looking scowls. There are a lot of things going for this film including  Cage playing the hero who is also a corrupt cop (flawed heroes are more  interesting than perfect ones), and some amazing directing techniques by  Brian DePalma. Ultimately these things don't matter because the story is a  giant letdown in the most important act, the ending.

But in the end you're looking at something utterly  forgettable. Every time some real suspense is built up, the rather poor  music or an off-key performance spoils it.

The  two biggest problems were that the villian was revealed too early and the  climax was horrible. What made this movie intriguing and suspenseful was  wondering who the villian was, and once that was given away, the movie  began to turn into a run-of-the-mill action flick. If we were left  wondering until the final scene, it would of kept me more interested. The  second problem was that the final scene was completely ridiculous.

I'd avoided ""Snake Eyes"" for 20 years (didn't like the title, didn't like the cast, had hated the director's previous works in the 1990s), yet purely by chance, or impurely by Prime, I finally watched this movie one night in 2018 -- a full 2 decades after its theatrical release -- only to be reminded how viscerally powerful De Palma films can be. Visually, it's great, but the surprise here is in De Palma's mastery of sound effects. The story takes place during a hurricane, and the soundtrack swooshes with constant rain and heavy gales of wind lashing around as a tale of murder and double crosses unfolds. De Palma takes the conventions of Old Dark House movies and transplants them to the brightly lit, larger-than-life vulgarity of a Vegas boxing match. Sounds awful, right? Sounds like there's no way in a million years the conceit/gambit could possibly work? And yet, it does. Nicolas Cage, after years of lousy performances, did some of his most incisive character work since ""Moonstruck."" Yes, when the explanation scenes finally come, they are not quite believable.
