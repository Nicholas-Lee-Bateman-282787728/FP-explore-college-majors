8325122,4,B000GB5MOC,"This is a Dialectical Behavior Therapy DVD which appears to be intended for viewing by the person suffering, likely with therapist present. The purpose of the video is to help the viewer learn how to tolerate a crisis/emotional storm until it passes, to reduce the related emotional dysregulation. The video is useful, clearly presented (by Marsha Linehan, the developer of DBT), and intended for those who tend to make their lives even worse when under stress. The DVD is simple and concrete, apparently so that those in immediate, powerful distress can readily concentrate enough to respond to the specific content. Consider also the workbook on DBT for adults by Matthew McKay",1368748800,4,679,5.126126126126126
