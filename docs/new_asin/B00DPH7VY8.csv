8595944,5,B00DPH7VY8,"This item arrived on time and was perfect. I was skeptical if it was the legitimate Tales From the Cryptkeeper cartoon show due to the odd packaging art on the front of the case. Luckily it was exactly what I was expecting the original season one cartoon. Everything about it was perfect, and my girlfriend I have already watched it over four times. It brought back so many childhood memories for us. I would love it if they would release all of season two next I will be on the lookout for that.",1425340800,,496,4.344086021505376
8595945,1,B00DPH7VY8,"Tales From the Cryptkeeper: Myth Conceptions DVD is not Tales From the Cryptkeeper The Complete 3rd Season like some places on the internet say that it is!

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_from_the_Cryptkeeper#DVD_releases

This DVD is a re-issue of some of the episodes from Tales from the Cryptkeeper: The Complete 2nd Season All the Gory Details.

UPDATE: For those of you looking for the 3rd and final season of this show, Amazon Instant Video has the 3rd season, on Amazon Instant Video Season 3 is called Season 2 and on iTunes Season 3 is Season 3.

 It looks as if these are the only ways to get season 3.",1421452800,,616,4.884615384615385

8595947,4,B00DPH7VY8,"This disk entitled Myth Conceptions has 6 episodes of season 2. episodes 1-6 in random order. The other re-issued disk named Transylvania Express has episodes 7-13 in random order.

So if you buy both disks you will have the complete second season to go along with the re-issue of the complete firs season.",1379376000,,306,4.773584905660377
8595948,3,B00DPH7VY8,"Greetings;

Well, I found this in a $5 bin at walmart the other day and wondered to myself, having been aware of the animated series back in the day, if, this set is as it sounds like on its back cover, perhaps a new series of some sort. Perhaps it would even have been the remaining season 3 perhaps, but unfortunatly, no. It really isn't. What this is in fact, is one episode short of being exactly half of season 2. The episodes are not in any particular order, but looking at the series as a whole, seasons 1-3, this set includes episodes:

14. Game Over (September 10, 1994) - Two boys pay for skipping school to play video games when the characters come to life.

15. Cold Blood, Warm Hearts/The Spider and the Flies (September 17, 1994) - The Cryptkeeper and the Old Witch meet at the beach to swap stories: in ""Cold Blood, Warm Heart"", a man and a woman find that they have a lot in common while investigating rumors of a monster dwelling in a lake; in ""The Spider and the Flies"", when spiders infest their town, two siblings find out that a mysterious exterminator is not what he seems to be.

16. The Avenging Phantom/Myth Conceptions (September 24, 1994) - In ""The Avenging Phantom,"" a young boy named Jimmy wishes he can get revenge on his tormentors like his comic book hero, ""The Avenging Phantom,"" and gets his wish, but with dire consequences. In ""Myth Conceptions"", an archaeologist discovers the tomb of Medusa and learns the hard way why others before him have died trying to find it.

17. All the Gory Details (October 1, 1994) - A pair of newspaper reporters try to track down an old mad scientist.

18. The Weeping Woman (October 8, 1994) - Camille and Mildred from ""Fare Tonight"" return, this time, to investigate the sightings of a woman's ghost who haunts a local inn.

19. Dead Men Don't Jump (October 15, 1994) - The Witch, The Cryptkeeper, and The Vaultkeeper return to tell the tale of a boy who challenges a monster to a basketball game that could mean the end of his life if he loses.

And actually runs from 17 to 19 to 18 to 16 to 15 to 14(If I am remembering it correctly anyways). Thats about it. No other features that I could see. No commentary that I noticed though I honestly wasn't looking. Just play the episodes or jump to a scene. I know that there was also released along side this disc, another set titled Transylvania express, which you can probably find easily enough from amazon't page on this title, but I have no idea as to what all is included in it yet, though I do know that transylvania express was the title of one of if not the last episode of season 2. Just as Myth Conception was one episode title that was also included in this set.

So if you buy both sets, will that make up an entire season 2 run? Not from the looks of it sadly, so really, you would probably be better served just getting season 2 itself, though I suppose this is a nice enough sample pack. The artwork is in no way indicative of what you get in the series though, was slightly misleading, thought that maybe this really would have had new material, perhaps some poorly done CG episodes along side of normal animation, or again, previously unreleased episodes from season 3. No such luck at all(you can only get 3 episodes from season 3 on dvd from a title called 'Stacks of Fear.'

Thank you...",1379030400,10,3325,4.4094616639477975
