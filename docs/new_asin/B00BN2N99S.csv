I saw the marionettes ""live"" in Salzburg when I was just 15. They did Mozart's The Magic Flute, and I loved it! Just as they did then, the Salzburg Marionettes brought magic to life. My father made travelogues, and I held the lights while he filmed them rehearsing for Mozart's Don Giovanni, and the repetition necessary to perfect one slight movement was just mind-blowing. So after nearly 50 years, I was thrilled to be able to see this DVD of the marionettes I so loved as a teen. I knew this would far more demanding than the operas I'd seen them perform, but they certainly didn't disappoint!",1421625600,2,854,4.588235294117647
