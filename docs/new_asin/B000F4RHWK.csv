8117331,4,B000F4RHWK,"I purchased this movie to see Joe Lando's acting ability in his youth. I knew it was a made for TV movie, so my expectations were not very high. But I have to admit that the movie was pretty good and there were some very intense scenes. Mr. Lando's persona was consistent with his character and I definitely think he held his own, especially with Piper Laurie (who I have enjoyed for many years), and out acted Nicole Sheridan.

I have watched it more than once and am happy with my purchase.",1370390400,3,492,4.3478260869565215

8117335,5,B000F4RHWK,"I'd forgotten how much I enjoyed this 1994 TV movie.  Jude Snow (Adrian Pasdar) is the nice younger brother who stayed home to run the family store in a small town.  Sonny Snow (Joe Lando) is the older bad brother who comes home and destroys everything his brother and mother (Piper Laurie) love.  And then there is Rowena Ecklund (Nicolette Sheridan), the woman that comes between the brothers.  Pasdar is so sweet and endearing as the brother who wishes his mother would notice and love him as much as she does Sonny.  And Joe Lando is just plain naughty - lying, smoking, drinking, stealing from the family store and sleeping with his brother's girl every chance he gets. Sonny and Rowena have a past connection that Jude knows nothing about. Things come to a head when Sonny's financial past catches up with him and Jude finds out about Sonny and Rowena.  Predictable, but still fun to watch.

I have to admit the best part about this movie was the incredible score by Mark Snow (X-Files fame.)  I just wish the score was on CD.",1168128000,23,1032,4.570652173913044
