The title is misleading. This ""thing"" is not about the Trans-Siberian express. It's barely about Russia at all. It's about Paulo Coelho hamming in front of the camera for most of the ""thing"". Why am I calling it a thing? Because it doesn't deserve to be called a movie, a film, or a documentary. It's approximately on the level of some amateur YouTube project by a high school kid. Furthermore, the title is in English and there isn't much English in it.

There are actually a couple clips taken on the train: mostly of Coelho's odd tuft of hair on the back of his head as he walks through the train. Occasionally we're treated to an extended clip of the steam rising from his tea or of him staring dreamily out a window for what seems like forever to the background of some odd non-Russian music.

The cover also calls us to ""Enjoy a Magical Journey."" The only thing magical here was the power to put me to sleep despite the early hour, without the aid of drugs or alcohol. The only journey was the endless, pointless meanderings of the cameraman from one irrelevant thing to another. If you drove from Maine to Florida, then to California, up to Alaska, and then back across to Maine and took a couple video clips of a stream, a few trees, a train station, and a dining car, would you call those few pictures a ""magical journey""? That's basically what we get in this drivel.

Most of the video is closeup shots (too close) of Coelho's mottled face, while he prattles on in Portuguese about barely related philosophical musings. Sometimes there's a Russian translator with him, which helps me, because I understand Russian, but if you don't, you'll find this ""thing"" profoundly annoying (as did my wife, daughter, and brother-in-law). A good half of the time, there is no English.

Save your money. You'll learn more about Russia and the Trans-Siberian Railway by taking the nap this will force you to take.",1357776000,2,1927,4.606413994169096
