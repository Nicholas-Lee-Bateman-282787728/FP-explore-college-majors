8213014,2,B000UDNNS8,"It only 5 minutes story. The story shows how to feed their babies and how they fly, with the beautiful music in the background. The DVD cover is good but the DVD media is very poor. (It looks like used when I got it)",1210032000,3,216,3.9318181818181817

8213016,5,B000UDNNS8,"I treasure this film that chronicles charming and heartwarming interactions between momma and baby hummers.  The choice of music is quite fitting and humorous at times, which made me laugh whenever ""The U.S. Air Force Song"" kicked in.  It is a lovely film, and my whole family loved it!",1203292800,5,286,4.816326530612245
8213017,3,B000UDNNS8,Video did not live up to my expectations.  Photography good but it only showed similar views of the hummingbird nest with chicks. Progressed from small chicks until they fledged and left the nest. Content was repetitive.  Music did not live up my expectations.,1202515200,3,260,5.023255813953488
8213018,4,B000UDNNS8,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my grandmother.  She loves hummingbirds, and she very much enjoyed this DVD.  She thought it was a little short, but she also said it was very cute and extremely enjoyable!  I highly recommend this for the bird lover in your family!",1199577600,2,270,4.469387755102041
8213019,5,B000UDNNS8,"This delightful video with wonderfully appropriate music would appeal to hummingbird fans, nature lovers, those looking for a relaxing and non-violent experience, and children of all ages. The extremely rare footage of two baby hummingbirds growing to maturity under their mother's care, is charming and captivating. Highly recommended.",1197590400,3,336,6.020833333333333
8213020,5,B000UDNNS8,"I am not sure how the filmmaker did it, but the steady and clear footage of these two baby hummingbirds as they mature is extraordinary! The babies are chronicled as they grow in their nest with momma bird steadfastly returning for their feedings. Ultimately they take their first flight flying away on the wings of maturity. Combine this with some wonderfully chosen music and you have the makings of a touching, educational AND relaxing video. I highly recommend this to nature lovers in general and hummingbird lovers in particular!!!",1192838400,7,537,5.044943820224719
8213021,5,B000UDNNS8,"My husband and I are hummingbird fanatics (six feeders in our yard.)  This DVD has amazing close-up video of baby hummers and mom in nest, as well as terrific feeding scenes. You can really see the distinct personalities of the birds.  This was a great addition to our hummingbird video collection. (Plus, good use of music.)",1192838400,6,325,4.785714285714286
