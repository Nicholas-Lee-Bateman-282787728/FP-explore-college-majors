8390361,5,B0037718RC,"I am an avid fan of the Food Network and of all of Giada's shows, books, website and eMagazine. I love watching her in her home and entertain her guests at home. Most of her recipes are pretty easy to follow, though some do require ingredients that may not be available at everyone's grocer. I live in a city that is a foodie town so I can almost always find what I need. I have used her recipes many times for bake sales, various parties and just everyday meals.

I have the next 2 seasons and waiting on the next one.",1401926400,,519,4.138613861386139
8390362,5,B0037718RC,"This is teaching me so much. I don't know what it is about Cordon Bleu grads that make them good teachers, but for some reason a lot of them end up that way, and like Julia Child, Giada knows how to make what seems complicated really simple but effective. I've tried her way of preparing lobster tails by cutting them up the back, which worked perfectly, and I'm looking forward to experimenting more. Only one major caveat: Just as with Julia, it may be dicey to watch Giada late at night. Her shows will make viewers want to nibble.",1389139200,,534,4.404040404040404
8390363,5,B0037718RC,"My wife collects recipes from the internet and she likes to watch the Food Network.
Giada makes it look easy to cook and my wife can pause the show while writing down the ingrediants.",1365379200,,183,4.411764705882353
