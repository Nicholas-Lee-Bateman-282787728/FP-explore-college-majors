2501596,4,B000E6ESS0,"Falling foul of Nazis and communists alike, East German director Gerhard Klein didn't have a particularly prolific resume, but on the evidence of 1961's The Gleiwitz Case it would have been interesting to see how his career would have developed had he been born in less censorious times. A short (67 minutes) and sharp reconstruction of the manufactured international incident the Nazis used as an excuse to invade Poland, it's very much of its time, a somewhat fragmented but stylistically fascinating film that it's hard to imagine being made in any other decade.

From the very start the film offers a world slightly askew and not quite right, the Nazi newsreel that opens the film viewed at a off-kilter angle and accompanied by abstract, at times almost childishly manic-tempoed circus music, subsequent scenes mixing Jan Curik's cold, harsh near-documentary black and white photography with more wildly stylised sequences like a train journey where focus, filters, odd angles and slightly sped up sound mirror the unreal and deluded mad optimism driving the nation heedlessly to war. Throughout the film alternates long, almost mechanically precise or symmetrical shots with short sharp shocks where the camera will lose control, even throwing in a lightning montage of the chief player in the plot's childhood and Nazi indoctrination before returning to the formalities, while characters are often only partially in frame - the top or the side of their head - as if they're not quite all there.

Even given its short running time, surprisingly little actually happens. In part it's because there are surprisingly few accurate details of the incident (which didn't go quite as smoothly as depicted here), but it's also because Klein and screenwriter Wolfgang Kohlhaase seem as interested in a state of mind and a sense of place: Kohlhaase said that Klein was so talented he could make you know how a courtyard smelled, and there are scenes that really do capture the feeling and mood of a time of day on a remote country road while you're waiting for something to happen. Characterisation is as Spartan as the plot, mixing both national and personal self-interest and ambition outweighing all moral considerations - wars, after all, guarantee accelerated promotion for the career conscious young officer - while rarely going into specifics. Taking its cue from its characters, there's no room for consideration of consequences until the film's final moments: it's all about preparation and waiting. Yet somehow, despite how little there really is going on, it manages to be more than the sum of its parts and strangely compelling. The East German communist party weren't too pleased with the results, ironically feeling it too similar to Nazi cinema (clearly a deliberate aesthetic choice), but it's certainly a case worth reopening.",1292716800,3,2839,5.183006535947713
2501597,5,B000E6ESS0,"This 1961 black and white artistic German film depicts what happened when the Nazis decided to justify their invasion of Poland, which resulted in 43,000,000 deaths. The Nazis wanted an exuse so they faked a Polish attack on a German radio station in the city of Gleiwitz. The film is 70 minutes long, spoken in German, with German and English subtitles. Had this been a regular rather than an artistic depiction, the film makers could have told the entire story, without leaving out any details of the plot, in 30-45 minutes. However, the movie dwells on items that a regular film would omit, such as contrasting regular life and happy songs with the murders and other horrors that the Nazis are about to commit. A lot of time and attention is also given to facial expressions and pastoral scenery. These additions together with the frequent frenetic nature of the filming add to and intensify the Nazi audacity and make the film very powerful.",1287014400,5,945,4.803680981595092
2501598,5,B000E6ESS0,"The historical inspiration for ""The Gleiwitz Case"" is the phony Polish raid on a German radio station staged by the Nazis to justify the invasion of Poland.  I don't know how accurate to the actual events the film is, and to be honest I don't much care.  Because the genuine value of ""Gleiwitz"" is its success in brilliantly satirizing the nonsensical Volk und Vaterland cinematic glorification of Nazism directed by Leni Riefenstahl.

Produced by East Germany's state-controlled DEFA, ""Gleiwitz"" is presented in a documentary-style format.  The theme music is tinny, carnivalesque, almost cartoonish, letting the viewer know right away that a parody is going on.  The images of goose-stepping, fencing, saluting, perfectly uniformed Nazis gives the impression of a huge, impersonally precise machine:  the sort of thing that Riefenstahl valorized comes across here as both chilling and slightly comical.

The cinematography is really quite clever:  a sense of frenetic build-up to war is expressed in a train scene in which Germans gobble food as the German army will soon gobble up Poland.  A bar scene of men crooning a drinking song blends into the rhymic clanging of military transport railway cars.  There's a wonderful scene in which rifles are held by soldiers in such a way as to make them look like erect phalluses--subtle, not overdone, but definitely noticeable to the quick eye.  And the flashback scenes of the protagonist Alfred Naujocks' earlier years give us the life history of a murderer that, again, effectively combines the chilling with the comical.

""The Gleiwitz Case"" is as effective an anti-war film as I've ever seen.  Heartily recommended.",1215302400,11,1667,5.2218045112781954
2501599,4,B000E6ESS0,"To compare the invasion of Poland to the invasion of Iraq is outrageous. Ask the Kurds about the ""alleged weapons of mass destruction""! Maybe if the allies had the nerve for pre-emptive war against the Nazi's before 1939 maybe 40 million people would not have had to die. The Poles suffered horrifically at the hands of both the Nazis and then by the Soviets.",1205366400,7,359,4.625
2501600,4,B000E6ESS0,"German film, English subtitles. Style is truely avant-garde and a play on leni Riefenstahl""s style. Based on the Nazi fabrication of a Polish attack on a Gleiwitz radio station in Germany. Used as a pretext for Hitler's invasion of Poland. There was only so much provacation AH could take. Lies and fabrications of this type seem to be quite  even in our day, nicht wahr?  The German is very clear too, so a double treat for students of the language. A very sobering film. The result, over 40 million dead and Europe devastated. And what have we learned?",1201824000,17,554,4.642857142857143
2501601,5,B000E6ESS0,"This film details the events leading up to the Nazi german invasion of Poland in September 1939. It shows how the Germans hell bent on invading Poland dummied up false evidence as a pretext to invasion. This was accomplished by a fake ""attack"" ostensably by ""Polish"" forces on the German radio station at Gleiwitz on the Polish/German border which in reality was accomplished by German agents in Polish uniforms. Acting upon this ""outrage"" the German Fuhrer Adolf Hitler declares war on Poland and promptly invades the country. Sounds all too familiar to today's sabre rattling rhetoric in regards to Iraq and the alleged ""weapons of mass destruction"" as a pretext to invade a foreign power by means of planning and waging aggressive warfare. Highly recommended!",1198886400,7,762,5.104
2501602,4,B000E6ESS0,"Most of us don't know what the pretext was for Germany invading

Poland in 1939. This little known film fills in the blanks.

The Germans staged a fake raid on a border town, dressed up a concentration camp inmate as a Polish soldier, then killed him as evidence of a Poland invasion.  (The Germans also faked their

""anger"" in the Kristallnacht incident against the Jewish people in their territories).

A number of factors make this film interesting.  First of all...it is by a German director criticising his own people.  Second, the film is a scathing indictment of Leni Riefenstahl who used revolutionary cinematic art to make the Nazis look powerful.  Here the camerman uses the same style to make the Nazis look inhuman, evil, mechanistic.  Many intriguing photographic and musicial touches are used in the filming, and I found the end product appropriately chilling and very effective.  For those interested in a forgotten incident of Nazi history, this movie is a must-see.",1147219200,50,982,5.006172839506172
8106694,4,B000E6ESS0,"The movie is ""stylized"" in a way to mimic ""Triumph of the Will"" which makes it somewhat of the cinematic art variety, but it otherwise delivers its message.

""The Gleiwitz incident was a part of a larger operation carried out by Abwehr and SS forces.[5] There were other incidents orchestrated by Germany along the Polish-German border at the same time as the Gleiwitz attack, such as a house torching in the Polish Corridor and spurious propaganda output. The entire project was dubbed Operation Himmler and comprised a number of incidents[10] intended to give the appearance of Polish aggression against Germany.[8]

""On 1 September 1939, the day following the Gleiwitz attack, Germany launched the Fall Weiss operation  the invasion of Poland  initiating World War II in Europe. Hitler cited the border incidents in a speech in the Reichstag on the same day, with three of them called very serious, as justification for Germany's invasion of Poland.[10] He had told his generals on 22 August, just a few days earlier, ""I will provide a propagandistic casus belli. Its credibility doesn't matter. The victor will not be asked whether he told the truth"".

Fall Weiss took many months to plan and the trigger for it was the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact signed barely a week before the Gleiwitz incident and the rest of operation Himmler.  Gleiwitz incident remains a definitive case of false flag.",1517961600,,1392,5.030434782608696

8106697,1,B000E6ESS0,"Many reviewers here seem to be forgetting, or overlooking the fact that this documentary (and please, just because it is a documentary, does not make it the truth, i.e. Michael Moore?) was made by East German COMMUNISTS.  If you are unaware, Hitler and the NSDAP fought the communists in street battles all throughout the 1920's and early 30's.  At one point there were 6 million communist members in Germany.  The communists were pushing very hard to turn Germany into a Russian revolution style bloodbath, and if it were not for the National Socialists, they would have succeeded.  Those of you who want to romanticize about communism, forget it.  I am not sure you realize, but the people at the top, the one's calling the shots, refer to you as ""useful idiots"".  It is estimated that while the communists were controlling Russia after the 1917 revolution, 30 million to 50 million Russians lost their lives in the most brutal, sadistic way.  That said, can someone please tell me why COMMUNIST East Germany would want to tell the truth about the real cause of the war when Hitler was their arch-enemy?  Can you also please tell me that if this was in fact a false flag, why did Hitler NOT MENTION IT AT ALL in his declaration of war speech on September 1st, 1939?  If this was the false flag they needed to justify to the world that they had to invade Poland, why did he not mention it?  Why was it not plastered all over German newspapers?  The real reason for invading Poland was two-fold:  Hitler had tried to negotiate with the Poles to create a corridor from Western Germany to Danzig, which was over 90% German, and cut off from Germany, and they refused, secondly, There were several million ethnic Germans living in Poland as second class citizens, who were being BRUTALLY SLAUGHTERED by Polish partisans and the Russian NKVD (precursor to KGB).  Let's say, for example, we lost California to Mexico, and Mexican gang members were going around killing US citizens by the thousands.  Should President Obama just sit back and allow that to happen?  Hitler never wanted what should have been only a border dispute to become a major war, but Britain and France did, that is why they declared war on Germany after the invasion of Poland.  If Britain and France were so concerned about Poland, why did they do NOTHING to help them after the invasion?  Why did they not declare war on the Soviet Union when they invaded Poland on September 17th?  And why did they allow the Soviets to occupy and rule Poland with an iron fist for decades after the war as part of the Eastern Block?  The answer is they cared nothing for Poland and simply used them to create an excuse to completely destroy Germany, who was seen as a trade competitor, and was in fact, up until WWI, becoming much more successful than both Britain and France, and surpassing them economically.  Since they did not finish the job in WWI, they needed WWII to complete what they set out to do.  Far fetched?  Not really, the truth about WWII is not what we have been sold, I mean told.  Be diligent and do your own research, read PRIMARY sources, and use your common sense.",1428710400,,3141,4.629963898916968

8106699,4,B000E6ESS0,"I love watching German movies.  This one was made not too long after the war and is in black and white.  It doesn't flow too well, but I really enjoyed the movie overall.  The ending was very difficult to watch because for some reason, it hit me like a ton of bricks - just like those bricks from the brickworks outside of Berlin where the Nazis obtain a Polish prisoner for sinister purposes.  I can't get the scene of what they do to the Polish prisoner out of my mind.  I definitely liked this movie because for me, it just felt very real, despite some lousy acting.  I hope you will enjoy it as well.",1348444800,,604,4.208695652173913
8106700,3,B000E6ESS0,"The Gleiwitz Case will appeal to those people who are hard core ww2 history buffs and outside that niche, I doubt it has any appeal at all.  This is a short film and at moments it seems to go off track, but the unvoiced metaphors in the circus like music and the senseless montages tell you the Reich is careening towards insanity and the attack on Gleiwitz is the match that will light the fuse.  Don't expect any answers or any manner of emotional wrap up to the tale; this is about the start of war, not its ending or happy ever afters.

Is it good? In a sense I thought so, but it really is up to each viewer to make out of it what he can.  The ultimate irony is that; these events are truly how ww2 started and after you've seen them, you can only shake your head in bewilderment.",1339113600,,785,4.111111111111111
8106701,4,B000E6ESS0,"I became interested in this film when I spotted it here on Amazon because I took a ""Writing for TV"" course where we had to do a mini-screenplay based on the attack on the radio station at Gleiwitz as the rationale for Germany rolling into Poland.  Needless to say, my weak attempt didn't even come close to this!

Definitely an arthouse feel to it, but a cool portrayal of a bit of WW2 history a LOT of people don't know about.  Also intriguing in that it was done by an East German film company in the Cold War days - note the large group meal scene re:  what the film aims to say about the Nazis, over and above the general ""they were the bad guys"" theme.",1337731200,,657,4.149606299212598
8106702,4,B000E6ESS0,"This 1961 DEFA production in black and white tells of the surprise attack by a Nazi unit on the radio station at Gleiwitz on the Polish border in 1939. This attack, which was blamed on Polish forces, served as Hitler's reason for marching into Poland, starting the Second World War. Cool and impartial, the film reflects on the possibilities and techniques of provocation. It shows how facts and opinions can be manipulated and how people are made to accept lies, murder and war.
The film narrowly escaped censorship, but quickly disappeared after only a few weeks in East German cinemas. It is a fine portrayal of one of Germany's darker days with an excellent cast including Hannjo Hasse (Helmut Naujocks), Herwart Grosse (Gestapo Chief Mueller), Hilmar Thate (Concentration Camp prisoner), Georg Leopold(Wyczorek) and Wolfgang Kalweit (Kraweit).
DEFA (Deutsche Film-Aktiengesellschaft) was the public-owned film studio in East Germany during East Germany's history.

We had no history of the characters and there were a lot of assumptions. Not interesting, save your money.",1322870400,2,373,4.123287671232877
