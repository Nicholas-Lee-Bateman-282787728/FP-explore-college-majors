8013539,3,B0001KCPE8,"Before his TERRYTOONS operation was in full swing, Paul Terry, creator of Mighty Mouse and Heckle & Jeckle, animated for THANHAUSER and BRAY studios. During his 1916 stint at BRAY, Terry produced 11 Farmer Al Falfa shorts (this character was renamed Farmer Gray decades later). The next year, Terry took the farmer with him to his own company, but closed down in '18 when he enlisted to fight in WWI. After the war, Terry partnered with Amadee Van Beuren. They worked together until 1929, when Terry went out on his own. Between 1916 and '48, Farmer Al appeared in over 100 shorts.

This 55 minute tape features silent Paul Terry-directed VAN BEUREN cartoons with added music tracks.
