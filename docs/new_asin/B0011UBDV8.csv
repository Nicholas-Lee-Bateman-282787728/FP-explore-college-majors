3067954,5,B0011UBDV8,"This documentary is beautifully filmed. It is an amazing view into this small world made up of fascinating contrasts. The tattoos themselves seem to encompass it all, the beauty, the sadness, the organization that the prisoners have created in their community of exaggerated human condition, and the reality of the crimes that the tattoos represent.",1218326400,,349,5.363636363636363

While not as detailed in the history and meaning of individual symbols as the Russian Criminal Tattoo Encyclopedias by Danzig Baldaev et al. it does a wonderful job of capturing the stories of a number of prisoners.  Hearing their tones of voice and seeing their expressions convey the emotion much more than any book possibly could.

3067957,5,B0011UBDV8,"The opening scene of Alix Lambert's ""The Mark of Cain"" immediately draws the viewer into the Russian prison system with a haunting song that sets the mood. This remarkable and highly effective film goes on to introduce music and light and air into a dreary, dark, and fetid world never before laid bare. It was compiled from countless hours of footage revealing the inmates' stories, the age-old evolving tattoo culture, and the politics and psychology of a hidden subworld. It is in no way a pompous, voice-over lesson. It is composed of the prisoners' own words as they tell how their society is structured, why they have been relegated to it, what their pasts consisted of, and what they dream of. A few of them are chilling, many are quite charming. There is palpable, unspoken compassion in this presentation that lets us absorb a wealth of disturbing information about humanity and inhumanity.",1206489600,,899,4.921052631578948
3067958,5,B0011UBDV8,"More than enough coverage of prison tattoo culture to satisfy enthusiasts - though this film is much, much more.  Lambert witnesses complexities of the Russian prison system: staff talent shows, generational changes in prison culture, interviews with inmates and administrators, access to overcrowded cells - inventiveness from nowhere.  Tremendous, lucid density.  Accomplished with an artful, blunt view - a window to the unspeakable and an exceptionally memorable film.",1202947200,7,472,5.911764705882353
3067959,5,B0011UBDV8,"""I thought it would be more interesting if I listed some things that I read and watched in preparation for the making of ""Eastern Promises"" than just listing a random bunch of things that I like. Among these are ""The Mark of Cain,"" by Alix Lambert, not yet available on DVD. A companion piece to the Russian Criminal Tattoo books, this a very courageous documentary on the tattooing subculture in Russian prisons. I don't know how it ever got made, but it's beautiful, scary, and heartbreaking.""

Yes, it is now available.  As of March 25, 2008 you don't have to be friends with David Cronenberg or Viggo Mortensen to see this amazing film.  Those of you who saw it the first time around when it was a finalist for the Independent Spirit Award know the gist of the story, but for those who don't, it's still incredible.
On a shoestring budget, filmmaker Alix Lambert traveled to Russia and through sheer determination, gained access to the darkest prisons in the country.  Her interviews with murderers and mobsters who openly discuss multiple beheadings, contract killings and the mythology and meaning of their tattoos make up the  majority of the film, but it is the prison system itself that is most effectively exposed.
Cronenberg talks about re-writing the script for 'Eastern Promises' after seeing this film, and after you see it, you'll understand why.  You can't talk about organized crime in modern Russia without referencing Alix Lambert's ""The Mark of Cain"".  This is the seminal work.",1201824000,16,1517,4.90234375

8242379,4,B0011UBDV8,An Informative work visualizes both a state of declaining criminal tattoo-marking and an environment in a new Russia's penetrial system to date of a doco release in 2000.,1460419200,,170,5.107142857142857

8242381,5,B0011UBDV8,Still hard to imagine how this movie got made. Alex takes us into the heart of so much darkness. One of the most bravest and interesting docs I have ever seen,1452988800,,158,4.129032258064516
8242382,5,B0011UBDV8,This is  an extremely interesting documentary.,1446508800,,46,6.666666666666667
8242383,5,B0011UBDV8,"We use terms like 'Depraved' and 'Inhumane', but we seldom see situations which truly warrant the use of those words. In&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alix-Lambert-s-The-Mark-of-Cain/dp/B0011UBDV8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alix Lambert's The Mark of Cain</a>&nbsp;you may even find those terms inadequate to describe what you will see.

I have to admit that I give this film Five Stars for being what it is, even though it's not what you expect it to be. Rather than a documentary about tattoos, this is an expose' of Russian political corruption, and the failure of a supposedly civilised nation to manage it's penal system. Even the officials interviewed in this film admit that lack of funding and supervision, leads them to warehouse humans in facilities that are not fit for animals. There is frank starvation, a complete lack of medical care, and overcrowding so severe that prisoners are forced to sleep in shifts, because there are twenty prisoners crammed into cells meant to house four, or perhaps six men. Meals, if you apply the term liberally enough to consider them as such, consist of bread and gruel that are so rancid, eating them makes the men sick. Prisoners regularly contract diseases from malnutrition. And Tuberculosis is so rampant that even the correction officers and prison officials have it.

Almost coincidentally,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alix-Lambert-s-The-Mark-of-Cain/dp/B0011UBDV8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alix Lambert's The Mark of Cain</a>&nbsp;presents some insight into the meaning of Russian prison and gang tattoos. No image is what it appears to be. Each tattoo has a hidden meaning, and at least for the older generation, one must 'earn' the right to wear most types of tattoos. In Russia, as in the United States, wearing tattoos has become more of a fashion statement than a badge of personal or political status. But for hard-liners and old-timers in both countries, 'Ink' is serious business, and it's meaning and message is not something to be taken lightly. The film does not go very deeply into what each tattoo means, or even provide examples of a wide variety of tats. But you will be left with a sense of how deeply the men and women presented are affected by the ink they wear. And the sort of hopelessness and surrender to their condition that the inked designs can represent.",1272758400,3,2428,5.559459459459459
8242384,5,B0011UBDV8,"How this documentary was even made I don't know, because the use of tattoo machines in Russian prisons is forbidden. Its heart breaking to see a country takes its churches and turn them into prisons. The negative affects of communism are show here perfectly. Thru the story you hear of a man who steals 4 windows and getting 5 years hard labor, while a murderer will only get 3, it just makes no sense what so ever. I recommend this to anyone, its an absolute wake up call.",1270425600,,473,4.386363636363637
8242385,3,B0011UBDV8,"I watched Eastern Promises the other evening, and this movie was touted highly as being a strong source of inspiration for much of the detail (particularly the tattoos) featured in that excellent film, so I added this to my Netflix and received it this afternoon.  While it's a fairly solid (if a little tedious) documentary, it's really not about the fascinating vor v zakone tattoos that are such an integral part of Eastern Promises.  Rather, it is more an indictment of the post-Communist Russian prison system, paying close attention to the overcrowding, poor healthcare and nutrition, and generally despicable conditions there; the tattoos are mentioned randomly, and with little connection to the rest of the film.  Overall, there's probably about 20 minutes of exhibition and explanation of the tattoos, with the remainder of the time filled with everything from a prison staff talent show, to a scary looking tatted-up gypsy prisoner tap dancing to keyboard music (yes - really), to a very butch ex-skier lesbian in the women's prison lamenting how infrequently she sees her girlfriend who's ostensibly in another cell block.

The entire show could have been cut down by about an hour for those of us who are really only interested in the vor v zakone as mentioned in the film Eastern Promises, and really, if you've seen that movie, you already know more about it (however to a lesser or greater degree fictional it may be) than this movie will tell you.  Russia's prison's are indeed awful places as shown here, but if that was to be the focus of this film, it should have been marketed as such.  But, with shows like Miami and LA Ink being so popular right now, I suppose Alix Lambert is cashing in on a fad to showcase this mediocre documentary in the most popular light possible.  Final verdict: save your money (or at least get it via Netflix - don't buy it) unless you're really interested, but otherwise - take a pass on this one.",1261526400,,1947,4.794029850746269
8242386,4,B0011UBDV8,"A documentary on the violence, hopelessnesss and mistreatment inherent in the ""modern"" but underfunded Russian prison system.  A composite of interviews with prisoners--mostly men and some women--who explain their crimes and the symbolic meanings of their intricate tatoos.  Very scary, sad and depressing to see people in this condition.",1247184000,2,338,5.877551020408164
8242387,5,B0011UBDV8,This documentary is captivating and very interesting. We learn more about the Zone and the Vory v Zakone and much more through these criminals wearing those famous tattoos. I recommend this DVD.,1243900800,,194,5.09375
8242388,5,B0011UBDV8,"The Mark of Cain is the macro lens. On the surface, this incredible documentary by Alix Lambert is an excruciatingly tight close-up of tattoos and their role in Russia's criminal world. Yet it turns out this is only a device to look at larger issues, at the role of prisons and crime in Russia. Amazingly, Lambert and her film crew gained access to Russian prisons and - even more remarkably - got prisoners to talk openly about their lives (and tattoos). As a result, this is one of the most important documentaries on Russia to emerge in the last 15 years. Honest, revealing, heart-breaking, it is a superb work of journalism.
