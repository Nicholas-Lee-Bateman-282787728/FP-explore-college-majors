6090052,1,B00GMV8G7U,"If you're considering watching this film to learn more about Anna Nicole Smith know up front that it offers little more than the tabloids offered and perhaps less. If you're watching it hoping to catch some exposed flesh on the actress who plays her you'll be disappointed as well. If, on the other hand, you enjoy made for TV movies that barely touch on the reality of the person the movie is about you're in for a treat.

For anyone who doesn't know who Anna Nicole Smith was she was a single mother and stripper who catapulted her way to fame and fortune with breast implants and a dreams of fame and fortune. She achieved those goals when she romanced a millionaire who despite his children's disapproval married her and took her into his home. There she parlayed her looks and figure into a modeling career and eventual centerfold stardom in Playboy.

But, as is usually the case, that led to problems with drinking and drugs. When he husband dies and the family fights her over his estate things go from bad to worse. Eventually she went on to more notorious fame as an empty headed star of her own reality show where each week people tuned in to see this train wreck of a person on a downward spiral.

I'm sorry but I never found the whole story of Smith to be that interesting at all. Sure she was an attractive woman but with the opportunities she was presented with you have to wonder why it is that anyone given those chances wouldn't take advantage of them instead of squandering them. In the end she became a sad caricature of the person she portrayed instead of a living, breathing human being. Even in her death the vultures preyed upon her corpse trying to get anything they could from her celebrity. It was a sad life and this movie doesn't do anything to show a good or a bad side of her. It just lays there offering nothing.",1409356800,3,1843,4.446745562130178

Who even cares? I feel the cast did a good job even though people get the wrong idea why the script and the story-line is all wrong and faded....Folks believe me, it's only a movie and yes Hollywood make a lot of money making movies plus hiring all the writers and stuff when making biopics or stories like this. Luckily I didn't have to buy the DVD but have to rented on Redbox for my own sake.

If I were you for those who love Anna Nicole Smith and wanted to learn more, is carefully do your research and homework if you want the real truth.

This movie isn't no masterpiece as I consider. I think the open sources are usuable to those individuals who willing to learn what it takes to make it since the industry itself is real dark, dirty, fast and yes real crazy as we see today.

God bless Anna Nicole Smith and his song Daniellynn who are enjoying peacefully in Heaven.

6090058,1,B00GMV8G7U,"As a fan of Anna Nicole Smith I find this movie to be very offensive.
It gets Countless things flatout wrong. The producers either didn't
care about the truth or where too lazy to do any decent research and it
showed. And if I remember right I read an article where the director- Mary Horton said
she DIDN'T want to talk to either the real Larry Birkhead or the real Howard K Stern.
Also, the real Larry Birkhead said that Sony sent the real Howard K. Stern a letter saying that
they did NOT want to talk to them.

If you decide to watch this movie just know that:

- Howard K. Stern was not at J. Howard Marshall's funeral. Anna Nicole Smith and Howard K. Stern would not even meet
for another two years.

-Anna didn't go to a bar after the Supreme Court hearing and get drunk.
According to the REAL Larry Birkhead, She went back to her hotel room. (Hearing things like that is probably why
the director said that she didn't want to talk to either Larry or Howard- it would be harder to make things up out of thin air)

--Anna did not introduce herself to Paul Marciano as Anna Nicole Smith.
It was Paul Marciano who gave her that name. (Duh!)

-Anna did not introduce Dannielynn to Daniel as ""Dannielynn"". She
would not be given that name until After Daniel died.

I don't think I've ever heard Anna call Daniel, Danny.

-Anna didn't wake up and find Daniel dead in a chair. When Anna woke up she found Daniel
 unresponsive in the same bed she was in.

-Anna and Howard where not the only two people at Daniel's funeral.
Anna's friends where there to.

-Daniel did not wear a suit and tie in his coffin. Anna wanted
him to be comfortable so he wore a T-shirt and his trucker hat.

Those are just the Few things this movie got wrong that  I could think of off the top of my head.

There was a lot of legitimate drama in Anna's life. It was not necessary to make a bunch of garbage up.

If the writers and producers decided to do the REAL story about Anna Nicole smith
 and actually did some decent research and actually talked to the real Howard K. Stern
 and real Larry Birkhead they could have gotten the truth and probably a much
better story:

One of Anna's ex boyfriends- Mark Hatten stalked her and was arrested for beating up her next door neighbor.
 Mark Hatten's sister-Jackie Hatten is just as much of a nutjob as her brother. She actually said that she
was Dannielynn's godmother.

The infamous ""clown video"" was stolen from Anna's house the day after she died.
The person who stole it- and edited it- was Ford Shelley. Ford Shelley was a family friend of Larry Birkhead.
Ford Shelley is a crook. (He is currently in prision for real estate fraud) He tried to kick Anna out of her home after Daniel died. And he helped Anna move away from Larry. His apparent friend.

Despite the fact that Anna's former bodyguard ""Big Moe"" was at first
a big defender of Howard K. Stern, Howard stopped talking to him when he found out
that Moe stole Anna's camera card from her hotel room before
EMS arrived. Larry Birkhead said on the witness stand that he told Moe to give him
Anna's camera card back and Moe refused saying that he was out to get him
and Howard

After Anna's mother Virgie Arthur said how scared she was that Dannielynn was in the
hands of that ""no good"" Howard K. Stern and she just wanted her granddaughter
to be with her real father, once the dna test proved Larry Birkhead was Dannielynn's real father and Howard said
he was not going to keep on fighting for custody (as Dannielynn's then legal guardian he had the legal right to)
the only thing that was preventing Larry from taking Dannielynn home- finally getting her away
from that ""no good hks"" was getting her a passport. Virgie Ahthur  suddenly turned
around a started to fight Larry for co-custody of Dannielynn; which kept  Dannielynn in Howard's care longer
 than it would have. (I'm sure that had nothing to do with the fact that her granddaugher could some day be
worth several million dollars)

It is little known that Howard was willing to get the DNA test done but he wanted it done in private- out of the media's glare
At one point Larry's lawyer- Debra Opri gave Howard a threat of a restraining order telling him to
 have nothing to do with Larry. Larry had no clue of this until the next time he saw Howard in court. The next day
 Larry fired Debra Opri. Opri of course blamed Howard. Larry later said in court papers that Opri liked having
everything in front of the media because she was trying to her her own Nancy Grace like TV show

Like I said before, Anna's life was crazy enough. You didn't have to make up a bunch of trash that someday
her daughter is going to watch.",1394323200,16,4665,4.380510440835267
6090059,2,B00GMV8G7U,"Though the DVD doesnt say so, this film must have been made for commercial broadcast TV. How else to explain that during the brief (though it seems longer than that) 89 minute film about the well-known Playboy model (and later cable TV reality-show star) Anna Nicole Smith contains not one expletive nor any (even brief) nudity. The film listed as not rated (not unrated) so, even though I was not looking for lots of topless women, even the women in the strip club in Texas (where she got her start) are wearing bikinis. Except for the drug references (she takes lots of pills  mostly Zanec- and snorts cocaine in one scene)there is nothing offensive here. Okay, maybe the really dumb fake hairpieces on the male characters.

I did a bit of research on the film after watching it but couldn't find the answer to how they director filmed the before and after breast enlargement surgery that AMS had and which was the first step in making her a celebrity. Actress Agnes Bruckner (who doesnt have a lot on her film credit list) is shown with smaller breasts at the beginning and MUCH larger ones soon afterwards. It couldn't have been makeup (and I don't think they used CGI) but who knows.

The film is based on an article in Now York Magazine which gives you an idea of why it is so short in trying to tell ANSs life from when she was 7 years old (in 1974) and finds a copy of Playboy Magazine under her fathers bed (and the director uses a rare  even in 1974 - collectible 1950s issue with Marilyn Monroe on the cover (talk about a continuity issue).  She becomes a pole dancer in a strip club under her real name (Vicky Lynn) and soon she is posing for Playboy with the name Anna Nicole Smith  though we are never told how she got that name or who thought of it. Twenty-two  minutes into the film she meets 84-year old millionaire J. Howard Marshall (Martin Landau in a truly embarrassing role) who she later marries later at the 42 minute point (see how engaging this film was? I was watching the clock and counting the minutes!).  She has a son when the film starts and we watch him age (with different actors) but nearly 20 years after he was assumedly born, the actor playing him is same as one as age 14 with no makeup change.

Well, I could go on but, honestly, Id be wasting your time.  If you want to see an entertaining take on ANSs life check out the DVD of the opera (yes, I said OPERA)  in English titled Anna Nicole. Youll find my review there. Trust me; it is better than this film.

The DVD has no bonus features and, since it was a made-for-TV film, not even a trailer.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6090484,3,B00GMV8G7U,"Anna Nicole was a severely damaged human being.  She needed a lot of things in her life that she never got and it only got worse once she got money.  It is my personal belief that the people that surrounded her in her life after she became a big star were leeches and parasites and never had the skills and talents they needed to properly care for someone with the compulsive nature and behaviors like Anna Nicole.  They simply all ended up doing and saying what she insisted on - all of which led to the continual decline of her sparse mental capacities, physical health and eventual death.  There is no joy in the story of this pathetic woman's life.  Very sad.",1428019200,10,663,4.401639344262295

6090487,5,B00GMV8G7U,I really love the movie!  I truly feel she was a good person!  She was not afraid of showing her true self!  She had a light that shined!  Too bad that she did not fulfill her life to the fullest!  Judging people is a bad thing!  Because that person did what she could to survive!  Beauty and kindness is what I saw in this movie!  I hope Danny Lynne gets to know truth about her mom!  She was a light that fizzled out from her when her son death.  She just wanted to be noticed!,1426464000,3,479,3.9473684210526314

6090525,5,B00GMV8G7U,"I haven't received it yet but when I do I will be very pleased. I loved Anna Nicole Smith. Her middle name and last name is the same as mine. I love how she was so crazy passionate about being beautiful and loving her son and daughter. I love how she followed her dream to be a model. I never put negative thoughts on her even when her life was out of control. She was funny, loved, and really bigger than life. She was the NEXT MARILYN MONORE!!! No doubt about that. No one can do it like Anna!!!",1415664000,,497,4.03030303030303

6090527,5,B00GMV8G7U,"This movie is incredibly sad for me. I know for the most part, people might see the movie as very sleazy for the first half of it, but when it comes time for Anna Nicole to be admitted to the hospital when her baby girl is born, I'm not going to spoil it, but from that point on, there is a serious tragedy regarding her son. (Though most might already know, since this is based on realism.) The first half of the movie, I'll admit is pure sleaze, though I understand that her story is being told how it was.

Still, I feel that there is some way a bunch of it could have been glossed over, pointless stripper scenes that don't move the plot, maybe instead of wasting time making those, you can have her head out to stage and fade to next scene and find other methods to portray her ""first"" job that really is only relevant in regards to explaining her life which needed to be understood to actually understand the real point of the movie.

For me, the story really begins once she and Danny get a house, her relationship with her son is one of the main plots, actually the one that really hits home for me and then her more relevant career, that is where it really starts for me and from there it travels on into a tragedy that will tear your heart out, not just for the wrtiting, directing, or the actual lives of the people but the actors as well do an amazing job. It takes a lot to hit me emotionally and this movie brought me from witnessing a touch and go life into utter tears when it all inevitably crashes.

Good movie, worth every cent, great cast, especially our leads as mother and son, they do a beyond amazing job and the writing is incredible and surprising when you see some of the things her son does in reaction to the things that she had done or was doing. If you can just get through the first part, I promise you it's worth it, all that is was to make us understand the start, but it could have been done with fewer scenes, particularly the ones that bring about the points that take you to the next plot point, there were more stripper scenes than the movie really called for but trust me, it's worth the buy if you get through and advance to the next part that will begin the journey of your emotions being stirred and torn to pieces by the tragedy of Anna Nicole.",1412899200,2,2288,4.219178082191781
