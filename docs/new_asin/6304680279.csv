909042,3,6304680279,"Whereas W. L. Wilder's following film, 'Killers From Space' (1954), offers an original twist on the time-honored invasion theme (see my review), this movie plays it a lot straighter. Its progression closely follows that of similarly themed films: an unknown presence (the Other) disrupts order, is eventually identified, tracked, and found. Yet despite this predictable structure, some key points make the film worth watching. Previous reviewers have mentioned the movie's reliance on overly talky scenes; I personally did not mind it, since the discussions are interestingly written and acted. The Phantom himself is an intriguing character. As in most sci-fi films of the 1950s, the invader is considered an enemy, but his role is quite ambiguous: the havoc he creates is linked to his own precarious situation, and the humans do not become pure killing machines eager to get rid of the Other. Not that they mind much when he dies, though... in that regard, the final scene is a little disappointing. As a whole, this film is very modest and far from exceptional, but fans of 1950s sci-fi should be pleased with its redeeming facets.",1090195200,3,1135,5.10752688172043
909043,3,6304680279,"""The Phantom From Space"" is a sci-fi cheapie from 1953. The first half is pretty boring, as most of the action involves driving around in ridiculous old cars with ludicrous antennae on their roofs looking for disturbances. This takes place in California, so there are some other wacky things going on, but just to make sure we understand, the bulk of the first half hour or so is narrated. As the narrator drones on over the scenes of stock footage, and the cars drive around endlessly, something finally happens! A murder by a guy in a diving suit happens, to be specific, but unfortunately for the audience, all that results for our entertainment is some really tough (not!) interrogation of the prime suspect. Ultimately a couple of people get killed and a refinery gets set on fire.
As the movie gets over the hump and starts picking up steam, we see some silly police foot chases of the diving-suit being that go on a bit too long, but ultimately corner the guy in a lab with a pretty female scientist. To evade capture the being takes off his suit and turns out to be invisible unless exposed to ultraviolet light. They chase him around until he needs to put his helmet back on while he practices Morse code with the lady scientist. She figures out that he needs to breathe methane (hence his attraction to the refinery...see how it all makes sense) but thanks to the comic relief newspaper reporter who is forever screwing everything up (at least they got that part right) he drops and breaks his helmet. Eventually we see him shriek and burn up in what I believe may be the Griffith Park Observatory, his mission having utterly failed.
This film is a borderline two or three star movie, but I decided to go with three as it was quite well made considering that it was from 1953. I liked that the film didn't attempt to make the invader from space into a killing machine, and that in the end actually made the audience feel sympathy for him. The special effects are not so special by the standards of today, but remember this was made 51 years ago, and I think was a pretty credible effort for the time. The acting is average, and the script is too. The biggest weaknesses were pacing and the whole silliness with the cars with ridiculous antennae. The second half is entertaining, and the creature actually looks good when we finally get to see him. If you can get past the first half, this is better than average for mid 1950s sci-fi.",1088208000,12,2443,4.541950113378685
909044,3,6304680279,"W. Lee Wilder had a penchant for making enjoyably average yet largely forgettable science fiction films.  In Phantom From Space (1953), he introduces us to a much more agreeable alien than that found in his more familiar Killers From Space of the following year.  Okay, so the phantom does kill a few people and cause some serious oil fires, but it's not all his fault.  He's just not a people person, you see, what with being invisible and all.  He's also not that bright, choosing to ditch his spacesuit and helmet rather than fall into the clutches of the humans on his tail.  He needs something akin to a methane gas atmosphere in order to breathe, and a helmet-less jaunt on earth with its oxygen-based atmosphere threatens to cut short his visit in a most significant way.
The film starts out with an unidentified object hurtling from Alaska to the California coast, where the object seems to disappear.  Mobile communications folks are sent out to determine the source of interference suddenly wreaking havoc in the area, and these guys keep bumping into cops investigating murders and other acts of destruction.  Soon, these different forces team up with an army man and a scientist, and everyone eventually comes to the amazing conclusion that the source of all the trouble is actually a humanoid not of this world.  The ending is not exactly a bright and chipper one, but it is just about the only plausible ending possible and, in its own way, it works pretty effectively.
I actually enjoyed Phantom From Space, despite a number of slow scenes in the first half of the film.  The actors are reasonably good albeit colorless, and I was amused at the way the lead scientist seemed to become more and more German as the action progressed.  There are certain limited parallels between this movie and Monster a Go-Go, and I feel compelled to state that the conclusion of Phantom From Space is far, far better than what you will find in its B-movie cousin.  There's nothing here to make this film stand out, but it is a relatively painless and occasionally interesting cinematic diversion.",1064880000,15,2094,4.788888888888889
909045,4,6304680279,"sure buy this movie. it's entertaining. the special effects and costuming are way below today's standards, but it could be remade tomorrow with the right stars and writers and (in my opinion) sell movie tickets because the story line is genuine--an alien arrives and needs our help to survive. the suspense is in seeing if there's going to be a happy ending.",1026777600,,358,4.790322580645161
909046,2,6304680279,"W. Lee Wilder, brother of Billy Wilder, directed this exciting tale of people sitting around and talking while an invisible space alien flees all who come into his invisible path.  Unfortunately, this 1953 clunker is not as beautifully campy and tacky as Wilder's ""Killers from Space"" or ""Snow Creature,"" though it does feature some hilarious film-noir method acting in the person of a needlessly abusive cop who simply won't take anyone's word for anything.  When the lead characters aren't sitting around discussing the obvious, they are running around outside and shouting the obvious.

909419,4,6304680279,"Although I grew up watching old sci-fi and horror films on TV in the 60's, this is one I don't remember seeing. Not until I got it in a Mill Creek collection of 100 Sci-Fi Classics. What appealed to me immediately was that it was reminiscent of my many favorites from the 50's; pure nostalgia.

The story of an alien from another planet, crash landing off the coast of L.A. and simply trying to escape capture to survive, killing as necessary, is serviceable yet certainly could have been portrayed more compellingly. The acting is typical 'B' melodrama, the effects are fairly good for the era, and the story is just OK. Staging much of it as a police procedural, which was very popular at the time, is an effective budget device. I don't think it's a stretch to suppose that the budget and shooting schedule were insufficient to do much more with the film. That and it's seventy-two minute run time don't allow for additional story details, action sequences, nor engaging characterization. Not that Billy Wilder's little brother, W. Lee Wilder had what it took to make more out of such meager resources, anyway.

Be that as it may, Wilder did a decent job, as he did with several other lesser 'B' classics including, ""Killers From Space,"" ""The Man Without a Body,"" and ""Once a Thief,"" which just might be his masterpiece.

Nonetheless, this modest piece of nostalgia has an effective soundtrack featuring theremin and an erie choir. I usually half-watch it when I'm busy doing something else. Far from great, but I still like it.",1469750400,2,1531,4.7481203007518795

909580,4,6304680279,"First, I feel I must warn anyone reading this review that I am a B-grade sci-fi fan, preferably C- or D-grade to be honest. I believe the best sci-fi film is one that, unintentionally, makes me laugh. However I rarely, if ever, find science fiction films written as comedies to be funny. What causes me to smile so broadly as I watched this film (for the third time) is how dated it is and I don't believe that to be the fault of anyone involved in its creation. In regard to special effects, perception of time travel, ET's, and the sciences in general, this film is like a time-capsule. It would be interesting to add some extras to this video:  lighting and camera techniques, directions on how they filmed an ""invisible"" alien vs. how that would be done today; how investigators and scientists would track and combat the alien using tech and applying up-to-date scientific methods and understanding. Technology and mankind's understanding of the world around, continues to change but films like this are, for me, like a trip down memory lane. I loved the big antennae on top of the cars as our heroes drove around, tracking the ""monster"" by radio waves. I liked the fact these professionals were savvy enough to know a radio-active space suit needed to be handled with tongs and transported in a lead-lined box but had no qualms about standing right next to the suit or handling another part of the space suit that had been in direct contact with the part they refused to touch. I enjoyed watching this film again and will enjoy it as much the next time I watch it and for the same reason I enjoy a good conspiracy theory - because it makes me wonder.
I gave this film 4 out of 5 stars because of what I perceived to be sincerity; I think the writers, producer(s), actors were attempting to make a serious sci-fi flick. If I am correct, I think they succeeded. The antiquated scientific applications and understandings, the dated props and misapplied methods of investigation are, for me, the cherry on the sundae!",1468454400,2,2018,4.636871508379889

909953,4,6304680279,"I like it for what it is ... it isn't Shakespeare, it's an old B-horror movie!!

Classic B sci-fi. Needed a bit more of a plot, but much of it was filmed at Griffiths Observatory, which was very cool to see.  A lot of the old sci fi stuff became the basis for the sci fi movies of today.  A little corndog, but the special effects are interesting to watch.  And yes, spoiler alert, the spaceman is shown naked (cleverly done at the end)

Phantom From Space is one of the better sci-fi B movies from the 1950's and I found this one quite creepy.  A UFO is seen and then suddenly disappears. Then, a series of strange murders have taken place and sightings of a diving suited figure are reported. Strange thing is that all of the witnesses have not seen a head in this suit. It turns out these murders are the responsibility of this figure and to make matters worse is invisible and radioactive. He appears briefly towards the end before suffocating, and then disintegrates. With a dog named Venus.

Having no money to spend on special effects or makeup, producer-director William Lee Wilder did his best to entertain us with this light-weight tale about an alien who crashlands near the Griffith Observatory and tries to allude pursuing scientists.  Considering the buget an effort that was made in shooting the movie at numerous locations the cast was enthusiastic. Several of the actors went on to greater things in the cinema as part players so the acting was of fair quality.  To save money, the filmmakers (a) never actually show the spaceship and (b) make the alien invisible.

I thought Wilder actually made a good looking film that at least looks very professional and it's even more impressive considering the budget and the no-name cast. As for the cast, the performances really aren't the greatest but I think for the most part they're good enough for this type of material

A touching story involving an almost seemingly human alien is weakened by unnecessary serious narration as the alien is by the lack of his proper oxygen. Almost resembling ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" in theme and motivation, it takes a while to get off the ground but when it does, you may find yourself beginning to be touched by the unfortunate being who seems determined to try and communicate. At times, the alien seems nefarious, but like Frankenstein's monster, there is definitely something to pity. The scenes between the alien and the heroine (Lela Nelson) take on a level of understanding usually absent in these kind of movies. Like other viewers,

If this sounds interesting to you, you can check out (a fairly poor quality) copy of the movie before you buy it.

SPOILER ALERT
At 7:15 in the evening, radar picks up an unidentified flying object above Barrow, Alaska. The object travels south at an estimated speed of 5,000 miles per hour and continues south at a reduced speed and altitude until shortly after 8:00 p.m., when it disappears from the radar near Santa Monica, California. Around the same time, the Los Angeles Communications Commission office receives numerous complaints about radio and television interference and sends out mobile units to investigate. Lt. Hazen and his driver Charlie in Mobile Unit 1 are hailed by Betty Evans at the beach, where her husband and their friend have been attacked by a man in a suit at the picnic grounds. After assisting Betty, whose husband has died, Charlie remains in the area to investigate further while Hazen goes to the police station to make a report. There, Hazen listens as Betty's friend tells Lt. Bowers that they were attacked by an unidentified man wearing what appeared to be a diving suit and helmet, although no face could be distinguished under the mask. Not long afterward, a second death occurs at a gas station in the same area, and a neighbor, George Nelson, reports experiencing interference on his television. Hazen and Charlie trace further interference as it moves toward the Huntington Beach oil fields. After an explosion at the oil fields causes another death, Hazen meets again with Bowers who, although initially suspicious that Betty and her friend murdered her husband, now believes that the interference and the deaths may be connected. When a police sketch artist completes a drawing of the unidentified killer, Betty and her friend confirm its accuracy and are released. A night watchman from the oil fields adds further confirmation that the sketch matches the appearance of a person who was near a tank when it exploded. Bowers receives instructions from the the Central Bureau in Washington, D.C., with whom he had consulted, to contact Maj. Andrews and scientist Dr. Wyatt at the Griffith Institute observatory. When Andrews and Wyatt see the drawing, Andrews suggests that the ""phantom"" may be linked to the U.F.O. sighted earlier that evening. Although skeptical about the existence of spaceships, Andrews and Wyatt note that the U.F.O. could not have been a missile or meteor because of its trajectory, controlled speed and descent. Wyatt's assistant, Barbara Randall, interrupts to tell them that newspaper reporter Joe Wakeman has followed Bowers to the observatory and insists on seeing him. Bowers, however, refuses to give Wakeman any information about the suspected murders. After midnight, Andrews, Wyatt, Barbara, Bowers, Hazen, Charlie and Wakeman travel to a brickyard where a disturbance has been reported. There they see the phantom and follow his trail of radiation by using a Geiger-M&uuml;ller counter. When the phantom slips inside a building and removes his helmet and suit, he becomes invisible and eludes the investigators. The suit and helmet are taken to a laboratory at Griffith where Wyatt and Barbara discover that the suit's material cannot be torn, cut or burned, but is magnetic. By 3:00 a.m., they also determine that the suit is capable of protecting a body outside the earth's atmosphere, and that the contents of the helmet contain gases proving that the wearer does not breathe oxygen and will need the helmet to survive. When Barbara is alone in the lab, the phantom enters the room and locks her in. Although he is invisible, the phantom's footprint appears in some spilled powder on the floor. Barbara calls out to her husband Bill when he arrives, and he brings Wyatt and Andrews to help, but when they get to the lab it is empty. The phantom carries Barbara, who has fainted, through the planetarium but returns to the lab, where Barbara awakens and sees the phantom put on the helmet to breathe. The phantom attempts to tap out a code with a pair of scissors but Barbara is unable to interpret its meaning. When she turns on an ultraviolet light, however, she sees a ghostly hand and screams. By the time help arrives, the phantom has escaped out the window, leaving the helmet behind. Moments later, the suit disintegrates. Based on the the phantom's footprint, apparent intelligence and the suit's and helmet's advanced technology, Wyatt asserts that the phantom is a super-human whose spaceship was accidentally pulled into earth's orbit and crashed in the ocean. Recalling that Betty's husband attacked the phantom before being killed himself, and that the gases in the phantom's helmet may have ignited the tank at the oilfield, Bowers concludes the series of deaths may have been accidental. Unknown to Charlie and Bill, who are conversing outside the planetarium, the phantom is operating the radar inside Charlie's car in an attempt to send out a signal. The Communications Center picks up the signal and radios Charlie, who is astonished to see the car door seemingly open on its own. Wyatt, Andrews, Bowers and Hazen set up surveillance machines to alert them when the phantom returns. Around 3:45 a.m., Barbara is again alone in the lab when the phantom returns to draw air from the helmet. Barbara announces the phantom's presence over a loudspeaker system, after which everyone arrives at the laboratory and attempts to calm the phantom. However, the flash on Wakeman's camera goes off and terrifies the alien, causing him to drop and smash the helmet, which then dissolves. Everyone then follows Wyatt's dog Venus, who detects the phantom's presence and barks. After the phantom climbs up to a platform on the big space telescope, its full human-like form can be seen through the use of ultraviolet lights.

I watch many of these films now because I saw many in my early school years.  Even in grade school I knew much of the science was wrong, yet the films were intriguing and entertaining.  People in so many walks of life were often presented as very thoughtful though the actual population simply was not dwelling at all on deep issues--mostly going to work and spending time with their families not investigation UFOs.

910631,3,6304680279,"The picture on the box looks much better than the actual phantom, but this movie has its moments.  Though the film was low budget, and there are some silly moments, the film tries to be somewhat serious, and rather than the usual approach to aliens in the 50s, meaning shoot to kill, dissect them, and then ask questions, the people who encounter the phantom make an attempt at communication.  If they would have had better gadgets, perhaps they could have spoken.

An alien space ship goes from Alaska to California, which seems awfully sensible if you consider the weather in the two states.  Unfortunately, the landing is a bit rougher than the alien had planned, and the alien has to literally come ashore.  Unfortunately for the alien, bizarre-looking space suits were out of season at that time, and the local fashion police attacked him.  The space suited phantom had to kill in order to defend his right to express himself through his uniform.

Unfortunately, killing people is mostly frowned upon in California, so the local gendarmes attempt to track the being down, using super incredible whiz-bang detection equipment.  I was confused as to whether I should be impressed or laugh, so I finally chose rolling my eyes each time I saw a cheesy ""dish"" car.  Just think, a satellite dish on the roof of a car might be all the rage today.

Eventually there is quite a crowd chasing one, poor defenseless alien around.  The alien decides to ditch his space suit to take advantage of his natural invisibility.  Needing to breath the special mixture provided by his suit seemed to advise against taking his space suit off.  The next thing you know the space suit dissolves, except for the helmet.

There is a brief moment where it looks like everyone was going to sit around a campfire and sing ""Kumbaya"" when a goofy reporter sets off a flash bulb, frightening the alien and generally decreasing the low opinion of everyone with respect to reporters.  The frightened alien breaks his helmet, which then quickly dissolves, and then makes a break for the observatory.  Fortunately, his pursuers have ultraviolet lights that enable them to see the alien in a flashy blurry way, so that we can see the exciting climax to the movie.

This movie was decent.  I enjoyed seeing an alien in the position of inadvertent visitor who just wanted to live, while there were also people who wanted him to live.  The first half of the movie is slow, but after everyone ends up in the laboratory building things start picking up.  It is too bad that the atmosphere needed by the alien was not readily available.  If you consider yourself a fan of classic science fiction, I urge you to watch this one because it takes a different approach from other similar movies from that era.

Enjoy!",1340582400,3,2774,4.747390396659708

910633,2,6304680279,"This sci-fi film features the mandatory scientist with German accent (didn't the US have any homegrown scientists at that time?), the beautiful lady scientist, a couple of other science/government types, and the the police investigator (one of whom sounds almost exactly like Rod Serling).  This group sets out to solve the biggest science puzzle in history while the rest of the nation slumbers on.  (A threat to our nations airspace and the pentagon isn't involved?  Did anyone bother to inform the president?)

When a comet or spaceship appears on US radar and a mysterious being is reported being seen, you'd think the stage is set for some interesting action.  But, no. there are about thirty minutes of guys in trucks just driving around trying to pick up some radio signals.  When the group of intrepid investigators finally get a clue that the alien is in trouble and needs their help, are they concerned with figuring out how to save his life?

No, this group is more concerned about setting a trap to catch it!  About the last thirty minutes is taken up with this discussions about what type of alien it might be, and then running around from room to room trying to get hold of the alien.  It's like some sort of hillbilly alien catching contest at the county fair.

I am intrigued by the reviewers who saw redeeming value in this film. It's hard for me to see through stiff acting and a weak plot, (it is like a 20 minute television episode stretched into an hour and a half).

Story line and plot, 'The Phantom from Space' was a refreshingly different early 50s sci-fi film worth seeing --- this is not a typical ""monster"" from space story --- Instead the alien was a misunderstood sympathetic character stranded on earth and needing help --- He tried to communicate with humans but failed. I like to think that the more technologically advanced a race is, the less violent they might become or need to be --- find a film like this much more believable than a typical 50s ""monster from space"" film like 'The Thing from Another World' (1951), was an excellent film, but the advanced alien in it acted like a killer maniac. Hard to believe he could have built a ship able to travel millions of light years --- This alien in 'Phantom from Space' was also stranded here, but wanted to find a way to communicate and survive in our atmosphere, not kill --- this is refreshingly different from other 50s sci-fi films. In some ways this film reminded me of 'The Man From Planet X' maybe it was the role an unusual looking space suit played in making the alien seem more menacing then he actually was and adding a weird unearthly atmosphere to the film --- The special effects were primitive by todays standards, but got the job done nicely --- all of this just added to my enjoyment of the film.

Case in point is when a car goes by and the headlights leave a streak across the screen. I've been looking for a good copy of this film for quite awhile now and i have finally found it. I thought the picture quality was very good and the sound quality excellant. Other copy's I've seen left a lot to be desired. I've always wondered how some company""s can but out a product of inferior quality and dumb it on the general public when it come from and inferior source. I feel I am being ripped off. But Legend Films has out done them selfs with this film. Good picture and good sound. In my book this one is worth the money. I have not watched the colorized version of the film since I have no interest in faked color film. The color always looks unatural and I prefer my films in there original Black and White and aspect ratios.",1228089600,13,996,4.275132275132275
910775,5,6304680279,"Probably the last thing that the producers of any horror movie want to elicit from their audience is uncontrollable laughter.  But when decades roll on, it is ironically that unintended humor that manages to preserve the absolute best of the worst, while that generation's most acclaimed films fall by the wayside, replaced by a new wave of equally competent yet forgettable films.  So it is that today we behold Phantom from Space, immortalized for its peerless cheesiness and the exploits of its invisible, asteroid-riding namesake.

Nothing illustrates the paradox above quite like the post-mortem treatment of Phantom from Space, which by virtue of its poor quality is now being re-released by Legend Films--not to mention completely re-mastered.  Yes, now you can behold this timeless treasure of science fiction in full, glorious color (though an untouched black and white version is included on the same disc).  For this reason alone, this is probably the must-own version of Phantom from Space--no other DVD will give you the same choice for the same price.",1227571200,3,1065,5.204678362573099

910778,2,6304680279,"In PHANTOM FROM SPACE, director W. L. Wilder presents a typical Alien From Space film.  For most of the first half, the pacing is slow and laborious.  In the popular pseudo-documentary style that characterized many post WWII movies, the narrator informs the viewer that a UFO has appeared over the west coast.  There are several montages of jets taking off to intercept.  After the craft lands, we see that the alien is wearing a space suit that contains what we later learn is a methane-based atmosphere.  At first, the alien is presented as a killer since he causes the deaths of two men.  It is not until later that director Wilder tries something novel--he pictures the alien in a sympathetic light as one who was first attacked by men and he merely responded in kind.  This alien is no blood-drinking carrot monster from THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD.  Here, the alien is marooned on earth and seeks only to survive.  There are the usual military types, cops, pretty girls, and goofy cameramen involved in the chase. Towards the end, we tend to see things from the vantage of the alien. Except for his unusual lung requirements, he is pretty much like anyone else.  What THE PHANTOM FROM SPACE depicts on an admittedly loony level is a movie that contains a subtext not often found in the monster-alien films of the period: namely that the real dramatic center of any movie lies solidly in just how much the audience learns to care about the protagonist.  In this case, the interest was there, even if scripting, pacing, and dialogue were not.",1203724800,,1547,4.713754646840148
910779,3,6304680279,"Strange, and kinda sad, flick about an invisible alien who crashes his ship into the Pacific Ocean and finds Californians attacking him left and right for being, well, an alien. Now, I've been to California, and while they usually don't greet aliens with warmth and friendship, I've never seen people swinging or shooting at them. I mean, who would watch their rich yuppie brats or cook their food? Then again, I never saw an invisible alien during my time there. But wait, how could I? He'd be invisible...I'm giving myself  a headache. Anyway, this alien kills some people in defense, gets hunted around, has his space helmet stolen...which is pretty mean since he needs it to live...tries vainly to communicate with humans.,,this guy just wants to go home. After spending 26 years on this planet, I can understand why. The scientists and feds chasing the alien corner him up inside of a room with a giant telescope, and he finally suffocates to death, therby becoming visible for a few moments before evaporating. Sad, sad movie. Reminds me of those old 60s Marvel monster comics I used to buy at Fat Jacks Comic Crypt as a kid for pennies on the dollar to their value today. You know, the ones where the alien comes peacefully to Earth, but the stupid humans get scared and kill him? Outsiders identify with each other I guess. Cop the Mills Creek 50 Sci-Fi Classics package. PFS is in there, along with Teenagers From Outer Space (my fav), Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, Mesa of Lost Women, Eegah and a gaggle of bad European space flicks.

910780,3,6304680279,"The picture on the box looks much better than the actual phantom, but this movie has its moments.  Though the film was low budget, and there are some silly moments, the film tries to be somewhat serious, and rather than the usual approach to aliens in the 50s, meaning shoot to kill, dissect them, and then ask questions, the people who encounter the phantom make an attempt at communication.  If they would have had better gadgets, perhaps they could have spoken.

A space ship goes from Alaska to California, which seems awfully sensible if you consider the weather in the two states.  Unfortunately, the landing is a bit rougher than the alien had planned, and the alien has to literally come ashore.  Unfortunately for the alien, bizarre-looking space suits were out of season at that time, and the local fashion police attacked him.  The space suited phantom had to kill in order to defend his right to express himself through his uniform.

Unfortunately, killing people is mostly frowned upon in California, so the local gendarmes attempt to track the being down, using super incredible whiz-bang detection equipment.  I was confused as to whether I should be impressed or laugh, so I finally chose rolling my eyes each time I saw a cheesy ""dish"" car.  Just think, a satellite dish on the roof of a car might be all the rage today.

Eventually there is quite a crowd chasing one, poor defenseless alien around.  The alien decides to ditch his space suit to take advantage of his natural invisibility.  Needing to breath the special mixture provided by his suit seemed to advise against taking his space suit off.  The next thing you know the space suit dissolves, except for the helmet.

There is a brief moment where it looks like everyone was going to sit around a campfire and sing ""Kumbaya"" when a goofy reporter sets off a flash bulb, frightening the alien and generally decreasing the low opinion of everyone with respect to reporters.  The frightened alien breaks his helmet, which then quickly dissolves, and then makes a break for the observatory.  Fortunately, his pursuers have ultraviolet lights that enable them to see the alien in a flashy blurry way, so that we can see the exciting climax to the movie.

This movie was decent.  I enjoyed seeing an alien in the position of inadvertent visitor who just wanted to live, while there were also people who wanted him to live.  The first half of the movie is slow, but after everyone ends up in the laboratory building things start picking up.  It is too bad that the atmosphere needed by the alien was not readily available.  If you consider yourself a fan of classic science fiction, I urge you to watch this one because it takes a different approach from other similar movies from that era.  Somehow, I do not see this movie as having been a big hit in theaters.",1138838400,2,2831,4.711382113821138
910781,3,6304680279,"Step 1- Make the alien invader invisible, so you only need to show doors opening and closing, and furniture moving around to indicate the extra-terrestrial presence. Step 2- Cast Z-grade actors and total unknowns in the lead roles. Step 3- Stock footage! Stock footage! Stock footage! Step 4- Only show the alien for a few seconds at the end of the movie. Actually, I happen to like PHANTOM FROM SPACE just fine. It's an average little movie with a decent story-line. I like the idea of an alien who is just trying to survive on our planet, without wanting to destroy us. He's stranded here with no way to communicate with our species! He kills in self-defense, only to be branded a murderer. He tries to make contact, but ends up scaring people instead. This is by no means a perfect movie. There are some lengthy patches of boredom and silliness throughout. At one point, toward the end, the male cast-members see how many times they can say, ""Barbara! Barbara! Where are you?!"", over and over. I still recommend PFS to all science fiction fans.

7875607,3,6304680279,"You can purchase 'Phantom in Space' from Legend Films and you get your choice of watching it
in black & white or color. In addition the picture quality is better even in standard DVD format.

DVD & EXTRA'S: You get the movie in black and white and color versions. Your choice. I'd watch it in color. That is the point of this release.
As for the extra's, there are some trailers and that's it.

PLOT/SUMMARY: A possible flying saucer crashed in California and FCC investigators are sent in. They get reports of a man dressed in a strange outfit. The outfit is something like a diving outfit. The reports also say that they see nobody inside the outfit. There are several deaths related to the sighting of the strange visitor. The police hunt down the alien but the alien is able to get away by removing his space suit. A team of scientists are able to take the suit to a laboratory and discover it is made of extraterrestrial material.

PRODUCTION/COMMENTS: Phantom from Space was released in 1953 during the earlier part of the science fiction craze that started in the 50's.

There is quite a bit of stock footage used.

RECOMMENDATIONS: I'm giving this release 3 stars due to the colorization.  The movie itself is not that good.

This movies are for science fiction completists only. Millennials would be bored to tears with this movie.

Although this movie is known for being bad, I didn't think it was as bad as it's reputation. Of course when you are expecting something to be bad, it isn't usually as bad as you think and vice versa.

Recommended only for fans of black and white science fiction movies and then only if you must have or see everything.",1516492800,,1660,4.581081081081081

7875610,2,6304680279,"I like a good-bad 50's sci fi film as much as the next guy but this was pretty hard to sit through. Made on the cheap with lots of standing around talking science-y. Lots of running around chasing an invisible alien as one minute he was on the top of building, then on the ground, then back on top of the building. I always feel the invisible alien gag in these movies was a cost savings thing rather then truly necessary for the story. I suppose the cheap budget didn't allow for more then a few seconds of the alien towards the end. Unless you are a Theramin fan there are better invisible alien movies like Invaders from Mars or Invisible Invaders. May have been more enjoyable if the Amazon Prime video hadn't been so washed out but this one hour and ten minute movie was about 70 minutes too long.
