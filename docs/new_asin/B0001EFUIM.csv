8011303,5,B0001EFUIM,"If there was an anime character hall of fame, Black Jack would certainly be near the top. The unlicensed doctor is a genius when diagnosing strange diseases, and is also a master of the scalpel. This release comes to us from the people at Central Park Media (CPM,) who are currently defunct, but their anime will live on. CPM is not the best known anime distributor, but this series should of made them more recognizable.

The Black Jack series distributed by CPM is a ten part OVA series directed by Osmau Dezaki from the 90's. This particular release is episodes 3 and 4. The original source material was written by Osamu Tezuka, probably the best known manga artist of all time because of his numerous titles such as Astro Boy and Metropolis. This series does not really look like it was made in the 90's. It looks better than a lot of anime made recently. Due to the director's animation style of freeze frames and split screen, the viewer never feels tired of his work.

The first episode on this DVD is about a woman named Maria, who asks Black Jack to help a military leader revolutionary. Black Jack even performs a tracheotomy in the darkness of night. The only light source is the moon. He must help this man, even though a pseudo-American looking country is gunning for them. The America-like country wants to make the revolutionaries look like drug smuggling terrorists and wants them exterminated otherwise the leader may end up being a martyr.

The next episode is about an actress who suffers symptoms that appear to be anorexia. She does not want to eat, and when she does, she cannot keep the food down. Production for the movie she was working on was put on hiatus, but the director can only prolong the movie for so long. The episode also introduces Black Jack's nemesis, Dr. Kiriko. This doctor specializes in euthanasia. Black Jack makes a living trying to save the people he meets, but Kiriko makes a living out of ending people's lives. He is an interesting character in the Black Jack universe, but this is his only appearance in this OVA series, which is unfortunate.

Overall, these are probably the two best episodes in the Black Jack OVA series, and it is wonderful that both episodes are on one disc, so be sure to check it out.",1381104000,,2257,4.620947630922693
8011304,5,B0001EFUIM,"Because I've purchased all of the Black Jack anime that one can get their hands on I cannot write a review for all of them.  Overall I am very pleased with every title; all of them arrived well packaged, no scratches or shipping problems, exactly as described.  The stories I've watched several times an love them each time.  The impact of multiple genres inside the Black Jack titles is a great mix of horror, drama, comedy, suspense and more - each with their own storyline, well followed and ending perfectly.  Not a lot of ""left in the dark"" from the ""BJ"" series / OVAs, etc.  Highly recommended to any anime watcher, though most I believe should be over 13 at least.",1370563200,,671,4.512396694214876
8011305,5,B0001EFUIM,Black Jack seizure is an awesome 90's anime containing two episodes of the black jack series. Each episode is aprox. 50 minutes long. Black Jack is an uncertified doctor who takes on jobs across the globe and often operates under extreme circumstances.,1334534400,,252,5.023809523809524
8011306,4,B0001EFUIM,A good anime for all fans.  I enjoyed watching Black Jack.  It has a very compelling story and action.  The voice acting is alright and the whole movie flows very nicely.  The only thing i don't like very much is the outdated animation.  That is why i gave it 4 stars.  Other than that is is an okay anime.,1086220800,2,306,4.101694915254237
