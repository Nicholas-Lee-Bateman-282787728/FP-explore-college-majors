8295532,3,B001DZ7Q08,"Big Idea, the makers of Veggie Tales, came out with 3-2-1 Penguins before the movie Madagascar came out.  The movie is very nice, my 2 children like it.  The main lessons in this movie are to be nice to each other, but I don't remember it being profoundly Biblical.  I know that they've put it on qubo in the past, I'm not sure if it's on currently.  We found this at our library, and the kids liked it so much I bought the movie for them.  The 3-2-1 Penguins is no competition for Veggie Tales, Bob and Larry will always hold a special place in my heart.",1324080000,,555,4.149532710280374
