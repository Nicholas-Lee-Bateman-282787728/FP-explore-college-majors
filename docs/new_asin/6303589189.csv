707281,5,6303589189,"If you are a '50s or Grease fan and want to escape today for yesterday,  you will enjoy Gidget. This movie is the story of a girl coming of age,  discovering boy-girl relationships and trying new things, such as surfing.  Gidget is spirited for the '50s and you'll see her mischievous  adventurousness as she tries out social life on the beach. You'll cheer her  on and chuckle as she plans her ""get the guy"" schemes.  You'll  also find the expression of youthful longing and angst in this movie is  superior.  END",908496000,6,514,4.56043956043956

Shot in sunny California during the Camelot years of the American dream, this movie is a charming reprieve from the plethora of hard-edged, foul mouthed, cynical garbage that passes for entertainment today.

707901,5,6303589189,"I had seen this movie on TCM and could not wait to get it. It is such a great movie highlighting all that was good about the 1950s.

707902,5,6303589189,"I absolutely love Gidget. I don't care for the sequels, but the original rocks. It's especially fun seeing the total tacky ""stunts"" on the waves...the body doubles/stunt experts are awful b/c they don't look a thing like the actors. SD's double in the opening snorkeling scene is a riot, yet all this makes it so much more awesome! The music is rockin' and it's just plain fun.",1357516800,,377,4.641791044776119

707904,5,6303589189,"I cannot comment about this particular dvd and its technical shortcomings. However, I have seen the movie several times and I love it each time.  Furthermore, my teenaged daughter loves it too, so that's why I call it a classic.  The timeless story of first love, the angst of adolescence and coming of age, the perfect casting (love Gidget's dad!  Soo funny), Sandra Dee's charisma and beauty, and of course, heartthrob singer James Darren all combine together for a fun and engaging movie.  It was a lesson for my daughter of how things used to be - when a guy came to the door in a suit and tie (or at least dressed decently) to meet the parents before taking a girl out on a date.  How different from the, ""let's hang out"" and hookup culture of the present day.  A perfect movie to share with your teenaged daughter, or reminisce about the old days.",1334275200,,853,4.470967741935484
707905,1,6303589189,"It's a disgrace that so many classic films remain on the shelf but it's really rubbing salt into my wounds to release ""Gidget"" in full frame format when the beloved original was released in Cinemascope. Full frame, pan & scan is at least fifteen years out of date. It's 2012 and Giget (Kathy Zuckerman) was voted one of the ten most influential surfers of all time not too many years back by one of the leading Surfer mags. Sandra Dee is one of the all time teen dreams ever. Period, no conversation please. This evening I was enjoying spending some time with the original Gidget, Kathy Kohner Zuckerman, by way of her dad's book from which the film was adapted.  So, I just thought I'd order a copy for the video library here at home.  No widescreen, no order.  Gidget, better than many other films of the era attempted to capture a time and a place familiar to those of us who grew up in Southern California and those around the world who wanted a piece of it.  With Sandra Dee it was love at first sight as I saw the film at the long gone Orange Drive-In Theatre in Orange, California. Tears still come to my eyes when I see the film in widescreen remembering those days of endless summer, sun, surf and girls such as Sandra. Even a brief appearance by The Four Preps doing one of their most forgettable songs is pure gold.  James Darren provides a fine to this day version of the title song and Cliff Robertson must certainly still be searching for that perfect wave. Many tried to copy the magic of Gidget but few succceded including the three or so Gidget follow-ups provided with this current set. Gidget in Rome?  Who cares?  Gidget was Malibu and Kathy (Gidget) still is. Let us have back those sweeping views of surf and sand.  Gidge...sweetheart, we miss you.  Give us the widescreen and I, for one, am back.

708000,3,6303589189,"The reputation of the original ""Gidget"" (1959) has eroded over the years thanks to two weak sequels and a truly dreadful television series. So if you have never seen the original don't dismiss it based on the extremely shallow content of the Gidget stuff that came later. While not a good double-feature match for ""Rebel Without a Cause"", it is dark and serious enough to still have some relevance

While presenting a rather tame portrait of California's surf and beatnik counterculture, it fits solidly with the better coming-of-age/generational revolution stuff of the 1950's and 60's.

Sixteen year-old Francis Lawrence (Sandra Dee at her most innocent) is the film's title character; girl plus midget equals Gidget. Dee managed to avoid the other two features and the television series but not fatal type casting. She would become more associated with ""Tammy"" than any other character. Although soon to be a teen idol, looking at her films it is probably difficult for today's audiences to understand her appeal. She was a talented actress with an especially good performance in ""The Young and the Innocent"" but was never able to transcend the teen idol stigma.

Francis and her more mature and boy hungry friends (watch for ""Batgirl's"" Yvonne Craig) start their summer vacation trolling the beach for excitement. Francis doesn't really like boys but she can see that they will inevitably become a big factor in her life. Rescued by a boy named Moondoggie (James Darren who was never much of an actor but would also develop into quite a teen idol), Francis is introduced to the surf culture (watch for ""Billy Jack's"" Tom Laughlin). She is both attracted and repelled by the hedonist freedom and the inherent hypocrisy of the culture's preoccupation with money. In no sense is she the ditzy Gidget later portrayed on television by Sally Fields.

There is a pervasive sexual undertone to the film with the possible loss of Gidget's virginity a unifying theme. But she is essentially a child, and the three main male characters are each protective of her in their own way. Along with Moondoggie are her clueless father (Arthur O'Connell) and The Big Kahuna (Cliff Robertson).

Robertson is a combat veteran (Korea) who has basically dropped out and is living in a shack on the beach. Robertson does a good job in a challenging rol, as The Big Kahuna alternates between the seriousness he would soon bring to his portrayal of Jack Kennedy in ""PT-109"" and the manic qualities of a Dick Shawn character.

Ultimately some irony is introduced as ""Moondoggie"" turns out to be Jeffrey Mathews, the clean-cut boy Mr. Lawrence has been trying all summer to persuade his daughter to date. Their summer at the beach is just a transitional point on the road to a ranch house in Sherman Oaks.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1164844800,4,2827,4.901673640167364
708001,5,6303589189,"It seems that while I was growing up, my best friend and I could not have a sleepover or a slumber party without watching ""Gidget"" and ""Grease"". We rented the former one day and we loved it instantly, slightly dated as it is. We totally identified with Gidget (the adorable Sandra Dee, God rest her soul), who summed up the innocence and longing of teenage love. Our favorite lines were, ""Yeah, but what if the young man doesn't know you're alive?"" and, "" 'To be a real woman is to bring out the best in a man.' Tell that to the boys today."" We, of course, couldn't help but remark, ""More like today!"" It's easy to see why this film inspired so many beach movies of the 60s. We found it particularly amusing how protective and neurotic Gidget's father (Arthur O'Connell) was, and how he wanted her to date suitable college boys. And James Darren was so great as Moondoggie, and he even got to croon a great love tune! It's priceless when Gidget gets one of the surf boys, Hot Shot, to help her make Moondoggie jealous, and Hot Shot backs out of their deal, and Moondoggie steps up to the plate, completely unaware that he was the intended target. Gidget then pretends that it's the Big Kahuna (a young, buff, and tanned Cliff Robertson) she's out to get, and ends up getting in a little deeper than she planned to.

Of course, it all works out in the end. But this movie is a treasure. Now that it's available on DVD, so many people can enjoy it. It takes you back to a simpler time, but at the same moment you can identify with the characters. You may even want to learn how to surf. Best of all, it is a great tribute to Sandra Dee, in her most famous role. ""Gidget"" is one in a million.",1141257600,,1689,4.294670846394984

708004,5,6303589189,"This movie always makes me think of sitting in a musty hotel room somewhere on the west coast, rained in, with a bowl of popcorn, my best friend and a cold pizza. Gidget was always our ""nothing better to do, so lets have a giggle"" movie. It is the quintessence of the early 60's beach movie, and as such can be rather painful to watch if you're not of the right mindset, but ohhh, when you are! Its the kind of movie to just tickle you pink and wipe all your worries away for a couple of hours.
The movie revolves around Francie Lawrence who is the perfect 1950's girl next door. Good at school, plays the cello, daddy's girl, exuberant tomboy with the shiny blonde locks. Francie isn't exactly ""manhunt"" material and her friends let her know it ... so instead she goes off and does tomboy things and gets herself caught up with a gang of summer break beach-bum wannabes headed by The Great Kahuna [the only real beach-bum in the bunch], and Moondoggie, who she of course falls for [A young Jimmy Darren folks. Who wouldn't?]. Francie takes up surfing herself and is adopted as the group mascot, the boys giving her the very politically incorrect nickname of ""Gidget"" [Girl+Midget].
Along her way to trying to get Moondoggie to see her as more than just a ""crazy kid"", she does a good deal of growing up, gets a VERY 50s-esque sex talk from her perfectly coiffed homemaker mother, and learns a valuable lesson or two from Grandma's old sampler.
Its charm is in its kitsch, its liveliness, its sun-shiny disposition. This movie is actually, genuinely cute, and its hard for me not to smile when I watch it. No matter how awful a day I've had. Of all the Gidget films, THIS is the most fun. The songs will stay with you for days afterwards, the script is genuinely sweet and funny even if it is a little hokey, and Sandra Dee is the best Gidget there ever was.
As the Gidge herself would say, Its The Absolute Ultimate!",1047340800,20,1917,4.448863636363637
708005,5,6303589189,I think this movie is a movie EVERYONE loves. It is such a great movie and it was a start of a new era of movies. Sandra Dee is such a great actress and out of all of the GIDGET movies/ shows i think she was the best girl to play the role. I love this movie (Gidget) so much that i I've have watched all of the 50s' and 60s' movies and by far this is the best! I hope you all enjoy this movie and the others.,1032134400,9,408,3.595505617977528
708006,5,6303589189,I think Sandra Dee is the best Gidget.  The movie is cute and well worth the price.  Good for watching on one of those rainy days when you're cozy at home and want a lighthearted movie to watch.,1024358400,5,194,4.078947368421052

708058,5,6303589189,"If you enjoy fun, wholesome, fifties romantic comedy, this is for you. Sandra Dee is at her most adorable, and is delightfully tossed into a romantic triangle with smoldering Cliff Robertson and handsome crooner-actor, James Darren.
Gidget is a flat-chested teenager who is surrounded by over-developed girls her age who want to play boy-girl romance games Gidget could care less about. All she wants to do is surf, and the fact that some of the guys who are teaching her how are extremely sexy doesn't interest her at all--until she falls for one of them!
Of the three Gidget movies, this is the only one starring Sandra Dee, and, to me, the best of the lot. The energy is high, the characters charming, and there is a lot of poignancy along with the fun due to the excellent acting of Dee and Robertson in particular. Well worth adding to your feel-good collection!",1006646400,2,867,4.7105263157894735

She becomes friends with a group of surfer boys who teach her how.  She also develops a crush on one of them (Moondoggie).
As the movie progresses we watch Gidget learn about life and love.  We watch her get her heart broken, and then find happiness in the end.
Gidget is a great movie to watch with your friends--it's probably not a movie that guys would enjoy, so save it for a girls night!",1003276800,12,541,4.1826923076923075
708060,5,6303589189,I think this movie was the best movie I've ever seen. It taught me alot about life and love.. and burning it off with older men. I really think Gidget is a character we can all relate to. Moondoggie is the hunk we girls have been ga ga over since we first laid eyes on him. He is so studly.

708061,5,6303589189,"There were three films centering on the perky, fun-loving beach bunny, Gidget. This was the first and by far the best!!!!!  Pert and pretty Sandra Dee was seventeen and at her liveliest and most appealing when she made this cute little flick. She is absolutely irresistable in the title role, a cute, fun-loving American teenage girl who would rather hit the beach than chase after boys like her other girlfriends. However, when she meets two handsome beachbums, Gidget goes a little boy-crazy herself and experiences first love in the process. This is a warm, charming, and funny movie. I have no doubt that this is the film that made Sandra Dee such a popular star. It's easy to see why she became the idol of so many American girls and boys alike. If you're looking for good, clean and solid fun, then GIDGET is the movie for you!!!!!",969926400,21,837,4.655405405405405

One of the things I like best about Gidget is the genuine love between Gidget and Moondoggie. Gidget learns surfing  because she is not interested in joining her more buxom friends ""man  hunting.""  But, soon Gidge has two surfers after her. In the end, Dad  sets her up on a blind date. But guess who has the last laugh! I recommend  this for everyone!",963705600,8,454,4.345238095238095

7853134,4,6303589189,"If you grew up in the sixties there is no doubt that you were exposed to the genre of film known as the beach movie. The most notable stars of the genre were Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello but there were others who dipped their toes in the salty waters of the Pacific as well. One of those was Sandra Dee in a little film called GIDGET.

The movie opens with the early teen Francie Lawrence (Dee) and her friends preparing for a trip to the beach. The other girls are just interested in meeting boys but Francie hasn't quite been bitten by the bug for male companionship just yet. While the others display themselves a bit suggestively, Francine keeps more of herself covered.

Swimming in a mask and snorkel she gets caught in some kelp and one of the surfers on the beach named Moondoggie (James Darren) rescues her on his board. Having experienced riding the board now Francine wants to try as well. Told she needs a board of her own she negotiates with the guy on the beach making them.

The next day she arrives with her money but the guys joke about not wanting to teach her. The main beach bum, The Big Kahuna (Cliff Robertson), takes her under his wing and begins instructing her. She takes to it naturally and is soon a sort of mascot for the rest of the gang, given the nickname of Gidget. While they view her as their kid sister things begin to change for Francine.

She begins to notice Moondoggie more and falls for him. Her summer at the beach that began with no intention of looking for romance is slowly changing. The question that comes to mind though is does Moondoggie have the same thing in mind as well or does he still see her as the kid he saved from drowning?

Like most beach movies the film takes a simplistic look at the times and the people involved offering little depth to them. The lone exception is Robertsons character, an older man who left the world behind to surf the waves of the world and who the rest, mainly Moondoggie, look up to as an example of what they want to become, free and easy without a care in the world. Except that not all is as it seems.

The movie also differs from most in the genre in that it doesnt play things strictly for laughs like the Frankie and Annette films did. There are no broadly played characters here on display. These seem like real people, as real as a beach movie can get, with real issues they're trying to resolve. At the same time it is a time capsule for the period, a time when mom and dad were an integral part of their childrens lives while at the same time not understanding them or being there 24/7. Its that wholesome style of film that many deride as far too fake but that makes for an enjoyable movie none the less.

Dee is wonderful here as the innocent young girl who is growing up while we watch. She has a charm and an appeal about her without being thought of as sexy. Shes the girl next door who you liked that would eventually blossom into a young woman. Darren does a fine job as well, playing the well to do son of a businessman who wants move in his future. And Robertson as the beach bum with a past shows why he was such a good actor.

The film resulted two sequels, neither of which starred Dee but both having Darren return. It also spawned a TV series with a young Sally Field in the title role. Later there were TV movies made with the character as well.

Twilight Time is offering this in their usual high quality style with a great picture on display here. Again, extras are limited. They include an isolated music track and the original theatrical trailer. As always they are limiting this to just 3,000 copies so if you're a fan of beach movies or of Gidget then make sure you pick one up today.",1515024000,,3709,4.317528735632184

7853139,5,6303589189,"I watched Gidget a lot. I rented it from Blockbuster regularly as a kid in the 90s.  I now own it through Amazon, and am so glad.  The quality is so much better than it had been when I saw it on VHS.

Sandra Dee is ""the ultimate"" and I relate a lot to her - I was a tom boy who was skinny and underdeveloped.  I wanted to have fun.  This is what Gidget is like, but she also wants a relationship with guys too and to find ""the one"", which is how I was (I married my first boyfriend).

Just some things to keep in mind with this movie (content wise), they tease Gidget a lot, and not necessarily in a nice way.  She has a good attitude about things.  Also she tries to throw herself at an older man in order to get someone jealous.  There are a few people shown in bikinis too in this.  A teen drinks a beer as well.  I don't remember if any teens are smoking, but an adult man is smoking a cigar at one point.

This is one of my all time favorite summer movies!
If I had a daughter, I'd want her to see this (but alas, I have two sons who didn't seem too interested when I tried to get them to see it with me).",1499990400,,1110,3.8201754385964914
