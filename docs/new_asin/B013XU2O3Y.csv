This superlative disc can be seen as a sequel to the recording of Coriglianos Third Symphony (Circus Maximus) by Junkin and his expert student band (see Fanfare 32:5, 34:4, and 34:5); and unlike most sequels, its just as strong as the original. In fact, some listeners may prefer it. Granted, none of the three composers hereall born between 1972 and 1977has Coriglianos name recognition; nor, more relevant to the discs quality, does any of them have the sheer timbral panache so vividly on display in Circus Maximus. But these three worksall, like the Corigliano, utilizing antiphonal effectsare free from the ideological overlay, simultaneously browbeating and equivocal, that complicates our experience with Circus Maximus; and they also avoid the Respighian over-the-topness that many find uncongenial in the Corigliano, too.

Most immediately affecting is the central work, Joel Pucketts Shadow of Sirius for solo flute, wind band, percussion, and a distant choir of six flutes at the rear of the hall. It was written as the composer and his wife were suffering from the emotional devastation of a miscarriagea heartbreak, he says, that left me unsure of how to even breathe, let alone grieve. Through W. S. Merwins poetry and the act of composition it inspired, he was able to heal. The connection between the music and the poetry is close (the score is punctuated by quotations from the poems). But Shadow of Sirius is neither a depiction of the texts nor a commentary on them; in fact, Puckett confesses that I have almost no idea what most of this poetry means. Rather, the music is a looser kind of response to the restorative power of Merwins art. It begins with sustained chords on piano, harp, and percussion overlaid by echoing calls from the six distant flutes, opening up a vast sense of space. What emerges is an often Impressionistic work, a deeply comforting meditation on loss, moving from that suggestive opening, through a mournful lamentation, on to a gorgeous finale, where a radiant transfiguration of the opening brings, in its wake, a tender sense of solace.

Kingfishers Catch Fire, by John Mackey (not irrelevantly, a Corigliano student), is less emotionally profound, but its similarly ear-catching. Its a diptych portraying kingfishers, described by the composer as extremely shy birds. The gentle, texturally unassuming, and timbrally muted first movement represents them leaving their nests after a rain; the driving and often jazzy second movement, with clear debts to John Adams, Copland, and Stravinsky, represents the brilliance of the birds in flight, ending with a glorious halo of sound reinforced by the slightly out-of-sync trumpets surrounding us in the hall.

The disc opens with the Concerto for Wind Ensemble by Steven Bryant, another Corigliano student. Its the longest, grandest, most abstract, and most overtly virtuosic of the three works and, stylistically, the most wide-ranging. It begins with a thick, dissonant, and contentious web of overlapping trill-laden woodwind lines that may remind you of the opening of The Rite of Springand it ends with a blazing toccata that, more than anything else in the piece, takes the fullest advantage of the bands force and its antiphonal placement. Between these two pillars, the piece wanders from evocative transparency (listen to the forlorn glissandos on the flutes toward the beginning of the second movement) through dark sobriety to floor-rattling exuberance; passages that, according to the composer, are inspired by early Webern rub against moments that summon up jazz or the sassy spirit of Bernstein. Its a piece that shifts gears in a way that keeps you consistently off balance; yet for all its dizzying variety, its held together by an upward five-note figure thats heard at the very beginning and that returns, in a rich variety of nonetheless recognizable forms, throughout the piece, finally crowning the works frantic climax.

The performances are first-class. Marianne Gedigian is magnificently hypnotic in the Puckett, and the skill of the student ensemble is evident in its coloristic vividness, exceptional balances, and rhythmic point. And although you can fault Naxos for the unconscionably skimpy notes (doubly annoying with such unfamiliar music) and failure to include the texts of the poems, there can be no complaints about the sound, which in timbral accuracy and spatial effect is perhaps the best Ive ever heard from this company. Obviously, band enthusiasts will want to snap this upbut its a top priority for a broader audience as well.",1450915200,6,4602,5.2388059701492535
