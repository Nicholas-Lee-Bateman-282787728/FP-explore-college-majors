8225609,1,B000WTZ6GM,"1 Star for this movie is way too generous.  If you are considering watching this, remove all sharp objects from your home.  I thought I had watched bad movies/acting before.  This one has topped the chart.  Highly disappointed in the cast of this film.  How bad can it be you may ask?  It is an experience in itself.  All of the Actors appear to be trying to out act(epic failures all around) each other over a script (if that's what you call it) that would seem to be almost all improv.  Very sad... very sad excuse for entertainment.  Defies any near definition of entertainment.  Save your time.  Pass on this movie.  IMO",1356393600,,624,4.473214285714286
8225610,1,B000WTZ6GM,"I was saddened when David Carradine died but not surprised by how he died. Carradine was a wild man both onscreen and off and he made no secrets about that. It was this quality that made him so much fun to watch. What made him bearable in so many horrible straight to video films that he frequently appeared in. I've sat through my fair share of these clunkers. Films like 'Monster Hunter', 'Guaranteed On Delivery', 'The Last Sect' and even a David Faustino film for God's sake. 'Last Hour' isn't as bad as some of them but it isn't any better either.

Five thieves (including Michael Madsen, DMX, and the film's auteur writer/director Kobe) each receive a mysterious letter inviting them to an abandoned mansion in the middle of nowhere. The letters have supposedly been written by their dead fathers, all thieves themselves, who promise their sons they will not only learn how they died but also where the treasure they kept hidden is. I think that's what it's about but I don't really  know nor do I care. What the film is actually about is watching terrible acting from the likes of Madsen, DMX, Kobe, Paul Sorvino and whoever the hell plays Mr. Casino. I thought this was supposed to be 'Last Hour' not 'Amateur Hour'. For example each one of the thieves is referred to by their nickname. Madsen is known as The Monk. Why is he called that you don't ask? It's because before he kills someone he always makes the sign of the cross. The film's only good parts involve Carradine as a cop a week away from retirement who gets the thankless task of playing negotiator with the bad guys. Fun fact: Penelope Cruz's sister plays his hot partner.

I don't know what else to say other than I'm almost positive I put more thought into this review than Kobe did his entire screenplay. The sound on the DVD is horrendous with dialogue barely audible and everything else echoing. If for some reason you wanted to hear what the actors are saying you couldn't. This was a recent film of Carradine's made in his last couple of years so fans might be curious about seeing it for that reason. Believe me it's not worth your time. He definitely livens things up and is good for laughs but his scenes are few and far between. You'll be doing a lot of fast forwarding to get to them.",1261008000,5,2267,4.510948905109489
8225611,1,B000WTZ6GM,"I wish I could describe the film's plot, but sorry, I can't. There is none. All I can remember is five guys (of notorious reputations, like assassin, debt collector, martial artist, etc.) summoned by a letter and they arrive at the entrance of the same building, swearing and giggling like any ""bad"" guys would do. Then a mysterious lady (named ""Poison"") opens the door to let them in. Soon, however, these cardboard characters (with such names as ""Black Jack"" and ""Monk"") realize that they are trapped inside the building, which is surrounded by the police. Sounds interesting?

Sorry. It is not. Actually, the ""plot"" goes on and on without getting any better at all, as if trying to make us fall asleep. I imagine whoever made this incoherent film wanted to be a Quentin Tarantino (""Last Hour"" includes two stars from the ""Kill Bill"" saga, Michael Madsen and David Carradine) with a few ""clever"" twists in the story, but the result is simply dreadful. The film's muddled story makes no sense. Worse, this is not even a ""so-bad-so-good"" film. It is no fun watching this, just waste of time. Actions? None. Acting? Forget about it. You don't even get decent photography.

These five guys, all exchanging terrible dialogues, are played by Michael Madsen, DMX, Pascal Caubet, Kwong Leung Wong, and Tony D'Amario. Don't ask me why, but Paul Sorvino appears as some character you really don't care. His appearance, mercifully brief though, only makes me sad because, you know, he was in ""Goodfellas"" after all. What he is doing in this mess? Oh, and don't forget Mnica Cruz. Surely she resembles her sister Penlope Cruz ... just in case you are interested.

The film is unwatchable. I am trying to find most suitable word or phrase to describe this incredibly confusing ""Last Hour,"" but I can't. ""Mess"" is too kind a word. I can tell you with confidence that this one will instantly become one of the worst films you've ever seen, worse than much criticized ""Battlefield Earth."" At least it wasn't boring.",1246233600,2,2001,4.82798833819242

8225615,1,B000WTZ6GM,"First off, I don't make it a habit to write movie reviews, good or bad, but for this movie I've made an exception. The Last Hour was just terrible, and not just in the usual sense that the acting stinks, writing stinks, or that the plot/story is terrible, but that it is also terribly produced and edited. Seriously, it looks like a high school student-film that happened to get DMX to star in it. Now, I like DMX, in fact, he was the reason I wanted to see this. He was awesome in Belly, Decent in Cradle to the Grave and Exit Wounds, but not even he could save this trainwreck of a film. Why David Carradine agreed to be in this, I'll never know, and Michael Madsen, well, he's a B-movie star these days anyway, so it won't hurt his lack of a career.

So really, if you want to see this movie just be prepared that it is like nothing you've seen before. They should show this movie at film-schools throughout the world him hopes that future directors will not allow such atrocities to occur again.

I'd give it a negative star if I could.",1214265600,3,1040,4.274111675126903
