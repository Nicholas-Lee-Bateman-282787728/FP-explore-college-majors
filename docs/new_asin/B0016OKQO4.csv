3161967,5,B0016OKQO4,"This interesting film follows the life of a lady from Texas from her very early years in the late 19th century through her passing in the late 1960s. While the title intimates that the character has wealth, the true wealth of the character comes from her spirit in overcoming advertisies, the loss of a child, death of her husband while a young woman, raising her remaining children during the depression, etc.  Acting throughout the film is very good and thanks to the good writing of the best-selling book the scriptwriting is based on, the story does not fall into the trap of becoming sappy. The attention to detail in costuming, sets, etc. make the several hours of this mini-series a delight.  The story is engaging and you will wish it could go on longer at the end.
  This film reminded me of some of the better BBC productions but in an American setting.  I am not sure guys would love it, but it is a great chick-flick.",1225411200,48,929,4.538922155688622

3161990,1,B0016OKQO4,"In the first place it is so dadgummed slow I thought I would die of boredom.  And THEN to top it off......that ridiculous accent of Sally Field's is not even close to being a Dallas/Ft. Worth accent.  Where on earth did that come from?  She might have been in GONE WITH THE WIND as Scarlett but not a Dallas person.  Oh my gosh.  What a joke.  Pathetic.  I just don't think I can bring myself to watch the parts 3 & 4 and have told a friend I will gladly GIVE it to her.  Oddly enough I loved the book years ago.
We have lived here in D/FW metroplex for 48 years.  I feel I'm pretty familiar with what sounds Texan and what does NOT!",1377734400,,633,4.0

3161995,5,B0016OKQO4,"I began reading the book on holidays - it was in the unit I stayed. Sally Field is the perfect actor to play Bess: the small, oh-so-very- proper upperclass lady with a heart and attitude way before her times.

3162022,4,B0016OKQO4,"Although this 1995 miniseries seems to be little known and mostly forgotten, fans of the Sally Field tear-jerker should give this a watch.  The story follows Bess Steed from girlhood to old age.  Ms. Field brings a unique level of performance to make her audience feel the hurt, anger, and the sting of tears as she deals with injury, sickness, death and even suicide during the course of her life.  You can't help but get caught up in this wonderfully told story of life, love and loss.  I often found myself cheering for, and crying with the lovely Bess.
Other notable actors and actresses include Tony Gold of Ghost fame, Charles Durning, Ron Silver, the wonderful Brenda Fricker, and Jack Thompson as the ever present Sam round out the cast of characters.",1323216000,8,759,4.7272727272727275

3162024,4,B0016OKQO4,"In the 1980's, television did much to educate, as well as to entertain the masses.  This miniseries was one of many to be brought to the small screen in a big way.  The story telling was excellent, the acting and sets superb.
It is a shame that it became cost prohibitive to continuuing to bring such great entertainment to the masses. But thanks to the different production companies, transferring them to DVD for viewing by future audiences, one can still find good, informative, and entertaining fare on your TV today.",1296345600,5,521,4.777777777777778
3162025,5,B0016OKQO4,"This movie is my all-time favorite movie! I like movies and books about strong, independent women and this character is up there with Scarlett.  The scenery is beautiful, the story is uplifting and engaging to watch.  All of the actors really pull you into the story. Sally is one of the actors to pull off a Southern accent that doesn't seem forced or fake and I'm from Texas so I should know.

When I just want to relax and watch a movie that I love every part of, I watch this one.  I never tire of it.",1294012800,6,505,4.175257731958763
3162056,5,B0016OKQO4,I was so happy to find this mini-series here at Amazon- I saw this on T.V. years ago when it played all the way through in one day and I had just had some surgery and was laid up so I watched the whole thing. Sally Field gives a wonderful performance and there are many other actor's you will recognize and they all give such great performances. If you are looking for a movie that you will want to watch over and over this is it. It does have some very sad scenes so if you can't take that kind  of thing this probably isn't a movie for you. If you love period pieces this movie follows the main character's life over 70 years so you see many wonderful costumes and settings.

3162062,2,B0016OKQO4,Don't waste your money.  The miniseries is long and boring.  I love Sally Fields but the script sucked.  They jump from time to time to time (ten and twenty years in time) without enough substance in the year they were in previously.  She goes from being very young to middle age to old and somehow the stories were left out. Very poor writing. I'd pass on this one.,1264550400,2,366,4.338235294117647
