8448979,2,B004YWEULK,This might be better for the person looking for the active watcher.  I was looking for something more restful.  The images move along too fast and do not necessarily make me feel relaxed.,1381276800,2,187,4.636363636363637
8448980,3,B004YWEULK,I bought AMOS Rise on blu ray a few years ago so thought I'd take the chance and get this one even though it's not blu ray. The key thing people need to know about this video is the content is almost exactly the same as Rise. Seems silly to have purchased this when I already have the blu ray of Rise. I hope Amazon will take it back even though it's opened. They've been very good in the past about understanding about returns. Gave it 3 stars because it's a good video but they need to tell people it's the virtually the same dvd as Rise.,1360886400,,540,4.05607476635514
8448981,5,B004YWEULK,"I had sampled some of AMOStv's products before in hotels, and was always very impressed with both the photography used as well as the musical pairings.  If you're looking for something a bit more mellow to use for ambience while doing a light workout, yoga, or similar activities, I would highly recommend Rest.",1356566400,,311,4.867924528301887
8448982,4,B004YWEULK,"This DVD is 100 minutes of music and visuals aimed at providing a restful, calming ambience.  It does that very well.

There are 33 segments of about 3 minutes each.  The main menu allows you to play it straight through, play the segments randomly, or select specific segments to watch.  The visuals emphasize outdoor nature, animals, people in meditative or prayerful modes, and outer space.  Aerial views of traffic flow in cities sound out of place, but they are mesmerizing.

The music is varied also: Mozart piano concerto excerpt, a hymn, plainchant, original or new compositions.  Orchestral, solo instrument, and vocal music are included.

This is not straight ""elevator music:"" my attention was riveted throughout most of the disc.  My complaints are minor.  Some of the shots from moving aircraft were slow motion which caused some jerkiness in the pictures.  Some description of the material used would be nice.

In summary, quite pleasant.",1340755200,,951,5.143790849673203
8448983,5,B004YWEULK,"This DVD is a breathtaking ambient experience.
I guarantee you will find at least a dozen moments of wonder, and the soundtrack is pure MAGIC.",1310774400,,142,4.72
