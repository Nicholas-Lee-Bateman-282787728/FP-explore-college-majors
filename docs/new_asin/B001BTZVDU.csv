8284908,5,B001BTZVDU,"I love that this is a bare bones DVD. It doesn't repeat the theme song over and over after and or before each episode, which makes viewing much easier and nicer. My daughter loves it, and I have to admit that I enjoy watching it with her. Very cute little show, and the price is right for the amount of viewing time!",1290124800,,316,4.112903225806452

8284910,5,B001BTZVDU,"Very happy to have found this DVD.  Granddaughter loves Miffy and these are not available in stores in our area.  Colors and simplicity are great for ""little ones"".  Service and delivery from seller was excellent.",1263168000,,213,5.0285714285714285
8284911,5,B001BTZVDU,"I bought this video because I could no longer record them on nickelodeon as they quit airing it.... My oldest, now 5.5 yr old son, was a HUGE Miffy fan. So when my next child ""came along"" I wanted to introduce him to Miffy, too. They are 33 months apart. Unfortunately, its not aired on TV anymore. I like the Miffy videos because the graphics are what I consider acceptable. I do not like fast moving, busy, hurried graphics, etc. I highly recommend this if you are concerned about over-stimulation of videos.... Now, this is not to imply in any way that it is boring !!! On the contrary. Miffy is VERY engaging. And remember, you must ""judge"" it through the eyes of a two-year old +/-.
I would prefer to be able to purchase the actual videos that were aired on TV, but this is all I could find. Hope this helps.",1232582400,5,813,4.3202614379084965

8284913,4,B001BTZVDU,"This is a bare bones DVD with no bonus features and no activity bumpers in between shorts. There are no previews to wade through, and the disc auto plays in its entirety after a 10-second countdown displayed onscreen. It's a bit short for the price (runs less than 40 minutes, Amazon incorrectly listed it at 60 minutes at time of this post), but includes some shorts not previously available on US DVD.
