1732065,5,B000069HXH,"Do you lke to laugh? Do you like British comedy? This is worth it if you do. A delightful ensemble cast that ranges in age from young, to middle age, to older middle age, to old, one of the best things England does with their comedies, includes everyone just like real life. All of the cast are great providing lots of laughs. Enjoy.",1215216000,,333,4.301587301587301
1732066,5,B000069HXH,Classic Comedy with British Sense of Humor. Laughable plots and unforgetable charactors are what is in this series. I can't stop watching them.,1207526400,,143,5.260869565217392
1732067,3,B000069HXH,"This volume is certainly not the strongest in the series. If you want to collect the whole series, then certainly you'll have to get it.  If you're like me and slowly building your collection disc by disc, this one can wait.

As some of the other reviewers have pointed out, this well-loved series sometimes has bits that are outright racist and sexist, and therefore very uncomfortable to watch.  I try to view these parts as a historial reminder of what life used to be like and what used to be considered acceptable.  Therefore, they are actually educational (and unpleasant) cultural artifacts that testify to changing societal mores.  So while we still have a long way to go, some progress has been made.",1102118400,,709,4.778688524590164
1732068,2,B000069HXH,"The editorial description above is actually listing the episodes in volume 11 which can also be found in the AYBS? Seasons 6-10 boxed set.  Volume 4 is also available in the Seasons 1-5 boxed set--both sets I highly recommend.
AYBS? is one of my favorite sitcoms, but this particular volume does not showcase the best this long-running series had to offer. Of the six episodes in volume 4, the best, by far, is Forward Mr. Grainger where Mr. Grainger takes over for Mr. Rumbold and all the power goes to his head to the point where he fires his long-time nemesis Mrs. Slocombe.  Rarely has the Grace Brothers staff seemed so happy to see Mr. Rumbold than when he returned to relieve them of Grainger's reign of terror.  The rest of the episodes are mediocre at best.
We never see the ""Great Gatsby"" promotion in New Look.  It ends with just a silly dance routine.  There are more dance routines in Christmas Crackers and Top Hat and Tails, the latter of which seems a pointless show where the staff learns to ballroom dance for a company competition.  The scene where the staff suffers through the customary company Christmas lunch and the funny costumes they wear makes Christmas Crackers worth the time.  No Sale is one of the better episodes in this set.  Here, Mr. Rumbold has the staff opening earlier (8:30 am, which doesn't seem THAT early) to improve sales.  Seeing that the strategy is working, the staff sabotage their sales techniques so the early opening will not continue.  The worst of this set, though, is Fire Practice.  The first part of this episode has the staff trying to accommodate a group of Arabs.  I find this scene to be in very poor taste for its racist undertones.  AYBS? was an excellent series, but this batch of episodes makes for a poor sampling.  If, by rare chance, you have not seen this British comedy before and want to give it a try, opt for volume 1 or 2.",1073347200,,1894,4.56508875739645
1732089,5,B000069HXH,"Anything of Are You Being Served is 5 stars anytime.  Funniest comedy I have ever seen.  The Brits have the upper hand when it comes to good sitcoms and comedy.  We should be so lucky to have such good and funny shows here in the states.  Are you Being Served stands the test of time.  If you want to burst out laughing while watching TV, you will love any of their shows.",1460678400,,372,4.111111111111111

1732097,5,B000069HXH,"Are You Being Served? successfully ran for over 10 years with very little cast turnover.  The crew built themselves an empire on the BBC with the viewing audience.

I am so excited because this is another of the British sitcoms taken off of my PBS station when it was sold! I can't live without Mr. Humphries, he absolutely made the show, in my opinion of course. From Mrs. Slocum to Mr. Lucas, this on of Britian's greatest! I can watch each episode again and again! Thanks to the seller and to Amazon for selling this to me!

1732118,4,B000069HXH,"This volume of AYBS is just as expected. It's funny. The earlier episodes such as on this volume were the best in my opinion. Once Mr. Lucas was replaced by Mr. Spooner the series went downhill. It is nice to see these shows so nice and clear after so many years of watching them on PBS.The cast bios are a nice touch,but don't expect a lot of extras.",1283040000,,351,4.176470588235294
