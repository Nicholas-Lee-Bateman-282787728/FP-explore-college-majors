7911167,2,B00000INGQ,"For a B type film Caged Women 2 is not too bad! Director/Star Ivan Rogers does a fine job acting and brings his character to life. Acting by other members of the cast is not too good but i would have to give them an A for  trying. I not only found this movie entertaining but i was in it (I am one  of the faces at the start of the film). I thought the color and sound used  in the film were excellent and was actually better than what i thought it  would be. Ivan Rogers got the most out of what he had for this film which  reflects favorably upon his directing and acting ability. For something to  do on a rainy day why not rent or buy this movie, sit back with some  popcorn, and enjoy. Don't forget to shuffle the kids into another room as  parts of this film are for adults only.",964915200,,785,3.9554140127388533
