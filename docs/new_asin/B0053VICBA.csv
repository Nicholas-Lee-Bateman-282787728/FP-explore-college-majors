8455776,5,B0053VICBA,"The cinematography, landscapes and songs are quite impressive.  The story line of police corruption and betrayal juxtaposed to reincarnation was intriguing.  Romance, innocence, and freedom to choose  are  the icing on the cake.  The viewer gets involved with the story right from the start.  It  kicks off with an innocent little boy, a reincarnation of the LAMA , who witnesses a killing in a public restroom.  The killer, a police office is informed of his identification by the kid,  and he goes ballistic. he plans to  kill the witness and the good officer who is investigating the matter.  The good officer hides the witness in the city then decides to drive him back to the mountains, the bad police officer on his tail.  The good officer is badly wounded but he manages to take the little boy and his guardian to safety.  The  story moves away from the city to the stunning tranquil  mountains of monks and Buddhism where the good officer recovers, he falls in love in this idyllic setting and the final confrontation with the killers takes place.",1390435200,,1055,4.783333333333333
