5689757,2,B00C3HP58U,"These videos are ok for explaining a lot of things with Iron Condor and Calendar option strategies. However, they leave out a lot of information that can seriously impact the trader's results. In at least one case, the trader in the video is outright wrong about what he is saying.

In the video where the trader is adjusting the SPY trade, he says his adjustment is break even, and rolling up the put side even gives him a little extra profit. Doing a little simple math shows the adjustment actually reduced profit by 74%, and rolling up the put side still results in a reduced profit of 49%. In addition, the trader says nothing about increasing risk by rolling up the put side. For a new trader who were to believe the trader in this video, he may end up finding out the hard way that his adjustments are actually ending up as losses. Bottom line, adjustments are not as easy as the trader in these videos makes it seem.

These videos seem to be pitching calendar spreads a lot. This is ok, but there is no mention of the volatility risk. With iron condors, volatility affects your profit while you're in the trade, but as long as you finish within your short strikes, you'll make your profit. It is not so with calendars. It's possible to finish within your short strikes and lose money! There is no mention of this risk in the videos.

Altogether, the videos give the impression this option trading is simple with not much risk. I fear the new trader who watches these will find out the opposite, possibly losing a lot of money in the process.

The one thing I did like about these videos is how he shows to look at the overall greeks of your portfolio. This is good advice.",1381881600,25,1680,4.444805194805195
5689758,4,B00C3HP58U,"A bit hard to read the charts etc on a computer screen as the type etc can't by zoomed in on.  Also, not too clear for people who are just coming to grips with the subject. Otherwise it is quite good.",1375401600,,200,3.8780487804878048
5689759,5,B00C3HP58U,"I'm enjoying this product a lot, hours and hours of the trader talking about and showing how to use the trading platform to do option trades. It's well organized and I can easily find the topics I want to learn about which are mainly credit and calendar spreads. The trader in the video clearly knows what he is talking about and I'm learning a lot from this product.",1368576000,3,367,4.411764705882353
5689760,5,B00C3HP58U,"I liked this product very much, good info on trading Iron Condors and other option strategies, lots of video and audio which works better for me than books. Details are explained really well which is important in trading options. I like the focus on trading as a business, trading by the numbers makes a lot of sense now. There's a lot of content, great value compared to what the big seminar companies are charging, plus I can watch it over and over again, highly recommended.",1368144000,5,477,4.623529411764705
5689761,5,B00C3HP58U,"This DVD has a lot of content, a lot of videos all about how to trade options by the numbers,
the guy doing the trades explains everything very clearly and is serious about doing trading as
a real business.

this to anyone who wants to learn details about trading options without spending a fortune.",1367971200,13,774,4.26530612244898
5689762,5,B00C3HP58U,"This product is great for people like me who have read some books on how to trade options but
have never really got it. Watching and listening to the trader making trades and explaining what
he is doing has really helped me to understand what options trading is all about. There is so
much material in this DVD that it will take you weeks to get through but its a great education
and great value for money. Ive spent 100 times the cost of this for a seminar and did not learn
as much. The bonus trading books are worth the cost alone, easily a 5 star review.",1367712000,19,558,4.175925925925926

5689768,2,B00C3HP58U,I am a trader and I was looking  a video that would teach me other strategies I didn't know about or didn't understand thoroughly.  This was not that video.

8577016,5,B00C3HP58U,"Excellent way to learn about options.  I knew a lot about stock trading and indicators but never got into the options market until I bought this video.
Wish I had done it sooner as I'm now able to trade higher priced stocks and indexes I could never afford to mess with before.
Had to watch some of the videos a few times to make sure I understood the process and then the lightbulbs went off.
Ditching stocks (except for a few long term) and making profits with small trades until I grow the portfolio to gradually increase lot sizes.
Couldn't be happier.
Video explains it all!",1526256000,,579,4.462264150943396

8577018,1,B00C3HP58U,I bought it to have insights on other advanced trades from other traders but I was disappointed.  It was more of showing his trading sessions and his explanations were all over the place.

8577023,4,B00C3HP58U,"Warning: Duplicate Courses: Make money Trading Stocks and Options is identical to The Trading Pro System's Trading Options Education - Trade The Stock Market - Professional High Probability Strategies course. It's the exact same DVD just with a different cover, title. and name, from 2 different vendors. It's the same DVD word for word, image for image, from start to finish including the bonus material. I wound up buying both at different times and returned the last purchase. Amazon is unaware of this and actually recommends buying them together. I'm writing this review to help others from making the same mistake. Notice that both items have different prices. I recommend buying the less expensive since they are identical. As far as the material is concerned it is in-depth and full of some more advanced strategies I wasn't expecting which really expanded the way I look at selling option premium using a variety of spread techniques. If you are fairly well versed with credit spreads, Iron Condors, and Double calendars then you are familiar with the bulk of this material. If however you have purchased material from online option gurus about spreads and Iron condors the material in this course is far more extensive, vast and in depth then any you have come across before.  Plus the information on Theta scalping and Gamma scalping - I have never seen or heard of anywhere before. Really great stuff. Lastly  this course is not for the beginning option student. You need a basic knowledge of puts and calls and other basic options terminology. Having said that I disagree with the reviewer who claims this course is misleading to beginners. If you know the basics you will catch the one possible mistake. Advanced level options traders can pass on this course as well. There is gold here for anyone in between.",1437004800,7,1823,4.93485342019544
