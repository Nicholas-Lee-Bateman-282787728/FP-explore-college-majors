499337,5,6302711657,"This movie was easily one of the greatest movies of the 80's.  The fact that it hasn't been re-released yet when so many other less profitable movies have been, is a shame.  If there was anyone involved in the decision making process at the big movie companies that grew up during the 80's, this movie would already be out.  PLEASE RELEASE IT!
Johnny Depp and Hector Elizondo are a couple of the main characters, and even Andrew Dice Clay, along with tons of actors before they were huge.  Everytime I bring this movie up I wish, I had a copy to show to people that haven't seen it.",1061424000,7,582,4.361111111111111
499338,5,6302711657,"This movie is an all time favorite. Me and my brothers watched this movie hundreds of times since it's release in '85. When I first saw Depp in 21 jumpstreet I was like ""That's Jack"". I've been a Depp fan ever since. The movie itself is hilarious. Everyone remembers titles such as REVENGE OF THE NERDS and PORKY'S but this was and '80's movie that was slept on. Of course Depp turned into a very, very good actor and unlike alot of today's stars his old movies like this one weren't bad. Even Andrew ""DICE"" Clay is in it before he was ""THE DICEMAN"".Hector Elizondo is in it as well as the infamous MAESTRO. He's hella funny! If I were you I'd watch it but either way this movie is a family classic! Oh yeah I was only 9 years old when I first saw this. Don't let your kids see this!",987638400,11,783,4.157894736842105

499454,3,6302711657,"Released in 1985, Private Resort stars Johnny Depp (who was only 21 during filming) and Rob Morrow as two adolescent guests at a Florida resort for the weekend. Their only interest is chasing beach beauties, but fate has much more in store for them.

My title blurb is true: Ive never seen such an assortment of bodacious babes in any other movie. Ill put it like this: Take any dozen similar-themed movies and I assure that Private Resort contains more beautiful women than all of them in just the first half hour!

The top female, by the way, is the one with whom Andrew Dice Clays character intends to cheat; the one the protagonists try to hide from the girlfriend in the apartment (its impossible to pinpoint her name in the credits and, besides, I think shes uncredited). Second place goes to cutie Emily Longstreth, who plays Patti. Speaking of whom, she fell out of acting entirely by the 90s and reportedly fell into substance abuse, mental illness, and living in a homeless shelter in New York City. Theres also credible reports that she died in January, 2015 (please correct me, if this isn't true). In any case, she shines here as Robs potential girlfriend and shows-off her physical beauty in a white bikini in the last act.

Aside from the women, there are a lot of compelling antics, like zany chases in the hotel and butchered haircuts. Despite the boys obsession with babes, the movie drives home the point of landing the right female, whos beautiful inside and out. Ive heard the movie criticized as misogynistic, but this is laughable in light of the focus on women and the celebration thereof. I suppose these critics object to the excessive and unnecessary top nudity and the like, which I agree with and this explains my somewhat mediocre rating. In other words, the women are incredible and this is a really fun beach comedy, but I cant in good conscience recommend it due to the tasteless elements.

The move is short n sweet at 82 minutes and was shot at Ocean Reef Club, Key Largo, Florida.

499456,1,6302711657,"I love, love, love Johnny Depp, but I thought this film was really bad.  I think they were trying to duplicate the
kind of humor that we see in movies like Fast Times at Ridgemont High, but failed miserably.  Even though
Johnny, Rob Morrow and Hector Elizondo were good, the movie fell flat.  Plus, there were little continuity
problems, and a poor, and at times a non-existent, sound track.  I'm really glad Johnny doesn't watch his own

499509,4,6302711657,"This cheesy 80's sexy bedroom/resort farce shows us a young Johnny Depp (who's funny here), Hector Elizondo (who had been Tom Hanks' head-conscious boss in Nothing in Common), Dody Goodman (the grandmother character) who was funny as the flaky secretary (who wore her bra on the outside of her clothing) in Splash (1984), and Wendy Schaal who had played an abrasive grocery clerk in Innerspace (1987). It's obnoxious sex-farce, mindless and goofy- the kind of film that doesn't get made anymore. The dvd quality is great- the film captures the hot, gorgeous Key Largo location in sumptuous colors. The sound is good, perhaps too good- the often irritating songs (especially the grating main theme) blare out and embarrass. This dvd's definitely a hoot for those who enjoy care-free 80's adult comedies and the kinds of films which Gilbert Godfried showed on USA Up All Night years ago.

It's Florida, it's spring break, and what do you need with an actual plot? It's basically slapstick and worse, in terms of humor. For example, one big deal is made over a guy whose hair is ""ruined"" by Depp's roommate pretending to be a barber when he is not. Through all the slapstick foolishness, all I could think of was ""What's his problem? Yul Brenner looked great with no hair at all. Just shave off what's left and stop crabbing.""

Nothing new here - situations evolve out of classic farce and slapstick encounters.  Both Rob Morrow and Depp expose their butts in a few sequences and there are more exposed women's breasts than in any other commercially released film I've seen.  There is the inept jewel thief, the lecherous waiter with designs on the sweet young waitress and a dotty matron.

Morrow manages to be obnoxious and Depp merely cute. He isn't called upon to create a character here - it was after all his first leading film role and only his second film appearance.

There are a few continuity errors probably due to editing decisions but only one stands out (Depp manages to bed his girl but we don't see anything of the encounter the night before, only waking up the morning after).

Tony Azito and Hector Aleandro are amusing as the frustrated security director and the jewel thief, but the film is stolen by Dody Goodman as the dotty matron.  Watching her throw herself at a barber in the bushes after accidentally downing a handful of quualudes and attempting to thwart the theft of her diamond with a number of karate moves bring the only real laughs in the film.

The movie's plot is slim, and neither Morrow or Depp have any screen presence in this early stage of their careers.  Elizondo tries gamely and pulls off a few laughs, but he's not at his best either.  Most of the film's laughs come from Leslie Hope as a slightly off kilter cosmic bimbo; Dody Goodman as a dotty old lady who knows karate and Tony Azito as a bumbling hotel security guard.

Hector Elizondo is hilarious as a jewel thief who is also very obsessed with how his hair looks.  My mom, sister and I have been waiting for a long time for this movie to come out on DVD.  This movie is right up there with ""White Chicks"" in comic escapades.  A true ""must have"" for the avid collector of classic ""slapstick"" comedies from the 1980's !!!",1148428800,4,517,4.333333333333333

499727,2,6302711657,"I admit that I'm a die-hard Johnny Depp fan, but this wasn't anywhere near one of his best.  He IS adorable in the movie, but the plot is extremely corny, and I found myself rolling my eyes more than laughing out loud.  Guys will enjoy this movie for the hundreds of bikini-sporting girls, but not much else.  Although there are a few remotely funny parts, it is mostly because of how dorky this movie is.  But then again, it was worth it to watch Johnny.",1122076800,6,455,4.317647058823529

499729,5,6302711657,I loved this movie! It was making me laugh out loud- I hope it comes out on DVD because it definitely is an 80s classic.,1112227200,4,120,3.84
499730,5,6302711657,Ahhhh...This is what everyone who grew up in the 80's would say. A very funny real cute and yet sort of romantic type of movie. This is when Johnny Depp was still new in the movie industry. I think even Johnny himself would love to see this movie again released on DVD. I think each and every one of us older now generation reminisce the earlier days when we were all still teens trying to pick up or meet some girls at the beach. If some of the ladies out there young and older are still in love with JD they would definitely fall inlove with this movie. This is a Classic! Sony! Get this out on DVD! I would definitely buy it!,1101945600,7,628,4.1138211382113825
