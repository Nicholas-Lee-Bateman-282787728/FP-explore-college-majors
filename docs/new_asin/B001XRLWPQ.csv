3827314,5,B001XRLWPQ,"I originally checked this show out, due to another actor saying in jest(I hope) that Castle was copying the series he is in. I'm glad I did, because this show is fantastic!
Rick Castle(Nathan Fillion) a best selling novelist and father, and Kate Beckett(Stana Katic) a straight lined NYPD detective, have a great chemistry on screen. It's their banter and chemistry that make this show.
All of the actors in this show are very talented. Fillion, I knew from Firefly and Serenity. I hadn't heard of Katic before, but I'm glad they were both was cast in these roles, because I am loving these two characters and actors more and more with each episode.
This is more a dramatic comedy, than just another cop show. Check this show out! It gets better with each episode. It really is the best new show out there at the moment. 5 stars!",1240876800,17,829,4.570469798657718
3827315,5,B001XRLWPQ,"Castle is by far the best comedy/drama on television right now! I can't wait to get my DVD's so I can check out all the extras! Nathan Fillion (Castle) and Stana Katic (Becket) have such fantastic on screen chemistry. For these two it seems like it's not a matter of if they'll get together (or beat the heck out of each other) but a matter of when. Awesome, just awesome!",1240876800,5,372,4.328571428571428
3827316,5,B001XRLWPQ,It's been a loooong time since I've seen a show this good. I love the chemistry between Nathan and Stana. I recommend this show for any romantic :),1240876800,2,147,4.285714285714286
3827317,5,B001XRLWPQ,"Nathan Fillion is fabulous in this series. I look forward to this every week. I will certainly purchase the series on DVD.
The entire cast is first rate and perfect for each role.
Love it!",1240617600,12,188,4.4
3827318,5,B001XRLWPQ,"This is a show for all those of you who appreciates perfection.
Nathan Fillion's role absolutely fits and the Detective and even his mother and daughter.
This show is solid and deserves to stay.
The story starts with a speech for Castle (who is the main character that is played by Nathan) and his ex-wife introduces him and the relation between them too is strictly business. His mother lives with him and his daughter. Then the police shows a mysterious murder that is based on Castle's novels so they try to track the killer and uses Castle's help.
It is so funny and well written. Deserves a solid 5",1239926400,13,603,4.541284403669724
3827319,5,B001XRLWPQ,"I'll freely admit that the reason I watched the premiere of Castle (and every episode since) is because Nathan ""Captain Mal"" Fillion is in it. Love the man. LOOOOVE him. He was pitch perfect as the futuristic dashing spaceship captain, a hoot in Dr. Horrible's, and he's got an incredible comedic ability blended with good acting chops and toothsome looks. He's great.

So, finally, we see him get top dog billing on a prime time show on one of networks. He's Rick Castle, a bestselling author who is drawn into a partnership (of sorts) with police detective Kate Beckett played by Stana Katic when murders by a serial killer are based on Castle's novels. She's the reluctant partner, he's having a grand old time (with lots of humor), needling her while also being insightful and helpful due to his myriad connections. (I do enjoy how, as the show progresses, we see how he puts that celebrity of his to good use.) That's the core of the show, the conflict and chemistry between the cop and the writer.

It works because of Fillion's immense personal charm, humor, and snap-crackliness. Stana is fine in her semi-tense, driven, cop-girl who doesn't eat enough way, but the show is Nathan's.

It was nice to see Susan Sullivan of Dharma and Greg fame again, this time as flamboyant mom--oh, those bright outfits, that hair--to Castle. She's good in anything, frankly. We also have a cute if way, way, way too sweet-and-nice daughter to Castle. (Pulease, I haven't met a teen this squeaky nice since Sunday School decades ago. Given grandma's dramatics and dad's wicked sense of humor, where did she come from?)The scenes of daughter and dad tend to be really squishily heartwarming, and that's okay with me. Sometimes, I need that sentimental dose.

The supporting cop cast adds to the fun--watch them enjoy their espresso in the episode where Castle springs for one for the crew.

Whether Katic will be able to keep up is my main worry. She is doing okay, and there are moments when you're glad she's the crankier one, ""straight man."" But this show will rise or fall on not just Fillion's talent and charisma--and yes, hottienss--but on whether she can really ramp it up and keep the core hot.

If you like a less serious cop show, and you are a fan of Fillion's, you've gotta watch/get CASTLE.",1238630400,81,2295,4.739348370927318
3827320,5,B001XRLWPQ,"Nathan Fillion is brilliant as ABC's new world famous author-turned-pseudo-cop Richard Castle. Behind the veneer of an arrogant celebrity, who seems to have let dozens of best sellers and world acclaim go to his head, Castle is truly a kind-hearted man and a compassionate father.  Besides writing, his favorite hobby seems to be irritating Kate Beckett (Stana Katic), the NYPD detective who was in charge of a investigating a string of copy-cat murders modeled after Castle's own murder mystery books. Since he's killed off the main character of his last series, Castle needs new inspiration for his next set of novels, and he finds his muse with the charming but difficult-to-crack detective. The chemistry between Fillion and Katic is astounding, leaving the audience with more to follow than just the murder cases. Unlike most criminal investigation shows, Castle has a heavy focus on humor and the strong development of its characters and their relationships. Not quite a drama and not quite a comedy, this primetime series has elements that appeal to any sensibility. The twisted murder storylines will keep you guessing for the full hour until the conclusion you never expected.

Bonus material for the DVD includes behind the scenes interviews with the stars, out takes, deleted scenes, and more. Strong first season. I'm greatly looking forward to watching this show thrive and burgeon into big-name status.",1238544000,252,1416,5.233480176211454

3827329,5,B001XRLWPQ,"I enjoyed Castle, as a detective mystery  series and gentle romance. The banter reminds me of old time movies.  Each story episode is unique. Premise is a bit far-fetched, but the detecting is adventurous and plausible. The premise is an author of popular novels is given a favor by his fan, the mayor, and gets permission to tag along with the police department, ostensibly to get more material for a new novel series. I think the only thing I didn't enjoy was the overbearing hammy wannabe actress mother, kind of a thin ""Auntie Mame"" type who lives with the author. Her character adds nothing to the stories. Meant as comic relief, I guess. Overall, one of the best tv shows for the time. Fast paced, interesting soundtrack music different for each show, and nicely edited. My favorite characters were the two supporting detectives and their banter. I didn't know of Nathan Fillion before this show. He plays a handsome man about town smitten with the female detective. He's gallant, charming, Richie rich and likes to help, and often is surprisingly helpful. It's fun, not too grotesque, not too mushy, and paced well.",1509321600,,1122,4.838541666666667

3827335,5,B001XRLWPQ,"One of the best presents you can have in this day and age is content you haven't yet discovered but that you can binge on. I was so lucky to have discovered Psych and Mentalist late, and now I get to discover Castle. Instead of a fake psychic you get a famous murder/ mystery author who is observant and is well networked. I like that the show isn't fully dependent on him to solve crimes, he doesn't contribute as much as Shawn from Psych or Patrick Jane from the Mentalist. It's not as funny as Psych and doesn't have an overarching plot as macabre as the Mentalist. There is an overarching plot, but they haven't really focused much on it, it's only mildly interesting and so doesn't eat up the show.",1504051200,,703,4.374045801526718

3827430,5,B001XRLWPQ,"I got hooked on this show a few months ago. Kind of goofy, but still a good crime drama with romantic tension in the air. What more can you ask?

I tend to be a TV snob, watching mostly documentaries and movies that have some artistic or social quality. That doesn't mean I'm too good for some basic, fun to watch entertainment, and this does the job. Castle's character is a successful millionaire, but just goofy and vulnerable enough, plus ok looking but not over the top good looking to keep him from seeming somewhat believable. Beckett's character is so good looking, confident, and successful that it's hard to imagine her ever seeing anything in Castle, but the chemistry is undeniable and they use that to tease the viewer into coming back episode after episode and season after season.

The plots are, for the most part, original and refreshing, but far enough from reality that you have to just go along and stop reminding yourself that these things would never happen in real life and that nobody would survive the predicaments that confront the characters on each episode. I am former law enforcement and know that none of the things on this should would ever happen, but again ... I don't care. Sometimes you just need to escape reality for an hour or two.

One of the real surprises for me has been Susan Sullivan. After watching her as the uptight Kitty Montgomery on Dharma and Greg, I couldn't have imagined her playing any other character. In Castle, she plays Martha - Castles whacky mother, who is an over-the-top, past her prime actress, with a multitude of character flaws, but who is nonetheless lovable.",1470873600,6,1628,4.725352112676056

3827490,3,B001XRLWPQ,"Clearly the entire season had been outlined before or just after the pilot (which is wrought with continuity issues of all types), but that outline wasn't the best framework for the chemistry between Castle and Beckett to blossom organically. Also, how Espo and Ryan were going to fit into the overall theme was inconsistent . All the main characters seemed to meander from episode to episode in terms of their emotionality and how and where they fit in the ""team"". A sense of character and emotional  pointlessness and contraindications from episode to episode permeated the whole season.

Sounds like I'm being negative, but a cast and crew needs time to find it's footing and season 1 was needed for the much better seasons to come.

I think the show peaked in season three and four but began to decline by the end of the fifth season. Season 7 was tough and 8 is unwatchable. I hope they cancel the show. They should have stopped the series with a build to the wedding half way into season 6. That whole deal with Castle disappearing and coming back with no memory was where the show jumped the shark in my opinion.",1466726400,,1119,4.613065326633166

I highly recommend it. The series currently has 8 seasons. I liked it so well I bought all 8 seasons. Alas, today (May 2019) I read in my Yahoo News that Castle was getting the ax for another season - but maybe enough fans will protest and we'll get a few more seasons, or someone will buy the series to make more.

3827614,4,B001XRLWPQ,"I love so many things about this show, but man the first season is especially hard to watch when Castle openly disrespects a woman who absolutely knows more than he does about actual crime solving. Or kissing her on the cheek without permission. That's what sexual harassment looks like. Unfortunately stuff like that still shows up in comedy writing all the time.

That being said, I do enjoy all the main characters and most of the episodes (there are always a couple ""filler"" feeling episodes in any show). I love all the Firefly references, and the sometimes fantastical episodes that leave you wondering if something really did happen that can't be explained by logic.",1461715200,,673,4.9035087719298245

I love the repartee and spicy innuendos between Beckett and Castle, along with the lovely relationships between Castle and his daughter and Castle and his Mom. Ryan and Espo are favs too.

3827857,2,B001XRLWPQ,"Although I like Nathan Fillion, in this series he is playing as Malcolm Reynolds, detective novelist in 21st Century New York City.  I thought the rest of the cast was boring, with only one or two clever lines per episode from the lot.  I thought the chemistry between the two leads was shaky at best, and quickly grew disinterested in the way it was progressing towards the usual tired cliche tension between them.

After four episodes of predictable writing, acting and direction, I decided this series just doesn't interest me enough to keep going any further.  I'm glad Mr. Fillion has gotten several seasons out of this show, but I'm not going to be putting any more money in his pockets by buying any more Castle DVDs.",1440288000,,724,4.677165354330708

3827866,4,B001XRLWPQ,"The cast is good, but could improve in the suspense department, still I don't need to be chewing my nails off through all 8 seasons, it's a welcome change to have a lower key mystery series with lots of humor, romance, and not as much violence. It's a little ""old school"" and i love that. Would like to see other main characters lives and personalities more developed. Who is the boss? Who are the detectives? More character development of other than main characters. Otherwise really enjoyable, which is the highest praise.",1439251200,,524,4.769230769230769
3827877,5,B001XRLWPQ,"First, I love Castle. I can (and do) watch the episodes over and over. The only problem I have with this is that most of the other series I have on DVD (West Wing, Highlander) have scenes in the episodes on the DVD than didn't make it into the TV version. I thought I'd find the same thing here, but didn't. What you see in the TV version is what you get on the DVD. I found that a bit disappointing. The bonus section isn't all that great either. I would like a little information on the series, characters and actors. I haven't watched the other seasons on DVD yet, but will in the near future. I hope they have the deleted scenes and maybe a bloopers section.",1439164800,,662,4.1796875

Some of their best acting on the show!  Love the pilot and the first bantering scene between them.  I watch it when there is nothing else to watch, love  the way it was filmed as well.  So glad ABC exposed us to this talented group of actors, creators, directors , producers and most importantly WRITERS!

Beckett is a perfect foil for him.  Great push and pull in their relationship.  Beckett offers steady to Castle's whimsy.  I'm addicted.  Have caught snatches of the series in the past.  The snatches so intrigued me that I bought Season 1 to see what the series was all about.  I'm hooked.  Sharing Castle's life with his mother and daughter is a bonus.  The relationship between the family is wonderful.  The little gal who plays Castle's
daughter is beautiful.  I am having difficulty limiting my episode watching.  Another bonus feature is seeing authentic authors sitting with Castle and joining in on his thinking processes.  Super idea!",1429315200,,787,5.03125

Stana Katic never overplays her character and never tries to sell you the punch line. The term 'pitch-perfect' comes to mind. And that too is not easy (and might I add it also helps that she is quite beautiful. But what makes this show work is the chemistry between them. Without that it's just another cop show that doesn't make it beyond season 1. With it, the show is witty, fun and makes you want more. You care for them. You want to see them make it together. You get scared when it looks like they won't. And most of all you laugh along with them. They are absolutely hilarious together.",1428537600,,712,4.484615384615385

Quirky, fun characters with some emotional hangups to work out through the series. Compelling, unusual murders to solve.  I'm seeing it for the first time on Amazon and DirectTV, and wonder how I missed it when it first came out in 2009. I can't help but watch two or three episodes at a time.

3828005,5,B001XRLWPQ,"Hi, my name is Ann and I'm a ""Castle"" addict.

I'm not sure how this television series has been running since 2009 and I had not even watched one episode. It is fantastic!

How addicted am I? Throughout my day I will ask myself... ""Is there enough time to watch an episode before I have to do 'such-and-such'?""!!

""Castle"" is a crime solving series that has intrigue, romance and humor. The story-line revolves around a beautiful police detective (Kate Beckett - Stana Katic)) who is tasked with solving murders in New York City and a handsome, rich and well connected murder/mystery novelist (Richard Castle - Nathan Fillion). The pilot connects these two over a series of deaths that mimic murders in some of the writer's novels. Castle is brought on to ""consult"" in that investigation and then ingratiates himself into a semi-permanent position as a consultant to Beckett because he's friends with the NY mayor. The show has great writers; it's difficult to predict the outcome of each episode! It keeps you guessing... and laughing!",1423612800,,1036,4.908571428571428

3828007,4,B001XRLWPQ,"Like NCIS, the writers make a world of a difference in the development of the plot and all other subsequent sub-plots that may become involved in the course of the performance of each episode. The choice of personnel that play the parts and how they have melded the characters in the dynamics of the dialogue presented. How they project not only the professional dynamics but also the personal. Without having to give a spoiler alert, the writers do an excellent job in how they handled the logistics of the dynamics between Castle and Beckett in Season Seven. For the four star rating, I still question as to what demographic that the Amazon editions are to be marketed to. These are not family friendly for there are F-Bombs and other vocabulary that are not child friendly. Even a PG-13 rating is an inadequate caution.",1422921600,,822,4.755244755244755

Despite being just DVD quality, the images and transfers are very crisp.  The top-notch writing, acting, and casting speak for themselves.

3828100,3,B001XRLWPQ,"I agree with others that this is a lesser version of ""Bones"".  Just because Rich Castle is the perpetual life of the party doesn't mean the audience won't care about other characters being developed. The rest of the cast sort of revolve like wall paper around him.  For some reason I don't see Castle and Beckett getting together as a couple as I hear they do in later seasons. He's too eccentric and seems to me a good 15 years older than her.  After watching several seasons of Bones, CSI, Hawaii Five-0 and other murder-dramas this show's formula gets a little stale after a few episodes.

The twists and turns of the plot can be entertaining and the quippy one-liners are fun.  I really like the mother character, also, but I hope later seasons are fresher and deeper.",1410307200,2,772,4.565217391304348

3828154,5,B001XRLWPQ,"I am a huge Nathan Fillion fan and so was happy to see him in a new show. Castle's premise is quite unique. It's a fresh idea I haven't seem before even though it is a bit far fetched. The characters interact great with each other and there really aren't any that I dislike. Each episode offers up a fresh murder mystery and Fillion's role as a writer and not a detective gives him a chance to make humorous or quirky comments without seeming out of place. He's a bit of a screwball which he carries off oh so well, and if he were simply a police detective his humor would seem very out of place. I like that he seems to have retained a bit of his Malcolm Reynolds personality from the Firefly series. On to season two.",1404172800,,719,4.179856115107913

August 17th, 2014: Update.

I am hooked. I love this series. The characters are entertaining, and there is a lot of humor in the shows, which softens the violent aspects of a homicide crime show. For a while, it felt as though the show was regurgitating the same story wrapped in a different murder/characters. But that seems to have abated, and the stories are not quite as predictable.

I only hope now the show doesn't go off the air. Seems when I get hooked, they are canceled.",1402617600,,715,4.360902255639098

3828178,5,B001XRLWPQ,"Castle is alot like other crime shows out there.  What sets it apart and makes it worth watching is Nathan Fillion.  He plays as Castle, an author who tags along with NYPD detective Kate Beckett.  His quirky sense of humor (much like his sense of humor he had as the captain of the Serenity in Firefly) and outrageous theories of the crimes they investigate adds a unique quality that no other crime show has.  I was instantly hooked and have grown to love each character.  The novels he publishes in the show are actual novels and each book matches the events/timeframe they are published within the show.  If you loved Nathan in Firefly, you will love him here too.",1400025600,,667,4.563025210084033
3828179,5,B001XRLWPQ,"Can't believe I've been missing out on this wonderful show. I know it's now been on for 6 seasons, so I have no idea why it took me so long to discover a great show that so many others were watching regularly. Hey, better late than never though. I'm not even sure when exactly or why exactly I began to watch this series, but I believe it may have been the fact that it's on a marathon run almost every day of the week. Hey, that's what originally captured my attention with the Law and Order spin-offs. Oh, maybe that's the reason it took me so long - i.e. because I was already watching so many other detective shows and didn't realize just how 'different' and 'unique' this one was. Whatever the reason, I'm so glad to finally be a regular viewer.

While I've been a fan of Law and Order Criminal Intent, Law and Order SVU, CSI New York ... and occasionally CSI Miami ... I really don't want to compare ""CASTLE"" to any of the above. In fact, other than being a detective series, it really has little in common with those other shows. n actuality it's probably a lot more similar to an oldie but goodie ~ ""Moonlighting."" That said, I think it's actually more entertaining than it's so-called predecessor. For one thing, the relationship between Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic is engaging, entertaining, comical, sweet (at times) and even believable. O.K., so the concept of a mayor allowing a well-known writer to tag along with a detective may not be very realistic .... but the chemistry between these two characters (and actors) definitely is. The other regular characters are equally satisfying to watch. Some shows just get their casting right, while others .... not so much; this one did get it right. I love the relationship between Castle and his family as much as the one he has with Beckett and the other detectives. Either Nathan is a really charming guy in reality, or he sure knows how to play one. I suspect both are true. What he brings to this role, besides comedic relief to intense situations revolving around homicides, is an honest portrayal of someone who is genuinely concerned about the cases he's allowed to be a part of. Uh....not to mention his genuine interest in Detective Beckett. As the series progresses, Castle gradually grows on Beckett .... initially annoying the you-know-what out of her, and eventually becoming her friend, co-worker, confidant and love interest. Detective Beckett is equally engaging to watch and her devotion to her career, based on personal past history, is real and believable.

I have some catching up to do as I have not seen every single episode as yet. However, I've seen the early episodes several times and found the decision to finally begin my DVD series collection to be a 'no brainer.' For other newcomers like myself, if you are hooked on season one, as I was and still am, then it's likely you will continue to watch the other seasons. I'm hoping to purchase season 2 soon .... and plan to gradually add all the seasons to my DVD collection. While this series may eventually jump the shark, as so many other t.v. dramas have done, in the meantime I'm gonna enjoy every minute of it. If you like your dramas with a mixture of dramatic intensity, a hint of comedy, good story lines, interesting characters and cliffhangers that keep you interested, then this show might just be for you. Oh, and with all the idiotic reality shows airing these days it's good to know that there are still some good options out there.",1400025600,,3484,4.645056726094003

3828204,5,B001XRLWPQ,"I love this show and have watched this DVD several times. The pilot really set the tone with the charming, witty, handsome writer bored with his life and his recent book series. He suddenly meets a beautiful no nonsense female detective that he finds incredibly intriguing. He helps her out when someone starts staging murders like his books. She is totally annoyed with his interference but soon discovers that his creative writer's mind combined with his impressive knowledge of a lot of subjects due to research for his books gives him the ability to come up with ideas and theories that fall outside of the normal police thinking. Although he seems like a shallow playboy, she finds out that he is a devoted father to a teenage daughter and admires that part of his life. Castle decides she will make a great muse for a new book series and worms his way onto her team. There is a lot of witty banter between the leads and other cast members.

3828232,5,B001XRLWPQ,"This is a great crime dramady featuring Nathan Fillion who we all know from Firefly!  If you're old enough to remember, I have to liken Castle to a blend of ""Moon Lighting"", ""Columbo"", and ""Murder She Wrote"".

The 30 second gist of the show is that Fillion is a crime writer who gets connected with an attractive detective and manages to convince the mayor (who Castle is friends with) that he should have unrestricted access to follow her around for inspiration.  He's also a huge asset to the NYPD with his understanding of criminal behavior etc.  Fillion is great and there is lots of comic relief surrounding the central murder plot so it's not a real downer to watch.

As of the time of this writing, they are into Season 6.  We just started watching a few weeks ago, ripped through season 1 and are now into Season 2.  Owning them on Amazon is the way to go, commercial free and easy to watch on pretty much any internet connected device, not to mention binge watching multiple episodes back to back!

3828237,5,B001XRLWPQ,"A best-selling author and an NYPD detective team up to solve difficult crimes, utilizing their very different personalities and backgrounds -- simultaneously creating an appealing show that packs everything from mystery to light-hearted humor.

Despite her initial reluctance, Det. Kate Beckett (Stana Katic) finds herself tailed on the job by Richard Castle (Nathan Fillion), a famous crime novelist (the fictitious equivalent of Stephen King), thanks to his pulling strings in the mayor's office. While Castle initially claims he's there to glean ideas and inspiration for his new series -- about a female detective named Nikki Heat, who is based on Beckett -- it's also clear that Castle loves the ""whodunnit"" angle of solving real-life cases.

In addition, it quickly becomes clear that Castle is attracted to Beckett, a pretty and intelligent yet tough and no-nonsense cop. The writer and researcher in Castle almost immediately appraises Beckett, concluding that someone so smart and good-looking could've been anything she wanted, so there must be a specific reason for her choosing to join the police force. Castle's suspicions are fast affirmed, but it's also apparent that Beckett's past is too painful for her to discuss. Nonetheless, that's hardly a deterrent for someone like Castle, who only thinks it makes Beckett all the more intriguing.

Rounding out the cast are Kevin Ryan (Seamus Dever) and Javier Esposito (Jon Huertas), two other NYPD detectives who work under Beckett for Captain Roy Montgomery (Ruben Santiago-Hudson); Castle's former-actress mother Martha Rodgers (Susan Sullivan) and teen daughter Alexis (Molly C. Quinn), both of whom live with him.

Although Season 1 only has 9 episodes, it's a great way to become introduced to this quickly addicting series! If you enjoy mysteries, a bit of flirtation and a frequently sprinkling of witty banter and humor, definitely give Castle a try!",1390953600,,1918,5.383333333333334

3828239,5,B001XRLWPQ,"Nathan Fillion really makes this series, and it's definitely a step above the average CSI junk, mainly because it has better writing and acting. It's not realistic, but it isn't meant to be--it's almost the equivalent of a cozy mystery, although it is set in New York and does present the viewer with a variety of grisly corpses. It's as addictive as the popcorn that I like to eat while I'm watching it.  :)",1390867200,,408,4.513513513513513

3828243,5,B001XRLWPQ,"We didn't discover this gem of a TV show until well into the 3rd season, so we eagerly snatched up the earlier episodes to bring us up to speed.  Really enjoy all these characters -- obviously Castle & Beckett, but also all the supporting cast -- and the great chemistry among them.  Well acted, smart, quirky humor, and everyone's just so darned attractive!  (Nathan Fillion hasn't lost any of his charm since Firefly/Serenity.)
This is practically the only show we make plans to watch on broadcast/cable and actually hunt down on-demand if we miss an episode.  The DVD did not disappoint.",1390608000,,590,4.811881188118812

3828257,4,B001XRLWPQ,"My sister-in-law has long spoken highly of this show.  She has always shown excellent taste in tv shows, so I finally got around to giving this a shot.  And, yes, I was more than pleased.  In the tradition of all the good murder mystery shows, this has wit, a good and strange murder, and even a hint of romance.

What I love most and found the best quality of the show is the premise.  A famous murder mystery writer called in to use his eye for murders to help the police.  It's cute, it's clever, and it's a great spin on the genre.

Add to that a very likable and memorable cast that still manages to stay within the realms of reality.  No one is too quirky, but everyone, part big or small, has enough personality to be endearing.  Nathan Fillion is as brilliant as always and easily slips into the role of a big-headed wealthy writer.

The whole show is just charming, a perfect blend of humor, drama, and good ol' fashioned murder.",1389225600,,938,4.339080459770115

3828262,5,B001XRLWPQ,"It was interesting to see how the show started.  Castle was much more of a juvenile smart-aleck when it started but they matured him up.  We noticed a few troubling story elements (like why didn't Beckett have a partner) but it is TV, that's ok.",1388880000,,245,4.4222222222222225

A good show is always about the stories, and this one is not exception.  I can sit and watch an episode, and look forward to the next one.  No so many shows today can boast about that.  The actor's and actresses are all entertaining and have a sense of the ridiculous you can enjoy.  I love to laugh when a show presents it in a clean and honorable manner.

3828322,5,B001XRLWPQ,I really love Rick Castle. He is a fun character to watch and I like his interactions with Detective Beckett. The addition of his mature side (in relation to his daughter) is also nice so we have the fun immature side and the home side. He is a much more believable character that way. I also love the two male detectives that work with them sometimes. Humorous pair. I would like to see more of them with Castle in an 'after work boys night' capacity.,1380240000,,452,4.329411764705882

3828344,3,B001XRLWPQ,"What brought me to this series was Nathan Fillion, who I had first seen in Firefly. He's a likable actor and I was curious to see him in another show. This show is a mixture of Murder She Wrote and Moonlighting, both enjoyable 80's mystery/crime series. Here, the ""whodunits"" are pretty transparent and aren't as interesting as the developing relationship between Castle and Detective Becket. Unfortunately, Fillion and Katic have some chemistry but not enough to keep me invested.

I can see how the fantasy world of a successful writer with a perfect daughter would appeal to people looking to kick back and relax, but it's really unfortunate that the better TV series Firefly was cancelled after 14 episodes while this show continues into its sixth season.",1377475200,5,759,4.9763779527559056

3828347,5,B001XRLWPQ,"I was recommended this show by a friend in England. What a trip, huh? He recommended Castle, I recommended Luther.

Within the first three minutes, I was hooked! Great filming, interesting storyline, and the cast? Well, I Love Love Firefly (SciFi was totally stupid to shut that show down!) and Nathan Fillion, who played Captain Malcolm Reynolds is the star - how cool is THAT?! He plays an author of suspense/crime novels who is brought in when a killer uses set-ups from his novels as the basis for a string of murders. Stana Katic (Quantum of Solace) plays the cop who is assigned the case.

There is a great deal of humour in this episode, which I hope will continue through the series, as I intend to watch them all. One scene where Castle drops a handcuff key and has to pick it up with his toes? I thought I was the only person who used my toes like fingers, LOL.

The chemistry between the actors is perfect, the tone is light (unlike the more extreme cop and CSI shows out there today) and overall the show was extremely enjoyable.

I look forward to watching the rest of the episodes!",1377388800,,1095,4.46

Lead actors Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic have excellent chemistry, and Nathan Fillion is in the zone as witty best selling author Richard Castle.

I really like that Castle is a writer but I dislike it when he continuously allows Beckett to dangle a carrot in front of his face, making him think he has a chance in a relationship with her. I realize it's to keep the story moving and viewers interested but really? They don't have to marry but they could have a relationship. All it does is encourage them to sleep around with others. Who'd want a relationship with someone like that? Also, I doubt the police would allow him to insert himself into all of their cases as much as he does.",1375401600,,698,4.4609375

3828365,5,B001XRLWPQ,"I'm a big fan! I think Castle and Beckett have a wonderful chemistry. He's a wise ass but not to the point of being irritating. She has a wonderful coolness about her. The rest of the crew, Kevin, Javier, Lanie, seem so natural together. The interplay between Castle and his daughter Alexis is so sweet. Susan Sullivan, playing Martha, has been around forever and she looks fabulous.  The plots can be fomulaic, but it's the interaction that we watch for. I especially love when Castle thinks that the perpetrator is an alien being or vampire or some other loony crackpot; while he goes off on a tangent, Becket brings him back down to earth. The dialogue makes the show...the wise cracks, the goofy remarks...i.e. ""Guess who's got a date with a hooker?""  just make the show very enjoyable.",1374451200,,790,4.717391304347826

I ""stumbled"" on to a TV episode of Castle, mid season, and was hooked. I looked it up on the internet and found I was not the only one. I called my son to ask if he had ever heard of Castle . It turns out he had just bought Season I on DVD. After one episode I contacted Amazon and ,rush mail, sent for my own copy. Hooked! I sat straight thru the three discs non stop. The six main characters work so perfectly off each other  I can't believe I never heard of it before. Now the wife is a fan,too.

3828369,5,B001XRLWPQ,"I've been a huge 'Castle' fan since the very beginning, (I followed Nathan Fallon over from 'Firefly') and I must admit that this season is the best. Simply because, in the beginning we see Castle as the cocky, self-absorbed novelist who is more interested in having fun than working. All of these qualities are awesome because it shows him, and the other characters, as they were before all the sub plots of the series started taking over the main characters actions.

In this season, Castle is just interested in getting a good story and bugging the hell out of Beckett. Ryan and Espizeto are just working stiff cops trying to do their job around what, at first appears to be just a big distraction. And Beckett is bound and determined to not let the attention of one of her favorite authors distract her from solving murders. Oh, and it's clear right from the start that she's totally hiding her attraction to Rick, no matter how much she complains. It's a case of, 'me thinks the lady doth protest to much'.",1374364800,,1011,4.616666666666666

3828382,5,B001XRLWPQ,"Season One of Castle is a fun, lighthearted and addictive genre program whose characters tend to grow on you.  It stands out for clever, witty dialog and truly inspired acting.  Unlike older shows along this formula, this one does not reset to zero (like Magnum PI).  There are story arcs that cross episodes and seasons.  Events and relationships generally have meaning.  Start with season one.

As of this writing, there are five seasons of Castle on the market and the sixth begins in the coming months.  The show provides an island oasis of smart, sensitive entertainment in a sea of TV drek.

The entire cast is outstanding, with such depth and plausibility that you fall into their world with them.  The show is richly with subtext and symbolism, rewarding attentive viewers with layers of meaning.

The relationship between Castle and Beckett is witty and clever.  Lots of chuckles arise from their repartee.  It is also tender and moving.

DVDs, I decided to give this show a lookover.  Very impressed indeed!  Well produced with excellent photography of NY (where I live), fine acting, good plot lines (I like the romance situation with
Beckett & Castle) overall good casting and sets. and humor to boot.  Some of the stories appear to be inspired by some Bone episodes: the growing but slowly romantic connections, and the bickering
between a rich consultant and a tough cop like Booth and Dr Brennan.  That's ok because they are all well done, fun to watch and occasionally shed a tear or two: I am always the romantic!  CASTLE
is a bit more realistic while BONES is a bit more sci fi & fantasy.  Both series are excellent.  I also have the MENTALIST DVDs but have not yet watched any of them (all from AMAZON of course!).
Crime, love, action, humor & goo; who could ask for anything more!!  And I love New York!!  And very lovely women, too!  When I finish the 5th season I will have more to say; I have the 5th on a

I bought it only because of the sale, never having seen an episode of the show.  Great writing mixes humor with serious murder cases. All of the actors are good, in every role, with Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic carrying most of the acting and comic load. The Father-daughter relationship between Rick and Alexis Castle is very well played.  It is nice to see a sweet, nice young girl (Molly Quinn as Alexis Castle), instead of the usual bad girls the networks like to present. You can't help but like the episode when Alexis goes to the prom. I like the fact that, through this season at least, there is no overt love relationship between Rick Castle and Kate Beckett, but a slowly growing respect for the detective abilities of each, particularly when they work together. The supporting characters are uniformly excellent.  This is a really good show.",1370908800,,1003,4.649717514124294

The entire cast is excellent.  The  interplay between Castle and Beckett is great!  She keeps him on his toes.  At first you might think Castle is perhaps a shallow character, but with each new episode you find new depths in him.  Beckett is more business like, but she has many layers and they're slowly revealed.  The absolute best part of this series, though, is the relationship between Castle and his daughter.  His love and commitment to her shines through.  This series has it all: comedy, drama, playfulness, action, and a sweetness you seldom find on TV these days.",1368489600,,735,4.417910447761194

  we are fans of the show on local tv.  the characters all seem to fit together.  but, after the first episode, the characters get better and their presentations have come alive.  each show allows all of us to follow the great plot and conclusion at the end.  we started to watch this show on regular tv when it came out and followed it for a while.  then we decided that waiting until the dvd came out was more fun as there are no commercials or having to fast forward via the dvr through all of the zillions of commercials to continue the plot.  every time one scene ended, out of habit, i reached for the fast forward button.  now, this is the way to watch any intense plot or fun show.  castle is a must on watching one of the most fun shows still on tv.  great family ties...",1368057600,,787,4.18

3828476,5,B001XRLWPQ,"For me, a very bittersweet introduction to some terrific writing and ensemble acting.  The ""Goodbye"" refers to Steven J. Cannell who passed away not long after doing some guest appearances in Castle's weekly poker game.  He also did some ""Bonus features"" for this 1st season of a comedy/drama/romance that was obviously close to his heart.  Whatever the amount of influence he might have had was most likely in the writing department, which is where its creator, Andrew W.Marlowe, has excelled.  This series is listed in the TV Guide as a ""Comedy"".  But the clever way that drama is woven into the comedy (or vice-versa) makes it even more likable for the viewer.  Plus the interaction of stars Nathan Fillion (Firefly) and lovely Canadian actor Stana Katic (The Librarian #3) is one of the very best on TV these days, PERIOD!  Rick Castle (""Master of the Macabre"") is the well-connected, successful writer whose friendship with the Mayor gets him into the NYPD Precinct for the research he needs for his next series  after he kills off the ""hero"" of his wildly successful crime novels.  His first attraction/confrontation with Detective Kate Beckett (Katic) makes for an instant love/hate relationship that develops well over time, making it almost inevitable that the two will eventually be an ""item"". The supporting cast of Castle makes this a true ensemble piece, with Seamus Dever and John Huertas doing the gopher work and backing up the lead team wonderfully well.  Mystery Writer Rick Castle's family is no less than absolutely charming and equally as quirky (in some respects) as he is.  Molly Quinn is real heartbreaker as Castle's daughter Alexis, a remarkably well grounded young lady, and veteran actress Susan Sullivan is the Grand Dame of the family, Martha Rogers, and provides the connection that every family needs as Castle's Mother.  The development of the characters is terrific, with the viewer getting more and more insight into what makes Castle  and the rest of the characters as well  really tick.  If you remember ""Moonlighting"" or ""The Rockford Files"", you will get very comfortable quickly with Castle.  Did I mention the writing??  One cannot stress enough how well it is done here.  The storylines are varied and equally quirky as some of the characters investigating them.  The City of New York may make this familiar ground for many viewers, and adds to the possibilities of interesting storylines.  This variety of crimes and scoial interaction may be the best thing that has happened to a series on TV for many, many years!  As comfortable as reading a book, you will absolutely find Castle to be a fun evening in front of the Small Screen.  Now in its fifth season, we can only hope that this series has many more to come; as in my mind this is one comedy/drama that is still developing nicely and continues to improve with age.  Fast moving, with great attention to detail, this is something that can be viewed over and over again with a big smile on your face!",1365724800,2,2998,4.881422924901186

3828487,3,B001XRLWPQ,"Nathan Fillion (the star) is very good, as is his female co-star. But each episode (so far) is close to a repeat of the previous episode. The previous show Fillion was in (Firefly) was far better. Firefly was an excellent show and was very sad to see it cancelled after 14 episodes. The movie Serenity, which was based on Firefly and had the same characters was truly excellent.",1365033600,4,378,4.573529411764706
3828488,4,B001XRLWPQ,"Castle, the author is borderline silly. Some of his antics are endearing (Like laser tag and rapier at home with his daughter) and some go over the line...not in a good way. But the rest of the cast, his detective and her men, his Mom and daughter, , and even the plots and author references make up for it.",1365033600,,307,4.220338983050848
3828489,4,B001XRLWPQ,It just took 1 episode to get hooked on this show. It has all anybody really needs in a TV show. The only downside is that its not a full season but that is what happens when  a show starts mid season. Delivery was prompt and on time and in one piece. If you are looking for a great show then Castle would be a awesome choice.,1365033600,,326,3.8656716417910446

3828493,5,B001XRLWPQ,"I didn't watch this series when it first came on and should have. The series is intelligent, excellent acting, delightfully clever scripts, and an ensemble cast that's second to none. This is what good television should be but rarely is. I'm a solid fan of both Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic. They are perfectly matched. As the series progresses, they each learn from the other one and are better for it. I'd like to see this series last for many more years.",1364860800,,459,4.609756097560975

3828497,5,B001XRLWPQ,"What is there to say about one of my favorite crime-drama comedies? Excellent acting by a cast that makes you believe that they are the characters they portray, storylines that incorporate the intricate process of police and detective work, personal relationships, plenty of action, romance and sexual tension, and just the right dose of comedy to make you laugh out loud. Follow these characters as they solve mysteries, assisted by a lovable mystery novelist who uses his own 'criminal mind' to give a different perspective on the 'whodunnit' scenarios in each episode, while at the same time balancing his life as a top-selling author, loving father to a daughter who is rapidly reaching 'adulthood', (most times seemingly more rapidly than HE is), and, to complicate things even more, dealing with his growing feelings for the NYPD detective he is shadowing as a muse for a series of books he is writing. It is a must-see show that is a 'must have' in my collection!",1364688000,,970,4.920731707317073
3828498,5,B001XRLWPQ,I have come to the Castle episodes late by way of reruns.  I am very impressed with the series.  They are like a good book that you can't put down.  Looking forward to the next seasons episode.,1364688000,,193,4.162162162162162
3828499,5,B001XRLWPQ,"Not everyone likes Buddy Shows (where a man and a woman are partners, usually with one of them normal and one unusual). But these shows are overall pretty popular, and have been since TV was invented (Adam 12 anyone?). Recently shows like Psych, Bones, Mentalist, Life and Castle have been popular. And this one is the best of the new bunch in my opinion. First, Stana Katic is stunning as Kate Beckett, which helps a lot. And Nathan Fillian is pretty charming in any role. Their sexual tension works, and the writers have done well to milk it without letting it develop - it works for them. Both contribute to the crime solving, they come to trust each other, the rest of the team is useful, and the dialog is crisp. If Buddy Shows is a genre you enjoy, you should love Castle.",1364515200,,778,4.4475524475524475

3828502,5,B001XRLWPQ,This is my favorite Tv series. Nathan Fillion and the whole cast are great! The combination of comedy drama & romance is perfect. So fun to watch week to week. Even more fun to watch all over again on DVD.,1364256000,,205,4.15

3828509,5,B001XRLWPQ,"And i don't say classic lightly, this is a staple of my house. Castle is really just a lot of fun. I can't stand most shows like this, just too repetitive, and every single one of them (ncis - law and order) is so close in both form and content if you've seen one then you've seen em all. Castle manages to break out of that mold with a VERY strong cast - i can't stress how strong - and great writing.

Give it a shot. If you don't fall in love with Beckett and Castle with the first few episodes you aren't human.",1363564800,,515,3.951923076923077

3828514,5,B001XRLWPQ,"My husband and I both have watched the pilot episode multiple times.  The chemistry between Castle and Beckett is so much fun to watch. She thinks he is a charming bad boy and wonders why he is sticking his nose in her detective work.  He has an insight on her that shows there is more to him than meets the eye.  His homelife is a story all its own - we have a teenager that we can actually adore who has a brilliant future ahead of her, but several ex-wives and a mother who lives in the world of the theater.  I love Castle's writer friends who play poker - real life authors who poke fun at Castle and give an authenticity to the show. Great ensemble cast with great mysteries to solve.  Castle's contributions have more than once been key to finding the killer, but I think his best contribution has been the expresso machine for the precinct.  He may drive Beckett crazy, but she is always one step ahead of him.  Love her.  Love him.  We love this show and only wish they could produce shows faster.",1363219200,,1006,4.28042328042328

3828516,5,B001XRLWPQ,"The interaction between the characters is great. The main character, Castle, is shown as a man with multiple levels of maturity. He is a responsible father to his daughter and yet he can be a man who doesn't want to grow up in a public setting. The other characters also show their human side, which is nice to see.",1363046400,,315,4.3559322033898304

So I watched a few, took a chance on season 1 being good and was rewarded with a highly enjoyable show. Its funny and sweet and cute. I like it and its not very expensive compared to some tv show's seasons.",1359590400,,333,4.301587301587301

3828556,3,B001XRLWPQ,"Generically speaking, as TV shows go, this one IS better then most.

If you're specifically looking for a ""CSI"" type show though, you will be rather disappointed.
This shows strength isn't in it's ""crime drama"" (pretty thin on that front) or it's plots  (VERY formulaic. Every episode is exactly the same, just a different method of murder each week). There are lots of supporting characters but as of season two, they remain 2 dimensional and .
No, this is just a re-tooled version of ""Moonlighting"" or any other ""boy/girl, underlaying awkward tension, episodic TV show"".

What makes this show worth watching (and ""fun"" even) is Nathan Fillion. Not that the rest of the cast isn't good, he just has a presence that pulls the normal into the ""above average"". Still, the show itself (while above average for network TV) is pretty thin.",1359417600,,834,4.859154929577465

I have liked every season, but Season 1 is possibly the best of all.  Nathan Fillion is charming and engaging, and Stana Katic is adept at playing her role with a range of demeanors from intense, vulnerable, and sarcastic to compassionate.

The cast is perfectly matched to their roles and the chemistry makes you want to tune in and not MISS anything-especially the two leads.  This is the perfect romance/mystery novel come to life.  Finally characters I envision in the perfect book!  I ordered the first season and plan to order the rest.  I have recorded many shows on my DVR and sometimes when nothing is on TV I want to watch I enjoy watching the reruns and fast forwarding through the commercials.

This is one of them.  I like watching the shows without commercial breaks (as on the dvd's).  I am very happy to own this set.",1353456000,,285,4.30188679245283
3828638,5,B001XRLWPQ,"A great, guilty pleasure.  Warm fire, pot of tea, and a few hours of careless escape.  Chick-flick fare with some quick-witted dialogue.  This first season is probably the best of the five.",1353369600,,189,4.84375
3828639,5,B001XRLWPQ,I just recently started watching Castle and I am really enjoying it.  The premise sounds stupid but it is surprisingly smart and entertaining.,1353369600,,142,5.173913043478261
3828640,4,B001XRLWPQ,"Okay, so being totally honest here: I do not want to like this show. I first stumbled onto it because I like Nathan Fillion (became a fan because of the Firefly series, which by the way, is really great Sci-Fi). This rating should really be 3.5 stars, but why quibble over half a star, right? First, the negative: this series is really formulaic: Filthy-rich, handsome mystery author Richard Castle decides to follow around super-hot (and smart--credit where credit is due), detective Kate Beckett and her NYPD colleagues to get inspiration for his novels. Because he is well-connected, he gets to follow the detectives around, even in very dangerous situations. Not very realistic, right? No. And of course Castle and Beckett didn't get along well at first. And of course, they now have a constant, though very manufactured-seeming, sexual tension throughout. It's like someone took every Buddy-Cop show cliche and wrote it into these scripts.

But, you'll notice I gave it 4 stars (well 3.5, but who's counting). That's because I am a total sucker for decent ""Whodunit"" mystery shows. On some weird level, Castle and Beckett have a kind of Sherlock Holmes/John Watson thing going on--though at a noticeably lesser intellectual level--with the two of them constantly switching between the Holmes or Watson role. The observations and character development is not as good as the British ""Sherlock"" series (which is excellent, by the way), but it's good enough to be somehow simultaneously smart and mindless entertainment. At the end of a long day--and I've had a lot of them lately--watching an episode of Castle is just what I need. So, if the sitcoms you've been watching are a little TOO mindless, give this a try: it just might be the escape you're looking for.",1353369600,,1765,5.003401360544218
3828641,5,B001XRLWPQ,My former cousin told me how much she loved Castle but it wasn't until this year that I started watching the show.  She was right.  It is now my favorite show.,1353024000,,159,4.096774193548387

3828645,5,B001XRLWPQ,Pleasant generally upbeat mystery series.  Often light and amusing.  The series is more about the interactions between the primary characters then about the intensity of the story line.,1352073600,,185,5.571428571428571
3828646,4,B001XRLWPQ,"Good show,
Good solid characters and as the season develops the characters are displayed admirably. It is fun the suspension of disbelief for a the main characters to continue to function in their roles.

3828650,5,B001XRLWPQ,"The DVD set is beautiful and I like the fact that the discs are not double-sided...even though it's less green that way...but they do use only one plastic case for all three discs so it is somewhat environmentally friendly. There are 10 wonderful episodes...the pilot episode is sure to get any neophyte hooked on Castle. Anyone who is a fan of great writing will love this show and should buy this DVD set: there is humour, there is drama and so much more than can be put into words...except if you're a Castle writer! It's easy to enjoy over and over again...which after all is why you buy DVDs!

I must make mention of the excellent cast, Nathan Fillion, Stana Katic (her first name rhymes with banana! See her website if you don't believe me), Susan Sullivan, Molly Quinn, Jon Huertas, Tamala Jones, Seamus Dever, and Ruben Santiago-Hudson are all impressive and believable in their roles from the beginning, and make this TV show a certifiable classic. There is a very real chemistry between the leads that is exciting and fresh, but there's also a connection within the entire cast which makes watching them so enjoyable.

Because this first season is short, one may feel cheated but the bonus features more than make up for any perceived lack. Anyone who's a fan of Stephen J. Cannell must definitely get this for completion! R.I.P. SJC. :(

""Castle"" doffs its hat to the greats of history, naming the lead female detective who is completely efficient and strikingly beautiful after the first female detective in the US, Kate (Warne), and having amazing story lines that also pay homage to other fascinating characters in the history of crime fiction. Awesomeness!

In Season 1, there are several amazing guest stars, Patrick Bauchau (Carnivale -HBO; The Pretender -NBC/TNT), Caterina Scorsone (Private Practice -ABC; Missing -Lifetime); Jason Brooks (Days of Our Lives, The Pretender), Judy Reyes - of the original ""Little Girl Lost: the Delimar Vera Story"" (Lifetime movie), plus the real-life authors whom Castle hobnobs with at his poker table: James Patterson, Stephen J. Cannell et al.
Definitely worth buying and especially at the low low price Amazon is giving it away for these days - $16.99!
Or you could try to save the earth and get it through Instant video...if you're in the US that is. Netflix used to have Castle...recently dropped it...so there are limited options for people outside the US to own this amazing series.",1350345600,,2442,4.919902912621359

And that says a lot right there, that you can re-watch it and still love it.  Why?  The chemistry all throughout the cast is great.  But the interplay between Castle and Beckett is inspired.  Only a little less so is the relationship between Castle and his daughter Alexis (try NOT loving Molly Quinn -- you can't do it!).  Another big point in it's favor is that it's clear they are trying to make it fun.  There are no obvious ""Emmy grabs"" with deep and dark, gritty stories.  Just an entertaining hour of TV.  Start with a twisted murder scene, throw in some twists and plenty of banter, and sit back and smile.

My brother and I agree that Kate Beckett, Stana Katic, is the most beautiful woman in any series on television!!!  Rick Castle, Nathan Fillion (""Firefly"" and ""Serenity""), is just plain delightful to watch. Castle's relationships with his daughter and mother have depth, humor and respectful tenderness that isn't cloying or pretentious.  The series is well rounded by Castles developing relationships with the rest of the NYPD team.

The image quality and resolution are great, and I only wish they had MORE commentaries on different episodes and MORE special features (or bonus features, as they're called in the DVDs).  There are subtitles in several languages and all the eps are CC.  Worth watching the first and fifth episode for the juicy, fun running commentary from Nathan Fillion (in both) and Stana Katic (in one only, alas!), in addition to Christopher Marlowe's and Rob Bowman's.  Even though I found some eps online and have them in my laptop, this collection offers a lot better quality and sound.  Definitely a requirement for Castle fans!",1345248000,,825,4.774647887323944

3828664,5,B001XRLWPQ,Not your boring everyday crime show. The banter between Castle and Becket will leave you in stitches. He is so far out in left field with wild stories of how the crime came to be and she is so focused on just the facts. These opposite sides collide which solves the crime but with a few twists and turns. I never figure it out until close to the end.  The characters are so well written but what else would you expect of the creator of the Rockford Files. Even the supporting characters are warm and charming.,1344384000,,509,4.302083333333333
3828665,5,B001XRLWPQ,How do you mix comedy and crime drama?  You mix Nathan Fillion with a straight wo(man) like Stana Katic.  It only got better as the season went on.  The only problem would be that it was a half season show so there are only 10 episodes.,1343088000,,236,4.086956521739131

Will they ever get together? Stay tuned! lol. In the meantime see them perry with each other while catching even the craftiest baddies. I have to admit I'm just starting on Season 3 and I do miss some of the extreme cockiness of the Castle from Season 1 (calling in favors and acting like a diva).

3828669,4,B001XRLWPQ,"Good grief! I was a cop for several years and none of the other women on the department could have passed for super models, or dared to dress like Beckett does unless they were on vice detail.

Yet, seeing Beckett parade around in skin tight mini skirts and plunging necklines (such as her role as the Russian girlfriend!) is so ridiculous it adds to the hilarity of the series. But it takes away any possibility of taking the show seriously. Then again, I suppose if I want reality, I'll watch old episodes of Police Story.

The dialogue is fast paced and well written (a rariety today) and both primary the secondary actors are excellent. The plotlines are complex without becoming Byzantine. And I ****LOVE**** the inclusion of Castle's daughter and mother. That was a bit of genius on the part of the writers. Without them, Castle would be so one-dimensional he's be uninteresting.

However, this year seemed to offer something new and different. ""Castle"" (and ""Revenge"", though unrelated except for both being on ABC) show what writers can create when not constrained by too many stereotypes of what a popular/profitable show should be. Yes, there are legitemate challenges that it is a stereotypical ""ensemble police dramedy."" However, I believe the performances of many of the characters overcome any complaint of the show being unoriginal. In fact, I would say that it is one of my top 5 shows in the past couple of years.

I am not disappointed.  This first season has a noticeable fresh approach to the genre.  The characters while not fully developed in personality (understandably so early on), are slightly exaggerated version of their current selves, especially Castles mom.  This left me with a feeling kin to flipping through a high school year book, seeing funny pictures of them in the past.  Everyone has matured and mellowed now, the plot too.  The Castle/Beckett interaction is quirky, playful and fun which is different from today's more serious tone.

3828693,5,B001XRLWPQ,"There isn't much I can say about the series that hasn't already been said... it's great and the character interactions make it a joy to watch. Season 1 was a great introduction to the characters and, in my opinion, it only gets better. They've built up a great head of steam with this show and, again in my opinion, every season is a must see. Now into its fourth season the show shows no sign or slowing down. I've got season 2 shipping right now and season 3 on pre-order. Looking forward to enjoying them again and again. :)

That said I'll touch on the media and packaging... it is also great. Three single sided DVDs with nice artwork on the top and in a well designed DVD case. It isn't rocket science but I still run into sets that are poorly constructed or obviously had corners cut at the expense of quality. This isn't one of them.",1313366400,,841,4.322784810126582
3828694,5,B001XRLWPQ,"Though the season is a lot shorter than most runs, it barely takes a full episode to come to understand the pacing and mood. Fan favourite Nathan Fillion plays Richard Castle, a long time best-selling author with incredible wit and charisma. He dotes on his daughter (played beautifully by Molly Quinn) and adores his mother (Susan Sullivan). There is obviously a great chemistry between this television family.

And then comes Detective Kate Beckett (a hard role to do justice, yet performed with subtle grace by Stana Katic), a hard-edged supercop who also happens to be a fan of the titular character. So when a crime scene mimics one that Castle has written into a novel, the detective goes to gain some insight from her literary guilty pleasure.

And from there, comedy and crime drama explode like you wouldn't believe.

There have been an annoying surge of crime dramas, some better, some worse. It is my opinion Castle ranks among the best. This season features a few commentaries, a few featurettes and a 5.1 digital sound track. I try pretty hard to avoid spoilers if at all possible, so I'll try and sum things up as best as possible: if you enjoy Fillion's other performances (Firefly and Serenity, White Noise 2, Slither) then you must watch this series as it is a more nuanced feel with many subtle layers. And of course, his real-world wit and charisma. He carries the show very well and it is easy to see why the show has been picked up for more seasons.

This is one of the better shows currently on television; don't miss out on this one!",1313366400,,1556,4.6678832116788325

3828696,5,B001XRLWPQ,I bought this after getting hooked on the show midway through Season 2. It's probably the best little known show out there. I am addicted and can't wait for the new season so the DVD has helped ease the addiction until September.,1311120000,,229,4.476190476190476
3828697,5,B001XRLWPQ,"You know, at first, i was hesitant to watch this show. Another crime drama? I mean, how many NCIS, CSI's and Law & Orders do we really need? However, i knew that Nathan Fillion was in it, so i TEVO'd a few episodes. I still hemmed and hawed, until finally, i gave in to curiosity and gave it a go. What i realized is that this was really a stellar show. Unlike the other crime drama's out there, this show really makes a point of not taking itself too seriously. While it deals with serious topics, it also is good for quite a few laughs in every episode. The interplay between Fillion and Katic is awesome, and the rest of the cast is perfect as well. So, a few episodes into the first season, once i actually watched them, and i was hooked. Plus, if you really pay attention, you'll find a reference to Firefly in every episode...the writers and/or directors tribute to Fillion himself, who is arguably one of the more beloved actors in this generation.
The first season is a must for any collection.",1310774400,,1002,4.39247311827957
3828698,4,B001XRLWPQ,"This series is promising but overall somewhat disappointing. The acting is fair but the main actor, a witty writer, seems content with delivering his lines with a quasi-cheesinsess that borders on campiness. Which can be enjoyable in the right context but his female counter part, a spunky cop, isn't the right compliment. The effect is that both actors seem out of place. Many of the plots are good enough, along the lines of a British cozy, but they don't have the believability of a really great mystery.

So while the actors are appealing enough (I did like the girl who plays the writer's daughter) I found myself thinking I should like the series when I actually wasn't really enjoying it much. I give the series four stars instead of three for generally avoiding the supposed provocativeness prevalent in most shows of this genre.",1310515200,,837,4.853146853146853

3828713,5,B001XRLWPQ,"I first stumbled upon Castle a year and a half ago while channel surfing for something to watch at 10pm.  I came upon Castle and instantly loved it (I'm a sucker for crime shows)  The cast is great.  The basic storyline (murder of the week, suspect, etc) has been done to death (CSI, BONES, Law and Order, etc), however to me, it's still very enjoyable and unpredictable.  So naturally, when I saw this on sale for $12, it screamed to me ""BUY ME!""

The acting, writing is good, and the interaction between the characters are good.  It has action, crime, mystery, comedy, and murder all in one.  I'd say it's quite a catch.

I'm not much of a commentary fan, behind the scenes, etc fan; however, the ones on the DVD are quite interesting.  I mainly brought this to show my love for the series and to watch whenever I feel like it.",1295222400,2,829,4.366013071895424

3828732,5,B001XRLWPQ,"I really like this show. Nathan Fillion plays Richard Castle, crime novelist par excellence, who, in his search for new material, gets himself permanently attached (practically at the hip) to NYPD Detective Kate Becket (Stana Katic); in true Holmes and Watson mode, they go around solving crimes.

Castle, with his mystery writer's background, often contributes mightily to the crime solving, AND he makes Becket famous as ""Nikki Heat,"" his latest literary creation.

Becket's of two minds about this. At first, she resents having to sheepdog Castle, but as the first season progresses they bond. She also enjoys her notoriety as Nikki Heat, but it sometimes becomes a burden. Her superiors expect her to close every case she gets. She becomes a folk hero to Castle's fans, and a target to the lunatic fringe. Katic, running armed down an alleyway in black jeans is why they invented DVR!

Castle, for his part, enjoys the sleuthing, and its obvious he loves both the character of Nikki Heat and her inspiration, whom he very much also admires. Although Castle the bestselling author is sometimes impenetrable to others, he is a warm, funny man who loves his High School-aged daughter and his in-residence mother.

The handsome Fillion and the beautiful Katic have a wonderful chemistry onscreen, and I hope this New York-based show lasts many seasons, especially since those NBC boneheads decided to tank LAW & ORDER. The only real downside to CASTLE is that it is a near-clone of BONES, another of my favorite few shows (HOUSE is the third; the rest are in re-runs).

Hopefully, the viewership won't tire of two intelligently-written shows brimming with drama and humor, fueled by the sexual tension in a smart, witty partnership between two good-looking people, one male and one female. You know, I don't think they will tire of it. I know I won't.",1285027200,,1851,4.977346278317152

The actors are all well chosen (especially Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic). Very good chemistry between the two main characters. The idea of involving a novelist in murder investigations gives an interesting result, from which follow most of the funny scenes. The dialogues are not neglected. Some lines are already cult!

After several months and reading the rave reviews, we tried again.  We got through 4 shows this time.  We found the daughter is by far the most interesting character.  The mother has some merits.  The rest is simply bad acting and bad writing.  For example in the 4th or 5th episode the bad guy comes into the room blazing.  Our fine detective is on the phone to her office.

3828751,5,B001XRLWPQ,"In the vast wasteland of Network television, occasionally a bright flame will appear; usually it is snuffed out before it can find its voice or a viewer following.  Instead of giving us another CSI: Louisville or Law And Order: The Special Parking Squad, the minds at ABC Studios came up with something a bit newer, a little quirky, overall very entertaining and a boon to us writers, a hero named Richard Castle.
Castle introduces us to the series lead, Richard Castle (Nathan Fillion, Firefly), a writer that has the time honored problem that plagues all writers; writer's block.  On the surface Castle has all the things we writers aspire to; he's famous, he has a large (though it appears mostly female) following, he's rich, and his poker buddies are other famous writers.  However he is also a single father of a teenage daughter, Alexis (Molly C. Quinn, My One and Only) who is a fair match for her father's intellect, and has to deal with his mother, Martha Rodgers (Susan Sullivan, Dharma and Greg) who relives her glory days on Broadway, thinks her son's career needs her guidance, while also living with them.
Castle's opposite is an attractive, street-smart NYPD homicide detective, Kate Beckett (Stana Katic, The Spirit) who is driven to solve unusual cases, and has deep reasons for doing so.  Her, and subsequently her team, Javier Esposito (Jon Huertas, NCIS) and Kevin Ryan (Seamus Dever, Army Wives), are unwillingly drawn into Castle's world, when his invades Beckett's in a series of murders, based on Castle's novels.
The chemistry of the two leads (Fillion and Katic) is substantial and the duo play well against each other, but more importantly the supporting cast is just as strong; which also include Lanie Parish (Tamala Jones, The Wood) a medical examiner and friend of Beckett, Roy Montgomery (Ruben Santiago-Hudson, The West Wing) Beckett's boss who is frequently amused at Castle's irritation of Beckett, Meridith (Darby Staunchfield, Private Practice) Castle's first ex-wife who brings a new definition to ""deep fried Twinkie"" (trust me, you just have to see the episode).  The viewers should offer kudos to the casting people and the writers, for putting together this team.
After their initial investigation, Castle has decided that he has found his muse and the answer to his writer's block, in the form of Detective Beckett.  Using his considerable pull with the mayor of the city, he manages to get assigned to Beckett's team, while she works her cases; he takes notes for his new book series.
Cleverly written, quality acting and inviting to viewers, Castle, blends together some of the better characteristics of former television detectives, such as Remington Steel/Laura Holt and Maddie Hayes/David Addison.
If you enjoy a good police story and a little comedy touch to your drama, then you should be watching Castle.",1273449600,3,2856,5.053078556263269

3828757,5,B001XRLWPQ,"Nathan Fillion is an amazing performer and as the world famous author--tag-along Richard Castle - he will definately make you laugh. Castle is truly a good spirited, kind-hearted almost rustic romantic with an incredibly human side. He is a very compassionate father and the victimized son of a long-term 'dedicated' actress mother. Besides writing murder mystery novels his new kick is trying not to be irritating - but often is - to Kate Beckett (Stana Katic), the NYPD detective. His inspiration for his next set of novels is Det. Becket. The chemistry between Fillion and Katic is eletric and humorous and defiantely organic. It was the charm of Murder She Wrote with the humor of Lou Grant meets House. Unlike most criminal investigation shows, Castle focuses on the story of the murder. The twist after twist after twist. What's really cool is the murderer is literally NEVER who you think it is. Great cast, great writing and just a lot of fun.

The bonus materials include the behind the scenes interviews with the stars, out takes, deleted scenes, and more.

This is a great family show. Fresh and fun adn has several of the producers from Star Trek: The Next Generation. So the writing is intelligent and thoughtful. A must for every fan of murder mystery television.  Lorenzo M.  (4-10)",1271116800,3,1297,4.881818181818182
3828758,5,B001XRLWPQ,"Castle is one of those rare occurrences, like when all the stars align, and everything works.

This series is just too damned clever.

Let's start with the premise. What was Andrew Marlowe thinking when he wrote the pilot? ""I like procedurals, but I don't want to make another CSI.  I like comedy, but sitcoms really aren't my thing. I like smart, witty banter that doesn't play to the dumbest member of the audience. Oh, I've got it! And he's such an ass...Castle that everybody loves him.""

Enter Beckett. The chemistry between Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic's characters is palpable, not forced.  She hates him; she admires him; she's flattered by him; she hates him. The audience wants them to get together but knows they can't.

Watch Stana's reactions when she's not talking, that's something you can't teach folks.

In fact the whole cast works so well together that their ad libs make the writers look even better - And the writers cleverly continue to challenge Castle's characters and compel the viewer.

Great directing, outstanding art direction and wardrobe, well-placed music (remember ""Everybody Loves Me"" ?)

It's so nice to see producers and writers who actually believe their audience will not only get it, but will love it.

You will too.",1270771200,2,1257,4.942857142857143

3828766,5,B001XRLWPQ,"Mystery writer extraordinaire Rick Castle (Nathan Fillion) rubs elbows with many celebrities and even has the mayor of New York on speed dial. His friendship with the mayor lands him the pleasure of shadowing Detective Kate Beckett (Stana Katic), much to her dismay. When Beckett realizes a recent string of murders follow story lines in the author's books, she shows up at a book launch party to question Castle. The pair has chemistry that sizzles, though Beckett won't admit it. She has always been a fan of the author, and now that she has met him, she grudgingly sees the real man she describes as a 9 year-old on a sugar rush. Castle is a devoted father to Alexis (Molly Quinn) and a patient son to Martha Rodgers (Susan Sullivan). The family moments are very touching. This entire cast works well together. Castle is the flamboyant gadget geek with a hint of sarcasm and Beckett is the straight laced cop. Police Captain Roy Montgomery (Ruben Santiago-Hudson) is definitely in charge of his precinct, but he also knows the importance of mixing humor in the daily grind. Javier Esposito (Jon Huertas) and Kevin Ryan (Seamus Dever) are pitch perfect as detectives who work alongside Beckett. Dr. Lanie Parish (Tamala Jones) plays the ME who is also a friend of Beckett's, and sees the growing attraction between the two crime solvers.

3828770,4,B001XRLWPQ,"Much as I am loath to watch yet another TV cop show - having gotten to the point in the last decade or so when I could see about every possible plot angle coming in the first five minutes - and about every possible buddy pairing imaginable - my daughter talked me into this one. ""Mom, it stars Nathan Fillion - Captain Mal! It can't possibly be that bad!""
And to my mild surprise, it wasn't that bad; quite good, in fact: not for the actual crime-solving puzzles involved, but for the play of personalities - Richard Castle, the celebrity mystery author and dilettante, and Kate Beckett, the driven and earnest police detective, working together and striking creative and almost-but-not-quite romantic sparks off each other. In a lot of ways, it's a throwback, not just to TV shows like Moonlighting, but to 1930's William Powell and Myrna Loy, in ""The Thin Man"" series - an engaging merge of the who-dunnit with firecracker wit, sexual attraction and glamorous Manhattan, into one delicious trifle of intriguing characters and snappy conversation.
The supporting characters are not neglected when it comes to delivering crackling good lines; notably Kate's work buddies, Detectives Esposito and Ryan, and the sharp-tongued medical examiner, Dr. Parish. Castle's personal life - he lives with a refreshingly grounded teenage daughter, and his mother, a flamboyant former Broadway star - rounds out the character of Castle. He is a good and responsible father, and possesses connections and skills - notably a writer's sharp observation and intuition about characters - which are a good fit for Beckett's determination and laser-sharp focus. In personalities, they are opposites: he is talkative, open, creative, whereas she is focused, stoic, and more inward. Part of the charm is how they act on each other - she opens up, just a little bit, and he seems to become a bit more responsible, as the season progresses.

Of the extras included, the most amusing is ""Write Along With Nathan Fillion"" - where he and producer-writer Stephen Cannell spend the day together, in the interests of Fillion learning to be a mystery writer. It's almost as much fun as any of the episodes of the show.",1269043200,,2186,4.972677595628415

3828776,5,B001XRLWPQ,"I don't usually have time to watch TV, being a grad student in physical therapy and juggling my time between jobs in the process, but a year ago I stumbled across a preview for Castle on ABC at 10pm, and its somewhat opened up my interest in viewing primetime TV again, even in other shows.  Ironically, that's a decent time for me to watch TV, and having been a person who thoroughly enjoyed Firefly back before my professional pursuits took hold, I have an appreciation for Nathan Fillion (as well as Adam Baldwin in Chuck, which earns my #2 favorite TV show spot).  Castle hooked me from the start, and I've watched every episode since its release with a bit of help by my DVR, and this DVD has just added to the fun.  I can sit and watch some of these episodes multiple times and still get an enjoyment from them, which is substantial when it comes to buying a DVD.  House is the only other show that I can say I've been able to rewatch more than twice and still be engrossed in the acting.

Nathan and Stana do an amazing job of balancing the story plots and their underlying ""No I'm not"" attraction and it makes for interesting situations as well as some moments where there feels like genuine emotion has taken hold.  I've seen Stana in an episode of 24 prior to Castle and didn't think much of her, but her performance in 24 is nothing like it is in Castle.  She's a much better actress than I was initially left to believe after her brief appearance opposite Keifer Sutherland.

Castle is a genuinely good time and fun to watch over and over, and unlike most cop shows, Castle proves that some lighthearted comedy can work with serious undertones as long as the characters were designed to be believable, and the actors able to act.",1266796800,,1741,4.435736677115988

3828781,5,B001XRLWPQ,"Love this series! It's less clinical and often more fun than CSI, plus it has something much more to offer viewers. This show is a skillful combination of romance/sexual tension, crime drama and a peek into the writing life. Regarding the latter, it should be said that Castle represents authors who are in the elite 1-2% of the fiction world (those who have ""made it"" and hit the best seller list regularly). He represents only a handful who have achieved that much notoriety. And yet, Nathan Fillion, with help from good script writers, portrays so well in Castle that daunting pendulum swing from self-doubt to immense bravado, that constant companion that stalks any author throughout his or her career, that this makes him more real and accessible to us as viewers. Writers will tell you, no matter how famous they are, that all books have a life of their own and provide a roller coaster of emotion during every stage of the process from concept to publication. I imagine this is true of most artists, whatever their medium.

Add to this perceptively portrayed writer one very hot detective (Castle's ""muse"") who is a strong woman, excellent at her job and an inspiration to the writer... all of it framed by an interesting murder case to investigate on each show and peppered with lots of sexual tension between the main characters, and you have a perfect recipe for fun entertaining television. The fact that the show's writers have not relegated Castle's mother and daughter to being two-dimensional props, but continue to bring them to the forefront of the story to support depth in Castle's character, and to allow us to learn more about him, should keep this show on the air for some time.",1266364800,,1701,4.805460750853243
3828782,5,B001XRLWPQ,"""Castle"" is an extrememly entertaining series and a pleasure to watch.  Nathan Fillion plays Richard Castle, a best-selling mystery author.  Through his friendship with the Mayor, he gets to team up with NY detective Kate Beckett and help her solve the various homicides that come their way.  Fillion who was terrific on the prematurely-cancelled ""Firefly"" is just as good here.  However it is Stana Katic as detective Beckett who really steals the show.  I had never seen this Canadian actress before, (except for a brief appearance at the conclusion of the Bond flick ""Quantum of Solace,"") but she is both likeable and sympthetic as the put-upon homicide detective.  She is tall, beautiful and moves like she must have done some modeling.  She and Fillion work well together.  They get great support from the other two male homicide detectives that assist them and are there for basically comic-relief.  Susan Sullivan also steals most scenes as the tart-tongued mother of ""Castle,"" a former Broadway star who lives with him and his precocious teenage daughter.  The daughter is excellently played by Molly Quinn, who among other things has the most beautiful blue eyes I've seen.
This is a great show with wonderful dialogue, a terrific cast and great scripts.  If you want an hour of sophisticated entertainment, you should watch it.

Stana Katic, the lead detective that plays opposite Fillion, more than holds her own as a keep-it-business professional who keeps him on his toes.  The balance of the ensemble cast provides a talented backdrop for the daily lives of the characters, and gives the show more depth than many of the detective-type shows on TV today.",1264809600,,630,4.915094339622642

The show may be somewhat formulaic in its crime solving, but what makes the show excellent is its cast and fun dialogue/interactions.

The main character, as a somewhat jaded, burned out crime novelist, is also a good father, exasperated son, and is on good terms with at least one of his ex-wives. I really enjoy that the show is as much about the characters as it is about the mystery.

Each episode gets better and better. Each show is totally stand-alone, but you want to watch them in order because Castle and Beckett grow and mature as individual characters and as a dynamic duo. The result is that the show starts out very formula but adds depth with each episode until the season finally when the game Castle and Beckett have been playing all season steps over a line and becomes stops being a game.

As a mid-season replacement, there are only 10 episodes in this ""Complete First Season"", so know that going in. But considering that I think each episode is worth two of most other series out there, it is still a bargain. The initial episodes have expired off the hulu server, but you can get them on iTunes or possible here on Amazon.

You might have to watch more than one episode, but I believe you will get pulled in.  More of a lighthearted ""Cop"" show (nothing like the CSI's).  I'd rather have my kids watch this than the CSI shows (and I do like the CSI shows).",1262908800,,599,4.294642857142857

3828797,5,B001XRLWPQ,"""Castle"" is a fun romp through the murder mystery genre that thoroughly captivates with its plot twists, surprise endings, appealing characters and witty verbal interplay.  It is an intellectual drama (not junk food for your brain) with just the right touch of comedy and quirkiness to entertain and surprise, and  happily does so without the gross-out effects common to most murder mysteries on television today.  Adding to the enjoyment level is the fact that there are no interruptions for those annoying and interminably-long commercial breaks, resulting in sufficient continuity in the plot development to allow the viewer to truly experience the emotional impact intended by the screenwriter(s).  What could be better than watching your favorite t.v. show as if it's a ""mini-movie""?  ""Castle: The Complete First Season"" is a great show to begin or add to any television lover's ""t.v. on video"" collection so that even when there's nothing on the tube to watch, you will always have something on the tube to watch!",1262649600,,1019,5.189024390243903

When I found out Fillion was going to star in Castle I had to watch it. Unfortunately, I missed much of the season. Thank God for Hulu - they had several episodes still available to watch. I was hooked!

I love who dunnit's with quirky consultants (like Psych, which is another awesome show!) Castle being an author was a great twist. And no this is not like Murder She Wrote. This is fun and funny. The character's banter and Castle's family interactions make the show work.

Nathan plays Rick Castle, a playboy writer who gets involved with the police when a copycat killer's targets mimic some of the murders in his books. I'll let you read the general synopsis for more details so I don't give too much away. One of the best parts of this show is the great relationship between Rick and his daughter, Alexis (Molly Quinn). Finally, a portrayal of a normal, happy, intelligent teenager on a TV program! There are many other interesting characters, including a couple guest roles by Buffy alumni. Nathan is witty, campy and dashing as ever in this well-written show.

3828807,5,B001XRLWPQ,"CASTLE is must-see TV for me, and not because it has anything lofty to say about the world or is trying to wow you with CSI-esque SFX and gadgetry.  CASTLE hearkens back to the classic '70s detective shows, where murders were solved by tracking down leads, using their brains, and cracking wise every now and again.

Richard Castle (Nathan Fillion) is the playboy, Pulitzer winning, crime novelist who, through his connections with the Mayor, manages to finagle a ride-along with NYC homicide Detective Kate Beckett (Stana Katic).  After working with her and her team (Jon Huertas and Seamus Dever) on a case about a serial killer staging the murders like scenes in Castle's Derrick Storm novels, Castle decides that Beckett is the perfect muse from which to base his new series and break his writer's block after he killed off Storm out of boredom.  Kate is forced to put up with Castle's immaturity and blatant romantic advances because the NYC Police Department is in need of some good PR.

You definitely have to suspend your belief over things like: would a female homicide cop really run/break down doors wearing heels (albeit not high-heeled pumps, thank goodness); would a writer would be allowed this much access to evidence, interrogation, and suspects; a writer definitely wouldn't be riding along for this amount of time no matter how friendly he was with the mayor; and would he conveniently have the skills and connections to help solve so many murders.  This is not a show for those of you looking for CSI-like gritty, forensic crime dramas or dark, police procedurals.  The crime solving -- working through evidence & suspect leads, with a few twists along the way -- is secondary to the relationships and brainstorming.

Having no detailed/graphic forensic evidence explanations and being light on the action, Castle is really about the romantic dance between Castle's ""6 year old on a sugar rush"" crush on Beckett and Beckett holding him at bay with her wit and fortitude.  It's more like ""Moonlighting"" or ""Remington Steele"".  We also see Castle's  relationship grow with the other homicide detectives Esposito & Ryan and Captain Montgomery (Ruben Santiago-Hudson).  His home-life provides a nice counterpoint to his on-the-job shenanigans, where the loving bond of father and daughter (Molly Quinn) and son and mother (Susan Sullivan) -- even though they are (refreshingly) non-traditional takes on these roles -- show that Castle isn't just a spoiled, childish jerk.

As long as you approach the show as a fun, light, escapist romp, I think anyone can enjoy it.

The first episode is a bit heavy-handed on making Rick as obnoxious and over-the-top as possible.  The mother's character is also written that way for the first half of the season.  By the second half, the writers seemed to realize that she can be wacky without being obnoxious and the character makes the family dynamic work. The father-daughter moments between Fillion & Quinn are worth their weight in gold.  By season two, the show is a well oiled machine and all of the characters shine.

As for the extras, the audio commentaries, ""Whodunit"" and ""Godfather"" features are fun and insightful; the bloopers and outtakes are hilarious; the ""Write-along"" is a bit forced at first, but ends up being a lot of fun too.",1261094400,,3301,4.992700729927007
3828808,5,B001XRLWPQ,"I have long been a Nathan Fillion fan, ever since his stint as Caleb on ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" and of course as Mal on Firefly & Serenity.
So I was already set to like CASTLE.
Not only do I absolutely LOVE this show, it rates as one of only 5 shows I bother to buy on DVD when released.

An immature crime novelist paired with a ""just the facts, ma'am"" type of police detective. It's an oddball pairing that just flows so naturally and enjoyably in my opinion.

Nathan as Richard Castle is pure comedic genius! His arrogance is laced with a kind of ""playboy"" charm that makes the character impossible not to like.

Then there's Stana Katic who plays detective, Kate Beckett. The character is tough and smart, yet shows just enough sensitivity and heart to prevent her from being just some jaded (b)itch.

The obvious chemistry the characters feels for each other is actually done believably. Castle is kind of blatent in his attraction toward her, while Beckett is more coy and playful about it.

But what REALLY impresses me is how the stories don't feel like ""Eh, they did that kind of episode on this OTHER show before."" The writers do a great job of taking what would normally be a ""been there, done that"" storyline, and they make it actually feel like I've never seen that kind of story before.

The only bad thing I can say about this show isn't even ABOUT the show, but rather about the network. There are only 12 episodes in this first season, so you're only getting a little more than half of what you'd buy from a typical season's DVDs.
Also, while I loved the special features, they were very minimal. The best one is when Nathan Fillion spends a day with Stephen J. Cannell on how to portray a writer. Hilarious moments from both men!

If you're a Nathan Fillion fan, this is a no-brainer: Buy this DVD set.
For the rest of the people reading this, all I can say is this: If you want to watch a well written drama for a change, that has some of the best comedy laced though it, this will DEFINITELY be worth buying!

That's My Opinion, But You're Welcome To It!",1260316800,,2077,4.4188481675392675

3828813,5,B001XRLWPQ,"There is nothing much to say that has not been covered in other reviews or the product summary by Amazon or even the TV Guide or another entertainment guide's review. ""Castle"" is a plain out overall fun murder mystery show. Everything from the actors (the always underrated Nathan Fillion and the always lovely Stana Katic), the murders and the dialogue are fresh. I am not saying fresh in the sense that the series has re-invented the wheel, but fresh compared to over serious and seriously OVER/DONE/CANCEL ALREADY crime shows out there like ""CSI"", ""NCSI"" and ""Law & Order"" (all spin offs included). The thing that works for this show is the humor combined with the dialogue and the playful chemistry of the stars. It almost reminds me of the playful nature of ""Ellery Queen"" (thanks to re-runs on A&E I can reference that), ""Nero Wolfe"" or even earlier ""Murder, She Wrote"" episodes.

Bottom line the series is a good time that helps you take your mind off of the real world around you and to me that is good solid entertainment.

The DVD set has your standard transfer. Everything looks good, at least for me I have not seen anything wrong.  The audio when piped through a surround sound system is all there (like I said standard stuff). I honestly can say if there is one complaint I have with anything here it is the opening DVD menu. Being a Graphic Designer, I just feel that the title should fade in like it does, the pen should come in on the A, title fades out and menu commands come up. Instead the pen shows up on the left and stay, the title is just in and out with no pen motion and the menu commands come up. I am using this as an example of how I find nothing wrong with this set at all and need at least one thing to complain about.

I feel that this will be an excellent addition to any crime show/murder mystery fan or someone who is just looking for a fun show to watch.",1259280000,,1890,4.3760683760683765

Most shows about which you could make that last comment are cast with some very strange actors all doing their own schtick, but this show is well-integrated: a truly stellar ensemble cast. Admittedly, I'd be happy listening to Nathan Fillion read the phone book, but he doesn't hog the jokes. His reactions to the other characters, which are often hilarious, feel real; he's not scene stealing, he's enhancing. Love this show! I wish there had been more bloopers, but overall the disk set of the first season is well produced with nice packaging and it arrived from Amazon in good shape. Small plug for Amazon shipping department: I've never received anything damaged from them, a fact that sends me back to Amazon all other things being equal.",1258761600,,896,4.862745098039215
3828817,4,B001XRLWPQ,"The only reason I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the first season was a mid-season replacement, with only 10 episodes, and it did not start as strong as it is in the current second season. There is much to like about this show. The family scenes really humanize the main character, who would be a bit of a jerk otherwise. His relationship with his daughter is one of the best on tv currently.

I really like the fact that this series does not fall into the problem most mysteries have had in the past, such as Murder, She Wrote. There is a reason this non-professional is involved in the crime solving rather than having people get murdered wherever he goes. Also, the victims are interesting, because at first you do not really care that much about them, but as you learn more, you gain more sympathy for them and start to really want the killer to be caught. This is also different from some mysteries where the victim is someone you could picture as having many enemies so there would be more suspects.

The writing is good, and the acting is great, as you really come to see these characters as real people. I hope the series continues for a long time to come, as long as they keep the quality up. I am glad that the second season will be a full 22 episodes.",1258156800,6,1271,4.313807531380753
3828818,5,B001XRLWPQ,"'Castle' is an entertaining, witty and fast-moving detective series, much in the vein of greats like 'Moonlighting'. Richard Castle, played by a wonderfully sharp and sarcastic Nathan Fillion, is an egotistical crime writer who, short of inspiration,  starts to tag along with Homicide Detective Beckett (Stana Katic) on her cases, at first annoying her, but later garnering her begrudging respect as the series moves forward.

The balance between Castle's quirky home life and the cases to be solved is perfect - the only major flaw in the series seems to be Castle's ability to repetitively come to stunning conclusions when the detectives seem to have suddenly forgotten how to make basic deductions, leaving the viewer feeling some of the plotlines were overly contrived. Nevertheless, the chemistry between Fillion and gifted newcomer Katic is undeniable, although the role-reversal relationship between Castle and his daughter (played by the wonderful Molly Quinn) has to be the highlight of the series.

Overall, if you like snappy, clever dialogue, and a jolly decent mystery-with-a-twist, 'Castle' is for you.
At a strong 4.5, you won't be disappointed.",1257984000,,1162,5.4088397790055245

3828820,5,B001XRLWPQ,"After seeing Firefly I had a real appreciation for the comedic timing of Nathan Fillion. But the great thing about that series and its' big screen installment 'Serenity', was that it created a wonderful platform that also showcased the amount of heart he puts into a character. When I saw commercials for Castle I knew I wanted to give it a shot. I was so highly entertained by the wit and charm of both leads. Not to mention the chemistry that they exude. This show is not just the regular will they or won't they treatment. The personal moments of revelation for the leads gives a depth to the 'relationship' that they are building. It is quirky and smart with a wonderful supporting cast and some very potent cases. The first season has it's lite and funny moments, with the characters shooting out their own one-liners at crime scenes, (which I think is more tongue in cheek service for some other forensic shows and their one-liners). The lite moments make for some powerful contrast to the earnest and heartfelt responses that the characters have over such cases involving a child abduction as just one example of the cases that cut a little too close to home.
A show that is always entertaining, with it's own spin on the who-dunnit crime drama. It is so much more than that. Not just fitting of being called drama (crime drama) or comedy. It is such a rare blend that touches many bases and yet doesn't seem to fail. It falls in the category for me like the show 'Due South'. At some moments quirky, charming, romantic, comedic, dramatic, while always backed up by heart.
If you like a show that gives those little details- family moments for Castle- (great mother/son moments) (touching father/daughter moments)
Some character backstory for Beckett (loss of her mother) (the audience knowing she is totally in love with Castle's ...writing) She was a major fan which is a wonderful way to play off why she would fall for this sometimes immature novelist.
More little details- the card games- (you have to watch to know what I mean)
And wonderful character interaction with all of the supporting characters of the police department. Tamala Jones and Stana Katic (the dress sequence/girlfriend moment at Beckett's) - another must see moment.
Very nice to see a program that gives the little moments in between the standard action that can make a show seem very nuts and bolts.
For a truly fun ride I would seriously recommend checking out Castle. If you think I'm wrong let the show speak for itself. You won't be disappointed.",1257379200,,2534,4.7482993197278915

The mix between comedy and drama is just right, and the acting is spot on. What I love most about this show is not just the relationship between Castle and Beckett, but the relatinoship Castle shares with his daughter and mother. It is most refreshing to see such a level-headed teenager on television who is mature enough to take care of herself and knows when to ask for help. The supporting cast in this show is just as impressive as the main stars. Molly Quinn shines as Castle's daughter, Alexis, and Susan Sullivan is perfectly cast as Castle's mother.

Castle and Beckett butt heads, but Beckett can't deny that Castle's unique perspective as a crime novelist and his random collection of contacts (the NYC mayor, who he has on speed dial, mobsters, an expert in VooDoo, an appropriately evasive CIA agent, etc.) help solve crimes when the trail would have otherwise gone cold.

The clever and biting dialogue between Castle and Beckett brings to mind scenes from Hepburn and Tracy movies. Romantic tension does underlie the story lines, but for those of you who hate romance between the lead characters, don't worry the writers seem to understand that any actual romance would ruin the series. What's shown in episodes/story lines is snark and two people who are too proud to even admit they find the other attractive.

All in all, watch this show. If you don't want to invest in this whole season (yet), buy the pilot from Amazon on Demand and/or watch new episodes, Mondays @ 10/9c on ABC.

Thanks ABC and all the Castle cast and crew for such a refreshing and entertaining show!",1255996800,,1857,5.035830618892508
3828832,5,B001XRLWPQ,"I used to enjoy Moonlighting more for the playful banter between Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd, even though the mysteries were mostly silly or transparent and frequently both.  Then they ruined it by sleeping together and spent too much time talking about the need to share feelings (I'm male - it shows in this review, huh?;-)

Castle manages to duplicate much of the fun of Moonlighting without the silliness.  It is a SERIOUS mystery show where the mysteries take time to unravel.  But the chemistry between Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic makes the screen sizzle and it is all great fun.

I actually look forward to the end of ""Dancing with the Stars"" (if I'm watching with my wife) or ""The Big Bang Theory"" (if I'm watching by myself) to watch this show.",1255996800,,761,4.69172932330827

It reminds me of a combination of some of my other favorites: Monk, Numbers, and House, which all (oddly enough) happen to be one word titles.  For those of you who don't know, it's about a writer (Castle) who is tired of writing Dereck Stone novels.  He's rich and flamboyant, which works well with Dectective Kate Beckett whom he meets when a murderer is copy-catting how people are murdered in his books. He assists in finding the murderer, but realizes that he has found his inspiration for his new hero, Nikki Heat (taken from Beckett).  He pulls some strings and gets to work side by side with Beckett on murder cases, using his vast knowledge of murder mysteries to help solve ongoing investigations.  It's a wonderful cast on an even better show. Want more proof? Check it out on Monday night, 9pm (central standard time) on ABC.",1255910400,,979,4.597701149425287

3828838,4,B001XRLWPQ,"A fine cast of  well-written characters on CASTLE breaks through a set of stereotypes to create a witty set of who-done-it tales.  Wit, charm, and intelligence are hallmarks of the series and therefore the DVDs.  We have seen the strong but self-destructive female detective brilliantly portrayed (SAVING GRACE), the  hero-dependent waif ( (THE MENTALIST) and a creator of a career that jeopardizes  her real world life (THE CLOSER).  Plus or minus charm,  most male leads in dramas are stereotyped principled guys who  ultimately solve the problems associated with a mystery and often punctuate  their seriousness with a witty Real Guy joke.  In CASTLE the romance between the male and female protagonists has an unconsummated,  fine tension between equals and actually consistently is driven by examples of articulate repartee.

  Consistently well-written by folk who may have actually read a book or appreciated a play, the leading romantic duo are bolstered by a marvelous Diva mother/Grandmother who has a brain, lively/sexy life goals and understands her handsome and talented son.  Unique in the world is also the daughter of the male protagonist who is beautiful, wholesome, intelligent and well-mannered.  The strength of CASTLE has been from the inception the brilliantly written characters, but the mystery elements improve in each tale.

  This is a fun series and a great way for grown-ups to spend an evening with characters who actually have brains and use them.  The leads are the required beautiful persons, but both male and female leads are equally well-written and charismatic.  It is not high art,  but it is splendid entertainment for folks who also enjoy BONES, NCIS,  and NUMBERS.",1255651200,3,1705,5.256505576208179

3828842,3,B001XRLWPQ,"If you have watched Bones, NCIS, CSI or any other procedural crime show you will instantly recognize Castle's formula. Murder of the week, initial suspect(s) usually turns out to be red herring (or in a variation, guilt circles back to someone unsuspected at the beginning), some new and somehow previously overlooked piece of evidence or insight leads them to the guilty party just in time. This rigid formula is not really the fault of Castle per se, it's just a result of the type of show Castle is. Also like Bones, Castle does add an over-arching storyline every 3-5 episodes or so, the unsolved murder of Beckett's mother (so much like Bones in fact it's a direct copy.) This has yet to really develop Beckett however.

Of course all these type shows need a gimmick to break free of the same procedural formula. Bones did this by pairing an eccentric anthropologist with a tough but likeable FBI agent with some success until the writer's strike at least in my view. Castle tries to use the hook of pairing a hedonistic writer with a stiff NY police detective. Not exactly leaps and bounds of separation in the means used to escape the formula with the two shows. Also very similar is the romantic tension between the lead characters of the two shows.

Speaking of the leads, Fillion is brilliant as Castle. Imagine Mal from Firefly wasn't a futuristic space smuggler (without the associated emotional baggage), but a present day NYC author and father and you have Castle. Fillion plays the roguish type well, but he adds the aspect of being a caring father and son for this role, and does it all well. In short, he makes the show for me and is the reason I still watch it and hope for it to become more than it is. Castle and his family seem to me to be the only real characters on the show at this point, although his daughter is somewhat too mature and perfect sometimes. However one mildly annoying aspect to the family relationship is how in a few episodes crimes are solved by some unrelated interaction between Castle and his daughter wherein she might say something to the effect of ""my boyfriend would never do that"" and Castle makes some great intuitive leap from her comment to suddenly solve the case. But, that's the rigid murder of the week formula striking again.

Now, on the other side of Fillion's well defined and fully developed character is Det. Kate Beckett.  In stark contrast to Castle, her character is barely developed at all. The first time we even see her at home was in the second season! Did she live at the police station for season one? She has no personality to me and is not likeable in my view because she is so one dimensional. She has a bad attitude towards Castle for example, but for no real reason (that is ever explained beyond she is just itchy with a b). In one episode she says she ""hates cops who can't think outside their own stories"" meaning cops who don't go all the way to solve crimes or who won't use unconventional means to solve a crime. So why then is she so opposed to Castle being there? He often solves cases the police would not have. Some people decry comparisons to Bones, but the similarities are self evident. One major difference is that both Booth and Bones were developed characters and not hollow stereotypes. I know this type of show doesn't focus as much on character development (one reason I'm not a huge fan of the genre), but some would be nice.

As for the supporting players, Castle's mother is a more loveable and lucid Lucile Bluth from Arrested Development and you can follow the logical progression of Castle's childhood with her to his life now pretty well. His daughter Alexis is the only mature member of his family and is played well by Molly Quinn. Though she's a bit too goody-two-shoes to be realistic sometimes. Bursting into tears for jumping a subway turnstile for example, a bit overmuch in the nice department there. Most of the time though his family, including his vapid ex-wife, are well played and believable.

Pretty much all the cops are total stereotypes though. Ryan and Esposito are likeable enough but are reduced to bit players with not a lot to do but be ordered around by Beckett. The police captain, medical examiners, other cops, mayor, etc are generally window dressing. Which would be ok if Beckett had any level of development beyond hard-nosed feminist cop who orders men around and is surly.

In short, Castle makes the show for me and Beckett along with the genre ruin it(but mostly Beckett). And don't call me a chauvinist. My favorite show ever is Buffy the Vampire Slayer, so I have nothing against strong female leads. I just like to have fully developed ones.

In my review I took off one star because this a procedural crime show with a rigid formula built in by design and another star because Beckett is a total stereotype. If you really like crime procedurals and/or stereotypes, add 1-2 stars accordingly.",1255132800,38,4932,4.641466208476518
3828843,4,B001XRLWPQ,"I don't mind it if other shows try to emulate that sizzling chemistry put out by them folks at BONES. Frankly, there's a lot of television series out there who could do with that sort of zing. CASTLE has got a nice gimmick, but no surprise that its success rests hugely on how Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic mesh onscreen. Thankfully for CASTLE, the two leads create sparks together.

Best-selling mystery novelist and dashing man-about-town Richard Castle lives it up big. Got the fame and glamor, the wealth, and the beautiful broads. Castle gets involved with NYPD when a serial killer begins to lift murder scenes from his past novels. That case solved, Castle decides to stick around the precinct as a consultant, regarding this as an opportunity to harvest ideas for future bestsellers (he's kind of nursing this writer's block). This doesn't at all suit standoffish and driven NYPD Homicide Detective Kate Beckett, but she has no choice since Castle's got an in with the mayor. And, of course, Detective Beckett also being this beautiful babe doesn't have anything to do with Castle wanting to hang around. He sees her as a challenge. She calls him a ""nine-year-old on a sugar rush."" You get the picture.

Are Castle and Beckett the sexiest sleuths since Temperance Brennan and Special Agent Seeley Booth? I dunno, but they're certainly in the running. Nathan Fillion - who should be on TV or in films as much as possible (don't give me that crap about his needing a personal life) - has got his easy-going rakish charm going on, the perfect foil to Stana Katic's uptight, chip-on-the-shoulder brand of sexy. There's nothing like that sly sexual tension wafting in the air, even as we realize that if these two ever do get together, it won't be until a good long while, with ABC milking the thing for all the Nielsen ratings it can squeeze out. Meanwhile, we soak in all that suggestive banter and innuendo.

To be honest, the murder cases take a back seat. To me, they're only interesting in that they at times provide peeks into the makeup of the show's characters. Episode 6, for example, opens up Beckett's painful past as she makes a personal connection with the case at hand. We learn why she decided to become a police detective. But there's more to Kate Beckett than being prickly and a control freak. As she sasses to Castle: ""O so many layers to the Beckett onion - however will you peel them all?"" We learn more about her later on, especially when her old flame reappears and looks to be staying around for a while - because, as we know, there has to be that obligatory romantic third wheel.

I dig that, although Castle may be big noise elsewhere, he's treated like a rookie in the precinct. In the first couple of episodes, he's often directed to stay in the car while the real detectives went off to investigate. Of course, Castle doesn't listen and sometimes ends up bumbling things. But, gradually, he wins Beckett's squad over, because the guy does have this outside-the-box intuitiveness. His vivid writer's imagination does come in handy, not to mention all his big time connections and also that espresso machine he just bought the squad. I get a kick out of how Rick Castle so gets a kick out of shadowing Beckett and crew. ""Nine-year-old on a sugar rush"" seems right. However, another perfectly apt quote regarding Castle comes from Castle himself: ""Some people love the institution, hate the day-to-day.""

We'd think him a more frivolous guy than he really is, except early on we learn just how wonderful of a dad he is. His interactions with his teen daughter Alexis (Molly Quinn) continually provides some of the show's best ""aww"" moments. On the other hand, I can't stand Castle's over-the-top ex-stage actress mom.

Only ten episodes, and the last one ends on a sort of cliffhanger, and I suspected that Castle was due to get his you-know-what handed to him by Beckett. As it is, the first episode of Season 2 deals largely with Castle attempting to fix the damaged relationship between him and Beckett.

When we first meet Rick Castle, he'd just killed off his literary cash cow, Derek Storm. Beckett inspires him to create a new protagonist (and I laughed out loud at the premise - ""hooker by day, cop by night""), and part of the fun this season is in seeing Beckett so discomfited at being Castle's ""muse.""

CASTLE: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON collects all ten episodes on three discs. The DVD bonus stuff: ""Misdemeanors: Bloopers & Outtakes (2:36 minutes); ""Whodunit: The Genesis of CASTLE"" (6:13 minutes); ""Write-Along with Nathan Fillion"" - Nathan hangs out with author/executive producer Stephen J. Cannell (9:07 minutes); ""CASTLE's Godfather"" - goes into how Stephen J. Cannell took Executive Producer Rob Bowman and Creator/Executive Producer Andrew Marlowe under his wing and taught them the ropes of the television biz (7:15 minutes).

There are 4 audio commentaries on 3 episodes, with Nathan Fillion keeping things light: ""Flowers For Your Grave"" (Creator/Executive Producer Andrew Marlowe, Executive Producer Rob Bowman, Actors Nathan Fillion, Stana Katic, & Jon Huertas), ""A Chill Goes Through Her Veins"" (Andrew Marlowe, Rob Bowman, Nathan Fillion & Stana Katic, Jon Huertas & Molly Quinn), and ""A Death In The Family"" (two different commentaries for this episode, one with Andrew Marlowe, Rob Bowman, and Nathan Fillion, Stana Katic, Jon Huertas, & Molly Quinn; the other with actors Seamus Dever and Jon Huertas).

Another cool moment pops up in the first episode, when Castle's poker buddies of the evening turn out to be James Patterson and Stephen J. Cannell. If you read mystery thrillers, then you've probably read their stuff. In my eyes, Rick Castle just gained that much more cachet. I am so glad there's a Season 2. I'll say it again, there's no need for Nathan Fillion to have a personal life. Just keep doing television and film, dude. And maybe a sequel to DR.

In addition, they get New York RIGHT. So few shows do, like CSI:NY having a cabbie offer a woman a cigarette when New Yorkers know that it's been illegal to smoke in a cab for at least twenty years. They even know what a rent-controlled apartment is!

Marlowe talks about the challenge of introducing all the regular characters while also telling a mystery story. Marlowe and Bowman talk about casting Fillion and Katic. Meanwhile, Fillion cracks jokes and is his usual entertaining self.

The second disc includes a commentary on ""A Chill Goes Through Her Veins"" by Marlowe, Bowman, Fillion, Katic, Huertas and Molly Quinn. They talk about the challenge of filming on an actual construction site. Marlowe and Fillion talk about their approach to the character of Castle. Katic goes into detail about her character's backstory and how it informs what she does.

Disc three starts off with two commentaries on ""A Death in the Family."" The first one features Marlowe, Bowman, Fillion, Katic, Huertas, and Quinn. Everyone banters back and forth while sharing anecdotes about shooting this episode. Katic talks about the dramatic material in this episode and how it changes the relationship between Castle and Beckett.

There is also another commentary for this episode by Huertas and fellow cast member Seamus Dever. These guys crack jokes and praise the episode's guest stars. They also tell all sorts of filming anecdotes.

""Castle's Godfather"" is an interview between Marlowe, Bowman and T.V. producer/writer and legend Stephen J. Cannell. Bowman knew Cannell when he was a kid and got his start on T.V. working for him. The two men share entertaining anecdotes about some of the shows they've worked on together.

""Write-Along with Nathan Fillion"" is a hilarious mock-featurette as the actor spends the day with Cannell. The actor shows up to the man's house late and is forced to camp out until the next day. Fillion hangs on Cannell's every word but seems more impressed by the T.V. mogul's numerous classic cars. This is a fun extra as these two guys play well off each other.

""CASTLE"" debuted on ABC as a mid-season replacement and began airing on March 2009.  Created by Andrew M. Marlowe (""Air Force One"", ""End of Days"" and ""Hollyw Man"") and executive produced by Rob Bowman (""The A-Team"", ""The X-Files"", ""Day Break"") comes a new drama series on crime solving.

The first season which featured 10 episodes stars actor Nathan Fillion (""Firefly"", ""Drive"" and ""Desperate Housewives"") as Richard Castle.  The famous mystery novelist who is adored by many but behind-the-scenes, he is a playboy who has an on-and-off fling with his ex-wife (who is an actress), another ex-wife who is his publisher and lives with his bright teenage daughter Alexis (Molly Quinn, ""My One and Only"") and his meddlesome mother and former Broadway actress, Martha Rodgers (Susan Sullivan, ""The Nine"", ""Dharma & Greg"").

There is a lot of pressure on Nathan to create another book and with him stuck, his luck starts to change when he meets by-the-book Detective Kate Beckett (Stana Katic, ""Heroes"", ""The Spirit"", ""Quantum of Solace"") who is investigating several murders which have taken place and the way that they were done were like the murders featured in several of his novels.  Because of his knowledge of how things end up with his books, he gets the opportunity to assist the detectives in their case.

Eventually, Richard Castle discovers that he can do several things in his life.  Write his new book based on Detective Beckett, see if he can woo Detective Beckett and most of all to investigate other murders which he can incorporate ideas for his new book.  At first, it seems implausible but with Castle being so well-known and friends with the mayor, Captain Montgomery (Ruben Santiago-Huds0n) will do what he can to make the mayor and his boss happy, so he allows Richard to tag along with Detective Beckett.

Needless to say, she's not happy about it but with his skills of mystery writing and her skills as a detective, the two find out that together, they can be an effective duo in crime solving.  Also, joining Beckett are Detective Javier Esposito (Jon Huertas), Detective Kevin Ryan (Seamus Dever) and forensics doctor Dr. Lanie Parish (Tamala Jones).

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""CASTLE - The Complete First Season"" is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1) and is enhanced for 169 televisions.  The drama series is quite slick as it gives you the feel of New York and like many abc studios related DVD releases, Disney has always done a good job with their TV show transfers.  A show that balances outdoor and indoor shots with good lighting, the picture quality for ""CASTLE"" is pretty solid.  I didn't see any major artifacting issues or low level noise that was distracting.

As for the audio, the series is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  The series is front and center channel driven with a few episodes (that involve gun fights) utilizing the surround channels.  The series does utilize quite a bit of music and for the most, the series is understandable and clear.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""CASTLE"" was definitely a surprise.  I can remember seeing the commercials during ""LOST"" but and for the most part, it kind of reminded me of the old ""Moonlighting"" years of crime investigation.  But after watching the first episode, I was instantly hooked.

Both Rick Castle and Detective Kate Beckett are just polar opposites but you know that there is this sexual attraction there that makes their chemistry work onscreen.  In a way, both are like Bruce Wayne (Batman) in the way they are keen in investigating things.  Castle, as a mystery writer and having done a lot of research, puts himself in the shoes of the criminal and thinks of the many possibilities that can exist between the characters.  Detective Beckett, almost having a similar tragic Bruce Wayne story is a by-the-book detective and for the most part, have their unique way of feeding off each other in terms of handling a case.  But Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic do a great job and have good chemistry onscreen.

So, far every episode has been intriguing, suspenseful and entertaining.  If there was one thing that tends to creep in my head that is more on the negative side, is just the serious aspects of a popular writer getting the opportunity to tag along a detective on her various cases.  I just have a hard time seeing the NYPD allowing such a thing and allowing a writer to get that close to the detectives.

Granted, this may seem a bit farfetched but overall, the writers make it work.  Each of the characters are actually quite enjoyable to watch, especially Castle's meddling mother Martha and logical and intelligent daughter Alexis,  it's good to see Castle pulled out of his element once in awhile. Beckett's partners Detective Esposito and Ryan lend that serious but also comedic moment for the series.

The first season of ""CASTLE"" has been quite enjoyable thus far.  I'm glad to hear that the series has been green lighted for a second season because ""CASTLE"" has been nothing but entertaining, fun and a suspenseful drama series thus far.

""CASTLE - The Complete First Season"" is definitely worth checking out!",1253836800,18,8706,4.781061114842176
3828850,5,B001XRLWPQ,This show absolutely rocks. It currently tops my list of TV shows that I enjoy watching and I have a hard time waiting for the next episode. Nathan Fillion is one of my favorite actors so I fully admit that I'm biased.  He and Stana Katic (Kate Beckett) both give terrific performances in this serious comedy.,1253664000,,309,4.517857142857143
3828851,5,B001XRLWPQ,"You like action? Check. You like comedy? Check plus. You like Nathan Fillion? No duh!

Castle has everything, it's got the cool, interesting, sometimes twisty sometimes heartwearming mystery cases that the generation growing up with CSI and Law & Order has learned to love.

It is also the funniest thing I've seen since I don't know when. You'd think that murder can't be funny but you'd be wrong.

Nathan Fillion plays a mystery writer who has gotten so bored with his character Derrick Storm that he decides to kill him off, the problem is that he has no idea what to write next. Enter Detective Kate Beckitt (Stana Katic) she is investigating a copy cat serial killer of Castle's books, she calls him in for questioning and the greatest partnership since peanut butter and jelly is born.

Castle is charming, arrogant, annoying, frustrating and down right hiliarious. You've got to love the smart alec Han Solo types and Nathan Fillion delievers. You can't help but love him as he shoots out one liners that will have you laughing so hard I guarantee you'll pull something.

Beckett is the no nonsense, by the book, straight edge if sexy and beautiful detective in whom Castle finds the muse for his next novel, he also finds amusment in annoying the heck out of her. The sparks fly between the two, something that is fun to watch as they unfold. They really complement each other, she grounds the man-child and he adds a little more fun into her life.

A surprising delight is Castle's daughter Alexis who is not the typical drama teen TV likes to show, she is smart, mature a breath of fresh air. The actress who plays her is great, nobody will find her character annoying.

A cast of supporting character round out the show, Esposito and Ryan add some more comic buddy cop relief, the coroner has some great sarcastic wit, Martha,Castle's mother, is a scatterbrained drama junkie who is another part of the show that makes you smile. And finally the Chief is a fun, if by the book boss that I wouldn't mind working for. Since the show's renewel I look forward to these supporting characters being shown more, they have great potential.

This show is meant to be taken as a fun ride, a nice show that is more comedy than drama that will make you smile. A refreshing change from the drama heavy shows that are weghing on the TV right now. Take a gander, watch a few episodes and you'll be saying ""Bam Said the Lady!"" along with Nathan Fillion.",1253664000,3,2448,4.611494252873563
3828852,4,B001XRLWPQ,"Richard Castle (Nathan Fillion) is a best selling author who has just killed off his meal ticket.  While he struggles with writer's block creating a new lead, someone starts using his books as the basis of a series of grisly murders.  When he's called in to consult on the case, he meets NY homicide detective Kate Beckett (Stana Katic).  Beckett is less than impressed with the always joking Castle, but the two do make a decent team tracking down the killer.

Beckett also sparks Castle.  In an effort to see her more often, Castle bases his new character on her.  Now he's a regular consultant with the police department, riding along with Beckett and helping her solve crimes.  Will the pairing work out?

I must admit, this show snuck up on me, but I really enjoy it.  True, the mysteries are rather formulaic, drawing much from the writings of best selling authors.  I often have the solution figured out before Castle and Beckett, but there's often one twist that throws me along the way.

What makes the show so fun are the characters.  Castle and Beckett don't exactly have an adversarial relationship, but she doesn't like having him shadowing her everywhere, either.  They are constantly teasing each other with quips that make it lots of fun.  Yep, another chance to get some laughs along with your mystery.  Additionally, Castle's teenage daughter and mother are living with him.  They really add to the texture of the show.  I just love their scenes.

About the only thing that doesn't work is the romantic ""tension.""  I know from what I've read, this is supposed to be part romance as well.  I'm just not buying it.  I see their relationship, at least as we've seen it so far, as more brother and sister than boyfriend and girlfriend.  Honestly, the actors have great chemistry, so it is more likely how the characters are written.

Yes, the show has some flaws.  But the fun more than makes up for those weaknesses.  If you've missed it, get this set to get caught up quickly so you can join the fun with season two.",1253577600,,2032,4.640449438202247
3828853,5,B001XRLWPQ,"I agree with all of the reviews I have read, on this new, interesting, entertaining weekly show. I did not actually start watching it, until maybe the last 4 episodes. I found the show to be addictive after the first time I watched it, and have not missed an episode since then.

  I do not think it is ONE of the best on T.V., I think it IS the BEST. So, for the first time ever, I have actually ordered the DVD containing the entire first season as well as bonus material. I will be anxious to get it, so I can catch up on all the episodes I missed, before I realized such a good series was currently on T.V.

  As others have said, the cast was chosen very well, and each member is perfect for the part they play in the show. The chemistry between the main characters, and the way they proceed using different methods in solving cases is most entertaining. All of the supporting actors play their parts really well also. This is really fine entertainment at it's best.",1253491200,,971,4.278688524590164
3828854,5,B001XRLWPQ,"Fell in love with Nathan Fillion's character in FIREFLY, Captain Malcolm Reynolds, and I'll be darned if he hasn't done it again. He really is quite talented, regardless of who he is at the moment: the insanely evil minister on BUFFY, the reluctant hero on FIREFLY, or the wise-cracking & charming writer on CASTLE, Fillion manages not only to pull it off, he makes it look easy.

Joining police detective Kate Beckett played by Stana Katic solving murders, they make a totally implausible circumstance real and very entertaining. Cleverly written and impeccibly performed, the series has been wonderful so far. I'd been getting the episodes off iTunes but it has come to the point where I'm just giving up and buying the darn thing so my whole family can enjoy this wonderful television show.

Just a word to the wise: see it now before the television ""suits"" cancel it, like they cancelled the incredible FIREFLY, like the BBC cancelled PRIMEVAL, like all the really great shows have been cancelled in the past.",1253491200,,1013,4.883720930232558
3828855,5,B001XRLWPQ,"Short version: this is a great show - if you've never seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it! Long form: I've noticed that most of the ""glowing"" reviews for this ABC show have come from women - who are clearly quite infatuated with the male lead - but I'm sure there are lots of guys out there, who like me, also love the show...and who (also like me) haven't failed to notice the considerable charms of the female lead! (She had a brief part in the most recent James Bond film  - playing an agent who is being duped in the same way as Bond's girlfriend in the previous film.)  In any case, the two of them seem to have that genuine and increasingly rare screen chemistry that makes it fun watching their relationship grow; and Castle's daughter (an incredibly well-adjusted ""normal"" kid) and his mother, who live together with him, along with the two other homicide detectives, their captain, the female M.E., and assorted others, round out a great cast. Castle's fame and wealth have allowed him to be something of a lothario; however since meeting Beckett, apparently a reformed one - so now he's just your basic adult Peter Pan with a knack for knocking out hugely popular mystery novels, and yet still a caring, involved dad - who is able to afford great toys, by the way. Beckett is a slightly repressed (with good reason, we've learned) yet sexy and incredibly focused detective, and don't ask me how, but the two balance each other out perfectly. Anyway, rent or buy the first season if you missed it, and get ready for the upcoming (I hope) second season...when we left them last summer, Castle was just about to risk forever alienating Beckett, by telling her some critical information about her mother's death, a subject she'd warned him to avoid under threat of ending their budding friendship, but that he feels she has to hear to ever have closure...so stay tuned!",1250812800,,1881,4.62874251497006
3828856,5,B001XRLWPQ,"Nathan Fillion is of, course, the main star attraction in Castle, and everything that has been said about him in the above reviews is absolutely spot on:  he is wonderful in this roll he was born to play. But don't overlook Stana Katic.  She is phenomenal. Her intensity is pitch perfect as a foil to Castle's bonhomie.  He sparkles and she reacts, with humor or aggravation.  She is intensely private;  he is extremely open.  His family is funny, loving, and endearing;  she really has no one, except a distant, grieving father.  She is all business, and he is ostensibly all pleasure.  But, of course, he has depth.  It is wonderful to see him get under her skin and help her to feel, and relax, while revealing his often hidden strength of character.

The camera loves Stana.  She has an intensely, beautiful face and fine bone structure. The close ups of her interrogating a suspect or consoling a victim are like nothing else in the usual round up of television's female detectives. She grieves for the victim and slices the suspect with her clarity.  Her eyes are luminous and reveal intelligence, and compassion, as well as grit and determination. Nathan's eyes are all twinkle, but awareness of the depth and sometimes despair in his ""partner's"" eyes is not far from the surface.

She is toughness and dedication to duty personified;  he is not afraid to appear silly and shallow, traits he has perfected, with not too much depth ever expected of the playboy author.

The two of them are magnificent foils to each other; the stuff of good drama and comedy. The show embodies a good mystery, often paralleling the events in Castle's and Beckett's lives, and with sharp writing, excellent secondary characters are drawn to the delight of the audience, but make no mistake, the show is about Castle and Beckett, and they simply light up the screen. Because of their partnership, both characters grow and share their individual lives, feelings and true personalities. Need I say I love this show. It is a joy to see them shine, Nathan and Stana, Castle and Beckett and demonstrate through this high quality show that neither one is  ""just another pretty face.""

.....continued.....September 10, 2011...Today, looking back over three seasons of Castle, I cannot help but think about the beginning, the themes and threads developed through excellent writing and stellar acting, and realize that Castle is still my favorite show but with one difference.  Now it is epic.

""Who are you?""  With these three words, Kate Beckett, the ""hauntingly"" beautiful detective, seizes the Castle stage, and with scorching intensity, surveys the crime scene and never gives in; she is ""extraordinary.""  We are fascinated by her tenacity, her integrity, and her beauty, from our first encounter with her, and so, too, is Rick Castle, best-selling author, young father, and playboy, man-about -town.  Indeed, the two unlikely ""partners,"" Richard Castle and Kate Beckett, spend their time together attempting to answer these existential questions about themselves and each other, as their true personalities grow and meet, sometimes, somewhere between real and magic.

Sated with fluff and fake, Rick is bored with his pampered, predictable life, empty of ""surprise.""  He remarks to his daughter, ""I would like someone to come up sometime and say something new.""  Then Kate, real and dedicated, walks into his life, and everything changes for him, so much more demanded and expected. In fact, they have turned each other's world upside down.

Without a doubt, Castle is about so much more than just another pretty face. The writing, and acting are superb, ""on so many levels,"" to borrow a Rick-ism, although he is usually referring to something provocative, as in ""disturbing on so many levels.""  Revisiting the show's first season and seasons two and three, is illuminating, providing  an opportunity to trace two themes or threads and the incredible writing and stellar acting, embodied in a mere television show.  The journey to self-knowledge, trust and love propels the story, involving all of the characters, Rick's mother Martha and his daughter Alexis, as well as detectives Ryan and Esposito.  But lighting up the screen, is the dynamic between two ostensibly different, sometimes-confused, would-be lovers, Rick and Kate, as they struggle to define themselves and each other.

Often with preconceived notions, both Rick and Kate seem to think they know the answers or can solve the riddle of their ""partner.""  Kate teases on one occasion, ""So many layers to the Beckett onion; however will you peel them off?"" The fun, frustration and passion lie in the unraveling.  Frequently Kate says, ""You don't know who I am,"" words echoing though out the entire three seasons of Castle.

From the beginning Kate shuts Rick down when she feels that he is getting too close to the real Kate: ""Don't think you know me,"" she defends. And in one of the final scenes between them in the season three finale, Kate still cries out:  ""You think you know me, but you don't.""  In an earlier episode, Rick pointedly says, that he understands Nikki Heat a lot better than she thinks. Then, too, late in season three, in ""To Live and Love in LA,"" Rick confesses to Kate:  ""You know what I thought when I first met you.  You were a mystery I would never solve...I am amazed at the depths of your strength and your heart.""  Slowly the layers begin to peel back and unravel.

Also, Rick wants to know the story behind Kate's career choice.  He theorizes in the first episode: ""Something happened. You are wounded....not that wounded...you lost someone you loved.""  Then Kate's achingly, lovely, face changes from mildly amused with this playboy, to seared and stripped, exposed. Reading her face, her pain, Rick retreats, revealing one of his finer qualities:  kindness.

Shoring up his playboy image, however, Rick asks Kate to join him for a ""debriefing"" dinner date at the end of their first case together, but Kate is sure she knows Rick's type, or so she judges:  ""What,  and become one of your conquests,"" she responds.

Then Rick makes a singular reply for one so sure of himself:  ""Or I could become one of yours.""  This man is not all that he pretends to be.  True, Rick is not yet the steadfast man he gradually becomes. In the beginning Kate considers his actions similar to ""a nine year old on a sugar rush,"" and she feels forced to endure him. Consequently, she treats him like a child, poking him or grabbing his nose or ears to admonish his demanding, spoiled behavior.  Although childish and pampered, he is generous; and honor defines him.  A nurturing father, Rick is present for Alexis, for fun, in crisis and for decisions, and Kate begins to see the loving father in his soul-searching and in their discussions on raising a teenager. This is a rare man she discovers.

In their dance of discovery, Rick, like Kate, reveals a compassionate and sincere nature, and this revelation disrupts Kate's preconceptions or fears of Rick. Rick often makes witty, self- effacing remarks, charmingly side-swiping a conversation, reluctant to expose his serious side. He is invested in maintaining his shallow, bad boy image, and he, too, is hiding.  He may think he is peeling Kate layer by layer, but he, too, is exposed. When Rick tells Kate he was a lonely kid, Kate kindly comments: ""You had a lot of imaginary friends.""  Rick quips,"" I still do.""

Slowly, the seemingly shallow man realizes the harsh truths of Kate's cop world. Real heart break and death are not as easy to handle as they are in his novels, and the cop's burden is a harsh reality.  What will you tell Alexis, Kate frequently challenges Rick.  His clear response is always:  ""the truth."" Indeed, truth is the essence of this man, this story teller.

Another theme originates in the opening scenes of this drama, and threads across three years until the season three finale.  Kate asks Rick:  ""Why are you here?"" He considers the story his first reason for shadowing the detective.  Inspiration and research for his next novel are also safe answers.  Gradually, however, the charming novelist realizes what everyone suspects; he is there for her.  Rick admits this to his mother when she asks him why he is risking his life, for he cannot rewrite the endings and charm his way out of a bullet. With love for Kate etched on his face, he admits to his mother that, ""it's not about the books anymore.""

In season one we see his growing love and awareness of Kate and his need to be near her, and we see him change to become a better man, for her and his daughter.  In season three Captain Montgomery advises his four, young protgs regarding marriage.  So much of a successful, caring relationship, he explains, is realized by ""just showing up."" It was as if he were speaking to Rick alone because no matter the obstacles, Rick will not leave Kate's side; she cannot ""get rid of him.""

In another moment of self-discovery, Rick confides to his mother:  ""I don't want ordinary.  I want..."" His mother fills in the word...magic.  Kate recognizes his magical qualities, pointing out Rick's innocence, noting his love of zoos and museums.  She won't admit it always, but she enjoys his amusing stories and his witty repartee.  Rick loves life and enjoys fantasy.  With a child-like joy in life, he plays laser tag and fences with his daughter, rocks out with his guitar, carves pumpkins, throws costume parties, flies black-hawk, model helicopters, or dons the trappings of the mad scientist.  He sees the magic in life, in family, in fate, in the universe, in love, in the heart, in Santa and in hope.  And he wants to share the magic, especially with Kate.

Rick's beliefs and their differences are never more poignant then in this exchange between them when they part company for the day.

""Until tomorrow,"" Rick remarks.

""You can't just say good night?"" Kate retorts.

""I am a writer; until tomorrow is more hopeful.""

 ""I'm a cop.  Goodnight.""

However, when allowing Rick back, in seasons two and three, Kate does say to him:  ""I'll see you tomorrow.""

Over time, Kate awakens to the fun in Rick's company with him ""pulling her pigtails,"" and begins to relax and enjoy herself a bit more. In a final scene, Captain Montgomery sums up the impact Rick has had on Kate. He sees how good Rick is for her, and he tells her that she wasn't having any fun until Rick came into her life.

Well-grounded, nevertheless, Kate believes in real and always.  She isn't sure that Rick fully understands these concepts, given his track record of two failed marriages and many empty conquests.  ""When it comes to marriage, I am a one and done kind of girl,"" Kate reveals. But along the way, Rick learns the word always.  ""Always"" becomes a code word for their unspoken love and commitment to each other, and they use this word guardedly and tenderly.

Gradually, throughout the first season, Kate begins to trust Rick with cases and thus with her life.  His magic works in season one, until Rick tries too hard to fix Kate and bring her some closure in her mother's murder.  With his anguish visible and knowing he will cause her pain, Rick tells Kate the truth about his discoveries regarding her mother's murder, clearly knowing that she will withdraw completely from him. Feeling betrayed and unwilling to go down the same path that nearly destroyed her before, and even with Rick by her side, Kate wants Rick gone and no longer shadowing her. His worst fear is realized, and he must leave her. The end of each season brings something to separate them, a betrayal, another man or woman, and finally... a bullet.

And so it goes, sometimes... star-crossed love.

Their love story begins with two questions:  Who are you? Why are you here?  For three years, Kate and Rick struggle with shyness, hesitation and rejection, unable to find love and fulfillment with each other. Sometimes they come so achingly close to a declaration of need and love, but they are so star-crossed that it hurts the heart to witness their pain and poor timing.

Finally, it is the symmetry of those first words, colliding with their resounding echoes and responses in the final scene, crushing and uplifting us simultaneously, gripping us with heart-stopping intimacy.  ""Who are you?""  ""Why are you here?""  a lover's quest.  At last, Rick and Kate solve the existential mystery, each in his own way.  Kate's response is her last loving look at Rick before she is shot and before their world falls apart, and her trusting gaze at him while in his arms, fallen and bleeding. For Rick, the writer, the answers to the mystery are etched in his last words:

""I love you...Kate.""",1248739200,69,12680,4.835266821345708
3828857,5,B001XRLWPQ,"At first glance ABC's new ""Castle"" may seem like your typical, run of the mill drama/comedy. But it absolutely isn't. Nathan Fillion takes the charm and comedic aspects to the next level with quirky and exciting author Rick Castle. And he knows just how to get under Detective Kate Beckett(Stana Katic)'s skin. Kate Beckett is smart and a straight shooter, always looking for the hard facts. Castle's creative mind creates out-of-the-box solutions. Together they make an extraordinary team and solve crimes with an amazing partnership.
The comedy and sarcasm keep the drama and murder-mystery of the show from getting too serious which is always note worthy and keeps you wanting more instead of turning of the television upset over some horrifying crime. All the other actors and actresses give brilliant performances and the family interactions are an extreme plus. Definitely recommended for any one with a smart sense of humour and hunger for solving mystery.",1245542400,7,963,5.219354838709678

3828860,4,B001XRLWPQ,"CASTLE is one hell of an entertaining piece of light, fluffy cop television. It's the perfect antidote to those who are wallowing in the dark sewers of cop shows like LAW AND ORDER SVU or CRIMINAL INTENT or the brilliant but extreme THE SHIELD. Creator Andrew Marlowe, perhaps best known as the screenwriter for AIR FORCE ONE, has created a very breezy and incredibly fun cop show that's primary purpose is to counter the altogether too intense police procedurals that the public seems to inhale like cigarette smoke (you know it's not good for you, but you can't help it). He's also added the perfect actor for a show like this: Nathan Fillion. Many people weren't familiar with Fillion's work until he became a cast member of the horrifically awful DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, but before that, he was a key player in what's known as The Whedonverse, starring in the all-too shortlived FIREFLY and also guest-starring in the final season of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. He was also featured in one of Whedon's more recent and brilliant creations, DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG, where he wonderfully plays a shallow, over-confident superhero. He also appeared in another VERY shortlived Fox television show called DRIVE, which was cut down before it could reach its potential. He's been featured in films like the FIREFLY sorta-sequel SERENITY, a wonderful indie splattergore comedy called SLITHER, and some unfortunate direct-to-DVD fare like WATER'S EDGE and WHITE NOISE 2: THE LIGHT. But as he proved with FIREFLY, he has more than enough talent and charisma to carry a show on his own if necessary (even though it wasn't necessary with how great FIREFLY was).

And that's very much the case with CASTLE. As mystery writer Richard Castle, this is his show. Despite some strong supporting performances by actors like Susan Sullivan, who plays his flamboyant, vibrant, and at times, annoying mother, and a sometimes over-her-head Stana Katic as his professional and personal foil, NYPD Detective Kate Beckett, this show and everything great about it is planted rightly and firmly on the charm and talent of Fillion.

The show is very much in the vein of a program like MOONLIGHTING, pitting the goofy yet irrestistably charming lothario against the by-the-book, stalwart, intelligent and sassy and undeniably sexy-but-sexless woman as the two of them get into one wild adventure after another. The thing about this show that gives it perhaps an even stronger catch than a show of this type should is that it has a specific ""mythology"" arc that will carry it for at least another season; namely the unsolved murder of Beckett's mother, and Castle's determination to solve it, even if it means that he will lose a friend and potential love interest in Beckett.

So I say bring on Season Two, and continue the tone that the show has given us, and don't let it conform to what the ""hitmakers"" see trending with the too-upsetting cop shows. Keep it easy breezy. And hopefully the show will get the audience it deserves, and Fillion will get more of the opportunities he deserves.",1243123200,136,3067,4.974658869395712

3828869,5,B001XRLWPQ,"Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic make this show what it is. It may appear, on the surface, to be a procedural, cop drama but when you dig a bit deeper there is constant tension in each episode and a twist that you won't see coming until at least 3/4 into the show. What other show could boast surprising their viewer week after week with a truly original story and a twist ending that makes you question everything you just witnessed. It's a beautiful combination of storytelling and great acting.

The writing in Castle is top notch. Each story, no matter how similar, always ends up going into a completely different place. Each case brings out something new within each of the characters. Castle has a good life but he seems to be missing something. Beckett is damaged inside but can't show it because she needs to remain as the strong female figure. Only in a recent episode have we found out that she does have a vulnerable aspect to her. It makes for an amazing relationship between the two characters.

If you are tired of shows like CSI, Cold Case or Law & Order but are still interesting in watching a show with interesting crimes and even more interesting solutions then Castle is for you. If you enjoy your drama with a large slice of realistic and comedic banter, then Castle is for you. If you want smart television with good writing that doesn't have the word ""Reality"" in it, then Castle is the show for you. I highly recommend it. 5 out of 5 stars and as much hyperbole as I can muster.",1241568000,5,1500,4.470802919708029

3828875,5,B001XRLWPQ,"Castle is one of the best shows on TV in a long time.  It fills the void of crime drama/comedy that hasn't been seen in years.  In these days of quirky off the wall shows, Castle offers the perfect blend of suspense, crime solvings and comedy.  Plus, the romantic chemistry/sexual tension between Castle and Det. Kate Beckett is palatable.  The show tends to remind one of ""Moonlighting"" but with more substance, not to mention that Nathan Fillion puts Bruce Willis to shame. The secondary characters are more than just ""fillers"".  Susan Sullivan as Castle's mother is a hoot, but also provides insight to why Castle is the way he is.  Castle's relationship with is daughter also give the character another diminsion so that we soon learn he is more than the skirt chasing author as portrayed in the TV trailers.  The detectives and police chief with whom Beckett works are more than background characters and their interactions with Beckett, Castle and each other are priceless.  By including cameos by real life authors such as James Patterson and Stephen J. Cannell, the writers lend to the credibility that Castle is indeed an author and not just a TV show.  If ABC fails to renew this show for a second season it will be a true loss.",1241481600,3,1238,4.72093023255814
3828876,5,B001XRLWPQ,"I never watch television. I'm something of a TV snob and the only show I ever watched ""religiously"" was ""The West Wing"" because I found it intellectually stimulating. When my mother raved about ""Castle"" I didn't take it too seriously because she is of the ""American Idol"" school of thought and watches whatever is on. Imagine my surprise when I found this show to be a deliciously witty, clever hour of television. The dialogue crackles and Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic have incredible chemistry. There's no hint of two-dimensional personalities on this show, and the one liners leave me laughing for days afterwards. ""Castle"" has wide appeal, and it's an all-around good show. There is no gratuitous violence, the writing is intelligent and sharp, and the actors are phenomenal. I'll be recommending this show to my TV snob and non-TV snob friends because in either case, ""Castle"" is a fun show for whomever watches it.",1241395200,97,922,4.95483870967742

It is by far the best show on TV. Nathan Fillion is just the cat's meow. I didn't honestly know Stana Katic but she made me  a believer.

Too many Law and Order episodes in a day (marathons on USA or TNT) are difficult to watch due to the focus on the graphic nature of the victims, but the story lines in Castle are real enough, but not difficult to watch.
Great chemistry between the main characters makes this show fun to watch.",1241395200,2,468,4.441860465116279

I would like to add that Nathan Fillion also portrayed Joey Buchanan on abc's One Life to Live several years ago and, occasional, reprisals. That being said, you saw the serious, dramatic acting; in Castle, you see his comedic wit and catch yourself yearning for the next bit of humor amid the mystery of the crimes. Nathan and Stana Katic have super chemistry so his comedic timing works very well with her serious-detective mode.",1241308800,3,536,4.712765957446808

The chemistry between Castle and Beckett, played by Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic, is impeccable and takes the show to another level.  The supporting characters were cast perfectly, provide humor, as well as more story dimensions to build on.  Every episode leaves the viewers wanting more and hoping for a renewal next season.  Check this show out Mondays at 10pm and you won't be disappointed.  Watch the previous episodes on ABC.com and definitely pre-order Season 1 on DVD!",1241308800,2,713,5.042735042735043
3828882,5,B001XRLWPQ,"Watching Castle reminds me of watching Moonlighting - only it's a lot better. When I first heard Nathan Fillion was going to be in a weekly drama my first thought was...please don't cancel it or put it in in the middle of the night. Thankfully neither happened! YAY! When I actually read the synopsis for the TV show I was thrilled to see that he was a writer. Be still my heart!

This show is wonderful. It's not gritty crime drama like the Law and Order shows, but the writing is great, the acting is wonderful, and the chemistry between Nathan and Stana Katic is amazing. I love how they pick at one another and how Kate is amazed that Castle can actually piece things together and get them right.

The other aspect of the show that I really enjoy is the family dynamic. You've got single parent Richard Castle, his live in mother Martha (played by Susan Sullivan) and his daughter Alexis (Molly Quinn); Mom is quirky and likes to drink, and Alexis shows her rebellion by actually being a good kid. (Seriously, in the pilot she was doing homework at a party...and she goes to bed early on a school night!) Myself, I love watching Richard interact with his family. The bond between father and daughter is very obvious, and in a way Alexis reminds me of Nancy Drew - she's not out solving mysteries, but the back and forth she does with Castle at times sure makes it seem that she may grow up to be a detective some day.

All in all I really love this show. It's well acted, well written and it's one of those shows that I miss once the episode is over.",1241308800,3,1554,4.3517241379310345

I already watch DWTS and Criminal Minds. And I don't like watching after 9PM. But, my hubby downloaded the first three episodes and now my mom and I are hooked.

It's smart, funny, well written and just plain entertaining. In a remarkable twist, the didn't save all the funny stuff just for the commercials.  We laughed out loud. We were surprised. The bad guys didn't have big red ""v"" for villain on their foreheads. The female detective is intelligent and capable. The author is egotistical, rich, but also insightful,intelligent and...a loving father. Woh. The supporting characters are strong (his daughter and mother are great assets). It has everything going for it. I have season one on my wishlist.

So naturally, now that we are hooked, they will probably cancel it. I hate TVv.

UPDATE:  Woohoo!  They have renewed the show, so the little cliffhanger from the last episode may now be explored.  Well worth watching and highly recommended!  And though I'm pathetic and old beyond my years - I will stay up until 11 to see new episodes.",1241136000,4,1194,4.790243902439024
3828892,5,B001XRLWPQ,"I had my doubts when I sat down for the first show. I love Nathan Fillion from his work in Firefly, Serenity, Dr. Horrible, and Outing Riley. But he's had trouble finding his niche on television. This may be it. No one can beat Fillion for comedic timing. His flexibility as an actor really gets a workout in Castle.

The biggest surprise in Castle is the excellent interaction between Molly Quinn and Fillion. What a pleasant change. A bright, intelligent relationship with positive outcomes. If you're looking for some father-daughter dialogue, you'll find it in Castle. The relationship between Castle and detective Beckett is slowing developing some depth. I want to see what happens with these people. I want to learn more about the rest of the detectives and with Castle's mother, played by Susan Sullivan. (I'm not too hot on her portrayal as a heavy drinker -- that's not funny at all.)

8347689,5,B001XRLWPQ,"I often tell my wife this is the best police procedural drama ever on TV, and she thinks that opinion is absolutely bizarre. Let me tell you why it's so good:

1. The storyline continually evolves into personal relationships apart and within the police procedural element. Nothing new there, but the writers rarely go for the easy resolution or interaction that the audience wants. I'm not talking about just milking the typical unrequited-love trope (though it's here as well), but all the human relationships that are created. They are nuanced and strong, and each one matters in its own way without suddenly taking over the whole series.

2. The acting is superb, from the recurring characters to the one-hitters.

3. Oddly enough, this series lasts eight season without ever truly jumping the shark. Usually when certain love relationships are resolved or a specific big evil enemy is vanquished, a series completely craters. The writers never gave up on this show, all the way to the end, and it shows.

4. It's funny. And there are plenty of tricky adult (naughty) metaphors tucked within normally dry procedural dialogue.

5. It never strays too far from its main purpose. All the wonderful branching-off aside, the police procedural element is still always there.

6. People they add on later in the series are fun, smart, quirky, and either truly likable or unlikable in quite complicated ways. With great acting again.

7. I've found that some series with throw in some odd things that happen in order to tie in a specific story element, then fail to explain how something preposterous could make sense. CASTLE uses this approach dozens of times, but when a crime scene investigator somehow doesn't use a glove on the scene, for instance, we later find out why. In one episode, it's necessary for Castle to care for a child in the custody of child welfare services, which seems unlikely until we realize that it's Thanksgiving (or Christmas) and that Beckett is a cop so she technically can be a temporary guardian of the child. All this is done without a big glaring sign to tell us so. It's just slipped in quietly.

All in all, an absolutely tremendous series and one of my all-time favorites in any genre.",1527638400,,2219,4.836411609498681
