4370527,5,B004FN26JQ,"I teach high school biology, and used this film to highlight my unit on genetics.  The students were fascinated!  It lead to a lot of higher-order questions from the kids.
It's a perfect vehicle to connect genetics to protein synthesis and DNA.  The artificial selection of traits represented in the video also leads well into evolution and natural selection.
If you're a science geek or just love dogs, this is an amazing biography of our last 15k years with 'Canus familiarus'.",1363392000,2,479,4.888888888888889
4370528,5,B004FN26JQ,"It's a doggy speak movie.  Very entertaining and informative to watch.  Indiana Bones, the family Malamute/Husky/Other Mix found it to be a howler.",1355270400,,147,5.3478260869565215
4370529,4,B004FN26JQ,"The dog is nothing but a human creation. Can it kill? Yes. Can it be wonderful with families? Yes. If you feel iffy about watching a dog attack another animal (on purpose), this is not for you. But, learning about the biology of Canines is very insightful.",1347840000,3,256,4.468085106382978
4370530,5,B004FN26JQ,"If you would like to understand your dog in a deeper more meaningful way, this documentary will show you how amazing our relationship with dogs is.
If you are thinking of getting a dog, this film will help you undertand many behavioural aspects of our incredible best friends.
By becoming a more insightful dog owner, this film has helped me understand many previously unknown aspects of this fascinating animal.",1321228800,,412,4.9855072463768115
4370531,3,B004FN26JQ,"I have to agree with the other review concerning the amount of unnecessary violoence portrayed in this special.  On the other hand, the content relating to breeding and the issues resulting from it is very well stated and useful for my biology class.
It is very dificult to find more interesting videos that contain a specific content for use in my biology class.  I often have to show something that only ""generally"" covers a topic.  This video fits my needs for the ""biotechnology"" unit well.
However, I am still not comfortable about the amount of violoence.  Sadly, my students were not in the least bothered with it.  Does that make me too sensitive?  Does it point to their lack of sensitivity?  I don't know.
4 stars for content, 2 stars for taste.",1315353600,10,755,4.674242424242424
4370532,1,B004FN26JQ,"I keep finding myself in a love/hate relationship with the National Geographic Society. Their photography can be breathtaking, but their choice of photo subjects can be stomach turning.  The opening sequence of this documentary is about the Dogo Argentino which was being used for hunting wild boar. And by ""hunting"" I mean running down and ripping into any part of the boar they can get their huge teeth into.  The dogs are given Kevlar vests to protect their vitals, so I'll leave it to you if it is a ""fair fight"".

Now, I'm no ""rainbow and unicorn"" girl living in Barbie's Fairytopia, but I don't want to watch dogs rip apart another living creature. I kept fast forwarding through this section, but even then got to see several Dogo's with blood dripping off their noses and bloody saliva dripping from their jaws after a successful hunt.

Then there was a fun little sequence showing Pit Bulls savaging each other.  Another visual I could have lived without.

I gave up on this very soon after, afraid they were going to get more and more graphic as the film continued.

My suggestion is to give this a miss and watch the Nova documentary ""Dogs Decoded"".  It is actually about how dogs were domesticated, why there are so many different breeds and the special bond dogs share with humans.  All of that and not a bit of bloodshed or torn flesh!",1314921600,22,1349,4.6344537815126055

8428000,1,B004FN26JQ,"I saw this on netflix and I am so disgusted.
I spend my time volunteering at a local humane society, havetwo rescued cats, and volunteer with a naturalist club. Ilove nature and I respect it.
This documentary seemed focused on negativity. If you love to watch innocent wild animals attacked by a pack of dogs, tied to a vehicle-still alive and bleeding- and hauled off to its death- This is surely the movie for you! If you just want to be amazed by the companionship and love of a dog----NOT the show for you!
I don't believe in hunting, and I don't believe in making dogs hunt either. There are better ways to solve the worlds problems than with violence or  putting our canines at risk.",1379808000,2,689,4.468253968253968
8428001,1,B004FN26JQ,"I stopped watching at this assertion: ""Pit bulls, while often gentle with people, savagely attack other dogs.""

There is absolutely no scientific basis for this statement. When I first became a pit owner, I had no idea of the level of prejudice against this breed. I did a lot of research and reading. There is no evidence to back up this claim. If anything, the hysteria that statements like this create become a self-fullfilling prophecy.

""The Science of Dogs"" is anything but and should be pulled from distribution by National Geographic.

Don't waste your time on this DVD. Instead, read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lost-Dogs-Michael-Vick-s-Dogs-and-Their-Tale-of-Rescue-and-Redemption/dp/B007PLZZ52/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lost Dogs: Michael Vick's Dogs and Their Tale of Rescue and Redemption</a>&nbsp;It's humans who are the savages when it comes to pit bulls.",1379635200,,926,6.333333333333333
