8255778,5,B0014IC334,"great product, good fights. Kind of disappointing in some aspects, but I think that just adds to it as an event as a whole that should be watched so you know what the hell happened. lol",1380067200,,185,4.166666666666667
8255779,5,B0014IC334,This was the very first Elitexc show and it made a huge impact in the world of MMA In the Main event it featured The rivaly between shamrock vs gracie but it ends because of a very serious injury it was very dissapointing the way it ended and the rest of the card was great too hope you enjoy it like i did too.,1340582400,3,311,3.875
8255780,5,B0014IC334,"it's pretty good. of course, i only bought it because Gina Carano was on it. they oughta make more videos of her. she's one hot lady. the other matches are good, too. it's worth the price they're asking for it. 2 dvd's of mixed martial arts.",1215388800,4,241,4.260869565217392
8255781,5,B0014IC334,"This release of EliteXC dvd contains everything that the UFC DVD releases don't, pre fight interviews, post fight interviews, replays of the fights, and tons of other stuff. This is a 2 disc set and contains all 10 bouts from EliteXC's first showtime event. Featuring a main event of Gracie vs Shamrock and first televised womens MMA match Carano vs Kedzie which was a really great fight, this was a breathrough event for EliteXC and was just an awesome opportunity and the fighters took that into consideration and put on the best fights they could. All 10 fights were great and worth watching again and again.

Preliminary Bouts (67 minutes)
Seth Kleinbeck vs. Riki Fukuda
Bo Cantrell vs. Tim Persey
Adriano Periera vs. Javier ""Showtime"" Vazquez
Mike Pyle vs. Ross Ebanez
Edson Berto vs. John Shackelford

Main Card (108 minutes)
Frank Shamrock vs. Renzo Gracie
Classic match up of styles and legendary families collide in this 3 round bout. Shamrock is the prototype of MMA and Renzo Gracie is just the submission master obviously with the Gracie name. This fight was really good up until the unexpected ending which was kind of disappointing but stuff like that just happens.

Antonio Silva vs. Welsey Correira ""Cabbage""
Cabbage Correira is one of those guys that everyone is debating whether or not he should retire from the MMA game. I love watching the guy fight and he's just a really nice guy outside the ring as well as Big Foot Silva. Will Silva continue his 7th fight first round knockout streak or Cabbage prove everyone wrong in this superheavyweight fight? Very exciting fight till the end and it doesnt make it past the first round.

Joey Villasenor vs. David Loiseau
Smokin Joe Villasenor does not get the credit he deserves. The guy is a beast and shows it in this fight against a very disappointing showing by David The Crow Louseau. Ever since his loss to Rich Franklin, Loiseau hasn't been the same. All his fights since then he just seems to be lazy and not even trying to win the fights. Joey Villasenor maneuvers around him like cake and even drops him and slams him a couple times during the fight. Overall this fight could have been way better but Joey showed skills from every part of the MMA game and that is something to be appreciated.

Charles Bennett vs. KJ Noons
Wow, this fight I couldn't wait to see. Charles Krazy Horse Bennett is one of the most entertaining fighters in the MMA game today. He is a showman before, during and after the fights and the fans love him for it. KJ Noons is the current lightweight champ of EliteXC and is defending his title against Yves Edwards in June. Before this fight KJ did a ton of trash talking saying things to Bennett like ""after I walk through you/knock your punk*** out"", Bennett kept his wits about him and went into this fight prepared and confident. This fight doesnt make it past the first round and ends by a awesome knockout punch.

Gina Carano vs. Julie Kedzie
This was definately the fight of the night. Two athletes go head to head in a 3 round fight and hey, they are women! Who wouldnt want to see that? This fight was way better then I expected it to be and sometimes looked as if they were tougher then some of the guys who got knocked out previously to this fight. Tons of action in this fight and it was great to see so much respect between the two after the fight ended.",1210809600,15,3363,4.578073089700997
