8562866,5,B00B5EBIR4,"I'm still waiting for this Christmas special to be released on its own in the U.S.  I missed it in broadcast but just last night watched from disc one of season two of this remarkable and enormously watchable series.  I found it heartbreakingly beautiful!  Love the series and anxiously look forward to season three in 2014.  And I just read that there will be another Christmas special in December of this year, 2013.  The series is made by, not just great stories, a remarkable group of women who pull you into the area in which they practice their midwifery, providing the care and seeing to the needs of so many who live in poverty and ignorance but who are also entitled to some dignity of life.  Narrated by Vanessa Redgrave, each episode finds these remarkable women responding to the needs of so many; and, as the story moves forward in time, we're introduced to the advances in medicine that now are taken for granted, in particular birth control and the testing for and treatment of tuberculosis.  If you haven't been watching, by all means do so.  It's not always easy being at the side of a woman dealing with a difficult birth, but what does make it just somewhat easier are the amazing ladies who take it in stride as they see to their duty to a population sorely in need of their love, care and training.",1374710400,,1319,4.5358649789029535
8562867,1,B00B5EBIR4,"I purchased this DVD for my mother as a gift for her 84th birthday.  At the time that I purchased it, I was not aware that it could not be played in the United States.  My mother lives 80 miles away from me.  I gave it to her last weekend, and she decided to watch it today.  She called me up and told me that it would not play.  I am totally dissatisfied, and I would like to return this item, if possible.  I would purchase another one if it could be played in this country.  Please let me know how to return it for a refund.  I will need to get the DVD from her in order to return it.  I have always been happy with my Amazon purchases in the past, but I am not happy now!!  Please advise.",1369440000,,692,3.8439716312056738
