8335231,4,B001Q94U3C,"This movie is pretty much what it says, explicit transfers of ""Archival Print"" with an Asian woman in each scene. Shooting quality isn't too bad, though focus is obviously manually adjusted here and there. The film obviously degraded prior to being scanned, so there is some screen static throughout, and no original sound. The scenes are certainly contrived, but many of the women are attractive, and I enjoyed it. This is a DVD for people who enjoy some older erotica, without implants or extreme overacting. It's certainly not an exploration of the ancient cultures of Asia, or even really a wide variety of Asian women.

This disc has six scenes (with a total run-time of around 53 minutes); one scene where a blond guy visits an Asian ""massage"" parlor, three threesomes, the MMMF scene, and one scene with an Asian woman and her black boyfriend.

There aren't any extras to speak of. The scene selection only links to four scenes on the disc, and in fact there are no ""chapters"" to jump between. The disc is fair quality, but both Windows Media Player and my DVD player kind of ""froze"" at the end of the disc.",1304985600,,1114,4.678571428571429
