7880201,1,6304967292,"I was utterly disappointed in this video.  Stanford gets jocked up for the cover photo, but his only qualification is attending a bunch of schools and winning a National Tactical Invitational.  It doesn't take winning a gunfight to make qualify an instructor but winning a competition does?  The shooting is mediocre and his presentation is horrible.  The techniques are okay, but you get much more for your money with one of the Gunsite videos.  Pass.",1126569600,,452,4.973333333333334
7880202,3,6304967292,"This film features a known tactics and shooting instructor, Andy Stanford, lecturing to the camera. He discusses the major points of defensive shooting, and concentrates on those things where you can improve your shooting skills the most with the least work. In the film it is assumed that the viewer knows the basic stuff as they are not taugth here, only analyzed. The film covers handguns, shotguns and rifles, with the emphasis being on handguns.
The main problem with this film is that the contents are not very visual, as the film is comprised mainly of Stanford speaking to the camera. There are some short action secuences as well, but over 80% of the length of the film comprises of this lecture. The things Stanford addresses are good, and I have nothing against that. The main gripe is that this film could have been published as a book, with a fraction of the price.
