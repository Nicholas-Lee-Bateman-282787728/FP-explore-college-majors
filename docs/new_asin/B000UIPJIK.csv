2921824,5,B000UIPJIK,"I have three children.  My older two are 13 and 8, so this video series was new when my youngest (now 2) was a baby.  We have worked our way from when he was 9 months old through the whole series.  I have two things to say:  they are wonderful and they really work!  My older two kids went to school not knowing some of the things in these videos, and they are wonderful readers and good students.  So, no, these videos are not necessary.  However, my 2 year old thoroughly enjoys them and he now has a head start that my other kids did not.

At my son's 2 year old checkup, I told the doctor that he knew all his letters, numbers, colors, shapes, and was learning sight words (we had just started this video).  He was thrilled, and so was I!  No, this isn't just something to amaze friends and family with.  I recognise in him an interest in learning much earlier than my others.  A pizza slice is, ""Pizza - triangle!"" and he doesn't just have little cars, he has THREE little cars.  The sight words are great, I made flash cards and I arrange them into basic parts of sentences.  He feels like he is reading a story just like his sister and brother.

I highly recomend this (and all the rest of the DVD's) for kids of any age who do not have this knowledge yet.  My son is proud to tell you what he knows, he is interested in learning more, and he has knowledge that he will need for school.  If a child enjoys something and is learning on top of it all, I believe that is a good thing.

Enjoy!",1201910400,6,1496,4.117647058823529
2921825,5,B000UIPJIK,"My preschoolers love this DVD and they've learned to recognize these words in print. It's neat to watch a 3 and 5 yr old be able to open a book, point to words and say them. I wouldn't call it 'reading' but it's a great first step toward being able to read words that most of us 'see and say' - for example, we'd never try to 'sound-out' the word ""THE"". I recommend this DVD to everyone who has to commute with preschoolers in the back seat / car seats.",1200355200,,453,4.044444444444444
2921826,5,B000UIPJIK,"I never would have thought about introducing sight words to my son at such a young age, but he learned letters, numbers, shapes and colors with such rapid speed (from the other DVDs in the Preschool Prep Series), that I had to give this one a try.  It took about 5 viewings before he was pointing at sight words over my shoulder as I was reading magazines and newspapers.  I was not surprised.  This video uses the same formula that worked magic in the other Preschool Prep Series DVDs.  I just purchased a copy for his preschool teacher and she is now showing it to the class for 10 minutes each day.  Another great thing about this DVD is that there is a menu selection where a teacher can select a short lesson so that the class can watch the DVD in segments.  I can't say enough about these great products!",1194912000,31,810,4.33112582781457

2921829,5,B000UIPJIK,"Our 28 month old loved these videos and watches them on a portable DVD player all the time.  She's already reading.  She's unusual and her mother works with her in a lot of different ways but this certainly is a big part of it because of how excited she gets to watcher her ""site words!""",1495152000,,287,4.2
2921830,5,B000UIPJIK,"The whole ""Preschool Prep"" series is great. My favorite is the Phonics set, because those videos have taught my now 5-year-old to read, and he hasn't even entered kindergarten yet. We read books to him, and have been for years, but having a video geared to a child, that teaches them what letters say and how they behave around other letters, is invaluable. These videos make learning interesting and I now have a toddler who is interested in learning to read and recognize words just because his brother thinks the videos are cool. Now of course my kids also like to watch mindless junk like Spongebob, but we sneak in educational videos regularly, and we can definitely tell that these videos have helped him learn. I can't wait to show off his awesome skills in elementary school!",1492473600,,783,4.7226277372262775

2921833,5,B000UIPJIK,"I love all of the Preschool School Prep DVDs. Both my sons, now 4 year old and 17 month old loved it.

I started letting them watch the videos at around 7 month old, they both knew their alphabet by the time they turned 1 year old.

My 17 month old know all the 3 levels of sight words at 14 month old. He knows how to pronounce 95% of the words, the rest he knows but just can't pronounce them due to his age.

My 4 year old is at 3rd grade reading level or above thanks to these DVDs. He knows how to read starting at age 2, I brought all of the sight words & phonics reader books for him.

I usually don't write reviews, but since these DVDs proven to work on both of my sons, I think I owed the company a review.",1485820800,,716,3.8175675675675675

2921839,4,B000UIPJIK,"I feel like this product needs to be defended.  There is nothing fun about sight words... and no magic pill to make them easier to learn. However, as an educator, my kids learned all their sight words early from these. One helpful review suggested sitting with your child for the first viewing and really engaging in the DVD.  For example, excitedly say, ""wow! It! Look at it!"" And if you are excited, your child probably will be to. Is this a gripping plot driven movie? Nope. But if you want an extra, maybe even more fun than flash cards and a good step in the right direction, this will help.",1476748800,,596,4.409090909090909

2921851,5,B000UIPJIK,Great product!! My 2 year old already knew words from the (your baby can read) program from he was 1. I started him off from he was 3 months old. I recently added this after trying to find sight words programs on youtube but was unsuccessful.  I love the concept and the unique characters. He learned them all in just about 2 days. Now he's able to read basic sentences by connecting words from 'your baby can read' and these sight words. I do believe the uniqueness of how the words are taught is what made him learn them so quickly. Definitely recommend!!!!,1462924800,3,559,4.427184466019417

2921855,1,B000UIPJIK,I ordered the sight words video.  Inside the dvd cartridge was the letter sound video.  I figured we could watch it and practice the letter sounds...but I was dismayed that it was not the sounds but rather just the names of the letters.  I'm sending it back.

2921862,5,B000UIPJIK,"After both of my children mastered letter sounds between the ages of 2-3, I then introduced the Preschool Prep Series: Meet the Sight Words. Between the ages of 3-4, they enjoyed watching the videos and using the flash cards. During this year, not only were they ""memorizing"" the sight words, I also taught them how to sound out CVC (consonant, vowel, consonant) words. By 4 years old, both of my kids were reading Scholastic BOB books and beginning reader books like the Biscuit series. I truly believe the Preschool Prep Series gave my kids that head start to reading independently!

How did I implement it? It was played at home sporadically as background noise and it was also played in the car during student pick-up at the school. We'd create games with the flash cards which made learning even more fun.",1453852800,,810,4.74468085106383

2921868,5,B000UIPJIK,"We started my grandson watching Preschool Prep educational video series at about age 18 months beginning with colors and shapes and numbers (repetitiously) then right on thru all reading videos (repeticiously) until he had watched them all. As a result, he was reading at kindergarten level by age 3. He's almost 5 now, and since we have carried thru by reading to him a lot, having him read to us a lot, and having him read things everywhere we go, he is now reading at about a 2nd-3rd grade level, with perhaps a little gap in reading comprehension (he knows how to sound out even many big words but may not always rmbr their meaning). Another thing that helped big time - NO CABLE TV. So preschool prep and books and other educational things were fun and games to him. His mind was never zombified by Sponge Bob and other cable TV cartoons, or mindless video games which seem to make kids really bored of educational imagery. It all began with Preschool Prep.

We said, ""I'm playing it for Daddy to see."" And i took the advice of other reviews and just played it in the background. After a few times of presenting it like this, whenever I turn it on now she is glued.  Now she requests different levels.  She started recognizing the sight words when we read before bed within a couple days!  Now she recognizes the sight words on signs, instructions and our adult books!

2921887,5,B000UIPJIK,"I am writing this because I happened across some negative reviews on here that took me by surprise.  My son was 5 1/2 and was struggling to read both sight words and by sounding out. He had learned all his letters and sounds by 3 but just couldn't blend them together. I have been a teacher for several years and have even tutored many struggling readers. Nothing was working and my son, who loves books, and was really getting discouraged. I tried Meet the Sight Words 1 by renting it here on Amazon Instant Video thinking that if he liked it I would go ahead and buy it. Well, he picked up on the words so quickly that by the end of the rental he knew the words. He loved the video so we rented the other 2 as well.  I got the flash cards and books. In a matter of a few weeks he went from having no sight word vocabulary to having almost 50 and was reading the books! He was so proud of himself and gained the confidence he needed to keep working on his reading skills. He is now 7 and although reading is still a struggle for him he is progressing and is almost to grade level. These videos were THE game changer. Now I'm getting ready to rent them all again for my daughter and we shall see how she does with them. She already is starting to sound out some words so these videos may or may not be helpful. My point is this. Children learn differently. For my son, this was just what he needed. If your child kindergartener or 1st grader is struggling with traditional instruction this may be just what he needs. For those reviews that are complaining that their 2 or 3 or even 4 year old didn't get it, maybe your expectations weren't met because your child is much too young.  Developmentally it would be much more appropriate to be reading all sorts of picture books including ABC books and counting books, singing songs and doing nursery rhymes, engaging them in hands on crafts involving coloring, painting, gluing, cutting, etc. I have and willcontinue to recommend renting/purchasing these videos as well as the flash cards and books.

2921906,3,B000UIPJIK,"With all the 5 star reviews, I expected big things with this DVD and the related books. We have Leapfrog and Rock N Learn DVDs on other subjects, and I think they just do a better job so I was a bit disappointed in this.  Basically, it is a DVD of site words where the narrator pronounces each word several times, the word turns into a cartoon scene like a bat swinging at a baseball or a jackhammer drilling concrete, and then it turns back into the word.

As another reviewer pointed out, there is no connection between the words and the cartoon objects they turn into.  So for example, the word ""if"" will flash on the screen and a narrator will pronounce it a few times and then ""if"" will turn into a plumber and wrench where the ""i"" is the plumber and the ""f"" is the wrench and they are fixing a leaking pipe.  The narrator says ""if"" a few more times, it turns back into the regular word spelling, and that is it.  Cute little cartoon images, but no jingle to remember it, no using it in a sentence...no connection between the word ""if"" and plumbing.  My 4 year old just said ""look Mommy, a wrench!"" and that was his take away.  He did sit through the whole thing (which is why I gave it 3 stars since his attention span is low), but I don't know that he retained any site words.

In terms of reinforcement and starting to read, they have the related Meet the Site Words books.  We haven't started using them yet, but there are a lot of words in them!  So basically, your child has to have all the words memorized before starting the books.  I would therefore highly recommend getting the flashcards, although the Meet the Site Words flashcards are very expensive for flashcards.  Actually, considering that the DVD is someone reading each site word over and over, you could just do the same thing with flashcards instead of the DVD.  What I have also been doing is picking a site word like he each night during story time and when we come to a he in the story, asking my four year old what the word is to reinforce it.  I personally probably wouldnt buy this product again, but since I have it, I will try to work with it.",1421712000,10,2127,4.285

2921934,4,B000UIPJIK,"I vowed to avoid plopping my son in front of the TV and went as far as canceling cable and selling the TVs.  Still, when I was desperate (really desperate) for a workout, I let my son watch this video.  He was 14 months and transfixed.  His speaking improved dramatically.  I never noticed how rapidly I talk to him, but the pace of this video seemed to help him.  He talked back to it.  He ""seems"" to have figured out the word play and he, after about three watches.  Regardless, he is much more interested in letters now, so I think it was a good attempt at teaching him sight words.

I can imagine this would get dull for older children, but for a small child it seemed like the right pace.  We don't have major finance constraints, so the price seemed reasonable to me.

I will echo other complaints that the pictures don't really tie to the word.  Play is an exception, it has a baseball game.  He is illustrated with a castle, so that makes little sense.  This didn't seem to matter to my son, however.",1391817600,,1008,4.297872340425532
2921935,3,B000UIPJIK,"My child is in Kindergarten but needs a lot of repetition before she can retain memorized facts. I knew going in that the DVD was probably going to be a bit boring for her, especially since it seems like it's geared toward younger children, but I just wanted to pop it into the DVD in our car so she got extra practice while we weren't able to work on them together at home. I bought all three DVDs and the third set of books.

The DVDs are pretty boring -- to the point that she tunes it out before she's learned all the words because she's bored to tears. That being said, it has helped her remember some of the words better than if we were just working on them at home. Overall I'm glad I got them but I wish I had seen it a couple years ago when it would have held her attention longer. If your child has a hard time focusing their attention on the TV you might want to think twice about getting the DVDs.

The books are another story -- those are great. Based on other reviews I only got the third set that contains all the words from the three DVDs and I really do like them. Somehow every sentence is made from mostly sight words, which means it's great practice of all the words. I'm sure you're all familiar with Level 1 readers that have a few sight words sprinkled throughout the book with most of the words being longer, sound-out types that make it more difficult for a budding reader. Even the books aimed at being ""sight word"" helpers don't typically include very many sight words. These books actually have a lot of the words in them, in easy sentences, with engaging story lines.

He just turned three and now knows about 30 sight words by memory and loves looking for them in books and signs. I understand what people are saying about the animations not matching the words, but they make the connection. My son will point to the word ""in"" and say that it is the peacock one (because there is a peacock in the animation). He makes that connection and then memorizes the word that much faster.

2921969,5,B000UIPJIK,"No kidding, I've used all of the Preschool Prep Co. DVDs for our daughter.  She learned soooo fast and picked up so much from them.  They seem very simple, repetative, but that is the magic.  Kids are mesmerized!  We gave them all away as she grew older and then had our son!  We had to go and buy some more for him.  I highly recommend these videos for kids of all abilities.",1356739200,,376,4.152777777777778

2921971,5,B000UIPJIK,My kids learned so much from the preschool prep DVDs. We have bought the meet the sight word set and the phonics set. Along with the meet the sight word books. This company really nailed the learning aspect. I find he DVDs boring after the first Imelda so I play them in the car DVD player. They enjoy them and even my six year old who is reading at the second grade level is enjoying them again as his brother is now learning to read. I thought he would whine to watch the again because he is way past this level now but he still enjoys them and encouraging his brother to read. The phonics and sight word DVD sets along with B.O.B. books is all you need to easily teach your child to read before they are even in kindergarten.,1353801600,,728,4.170212765957447
2921972,5,B000UIPJIK,My daughter is 15 months old and loves this DVD.  After only watching a few times she repeats the words she sees on the TV.  I have been so impressed with this line of learning for children. You will be amazed to see how fast they will learn.,1353369600,,242,4.020833333333333

My two year old knows how to read her sight words now thanks to these DVDs. I also bought the other ""Meet The"" DVDs. Meet The Numbers, Meet The Letters ect. All of them worked perfectly.

Even my 2 yr old son picked up one word after I thought he wasn't paying attention. Every time the word ""be"" comes on he says it so I know it isn't a fluke. I keep it on while the kids play. It seems to be helping. I bought all 3 and just play them all on different days. I'm very happy I bought them! I only wish I did it sooner.",1352160000,,474,3.5238095238095237

My son started using the products mentioned above before he was two years old (15months) and it worked great in all areas of his development in learning. I decided to try the sight words as i felt that he got all he could from the others (he perfected it) and it was time for the next step. he was able to sit and watch for the entire video and liked it. He repeated every word that was shown, he could Identify many of the word when we read his favorite books together i can only say that he will know them all very soon. This is a wonderful product to get for preschoolers. Excellent! I will continue to use all their products because they work. But don take my word try and see. The only suggestion with some children you will need to do it in phases don't over whelm them do 5 to ten minutes at a time until you see that the really want more which they will.",1351382400,,1010,4.131979695431472

At the age of 1 I introduced the dvds to my son putting a different one on each time the other ended and only in the car.
He only watched the dvds while in the car and most car trips were less than 15min long.

Before the age age of 2 my son could identify every letter in the alphabet, shapes, colors and numbers and now at 2 1/2 knows all the site words from all 3 DVDs.

We are now doing the 3 phonic DVDs.

We live 20 miles from anything so when we are in the car, it's always a long round trip. I figured I'd finally take advantage of these trips when she is in the car seat to throw some education in her direction. We recieved all three dvd's this morning, so on the way to the doctor, I popped in #1. After about 3 words, she finally caught on and started repeating them as they were being read to her.

She seems to really enjoy it. This is her first day, so hopefully in the future, I can get back on here and give an update with progress.",1347235200,,691,3.971223021582734

2921981,5,B000UIPJIK,"My son is 2 and learning these words quickly. This video is great!  I don't let him watch the whole video all at once, though. I play one mini lesson at a time. Once the lesson is over, I turn it off and we go play. Also, during each lesson, I sit with TJ. I have about 5 of his books nearby, and after each word is presented I push pause and have him find that word on the page. We do that about 3-5 x then, push play and move on to the next word. My son has seen this video less than 8x and has learned 5 words already.

I have My Baby Can Read...not nearly as effective as this!! I love how Meet The Sight words only uses the word that is being presented.

This is a great tool. I highly recommend it!",1338681600,,704,3.808219178082192
2921982,4,B000UIPJIK,"My daughter will be starting first grade in the fall.  She was in a Reading Support class because she struggled with decoding and had a hard time remembering her sight words.  By the middle of the school year, I was at my wit's ends with flashcards and her teachers sending home extra packets of busywork - all of which gave little to no help to my daughter.  Thank goodness for Amazon reviews! After reading the review for these DVDs, I bought this one for my daughter.

She loved it as soon as she saw it and suddenly she was retaining her sight words for Kindergarten after only a few weeks.  These DVDs give the sight words fun meaning.  For instance, ""play"" is presented with P as a player, l as a baseball bat, and a is a catcher's mitt, y is the umpire.  So I tell my daughter, ""play ball"" as she watches it. ""To"" is presented as t being a tall basketball player and o being a basketball, as in take the ball ""to"" the hoop.  ""Said"" is presented using cupcakes and a conveyor belt.  Although that image doesn't match the word, it's a strong fun, visual image because a lot of kids love cupcakes!

The video also did something for her that she loves: tell a story.  Each word tells a short story through animation.  Each word is a like a character in a book and that has held her attention.  She now has all the words in this DVD memorized, plus all of the words presented from Kindergarten. Also, thanks to Meet the Sight Words 2 and 3, she knows many sight words that are on the Dolch 1st grade Sight Word list and some are that are even on the 2nd grade list.  As a parent, I have now adopted this learning style with sight words that are not in these DVDs.

I feel so happy for her when she recognizes a word in a book, out in public, or on television - especially knowing the hard time she had in school.  ""Look, Mommy ""you!""  Look there's the word ""we!""  There's the word ""said.""

In my opinion, If your child mostly prefers high-energy ""screwball"" cartoons (like SpongeBob), or is more of a traditional concrete/rote learner, your child might not like or benefit from this video.  If your child is a visual non-traditional or abstract learner I think it's more likely that he/she will benefit from this video. I also think that if you have a special needs child who is behind in school for K or 1st grade, this video could be helpful.",1337731200,4,2346,4.324942791762013
2921983,5,B000UIPJIK,"I bought this video for my 4 year old daughter.  I had seen the ad for this video many times, but I wanted to wait until she was old enough to really take an interest.  I was skeptical after watching the first few minutes with her.  This video is nothing like Leap Frog, with a plot and jokes.  I was afraid she would get bored fast, but to my surprise, she loved it. It's very repetative, turning each sight word into some kind of character and repeating the word.  It kinda reminded me of a foreign language video.  She would watch it all the way through, and she recognized the words after just a few days!  I immediately went back and bought the 2 and 3 videos.  She now knows all 45 words and points them out while we're reading.  Its also helped her learn how words make sentences and sentences make the story.  She's also wanting to try and figure out other words, even ones that are not sight words.  It's very exciting to see her start to read, I hope to have her reading beginner books before Kindergarden, and its all thanks to these videos!",1335916800,,1052,4.289340101522843

2921985,5,B000UIPJIK,"I am the mother of a 5 year old and 2 1/2 year old. My five year old began watching these videos at 3 1/2 and knew most of the sight words in the first video within the month. He is now reading, and it made it so much easier for him that he knew those hard to sound out words by sight. The first video begins with ""of"" which is the absolute most difficult word to read because neither of the letters in the word follow the phonics rules. My 2 1/2 year old has watched these videos a handful of times over the last 6 months because I didn't think he was quite old enough for them, but he has picked up several of the sight words. They are incredibly boring to watch, as an adult, but my kids love them and ask for them especially during rest-time in the afternoon. The slow pace of the video calms them and allows their little bodies and brains to rest while they take in the information presented in the video.",1334275200,,910,4.061111111111111

2921987,5,B000UIPJIK,"I rarely take the time to write reviews, but I just had to post one for these dvds.  What an ingenious way to teach children to read, especially those who are visual-spatial learners!  My oldest child is almost five and she's not the type of learner who learns using traditional methods.  After learning about this dvd series, I ordered the 7 pack which has Meet the: Colors, Letters, Shapes, Numbers and Sight Words 1-3.  I also ordered the Level 1 Cards and book set.  We've had the dvd's for three  weeks now and our little one who is also language delayed (more expressive, but vastly improving with time and language therapy, can read at least 10 of the words.  Our 2.5 year old who also watches along with her is also learning the words. I go over the flashcards with them and our 4 yr old has a magnetic dry erase board with letters that we use to review the words.  She's also very active and I could never get her to sit still long enough to read to her.  Now, she sits on my lap while I read and I pause at words that I know she knows to give her a chance to read them; this has given her such a boost of confidence and now she sits our 15 mth old on her lap and tries to read with her.  Like another reviewer says, you should not just sit the child/children down in front of the tv and expect it to work.  Short creative reviews account for at least 50 percent of the learning that take place.  I highly recommend this, especially for visual learners.  My little ones munch on popcorn or goldfish (crackers) while they watch; this makes it pleasant for them.",1332806400,,1569,4.260135135135135

I have a set of flashcards (not from this brand) from which I pulled out the words (in the DVD Meet the Sight Words 1) out of and my children are each able to recall and recite all words. It truly is awesome what your little ones are capable of. I was truly surprised to find that my almost 2 yo knew these words as well. It was unexpected though I had hoped for as much. Excellent DVD, entertaining and educational. My children look forward to it. Needless to say I am a very proud mommy and most pleased with my purchase.",1328572800,,642,4.185483870967742

He absolutely loved them all immediately! He learned his shapes, colors, numbers, letters, and sight words by 2 years old. He is 3 now, and is eagerly working on writing those words. Every child develops at their own pace, but I would suggest getting these videos while your child is still very young. I could see children who are older (school age) getting bored with the repetition. FYI: I also have the coloring books, which he loves, and the sight word books, which he isn't quite into yet.

I had been doing flash cards with him prior and he had no interest.  As an added bonus, my baby loves the videos, too.  They are repetitive and there is no story/plot, but the words are cute.

2921996,5,B000UIPJIK,"I bought these DVD's for my 2 yr. old daughter.  When I first put the DVD in, I thought this isn't going to last long as all the narrator does is repeat the words over and over - I couldn't see her sitting through something like that. To my dismay, my daughter absolutely loves them! Within a week she started remembering the words and now, everywhere we go, I'll have her read to me (this is especially useful to keep her occupied while standing in line at a store or even in a restaurant while waiting for our meal).  I would recommend these products to anyone who has a child just starting to talk! You will be amazed at how quickly they can pick it up.  UPDATE: My daughter is now 5 and she still watches these DVD's and still loves them! We have all of them! and continue to recommend them to everyone we know.

She's crazy about this video, and now (at 3.5 years old) she can read over 10 sight words, and she just finished reading an ENTIRE Meet the Sight Words starter book!  The point of the sight words is not for the kids to just 'memorize' the words (as critics say) but to give the child some momentum to keep learning to read a book!  When they have to struggle with every single word they get tired/fustrated before 1 sentence.  With sight words, they gain tons of confidence when every other (or every third word) they can ""read!""

2922001,5,B000UIPJIK,"I would recommend this to anyone wanting a beginning reading curriculum.  I checked this series out from our local library and within two or three times of watching it my 2 and a half year old daughter was reading these sight words in stories and books and on household product packaging.  I was sooooo excited!

The videos are very catchy showing each word in an eye-catching animation with music in the background.  The speaker repeats the word throughout the animation and then later in the video they quiz you on the word with no animation/music then add it in.  Also at the end they recap the sight words using animations that show the words in more realistic settings where your child would most likely read them, for example, for the sight word PLAY it would highlight it on a video game machine that says ""press PLAY.""

I let her watch it either once or sometimes twice a day (rather than brainless cartoons on TV).  She loves it.  I also combine this with those beginning reader sets.  We like the BOB books and also check them out from the library.  The other great tool I liked was the Leap Frog videos of the Lettery Factory (where she learned the sounds the letters make) and Talking Words Factory (which teaches beginning phonics and how to put letters together to make simple words).  We alternate with these educational videos whenever she wants to watch TV.

I am going to purchase this set for my friend's son.  I would highly recommend it.",1290643200,,1458,4.604651162790698

I honestly worried at one point that my daughter was color blind, she said the wrong colors to everything. I laugh about it now but I worked with her and it was frustrating. Well it took just one week with the color video and the result was awesome!!!! She knows them all now! I'm excited about the sight words too, they both enjoy the dvds and often request them in the car, so a 15 min trip to school or back they watch it. I just tested my 3 yr old and she already knows half of the words... that is so exciting!!!! Don't knock that she's just memorizing them, because she's also figuring out that M sounds like mmmmmm and it will help her decode new words as we continue reading books together and learning the sounds of the alphabet!

2922004,1,B000UIPJIK,"This product totally failed my expectations as a parent. My two year old loves learning so he did watch the dvds but he did not benefit. With the shapes he knew them all and was even asking for the hexagon I think some description in terms of number of sides should be included. The letters was an even bigger disappointment since no sounds are provided and he loves to say what sound each letter makes from the leapfrog dvd. The sight words he repeated them but I think if they said the letters then the word it makes children would be able to learn them and the spelling. I think I wasted my $ 70. Thinking about returning it, would not even give this product to a friend. Also the age group is bogus up to six yrs no way!!!! You can try to make it fun but you still have to do a lot of the teaching for this to work. Children learn through repetition but also songs that include them, steal their attention by making them feel a part of it not the horrid singing on the meet the colors dvd. Try leapfrog is way better. We did and now he can spell his name which is a difficult name and identify any letter color number and most shapes. We are presently teaching him to spell words including the sight words we dint mind doing the work like we did with the shapes but wanted some help.

2922008,5,B000UIPJIK,"This product has helped my 2 year old son and 4 year old daughter learn their sight words almost immediately.  I bought meet the sight words 1 by itself and my kids watched it 3 times in a row (start to finish is about 35 minutes).  The video loops by itself so all you have to do is sit back and watch it work. As a follow up me and my kids read the easy reader book that came with the DVD (strangely, only meet the sight words 1 came with a book and no books came with meet the sight words 2 or 3) and review sight word flashcards daily.  As an extension we created our own book using construction paper, pictures, and sight words printed from our laptop.  We also played classic concentration using the sight words.  With all of this it took them about 1 week to memorize all the sight words.

I bought meet the sight words 2 and 3 and here it is 4 days later and they have memorized most of the words from meet the sight words 2.  Now it's time for the extension activities. I still do the sight word flashcards daily, but the video does most of the work.

Another great feature of the videos is the video flashcards. The kids get about 10 seconds to guess the word before the video says it.  Best of all, this is an endless loop as well so all you have to do is put it on and watch.  It's perfect for when you have a couple of minutes when you need to distract your kid (combing my daughter's hair, getting them dressed in the morning, etc.)  The only downside is that each video has only about 15 words for a total of 45 sight words in total.  I believe there are about 200 sight words in total so I am going to have to figure out an interesting way to teach the other words.

FYI the leapfrog letter factory worked just as well.  It's the same kind of concept.  The videos seem silly to me and a little dumb, but the kids love them and they WORK.",1280188800,,1853,4.052197802197802

I had purchased this video through scholastic few years back for my older sons one was having trouble reading in second grade, the other child I just wanted to get a bit of help through kindergarten. (He by the way is reading now and its the end of the year in K). Well, my daughter Lizzie found this (to me very boaring dvd)exciting and asked for it all day long!! She was so upset when I just couldn't tollerated it any more and turned it off. One day a week, maybe 2 after her first viewing of this DVD, I was reading my own book and she came up and sat by me and pointed to a word (in my book) and said ""it"" mama, that word is ""it""! Sure enough after going through a few books, she was reading every word from the sight word DVD! Not only that she was trying (and sometimes succeding) at sounding out other words. I am so amazed! My baby is reading small beginner books and isn't even 2 till June 13th! I'm not a freak who spends all day with flash cards pushing this stuff on their kid, I am a regular average house, well stay at home mommy. I don't let my kid watch tv all day either I am choosie about what all my kids watch. Sometimes you do need to put them down in front of the set, when you have older kids its nearly unavoidable. If you have time to watch w them of course they love it, if not I just don't see the harm of this type of education.  My kid seems to like this dvd more than Dora and Pet pets (Wonder Pets). I am going to buy the other sight word Dvds today and give them to her for her birthday (if I can wait that long.

If my child likes it at any point I will buy the other 2 volumes since the library didn't have them.  I think it is a great concept but extremely boring.  I think this would be something like ""Your Baby Can Read."" It is another resource that you can occasionally view.

After the first couple of days both of them had mastered all of the sight words in this movie and yet they still keep asking to watch it. I have since ordered the second and third knowing they will love those as well. I know they are aware of these words outside the scope of the movie as well because they will often point out words they know on signs and in books. These are not the first words my boys have learned to read. My oldest is able to phonetically sound small words out to pronounce them, this is part of his autism called hyperlexia. He has always had an affinity for letters, words, numbers, and symbols but this DVD is a great addition to our home library that they will watch again and again. I don't think that all kids will have an interest in this DVD but my boys already have a natural love of letters.

He has started to read basic words like ""cat"" so this was the perfect next step.  I also had some word cards that we played with after the video to review what he was learning on the video.

The problem for having my 1 1/2 year old watching it is he picked up a stuffed whale and said ""my"" which is the world associated with object on the DVD and he used to call it a whale.  It is not good for the younger kids to watch and associate the word with the wrong thing!  But, again, my 4 years old loves it and we will get the next one now.",1245715200,,629,3.7709923664122136

After watching it a couple of times he had already put a couple of the words to memory. We've owned the video since 5/6/09 and he knows all 15 sight words! I can write them down on paper and he has no trouble figuring out what they are.  These DVDs keep my son better entertained than most of the garbage on TV and he is learning at the same time. I am very pleased with these videos! There is a lot of repetition in this video and the others in the series, but it works.  The sight words included in this DVD are:

2922021,5,B000UIPJIK,"The first time my mom and I watched this video with my 5 year old, I was very skeptical. It didn't make any sense how the words associated with the animations and graphics.  For example ""the"" is displayed on a helicopter. However, I had been teaching my daughter a few sight words for about 3 months and she was struggling.  She only watched the video twice and the next time I was reading a book to her she was pointing out ""play"", ""said"" ""for"" ""it"" ""he"" and ""the"" - words that I had not even taught her yet.  In addition, we had been working on the word ""and"" but she always stumbled and paused for a long time when she saw ""and"" while reading it.  However, after watching the video twice, she hasn't struggled with it again.
The only thing I didn't like was that they don't teach ""See"", ""like"" ""my"" and ""here"" which are some of the first words that the Houghton Mifflen program teaches.  I guess I have to buy Sight Words 2.

The characters are cute, but this will confuse kids because there is no connection between how the characters look and the action they are engaged in.  The voice on the DVD just repeats the word over and over again (""in, in, in, in in,"").

2922036,5,B000UIPJIK,"Not only am I a parent, but I'm also a teacher.  I recommend this video to everyone.  My 2-year old daughter has about 25 sight words that she can recognize ANYWHERE.  It took her several weeks to begin learning the words from the original first video.  She enjoyed the viedos so much that she watched portions of them several times daily.  I love that they have them segmented into 10-minute sections.  We have had the 2nd video (actually the free supplmental one) for about one week, and she has already begun to name over half the words instantly.  She really enjoys watching her word videos and loves to pick out her new sight words in the context of books.  Even my 7-year old son is capitvated by the videos.

I direct a tutoring program, and have my 4-year old pre-K students watching them at home as well as my 7-year old struggling first grader.  All of their parents are amazed at how quickly they are learnng the words--especially the first grader who didn't learn a single sight word in all of kindergarten.  It took me 2 months to teach him 3 sight words.  Once he started watching the video (2 weeks ago), he has begun to recognize 5 - 6 new words already.  His mom couldn't be more pleased.

My friend and I teach our daughters together a few times weekly.  It's neat that both my 2-year old and her early 3-year old can reconize all the words from the original video (23 words).  6 months ago, I would never have imagined teaching such advanced lessons to such tiny children.  Because of the video, they are actually reading real books.  It's amazing!!

I will say that children who are accustomed to watching a lot of tv, especially those rapidly paced cartoons probably will not enjoy these videos.  They have a very slow pace (which is neccesary to accomplish their purpose) and there is no thrill.  Neither of my children watch a lot of tv (and never the cartoons with the fast animation), so they are able to fully enjoy this video.

I wasn't as impressed with the Letter Video though, and neither was my daughter.  She just never got ""into"" it.

He is going to be 2 this weekend and he has known his colors, numbers and shapes for several months due to these great DVDs. It's extra fun playing with him and having him refer to his Legos by color and counting peas on his plate, etc. Walking down the street he points at ""rectangles"", ""triangles"", colors of flowers, letters, etc. He got really excited by the Big Letters on a Fed Ex truck recently saying ""BIG X"" and ""BIG E"" etc.

With my 4 year old I first previewed the video alone ---wanted to know how boring it might be and how I would present it to my son.  Once I figured out the format I decided to view the dvd with my son each time and bounced him on my lap and clapped and smiled a lot.  He loved the time together and my reactions and therefore liked the dvd.  I also put the words on flash cards and gave him a flyswatter to swat the sight words on the table and made a lot of other games  with these words.  We watch it three times a day and I am careful to watch him for signs of boredom and 99% of the time I watch with him and encourage him.  I tried to limit him to two lessons per viewing but he insists on watching at least 4 each time.  This is important to me and my son feels that, so it has become important to him.  For those of you who have kids who are easily bored and distracted watch the dvd with them and invest the time.  After 4 days my son learned all 23 words!

However, I have a few struggling students who need reinforcement with sight words. One had no preschool experience, one has severe emotional problems, one is an ESL student, learning English for the first time and one is very immature.
I am using this DVD in a center where children use wireless headphones. They only listen for one ten minute segment a day. I am hoping (and believing) that by the end of the school year, all of these students will have mastered the words on the video.
I would love for Kathy Oxley to produce a DVD on the color words and I would like the option to purchase all of the characters on card stock to use as display or flash cards.
I am very happy with this product.",1204416000,,817,4.381578947368421
2922046,5,B000UIPJIK,My daughter loves all the videos in this series. They repeat each word and help your child recognize common words used in children's books. Great for helping children learn to read from birth to kindergarten(Although I would start with Meet the Colors for smaller children).,1204070400,,274,5.111111111111111
2922047,3,B000UIPJIK,My three year old loves it but my five year old who I bought it for cannot stand to watch it. It is geared for younger viewers who are not ready for sight words. I wish it was geared for five year olds.,1203120000,5,202,3.7209302325581395
2922048,5,B000UIPJIK,"We've gotten all the DVDs made by preschool prep, and every one of them has been incredibly helpful. My daughter learned her numbers at 14 months, and her shapes, colors and letters by 16. She's now 21 months and can read and recognize all the words they teach, and understands the concept of how reading works. I 100% recommend all of these, and am looking forward to Meet the Words 2, which I understand is in the works.",1202774400,,422,4.423076923076923

8213365,2,B000UIPJIK,"Extremely boring, my 2 year old and I couldn't watch more than 5 minutes of it. Dissapointed...",1506038400,2,95,4.647058823529412
8213366,4,B000UIPJIK,"At first I wasn't sure, but my 5 year old was struggling with sight words and reading during Kindergarten, I played her this during the summer consistently and she's a visual learner. It's a bit slow so it depends on your child, but it is repetitive in a good way and the images help, it comes with a book and after a few weeks to my surprise it sunk in and she was reading it. Most of reading is about memorizing and recognizing  this helps to do that. Again, if your kids attention span is on the less patient side they may get bored. Even my hyper 2 year old and my 8 month old enjoy it but they grew up on learning shows so it depends on the child and their interests and what holds there attention. I recommend it for kids who are more patient and like to learn visually and in general.",1501459200,,791,4.103225806451613
