528351,3,6302967376,"A good 90+ minute concert -- a nice mix of hits and some albumcuts and his voice is strong.  There is some poor editing between thefirst and second acts (I attended a show during this tour), and there's a bit too much of the medley material.
I had this on tape, and the video of this DVD unfortunately isn't much better (watch the scroll credits and wait for the motion sickness).  This seems to have been shot using video, and someone purposely used a soft focus for most of the close-ups of Manilow while the crowd shots are sharp.  For some, the good news is the option to hear remastered 5.1 audio.  I don't have a set-up like that, so I can't give any further news on that.
However, I've been a Manilow fan for 25 years so for me, this purchase was a no-brainer.  And if you've read this far, it's probably the same for you.",953251200,19,829,4.254777070063694
528352,5,6302967376,"This is a fabuloous concert! Its Barry at his best! To have it on DVD even makes it better.  The quality is wonderful.  It also not a short concert.  My favorites are  ""Stay"",""If Tomorrow Never  Comes"",""CIBM"", and ""The Best of Me!""  Its a must  have for all Barry fans even if you have it already on VHS",952214400,12,303,4.2105263157894735
528353,5,6302967376,"England loves the guy and he definitely responded. Manilow was definitely ""on""; every note rang like a bell, he projected, he emoted, he changed the versions of the original recordings to keep you in suspense.
Medley of ""This One's For You"" and ""Trying To Get The  Feeling"" cannot be improved upon--they're that good.  ""Weekend In  New England"" shows the man's genius as he injects Debussy-like  substitute chords into the introduction. And at the end, watch for the most  incredible rapport between performer and audience as the crowd  ""mirrors"" his sighing. Truly magic.
Great stage production, he  is not reluctant to let the talent around him do their thing. Extremely  tightly-knit band with superb drummer who gives the music everything it  needs. The sound quality is first-rate.
I will be watching this video  many years from now in my rocking chair, still in awe of this pheonomenal  interpreter of American Popular Song.",950486400,19,930,5.0927152317880795

528405,4,6302967376,We have always like this show. We have it on VHS and bought this DVD to update our collection.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because there is a glitch in the DVD. When you are playing it the whole way through when the song Weekend in New England ends and Can't Smile Without You starts the video part breaks up. You have to stop the DVD and then hit play and everything is fine.  We had bought this DVD before from another supplier and when it did this we sent it back thinking we just had the bad luck of getting a defective DVD. This new one did the same thing at the same spot so it must be a defect in the recording of the DVD. If you can overlook the glitch it is still a great show.,1407024000,,704,3.8482758620689657

528444,5,6302967376,"Hi, this is actually Tom's wife. I have always loved the ballads of Barry Manilow's hits from the 70's!! I guess I really wanted to go down memory lane. This concert was filmed in England during the early 90's. It seemed by now, Barry had really come into his own. He no longer was that gawky, awkward singer. Matter-of-fact, he looked and sounded amazing!! He chose such a great variety of songs. He even included the lovely song, ""Stay"" which surprisingly was only a hit in England. Barry even sings ""If Tomorrow Never Comes"" written by country singer Garth Brooks. Of course, he puts his own twist to the song & it sounds great!! Although, ""Could It Be Magic"" was originally a slow/romantic ballad, Barry & his backup singers performed the up tempo version. As always, Barry engages the audience with his humor and generosity. It was absolutely evident that this great showman enjoyed every moment on the stage!!! I highly recommend this DVD...you will not be disappointed!!!",1354320000,,978,4.8273809523809526

His shows haven't been the same since IMHO.  This really brings back GREAT memories!  Including a concert I went to in Atlantic City, NJ. I was the girl he picked out of the audience for ""Can't Smile Without you.""  I still have my video!  I very fun moment in my life!",1236384000,,430,4.246913580246914

528479,5,6302967376,"This is one SUPERFANTASTICONCERT! Done at Wembley Arena, London, in 1993, it is one of the 3 best Barry DVDs I've seen to date. It is a wee bit over 1 1/2 hours of heart-thumpin' foot-stompin' ENERGY!!! Barry just jumps all over the stage on this one when he's not sitting at the piano. He puts the energizer bunny to shame 100 times over. The renditions of the songs are great, as is the quality of the DVD. You will not be disappointed. In between the songs, Barry chit chats with the audience.

It begins and ends with a clip of ""The Best of Me."" As always, Barry sings great songs and medleys, with so much feeling in them. He truly sings with his heart and soul.

Included is a fantastic version of one of my all-time Barry favorites ""I Don't Wanna Walk Without You."" ""Travelin' Medley: A Little Travelin' Music Please,"" is a nice up-beat clip, and he quickly moves into the high-energy ""New York City Rhythm"" (and he's UP!)--and he's bangin' the piano keys. Now he's up again. There he goes! ""Avenue C"" gives off some wild jazz vocals and some movement. Now to ""Jumpin At the Woodside"" and ""Bandstand Boogie."" The crowd is going wild!

This video is done so well, that when Barry is sitting at the piano, he makes you feel like you have a chair on stage, right in front of him while he's singing to you. You're so close, that you can see the water rolling down his face. There is also the high-energy ""Copacabana"" and another of my favorites ""Stay,"" an absolutely beautiful song. Barry says it was only a hit in England. I don't know why. It's so pretty and so sexy! It's not on many of his CDs either. London is lovin' it and singin' along. What an awesome showman he is! That was an extended version of ""Stay"". ""If Tomorrow Never Comes,"" a beautiful Garth Brooks song, is also included (...if tomorrow never comes, will she know how much I love her...), absolutely beautiful words and music. The very upbeat version of ""Could It Be Magic."" Oh this one is soooo good! And he's up! and wigglin' all over the stage! Holy cow! The crowd is goin' wild! This clip alone is worth the price of the video. There is also a high-energy version of ""I'm Your Man"".

Barry looks great in this one. The London crowd obviously LOVES Barry. He gives 120 % and they give it right back to him in applause. The musical and vocal accompaniment is also great. This is a high-energy performance and a great DVD to have. Ok. I'm going to bed now. It's midnight. Whew! Whaddahperformance! Whaddahshowman. Whaddahguy! Goodnight Chet. Goodnight John Boy.

528496,4,6302967376,"if nobody knew by now, the UK loves Barry Manilow in a way the U.S. never did. It's a funny thing: he sold more albums in the U.S. but he had the most positive support from the UK. THAT don't make too much sense unless us Manilow fans here in the U.S. ignore bad reviews and judge for ourself. this video is great...i give it 4 stars because he tries to cram in too much material, resulting in all the medley's here. The first two selections aren't even medleys or full length, just a line or two at best. the concert, filmed in London in April 1993, shows us why he spent the majority of the '80s on tour in the UK and around the English-speaking world. He tells us that the UK radio stations ""have class"" when he makes reference to the 1982 song ""Stay"" only being a hit in England...this is all done in fun, however. ""Avenue C"" can't be understood...there's too much Billy the Kidd, too. In reference to the ones who had complaints, this video was recorded on film...not videotape...that's why the picture looks grainy or dull...videotape is shiny and bright like the ""Manilow Live"" video from 2000. i loved the performances of ""Copacabana"", ""Im Your Man"", ""Send in the Clowns"", ""Weekend in New England"", ""Looks Like We Made It"", ""A Little Travelin Music Please"", and ""I Write the Songs""...the version of ""Could It Be Magic?"" on this video is the 1993 UK up-tempo version. Manilow also showcases the Garth Brooks song ""If Tomorrow Never Comes"" and later closes with a performance of ""The Best of Me"". These two songs were also featured on the massive box set from 1992 called ""The Complete Collection and then Some..."" and this is partially why the video has the title ""The Greatest Hits and then Some..."" as a marketing device.",1076544000,7,1730,4.565916398713826
528497,4,6302967376,"I picked this DVD up recently and I did enjoy it much. One song on tne DVD has got me baffled.""Tryin' To Get The Feeling Again""is weird on my disk. Barry's mouth doesn't stay in sync with what is coming out of the speakers. Did anyone else notice this?The rest of the songs are ok. He does seem to sing a hare sharp on some notes throughout the concert. It's nice to see these songs performed by the man who originally recorded them. I do think the studio versions are more appealing.",1033171200,3,484,4.271739130434782

For fans of Manilow this is a must to own. For non-fans this is a great sample of his work and style. Barry is a performer and is very down-to-earth in his delivery.
He shows he has humor, compassion and a lot of energy. He also presents himself as a real person. Quips about his hometown and family too.

Those that are saying ""the quality is wonderful"" on this ""great DVD"" that was ""beautifully captured"" are not telling you the whole truth.
The good news: As everyone here has said, the performance on this disc is great.  His band doesn't get much screen time, but I'm sure most people are OK with that.  The remastered audio is also *very* good.
The bad news: The video (the picture) and the 2-channel mix haven't been improved at all.  Frankly, the picture quality is on par with a VHS *copy*.  I understand the soft focus on Barry, but overall I was really disappointed when I loaded this thing.
This is a very cheap disc, so it's difficult to complain too much.  In fact, I'm not saying you shouldn't buy it.  Just know what to expect when you do, and don't play it if you're trying to talk your friends into getting a DVD player.  :-)

This production was just breath-taking in the fast pace of song changes and dance routines and costumes.  Barry looked delicious in his Levy jeans.  I really think his body looks its best in the Levy jeans in whatever set he is doing.  His jackets are beautiful but his body loves those lean jeans.  He can wear suit gear on top but his body and movement just appears fluid when he is wearing jeans.  He has splendid taste in suits and shirts and jackets and moves so elegantly as he struts around singing and dancing but he just simply needs jeans to express his ""Devine"" vocal notes of love for his audiences who devour his pure throaty and powerful messages.

I have purchased quite a few of his DVDs but this one is my favorite.  I put it on when I need a lift.  I plan on buying some of his older productions but this one seems to be one of his very best.
