4240619,4,B0040MF220,"A nice selection of classical music related to the Christmas season and some Christmas carols.  Video of Christmas/Winter scenes from Austria, Germany and Switzerland.  A nice mix of urban and rural settings.",1389484800,,208,5.46875
4240620,2,B0040MF220,Not enough scenery The music was good but  too many  close up  photos of  statues which  wasn't so interesting to my viewing group.,1388361600,,131,4.521739130434782
4240621,5,B0040MF220,"Beautiful music, beautiful scenery, gorgeous churches, excellent camerawork - indeed, a work of art in itself. A wonderful way to spend an hour.",1387929600,,144,5.304347826086956
4240622,4,B0040MF220,"I call this DVD a musical Christmas card.  So many scenes in this ""journey"" look like Christmas cards I have seen over the years, and the classical music is beautiful.  Sending a copy to family instead of a Christmas card this year.",1386374400,,232,4.5
4240623,5,B0040MF220,"I truly enjoyed the mixture of music and scenery in this DVD.  I will return to this
each Christmas and relive the pleasant Christmas memories I experienced in July
when I got this DVD.  This is a DVD for classical music lovers and travelers.",1378080000,5,242,4.4772727272727275
4240624,5,B0040MF220,"Beatufil video with great music and great views.
I enjoyed it a lot.
It is great to relax and enjoy.",1365292800,,100,4.05
4240625,5,B0040MF220,I gave this to an older relative of mine for Christmas and she loved it.  I have since noticed it playing on several trips to her house.,1364860800,4,136,4.037037037037037
4240626,5,B0040MF220,"The vendor I purchased this from sent one with the older cover, dated 2010.  So I would recommend purchasing directly through Amazon or through the vendor TravelVideoStore, since they produce it.  Nonetheless, the dvd is wonderful.  A leaflet inside the case describes the locations and music, and each scene on the dvd has a description before the scene begins.  Lots of Austrian scenes with a sprinkling of Germany and Switzerland.  I would have liked to have seen more of Germany, but the content is still very enjoyable and beautiful.  Lots of churches, nativity scenes, and Christmas markets with some beautiful wintry nature scenes.  This would be a great thing to have on while putting up Christmas decorations or having a holiday celebration, or just relaxing with a cup of cider or eggnog.  If you've never been to Europe at Christmas to visit the Christmas markets, this is an excellent introduction to the way Europeans celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ.  It is lovely!",1354320000,7,982,4.975460122699387
4240627,5,B0040MF220,"Beautifully filmed and arranged!  Note that this is not a documentary - it is a musical journey. If you like listening to music and would like some great visual stimulation as well while you do, this is for you. The images are lovely and fit the music well. The city Christmas lights and decorations are very beautiful of course, and some of the churches featured are amazing.

If you know the old Naxos series most of those were very good as well but you didn't know what you were seeing unless you stopped the disk and went to the menu. They fixed it in this series by inserting a simple slide with a little information at the beginning of each section. As this is not a documentary per say, no more than that is needed, in my opinion -just enough to give some info without stopping the flow of music. No talking! Great!",1296950400,17,822,4.366013071895424

8412394,4,B0040MF220,"The music of Bach and Handel is great! While there are beautiful scenes, others are very pedestrian. I don't think the video quite comes up to the level of the sound track.",1418515200,,172,4.40625
8412395,5,B0040MF220,"Wonderful scenery, wonderful music. In the mid-1980s, I became a devoted follower of Klaus Heymann's budget classical music CDs. There are
outstanding performances in that vast repertoire; the majority of them performed by little known and highly underestimated musicians. It was a
big pleasure to sit and enjoy this musical journey with very festive Naxos music. Thank you, Herr Heymann for taking that initially unprofitable
step into classical music CD production history.",1418083200,,475,5.611111111111111
8412396,2,B0040MF220,"Eh...kind of boring. Not bad, but like driving the neighborhood looking at decorations while listening to classical Christmas music",1417910400,,131,5.947368421052632
