* the casing is bad , the case can hold 3 cds max and theyve stuffed 6 inside.
* watched Ninja hunter and Bruce le vs Ninja ( it's actually called concord of bruce)

i watched these movies when i was a kid so its brings back memories thats why i kinda like em, so unless you're a fan of
old karate movies with, weird clothing, half of the dialogue going ""HAHAHAHAHAHA you'll be sorry "" 5 meter eyebrows & the sound IJ IJ IJ IJ IJ every 2 seconds , don't buy it

i enjoyed it, but as far as i remember the VHS quality i had when i was a kdi was better than that on the dvd.

* bruce le vs ninja  had nude scenes however they are cut on the dvd !!

so its a good deal for the price and if you're a fan, t would be cool to have it in your dvd library....",1281571200,2,770,3.6932515337423313
