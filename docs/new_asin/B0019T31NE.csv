Rogelio Guerra is fantastic as the villain, Lupita Ferrer is simply terrible as his wife. She can't act, period. Demian Bichir is good as usual. Jose Angel Llamas is almost as bad as Lupita Ferrer. All he knows how to do is shout. In the role of lead babe, Ana Colchero is adequate, but barely. I would like to know why she was replaced after 15 hours by Christiane Gout. Pregnancy? Sickness? Contract dispute? Does anyone know? She was somewhat better in Corazon Salvaje, but it was a smaller part.",1258588800,,672,4.608333333333333
8465792,4,B0019T31NE,"The telenovela was great, the only problem is that the editing is not the best.  I know these are abridged versions, but just be aware that you will be a bit confused at times because you don't know what is going on.  Overall, however, its a great novela and it will bring back all those memories if you saw it the first time on TV",1238112000,,331,4.076923076923077
