172505,5,0966012216,"If you've never danced, I think you need the first DVD, because in that one, the instructor takes the time to actually teach the technique. Whereas in this one, she takes you through the moves, but expects you to know the technique. It is obvious that you can't just throw someone into ballet. I love this series, especially the DVD chapter breaks!",1132790400,26,348,4.629032258064516
172506,1,0966012216,"This is bascially the same production was Ballet 101, just edited and with a few new moves.  Don't waste your money.  Stick with Ballet 101 to learn the basic positions.",1128038400,18,169,4.6
172507,4,0966012216,"I found these teaching video to be informative,and helpful to myself in teaching proper alighment to my students. I lend out these tapes to my students, and I have seen a differance in their
work. Now instead of pointing their foot strait,they have more turn out,and they lift there heel in their point. It backs up what I teach them.

172508,5,0966012216,"I bought the 101 tape for my 10 year old to prepare her for her first ballet class. And as is suggested, I danced right along with her to supervise her moves. We enjoyed it so much that I bought the 201 tape.  I think this series does exactly what it promises it will do, in a nice smooth and slow pace for beginners. The same instructor adds on to the basic moves that you learned in 101 and then teaches you an entertaining dance at the end.  I thought it was very professionally done, as well as, a great preparation for my daughter. As a beginner, I would be wary of reviews from more experienced dancers.  I have the Howard series, and found it to be way too advanced for me and my daughter.",1054857600,7,696,4.140740740740741
172509,5,0966012216,"This video contains the basic steps of ballet. It's easy to follow for beginners. Each step is thoroughly demonstrated and easy to learn, if you have former ballet experience you will probably find it boring. The tape goes through basic exercises at the barre and in the centre and ends with a little dance made of the steps you just learned. All the beats are counted; I think this makes it easier for the beginner to follow. The instructor is very pleasant and is easy to understand. (I'm not a native English speaker, so clear pronunciation is very important to me.)",1002240000,21,569,4.643564356435643
172510,5,0966012216,"I'm a beginner, and this video was perfect.  I have the 1st tape, Ballet 101, and I loved that, too.  I am shy about attending a public class because of my weight, so I have been doing these moves at home.  There are  dance recital type videos out there, but I felt that they were way too  advanced for me.  This company seems to know the heart of the novice. They  take you through each move, and then give you a little fun dance at the  end. It's just perfect!",956966400,15,462,4.055555555555555
172511,3,0966012216,"The video does give someone with not much ballet experience a good demostration of steps, but it did not feel much like a class because the instructure counted all the beats, and I would have preferred real music.  Also I would have liked more emphasise on longer combinations, and less  emphasise on how to do the steps.  If you have had a lot of ballet  experience, this is not the video for you, but if you are still a beginner  you should appreciate this video.",956188800,19,465,4.423529411764706
172512,4,0966012216,This DVD was bought with the 101 class. You can't use this one until you've mastered the first DVD. Once you have done that this is a great DVD to continue with!,1355788800,,161,4.0625
172513,3,0966012216,"I came to this video because I'm going to be away from traditional ballet classes for a period of time and I wanted a viable alternative.  It was a decent class, if someone is following their class sequence, but it is not really meant for someone who has had ballet for any length of time.
The most confusing thing about the video is that sometimes the exercises are demonstrated and then preformed, and sometimes they are just preformed while she explains them.  The tempo of all the exercises is slow enough to accommodate either method, and after the first viewing of the lesson the confusion is significantly less.
In ballet it is not necessary to preform the most difficult steps to improve, and I intend to use this video to its fullest, but I was looking for something a little more intermediate in level.",1286841600,9,812,4.631944444444445
172514,1,0966012216,I take adult ballet and wanted to use this as a practice tool. This dvd does not warm you up enough and could damage your feet. Thankfully I knew better.,1269820800,2,153,4.133333333333334
172515,5,0966012216,Easy to follow with clear instruction. Great for beginners. Better to use both videos (Ballet 101) for easier learning.,1265068800,,119,5.315789473684211
172516,4,0966012216,My daughter and I had absolutely no prior ballet knowledge.  This has helped us both understand the positions and the terminology.  I would definitely recommend this video with 101 to beginners.,1264550400,3,194,5.225806451612903
172517,4,0966012216,It's a good introductory ballet video especially for little girls.  The moves aren't too difficult and it is slow moving.,1255132800,2,121,5.05
172518,5,0966012216,"If you want to dance ballet by yourself, out side your studio or dancing class, this is the one. I love the warm up or bar work first, then have fun with some dancing steps.",1238025600,6,173,3.9714285714285715
172519,5,0966012216,This video easy to follow and provides top-notch Ballet instruction.  The whole production is very professional.  It shows you the correct way to execute each move without making anything too complicated to follow.  I recommend it!,1191196800,13,231,5.361111111111111

7793835,2,0966012216,"I have read the reviews and did not follow other people's suggestions. I regret. I believe that there is only one category of people who may somewhat benefit from this video, specifically parents who know nothing about ballet and have just decided to sign their kid up for an intro ballet class for the first time. Just one note: the teacher does not pay attention to the fact that kids-demonstrators do plie incorrectly, their knees do not track over their 2nd and 3nd toes, but they should. This may lead to injuries later on. I noticed that, in general, not many teachers bother to correct this. SO SAD!

If you are not in this category, please, do not buy it.
If you are a parent and want your kid to practice ballet in between class times, it is not sufficient and not engaging at all.
If you are a beginner ballet dancer, kid, teenager, or adult, you will not be satisfy with the amount of information and training in this video.
If you have more than 1 year of ballet experience (I am serious, just one year!), you will regret you bought it. It has neither enough dance and/or dance workout, nor variety of ballet elements to work on.
The saddest part is that Ballet 201 and 101 have minimal difference in content! Wouldn't you expect Ballet 201 to be just what you or your child needs? Crazy.

If you are looking for something to use at home to be better prepared for ballet classes, I highly recommend Ballet Boot Camp with Jessica Sherwood. I am an adult and I love it. I am not sure that small kids will like it, but older kids with 1-5 years of ballet experience will definitely benefit from that video. Not a waste of time.",1367798400,9,1636,4.413907284768212
