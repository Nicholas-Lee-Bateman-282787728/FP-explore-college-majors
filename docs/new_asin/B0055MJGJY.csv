8458474,5,B0055MJGJY,My kids at school love this and beg for the weather to be bad so we can stay inside and do this.  I wish I had a much bigger space because it really is fun for them.,1483056000,,165,3.4594594594594597

Its a great workout, its really fun, its not boring and the kids really get to use their imagination!  I'm serious, this is really cool!  My kids didn't even know they were working out because it is so fun.  The instructor is really great with engaging the kids and their imaginations.  I let the PE teachers know about it, too, and they are looking at how to use it as well.  The DVD is well produced and easy to follow and when it was over - I wanted more.... I have also now purchased PE Adventures: Journey to the Unknown Planet - and will report on that as well, but am excited because it is the same instructor, by the same producer, Christy Lane -who makes Excellent training videos! - and my kids loved this DVD!!!",1459123200,,842,4.23125
