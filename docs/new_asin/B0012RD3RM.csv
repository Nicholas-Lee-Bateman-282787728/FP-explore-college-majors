3095801,5,B0012RD3RM,"I have been enjoying Sunrise Earth on Animal Planet for several months now.  I have been so hoping they would put this on dvd so I could enjoy it without commercials.

Sunrise Earth has no narration and no music...the only sounds you hear are the natural sounds of the environment being filmed.  Yellowstone Geysers is my favorite in this set.  I often watch Sunrise Earth before bed and first thing in the morning to ease into the day.",1208390400,30,436,4.551282051282051

3095815,1,B0012RD3RM,"This product is not HD.  If you are anticipating having the crystal clear sunrise earth that you watched on Discovery HD, this isn't it.  Be warned that these images are Very Pixelated.  Many of the scenes (i.e. Balloon ride) would be better without sound.  If you want to sit back and relax, don't count on doing it for more than a few seconds before the Hot Air Balloon fires it's screechy flames at twice the volume of anything else on screen.  Amuch better selection for relaxation would be Zen Garden by Kuhlman.",1329436800,,517,4.576086956521739
3095816,5,B0012RD3RM,"This is what I remmember seeing on Animal Planet several years ago very, very early in tha morning. Don't expect music or a commentary.  It is all nature sounds of the actual sites. So relaxing. A mini vacation when you can't get away.",1309219200,,235,4.465116279069767
3095817,3,B0012RD3RM,"I purchased this item to provide a relaxing environment in a waiting room.  The videos, taken of different American sunrises, appear to have been shot with a fixed camera, over several minutes to capture the emerging dawn. At the beginning of the shots, it's rather dark, and in many of those, there is no wildlife movement, or they are so far away that it is like watching a still photograph for minutes.  Only natural sounds are recorded, which at times are very quiet; in a busy room it is not very readily heard.  The DVD is as advertised, (nice sunrises, nature sounds) just not quite what I was looking for.",1269043200,,613,4.554545454545455
3095818,5,B0012RD3RM,I use this product when I get up in the morning to relax and wake up as I make coffee and cook breakfast.  The visuals and sounds are about as close as you can get to waking up in the wilderness on a camping trip without actually being there (because your job is in the city and you actually live in an apartment).  This disc set is different from other nature shows/documentaries because there is no narration or music.  This lack of narration/music makes these discs perfect as a sort of background sound and background visual for relaxation.  I'm really glad I stumbled across this product and I highly reccomend it to others.,1268438400,3,629,4.539823008849558
3095819,3,B0012RD3RM,"First, you will obviously not have the same sharp HD Quality you currently enjoy watching this series on the HD Channel on your TV.  Regardless, it is still fun to relax and enjoy the scenery of each locale. I mostly watch these while stretching or doing yoga in my living room.  The funny thing was I had a really hard time watching them during the evening.  After all they are ""sunrises"".  I would have enjoyed more global sunrises like many that I have watched on the TV series.  As the title says ""American Sunrises"" so you don't get to witness more exotic locations which I have readily enjoyed since I travel very little.  I hope they come out with a more exotic location series (more even than the ""Beach Sunrise"" series currently available contains).",1265846400,3,758,4.619402985074627
3095820,5,B0012RD3RM,"I recently bought the Sunrise Earth DVD set to place in my Motor Home.  I travel a lot and wanted to be able to start my day still being able to watch the Sunrise Earth program.  My Motor Home doesn't have HD capabilities so I simply bought the DVD's and I am in business.

Great way to start out the morning with a quiet cup of coffee! I recommend the set of DVD's if you like to watch nature without lots of narrative.",1252886400,,420,4.036144578313253
3095821,5,B0012RD3RM,"This DVD is amazing. It's like art on your tv; breathing. Literally like sitting in a Wyoming meadow watching buffalo graze. No commentary, no music; simple, beautiful. Only the sound of animals, impressive camera shots (think planet earth series), vibrant colors and -I'm going to go ahead and say it- MAJESTIC sights of nature. Also: epiphany: what do you do with that giant tv on your wall during a party? Make it wall art. I have a tiny tv, and not blue ray or anything super fancy and you know I am going to rock this dvd during my party this weekend. That's because it hides the tv while at the same time shows it off. Just mute and add music and in a crowed room it might as well have a frame on it. I like this dvd so much that this is my first review on amazon.com.",1233014400,10,774,4.201342281879195

The reason I give this only four stars is some of the programs have very annoying parts which detract from the enjoyment.  For instance, the ""Vermont Balloons"" episode is a beautiful looking and sounding episode, until you are close-up and hear the blast of the heated air going into the balloon.  Also there are two other episode with scenic water views and nature sounds, until a boat rolls by.  I think they should have edited out those parts and kept it to just nature.

3095828,4,B0012RD3RM,I bought this as a gift for someone but I have seen this series before on the Discovery Channel.  I would get up at 3:30am during the early months with my twins.  I had to have some time to wake up and this was usually on when I would get up.  I couldn't have anything on that was too loud and the nature sounds just was so soothing.  I'd drink coffee--and not miss seeing the sunrises I used to see too much.  I saved one star because I think the hi-def version would be 5 stars!  Great gift for a nature lover that doesn't have the time to get to nature or maybe for some reason can't get to nature (like during the winter when you're trapped in the house with kids)  :-),1215648000,20,673,4.015037593984962

3095830,5,B0012RD3RM,"Imagine quietly eavesdropping on a foraging moose at a secluded lake in Maine or safely watching buffalo saunter by. And, I don't mean short, clipped sound bites or nature scenery impaled with insipid music and intrusive vocal narration. I'm talking about sights and sounds, the pure ambiance in extended footage where one is a lingering natural history voyeur, always with something dynamic happening.

The three discs each contain three different themes with each segment running some 50 minutes. Watching the subtle to dramatic antics of the geyser basin at Yellowstone brought back a lot of personal memories. The paint pots and fumaroles are blasting away--but admittedly without the stench of sulphur dioxide or the prevailing accompanying heat. That sequence doesn't feature the Old Faithful crowd pleaser but then again, it's all about seclusion, being off the beaten path. Only twice did I glimpse a vehicle fleetingly zoom by and these were buried in the background. Some 37 minutes into the geyser basin sequence there is a nice eruption of the Riverside geyser.

Two caveats: the sounds do not always match the image. For example, the camera angle on a buffalo or a moose may cut to a telephoto view or switch for a few minutes to show you something else in the landscape's context and the sound doesn't necessarily follow it. However, its apparent the ambient sounds are authentic for the scenery featured and upon each viewing I seem to pick up more subtle detail. Secondly, there are occasional text insertions identifying a particular scene and time but these I don't find too terribly distracting.

You know how easy it is to come home from work rather exhausted, mindlessly turn on the tube and the next thing you know the evening's gone? Viewing just one segment of a given disc instead refreshes me so much I'm usually recharged enough after to take on more projects in the evenings. And, with gas prices being what they are at present, this is an excellent alternative to savor nature until you can afford to visit some of these locales. No need for suncreen or mosquito repellant!

I hope they issue more in the series. They're priceless reminders of how little nature is appreciated and yet how much nature has to offer.",1213660800,10,2243,4.925925925925926
3095831,5,B0012RD3RM,"This is a set of 3 DVDs, each with 3 high-quality, relaxing 52 minute videos.  Each video is of one general location (but with several different views of that location) starting before sunrise and continuing until the day has gotten started.

The locations are widely varied, such as near the ocean, in Yellowstone national park, the New England countryside, and several coastal areas.  City views?  Forget it.  These videos are all very much out in nature.  Not the view out your own windows, or even from the windows of a vacation cabin.

Sometimes the videos include wildlife.  Always lots of relaxing natural sounds too.  These are great peaceful videos for those of us who rise later in the morning and don't get out away from town often enough.  There are occasional small and unnecessary subtitles to help you figure out what is happening.  They do not detract from these very nice videos.",1212364800,66,896,4.828947368421052

That sequence doesn't feature the Old Faithful crowd pleaser but then again, it's all about seclusion, being off the beaten path. Only twice did I glimpse a vehicle fleetingly zoom by and these were buried in the background. Some 37 minutes into the geyser basin sequence there is a nice eruption of the Riverside geyser.

Two caveats: the sounds do not always match the image. For example, the camera angle on a buffalo or a moose may cut to a telephoto view or switch for a few minutes to show you something else in the landscape's context and the sound doesn't necessarily follow it. However, its apparent the ambient sounds are authentic for the scenery featured and upon each viewing I seem to pick up more subtle detail. Secondly, there are occasional text insertions identifying a particular scene and time but these I don't find too terribly distracting.

You know how easy it is to come home from work rather exhausted, mindlessly turn on the tube and the next thing you know the evening's gone? Viewing just one segment of a given disc instead refreshes me so much I'm usually recharged enough after to take on more projects in the evenings. And, with gas prices being what they are at present, this is an excellent alternative to savor nature until you can afford to visit some of these locales. No need for suncreen or mosquito repellant!

I hope they issue more in the series. They're priceless reminders of how little nature is appreciated and yet how much nature has to offer.",1213660800,10,2243,4.925925925925926
3330328,5,B0012RD3RM,"This is a set of 3 DVDs, each with 3 high-quality, relaxing 52 minute videos.  Each video is of one general location (but with several different views of that location) starting before sunrise and continuing until the day has gotten started.

The locations are widely varied, such as near the ocean, in Yellowstone national park, the New England countryside, and several coastal areas.  City views?  Forget it.  These videos are all very much out in nature.  Not the view out your own windows, or even from the windows of a vacation cabin.

Sometimes the videos include wildlife.  Always lots of relaxing natural sounds too.  These are great peaceful videos for those of us who rise later in the morning and don't get out away from town often enough.  There are occasional small and unnecessary subtitles to help you figure out what is happening.  They do not detract from these very nice videos.",1212364800,66,896,4.828947368421052

8247378,2,B0012RD3RM,"I was trying to watch a particular Sunrise Earth.  There was not enough information on exactly what episodes were on these discs.  Sure enough, my favourite of all time, ""Maine Fishing Village"", was not on the tapes, and I can't find it on you-tube either.  Very disappointing.  I only like maybe two episodes on these tapes.  Why is Discovery hiding all the episodes now?",1484265600,5,372,4.75
