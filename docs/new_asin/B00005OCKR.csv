1641003,5,B00005OCKR,"This story of thumbs based off of the original Star Wars trilogy is one of the funniest adaptations in a long time.  Steve Oedekerk touches on things that we all have felt while watching the first three, but were never able to voice our opinions on.  Main point, letting everyone know just how much of a whiny little girl Luke was.  Also with the comment brought up about the ""British accents in outer space when there is no Britain.""  Brilliant.  I remember seeing this on UPN when it first came out and I am completely psyched that is coming out on DVD now.  Pre-Order now, and enjoy.",1002240000,3,586,4.429906542056075

1641011,5,B00005OCKR,"I love this movie!  I like Batthumb and Frankenthumb better, but this is great, too! It's campy, ridiculous, hilarious and absurd. It mocks the bad parts of Star Wars, which needed to be done. If Weird Al made movies, this would be how they'd be. My favorite bit of dialog is:
Loke Groundrunner: Ooby Doob Benooby?  What is your middle name?
Benoobie: Scooby Dooby
Loke: Ooby Doob Scooby Dooby Benooby?!

1641013,4,B00005OCKR,"This was a hillarious spoof and I have watched it several times.  All of the kids (ages 5-16) have enjoyed it as well.  If you like silly, then this is a must have!",1257292800,,164,3.9393939393939394

1641015,5,B00005OCKR,"very funny, follows the movie to a T.  has one scene where they're looking up princess bun's dress, but other than that pretty clean.  i can't recall the language but if there is some, it's not much.",1241740800,,199,4.351351351351352
1641016,5,B00005OCKR,"Steve Oedekerk went all out for his first Thumb filmette, as Thumb Wars features thumbation on an epic scale.  In the end, Oedekerk somehow managed to condense the whole Stars War story into less than thirty minutes of incredible animation and humorous dialogue.  As a parody, it necessarily makes fun of some of the weaker elements in the Star Wars saga, but I can't imagine even the most die-hard Star Wars groupie not being able to enjoy the heck out of watching Thumb Wars.  I don't know how they do the animation, but these thumbs are true characters capable of some great facial expressions.  The whole light saber thing doesn't work that well, but some great CGI animation makes all of the space shots look great, especially the battle scenes, and the assembly of appendages hanging out at the alien cantina is not to be missed.

The gang's all here in this one, as Loke Groundrunner leaves his home planet in the company of Oobedoob Benubi and the effeminate droids Prissypeo and Beboobeep to join the Thumbellion.  With the help of Hand Duet and Crunchy, our do-gooders manage to rescue Princess Bunhead from the evil clutches of Black Helmet Man and launch an attack on the gigantic, planet-spinning power of the Death Nail.  Can they take advantage of the Self Destruct button placed all so conveniently on the Death Nail, or are Loke and his buddies doomed to fail against the might of the Thumbpire?  And just what is the secret connection between Loke and Black Helmet Man?  It's not necessarily what you think.

Admittedly, I found&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Thumb/dp/B00005TNF1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Thumb</a>, the follow-up to this original Thumbation film release, to be funnier than Thumb Wars, but I can still recommend this short, twenty-eight minute filmette to anyone - including my fellow Star Wars fans.  You'll be amazed that anyone took such a stupid idea and carried it as far as Steve Oedekerk did - but even that's nothing compared to what he actually accomplished in the end.  It doesn't get much weirder than Thumb Wars - but it doesn't get much funnier, either.",1239580800,,2167,5.090395480225989
1641017,5,B00005OCKR,"If you're any fan of the originals, you're going to love this version.  A must have for your DVD collection.

I just hope they come out with sequels",1139097600,,148,4.25
1641018,4,B00005OCKR,"I haven't watched the video enough times to catch all the nuances.  Also, I have never seen the original Star Wars movies, but have heard enough about them to know who the characters and some of the situations are.  So, this is my introduction to it all.",1129161600,,254,4.382978723404255
1641019,5,B00005OCKR,This movie is full of really excellent one-liners and bizarre behavior.  I highly recommend this movie to those who enjoy a good parody.,1125964800,,136,4.913043478260869
1641020,4,B00005OCKR,"A funny send-up of the star wars movies with thumbactors! The best of the Thumbs movies. Some of these movies tend to be painfully unfunny, but this one and Thumbtanic are quite good.",1111449600,2,183,4.575757575757576
1641021,5,B00005OCKR,"All the thumb movies are hilarious, with half the humor coming from how the thumbs look like. Thumb Wars is special because it was the first Thumb feature, and has the intro from Steve Oedekerk and the character with the ""Most ridiculous name in the universe."" Be sure to either rent it or buy it with Thumbtanic, because the feature is only 29 minutes long.

I also highly recommend Mel Brooks' Spaceballs for other Star Wars fans.",1098576000,2,432,4.6103896103896105
1641022,5,B00005OCKR,"I can't tell you how funny the entire Thumb series is.  I had originally rented the double feature DVD ThumbWars/Thumbtanic at Blockbuster with my then 9 yr old son. I laughed so hard that I almost pee'd my pants!!! We were at Best Buys shortly thereafter, saw the entire boxed set and bought it on the spot. Steve Oedekerk is one funny guy!

ThumbWars - The Phantom Cuticle was originally released as simply Thumb Wars. It is a parady of the orginal Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back movies. And an extremely GOOD parody at that - far superior to Mel Brooks' boring SpaceBalls.  Apparently with all the hype and hoopla that surounded the release of Episode I - The Phantom Menace, Steve Oedekerk decided to cash in and re-released Thumb Wars as 'The Phantom Cuticle.""  Be advised ... if you purchase the box set of Thumb movies you will already get this movie as it was originally titled.

If you are in need of a good hard belly laugh, pick up ANY of the Thumb movies and prepare to be running back and forth to the bathroom!!!!  May the Tumb be with yooooooou..............",1095897600,13,1076,4.520618556701031

1641024,5,B00005OCKR,"This movie is better then ""STAR WARS"", but don't get me wrong Star Wars are awesome movies, but this movie is better. Now you may be thinking (thumbs) you've got to be kidding me I won't watch any bit of this movie what so ever, surprisingly you do. ""THUMB WARS"" has it all state of the art special effects, great music, funny characters, action, good thumb acting, and Thumb savers. In this movie you will find that you will laugh your head off in less then five minutes of the movie, after that doctors will have to stun you with a tazzer to make you stop laughing. After the movie you will want more so I sagest other Thumb movies there's a total of six. So enjoy, we know we will.",1058486400,,684,4.229007633587786

1641026,3,B00005OCKR,"Being a huge fan of ""Kung Pow!: Enter the Fist"" (the funniest movie ever made), I just had to see one of these Thumbation movies. I ordered it from Amazon and watched it as soon as it arrived. I was disappointed, needless to say...
Why didn't I laugh as much as I wanted to? Because I'm not a Star Wars fanatic? I don't know. But this film didn't crack me up too much. The only few things that did were Chewy's facial expressions and everything about Yoda's ""hand-puppetry"". Also, the character profiles are pretty hilarious as well.
Even though this lacked the hilarity I found in Kung Pow!, I'll still check some more Thumbation movies, and keep hoping I'll get something as good...",1042934400,,684,4.569105691056911
1641027,5,B00005OCKR,"I must say, this is quite a funny movie they got here. My friend for Christmas got this movie. At first I found this movie corny and just dumb until it got to the Yoda part. I have seen that part alone more than 20 times and I haven't even got a copy for myself yet. I usually find movies making fun of Star Wars disgusting because Star Wars is the best, but just seeing Yoda talking about himself being a puppet and seeing him with a fishing pole with a piniata on the end electrocuting Loke was enough to say it is worth seeing a hundred times over!",1041811200,,551,4.064220183486238
1641028,5,B00005OCKR,"If you like science fiction spoofs, this show is for you.  Anyone mildly familier with the original Star Wars will love the whiney Loke Groundrunner and his new friends as they battle Black Helmet Man and the Bad bad, good, bad thumpire.  This movie has more silliness than most small countries, but it is a must see in my book.",1039392000,2,328,4.45
1641029,5,B00005OCKR,"If thumbs ever went into battle, it'd be called ""Thumb Wars"". An ultra-silly spoof of ""Star Wars  complete with quality SFX.

You'll love how the names were mangled...You especially love Hands Duet's explanation of himself in the cantina.",1037836800,,347,5.087719298245614
1641030,5,B00005OCKR,"Not just another ""Star Wars"" parody, this is a very clever, ultra-hilarious takeoff that bears repeated viewing. Slim on the bonus features, but such is easily overlooked when the main feature is so good. This is the best of Steve Oedekerk's ""Thumb"" movies, but check out ""Blair Thumb"", ""Thumbtanic"", and ""Bat Thumb"" (and soon ""Frankenthumb"") for more hilarity.",1032307200,,361,5.241379310344827
1641031,5,B00005OCKR,"I must admit, I was a little weary about spending [money] on this DVD, but after I watched it I was glad I forked out the dough.  The nicknames and other plays on words in this flick really tickled my funny bone.  Chewbaka has got to be the ugliest, yet funniest caracter in the movie.  Do yourself a favor and give yourself a good laugh, buy this DVD!",1032048000,,352,4.147058823529412

1641033,5,B00005OCKR,"Well, Steve Oedekerk does it again. With his whitty Thumb Theater productions, I'd have to say this is the best one. I loved his choice of names too. ""Loke Groundrunner""(Luke Skywalker), ""Princess Bunhead""(Princess Leia), ""Hand Duet""(Han Solo), ""Black Helmet Man""(Darth Vader), Prissype(C-3PO), ""Beeboopbeep""(R2-D2), and ""Crunchie""(Chewie), great names Steve! The ""nail side of the thumb"" was with Steve when I created this one. I especially liked ""Oobedoob Scooby Dooby Benubi"", he was great. BUY this movie, you will laugh for HOURS!

1641034,5,B00005OCKR,"Of all the Steve Oedekerk ""Thumb filmettes"" Thumb Wars has got to be the classic. Making pop shots at every star wars fan, making fun of even Yoda a.k.a. Puppet. Steve Oedekerk gives the non-crazed Star Wars fans something to laugh at.

1641036,5,B00005OCKR,"This is absolutely the funniest video I have seen in ages!  Hysterical,  clever,  with great attention to detail, Steve Oedekerk(Director:  Nothing to Lose and the abominable Kung Pow!) has created a mini-film that anyone from a Star Wars geek to a Jar jar Binks fan can enjoy.(I would have just said a novice,  but anyone who likes Jar jar Binks is below a Star Wars novice.)  It follows the simple structure that made Star Wars IV so great,  and then borrows from Empire and Jedi to make the story even funnier.  Its difficult to explain only because there are never truly any actors per se,  just their eyes and mouths,  which is funny in itself.  My personal favorite scenes are the introduction of Ooby Doob Banoobi(I have the silliest name in the galaxy),  the classic scene with the unwise commander(Why don't you gather some frogs legs and eyes of newt?),  and then the british accents joke,  girlie giggles,  and the slo-motion scene of everybody's reaction when Ooby gets it.  TOUCHDOWN!  Oh yeah,  and the puppet scene.  That is awesome!  (Beneath the floor,  the man does control me,  yeeesss.)  If you love Thumb Wars,  I'm sure you'll like ThumbTitanic.  I admit I didn't love it as much as Thumb Wars,  but its definitely worth the look,  and it does have some funny scenes.  Thumb Wars Rocks!  May the Thumb be with you!",1024185600,,1336,4.662337662337662
1641037,5,B00005OCKR,"Funny, short and good for the soul!  Everybody from old grandpa to the baby will enjoy these one.  Space battles, backstabbing robots, princess armed with a sword, a whining hero, a babbling wiseman and girlie giggles.  Yes, that's right, girlie giggles!  Plus a puppet, touching tongues, silly lines and lots of gun fights.  What more can you ask for?

ThumbWars will definately get a belly laugh out of you.  One MUST be familiar with the star wars movie series.. if you're not, you simply won't get it.  The thumb that plays Chewy's role (named Crunchy) is by far my favorite character.. His disturbing mouth and sharp black nail along with his growling n such are just too perfect.  As far as parodies go, this is simply the best sci-fi one I've ever seen..
