5322469,4,B009ERK2UI,"This was a great TV show, and the presentation of the episodes is splendid.  So great to have them all together like this.  I had to take away one star, though, for the horrible box cover!  Not only are the people depicted on the front of the package not from the show, there's not even anyone like that in the show!  I would have deducted more stars from the review just for that awful artwork, but the show itself deserves 5 stars.  And it sure deserves a better cover picture!",1358985600,2,479,4.277777777777778
5322470,5,B009ERK2UI,"This series is a big surprise in a little package. I LOVE this series. Good, wholesome entertainment!! I don't feel like I need a shower, OR therapy when I watch several back to back episodes, and like a good book, it's hard to wait until tomorrow to see what will happen next. Well written- superbly acted- love the characters. A great value in entertainment for the awesome price of $12.99!!!! Over 29 hours of episodes!!!!",1358208000,29,425,4.68
5322471,5,B009ERK2UI,"The DVD's are great. The cover art could be better, but this is the only complete set I know of.",1356998400,2,96,3.85
5322472,5,B009ERK2UI,"Video quality might not be the best, but this show is so addictive. It is the original Family Channel series and I have been enjoying watching Season 2 finally after so many years, not having even a VHS copy from the original run dates. I would have liked to have seen the packaging separate the discs instead of stacking them all together, but for the price, you can't beat it. Don't let the jacket cover fool you (it's not the original actors on the jacket), this is the original series, worth the money. All the episodes from all 3 seasons are in the set.
There was one review commenting on the audio on the set, I have found no issues with the set, normal volume levels. The only negative comment, if it is one, is that the episodes are numbered and not named on the disc menus. If you know which episode you are looking for, you have to review the jacket cover to see which number it is.",1356998400,51,892,4.284023668639053
5322473,4,B009ERK2UI,"This half hour series originally ran on CBN (The Family Channel) from 1989 until 1991. It was filmed on a tight budget in British Columbia and had a mostly Canadian cast and crew. It's unlikely that U.S. viewers will be familiar with most of the actors, including the leads (Richard Comar, John H. Brennan, and Sophie Barjac). Still, it's well-acted, and the stories are interesting. There's a lack of pretension about the series that makes it refreshing when compared to many other modern-day Westerns...Since it was made for a network that was owned by Pat Robertson, there's no swearing or sex, but there is a surprising amount of violence. In fact, it reminds me of ""Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman"" with the violence amped up. (One of the main characters is a beautiful female doctor.)...Maybe it seems like a strange comparison, but it also reminds me (on a superficial level) of HBO's ""Deadwood"" (which contained plenty of swearing, sex, and violence). For example, the primary setting is a very muddy frontier town; there's a large cast of recurring characters; and there's as much emphasis on character as on action. However, as I said, ""Bordertown"" lacks pretension. It's hard to get into much depth in 23 minutes and on a low budget, so its storytelling scope is more narrow than ""Dr. Quinn"" or ""Deadwood."" But there's something very likeable about how the series sets its modest goals and fulfills them...As for the DVD's, you couldn't ask for a better price ($12.95 for 78 episodes). There are 13 episodes on each of the six disks. All six disks are on one spindle in an oversized case. The episode titles are listed on the back of the DVD set, but there are no air dates or episode descriptions included. Considering the number of episodes that are packed onto each disk, the picture and sound quality are excellent, but there are no subtitles or closed captioning.",1356048000,153,1873,4.838006230529595
5322474,5,B009ERK2UI,"Been waiting for several years for the complete series release - this appears to be it.  Was initially concerned with the jacket cover, as those artists on the cover were not in the original series, but all turned out good.  This is the original series that aired in the early 90s on CBN (Christian Broadcasting Network?).  Have already watched the first of six DVDs which relates to Season 1, Episodes 1-13.  The discs are set up in this order, with the next disc being Season 1, Episodes 14-26 followed by Season 2, Episodes 1-13, etc for a total of 78 episodes, much improved over the last-best offering of only 28 select episodes.  Video and sound quality are very good, appropriate for the video technology of that era.  Menu options are simple - either select by episode or play all.",1355616000,51,789,4.640287769784172

5322518,3,B009ERK2UI,"A morally clean show which is a very welcome change to the garbage on TV nowadays.
Over-all, I would say it is a very average production.
Sometimes actors get blamed for bad acting when it's really the writing, editing or poor choices in background music.
One thing for sure.... the opening music theme really sucks!
A far cry from opening themes like ""Hawaii Five O"", ""S.W.A.T."" or ""JAG""!",1453680000,,389,4.735294117647059

5322522,3,B009ERK2UI,"I bought this series ""blind"". I had never heard of it before seeing it here on Amazon. However the price was right to try something new and as a fan of westerns it seemed worth taking a chance on given that the Family Channel was associated with it. Twice I tried to start at the beginning and tried to ""get into it"".  I was ready to pan it outright. However, with so many glowing reviews I tried again, this time starting in on a later disc and stuck with it to the end to see what I was missing. Overall, I did not really care for it. It was okay at best. I never warmed up to the characters particularly the US Sheriff.  There seemed to be too much conflict between the two main characters to really make me like either of them. For a more modern interpretation of a western it was a breath of fresh air as there is an absence of sleaze, a positive point to be sure. Some people will no doubt enjoy this series, I just wasn't one of them.",1451520000,,941,4.081081081081081
5322523,5,B009ERK2UI,"Wasn't sure when it first started- It seemed a little lame.  But after everyone got comfortable in their roles, and the kinks worked out,  it really turned out to be a great show.  Very good storylines, very heartfelt, beautiful scenery and some history lessons thrown in.  Enjoyed this very much and recommend it to anyone that just wants to kick back and enjoy good old fashioned, innocent, tv... very hard to come by these days!",1451260800,,431,4.706666666666667

Short episodes with hokey story lines and over acted One thing I'm kind of hard on is the props need to use real antigue Period Pieces for their props.

Gotta love it!  My wife & I do.

5322543,1,B009ERK2UI,"Don't be fooled by this one!

The top of both DVD Case Covers of BorderTown has the following words printed:

""Fans of Dr Quinn Medicine Woman Will Love This Series"" -- that's an outright LIE!!!

I hated this BorderTown western from the very first episode and every episode after it. In fact I only watched
about 3 hours of the 20 hour Seasons 1 & 2 before I couldn't take it anymore. Never looked at Season 3.

Doesn't even come close to Dr Quinn by a zillion miles!! Dr Quinn is hands down one of the best Western Series I've come across besides others like Lonesome Dove 1 & 2 and the other mini series Centennial (both absolutely fantasic and riveting). And lets not forget Bonanza - another great western show. Wish Amazon sold the complete Bonanza series which was around 400 episodes. Oh yeah and the Big Valley -- and there are others too. But BorderTown? No way - it left me feeling empty. Could NOT get emotionally involved. In other words, I didn't feel any comrodary with any of the characters.

Trust me - don't waste your money on BorderTown. Watching it - I didn't feel any kinship with the characters like I did with Dr Quinn or other western mini series mentioned. Watching Dr Quinn you feel as if you actually know the people - you become one with them - same for Lonesome Dove and Centennial and others.

Comparing BorderTown to Dr Quinn is like comparing a German Shepherd to a Chihuahua. There's no contest as to who would come out on top.",1435968000,2,1460,4.449438202247191

Short but poignant 30 minute episodes (6 hours worth) where three good friends resist temptation to love so as not to leave one of them lonely. Its entertaining and educational in the kinds of crime, and the ploys of the criminals where the U.S. Marshall with the Royal Canadian Mountie keep you riding after them across the rocky plains under those high Canadian Rockies. I enjoyed the comaraderie and everyone's unique story. Good restoration.  Sit up and ride. Excellent orchestration of lively saloon tunes. No skirts above the ankles and men bathe in their long underwear! Bat Masterson makes several appearances dressed to kill with a wit as fast as his double drawing pistols. Family fun.",1400716800,,819,4.85

I just couldn't lay it down and I wached the whole series in a matter of less then a week it was so good.  The only thing that I didn't like about the series is I wished each episode was an hour ea. instead of 30 mins. and the quality of the color and sound was as good as we get today.  I was going to resale it, but I have decided to hold on to it and down the road will re-watch it again it was that good.  I just loved it.....,............

I'm sure this show wasn't very popular back then, because I don't remember it being advertised that often to promote it. I didn't get to see all the episodes when it was on TV so thats why I purchased it on DVD. I'm glad I did. When there is nothing good on TV, I'll plop this in the DVD player. I think the shows story lines are good an creative. If you live Westerns , go ahead and give this show a try, I'll bet you'll like it.",1394755200,2,599,3.838709677419355
5322625,5,B009ERK2UI,Bordertown is a great western tv show that ran three years with characters that grow on you. Good humor and lots of action.,1394409600,,123,4.391304347826087
5322626,5,B009ERK2UI,"Bordertown is a show that was made before the internet existed. It is about a town on the US / Canadian border that has a lawman from each of the Countries operating with euqal authority.

On the US side is Marshall James Craddock, a rough hewn, stand-up, no-nonsense, fearless and imposing legend who is not afraid to throw away the lawbooks in pursuit of whats right...

On the Canadian side is Corporal Clive Bennet, a tea-toatlin', jelly-spined, stuffed shirt, politically correct by-the-book sorta guy.

The chemistry between them is excellent and makes for some very interesting stories.

I would definitely rate this show with 5 stars, however, I give this product only 4 stars. The quality of the DvD's are pretty good considering that I am watching these shows on todays technology. The problem is that on each disk there is an episode that locks up whatever device I am watching it on. I have tried them on my PC/DvD/ Xbox 360 and 2 DvD players it always happens at the same point in the same episode.... There are no diret or scratches on the DvD's so I have to think the problem is with the data...

Even with the frustration the lock-up causes I am happy with this purchase. 10$ for 30 hours of quality television that won't make you stupid to watch is a great bargain.

I would feel very differently about the whole situation if this was a 30$ set.... but it isn't, so 4 stars :)

EDIT: Amazon gave me a refund on this because of the messed up disc. I am going to re-order the set and hopefully I will have no issues....

I am upping my rating to 5. It's true I had some hassle, but, this show is soooooooooo good, and 10$ for the series is an amazing value....

....if you like Westerns you will love this show... It is really that good... I love watching Jack clown that silly ""Oatmeal Savage"" of a mountie lol!",1393372800,5,1827,4.4624624624624625

5322644,4,B009ERK2UI,"When this series originally ran on the old CBN ....now known as the FAMILY CHANNEL....I taped every episode on VHS tapes.
I still have those tapes...but I bought the DVD's anyway because it is much easier to watch the disks.  The series ran from 1988-1990 (3 seasons).  It may have had a limited budget....but it had many good character actors, writers, and directors.  One of the guests from season 1 is Denny (Scott) Miller of Wagon Train.  Ben Vereen appears in a later episode.  This series could not have been easy to film as it seems to be raining, snowing, or cold much of the time (at least in the early episodes)...and mud seems to be a permanent ingredient of the landscape.  What I liked most about the series was the interaction between the 3 main characters...and just like EMERGENCY and LARAMIE, there is a strong bond between the two male stars.  The friendship between the Marshal and the Mountie makes for good story-telling...sometimes funny, and sometimes not!  Was it a perfect series...No!  But it was entertaining.  Morals and values counted...but there were plenty of villains, shoot-outs, hold-ups, romance, conflicts,....name it, and it was there.  And there were social issues:  race, slavery, immoral behavior, etc.  What we want is to be entertained, and we are!  The episodes are only about 25 minutes long (it was a half-hour show).  There is some continuity from episode to episode, but basically it is a new story each time. I recommend it.  By the way, the cover of the collective tin has been redesigned....it shows the actual actors on the front.  I guess they got the message that the cover should reflect those actually in the show.",1380326400,2,1669,4.840989399293286

5322658,3,B009ERK2UI,"I definitely liked the show when it was on TV, but the packaging and quality is not so hot.  The six disks are on a single spindle which is probably the reason of the first four episodes I watched, two stalled and could not be played.",1368576000,2,234,4.086956521739131
5322659,3,B009ERK2UI,"The case was damaged upon receiving the item. The little things that hold the discs in the case were broken, but the discs inside were not damaged and played without flaw. Happy with the series, but dissapointed in the case issue.",1368489600,,230,4.634146341463414

5322663,5,B009ERK2UI,This show was unique and actually pretty funny unfortunately it didn't have a very long run and the complete series is hard to find perhaps those lucky enough to own it intend to hold on I know I will,1366329600,,200,4.153846153846154
5322664,3,B009ERK2UI,"I first saw ""Bordertown"" a little over a yer ago when the ""Best Of"" DVD set was released in Canada.  It turned out to be a wonderful, clean show.  And Disc 1 had an average bit rating of 7.5 to 8.5 Mbps, while discs 2-4 had an average of 4.5-4.9.

I just received the Complete series today.  Boy, has Echo Bridge ever done a poor job on this set.  First off, Episode 2 ""Medicine Woman"", while it's complete on the ""Best Of"" set, on this set the episode is missing its teaser and title sequence, which set up the whole plot.  Plus can you ever see the pixels crawl on screen(there was one shot where Marie was wearing a grey hat and the pixels were very visible), since the bit rate on this disc tops out at 3.6Mbps, with the average being right around 2.5-2.7Mbps.  So while there are issues with the video source, this set needed to have been put on 12 discs, instead of 6, for ultimate quality.",1363824000,27,896,4.235294117647059
5322665,4,B009ERK2UI,I really like this tv show. I enjoy the old west and shows about them. I really like this one because it is very clean and the characters are very enjoyable. It is worth the watch.,1363478400,3,180,4.027777777777778

5322667,5,B009ERK2UI,I was very to obtain the entire BORDERTOWN series. I consider it one of the best western series. Also the service was excellent as I received it in a timely fashion.,1362873600,,165,4.354838709677419
5322668,5,B009ERK2UI,I remember watching the series on tv which I hardly missed. Most of the movies took place in Bordertown but it was still worth watching.,1361664000,,136,4.48
5322669,1,B009ERK2UI,"Generic! Westerns stopped being worth a chit after the 50's. I guess this is all the dope opera generation has to choose from,
Too bad
I guess we are all stuck with Hawaii-50 and all the copy crap generation KNOWS how to make.

5322671,4,B009ERK2UI,"This series is easily over looked and underappreciated by western lovers. I enjoyed its stunning and raw Canadian location, and the unique handling  and interpretation of American/Canadian law in the old west. The love triangle between the Canadian Monte, the American marshall and the Canadian (female) doctor is refreshing, and intertaining. Great buy for the price.",1360713600,18,368,5.571428571428571

5322673,4,B009ERK2UI,Very good . my holding off on five stars is the lack of closed captioned which is more than beneficial to us hearing deficiants. Its essential. But the volume control on Tvs make it worthwhilke viewing.,1359936000,3,202,4.638888888888889
5322674,4,B009ERK2UI,"I liked the originality of the series profiling a Mountie and a Marshall in the same
office, with humour, warmth and drama, combined with lots of shooting.
The characters are well portrayed...NWMP as stuffed shirts(Rah..ther Brit
you know), Marshall as one who bathes infrequent and then in his long johns.
Supporting cast are colourful..German Doctor is just enough romance(like
Miss Kitty in Gunsmoke). Old buildings look real, but the real northwest would
have had teams of oxen and oxcarts etc..I will enjoy for years to come
sans commercials.",1359676800,2,547,5.2272727272727275
