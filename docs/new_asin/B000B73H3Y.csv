8082809,3,B000B73H3Y,"A little bit too oriented on the teacher and his teachings, rather than the practice of tai chi.  Also, a lot of his or his school's personal moves rather than the standard ones, which were what I was looking for.",1424736000,,213,4.325
8082810,5,B000B73H3Y,"John P. Milton's Qi Gong DVDs are one of the best healing tools available to people of all ages and health conditions.  This DVD on Longevity is one of three DVDs he has produced on Qi Gong for long life.  Each DVD presents clear and comprehensive ways for healing the body, mind and spirit.  The field cards (which are included with the videos) support your practice, indoors or outside, regardless of your starting level.  There is also specific information on how the postures and movements support the various organ systems of the body.  I have used these exercises to improve the quality of my own life, and so can you.",1237766400,,624,4.636363636363637
8082811,5,B000B73H3Y,"John Milton is a master practitioner.  His life long devotion to the healing aspects of qi gong is powerfully transmitted through this DVD.  His instruction is clear, his presentation is deliberate and his gentle style invites both beginners and experts to gain valuable insights to enhance and deepen their practice.",1237593600,3,317,5.32
8082812,5,B000B73H3Y,"This presentation captures the foundations of Qi Gong practice that are essential if one wishes to reap the many benefits offered.  John Milton's teaching style is clear and direct.  I highly recommend this for both those new to T'ai chi and long-time practitioners who desire gentle reminders of the basic teachings.  As in the cultivation of ""beginner's mind,"" practicing these foundations helped me realign and vitalize my own practice.  Many thanks Grandfather!",1227398400,5,465,5.416666666666667
8082813,5,B000B73H3Y,"I have seen many Tai Chi and Qigong DVDs and John P. Milton's 3-disk series is one of the absolute best available today! The exercises on ""Cultivate Longevity"" are fun to learn.  I especially enjoy the ""bear"" exercises because they are so easy to learn and you feel the energetic results immediately. I think it's wonderful that each movement is explained well so that you know exactly how and why to do the exercises.  Once you learn the exercises from the DVD, you can then take the included laminated cards with you to do your practice anywhere. I recommend these disks for everyone from beginners to advanced students.",1214006400,7,622,4.75
8082814,4,B000B73H3Y,"I own serveral Qi Gong dvds & taken Tai Chi at my massage college in NY.

Mr. Milton definitely knows his stuff, what he narrates could fit into a decent size book. This video is done outside with lovely scenery with two students, one male & one female in simple cotton shirts/pants.

He speaks very relaxed & takes his time. He tells you everything you need to know before & during the exercises so you do end up doing them about 5x to 100x depending on how fast it takes to do it until he finishes his explainations. He also keeps doing it even after while there is silence.

I tend to get bored or give up easily so it took me a couple viewings to get through it since there was so much good information.

The distributer is soundstrue which on their site has a short video of the dvd.

This is from soundstrue:

  * Smiling Energy practice for infusing positive, affirming emotions into every cell of your body

  * Crane Massages-ideal for clearing stagnant energy from your abdominal organs

  * Four Bears Practice-an easy-to-learn exercise related to t'ai chi, which provides the same benefits of physical fitness, prevention of illness, and a deep connection with the earth

  * Posture of the Tao-combining classic meditation and qi gong energy practice for mental clarity and presence",1147651200,10,1295,4.65929203539823
