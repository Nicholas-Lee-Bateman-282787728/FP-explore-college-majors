6295552,4,B00ITAQ2MS,"It is good to finally have Transformers Animated in it's entirety on DVD. The encodes are as good as broadcast and in widescreen presentation which makes them well worth watching again.

The only reason that the set gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the extras. The Beast Wars complete set had interviews, commentaries and even a copy of the Botcon comic set just before the series. This set does not even appear to have the shorts made along with the series or the Botcon comic. Since this series had such a devout following like Beast Wars it is disappointing that only the episodes are there and not even the commentaries advertised on the DVD sleeve.

If you want the whole series in one go then this is good, but if you want extras, you might want to buy the individual releases.",1405209600,,790,4.479166666666667
6295553,5,B00ITAQ2MS,"One of the best Transformers series to date.  Lots of love went into this series.  The stories can seem kind of ""kiddy"" at times, but towards the end of each season, things really pick up.",1405209600,2,188,4.3428571428571425
6295554,5,B00ITAQ2MS,"All 42 episodes of this terrific (and tragically short) series which was intended for a younger audience than Transformers Prime.  No extras are included with this release, however since I did not buy this as a collectors item the lack of extras did not matter.",1404086400,3,261,4.8
6295555,5,B00ITAQ2MS,"This was one of the Transformer series' that I failed to watch as it was not in a time when I could easily watch it, so I was excited to be able watch it and catch up/ The animation on this series was a bit different than in other series, but it was just as much fun to watch! I loved the storyline and ploy and I can easily see after watching this that any transformers fan would love to see this too. All-in-all this gives hours of watching fun and you WILL want to come back for more!

6295556,4,B00ITAQ2MS,"To start off, I LOVE this show. But this product is only the episodes. There are no extras. I can't even find the ""audio commentary"" extras described on the DVD case. The other DVDs released in the past containing only one season had photo galleries, the TFA shorts, and more. This DVD is only a collection of all 42 episodes. That is it. If you've already bought the other two seasons (season 3 wasn't released until this year), then just buy season 3. You'd waste your money on this. But, if you haven't bought any of the Transformers Animated series yet and you don't mind the missing extras, this would be a good deal.",1403740800,,622,4.464912280701754
6295557,5,B00ITAQ2MS,"Transformers Animated is one of the best transformers series to come out in the last ten years. Some would disagree with me I know but in my own opinion Animated did everything a transformers series needs to and did it well beyond what previous attempts had done. The previous 4 series before it were produced for Japan first before airing in an english dubbing. This time the reverse occured. And it helped immensely by focusing on a more kid friendly and entertaining aspects other than the Autobot vs. Decepticon dynamic.

Animation is primarily a higher quality Flash animation where the character models were produced by lead designer Derrick J Wyatt (Ben 10: Omniverse, Scooby Doo Mystery Incorporated). Many of the characters are of an angular yet fluid design. It may be a show about Giant metal robots but the animation likes to treat them as a cartoon in the right amount of bending of the characters and environment. That is most likely either it's greatest strength or weakness depending on your tastes.

The show is based around Optimus ""Prime"" (Prime in this series is more of a rank than name) and his small crew of Space Bridge Repair bots consisting of Bumblebee (who is a wisecracking smart alec daredevil sort), Bulkhead ,the big lovable but destructive bot of the group, Ratchet, the grumpy old war veteran medical bot,  and Prowl, who is more of a mystical cyber ninja robot in this series. In the beginning after accidentally coming across the lost Allspark on a Space Bridge asteroid in the middle of nowhere, they attract the attention of Megatron and the Decepticon flagship. After a small battle with Megatron, Him and the the Autobots crash land on Earth, specifically near a future Detroit, with the Autobots going into stasis for some time splashing their ship into Lake Eerie and Megatron impacting on a teenage boys farm outside the city.

Season 1 of the show deal with the Autobots acclimating to life on Earth with the help of their new human friend Sari Sumdac. A hyper little girl who seems more like an actual kid than most of the previous kid sidekicks in the series before her. She also happens to be the daughter of a rich robotics designer Issac Sumdac who has cornered the market on robotics of all types. While Sari shows them the ropes of Earth living the Autobots become heroes by stopping some silly human supervillians like the Angry Archer, Nano Sec, Professor Princess and a few more. But the true threat happens to be in Sumdacs Lab. Megatrons Head and remaining body parts are what Sumdacmade his robotics empire from and the remergence of the Autobots awakened Megatron as well. Over the course of the season the rest of the Decpticons come to earth and eventually have it out at the season ender
Season 2 has the Decepticons on Earth in hiding as the Autobot Supreme Commander comes in for a couple episode check up on Primes crew. Also they must deal with a situation that has created new transformers on Earth for both good or bad. Personal favorite is the episode featuring Wreck-Gar (played by Weird Al Yankovic) as a newly created Transformer that transforms into a garbage truck that searches for his own place in the world and making a mess of things as he goes along. Eventually the Decepticons form a plan to invade Cybertron and a big showdown commences bringing to light some secrets.

Season 3 creates a big change for Sari after thing come to light for her. As well as certain things in the Autobot Command structure on Cybertron. The human Villains take the back seat to the Decepticons as they struggle about leaderless after season 2. Megatron is taken off the board temporarily but comes back in a big way to finish off the series.

All in all the series is a love letter to all the previous versions of transformers that came before it. References to everything from G1 to Cybertron are included as well as a few things that didn't ever come out  before. The Characters are a bit off from what may have been previously but they take off on their own brilliantly. From old characters like Blitzwing becoming 3 times as personal, to new characters like Lugnut the big brute of a Decepticon who worships the ground Megatron steps on. Each character has a fun niche to fill. And unlike the previous Japanese series episodes are typically standalone adventures which doesn't need knowledge of every single episode to enjoy

Also the voice cast for this series great. To start with David Kaye, previously the voice of Megatron/Galvatron for most of the last decade becomes the voice of Optimus Prime and a few others. Spongebob and Patrick themselves, Tom Kenny, and Bill Fagerbakke, are the voices of Starscream and Bulkhead. Tara Strong (Raven from Teen Titans or Twilight Sparkle from My Little Pony: FiM) is the kid sidekick Sari. They even got old G1 veterans like Corey Burton (Shockwave, Spike, and now Megatron), Susan Blu (Arcee) and John Moschitta (Blurr). The best however has to be Townsend Coleman who is well know as the voice of the Tick in the 90's cartoon series. The Animators knew this and made his character Sentinel Prime resemble the Tick in quite a few ways.

This set is the first time Season 3 has gotten a DVD release. When Paramount originally released it they only put out the Season One opener movie ""Transform and Roll Out, Season One, and Season Two. Season 3 has been long awaited these last few years. Unknown is whether the new set contains the few Short cartoons that accompanied the previous sets so owners of the previous sets may want to hold on to them just yet. All in all unless you just don't like the animation style or some actual personality to your characters I can't recommend this series more than enough. Check it out if your a fan of fun hijinks and adventure with your warring robots",1396742400,38,5799,4.716683119447187

6295641,5,B00ITAQ2MS,"In a close future, a team of five Autobots crash in the city of Detroit. They were lucky (or unlucky enough) to have found the AllSpark and must now defend it against the Evil Decepticons!

More seriously, Animated got me into Transformers. It's a fun, well paced, well animated show that manages to become more and more intriguing as seasons pass. It's why, at the time the show stopped, I was so heartbroken to hear that season 3 never had been released in DVD. And why I couldn't be happier to own this now.
Always a pleasure to run one of the discs and listen to David Kaye (long time actor for Transformers with his performance as Megatron back in Beast Wars, yesssss!), Corey Burton (even longer time actor for Transformers as he is the original Shockwave back in G1!!) and newcomers to the franchise such as Bumper Robinson, Cree Summer and Phil LaMarr!",1456876800,2,860,4.584415584415584

6295664,5,B00ITAQ2MS,I was impressed within the first 5 minutes.  Nerdgasm.,1435968000,,54,5.0
6295665,4,B00ITAQ2MS,"So originally I didn't think I was going to like Animated. It's style was too kiddish, and the first episode was too ridiculous for me to think I'd get into it. It was made for tv, and I knew that it would affect the quality. After all there's not much you can do in the 21 minutes or so they were given for each episode.

Boy I was wrong. I started liking it immediately despite it's cotton candy nature. If you're thinking it'll be like Transformers Prime then forget it. It's catered to children, that's for sure, but an adult like me can enjoy some of the darker elements of the show. The characters aren't what you're used to if you're a fan, but they're lovable all the same.

As I said, the episodes are short. Unfortunately they copy the first Transformers cartoon and make single episodes contain an entire story plot. While there is nothing wrong with this, it makes it seem very quick and any actual story is lost among piles of fillers. Unlike Prime which has a cohesive plot, Animated has more of a set destination, but no obvious way of getting there. Basic plot: keep the Decepticon's from destroying the world. That's it really. Everything else is free game, and unfortunately the show focus's on Teen-Titan like cartoon super villains more ss than the actually Decepticon villains.

The ending is not as expected. I will keep the details to myself, but prepare to be disappointed. It should have lasted alot longer than it did, and the quick prepared for tv episodes leave you wanting more. While it was a good ending, it's still an abrupt train wreck and a halt that make you wonder if you've missed a few chapters. For those wanting a little more, there is a comic that goes along with the cartoon. It can clear up some of the ending and tie up a few loose ends.

All in all this was a surprisingly enjoyable cartoon. An adult can find themselves liking it as long as you're okay with cartoon super villains and cheesy one-liners. It can be fun as long as you let it, and while I don't associate this show with more serious ones like Prime or the IDW comics, it is still fun for any Transformer fan.",1434326400,8,2118,4.451030927835052

6295669,4,B00ITAQ2MS,"I had my reservations when this series originally came out.  I suppose it was the odd art style that got to me.  But after giving it a shot, I quickly warmed up to it and the characters, and it's since become one of my favorite versions of the Transformers franchise.  Sadly, the show only lasted three seasons, and, I feel, was cut short before some truly epic storylines really got started (if the hints and information presented in the Allspark Almanac books are anything to go by).  None the less, for what it is, I'm happy to have the complete series now, since for the longest time, they only had the first two seasons released.

In this version, the original war between the Autobots and Decepticons has long since been over, and Optimus Prime leads a rag tag group of misfits who are just simple maintance workers.  In this version, Optimus isn't the leader of the Autobots (at least, not at first); the word ""Prime"" is just used to indicate rank.  His team/friends include hotheaded medic Ratchet, calm and logical ninja Prowl, sweet and loveable Bulkhead (who's much smarter than he appears), and spunky prankster/youngster Bumblebee. When the team accidentally stumbles upon a powerful artifact called the Allspark, they re-ignite the battle between the Autobots and Decepticons, resulting in the fight being taken to Earth (as per usual in most iterations of the show).  There, the main five Autobots make it their duty to protect the Earth from both the Decepticons, as well as a cast of human supervillains, all while learning about their new home via their human friend; an 8 year old girl named Sari Sumdac (who holds a few secrets of her own).

All the characters are pretty likeable, and this version of Optimus Prime was pretty unique. In all other versions, we see him as the steadfast, confident and wise leader, but here, Optimus is just starting out; coming into his own and learning what it takes to rally a team of unlikely heroes to save the universe.  And out of all the various human characters that've graced the TF franchise (fans seem to either love them or hate them, with no in between), Sari remains one of my favorites. For one thing, this was the first time we got a GIRL as the main human protagonist (not that we haven't had girls before, but they still always seem to play second fiddle to the main boy character), and she was only 8 years old at the start of the series (the youngest protagonist thus far).  She was also clearly of Indian decent (if her skin tone and her dad are anything to go by), also making her the first human POC in a Transformers show (if I'm not mistaken).  Always nice to see some positive race representation.  :)

As for the villains, Megatron is much more menacing in this incarnation; reminding me a bit of Slade from the Teen Titans cartoon. Much as I love Frank Welker's performance, this is NO bad guy to be messed with. He never cackles or gets cocky; never calls a retreat or brags about his master plans.  He's always very cool and collect; always staying one step ahead of the heroes like a master chess player; always immediately thinking up a new plan when his first plans fail.  Fan favorite Starscream makes a comeback, and Tom Kenny is clearly channeling the late Chris Latta's 80s performance.  Black Arachnia from Beast Wars makes a transition to this show as well, although her background origin is altered (and without spoiling anything, it's pretty tragic). As for the human villains, they're kind of hit or miss, but they never overshadow the Decepticons.  I never had a problem with them, although your mileage may vary  (as I said, fans either love or hate the humans in Transformers).

And for the hard core TF fans, homages, references, call backs, and Easter Eggs to past incarnations of the franchise are up the wazzoo. Nearly every episode has more than a few cameos if you look hard enough. Some, they don't even attempt to hide.  Spike, Carly, and Daniel from the original G1 show appear more than once, and one episode famously has Weird Al Yankovic voicing this series' incarnation of Wreck-Gar (a reference to the usage of his song, ""Dare to be Stupid"" in ""Transformers: The Movie"").  And plenty of other fan favorites, like Arcee, Blitzwing, Waspinator, Jazz, Swindle, the Dinobots, and many others all appear.

Sadly, there's very little in the way of special features. The only extras are all the extra bonuses that were included on the first two season set releases, with nothing new added.

Clearly, this show was made by fans, FOR fans, and it's a shame it didn't go on for longer.  But as it stands, this is a pretty decent incarnation of the famous alien robots.  If you love the Transformers, give this series a shot.  I guarantee you'll like it, or at least will smile at all the references strewn about.",1429488000,7,4814,4.679715302491103

6295698,4,B00ITAQ2MS,"I was a bit surprised by Transformers Animated. Transformers lovers need to understand that it's aimed at a younger audience than the original show, however that shouldn't stop you from seeing it. I was initially unimpressed, particularly with the first series, because it really upset my balance of what I thought Transformers should be. However, the characterisation is strong, there are new takes on old characters that are progressive and fresh rather than disappointing.
What I loved about it was the way it incorporated a lot of G1 lore but with a modern take. What I didn't perhaps love too much was the Sari character, who I did find to be a bit annoying. However at least she too changes as the show goes on. Lastly, I would say the animation and art style itself takes some getting used to. The cartoony, offset and strange shapes lack the industrial and mechanised feel of G1 that we all know and love. However the colours and so on are bright and vibrant.
Overall, an excellent show to introduce kids to Transformers with. And for adults - it's definitely NOT as good as the Prime series, but better than having no Transformers series to watch at all! Get it.",1416009600,,1171,4.689320388349515

6295716,4,B00ITAQ2MS,"First, to clarify for those who aren't aware of what this product is, this is the animated series that was released ---, not the 1984 cartoon.
But what you get here is a six (6) disk DVD set with all three complete seasons of this fantastic show.
The show I think, is a lot of fun. It is a very kid friendly show that at the same time doesnt insult the intelligence of adult fans.
Admittedly (especially for a longtime transformer fan like myself), some aspects are difficult to get used to, most notably the cartoonish look of the show. Other aspects, like the human protagonist (a young girl named Sari), and the fact that the Autobot characters often have to deal with human villians can also get annoying.
But, if you can get over these things, this actually is a very solid transformer series.
It focuses on 5 Autobot characters, who really are just down on their luck, but throughout the series you see them struggle, grow as characters and teammates, and ultimately change the outcome of the Autobot/Decepticon conflict.
Theres a lot of depth put into this show, and a lot of heart. Even though the creators of this show choose to rewrite things, its quite clear they did their homework on whats come before, since they make nods to just about every other transformer incarnation.
Another oddity is that Optimus Prime isn't the great hero we all are used to, hes more like a starship captain in charge of a ragtag band of misfits who aren't really warriors. However, the Decepticon characters are super powerful villains that often need to be outsmarted as opposed to overpowered. This show also brings us one of the best Megatrons in cartoon history.
From my understanding, the series was slated for a 4 year run, but was cut short at the end of season 3. However, the finale of season 3 at least has tied up all the major story plot lines, and for the most part gives us a satisfying conclusion.
As for this set, you get all 42 episodes of the series (including the previously unreleased 13 episodes that make up season 3).
The packaging states there are audio commentaries, but I have yet to find any (maybe I missed them).
Sadly, there is no closed captioning option. This set really seems to be a bare basic set.
Closing thoughts:
I think this really is a great set. If you're looking for a transformers series for kids, I think this one is a winner. If you're a fan of Transformers or cartoons in general, this might be great if you can get past the aforementioned art style and general kiddyness of this show.
And for already existing fans of this show, this is the series, nothing more, nothing less. But at least you can pick up the show in its entirety in one fell swoop (like I did). The price also is decent, although I lucked out and got it on sale here at Amazon for 21.99. The only reasons this set doesnt get 5 stars is a lack of closed captioning, and there not being much in the way of bonus content.",1409616000,2,2925,4.479400749063671
6295717,5,B00ITAQ2MS,"This is a great Transformers series, it has enough references and nods to G1 to keep old fans happy, but has new art and stories for the new fans. it's funny and gave fresh breath to the franchise.

6295723,4,B00ITAQ2MS,"Transformers: Animated is probably the most wacky TF series to be shown in the US. This series featured Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Ratchet, Bulkhead, and Prowl as the crew of a repair ship in deep space fixing space bridges. The Decepticons having been driven into exile attack the crew after they find the Allspark and they crash land on Earth near Detroit where an absent-minded sciencist finds Megatron's head and uses it to jump start a robotic industery and 50 years later the Autobots are awaken and find themselves to be super-heroes after helping stop rejected human supervillains, and Sari, the scienceist's incredibly annoying young  daughter finds the Allspark and it turns into a key that can be used to repair and even bring Transformers back to life. The first season is extremely annoying and most of the human villains are just plain stupid and feel like rejects from ""Teen Titans Go!"". The episodes with the Decepticons are the real highlights.

The second season is an improvement with Megatron holding Sari's father hostage and with the Allspark shattered that brings new characters into the series as well as Ultra Magnus, Sentinal Prime, and Jazz coming to Earth to ""help"" Optimus and company.

The third and final season is the best with Sari's origin and destiny revealed and she gets an upgrade and the series focus on the war between the Autobots and the Decepticons and the battle for both Cybertron and Earth,

The series also features some great voice actors and guest stars and there a lot of Easter Eggs for hardcore Transformers fans to find. If you can get through season 1 and the Sari episodes of season 2 this series finally pull itself together in season 3. .  .",1408060800,2,1697,4.837931034482758

They lived up to their usual high quality standards with this set (all play that actually plays all the episodes for the win!) but still kept the consumer cost super reasonable.

I wish for a better scene skip option when I've had to stop the disc in the middle of my binge, but that isn't enough of a problem for me to lower my rating.  Your milage may vary on this point.",1405900800,3,535,4.383838383838384

I spent 3 days watching seasons 1-3. I was ecstatic the entire time. This series has brought many laughs and the animation was awesome!
Unfortunatly, all good things come to a...quite tragic end. When the last episode ended, I thought to myself,""Yaaassss, I wonder what happens next.."" Only to feel my heart sink when it went back to the DVD menu.
This series was cut too short. There are so many unanswered questions that never had the chance to be explained.
Doesn't make sense on why they were given the axe.. The toy sales were great and Season 4 was already being planned. I enjoyed this waaaay more than what Michael Bay had...given....us.
I can only hope that they pick this series back up...
