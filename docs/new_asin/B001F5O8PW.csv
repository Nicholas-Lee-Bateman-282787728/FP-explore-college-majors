There are some parts showing animal""s hunting for food that kids under 6 might find upsetting. This film makes the most sense if you have watched Born Free first. Bill Travers of Born Free directs this movie.",1506124800,,359,4.373134328358209
8301062,4,B001F5O8PW,"This is a great factual documentary on three of the lions that stared in the Born Free movie. This dvd shows what happened to them after the filming of Born Free. If you are interested in George & Joy Adamson's work to re-introduce lions raised by humans back to the wild again, this dvd will be of interest to you. Bill and Virginia Travers have made this dvd possible by invested countless time and money to make,  with both their involvement with Christian the Lion ( Another great dvd )and the Born Free Foundation.
 All of the Born Free books and dvd's have a very emotional story to tell and I highly recommend them.  I now have a greater understanding of what is happening to wild live in parts of Africa.",1370476800,2,712,4.419847328244275

8301064,5,B001F5O8PW,"I found this a very compelling film.  It was interesting to see George Adamson in real life and the real life lions that were used to film Born Free.  There is a sadness knowing that Mr. Adamson was murdered shortly after this film and the sadness of not knowing what would become of these lions who befriended people; their primary destination would be zoos.  That unique and rare bond of a wild animal and human was touching to watch as Mr. Adamson was greeted by them, bonded with them, napped with them and eventually their cubs as well.  Unfortunately that is probably the worse thing for wild animals since they won't fear people and can  make them  more vulnerable to hunters or poachers.  All in all I enjoyed this rare type of film/documentary and if you loved Born Free as a kid I think you would really want to see this film as well.",1284076800,6,844,4.441558441558442
8301065,4,B001F5O8PW,"I enjoyed watching this documentary about releasing the lions used to make the Born Free movie back into the wild.  Fans of George Adamson will greatly enjoy seeing this lion guru interact with his ""pride"".  Those intersted in Africa and it's wildlife will find it interesting too!",1240876800,11,281,4.957446808510638
