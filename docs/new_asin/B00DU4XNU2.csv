8597780,5,B00DU4XNU2,"The Production is greatly put together! The Production company must have done their homework. Great Picture quality , Music, & Narration. A part of Arizona History I never heard of, so much happened in this area . Zane Grey the famous western writer lived just up the way from the Kohl's Family. And Zane grey Filmed some of his movies there in the area. A must watch DVD. Very relaxing.
I hear they are printing up more Dvd's. Im glad I want to buy some as gifts for my family.!!
