4894387,4,B005UNI2XY,"I tend to gravitate towards coming-of-age stories, so naturally I was very intrigued by the Italian film Corpo Celeste upon seeing the trailer. The feelings of isolation, uncertainty, and self-discovery often hit personal chords with me when the film is executed well and they always leave a lasting impression on me far more noteworthy than films of other genres. Corpo Celeste looked promising to fulfill those traits judging from the images of religion and exploration shown through a natural looking style.

I've been let down by trailers before, though, but I couldn't help but still be excited. Luckily most of my expectations were met. Most noticeable is the natural, sometimes shaky camera work. This technique is often very effective in these types of films, as it produces more of a feeling we're observing the characters up close and personal rather than simply watching a movie. A near perfectly execution of this style is seen in the British film Fish Tank, which this film reminded me of in a few aspects.

The film follows 13 year old Marta who's recently moved back to Reggio Calabria, her native region in Italy, after a 10-year stint in Switzerland. She's quiet, sweet, innocent, and curious. She's more of an observer and and explorer, which we quickly gather from the beginning. Her mother is a hard worker, working at a seemingly rough and fast-paced bakery to make ends meet. Marta's sister is a practitioner of tough love, which is most prominent when she scolds Marta, who's just baked her older sister a birthday cake all by herself, simply for wearing her bra.

Marta is soon enrolled in the local Catholic confirmation class, which provides more material for her to observe and ponder. The teacher could be any other school teacher in the way she discusses the scriptures and runs her classroom. The students memorize prayers as they would mathematical formulas. Though Marta doesn't say a whole lot, especially while in class, we read a lot from her expressions. From the few questions she raises, it's clear she is more interested in the meaning behind the teachings which dumbfounds the teacher, who would prefer the students listen and memorize.

Marta is an easy character to fall in love with. Actress Yle Vianello is a natural in playing the quiet and adventurous girl. Back to my comparison of Fish Tank, she reminded me of actress Katie Jarvis, not in terms of their characters' personalities or situations, but rather their organic and authentic portrayal that really makes us believe that they've been through what we're seeing. The little details, such as how she looks at herself in the mirror, how she interacts with her mother, and the look on her face when she's observing various other characters, make it feel as if she's more than just acting. And in situations where she's upset, it's quite heartbreaking to watch.

There's a fairly important segment in the film where Marta had been running on the streets (after seeing something quite upsetting) and she's picked up by the priest, Don Mario (Salvatore Cantalupo, Gomorrah). She had recently been observing the priest's behavior in pursuing a potentially selfish agenda, which in addition to her confirmation lessons only alludes to the hypocrisy of the Church. While riding with Don Mario, who's seeking a certain cross to show off to a high-profile audience member, Marta learns much more about the real world and we see her begin to develop her own thoughts on God and faith.

This film does all of the right things for making a movie of this genre. The raw style fits perfectly, the story is minimal and natural feeling. But most importantly, the acting is spot on which if not can easily break a film like this. Yle Vianello dominates, but the entire cast felt authentic. To me, you can make two types of coming-of-age films: one that tells a story with a conclusion where the character learns a life lesson, or one that more observes several scenarios with less focus on a single story. Corpo Celeste is the latter, which in my opinion is a much harder film to make and let alone be enjoyable. Everything is executed well here, and the true test of which it passed was whether it made me feel attached to the characters and experience many emotions towards them.

Corpo Celeste is a profound look into the life of a girl finding herself and her faith by way of challenging everything around her. This is the type of movie that offers more of an experience than a story, and leaves you feeling satisfied but more importantly, wondering what's next for the main character. Having that type of impact draws the line between a good movie and a meaningful film. This has always been one of my favorite genres and Corpo Celeste is another example of why. It may have not been as edgy or gritty as something like Fish Tank, but still had the emotional impact I expect from these types of films.

4894390,4,B005UNI2XY,"First things first, I am a huge fan of the Film Movement library of foreign and indie movie, and this is the most recent (May, 2012) release. Film Movement releases films in the US on DVD that otherwise would never find an audience here.

""Corpo Celeste"", roughly translated as ""Celestial Body"" (2011 release from Italy; 99 min.) brings the tender coming of age tale of 13 yr. old Marta, who recently relocated from Switzerland back to the family roots in southern Italy. She is preparing for Confirmation, a religious passage-of-age not unlike say the Bar/Bat Mitzvah in the Jewish faith, and the pressure to ""fit in"" with the rest of her Confirmation class is huge, not to mention the troubles at home (mon being non-functionally always in bed with some sickness, and disagreements with her 18 yr. old sister). There are no huge plot developments, we are simply watching Marta coping and getting ready for the day of Confirmation, as she struggles to find her identity. Religion plays a huge role in this movie, obviously, and the local priest, Father Mario, is a key to the movie as well.

I have to say I was enthralled by the movie from start to finish. Two revelations (not in the religious sense, of course) are young actress Yle Vianello in the role of Marta, she simply blew me away, and also first time writer-director Alice Rohrwacher, I cannot wait to see what she will bring next. As a further aside, this DVD comes with a bonus short film, as is the custom on Film Movement DVDs, and the 25 min. German shorty ""Raju"", which was nominated for an Oscar, is definitely worth checking out as well. Meanwhile, ""Corpo Celeste"" is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, but oh-so-good. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1337126400,4,1719,4.745819397993311
4894391,5,B005UNI2XY,"Alice Rohrwacher's film doesn't seem like a debut feature for her, more like an experienced director's work that's seen and done it all already.  Portraying Catholicism is not an easy task, but she was not afraid to put some very different opinions about it in this film.  It's refreshing really, how it looks at religion from more than one angle.  It's not done often enough!

When watching Yle Vianello, who plays Marta, the central girl to the film, you are surprised by how fearless she is.  Emotionally, this film is deep on many levels, dealing with family, God, the struggles of adolescence, and more.  Already a fan of Italian cinema, this film didn't disappoint at all!",1333584000,4,678,4.801724137931035

8486988,5,B005UNI2XY,"""Corpo Celeste"" was an excellent and revealing parable about the false promises and flaws inherent in organized religion, especially regarding the broken priest and the crusty, old Bishop and his Satanic assistant. ""His Excellency needs a napkin"" ...indeed. Jesus should be angry. The reason He has not returned, is because people have so completely twisted his words and made a Frankenstein monster of his good intent. This is an important film for people with a scholarly interest in religion and faith, not for the dull witted, as may be seen by the idiotic one star reviews that consist of one word each...misspelled no less.",1492300800,,629,5.0576923076923075

8486992,5,B005UNI2XY,"Having grown up in the Irish catholic tradition, the most mean spirited vindictive variation of the ancient faith I always believed the Italians had a much lighter take on the whole thing. Boy was I wrong. This is a wrenchingly sad story of a young girl transplanted from the relatively secular environment of Switzerland to Reggio Calabria a city on the ""toe"" of the boot shape that is Italy as her mothers health deteriorates. I had always thought that this was a beautiful region but the Calabria shown here is stark gritty, industrial and bleak.

The protagonist youthful ""Marta"" is dealing with puberty and all of its confusions, an older sister who is both protective and emotionally abusive,  and the local catholic church where she is being prepared for her confirmation. The parish is run by a disengaged priest who longs for a higher station in the church, a lonely spinster  catechism teacher and a stoic menacing sacristan. Marta tries earnestly to believe even as she is ridiculed and the hypocrisy of the church is revealed to her. In the end hers is a painful voyage of discovery, betrayal and crushed faith that will leave one both sad and yearning for her survival and ultimate redemption.",1413158400,,1206,4.844660194174757
8486993,4,B005UNI2XY,"I must admit it took me two viewings to fully get and enjoy this film. The first time I was a little put off by some aspects of the screenplay that are not developed well and seemed too didactic. However, I decided to give it a second chance because some of its powerful imagery kept lingering in my mind. Thankfully I did! Corpo Celeste is a subtle but haunting reflection on religion, its pervasiveness and the role it plays in Italian society. The story itself is quite interesting, but its visual aspect really elevates the film and carries most of its meaning through a careful and delicate use of symbolism that never feels dull or didactic. Its actually worth seeing Corpo Celeste even only for its extraordinary cinematography, but I guarantee it will stay with you for quite a while. Recommended!",1406592000,,805,4.716312056737588
8486994,3,B005UNI2XY,"I enjoyed watching the everyday life of this Italian family. The movie also exposed interesting and conflicting subjects about religion and the Catholic church.

I was only uncomfortable having to see a little girl on the cusp of puberty experiencing such intimates moments, as when she is naked in the bathroom or when she experiences her first menstruation. These parts were unnecessary and made the viewer feel uncomfortable. These sections could have been left out.",1397347200,,469,5.253333333333333
8486995,4,B005UNI2XY,"Corpo Celeste (Alice Rohrwacher, 2011)

I don't even remember what originally prompted me to add Corpo Celeste to my Netflix queue. I am relatively certain it has been there since a few days after we resubscribed in November 2011, and I finally got round to watching it in August 2013. It had always intrigued me, but I was a little put off by its place in my queue, which I sort by star rating; it is consistently in the bottom ten percent. I have my hypotheses, now that I have watched it, on why this is. Most of them I am not going to touch on, though if you read between the lines I'm pretty sure they'll be clear enough. But this one, since it's part of the thesis for the entire review, I have to put out there--this is one of those art-school-style slow films. There is not a great deal of action here, though there is much under the surface that warrants the viewer's attention, and (as befits a film that centers around Mother Church as much as this one does) a great deal of symbolism here that will require the viewer to think a bunch, and possibly to be familiar with customs that are not quite American. (There is a wonderful, funny-yet-depressing scene ten minutes before the end of the movie whose significance I would have missed entirely had I not watched Mahomet-Saleh Haroun's A Screaming Man the week before, which has a variation on the same shot, but in a much less symbolic fashion, as a part of its closing sequence.) From this, you might actually be able to skip the rest of this review; if you are a fan of slow film of the Ozu/Tarr/etc. variety, I would hazard a guess that you will find a great deal here to enjoy. On the other hand, if you prefer movies that spell things out a little more, you might do better to avoid this one. I hope you are of the former stripe, because if you glom onto what Rohrwacher, turning in her first feature (she previously directed a documentary I have not yet tracked down--but after seeing this, it's on my priority list), is doing here, there are many reasons to devote your time to Corpo Celeste.

The movie centers on Marta (Yle Vianello in her first screen appearance--I fervently hope it is not her last as well), a thirteen-year-old Italian girl raised in Switzerland, but whose mother has moved back to the Old Country (why is never specified). Her mother (Pasqualina Scuncia, also making her first screen appearance) and older sister (The New Monsters Today's Paola Lavini) are not religious folks, but Marta finds herself drawn to the Catholic church, and begins catechism classes under the tutelage of Rita (We Can Do That's Anita Ciprioli), the long-suffering assistant to local priest Don Mario (Gomorrah's Salvatore Cantalupo). While she initially throws herself into her religious studies with a great deal of fervor, the more she discovers about the inner workings of the church, the more she questions what she had initially seen as her faith--until an act of shocking violence makes her question whether she wants to commit herself.

A movie in which not much happens save one central scene of violence that is almost entirely out of place? It's obvious Alice Rohrwacher is a big fan of B&eacute;la Tarr's, and if you've followed my reviews at all, you know that's as good as me saying ""this is the best thing ever."" It is a film that is chock full of symbolism, it is (to put it mildly) leisurely-paced, and judging by the IMDB boards, a lot of people looked at the movie's final scene and said ""what exactly is it that I am watching here?"". I can't exactly call this a spoiler: Marta, having wandered down to the beach, meets a small cadre of local children. One of them, eyes wide with wonder, puts something into her hand. This part I did have to look up afterwards: it is a disembodied lizard's tail. (I had thought it a worm of some sort.) She looks down at it, still thrashing around in the throes of autotomy, and considers it in the context of everything that has happened to her over the course of the film. Is that a spoiler? No--the spoiler lies in how you interpret the scene. But then, everyone has an interpretation. Better, perhaps, to say that the spoiler is in whether your interpretation of the scene is optimistic or pessimistic. In any case, I lost my train of thought there, as so often happens when I am confronted with this sort of beauty. Suffice to say that this is not a movie for everyone. But if slow film is your bag--if you like Ozu and Tarr and Jon Jost and folks like that--you're going to dig this. There is much, much, much going on below the surface for you to mull over, pull apart, ponder, and talk about with your pals after you've watched it, and as far as I'm concerned, that's what the best movies do: make the viewer think. ****",1378166400,,4751,4.522093023255814
