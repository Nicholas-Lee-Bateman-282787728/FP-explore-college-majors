4472398,5,B004UXVDOA,"We look forward to each episode and am glad to see this news:

""TNT Renews Mega-Hit Rizzoli & Isles for Third Season

TNT has booked its blockbuster series Rizzoli & Isles for a third season. The record-breaking drama - from Warner Horizon Television and starring Angie Harmon and Sasha Alexander - is in the midst of a terrific second season that has it running neck-and-neck with The Closer as this year's top basic cable series. TNT has ordered 15 episodes of Rizzoli & Isles for its third season, which is slated to launch in summer 2012. The show's second season will continue airing Monday nights at 10 p.m. (ET/PT) through Sept. 12. Rizzoli & Isles will return to wrap up its second season with new episodes in November and December.""

As of this review, the season is obviously still running, so I hope this preorder price reflects the entire season, including its fall '11 wrap up. I know season one's price hasn't hit barely below $4/episode, which is entirely ridiculous. We're hoping it drops by quite a bit. As great as it is, I can't see spending over $2/episode for any TV episode, but hey! Dr Who gets it! :-)",1313020800,21,1125,4.615
4472399,5,B004UXVDOA,"""Rizzoli & Isles"" returns for a 15-episode second season in 2011, with Angie Harmon reprising her role as tough, driven, and street-wise detective Jane Rizzoli, partnered with Sasha Alexander as the brillant but socially awkward Medical Examiner Dr. Maura Isles.  Bruce McGill as Vince Korsak and Lee Thompson Young as Barry Frost are back as Rizzoli's fellow detectives.

In this second season, Boston's finest get a broader range of cases, including the murder of a returning war veteran, a killer in uniform who strikes during Boston's Fleet Week, the abduction of an undercover cop's child, and the strange death of a baseball coach, among others.

Jane Rizzoli's family gets a bigger role in the second season, as her patrolman brother Frankie wants a piece of the action, her newly divorced mother Angela (Lorraine Bracco) moves in with Jane and takes a job at the police cafeteria, and Jane's other brother just wants to stay out of jail. Also, we meet Maura's adoptive mother and her rather dangerous biological father.

The heart of the show continues to be the often hilarious interaction between Jane and Maura.  Imagine the possibiities of Maura taking tomboyish Jane to a spa or attempting to dress her for a formal date, or of Jane trying to ward off Maura's unwanted suitor by pretending to be her lesbian girlfriend, and you get the idea.

""Rizzoli & Isles: The Complete Second Season"" is highly recommended to its fans. It appears ""Rizzoli & Isles"" will return for a third season in the summer of 2012.",1312934400,57,1519,4.9140625

I have fallen in love with the all of the characters , who create the most entertaining combination of drama, comedy, mystery and family !  I have best friends, and I so can relate to the trust and support that is portrayed so perfectly between Jane and Maura.....it is a joy to watch them care so unconditionally for each other, and make it so believable and so real that it makes me miss my friends !!!  Realizing that I have found this truly first rate tv show in its final season is disheartening. ......I thought there was still hope for quality television.  Great story lines, great writing, exceptional acting, that just lets you get lost in the story....great, clean, true entertainment at its best !!!!  So now I am watching all of the earlier episodes to find this show has been top notch from the beginning.  If anyone out there is listening........DONT TAKE RIZZOLI AND ISLES OFF OF THE AIR !!!!!!!  Last month it was the second highest rated show on cable......REALLY!!!  Can we look forward to another zombie, apocolypse, or reality show from TNT????!!!!!",1470096000,,1173,4.772277227722772

The trait  I I agreed with, the title just didn't set right with me.  Whatever that trait is I think our women in the military definitely exhibit it and I don't think they would like it defined as such.  Then again maybe I should read it again.

In may shows they now have the ""strong"" woman, but this show sets itself apart by having MANY strong women without turning this into a chick show. Men are liking this show as there is plenty of cops and robber action.  I cant wait to see season 3 and 4 now !  I hope that this show goes past the 5 year mark that many of these cable shows have, it is very rare for any of these other stations to carry out a show past 5 years...... this one  has made it to 6 i'd like to see this hang in like NCIS and others past the 10 yr mark !",1453507200,,634,3.716417910447761

4472963,5,B004UXVDOA,"I ran out of shows to watch during the Summer. I had seen a lot of commercials for Rizzoli and Isles in the movie theatres, but never actually saw any of it before until recently. I saw that it was in its 6th season and kept hearing about it.  One day I went on YouTube and saw the first episode. Angie Harmon is a really great actress! I started watching the show because of her and then started to like it. It is not really that great, like Elementary is, but it is decent enough. I think the show started to improve from season 1 to season 2, so I have hopes that it will be stronger.  I like the cast being females that get along as opposed to the traditional male dominated ones. When shows always make the male the hero, it can be trite. I like that there is some uniqueness to the storyline. The acting is good, in all the characters are pretty likeable.",1441584000,,861,4.149700598802395

4473210,5,B004UXVDOA,"Bought Seasons 1-3.

This show manages to blend the dark side of life with positive counter balance.  It takes me back to kind of TV I enjoy.

It is great to see a show about supportive friendship/family, with its ups & downs, in a way that I can relate to from my experiences with my own friends/life.

At times the writers seem to fall back on the standard formula for police drama, but more often than not, the show keeps a realistic balance of positive and negative.  Most of the story lines are well written; but I always wonder why it is necessary to always throw in a psychotic killer who keeps making appearances.

If less was shown about crazy, psychotic behavior, maybe there might be less of it in real life.  Life has many, many stories that can be told without the vicious, vindictive, crazy, characters being the main focus.

With all that said, Rizzoli & Isles is positively different enough from many of today's TV shows for me to really enjoy watching. it.",1421107200,,973,4.52

He saw a few episodes and became hooked and wanted to see the earlier seasons. If you do not know the show, it is about a female homicide detective (Rizzoli) and the county coroner (Isles) who are also best friends. Rizzoli is a down and tough cop and Isles is a brilliant sophisticated woman (can you see personality clashes yet).

4473515,3,B004UXVDOA,"After watching the first season of Rizzoli & Isles, I tentatively recommended the series and decided to order the second season based on the strong performances of Angie Harmon who plays Detective Jane Rizzoli.  I was hoping that the rest of the characters would grow on me during the second season.  Unfortunately, that did not happen.  The second season of the show only reinforced and amplified my dislike for pretty much every character in the show except for Jane Rizzoli.  Jane's family was so annoying that I literally cringed when they delivered their awkward and often forced attempts at humor.  The Dr. Maura Isles character remained just as hard to relate to as before and Jane's other coworkers remained just as uninteresting as ever to me.  In short, I can no longer recommend this series and I do not plan to watch any more of it.  I am amazed it was not cancelled after this season.",1381190400,,897,4.711538461538462

4473573,5,B004UXVDOA,"I love shows like NCIS, Criminal Minds, Castle - you get the picture.  Well, we do not have cable or Dish so I had not seen this until I caught a couple of the first shows at my daughter's house.  I immediately got caught up in them.  They had to cut back so cable went.  I no longer had access to ever seeing these shows again. Just love Angie Harmon in all that she has done.  She and Sasha Alexander have great chemistry together.  Entire cast works wonderfully together.  You have the murders but there is light humor and street tough attitude.  I find this cast of characters addictive. Found the videos and had to order them. Hard to just watch one show and turn it off.  I am not one to watch the same show more than once but I really can watch these several times even though I know the ending.  Well worth the money.",1373932800,,825,4.197452229299363

4473607,5,B004UXVDOA,"The first episode, although well worth watching, is a little creaky, as the actors get acquainted with their characters and we get used to their new roles,and then it takes off like a rocket.  The whole ensemble is great together, and along with good suspense and action, there are many big laughs.  I'm guessing this will be even more engaging for women than men, but it's a show all can like.  I will watch this on TV over anything else that's on, except for Mentalist, even if it's a re-run.",1371168000,,494,4.466666666666667
4473608,2,B004UXVDOA,I loved the first season and in anticipation of the second went and bought it. Unfortunately the bigger role of the mother seemed at times sufferable which means less time for Rizzoli and Isles to interact. If the mother is given the same big role in third season don't even want to watch it.,1371081600,,292,4.425925925925926

4473613,5,B004UXVDOA,"I bought the first two seasons of this beloved TV series I introduced my grand daughter to for her 22nd birthday. She was thrilled to receive them. The show stars Angie Harmon and Sasha Alexander, two very strong role models for young women. Angie plays A homicide detective, Rizzoli, and Sasha plays an medical examiner (M.E.){Isles} and they are show-cased in some very difficult yet humorous story lines from week to week. Rizzolli is a very pragmatic 'by the book' detective who also 'uses her gut instincts' to solve the mystery surrounding the murder of the week; whereas Isiles is a brilliant 'factual' thinker and doesn't understand the 'by the gut instinct' that R. has. They work together and somehow are able to solve the mystery and 'nab their miscreant' week after week. A very pleasant way to spend an hour.",1369440000,,821,4.829787234042553

4473661,5,B004UXVDOA,"This has to be one the best cop dramas since the early days of Law & Order SVU. Jane is forced to deal with her past both with Hoyt and High School. We also get to see more into the shadowy past of Maura. And of course we get to see more the Rizzoli clan and new developments that occur along the way.

Sasha and Angie are so good together and their characters really help give this show something that draws you in as a viewer.",1364169600,,428,3.9767441860465116

4473691,5,B004UXVDOA,"The writers seem to be a bit on the edge as to whether they are writing a drama or a sitcom. This is not a crime procedural but rather a character-focused story that involves solving crime. If you're looking for a procedural, stick with CSI, NCIS, or L&O, but if you're looking for fun, well-developed characters who grow and develop while tackling crime, this is the show for you.

Jane Rizzoli and Maura Isles are fantastic, strong, independent women who excel in their (typically male-dominated) careers. They don't let anything or anyone hold them back from doing the best and being the best they can be. Amazing role models.",1361577600,,629,4.770642201834862

As a fan of the series of novels by Tess Gerritsen, it is amazing to see how Angie and Sasha, with the help of the great writers and show runner Janet Tamaro bring these beloved characters to life. While there are some differences between the books and the small screen adaptations, now, as I continue to read the books, I find myself picturing Angie and Sasha, and Lorraine Bracco as Mama Rizzoli, instead of the blah images I had in my head before the show came out. Can't wait for Season 3's release!",1360540800,,624,4.530973451327434

Having lived in southern New England for a number of years, I thoroughly enjoy Mrs Rizzoli's character along with Vince.  The interplay betw the two central characters continues to be fun to watch.  The writers seem to ""tone"" down Maura's OCD personality as the seasons develop.  Her second season persona is less anxious and easier to watch.  The only part of the puzzle is the Maura's dad and how jarringly he appears in the 2nd season.  Insufficient groundwork was laid for his introduction.",1355097600,,606,4.882352941176471

4473905,4,B004UXVDOA,"...you'll probably like this.  Street smart tough female cop with some trauma history, stereotypical close Italian NY family, ultra-brainy medical examiner with unknown past.  The formula for success is there and the chemistry on screen is very good with the main characters.  Rizzoli has love interests coming on and off the show as this early on, a steady relationship is death.  Isles, well she isn't showing herself as relationship material quite yet but that doesn't slow her down.  More development on the Isles character takes place form time to time but that is definitely a place where the show can grow.  It can be a bit campy and I wouldn't put it at a Bones quality but then again, some episodes of Bones isn't Bones quality either.  A good show and I really enjoy watching it and hope to see them further develop the characters into less characterizations and more truly believable people.",1354838400,,902,4.856209150326797

Little slivers of information have been used from the books but they tie it in well.  Angie Harmon is the perfect personality to play Detective Jane Rizzoli and Sasha Alexander is well adapted as Chief Medical Examiner, Dr Maura Isles.

I appreciate what the Creator of this Series (Janet Tamaro) has done to bring Tess's books to life! Though Janet's interpretation differs slightly from the books I like that the Ladies have so much depth to them! They've developed and continue to develop each season! Season 3 in my opinion has been the best season by far (with a few more episodes to air in November).

Admit who they are to each other and get on with the real show that we love.  And the nun character in a squad room like the one protrayed is stupid beyond words. Dump the nun.

The interaction between Jane and Maura is great to watch. They understand each other, care deeply and enjoy a tremendous friendship whilst respecting each other professionally. They are super role models.

The writers have done well to produce a show with serious intent and story lines but with some great humour and pathos that makes it extremely watchable. This season we've seen the addition of an ongoing long distance love interest for Jane which has allowed us to see an extra dimension of her character.

The final episode was a dousy, particularly the last scene. It will be fascinating to see how the writers manage the conflict in Season 3. I wish I didn't have to wait until later this year to watch it.

If you haven't watched this show, do so. It's a delightful surprise.",1339632000,,814,4.711267605633803
4474053,4,B004UXVDOA,"I very much enjoy this series, especially the way Rizzoli and Isles interact with each other and the way each one has her own strengths and quirks.  It seems like the actresses have fun with their roles and with each other and watching their friendship is a fun dimension of the show.  It's also nice to see that despite their insecurities and downright awkward/dorky moments, they are ultimately portrayed as smart, insightful women who are excellent at what they do and who have compassion and depth in their dealings with others when it matters most.

The mysteries are fine...often predictable, but entertaining and perfectly serviceable in a show that does not take itself overly seriously.  And yet, there are definitely compelling storylines and even some dark notes (Jane's nemesis creeps me out).

I like that this show cares about interpersonal dynamics and we see characters work through conflicts and we see characters grow.  While the actor playing Mr. Rizzoli in Season 1 was talented and of a high pedigree (!), his cartoonish character was probably as annoying to play as it was to watch and his absence in Season 2 is a good change.  Jane's mom is still a bit over the top, but we saw more depth and nuance to her this season and hopefully that will continue in Season 3 as well.

I enjoyed seeing Detective Frost come into his own this season.  He may still be squeamish, but he is also smart, strong, loyal and insightful. And he gives as good as he gets and does not seem intimidated or newbie at all anymore.

There were a few guest stars who made my Veronic Mars loving heart happy to see again, so that was yet another bonus to this show.",1339113600,,1661,4.638225255972697

Special Agent Gabriel Dean also appears and plants interesting seeds regarding where the future lies for him and Jane. Those who have read the novels, that this incredible series was based on, may have grounds for suspicion regarding what's going to happen down the road for this ""will they or won't they"" plot thread but if it doesn't follow the same primrose path, it wouldn't be the first time that a TV adaptation made a dramatic departure from the parent novel series.

4474160,5,B004UXVDOA,"I love this show.  Angie Harmon and Sasha Alexander play so well off each other.  Both are gorgeous in their own ways.  Angie still has that wonders tall, thin model look but is not too skin/thin.  She has some curves.",1333324800,4,218,4.375
4474161,5,B004UXVDOA,"This show is a great addition to the long line up of police procedurals available at the moment.
Sasha Alexander and Angie Harmon are hilarious to watch. They have a great chemistry which makes for some really awesome scenes.
Rizzoli & Isles, is funny and gritty, and gets right into the heart of the matter.
I recommend this show to anyone who is a fan of a cop show, or just wants a laugh.",1332288000,5,391,4.297297297297297

4474164,5,B004UXVDOA,"Well-paced, very dramatic episode.  The last few minutes are intense.  The acting displayed by all cast members here is excellent, with special mention going to both Angie Harmon and Michael Massee; the tension between their characters is palpable.  Although this episode was quite intense, I found the mix of humor and drama to be perfectly written.  In my opinion, this is 43 minutes of television that is not to be missed.",1327104000,,425,4.943661971830986
4474215,5,B004UXVDOA,"Love the duo of Angie & Sasha -- each epi is an adventure! This seasons writing not as edgy as last season, seems more relaxed but still very well done.",1326067200,,152,4.1
4474216,5,B004UXVDOA,"I wanted to see Jane end up with Agent Dean from the first episode.  He's smart, esay-going, but seroius about his work and strong enough to handle her.  Her brashness rolls right off him, but he is able to gently help her tone it down and handle people in a kinder and more professional fashion.  Besides, he's cute and seems to know how to take care of her without smothering her.

So there's more to this episode than their relationship---a lot more, but it's apparently a seasonal cliff hanger, so I won't give it away.",1325116800,,523,4.473684210526316
4474217,5,B004UXVDOA,Love the humor and love the family Drama.  Good show and both ladies crack me up.  I like all the characters and how they treat each other like family.,1324425600,,151,4.172413793103448
4474218,5,B004UXVDOA,"I really enjoy the show, love the interaction between Jane & Maura.  I hope you continue to make more seasons.  My husband and I look forward to seeing the show.  Wish it could have longer season.  We watch it every Monday night, and really hate to see it go into hiatus so soon.  Please keep making more show.",1324339200,16,310,4.275862068965517

4474220,5,B004UXVDOA,"This was a strong episode.  It was fast paced.  It matters in the overall storyline. The chemistry between Rizzoli and Isles was dead on.  The premise was well played.  If you've watched them before, you'll really enjoy this episode. I wouldn't recommend starting on this episode, but you won't be lost if this is the first episode of the series you watch.
I thought the book was a nice touch - tipping their hat to Tess.",1322611200,,421,4.5

4474222,5,B004UXVDOA,"The show is really fun.  I love it.  The interactions between the characters, the mysteries, and the stories are all riveting.  The creators of Rizzoli & Isles put new life into an old idea.  Watch it for what it is, not from some preconceived idea of what it should be.  You'll enjoy it much better.",1318118400,10,300,4.381818181818182
4474223,4,B004UXVDOA,"RIZZOLI & ISLES (Jane Rizzoli and Maura Isles) improves with age, and now that there is only one show left in the current season of 10 shows the combination of tension and comedy has bee worked through to a fare-thee-well.  Family steps to the foreground in this episode that tracks the murders of the dockworkers in Boston. The head of the organization has been Maura's (Sasha Alexander) birth father (John Doman) but he is now on the hunted list and brought to Maura's home in need of care.  No love lost here on Maura's part but by the end of the episode the blood ties seem to mean something. Jane's (Angie Harmon) brother Tommy (Colin Egglesfield) is attracted to Maura - over an ongoing chess game, Jane's mother (Lorraine Bracco) remains her slightly off the wall self, and Jane is left to coach the situation of the multiple murders - and avoid the Sensitivity Training that runs as a comic thread through this episode.  An interesting guest appearance by Ed Begley, Jr as a fellow Autopsy Surgeon adds some flavor.  The episode covers a lot of territory but still maintains that fine balance between the comic banter of the two women law enforcement officers and the at times grueling visual events taking place along the waterfront of Boston.  How they will wind this series down with the last episode remains to be seen, but this is a show that matures well with age.  Grady Harp, September 11",1315267200,5,1404,4.663967611336032
4474224,2,B004UXVDOA,"The show gives too much service to the ""Rizzles."" Angie Harmon does a great job as Jane, but the Maura we know from the books has been replaced by a Dr. Brennan/Sarah Jessica Parker hybrid. In the books, Jane is a married mother, giving her a lot more depth as well as story options. Maura is in love with a priest- I can see why they would avoid that on TV, but it also flavors a lot of story.
The show spends a lot of time with the girls bickering like children or playing gay. It's kind of sad. Why not just make them lovers if that's what the producers think these characters are? Gay or straight, I really hope they stop making these characters act like bimbos. In the books, they are so much more interesting.
Not that anyone making the show will read this, but here's hoping.",1314057600,31,782,4.25503355704698
