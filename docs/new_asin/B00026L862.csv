2063368,4,B00026L862,"Director John Farrell's enthusiasm for the language and apparent belief that rugged natural settings will enhance the dark drama of this work pay off in spades, despite the obvious lack of big-budget production values. His actors fit their roles especially well and often bring new dimensions to the parts. Any theatre major or film professional will appreciate the way the director cleverly overcomes production hurdles to deliver an engaging entertainment, proving once again that ""the show's the thing.""",1095206400,6,506,5.5
2063369,1,B00026L862,"Acting as bad as it gets, together with low production values in the manner of a direct-to-video movie, in themselves would render this DVD a complete waste of time and money.  But there's more.  The production is an early example (the material on this newly released DVD apparently was recorded in 1987) of succumbing to a temptation apparently irresistible to modern directors, to set Shakespeare's histories or tragedies in a vaguely proto-fascist (or is it post-apocalyptic--one hardly cares) nightmare world, where the brutal setting overshadows and obscures the seriousness of the issues raised by the play, the complexity of its characters, and the nobility of its language.  This approach to Shakespeare was done well only once, in Ian McKellen's stage and then film versions of Richard III, a very different play about a very different king.  There are two good DVD versions of Richard II.  The BBC version with Derek Jacobi as Richard, Jon Finch as Bolingbroke, and John Gielgud as Gaunt, is superb, and is included in the recent five-play collection of BBC Histories from Ambrose Video, available on amazon.  There is also a good version available on amazon with, of all people, David Birney as Richard.  Unfortunately the DVD is a poor transfer from VHS.  The ESC version with Michael Pennington is on video, not DVD, and is hard to find, but it's good.  Buy or rent one of those, and stay away from this one.  And no, I'm not opposed to ""modern"" settings of Shakespeare, just to bad productions.",1094256000,19,1508,4.948412698412699
8022762,3,B00026L862,"I rented this adaptation of the Shakespeare play done by John Farrell, with a certain Matt (or Matte) Osian as the king. The DVD envelope says it combines modern costumes with modern locations in the Boston area. Richard appears dressed in pressed khakis with a white USMC dress cap as the crown, and two-and-a-half rows of US ribbons that appear to be worn upside down. The scene is set at Fort Strong on Long Island, in Boston harbor, an abandoned, overgrown collection of concrete bunkers dating from the Civil War and expanded during the two world wars. All the actors are dressed like Sandinista revolutionaries in green fatigue uniforms with a good-sized armory of weapons. A couple of women are also dressed like that, and the confusing part is that while one is addressed as Madam, i.e. the queen, the other woman is addressed as My Lord. Huh? Another confusing part is that in 1397 when the action of this play begins, Queen Isabella was only 8 years old, but that is Shakespeares problem.

John of Gaunt does not give his deathbed speech (this sceptered isle  this blessed plot  ), one of the  most famous speeches in all of Shakespeare. Perhaps the director felt that the setting wasn't quite this England enough. Richard does give the famous Hollow crown speech, so all is not lost, just unintelligible.

As for action, there is plenty: stabbings, stranglings, shootings, raging battles with submachine guns, grenades, mortars. Another huh? And if that weren't noisy enough, the score manages to drown out many of the lines.

By all means, get this DVD if you want a good laugh.",1439424000,,1590,4.805860805860806

8022764,1,B00026L862,"I know this play well, and I'd guess half the plays.  I have several versions of the major plays on video and DVD, and of course various copies of the text, some just for the particular editor's introduction.  This is one of the silliest and poorly acted Shakespeare productions I've ever seen (and I've seen plenty).  It's been months but I still regret wasting time (see the scene in Pomfret castle for reference) watching it.  I don't want to waste more time saying why this production is [...], but the mercilessly bad acting should be enough to make anyone get bored within minutes.",1150848000,,587,4.669902912621359
8022765,3,B00026L862,"For some odd reason I only saw the ""brilliant"" review this week when I decided to add this to my collection this week. Collecting Shakespeare on DVD can be a bit of a gamble, and this one truly is a mixed bag, and the extra feature ""Behind the Scenes"" helps explain why. It's hard to believe that this producer and director opted for 1"" video and a transfer to 35mm in 2001--the director says he wanted to avoid the look of a soap opera. Well, granted, but had it not been for some ability to use varied shots for interest, this could have become Blair Witch Project meets Shakespeare. It's not as bad as all that, but certainly very uneven, or, charitably, marked by a surreal quality due to the interesting setting of a fort in Quincy Bay near Boston. The strengths of this film: Matte Osian turns in a creditable performance as Richard, especially from the point he surrenders his crown to the end of the movie--he captures the ironic majesty that Richard displays once he is no longer king; Robert McCafferty as Northumberland is very good in most of his scenes; and Frank O'Donnell captures old John of Gaunt in a way that I imagined when I read the play in college almost 30 years ago. The downsides of this film will be those that displease Shakespeare purists most: (1) The sound at times is muddy due to the choice of setting, especially for the interior scenes. This is worse due to some strange audio mixing choices that have been added to somehow emphasize certain lines, thereby diminishing them. (2) Shakespeare's text here is appreciated but not given center stage. The producer, according to the extra features, had access to an ammunition specialist, some AK-47s and other weapons, and the director made far too much use of them. This play is not supposed to have gratuitous violence like Julie Taymor's version of Titus Andronicus, but it's use of guns and bombs comes close to it--violence for its own sake. (3) This is worsened by the pacing of the lines and the scenes, which is not helped by the horrible editing job! There are so many apparently ""meaningful"" scenes without words, but I fail to see what depth has been added. (4) Instead, some of the best sets of lines Shakespeare wrote in his early years are lost--John of Gaunt's ""this sceptred isle, this England"" speech among them. (5) Finally, how Richard and his Queen respond to the tragedy is changed completely as the film moves to its conclusion. Some day I hope to own the very expensive Shakespeare Plays from the BBC/PBS, but until I can see that very young Derek Jacobi playing Richard II in my own living room, this DVD will have to do. It has enough merit to be interesting; it raises several questions for discussion with friends of the Bard.",1137110400,26,2733,4.625514403292181
8022766,4,B00026L862,"I've read several of the reviews on Amazon, and I think the film was entirely watchable, and a good attempt at doing something different with Shakespeare. Granted, this is not a $50 million adaptation, and the sound and picture quality reflect the modest budget, but this doesn;t detract from the fact that its an interesting independant film, and should be viewed as such.

I hope more people will keep an open mind - I enjoyed it.",1121644800,5,432,4.684210526315789
8022767,1,B00026L862,"Poor sound, I actually looked for sub-titles as I only understood one word in four.  Poor acting and the focus of the film is soft and grayed in color.  DON""T BUY!  I gave it one star as that is the lowest rating possible, but it should  be a minus rating.",1119571200,6,256,4.06
8022768,4,B00026L862,"Director John Farrell uses all of the resources at his disposal to bring to life Shakespeare's ""Richard II""... In this film, we enter a world where old meets new - the timesless lyrical world of the bard and digital media...

Farrell shows great promise as a director, shooting on location at Fort Strong on Boston Harbor's Long Island. He takes advantage of all the natural ambience and archictecture that an old fort can provide.

""Richard II"" is filled with great filmic moments and stunning location shots...

It worth your time to take a look at this marvelous indie picture.",1118707200,6,580,4.838383838383838
8022769,4,B00026L862,"This movie really caught my interest. It is imaginatively rendered on many fronts. The director has adapted Shakespeare's play into a modern and complex character study with a fabulous sense of place, which is both ancient and incredibly contemporary at the same time. He has accomplished this without a lot of smoke and mirrors. It's low budget, but it works and you really feel for the characters, particularly Richard who faces the loss of his throne in an utterly human way, with weakness and courage. I recommend this film to anyone who loves Shakespeare and enjoys seeing new and interesting productions of a timeless piece of drama.",1115856000,4,639,4.981308411214953
8022770,5,B00026L862,"This is one of the finest contemporary films based on Shakespeare.  Director John Farrell imaginatively updates the setting to today, and the parallels between the military intrigues of Richard II's court and today's dangerous socio-political scene are extraordinary.  Wonderful acting plus imaginative camerawork and editing make this one a real winner!  Highly recommended!",1114473600,7,375,6.037735849056604
8022771,1,B00026L862,"How this video was ever released professionally is beyond explanation. The acting is well below any decent college production and renders Shakespeare's magnificent language utter undecipherable; the editing and direction are clumsy and inept, and the photography varies wildly from shot to shot, all the way from picture postcard pretty to low-level out-take quality... in fact, everything about this video is embarrassingly bargain basement. If you're not either a hopelessly naive novice or personal friends of someone associated with the production, you're in for a dreary experience here, because this piece is so bad, it's not even worth laughing at.",1113868800,5,655,5.56
