279866,5,6300256073,"I first saw this film on Bravo (before they turned into a dumbed down reality network).  The film, at the time, wasn't out on any home video format in its uncut version.  Luckily, Bravo showed the original, 163 minute version.  It was one of the most profound, humane, and intelligent films I have ever seen.  Everything in this film works.  Roger Livesy gives one of the greatest performances in the history of cinema.  He plays Clive Candy from young man to elderly gentleman so convincingly.  Anton Walbrook plays Candy's German friend is such depth and subtlety he makes you feel for all humanity.  Winston Churchill attempted to ban the film in England (it was 1943), but luckily it was unsucessful.  The film was a big hit in England.  When it reached the states, it was cut by 70 minutes, and sometimes shown in black and white.  Luckily, now the film is available only in the uncut verison.  The commentary track by Michael Powell was recorded for an early laserdisc edition of this film.  It's a commentary track worth listening to.  Everyone nowadays does commentary (still waiting for a key grip to do one), but doesn't really have anything interesting to say.  This is an exception.  This is a magnficient epic film, one worth watching over and over again.  It's typical of Powell and Pressburger films:  visually spectaular, literate, humane, and brilliant.",1147478400,15,1370,4.857142857142857
279867,5,6300256073,"The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp is one of the finest films ever made, period.  Michael Powell, a top director (49th Parallel) is at his finest as he masterfully recounts the tale of General Candy, an elderly British officer, in 1943.  We see the life of a just-wonderful human being, heroic and dashing.  As he evolves from a trim, swaggering youth of adventure to a stout and stoic old age, he never forgets his friends and never loses his faith in morality and justice, despite the travails of combat and personal loss.

Roger Livesy ('I Know Where I'm Going') is absolutely endearing as the lead and Deborah Kerr does a magnificent job in a triple-role!  Anton Wallbrook is touching and credible as a German Officer befriended by Candy.

Lovingly restored to its original length and color magnificence, this film is touching and credible as it shows the human side of war without being preachy.  There are many fine small performances and some surprising plot twists so that, despite its length, Blimp keeps viewers engaged.

By all means, a fine addition to any collection!",1126483200,10,1081,4.836956521739131
279868,5,6300256073,"I found ""The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp"" to be a haunting story, rich in story and superbly acted.  I found the film to be a very private experience - one that you will be thinking about for a long time.
I really can't add anything to the comments made before other than to say that this is the type of film that makes Criterion a special mark.  I would question many of their choices, films are available in other formats and of questionable importance (e.g. ""Armageddon"", ""The Royal Tennanbaums"" and ""The Rock"").  ""The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp"" probably would have been lost forever (or show up as a $...DVD on a ""Bargains"" rack) without the work put in by Criterion and the ""legitimacy"" conferred on it by being recognized by the brand.

This film has all of the same characteristics that sign a film by Powell and Pressburger, and this time they have done it with an old fashioned military officer, Clive Candy (Roger Livesey),  who is comfortable with his own opinions and traditions.  The very same opinions and traditions will come under close scrutiny by an entertained audience that will have to contemplate the insightful development of the film as well as the outcome of Clive Candy.  In the end, Life and Death of Colonel Blimp will have proven itself to be an outmost terrific film.",1039737600,11,708,4.92436974789916
279870,5,6300256073,"How wonderful it is to have this unique movie beautifully restored to its original length and scene order by the British Film Institute.
Until about ten years ago, I had never seen this film. I had never rented the cut, reconfigured tape, because I didn't think I'd like the film (in any form). But the L.A. County Museum of Art had an Archers' retrospective several years ago that included the BFI restoration print. Despite many of there pictures being among my favorites, I still thought I was in for a hoary WW II propaganda film. I could walk if I didn't like it.
Was I ever wrong. I came out considering it among The Archers best works. which in my book, means one of the finest films ever.
""The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp,"" in the original version, is a brilliant mix of WW II propaganda, an often whimisical loving satire of the system. It is ultimately one of the most winning anti-war films ever. In a different way, as good as ""Grand Illusion.""
This low-key epic begins with the Boer War, when Blimp is a young (too) gung-ho officer to the time the film was made--mid-war 1943. The cast is superb. Roger Livesey gives one of the best performances imaginable. Deborah Kerr (18) at the time, gives a tour-de-force performance as the three different women Blimp falls for in the 40-year span of the film. Anton Walbrook Is so brilliant in this film. This man I am now convinced was one of the greatest actors of the 20th Century. His controversial character is a German officer Blimp befriends in the Boer War and they become life-time friends, with Blimp vouching for him being permitted to stay in England during WW II. Walbrook's scene explaining why he has left Germany is as great, if not greater than his curtain speech in ""Red Shoes."" Most other actors would have turned this into maudlin sentimentality. Walbrook instead gave me a giant lump in my throat. I don't lump easily.
If you've never seen the complete, uncut and untampered with film and are Archers devotee, this is the version for you.
The extras are uniformly fine. The commentary track with Martin Scorsesse and director Michael Powell, from a recording he made on first viewing the restored film, is sharp and perceptive. He sounds very old and can be hard to understand because of it, but it is worth the extra effort to hear him comment on one of his personal favorites.
There is also an excellent half-hour or so documentary, that includes Emeric Pressburger's grandson, that helps explain why and how the film was tampered with and almost never seen as a result of Prime Minister Winston Churchill trying to ban it. No luck in England. J. Arthur Rank released it in his English theatres and advertised ""See The Banned Film."" And it was a huge hit. The ""banned"" got the initial audiences in, word-of-mouth made it the movie too see. Winnie also failed in his attempts to stop exportation to other countries.
One of the most intelligent, witty,serious, breathtakingingly beautiful Technicolor films ever released.
Get this Criterion treasure now. It also includes several Colonel Blimp ""original"" editorial cartoons, by Blimp creator David Low. Some are timely today and could run with the names changed to suit today's political and military madness. The editorial cartoons were a revelation to me.
Archer Fans, order now and have a really complete collection of these unique gems.

279871,5,6300256073,"This and ""A Matter of Life and Death"" are Powell & Presberger's masterpieces, before they descended into the schmalz of ""The Red Shoes"". The tale of the essentially decent British and German gentlemen, played by Roger Livesey and Anton Walbrook respectively, rapidly becoming dinosaurs in the changing Europe between the Boer War and the Blitz, yet clinging to their values despite being kicked in the face by the brutalisation of Germany and by the consequent brutalisation of a Britain attempting to survive against barbarism. Their friendship begins from the mutual respect engendered by a duel fought reluctantly for the honour of their respective traditions at the time of the Boer War. During convalescence they vie for the hand of Deborah Kerr, turning up in the first of 3 roles. Livesey's shyness leaves Walbrook holding the field. Nearly 20 years pass until they meet again, at a POW camp in Britain. Livesey's essential naivete rides roughshod over the wartime enmity, but Walbrook's response is ambivalent, and the reunion is short-lived and bittersweet. Livesey marries Deborah Kerr's reincarnation as a nurse, because of a resemlance to his first love. A further 20 years pass. Livesey, widowed, is asked to act as sponsor for Walbrook, now exiled from Germany, also widowed and estranged from his Nazi children. Together they come to terms with their sidelining in a world of younger men with few of the old values. Deborah Kerr turns up for the third time as Livesey's driver as he moves from army officer to Home Guard organiser,refusing to be pushed out of the fight. In appearance Livesey's character assumes the appearaqnce of David Low's cartoon Colonel Blimp, but underneath he is more rounded; decent,generous to and loyal to friends, slow to denegrate his foes and totally patriotic, but finally nobody's fool. John Laurie appears in a delicious cameo as Livesey's batman/manservant, crusty but loyal. His boss may occasionally infuriate and perlex, but Laurie recognises the basic decency, as, finally, all do who come into contact with him. It may be propaganda, but it is still magnificent.",1035676800,57,2117,5.156976744186046
279872,5,6300256073,"This is the best film by the best chroniclers of english life. I put this review on the American site because I feel the need to evangelise! Emeric Pressburger was an Hungarian refugee, and put much of his experience into the mouth of Theo, the sympathetic German character (in 1943! No wonder Churchill wanted it banned without seeing it). The film has three sections, set in 1902, 1918 and ww2. It shows the friendship between the title character, Clive Wynne Candy, and Theo Kretchsmar-Shuldorf. It's also a love story, with Deborah Kerr as three identical looking women. Most of all it's a requiem for a lost golden age, and a call to arms to defeat Nazism. The best set pieces are given to Theo (Anton Walbrook) a German refugee actor, emphasising that this is not a conflict between two equal and honourable countries, but between good and between evil, and this time, if good loses, there is no return match.

It took guts to make it at the time, but only a real artist could have made it as good as it is. Watch for the conclusion, when Powell puts on film the most beautiful and least obtrusive metaphor ever done, and makes it look like a throwaway. The miracle is that Powell took something unsubtle and crass - the Col. Blimp cartoon character - and made it poignant. This isn't a pro-war story, or a military satire, or a romance.

I hate war movies, and wasn't sure what to expect when I saw this one (particularly since it was filmed in the heat of WWII), but somehow, this portrait of a career military man (& hunter--hard to swallow for a vegetarian like me!) really grabs me-- particularly his lifelong low-key brand of romanticism, which is brought to light expertly by the episodic snatches of biography that we are made privy to(we are never hit over the head with it).

(1943, UK, 157 min, colour, English subtitles, Aspect ratio: 4:3, Audio: Mono)
EXTRA: Documentary incl. interviews with Jack Cardiff & Stephen Fry (25 min)

Few films resonate stronger with me than Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburgers eye-popping first out and out masterpiece The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp. Its difficult to explain why for I don't regard myself as a sentimentalist, but every viewing floors me  the experience quite literally moves me to tears. True, its a film I have lived and breathed since I was a teenager, seeing it numerous times at regular intervals from the 1980s onwards and I feel emotionally attached to it in a way which disarms objective criticism. Luckily I was born late enough to escape the various bastardized versions that were circulating before 1983. I have never seen it in b/w (Hallelujah!) and mercifully escaped the American release which hacked off over 40 minutes including the whole flashback structure (what DID United Artists think they had on their hands  Linoleum? United Idiots more like) which means I have grown up with Powell/Pressburgers remarkable vision intact from the first, as they would have wanted it.

Casting aside my rose-tinted glasses, I have no hesitation in hailing Blimp as one of the great films and certainly one of the top two or three British films ever made. Its genius lies in the deceptive simplicity, a clear easy to follow story containing within it multiple layers of meaning which communicate all at once in an extraordinary Technicolor dazzle which blasts us with the most amazing cinematic clarity. What communicates so simply on screen only seems complicated when laid out on paper for analysis. The film is first of all the moving fictional biopic of a career soldier in the British army who we follow through three 20th century wars. Within that is one of cinemas great love stories, the story of a man who lost his love before he even realized he had found it and who spends his whole life searching for the same and regretting his myopia. Also within that is the story of a remarkable friendship between two men which endures despite one stealing the others love and being on opposing sides of first a duel and then a war. It is undoubtedly these human elements which most affect me, but aside from a moving meditation on how the old and the young see each other what really charges the sentimentality with poise and aching poignancy to make magic out of potential mush are all the things these characters and their story represent  a lament for (and a critique of) the passing of late Victorian/Edwardian gentlemanly social values and civilization as it once was before World War One blew it away forever; a satire on the lingering remnants of this civilization which become reactionary, Blimpish and ultimately disposable if not downright dangerous; a trenchant commentary on the relationship between Britain and Germany running in tandem with the films central friendship; and a propaganda call to all Englishmen in 1943 to wake up and get realistic in the fight against Nazism wherein one should counter dirty fighting with the same and jettison out-moded notions of chivalry and the gentlemans code in recognition of the increasingly desperate fight for survival against tyranny. Taken collectively all of this adds up to a meditation on England and what it means to be English in the tumultuous fast-changing years of the first half of the 20th century. The film addresses the paradox of the English gentleman on one hand chivalrous, honorable and deeply decent, but on the other hand reactionary, old fashioned, stiff and unbending with dark pulsating romanticism surging under a very thick layer of traditional English reserve. Powell/Pressburgers articulate script manages to convey all the nuances clearly and precisely, with extraordinary wit and delirious fantasy which is matched throughout by the wonderful audio-visual treatment  Allan Grays stunning music score accompanying Alfred Junges amazing production designs and Georges P&eacute;rinals sumptuously textured Technicolor cinematography. On this last quality the film is something of a legend in the industry. It was certainly the best film made in the medium up till 1943, and I cant think of many films made since which come anywhere near equaling let alone surpassing it. A tonic for the brain and a feast for the senses  one cant ask more from a film. What follows contains spoilers.

The key to understanding Powell/Pressburgers greatest films is to grasp the dichotomy that exists between realism and fantasy. In later films (especially A Matter of Life and Death [1946] and Black Narcissus [1947]) this is rendered visual very obviously through the construction of clearly fantastical alternative realities which intertwine with reality to the extent that we cant distinguish one from the other. In A Matter of Life and Death heaven is shot in b/w and is shown to have many real qualities while earth is shot in colour and is shown to have many fantastical qualities. Like Peter Carter the audience is suspended midway between two worlds and unsure which is which. The dichotomy also exists in The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp. Although fantasy is visualized very clearly through artificial sets, a fairy tale recreation of pre-World War One Europe, the heroine (Deborah Kerr) cast as three separate characters and elaborate montage sequences to take us from one war to the next, it is most apparent for being personalized in the character of Clive Candy, aka the eponymous Colonel Blimp of the films title. Blimp was a cartoon caricature created by David Low who embodied everything that was reactionary and old fashioned about the British establishment in the years running up to World War Two. Blimpishness was said to still exist (indeed the reason why Churchill objected was probably the fact that he was a Blimp himself and took the film as a personal affront) and Powell/Pressburger decided to make it the subject of their film. Clive Candy is a gentleman raised and educated in Victorian Britain who believes that in peace and war life is a game of cricket with clearly defined rules and regulations which must never be defiled. It is a value system which seemed antiquated even in Clives youth (in 1902), but which is blown away completely by World War One. Dear old Clive still cant grasp the new reality or the new necessities of the inter-war years and continues to preach the gentlemans code which is increasingly revealed as nothing but pure fantasy. Lows Blimp was a ridiculous buffoon, a figure of fun, and so is Powell/Pressburgers Candy from start to finish, a walking fantastical anachronism suspended between two worlds just like Peter Carter, but with a crucial difference  he just doesnt get it and will never get it because of his breeding and a consequent total inability to adapt.

Where Powell/Pressburger part company with Low is in the fleshing out of their caricature from fantastical buffoon to warm, real and thoroughly lovable human being, and no character in British cinema is more lovable than Clive Candy. The dichotomy between reality and fantasy is right there before our eyes throughout in a wonderful sensitive performance by Roger Livesey. Powell/Pressburger make their reinvention of Lows caricature very apparent with the opening and closing sequences which bookend the films central elongated flashback narrative. The film opens with the reality of 1943 England where army units are planning a mock attack on London with the Home Guard providing the defense. One bright young officer named Spud (James McKechnie) uses information gleaned from his girlfriend Angela (Kerr) who is Candys driver. Candy is in command of the Home Guard and Spud figures to ignore the directive (War starts at midnight) and attack early Pearl Harbor-style. When we first meet Candy there is a comic droop on a trombone as we see him laid out in all his glory asleep in the sauna of his Turkish bath  bald pate, bay window stomach and handlebar mustache protruding, clad only in a towel. It is exactly how Low draws Blimp in his cartoons and his red-faced protestations confirm that here is a crusty old buffer, a man totally out of step with the times. Taking offence at Spuds personal remarks, a fistfight ensues with the pair falling into the bath. When Candy rises from the water we find we have flashed back to 1902 when he has just returned from the Boer War with the Victory Cross. The main body of the film is separated into three time periods, (1902 Berlin/London, 1918 Flanders, 1943 London) and through it we learn about this man and grow to love him so that when the film comes full circle and we arrive back in 1943 in the aftermath of his humiliation at the hands of Spud, there is a tremendous sense of pathos as he refuses to press charges to bring the upstart soldier to count and even announces his intention to invite him to dinner. His gentlemans code persists to the very last as he ruminates over the flooded remains of his house and his promise to his deceased wife Barbara (Kerr again) to stay the same until the floods come. He stares into the water and at the leaf afloat on it and says, Now here is the lake, and I still haven't changed. Here is a man who cant change even if he wants to. At the films beginning he is Lows fantastical buffoon pure and simple, a ridiculous figure of fun. At the end he is Powell/Pressburgers grand old man who we have come to understand and love, his buffoonery contextualized within a much wider ennobling sense of reality.

Throughout the main body of the narrative Powell/Pressburgers examination of Blimpishness proves to be immensely subtle and reverberates on all the films various levels. The first example comes soon after Candy leaves the Turkish bath and flies off to Berlin in chivalrous response to a ladys request to go there to deal with a certain Kaunitz (David Ward) who has been spreading anti-British propaganda about the Boer War. In direct defiance of his superiors Candy meddles in embassy matters and causes a diplomatic crisis in a caf&eacute; cum beer cellar when he punches Kaunitz saying, The German Imperial army ought to be ashamed of themselves [for dealing with him]. This is a classic example of the amateurism of the English gentleman which leads to a duel which need never have been fought between two people who don't even know each other  Candy and Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff (Anton Walbrook), the German officer drawn by lot to defend his armys impuned honor. In the run-up to Kaunitzs arrival in the caf&eacute; there is an important conversation between Edith (Kerr) and Candy in which the lady reveals herself to be a feminist, a suffragette and a very forward thinker. She talks about the Boer War saying, Good manners cost us Magerfontein, Stomberg and Colenso, 6,000 men killed and 20,000 wounded and two years of war when with a little common sense and bad manners there would have been no war at all. This connects forward immediately to Candys own diplomatic faux pas (he punches Kaunitz for spitting at him) and also on to the cause of World War One with Powell/Pressburger here saying that observation of good manners, the gentlemans code on all sides was a root cause of international problems involving England and her fellow Imperial powers with Blimpishness proving to be equally as pervasive within Prussian society as the insistance on duelling makes very clear. With Ediths insistence on womans rights to a life outside the home she rocks poor Candy who has never given the matter any thought until now, but unbeknown to him he is attracted by it. This is his chance to change, to keep hold of the changing times and renounce Blimpery. As Edith awaits the outcome of the duel in her carriage we sense she has feelings for him and when she has to take care of him in the nursing home (pretending to be his fianc&eacute;e) he has every chance to move on his intuition, but he doesnt. Candy being slow on the uptake, its only when Theo beats him to it and he is on the way back to London that he realizes what he has lost. Theo has taken the chance to seize the future through Edith, to advance beyond out-moded values and to live for the day while poor Candy is destined to remain a Blimp. Of course this dynamic comments also on how Germany progressed while England regressed with the friendship that emerges between Candy and Theo always stressing how much Candy (England) dwells in the past while Theo (Germany) stays very much alive to the present and what will happen in the future.

By World War One Candy is already verging on crusty old bufferdom and his clinging on to the gentlemans code proves completely useless in getting a group of German prisoners to talk. It is left to a South African officer to apply enemy methods which Candy would never countenance to get the needed information. Candy cuts a ridiculous figure in front of American soldiers especially when he values finding a meal over news that the war is soon to finish (!) and is escorted to a convent in the flooded-out sidecar of a motorbike. Then as if to prove his old fashioned values are correct he greets the news of the armistice with It means that right is might. After all [the bad things German soldiers have done] clean fighting [and] honest soldiering have won. This shows he is completely out of touch with the real situation. Germany lost the war because the home front caved in. The soldiers fighting on the front to a man never thought they had lost. Instead they felt betrayed by the acts of cowards back home. This was the stab in the back that Hitler later used to whip up support for his Nazi party. When Candy finds Theo in the POW camp he cant understand why he is snubbed, but the moving shot (to Mendelssohns Fingals Cave Overture) of the German soldiers all moving away from him en-masse shows Powell/Pressburger certainly do. One of the most interesting scenes comes when Candy brings an apologetic Theo to a dinner at his home where he is entertaining representatives of the entire British establishment and every man (except for the noticeably silent army officer who had run Theos POW camp) rallies around Theo with a deluge of Blimpery. To a man they all encourage him saying the war is over and Germany will be supported to get back on her feet, that a strong Germany is important for future trade, and that Germany has nothing to fear  We all want to be friends, they say. Theo of course is much more realistic about the dysfunction that runs within his own country and dismisses these assurances for the Blimpery they express - They are children  boys playing cricketThis childlike stupidity is a raft for us in a sea of despair. These words spoken in contempt to other German officers on the train going back to his country contain the origins of the birth of Nazism. Although Theo himself does not go down this root, his children and thousands of others do and it is Englands failure (together with the other allies) to properly deal with Germany in 1919 at Versailles that meant German militarism was set to return on a huge wave of public disenchantment with the failure of democracy in the doomed Weimar republic. The childish stupidity of the gentlemans code fed into the willfull blindness that was appeasement and the d&eacute;bcle of Munich 1938. In the immigration bureau in 1939 Theo is admonished for not leaving Germany until 1934, a full year after Hitler came to power to which he replies, Excuse me, but it took [England] five years.

The anachronism of dear old Clives value system is most rudely exposed by World War Two when the BBC axe a radio broadcast he was to make in 1940 titled, Dunkirk Before and After and he arrives home to find the army have retired him. He is deeply wounded and its left to his best friend Theo to explain. This long speech is crucial for the film on all its various levels and is worth quoting at length. Candy bemoans losing the chance to impart his own special knowledge to which Theo replies:

Its a different knowledge they need now. The enemys different so you have to be different tooYou said [in your speech] you despised the Nazis, that you would be ashamed to fight on their side and youd sooner accept defeat than victory if it could only be won by those methodsIf you let yourself be defeated by them just because you are too fair to hit back the same way they hit at you, there won't be any methods but Nazi methods. If you preach the rules of the game while they use every foul and filthy trick against you, theyll laugh at you. Theyll think you are weak, decadent. I thought so myself in 1919I don't think you won [WWI]. We lost it, but you lost something too. You forgot to learn the moral. Because victory was yours, you failed to learn your lesson 20 years ago. And now you have to pay the school fees again. Some of you will learn quicker than others. Some will never learn it. Because youve been educated to be a gentleman and sportsman in peace and in war, but Clive, dear Clive, this is not a gentlemans war. This time you are fighting for your very existence against the most devilish idea ever created by a human brain  Nazism. And if you lose there won't be a return match next year. Perhaps not for 100 years...Who can describe hydrophobia better than one whos been bitten and is now immune?

The words spell out very clearly Blimpishness taking its toll on friendships both between people (Theo and Candy) and countries (Germany and England). Clearest of all is the propaganda call to renounce the chivalry of the gentlemans code and fight Nazism with Nazi methods if necessary. Such a call should have pleased Churchill, but the problem is the call comes from the lips of a German character with the implication that the English are a nation of Blimps who need advice from the enemy to find the right way to go forward. Failing to distinguish (as Powell/Pressburger very carefully do) between Nazis and Germans, Churchill was incensed by the film, but fortunately for us all J. Arthur Rank stood firm, sent the bureaucrats packing and ensured the film received the widest possible release in his cinemas. It was tremendously bold of Powell/Pressburger to feature a good German on screen in 1943 and it continues a theme started in The Spy in Black (1939) and finished by Ill Met By Moonlight (1947). Most subtle of all in Theos words is the concluding reference to hydrophobia which refers back to the Fingals Cave episode at the POW camp and the sea of despair he mentions on the train in 1919. Like Theo forced out of the army in 1920 to take up a new profession (as a military chemist) in which old social codes have lost their relevence, Candy is also cast asea to find his own solution to the hydrophobia that now grips him. Pointedly Angela says that Candy has to start over like many others have had to do in the war  Its better than drowning, she says. It is Angela who suggests the Home Guard and this does absorb his energies, but of course his new career is not so different from his old one and he ends up with egg on his face yet again, a fantastical Blimp who has to rely on the reality checking of an enemy alien to the very end.

The film is a bighting critique of the old fogeyist British establishment and Candy is an object for ridicule throughout just as Low intended his caricature to be, but Powell/Pressburger go much further than that. They attack their target mercilessly for sure, but they also celebrate him, and in doing so they get at the paradox that lies at the very center of Englishness. The keynote of this celebration is struck by the opening credits presented over a tapestry meant to recall the Bayeaux Tapestry which presents the whole film as a kind of historical legend or pageant. Of the films three time frames, the 1902 sequence in London and Berlin is by far the longest, taking up almost half of the films total timespan and its notable for the bright and breezy presentation of the lithe young British soldier Candy flying off to Berlin to aid his damsel in distress. The portrayal of high society is garish to the point of caricature especially in the caf&eacute; scene replete with grand chandeliers and orchestra playing Viennese waltzes. Costumes are all vividly coloured especially the army uniforms  reds for the British and blues for the Prussians with even the orchestra members done up extravagantly like enlarged toy soldiers. The ladies also receive extraordinary frocks which seem to drown the poor creatures in ridiculous drapery  most eye-catching is the dead crow pinned to Ediths hat. The way characters shout at each other in manic fashion, the scuffle that causes the duel, the duel itself and the extended high spirits of the nursing home where Candy and Theo cement their friendship sends up the ridiculous customs of the time attacking the archaic codes of honour that lie behind them, but it also evinces a rapture held by the filmmakers for everything we see, the evocation of a glorious milieu about to slide into oblivion perfectly captured. Most telling of all is the way the duel is handled with great attention paid to the build up, but when Candy and Theo face off and get down to it the camera is uninterested. Instead it soars up, dissolves through the roof to reveal snow falling on a deliberately fake Berlin skyline. The camera then swoops down and through the window of Ediths waiting carriage. Here Candy and Theo are completely unimportant beside the fairy tale presentation of an old world, an old civilization with its old rules where reckless duelling is the height of honor and every soldier worthy of the name dashes off to foreign places to protect a ladys honor. The film criticizes this world to be sure, but it celebrates it with a swaggering sense of nostalgic love for something that is now long gone.

Powell/Pressburger keep the witty up-tempo alive with the hilarious montage depiction of time passing between 1902 and 1918 in which the stuffed heads of animals shot on Candys hunting expeditions explode onto the blank spaces of his home. Frightfully un-pc now, the sequence remains the funniest and the most outrageous in any Powell/Pressburger film. In Flanders we meet Candys aide and future butler Murdoch (John Laurie) whose running commentary with Candy keeps things light and witty, but the celebration of old English values is taken up again most movingly of all in the long and highly important speech Theo makes to the immigration bureau in 1939. In a scene which is developed somewhat from a similar scene in 49th Parallel (1941) which has Anton Walbrook quietly defending democracy in a long unbroken take, Theo (Walbrook again of course) gives us the truth for why he is now seeking asylum in England  that he is homesick for his wifes home country and we hear his sad history, of how Hitler took away his two children, how his wife Edith died just as he was about to leave Germany for England and how he stumbled on the very same nursing home in Berlin where he met his best friend and his future wife back in 1902. In his words he also talks about the dinner in 1919 in Candys home where it seemed to him that everyone was behaving like children, but which now he accepts as the genuine gestures of good will from a group of people who were thinking wholly of his interests. Therein lies the paradox of the gentlemans code, the fact that in one sense it is stifling, reactionary or Blimpish, but in another sense it is charming, warm and thoroughly decent. This decency is what Theo is returning to from a country where the gangsters have put the innocent people in jail, and it marks out Candy who personifies the paradox exactly.

Also part of the paradox is a certain buttoned-down romanticism which distinguishes an Englishman from other Europeans. This is shown early on by Candys decision to hide his scar with a mustache where a Prussian would flaunt it publically. This sense of English reserve gets greatest expression by the way Candys love for Edith is treated. He knows he has missed the chance to capture his ideal and spends the rest of his life searching for that same beauty in other women, the point being that he may find other women who resemble Edith almost exactly, but they will never actually be Edith and so his search implies a sense of futility. Powell/Pressburger were inspired in their decision to cast Deborah Kerr in three roles as the eternal feminine and the three scenes where love is sensed most strongly are among the most exquisite moments of the film. The first has Candy kissing Edith in congratulations on her engagement to Theo. In Liveseys startled look we sense the beginning of love, and also Kerrs paralysed expression tells us she is not unaware of it either. Then in 1918 theres the moment in the convent when Candy sees Barbara for the first time and his breath is literally taken away to the point that in England he organzies a ball in Yorkshire to find her. She is a trophy wife and knows it as shown by insisting he put her portrait on the wall of his den among the other heads he has conquered. Most moving of all for me is that moment in the car when Theo recognizes Candys love (and his own deceased wife!) in the face of the driver Angela. Her name derives from the word angel and here we have the romantic notion of the spirit of Edith returning in Angelas form. Theos recognition is heartbreaking at this point. Theres a touching scene preceding this where Candy tells Theo he has never gotten over his love for Edith which prompts Theo to say, I never thought it possible an Englishman could be so romantic. The same could be said for both Powell and Pressburger of course. Both men poured much that was personal into this film. Powell and Kerr fell in love behind the scenes and his own cocker spaniels make their usual appearance. For Pressburger however this film always remained his favorite and we can be sure that Theo sitting in the immigration bureau speaks the very same words he himself said or would have liked to have said when he came to England as a refugee from Nazi Germany, and its no coincidence that Angela is also the name of his very own daughter. This film is intensely romantic in a way perhaps no English film had ever been before it and the films that followed (especially A Canterbury Tale [1944], I Know Where Im Going! [1945] and The Red Shoes [1948]) would be imbued with the same wild romanticism buttoned down (and often exploding out of) that traditional English reserve. Powell often joked about the number of foreigners behind the making of this quintessentially English film. As an Englishman living in Japan I can appreciate that perhaps it needed an outsiders perspective to really get to the core of the paradox of the English condition. There is no finer film on this subject.",1494288000,3,26921,4.746794871794871

The fact is, the British Army was responsible for putting the civilian population in concentration camps, resulting in the deaths/murder of 20K women and children.

279962,5,6300256073,"I LOVED this 1943 drama/romance/war film! It impressed and enchanted me. I don't have words strong enough to praise it. Below more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.

The film begins somewhere around 1942 I think, with an old gentleman, Major-General Clive Wynne-Candy (Roger Livesey), a senior commander in Home Guard, taking some rest in Turkish bath before an important military exercise, which is supposed to start the next day. However, even if ""War starts at midnight"", a young hot shot lieutenant decides to break the rules and strike pre-emptively, capturing the old general when he wears nothing except his birthsuit. Terribly humiliated, general Wynne-Candy gets into a fight with the young officer - as they fall into water, we go back 40 years, to a time when a young hot shot lieutenant named Clive Candy, who distinguished himself in Boer War, just returned to England... And then the film really begins and takes us on a wonderful, albeit also frequently tragic, voyage through 40 years of life and service of an officer and gentleman, until it brings us finally back to the ""Turkish Bath Pre-emptive Strike of 1942""...)))

This film is such a wonderful masterpiece that it is even hard to decide where to begin the praise, however, after some reflexion I believe that the greatest treasure is the scenario. Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger based their film on a cartoon, which mocked mercilessly conservative British old-timers, symbolised by a certain Colonel Blimp, an overweight fellow commenting and lecturing (with utmost stupidity) on political and social events, always wearing for all clothes a towel wrapped around his prominent belly, as all conversations invariably took place in a Turkish bath Their great idea was however to take such a character and go back in time, to show him in his youth and then follow him all the way until the time when he achieved full Blimp-ness. The result is one of the most wonderful and touching life stories ever

Casting was perfect, simply perfect. Roger Livesey did an amazing job, as well as Anton Walbrook, who plays Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff, German alter ego of Clive Candy, who for most of this film is simultaneously his enemy, rival, opponent  and best friend But it is Deborah Kerr who completes this film and makes it into such a masterpiece. She plays here three different women, but I cannot say anything more, because it would be revealing too much. I made some calculations and I realised that this was the 9th film with her that I saw  and she always was perfect in all of them

This is a long film (163 minutes), because Major-General Clive Wynne-Candy lived a long and well filled life. I guarantee however that you will not see the time passing, as there is not even one scene too much.

Churchill hated this film for some reason and even tried to stop its distribution, but I honestly would be at a loss to explain why, because this is not only a tribute but in fact a LOVE SONG for Merry Old England, conservatives, soldiers, patriotism, aged gentlemen, fair-play, hunting, love and marriage, honour, good liquor, stiff upper lip, Empire and general Britishness - and also Turkish baths))) All of it bathing (sorry, I couldn't resist) in clever, intelligent, wonderful, kind and very gentle but nevertheless absolutely omnipresent humour. The main character himself is incredibly attaching, even more so if you pay attention to one detail which is never explicitly explained  when he was a young lieutenant, his name was Clive Candy, but later at one moment he changes his name into Clive Wynne-Candy. When I noticed that and realised WHY EXACTLY he did it, well, I had tears in my eyes

There is one and only one thing in this film which I didn't like and it was the treatment of Boer War. In 1902 Lieutenant Clive Candy goes to Germany to defend the honour of England after German Press started a campaign of denunciation of alleged British war crimes. Well, the problem is that Germans, this one time, were right on money! British troops indeed committed horrible atrocities against Boer civilians and prisoners of war and those crimes included the creation of first concentration camps in history! Now, I understand that it wasn't something one could say on the screen when the nation was fighting a merciless, total war  but still, it is a very dark spot on an otherwise PERFECT thing!

Bottom line, this is a wonderful film, a real treasure of world cinema and an incredibly beautiful, touching, moving, amusing and occasionally heart-breaking thing. I am definitely not a young girl (and not even a girl  and not exactly even young anymore for that matter) but still, there were moments during this film when I had tears in my eyes.

Considered by many to be the finest British film ever made, The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp, by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, is a stirring masterpiece like no other. Roger Livesey dynamically embodies outmoded English militarism as the indelible General Clive Candy, who barely survives four decades of tumultuous British history, 1902 to 1942, only to see the world change irrevocably before his eyes. Anton Walbrook and Deborah Kerr provide unforgettable support, he as a German enemy turned lifelong friend of General Clive Candy's and she as young women of three consecutive generations and a socially committed governess, a sweet-souled war nurse, and a modern-thinking army driver who inspire him. Colonel Blimp is both moving and slyly satirical, an incomparable film about war, love, aging, and obsolescence, shot in gorgeous Technicolor.

FILM FACT: Winston Churchill, never gave up in his ban, especially refusing to let `The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp' be exported to other countries until two years after the war ended, at which point it was only shown in a highly edited form. Audiences in the U.S.A. didn't see the film as Michael Powell intended it to be seen until some 40 years later. By then, of course, Winston Churchill had passed away, although he may have made one or two rotations in his grave upon Colonel Blimp's glorious reception by the critics. Making their second appearance in The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp were director Michael Powell's golden cocker spaniels, Erik and Spangle, who had previously appeared in Contraband [1940], and went on to be seen in the Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger films I Know Where I'm Going! [1945] and A Matter of Life and Death [USA Title: Stairway to Heaven, 1946].

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: British filmmaker Michael Powell is probably best known in the United States for directing the cherished ballet melodrama, The Red Shoes [1948], a picture that many consider to be his greatest work. But Americans shouldn't be too surprised that Michael Powell and his producing partner, Emeric Pressburger. Their other masterpiece, The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp [1943], was the subject of considerable scorn in England when it was first released, even though British were the only viewers who seemed truly capable of grasping its stiff-upper-lip form of satire.

As is so often the case with a Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger film, The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp boasts stellar production values. Michael Powell shot the picture in glorious Technicolor, a genuine rarity during the war years, since Technicolor film stock was so hard to come by. Although Colonel Blimp features a terrific cast, cinematographer Georges Prinal's vibrant Technicolor imagery adds greatly to the picture's overall effectiveness. He was a hugely talented visual stylist.

Set over a period of several years, The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp follows the exploits of a British Army officer named General Clive Candy [Roger Livesey]. In a manner that's somewhat reminiscent of Citizen Kane [1941], Michael Powell jumps around in the narrative as he examines General Clive Candy's often dismayingly dignified approach to both war and romance. General Clive Candy ages from a young participant in the Boer War into a conservative member of the Old Guard, all while pining for his one true love [Deborah Kerr, portraying three different characters]. Along the way, Michael Powell also traces General Clive Candy's ongoing relationship with a Prussian military officer Anton Walbrook.

Those who are young, eventually become old. It's an unshakeable inevitability of life, and it's rarely a painless process. Forced to watch the world grow and evolve around us, some choose to embrace the changing tides; while others instead hold firm to the past, stubbornly maintaining faded principles in the face of ambiguous progress. But even the most proud and obstinate of personalities can't fight off the looming shadow of approaching obsolescence forever, or can they? Those who are young eventually become old.

A genuine masterpiece of filmmaking, the picture holds a secure place among the medium's most treasured classics, proving that some so called relics never become outdated.

Very loosely inspired by David Low's original Colonel Blimp comic strips, the story follows the life of General Clive Candy [Roger Livesey], a traditional British soldier who gradually finds himself out of sync with shifting wartime philosophies. Told in a flashback structure, the narrative chronicles General Clive Candy's misadventures from 1902  1942, periodically checking in on the incorrigible gentlemen as he navigates growing British/German hostilities and two World Wars. All the while, General Clive Candy maintains a deep friendship with a German officer [Anton Walbrook], and continues to pine over a lost love [Deborah Kerr] whose face he repeatedly sees in different women throughout his life. With the old ""chivalrous"" modes of warfare being phased out, General Clive Candy will eventually have to change with the times, or finally accept his tragically and sometimes comically obsolete status.

Critics often speak of certain actors being born to play specific roles, and in the case of Roger Livesey's remarkable turn as General Clive Candy, that sentiment has never been more appropriate. One of classic cinemas most unique and memorable creations, the character is a headstrong, old fashioned relic whose persona brilliantly walks the fine line between satirical distortion and endearing sincerity. Bawdy and refined all at once, General Clive Candy comes to represent the whole of a dying breed, and Roger Livesey injects the epic role with a larger-than-life bluster that's perfectly counteracted by a surprising undercurrent of sensitive pathos.

Playing the part in three distinct time periods, the actor crafts a convincing, gradual transformation that hits all the right transitional beats. Everything from his distinct voice to the very way he carries himself, is flawlessly honed in to accentuate the role's impetuous elegance and gallant sense of outdated honour and his growing moustache, receding hairline, and expanding belly (all realized by some great make-up), only serve to further embellish the man's strong internal flair. Admittedly, when we first meet the character, already an old man, his look and manner seem exaggerated and over-the-top, but by the time the flashback structure comes full circle, Roger Livesey totally sells the performance, effectively revealing the beating heart that rests beneath General Clive Candy's farcical outer shell. A lesser actor may have overplayed the part, but Roger Livesey so effortlessly steps into the General's shoes, that it seems as if they were tailor made for him to begin with and as guided by the masterful hands of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, the results are nothing short of iconic.

At the core of the runtime is an insightful examination of evolving (or perhaps devolving) battlefield strategies, pitting classic ""gentlemanly"" British militarism against the decidedly less honourable tactics of the first and second World Wars. An old soldier in the midst of a new kind of conflict, General Clive Candy refuses to let go of his increasingly anachronistic principles, and this leads to some legitimately provocative questions. The narrative's key thematic quandary challenges the protagonist's idealistic concept of ""right is might"" and forcing the character, and the audience, to consider a less admirable approach. If the opposition is unwilling to play by the so-called rules of engagement, must one then fight like the enemy in order to survive?

There are of course no easy answers, and this plot point actually proved to be very controversial during the film's production in 1942. In fact, the script generated heated opposition from the British military who did not take kindly to the implication that they might have to fight like Nazis in order to win the war. It's a complicated and morally ambiguous issue, and while the old-fashioned, broad storytelling style does limit some of the screenplay's depth and nuance, Emeric Pressburger handles the material with a skilful hand, and balances these weighty concepts with light-hearted farce and poignant humanity.

Expanding its range beyond just warfare, the movie also becomes a playful satire focused on the amusing minutia of manners and protocol. Through an elegant silliness, the filmmakers cleverly poke fun at the inherent absurdities of polite conflict. Furthering this end, Emeric Pressburger's dialogue is full of hilariously dry observations and densely packed, witty conversations. As a whole, a certain prim and proper quirkiness permeates throughout the runtime, and even the most minor characters are all layered with a sly sense of sardonic personality.

The film's influential duel scene is a particularly good example of this sharp satirical style. As General Clive Candy gets ready to do battle against a German soldier he has offended, his superiors meet the opposition to discuss the complicated ins and outs of their duel. While both parties go over the ridiculous rules and regulations, they maintain an almost absurd level of cordial civility, discussing the potentially deadly conflict as if they've merely gotten together for tea and crumpets. Likewise, the actual preparation for the battle follows in similar suit, and after showing an extended sequence detailing the pre-duel rituals, Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger then completely subvert expectations by quickly transitioning away from the actual fight. The filmmakers realise that the battle itself isn't what's interesting; it's the complicated groundwork and paradoxical courtesy that's really fascinating and incredibly entertaining.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, is a quietly staged scene that features a soft spoken monologue beautifully delivered by Anton Walbrook. As Theo mourns over his great losses, Powell opts to present a large chunk of the sequence as one undisturbed shot, gracefully pushing the camera in and out to emphasize the emotional arc of the character's words. It's a carefully understated bit of direction that subtly enhances the mood, while still allowing Anton Walbrook's heart-breaking performance to take centre stage. The movie is littered with similarly delicate or alternatively brash stylistic choices, and together they help to create an irresistible sense of motion picture wonder.

Widely revered as one of the greatest British films of all time, 'The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp' easily lives up to its lofty reputation. A melancholy lamentation on changing times, a thoughtful rumination on war-time ethics, a touching romance, a hilarious satire, and a thoroughly ambitious character study all rolled into one stunning Technicolor marvel, this really is one of cinema's crown jewels. General Clive Candy is a masterful creation, and Roger Livesey delivers a performance so assured in its blustery bravado and heart-warming intimacy, that it feels both larger-than-life and perfectly natural all at once. Through the decades spanning tale of a stubborn general's trials and tribulations in love and war, the film tells the epic story of a young fool who becomes a grand old man or perhaps, a grand young man who becomes an old fool. After all, in Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's charmingly satirical world, I'm not so sure that there's a difference.

Winston Churchill, who detected a lot of himself in the Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger version of Colonel Blimp, was outraged by the film. Given the gentle handling of Anton Walbrook's character, there was even concern that the picture was pro-German! Winston Churchill's Minister of War, Sir James Grigg, tried to nip the entire enterprise in the bud, when after reading the screenplay, he refused to loan Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger any form of military gear for filming. That however didn't stop the producers. As Michael Powell later wrote in his autobiography: ""I have often been asked how we managed to obtain military vehicles, military uniforms, weapons and all the fixings after being refused help by the War Office and the Ministry of Information. The answer is quite simple: we acquired them by whatever means possible"" Apparently, Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger had enough friends in high places to scrounge together everything they needed to make the film.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The Life and Times of Colonel Blimp is presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.37:1. On widescreen televisions, black bars will appear on the left and right of the image to maintain the proper screen format. The digital master presented here was made from The Foundations 2012 restoration. For the restoration, the original 35mm three-strip Technicolor negatives were scanned at 4K resolution on an Imagica wetgate scanner at Point360 in Los Angeles, California. But I can tell you that the 1080p image transfer is absolutely stunning and is remarkably pristine, very fine detail, and vibrant, this is a very impressive and wonderfully faithful video presentation. The print has been painstakingly restored, and outside of some very minor specks and colour pulsing here and there, the source is nearly immaculate. In fact, there are several stretches (particularly the opening motorcycle scene) that appear so spotless and clear that they almost look like they could have been shot yesterday. Though not as prominent as I was expecting, a very light layer of grain has been preserved. If DNR was applied to the image, its use was judicious, and has not resulted in any negative detail damaging side effects.

From the moment the film begins, it's readily apparent that one is in for a real visual treat. The main title sequence depicts a series of sewn tapestries, and the image proves to be impeccably rendered, revealing every tiny thread of needlework in the textiles. From there, clarity remains strong and consistent throughout, delivering the Archers' gorgeous visuals with life-like dimension. Fine details are often so apparent, that limitations in the production's make-up and effects are actually exposed (one can clearly see the pasted on edges of Roger Livesey's receding wig, for instance). The Technicolor cinematography shines beautifully, with rich saturation and bold primaries and especially the reds and blues. With that said, there are a few scenes that look comparatively dull and faintly washed-out. Contrast is steady throughout, with inky blacks and even whites (though the final shot is a little blown out). As further enumerated in the included restoration demonstration, the Film Foundation has really done a brilliant and astounding job here. Damage has been dutifully cleaned away while still preserving the movie's cinematic integrity, repairing this timeless classic back to its original vibrant glory. While there are some very minor flaws here and there, this is a true standout release, and pure demo material for classic cinema on Blu-ray. And if you have always been curious to know what a real Technicolor image is like, well this is definitely up there at the top and you would think the film was made in the 21st Century, it is that stunning.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The audio soundtrack was digitally restored from the original monaural optical soundtrack by Audio Mechanics in Burbank, California. It is presented in a 1.0 LPCM Mono Audio track with optional English subtitles. Though limited by its age, this is a very solid mix that's free from any major technical issues. For the most part, dialogue is clean and reasonably full. Likewise, effects work and music are handled well within the single channel, maintaining a proficient dynamic range. With that said, when there is a lot activity in the track, there are a few instances where frequencies start to muddle together a bit, making speech just a hair difficult to discern. This is particularly true of an early scene between General Clive Candy and Edith in a caf where some of the background sounds can make it a tad hard to hear their conversation. Thankfully, this is a very minor concern, and the majority of the presentation is quite strong for its age. Background hissing is audible in the main title sequence and several scenes throughout, but does not prove to be a major distraction. Modest but technically sound, the mix is faithful and fitting, preserving the film's sharp dialogue and wistfully romantic musical theme.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

NEW digital master from the Film Foundation's 2012 4K restoration, with uncompressed monaural soundtrack on the Blu-ray edition.

Audio Commentary: Commentary featuring director Michael Powell and filmmaker Martin Scorsese: Recorded in 1988, this is a welcome but not quite exceptional track. The audio transitions from Scorsese to Powell throughout, but sadly they appear to have been recorded separately, and there is no actual back and forth between the two. Scorsese elaborates on his great love for the movie while frequently analysing the director's visual style and influence on his own works. Powell actually takes over the brunt of the commentary, and while his speech is slow and a tad slurred and he was 83 at the time and sadly would pass away just two years later. The famed filmmaker offers relevant bits of production trivia, describes how certain shots were accomplished, commends his various collaborators, and points out the amusing hats that Deborah Kerr wears. He also addresses the British government's opposition toward the film, and talks mostly of their concerns up to misunderstanding. There are a few lengthy gaps in the track, but it's still a worthwhile and enlightening listen.

Special Feature: Introduction by Martin Scorsese [2012] 1080p] [16:9] [14:00] Presented with 2.0 Dolby Digital audio sound, this is a video introduction with filmmaker Martin Scorsese that was recorded in 2012. After a quick preamble, Martin Scorsese launches straight into production trivia, detailing the casting process and the difficulties that arose due to the British government's resistance to the script. The film's various butchered edits are also addressed, and Martin Scorsese shares a story about how the film's famous duelling scene directly inspired an important sequence in 'Raging Bull.'

Special Feature Documentary: A Profile of The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp [2000] [1080i] [24:00] Presented in an upscale image, and this is a documentary produced in 2000 that chronicles the film's production and impact. Participants include filmmaker and grandson of Emeric Pressburger, Kevin Macdonald ['The Last King of Scotland'], and actor Stephen Fry, who all discuss the film's characters, plot, and style. Legendary cinematographer Jack Cardiff, who served as a second unit cameraman on the shoot, is also featured, and reveals how his work on the film's famous trophy head sequence got him the job as DP on the Archers' next film.

Special Feature: Restoration Demonstration [1080p] [16:9] [5:00] Here, Martin Scorsese returns to walk us through the picture's impressive restoration. The filmmaker discusses the original Technicolor process and then details the digital techniques used to repair the source prints. Before and after shots are also shown, revealing the hefty damage, wear, and other visual anomalies that were carefully cleaned away.

Special Feature: Optimism and Sheer Will [1080p] [29:00] In this lengthy and informative interview recorded in 2012, Academy Award winning editor and widow of Michael Powell, Thelma Schoonmaker, describes how she met the director and discusses the film's long-lasting themes.

Special Feature: Stills Gallery [1080p] Featuring an extensive gallery of rare production stills, behind-the-scenes production stills, and promotional materials is included. Some relevant facts and bits of trivia are also provided in between the various images.

Special Feature: David Low's Colonel Blimp [1080p] Two galleries, titled ""David Low and Colonel Blimp"" and ""Cartoons,"" offer examples of cartoonist David Low's original Colonel Blimp comic strips, which served as a very loose inspiration for the film.

BONUS: A beautiful 26 page booklet, which contains cast and crew lists, some beautiful colour stills from the film, and featuring a new essay on ""The Life and Death and Life of Colonel Blimp"" by critic Molly Haskell, who gives a celebratory essay on the very in-depth information and especially on the background of this 1943 masterpiece, and will give you lots of valuable insights, especially with this extra excellent written material.

Finally, this new Blu-ray edition of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp doesn't just miraculously restore the visual beauty of this great film (perhaps as great, in its own very British way, as Citizen Kane did in America). It also comes loaded with context that reminds us of its decades-long slog through the desert of severe, sloppy editing-down and messy, incomplete, technically deficient prints, reminding us how fortunate we are to have it at all, let alone in a version as complete and gorgeous as this. The film itself is, of course, a treasure and the intimate-epic story of General Clive Candy (the wonderful over the top Roger Livesey), one representative scion of a stiff-upper-lipped, ultra-civil Englishness who ever more clueless and touchingly, maintains those values through two World Wars that prove (or at least render) them obsolete, all while he pursues his Ideal Woman (Deborah Kerr, in three roles) and becomes unlikely, lifelong friends with the ""enemy"" in the form of his less-fortunate German opposite number Anton Walbrook. This was Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's first Technicolour film, and its supremely well-integrated and imaginative use of the Technicolor images and such, that it's hard to decide whether its look, the cleverness and affectionate humour around the principled but blowhard-ish Colonel, and its surprise layers of deep emotional impact, or its brilliant structure, and definitely done not for show, but to most effectively bring out and develop the senses of melancholy and loss that come with the passing of time over a whole life) are its highest achievement. What is certain, though, is that whether you appreciate one of those qualities more on this viewing and another of its many accomplishments on the next, there will always be a happily anticipated next time watching it for as long as you're around to revisit the classic films in your collection, of which this Blu-ray is an essential part. The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp is a long-lived masterpiece whose riches at every level are well-nigh inexhaustible. On top of all that, I never really got to see this either in the cinema or on British Television, especially with this type of film; they always put it on a Sunday afternoon. Well I am so glad I waited for this ultimate Criterion Blu-ray disc, as it is the most awesome Technicolor film I have seen in a very long time, apart from the awesome my 3D Blu-ray presentation of `The Wizard of Oz.' So if you want to see perfection of not only amazing stunning images, but also the first class English and European Actors, so much so I am so proud I have now added this to my ever increasing The Criterion Collection Blu-ray library, as I know you will get a 100% perfection, that will blow you away. Very Highly Recommended!

280008,5,6300256073,"I think I first heard of this movie in the 60s. I'd never seen it untill now. I'd always somehow confused Roger Livesey with Nigel Bruce of Sherlock Holmes. I don't know exactly the bent of the movie. I guess there are many theories. On the face of it, the movie seems to be trying to explain that the old general Wynne Candie, played charmingly by Roger Livesy, was himself young and brash once upon a time, like all young soldiers and much more complex  than he might appear in his old age. Deborah Kerr is at her most charming as the object of his and Anton Walbrook's affection. And between Walbrook, who plays a german officer and Livesey, the concept of modern warfare versus the art of fair play is explored into the entire movie. There is a lot happening, but the result is a wonderful movie. I've never seen Anton Walbrook playing a sympathetic character before. It's good to see him smile for a change, and of course Roger Livesey seems to have been born to  play a sincere and loveable old school englishman, a  type probably being shallowly denigrated in those days, as is the way of history. Maybe that is a large thrust of the movie.  In the usa, the Boer  War was barely ever mentioned. And of course this movie was made in the middle of wwll, while Britain was in turmoil. I don't know where it was actually filmed, but it is one of the most uplifting I've seen.",1387584000,3,1378,4.3882352941176475

It tells the story of a pompous old English Colonel near the end of his days in flashbacks to his youth and how he got to be where he was when we first see him.  Solid performance throughout the cast with a great script.  By the time the film gets to the present time in the story you have much more sympathy with the old boy and how he got into his situation.

By The Great Filmmaker Martin Scorsese, Who Speaks So Fondly Of This Film & Especially ""The Red Shoes""
Another Masterpiece By The Archers.

But ""The Life And Death Of Colonel Blimp""(1943) Is Not Only ""The Greatest British Film Ever Made""
As Many Have Said. But I For One Believe That This Brilliant Work Of Art Is Is Not Only The Greatest
British Film, But ""The Greatest Film Ever Made"" In Any Country In The Entire History Of Film.
I Have Seen Thousands Of Films From The Silent Era To The Modern Era, 2013 At The Time Of Writing.
I Have Amassed A Enormous Collection Of Films On DVD & Blu-Ray, Including ""The Red Shoes""(1948)
And ""Black Narcissus""(1947) Released By The Criterion Collection.

But Having Seen This Film On Blu-Ray, Restored By The Film Foundation With Consultation From
Martin Scorsese & Thelma Schoonmaker Powell.
And Watched It Four Times In A Row, I Can Honestly Say That ""The Life And Death Of Colonel Blimp""
Is Undoubtedly The Finest Film I Have Ever Seen.

Writing A Review Of This Film Is Not Easy, Because It Is Unlike Any Other Film i Have Ever Seen
It Stands Completely On Its Own , All The Performances Are Perfect, Roger Livesey Give One Of The Great Performances Of British Cinema, Anton Walbrook Is Remarkable, And Anyone Who Has Seen Him In ""The Red Shoes"" As Well As This Film Will Agree, My Favorite Performance In The Film Is By The Lovely & Talented
Deborah Kerr, Just Twenty Years Old At The Time Of Filming, Miss Kerr Plays Three Different Women & She
Plays Them Wonderfully. The Mark Of A Great Actor Is The Ability To Transform Oneself Into Another Person, And Deborah Kerr Does Just That Absolutely Perfectly, Not Once, Not Twice, But Three Times!

Michael Powell & Emeric Pressburger Are Responsible For Some Of The Most Beautiful Films Ever Made,
""A Matter Of Life And Death""(1946), ""Black Narcissus""(1947), ""The Red Shoes""(1948), Among Others

& Martin Scorsese Is Responsible For Reviving Interest In Their Work, And Indeed For Making Me Aware Of
Their Films, For That I Am Eternally Grateful.

In Conclusion To My Long Winded Review, I Would Just Like To Reaffirm My Statement:

""The Life And Death Of Colonel Blimp"" Is The Greatest Film i Have Ever Seen""

280045,5,6300256073,"This might be the best ""war"" movie ever produced.  It follows the life of a Brit through the early 20th century and poses the issue of what should be allowed in war.

The acting & amazing cinematography was outstanding - the movie really deserves to be one of the all time classics - the camera angles were superb in many parts and almost like something Hitchcock might have done.

280082,5,6300256073,"Roger Ebert called it ""The best British film ever made"". David Mamet calls it his favorite film from England. Martin Scorcese names it among his all time favorite films. It took a few viewings (on my first viewing I honestly wasn't that impressed) but after repeated viewings it soon became my favorite film from England as well (various friends wanted to see it once they knew I had a copy--and thank god I was forced to sit through it again because it eventually cast it's incredible spell over me too) . The film is filled with such an abundance of subtleties that you don't (can't) really pick most of them up the first time through--but once you do, the film literally carries you away with it.

I had seen the film originally on Criterion LaserDisc, then on Criterion DVD (much better than the Janus Films DVD version), but the new Criterion Bluray is an absolute revelation! The colors are spectacular (I had no idea that the film was so masterfully shot), the image quality is fantastically sharp with an amazing absence of grain or noise. I give the restoration and bluray release 5 stars on a scale of 1-5. If you are already a fan of this incredible film you MUST see this bluray! It was made from the recently restored version and it is so magnificent as to be nearly beyond belief. The improvement is so dramatic that I'll go so far as to say: If you haven't seen this version, then you haven't ever really seen this film!

Colonel Blimp covers the life of a British officer from the the Boar War through WWII, as the Victorian world and way of fighting a ""gentleman's war"" gives way to modern values and, most importantly, modern ways of fighting. It's about the young versus the old; about love, life, changing times, changes of thinking, changes of values--honestly, the more times I see it, the more I see in it.

280087,5,6300256073,"They were the dynamic duo of cinema in the 1940s.  Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, men who would be known for films such as ""49th Parallel"", ""A Matter of Life and Death"" and masterpieces such as ""Black Narcissus"", ""The Red Shoes"" and ""The Tales of Hoffman"".

Where many films by Powell and Pressburger were enjoyed by cinema fans, their 1943 film, ""The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp"" was a film that was heavily criticized for its sympathetic presentation to a German officer during World War II time.

While Powell and Pressburger had featured German characters in films such as ""The Spy is Black"" and ""49th Parallel"", the film was a source of controversy as E.W. and M.M. Robson of the Sidneyan Society called the film, ""A highly elaborate, flashy, flabby and costly film, the most disgraceful production that has ever emanated from a British film studio"".

While the New York Times called the film ""as unmistakable a British product as Yorkshire pudding and, like the latter, it has a delectable savor all its own"".

But the idea of the film was born from a scene of the film ""One of Our Aircraft is Missing"" in which an elderly member of the crew tells the younger one, ""You don't know what it's like to be old"".  And when filmmaker (then editor) David Lean suggested it to Michael Powell, the premise of the conversation was worthy to be made into a film.

But like many films that were either controversial or not big at the box office, Powell and Pressburger's ""The Life Death of Colonel Blimp"" was a film that became highly successful during its re-release 40-years later and since the '80s, the film has since received critical acclaim and is considered as a masterpiece of British cinema.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp"" is featured in color (1:37:1 aspect ratio) and is presented in monaural.  It's important to note that if you want the best picture and audio quality for this film, the Blu-ray release is the way to go.  As for this 2013 DVD release, what people can expect in differences between this version and the older 2002 DVD release is better picture quality and more special features.

For one, the restoration for the film that was conducted in 2012 features better color and the blurring that was evident on the older release is no longer a problem.  The picture quality is much clearer, much better clarity. I know the Blu-ray is the best version of this film right now, but for those who are still looking towards the DVD release, you should be happy to know that colors are robust, picture quality is literally pristine and no signs of damages, scratches, specks or debris.

Even the soundtrack has no signs of hiss, clicks or pops.  The restoration of audio is fantastic!

According to the Criterion Collection, The digital master presented here was made from the Film Foundation's 2012 restoration.  For the restoration, the original 35 mm three-strip Technicolor negatives were scanned at 4K resolution on an Imagica wetgate scanner at Point360 in Los Angeles.

The soundtrack was digitally restored from the original monaural optical soundtrack by Audio mechanics in Burbank, California.

EXTRAS:

JUDGMENT CALL:

The reason why ""The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp"" has become a part of my life, is it is a film I can reflect on every ten years and to know how the character of Clive Kandy really feels.

The last time I have watched this film was my 2002 Criterion Collection DVD and at the time, I saw the film as a Powell and Pressburger masterpiece on storytelling, cinematography and wonderful acting.  Classic British cinema that was no doubt ahead of its time.

But here we are in 2013, where we have a superior version of ""The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp"" on Blu-ray and DVD, a new release with more special features and picture and audio quality that surpasses the 2002 DVD release by such a longer margin.  There is no doubt that the film is the best version that is available at this moment but probably will be for quite a long time.

But I have watched this film now, five times in a matter of three days.  One probably to be in awe of how magnificent the film looks after its 2012 restoration but the other times, it was more of a realization that I am now at an age where I understand Clive Kandy.

Younger people have no idea what it is to be old, which is logical.  I am only 40 and I have seen the world change around me, from its use and dependance towards technology, physical changes that people go through as they grow older but seeing moments of your life which one considered a hit at the moment, becomes old school, classic rock, ancient pop culture to seeing people you once hung around with, growing older, balding and unfortunately, knowing were not fortunate to make it to 40.  And I really don't know where I will be at the age of 50 or if I will be here at all.

But it's the life's regrets that Clive Kandy had lived his life.  He may be known for taking action on the battlefield, but when it came to love, he was not sure what he was feeling towards the woman that was always aside him.  Not knowing that the woman who was there, he let go to marry another and a regret that will affect him forever.

""The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp"" is a film that signifies loss, regret but also realization. Fascinating is the fact that throughout his years after he met, loved and loss Edith to his good friend Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff, he has been a man who has lived regrets but also found women who bare close semblance to the woman he loved.  Clive Kandy does a magnificent job of playing the various years of Clive Kandy, as with how Deborah Kerr was able to do a wonderful job of playing three women, of different timelines, but yet look similar.

As Clive Kandy is a man of regret, Anton Walbrook's role as Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff is interesting because he was a German, a kind-hearted German who develops a long friendship with Clive Kandy but also a man who has regrets and wonders if he took his wife Edith's advice to move away from Germany when it was changing into a place where people accepted Nazi ideals and unfortunately, estranged with his sons because he did not follow those ideals.

While the film was full of humor, you have to respect Powell and Pressburger for creating a film like this during World War II.  It was audacious but yet skillfuly written, to show that not all Germans were evil, during a time when Germany was despised and people thought that the country represented evil.  But that was an effect during war time.  A time where countries were dedicated in creating their own propaganda, these two filmmakers stood behind their film and while controversial and even drew the ire of critics and politicians, many decades after the second World War, many feel that ""The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp"" is a true masterpiece.

Of course, Powell and Pressburger had many masterpieces and each with their own charm.  But ""The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp"" will be known for being the one film that was able to rile up an audience and even Winston Churchill himself.

As for the 2013 Criterion Collection DVD release, assuming you have no need for the superior Blu-ray version, the DVD still looks much better than its 2002 counterpart and features newer special features. Not only does this film look pristine, it's testament to the people who painstakingly restored this film.  Better colors, better deal, just better picture and audio quality overall, this is a magnificent DVD release of the British cinema classic.

Overall, when it comes to British cinema, Powell and Pressburger films should never be passed on.  And ""The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp"" is a masterpiece that should be enjoyed multiple times in one's life time and as you grow older, realizing how much you can sympathize with Clive Kandy.  A film that is beautifully shot, wonderfully written and just looks and sounds fantastic with the new restoration, ""The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp"" is one release that cineaste must have in their collection.  A must buy!  A must own Criterion Collection release!  Highly recommended!",1364601600,8,9927,4.7896592244418335
280108,5,6300256073,"This Criterion Blu-Ray edition of The Life & Death Of Colonel Blimp is incredible!  The restoration gives the film the look that it was made yesterday.

The picture is so remarkably sharp that in the duel sequence you can tell stand-ins were used when the camera pulls back at the start of the duel.

Colonel Blimp is one of the masterpieces made by The Archers, Michael Powell & Emeric Pressburger.  It is also (in my opinion) one of the top English films ever.  Every aspect of the film is perfect - direction, production, acting (Anton Walbrook is a very underrated actor, sadly), writing, & (especially) photography.

280110,5,6300256073,"I just watched this film and I loved it. I was expecting battlefield scenes, but instead I saw chivalry, duels, romance, and friendship. In the meanwhile, the viewer witnesses a big change between the way war used to be fought (as an affair between gentlemen) and the vicious war ignited by the Nazis. And I guess this is what the Archers, the producers of this film, were communicating with this precious film about character and English chivalry. Released in 1943, amidst WWII, the film presented sympathetically the veteran English soldier (represented by Colonel Candy) who often protested the methods of the new war against the Nazis. This was important to the Archers, since this type of soldier had been ridiculized through the media through a cartoon character called Colonel Blimp (I had to look up that piece of information to understand the title, since Blimp appears nowhere in the film). Of course, toward the conclusion of the film, Colonel Candy gets the message that WWII is a different kind of war, and that it must be fought differently. Along with Candy, there is a German character, a friend of Candy who is also aware of the reality of the new Nazi menace. His tragedy is that his sons have been lost to the Nazis while his generation and its values on how to fight a war have been abandoned. In addition to this major plot, there is at the beginning a romantic triangle involving the three major players in this film.

Other than the content, the film is done beautifully in color, and this Art House edition is in pristine condition. Besides that, the film has three major actors: Roger Livesey, Anton Wolbrook, and Deborah Kerr.

Just a warning: this is not an action-packed war film. It is in fact pro-war; it has drama as well as humor. Nevertheless, I highly recommend it and I consider it enjoyable.",1357171200,2,1827,4.7421383647798745

Winston Churchill hated the idea of this picture because is seemed to be poking fun at him and the conduct of the war to date. As it happens, Winston had already learned the lessons of this movie.

Rating: 2.5 out of 5

'Colonel Blimp' is a difficult film to explain. First of all, 'Blimp' has little to do with its protagonist who's named Major General Clive Wynne-Candy. Colonel Blimp is actually a comic strip by David Low which was popular when the film was made in 1943. The comic features a stereotypical Englishman, known for his pomposity and was written by Low to satirize what he perceived as the reactionary views of certain politicians of the time (including Winston Churchill). Director Michael Powell indicated that the film is really a tribute to those who maintain their dignity, in their old age.

The film begins awkwardly in the present time of 1943. Wynne-Candy is now the leader of the Home Front, staffed with civilian volunteers and retired military men such as the General himself. Wynne-Candy is about to get his comeuppance at the hands of 'Spud' Wilson, the young lieutenant who also happens to be the boyfriend of Wynne-Candy's driver, 'Johnny' Cannon (role #3 played by Deborah Kerr). Spud breaks the rules by using Johnny as an unwitting spy, gathering intelligence on the General's plans during war games between the General's group and his. We then flashback to the time of the Boer War in 1902, where Wynne-Candy is on leave and receives a letter from Edith Hunter (Role #1 played by Kerr), a friend of a friend, who is now working as an English teacher in Berlin.

Edith complains to Wynne-Candy in the letter that a German, Kaunitz, is spreading lies about the conduct of the British Army in the Boer War. Against orders to intervene in a diplomatic matter, Wynne-Candy confronts Kaunitz in a caf, who slaps him, and then Wynne-Candy manages to insult the entire Imperial German Army Corps. He ends up in a duel with a German officer, Theodor Kretschmar-Schuldorff, played by an excellent Anton Walbrook, and they both end up hospitalized. An unlikely friendship develops between the two men at the hospital, despite Theo's limited grasp of the English language (the running joke is Theo's response of 'very much' to almost every comment he responds to). At the end, Edith falls for Theo and we never see her again. All this would be mildly interesting (and/or entertaining) except for the fact that the scenes are drawn out for way too long and is done in the style of the typical drawing room comedies of the time.

Now a Brigadier General in the First World War, Wynne-Candy ends up meeting a young nurse, Barbara, (Role #2 played by Deborah Kerr) who he eventually marries. There's an interesting scene where Wynne-Candy finds out that Theo is now interned in a British prisoner of war camp following the Armistice. Theo refuses to speak to him presumably because he doesn't want to appear as a collaborator in front of his fellow prisoners. But later, about to depart for Germany, Theo calls the General, who brings him out to meet his various cronies, all a bunch of stuffed shirts. This group collectively personifies the title character. They all act as if the war never happened and want to be immediate friends with Theo, who after leaving the party, speaks of the group contemptuously, indicating that the British are 'weak'. Wynne-Candy is no different from his colleagues in their naive belief that the enmity between the two nations will soon be forgotten!

In perhaps the weakest part of the film, time passes in a series of montages. In one instant, a newspaper clipping from 1926 notes the passing of Wynne-Candy's wife. When Theo re-appears at an immigration hearing in 1939 in England, he reveals that Edith too is dead. So Powell manages to ensure that we learn virtually nothing about each of these female characters. Meanwhile, Theo, who looked like he was fast becoming a hardened Nazi when he gets on the boat back to Germany in 1919, now is a virulent anti-Fascist, after presumably softening up, following the death of his wife. Unfortunately, all of this plays out off-screen. Had the duel machinations perhaps been a bit shorter, there could have been some scenes, effectively depicting Theo's transformation.

Following Britian's entry into World War II, Wynne-Candy's dark moment comes when his BBC speech is canceled. Acting like the pompous Blimp, Wynne-Candy wants to employ 'nice guy' tactics against the Nazis and argues that the British shouldn't stoop to their level, when fighting them. The 'gentleman warrior' is deemed irrelevant and is forced to retire from active service. Theo also lectures Wynne-Candy on the necessity of pulling out 'all the stops', in the war against the Nazis.

We're now back to the present time, in the middle of those War Games between Wynne-Candy's Home Front and the regular army. Wynne-Candy is literally caught with his pants down, while he enjoys himself in a Turkish bath. While at first, he's humiliated by the young lieutenant's 'below the belt' tactics, and plans on punishing him, he recalls his own youth, when he disobeyed orders and confronted the wretched Kaunitz in the caf. Realizing the error of his ways, he decides to invite the lieutenant to dinner. The older codger is not so bad after all, finally realizing his error in not adapting to the new times.

Deborah Kerr was a beautiful woman who sadly here has little to do in her three roles. Roger Livesey is saddled by the weak character of Wynne-Candy, who is both noble as the principled soldier and buffoonish, in his desire to ingratiate himself with just about everyone he meets. Only Walbrook as Kretschmar-Schuldorff, steals the show, with his nuanced performance as the bad guy/good guy Teuton.

'Colonel Blimp' will keep your interest more as a period piece than a great work of art. In the earlier scenes it needed to be more compact and at the mid-point, more detailed. At the end, its message is spot on, but comes off as agitprop, rather than compelling drama.",1334620800,14,5890,4.8927855711422845
280114,5,6300256073,"""ThE Life and Death of Colonel Blimp"" is one of the best films ever made. The acting, direction and cinematography are all first rate. It's in my Top Ten. And this Criterion disc is a perfect reproduction of the color and sound of the original.

280115,5,6300256073,"The major theme of this 1943 film was the need for World War II Britain to face facts:  Hitler's Germany was evil, and it would not conduct the war according to any ""rules of the game.""  Britain needed to shed any remaining notions of a gentlemanly fight.

Brigadier Wynne-Candy, so well played by Roger Livesey, confronts this when he is retired from the Army in 1940 for drafting a radio talk that included the sentiment that he ""would sooner accept defeat than victory if it could only be won by those [Nazi] methods.""  His German friend Theo, once an officer, now a refugee, helps him see the evil Britain faces, and the Brigadier is given one more chance to serve his country by organizing a zone of the Home Guard.

He saw half of the challenge, then.  But he failed to recognize that when German leaders, committed to ""total war,"" saw no need to fight fair, it also meant they would transgress other expectations like ""war begins at midnight,"" and the Brigadier is ""captured"" before an exercise begins.

These hard wartime lessons are portrayed in a thoroughly affectionate film.  The affections are for old England, old ideals, old friendships.  These will be transformed in the crucible of war, but the film is full of affection for what all know will be lost in the process.

The film has its delights:  a very young Deborah Kerr playing three roles, a look at the military culture of pre-World War I Germany (the preparations for a duel, even if hyped for the screen, are chilling), a moving soliloquy by Anton Walbrook playing Theo, and some agreeably stereotyped English characters.

There is, though, one more lesson to be drawn from England's pull into total war that the film does not really engage.  Consider some parallel cases:  in James Gould Cozzens' novel of World War II, ""Guard of Honor,"" old Colonel Mowbray is tolerated, but in the new war his age and incompetence cost the lives of young paratroopers.  The U.S. Army captains of World War II were colonels and generals in Vietnam, personally admirable, but their failure to adapt to a new kind of war killed many young Americans.  In this film's plot, Brigadier Wynne-Candy does not in the end lead British soldiers into battle, so it mutes this final lesson.  Affection and respect for the old may kill some of the young.

This film well deserves its consistent rating as one of the finest British films ever made.

280116,5,6300256073,"It begins in energized war-games fashion. Even the music hall style of music captures the boyish enthusiasm of a serious business; the middle of World War 2 (the film was made in 1943). As if to highlight innovative cinema in the early sequences, a cinematic trick is used to turn the clock back to 1902; the time of anti-British propaganda about the Boer war. Colonel Blimp (as it were) finds himself in Berlin, in an attempt to correct the anti-British sentiment, falls foul of diplomacy, has to fight a duel, becomes firm friends with his Prussian duellist, and who both fall in love with the same woman. Deborah Kerr is scintillating in her three roles, matching the three generations this film follows. The second is The Great War (World War 1; `the war to end all wars' or so was the hope at the time). Colonel Blimp tries to discover the whereabouts of his Prussian friend as that war ends. He only knows he is alive. Two years later he meets him. He is a prisoner of war, in England. Then back to the present and therefore world war 2. They meet again only this time, he is a refugee from Nazi Germany. His speech to the police interrogator is acknowledged as a most moving monologue, delivered by the superb Austrian actor, Anton Walbrook. For me though, the most memorable sequence is when his Prussian friend convinces the colonel (now a major general), played by the under-rated but fantastic-performing Roger Livesey, that the old rules of chivalry and fair play simply do not apply when fighting such a monstrous enemy. This film is about true friendship between men at war on opposite sides and love; fulfilled for one and unrequited for the other - perhaps the biggest agony of all. What a superb piece of cinema!",1309046400,,1729,4.65359477124183
280117,5,6300256073,"This is an amazing film spanning the whole adult life of Clive (Wynne-) Candy, who is the film's stand in for David Low's Colonel Blimp, a jingoistic cartoon character.  The story begins with Clive being ""taken"" by an overly enthusiastic member of the Home Army during a war exercise.  I suspect that this is the symbolic death referred to in the title.  This is supported by what is basically Clive's life passing before his eyes.  Three eras predominate: his time in Germany during the Boer War, where he goes to try to combat German anti-British propaganda.  This is an interesting moment, as the concentration camp was invented by the British in the Boer War (although without the horrific additions by the Nazis).  Here he meets the first incarnation of Deborah Kerr, and fights a duel with Theo, played by Anton Walbrook.  Theo ends up with Kerr, and Clive, as he says later ""never got over it.""  But he continues to live his life with honor, through the First World War, where he meets Kerr, version two, who he later marries.  Theo is a P.O.W. in Britain and is very angry at his country's loss, although Clive tries to comfort him.  The third act has great depth because we've gone through so much with the characters.  Others have rightly mentioned Theo's speech telling why he came to Britain.  It is a masterpiece and goes far beyond propaganda.  Winston Churchill was against the film, but this speech shows more than anything else that he was wrong in this instance.  Theo has another important moment where he tells Clive that new methods have to be used against the Nazis or evil will win.

One of the points of the movie is that both Clive and Theo are equally honorable, but while Clive has become wealthy, well-known, and a general in the army, then the Home Army, Theo has lost everything - his children, who have become Nazis, his country, and even, it seems, his resident alien status in Britain.  The lesson is subtle: the problem is not the Germans, but rather than Nazis and their system.

While everyone does a wonderful job in the film, I'm especially impressed with Deborah Kerr, who plays three different roles and really makes them seem like three fully formed and completely different people.",1292544000,,2223,4.717616580310881
280145,5,6300256073,"I couldn't imagine the Powell-Pressburger duo topping ""A Matter of Life and Death,"" but this does it.  Roger Livesy's tour de force spanning 40 years is just amazing.  Anton Walbrook is so compelling as his German friend met thru a quirky duel even tho they had never met before.  They exemplify attitudes toward war and the military thru out the years.  Livesy's British devotion to military honor thru the wars (""we won honorably without resorting to the vicious tactics of the enemy"") whereas the German is more pragmatic, seeing the necessity to adjust to new tactics of the enemy to win.  Why fight honorably only to lose?  There is great detail on these two points and of course I thought so perfectly applicable to today's terrorism.

Sets, locations, costumes, photography all exceptional.  I especially like the Turkish Bath where the Colonel is ""taken.""",1285977600,,863,4.986013986013986
280146,5,6300256073,"David Low's cartoon of Colonel Blimp always showed its walrus-mustached, fat central character pontificating in a Turkish bath, and was so popular that the name became a byword for reactionary and out-of-date jingoistic politics. The beginning of this great and complex film study begins in such a bath, when the Colonel, by this time a general with the Home Guard during World War II, has been taken prisoner in such a Turkish bath during a training exercise game; he is castigated by the young officer who takes him prisoner for his mustache, his belly, and his attitude, and the film then proceeds to tell us who this figure really is (spanning three wars and forty years) and why the young officer and the audience have been completely mistaken in judging him. Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger approached this project not so much as to animate Low's character as rather to explore the generation gap from the perspective of an older British officer: their ""Blimp,"" here named Clive ""Sugar"" Candy (later Wynne-Candy) starts as a handsome, genial, irrepressible officer who journeys to Berlin in 1903, right after the Boer Wars to repudiate a German who has been badmouthing the British for atrocities such as massacres and concentration camps in South Africa. Candy here, as always, rarely achieves what he sets out to do, but in the process shows us sterling nature, his romanticism, and his kindness, which Powell and Pressburger believed was essential to the British character.

In less delicate hands this might have turned out to be a disaster, only in the end reasserting the portrait of Blimp as a reactionary know-nothing: viewers today of course watch this aware that the British were indeed responsible for concentration camps and massacres during the Boer Wars, with the knowledge of figures like Churchill whom the Low cartoon meant to parody. But Powell and Pressburger seem fully aware of the moral complications of their portrait of the British military man; even when Candy himself turns a blind eye to the failings of the British army they do not, and one of the most remarkable sequences of the film involves candy first repudiating the German style of interrogation during World War I when he (ineffectively) questions a band of captured prisoners, and then, when he leaves and without his knowledge, a scarred South African officer beginning to question the same German prisoners in his own way (which we are left to assume will turn out to be every bit as dark and brutal as that Candy has repudiated). The film's treatment of other sides to its coins occurs not only thematically, by the complex friendship and character judgments of candy and a German officer who becomes his best friend (Anton Walbrook), but also formally (the film's beginning sequence, celebrating the up-to-date technologies and youthfulness of the opposing side from candy in the war games, is re-worked in the final sequence to show how we've assigned our loyalties to the wrong side).

Moreover, the filmmakers could not have had a better actor to show the complexities of Blimp/Candy than with Roger Livesey in the title role. Livesey's performance is a triumph of naturalistic acting: he disappears so entirely into the role of the cheerful, kindly, blustering Clive Candy that you never see the seams. Even by the film's end when Candy has aged forty years, and is unrecognizable with a shaved head and brush mustache (and judicious use of padding and fat body doubles to make him seem portly) you never stop believing in him as Candy: he ages his manner incredibly convincingly without giving way to the slow humped walking and creaky voice that so many young actors unwisely believe will allow them to pass as seniors. Although we see Livesey and Walbrook play the same characters in three different decades, Deborah Kerr, who also is in each sequence, plays different parts so she's young in each of them (though wearing different hairstyles and with different names): the effect seems akin to that of the opera LES CONTES D""HOFFMAN, which might explain why Powell and Pressburger were to film it a decade later. In her first film role, Kerr is at her most surpassingly lovely (you can see why Powell fell in love with her). The film does not allow her to show the depth of her acting ability, as did the later Powell/Pressburger BLACK NARCISSUS, but perhaps this is for the best: Kerr's astonishing gift at portraying hysteria (first plumbed in that later film) is always done in a style that is effective and brilliant but highly mannered; it would not have suited to contrast directly with Livesey's less theatrical but gorgeously rich performance here.",1282089600,5,4667,4.966751918158568
280147,5,6300256073,"I watched this on a 42 inch Panasonic plasma hdtv, and the first realisation is how good this movie looks despite the fact it's made in 1943. The images are crisp and sharply focused, the colors vibrant and real.

The opening sequence shows a group of uniformed bikers zipping along in formation, wearing green khaki uniforms and green helmets, accompanied by ironic music.  These guys are on a mission, and they split off in different directions. The cinematography is simply amazing, and the images fill the entire screen.  Don't they know the war is not supposed to start till midnight?  It's amazing how good this movie looks compared to costly high tech modern movies, often in letterbox or widescreen.

This continues throughout the movie, as you realise how exceptionally well it is shot down to the smallest detail.

The first thing to know about this movie, is that no one called Colonel Blimp is in the movie. Colonel Blimp was a popular cartoon character satirised regularly in the Evening Standard, and Officer Candy the protagonist is Blimp.

It shows his life over 40 years from 1902 just after the Boer War, of how this impetuous young officer, a gentleman with a sense of decency and fair play yet naive, who did not evolve with the times, so the movie explores his potentially lethal naivete.

We see a parallel story of Candy and a German officer Schulborg with whom he duels in Berlin, and they become friends.  We see Deborah Kerr, 18 at the time in 3 different roles, as the governess with whom Blimp falls in love and loses, the woman he later meets and marries, and subsequently the young woman who becomes his driver.

You'll discover many outstanding scenes in this movie, especially when Schulborg played by Anton Walbrook, makes his plea for asylum in Britain, and what he says after, it's one of the outstanding acting perfomances I have seen. The other, a montage sequence showing gunshots and wild animals appearing stuffed and mounted in his den.  Quite fascinating to watch, his sexual frustration being channeled by shooting wild animals.

There are several bonuses with this, one is a commentary with both Martin Scorsese, and Michael Powell. You get to see some of the very clever cartoons, and you will also discover that Winston Churchill did his best to ban this movie.  You may not know that Churchill was  also involved in the Boer War, so some saw parallels between him and Blimp.  He thought this movie might lower the morale in the army.

Fortunately, Churchill's attempts to suppress this movie failed, as did his attempts to prevent it from being seen overseas.  This led to J Arthur Rank standing behind Directors Powell and Pressburger, and taking out ads and promoting it through his Odeon movie chain. 'See the banned movie.'  Churchill may have lost this battle, but he won
the war.

Although perhaps he is lampooned, Roger Livesey's performance as Blimp, wins us over, and we respond to his general decency.

Michael Powell, and Emeric Pressburger made Blimp, and both these names are worth remembering, because they made amazing movies together, and these films are better than most Hollywood movies.  I am currently working my way through the collection.

I was introduced to them by Martin Scorsese, and Roger Ebert.

280148,5,6300256073,"Made in 1943, The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp is a fascinating, entertaining, and important movie for several reasons. The movie tracks the life of British officer Clive Candy (Colonel Blimp)  from his return as a hero of the Boer War through his service in the Homeguard during World War Two.

Although the title is borrowed from the famous British political cartoon character, the portrayal of Blimp here is far more nuanced. Cartoonist David Low created Blimp as vehicle to satirize British upper class stupidity. Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger created a Blimp who befriended a German officer in 1903 - after having fought him in a duel. Blimp maintained his friendship with that German, Theodor Kretschmar-Schuldorff, right through WWII after Theo became a refugee from Nazi Germany.

Roger Livesey was marvelous playing Blimp in three stages of his life. Deborah Kerr played three roles: Theo's wife Edith, Blimp's wife Barbara, and finally as the young WTC driver for the aged Blimp. The movie's best performance is turned in by the Austrian actor Anton Walbrook in his role as Blimp's German friend. His monologue, shot as a continuous single scene close-up, to the British Enemy Aliens Act review board explaining why he has left Germany and wants to live in England is genius personified.

The movie is cinematically brilliant as well. The build up to the duel is masterful. Be sure to watch the Criterion Collection version for the Martin Scorsese commentary as well as the 20 minute documentary.

Watching it from this vantage point sixty years after the fact, the movie struck me as a very clever work of war propaganda in addition to being very entertaining. The movie's underlying message was that this new war could not be fought according to a sense of British fair play (mostly an imagined sense anyway). Blimp never gets the message until the movie's ending scene, which lends a strong sense of pathos to his character.

At the time, however, Churchill was wild and tried to suppress the movie because of its sympathetic portrayal of at least one German. Typical Churchillian blockheadedness - he wanted everyone beat over the head with a simplistic portrayal of all Germans, revealing his upper class elitism by refusing to recognize that most people are smarter than that and will be more effectively taken in by nuanced propaganda.  Fortunately, the producer stood behind the movie and played it in his own theaters across England with the pitch ""come and see the banned movie.""

The movie succeeds as propaganda and entertainment with some marvelous cinematic elements.",1264809600,2,2602,5.048951048951049
280149,5,6300256073,"Just watched this gem for the first time tonight. I heard of it because the great independent filmmaker Henry Jaglom (Deja Vu) mentioned it on one of his audio commentaries. The greatness of this film is the courage the film-makers had in making it during the madness of WW2. There's a humanity that transcends the stupidities of war and gives it lasting value. Great production and cinematography, great performances, explosions of color, friendship, loyalty and honor - make it a classic and worth repeated viewings in the future. I look forward to it.",1252800000,,554,4.967741935483871

A jolly and fun(if long) look at a British soldier's military career through three wars, The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp makes some good observations about the obsolescence which hits old war dogs but is mainly worth watching because it's just a fun film; if you've got 160 minutes lying around and want to get to know a very enjoyable character, give this gorgeous Technicolor film a whirl.

280152,5,6300256073,"The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp is a true rarity in moviedom, a film that is intellectually engaging, filled with life and innovation, a film that stands as a celebration of cinema, that explores the medium to the fullest. It was released not too long after Citizen Kane, and deserves to be held on the same level of esteem because of its glorious innovation and storytelling techniques. Blimp is a uniquely British film, yet universal, a film of its period(early '40's), yet light years ahead of its time. In my opinion, it demands to be seen and appreciated by a wider audience because it is unquestionably a landmark motion picture.

Comparisons between Blimp and Citizen Kane are not uncalled for. Both films are daring in their assertion that the cinematic style of a film is as important an element of the storytelling as the screenplay and the actors and the set pieces. The difference is that Blimp isn't drunk on its own power, dazzling the viewer with chiaroscuro lighting and warped, unusual camera angles, thereby self-consciously drawing attention to itself. Kane was either a film editor's dream job, or nightmare, with its brazen cutting and narrative reorganization. In essence, Kane has a kid-in-a-candy-store feel to it, the sense of a brilliant young director being given a camera for the first time and told to go nuts. And the result is undeniably engaging. Blimp isn't as wild or baroque as Citizen Kane, with this film we have more the sense of a couple of seasoned filmmakers who have always been visually adventurous expanding their reach even further, coming into their own, making a firm decision to explore the potential of cinema to the fullest. And the result is a more subtle form of legerdemain, wherein the visual trickery is firmly integrated into the overall narrative and never overwhelms the story or its characterizations.

The most striking example of this is having the great actress Deborah Kerr play three different characters, the important women in Colonel Blimp's lonely, male-dominated world. Her first appearance leads to a case of unrequited love. The second involves a storybook romance with the woman who eventually becomes his only wife. The third is a commander-subordinate relationship that leads to friendship based on mutual respect and admiration(and maybe some deeper feelings that are never acted upon, or even spoken). But this isn't just a neat cinematic hat trick, there is a good reason for the strategy. Deborah Kerr's three characters(and perhaps Deobrah Kerr herself) embody all the traits that constitute Blimp's(and presumably Powell and Pressburger's) ideal woman: inner and outer strength, intelligence, beauty, articulation, independence, worldliness, a willingness to speak her mind, a one-of-the-boys quality, among other things.  This makes The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp, despite its military, male-oriented setting, a feminist motion picture.  It also invites comparisons between this film and Powell and Pressburger's later(and in my opinion their greatest) film, The Tales of Hoffmann, based on the opera by Jacques Offenbach, in which all four of the women in the poet Hoffmann's life are seen as parts of a single romantic ideal.

Another example of the film's cinematic inventiveness involves the den at the home of Colonel Blimp's aunt. At two points during the film, both of them moments of Blimp losing one of his great loves, the blank walls of the den suddenly fill up as the heads of animals Blimp has killed on safari appear one by one. This is a sly, clever way of visualizing romantic and sexual frustration(witty and heartbreaking), perhaps the greatest ever put on film.

Finally, the framing device of the war games, wherein Blimp is confronted and ""arrested"" by a brash young officer who isn't content to play by the older gentleman's outmoded rulebook(might this young man represent Powell and Pressburger and their effort to knock the art of cinema on its ear?), has a manic, almost comic tone, and this adds a touch of levity to the proceedings while also accentuating what is probably the film's primary theme.

Because Blimp is about much more than romantic entanglements and feminine ideals. It is also about a man steadfast in his traditional values who gradually becomes superannuated as the world becomes more complex, and heartless, at the same time less civilized. In this sense it reminds me of an inverse version of The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, wherein a man who is in many ways part savage faces the prospect of fading away unheralded as his environment becomes more civil and restrained. The difference is that Powell and Pressburger's film is no tragedy, despite its bittersweet air, and the character Colonel Blimp doesn't fade away, he simply accepts a different, smaller role in a world he is no longer able to comprehend. He doesn't come across as ineffectual, on the contrary his willingness to stand by his ideals while recognizing that their place in a changing society has degraded somewhat gives the character a singular kind of strength, and blustery charm.

The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp is a long film, and not exactly fast-paced, it demands a lot from the viewer because of the complexity of the ideas it contains and because of its one-of-a-kind storytelling technique. Yet at the same time it has a breezy quality, due to the vitality of the characters and dialogue, the freshness of its approach, it never bogs down, and shouldn't bore any viewer who is willing to invest some intellectual capital into the experience. It's lovely, moving, thought-provoking, inspired and inspiring - exactly what movies, and art, are supposed to be.",1219795200,4,5678,5.071734475374733
280153,5,6300256073,"""The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp"" is a magnificent film!

Fully restored in its Technicolor glory, this movie by Powell and Pressburger (who also brought us ""Black Narcissus' and ""The Red Shoes"") portrays forty years in the life of a British officer, Clive Wynne-Candy (Roger Livesey), who in the enthusiasm of youth rushes off to Berlin (against orders) to save the reputation of Britain, which is being maligned by a dastardly double agent. During the adventure, which lands Wynne-Candy in the midst of what promises to be an international incident, he meets a lovely governess (Deborah Kerr in one of three roles in the film). He also meets Theodore Kretschmar-Schuldorff (The magnetic Anton Walbrook--who played the sinister ballet impresario, Lermontoff, in ""The Red Shoes"") over sabers at dawn. After drawing blood, the two adversaries become friends for life, despite two wars.

Criterion Collection has knocked itself out to produce this beautifully restored DVD. The colors are crisp and clean. The production team has also provided English subtitles for those for whom the accents might prove difficult to understand (although the diction of the actors is splendid). The film comes with a commentary by director Michael Powell and Martin Scorsese, as well as a really informative documentary with Stephen Fry that is more than the self-promoting puffery that accompanies so many DVDs nowadays. The extras present fascinating facts about how Winston Churchill tried to ban the film from being shown in Britain and from being exported. There is also a feature depicting David Low's ""Colonel Blimp Cartoons"" that usually begin with the walrus-mustached Colonel pontificating: ""Gad! Squiffy Harbottle [or some such notable] is right! We have to bring peace to the inhabitants of Lower Waq-Waq Land, even if we have to wipe out every last one of the blighters to get it!""

On one level, the movie is about the inability of some of the twentieth-century British military establishment to abandon the gentlemanly Public School rules of fair play in an era in which the Nazis had not only made up their own rules which they kept changing, but had also thrown away the rule book.

The performances are simply top-drawer, but for my money, Anton Walbrook runs away with the film. Walbrook is such a master of his craft that he can sit motionless in his chair and evoke powerful feelings in the viewer by only a subtle modulation of his voice. Walbrook's performance is both powerful and effortless.

And if ""Colonel Blimp"" seems a bit old fashioned, well it is! They simply don't make fine movies like this any more.",1213660800,8,2620,5.055555555555555
280154,4,6300256073,"BEWARE SPOILERS

""Jolly good show, old chap,"" is what directors Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger might have said to one another as they watched the final cut of their movie in a private showing in 1943.  Because Winston Churchill did not like the movie, feeling that it was too generous to the Germans in its positive depiction of the German army officer Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff (Anton Walbrook), it was banned from public showing in Britain until 1945.

The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp is a jolly good show and then some, a remarkable movie in several ways.  However it is not about ""Colonel Blimp"" who I understand was a popular cartoon character in the British press at the time.  Instead it is about a fictional character named Clive Candy (Roger Livesey) who actually rose to the rank of general.  It begins with his experience in the Boer War and ends with him working as a retired general on the home front during World War II.  It is a movie about friendship across international boundaries and cultures, about Brit spunk and fair play, and includes a long-running love story that might have had the title ""The Portrait of Deborah Kerr"" since she first appears near the beginning of the film and then during World War I and then again during World War II, but never ages!

She is the true love of both Candy and Kretschmar-Schuldorff, and here is how it plays out: Candy loses her to Kretschmar-Schuldorff in her first incarnation, but with stiff Brit upper lip never lets on or breathes a sigh of regret.  He wins her in her next incarnation and they are happily married.  In the third incarnation, both Candy and Kretschmar-Schuldorff, now widowers, realize that they are too old for the new her and admire her from afar, her previous incarnations long deceased.  I liked this conceit very much since it allowed us to see a lot of Deborah Kerr.

Most of the movie depicts Candy's life as a historical romance, full of adventure and high purpose.  The last part of the movie, dovetailed back into after the long flashback of Candy's life, plays a bit like a patriotic wartime film, showing the pluck and readiness of the British people to fight the Nazis.  This part Churchill would have approved of.  However I doubt that he had the time to watch that far into the film, which runs for two hours and forty-three minutes.

All in all the film is a delightful entertainment, carefully scripted and directed, the sort of uplifting show, full of wit and sparkle and honor among men that makes the viewer feel good about humanity, in short the sort of film that is seldom done these days.",1209859200,5,2605,4.6798245614035086
280195,5,6300256073,"""Colonel Blimp"" is probably the best movie made in wartime Britain and ranks with some of the finest ever, period. After reading the other reviews, I have little to add except it's a gem in any video collection.",1202860800,,211,4.578947368421052
280196,5,6300256073,"The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp is a wonderful generational story spanning a period from the Boer War through World War I to World War II that is, at once, both poignant and life affirming. Although a little too long and self-conscious at times it, nevertheless, talks to important values for all of us such as friendship and honor.

The production values are simply superb and the acting outstanding. It's photographed in a rich color that we don't see any more in this day and age of  computer generated color. Powell and Pressburger have created a little gem. Listen for the bits of classical music these two men loved injected into the film score. The late Deborah Kerr is beautiful and like the rest of the British cast, can actually act! Roger Livesey steals the movie as Colonel Blimp followed closely by Anton Walbrook. Only the British could make a film like this.",1200873600,,877,4.688311688311688
280197,5,6300256073,"What makes a film a masterpiece? It has to be an original story brought to life with first class acting, direction and production values. Most of all, it must have that magical quality which causes it to linger in the memory long after viewing. ""The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp"" is such a film.

This Criterion DVD contains a lovingly restored complete version of the almost 3 hour epic, produced in 1942 at the height of the war, exquisitely photographed in technicolour and containing 2 of the greatest performances in British film. The film is divided into 3 acts tracing the life of professional soldier Clive Candy through incidents starting at the aftermath of the Boer War to World War 2. Roger Livesey plays Candy and ages 40 years with complete conviction. The makeup is outstanding. Anton Walbrook plays the German who Candy befriends. Walbrook was a superb Austrian actor and his monologue when he enters Britain as a refugee in 1939 is overwhelming. A very young Deborah Kerr plays 3 women who punctuate Candy's life and Kerr proves that really talented actresses have inate abilities which simply mature as they progress. She has many loving close ups and it is not surprising to learn that the director, Michael Powell, fell in love with her.

This is a Criterion package so the extras are outstanding. The film has a memorable commentary by Powell himself, punctuated by Martin Scorcese. Powell was elderly when he made the tape and his voice is hushed and sometimes hard to hear but his memory is sharp and he has recorded details which would be lost otherwise.

Also, there is a documentary which highlights many of the film's great features. Finally, there is some excellent information about the cartoon character Colonel Blimp and its orginator, the celebrated cartoonist David Low. Blimp was a blustery, pompous ass whose political and social comments caused great amusement to the general public for many years. It was an inspired idea to take this character as the basis for a film about the life of a soldier from youth and urgency to irrelevancy in old age. The film's author, Emeric Pressburger, has toned down the less likeable characteristics of Blimp to help sustain audience interest. The film was controversial at the time of its production because it depicted, among other things, a sympathetic German. Winston Churchill tried to block its release. It was not the propaganda he wanted.

If at times, the film seems to drag and lose direction, hang in there because it is rare that characters are so carefully developed. These are completely 3 dimensional people. In 1942, the film was recording a lost era with its gentle satire of the slightly absurd Blimp. In the 21st Century, the film is a fascinating record of a different time and different codes of behaviour.",1196553600,4,2802,4.892631578947368
280198,5,6300256073,"I knew nothing of Powell and Pressburger, had never heard of Roger Livesey or Anton Walbrook, and Colonel Blimp was complete mystery to me.  I just found this DVD on the shelf of my local library and it looked promising.  So...what a great surprise to find this thoroughly enjoyable, superbly acted film.  Other reviewers here can fill you in on details.  I just want to add my words of admiration.

Roger Livesy gives a wonderful performance that spans 40 years.  He wins your heart as a young officer who dares to break the rules by going to Berlin on a whim, answering the plea of a young English governess who is troubled that the Germans have been given a false picture of the English.  He intends to help her to straighten them out, but finds himself in a duel with a German officer, and then, in a nursing home, where he falls in love with the woman and becomes close friends with the officer who has wounded him.  This is one big hearted Englishman!  When he finds that the German is in love with the woman too and intends to marry her, he wishes them both his heartiest congratulations.  We follow him through the years, as he grows in wisdom and in girth, but never loses his code of what being a gentleman means, and his essential goodness.  His German enemy/rival/friend is brilliantly played by Anton Walbrook.  Wow..this is a performance that I won't forget for a long time.  Deborah Kerr, at 18, plays a triple role and it's easy to see why all of the men fall in love with her.

There is so much humanity and goodness in this film that I highly recommend it to everyone.  I can't imagine any sentient being who won't be moved by it.",1190246400,,1648,4.428571428571429
280199,5,6300256073,"Roger Livesey gives an astonishing tour-de-force of the life of Colonel Blimp.  This film really shows what a jolly old boy network the empire was for this sort of fellow.  The film starts out on a run, and is a little hard to follow at first, but as soon as Livesey emerges out of the pool as a young man again the story starts to unfold.  This is a long film, and not one big in action.  Its a character study of a certain type of British officer which is long gone nowadays.  The film is loving in the treatment of its subject, and shows wonderfully how the passage of time can change all of us into a Blimp one way or another.  As a young man Blimp is full of energy and controversial in his actions, but as time marches on events start to pass him by.

This is a very British film that was made during WW2.  There is a certain degree of war propaganda in it, but to me this comes more under the category of classy propaganda.  The supporting characters are all excellent.  If you are looking for an intelligent film which shows a passage of time with warm feeling and good characters, then Blimp should be your #1 choice.  I have enjoyed this film for many years and its good to see a DVD copy out now with a few extra features.  Criterion always does a classy job.  The Blimp cartoons were great.  I had always known the character was based on that, but had never seen the original cartoons. The one extra thing missing would have been subtitles as some of the Britisisms are a little hard to catch sometimes. This is a classic period piece drama which ends in capital British style as the band marches by playing ""British Grenadiers"".  You can't get any better than that.",1185235200,,1678,4.2993630573248405

And young Deborah was never more luminous than in this early role.

The themes in this film are just as relevant today as they

were when it was made.  Most anything else I could write would

be redundant with what others have written.

I will admit that at points I felt the film dragged a bit,

having made a point but not moving on.  Maybe I am just too

much a product of watching too many fast paced films of today.

One thing I find curious about this movie is the title.  Since

the main character is not Colonel Blimp and is really a much

deeper character than the cartoon character, I wonder why the

film was given the name it was.  I wonder how many people went

to see this movie expecting a comedy based on a cartoon character.

My minor quibbles aside, this is really an excellent film and

worth seeing.",1176076800,3,932,4.3391812865497075
280202,5,6300256073,"The film itself is compelling theater in its own right, even 60 years on, as a touching look at friendship, lost romance, aging, and personal obsolescence. Roger Livesay (Lt. Clive Candy) hands in a brilliant performance as he ages from a dashing young officer of the Boer War period to a dumpy, elderly warhorse in mid-WWII. Aging with him is Anton Walbrook as a German officer who was his friend, then his enemy, then his friend once more -- but even more displaced by time and circumstance. Deborah Kerr is splendid as three different romances in Clive Candy's lifetime.

Criterion, as usual, has restored scenes and visual quality. Its extras are important, as we see the context of the film and its controversy. The Colonel Blimp cartoons are worth seeing as how they might have damaged the film: the cartoon character was a blustery, stuffy duffer from the inter-war years -- dumpy, red-faced, white walrus mustache like the aged Clive Candy. Blimp was not really likeable in print, who could have easily made the movie character a forgettable cartoon figure as well. Powell, Pressburger and Livesey dodged that bullet. Blimp was not likeable, but the film makes you care about Livesay's character.

We also see the controversy around the film in the documentary. Easily enough imagined: it was 1943, the title character is both conservative and friendly to (one) German at the same time. The DVD includes memoranda to and from Churchill trying to stifle the film. Also, the film's message -- that Candy wanted to fight a gentlemanly war (although the real message was that the UK should not), was also something jarring in bomb-damaged Britain at that time. It's worth remembering that controversy and memoranda were raging in the same month (July 1943) that the RAF launched Operation Gomorrah, the horrific fire-bombing of Hamburg.

This film is worth having, and not just for buffs of film history or British cinema.",1154822400,6,1926,4.975155279503106

I was greatly impressed with the quality of the picture and clarity of sound considering the age of the film now over 60 years old... it comes out as crystal clear on the DVD as a newly released movie.",1150761600,3,616,4.970873786407767

Is Barbara Wynne, Candy's nurse wife of the post WWI period, supposed to be correct when she wrinkles up her nose while visiting the prisoner of war camp, when she remarks how creepy it is that Germans can murder innocent children and then sit down and listen to Mendelsohn wearing the same satanic uniform?  If so, it doesn't seem as though she would care for Theo, and the screenplay makes sure that the two of them never meet.  I think the fact of their un-meeting, as you might call it, is the central problem of the movie.  What would have happened had they met up, a collision like nuclear fission that would have destroyed the house of cards Clive Candy has carefully constructed.

The flashback structure of the film makes perfect sense if you think of it as the spotty recollections of an old colonel (or old nation) looking back at some highlights, mistaking lowlights for same, and generally putting a shine on a bleak present.  Don't you love the Technicolor that makes a jungle of parrots out of Barbara Wynne's country blouse and skirt outfit, she stands out like a macaw on a field of cut lawn.  In his memoirs Powell describes himself as completely besotted with Deborah Kerr and her red hair, well, he gives it a good workout in this film, she looks fantastic in each of her parts, if a bit too stagily hardbitten as the modern, liberated driver Angela ""Folks call me Johnny"" Cannon.",1150761600,,1658,4.63481228668942

I'm not sure whether a different actor would've helped since his character didn't appeal to me. The hunting trophies especially turned me off of him.

What held my attention was the magical presence of Deborah Kerr. Without her, the movie would've been a chore to sit through. I loved all the scenes where she appeared. As three characters, she exemplifies the changing role of women's jobs from English governess to nurse to military chauffeur. However, except for Edith Hunter, her characters aren't too developed.

7807491,2,6300256073,The Amazon Instant Video version of this is not the 2012 restoration that is listed on the page.  It is full of scratches and artifacts from the original film and is of noticeably poorer quality.,1514678400,,195,4.571428571428571

7807493,5,6300256073,"A young military officer, ""Spud"" Wilson (James McKechnie), in the ecstasy of a mock war confronts an old officer Clive Candy (Roger Liveseys) who appears to be set in his way and unaware of today's (1943) attitude toward war. The young officer ridicules the older officer's ways and looks without giving a thought as to why or how the older officer became that way.

The explanation is through a flashback that Candy explains the apparent differences and that one day you may also find yourself ridiculed. In the process we see how some decisions stay with us for life.

Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger are well known for movies that have a mythical deep meaning like ""I Know Where I'm Going!"" (1945.) In one film ""One of Our Aircraft is Missing"" (1942) the deleted scene of a confrontation between a younger and older officered was deleted. This scene was the seed for this movie ""The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp"" (1943.)

At first the film does not seem to have quite the stature of the earlier Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger films but as the personalities evolve and the story unfolds you see that they still maintain the magic.

Two performances I find of special interest are those of Anton Walbrook as Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff (the Uhlan officer) as he goes through attitude changes in life, and that of Deborah Kerr who plays the three women (Edith Hunter/Barbara Wynne/Johnny Cannon) in the life of Clive Candy.

Last note be sure to get the restored Criterion presentation of this Janis film.",1507420800,,1520,4.8307692307692305
