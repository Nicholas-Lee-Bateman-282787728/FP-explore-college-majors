8342238,1,B0002BBUL0,"Dillon produces are more accurate video on how to setup the 650. this video follows the discussion with long winded  topic responses.  It is evident that there was limited pre thought. This should have been scripted since the information to be presented already exists. The crimping topic was nice but with proper editing the information could have been successfully presented in 3 minutes and not in the 13 minutes used.

I was hoping to get information on how to build a ladder and use the information to determine load development. Product (specific powder brands) information and formulas is to dated and should not have been discussed. Load development was deferred to the Sierra load data manual. Making this an expensive reference guide.
For an example.
Question: ""how much pressure should I put on to primer it?""
Answer: ""Well ..."" [cut] discussion of primer anvil impact on the primer pocket."".

As previously noted Reloading 101 is the best description. at the 1 hour mark we are just getting around to watching him try to set the powder drop. We suffer through trying to tweak the last .2 for 2 minutes. The event is reduced to a private discussion between the moderator and Brian.

Ont eh plus side, I found Brian Enos to be personable. I would rather listen to him reminisce and tell stories of competition. I would pay tfor that. This, I regret.",1482364800,,1359,4.815450643776824
8342239,1,B0002BBUL0,"I was expecting so much more from this title. This video should be retitled ""Reloading 101"". A very basic and disappointingly short video featuring the Dillon 650 press. Brian Enos may be a great shooter, but he does not share any secrets about reloading. Best parts of this video are the the Dillon products they use and a fairly adequate job of explaining a taper crimp. You will learn a lot more by taking the NRA reloading course or reading a book on basic reloading techniques. In short, save your money and buy a good reloading manual instead.",1311724800,3,549,4.612244897959184
