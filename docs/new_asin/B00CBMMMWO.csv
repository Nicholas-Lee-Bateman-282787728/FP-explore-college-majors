If you live in the SF Bay Area make sure to make an outing to: ""Playland Not At The Beach"" in El Cerrito! You will see Laffin Sal again. You can buy these they too.",1392163200,,282,4.053571428571429

8579944,5,B00CBMMMWO,"Ijust saw this movie at the Balboa Theater, it is interesting, historically correct, a great overview of the neighborhood, where I have lived for more than 40 years. I learned things about my neighborhood that I didn't know. I loved remembering the Cliff House, Sutro Baths, the ice skating, Playland and Sutro Park from days gone by. It was well done, excellent.",1366675200,4,363,4.870967741935484
8579945,5,B00CBMMMWO,"The Cliff House and Sutro Heights, DVD (2013) - The Cliff House seems such an integral part of San Francisco, it's hard to believe no one had done a documentary on it. Tom Wyrsch, writer and director remedied that in a big Way. The third in the Remembering Playland and Sutro's Baths, the Palace at Lands End trilogy, Wyrsch covered all the aspects of this beloved landmark through interviews, historic photos and film clips.
Recognizing that this is a tourist attraction, the documentary treats it like a tour of the three classic structures and their various remodelings. The film pays particular attention to the views that people recall and to interior shots of the 1894 Victorian Cliff House. It also takes the viewer up to Sutro Heights above, telling the story of Adolph Sutro's unusual San Francisco home.
While presenting an accurate and full history, the documentary does so with accounts and interviews that present stories, not just a telling of facts. The viewer relives the blowing up of the Schooner Parallel and the destruction of the north wing of the Cliff House. I strongly recommend this documentary to anyone who ever visited the Cliff House, loves San Francisco or just appreciates a very well done historic film.",1366502400,3,1235,4.9423076923076925
