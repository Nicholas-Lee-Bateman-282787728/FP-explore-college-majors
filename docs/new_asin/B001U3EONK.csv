3795782,5,B001U3EONK,"Anime and GITS fans rejoice with this must have remastered blu-ray version of the original movie. Certainly the CGI additions though good at times are a bit inconsistent in what they add overall but the remastered original animation for blu-ray is fantastic as is the audio. The spoken audio appears to be original (re-mastered I'm sure) so don't expect the flow of any scenes to change. This isn't like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Evangelion-1-01/dp/B002KYIAJ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Evangelion: 1.01</a>&nbsp;remakes just an very strong update to the original classic Ghost in the Shell. Special features include the original version of the movie but it does seem to me a bit rough in part going straight to blu-ray. With this blu-ray edition Ghost in the Shell as perhaps regained its place (if it ever lost it) of being what all other anime is judged against. Watch it.",1256169600,2,924,5.654676258992806
3795783,5,B001U3EONK,"The CG reworking done to the 2.0 version of this movie is probably not needed.  A good comparison is what George Lucas did with the original star wars trilogy.  Things were added here and there, some made things look better other times it made the movie itself worse.  It's also very similar to the limited edition star wars releases on dvd a few years back.  Like those discs this also includes the original theatrical release.  So if you are a purist and much rather watch the movie as originally intended you are able to do so.  I watched 2.0 once through but I imagine any further rewatching will be done with the theatrical version included as a special feature.

Anyway,  With how this disc was handled I can't help but highly recommend it to any fan of Ghost in the shell.  Even if you already own the original dvd this is a worthy upgrade even if you only watch the theatrical version for the higher bitrate.  The original GITS movie had some severe macroblocking issues that this disc does not have.  I never saw the re-release done a few years back so I can't compare but it's a vast improvement over the original.

If it wasn't for the inclusion of the theatrical I would have given it 4 stars instead of 5.  Even with the all the issues I have with the 2.0 remake, I still feel this is the definitive release of the movie for now.",1256083200,9,1342,4.384615384615385
3795784,5,B001U3EONK,"Bought this at Best Buy, apparently it was out early. The 2.0 version looks great, but the CG (especially the CG major at the begining) loses some of the charm. Fortunatly, the original 1995 version is included as a bonus feature.",1256083200,3,230,4.634146341463414

3795790,1,B001U3EONK,"Ghost in the Shell is one of my favorite films - but this edition includes a remastering and some added on ""updated"" CG scenes that certainly ruin the experience.

3795791,3,B001U3EONK,I like this film for the original animated film.  The added scenes kind of add something but I can't really justify it when some of the CGI kind of ruins the film if you've seen the original opening credits sequence this will be abundantly clear.,1505001600,2,246,4.466666666666667

3795793,3,B001U3EONK,"I should say up front that this was my first attempt at watching an anime film. I decided to watch this movie after watching the new Scarlett Johansson version, which I enjoyed. I should also say that I haven't seen this movie all the way through, after 2 attempts. Fell asleep the first time and lost interest the second.
The first few minutes of this film were promising, I liked the animation and it seemed to synch with the new version, but the movie lost me after the opening credits. As others have mentioned to abruptness of the CGI was curious...switching from a hand drawn scene with all its darkness and muted feeling to crystal clear, bright CGI..
The story seemed to ramble with no explanation of who the characters are and what they are trying to do and why they are doing it.
There is no exploration into the trauma and confusion of awaking to find your human body has been completely replaced with a synthetic one. The movie simply jumps from the procedure of mating her ""ghost"" to her ""shell"" to her waking like it is any other normal day.
I got the feeling this movie relied on the viewer having knowledge of the back stories of the series, which I assume were provided in comics and other mediums, none of which I had any prior knowledge of so I felt a bit lost.
The movie also had the feeling of English over dubbing that lacks real feeling...
The movie is very visual and the animation is really good and to be fair, perhaps some of my complaints are addressed later in the film, (like why such a high tech synthetic robotic body needs to wear a bullet proof vest)...",1502064000,,1587,4.438356164383562

3795796,1,B001U3EONK,Inconsistent stylization makes this movie awkward to watch.  The spliced in CGI looks like video game cutscenes.

The big difference i they re-rendered some scenes and converted them to CGI and while the CGI edits look excellent, they should've just edited the whole movie, as the transition between the edited scenes and the unedited ones are pretty sharp. I think even if I have not seen the original cut I would have been able to tell which scenes were edited and ones that are not. they don't look like they belong in the same movie.

Also, what used to have a green tint now have yellow/orange tint (like in the anime series especially in the Arise series), again adds to the mismatched ""feel"" of the edited scenes to the rest of the movie.

So, one star off for what feels like a half-hearted attempt to remaster the movie. they should've just re-rendered the entire movie. Now that would have truly been ""2.0"".",1484870400,,1043,4.507936507936508

3795955,5,B001U3EONK,"Great cyberpunk anime film. For those who are avid cyberpunk and sci fi fans this is a great recommendation to watch.
For those who love watching their adventures in high-tech  or futuristic style.
Fast paced action and not a dull moment combined with some philosophical speculation as the characters discuss what makes up their character or soul.
How much of themselves can be mechanized or artificially enhanced before they cease to be their
original selves?
An issue for those who find themselves being artificially enhanced to the point where they go beyond
being normally human.
Also in this world one's mind can be hacked, one's memories erased and replaced with new ones.
So the question one then also be can you then lose your original self since much of that is based on
memories of who you are and your life experiences.
Thought provoking and entertaining in a nice combination.

The rest of the movie, in contrast, appears untouched without an unremastered version to compare it to, so it feels like they just reanimated three or four key scenes in the movie and left the rest alone.

As for the voices, I can tell you that at least the English dub sounds just as stilted as it did in the original, and the lip syncing is terrible.  Perhaps they only re-recorded the Japanese?

3796006,4,B001U3EONK,"Let me begin by stating that I regard the original (25th Anniversary) Ghost in the Shell as a great masterpiece, worthy of 5 stars. I was unable to stomach the manga, which read like a scattered cyberpunk philosophy book, but the GITS feature film lets the characters and the narrative breathe in a way that the cluttered manga pages do not.
In many ways, GITS is the spiritual grandchild of Blade Runner; it deftly treats metaphysical quandary and brooding dystopian cityscapes with expert fight choreography and lush visuals. The art ranges in style from functional line art to breathtaking painted backdrops, and the viewer is treated to visuals that not only adhere to compositional accuracy but also to the different ways that human eyes, film, and videocameras physically perceive light. In short, if you are old enough to watch this (it's not for kids), have any interest in illustration, ponder what cyberization might do to individuality, or just like a good action film with some mood, watch this. You won't be sorry.

I've given 4 stars for the 2.0 version for two reasons.

First, in this day and age, it is unforgivable when a title is not made available in its original language. The Dubbed Vs Subbed Wars rage on, but if both are available, there is no excuse not to include both in any digital release. Compared with video, audio tracks are tiny files and subtitles are minuscule.

Second, the ""remastering"" of the visual elements attempts to improve (and therefore mars) what was perfect. The crude digital ""dust and scratches"" removal tools used here may have wiped out a few cracks and nicks in the original celluloid, but it also destroyed beautiful chalky haze (and therefore depth) in city skylines and careful drybrush shadings. Background objects drawn with dry pencils now incongruently pop to the foreground as if traced with permanent marker. Imagine ""remastering"" a Van Gogh by airbrushing over it and then drawing thick lines around each object with a black Sharpie.
The 2.0 version also incorporates CGI that was modern in 2010 but now looks like a cheap Saturday morning cartoon, sometimes in place of perfectly good line art and most notably in the complete replacement of all elements which were originally computer generated in the first release. While the original CGI is undeniably retro, the ""new"" CGI is merely outdated and once again does not fit with the overall style of the film. For one thing, the lovely, full pages of scrolling monochrome green text (which most people associate with copycat Matrix) and matching monochrome green GPS displays are replaced with merely functional sepia-tone 3D. Once again, not an improvement.

In short, while I would enthusiastically recommend the 25th Anniversary Ghost In The Shell film to a friend, I strongly suggest that you give the GITS 2.0 version a pass.",1434499200,4,2842,4.989451476793249

I know some people complained about the new CGI scenes and color palette but I find that these are not obtrusive as in ""distracting""; these changes doesn't take away (nor add, for that matter) anything from the main story, but that's a matter of taste.
Thankfully this version can please both audiences as it keeps the original theater version without the CGI and stuff, the only catch is that it's a compressed (maybe upscaled to 1080i) version. I kind of understand why is this: the main movie takes a lot of disk space, and trying to fit two of them with the same quality would be troublesome.
As for the audio I haven't heard it english dubbed, but the Japanese have excellent quality, both of them (the 6.1 Dolby Digital EX and the Lossless 2.0 track).
Bottom line, if you don't really mind the CGI OR it's the first time you're seeing it... It's probably the most logical choice for the price.",1417046400,,964,4.514285714285714

The verdict: Excellent picture, but the 3D animation enhancements they put in sink it. And it's not so much that I'm against CG enhancements; it's that the CG is cheap and cartoony! What I would expect in the opening crawl of your standard PS3 game, not a motion picture. The opening titles with the fast moving numbers (one of many things that influenced The Matrix) have been replaced by the background menu of a PS3 player, from the looks of it. It's one of many graphics changes. And yet, I could almost forgive all the background changes - except they chose to re-animate in CG our main character (Major Motoko Kusanagi) in two major sequences that are distracting beyond belief! The original filmmakers names are still on this; I don't know how they could think this would look any good, cutting from fake-looking 3D animation back to cell animation in the same scene. The 3D elements in the sequel, Innocence, look better by comparison; likely because it was planned that way.

One blu-ray bonus is that the original version of GITS is in the special features. But I swear they made it look grainy and dirty on purpose (like it was captured off laserdisc or something), just to make 2.0 look like the better, true version. My DVD of GITS looks much better, in comparison to this transfer.

That being said, this annoyance did not cripple the story, and was not a major problem. One thing I believe my keep people from watching this film, (besides it being anime), is the large amount of nudity it has. Before getting this movie I read many reviews on it and found mainly two different view points. View point one said that the movie did not have much nudity, which is a giant lie because the entire beginning seen is an assortment of close up shots of the protagonist's body while she is being made. The other point of view claims the movie is nothing but pointless nudity, and that the movie is terrible. While I myself don't like a lot of nudity in my movies I can't say the nudity in this movie is pointless.
 The story and animations of this movie is why you should buy this but if you want consistent animation styles or you don't want a lot of nudity stay away. But all and all I did enjoy this movie even though it will not be one I view with my friends or family.",1390867200,2,1164,4.243243243243243
3796243,3,B001U3EONK,"The Ghost in the Shell 2.0 Blu-Ray release from Manga contains both the original anime from 1995 and an updated version with some new CGI sequences.  I am not going to review the whole story here, but suffice it to say that it concerns the nature of sentient beings and what it means to be human versus an artificial or computer intelligence (the main character, Kusanagi, is a hybrid woman with an android body, who hunts cyber terrorists).  If you like Blade Runner or similar stories, you will probably find GITS interesting as well.  Note that although this disc is unrated, it most definitely falls in the ""R"" category, with very coarse language, nudity, and bloody violence.

The 2.0 version starts out promisingly enough, with a redone opening sequence that looks very cinematic in what looks like a homage to Blade Runner.  Then it quickly reverts to the original graphics that have a completely different look and feel.  While apparently quite good for its day (I'm no anime expert), the original animation looks very flat and has poor resolution effects in comparison to the new CGI.  You are constantly reminded of this whenever the new sequences are inserted (less than 50 percent of the animation has been updated).  It does not help that the original animation seems to have issues with the brightness and contrast in the Blu-ray transfer - the colors look washed out, making it look even more 2D.  I prefer the darker, more contrasty colors shown in the extras.  The original release works much better as a story because it is easier to suspend your belief that it is only animation instead of being constantly reminded of it.  I can see why the makers wished to update the animation for Blu-ray because the original version doesn't benefit that much from the increased resolution.  However, why not remake the whole story with modern CGI?  The mish-mash just doesn't work well.

My other criticism is that the pacing of the film seems inconsistent.  There is a measured sequence in the middle where we see details of the crowded cityscape (based on Hong Kong).  Fine, I enjoyed that, but then the ending sequence seems very rushed and the film ends after only 80 minutes.  I would have liked a bit more story development.

So, five stars for the story, character, and concept, and only two stars for the 2.0 execution.  If you have already seen the original, you may not need this Blu-ray release unless you are exceptionally curious.

On a positive note, the soundtrack sounds great in a DTS-ES 6.1 mix (both Japanese dialog and a good English dub), also refreshed for the 2.0 release. It is very immersive and sounds very clean.  Interestingly, I have read somewhere that originally they were thinking of using a Bulgarian chorus instead of the ancient Japanese singing (which sounds fascinating even if you don't understand it).  In what may be a coincidence, the music reminds me of the Bulgarian inspired music in the TV series ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" (produced at about the same time as the original GITS), and the main character, Kusanagi, looks a lot like Lucy Lawless (they sure kick butt in the same way)!

Special Features:
Contrary to what the Blu-ray jacket says, there are no commentary tracks or face to face interview with the director (unless they are hidden somewhere in the menu).  There is a 25 minute ""making of"" feature that includes interviews with the film makers, but it is about the original, not 2.0 version.

It opens strong, but suffers from pacing issues throughout the rest of the film that left me yawning at times.

The story is needlessly complex, by the end of the film i just about had it figured out, but if you go into this without any prior knowledge of Ghost in the Shell lore, you will be struggling to keep up throughout most of the film. The movie in general is just a form of media used to communicate some very interesting and thought-provoking philosophical questions regarding artificial intelligence, how we define humanity, and what sentience truly means. However, the gist of this could have been wrapped up in a 5 minute monologue without all the complicated stuff that makes up the bulk of the story.  Speaking of the story and pacing, one of my biggest gripes was the underwhelming, anti-climactic conclusion (if you can call it a conclusion) that left me wondering ""thats all?""

Overall this was a good flick, and i understand its great influence on other films and art, but do not expect to be blown away and entertained like Akira makes you feel. I suppose in 1995 the exploration of sentience, AI and humanity may have been more ground-breaking, but if you are someone seeing this for the first time in 2013, you will have seen all this stuff explored in great detail via other films and forms of media such as video games.",1357689600,,1594,4.585964912280701

Well its the Ghost in a Shell original movie. It has nothing the original dvd version didn't have. Why does it say 2.0? I guess because its remastered for blu ray version? I really didn't see any differences from the dvd version to this version, other then that it plays on a blu ray player and not a dvd player.

Even the one behind the scenes option, was something the original dvd version had included previously and nothing new. But if u want the movie in the blu ray option, I supposed this is the way to go.

The biggest sticking point, which immediately dropped my review from 5 stars to 2 (I would've given it a 2.5 if I could), was the CG animation that replaced scenes that were done spectacularly in the original DVD.  I've seen better CG in videogames than what was on display, and I actually got upset enough to start screaming at my T.V.  The difference is so absolutely jarring that it becomes a major distraction.  To put it into perspective, think of the stuff that was tacked on to the original Star Wars trilogy when Lucas re-released it.  Yeah it's that bad.  GITS is one of my favorite animes, hands down.  The original animation is still a sight to see, and the story is complex, mature, and absolutely spectacular.  It's one of the few animes that would do well in a full U.S. theatrical release.  I really don't feel that this version deserves the 4 star rating it has, it deserves at the most an overall 3, which is the other reason I'm giving it a 2.

The box misleads you into believing that this is going to be a remaster, with a redub, in mostly 3D, however the 3D that does exist does the opposite of what the same scenes intended in the originals DVD. In the original Ghost In The Shell the segments that are now replaced with CGI helped the movie to flow, while in 2.0 it causes it to stagnate and serves as an annoyance. The CGI really for 2009 isn't really on par enough to be considered Eye Candy either. Next time they should either make it ALL in 3D or none at all. I can't really complain about the ending, considering. It still had some inconsistencies, such as Matokos head floating in water, when not even 5 minutes before that her head got blown to more then just bits by the snipers thus the head wouldn't exist, it would be in a bloody mess everywhere, not floating in the river. The film abruptly leaves off with a password that they should've changed, since it's not exactly a very secret passcode when it's the project number. I have to say for some reason this just felt short and stagnant. I can't stress how much the 3D segements annoyed me. The new amber tint is not as cool as the old green tint either, I missed that from the old one. I HAVE to complain about the dub again because ""The Puppetmaster"" should've been female as it was in the japanese version, that is my final complaint. I want people to know that the old one was the best, and the best Stand Alone Complex oriented thing is the Video Game. The video game for SAC was great, the anime was terrible, and this movie, 2.0 does not merge well with Innocence, at least not for me, and I loved Innocence. I enjoyed the remastered video, but as I've seen other people say. Just get it for the HD Remaster of the original, and not for the 2.0 version as the 2.0 will dissapoint. I'll put this another way, I'd rather go play either the SAC game for the PS2 or the PSX Ghost In The Shell game on a PS One, rather then seeing this pos again. One last thing, I've heard people say the english audio is not 5.1 and I'm inclined to believe that as I felt I only got 2.1 out of my 5.1 surround system, consider yourself forewarned as the 5.1 audio is said to only apply to the japanese audio.",1313107200,,2311,4.230769230769231

Although I agree with my fellow Ghost in the Shell fans that the changes present in 2.0 are (frankly) unwelcome and unnecessary, the film itself is still wonderfully entertaining and thought-provoking.

I doubt a proper re-master of the original film will ever be released, so the included (slightly ugly) original film (in the special features section) will have to do.

The new audio sounds great, and the awkward looking CG version of Major Kusanagi doesn't overstay her welcome.  Overall, the changes are a small price to pay in order to add my favorite anime film to my blu-ray collection.",1304985600,,705,5.104347826086957

For old fans: All they've done to ""update"" the movie is replace a few scenes with ReBoot-quality CGI animation.  Most of these updates focus on Major Kusanagi's breasts.  If you're not a 12-year-old boy, you may not find much benefit here.  As other reviewers have pointed out, the original version carefully balanced CGI and hand-drawn animation.  This version chucks that out the window.  Fortunately, the original version is on this disk, under the Bonus Features.  Though it doesn't seem to have been cleaned up, it's still the superior version.

For people who've never seen it: I first watched it about 15 years ago.  The dialog hasn't gotten any less stilted in all that time.  Both the screenplay (which is less ""dialog"" and more ""people talking near each other"") and the flat line readings from the actors (which, unfortunately seems to be representative of too much anime) make it hard to invest fully in the characters.  The animation is beautiful, and the story is interesting.  But if you don't have a compelling reason to watch it, you might find it hard to stay invested.

3796321,5,B001U3EONK,"Hello,

The key to the movie is in the story. Albeit, it takes some time for it's ideas to sink in. My first viewing left me confused, but with each new viewing to see if I could get it yielded fruit. For those of you curious about this film, I see it as a meditation about the nature of reality. In the story you will be confronted with a futuristic possibility of what life would be like in an age with advanced tech some of us dream about. With dialogues surrounding questions that some of us spend our lives seeking answers to. This movie in some ways is like ""The Fountain"" by Darren Aronofsky. Though I bring comparison by that they both are deeply philosophical, stylized, haunting, and beautiful.

The Blu-Ray version is a marvelous piece of work. Others will have a fancy for the original as I do too. I like the original green however the remake brings the vision to life in a whole new way that makes it seem that much more. There are new additions to this with new CG scenes that made for a fairly beautiful upgrade. Though watching the original for the sake of seeing some of these scenes were actually drawn and then animated will make those realize the beauty of this movies ambitions for an animation back in its time. There are some scenes that seem a tad bit off but I'm not scrutinizing this so much since what they achieved gave me satisfaction. It's been cleaned up pretty good and when I say ""..a tad bit off"" I'm saying it is not quite hi-def, but it's cleaner than the original I feel. I cannot speak for the more die-hards though on this movie and hi-definition junkies. The message in the movie still rings and seems to only get louder with the coming years.

If you like animated movies with a philosophical bent in a high tech future, give this one a try. Who knows you might have a new favorite.

3796327,3,B001U3EONK,"First and foremost,  I want to mention I saw the original version when it was released in 1995/96.
It was a landmark narrative in terms of production and story line.  Not since Akira did an animated feature
go beyond its boundries and become a solid classic sci-fi masterpiece.  My jaw dropped during the opening
title sequence ( those green cascading numbers turning into letters have long since been ripped off (borrowed/homaged)  by
the Matrix trilogy).

 Now skip forward 14 years later to V2.0

Cons:

1. Not sure what the revision was about,  It certainly doesn't add to the power of the original.
They added in modern CG to replace the most memorable shots.  Transition is like going
from salt water to fresh water,  a bit jarring.  I suggest a V3.0 and fully render the entire
narrative.  With the technology in full swing and past rendered features such as Appleseed
and Final Fantasy,  its a shame that a full rendered treatment wasn't applied to the entire feature.

2. The overall color of the feature has gone from that greenish/blue tint to a yellowish golden
tint to better match the new CG.

3. The iconic title/credit sequences with the cascading numbers turning into letters has
been replaced with some modern bio/morphing sequences,  to me this is near blasphemy.

Pros:
1. This BR disc has the original version for viewing the old classic. BT image itself is clean/crisp.

2.  6.1 DTS ES discrete sound (fantastic audio created with the help of Skywalker Sound)

3.  some extras like The making of the GITS, production report.

Ghost in the Shell deals with a organization better known as 'Section 9' with Chief Aramaki leading the unit.

3796332,4,B001U3EONK,"First of all - props to Anchor Bay/Starz for bringing this title out at a very reasonable price. Most Anime Blu-Rays tend to retail at 2-3 times what a ""hollywood"" movie do (Bandai, I'm looking at you!) - Anchor Bay released this at a fraction of what a hollywood movie costs (it tends to go on sale often, but even at its retail price it's a great bargain!)

On to the disc though.

Ghost in the Shell - it seems to go along with Akira as most peoples' first introductions to anime and still stands up today as a great movie. I'm not so great at going into the plot points of movies, so I usually leave that to the other reviewers. Overall I still love this movie.

Rather than a straight ""clean up"" on the movie, the creators went back and basically re-did a lot of it. This is done either by new computer drawn-animation (similar to Stand Alone Complex) or by adding CG. While the original does show its age in some of the CG used at the time, and it was nice to see that cleaned up with some modern graphics, I found the choices in switching animation styles throughout camera cuts to be odd. You'll see classic hand-drawn animation one second, then crisp computer-drawn animation the next, then CG models the next, then back to hand-drawn. They don't do a terrible job of pulling it off, but it's very obvious. The characters themselves ""look"" different from cut to cut, and while the CG looks great as a background it looks odd when the characters are CG models (everything looks very flat, almost amateurish but with very nice shading - hard to describe). I liked watching the 2.0 cut, but I still love the original.

As for the Blu-Ray itself:
Video was obviously very nice for the 2.0 version - everything was cleaned up nicely or recreated to give it a very crisp look. No flaws that I could notice.
Audio was also very good - if you have a nice audio system it'll make nice use of it!
Extras were perhaps the best part.. the original GitS movie! While quality isn't the greatest (I didn't notice much of a difference between the DVD release and this 1080i version), it's fantastic that they included it. Best part, it's cheaper to get this package than it is to buy GitS separately on DVD! Other extras were alright, but nothing outstanding.

Overall a very nice bundle at a great price. Ghost in the Shell + Ghost in the Shell 2.0 with great video and audio. If you don't own GitS already, pick this one up! If you did and are curious to check out 2.0, it's cheap enough that you can buy the disc and not invest much money into it.

To make it a 5 star disc, I would've liked to see some more effort put into 2.0 (the CG models were a bit ""iffy"", same goes for the blending of all 3 styles of animation), GitS (original) could have been cleaned up much nicer, and it would've been great to see some behind the scenes on the 2.0 version (maybe even an in-movie-experience letting you see both versions side by side?).",1276905600,3,2928,4.373161764705882

New computer generated 3D animation is substituted for some of the old cell animation. But the transitions are jarring. The change is hard to justify. The old animation was good, and the style was more or less consistent.

I personally think the English dubbing should have been re-done. Just something about the Major's voice has always been a little too deadpan. But basically the same old voice tracks are used.

The color of the whole film is shifted toward sepia. Everything is more washed-out and more brown than before. It doesn't look good to me.

I bought the 12"" laserdisc of GITS when it came out. The first DVD release of GITS was quite good. Maybe you will prefer 2.0, but for me it is change for change's sake. The film is worth multiple viewings, but I'll stick with 1.0, thank you.",1270339200,9,990,4.672413793103448

Added in new 3d animation that looks like something from a Playstation One or 2 at best.  Low rez, crap quality that has artifacting and residue. We're talking Youtube video quality.  I'm not impressed. Going from one type of animation type to another in mid movie is really painful.

In fact its very well done, the hand drawn animation is left largely in tact, the opening and the creation of Major is completely redone and so is her scuba diving scene and some others.

Though a cool thing about the Blu-Ray is that for those of you who haven't seen the original, the Blu-Ray comes with both the original and the enhanced version.

Also the cover art and the 4 screenshots on the back are all in CGI making me think the entire movie had been remade in CGI. I thought AWESOME! and grabbed it right then, ran home and popped it in my player......and saw almost nothing new. There is only about 3-5 minutes of ""CGI"" graphics spread throughout the movie in 5-10 second clips. The rest of the film looks exactly like my original version DVD which is still very good but has dated graphics and a washed out look to the colors. The CGI scenes were so short and few that I was very frustrated seeing the picture cut back to 1995 era graphics after seeing 5 seconds or so of wonderful CGI.

Another reviewer stated this is the original in HD well you can't get HD in a standard DVD only Blu ray ...it's not Hi Def. And putting a standard def movie on a Blu Ray Disc won't make it magically hi def either. I had watched the original DVD just days earlier and even though they say this version is ""remastered"" I truly could not see anything that made me say hmm that looks clearer or sharper or more vivid. It looked exactly the same to me on a 36"" screen. Dated and bland washed out colors not counting the CGI of course.

I know hardcore Ghost fans will buy it no matter what but if you're like me and just loved the film; already owned the original and were hoping for a brand new experience....you won't get it except for a few minutes of short CGI scenes and to me not worth the $14.99 I paid for it.

It would have truly been awesome had the movie been completely remade in CGI and in my opinion if they could do it for 5 minutes then they could have done it for the other 78 minutes as well. I would have willingly paid $50 for that. I was very disappointed.

So bottom line Ghost in The Shell 2.0 is more like V1.2 but by all means by this version if you never saw the original. This is still a great movie.

Lastly I know the purists out there see CGI as an abomination and if done poorly it is but I am a fan of ""well made"" CGI and for the record I really like the original animation just that the colors seemed ""washed out"" and on the dull side. If they could not do a full CGI version I would have preferred to have the colors touched up and made more vivid. The animation by itself is some of the best I've ever seen.

Also I am commenting on the standard DVD version. I have not seen the blu ray as I don't own a blu ray player or HDTV. I watched the film on an ""antique"" CRT Television which was state of the art 10 years ago and on a plain vanilla dvd player. But I still think my comments are valid because not everyone has $100 bills bulging from their wallets and a lot of people will still be using those ""antique"" tv's for a long time to come.

I am also a fan of the English Dub version. I hate subtitles and I know that makes me a barbarian to the purists out there :) but listening to anime in the original Japanese gives me a headache especially with those squeaky, whiny female voices. Japanese men must be really insecure in their masculinity to make all their women sound like a 5 year old girl throwing a hissyfit in a store because mommy said no to the toy they saw. So I really liked that they used the original english soundtrack. Nothing annoys me more than replacing the original voices with different actors.

As far as the special features, well to annoy the purists out there again :) I really don't care about the the directors commentaries, I just want to sit down and enjoy the movie. I also don't want to see any deleted scenes. Put them back in and give me an uncut version instead.

Well that's my 2 cents. Hope you find it helpful.",1264204800,3,3846,4.2062415196743554

The video compared to the 2 disc remastered release has been very notiably cleaned up. The director also brought back the cast from the original movie to do the voice recordings and compared to the original sounds alot better also. The original actors are older now so the voice over being redone gave this remastering a more mature sound to the movie and if your a fan appreciate that the director used the same actors again to do the voice overs again. The sound has also been redone. If you have a nice Hi-Def TV and surround sound this movie sounds and looks excellent!!The director also remastered the original musical score with a higher sounding tone that sounds alot better than the original score. I had the original Manga release from sometime ago and picked up the 2 disc original rerelease of the movie when it came out on dvd. I still like the original presentation without the CGI but, being treated to a fully remastered version of the film was a visual and audio treat. What I did not like about the release of the Ghost in the shell 2.0 is this is a bare release with no special features at all and should have been released onto dvd much better by the publisher. If you have never seen this movie at all I recommend watch the original version of the film without the CGI then watch this version to fully appreciate the movie. What I hope what will happen and since Dreamworks got the ok to do a live action 3D version of Ghost in the shell is maybe the original version of the anime without the CGI can be remastered and a Box set release along with the live action release of the film can be done with both movies and special features included in the set would give this movie a well deserved release. Hopefully the end release of this movie will be the same way Blade Runner was done countless times on DVD.For now if you don't own either version of the movie get both of them watch the original first then the 2.0 remaster. This is a very well done movie ahead of its time!!!",1263772800,2,2176,4.388613861386139
3796347,5,B001U3EONK,"You can not talk about cyberpunk without bringing up this one! This is the movie that even anime haters have seen and liked. Mamoru Oshii, director of Sky Crawlers and Patlabor pioneered anime sci-fi in the 90s with this film adaptation of Masamune Shirow's manga series.

Set in a future where androids and cyborgs are commonplace, a special Japanese enforcer unit called Section 9 gets called into handle cybercrimes and sticky foreign affairs. Matoko is a major on this team, and she and her partner Batou get called into handling a case on the illusive hacker known as the Puppet Master. After trailing some unsuspecting garbage collectors, they think they have their man, but he turns out to be another puppet himself. Then, a robot body escapes from a government cybernetics lab, and is brought into Section 9 headquarters. Two agents from the rival Section 6 show up to claim it saying that was now hosting the cybernetic essence referred to as a ""ghost"" of the Puppet Master. It reveals itself to be a living entity that was created by Section 6 to control people's ghosts, and its come to Section 9 seeking asylum. Commandos make off with the body, so Matoko and Batou take off after their getaway car. Matoko corners them in an abandonned church, although the car is protected by a robot spider tank(not a Tachikoma, BTW). She almost gets crushed by the tank, but Batou manages to stop it with a bigass gun. Matoko then dives into the Puppet Master, and he reveals to her that arranged all this in attempt to merge his programming with her ghost in order to create an entirely new lifeform. Matoko doesn't get a chance to disagree as both she and the Puppet Master's body's are totalled by Section 6 agents. Hours later, Batou was able to salvage what there was of Matoko's ghost into the robot body of a young girl, although she claims she is now longer Matoko or the Puppet Master, but their composite prodigy. She then leaves planning to spread herself throughout the net.

This movie was one of the few to actually be released in U.S. theatres in the 90s. The blend of computer graphics with Oshii's dynamic animation direction is superb. It's influence is apparent in several other American productions like Batman Beyond, The Matrix and Equilibrium. The film itself spawned off a sequal, Ghost In The Shell: Innocence, plus the Stand Alone Complex anime TV series which has a movie followup and two compilation movies. The original was recently redone in a new version, Ghost In The Shell 2.0, which is the same film, but now with new 3D graphics which add a definate bonus to it, and not in some lame Star Wars: Special Edition way. The dub is pretty good, although most U.S. otaku probably ally themselves with the English cast from the TV series instead. All in all, the 2.0 version is a paramount acquisition for your personal anime ark!",1263513600,4,2857,4.712
3796348,5,B001U3EONK,"I own three versions of this film: the Special Edition DVD Ghost in the Shell (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-in-the-Shell-Special-Edition/dp/B0002RQ2T4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost in the Shell (Special Edition)</a>), the original DVD release (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-in-the-Shell/dp/6304493681/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost in the Shell</a>) and this version, the 2.0 Blu-Ray release.  There are some flaws with the Blu-Ray, but they mainly have to do with it not being such a 'special' release.  But being a huge fan, I can't help but purchase each re-release!

The HD transfer was very well done, and most of the CG 'updating' was just replacing the old mid 90s CG with some newer CG so it doesn't look so outdated.  I don't have a problem with that as long as they aren't doing the 'George Lucas treatment' by adding in whole new scenes.  But replacing a rather dated looking CG helicopter with a newer CG rendering is not a deal breaker in my opinion.  Other than that, there are some 'tweaks' to the resolution.  Nothing that really changes anything, but along the lines of when someone like Criterion takes an old film from the 30s or 40s and cleans the resolution for newer digital formats.  You don't feel like you're watching a VHS film 'copied' onto a DVD like many of the DVD re-releases of 90s anime.  Instead you feel like watching an animation that had been intended to be digital all along.

The audio is the best and most noticeable improvement over the DVD.  The score has been remastered and the Japanese voice acting completely re-done.  And for the better in my opinion.  The new voice acting is terrific.  I have listened to it briefly with the English dubbing, but I feel the Japanese voice acting lends a more serious and authentic tone to this film.

So basically with the new and updated resolution and sound you aren't really watching the 'original' film.  Just the plot and basic settings remain the same.  Upon watching the oldest version I have (the original DVD release) you really see the improvements made.

Would I recommend purchasing this version?  Yes.  I wouldn't say it's the purest version (the original DVD takes that honor, since it is the exact version that was released in theaters in Japan and later onto VHS - which I used to own! But tossed since I don't have a VHS anymore).  But this is probably the 'best' version of the actual film.  There aren't really too many extras sadly.  The DVD Special Edition seemed to have more.  But for a very high quality version with improved voice acting and sound, this is a winner.  If you haven't seen the previous versions, this is a worthy place to start.  If you are a purist, then you probably won't like this version.  But if you can accept what the studio was attempting, then you can appreciate this version.

If you don't know Ghost in the Shell... what it refers to is an artificial intelligence becoming sentient in an artificial body.  Basically the 'ghost' is a person's soul.  The shell is the prosthetic or artificial body.  In the near future humans have the ability to transfer their brain into prosthetic bodies.  The brain retains their soul or 'ghost'.  Not everyone has the ability or funds to accomplish this, so the vast majority of people are still in their original bodies.  But many (most) people have wired implants to allow them to be online in a kind of virtual net.  Eerie!

The plot here begins when a prosthetic body acquires a 'ghost' or at least is thought to have.  Enter the Puppet Master.  So section 9, a kind of cyber police special force, gets assigned to the case.  So the team starts to unravel the plot and ends up crossing into dangerous territory.  The lines between right and wrong, friend and foe, and good and evil become blurred.  The film raises tons of philosophical questions.  Despite some scenes with a somewhat slower pace and lots of conversation (such as near the end), it never comes off as boring.  The finale is very well done and the ending is very well done. (No spoilers!)

This is a very cerebral film, and one that encourages thought and reflection.  It is also rewarding of multiple viewings.  Each time I watch it I notice something a little extra, or at least it gives me pause to think.

The film and the new HD transfer I give 5 stars.  For special features and extras I give two stars!",1262908800,4,4446,4.896782841823057
3796349,5,B001U3EONK,"Ghost in the Shell is one of the finest works of the genre.  A groundbreaking narrative about the nature of humanity and what it truly means to be alive.

Video 5/5

OK, since I'm not too familiar with the technical jargon (plus I already used up all of my good SAT words on the intro) I'll just tell you this--it looks great!  Compared to the scratchy, washed out DVD version, GitS 2.0 is vibrant colorful, and incredibly sharp.

Audio 5/5

Big explosions, loud cars, booming um...booms?  It sounds great.  The same care that was given to sharpening the video transfer went into the audio as well.

Extras...depends

The Anime purists out there will undoubtedly turn their collective noses up at the thought of their precious Ghost in the Shell undergoing an unnecessary facelift.  However, with the advent of HD technology--a lot of the CG content that was added doesn't detract from the experience but makes the film seem more polished and just fits in better than the archaic computer generated effects that were present in the original.  If you can overlook this, the wealth of new effects and content added makes GitS feel like a whole new movie.

I highly recommend picking this up if you're an Anime fan, or if you just want to show off your shiny new Blu Ray player to a room full of your envious friends.",1262476800,,1858,4.869426751592357

3796351,4,B001U3EONK,"I was hesitant to buy this blu-ray because of all the negative feedback about the new CG scenes. Luckily, I bought it anyway and was blown away. Sure, the famous opening sequence has a CGI Major now, and yes, it's as ridiculous as it sounds, but the rest of the film is magnificent. The transfer is superb, and the other CGI inserted into the film adds a layer of depth. It helps the city feel more alive. The sound is exceptional coming out of my 5.1 system (it had those rear speakers working!), and Kenji Kawai's soundtrack still sounds oh so good after all these years -- the warm blanket over a cold movie. Speaking of warmth, they've re-colored some scenes to match the sepia tones of the second film, and I think it was a great choice. The film feels more modern now. They also got rid of the green 1s and 0s in the opening sequence's text credits, which after The Matrix co-opted it, is a good thing.

If you're a fan of the movie and have any doubts about this blu-ray, don't. The original film is on the disc, but I have to say, 2.0 pleasantly surprised me and it will probably be the version I watch again from now on.",1262044800,3,1129,4.275700934579439
3796352,4,B001U3EONK,"The Blu-ray is excellent, the movie an anime classic, and overall an all time favorite. The 2.0 brought a lot of minor changes and like the revised ""Special Edition"" releases of Star Wars many of the changes were completely unnecessary.

The CGI Makoto looks odd and out of place. She looks stiff and rubbery and a generally poor attempt on Production I.G.'s part not really up to their usual standard as they have shown themselves to be capable of. She clashes horribly with much of the hand drawn animation of the rest of the film.

Makoto aside some of the other changes aren't to bad from the computer displays to some of the vehicles they are small frivulous and though they don't add much to the film at least they don't detract from the immersion as the scenes with CGI Makoto do. Unneccisary, but not bad changes to say the least.

Thankfully the Blu-ray's special features included the full theatrical video in HD though with the 2.0's (improved) audio track... Granted the ""theatrical"" version is a rip of the Laserdisk release and isn't a real film transfer but it is a great addition for the hardcore that prefer the ""original"" film.

This was the second genuine anime film I ever watched, and even after repeated viewings I've been confused and confounded by it.  It may be short and it may boast some cool action scenes, but for the most part it is a tight, complex, and highly cerebral thriller.  The combination of philosophy, psychology, technology, and politics is often overwhelming in this film.

Only recently have I been able to understand the movie's plot and issues, and I must say that it is a very sublime picture with some very deep issues concerning the human soul, technology, and society.  For that matter, each viewing does reveal deeper meaning.  On this basis, the movie not only makes for quintessential anime, but it is also an essential (and influential) piece of cyberpunk sci-fi.

The movie's plot and characters may seem muddled, but they have nuances and complexities of their own.  I do find that other features in the ""Ghost in the Shell"" series (namely, ""Innocence,"" ""Stand Alone Complex,"" and ""Solid State Society"") offer easier storylines and more understandable characters, but they are not quite as original or distinctive as what's in this film.  The movie is slowly-paced, but has lots of interesting visuals and some brilliant action scenes.  Production design features some very interesting and original sets, props, costumes, vehicles, and weapons.  Music is interesting.

For better or for worse, this disc showcases the 2.0 version, which offers enhanced CGI effects to replace certain scenes, as well as an enhanced soundtrack and a new music score.  These changes do offer a different color palette than the theatrical cut, and the image overall looks cleaner, sharper, and more detailed.  Above all, it is visually and conceptually more compatible with other features in the ""Ghost in the Shell"" series.

This disc offers decent quality.  The video looks very clean, with excellent color and contrast.  It is sharp with plenty of details; textures are strong and pencil lines are thin.  I saw no signs of visual noise, pixilation, or aliasing.  The only issue worth noting is that some scenes may have bright auras, but this is notably less intrusive on Blu-Ray than it is on DVD.  A few scenes showed some slight banding as well.  Sound quality is excellent (DTS-HD MA 6.1, lossless), and you have a choice between English dubbing and the original Japanese, with optional subtitles.  Extras include a making-of feature, character profiles, creator biographies, and a trailer.

One of the special features is the original theatrical cut of the movie.  Video quality on the original film in 1080i is notably weaker, for it shows greater pixilation, aliasing, and film artifacts.  Colors are also more washed-out, but some colors are notably different than the 2.0 version (more blues and greens in certain scenes).  Regardless, it is still a sharp and clean image.  Sound quality is good, and it has the same language and subtitle options as the 2.0 feature.",1261094400,22,3096,5.085487077534792

3796360,5,B001U3EONK,"I'm happy that a new generation of viewers may get the chance to see this groundbreaking Sci-Fi/Art movie with fresh eyes. And ears. I remember putting the film's audio on a cassette tape years ago so I could listen to it at work and in my car.. it was one of the first anime I remember that had a brilliant ambient score that drenched the film in a really eerie stoic mood. The remastered Skywalker sound soundtrack and effects track are a total joy to me, the music's dynamic range is captured better than ever, and a plethora of miscellaneous background effects flesh out the action better than ever.
In nearly every scene, the colors look deeper and more genuine than the original print.. there is alot more simulated depth of field, not only from newly inserted visuals, but just from some clever color and contrast tweaks.
And NO, I have no qualms with the added CGI elements. Mamoru Oshii approved all of them, and Oshii's ever reiterated themes in the series has always been disassociation, dehumanization and the philosophy of making dolls in human form... so for this viewer, having a few scenes where Major Kusanagi is re-visualized in an even more stylized and antiseptic digital shape doesn't bother me at all. It's the whole point of her character.

The cropping that appears in some shots bothered me a little, but I get the feeling this wasn't done because it looked good, but because there wasn't another way to fix or alter color timing in the frame without it.

The collector in me would also have preferred if the original cut of the film was included on a separate disc, but at the same time, as it's just a HD rip of the original film that I've seen a bazillion times anyway, it's not a deal breaker.

I'm happy with this version.",1259020800,8,1752,4.5910543130990416
3796361,4,B001U3EONK,"Ahh...Ghost in the Shell. The 1995 movie based on the manga that was called by some the second coming of Akira. I can't help but agree with that. So here we are almost 15 years later and we now have a sequel, a spin-off TV show, with a TV movie and it's influence is seen in movies such as ""The Matrix."" Now we have GitS 2.0, which is not a sequel (though I can see why people could be misled into thinking that.) but a redone version of the first movie. The colors has been changed and some CG has been brought in to replace the old animation. Its supposed to look more like the sequel, ""Innocence,"" but honestly it looks weird since the original movie was made 9 years before the sequel. But I'm not going to review the movie itself, I'm just going to tell you why you should buy this on Blu-Ray.

The first thing all you purists need to know, the original Ghost in the Shell is included on the disc in HD. It doesn't look that great but it looks better than the DVD for sure. Also, the transfer is not the DVD master from the 2005 re-issue simply upconverted (contrary to popular belief), it is the Blu-ray master from Japan. They didn't really clean up the film but this is pretty much the best it's ever going to look unless Bandai, Manga or Production IG want to put up the money for a full re-master.

Which brings us into the new 2.0 version. This puppy has demo worthy video. The animation has been nicely cleaned-up, the new CG pops, and the re-mixed soundtrack (which I'll get back to in a minute) can bring the house down. This is one of the best animated Blu-rays out there, up there with ""Cars,"" ""Wall-E,"" and ""Akira."" While consistency is off thanks to the new CG, new colors and old animation, but this is not the fault of the transfer.

The soundtrack for the original Japanese version has actually been thrown out the window completely. Not only are there new sound effects, but the original cast has re-recorded all their lines, with one exception: the Puppet Master. The Puppet Master was originally voiced by a man, and has now been replaced by a woman. Also the song that plays in the background during the market chase with Batou has been removed. It is such a small thing that people probably won't notice (but I brought it up for a reason).

Now, I'm going to be honest, I'm a fan of the English dub of GitS in all of its forms. When this was announced I thought for sure they would re-dub the movie with the new GitS: Stand Alone Complex cast. This is not the case. They used the original dub from 1995 for this version (So Mimi Woods is playing Motoko, not  Mary Elizabeth McGlynn from the SAC dub.) with the new sound effects thrown in. Which brings us to a inconsistency because in the 2.0 version the Puppet Master is supposed to be played a female, but instead, is still played by a man, since this is literally the same dub. This isn't the only inconsistency, the song from the marketplace is now back in the movie. There some other small gripes but only the hardcore fan would notice.

Now onto the extras. They consider the old version of the movie as a extra, and it is a pretty cool extra, having both versions in HD. Then we come into a couple of weird quirks. On the box, it says there is a commentary with the director, as well as a making of feature for 2.0. What we get is a making of feature....for the original movie and a theatrical trailer...for the original. Along with come bios and glossary. The features on the box are no where to be found, which is quite a big gaff. Maybe future re-prints will correct this but as of now, the features on the box are not there. To me, it isn't a big deal, but it kind of sucks that we don't get what the box promises.

All in all this is a must buy for every GitS fan. Not only do you get the new version of this movie, you get the original in HD. That way, you get the best of both worlds. Everyone else, give this one a rental, because this is really for the fans.

EDIT: 9/29/11 - The included original version of Ghost in the Shell is not the HD master from Japan. It is a laserdisc master, upconverted to 1080i. Also, they've fixed the back cover in later prints to have the correct features on the back. I still recommend this if you're a fan.",1257638400,135,4233,4.26932668329177

The new (or redone might be more accurate) opening scene is amazing. Even though the new visuals might not match, they are a welcome addition. It doesn't replace the original version (which is included on the disk, standard format, under special features. Note: It is not listed on cover), but it is really well done.

Most impressive, is the new 6.1 mix. They have completely re-done the sound mix, re did sound effects, and remixed levels and speaker placement. It sounds amazing.

3796363,3,B001U3EONK,"I'm going to break this review down into two parts.

The movie itself:
This is Ghost In The Shell in HD. It's beautiful, but for a smoother translation into the look of Innocence the greenish colors of the original film have been touched up and made to be more of an amber color like that seen in second film. This isn't really a change that I mind, and it's pulled off fairly well. I assume that several scenes were cleaned up digitally because the line art looks amazingly clean.

Sadly, someone felt it would be appropriate to replace some of the most iconic and stunning animation from the original with CG. A few scenes are done well like those where the CG is only helicopters or buildings, but whenever it replaces characters with crappy looking CG models it becomes stunningly bad. If you watch the making of the original movie you can see that their limited use of computer assisted animation was carefully planned and fit in with the other artwork and improved the film. The CG in 2.0 sticks out like a sore thumb in most cases. The only CG part that I liked was the pan over the cityscape at the end of the film.

If you have a bluray player and haven't seen GitS yet 2.0 isn't a bad way to see it, but fans of the original will probably be disappointed with the lack of any significant changes and the quality of what was changed.

The bluray by Manga:

Somehow Manga Entertainment never ceases to screw something pretty major up on their releases. The box lists a commentary with Oshii, an interview with Oshii and a making of GitS 2.0. None of these features are present on the bluray. You get throw away character profiles, glossary, and the old english trailer. The original making of GitS is here in VHS quality along with the unlisted bonus feature of the original cut of the movie. When I heard that I was pretty excited because in all honesty it's the only version I truly care about, but it looks to be taken from non-HD masters and only includes 2.0 audio tracks. If memory serves me correctly I believe that my GitS DVD looks better upscaled than this version does.

It would have been nice to do a re-dub of the film with the SAC cast, but I guess most of them were in the original anyway and it's a nice dub in it's own right.

This whole release just makes me want the original film untouched in HD. I can't give this less than three stars if only because seeing this movie this way is better than not seeing it at all because it's a one of my favorite films ever, but be aware of the problems with this release before deciding to buy it.",1256428800,367,2564,4.362683438155137

8342706,5,B001U3EONK,"It has both versions of the movie.  The special effects of the update are nice, but some voices are different in the update, which like Akira, throws it off a bit.  I understand they used the same actors, but I guess years later voices change.  Both are great adaptations of the source material and better than the live action version IMO.  For the best version, though, read the manga.  The Major is a complex character and more so in the source material.",1514678400,2,456,4.512195121951219
8342707,3,B001U3EONK,The cast is great; I will always love Scarlet Johansson. The story has a very workable scifi premise that I think will be less than scifi in a few decades from now.  But the script and character developments were weak.  And one of my general rules: any action movie that ends with a duel between the hero and a giant spider has the wrong people in charge (excepting Godzilla movies).,1510617600,,383,4.457142857142857
