7358415,3,B012TIKBL8,"The bitrate on most of these films averages around 3, whereas the bitrate on the older Universal box sets (W.C. Fields Comedy Collection Vol. 1 & 2 with 5 discs per set) hovers around 8. The lower bitrate on this new set creates more grain and video noise on the picture, especially noticeable wherever there are titles on the screen. This is the only collection that offers ""Six Of A Kind"", ""Mrs. Wiggs Of The Cabbage Patch"" and some others, so it is worth having. Too bad Universal felt it was necessary to cram four movies onto each disc. I was really hoping for good quality Fields on Blu-ray. Maybe some day...",1447459200,22,615,4.5
7358416,3,B012TIKBL8,"For that price for DVD's they are silly, blu ray, yeah, perhaps. BUT....fortunately it will plummet in price. I'll be in at about $40 when it happens.

Yes it is VERY good to see a new Fields release, but the only 2 things of true interest for US release for this collection is Million Dollar Legs & Tillie and Gus finally coming to real DVD's not DVDr. BUT....Why no blu rays Universal?

Anyhow, what I will type is going to most likely be the most comprehensive WC movie availability list as of 2015:

This new collection has the following 18 movies:
Million Dollar Legs - available on DVDr or genuine DVD Universal region 2, 17 movie WC Fields collection.
Alice in Wonderland (1933), - available on DVD, genuine Universal.
If I Had a Million - on questionable DVD releases or genuine DVD Universal region 2, 17 movie WC Fields collection.
Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch - available on questionable DVD releases, very little Fields content.
Mississippi - available on DVDr, questionable DVD, or official Universal DVD on Bing Crosby collection.

International House, It's a Gift, You Can't Cheat an Honest Man, My Little Chickadee, The Bank Dick - are all available on WC Fields DVD collection 1.
Man on the Flying Trapeze, Never Give a Sucker an Even Break, You're Telling Me, The Old Fashioned Way, Poppy - are all available on WC Fields DVD collection 2.

Now please note: what is listed here on collections 1 & 2 is also available on a newer single collection called W.C. Fields Comedy Favorites Collection, and at a much lower price than either of the 2 previous collections, and yes they are still single sided DVD's, just more movies on each disc. Viewing quality is the same from my experience watching them.

We then also have the following on this new 18 movie collection:
Tillie and Gus- available on DVDr or genuine DVD Universal region 2 collection.
Six of a Kind- available on a Burns and Allen Universal DVD collection.
The Big Broadcast of 1938 - available on a Bob Hope Universal DVD collection.

So, the only groundbreaking things for this new collection are the US releases of Million Dollar Legs & Tillie and Gus on real DVD's, and to a lesser degree the fact it is bringing together some Field's movies already out there on official DVD but not contained in a specific Field's collection yet.

NOW: Here's what we really need to US DVD &/or blu ray:
Tales Of Manhattan with the restored Field's scenes, Fox did release it on VHS years back, there is no good reason it can't be on DVD, it currently is not available on any official DVD release with the WC Field's scenes restored.

WC Fields 6 shorts, the amazing now out of print Criterion collection of 6 shorts needs to be re-released to DVD and to blu ray!

Follow The Boys- currently available on region 2-4 DVD or on the genuine DVD Universal region 2, 17 movie WC Fields collection or on questionable DVDr release from private collector.

Running Wild- only available on questionable DVDr releases.

Sally Of The Sawdust - the FULL 153 minute version as well as 2 shorter chopped versions are out there on DVD, let's go blu ray on the full 153 minute version and be done with it.

It's The Old Army Game- only available on questionable DVDr releases.

Her Majesty Love - only available on questionable DVDr release from private collector.

Song Of The Open Road- only available on questionable DVDr release from private collector.

Sensations Of 1945 - only available on questionable DVDr release from private collector.

David Copperfield- only available on Warner DVDr.

Anything I've missed, other than the lost Fields movies and a few very short items?

UPDATE. The RARE So's Your Old Man has been restored but not available on disc yet, see this:

7358417,5,B012TIKBL8,"I picked this up on Amazon for a good price and much less than it was when it first appeared. I was pleased with the picture quality, considering how many movies were crammed onto each disc. I'm keeping my two volumes of W.C. Fields that kept out years ago, but this collection works well for some of his lesser films like ""Mississippi"" or ""Big Broadcast of 1938."" It is also nice to have so much Fields together in one collection. I do wish Universal would do for Fields what they recently did for the Marx Brothers and create a nice blu ray collection. His movies seem to be in better condition and without the cuts that plagued some of the Marx Brothers best Paramount features.

Until a blu ray set comes out (and I'm not holding my breath), this is the most complete Fields set in the U.S. Although there are four movies to a disc, the picture quality is still quite good. It's also cheaper than buying individually some of the Fields films that weren't included in previous collections.",1499212800,2,992,4.511111111111111

7358423,5,B012TIKBL8,"The best W.C. collection I've seen out there --- and for only $20!  The only major film missing here that I can think of is ""David Copperfield"", with W.C. doing an excellent Micawber.  Also missing are cameos in ""Alice In Wonderland"" and a film he did at the end of his career (his last film appearance I believe) in which he re-creates his famous pool routine at a USO show. Other than that, all the classic and lesser-known W.C. films are here (18 total) in very good video and audio quality for a pittance, mere peanuts. So step right up ladies and gentlemen and avoid disappointment! They're going fast so order yours today before they disappear ---  (go away kid, you bother me.)",1486598400,,684,4.544715447154472

7358425,4,B012TIKBL8,"As a film collector I appreciate having most of W.C. Fields' films in one package. Some of the films gathered here are not exactly vehicles for Mr. Fields but he is always the stand-out performer in each one. I'm not too disappointed that there are few extras in this set but, after all, I purchased it for the films. The quality of the films may not be pristine in all cases but they should satisfy the fan of this character's talents. I recommend purchasing this product.",1481241600,3,473,4.511627906976744

8726563,3,B012TIKBL8,"I'll review all 18 Fields movies in this collection.  Million Dollar Legs is utterly inane.  In If I Had A Million a miserable tycoon gives a million dollar check to each of several people chosen at random from the phone book, in fascinating vignettes of what happens to each recipient--and to the tycoon himself.  International House is full of stars, stupid gags, 3 lousy songs, and not a laugh anywhere.  Tillie And Gus contains many funny sight-gags and one funny line of dialogue.  Alice In Wonderland is a real bomb--senseless, irritating, boring, with lousy songs, rotten poetry, repulsive costumes, amateurish set designs, and stupid riddles.  It couldn't be worse.  In Six Of A Kind, Burns & Allen are unfunny, and the dog is ugly.  You're Telling Me is the first movie in this set wherein Fields is clearly the star throughout.  He plays Mr. Bisbee, a ne're-do-well inventor, who befriends a woman on a train who is a real princess, but he never realizes it.  With her help, he becomes a big success.  This contains several funny, classic comedy routines.  In Mrs. Wiggs Of The Cabbage Patch, set circa 1890, Mrs. Wiggs is an extremely poor mother of five who remains optimistic.  Despite some tragedy, there is a happy ending to this sweet story.  Fields has a small role as an avaricious glutton.  The Old Fashioned Way is the story of an acting troupe putting on an awful melodrama, inducing a few mild chuckles.  Fields does amazing juggling, for which he is justly famous.  It's A Gift is Fields's masterpiece and the funniest movie I've ever seen.  Having seen it 6 six times, I always laugh until I cry, almost all the way through.  Fields plays a put-upon husband and father who has an incredible amount of bad luck, except for one major stroke of good fortune at the end.  In Mississippi, Bing Crosby demonstrates a beautiful singing voice early in his career.  Fields has a few funny gags.  Unfortunately, Fields uses a derogatory, racist slut, strikes a black servant, and brags 4 times about killing numerous Indians.  Later, out of fear of Indians, he claims to be a friend of Indians.  Man On The Flying Trapeze, a title irrelevant to the story, is the second funniest Field  s movie, with a steady stream of his own foolish acts added to unrelenting bad luck.  In Poppy None of the scenes featuring Fields seem funny.  The plot featuring his ""daughter"" is a so-so drama-romance with a happy, surprising ending.  The Big Broadcast Of 1938 tries to be too many things: an adventure, a comedy, a romance, a musical, and a dance spectacle.  Bob Hope's jokes all fall flat; Field's alcohol jokes, golf routine, and pool cue gag are all stale.  There are 2 pretty songs--the only good things about the movie--but more inferior songs.  You Can't Cheat An Honest Man is yawn-inducing, not good enough to draw a single chuckle.  Fields says and does many of the same things as in his other movies, including using a racial slur.  In My Little Chickadee there's not a laugh to be found anywhere.  In all the Mae West movies I've seen, she's supposed to act different characters, but she lacks acting range, so she always plays the same role  as a caricature of a seductress, using the same mannerisms. Fields repeats many exclamations, sentences, and routines of his previous movies.  The ""Indians"" are stereotypes that Fields calls ""savages.""  The Bank Dick is one of Fields's funniest movies, with several funny sight gags and jokes.  Unfortunately, Fields also recycles many themes, actions and phrases from earlier movies and even recycles humor from earlier in this movie.  The chase scene doesn't make much sense, and I don't understand the final scene.  I found Never Give A Sucker An Even Break dull and uninvolving.  In summary, these 18 movies range in quality from abysmal to great.",1517011200,,3808,4.796923076923077
