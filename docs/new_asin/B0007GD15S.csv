8047299,5,B0007GD15S,"Action movies made for TV IS the A-Team. Mr. T(Rocky III), Dirk Benedict(Battlestar Galactica's ""Starbuck"" in the original version), and George Peppard(Damnation Alley) are just a few of the easily recognizable actors on this excellent action TV series. The theme song, along with the one from Airwolf, is YouTube'd A LOT. I mean A LOT. One of the best action TV series EVER. HIGHLY recommended! I MEAN IT!",1286064000,,406,4.985294117647059
