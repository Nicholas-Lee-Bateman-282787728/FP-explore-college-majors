1104221,2,6305989532,"A sketchy biography only of this greatest tenor of all times.
It began with the boy singing in the street. He also sang in the church choir too etc.  It seems that it was shot somewhere in a small village in Tuscany with some reality.
Only Caruso's funeral was true. But the DVD comes with quite a bonus of a few of Caruso's arias. The sound as a whole is not bad at all.  But there is not much drama in the movie, and as a whole, it isn't really a success. If you have one or two of this master's CD, you might as well avoid it.",1053648000,2,529,3.888888888888889
1104222,2,6305989532,"If you are looking for a documentary - this isn't it. If you thought to find an anthology of the master's recordings - you won't find it here. The DVD consists of an early Italian movie about Caruso's childhood and early career. Don't get me wrong: It is not a bad movie, just dated and instead of English subtitles, the original Italian was dubbed (badly) with English voices. There are a few pages of Biography, and a few recordings from 1910. All in all, I think that whoever produced this DVD could have easily done a much better job!",1035417600,6,538,4.444444444444445

Included with this biopic are 30 minutes of rarely heard Caruso recordings from 1904 to 1916 that demonstrate his extraordinary voice.",1359072000,,413,5.0
7898987,1,6305989532,"The acting might have been beleivable in Italian, but the dubbed English was a disaster.  The voice of del Monaco sounded as if it was coming from the next room and the lip synch was so amaturish that it detracted from del Monaco's remote sounding voice.",1337299200,2,254,4.521739130434782
7898988,5,6305989532,"This is an Italian film that is dubbed into English.  So the sound quality is terrible and there are no subtitles.  However, the story itself carries the film.  While the romance is made up, it is filmed on location in Southern Italy and it is inspiring to follow Caruso from childhood to his big break as a singer in adulthood.  The young actor portraying the young boy Caruso has a winsome smile and electrifies the screen.  Gina Lollogibrida is the love interest and all in all is just plain a good film.  A neat detail on the DVD is the segment of some of the original recordings of Enrico Caruso . . . wow!  You will be spellbound.  All in all, this is a likeable movie and a rather clean one too.",1331510400,,702,4.265151515151516

This movie is about feeling good about life, about music and about yourself. Nice indeed.",1247097600,2,284,4.480769230769231

like the young boy at the beginning of the movie.  So as i was included
in my church's boys choir one day i started to sing like the young Caruso
and within seconds....i knew i didn't have the voice....but this movie
made me want to sing...so it is a powerfull movie for some and entertaining for others...but still im glad it was made and i love singers
like The great Carusso...Mario Lanza....Nelson Eddie...Jeanette Macdonald.............they do melt your heart.

7898991,5,6305989532,"VCI Entertainment presents ""THE YOUNG CARUSO"" (2 September 1953) (77 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) --- A biographical drama based on the world famous operatic tenor Enrico Caruso, from his humble beginnings in Naples, Italy to his rise to stardom --- Maurizio di Nardo plays famed tenor Caruso as a boy, while Ermanno Randi takes over the role in adulthood --- Enrico Caruso was retitled to ""The Young Caruso"" and promoted on the basis of one of its leading ladies, beautiful Gina Lollobrigida ---  the singing of Mario del Monaco is superb --- Plus over 30 minutes of rare Caruso recordings from 1904 to 1916 is a musical treat for all fans and collectors.

Enrico Caruso (born Errico Caruso; February 25, 1873 - August 2, 1921) was an Italian opera singer and one of the greatest tenors in history --- Caruso was also the most popular singer in any genre in the first two decades of the 20th Century and one of the most important pioneers of recorded music --- Caruso's popular recordings and his extraordinary voice, known for its mature power, beauty and unequaled richness of tone, made him perhaps the best known operatic star of his era --- Such was his influence on singing style, virtually all subsequent Italianate tenors (and many non Italian tenors) have been his heirs to a greater or lesser extent --- He remains famous, though he predated the publicity that would aid later stars of opera - although it should be noted that Caruso was a client of Edward Bernays (the father of public relations) in the latter's tenure as a press agent in the USA.

Caruso was one of the first star vocalists to make numerous recordings --- He and the disc phonograph did much to promote each other in the first two decades of the 20th century --- His 1907 recording of Vesti la giubba from Leoncavallo's Pagliacci was the world's first gramophone record to sell a million copies[citation needed]. Many of Caruso's recordings have remained in print since their original issue a century ago.

His first recordings, made in 1902, were for the Gramophone and Typewriter Company --- He began recording exclusively for the Victor Talking Machine Company in 1904 --- While most of his early recordings were made in typically cramped studios in New York and Camden, New Jersey, Victor began to occasionally record Caruso in the old Trinity Church in Camden, which could accommodate a larger orchestra --- During his career, Enrico Caruso made over 260 recordings and made millions of dollars from the sale of his 78 rpm records --- While Caruso sang at many of the world's great opera houses including La Scala in Milan and Covent Garden in London, he is best known as the leading tenor at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City for 17 years --- Maestro Arturo Toscanini, who conducted some of the operas that Caruso sang in at the Met, considered him one of the greatest artists with whom he ever worked --- Caruso's technique and style combined in a unique way the finest aspects of elegant, technically polished 19th Century tenor singing with the emotionally charged delivery and exciting, thrusting timbre demanded by the Verismo composers of the early 20th Century --- His final recordings were made in September 1920 and the last two selections were excerpts from the Rossini Petite Messe Solennelle --- Caruso's conductors in his recordings included Walter B. Rogers and Joseph Pasternack -- (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

Its main interest lies in the fact that it's one of Gina Lollobrigida's earlier performances; she's stunning, as always, as the love interest.",1104278400,3,311,4.654545454545454
