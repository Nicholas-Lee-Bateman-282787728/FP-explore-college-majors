8586148,4,B00CTQWHG8,"I first discovered British actress- singer-and (sometimes) dancer Jessie Matthews when I acquired the 1930s film First a Girl! released a few years ago by VCI. (See separate review). Matthews charmed me with her personality and 1930s sexiness. This made me a big fan and I searched out more DVDs of her films. I soon realized they weren't available. Then , this year, the independent reissue company VCI announced they were issuing eight more Matthews this year. Four were issued in August (including this one) and  while a few are the only known somewhat-worn copies  this one looks great. The images are crisp and clear, and the voices easy to hear.

Im a big fan of Matthews singing and  unfortunately she only gets to sing one song  and its an opera duet with a character who has escaped from an insane asylum. Yes, there is a lot of madcap action in this film (directed by the well-known British director Carol Reed, though this will appeal to fans of slapstick comedy. Theres a long chase scene in a modeling agency where you will see lots of 1938 lingerie and scantily clad girls with great legs! But, in my opinion, Matthews talents are wasted here  though she is on screen much of the time. Michael Redgrave plays her love interest. There are way too many loose ends when the film (which starts in London  and suddenly moves to Switzerland (for no legitimate reason) before ending.

So, I did enjoy the film and the print is great (thank you VCI!). But its not my favorite of their recent Jessie Matthews reissues (two more are being released later this week).

Despite the note on the package, there is not a Photo Gallery as a special feature, like the other JM volumes.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
