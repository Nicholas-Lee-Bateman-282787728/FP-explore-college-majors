8648282,2,B00J5GVCKM,This is a copy of a redemption video from England. I have a second generation dub and it has many nudity scenes not in this tape some basic to the plot.plus the picture is way too dark so often you hear voices and see nothing but a black screen or can't make out whats happening. I prefer my second generation dub. For those of you who want to know the plot. A female doctor volunteers to go to a mall town because of mysterious deaths she believes was caused by a vampire. The major keeps denying any vampire connections though the evidence is overwhelming. She stays at the house of a nobel whose niece was the original vampire and turned his son. Soon everybody is being turned into vampires except the doctor.i won't tell you what happens to her buts its kind of a neat plot twist. Director lazarexz is known for his nudity in his films and this certainly lives up to the billing in the original non cut version.there is still enough nudity in this cut version but much of it is very dark.,1435536000,,993,4.344086021505376
