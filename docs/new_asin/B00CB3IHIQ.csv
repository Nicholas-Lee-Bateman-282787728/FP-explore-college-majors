8579569,5,B00CB3IHIQ,"The 3D could have been better, but it was fake 3D anyways, so I guess it was ok. It's just hard to sit thru a long 3D movie when the 3D is so mild and pointless for  most of the movie.  Also, worth noting the picture quality of the 3D was lesser that the original blu-Ray release...felt like 720p with lots of pixeling artifacts. The steel case was awesome.  I give 5 stars for the movie, not this weak 3D release.",1444262400,,414,4.08641975308642
