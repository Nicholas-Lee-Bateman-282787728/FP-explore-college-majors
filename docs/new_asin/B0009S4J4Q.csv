They want me to order the whole collection and best yet, they are glued to the TV when I need silence and I don't have to worry about what they are watching! This is also great if you need to relax and spend time with your children. Your choice!",1193702400,,393,4.116883116883117
2317254,4,B0009S4J4Q,"The kids watch it over and over and it brings back memories for me.

The comics themselves are very simplistic, very little dialog and such. But that is what makes it great. Just good old fashion humor.",1175817600,,202,4.45945945945946
2317255,5,B0009S4J4Q,"I watched most of these films on a local TV station in 1980-1981 that aired these 30-minute shows on the weekend. I am so happy that they are finally on DVD!  The picture quality is clean and sharp on most of the films I saw! The films win on the background music alone, as they have been stuck in my head for over 25 years now! Henry Mancini knew how to come up with these strong melodies with his orchestra. I'm still humming to his other music from these films along with his famous Pink Panther theme.  Several times, the Pink Panther outsmarts everybody--the dismantling of a construction project in Prefabricated Pink, how he grants the third wish on the fairy godmother by putting skates on her in one film (so funny!), how he even one ups a robber who had a ticking time bomb in the Pink Package Plot and so forth. A few films are repetitive with the Pink Panther getting chased up hilly sidewalks by the MPs or construction workers. I can't tell you how many times I've been laughing at these films--they are so funny!  The films are still fresh and timeless to watch today--almost 40 years later to others, but 25-26 years later for me. It will get you just as hooked as the latest movie to come out on DVD.",1154995200,6,1217,4.376106194690266
2317256,4,B0009S4J4Q,"Volume 2 of this 3-volume set is not as good as Volume 1 which has the episode where Henry Mancini applauds the pink feline orchestra conductor and where you hear the Pink Panther speak.  It is much better than Volume 3, though.  For those who like the cartoons with only background music (that's what gives this cartoon so much charm), there are no voices on this DVD and, even better, a laugh track only ruins two episodes.  This DVD also includes one of my favorites: ""Pink Valient.""  If you really like PP, definitely get the 5-disc set that includes all three volumes of the Classic Cartoon Collection along with two additional discs with more cartoons and extras (no Aardvark episodes and I think there is only one episode of The Inspector, however).  The cartoons on Volume 2 are from 1967-68 and include the following 27 cartoons:

Pink of the Litter:  PP is a trash collector who finds disposal more of a difficulty.

In the Pink:  PP joins a gym and of course makes life miserable for another exerciser.

Jet Pink:  I remember this ep well because it is featured on Viewmaster reels I had as a kid (and still have).  PP tries his hand (uh, paw) at being a pilot.

Pink Paradise:  PP visits an island and runs into a hunter and his dog.  Of course, any mahem PP causes will be blamed on the dog.

Pinto Pink:  Another ep featured on my Viewmaster reels.  PP tries to ride a hilarious horse.

Congratulations, It's Pink:  PP sets out to steal a picnic basket but gets a baby in a basket instead.  At one point, he leaves it with an Indian couple and the husband becomes irate and attacks the white trading post guy.  Definitely not PC!

Prefabricated Pink:  PP is on a construction site and causes destruction.

The Hand is Pinker Than the Eye:  PP sneaks into a magician's home and encounters magic props and an amorous rabbit.

Pink Outs:  Weak episode.  Just various clips that end with a pink screen.

Sky Blue Pink:  PP tries his paw at kite-flying and terrorizes his neighbor so much he becomes the Red Baron.

Pinkadilly Circus:  After a man removes a nail from PP's foot, PP is so grateful, he insists on being the man's slave.  The man finds good use for PP against his nagging wife.

Psychedelic Pink:  (Laugh Track=LT) Very strange ep, hence the title.  PP visits the Bizarre Book Shop and wants to read ""The Love Life of the Panther"" (that's funny).  From there, the ep goes all over the place.

Come on in the Water's Pink: PP visits Bicep Beach and competes with a body builder.

Put-Put Pink: PP builds a motorbike.

G.I. Pink: PP joins the Army and the nation has never been safer.

Lucky Pink: A robber tries to get rid of an unlucky horseshoe but PP keeps returning it to him.

The Pink Quarterback:  PP chases after a rolling quarter that could buy him a hot dog or a hamburger (it must be the 1960s).

Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Pink:  PP builds a house in the view of an observation telescope.

Pink Valiant:  A favorite of mine.  A king hires PP to rescue his kidnapped daughter (who just runs around screaming).  The kidnapper ends up as the one who really needs saving.

The Pink Pill:  PP slips on a banana peel and winds up in the hospital with an annoying roommate.

Prehistoric Pink:  PP and his stone-aged buddy try various ways to move a rectangular stone.

Pink in the Clink:  (LT) PP is forced to assist a burglar.

Little Beaux Pink:  PP has run-ins with a cowboy who doesn't like PP's grazing sheep.

Tickled Pink:  PP asks his fairy godmother for roller skates and soon regrets it.  He'll get even with his fairy godmother, however.

Pink Sphinx:  PP is on a quest to find Rameses III with an unhelpful camel.

Pink is a Many Splintered Thing:  PP becomes a lumberjack.

The Pink Package Plot:  PP is forced to deliver a ticking package to the Slobvanian embassy.",1143158400,54,3804,4.505154639175258

2317279,5,B0009S4J4Q,"After watching pink panther vol. 1 every time they visit, they were thrilled there was another pink panther dvd to watch.  4 boys, ages 2, 4, 5 & 6, all laughed & enjoyed watching the entire dvd.  Even though it's music (good music) & no one's talking, they wanted everyone to be quiet so they could watch & listen.  They do this with the first Pink Panther dvd too. I personally think volume one is slightly better than volume two but I'm happy the kids love it.  I'm not sure why only the boys watch Pink Panther cartoons at our house: maybe because the step-granddaughters are too busy playing with Barbies upstairs to stop & watch Pink Panther. No biggie. Everyone's having fun.  Anyway, these cartoons I remember from my childhood, so I'm happy they are being enjoyed. I definitely noticed the boys like to laugh out loud a lot.  They want everyone to be quiet & yet they're the ones making the noise. :D  I think this dvd is 2 1/2 hours or close to it. The boys didn't sit still for the entire time: after about an hour, they were multi-tasking by playing with toys on the floor while still watching.  They just had to see the entire dvd & that they did.  Next time they came over to visit (about a week later), they wanted to watch it again but they also wanted to play wii games so they had to make a decision to play awhile & then watch this awhile.  Highly recommend to all those Pink Panther fans who already have volume one & want to see volume two. (I admit after reading some of the reviews here, I almost didn't buy it but I'm glad I took the chance as it's good).",1391040000,,1579,4.268456375838926
