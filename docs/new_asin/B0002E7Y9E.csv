8027118,5,B0002E7Y9E,"This TV film is entitled ""Over Indulgence"" in the US, as here. As a BBC film it was broadcast as ""The Happy Valley"". It is beautifully filmed, wonderfully atmospheric, and very, very moving. It is like the Jewell in the Crown but set in Kenya during the same period and it is in one long episode. It is the story of 15 year old Juanita (pronounced (h)Waneeta) Carberry living amongst the Happy Valley set and of the murder of Lord Erroll. (Juanita Carberry died in July 2013 aged 88.) The film has a cast that includes Denholm Elliott and Holly Aird and has music by Geoffrey Burgeon.

It is, in effect, only available on video. Brief clips of the film have had over 1.4 million viewings, so a DVD might well be a commercial proposition. However for a DVD to be released, John Carberry's use of the ""n"" word might need to be beeped out and the punishiment scenes might need some cutting, but with that done it would make an excellent DVD.

I am not sure if the video is in NTSC or PAL format.

There is also a fine book by Juanita Carberry entitled Child of Happy Valley.",1355356800,5,1071,4.345
