2597584,5,B000G1R402,"DEFINITELY A FIVE STAR PRODUCTION,COVERING WASHINGTON'S WELL KNOWN MILITIA SERVICE PRIOR TO AND DURING THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR ( THE JUMONVILLE GLEN,FORT NECESSITY,AND MONONGEHELA BATTLES),AS WELL AS HIS POST WAR SERVICE ON THE WESTERN VIRGINIA FRONTIER,IN COMMAND OF THE VIRGINIA MILITIA REGIMENT.IT ALSO OBVIOUSLY COVERS HIS CONTINENTAL ARMY SERVICE FROM 1775-1783, WHEN HE FINALLY RESIGNS FROM THE AMERICAN MILITARY ONCE AND FOR ALL. THE ONLY THINGS I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE SEEN INCLUDED WOULD BE A SEGMENT ON THE CONWAY CABAL,WHICH SOUGHT TO RELIEVE HIM OF HIS COMMAND LATER IN THE REVOLUTION,AND HIS PERSONAL COMMAND OF THE FORCE SENT TO WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA TO SUPRESS THE WHISKEY REBELLION DURING HIS PRESIDENCY. BUT ,OVERALL,A SUPERB DOCUMENTARY ON THE MOST FAMOUS PORTIONS OF GENERAL WASHINGTON'S LIFE.",1218412800,3,816,5.536
2597585,4,B000G1R402,"This was a very unique view of a man I have only seen on money and paintings. School and college do not do this man justice.  However, in this program you really get a better idea of the man and how antimated he was with his men and in stressful situations.",1182384000,9,257,4.03921568627451
2597586,3,B000G1R402,"Relatively well made film, the computer generated graphics that created larger number of soldiers on the battlefield and some of the other scenes was some of the best I have seen. Washington's portayer did a very good job even though he spoke VERY little during the entire film. My only issue with this was the filming in Lithuania and nothing against Lithuanians but while watching the story something just did not appear ""right"".

Very informative and energetic, can help attract even greater attention to one of the great people in American History.",1161129600,18,552,5.0
2597587,4,B000G1R402,"That is pretty much the sentiment of many of the soldiers serving under General Washington during the Revolutionary War.
Rightly so. In fact, so much of what we are today we owe to him. He set the stage for so much that followed.
This fine documentary traces the education & evolution of Washington that he obtained from his many years in the military. That career started before the French-Indian Wars. His first experienced success in pre-war diplomatic missions into the Ohio territories claimed by both the French & the British. I got the impression that he was at least, in part responsible for those hostilities commencing in the first place. He suffered embarassing losses to the French in his first command in the 1750's & some sucesses as an aide to British General Edward Braddock. General Braddock was killed in battle leaving Washington again in command of troops. This was essential to his growth as a leader. He was very brave, somtimes foolishly so. He was a colonial officer & all he wanted to be was an officer in the regular British army with his own command. But that was not going to happened. He was formally polite, reserved & self taught to behave as the gentry of the day acted. But he was loved by his men, most of them of low birth & farmers. He could inspire men to great things. If he did not win the revolution, it is important to realize that he did not lose it.
He was also the template for other generals who followed his example into the presidency. Two generals, Grant & Eisenhower were more sucessful as generals than they later were as president. Few men in history have been able to resist absolute power when it was available to them. Washington didn't even have to fight for it. To be king was there for him if he so desired. He truly loved liberty & justice over power.
This is a fine addition to the library of any school's history
dept. & has been shown recently on the History Channel. It is a bit narrow in scope but, it has the advantage right now of being the newest dvd on The Father of Our Country.",1149724800,34,2046,4.487935656836461
2597598,5,B000G1R402,"If your like me and like early history you will love this DVD. I was surprised to see this more like a movie then a documentary it was refreshing to see this in High Def color, touches on all my favorites french and Indian war, braddocts defeat, and so much more. I would highly recommend this DVD I really enjoyed this film it was Excellent! Thanks!",1358899200,,350,4.318181818181818
2597599,5,B000G1R402,"Very interesting and factual.  Wonderful depiction of Washington.  My husband is a history buff and he found this video to be accurate, while still interesting to those in the family who were not as knowledgeable.",1352851200,,213,5.057142857142857
2597600,4,B000G1R402,The movie is great if you don't know much about Washington but it does leave some stuff out. I don't think it mentioned Sally Fairfax even one time and it kind of brushed over some things in his life that I felt were important but otherwise it's a great documentary.,1333756800,,266,4.34
2597601,5,B000G1R402,"Very well done. I've come to be very skeptical of History Channel programming and I'll explain more later, but as for this .... I was very impressed. This DVD is an overview specific to Washington's military life as a British colonial and later as the General of the Continental Army. It is well done and very interesting. Obviously, to tell his entire story, even of just this segment of his life would require much more time, but this does a great job of telling and showing key points on Washington's and our country's history. The character, education and results of George Washington are well represented here.

I was originally skeptical because I've seen some programming from the History Channel where the politics of the program creator, presenter seemed to me to be front and center in slanderous and misinforming ways. Most recently, I watched the ""founding fathers"" and ""founding brothers"" History Channel DVDs. Do not waste your time on those. I don't think the Karl Marx fan club could have made a worse presentation of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. It was a ridiculous assault disguised in the form of a historical production. Seriously biased against small government Jefferson and Madison and drooooling over big government, American Monarchy advocating Hamilton. Garbage.",1307059200,,1295,5.137440758293839

2597603,3,B000G1R402,I feel that the authors tried to present a balanced view of Washington.  In trying to present this balanced viewpoint I feel they spent too much time on his errors and minimized his accomplishments.,1277683200,6,198,4.823529411764706

2597606,5,B000G1R402,"This DVD is one of A&E's/History Channel's best productions.  Everything in this video is brilliant: the soundtrack, the high definition video quality, the costumes, the narrations and the dramatizations.  If only all historical videos were of this caliber, there would be more people interested in history.
This DVD should make all Americans feel patriotic.  A&E/History Channel did a very good job portraying General George Washington in this video.",1229731200,3,451,5.602941176470588

8128468,5,B000G1R402,"I just watched this on the History Channel. It's must viewing, a remarkable, inspiring, documentary on George Washington the Warrior who lead from the FRONT, whose Army came to love him as a man of the highest integrity who cared for their well-being in the most trying of times during the War for Independence against the tyranny of the British.

http://www.amazon.com/History-Channel-Presents-Washington-Warrior/dp/B000G1R402

When you see the unbelievable sacrifices made by the Continental Army to secure our country under God of the Declaration of Independence intended by the founding fathers, when you see the incredible hardships that these men underwent to secure our unalienable God-given rights which no man can take away, you would be hard pressed not to believe that what happened in regard to the Revolutionary War was not an act of God against all odds.

These things need to be remembered in the trying times in which we now live where the tyranny of the British has been replaced with the tyranny from within by traitors masquerading as Americans who, in despising our military and everything and anything American, deserve nothing but the highest contempt and RESISTANCE TO THE FACE from Americans in more than name only in following the example of a remarkable man, George Washington the Warrior, a model for what it means to be a military leader and President, who had the humility to walk away from power for the sake of the country he loved! - A Vietnam War Navy Veteran",1422316800,,1492,5.056910569105691

8128473,3,B000G1R402,"I wasn't sure how many stars to put, because the documentary is great, but the DVD itself is defective. I've showed this to my American History students every year, and they love it. It's very informative, and fbrings my curriculum to life.  However, for the first few years, I borrowed my co-workers copy. Finally, I decided to just order my own. On my copy, when you put it in the DVD player, the movie starts immediately with no introduction. The DVD Menu button won't work, so I can't scene select (it's too long to show in one class period, so scene select is crucial). I sent it back and ordered another one - same thing. My co-workers copy works fine. We tried her copy in my DVD player and my copy in hers, and it's definitely the DVD, not the equipment. So frustrating!",1388016000,,778,4.440559440559441
8128474,5,B000G1R402,"This was a wonderful Video, which covered the early life of George Washington.  Very enlightening and educational.  I highly recommend this video to anyone, having an interest in those responsible for the founding of our country.",1373241600,,229,5.333333333333333
