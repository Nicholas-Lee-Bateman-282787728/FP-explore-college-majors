I really wish they put the Ebizuka trio in this film, that would've made the movie a lot better. Kirishima, Honjo and Sugihara should be at the top during this movie, but nowhere to be found! A bunch of cool fight scenes which take place in familiar Suzuran areas(such as the GPS pool hangout, Top of the Suzuran roof, the bar/club, The Suzuran school bike rack, etc.) I give this movie a good 3.8/5. If you're a fan of crows zero, definitely check this movie out. Just don't expect it to be as good as the first two.",1458000000,,657,4.140625

8689671,3,B00PX8M5WA,An attempt at a revamp but didn't do a great job. First two movies had a much greater storyline.,1440115200,2,96,4.105263157894737
8689672,2,B00PX8M5WA,"Horrible writing, its hard to care about characters you never really get to know. Why is Ken Katagiri still in this series!? That was time we could've used to get to know more about the lead characters. No mention of the high school trio of freshman who should've been fighting for power? They owned the first years by movie 1 and no show in 3. This could've been just as good as Crowz 0 if they did it right but I was let down some decent fights the new guy close to ruling the school was pretty cool, loved his hammer fist punch but once again we don't really get to know him. Bad addition to the series.",1426896000,3,606,4.1440677966101696
