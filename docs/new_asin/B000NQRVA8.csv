8181049,5,B000NQRVA8,"I was in the middle of watching this movie as a rental, when I got up and bought it.  I grew up in Caracas, so I am not only familiar with its slums, but also with the fantastic music  program that has rescued thousands of kids from a life of violence and misery-- just watch Dudamel direct the Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra, which is now famous worldwide.  By the way, the director and creator of the script  is Solveig Hoogesteijm, not Victor Cuica, and the girl playing Maroa comes from the slums depicted. The best Venezuelan film I have watched, even better than ""The Liberator"".  Ideal for classroom showings!",1437696000,,615,4.605504587155964
