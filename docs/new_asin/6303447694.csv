As other reviewers have noted the music is ""dubbed"" I'm not sure it's dubbed I believe they use music that was not original music.  I think they used the songs the skaters skated to but they did not use the original music the skater skated to.  It was heartbreaking to see the 5 second blur of Natalia Mishkutenok and Artur Dmitiriev in their purple cloud routine and to not see the entire performance.  Lucky for me I do have that routine in my video library.

I love figure skating and I thought this video would show the entire performances with reviewer commentary.  Nope.  I like what is on the tape.  I'd never sell this tape because I like having a historic record of skating programs.  Beware if you purchase this tape you'll probably be disappointed.

I really want to add that I wish ALL televised skating performances were archived and available for sale to fans.  The networks could make so much money by offering these tapes/DVD's for sale.  As evidenced by the sale of these scant videos on Amazon there is a market for skating videos.",1129680000,6,1145,4.586206896551724
7847079,3,6303447694,"As other reviewers have stated, the number of perfomances is few, however, there really aren't many sk8ing video's from the mid-90's to buy. So, if you REALLY enjoy watching sk8ing from during that time period, and don't mind dubbed music and some cut down programs, you'd enjoy this compilation of sorts. If not, don't buy it...",1040860800,3,329,4.892857142857143
