8542254,4,B009JKAXA4,I choose this product for my Grandson that loves educational movies.  These seem a little on the amateur side but he loves them.  He has learned from the ones he has seen and excited to see about the others.  Would recommend these for small kids.,1378684800,,246,4.4222222222222225
8542255,1,B009JKAXA4,"If I had seen a sample of these beforehand, I would not have bought them.  Luckily I got them at a special price via Livingsocial I believe.  There is something about it that puts chills down my spine.  It is very ""home-made.""  I could have done a better job myself.  Also, my toddler is uninterested.  He loves shows like Team Umizoomi and many others on PBSKids, NickJr, and Disney Jr.  He has learned a lot from these cable shows as well as from flashcards bought at Walgreens.  Save your money!",1376092800,,498,4.455555555555556

8542257,4,B009JKAXA4,"Bought these for my two-year-old twins at Christmas, and have been really impressed with them so far. The dvd's are really simple vocabulary builders that the kids seem to enjoy. The disks aren't very long, but they keep the kids entertained and they have been repeating the stuff they are prompted to learn by watching them. Everything in the dvd's is colorful and that helps keep their attention on the video. Overall I think this is a pretty good deal for the price. I'd recommend it to other parents.",1359072000,2,504,4.674157303370786
