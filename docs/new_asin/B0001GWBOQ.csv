2000661,4,B0001GWBOQ,"This was the collection of Andrew Lloyd Webber pieces that my wife and I were looking for!  This is a great value and very entertaining.  I would have to agree with another reviewer, and that is the only thing that would have made this the perfect collection, was some sort of documentation that would have given the particulars for each of the DVDs.",1241136000,4,350,4.5396825396825395
2000662,3,B0001GWBOQ,"Cats - This DvD performance is a must have and that is all there is to it. A brilliant piece of work with very good bonus features. I am in awe of such raw and amazing talent that this DvD contained.

Joseph - This DvD perfomance was fine, actually more than that. Though the sound quality was not brilliant, but the over all performance was divine. Very very good!

Albert Hall - This DvD performance was good. Michael Ball was as ever out-standing as were the other members of this fine collection. HOWever I did feel that Michael Crawford was missing when it came to Phantom performances, even though Antonio Banderas did a respectable job, you will never be able to rid my love of Crawford's angelic yet haunting voice.

Jesus Christ - This DvD performance was laughable. Never in my life would I have imagined that the brilliant works of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice could be butchered in such a horrible way. After seeing Cats the DvD I had high hopes. I believe the phrase being ""let down"" does not even begin to describe the emotion caused by this sorry excuse of a musical.

Everything about it, was a piss ass poor job. Jesus was fine, not good, but able, Mary also was not too bad, and King Herod, despite his brillance as an actor was terrible in this. However I think the prize definately goes out to Judas. I do believe a tap-dancing mute giraffe would have performed much better than this over-acting, deaf-toned, poor excuse for a 'performer'. Not only do I feel that I should get my money back, I feel I should be able to be given money for enduring it as long as I did. I am honestly disgusted in how the editors didn't cut out majority of the musical. If they did so, they would have been left with possibly 15 - 20 minutes of film and it would have been passable.

I am literary in shock! I think I need to watch 'Cats' again and regain my love for theatre from scratch. If you love yourself and love musicals and especially Jesus Christ Superstar, I beg of you  don't even consider looking twice at this absolute rubbish since it will burn your eyes right out of your head, leaving you in much disdain, like me, and confused as how talent has been replaced with used toilet paper.

Thank you.",1146960000,7,2217,4.405867970660147
2000663,5,B0001GWBOQ,"I love this entire collection.  When I bought this, I wasn't very excited about Jesus Christ Superstar, because I thought it was the 1973 version.  Imagine my delight when this was in fact the updated version of the show.  An amazing cast draws you into the story, and finally Judas does not appear simply as a traitor or a psycho, but as someone tormented.

Royal Albert Hall Celebration--Wow!  All I can say is I would love to have my 50th Birthday party like that.  Hoards of stars appear singing ALW's wonderful compostions.",1133913600,7,528,4.684782608695652
2000664,4,B0001GWBOQ,"Good collection of A.L.Webber's most popular musicals + Albert Hall Celebration. Only problem to take into account when ordering from Europe: All DVD's are Area 1 (North America) encoded, so most DVD players in Europe would not play them (Philips, Samsung).",1125878400,3,257,5.2926829268292686
2000665,3,B0001GWBOQ,"My kids (and I) like Joseph and Technicolor Dreamcoat. It's very visually stimulating/captivating (bright vivid bold colors), lots of dancing, lots of singing and catchy tunes.  However we turn the sound up when the brothers are singing; Joseph and the narrator lady come across loud and clear - just the brothers seem too low/soft.",1116979200,8,332,5.148148148148148
2000666,3,B0001GWBOQ,"I am very disappointed in the packaging and the lack of documentation.  They should have included the track listings and any documentation that has been included in the individual DVD packaging.  I was especially disappointed that on the Royal Albert Hall performances where there is no listing of the songs, which show they are from and who is performing them.  I was hoping to find a track listing here at Amazon but I have not found one yet.",1104105600,15,444,4.666666666666667

8012483,5,B0001GWBOQ,"This is a great selection!  Truly some of Andrew Lloyd Webber's best.  My family has always loved Joseph and the Technicolor Dreamcoat and have seen in on stage in many venues as well.  Cats has been a long time favorite of my youngest daughter, starting at the age of 8 til now 22!  Phantom is a classic that everyone loves.

8012485,4,B0001GWBOQ,My wife and I disagree over Webber's work.  I find most of his songs mediocre but agree every show has a couple of outstanding songs.  This CD allows us to only listen to the songs we like best.,1353369600,,194,4.078947368421052
