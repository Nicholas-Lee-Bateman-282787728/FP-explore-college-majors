8429333,4,B004H5SAYW,"I am a longtime fan of TV Carnage, and while ""A Sore For Sighted Eyes"" has the best title of the series and contains much that is hilarious, it's not one of my favorite installments though still well worth watching. A concise summary of the content is impossible, but I will mention a few highlights. The DVD opens with Rosie O'Donnell shopping for toilet seats in a challenging series of scenes. If that's not disturbing enough, we quickly move on to Colin Powell performing a version of ""YMCA"" in a construction helmet, though nothing can really prepare you for Mike Ditka rapping with The Grabowskis. Not being a football fan, it's probably just as well I didn't fully understand this understated and nuanced performance. Speaking of nuanced, how about Polish breakdancers performing for the pope or a cursing fire hydrant swearing at kids?

After all that it was positively uplifting to see excerpts from one of Jan Terri's more famous music videos, ""Losing You"", before Erik Estrada talks to kids about abstinence. Because abstinence doesn't sell as well as sex though, we are immediately thereafter thrust into an infomercial featuring Ron Jeremy for Extenze. That will doubtlessly make you think of romance, so up next is disturbing footage from Darth Vader's wedding, before moving along to the lamest skateboarding competition ever held. Just when it was beginning to get boring, ""Stairway to Stardom"" saves us with Lucille Cataldo's astonishing song ""Hairdresser"" (good luck getting that out of your head for the next week). But wait, there's more! Mr. T sings a ditty glorifying motherhood, and oh no, what's this unholy terror? I will only say one word: mime.

The DVD has a few extras but most are not worth mentioning. The commentary is occasionally amusing but not worth the two hour investment to watch it again. There are a few other extras but the only one I found even vaguely entertaining is ""The Greatest Song Ever"" which takes the viewer to the unabridged music video of ""Losing You"", which is especially offbeat and upbeat given the subject matter. Anything from Jan Terri is guaranteed to bring a smile to your face if you are a fan of outsider music (which I am), and here it was the delicious cherry on top of a somewhat above average sundae made with store brand ice cream.",1473379200,2,2300,4.849872773536895
