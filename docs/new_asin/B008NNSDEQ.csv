5170578,4,B008NNSDEQ,"I was only 4 when this movie (the last American film by famous director Jules Dassin) came out, and I didn't even know it existed until decades later.  It's basically a remake of John Ford's famous old film, ""The Informer"", only instead of a disgruntled, alcoholic Irishman who's just been kicked out of his local IRA chapter ratting out his friend to the Black and Tans for money, it features a disgruntled, alcoholic, middle-aged African-American unemployed ex-con former steelworker, who's just been kicked out of the local Black Panther-style revolutionary group, ratting out his friend to the Cleveland Police for money.  The viewer gets to see quite well all the reasons that led up to the main character, ""Tank,"" selling out his good-looking, charismatic friend, even though Tank is bewildered even at the end as to why he did it.

The storyline gets heavy-handed at times, particularly during a scene where the revolutionaries lecture a white activist before tossing him out of their meeting.  The acting also ranges from good to wooden and there are some scenes where dialog appears to have been dubbed later, causing everybody to speak very slowly instead of at the pace of natural conversation.  For some reason, most of the African-American characters also lack any trace of a regional accent and instead speak like elocution trainees, which fits in some cases (Clarence ""Daisy"") and not others (Tank).  It's still a pretty good story though, and the scenes where no one is talking much and you're just getting strong visuals over Booker T and the MG's soundtrack are fine film work.  There's also a truly inspired scene where drunk Tank spouts off about race to a bunch of clueless white limousine liberals in an amusement arcade, while they're all standing in front of funhouse mirrors that distort their faces into expressions you have to see to believe. Although you might not recognize names of the principal actors apart from Ruby Dee, several of their faces, especially Roscoe Lee Browne (as Clarence ""Daisy""), will likely be familiar if you watched a lot of blaxploitation films, made for TV movies, and police shows.  Robert DoQui, later of ""Nashville"", also makes an appearance as a street speaker.

Filmed on location in Cleveland, this is also a great movie for seeing old Cleveland from the 1960s.  Sohio gas stations, Eagle Stamps signs, the ""Hough Area"" while it was partway in the process of burning down and long before it was partially rebuilt, the Flats before it became a nightlife center in the 80s, the Terminal Tower, all make an appearance. I doubt any white people in Cleveland were interested in seeing this movie when it came out in the midst of race riots and white flight, but you'd think that 50 years down the road it would get more love for its nostalgia value.",1423180800,,2805,4.89873417721519

5170581,4,B008NNSDEQ,"This film is a superbly executed slice of late-60s racial unrest.  It is tough, realistic and even inflammatory - so much so that it baffles me how such a thing could have been made let alone released only eight months after MLKs assassination.  I bet plenty of movie houses were queuing up to release this one in such racially-charged times (sarcasm).

""Uptight"" accurately captures the feelings and concerns in the African-American community at the time and together with the gritty locales and cinematography make for a really engaging viewing.  The weakness is the poor performance of the lead man.  The lead role itself is unsympathetic.  It concerns a guy who rats out on his buddy in the black power movement and as such would require an actor of considerable skill to tease out the positives in his character.  The cat who plays the lead role plays it as a snivelling, self-piteous back-stabber whom no audience both then and now would find attractive.  Its a major let-down and the one flaw in an otherwise excellent acting crew.

The Blu-Ray transfer is a resounding success - a gritty stunner with strong film grain and intense detail for its time.  No digital manipulation in evidence here.  Locales, interiors and facial expressions are rendered with suitable authenticity.  I particularly dug the scene in the dive bar where you get the opportunity to really analyse some of the fashion choices back then (and I will certainly be using some of these choices).

And finally, of course, the soundtrack.  Tight, precise and muscular in true Booker T & the MGs style.

Great60s film and excellent video transfer.  Get it.",1411689600,4,1631,4.91941391941392

5170584,5,B008NNSDEQ,"After owning one...or two condensed bootleg video versions of Uptight,  I am extremely happy to see this film get an official uncut  Blu-ray release with much greater picture clarity. This movie was beautifully written to the screen, and is one of the very first of the new era black films shortly following the tragic killing of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968.  Frank Silvera's superb role as the political candidate attempting to calm Raymond St. Jacques (also marvelous) and other black militants bent on revolution, is truly a great confrontational work of art. I also wanted this beautiful uncut version for the character Tank, in the house of mirrors carnival scene (a most important piece of footage) which is missing from the bootlegs I had previously bought. Without giving away the plot, I want to say the parts played by Ruby Dee and Roscoe Lee Brown were also dynamic. Max Julien (The Mack) had a part too short-lived. I believe more of his cool demeanor would have added even more to an already well-produced movie. I highly recommend this Classic.",1399852800,7,1075,4.895604395604396

5170587,4,B008NNSDEQ,"Three things distinguish this film.  First, it's a story that takes place shortly after MLK was assassinated, depends on that event for its setting, and it was released just 8 months later.  It effectively paints a picture of a time and place.  Second, it's a strong story about the relationship between the personal and the political.  Finally, it has my favorite soundtrack of all time.  I love what Booker T and the MGs did with this material.",1356998400,11,446,4.740259740259741

8529130,5,B008NNSDEQ,"This film is truly a overlooked masterpiece. I consider it in many ways the ""Do The Right Thing"" of the 1960's and it hits with as much force (maybe even more in these current times of social turbulence) now as it had to have hit those few lucky enough see the film in theaters in 1968. Every time I view ""Uptight"" I find myself repeating, 'I can't believe this film was made in 1968' over an over. It's so prescient, so intellectually grounded, and handled with such deft. Much of the power of this film's ""message"" comes from the brilliance of director Jules Dassin (legendary direct of other masterpieces such as ""Rififi"", ""Brute Force"", the noir masterpiece ""Night And Fog"", and many more). No child to radical politics, Dassin, Ruby Dee, and Julian Mayfield (who puts on a performance for the ages as the film's central character ""Tank Williams"") crafted a brilliant  ""updated"" and geographically diferent screenplay based around Liam O'Flaherty's legendary novel ""The Informer"", which was also the basis of John Ford's 1935 film of the same name. However, rather than political strife on the streets of Dublin, in ""Uptight"" we are stuck in the cauldron of industrial Cleveland in the days immediately following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. This film is centered around a group of radical black activists who in the wake of King's death aim to go militant, the tragic results of a botched gun-depot robbery, a down an out alcoholic ex-steel worker and wanna-be radical ""Tank Williams"", and a $1000 reward. What follows is socio-political melodrama that is so incendiary, intense, vibrant and cutting-edge I feel it may have almost been too bleakly intellectual for its time. I say this because watching now it seems as if we are in the exact same situation with the same political, racial, economic, and simply ethical conflicts.
One could if they chose simply watch this film as a very late noir set in technicolor and the middle of the urban racial/economic strife of the mid-late 60's. However, there is so much more to chew on with Uptight. Dassin's brilliant ""carnival speech freak-out"" is one of the most visually astounding sequences ever shot, almost like Fellini on LSD crossed with the hilariously black comedic undertone of the reality of our ridiculous racial fears. There is also a beautiful subplot between Tank and his ex-love (now stuck on welfare with two children and forced to occasionally prostitute herself to feed her family) played wonderfully by Ruby Dee.
I simply marvel that this film was actually made. That such scorching subject matter (including homosexuality as well) be treated so deftly in a year (1968) many consider one of the USA's most turbulent is quite a feat. The film is brilliant technically (the art direction is outstanding, especially the tragic scene of Johnny's demise and the 3-4 story balconies filled with people), the screenplay is just fantastic, it has tons of tension and action as well as moments of supreme tenderness and introspection. It's an uncompromising film which does not leave us with the answers, but urges us forward in pursuit of them. Truly, one of the greatest and sadly overlooked films of the 1960s and further proof of the brilliance of Jules Dassin!",1480550400,3,3247,4.957798165137615
