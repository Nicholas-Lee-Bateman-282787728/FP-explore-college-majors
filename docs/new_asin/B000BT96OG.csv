2440020,5,B000BT96OG,"If you don't have the rights to an episode, that's just too bad.

As far as the quality of volume 1, though, it was THE BEST I've seen yet. I was more happy with volume 1 than all my other copies COMBINED! (I'm trying to collect all 274 episodes.)

It looks like we (us collectors) are just going to have to buy from a lot of different companies. I think I got the missing Christmas episode for something like $10... I would recommend the BrentWood version of this since it doesn't appear MPI can produce it. (Amazon sells it under the name of ""Beverly Hillbillies 1"" It has a picture of everyone riding in the old pickup.) It's missing the original intro music, but the quality is great.",1136592000,18,688,4.3671875
2440021,5,B000BT96OG,"For all those giving these sets 1 star, it is so unfair.  These are great sets.  MPI has released or will release in February every episode it has the rights to so cut them a break.  Later in 2006 I am told Paramount will pick up where MPI left off with season sets.  So you will be able to get every episode (the Christmas episode in season one is available in another collection but it IS available).

P.S. All the people complaining about these sets will be wishing MPI was still releasing them after Paramount delivers their sets with no real extras, scratchy film, and missing scenes.",1133136000,39,589,4.4672897196261685
2440022,5,B000BT96OG,"What are you folks griping about!  Volume 1 was great, great extras and the theme music.  Yes, I would like the entire season, but this is much better than any collection thus far, so let's enjoy!  Volume 2 gets 5 stars as well!",1132012800,36,228,4.255813953488372
2440023,1,B000BT96OG,I think somone at Mpi Media Group is just stupid or don't have a clue of what there doin im going to do the same thing i did with vol. 1 not buy it i never buy volumes there junk to me i want compleat seasons. There are to many other season sets i want before i buy this junk. I hope theye get stuck with them and have to sell them in the walmart bin for $5.00 thats what will happen if no one buys them. So people don't buy teach Mpi Media Group a lesson. I did not and won't buy Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 ill wait for seasons keep them.,1131926400,11,530,3.6578947368421053

2440090,5,B000BT96OG,There are some issues with the quality of the transfers.  While the disks are factory pressed it seems some of the transfers came from damaged film.  There were streaks going through it from time to time.  The bonus smoking commercials were really neat though.,1376352000,,260,4.863636363636363
2440091,4,B000BT96OG,"this is the best way to buy it even though it is not perfect.  to get the first season you gotta get these.  these were the ones that the creator's estate still had the rights for and are a bit grainy in parts but the quality of the show is good enough that it is worth it.

harmless, wholesome humor here.  some of the funniest stuff you'll watch.  so improbable and extreme that you can feel ok laughing even though it is at someone else.  they had a formula that worked all the way through and a cast that could execute it on the whole.

think i recall enjoying the extras on these ultimate collections a whole lot.  lots of times extras with old shows are no good but i found that these were :)

season 2 and 3 are on DVD also but not on these collector sets and are not grainy.  wish they would release the rest of the seasons.",1370217600,,832,4.080246913580247

2440095,3,B000BT96OG,"The Henning family and Paramont need to release all the seasons for those who love this series.  It is ridiculous that everything is or has been released to DVD now-a-days, but not this series.  You would think that with all the hard work and great comedy in this series, the owners of the copyright would want the actors, directors, managers and staff to be remembered for all their great work.  But instead, I am sure someone somewhere is unhappy with the money that will (or will not) be paid to them, so therefore, lets forget about the great comedy and worry about the greed factor.",1359676800,2,587,4.571428571428571

2440097,5,B000BT96OG,"The Beverly Hillbillies Ultimate Collection Volume 2 is yet another wonderful set in the same way as Volume 1 is wonderful. It features the final nine episodes of the first season and the first eighteen episodes of the second season. This series premiered on the CBS TV network in 1962 and ran for a total of nine seasons. For the first two seasons, this was the #1 watched show on TV. It has also been rerun in syndication lots of times and as a result of that, many new fans have discovered the series and became part of this unique pop culture phenomenon known as The Beverly Hillbillies. Volume 2 offers more of the same and then some of this wonderful, classic and still as funny as heck TV show.

This DVD set, like it's predecessor and it's follow-up, offers episodes that have been digitally remastered using the original episode negative that are owned by the estate of the late Paul Henning for not only superb quality, but far more superior quality than of those previously issued public domain DVD sets. Likewise, it is also the only set that is approved of and authorized by the estate of the late Paul Henning. It also has original cast sponsor commercials. Episode commentary by Stephen Cox, who is the author of the novel called The Beverly Hillbillies Book. It also has interviews with the cast members and special footage. Volume 2 offers the rest of the first season and the first half of the second season as this also makes mincemeat out of all those public domain issued DVD sets. It is also, alongside it's predecessor and it's follow-up The Beverly Hillbillies/Petticoat Junction Ultimate Christmas Collection, the definitive Beverly Hillbillies set as it has all the stuff that those public domain DVD sets lacked and also missed. It is also well worth the price that you pay for them.

MPI Home Video does a wonderful job with Volume 2 and it's predecessor and it's follow-up. As stated, the episodes are digitally remastered from the original episode negatives owned by the Paul Henning estate for superb and superior quality. The episodes audio sounds great and also, the episodes look fresh, clean and new as the day that they were initially shown on the CBS TV network. It doesn't get any better than this.

This and it's predecessor and it's follow-up, are THE ones to have and own in your DVD library. Whether you watched it during it's first run or discovered the show in syndicated reruns like myself, this set is THE one to own and to keep. Once you have this and it's aforementioned Ultimate Christmas Collection, you will never watch those public domain DVD sets anymore. In fact, you just might get rid of those public domain DVD sets once you have these. Likewise, this is THE best collection yet and again, MPI Home Video does a wonderful job on this set.

This is THE one set to own alongside Volume 1 and the aforementioned Ultimate Christmas Collection. No true blue Beverly Hillbillies fan should be without this set in their DVD library.",1326240000,5,2982,4.706896551724138
2440098,4,B000BT96OG,I bought this item for Father's Day for my husband.  He loves the old shows.  One really neat thing about it is that you get to see all the old commercials built into the show.  There are alot of Winston cigarette  and Kelloggs cereal commercials.  They are really fun to watch.,1215648000,3,278,4.372549019607843
2440099,5,B000BT96OG,This is a great collection that comedy and tv fans should have.  All of the shows included are very funny.  It's a one of a kind series.

2440100,2,B000BT96OG,"As stated in other reviews, the reproduction quality is not what it should be and could be.  Some body needs to start this series over,  do it right,  and do all 9 seasons,  season by season.",1208563200,7,191,4.222222222222222

2440102,2,B000BT96OG,"I love watching the BH's and wish all episodes would be on the market.

2440104,5,B000BT96OG,I had no trouble with the audio or video that some pepole spoke of. I watched them on a 50' plasma and they were of suberb quality. Still funny after 45 years,1173916800,5,158,3.96875
2440105,3,B000BT96OG,"I was excited to watch the extras so I immediately put in disc 4.

I watched the 4th disc and was horrified to see multiple white emulsion scratches in most of the episodes.  This transfer was made from Paul Henning's personal 16mm film collection which has gotten scratched over the years.  Too bad they didn't work a deal with Paramount for access to the 35mm fine grain negatives!

That said, the extras are great!  And I am glad they restored the origional sponsored titles!  ""K E doulble-L O double-Good Kelloggs best to you"" is sung by Earl as part of the opening theme as the Clampetts drive past a Kellogg's billboard (in Beverly Hills?).  Other episodes have the Clampetts pass a large truck with a WINSTON ad on it's side, the goodness of cigarettes is sung as part of the opening theme.

The cast commercials have been removed from the shows and stuck back-to-back on disc 4 as an extra.  I am glad to have these as they brought back fond memories, but since these were story specific (the story line is carried over as the concept for the commercial) I would have prefered these to be left intact in the episodes they played in.

It is quite out of character to see the Clampetts talking of the goodness of Winston Cigarettes!

The 1966 interview with Irene Ryan on Art Linkletter's show is also priceless.  This is something that could have been lost forever, thankfully it has been saved!

We should be glad for these wonderful extras!",1141948800,67,1449,4.591439688715953
2440106,1,B000BT96OG,"First thing out of the gate, I understand that the estate of ""Hillbillies"" creator Paul Henning owns the rights to roughly the first 55 or so episodes of the series, and I understand the desire of his family to cash in.  But instead of brokering a deal with Paramount (which apparently owns rights to the remainder of the series), and releasing complete, quality, season by season sets for a percentage of the royalties, we're left with this swill: all of the first season, and about 85 percent of the second season, spaced out between two four disc sets. This of course, minus the Christmas episode, which MPI has decided to market as a separate disc, to make more money!!

  That being said, the thing that irritates me most about this set, is the picture quality.  Where did these film prints come from? They are of substandard quality.  As with volume one, nearly every episode has a series of scratches in the film, that leave trailing lines up the center of the screen, for the first 30 seconds of so of each show.  They are so distracting, that one can't even enjoy the episode without being distracted by jumpy picture, lines, washed out black and white contrast, or other issues pertaining to the film.  One episode, the Thankgiving one, has a big blurry spot that appears on the left side of the screen.  This is unacceptable.  Especially when you see the same episodes on televison, in BETTER quality than they appear on the DVD set! The producers of this set have obviously gone to a lot of trouble to dig up lots of bonus material for both volume's 1 & 2.  If they really cared, they should have remastered the picture and sound from the original film negatives OR lowered the price of the set to around 13 dollars or so.  This set is so cheap, that is doesn't even include a booklet.  So you have no information about the episodes, nor any idea which ones are even on the thing.

  I feel absolutely fleeced by this purchase, and hope that Paramount will do a better job on future Hillbillies releases.",1141171200,61,2016,4.558333333333334
2440107,5,B000BT96OG,"The first collection was put together brilliantly, and I am sure that collection 2 will be just as great.  The special features alone are worth the price of the sets.

Shows are hillarious, but the quality reeks. Several times per episode the picture ""whites out"", perhaps where the cuts for syndication occurred. (Based on playing time, I think most of these are uncut, but poorly edited.) Scratch stripes are seen throughout, and the cast commercials and second half of the intros (Winston or Kelloggs) should appear with each episode, not at the end of the box. These classics deserve better.
