7932099,3,B000056HOU,"Yushiro and Miharu are on the run and trying to find the secrets to Yushiro's past. The military and the Gowa's are both after them. They seek answers and power hidden in their DNA. Meanwhile, Yushiro's teammates are faced with a berserk TA and squad member. Genetic alterations have caused a friend to go mad and out of control.

This anime has a very interesting premise. It has a very well written story. I was really enjoying it up to this point. I'm starting to get discouraged with it though. Even though some mysteries are solved, new ones arise. My biggest complaint, the lack of character development has not been addressed yet. The story continues, but all of the characters seem very distant, and almost not really involved  at all... if that makes any sense. It's like watching an anime where everyone is a supporting character. The main character is still a mystery. Who is Yushiro, what does he like to do, where did he come from, where does he want to go, and does he love anyone or anything? These are all questions that we don't have answers to. An anime where the main character has no identity or depth fails to be interesting to me. I will keep watching and hoping that this series resolves those problems. As it stands now, I can't recommend it to anyone with certainty that they will like it.",1355356800,,1314,4.563559322033898
7932100,3,B000056HOU,"I've been collecting this series since V1 and I still to this day wonder why. Few mech battles, very little story, and talk, talk, talk. This anime moves at a snails pace even compared to DBZ! ""So why do you have 8 volumns, space?"" I dunno! I just keep thinking this series is going to go somewhere and it isn't. If you like yakkedi smackedi talking go for it. Looking for a good mech battle, forget it.",1013126400,,403,4.246753246753247
7932101,3,B000056HOU,"I have viewed volumes 1 - 4 of this series and it still has not sparked my interest like ""Cowboy Beebop"" or ""Blue Submarine No. 6"" did (at least Beebop told a long story in complete chapters). The animation is very good but the story reminds me of a soap opera I used to watch. One week, they had a guy falling off a building, for the whole week, while everyone was out looking for him. I want to scream ""Get to the fricking point already"" when I watched that show and now when I watch Gasaraki. To make matters worse, these DVDs are not cheap, Gasaraki is one of the most expensive series to buy and I don't see a plot climax anywhere in sight. However, I have to tip my hat to the producers of this series for not appealing to the ""Pokemon"" market. Should I stop collecting? Yes, probably. Should you even start? I don't know, watch the first volume on DVD and decide for yourself...",999043200,2,885,4.242603550295858
7932102,5,B000056HOU,"When the test TA subjects in the new T17s, drastic action must be took. After Sat 3 is knocked out, they attempt to shutdown the other TAs, but only manage to subdue one while the other two race around at an incredible speed. The two remaining TA pilots from the JSSDF are forced into combat with the new T17 models. They manage to take care of one and then try freezing out the other, but to no prevail. The TA takes out both the sane pilots and rips the head off of one of the TAs like a headhunter. After the JSSDF retrieve Yushiro, they send into stop it. Yushiro tries and fails as the TA rips off Yushiro's TA head and runs out of the test area. The JSSDF have no choice, but to kill it with a barrage of artilary. But Yushiro doesn't give up. Yushiro's TA, minues head piece, makes an almost insane attempt to subdue the pilot and succeeds. However, this leaves Gowa with another mental outburst. The last episode is basically scenes from previous episodes, but the quality of the flashbacks are top notch. Also in this episode is the examination of Miharu, tests on the Kugai and even Kazukiyo overthrowing Daizaburo's leadership of the Gowa. So as you can see, a lot of cool stuff happens in this volume. You'll even see a little super deformity chemistry between Ataka and Mizuzu. Extras are better this time around. As we get more production sheets and even see a video of the animator showing her beautiful production sheets! Even more, there is also a littl segment in the interview describing how they did the freezing technique. Overal, the bext volume thus far until I get my hands on volume 5, which will come out very quickly!",989798400,,1644,4.483333333333333
7932103,5,B000056HOU,"If you like anime... no... i won't start this off like most reviews. Let me just rephrase that... If you LOVE awesome and complex plots, Gasaraki is for you! Forget whether or not your an anime fan... If you like anime youll love this one hands down... i shouldnt even have to tell you that. But fans of live action should appreciate Gasaraki as well... its a very mature and complex anime.  After the first 3 DVD's its obvious this anime isn't for the weak at heart. Volume 1 was extremely slow paced, feeding you numerous characters for whom you knew no purpose and dialogue that confused you more than educate. Albeit, this is no Lain. Gasaraki is a cakewalk to understand compared to Lain. But nonetheless this is an extremely complexed story. Volume 2 picked up quite nicely. The war in belgistan... the conflicting TA's. And the two invitators meeting on the battlefield. A nice transition into the awesome Volume 3!! From then on it just doesnt stop getting better!!! GET ALL OF THESE!! YOU WONT REGRET IT!!",982627200,3,1014,4.664804469273743
