8505052,5,B006VOX7PO,"This was surprising. I've had this DVD for going on 8 years but had yet to play it until this week. There always seemed to be a performance that would be more compelling.

This DVD captures William Steinberg and the Boston in extremely fine form, playing Haydn symphony 55 (""schoolmaster"") and Beethoven's 7th, uncovered recorded in early October 1970.

It's nice to see a conductor and an orchestra seemingly (gasp!!) having fun. But here you have it. Steinberg leads a scaled down subset of the BSO for the Haydn, and they make the most of the musical postential for high spirits and humor. Plenty of musical space for the harpsichord in the second movement, reputedly a caricature of a schoolmaster wagging his finger at an errant pupil.

And then onto the Beethoven, but with a full orchestra and a more Dionysian bent. This is a red-blooded and strong, but surprisingly fleet, rendition of the 7th, and belies any perception of Steinberg as an metronomic baton-waver, stuck in molasses land. Tempi are well-judged and never drag. There's a lot of elan here. A wonderful performance and the audience responds accordingly.

Most of all, Steinberg seems caught up in the joy of the music making here. He's enjoying himself, and is interesting to watch on the podium. Perhaps not as animated as a Bernstein, and not as robot-like as (say) a Michael Gielen, but certaintly it's fun to watch his direction and facial expressions.

As a bonus we get a performance of the 8th symphony of Beethoven, recorded live by these same forces in 1962. A similarly adroit and spirited performance (albeit one in black and white and not as visually acute as the main performances from 8 years later.) valuable nonetheless. A rousing 8th.

Sound and vision are both what you'd expect for something of this vintage, but certainly never less than acceptable.

So somewhat belatedly I'm happy to say I really enjoyed this and would recommend it for fans of the BSO or Steinberg, or anyone who just wants a rousing food performance of some classics.",1484697600,,2030,4.8497109826589595
8505053,5,B006VOX7PO,A rare treat to see this legendary conductor in action.  Supplements nicely his audio CD discography.  No nonsense podium manner achieves great results.,1380672000,,152,5.565217391304348
8505054,5,B006VOX7PO,"I grew up in Pittsburgh in the 1950's through the early 1970's when William Steinberg was music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.  This video of Steinberg conducting the Boston Symphony Orchestra in Haydn and Beethoven should dispel the stereotype that Steinberg was a conductor of precision devoid of passion.  As a conductor of a vast repertory, he was second to none. His music was full of character. This DVD is more than a historic document; it is a sorely needed musical corrective to a destructive legend.  The viewer should be prepared for a visual quality that is remarkably good for the time of the recordings, but understandably not up to present standards.  My wish is that this DVD might prompt the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra Society to consider issuing DVDs of some of Steinberg's performances with the orchestra that made him great and which he brought to greatness.",1341446400,13,897,5.04054054054054
