7852940,5,6303672213,"Corduroy is no ordinary teddy bear. Just when you least expect it (as when you are asleep), he comes to life. He is full of antics.

A little girl (Lisa) loses Corduroy at a laundry. She pleads with the owner to find him. The mischievous teddy bear ends up, by mistake, at a boy's house. At night, Corduroy comes to life and rides on a skateboard across the home. The parents lock up the dog, thinking that he is the one making all the nighttime commotion. Corduroy gets away.

Lisa continues to miss Corduroy. He takes a ride on a truck chute, and ends up locked in in a box for shipping. The suspense is obvious to all: Will Corduroy and Lisa ever see each other again?

As a teacher, I have found that this VHS keeps the attention of small children very well.",1257724800,,762,4.277777777777778
7852941,5,6303672213,"I am a children's librarian delighted to see two favorite storytime videos available for the home market.  ""A Pocket for Corduroy"" is an extraordinary live-action adaptation of the story by Don Freeman in which a toy bear accidentally gets left behind in a laundromat(with puppet animation so seamless that kids (and grown-ups!) are left wondering how they filmed it!) The video also contains  ""The Remarkable Riderless Runaway Tricycle,""  a very funny live-action adaptation of the book by Bruce McMillan in which a tricycle, whose young owner distractedly abandons it, ends up in a dump, escapes and careens around town before returning, at last, to its downcast owner.  Both these videos are library favorites shown year after year in library storytimes.
Other wonderful videos by the same producer are:
""Corduroy and Other Bear Stories"" (not to be confused with the television show ""Adventures of Corduroy"" -- this is a much better product) and ""A Boy, A Dog, and a Frog, and other Frog Stories.""",1072483200,8,1000,5.116564417177914
