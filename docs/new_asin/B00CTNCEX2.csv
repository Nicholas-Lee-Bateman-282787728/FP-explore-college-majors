8586119,4,B00CTNCEX2,"This Spanish Horror flick ""The Alley"" was quite a pleasant surprise even with a running time of only 76 minutes I didn't feel cheated.

The story is about a beautiful young girl who is an aspiring dancer who goes to an all night laundromat to wash her costumes after  work late one night. There is a serial killer on the loose and she just so happens to run into him at the laundromat.

What comes next is a very fast paced game of cast and mouse. The characters try to outwit and outlast one another,not like Survivor the show but for their lives. There are some very interesting twists along the way. I found it to be very entertaining and a genre bender that was unique.

There were quite a few times I had white knuckles and it was very suspenseful as well as bloody especially towards the end.",1405987200,2,798,4.3355704697986575
